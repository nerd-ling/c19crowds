T is always a matter of sweet anxiety to Punch to confer, with a new volume, a new delight upon his readers. But
new pleasures are difficult to find ; as, indeed, they ought to be, seeing how often we ill-use or neglect the old.
Nevertheless, Punch, about to complete his fourteenth tome, retired to his Brown Study, and dropt himself—lightly
as a snow-flake—in what upholsterers delight to call an easy chair. (We have at this moment in the press an essay—
“Uneasy Thoughts in an Uneasy Seat.”)
Punch clasped his brow with his fingers, giving it a squeeze—(as Poussin's Bacchante squeezeth the big bunch of
grapes to express therefrom its heart-reviving juice)—to delight the heart and stomach of mankind. And then, subtly
to aid the operation, Punch laid his other hand upon a (32-inch) globe. In idleness of fancy, he thought some source
of inspiration would break from that many-coloured ball.
And then, still coaxing the idle thought—fondling the leisure moment, (and it is a pleasant sort of nurse-work this
pleasant sort of weather,) Punch turned and turned the globe about, now his fingers trending towards the North Pole,
and now towards the South.
The heart of Punch was big with “virtuous great intent.” The difficulty was to successfully produce the
blessing. “What further can I do for the world !” still mused Punch,-and still he turned and turned the sphere about.
“Humph 1 Here's France 1 Poor France! And Louis-NAPOLEoN-hatched from goose-egg in eagle's nest—at this
moment sitting to imaginary tailor for measure of imperial robe of moonshine !
“Here comes up Spain. And now IsTURITz enters the Palace, and shows to the Minister the Prodigious Flea
which PALMERSTON placed in his Ambassadorial Ear, with orders to make up his carpet-bag from London.
“And here, Austria, Vienna, with royal lodgings to let; and the Tyrol big as bagpipe, with windy Majesty |
“Ha! Italy And see Pope Pius, with courteous invitation desires the Imperial TEDEsco to withdraw his leg
from the Boot.

iy PREFACE.
“Russia—Hum ! NICHOLAs with an eye on Poland, and in his paternal brain cogitations upon the best and
readiest mode of throwing a new supply of vitals to the Bear.
“Bavaria an Ex-King seated by the Waters of Bitterness, drinking draughts therefrom out of a dancer's slipper.
“America—China—New Zealand–Greece—Ireland ”—
And here Punch withdrew his hand from the fast rolling globe, as from the point of a pike.
For an hour and more, Punch, holding his right knee in his clasped hands,-thought how, in the world's present
confusion, he could best benefit the world.
This, it will be confessed, was a great thought; a thought vast as the Universe.
How to make France peaceful, modest, self-sacrificing f
How to take the continual blister—of native fly—from the breast of Spain Ż
How to give wisdom and an Emperor at the same time to Austria Ž
How to help the Pope as Boots to Ferdinand 7
How—how 2–
And Punch, in despair, again turned the globe—again drummed upon it with his perplexed fingers.
At length he jumped up, with a new resolution beating in him. “I will”—cried Punch—“put forth a Charter for all
human kind. A Charter of One Point, and it is—Let every man, rich and poor, strong and feeble, high and low, let every man
do one thing, and that one shall be sufficient to all things—LET HIM Do His BEST.”
And that Punch might carry out his own injunction, he immediately nibbed his pen to commence his Eighth Year's
work—his Fifteenth Wolume !
PUNCH ATTIRED BY THE GRACEs. (After GUIDO).

OH, all ye bold spirits, who skate
In frosty-faced exhilaration,
Cutting figures of fun, or of eight, .
Allow Punch to improve the occasion.

Who have grace, skill, and courage to shew it;
While for those who may chance to pop through,
There’s precious coldbathing below it.

Popular Superstition.

| Hints on Taxes.
THE properties of matter are not liable to the Property-Tax;
nor is a horse used for taking an airing before the fire chargeable
with the usual horse duty. Poets are not compellable to take
out a poetical license every year from Somerset House; nor are
they obliged to pay duty for a horse, on account of their Pegasus,
Curiosities of Parental Experience. º -
A school, bill, dated Christmas, 1847, gives us sºm
very curious hints for the treatment of juveniles.
A charge of 10s, per quarter for medicine, tells
us the interesting fact, that a child of eight years
of age may consume 120 pennyworth of salts in
twelve weeks, which gives exactly ten ounces per
week. or a fraction less than an ounce and a half
per day, to the unfortunate infant. The charge
- 5f 5, for hair-cutting within the same period,
* furnishes the remarkable fact, that the same
child may have his head continually under the scissors, yet come
|º home to the bosom of his parents with as luxuriant a crop as if
he had not undergone the ten cuttings and comings again, which,
estimating each operation in round numbers at 6d, he must have sº
experienced.

Courtsin G.
How it frisks thro' the flowers, that silly heart of ours,
Now cocks up its scut, and now playfully cowers;
Now greedily nibbles, till, softly and warm,
In some smug self indulgence it makes up its form.
When Duty and Conscience, swift hounds, are let slip,
And the poor silly heart starts away from their grip:
With anguish and trouble, round stone and thro' stubble
How it winds in and out, tries each dodge and each double;
All in vain, sob and strain! One bound more, and it hangs,
Cramp'd, crush'd, and convulsed, in those terrible fangs.
Custom of the Month.
On the Fourteenth of this month, a custom prevails among
female servants of neg-
lecting to clean windows,
scrub floors, make beds,
wash plates and dishes; of
letting joints burn, pots
boil over, and their work
s in general remain undone,
§ in order to loiter at area
doors, looking out for the
postman and a Valentine.
On this day the members of the police force are unusually on
the alert to secure those hearts which, in an epistolary form, are
given them in charge by cooks and housemaids.

The Model Lodger.
He is a quiet gentleman. A smile is perma-
nently settled on his clean face. He wipes his
boots in the mat before he walks up-stairs.
He pays a high rent, and has few friends.
He leaves his drawers open. He has a
cellar of coals at a time. He takes in a
newspaper, and is not in a hurry for it in
the morning. He is never out later than
ten. He shaves with cold water. He never
adds up a bill. He is fond of children. He
likes to buy them sweetmeats, and to take
one occasionally to the theatre. He never
has supper. He never dines at home, except-
ing on a Sunday, and that rarely. The land-
lady orders then his dinner: it is generally a very large joint,
with plenty of vegetables, a very large pie, and a very large slice
of cheese. He never inquires, for the joint, or the pie, or any.
thing, the next day. He lends his books cheerfully. He is in
doubt about the exact number of his shirts. He rarely rings
the bell. He pays for extras without a murmur. Rather likes
music. Does not object to a flute and a piano playing different
tunes at the same time. He is never in arrear with his rent:
if it is not paid the very day it becomes due, the reason is because
he has paid it the day before. The Model Lodger is sheepish,
rich, and contented.

FOx-HUNTING.

The bishop in lawn; Judge in ermine:

And for prize of our sweating and spurring,
Our sore falls and hard knocks, when we i. for our fox,
Find, alas ! that 'tis but a red-herring.

Judgment.
The RE are various kinds of
Judgment. First, there is the
Judgment which your friends
think they have a right to
pass upon every one of your
actions; and secondly, there is
the Judgment ... a court
of law passes upon your
actions, no matter the cause.
The latter you are compelled
to follow; but the former you
may please yourself about.
You had better show your
Judgment in seeking neither.

YACHTING.
All so taut and so trig, regulation and rig,
The yacht-squadron’s a fleet, every inch of it;
And to each yachting dandy the tar's life comes handy,
Save the peril, privation, and pinch of it.
So when life's course is clear, we hand, reef, and steer,
Ape the blue-jacket's accents, his air, and his act;
But stern duty's rough work, we’re all ready to shirk,
And, tho’ passing for sailors, are yachts-men in fact.

DEER-STALKING.
Those who go out deer-stalking don't venture on walking,
Or talking, or running, or leaping; -
But thro' dry and thro' damp alike, rush, rock, and swamp alike,
On their bellies go crawling and creeping.
Iſence my moral hath flowed: howe'er ſoul be your road,
And how foully soe'er you go thro' it, |
The world ne'er cries shame, provided the game

A Custom of the Month.
oNDon Fashionables have a custom of quit-
ting Town in the month of August. On
their departure, the shutters of their man-
sions are all closed, which serves as a public
intimation that they have taken flight.
Many persons, whose means do not allow
them to practise this fashionable custom
to the ºil. and who are yet desirous to
s have the credit of following it, limit
s themselves to shutting up their win-
dows, resorting for change of air from
the atmosphere of the drawing room, to
inhale the breezes which ventilate the
two-pair back.

Custom of the Month.
Octobert is famous for the rural festivities which attend the
celebration of the nuptials of Malt and Hops, which are now united
in the happy state of beer; in which condition, also, are a large
portion of the company who assist at the interesting ceremony.
A Model Son.
He dresses in black, with a white neckcloth. He never goes
to the theatre. He is not fond of cards, though he takes a hand
occasionally at whist to please his old father; but then it is only for
penny points. He has no talent for running in debt, or any genius
for smoking. He does not flirt, or read light publications, or
have noisy friends to call upon him. He
pays ready money for everything, and insists
upon discount. He has a small sum in a
particular safe Bank, somewhere. He
dances, but seldom, and then only with
young ladies with a very certain income.
e does not care much for beauty, and has
a soul above pins and rings. e never
keeps the servants up, and has a horror of
reading in bed. He decants, the wines,
and compliments his father adroitly upon
his “tawny old Port.” He carves without spilling any of the
gravy at table, and is very obliging in executing all paternal
errands and commissions. There is rarely more than one Model
Son in each family; but he does duty, enough for half-a-dozen,
as he is continually being held up to the other sons, who bear
him no very violent love in consequence, as the very model of
perfection.

commemoration of some of his numerous labours, and he selects seven,
taken quite at random from his catalogue of achievements, which he
confidently places against the seven of his predecessor, hencuies,
which the whole world has, for the last few centuries, been making such
a fuss about. When it is remembered that Punch performs no less than
forty or fifty. Herculean labours in a week—for he defies HERCULEs,

“SILENCE IN THE GALLERY |"
WE hear with great satisfaction that, in the construction of the new
House of Commons, the architect has endeavoured to preserve a main
illar of our, Constitution, We allude to the exclusion of strangers
rom the galleries during the mystic rites of a division. This privilege
of the House, so important, so intact, is doubtless cherished by all true
Britons. By means of it, the numbers on a division are kept perfectly
secret—quite so; the names of the voters on either side are no more
divulged than their speeches; and thus is secured the independence of
the members and honour of the House.
We rejoice, therefore, to announce that this prerogative will be
rendered more convenient in its continuance, by an ingenious mechanical
contrivance. In the reporters’, gallery there will
be suspended by pullies over each “gentleman
of the press” a large cover in the form of an
extinguisher, which will descend on the signal
being given by a wink from the Speaker. When
members become suddenly alive to the actual
presence of the gentlemen (at whom they have
\ nevertheless been speaking for two hours, perhaps),
EA and when the ancient rights of Parliament enjoin
that strangers be excluded, the reporters will be
effectually “put out” by the descent of the extin-
guishers. As for the other gallery, there will be
underneath each stranger a trap-door, through
which he will be made to disappear; whilst those
= having Speaker's orders will be whisked up through
# the roof by concealed wires.

THICK AND THIN ADVOCACY WITH A WENGEANCE |
OUR readers are aware that the trial of REID and M'CABE for the
Mirfield murders issued in the conviction of both the prisoners; and
that subsequently a confession was made by REID, exonerating
M‘CABE from all share in the transaction. Thus much, it was stated,
had been confessed, previously to the trial, to MR. Seymour, REID's
Counsel, who nevertheless endeavoured, in his capacity of advocate, to
throw the guilt of the murder on M'CABE, the innocent man. The
accusation of this atrocious conduct is denied by MR, SEYMoUR, who,
however, in a letter to the Times, propounds the following precious
piece of morality:—
“And now, Sir, assuming that which I deny, and admitting for a moment that a “full
confession" was made to me previous to the trial, which wholly exculpated M*CABE, I
am yet to learn that I would be deserving of blame for endeavouring to throw the whole
guilt upon M*CADE, if the evidence by which the jury were bound to decide, warranted
such a fourse. I am yet to learn that this would be either morally or professionally
wrong.”
. MR. SEYMoUR's moral, if not, his professional education, is ve
incomplete. A barrister may perhaps be warranted in going throug
thick and thin to save his client, though that client may be a known
cut-throat; but surely he is not jº. in going through anything so
thin, as MR. SEYMour's idea of the forensic conscience, or through
anything so thick as innocent blood.
Mr. Polk's Olive-Branch.
IN PRESIDENT Polk's Message to Congress—a document which in
small type is at least three times as long as our arm—there occurs the
passage following:—
“Whilst our armies have advanced from victory to victory, from the commencement
of the war, it has always been with the olive-branch of peace in their hands; and it has
been in the power of Mexico, at any step, to arrest hostilities by accepting it.”
We take it, however, that the tender of this olive-branch to the
Mexicans was accompanied by a certain condition. BROTHER JonATHAN
extends his olive-branch as MR. TURPIN used to present his pistol-
with the demand of “Your money or your life.”

THE CROMWELL LETTERS.
THE genuineness of certain letters attributed by THOMAS CARLYLE to
OLIVER CRoxwell, is becoming a matter of dispute, and Punch there-
fore, seeing a squabble going on, . the group of disputants with the
off-hand exclamation of “Now then! what’s all this about? what’s
the row?” One of the reasons given for the letters not being genuine
is, that CROM well asks a friend to buy him “a new gravat,” which
is thought to be as absurd as though the Protector had mentioned a
“By Ron Tie,” a “Strong Youth's Oxonian,” a “TAGLIONI Wrap-
rascal,” a “ Rºit: "it. lation Dickey,” or any other modern
monstrosity that .." ingenuity has devised. CROMWELL’s
declaration in one of his alleged epistles, that he will “stand no non-
sense,” is strongly, and we thin justly objected to as a bit of an
anachronism, for we suspect that the Stoke-Pogis revolution, of which
poor Hood was the historian, gave us the earliest official intimation on
record of a desire to “stand no nonsense;” a resolution at which, if we
remember rightly, the beadle of the bewildered borough had arrived.
Taking the CRoxwell Letters altogether, and then taking them one by
one, we think the CRAM—well, Letters would be the most appropriate
title by which they could be called.
Punch's New Battery.
THERE is no sacrifice which Punch is not ready to make for his
country's good. He therefore generously offers, the Government a
suggestion gratis, which he knows they would give him several thousand
pounds for. It is a simple expedient, not for strengthening, but for
rendering absolutely impregnable, our national defences. Let, every
accessible point along the coast be fortified with a large fire-engine, to
be supplied from a reservoir of the new anaesthetical agent. It will be
only necessary to play liberally on an invading army with chloroform,
to reduce the whole host to a state of utter insensibility; Qur military
as well as our surgical operations will thus be performed without pain;
our triumph will be bloodless; and a small addition to the fire-brigade
will enable us wholly to dispense with a standing army.

A Clerical Comedy.
We cannot compare the active Bishop or Oxford to a snail, or we
should say that he had decidedly drawn in his horns, by withdrawing
his opposition to DR, HAMPDEN. The Regius Professor, it seems, is
orthodox, after all... We do not often hear of amateur, performances
among the clergy; but, considering what has been the termination of
the HAMPDEN controversy, we may say, that the prelates and others
engaged in it have been enacting the comedy of Much Ado about
Nothing.

Though it is an old saying, that “dead men tell no tales,” it does
not by any means follow that dead men write no letters to newspapers.
The Editor of the Times has been lately favoured with the following
polite communication, from a gentleman who ought, according to his
own showing, to be a regular “tenant of the tomb,” instead of an
occupant of No. 25, Ludgate Street. We will, however, allow the
lively defunct to speak for himself:—
“SIR,--I presume in the hurry of business your correspondent has made a mistake—
viz., that of returning the name of “Mr. Collingwood” as one of the Common Councilmen
for the Ward of Castle Baynard, who died last June. According to the advertisement
in your paper of to-day, you will perceive it to be your obedient servant,
“25, Ludgate Street, Dec. 22. “WILLIAM HENRY CARLIN.”
It will be seen that MR. HENRY CARLIN objects to the publication of
another gentleman's name “as one of the Common Councilmen, who died
last June,” and adds, “you will perceive it to be your obedient servant,
WILLIAM HENRY CARLIN,” who, if there is any yirtue in grammar,
“died last June,” and ought to have been returned accordingly. ... We
cannot suppose that a being so sagacious as a Common Councilman
can have been, so absurd as to write to a newspaper to announce hi
own death, and we therefore find it difficult to look upon the note in
question as anything more than a ghostly production; and if we trust
to the letter, we must give credit to the spirit.
The King who is never Drunk.
THERE formerly prevailed an opinion that it was conducive to a
man's health to be drunk once a month. This is now considered to be
a #: fallacy. It derives, however, some confirmation from the
indisposition under which Louis-PHILIPPE was observed to labour at
the late opening ºf the French Chambers. It is many

THE Westminster boys last week performed the Adelphi of TERENCE

usually distinguished Adelphi. audience. In the º we observe
that Syrus Geta “viridis” or “green,” a piece of Latinity which we
believe is borrowed from a canine passage in our own pages. We recognise
also several creditable attempts at joking on the subject of the late
General Election, and some respectable * both of Free Trade
and Protection, as also of Pelides, and of the Country Party, and all
parties politically concerned. In particular we have to notice the jºke
of non Muntzior, intended in the sense of non mentior, which—pardon
the expression, ladies—is “I lie not.” -
Now, whilst we acknowledge the force of the pun, we cannot admit
the justice of the innuendo, and we must say that there is no such word
as Muntzior in our book, any more than there is in Ainsworth's Diction-
ary. This observation we feel called upon to make, because, from the
general character of the Epilogue, we perceive that one of the books
read at Westminster is Punch. We hope the Westminster scholars will
persevere in the study of our classic periodical, by their familiarity with
atification to their
illustrious auditors, and will, we trust, give continually increasing satis-
faction to their parents and friends.
Canine or Canonical ?
THE Fermanagh Reporter advertises a sale of the effects of the late
reverend and celebrated Father ToM MAGUIRE; among them being his

No doubt the worthy priest was a good pastor to his flock; but, in the
bullism of his country, we may take the liberty of observing, that he
was equally a good shepherd to his kennel.

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR. BRIEFLESS.
INTRODUCTION.
REAT interest is taken by
the public in legal bio-
phies, a fact evidenced
y the favour bestowed
on the admirable works
of Lord CAMPBELL and
MR. HoRAch. Twiss,
whose productions, it is
true, relate to those who
have actually occupied
the woolsack, while it is
only a Lord Chancellor
in posse who now offers
his memoirs to the
world. It usually hap-
pens that the early
J struggles of genius form
the most attractive pages
in the record of its
career, and it is humbly
suggested that the reader
of these papers may give
them all the charm of
an autobiography of a
THURLow, an ERs KINE,
or an ELDoN, by simply
investing MR. BRIEFLEss
with an . Great Seal, and fancying that he is already lolling
on that woolsack upon which it is his honest ambition—some day or
other—to recline. - - - - -
Most great men put of the writing of their memoirs until their high
position is gained, and their impressions of the various incidents they
met with on the journey have become, almost effaced by time, and dis;
tance; but how much better would it have been if they had chronicled
the circumstances of their professional §. on, the instant, and
supplied their memoirs fresh and fresh, like new milk, or hot and hot,
like mutton chops, to an appreciating world?
MR. BRIEFLEss considers himself in the light of a traveller on a long
and arduous journey. His sensations are those of a determined voyager,
who, though i. for the Pyramids, has got no further than White-
chapel on his route; but the difficulties that beset him in getting as far
as Whitechapel must not be omitted from his note-book. The costliness
of the premier pas will always give it a yalue in the eyes of the sym:
athising reader; and it is hoped, therefore, that the autobiography of
º Brieriess, the Lord Chancellor that is to be—if merit meets with
its reward—may form a companion to the excellent Liſe of Lord Eldon,
by MR, HoRAce Twiss, and a necessary sequel to those tomes that
LoRD, CAMPBELL has lately given—price £410s, in large octavo–to a
grateful community.
CHAPTER THE FIRST.
MY BIRTH AND EARLY EDUCATION, AccordinG TO THE BEST OF MY
RECOLLECTION.
I shall, begin with my cradle, which may be considered the first
“rocky pass”—as the playbills have it—that infancy has to go through;
and, by the way, the º: motion of the first bed of {. is
exceedingly characteristic of that sea of trouble by which human life is
often typified. To be tossed about from one side to the other is the
fate of man, from his first oscillation like a pendulum in the crib or
cradle, to the period when he gets into the ful ºf of his existence,
until the time when—to resume the simile of the pendulum—his
works are worn out, he is incapable of being wound up, and he stops
because he can go no longer. To some, º tic has been as painful
as the tie doloreur; but if the regulator has been well employed, and
the hands have properly performed their duty, the human horloge need
not be ashamed to show its face, however humble the case to which
fortune may have consigned it.
I shall not imitate the practice of those persons who, having raised
themselves from nothing by their own merit, attempt to sacrifice
that merit by, making out that their families were somebodies before
they came to be nobodies, and that therefore there is nothing extra-
ordinary in their coming to be somebodies again. I shall not try
to do for myself what MR. HoRACE Twiss has amiably undertaken
to do for LorºD ELpon, and make myself out a descendant of some
illustrious ambassador who came over and “flourished” somewhere
about the second century, for all this flourishing goes for little or
nothing at the present day.
The antiquity of the BRIEFLEss Family could no doubt be traced in
a manner quite as satisfactory as usual, if I were inclined to draw out
my pedigree; but I shall content myself with going as far back as the
Catalogus Brevium Irregularium in the Westminster Grammar, from
one of which brevia or Briefs, the name of BRIEFLEss may perhaps be
derived. Declining to form a sort of acrobatic exhibition of my
ancestors for the sake of building up a family pyramid and elevatin
myself to the very top, I shall reverse the process of MENEAs, an
instead of hoisting my father on to my shoulders, I shall spring upon
his, without seeking to assume any greater ancestral elevation than
the old boy's back, can afford. My paternal parent, or rather the
immediate block of which I am a direct chip, , was the youngest
son of the eldest grandson of one of the standard-bearers in the civil
wars, who died with his country in his mouth, victory in his ear, a flash
of triumph in each eye, and his sword in his hand. -
The military spirit which once breathed in our family had blown
itself completely out before my birth, and my earliest infancy glided by
in the pursuit of the peacefuſ arts of reading, writing, and arithmetic,
with, occasionally, the use of the globes. Such was my precocity, in
these studies, that before my years had numbered three, my lips
could count ten. It would be tedious to trace myself from the arms of
the nurse to the hands of the schoolmaster, but I think I am justified
in saying that I showed no peculiar aptitude for any high legal dignity,
except, perhaps, that of Solicitor-General, for which I evinced a sort of
qualification, by asking for everything, that came in my way, I do not
lay much stress upon this incident, but “I merely mention it,” as
the saying goes, that the reader may take it for what it happens to be
worth. I will not say that the fact had any influence on my choice of a
profession; but this is so large a subject, that it must be reserved for
another Chapter.
3}jilogopijical $tanțag,
SINCE mortals are all, both great and small,
Created by their dresses,
And folks will scan the worth of a man
By that which he possesses;--
If they wish to draw respect and awe
From ignorant beholders,
The rich must wear their virtues rare
Upon their backs and shoulders.
Yet the eye that probes thro' stars and robes,
Wigs, velyet, silk, and ermine,
May feel a doubt, whether inside or out
8. homage should determine;
For the judge's mob may its wisdom rob
From the tail of a four-legged mother,
And the grandeur's germ of the human worm
May spring from his silken brother.
Plumes! pearls that gem beauty's diadem,
Unguents! that perfume give it,
Your pomp and grace is the refuse base
Of the ºstrich, oyster, and civet.
Even mighty kings—those helpless things,
Whose badge is the royal ermine-
Their glory's pride, they must steal from the hide
Of the meanest spotted vermin.
Since the lords of the earth, to borrow the worth
And splendour their vanity wishes,
Must their littleness deck in the gaudy wreck
..Of birds, and beasts, and fishes.
Since kings confide in a reptile's hide
To make their greatness greater,
Why, Punch he cries, when the pageant he eyes,
*Čh "alack for poor human Nature!”
Christmas Bills for Parliament.
WE understand that it is contemplated by tradesmen, to petition the
legislature for a partial return to the old Saxon style in the nomenclature
of the months. It is designed by them to request that the month last
past should be called º, and the present Pay-Monath; more-
over, with respect to fay Monath, or the Month of Pay, to pray for
some measure for its better observance.
speed The PLOUGH In Ireland.
We learn, with great pleasure, that LoRD CLARENDON has established
some Practical Instructors in Husbandry for Ireland, who, in the words
of the Times, “go about from place to place, and point out to the
farmers the great advantage to be derived from digging and turning
their land.” We hope that the Irish will save Punch further trouble
by having, once for all, an effectual dig at their own country.

If Prize Oxen could speak, and if one of them bore the name of
HoRATIo, another might quote to him the line from Hamlet, and
exclaim—
“To such base uses must we come, HonATIo,”
as, in the pride of pampered pinguidity, they pass together the shop of
some tallow-chandler, and eyeing the piles of . reflect on the
sixes—and sevens—to which they must be brought by the cattle-
stuffing mania. SUETQNIUs—a great authority on Suet, and who, by
the way, disdained to butter the CESARs—would, had he lived to the
present day, have exposed the extravagances of our time, as he did
those of his own; for he would certainly have revolted against the
extravagance of fattening up for the melting tub, and converting into
food for reflection, those animals that were intended for food of a more
substantial kind. -
When we see the mountainous flanks of the monster oxen in Baker
Street Bazaar, we cannot help thinking of the ignominious end that is
in store for the wretched brutes whose ultimate ºblaze of triumph”
will only be such as the ignition of some scores of pounds of kitchen
candles will afford. The last remains of the gigantic creature that
stood panting for admiration at the Cattle Show, may be traced at last
to the socket of some wretched rushlight shade, in which the last relic
of the once proud animal is doomed to expire. Alas! that brutal, like
human greatness, should come to such an insignificant end
TALES OF THE HATCHWAY.
THERE is an old but, we begin to think, an objectionable proverb, which
forbids us to perform the process of enumeration upon our chickens
until they are hatched. . An ingenious tradesman, who hangs out at
the four-and-a-half milestone on the Hammersmith Road, has discovered
a process by which, he says, he can hatch a thousand chickens per hour,
from ten till dusk. Now it is very clear, that unless these rapid results
of incubation are counted in their eggy state, the necessary calculation
afterwards would prove an incubus that no industry could overcome;
and we have therefore an instance of a necessity for sometimes count.
ing chickens before they are hatched. The inventor of the ingenious
process is a MR. QANTELo, whose name reminds us that we can't-tell-
ow he does it. We have heard that he will undertake to hatch every-
thing, even a mare's nest, if it is brought to him in a fit condition for
the experiment to be tried.
THE FAMILY IN ARCHES COURT.
It has lately been observed that nearly all the officials of the Arches
Court are related to SIR HERBERT, JENNER Fust., We presume that
the patronage of the Court of Arches is dispensed on the principle of
“Fust come Fust served.”
CHRISTMAS-BOXES FOR GOVERNMENT.
It is rather a shabby arrangement on the part of the State to pay its
officers so badly that the public must make up the deficiency with
Christmas-Boxes, or leave some very useful and hard-working function-
aries extremely short of cash at this festive season of the year. The
Postmen are, as everybody knows, remunerated on such a shabby scale,
that the honest part of them are half-starved, while the few who cannot
resist the temptation to eke out their income by unwarrantable means,
are in the habit of pocketing an odd money-letter or so, to make both
ends meet. It is true that, though these supplementary payments do
not come out of the public chest, they nevertheless come out of
the public pocket, though it is a mere lottery whose pocket shall indi-
vidually suffer, and the tax may in some instances fall upon those who
cannot afford to bear it. We think it would be better to abolish the
pilfering and the Christmas-Boxes at once, by paying the Postmen more
suitable salaries in the first instance, than those which they at present
receive.
The principle of º: public servants as mendicants depending on
the generosity of the Nation is not one that we can approve, at all
events in reference to such humble functionaries as letter-carriers,
whose duties are not of a kind to enable us to measure their com:
paratiye merits, and reward them accordingly. We think the practice
of giving Christmas-Boxes might be found to possess some advantages
if it were acted upon towards official persons, for their conduct is of
jº to the community; and it would be as well if the community
had every year an opportunity of expressing an opinion in the manner
that is usually the most effective.
If the Ministers, for example, depended for a part of their pay—like
the Postmen—upon Christmas-Boxes, there would be an easy method
by which the Government would get at the sense of the Nation upon
the conduct of the Cabinet, individually and collectively. If we heard,
for instance, that the Premier had called for his Christmas-Box, our
fº. contribution of half-a-crown would tell him that we approved
is, recent conduct, on the whole; while our stintingly-doſed-out
shilling, sent by the hands of our servant to the CHANCELLOR of THE
}º would intimate to him our impatience of the Income-
Tax and a few other burdens from which we think, we ought to be
relieved. Our half-crown to SIR GEORGE GREY would encourage him
to proceed in the work of his department with the same spirit he has
hitherto shown, and would hint to him our approval of the sanitary
measures he is actively engaged in furthering.
IORD PALMERStoN, also, should not be without a token of our appro-
bation, which he has at least done nothing to forfeit lately, for he has
not yet plunged us into an European war, notwithstanding his somewhat
inflammable tendency. The Opposition could not, of course, take the
same means of getting at the sense of the Nation upon their policy; but
we think some of the heads of the party might resort to the old custom
of sending in a Christmas piece; and we are sure that our friend LoRD
BROUGHAM could easily make up a document, of this description that
would entitle him to consideration at the hands of the public. Some of
the expectants of office would be quite in character, were they to apply
as the “waits;” and we fancy we can see PEEL, in the capacity of
turncock, coming to our gate professing to be “the man wot keeps
everything right in the main.”
The Gin-and-Water Cure for Low Spirits.
THE proprietors of a certain, establishment have announced, as a
temptation to purchasers, that in consequence of the fall in British
spirits, they have reduced the price of their gin. We wonder if the
fall in British, spirits alluded to is that which has been occasioned by
our commercial difficulties. If so, it is something like .*. out of
the .#. into the fire, to rush from mere financial difficulties
into absolute and utter “blue ruin.”

LETTER ON OUR NATIONAL DEFENCES.
FROM THE BROOK-GREEN. WOLUNTEER.
It is with much pleasure that we lay before our readers a com-
munication on the important subject of our National Defences, from
our old friend the }. Volunteer. A topic which has
engaged the pen of the Great Captain of the Age may well º
the attention of the little Militia Man of the suburbs, who, thqug
he cannot call himself a “Soldier that has seen Service,” like a
very sensible correspondent of the Times, may fairly be considered
a soldier who would have seen service if there had been, any
service to be seen. We will, however, allow him to speak for him;
self on this § and we are sure that his views will be received
with all the deference they deserve.
“To Mr. Punch.
“SIR-Though my military ſame is limited to your columns,
in which I have had the honour to serve, Ifeel that the position
I there occupied gives me a claim on the attention of the public
at a moment like the present, when an attempt is being made to
º ---
throw the nation into a sort of delirium fremºns at the prospect of
the possible arrival of an invading foe. It will be a matter of the
utmost satisfaction to me if my country should owe to the reason-
ing of the Brook-Green Volunteer that feeling of safety which she
has a right to expect would be, converted into actual security
at his hands if danger should really arrive.
“I perceive, Sir, that a certain Lord ELLEsNPRE has been
sounding an alarum in the Times, and not only suggesting the facility
with which a French army might march into London, but alleging
that the wisest movement of our military in such an event . be
to march out of it. No sooner, Sir, did Ireadthis sentence, than I
instinctively resumed my regimentals, and, emptying out of my
cartridge-box the rushlights which for the last few months it had
contained, I darted into my little back parlour, from which Iissued
in a few moments, as some else did from the brain of JuPITER,
armed from head to foot. This spontaneous act on my part may
serve to show the spirit which would animate thousands in the same
position as myself, if an invasion were to be talked about. The British
soldiery walk out of the capital, as the foe walked in! Perish the
humiliating thought! Why, Sir, there is notatradesman, who, if
aparty of Frenchmen appeared in his front shop, would not gather
his assistants round him in the back-yard; and they would all
resolve to sell their lives as dearly as their groceries, their meat,
their bread, or any other articles in which they might happen to deal.
“If British Commerce is suspected of such poltroonery as LoRD
ELLEsmere insinuates against it, let the sons of mercantile in-
dustry make at once a manifestation of their warlike spirit. Let
the yard measure be exchanged for, or rather combined with, the
sword—which could easily be done by making them both the same
length; and let every linendrapery, establishment show in its
“young men” a phalanx that, while observing an armed neutrality
towards the customers—excepting always as far as the pockets
are concerned, shall afford a guarantee against the possibility of a
successful invasion. I should recommend that in º the principal
houses there should be a drill every morning before the commence-
marches round the shop. For my own part, I am resolved to resume
that brief but brilliant military career which won for me unfading laurels—I
have them now in pots, at my garden gate—on the field of Brook Green;
and I hope every tradesman will consider his shop an encampment, and
neverlook at his ledger without being surrounded by those accoutrements
which will keep him prepared to attend to the military as well as the civil
‘orders of the day.”
“I have long, as you know, accustomed myself to the hardships of a
military life, and I have again . myself on fatigue duty at the call of my
country; and I went so far on boxing-night, in the enthusiasm of the season
as to effect a bivouac, which Iown was half involuntary, and only commenced
at four o'clock in the morning, on the confines of Brook Green.
“A reliance on the spirit of the British Soldier has been very properl
expressed; but, Sir, are the British Butcher, the British Baker, the Britis
Tinker, the British Tailor, the British Ploughboy, and the British Apothecary
ºfori will not include the British Thief on this occasion—to be despised?

capacity, but as contributors to the Commissariat department; for the
times must be indeed out of joint when this class of tradesmen shall
refuse to put a shoulder-aye, or a leg—to the common veal, and
allow the defenders of their country to sing out for the roast beef of Old
England in vain. As the “Soldier of Service” º asks in the
columns of the Times, where are the stores to collected for an
invading army? and is it not preposterous to suppose that the º:

“I confess that I agree with my Lond ELLEs MERE as to the defence-
less nature of our turnpike roads, nor do I think that the toll-collectors
would be able to make a very formidable stand against an enemy, con-
sidering that the British pikemen are being very properly got rid of,
and will soon be quite extinct. The Kensington outposts are, perhaps,
the strongest, but I should be unwilling to put much confidence in even
all the bars on that trust. I had much rather rely on the arming of
our butchers' boys, and others, who would keep the roads in a state of

GERMAN IMPRESSIONS.
We are glad to be able to present to our readers the following extract,
on the opening of Parliament, literally translated from the forthcoming
work of His Excellence, Privy Councillor, and Chief Puddle and Pump.
work Director (Geheim Rath und oben Pfitzem und Pumpemworken-
Director), Von PLAPPERTAsche, at present on a secret mission to this
country from the grand-ducal Court of Pumpernickle-kleiningen.
After describing his struggles in getting into the House, and aspecies
of mobbing he seems to have encountered, from having gone in a
Court Suit, (at the cruel suggestion of a person connected, we regret
to say, with this journal), HERR. Von PLAPPERTAsche proceeds—
“That was glorious! Now was I in the actual, sensible presence of
world-famous, and to-me-already-by-frequent-perusal-of-the-Augsburgh-
Gazette-politically-familiar men, comfortably, though not without serious
injury to one of my richly-with-flowers-in-silk-embroidered coatlaps, at
length seated. The in-Punch-weekly-delineated, and therefore at once-
by-one-recognised PEEL was with Lord PALMERSTON, in earnest, mind-
stretching conversation deeply sunk (vertieſ). Without doubt, they
were arranging a method by which the For-foreign-affairs-through-so.
many-changes-of-administration-Principal-Secretary might defend him-
self against the shattering (Erschüttendes) and over-numerous-years-and-
unconnected-affairs-with-voluminous-papers-complicated impeachment of

defend. A by-my-side-sitting and, from his remarks, deeply-in-politicaſ.
intrigues-involved gentleman, in the purest German, with the heartiest
politeness, explained much to me, as a stranger, holding in my native
Court high position, in the deepest degree interesting.
. ...'That is LoRD GEORGE BENTINck!’ said he, to me with his finger
indicating a with-long-beard-and-heavy-tread-crossing-the-floor, like-a-
trooper-of-the-Wallenstein-Walloon-corps-man. “With that thick stick
he, by striking, in a line retains the impetuous race-horses at Derby and
St. Leº, until the signal for the race lets them in fiery gallop break-
out. These, and such traits of a nationally-personally-characteristic
kind, were on me with the utmost readiness by my courteous (hºſtich)
and earnestly-grave neighbour bestowed.
“‘See you SIBTHoRPE * he continued, pointing out to me a with-

with-traces-of-ample-feeding expanded man, in all respects resembling a
wealthy-of-the-well-endowed-English-Church-rector".
The extract goes on for five º of similar description... We cannot
help thinking that this respectable foreigner has been made the victim
of a heartless misrepresentation, and has had SIRRobert INGLIs pointed
out to him for Colonel, Sibthor PE, and MR. Muntz for Lord

insert the docu-
ment until it had
been submitted to
the EARLoFELLEs-
MERE. The noble
Earl, however,
having carefully
perused the bul-
ãº ** shadows, in every
*-* particular, the
coming event:-
“Head Quarters, Buckingham Palace, London [date not fired].
“MossIEUR,--I have the honour to communicate the intelligence of
the landing of the army under my command on the coast of Dover, with
the submission of the capital of England. I write this in the palace of
the Guelphs, where the tricolor waves triumphantly above the standard
of our natural enemy. - -
“Our troops embarking at Boulogne, at Calais, and at Dunkirk, met
failing, the transports were towe
mid-way in the Channel. The win
by the Comte de Paris, the Château d’Eu, La Charte, and other steamers.
At day-break we came to anchor; and at 7 P.M. landed the troºps-
with horses and artillery—from the jolly-boats. The guns from. Dover
Castle kept an unsteady, droppin #. during the disembarkation: at
length a handful of the Algerine Immortals—irritated by the pertinacit
of the * . the chalk-cliffs, and in five minutes-–by the watch
—spiked the cannon. Immediately the tricolor floated from the
Castle of César. -
“On the capture of the Castle, the Mayor and Corporation of Dover
brought the key of the town to the beach, and supplicated for honour-
able terms of .."; These I have thought fit to grant; thus
leaying the friendliest disposition in our rear. -
“At nine o'clock the Directors of the Railway appeared with first-
class tickets for the whole of the army; having, moreover, under the
direction of our Commissariat, provided the necessary means of transit
for baggage and artillery." -
. “Our army arrived at eleven o'clock in London, very fresh and in the
highest spirits. We formed at the station, and marched over London
Bridge. Here we saw the Pool of the Thames—all the shipping had
already, hoisted the tricolor—which, ...; the glory of our
national marine, I have henceforth ordered to be called the Belle Poule.
‘...At the end of the Rue du Roi de Guillaume—in English, Kin
William Street—the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London presente
themselves. His Lordship begged that the capital might, be spared
on the payment of fifty millions sterling. To this—the money being ready
—I thought fit to accede. (A ball is to be given to the conquering army
at the Mansion House, by the wives and daughters of the merchants
and bankers.). His Lordship then unrolled a panorama of London, and
distributed billets to the army according to the choice of the officers.
“As we approached Lombard Street, we learned that the Guards,
commanded by the EARL OF ELSEWHERE, had left London by the
Windsor road.
“The army, halted to take a good look at the Bank of England;
then, much refreshed, pushed on through Cheapside.
“The tricolor was hung out from all the churches, and women, with
tricolor cap-ribbons, were seen at every window. The whole march,
from the station to head-quarters, was an ovation.
“Arriving in Fleet Street, the whole army, drew up before No. 85,
known to Europe as the Office of Punch. , Wishing to save an unneces-
sary effusion of blood, we summoned Punch to capitulate. Whilst
however, we held him in parley at the first floor, the pioneers entered
the building by a back entrance. The army called for the head of Punch ;
but I have thought it necessary to delay the gift. Our great enemy—
the enemy. of France—is now in chains in the Tower. It is my inten:
tion—abolishing for ever the gallows as unworthy of the civilisation of
the age—to guillotine Punch on Tower Hill.
“The army proceeded down the Strand, and I have fixed my head-
quarters at Buckingham Palace, whereupon may now be read, in letters of
gold, “Ici on parle Français.”
“I trust that HER MAJESTY, PRINCE ALBERT, and the Royal Family
of England will ever retain
the liveliest recollections
of the generosity, the chi-
yalry, and bienséance of the
invading army of -
“The troops have been 2-
received with properrespect =º \\
by the enemy, who is at ' ' /TT
last, brought, to the cºn: Sº-
viction of the immeasurable *
superiority of our arms. - - -
“It was my intention to quarter the 95th Ethiopian Chasseurs in
the National Gallery; but—it is a touching proof of the taste of the
French horse—the animal could not be induced to enter the building.
“The statue of the charlatan NELsoN has been displaced from a
column, which will be surmounted by the effigy of our own real hero,
JEAN DU BART.
“I have further caused the marble statue of NAPOLEON-for many
years shamefully concealed in the wine-cellar of the DUKE of
WELLINGTON.—to be elevated to the arch opposite Apsley House,
which is to be henceforward known, as Austerlitz Lodge. The statue
of the DUKE of WELLINGTON is already in the melting-pot, and will
serve to reinforce our artillery. - -- - -
“Twenty thousand Frenchmen domiciled in London—namely, yalets,
drawing-masters, cooks, and fiddlers—appeared in the streets in the
uniform of National Guards.
“I have thought it necessary to, send. Mons. JULLIEN-a French
subject—to the Tower, until I shall receive further orders from the
Government. - -
“MADAME CELESTE (another French subject) I have permitted to
act at the Adelphi on parole. -
“In a few days, I shall be enabled to send you an inventory of the
wealth of London; which, until the conclusion of the Opera season, I
propose to make our head-quarters.
“Deign, Monsieur, to receive the assurance of my highest con-
sideration.
“To the Minister of Foreign Affairs.”
“BUGEAUD.”
THE MONETARY COUNTRY-DANCES.
THE “Money Pressure,” the tightness in the Market, and all that
sort of thing, occasionally intrude their disagreeable influence upon our
Christmas festivities. As we are not of the grumbling party that would
make the worst of everything, already rather bad, we are disposed to
turn our vities, into gaieties, as far as, may be done without
impairing the energies required to be earnestly employed in a period
of difficulty. We think, however, there can be no great harm in
F. a set of Monetary Country-Dances, to be danced during the
l
olidays. -
“The Accommodation.”
...Partners advance, cross cheques, and retire. First gentleman presents
bill to second gentleman, hands across, balancez, and pair off in oppo-
site directions.
“The Temporary Suspension.”
First gentleman stops, second gentleman advances, turns first gentle-
man round, and both resume their places: -
The same thing is done on all sides, and every one sets to his partner.
“The Renewal of Confidence.”
All come forward, together towards, lady (of Threadneedle Street),
who takes each gentleman by the hand in turn, and leads, him to his
own position. aving advanced to each, they all join hands, with
grande ronde and finale.
War's Injudicious Alarms.
LORD EGERTON ELLESMERE has been raising a º outcry respecting
our deficiency in point of national defences. He has made such a
display of our weakness as really to encourage aggression. He has, in
effect, told the French that we should be thoroughly done in case of an
invasion from them; so that our neighbours may regard him as one of
those little pigs that run about the country ready-roasted, crying “Come
and eat us.” We hope we are not yet absolutely dished . to their
hands, and we believe that it is not in the power even of French cookery
to give Englishmen a dressing.

T R A V E L S I N LO N DO N.
A NIGHT'S PLEASURE.
AVING made a solemn
engagement during
the last. Midsum-
mer holidays with
my young friend
AUGUSTUs JonEs,
| that we should go
ºf 5 to a Christmas
Pantomime toge-
ther, and being
º accommodated by
# the obliging pro-
prietors of Covent
suº Garden Theatre
tº with a private box
for last Tuesday, I
invited not only
= him but someother
young friends to be
present at the en-
tertainment. The
two Miss Twiggs,
- the charming
daughters of the REv. MR. Twigg, our neighbour; Miss MINNY
Twigg, their youngest sister, eight years of age; and their maternal
aunt, MRs. CAPTAIN FLATHER, as the Chaperon of the {". ladies
were the four other partakers of this amusement with myself an
MR. Jon Es.
t was tº: that the ladies, who live in Montpellier Square, Bromp-
ton, should take up myself and MASTER AUGUSTUs at the Sarcophagus
Club, which is on the way to the theatre, and where we two jº.
dined on the day appointed. Cox's most roomy fly, the mouldy green
one, in which he insists onČ. the roaring:grey horse, was engaged
for the happy evening. Only an intoxicated driver (as Cox's man
ways is) could ever, I am sure, get that animal into a trot. But the
utmost fury of the whip will not drive him into a dangerous pace; and
besides, the ladies were protected by THOMAs, MRs. FLATHER's º; a
young man with a gold band to his hat, and a large gilt knob on the top,
who ensured the safety of the cargo, and really gave the vehicle the
dignity of one's own carriage.
The dinner hour at the Sarcophagus being º: for five o'clock
and a table secured in the strangers' room, MASTER Jones was good
enough to arrive (under the guardianship of the Colonel's footman)
about half-an-hour before the appointed time, and the interval was by
him partly passed in conversation, but chiefly in looking at a large silver
watch which he possesses, and in hoping that we shouldn't be late.
I made every attempt to pacify and amuse my young guest, whée
anxiety was not about the dinner, but about the play. I tried him with
a few Tºº about Greek and Mathematics—a sort of talk, however,
which I was obliged speedily to abandon, for I found he knew a great
deal more upon these subjects than I did—(it is disgusting how preter-
naturally learned the boys of our day are, by the way). I engaged him
to relate anecdotes about his schoolfellows and ushers, which he did,
but still in a hurried, agitated, nervous manner—evidently thinking
about that sole absorbing subject, the pantomime.
A neat little dinner, served in BATIFoL’s best manner (our chef at
the Sarcophagus knows when he has to deal with a connoisseur, and
would, as soon serve me up his own ears, as a "...ſ. dish), made
scarcely any impression on young Jones. After a couple of spoonfuls,
he pushed away the Palestine soup, and took out his large silver watch
—he applied two or three times to, the chronometer during the fish
É. it was not until I had him employed upon an omelette,
ull of apricot jam, that the young gentleman was decently tranquil.
With the last mouthful of the omelette he began to fidget again;
and it still wanted a quarter of an hour of six. Nuts, almonds and
raisins, figs (the almost never-failing soother of youth), f hoped might
eep him quiet, and laid before him all those delicacies. But he beat
the devil's tattoo with the nutcrackers, had out the watch time after
time, declared that it stopped, and made such a ceaseless kicking on
the legs of his chair, that there were moments when I wished he was
back in the parlour of MRs. Jones, his Mamma.
I know oldsters who have a savage, pleasure in making boys drunk-
A horrid thought of this kind may perhaps have crossed my mind. “If
I could get him to drink half-a-dozen glasses of that ñº Port, it
might soothe him and make him sleep,” I may have thought. But, he
would only take a couple, of glasses of wine. He said he didn't like
more; that his father did not wish him to take more: and, abashed
by his frank and honest demeanour, I would not press him, of course, a
single moment further, and so was forced to take the bottle to myself, to
soothe me instead of my young guest.
He was almost frantic at a quarter to seven, by which time the
ladies had agreed to call for us, and for about five minutes was perfectl
dangerous. “We shall be late, I know we shall; I said we should!
am sure it's seven, past, and that the box will be taken!” and countless
other exclamations of fear, and impatience passed through his mind.
At length we heard a carriage stop, and a club-servant entering and
directing himself towards our table. Young Jones did not want to
hear him speak, but cried out—“Hooray, here they are!” flun
napkin over his head, dashed off his chair, sprang at his hat like a
kitten at a ball, and bounced out of the door, crying out, “Come along,
MR. SPEck!” whilst the individual addressed much more deliberately
followed. “Happy AUGUSTUs!” I ºntº exclaimed., “O thou
brisk and bounding yotary of pleasure! hen the virile toga has
given place to the jacket and turned-down collar, that Columbine, who
will float before you a goddess to-night,
will only be a third-rate dancing female, with rouge, and large feet.
You will see the ropes by which the genii come down, and the dirty,
crumpled knees of the fairies—and you won't be in such a hurry to
leave a good bottle of.port, as now at the pleasant . of thirteen.”
—[By the way, boys are made so abominably comfortable and odiously
º now-a-days, that when I look back to 1802, and my own
youth, I get in a rage with the whole, race, of boys, and feel in-
clined to flog them all round.]—Paying the bill, I . and making
these leisurely observations, I passed under the haſ' of the Šar.
cophagus, where Thomas, the page, touched the gold-knobbed hat
respectfully to me, in a manner which I think must have rather sur-
F. old GENERAL GRowLER, who was *...f himself of his muf.
etees and wrappers, and issued into the street, where. Cox's fly was in
waiting: the windows up, and whitened with a slight frost: the silhou-
ettes of the dear beings within dimly visible against the chemist's light
º: the Club; and MASTER AUGUSTUs already kicking his heels on
the box, by the side of the inebriated driver.
I caused the youth to descend from that perch, and the door of the
fly ...; opened, thrust him in. . CAPTAIN FLATHER of course
occupied the place of honour—an uncommonly capacious woman,—and
one of the young ladies made a retreat from the front seat, in order to
leave it vacant for myself; but I insisted on not, incommoding, MRs.
CAPTAIN F., and that the two darling children should sit beside her,
1. I occupied the place of back i. between the two Miss
WIGGS.
They were attired in white, covered up with shawls, with bouquets
in their laps, and their hair dressed evidently for the occasion: }.
FLATHER in her red velvet, of course, with her large gilt state turban."
She saw that we were squeezed on our side of the carriage, and made
an offer to receive me on hers.

mischievous little black eyed" creatures, who would dislike being
squeezed by you? I wished it was to York we were going, and not
to Covent Garden. How º the moments passed. We were at
the play-house in no time: and AUGUSTUs plunged instantly out of the
fly over the shins of everybody. SPEC.

12 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PLEASANT COUNTRY.
IN the absence of any more efficient measure for the protection of
life, the guardians of the poor of Ireland, who have been special marks
for the assassin on their way to the performance of their duties have
resorted to their kitchen implements to provide the means of defence
for their hazardous journey. Being deprived of all ordinary arms, they
are compelled to encase themselves as they best can in their batterie
de cuisine, to protect themselves against the murderous assault and
battery to which they are forced to expose themselves. The various
items in a cooking apparatus are thus turned to excellent account;
for the gridiron makes an admirable yisor, the saucepan a most effective
helmet, the dripping-pan an admirable shield, and the spit a spear in
which lightness and power are blended very happily.
We do not know that stalwart knights ever basted each other with
basting-spoons at joust or tournament, but we are sure that in the olden
time they have frequently entered the list in caparisons, which we
might fairly liken to kitchen furniture, if it were not for the recol-
lection that such caparisons are odious. The philanthropic attempt to
enlighten the Irish on agriculture will probably be carried out with more
success than has hitherto attended if, if the lecturers are armed cap-
à-pied, in the style which the annexed engraving illustrates.
The acquisition of knowledge. under difficulties has been frequently
recognised as a very laudable achievement, but its diffusion under
difficulties is being just now exemplified in Ireland in a most remark-
able manner. To convey scientific information with bullets whizzin
in one's ear requires a degree of courage which is not often exhibite
in England; our lecturers, seldom have anything more formidable to
withstand than a little ridicule or a few cabbage-leaves; but against
even these the British diffusers of knowledge will be protected by
the authorities. In Ireland, the well-meaning communicants of agri-
cultural information may almost as well walk into a shooting gallery,
and seat themselves before the target during a busy day's practice, as
}. themselves to the notice of the peasantry in the character of
ecturers. We throw out the hint, that they should at all events take the
precaution of being armed, from top to toe in case of accidents, which
it seems will happen in Ireland even in the best regulated districts.
THE TEMPLE EARTHQUAKE.
If a French fleet is, about to sail, up to London, as some say it is,
and if the Temple is to be taken, it will assuredly be well shaken first,
unless something is done to stop the explosive experiments that are
now proceeding on the river, e understand from MR. BRIEFLEss
that he was sitting the other day in his chambers, when he was alarmed
by an extraordinary motion—not by any means a motion of course—
that almost knocked him off his legs, instead of bringing him on to
them, The learned gentleman, who was trying to digest a de injurid
that had just come in, expected to see the injuria demonstrated at once
in the downfall of his entire domicile; and he was waiting for the
general issue in the * of a regular smash, when happily an abate-
ment was perceptible. His clerk was instantly despatched to look into
this alarming case of battery, but upon inquiring of the porters, who
make their own rule absolute in the Temple, there was no cause shown.
It was subsequently ascertained that a trial was going on against a
bank for the removal of some deposits, but as the damages w
probably fall on the inhabitants of the Temple, MR. BRIEFLEss has in-
structed himself to move on the first day of Term, that if this action is
continued, the venue may be instantly changed. A gentleman writing
to the Times kindly recommends the keeping of the doors and windows
all open, for the purpose of weakening the effect of any further explosion.
This advice ...'. reasonable enough in summer, but few barristers
would be anxious for so many drafts to settle as will ". in upon them
just now, if doors and windows are kept open until the experiments
Cease. ,
THE DEAN AND DR. HAMPIDEN.
TheRE was an old Dean in the West country,
A cause of offence his Rev'rence had found;
'Twas all about filling a vacant see,
Upon what he consider'd was his own ground
ith his plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay.
His Deanship resolved the QUEEN to sue,
For what he considered his rightful due;
Likewise to beg her favour and grace,
hopes she would give him the vacant ºf
With his plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay.
The QUEEN his petition did refer
To Lord John Russell, her Pre-mi-er;
But Lord John Russell, said, “I’ve in view
Another, my very good friend, than you-
With your plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay.”
“Is it that Doctor whom you mean
To make a Bishop of ?” cries the Dean;
“There lives a person—I won't say where—
More fit for a Bishop than that chap there
With his plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay.” .
Thereon the Dean whipp'd out his pen,
And sent the QUEEN a letter again,
Imputing error and heresy
To Lord JoHN's Bishop that was to be
With his plural rural cure a-lural urailural lay.
Against that choice he did protest;
But HER MAJESTY thought that John knew best;
For his mitre and crosier she left him to whistle,
And gave him no answer to his epistle,
With his plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay,
To Lord John Russell then he wrote,
And bade him to take heed and note
That he purposed, without hesitation or fear,
* 9Whiº MAJESTY's congé d'élire
ith his plural rural cure a-lural urallural lay.
To him replied the Minister—
“I have received your letter, Sir,
In which your intention you intimate
The law of the land to violate,
With your plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay.”
So now the Dean had pledged his word
To do a thing that was quite absurd;
And when the election-day came on,
He recorded his vote 'gainst the man of LoRD JoHN,
With his plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay.
But there he stopp'd-the wisest way—
And Lord JoHN's Bishop gain'd the day:
And though with the Chapter he disagreed,
The Dean set his hand and his seal to their deed,
With his plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay.
And so the Dean has preserved his stall,
His goods and chattels, and livings, and all;
Of a praemunire he’s out of fear,
And we wish him sincerely a happy new year,
With his plural rural cure a-lural ural lural lay.
OUR PRIZE CONUNDRUM FOR CHRISTMAS.
Q. IN what way does the appointment of DR. Musgrave to the
Archbishoprick of York bear a striking resemblance to most of our
modern farces?
4. In the fact of its being a mere translation.

THE FRENCH AT BRIGHTON.
OLLY MR. PUNCH,
“As a lone woman,
Sir, I write to you about
our Natural Defences.
I’ve been reading the
Susser Advertiser, and
a Brighton, it seems, is in a
pretty state of déshahille,
and may be surprised any
morning—as one may say
—with its hair in papers,
afore the town knows
where it is.
“The place is ruined,
Mr. Punch ; lodgers not
coming here, as thinking
themselves double haz-
ardous. For is it to be
believed, Sir, that married
men with families will let
their wives and children
come down when—at no
notice at all—the town
may be boarded by the
French fleet, and scream-
ing women and children be
carried off in gigs and
jolly-boats; to say nothing
of the property?
“And yet, Mr. Punch—
as my poor dear GERKINs
used to ask, and 'specially
when he’d had a glass—
and yet, we are called
upon every day, I may say,
to pay taxes. Yes, Sir, we
are made to º window-lights, when, at any minute, our sashes may be blown to mince-meat
by the cannon-balls of the French As GERKINs would have said, is this honest of HER
MAJESTY's Ministers?
“If ever there was a town that had its weakness—and that weakness known to the French
-it is this precious Brighton. Of course. Why, I myself—never minding what I thought
the nonsense of natºral enemies, so as they paid their way—I have let my first and second floor
to French families, that now I’m sure of it, only took 'em for spies. Yes, Sir; I've no
doubt that Periwinkle Willa, Marine Parade—that’s my house, Sir, and painted from top to
toe only last May—is known to all the French. There isn't a French soldier (I’ll be bound)
that doesn't know where to put his hand upon the plate-basket—not a man among 'em but
wouldn't, in the dark, find his way to the beer-cellar. (Not but what I shall take precious
good care, to disappoint ’em.)
“And this is the case with every other house in the place. We are known, inside and out.
We hayen't a garret hid from 'em. They may cut us up, and share us out like cakes.
“Thinking of this, I put on my bonnet and victorine, and went out to take a good look of the
town. When I saw that we'd only a handful of guns at West Street, and not so much as a
pºcket pistol at Seaford Bay, I said to myself-What's to prevent the French coming here
whenever they like * Why—I’m certain of it—when the moon didn’t shine, they might
come over, and let themselves into all the town with latch-keys; for it isn’t likely—so many
lodgers as there have been here—that they went away without taking false ones.
“I am not a timid woman, Mr. Punch–poor GERKINs would always allow that much of me;
-but upon my word and honour I do assure you, when I saw myself standing on the Marine
Parade with not a gun—no, not a single piece of cold iron, as the words go-between me and
France, I did tremble for Brighton; I did tremble for my QUEEN & h HER MAJESTY
Åas left us for the Isle of Wight); and I did tremble for PRINCE ALBERT and the rest of the
Royal Family.
“I do hope, Mr. Punch, that ". will write directly to Rear-Admiral LoRD John Russell— Co
(who, I have somewhere heard, once did, such wonders when he commanded the Channel
Fleet)—and beg of him to send two or three hundred ships always to lie between us and
the French. The wooden walls, Sir–as poor GERKINs used to say—the true hearts of oak
hat grow the laurel ! And moreover, I do think, if Government would only send down MR.
T. P. CookE to dance twice a-night the sailor's College Hornpipe, it would do a great deal of
good to public spirit. - - -
“However, at least I do trust that you will insist upon the heads and branches of families
all going into the Militia. Not that I hope we shall have any use for them—'specially with
the hearts of oak beating in the sea—but there is always this beauty about soldiers; when
they're not useful, they’re very nice to look at. - -
“Once I used to think there was a sort of F. about the Royal liveries, that now
and then flamed in and out of the Pavilion. To be sure—poor things!—they rather looked
like the ghosts of footmen on board wages, than the stout rosy fellows that, when George
THE FourTH used to bathe here, made the place so gay and handsome. Well, Sir, now they
are .. It was a sad sight, but only yesterday the last footman (with a carpet-bag marked
in faded worsted, ‘G.R.') took his long leave of Brighton by the second train.
“And there’s the Pavilion, as empty and good-for-nothing as a shell that’s held an addled
egg! What should be done, with that, Sir P Why, I’ll tell you. It should be worked with
loop-holes over and over, and be filled from top to bottom with brass cannons. If brass can't
be got, let 'em, without owning it, try wood, as
better matching the building.
“And moreover, Sir, as it’s the dull season, I
do think—especially as the Court’s left us—that
Government might take all the lodging-houses
(the barracks not holding 'em) for º soldiers.
First and second floor for officers—third, for
inen.
“Struck by this happy thought, I send you
my card of terms. Ten guineas first floor,
seven the second. Plate and linen found.
(Boots not included.) Address post-paid, and
believe me,
“Your obedient servant,
“MARY GERKINs.”
“P. S. As at such a time England—as poor
GERKINs used to say—expects every woman to
do her duty, I shall have no objection (for an
extra three pounds) to mount two cannons at
my attic windows, if warranted not to be fired.”
FINE ARTS.
The Stag at Bay.
This is a fine historical picture, and will
serve to embalm, the recollection of a most
eventſul period of English history. We rarely
criticise Art; but this is a work that compels us
to be fervid—eloquent. . The Stag is finely
handled; his look reveals the history of his
Woes. e stands at the very edge of the
London Wharf, and the Boulogne steamer—with
CAPTAIN TUNE on the paddle-box—like a placid
swan, is striking its first paddle-strokes. The
Stag carries a carpet-bag in one hand, and in
the other an uplifted stick, menacing his assail-
ants, “the dogs of Law” let slip from Fetter
Lane. Another moment, and the Stag would
have leapt on the deck of the moving steamer;
but the dogs, are closing upon him, and it is
º that—albeit his carpet-bag is in his hand,
his portmanteau with “its leathern coat swollen
almost to bursting” at his foot—the Stag is
“caught and bled.”
This noble picture of The Stag at Bay is one of
those rare and perfect pieces of Art whose
triumph it is to set to work the imagination of
the beholder. ...For instance, the painter only
shows us, the “immediate now,”—but our fancy
follows the poor Stag to his doom—we see him
enter the hackney-cab with MR. SHADRACH and
friend—London becomes a moving panorama—
Cheapside, Fleet Street, pass before us—and—
and-and-the key is turned; the Stag sleeps
beneath the roof of the town-house of SHADRAch.
The Classics and the Commons.
We observe that Members of the House of
mmons very frequently make use of Latin
quotations, most of which are an evidence of an
education at Eton, since they are to be found
among the examples in the celebrated Grammar
in use at that seminary. It is curious that mone
of those honourable gentlemen ever, by any
chance quote Greek; whence one might almost
be inclined to suspect that they are more
honourable than learned. ... We are sure that the
mighty line of HomeR (beginning with Töv 8'
ānaueiðéuevos) sonorously enunciated, would be
received with the greatest §. by the
House..., SIR Robert PEEL, had really better
try a little Greek, particularly as he seems to
have worn out all his Latin. By the by, in
testimony of the liberal views, if not of the
liberal education, of the British Parliament, we
expect very shortly to hear a little, Hebrew, as
well as Greek and Latin, occasionally quoted in
that august assembly.

and, considering the violence of his
martyrdom, is quite as well as could be
expected.
The Doctor took breakfast with almost
his usual appetite; and having expressed
some surprise that the sun still shone
upon Hereford—and having been as-
sured by his butler that the Cathedral
had not yet disappeared down the jaws
of an earthquake—consented to see a
few friends to dinner.
The Doctor dined quite like a man
who feels that, after all is said, dinners
are not to be despised even by martyrs.
In the evening, the old English fes-
tivity of drawing for Twelfth-Cake was
celebrated; at which the Doctor conde-
scended with the most affable manner to
assist. Unhappily, in drawing the charac-
ters, the Doctor drew a Bishop. This
aggravated the symptoms of the patient
for a time; but nevertheless, upon the
whole, the Martyr may be pronounced
nearly out of danger.
ABD-EL-KADER AT TOULON ;
OR, THE CAGED HAWK.
No more, thou lithe and long-winged hawk, of desert-life for thee;
No more across the sultry sands shalt thou go swooping free:
Blunt idle talons, idle beak, with spurning of thy chain, - -
Shatter against thy cage the wing thou ne'er mayst spread again.
Long, sitting by their watchfires, shall the Kabyles tell the tale
Of thy dash from Ben Halifa on the fat Metidja vale;
How thou swept'st the desert over, bearing down the wild El Riff,
From eastern #: Salah to western Ouad Shelif;
How thy white burnous went streaming, like the storm-rack o'er the sea,
When thou rodest in the vanward of the Moorish chivalry;
How thy razzia was a whirlwind, thy onset a simoom, [gloom
How thy sword-sweep was the lightning, dealing death from out the
Nor less quick to slay in battle than in peace to spare and save,
f brave men wisest councillor, of wise councillors most brave;
How the eye that flashed destruction could beam gentleness and love,
How lion in thee mated lamb, how eagle mated dovel
Availéd not or steel or shot 'gainst that charmed life secure,
Till cunning France, in last resource, tossed up the golden lure:
And the carrion buzzards round him stooped, faithless, to the cast,
And the wild hawk of the desert is caught and caged at last.
Weep, maidens of Zerifah, above the laden loom!
Scar, chieftains of Al Elmah, your cheeks in grief and gloom!
Sons of the Beni Snazam, throw down the useless lance,
And stoopyour necksandbare your backstoyoke and scourge of France!
‘Twas not in fight they bore him down; he never cried amān;
He never sunk his sword before the PRINCE or FRANGHistAN;
But with traitors all around him, his star upon the wane,
He heard the voice of ALLAh, and he would not strive in vain.
They gave him what he asked them; from king to king he spake,
As one that plighted word and seal not knoweth how to break:
“Let me pass from out my deserts, be’t mine own choice where to
I brook no fettered life to live, a captive and a show.”
And they promised, and he trusted them, and proud and calm he came,
Upon his black mare riding, girt with his sword of fame.
Good steed, good sword, he rendered both unto the Frankish throng;
He knew them false and fickle-but a Prince's word is strong.
How have they kept their promise º Turned they the vessel's prow
Unto Acre, Alexandria, as they have sworn e'en now *
Not so: from Oran northwards the white sails gleam and glance,
And the wild hawk of the desert is borne away to France!
Where Toulon's white-walled lazaret looks southward o'er the wave,
Sits he that trusted in the word a son of Louis gave. .
Oh, noble faith of noble heart | And was the warning val
go,
|
n
They have need of thee to gaze on, they have need of thee to grace
The triumph of the Prince, to gild the pinchbeck of their race.
Words are but wind, conditions must be construed by GUIzot;
Dash out thy heart, thou desert hawk, ere thou art made a show !
INWASION SMALL-TALK.
THE Duke's gunpowder letter has had a remarkable effectupon certain
g. dinner parties. The orators have talked nothing but great guns.
| Some of the Conservatives at Ashton-under-Lyne—like Catherine-wheels
were all whiz, fire, and smoke. A MR. WILDE, in the very handsomest
manner, invented a campaign, a battle, and a victory, for our gentle
QUEEN Victoria, who would read the French a lesson
“similar to that read by QUEEN ELIZABETH; and he doubted not that the Queen
would, if needs be, place herself, like her illustrious ancestor, at the head of her armies,
and lead them not only to battle but to victory.” (Cheers.)
It being an historical fact, that QUEEN ELIZABETH, in prophetic
cocked-hat and epaulets, fought as post-captain on board the Royal
Harry, and took a Spanish three-decker. The circumstance has been
most negligently omitted from every Naval History; but MR. WILDE
has, we are assured, the identical Elizabethan cocked-hat and epaulets
wrapt up in a Morning Herald of the day. And should the French
threaten us, there can be no doubt that our QUEEN, “like her illustrious
ancestor,” will lead the crew of the Pictoria and Albert “not only to
battle but to victory.”
We moreover receive much comfort from Oldham; for there MR.
JAMEs LEEs, proposing “LoRD STANLEY and the House of Peers, the
great bulwark of British Liberty,” denominated his Lordship “as a
national breakwater to enable us to ride through the storm in safety.”
What a fine Harlequinade touch, and how it smacks of the season, when
alive peer can be turned into a breakwater! This is really to put the
House of Lords to an unexpected use. In case of a threatened invasion,
i. º not wonder to see LoRD BRough AM supersede the Buoy at

Firelocks and Free-Trade.
We have now before the Public two great schemes, proposed by two
great men, for the defence of our country. The DUKE of WELLINGTON
recommends us to call out the Militia, and increase the standing army;
MR. Cobden would have us put our trust in the extension of Free
Trade. According to the Duke's plan, the French will, find us ugly
customers; according to that of MR. CoBDEN, profitable ones: in
either of which cases it will not pay them to quarrel with us. For our
rotection, the Field-Marshal says, there is nothing like bayonets; the
ree Trader, nothing like business; whilst both seem to be of opinion
that there is nothing like leather. To disarm the French is cheaper,
and looks less suspicious, than to arm ourselves: we hope, therefore, a

fair trial will be given to the more pacific suggestion.

ART AS APPLIED TO TWELFTH-CAKES.
WHILE High Art is being lavished on almost every object, however
insignificant, we regretto find that the Twelfth-Cake is still left to the
rude barbarism of former ages for its decorations. Some of the speci-
mens in Plaster of Paris that we have observed during the present
season, are in the same primitive School of Art that we noticed in our
days of juvenility; according to the artists employed in this branch
of decoration, three of whose
drawings in chalk are now before
us. We are struck by the
ertinacity with which they ad-
É. to He old notion that the
human foot is sometimes capable
of carrying about with it a small
patch of turf as a pedestal, and
that a Shepherd, or MR. Pick-
wick, can stand in what may be
called a slantendicular position
without falling to the ground.
The Twelfth-Cakeian notions of
Royalty are always rather eccen-
tric, and the general impression
among the chalk and sugar
artists is, that Majesty is huddled
together all of a lump in a man-
ner far more clumsy than digni-
fied. We beg leave to call the
attention of Royal Academicians - - -
to this subject; and indeed, if the Fine Arts Commissioners will only
offer a reward for the best set of Twelfth Cake ornaments, we are
sure that a wonderful effect would be produced.
Punch's Court Circular.
YESTERDAY, (the 6th inst.), His Royal HighNess THE DUKE or
CAMBRIDGE, wearing his General's uniform, the Garter, Blue Ribbon,
&c., &c., inspected the Royal Twelfth-Cake, and was pleased to express
himself highly delighted with its taste and greatness., A Chinese
family, made in the very best sugar, and comprising the father, a
Mandarin of the first class, his wife and six children, was honoured
with special marks of His Royal Highness's attention. Chinese golden
pheasants—bodies and tails in the brightest sugar-candy—afforded great
delight to the distinguished amateur; and gold and silver fish, intro-
duced in a crystal vase into the body of the cake, and swimming in
Champagne, were honoured with the most condescending approbation.
A barrel-organ, concealed under sugar rockwork raised about the cake,
at an auspicious moment struck up—“Hall, Star of Brunswick!” His
Royal Highness expressed himself highly flattered by the delicacy of
the compliment. On the whole, the noble Duke observed, that
although he had presided at many annual distributions of prizes of the
Art Union; nothing in the shape of Art had ever so inwardly touched
him as the Twelfth-Cake. The Royal Duke afterwards inspected the
Royal mince-pies and snap-dragon bowl, and pronounced them perfect.
THE Boy's Own Book.-Amongst the new books for the holydays
has been advertised a tale by HANs CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN, called
“A Dream of Little Tuk.” The title of this work sounds inſelicitously.
A “Dream of Much Tuck” would be infinitely more calculated to
interest young gentlemen who are home for the holydays.
M. R. D UN U P'S FAILURE.
.THE last scene of this melancholy drama is about to be acted, and a
piece of ragged stair-carpet depending from MR. DUNUP's chambers,
announces the distressing fact that the dénouement is close at hand.
We must, however, give MR. DUNUP credit—not in a pecuniary sense,
for that would be madness indeed—but we must give him credit for
ingenuity in the drawing up of a bill (he was always famous in this
line) with a view to the sale by auction of his effects. The following is
a copy of this interesting composition—the only composition, by the
way, that MR. DUNUP has offered to his creditors:—
IMPORTANT SALE.
The recent monetary derangement having involved in its ruinous effects
several firms and infirms of the highest character, it has been found
necessary, in pursuance of the
ORDER OF THE COURT
of Requests, tomake arrangements with some other eminent Auctioneer
and Estate Agent, in consequence of the refusal of
MR. Fr.EDERICK CHINNOCK
to Sell by Auction the whole of the Costly Effects of BLANK DUNUP,
Esquire. It cannot be said that the
Property will include Bijouterie and Marqueterie,
but it will comprise a choice selection of Boot-jackerie and Gim-crackery
of the rarest kind, which has been got together
REGARDLESS OF Expense
to his numerous creditors. One of the most interesting features of the
Sale will be MR. DUNUP's
UNIQUE STUD,
worn in the centre of his shirt; and there will also be submitted to
public competition his unrivalled Towel and
OTHER HORSES,
including his well-known light, graceful, and serviceable
AIRING-HORSE,
which must be seen to be appreciated. The Auctioneer is happy to be
enabled also to announce, that to him has been confided the task of
disposing of the
Splendid Service, Comprising 300 Ounces,
OF PLATEs,
Chiefly of the favourite Willow pattern, together with
A SMALL BUT SELECT CELLAR,
Containing nearly 500
of Coals. The articles of the toilet will be included in the Sale, and
the Auctioneer calls the attention of the Public with much confidence to
(among other Lots) a
Grand Square of Windsor
Soap; while the personal Jewellery of MR. DUNUP, consisting chiefly of
CURIOUS SPECIMENS OF Mosaic,
will be brought under the hammer, without the smallest reserve. It
would be impossible within the limits of a posting-bill to describe the
various other interesting lots, but it will be sufficient to intimate that
a dinner
WAGON
will be among the articles to be disposed of; as well as an excellent pair of
Railway
Trowsers; besides a warm second-hand pea-jacket, and three waistcoats,
which will immediately confer on the purchaser a
WESTED INTEREST.
Further Particulars and Catalogues to be had of the Auctioneer; or at
MR. DUNUP's Chambers, where the effects may be viewed.
Please Observe the Address I
AMONGST the many, addresses which were presented to Louis-
PHILIPPE on New Year's Day, the most welcome one to him was the
following:—
“ABD-EL-KADER, Toulon.”
The Emir had just been landed at Toulon, on his way to Alexandria.
We suppose this new address, which has taken the French army so
many years to ascertain, will be published in red letters, in the next
edition of the Almanack des 25 Mille Adresses.

THE BAR–ITS RAGGED SCHOOL.
It gives us great pleasure to inform our readers that the frightful moral
destitution of the Bar has at length awakened the attention of philanthropists,
who, it may be almost objected against them, have suffered their sympathies to
run somewhat to waste amongst forlorn shirt-makers, at sevenpence a day;
and ragged scholars, the human refuse of lanes and courts; when a body of
individuals of the very first importance—as they themselves are not backward
to declare, to our social condition—are in the most benighted state of ignorance
and darkness. We allude to the Bar of England. It is not necessary for us
here to recapitulate the harrowing instances of moral destitution that, within a
very short period, have forced themselves upon the condemnation of the simple
world at large. They have, however, at length awakened the º:
mind of the country; and a nobleman, distinguished for his benevolence, has
called about him a band of sympathetic brethren determined upon carrying
reformation among a body of individuals, many of whom are at times jocosely
called “gentlemen” of the long robe.
His Lordship's address on the first meeting of the Society was listened to
with mingled astonishment and grief. He dwelt eloquently, and at great length
on the moral darkness and obliquity of even distinguished wearers of silk and
horse-hair. His Lordship asked the meeting what they would say of a man, not
protected by gown and wig, who, knowing that blood was on the hands of the
assassin, should, for so much money (and, if any money could be called “blood-
money,” surely it was pelſ so acquired), endeavour to save the guilty by sacri.
| ficing the innocent? e further asked, what could be thought of the sense of
honour of an advocate, who, having for years pocketed the fees for a plaintiff,
afterwards used the information so acquired as a double-loaded gun, where-
with, on the side of the defendant, to kill the cause of his first employer? (Cries
of “Shame.”) His Lordship then dwelt upon a degrading superstition that had
long obtained among gentlemen of the bar; namely, a belief that, having once
secured a fee, they were not called upon to return it, should they have no time
to work for it.
Several resolutions were agreed to, and premises have, we hear, been taken
in the neighbourhood of Westminster Hall, !. the instruction of the destitute.
The institution may be aptly called, “The Ragged Moral School of the Bar.” It
1s º unlikely that we º attend, and report the examination of some of the
pupils.
“Taken in, and Dome for.”
THE fortifications are sprouting everywhere around Paris,
There will be a splendid harvest of guns and cannons before
the whole º razed. The Park of St. Cloud is budding
with forts. We can only imagine one use for them. It has
taken Louis-PHILIPPE ten years and a hundred million francs
to catch ABD-El-KADER, and now that he has caught him,
he is determined not to lose him. The poor Emir is to
be taken to Paris, and the fortifications are to be pushed for-
ward as rapidly as possible to prevent his escape. We are
afraid there is no hope for ABD-BI-KADER, especially as Louis-
PhILIPPE is trying everything he can to make him sign a
treaty of entente cordiale.

other day, who positively asserted that he had not had an

of that instrument and the wrath of the owner; indeed, I have no
doubt, that had not MRs, FLATHER reflected that Mas Colonel Jones
gave some of the most, elegant parties in London, to which she was
very anxious to be invited, she would have boxed MASTER AUGUSTUs's
ears in the presence of the whole audience of Covent Garden.
One of the young ladies was, of course, obliged to remain in the back
row with MR. SPEc. We could not see much of the play over MRs. F.'s
turban; but I trust that we were not unhappy in our retired position.
O Miss EMILY! O Miss Louisal there is one who would be happy to
sit for a week close by either of you, though it were on one of those
abominable little private-box chairs. I know, for my part, that every
time the box-keeperess popped in her head, and asked if we would take
any refreshment, I ºf: the interruption odious.
Our young ladies, and their stout chaperon and aunt, had come pro-
vided with near little bouquets of flowers, in which they evidently took
a considerable pride, and which were laid, on their first entrance, on the
ledge in front of our box. -- -
But, presently, on the opposite side of the house, MRs. CUTBUSH, of
Pocklington Gardens, appeared with her daughters, and bowed in a
atronising manner to the ladies of our party, with whom the Čurpus,
amily has a slight acquaintance.
Before ten minutes, the bouquets of our party were whisked away
from the ledge of the box. MRs. FLATHER dropped hers to the ground,
where MASTER JONES's feet speedily finished it; Miss Louis A Twigg
let hers fall into her lap and covered it with her pocket-handkerchief.
Uneasy signals passed between her and her sister. "I could not, at first,
understand what event had occurred to make these ladies so º
At last the secret came out. The Misses CUTBUSH had bouquets like
little haystacks before them, Our small nosegays, which had quite satis-
fied the girls until now, had become odious in their little jealous eyes;
and the CUTBUSHEs triumphed over them.
I have joked the ladies subsequently on this adventure; but not one
of them will acknowledge the charge against them. It was mere acci-
dent that made them drop the flowers—pure accident. They jealous of
the CUTBUSHEs—not they indeed! and, of course, each person on this
head is welcome to his own opinion.
How different, meanwhile, was the behaviour of my young friend
MASTER Jones,who is not as yet º icated by the world. He not only
nodded to his father's servant, who had taken, a place in the pit, and
was to escort his young master home, but he discovered a schoolfellow
in the pit likewise. “By Jove, there’s SMITH !” he cried out, as if the
sight of SMITH was the most extraordinary event in the world. He
pointed out SMITH to all of us. He never ceased nodding, winking,
grinning, telegraphing, until he had succeeded in attracting the attention
not only of MASTER SMITH, but of the greater part of the house; and
whenever anything in the play struck him as worthy of applause, he
instantly made signals to SMITH below, and shook his fist at him, as
much as to º “By Jove, old fellow, ain't it good? I say, SMITH,
isn't it prime, old boy?” He actually made remarks on his fingers to

brave little boy, thought I, in my heart; twenty years hence you will
recollect this, and have forgotten many a better thing... You will have
been in love twice or thrice by that time, and forgotten it; you will
have buried your wife and forgotten her: you will have had ever so
many friendships and forgotten them. You and SMITH won't care for
each other, very probably; but you’ll remember all the actors, and the
plot of this piece we are seeing.
I protest I have forgotten it myself. In our back row we could not
see or hear much of the performance (and no great loss)—fitful bursts
of elocution only occasionally reaching us, in which we could recognise
the well-known nasal twang of the excellent MR. STUPoR, who per-
formed the part of the young hero; or the ringing laughter of -
BELMoRE, who had to giggle through the whole piece.
It was one of MR. BoystER's Comedies of English life. FRANK
NIGHTRAKE (Stupor), and his friend, BoB FITzoFFLEY, appeared in the
first scene, having a conversation with that impossible § et of English
Comedy, whom any gentleman would turn out of doors before he could
get through half a length of the dialogue assigned. I caught only a
glimpse of this Act. BoB, like a fashionable young dog of the aristo-
cracy (the character was played by BULGER, a meritorious man, but
very stout, and nearly, fifty years of age), was dressed in a rhubarb-
coloured body-coat with brass buttons, a º of under waistcoats, a
blue satin stock with a paste brooch in it, and an eighteenpenny cane,
which he never let out of his hand, and with which he poked fun at
everybody. FRANK NIGHTRAKE, on the contrary, being at home, was
attired in a very close-fitting chintz dressing-gown, lined with glazed
red calico, and was seated before, a large pewter teapot, at breakfast.
And, as your true English Comedy is the representation of Nature, I
could not but think how like these figures on the stage, and the dia-
logue which they used, were to the appearance and talk of English
gentlemen of the present day.
The dialogue went on somewhat in the following fashion:—
Bob Fitzoffley (enters whistling). The top of the morning to thee,
FRANK What! at breakfast already? At chocolate and the Morning
Post, like a dowager of sixty? SLANG! (he pokes the servant with his
cane) What has come to thy master, thou Prince of Walets! thou

Herewith SLANG takes the lead of the conversation, and propounds a
lot for running away with the heiress; and I could not help remarking
#. like the comedy was to life—how the gentlemen always say
“thou,” and “prythee,”, and “go to,” and talk about Heathen
goddesses, to each other; how their servants are always their parti-
cular intimates; how, when there is serious love-making between a
gentleman and lady, a comic attachment invariably springs up between
the valet and waiting-maid of each; how LADY GRACE GADABOUT,
when she calls upon Rose RINGDove to pay a morning visit, appears
in a low satin dress, with jewels in her hair; how SAUCEbox, her attend-
ant, wears diamond brooches, and rings on all her fingers: while MRs.
TALLYHo, on the other hand, transacts all the business of life in a
riding habit, and always points her jokes by a cut of the whip.
This playfulness produced a roar all over the house, whenever it was
º and always made our little friends clap their hands and shout
In chorus.
Like that bon-vivant who envied the beggars staring into the cook-
shop windows, and wished he could be hungry, I envied the boys, and
... I could laugh, very much. In the last Act, I remember—for it
is now very nearly a week ago—everybody took refuge either in a
secret door, or behind a screen or curtain, or under a table, or up a
chimney; and the house roared as each person came out from his place
of concealment. And the old fellow in top-boots, joining the hands of
the young couple, (FITz-OFFLEY, of course, ºr with the widow,)
gave them i. and thirty thousand pounds.
And ah, ye gods! if I wished before, that Comedies were like life,
how I wished that life was like Comedies! Whereon, the drop fell;
and AUGUSTUs, clapping to the opera-glass, jumped up, crying-
“Hurray ! now for the Pantomime.” SPEC.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR. BRIEFLESS.
CHAPTER THE SECOND.
The CHOICE OF A PROFESSION.
THE choice of a professionis in most cases more nominal than real; for
I doubt if aparent who asks a son “What he should like to be?” attaches
any greatimportance to the answer of the juvenile. , If, for instance, the
latter, should express a wish to “start, as a banker,” it is not at all
probable that the infantine whim, will be, carried out; though I re-
member, in my boyhood's days, having the impression that nothing
could be easier; for I imagined, very naturally, that a business consisting
in the receipt of other people's money would render it quite unnecessary
to have any of one's own.
I was never particularly partial to the army, for my very early days were
eatly disturbed by threats of NAPOLEoN, who was made the standing
§. to all the naughty boys at the “preparatory school for young
gentlemen from three to
i. ” in whose ranks
I had been enrolled "i
had in fact been terri-
fied into believing, that
if the victorious Cor-
sican had invaded En-
gland, his first step
would have been towards
the school-room of the
Misses TRIMMER, at
Hammersmith, where
his first cry would have
been for “MASTER
BRIEFLEss,” and his
first blow aimed at that
.# gentleman's de-
voted back. I had heard
vaguely of NAPOLEON
wishing to rule with a
rod of iron, and
thºugh; bitterly to my-
self, “That must be the
rod he is treasuring up
for Miss TRIMMER's
boys.” I was fully im-
pressed with the idea
that the eldest and
severest, Miss T. was
in confidential commu-
nication with the for-
midable N. B., who was
only waiting for orders,
and would be ready to
drop down upon Ham-
mersmith when there
should be a sufficient - - - -
number of cases of bad writing or careless spelling to justify the
infliction of that terrible retribution we were led to expect at his hands.
These reasons were quite sufficient to deter me from all thoughts of
a military career, though my head was once in danger of being turned
by an ol cocked hat belonging to my father, which had formerly been
worn by him as captain in a volunteer regiment of lawyers, which went
by the name of a certain old gentleman's Own....There was something
very attractive, by the way, in the military life of those voluntary
heroes who undertook the defence of the metropolis when the invasion
was talked about. As another seems to be on the tapis, if we are
to believe Dame Gossip and the DUKE of WELLINGTON, it may be as
well º recapitulate some of those advantages which the volunteers
enjoyed.
According to the stories of his campaigning that I have heard from
my lego-military “governor,” the fires of the metropolis were the great
scenes of action, in which he and his comrades were concerned. If
flames were to be seen issuing from a window, the volunteers were
ordered out as naturally as the pumps, and their bravery in keeping
back the crowd was rewarded by front places at any interesting confla-
grations that occurred.
My paternal cocked-hat was not the only thing that I took into my
head, or rather thrust my head into, for his forensic wig having been
once left in my way, I tried it on, and collecting the entire strength of
the domestic establishment round me, I essayed an effort of oratory
which must be considered the germ, if not the model, of all my maturer
flights of legal eloquence. I think my determination to adopt, the Bar
as my future walk, or rather hobble, in life, may be traced, to this juve-
nile rehearsal of the part of the Advocate.
§§
I know that in choosing the Bar as a profession, there are manythings
to be considered, and that many a man who might have achieved great-
ness in any other pursuit, has buried himself in ignominious obscurity by
adopting the wig and gown. The celebrated DIAvolo ANToNIo, for
instance, who has hung up his name by the tight rope in the annals of
renown, might have found business for ever slack had he selected the
ſorensic line; and by the same reason, had LoRD Eldon tried to get
his living by jumping in sacks, instead of doing his best to climb on to
one, he might have hopped through life unhonoured and own.
I know there are instances of individuals becoming advocates with.
out any of the qualities necessary to insure success; and I have
heard of one Ephorus who was positively pulled out of court by
Isocrates, who, dragging him, along, insisted on his cutting the
Bar and turning historian, for which he was more fitted. This treat-
ment I always considered indecorous in the extreme; for EPHoRus
assuredly knew his, own business better than Isocrates, who took
a very unwarrantable, liberty with his ſorensic friend. Perhaps, had
Isocrates lived in the present day, he would have rushed into one
of the Vice-Chancellor's Courts and hurried away the highly humorous
but no less learned KNIGHT BRUCE, insisting on his leaving the judicial
office to me the
editor of Joe Miller, or
any other collection of
--- jests... I accordingly re-
solved on going to the
Bar; but how I got
there, what I did there,
and how far the result
has justified my resolu:
tion, will be developed
in the course of this
Autobiography.
ROYAL DOMESTIC
ECONOMY.
OUR loyalty has lately
?) been severely outraged
by a malicious paragraph
appearing in the papers,
announcing that the
QUEEN is “having mil-
linery and flower-rooms
erected in her various
palaces, and has engaged
two first-rate French
artists, one as milliner,
and the other as florist.”
The implied object of
this arrangement is the
saving of expense, by
enabling HER MAJESTY
to have her “own mate-
rials made up” on the
premises, and thus put
into the royal pocket
the profit that the tradesman or tradeswoman would otherwise secure.
W. leave indignantly to repudiate the supposition implied in this
malicious paragraph, which we are sure can have no foundation; for it is
notorious that the QUEEN is at the head of the Society for the Relief of
the Distressed Needlewomen, and she could not therefore take any pro-
ceeding by which the earnings of that wretchedly ill-paid class would be
still further curtailed. HER MAJESTY would, we are convinced, pause
before adding a milliner's work-room to the royal establishment, when she
reflects that the example of parsimony would be immediately followed by
hundreds, who can only imitate greatness in its littleness, and are always
delighted when fashion, affords them encouragement to an act of mean-
ness., Every would-be leader of ton in her own petty and limited circle
would be aping the royal stinginess—if it were to be practised, which we
are sure i not be the case—and we should have every parvenu family
flaunting about in home-made finery, the production of a foreign artist,
kept—or, perhaps, starved—on the premises, in sycophantic and selfish
imitation of the arrangement royalty is said to contemplate.
We believe the libel to have originated in the same malevolent spirit
of detraction that accused PRINCE ALBERT of intending to add a
slaughtering-house to his personal establishment, for the §." of
chousing the butcher out of the profit to be obtained by killing the
meat. e should as soon expect to see the words, “ALBERT, MEAT-
SALESMAN,” over the door of Buckingham Palace, or “VICTORIA |
ARTISTE IN ARTIFICIAL FlowsRs,”stuck in the windows of the ground
floor, as bring ourselves to believe that the royal º contemplate the
paltry economy of entering into competition with their own trades:
people. We think it very hard on HER MAJESTY and the PRINCE, that
such reports should be sent abroad.

can assure you it is by no means the profitable concern as generally
represented, not by reason, by no means, as the Times and other influen-
tial journals says, of the ease whereby credit is given, but contrarywise,
of the difficulty we have in getting ready money or any money whatever.
It is all very well in the above journals and Oxford tutors of many
years' standing, and aggravated governors-which I cannot blame them,
having my own son Josh. very much addicted to billiards and a diffi.

and has great facilities in regard of the till,—to blame us poor tradesmen
for giving long credit, and five per cent. after two years' ditto, which I
am sure all gents must admit extremely reasonable interest; but what
can we do when young gents will live beyond their incomes, and every
tradesman anxious for custom, which small is our profits among so
many, and some unfairly prevented from going into College, which is
my own case? d if a young College gent has a taste for expensive

“DEAR old FELLow,
“HERE's been a credit row, as usual. We have one every
Term, but nothing's done, of course. As to getting rid of the credit
system, it's, all gammon—bosh, Punch. They can’t do it, and what’s
more, they don't want to. The Dons stick by the Duns, and the Duns
cap the Dons, and it’s all right. What brings men up to Oxford rather
than to Cambridge? The fact that it’s the fastest University, with
more fashionable men—more tufts—and ten “pinks” here to one at
Cambridge. This gives us our eclat, and keeps the books full. But
this sort of game can't be carried on without credit. Take my own
case. I’m a younger son, with £300 allowance. There’s a famil

tick as long as my arm at that infernal old Melchizedec's, for Claret
and Champagne. I'm allowed, in fact, to be a credit to my College.
How could, I do this on my £300 a-year? Of course I shall pay some
line or, other, for Snoozum-Parva is worth £800 a-year. eantime,
it’s credit that keeps things going at Oxford. But I maintain that our
commercial system is just the same as the London one. What did they
say in the House of Commons during the late Currency debates?—that
a man worth £10,000 capital was justified in trading to three times the
amount. I have £300 a-year, and I don’t think, taking one year with
another, I’ve spent more than £1,000, which is a mere trifle above the
London proportion of credit to capital. Don't be surprised at my
argument—I’ve not attended two courses of the Political Economy
Professor's lectures for nothing.
“Ever yours, old fellow,
“ToM TANDEM.”
… No. III.-From a Parent.
“RIDICULE is sometimes efficacious when argument fails, and
arental control is treated as a mere mockery. I have had a son at
xford whose conduct has caused me great uneasiness and considerable
expense. He had an allowance which our rector, assured me was
liberal (for I consulted him, not having myself had the advantage of a
University education); and yet, since he took his degree, I have paid
on account of his debts a sum which, in justice to the other members of
my family, I am compelled to conceal, even from my wife. My son
was considered by the head master of our Grammar School to have
remarkable classical powers. He went up with every advantage
including introductions from our excellent pastor and the reverend head
of the school where he had been educated, with the best counsels from
a superior, mother, and everything in the way of clothes, linen, and
groceries that he could possibly want during his first year of residence.
Naturally anxious that he should profit by the aristocratic connexions
to which the University gives access, Iown that it was with pride
I heard my son, on his rare visits to his home, describe his intimacy
with the noblemen and tlemen of his own and other Colleges; and
I may have listened with culpable ºl. to his account of the
amusements which he shared with such companions. I also noticed,
perhaps without reprobation, his improved and fashionable appearance;
and it was a subject of frequent remark between his mother and myself,
that he never appeared to wear any of the stock of clothes which he took
with him from home. , Willing to repose in him the most implicit con-
fidence, I never thought of asking to see his bills or his receipts. It was
not till he took his degree that I ascertained, with pain and surprise, that
his high companions had borrowed the money I gave him to pay his
College bills, ridden horses which he hired on credit, partaken of break-
fasts, dinners, and suppers which he procured in the same way, and
that his tailor's bill was of an amount equal to the expenses of my whole
housekeeping for a year. ... My heart bled; but what could I do? I
paid the bills, and now write to beg of you to interpose your aid in pro-
curing for parents some protection from this iniquitous system.
“Yours respectfully,
“THE FATHER OF A FAMILY.”
No. IV.-From the Rev. JonAs ChokER, D.D., Head of St. Chad's Hall,
Oxford.
sº SIR,
“I write to deprecate any attacks of your irreverent ridicule
on our venerable academic institutions, arising out of a recent case in
the Insolvent Court, which has furnished a fertile topic for the daring
comment of some serious journals. Without the means of keeping up a
gentlemanly expenditure, I, for one, never wish to see any young man
entered on the books of my own Hall. The system of credit has been
sanctioned by the wisdom of our ancestors, and I have no sympathy
with the rash innovations of levelling times like these. It is highly
desirable that the proper distance should be kept up between º:
of the University and tradesmen; and this would be materially impaired
by any such inquiries into the means of individuals in statu pupillari, as
have been suggested by newspaper writers, who can hardly {. supposed
to know the feelings of gentlemen on such subjects.

“old whitey.”
SUCH, it appears, is the name of GENERAL TAYLOR's horse—the
animal invulnerable to Mexican bullets. At a recent triumphal pro-
cession, “Old Whitey”—by express desire—bore his master: when, as
we learn from the American papers, “ the frenzied enthusiasm” of the
Fº showed itself in robbing Old Whitey’s “flowing mane and tail.”
t would thus appear that human noodles, like woodcocks, are some-
times caught with horse-hair.
The CHURCH OVERLAID.
THE Post says “The Bishop of Oxford's letter to DR. HAMPDEN
affords a melancholy proof how much the Church is overlaid by the
Establishment.” Children have been overlaid and stifled by their
mothers; but what if Mother Church should be overlaid and suffocated
by her overgrown baby, the Establishment?

“WELL, DEAR; so we ARE to be invaded by the FRENch !"
“Lok 1 How Nice ' Why then we shall have All the FRENch Fashions
DIRECTLY THEY come out.”
THE KETTLE HAS DONE IT ALL!
“STEAM has made England no longer an island!”
With this new axiom impressed—as with a wooden butter stamp—
upon the quaking heart of John BUIL, he must never again sing, or
sing it very small, indeed, like the wind whiffling through a key-hole—
that erst triumphant, defiant strain—“Britons never shall be site.”
...And wherefore? Why, the Kettle sings him down—singing a very
different stave. The Kettle sings in French; sings Wive Henri Quatre,
Marlbrook s'en va-t-en guerre, and other heroic and insulting melodies
of our natural enemies. -
“And when and where did the Kettle learn this dreadful, this most
shocking music?”
“Why, my dear Madam—(for Punch is always melted by the appeal of
timid woman; and it was no other than MRs. GERKINs from Brighton,
in her best bonnet and victorine, who, on her way to Apsley House,
called at 85, Fleet Street, to seek comfort in her invasion fever)—my
dear Madam, the Tea-kettle first struck up the tune at Greenock, some
hundred years and more ago.”
“Bless me!” cried MRs. GERKINs; “that it should have been kept
so shamefully quiet all this time! i)
was it 2 ''
“You see, Madam, how—by the ingenuity of fate—that which is ap-
parently invented and fashioned for the peace and happiness of man,
sometimes becomes his greatest misfortune.”
“I recollect,” said the lady, a little subdued, “that dear GERKINs
once said the same thing of his first MRs. G. But the Tea-kettle,
Mr. Punch—”
“The Tea-kettle, Madam, made as you would imagine in the best-
tempered moments of WULCAN–he was the ancient god of Tea-kettles—
for the comfort and delight of BRITANNLA's daughters, will, it is much
to be feared by many elderly gentlewomen, bring French lancers into
their parlours, French dragoons into their dining-rooms, and French
pioneers into their wine-cellars.”
“Bless me!” cried MRs. GERKINs.
“That Tea-kettle at º. and singing on the hob—you
would have likened to a halcyon brooding on the waters. My 3.
MRs. GERKINs, that kettle was—as we now know—a cockatrice hatching
French shells, to be thrown in at the windows and dropt through the
roofs of Englishmen's houses, poetically known to the law as castles!”
“Bless me!” again cried MRs. GERKINs. “But how, Sir? How?”
“There was a little boy, Ma'am, named JAMEs WATT–a, very dull
boy he was thought, but nevertheless a genius; for genius has often,
like, a diamond, such a crust of dullness about it, that nobody believes
in the possibility of its contained splendour. Well, Ma'am, this little
boy would sit and watch his aunt’s Kettle—singularly forgetful now and
then, of his aunt's bannocks—and would gape and gape at the steam, as
it rolled and rolled from the spout; and would seem to listen to genii
i. inside-singing triumphant songs, only understood by that
little boy; for his aunt—good soul!—had no ear for such music.”
“Laſ Well, I love to hear the Kettle sing, myself,” said MRs.
GPRKINs; “’specially with crumpets. But this little boy, Sir? The
odd child!”
“Well, Ma'am, it is now known that he saw all sorts of shapes roll
up in the steam, and melt away like dreams—dreams that have since
ear—dearest Mr. Punch, how ||
become of iron truth and reality. It is now certain that he heard in
the singing kettle the songs of the English CycLQPs (the very fine
fellow, ma'am, is still to be found at Birmingham and other places too
numerous to mention)—the Cyclops making railways, and carriages,
and sawing-mills and, in fact, steam-engines-as barbers say of their
perfumery-in every variety. But, Madam, MASTER JAMEs WATT did
not see and hear what followed; or, if he did with singular prudence
(for he was a Scotchman) he said nothing of the matter.”
“And what, Mr. Punch—what did he see-what hear?”
(It is a festive season; and we do not, within a shade or two, blush
the crimson, that at any other time we certainly should blush, to own
that we had only just breakfasted, and were dragging ourselves—like a
fly through treacle—adown the Morning Post, when MRs. GERKINs
begged and received an audience.) - -
“See here, Madam,” we said, removing the Kettle from the hob to
the glowing fire. Immediately the Kettle struck up, like a young lady
who will sing; and in a minute or two poured forth clouds of vapour,
like some gentlemen who will speak.
“We are enabled to show you all that MASTER WATT kept to him-
self. Dear MRs. GERKINs, . your eye upon the steam, and listen.”
Whereupon we took our faithful iron pen (alas! why for these days was
not the pen a sugar-stick refined to a point?) and, as with a wand,
endeavoured to fix the gentlewoman's eye upon the object.
“Look close to the spout, Madam, and you will behold the French
fleet towed by steamers, coming out of the mouth of Boulogne, and
crossing the C el. They have arrived at Dover: and now keep your
eye to the spout again, Ma'am; and do you not perceive—of course you
do—thousands of boats putting off, full of soldiers, and horses, and
field-pieces, to the beach? The whobbling of the Kettle, Ma'am, is the
lively representation of the guns of Dover Castle, a-firing down upon
the shingles. - - - - --
“You will now perceive in that cloud the railway train—winding as
the sea-serpent—whirling the French army to London. -
“And now, Ma'am—keep your eye close—and you will perceive the
French cuirassiers and French infantry, with their swords and bayonets,
a-charging of the mob through no end of streets and thoroughfares.”
“Bless me! I can see nothing for the steam,” said the punctilious
MRs. GERKINs.
“No, Ma'am; to be sure not: for that is the firing of the French,
and their powder is coarse, which makes the smoke of corresponding
thickness. -
“Now, Ma'am, look a little to the left, and you will perceive all in
confusion about the Courts of Law and the Palace. There is the Lord
Chancellor gallantly swallowing of the Seals of Office to secrete them
about his noble person from an insolent and curious enemy.
“There is HER GRAcious MAJESTY upon a milk-white charger; and
PRINCE ALBERT, and the rest of the Royal Family, affectionately
mounted upon the crupper. -
“The EARL of ELLESMERE approaches the Royal group, with his

But here, the water being exhausted, the steam ceased.
“Why there's no more steam, Mr. Punch!” cried MRs. GERKINs.
“No, Ma'am; because London has struck to the enemy, who, being
out of ammunition, has generously ceased firing.”
“But the Kettle makes a noise still,” said MRs. GERKINs.
“That, Ma'am, is the kettle-drums (trimmed with black crape) of the
Horse Guards, beating a retreat from the invader.”
“Why,” cried MRs. GERKINs, snatching the Kettle from the fire–
“the Kettle’s ruined for everſ Look at the holes.”
“Which, Ma'am,” said we, “supplies the lively moral. The Kettle is
our beloved England, and the French army, that by means of steam is
to come will burn all sorts of holes init.”
“And this is your precious steam l’’ screamed MRs. GERKINs.

24 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GO-CARTS FOR ADULTS.
CoNSIDERING what horrid times we have had in the City, when
some of the first merchants have been unable to keep their legs,
we think we ought not to forget the humble pedestrians who are
desirous of preserving a respectable standing. It is not against
the Panic, but against the greasy and slippery pavement that
the persons alluded to require to be fortified; for it is difficult to
maintain one's footing in this damp weather, when the constant
dripping of the rain makes London as slipperyas one large dripping-
pan. We have consequently invented—but we do not mean to
take out a patent, so any respectable pirate may appropriate the
idea—an Adult Go-Cart, on the principle of the safety carriage
which infants are provided with as a vehicle to their earliest
advances in life.
We do not see why children of a larger growth
should not be equally cared for, and we hope to see the general
adoption of this excellent contrivance.
GREAT THEATRICAL EFFECT.
We know, it has been customary to look upon certain violent proceedings,
which would subject their perpetrators to a liability to find bail before any
Police Magistrate, as great Theatrical Effects. º RUBINI used to
pummel. GRISI ten times round the stage of Her Majesty's Theatre, and
they ultimately rolled on to the bed in their respective rôles of Othello and
Desdemona, it was called a tremendous Theatrical Effect. When KEAN
the elder *: poor Cooper in the chest, with such violence as to
take away his wind for at least a minute, it was considered an extraordinary
Theatrical Effect. The Latest Effect of this class is now being exhibited
at the St. James's Theatre, where Antigone is being performed with a perfec-
tion, both dramatic and musical, that is highly creditable to the management.
We must, however, object to the cruel effect produced by Mons. Bocage,
in dragging poor Antigone across the stage by the hair of her head. Surely,
without any detriment, to the Effect, it might be produced just as well by
º a dummy, instead of the actual heroine. Who would think of shooting
a real Clown out of a real cannon in a Pantomime? yet we have often seen
this singular piece of artillery exercise gone through upon the stage by the
aid of a lay figure, and the result, has been almost as satisfactory to the
audience, as if Clown himself had been let off—no, not let off, but actually
discharged—with real gunpowder. We throw out this hint for the con-
sideration of Mons. Boca GE, who might just as well produce his Great
Theatrical Effect upon a dummy, as drag a real young lady by a real head of
real hair from 0. #. to P. S., amid the mingled horror and applause of the
audience at the terrible reality of the situation.
Who shall escape Whipping?
At the Wandsworth Police three mere boys were sentenced to “be well
whipped” for having stolen some iron and sold it. They were none of them
more than twelve years of age. They were sentenced, we say, to be whipped;
and the reporter records the fact with great seeming satisfaction. Certainly,
this juvenile delinquency is a sad social evil, and should be suppressed; but
it may be permitted us to ask, what has society yet done for these children,

OYoUNG WILLIAM Jones is come out of the West,
Of all the bright engines, his engine’s the best;
And save his grim stoker, he helper had none,
He drove all unhelp'd, and he drove all alone,
So dauntless he rush'd midst his engine's loud moans;
Did you eer hear of driver like young WILLIAM Jones?
He º not for water, he stopp'd not for coke, .
And he skimm'do'er the streams render'd blackby his smoke;
But when at the station he slacken'd his rate,
The up-train had started, the down-train came late;
And a laggard in travel, a luggage-train guard,
Was to wed the fair Polly of Jones's regard.
“I long wood your daughter, my suit you denied;, .
Love swells like a steam-valve, and bursts when it’s tied;
And now I am come, with my lost Pony B.
To walk once the platform, drink one cup of tea:
There are maidens who’d gladly give body and bones,
To jump at the tender of young WILLIAM Jones.”
The bride stirred the Congou, the spoon took it up,
He quaff'd off the tea, and he put down the cup;
She stoop'd on the pavement her sandal to tie,
And she show’d her neat foot with a tear in her eye:
He took her soft hand, ere her mother said may;
“Now walk on the platform,” said young WILLIAM J.
So stately his form, and so beauteous her face,
That never a plank such a couple did grace;
While the stoker did fret, and the engine did fume,
And the station-clerk wink'd in his little back-room,
And the navvys all whisper’d, “Ay, BILL, what d'ye say?
They'd make a meat couple, that galand young J.”
One touch of her hand, and one word in her ear,
And they open'd a carriage that by them stood near;
So light o'er the cushions the fairlady sprung–
So light the policeman the bright brass bellrung–
“She is won! we are off! there’s no train in the way,
And the next does not stophere,” said young WILLIAM J.
There was laughing and roaring with every man;
They laugh'd and they roar'd till their eyes briny ran:
They must get a new maiden to hand out the tea,
For the fair MRs. Jones there they never will see;
And each one that knows her will laughingly say,
“That’s a deucid 'cute fellow, that young WILLIAM J.'"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON. CHARIVARI. 25
| THE SUN-LIGHT AND GAS-LIGHT.
OUR old friend the Sun is in the highest spirits, and came out—for the
first time this season—on Saturday, the 15th of January, to show him-
self to the London public on the occasion of the gratifying proposition
to place a tax upon his old rival Gas, who has, until now, enjoyed a perfect
freedom from all imposts—except on theiron that makes its lamp-posts.
It really is rather unfair that PHOEBUs should be taxed equally all the
year round, whether he is in good or bad spirits, whether he comes
out all smiles and prosperity, or is obscured beneath the clouds of
adversity, while the Gas is altogether exempt from any obligation to
the Government. - - -
We are not advocates for taxes on light, either real or artificial; and
we had rather see the burden taken off the rays of Apollo than put
upon, those which emanate from the Gas-works of the metropolis.
nsidering what an early riser the Sun is for a great portion of the
year, we think the pecuniary duties placed upon him may be objected to
as taxes on industry. We have heard that Young Gas is exceedingly
indignant at the idea of being taxed; and we are rather glad to find
that this is the case, for he never flares up without enlightening the
community,
A PROFESSOR'S PROFESSIONS.
WE perfectly agree with SHAKSPEARE's objections to those people—
be they ladies or gentlemen—who “profess too much;” and we fear
that a certainindividual, whom wenay as well call PROFEssoR PUFFAway,
is liable to the imputation cast upon a class of professors by the Swan
of Avon. PROFEssoR PUFFAway seems to endeavour to outdo himself in
the exaggerated promises he holds out from time to time to the public
through the medium of advertisements. Everybody is familiar with
his celebrated “bad leg of fifty years' standing,” which a touch of his
Ointment has, he declares, restored to its original soundness. But
what are we to think of an old lady whom he has cured, according to
his own account, of two bad legs after, she had been the patient of all
the first physicians in the country, and “an inmate of two hospitals?”
We have seen Ducrow on two horses, with a leg on each; but an old
lady in two hospitals, with a leg in each, is a greater wonder than we
can give PROFESSOR Purrºwly credit for.
Bow-Bell Farces.
We have a volume of Copentry Mysteries; if the show acted in Cheap-
side on the 10th inst. be often re-acted, we may expect a collection of
Bow-Church Farces." To adopt the phraseology of profane playbills, we
may observe of the confirmation of DR, HAMPDEN, that it went off
“with roars of laughter” from crowded pews. Our respect for the
Church prevents the hope that “it will be repeated.”
SONG FOR THE LUMBER TROOP.
TO BE SUNG IN THE PRESENT PROSPECT OF AN INWASION.
Ho! brave comrades of the Lumber,
Make ye ready for the foe;
Wake the City from her slumber,
Let the tocsin ring from Bow !
There’s a rumour of invasion—
Sound the trumpet, beat the drum,
Be prepared for the occasion—
But the French will never come.
Hurray !
Grocers, Merchant Tailors, Tanners,
Hark! from business duty calls;
Hoist aloft your several banners,
Raise the war-cries of your Halls.
What though idle boys burlesque you?
Shout “A Goldsmith for the Right !”
Cry, “A Vintner to the Rescue !”—
Though you’ll never have to fight.
Hurray!
Beye stirring, all ye merry
Men of good St. Mary-Axe
And Cheapside, and Bucklersbury,
Who have never turn'd your backs;
Pour ye down the Hill of Ludgate,
Through the pass of Temple Bar,
Like a torrent through a floodgate—
Though there won't be any war.
Hurray !
In defence of home and beauty,
To the death ºr. to stand,
We’ll obey the of duty,
And we’ll march along the Strand.
With heroic hearts undaunted
We will rush to the Review;
Which is all we shall be wanted,
Fellow citizens, to do.
Hurray!
We will go through the most trying
Of manoeuvres undismay’d ;
With determined souls defying
All the perils of Parade.
And we’ll dream not of retiring,
And we’ll neither duck nor stoop;
Though our comrades may be firing
All their ramrods on our troop.
Hurray!
And when all our danger’s ended,
In our military dress
Won’t we have a banquet splendid,
Ready for us at our mess!
Won't we drink the British Yeoman,
And the Civic Volunteer;
And defiance to the foeman,
Whom, in fact, we need not fear.
Hurray!
GOLD AND SILVER WASHING.
We all remember the modest assertion of the bagman, who declared,
so extensive was the business of his firm, that it saved £500 a-year in
ink by omitting to dot the i's or stroke the t's... The Mechanic's Ma-
gazine gives alike gentle puff to a certain manufacturer of pencil-cases;
He has given in his adhesion to the Sanitary question, and makes great
profit out of his virtue. For instance:–
“The refreshing and healthy system of washing by the workmen, enables their em-
ployers to realise about £400 annually by the sale of the deposit of gold and silver
Femaining in the water-tanks after the men have performed their daily ablutions.”
The writer is, no doubt, deep in LEMPRIERE, and remembers that
when MIDAs took adip in the river Pactolus, he left all the sands so much
gold-dust. We wonder, if water-tanks were established at the Treasury,
whether the country would make a proportionate saving from the clean
hands of all public servants, or whether a water-tank at the Stock
Exchange would turn out a like profitable investment?... We remember
that Sº KENELM D1GBy declares that warts are curable by “washing
the hands in moonshine in a silver basin.”
like the “deposit of gold and silver” in the tradesman's water-tanks.

COURT OF ALDERMEN-DEFENCE OF THE CITY:
WE understand that a Court is called for Monday next, in order that
ALDERMAN. Moon may bring forward a motion that, at the present moment,
is of vital, importance. not only to the City itself, but to all Englishmen
who feel their moral dignity associated with the inviolate majesty of London.
It is, perhaps, not so well known as it ought to be, that ALDERMAN Moon
is on terms of most interesting intimacy with the DUKE, OF WELLINGTON,
The Aldermen has given (or if not, has sold) many touching proofs of his
admiration of the Duke. Hence, he has obtained peculiar knowledge of
the Duke's views, and is very generally considered—throughout, at least,
two chop-houses in the City—to be the Alderman on whom the City of
London, in its hour of need, and when the spurs of the invader shall
jingle above, British pavement, will affectionately rely. , Well, the Alder.
man feels the honourable weight of his position. As he walks down
Threadneedle Street, he feels that the doors rely upon his energy, upon his
foresight, that they shall, not be broken, in by the pickaxe of the pioneer;
that the wives and daughters of his fellow-citizens (blandly serving in the
shops) defy the billets of the invader, whilst Moon is spared them... “An
Clair de la Lune” is at the present moment the fashionable air upon all civic
ianofortes. And the Alderman has proved himself, as defender of the
ity, worthy of his trust; for his motion at the Court of Aldermen convened
for Monday next runs thus:–
“That, contemplating without fear, but also without supineness, the extreme probability,
to say nothing of the manifest likelihood, of an invasion of England by the French, with a
subsequent, if notimmediately following attack, upon the hitherto inviolable, and it may not be
too much to say, virgin city of London, it is resolved that this Court take every necessary and
energetic means to repel the proud invader. In which case, and for the better following
out of so high and national a purpose, it be further resolved that the gates of Temple Bar,
*: civil; palladium, be immediately furnished with a new Chubb's lock, and a pair of patent
nges.
It is expected that so important a motion can hardly be brought forward
without engaging, on both sides, all the eloquence of the City.
Friendship between England and France.
It has given us “wonder great as our content” to find that the best
possible feelingtowards England exists in France, notwithstanding the asser-
tions that have lately been made so very boldly to the contrary. A most
indubitable instance of friendship has just been shown by our Gallicineighbours,
who have actually invited the O'Connells over to Paris, to abanquet on
the 13th of February, and thus given them a temptation to quit England.
it is obvious that even the most temporary riddance of these trouble-
..". willbºa boonto Great Britain; and there cannot beaguestion,
therefore, that the French must wish us well, or they never would offer to
relieve us, even for a short F. of the presence of the O'Connells.
There is not a stronger sign of true and disinterested regard than a readiness
to participate in the annoyances of another; and the proposal from the
French to take a share, however small, of the company of the O'Connelis,
is a more hopeful circumstance for the restoration and duration of the entent,
cordiale, than any other occurrence since the “glorious three days” which
we can call to our recollection.

A NIGHT’S PLEASURE.
THE composer of the Overture of the New Grand Comic Christmas
Pantomine, Harlequin and the Fairy of the Spangled Pocket-handkerchief,
or the Prince of the Enchanted Nose, arrayed in a bran new Christmas
suit, with his wristbands and collar turned, elegantly over his cuffs
and embroidered satin tie, takes a place at his desk, waves his stick,
and away the Pantomime Overture begins.
I pity a man who can’t appreciate a Pantomine-Overture. Children
do not like it: they say “Hangit, I wish the Pantomine would begin:”
but for us it is always a pleasant moment of reflection and enjoyment.
It is not difficult music to understand, like that of your MENDElssohn's
and BEETHOVENs, whose symphonies and sonatas MRs. SPEcstates must
be heard a score of times before you can comprehend them. But of
the proper Pantomime-music I am a delighted connoisseur. Perhaps
it is because you meet so many old friends in these compositions con-
sorting together in the queerest manner, and occasioning numberless
pleasant surprises. Hark! there, goes “Qld Dan Tucker” wandering
into the “Groves of Blarney;” our friends the “Scots wha hae
wi'. Wallace bled” march rapidly down “Wapping Old Stairs,” from
which the “Figlia del Reggimento” comes bounding briskly, when she
#. embraced, and carried off by “Billy Taylor,” that §: young
elioW.
All this while you are thinking with a faint, sickly kind of hope, that
perhaps the Pantomime may be a good one; something like Harlequin
and the Golden Orange Tree, which you recollect in your youth; some-
thing like Fortunio, that marvellous and delightful piece of buffoonery,
which realised the most gorgeous visions of the absurd. You may be
happy, perchance: a *: of the old days may come back to you.
Lives there the man with soul so dead, the being ever so blasé and
travel-worn, who does not feel some shock and thrill still? Just at that
moment, when the bell (the dear and familiar bell of your youth) begins
to tingle, and the curtain to rise, and you see the large shoes and ankles,
the flesh-coloured leggings, the crumpled knees, the gorgeous robes
and masks finally, of the actors ranged on the stage to shout the
opening chorus.
All round the house you hear a great gasping a-ha-a from a thousand
children's throats. Enjoyment is going to give plºt to Hope. Desire
is about to be realised. Q you blind little brats! Clap your hands, and

King Beak, Emperor of the Romans, having invited all the neigh-

celebrated the marriage of his only son, Prince Aquiline, unluckily gave
the liver-wing of the fowl which he was carving to the Prince's god-
mother, the Fairy Bandanna, while he put, the gizzard-pinion on the

Prince Aquiline's nose might grow on the instant as long as the sausage
before him. - * - -

started; the dishes and glasses of the king's banquet, jingled and
smashed as they do on board a steamboat in a storm; the liquor turned
sour; the Chancellor's wig started off his head, and the Prince's royal
father, disgusted with his son's appearance, drove him forth from his
palace, and banished him the kingdom.
Life was a burthen to him on account of that nose. He fled from
a world in which he was ashamed to show it, and would have preferred
a perfect solitude, but that he was obliged to engage one faithful
attendant to give him snuff (his only consolation) and to keep his odious
nose in order. - - -
But as he was wandering in a º forest, entangling his miserable
trunk in the thickets, and causing, the birds to fly scared from the
branches, and the lions, stags, and foxes to sneak away in terror as
they heard the tremendous booming which issued from the fated Prince
whenever he had occasion to use his pocket-handkerchief, the Fairy of
the Bandanna Islands took pity on him, and, descending in her car
ye him a 'kerchief which rendered him invisible
whenever he placed it over his monstrous proboscis.
Having occasion to blow his nose
(which he was obliged to do pretty frequently, for he had taken cold while
lying out among #. rocks and morasses in the rainy miserable nights,
so that the peasants, when they heard him snoring fitfully, thought
that storms were abroad) at the gates of a castle by which he was pass-
ing, the door burst open, and the Irish Giant (afterwards Clown,
#: came out, and wondering looked about, furious to see no one.
The Prince entered into the castle, and whom should he find there but
the Princess Rosolia, still plunged in despair. ... Her father snubbed her
perpetually..."I wish he would snub me!” exclaimed the Prince,
pointing to his own monstrous deformity. In spite of his misfortune
she still remembered her Prince. “Even with his nose,” the faithful
Princess cried, “I love him more than all the world beside l’” -
At this declaration of malterable fidelity, the Prince flung away his
handkerchief, and knelt in rapture at the Princess's feet. She was a
little scared at first by the hideousness of the distorted being before
her—but what will not woman's faith overcome Hiding her head on
his shoulder (and so losing sight of his misfortune), she vowed to love
§ still (in those broken verses which only Princesses in Pantomimes
eliver).
At this instant King Gorgibus, the Giants, the King's Household,
with clubs and battle-axes, rushed in. . Drawing his immense scimetar,
and seizing the Prince by his too-prominent feature, he was just on the
point of sacrificing him, when
—when, I need not say, the Fairy Bandanna (Miss BENDIGo), in her
amaranthine car drawn by º doves, appeared and put a stop to
the massacre. King Gorgibus became Pantaloon, the two Giants first
and second Clowns, and the Prince and Princess (who had been, all the
time of the Fairy's speech, and actually while under their father's
scimetar, unhooking their dresses) became the most elegant Harlequin
and Columbine that I have seen for many along day. The nose flew up
to the ceiling, the music began a {: and the two Clowns, after saying
“How are you?” went and knoc ed down Fantaloon.

WHAT really constitutes a case of a Gentleman in Difficulties, it

word “difficulty” was one quite unknown to his vocabulary. After an

LORD JOHN RUSSELL’S BOWL OF BISHOP.
T this usually inclement season of the
year, the cheerful mug of egg-ſlip and
the comforting tumbler of hot-spiced
elder cordial are in great request, as the
means, of raising low spirits, and warm-
ing the cockles of the chilled heart.
Perhaps, however, both egg-hot and elder:
wine must yield in their elevating and
invigorating properties to a good Bishop.
Hence, doubtless, it is, that, in pursuance
of his well-known liberal feelings, LoRD
John Russelſ, has selected the present
time as peculiarly appropriate to the
onation which he has just made to the
destitute people of Hereford. The Pre-
Emier, indeed, appears to have given them
* more Bishop than they know what to do
with ; for the public at large, through the
channels of the press, has been absolutely
deluged with his lordship's Bishop; and
the Bishop has got so completely into our heads, that it may be ques-
tioned whether we have not had more of it than is good for us.
LQRD JOHN's Bishop, in some quarters, has given much satisfaction;
in others, it has been greatly objected to. By some palates it has been
ronounced not to have the orthodox flavour; and hence a quantity of
lot water has been added to it by certain parties, who, however, by so
doing, have made a mess of it. The Bishop appears to have been
disliked at Oxford, and dissatisfaction was expressed with it by thirteen
dignitaries of the Church, few of whom, it seems, had ever tasted it.
The DEAN or HEREFORD refused the Bishop altogether; but swallowed
it at last on compulsion, with very many faces. We shall not
undertake to decide on the merits of LoRD JoHN's Bishop, and will
content ourselves with publishing the following testimonials which
i.” sent to us, and of the genuineness of which we have no
“No, I.

have no hesitation in terming it an excellent compound. The Hereford
Bishop is quite after my own heart. I relish it exceedingly, and have
much pleasure in giving it my recommendation.
“R. DUBLIN.”

“For some time, I regret to say, I entertained an unfavourable
impression with respect to the Hereford Bishop made by Lond JoHN
RussELL, and, in common with others, was induced to speak dispa-
ragingly thereof. My opinion of it, however, was founded on mere
hearsay, and I now candidly admit, was an erroneous prejudice. I have
at length tested this Bishop, and, having given it a fair trial, unhesi-
tatingly pronounce it to be a superior article...I not only think the
Bishop may be taken with perfect safety, but with great benefit to the
internal constitution. “S. Oxo N.”
After these attestations in its favour, it is probable that LoRD JoHN
RussELI's Bishop will become popular; though neither that nor any
other Bishop, we imagine, will ever rival the popularity of Punch.
BREACH OF PRIWILEGE.
We are sorry to be compelled to notice, on the part of a publication
to respectable as the Builder, a case of what we are justified in pro-
nouncing a gross breach of privilege. Everybody knows that we some
years ago made the Nelson Column and Trafalgar Square our own; and
though we can make some allowance for the professional pilferer who
from habit cannot keep his hands out of his neighbour's pockets, we
cannot pardon, in any one holding an honourable station in the world,
those acts that none but the poorest of wits are generally guilty of . It
is a lamentable fact, that the Builder has made a joke on Trafalgar
sº and the Nelson Column.
emight throw the whole concern, fountains, statues, oyster-shells,
and all, into Chancery, if we thought the materials worth the expense
of an injunction; but we prefer warning our usually excellent contem-
porary against a repetition of such an offence as he on this occasion
committed. . As it is the first fault we will not be severe; and we may
rhaps make this º for the Builder, that he thought we had
one with the Column, and he therefore considered himself entitled to
make use of the old materials. We trust he will be more careful for
the future, and not inſringe upon a right of which we claim exclusively
the exercise. We really shall proceed for compensation against the
Commissioners of Woods and Forests, if we are put to anymore trouble
about Trafalgar Square, either in making jokes upon it ourselves, or
protecting the subject against trespassers.
QBut ºlam for jFortifying 310mb.0m.
As it seems settled we are to be invaded, despite our wooden walls,
and as the Guards are to march out of London by the Edgeware or
Hampstead Road, while the enemy march into it by Camberwell or
Clapham, we have turned our attention to a plan for fortifying the
metropolis.
Since last Saturday, we have accordingly mastered the works of
WAUBAN and CoEHORN, with the improvements of CoRMoNTAIGNE,
MonTALEMBERT, BousNARD, CHAssELOUP DE RABAT, and Chou MARA.
Fortified by the authority of these great names, we sat down and
worked till our head was filled with horn-works, our attention distracted
with unravelling rarelins, and our judgment utterly perplexed with
redoubts. In fact, we got into “a mighty maze,” but came out of it (as
we always do) “not without a plan.”
Let horn-works (A, B, C, D, E,) be thrown out at Chelsea Hospital,
Peckham New Town, Upper Clapton, Highbury Barn, and Primrose
Hill, with a glacis and covered way at the re-entering angles of the
counterscarp, and demilunes at right angles to the lunettes. This gives
"|us our enceinte, within which the enemy would be confined if they once
j our outworks, and from which we might play upon them with
atteries en Marbette at the old Bun House, Jack Straw's Castle, Hicks's
Hall, and Chalk Farm, throwing a cross fire right round the line of
Post Delivery, of which
- the only difficulty would be for the troops to
avoid hitting each other.
Within this line we would throw out a strong bastion, en tenaille,
to command the Dover Road, say in Surrey Square, to be worked by
the respectable inhabitants of that neighbourhood; and a tête-du-pont
to defend the passage of the Surrey Canal, which might be manned by
the lightermen, formed into a corps of lighter-bobs for that service.
Their fire would infallibly confuse an enemy, especially if they were
allowed to slang as well as shoot them. -
The Bridges must, of course, be secured by redoubts, with glacis on
the exterior face, so as to make it impossible for the enemy to breach
the bastion by firing along the ditch of the ravelin.
Their heavy guns would thus be comparatively useless, and if a
tenaillon could be thrown up to mask the foot of the escarpe repêtement,
but few of them would probably return to tell the tale. At the same
time, we must strongly combat the proposal, which has not yet been
made, to throw up a terre-plein with breastworks on the exterior of the
parapet, which would be an unnecessary exposure of the flanks of
the bastion, and might probably cause the enceinte to be breached at the
first crowning of the glacis; a contingency, we need hardly say, which
could not fail to have the most deplorable consequences.
If this plan be followed out, in strict detail, we may sleep comfort-
ably in our beds, which it is the duty of every §: to resist
doing while our capital is left in its present shamefully naked state.
A Solemn Farce.
THE directions for confirming a Bishop bear a very close resemblance
to the received recipe for dressing a cucumber. “Slice it,” says
CHESTERFIELD; “sprinkle with pepper,'salt, oil, and vinegar. hen the
dressing is to your taste, take your cucumber and — throw it out of
the window.”. So with the Bow-Church ceremonial. “Catch your
bishop, read his petition, call upon all persons who have grounds of
opposition to come forward and ºppose, and when they come forward
– declare you can’t hear them.”

HER age is 14. Her arms are bare, and her feet slipshod. Her curls
are rarely out of paper. She sports a clean apron on the Sunday, about
tea-time. It is a mystery where she sleeps; some say the kitchen, in
one of the large drawers; and others declare she has a turn-up bed in
the hall-clock; but it is not known for positive whether she ever goes to
bed at all. She has a wonderful affection for the cat. Everything that
is missed, or lost, or broken, or not eaten, she gives unhesitatingly to
him. She is not fond of i. drawing-room, but has a good-natured
partiality for the garret, who sings funny songs, and gives her occa-
sionally an order for the play. She takes her dinner whilst washing the
dishes, and never gets her breakfast till all the floors, have done with
the one teapot. She tries very hard to answer five bells at once, and in
despair answers none. . She always forgets the mustard, and prefers
blowing the fire with her mouth instead of the bellows. Her hands will
not bear minute inspection; and no wonder, for she is cleaning boots, or

pan, hands bread on a fork, and wipes plates with her apron. ; She is
abused by everybody, and never gets a holiday. She only knows it is
Sunday by the lodgers stopping in bed later than usual, and having
twice as many dinners to cook. She is never allowed to go out, except-
ing to fetch beer or tobacco. She hears complaints without a murmur,
and listens to jokes without a smile. She gets £6 a year, and is ex-

SUNDAY BALLS.
THE Duke’s Invasion Letter has been a great relief to thousands.
And after this fashion. Almost every man carries about with him
some absurdity, which awaits but the proper moment to be uttered, and
so, for a time at least, to relieve the bearer. The world has its periods
of madness and of folly. Old as it is, it runs round and round its circle of
whims and diseases. Now it has-or thinks it has-so much mone
in its pockets, that it cannot spend it fast enough; and now, wit
wealth inexhaustible it believes itself within an inch of an Universal
Union. Folks who feared an invasion, authorised by LoRD ELLESMERE
and his Grace, have said their say; have contributed their quota of
absurdity; aná, satisfied with the effort, may now rest content for life.
Not that we think quite enough has been done with the Invasion Fever.
We are certainly surprised—seeing what a nostrum-loving people we
are—that no new MoRRison has arisen, with a specific against fear of
the French. We think an Invasion Pill would have gone down. Of
course, the consumption would have varied with different places; folks
on the sea-shore requiring a double dose compared with those more and
more inland.
If, however, we are not to have Pills, we are at least offered Balls-
Sunday Balls—as the only preventive of the French in England. A lively
correspondent in the Chronicle suggests that the great mass of the people
should be divided off into shooting companies, and that they should
“train and practise on a Sunday.” Gunpowder would have a more
precious smell on the seventh day:
“Exercising grounds should be prepared in the environs of railways, and the com-
panies should carry the National Guard gratuitously to and from their destination. The
men, carried gratuitously, would probably pay for the passage of wife and family, and
all would get fresh air.”
The smell of hawthorn and gunpowder—the shooting of rifles and
corn!, A very pretty association of the productive and destructive.
And then the children would be so early accustomed to military
matters, that they would be able to stand fire before they quitted the
breast; and when they cut their teeth, instead of a coral, would cut
them on ball-cartridge. -
We think, too, the spirit would spread among the wives. ..After a
little while, we should expect a very large Amazonian force. The Cri-
noline Rangers, the Boa Rifles, the Manchester j
Straws, the $º Blue-Stockings, would soun
Connaughts, the Coldstreams, and the Buffs. -
Again, how beautifully would women blend the domestic and maternal
delights of life with these martial doings! For when the shooting was
over, how delightful it would be for the husbands and sweethearts to
form into a hollow square, whilst the women inside made tea. And
even before, whilst the mother practised at the bull's-eye, the babe—
early educated—might suck it. We askit, is not this the way to keep up
the patriotic spirit Sunday Balls for men and women, and brandy-
balls for children. -

NEW DRAMATIC SCHOOL.
THE decline of the old school of actors and actresses has long been a
subject of the most dismal lamentation; but we are glad to find that
the histrionic art still stands a chance of preservation, by the establish-
ment of a new school, under the able direction of MRs. GLOVER, who is
one of the few remaining members of the old school, and one of its
brightest ornaments. If all the performers of the old school resembled
MRs. GLovER, we might j". having so few of them left, and
we ought to be exceedingly obliged to her, at any rate, for taking the
trouble to give the rising generation the benefit of her tuition.
We believe a great deal of the dramatic art, may be taught, and we
have therefore some hopes from the school which MRs. GLovER, and
her son are on the point of establishing...We presume there will be
professors for every department, from the highest tragic to the lowest
comic; and there will of course be classes for the examination of the
students. . We can imagine MR. DIDDEAR at the head of an entire form
of Injured Husbands, all denouncing, in turn, some imaginary “span-
gled officer” who has dazzled the eyes of a weak-minded wife; and we
can conceive a ponderous professor of the heavy business with a whole
row of Indignant Fathers before him, repeating, in guttural chorus, some
tremendous curse on a series of Undutiful, Daughters, or cutting off a
batch of Scapegrace Sons with a corresponding number of shillings.
But the Soubrette Class brings us to the contemplation of a more
pleasing set of objects... We can picture to ourselves the professor of
“Pert Chambermaidism,” inculcating among a row of female candidates
=~~~ -
for histrionic fame those engaging qualities of domestic *:
which are so common on the stage, and happily so rare in real life. A
set of examination-papers should, of course, be prepared to prove the
efficiency of the various pupils; and directions should be framed for
wheedling Old Guardians, extracting bribes from Young. Lovers, and
coquetting with roguish valets—three achievements which go to the
formation of the character of the Stage Ladies' Maid.
The Practical Joke department would require the utmost attention,
for modern farces are chiefly written with a view to those effects that
once used to be considered the legitimate property of mere pantomime.
In the present day the Clown and the Comedian must be combined; for
a funny man whose limbs are not sufficiently supple to allow of his
being doubled up in a bagatelle-board, or stowed away in a cellaret, with
his legs and arms occupying the holes usually assigned to the decanters,
cannot hope to be considered a funny man at all.
We must suppose that the Dramatic School will commence with first
principles in this difficult department, and revert to the old original style
of practical joking, which has been improved upon to the most wondrous
extent by our farce writers, until the once popular prank of hiding under
a table and upsetting it on discovery, has become commonplace in the
extreme. A necessity, however, for learning the elements of the art
will render this sort of thing desirable for young beginners, until
they are gradually educated into the more difficult accomplishments of
creeping into clock-cases, jumping into picture-frames to be mistaken
for portraits, and giving other touches of dramatic nature, which make
the whole world grin. - -
We hope that a class of Walking Gentlemen will not be forgotten in
the new establishment, for the purpose of instructing lisping ouths in
the amiable art of apostrophising with propriety their “Dearetht
ELITHA, the thweeteth contholation of their thuffering thpiriths.”
The Nelson Monument.
THERE has been a º: lately that the bronze panels intended to
ormament the base of the Nelson Column were complete, but it turns
out that the report is as baseless as the fabric itself, and that both the
one and the other are likely to remain without foundation. The artists
cannot get their designs further than the clay, and they are all º
in the mud in the most unsatisfactory manner... We are only afrai
that new subjects for the panels will be required; for it is probable that,
long before they are completed, the world will have forgotten the events
they were intended to commemorate.

A NIGHT'S PLEASURE.
N the conclusion of the Pantomime, the present memorialist had the
honour to conduct the ladies under his charge to the portico of the
theatre, where the green fly was in waiting to receive them. The driver
was not more inebriated than usual; the young page with the gold-
knobbed hat was there to protect his mistresses; and though the chaperon
of the party certainly invited me to return with them to Brompton and
there drink tea, the proposal was made in terms so faint, and the re-
freshment offered was so moderate, that I declined to journey six miles
on a cold might in order to partake of such a meal. The waterman of
the coach-stand, who had made himself conspicuous by bawling out for
MRs. FLATHER's carriage, was º with me to give him six-
pence for pushing the ladies into the vehicle. But it was my opinion
that MRs. FLATHER ought to settle that demand; and as, while the
fellow was urging it, she only pulled up the glass, bidding Cox's man
to drive º of course did not interfere. In vulgar and immoral
lan e he indicated, as usual, his discontent. I treated the fellow
with playful and, I hope, gentlemanlike satire. -
MAstER Jones, who would not leave the box in the theatre until
the people came to shroud it with brown-hollands, (by the way, to be
the last person in a theatre—to put out the last light—and then to find
one's way out of the vast black lonely place, must require avery courageous
heart)—MASTER Jones, I say, had previously taken leave of us, putting
his arm under that of his father's footman, who had been in the pit,
and who conducted him to Russell Square. I heard AUGUSTUs propos-
ing to have oysters as they went home, though he had twice in the
course of the performancemade excursions to the cake-room of the theatre,
where he had partaken of oranges, macaroons, apples, and ginger-beer.
As the altercation between myself and the linkman was going on,
young GRIGG (brother of GRIgG of the Life-Guards, himself reading for
the Bar) came up, and hooking his arm into mine, desired the man to
leave off “chaffing” me; asked him if he would take a bill at three
months for the money; told him if he would call at the Horns Tavern,
Kennington, next Tuesday week, he would find sixpence there, done u
for him in a brown paper parcel; and quite routed my opponent. “
know you, MR. GRIgg,” said he;, “you’re a gentleman, you are:” and
so retired, leaving the victory with me. .
Young MR.G.Rigg is one of those young bucks about town, who goes
every night of his life to two Theatres, to the Casino, to WEIPPERT's
balls, to the Café de l'Haymarket, to BoB SLOGGER's, the boxing- |
house, to the Harmonic Meetings at the Kidney Cellars, and other
places of fashionable resort. He knows everybody at these haunts of
leasure; takes boxes for the actors’ benefits; has the word º:

RUMMER’s in Conduit Street, besides his Chambers at the Temple
where his parents, SIR John and LADY GRIgG of Portman Square, an
Grigsby Hall, Yorkshire, believe that he is, assiduously occupied in
studying the Law. “ToM applies too much,” her ladyship says. “His
father was obliged to remove him from Cambridge on account of a
brain fever brought, on by hard reading, and in consequence of the
ealousy of some of the collegians; otherwise, I am told, he must have
een Senior Wrangler, and seated first of the Tripod.”
“I’m going to begin the evening,” said this ingenuous young fellow;
“I’ve, only been at the Lowther Arcade, WEIPPERT's hop, and the
billiard-rooms; I just toddled in for half an hour to see BRooke in
Qthello, and looked in for a few minutes behind the scenes at the
Adelphi. What shall be the next resort of pleasure, SPEc, my elderly
juvenile? Shall it be the Sherry-Cobbler-Stall, or the Cave of Har-
mony ? There’s some prime Fiji. there.”
“What is the old Caveo
have not been there these twenty years.” And memory carried me
back to the days when Lightsides, of Corpus, myself, and little
OAks, the Johnian, came up to town in a chaise-and-four, at the long
vacation at the end of our freshman's year, ordered turtle and venison
for dinner at the Bedford, blubbered over Black-eyed Susan at the play,
and then finished the evening at that yery Harmonic Cave, where the
famous English Improvisatore sang with such prodigious talent that
we asked him down to stay with us in the country. SPURGIN, and
HAWKER, the fellow-commoner of our College, I remember me, were
at the Caye too, and BARDOLPH, of Brazennose. , Lord, lord, what a
battle and struggle and wear and tear of life there has been since then!
HAWKER levanted, and SPURGIN is dead these ten years; little OAKs is a
whiskered Captain of Heavy Dragoons, who cut down no end of Sikhs
at Sobraon; LIGHTSIDEs a Tractarian parson, who turns his head and
walks another way, when we meet; and your humble servant—well
never mind. But in my spirit I saw them—all those blooming and
i. young boys—and LIGHTSIDEs, with a cigar in his face, and a
ang-up white coat covered with mother-of-pearl cheese-plates, bellowing
out for “First and Second Turn-out,” as our yellow post-chaise came
rattling up to the Inn door at Ware.
"And so the Cave of Harmony is open,” I said, looking at little GRIgg
with a tºl and tender interest, and feeling that I was about a hundred
years old.
“I believe you, my haw-au-oy!” said he, adopting the tone of an ex-
ceedingly refined and popular actor, whose choral and comic powers
render him a general favourite.
. Does. BIVINs keep it?” I asked, in a voice of profound melancholy.
‘Hoh! What a flat you are You might as well ask if MRs. Sib-
Dons acted Lady Macbeth to-night, and if QUEEN ANNE’s dead or not.

you! Come in and see: I know the landlord—I’ll introduce you to him.”
This was an offer which no man could resist; and so GRIGG and I
went through the Piazza, and down the i. of that well-remembered
place of conviviality. GRIgg knew everybody; wagged his head in at
the bar, and called for two glasses of his Fº mixture; nodded to
the singers; winked at one friend-put his little stick against his nose
as a token of recognition to another; and calling the waiter by his
Christian name, poked him playfully with the end of his cane, and asked
him whether he, GRIgg, should have a lobster kidney, or a mashed oyster
and scolloped 'taters, or a poached rabbit, for supper? - -
The room was full of young rakish-looking lads, with a dubious sprink-
ling of us middle-aged youth, and stalwart red-faced fellows from the
country, with whiskeynoggins before them, and bent upon seeing life. A
and piano had been introduced into the apartment, which did not exist
in the old days: otherwise, all was as of yore-smoke rising from scores of
human chimnies, waiters busting about with cigars and liquors in the
intervals of the melody—and the President of the meeting, (BIVINs no
more) encouraging gents to give their orders.
Just as the music was about to begin, I looked opposite, me, and
there, by Heavens! sate BARDOLPH, of Brazennose, only a little more
purple, and a few shades more dingy than he used to look werg years
ago. PEC.
The Time for Poaching.
A CoRREspond ENT of the Times states that night poachers, by order
of the Home Secretary, are now to be tried at the assizes; and he asks
why the rule should not extend to day poachers as well? As the latter
class of offenders are under the jurisdiction of county, magistrates, who
are at once prosecutors, judges, and jurors, we certainly, for our own
part, would rather poach by night than by day: “A shiny night,” now
more than ever, will be the "delight” of the poacher, as affording
him, the best opportunity for depredation, with the smallest risk of
punishment.
A PATRIOTIC RETURN.
THE first motion of the new Session, will be one by MR. Joseph
HUME, who will move for a return of all the *: which has been stolen
from his residence. We hope the return will soon be made, and that
every bit of the plate will be ordered at the earliest opportunity—say his
birth-day, which is the most º: period to wish a person
many º returns—to lie upon his dinner-table. This return is but
due to . HUME, who has shone, in public, as in private, by so many
brilliant services.

Y“Prince made proclamation,
That eache engineere or stoker
Should instantlie be broke, or
Blown uppe, who tooke occasion
Of y” gallante Frenche invasion,
SUNDAY AT EXETER HALL.
THE following is from a notice in the Post, of a concert held a few
days since at Exeter Hall:—
“It is stated that some of the Committee objected to Mr. GENGE's singing CAREy's
favourite ballad, ‘Sally in our Alley,” at MR. SMITH's concert the other evening, owing
to an allusion to Sunday in the words; whereas PHILLIPs was allowed to sing a demo-
niacal song from The Mountain Sylph.”
“Some” of the Committee deserve the thanks, at least—the more
so, as the most easily bestowed—of all the very pious who use Exeter
Hall. Sunday is not, even by allusion, to be set to music. People, to
be sure, in churches and chapels, sing on Sundays; but then it is solemn
minstrelsy; whilst even to allude to the seventh day in a ballad, is to
break it. Thus, in a song, the best observance of the Sabbath is to take
no notice of it.
All our readers, however, may not know the extent of their obligations
to some (“the perfect chrysolites!”) of the Committee, inasmuch as
they may be ignorant of the demoralising tendency of the allusion to the
Sunday aforenamed. In the days, of our youth, our memory was un-
happily tainted with the wicked syllables, and
“The scent of the brimstone will hang round it still.”
The words are, if we mistake not—
“Of all the days that’s in the week,
There's none I love like one day;
And that's the day that comes between
The Saturday and Monday.”
The sly and subtle meaning of the singer will, on a little consideration,
be made plain to the least pious understanding. The balladist (forlorn
creatureſ) evidently means the intervening day to be no other than the
Sabbath. And why (we think we hear a MAckworth or an AGNEw, in
sectarian thunder roll the query)—why does he love the Sabbath?
Let the doomed wretch answer for himself—
“For then I'm drest all in my best,
To take a walk with SALly;
She is the darling of my heart,
And she lives in our alley,”
Let us consider the quantity of sin that—like poison mantling an egg-
cup-overbrims this little verse. Human vanity and human perdition
are in it. The worldly conceit of dress rises in the heart of the sinner.
He thinks, as of the fleshpots of Egypt, as of the vanities of Babylon, of
“his best”—it may be his best blue coat, with those gauds of a carnal:
minded world, brass buttons...What will he think of when he is about
to descend into his f"; ?...Will the best blue Saxony be any comfort
to him in his shroudf Will the brass buttons delight him when under

a coffin-plate? These—and many more such as these—are questions
that “some of the Committee” would instantly put to the forlorn
i. thinking of Sunday, because on that day he is to appear “all in
his best!”. Butlet us, § we have strength, anatomise the whole of the
ulcerous iniquity.
The lost sheep is drest, all in his best; his blue coat, bluer than
burning sulphur—and his beaver hat, black and sleek as Satan! And
what does he, when thus ºpped for sin and death? Why, treading
the broad way, he sets forth–
“To take a walk with SALLY.”
And where do they walk to? Why, at the yery words, we smell tea and
bread-and-butter; haply, shrimps; with—it, is not unlikely—the sup-
lementary abominations of biscuits and ale ! . It is impossible for us to
}. cannot, if we would (saith the white-robed purity of Exeter
Hall), deny that there are such places as Bagnigge, Wells; as the Eel-
ie House; as Cremorne Gardens!, No; we will not hoodwink our
nowledge, and be blind to these stumbling Christians, whose human souls
are bartered for tea and shrimps and pots of porter...Well, where does
the † sheep, in his best fleece, go with SALLY, (forlorn little lamb |
our heart bleeds for thee)—where does he go to ? Why, we see them
both seated in that arbour of º and privet; there they both are,
taking tea together; or it may be, the tea is over, and SALLY, with car-
nation blushes in her face, and her little mouth making believe to bite
round the edge of a biscuit, is almost sure—though her heart, thumps
so, she can hardly be certain of it—that the man “in his best", is
holding out the temptation of furniture for, two, parlours or a third
floor, and further requesting to be permitted, without further shilly-
shally, to put up the banns ! - -
Some of the Exeter Hall Committee see and hear all this in the notes
of “Sally in our Alley,” and, very properly, will not allow them to be
breathed into the ears of a carnal and impulsive congregation! -
Now, it is very different with “a demoniacal song from The Mountain
Sylph.” That song deepens, we believe, into a chorus;, and the
burden of the song, if we mistake not, is, “Rejoice, ye demons of
night !” Now we feel very certain that if such powers of darkness have
their moments of enjoyment, they never rejoice, with greater revelry
than when common sense is beaten by bigotry, and Christian intelligence
is displaced by cant,
“BURON v. DENMAN.”
It is said that SIR FitzRoy KELLY will, on this approaching case,
shew his devotion to poetry by often availing himself of “The Pleasures
of Memory.”

LOOKING-GLASSES FOR BIRDS.
“MR. Punch, ! . . .
“BEING descended in a right flight from the Tom-tit of Æsor,
I inherit the like faculties possessed by my immortal ancestor. Thus
I am frequently called upon to take, from the top of a house, a bird's-
eyeview of Punch lying in the opposite bookseller's window, and, to the
delight and improvement of my feathered friends, to chirpatranslation of
its admirable contents... I can assure you, Mr. Punch, that the sparrows
living in the volutes and cornices of Apsley-House have been mightil
pleased, with your various, remarks upon the French Invasion; º
tickled by their fun, have chirped and chirped the matter over, even to
the disturbance of his Grace, time out of mind an early riser. All
this, however, by the way. My present purpose is to reply to a very
foolish para —taken from the Gardeners' Chronicle—about ‘looking-
glasses for birds.” The writer says–
"The tom-tits attacked my Sechel pears, to which they seemed very partial; a bit
of looking-glass suspended in front of the tree, put a stop to the mischief. My grapes
were next much damaged before they were ripe, by thrushes and starlings; a piece of
looking-glass drove these away, and not a grape was touched afterwards.”
... “Good Mr. Punch, don't believe a word of it. The male birds are,
it is true, made shy by the glass; but where the mirror scares away
ºne male, it attracts at least twenty hens... I do assure you, Sir, if this
fashion becomes general, if people on hanging looking-glass about
their fruit-trees, there will be a double calamity. In the first place, all
the fruit for the next season will be devoured by the hen-birds brought
to the trees by the mirrors; and secondly, they will be so much occu-
pied looking at themselves, preening their feathers, and taking attitudes
and graces in the looking-glasses, that their nests will be imperfect!
built, their eggs half-addled, and such young nestlings as are bred wi
be shamefully neglected by their maternal parent.
“Mr. Punch, man behaves very unfairly to us poor birds in this his
last device... We know that we are hatched to undergo the risk of
ird-lime, of net, and trap, and gun: this is our fate, and we submit to
it. Killus, if you like, but do not deprave our manners. Shoot us, if
you can, but at least do not introduce into the commonwealth of birds
º: too-frequent disturber of the peace of human families, a looking-
glass. - . .

WHAT WILL THE FRENCH DO WITH ALGERIA P
We are puzzled to guess
what the French will do
with Algeria, now that
e ABD-EL-KADER is taken.
# There are no more caves
to smoke. There is not
a tribe worth plundering.
Morocco, too, is quiet.
All conquests, therefore,
are completely hors de
combat, and there is not
as much as a Razziaworth
living for. Everything
must be most intensely
dull. We can imagine
the whole army is in
tears, for the want of
something to do. Glory,
in Africa, is dead. Peace
to its ashes!
We feel dº?! in this
sad dearth of victories,
for the Moniteur. The
poor. Editor will, have
absolutely nothing left to
exercise his vivid imagi:
nation upon. He will
have nothing to record
now but the dry appoint-
ment of Prefects, and
nothing to solace himself
with but the flowery ad-
dresses of the Chambers
to Louis-PHILIPPE on his
birth-day. These latter
compositions are cer-
tainly brilliant specimens
of colouring; but still they do not allow that inexhaustible scope for happy
invention which the Algerian campaigns invariably opened. It was so
easy to invent when there was no one to contradict. The Moniteur will
certainly have to go into mourning, and the bereaved Editor will be
reduced to sell his prolific pen for what it will fetch, to some brother
romancier. Perhaps MossIEUR ALEXANDRE DUMAs, will buy it of
him. We can conceive what thrilling romances such a pen, in the
hands of such a genius, would achievel -
We think candidly, that the French were great fools in taking ABD-
EL-KADER, and we do not mind telling them so. As long as he was at
liberty, they had something to fight for, and something to brag about.
The Chambers paid their millions for the army willingly, so long as
GUIzot could prove to them that the annals of France were being
enriched at the handsome rate of some twenty victories every year.
The French do not mind how dearly they pay for their glory, but they
do not like lavishing their money in ship-loads, and not receiving un
sou de gloire in return for it. Besides, the little promenades over the
mountains and back again, in search of an invisible enemy, made the
Royal Princes very popular, and filled Versailles with grand pictures
half a mile long, consisting one half of smoke, and the other half of red
breeches. ABD-EL-KADER served another purpose very effectively.
very mauvais sujet was sent out of France to improve his morals in
Africa. It was a nursery for future TURENNEs, a large play-ground for
the more riotous part of the army, and a great French penitentiary,
where all noisy republicans, and discontented patriots, and ambitious
Generals, were confined till they died of fever, or a musket-ball, or learnt
to appreciate the very paternal sway of Louis-PHILIPPE. But now
that ABD-El-KADER is carried away, the play-ground will have lost its
principal attraction, and the juvenile TURENNEs will not be able to pla
even at a game of prisoner's base. However, the capture of the Ara
Chief has proved one thing. It has convinced sceptics, and we were
one of the number, that ABD-El-KADER is at least a real person—that
he is not the Mrs. Harris of France, which we always took him to be—
that he is not, the fabulous JugurtHA, who, it was unanimously
believed, was only born to be killed by the French army once a week.
We look upon the fact of his existence as the greatest discovery of the
present year.
. But what will the French do with Algeria? It is useless our repeat-
ing this curious º for we tº: we cannot answer it. Our
belief is that the French, before long, will find out their grievous mis
take, and that they will take ABD-EL-KADER back again to Africa, and
allow him to escape, to enable them to commence a new course of
Yictories. The French army, it is well known, cannot exist without
#; the throne of Louis-PhILIPPE, it is equally well known, runs
the agreeable risk of being exposed to as many storms as a beacon on
the Goodwin Sands, and of lasting about as long, unless it has a new
sediment annually of glory to rest upon; and pray, how is the history
of France to be written unless there is a victory in every page? Our
British word for it, in less than six months ABD-El-KADER will be in
Algeria . It will be either that, or else an invasion of England;
but we advise our readers to make their bets in preference upon the
former certainty. How happy the Moniteur would be with either'

IN THE PROSPECT OF ADDITIONAL TAXATION.
THE able-bodied HERCULEs, that man of might and pith,
According to the story, which your scholars call a myth,
Supporting on his shoulders broad, the burden of the sky,
Saved it from falling, and the larks from being caught thereby.
But what is MR. HERCULEs to me, I want to know?
See what a weight I carry on my shoulders as I gol
Just let me ask you where you think friend HERCULES would be
If you saddled him with taxes in the way you’ve saddled me *
For every article almost I have of use or beauty,
n one shape or another, I’ve to pay a thumping duty;
For nearly every single thing I eat, or drink, or wear— -
They’ve tax'd my light, and soon perhaps they mean to tax my air.
The Property and Income Tax, when Parliament had pass'd,
Come now, thinks I, I know the worst; sure here's an end at last.
Ah! no such luck! another load they mean to clap on me:
I wonder what, in goodness’ name, my next tax is to be.
I look around, and I declare, as I’m a sinner, that
There's nothing I can see untax’d about me but my cat.
I’m quite cleaned out, used wholly up, done—brown as any toast:
Drat it! you can’t, do what you will, get blood out of a post.
Well, lay it on, good gentlemen; but only have a care:
There is a load that’s greater than the strongest man can bear.
Already limagine I can hear my sinews crack;
And 'tis the last ounce, recollect, that breaks the donkey's back.
|COUNTRY QUARTERS.
A GRANT of £30,000 for a Pinery at
Kew has suggested to our minds
the propriety of making some allow-
ance for the establishment of a hot-
house during this cold weather for
the reception of some curious plants
of British growth, to whom such an
asylum would prove very acceptable.
The Pine is valuable, no doubt; but
there are other productions, of an
English soil that may be said to be
literally pining, for want of some
lace in which their preservation can
e attended to. The agricultural
labourer, for instance, would greatly
profit by having a nice warm bed
provided for him at the public ex:
pense, like his rivals the Pines; and
while the parent stem would be thus
preserved and strengthened, the
junior branches would shoot forth
with additional regularity and vigour.
... We hope our idea will not be lost
sight of, and that the Pines at Kew
will not be ſº. as the only -
worthy objects of liberality; for, sup- . - -
posing £30,000 to give us 30,000 pines in one year, at a pound per pine,
we should like some arithmétician to tell us how many human beings
could be supported for the same money.

AMERICAN MEDALS.
GENERAL Scott is to have a medal stamped to his victories, “in gold.”
Having read the stupid praise in which the resolution is couched, we
think the fitter material for the medal would be—butter. We alread
have the Order of St. Patrick; let the Americans, for cheapness an
propriety, use butter for their heroes, and call it “The Order of St. Pat.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FRENCH AT BRIGHTON.
Rs. . MARY GERKINs. Peri-
winkle House, Marine Pa-
rade, Brighton, presents her
compliments, and – at this
in minent time—begs of Mr.
Punch a corner in his beau-
tiful journal for her little
letter. If MRs. MARY GER-
KINs was in Parliament—as,
indeed, women ought to be
—she would not trouble
Mr. P., but give the country
a bit of her mind from her
seat in the House. As it is,
being a lone woman and a
widow, she hopes she may
be permitted to save her
country through the news-
papers.
“Periwinkle House,
“Brighton, Jan. 25.
“MR. PUNCH,
“THE more I look
at the opposite coast of
France (and I’ve a telescope
for the first floor that, as, I may say, sweeps the Channel, clean, as
a new pin) the more I'm certain of danger from our natural enemies.
I sit spying at my window till, sometimes, I think I see no end of
flat-bottomed boats at Dieppe, full of soldiers, and horses, and baggage-
wagons. My girls, to comfort me, tell me it's the clouds; but I
only hope it isn't the smoke of the enemy's steamers.
“My letter, I am proud to say it, has put the whole town in a
twitter. Lodgings have dropt to nothing. First floors have come
down to seconds, and there’s next to no difference between backs and
#. In fact, the whole place is—A Town to Let, and Nobody to
ake it.
“I am now happy to say that all the blame's laid at my door. , Yes;
Periwinkle House s it all. When people abused me for my letter,
I cried a little at first ; but it’s sweet to find what spirit persecution
puts into a body. . It’s as good as another shawl to a woman!
““Do #. want to ruin Brighton, Ma'am-do you want to make it
another Pollmyra—another Thibs?” said MR. * * * * to me, of the
Circ'lating Library. ‘People have sent home Now and Then, and I
don't know what, because they couldn’t get through 'em so near the
sea! Do you want to make the place a desert, Ma'am—a desert without
a single Oh Acis P’
“I said nothing. Only this. When the French had come, how he’d
thank me for that, beautiful letter! As poor GERKINs used to say—
and now I believe him—"If you want to serve your country, mind you
can afford to É. for it.” However, I have made up my mind to suffer,
and nothing shall º me.
“Mr. Punch, now I know the truth of what PROFEssoR ToAD-
INAHOLE said here, in his lecture “On the Vitality of Bluebottles,’ at
the Old Ship. *Everybody,’ º: he, “is born with a mission.” At
first, I thought mission' was only a knowing name for a ‘caul. How-
ever, at last I found it, out. For, as the Professor said, folks, have
sometimes to wait to learn it. My mission is—to save Brighton |
GERKINs used to say I’d a good deal of gunpowder in my veins; and
now he's gone, I don't mind owning it. “Human nature,’ said the
Professor, is always the same.’ Well, we have had a JoAN or ARc;
which is all the stronger reason for having a Many or BRighton
Nature isn't like a tea-caddy, but keeps supplying herself.
“And now, Mr. Punch, I have something to say that will make the
very horsehair of the Horse-Guards stand on end. You know I told
you that I had taken a many French lodgers. Well, Sir, there was the
CoMTE DE FILou, PRINCE GURAcoa, and others I don't remember,
that, last autumn, lodged with me. They went away, leaving a port.
manteau to be sent for. As I’ve never heard of 'em since, and they
only gave JULIUs half-a-crown among 'em, I haven't hesitated to
open the luggage; and a blessed thing it is I did. For there, Mr. Punch
–(I used to see 'em twiddling with compasses, and rules, and I don't
know what, on paper)—for there is the whole Plan, drawn and coloured,
of an attack upon this blessed Brighton. There isn’t an alley that
isn’t down—not a court-yard that they don’t know every bit of. Not
only, too, the plan of an attack, but of fortifying and keeping the
place afterwards.
“As the best luck would have it, MR. STEELPEN, a playwriter, is
lodging with me (two-pair front, it being the dull season) at this
moment. "I believe he has served in the army, for once I heard him
say—‘Nobody knew what in his time he had taken from the
French... (He's now doing an original play,+such a sweet thing!—
to be called, ‘Isn't it Particularly Odd that the Woman hasn't Brought
Home the Linen 2") Well, I showed the Frenchman's papers to MR. S.,
and he explained all the mischief to me. B, X, K, C, Z, and other
innocent-looking letters of the alphabet—mean no less than Bastions,
and Redoubts, and Ravelings, and Horn-works, (that’s the very word)
and Casemates, or Checkmates, and Crests of Glasses! - - -
“I knew it; a certain cold shiver that I always have when mischief’s
coming, told me as much; the French know all about, Brighton, and
have, at this moment, the addresses of all the best families, with what
money every father can give his daughters, down in their Pocket-books.
“I don't wish to alarm the townspeople; but I must perform my
mission. The French will land here, there's no doubt about that, if
. *...* once here, they’re going to throw up all sorts of things,
so that t
paper before me, (I've MR. STEELPEN’s word for it), to draw, a curtain
clean before the Pavilion; to command High Street with a battery of
brass guns; to build a redoubt right opposite, the playhouse, with a
drawbridge to suffer nobody to go into it! Then, with Horn-work
right before the Town Hall, and angles (as I understood MR.S.) com-
manding the Market House, why frighton has no help for it, but to
kiss the foot of the haughty invader for ever and for ever! . .
“With this fact, Sir, staring us boldly in the face, I do think HER
MAJESTY might be induced to return to the Pavilion. It would so rally
Brighton and the tradespeople about her. People (I only wish they’d
mind their own bisness!) have run down the Pavilion because it’s more
Indian than English. As MR. Mogg sweetly says in his Guide to us,
ey'll never go away again. They intend, according to the
persons who do so “might as reasonably quarrel with the flowers of the
parterre—the lively carnation, or, the painted tulip!’ And then, Sir,
why shouldn't HER MAJESTY, as the Queen of the East Indies, have an
Indian Palace? The sun (as GERKINs used to say), if he would, couldn't
set upon HER MAJESTY's dominions, and why shouldn't she have a
palace—from the Chinese down to the Hottentot—to match, every one
of 'em P But I’m much afraid that public * and public building
won't act with dear GEORGE THE Fourth. If he could only know what
was going on at the Pavilion, I'm sure his loyal and affectionate subjects
would see him again on the Chain Pier—as Meg Merrilies says—by
moonlight. However, Sir, to return to the French.
“I have some hope that I have touched the heart, and struck upon
the cords of Brighton. And, Sir, as one little example is better than
all the talk in the world—(as dear GERKINs said when he knocked down
a brute of a fellow that once insulted me)—I have already put my house
upon the war establishment. . . - -
“I have purchased a fowling-piece and cartridge-box, with a small
sword for JULIUs, the page, a boy of great spirit (you should only see
him, on an errand, j. over the posts; #. of course, as his
mistress, I’m obliged to wink at it). If that boy isn't as good as any
two French grenadiers, English beef and pudding may henceforth go for
nothing. , He's getting on wonderful, too, at the sword exercise; and
on boiled leg-of-mutton days practises a good hour at least “cutting
six' at the turnips.

a set of colours in blood-red cruel, mixed (whatever people may say)
with my own hair; and—and—meanwhile rest—
“Yours to command
"MARY GERKiss.”
“P.S.. I will send you an early copy of the speech, before I present
the flag.”
THE CATNACH COLLECTION.
It is not with the smallest º satisfaction or pride, but rather
the reverse, that Punch announces his having obtained permission from
the proprietor of the celebrated CATNACH Collection, to publish a
series of the principal gems of Art it contains in the pages of this
periodical. - -
Most people who have studied the Ballad Literature of England are
aware that it consists chiefly of a variorum edition, printed on tea-
paper, and sold at a penny for three yards by the vocalists who give
publicity to the productions of our popular minstrels. These effusions
are invariably adorned with a picture, supposed, no doubt, to be appro-
priate to the poetry beneath; and these pictures we have the permission
to engrave in a lump if we like it: or, if we prefer it, in a continuous
series. We had rather get rid of the matter at once, and we there-
fore present some of the choicest specimens of pictorial Art that the
CATNACH Collection affords us the power of selecting.
The annexed engraving
is taken from the original
icture that illustrates the
eautiful ballad of “The
Rose shall cease to blow,”
and the artist, as will be
seen, has treated the subject
in a manner of remarkable
novelty. There is a German
mysticism in the mixed idea
of ceasing and blowin
which is here shadowe
forth; for we are carried
most marvellously to the
contemplation of existence
ceasing and brains blown
out by the picture of the
man letting off the pistol.
Thus, the allegory of the -
rose ceasing to blowishazily
shadowed forth in a style of unintelligibility that almost touches the
sublime by just overstepping the ridiculous.
The second work of Art which we have obtained the Catnachian
sanction to engrave, is the
charming piece of Land-
seerian ife that adorns the
ballad of “I love her, how I
lore her.” In this delicious
bit of Nature, the dog is sup-
posed to be performing some
office of fidelity for some kind
mistress, though we confess
!, the hockey-stick in the dog's
mouth is rather destructive of
the illusion, for it is impro-
bable that a lady would require
such an article, and the words
“I love her, how I love her,”
are consequently slightly inappropriate to the design, which is under-
stood to have been drawn expressly, for them. This, however, is a
mere speck on the sun, or, at most, a blot of ink on the tablecloth.
But to our mind, the last is the loveliest of all, for it gives us the
portrait of a beautiful black cat as an accompaniment to the spirit-
stirring song of “The Soldier who died for his king.” - - - - -
The extreme aptitude of the illustration to the song is in this in-
stance so obvious, that we will not insult our readers by pointing it out
more decidedly. -
A Bishop Afloat.
It is intended, says the Globe, to found a Bishopric somewhere in
the Chinese seas. Britannia has long had a patent fºr ruling the waves
temporally; but now, it seems, we are to reduce them under spiritual
domination. A part of the ocean is to be converted into an episcopal
see. Already we have a floating church on the Thames; but we are
now going to give the Chinese a floating Bishop. We do not know
what to say to this project. A. Bishop cannot be created on shore in
these times without raising a violent storm; and we are warranted in
PEARLS FROM PUNCH*S ALBUM.
IN consequence of the numerous applications made to Punch } Some
of the first fair ones of the land, to contribute scraps to their Albums,
he has resolved to throw open the º: of his own poetical scrap-book
from time to time, and he requests his female tormentors to help them-
selves to any tit-bit they may take a fancy to.
LINES ON A FAWOURITE SPARROW.
Ha! pretty flutterer, pensive bird,
For ever on the wing;
'Tis true ſhy voice is seldom heard,
Nor art thou prone to sing.
Sweet tenant of the cockloſt, come
And share with me the social crumb.
I cannot offer thee a hedge
Wherein to build thy nest,
But on my garret window-ledge
Thou art a welcome guest.
With thee, my sparrow, I will share
My morning muffin—there, boy, there!
[The author opens the window and sprinkles the frag-
ments of his muffin on the sill.]
Why dost thou coyly glide away,
And seek you ń. so flat?
Poor foolish bird, a moment stay-
Thou canst not see the cat.
She seems with deadly purpose ºf: -
Ha! my poor sparrow’s hopp'd the twig.
LINEs. Fort MUSIC.
Come, strike me the º its soul-stirring twang,
The drum shall reply with its hollowest bang;
Up, up in the air with the light tambourine,
And let the dull ophycleide's groan intervene;
For such is our life, lads, a chaos of sounds,
Through which the gay traveller actively bounds. . .
With the voice of the public the statesman must chime,
And change the key-note, boys, exactly in time;
The lawyer will coolly his client survey,
As an instrument merely whereon he can play.
Then harp, drum, and cymbals together shall clang,
With a loud tooral lira, right tooral, bang bang.
oN A REJECTED NOSEGAY, OFFERED BY THE AUTHOR. To A BrauTIFUL
YOUNG LADY, WHO RETURNED IT.
What! then you won't accept it, won't you? Oh!
No matter; pshaw! my heart is breaking, though.
My bouquet is rejected; let it be:
For what am I to you, or you to me?
'Tis true, I once had hoped; but now, alas !
Well, well; 'tis over now, and let it pass.
I was a fool—perchance fam so still ;
You won't accept it! Let me dream you will:
But that were idle. Shall we meet again?
Why should we ? - Water for my burning brain!
I could have loved thee—Could ! I love thee yet;
Can only Lethe teach me to forget?
Qblivion's balm, oh tell me where to find!
Is it a tenant of the anguish'd mind?
Or is it?—ha! at last I see it come;
Waiter! a bottle of your oldestrum.
Pantomime Distress.
In consequence of the falling off in the attraction of Pantomimes,
there are at this moment supposed to be three hundred Clowns out of
employ, and two hundred pairs of Pantaloons, besides an enormous
sprinkling of Sprites, and an unusual number of Harlequins. A large
shipment of Clowns' dresses to New Zealand has just been effected, in
the hope that the native chiefs may adopt the costume for which there
is now so little demand in this country.
THE MECCA or ENGLAND.
THERE is a curious analogy between our own Canterbury and the
Holy City of the Mussulmen., Canterbury, like Mecca, was formerly
the annual resort of pilgrims. At Mecca the dead MAHomeT is said to
remain suspended in his coffin midway between two loadstones. At
anticipating the greatest *. to shipping from the tempest which
will be excited by the establishment of a prelate on the deep,
Canterbury we have a living Archbishop in a state of equilibrium,
between the opposite attractive forces of a mandamus and a praemundre.

COMFORT IN SHAVING.
SHAVING is not exactly comfortable in summer, but, in winter, it
comes before us with a two-fold horror. The first man who invented a
razor must have been a monster, whose name ought to have been pre-
served for the unanimous desecration of bearded generations. How:
ever, as we cannot remove the nuisance from our chins, we may as well
be as good-tempered—if our razor will only allow us—over, it, as
possible. We throw out a notion, which any philanthropist, or barber
may improve upon for the good of suffering humanity. We want a
coverlid which shall enable us to shave in bed. Two small holes for
the arms would do it; and with a hook-and-eye to fasten round the
neck, the desideratum is complete. We hope the advertising carts will
convince us in a week, that our notion has not been wasted. We are
sure the new “Patent Easy Shaving Coverlid” will shortly be ordered
to lie on every gentleman's bed.
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR. BRIEFLESS.
CHAPTER THE THIRD.
IN the army, glory is won at the point of the sword, but at the Bar
ou must begin to cut your way to fame and fortune with a dinner-
{...". It would form a very curious problem for solution to inquire how
much must necessarily be eaten as a qualification for the Bar, and
whether it might not be allowable for a student to distinguish himself
by eating off-hand, in a few sittings, the whole amount of food he is
expected to consume in the course of the sixty dinners which, at the
rate of three per term during a period of five years, he is expected to
devour. I have heard medical students talk of the difficulties of cram-
ming to pass the College or the Hall, but the only cramming necessary
for the Bar is of a ...i. festive and agreeable character.
I suspect that the dinners required as a preparation for the Bar were
originally designed to accustom the student to those tremendous
Digests with which he must, in time, become familiar. An old punster,
now happily deceased, hazarded the wretched conceit that the dinners
were rendered imperative by way of hinting to the student that he
might, in time, look for his desert; but as the desert never comes, this
cannot be said to follow. A later and better authority (myself, is
inclined to the opinion, that the dinners are designed to have the same
sort of effect upon the legal student as the gaieties into which she plunges
before taking leave of the world are intended to have upon the future
nun; and that while in her case a last farewell to the busy scenes of
life is gone through, the º martyr is supposed to be bidding a long
adieu to his dinners, if he has got nothing but his profession to depend
upon. -
Having been duly admitted a Member of an Inn of Court, I became
entitled to the privilege of going through the process of becoming what
reading, which he points out as the best method of acquiring the f
ness he is so greatly enraptured with. Never shall I forget the delight
with which I devoured the first mouthful that was to open my eyes to
the mysteries of legal science. As the first course went away, I
thought I was getting a glimmering of remainders; and as the captain
of the mess carved out a special interest in the moderate-sized whiting
for himself, I perceived how each in turn became a mortgagee in
session, and I wondered what would be left for me as tenant in tail of
the residue. --
It has sometimes occurred to me, what hopeful law students would
be met with in those voracious individuals whose performances upon
legs of mutton with their vegetable appurtenances are recorded under
the not very complimentary heading of “Disgusting Feat” in the news-
papers. A cormorant who can get through in an hour as much eating
as a student at an Inn of Court is required to accomplish within a year,
ought to be looked upon as capable of dispensing with the pigtaſi
annorum lucubrationes which are tº: to persons of ordinary
capacity. By the way, the term “ordinary capacity” is very happily
applied, for it is at a series of ordinaries that the ſoundation of all future
legal acquirement is laid.
Though eating is the only operation necessary for coming to the Bar,
if the alimentary process is to be continued after the position of a bar.
rister is gained, a great deal of reading in addition to the feeding will
be found absolutely indispensable. My reading, previous to my entering
on the career of studentship, had been . miscellaneous. I was
familiar with Crusoe, but had never heard of CRUIse, or his Digest : and
The Boy's Own Book, pondered over from the time when I was a mere
chit, might be considered my substitute for Chitty's General Practice.
I knew nothing of the nature of a bond but what I had learned from
Shylock; and Othello's speech to the Senate was, in my opinion, the per-
ſection of pleading, which MR. SERGEANT STEPHEN, who I always
fancied was a military man, had taken for his model.
It was necessary, therefore, that, in the course of reading I was about
to commence, I should have a counsellor and guide, and I chose for
my guide a counsellor, who, though a junior at the Bar, was a few years
my senior... I made an arrangement with this gentleman to read with
him, and he kindly offered me the “run of his papers,” with the
privilege of looking into every case in his chambers. I soon found that
the most interesting case was the bookcase, which contained one
volume of law to twenty of literature; for amidst a whole set of the
Marerley Novels there would be found a professional treatise, just to
give to the entire lot a learned flavour. R. friend was not insensible
to appearances, for he had put poor SHAKSPEARE into law, calf, to
make him look as legal as possible, and the table was loaded with large
bundles of paper tied up with red, tape, which, as the communications
of my instructor became more confidential, I discovered to be dummies.
My eye had frequently been caught by the large endorsement—
(C W itſ, jou,
f - . . .
j le Juttowey Generaf >
and I at last ventured to ask when the Attorney-General was coming
or how long he had been gone, for I had never seen any symptoms 5}
that association which was blazoned forth on the brief in the most
imposing characters. My learned friend subsequently confessed to me,
that the grand combination of talent which the words “h'ith YoU, the
Attorney-General,” disclosed, was a little idea of his own, and was
merely meant to illustrate the old proverb that “Union is Strength,” in
the eyes of such clients as might happen to pay him a visit.
We read together at first very assiduously, and he had succeeded in
cramming about half a bushel of Coke down my throat, when I set the
example of endeavouring to relieve the dulness of the subject by occa-
sional conversation. I found my friend very ready to follow me into
my digressions, and we habitually got from the learning of past times
to the more entertaining small talk of the present. This, however, is a
subject requiring—like Lord Nelson or the Duke of York—a column
at least, to itself, and I will therefore postpone it until the next chapter,
Exotics in Scotland.
WE learn from the Daily News, that the Caledonian Horticultural
Society propose to make “a glass-inclosed winter, garden,” wherein
shall be cultivated “the most rare Exotics:” it will also form “a brumal
romenade.” . Some fine specimens of carrots have already been sent
rom England, and it is hoped that, “glass-inclosed,” they may brave
the winter. Turnips, endive, beet-root, and savoys are also to be tried;
but we understand-upon the authority of DR. LINDLEY himself—that
he has great doubts whether the delicacy of these Exotics can survive
the rigour of the glazed garden. As lovers of our fellow-creatures, an
admirers of vegetables at large, it will afford us satisfaction to find the
Doctor mistaken. He, however, gives great hopes that, in a
* I take it for granted that my readers are aware of the fact, that the only qualifica-
tion required for going to the Bar—beyond the payment of the fees—is the sitting down
ot a certain number of dinners in the hall of the Inn to which the student has been
admitted.

TYRTAE U.S. RE DIVI v U S ;
OR, WAR-SONGS FOR ALL CLASSES.
YRTAEUs, our readers are doubt-
less aware, was a blind
schoolmaster, whom the
Athenians sent to the
Spartans in mockery, when
the Delphian Oracle bade
the latter seek a general
from the former. The
schoolmaster could not fight,
but he could sing; so he
took to writing war-songs
so spirited, that they roused
the Spartan soldiers to a
valour which nothing could
resist.
Now Punch is a school-
master, though not blind.
He intends to turn his baton
from breaking heads to
beating time, and that to a
tune calculated to raise
British º above, proof.
He ten herewith his
volunteer Little Warbler,
the songs to be set to an
accompaniment of drums
and fifes, and sung about
the streets when the French
invade us. Walour will thus
be retailed at three yards a
- - - penny. As FLETCHER of
Saltoun, said, “Give us the making of a nation's ballads, and let who
will make their laws.” As a coup d'essai, here is our
WAR-SONG FOR THE UNITED CORPS OF CABMEN.
Be firm upon your stand, boys,
The badge of valour show;
And range along the Strand, boys,
To chaff the advancing foe!
We’ll give it to them HANsoM-ly,
Thro' their ranks we'll cut away;
Friends may resist our charges,
But we’ll make the Frenchman pay.
Each Cabman, ere he backs a foot,
On the box shall find his bier;
And every gallant Waterman
Shall kick the bucket here.
Then close your ranks, brave comrades,
The onset boldly darel
Rememb'ring the old proverb,
“Faint heart ne'er won the fare.”
WAR-SONG FOR THE PAWNBROKERS.
Come, pledge yourselves, brave Pawnbrokers! your houses, stocks, and
Wlwes
At a tremendous sacrifice to offer up your lives:
The haughty foe with interest pay off at each advance,
And send three balls in answer to every one of France.
Think of the ties of family, remembering that you
If not i. a band of brothers, are a band of uncles true;
Your pledges still are unredeemed, until the foe's in rout:
Then bravely pop away at them, while fire your batteries spout.
Prove 'tis no exaggeration what your customers all say,
That who once falls in your clutches can never get away;
And º off the foemen, nor of spirit bate a particle,
Till they find Britannia mettle to be quite the genuine article.
WAR-SONG OF THE UNITED TEMPLARs, or OLD NICK's own.
CoME, all you Temple heroes,
Who practise at the Bar,
And teach the French invaders
What British actions are.
Allow of modemurrer
On the score of funk or fears,
But the Frenchmen show what’s the Roe, Doe, Doe,
Of the Temple volunteers.
The sword that Justice carries
She’ll lend unto her sons,
When your reports of cases
Yield to reports of guns.
With stern assault and battery,
Come down about their ears,
And they’ll run, we know, from the Roe, Doe, Doe,
Of the Temple Volunteers.
If # the Thames they venture,
The Temple’s in the way;
There your appearance enter,
And challenge their array.
Once #: their nobs in Chancery,
- And there they’ll stay for years,
Till the costs they know of the Roe, Doe, Doe,
Of the Temple Volunteers.
Give none a locus standi
That the Channel ventures o'er,
Arrest them in mesne process—
Eject them from our shore!
Ye still can draw the long-bow,
As at Cressy and Poictiers,
And your skill ye owe to the Roe, Doe, Doe,
Of the Temple Volunteers.
The long bills of our ancestors
You still know how to wield;
Full many a well-fought action
Hath trained you for the field;
And speedy execution
Each rash defendant fears,
When down on the foe, with their Roe, Doe, Doe,
Come the Temple Volunteers.
Hear no plea in abatement
While one foe rests alive;
For, with intent felonious, .
By force and arms they strive
Against our Sovereign Lady's peace,
As wilful trespasseres;
As you’ll let them know, with the Roe, Doe, Doe,
Of the Temple Volunteers.
GOLDEN GLEANINGS.
“We believe,” says the Daily News, ºthere is now a probability of a
sweeping reform being applie to the ill-managed and expensive esta-
blishment called the Mint.” We should be very glad to have some of
the sweepings of this reform, as Mint-dust, we should imagine, must
be valuable. We heard lately of an establishment in which gold and
silver are largely used, and of which the proprietors make some £300
a-year out of the washings of their workmen's hands. We would direct
the attention of the servants of some of our millionaires to the contents
of their masters' wash-hand-basins, which, considering the deal of money
that passes through the hands of those capitalists, are, we think, very
imprudently thrown away. We would also suggest that the linings of
the pockets of the same gentlemen, properly treated, may yield a con-
siderable quantity of the precious metals; and thus, we flatter our-
i. we have opened an entirely new mine of perquisites to their
ootmen.
How to Ascertain the Depth of Snow.
TAKE a place in a third-class railway carriage, and if it snows very
strongly, you wi able to measure, off your own person, the exact
depth of snow, Persons fond of this experiment, however, are advised
to stand upright, or else the calculation cannot be ascertained with
that accuracy which is so necessary for the proper liquidation of
scientific problems.

THE FIRST sam PLER o F THE INvAs I on.
THE fair spinsters of
Arachne House, Clapham,
have been putting their
needles together for the
purpose of presenting F.M.
the DUKE OF WELLINGTON
with a beautiful sampler
upon the promised inva-
sion. The result is before
the reader. We are only
sorry we cannot favour
him with a view of the
gorgeous colours that have
been stitched into it to
give it every possible rich-
ness. The rainbow might
borrow a hint from it.
TURNER even would be
dazzled, and would confess
with a sigh that one of
his great pictorial riddles
looked pale and dingy by
the side of it. The cannons,
for instance, are pink; the
balls red; and the lion is
blushing a violent crimson
all over, with the ex-
ception of his mane, which
is a light green. The
Sampler, we believe, has
been hung in the gallery
of the F.M. at Apsley
House. The Duke was
heard to exclaim with
pathos, when he looked at
it, “We’ll now proceed
to dinner;” and he rang
the bell accordingly, and
ordered JoHN “to serve
up.” We give this as a
positive fact. The artist
of the above Sampler is the
drawing-master of Arachne
House, and we have a par-
ticular pleasure in men-
tioning that his name is
BaowN—we mean, John
BROWN.

respectable contemporary the Legal Qbserver, we have taken the liberty
of transcribing some of them and º: them in the hands of our
learned friend MR. BRIEFLess, for the purpose of getting answers put
to them. He has dashed off, with his usual combination of brilliancy
and research, the following responses, which, in the language of a
theatrical tag, we hope “all our kynde young friends” will not fail to
take a lessson from.
I.—Preliminary.
Q. Where º serve your clerkship 2
4. Partly at MR. GRABALL's, in Clifford's Inn, partly at the Casino,
partly in Cremorne Gardens, &c., &c. (as the case may be).
Q. Mention some of the law-books which you have read and studied.
A. The Comic Blackstone, the Law of Kindness, the Laws of Cricket,
the comic song of L-A-W law, &c., &c.
II.-Common and Statute Law, and Practice of the Courts.
Q: What do you understand by the words, Common Law P
A. I understand it to be that sort of Law which is so very common
as to make it difficult to be kept out of.
Q. How long does a writ of summons remain in force—how may it
be continued—and on what days and at what hours can it be served?
4. It remains in force until the would-be server is himself served
out, and induced, either by persuasion or the º to abandon his
mission. It may be continued as long as the }. likes to go on
º for more, when the first has proved ineffectual. The days and
ours when it may be served are immaterial, until the requisition,
“First catch your man,” is complied with.
Q. #. an appearance according to the statute.
4. en a man is reduced to beggary by the law, and has become
so seedy that he is ashamed to be seen, his plight may be called an
appearance according to the statute.
How is a distress made for rent?
A. By adding to the distress of the parties who cannot pay their
rent, by augmenting their family expenses with the cost of a man in
possession.
Q: What is an attachment?
A. The affectionate grasp with which an attorney fastens upon the
pocket of his client.
IIL–Conveyancing.
Q. What is equity of redemption? -
4. The privilege of taking a hat out of pledge, or rescuing your
mother's flat-iron from the custody of your uncle.
Q. How are copyhold estates usually alienated . .
X. By being melted away in litigation, and falling into the hands of
the lawyers.
Q. How is an estate in coparcenery created ? and what persons are
usually coparceners? -
A. An estate in coparcenery is created when four friends enter a
coffee-house and call for one cup of coffee with four saucers, when the
coffee, at once becomes an estate in coparcenery. Some authorities
have held that two clergymen officiating in the same parish are co-
parcen-ers. (Oh!) -
Q. A. conveys by bargain and sale a fee-simple estate to B. and his
heirs to the use of C. and his heirs. What estates, legal or equitable,
do B. and C. respectively take * -
A. What they can get after the lawyers have done with the property.
. old rule is, that the former take each a shell, and the latter the
oyster.
GALLIPOT COMPANIONS.
At a festival held last week at Caius College, Cambridge, in celebra:
tion of the five hundredth anniversary of the foundation of that seat of
learning, after the usual loyal and other toasts, the Rev. J. J. SMITH
proposed “Physic,” and, strange as it may seem that such a thing
should have been done at a convivial meeting, Physic was actually
drunk by the company. In what terms MR. SMITH's speech was
couched, we do not know; perhaps they were some such as these-
“Gentlemen, allow me to propose you a toast. When I mention health,
ou will all admit that I allude to the greatest of sublunary blessings.
am sure, then, you will agree with me that we are all more or less
interested in the toast I am about to propose. I beg pardon, gentlemen,
I should rather say to prescribe. . Gentlemen, with a view to our better
healths, if you please, we’ll drink Physic; and much good may it do
us.” Had any vocalists been present, one of them might, or would, or
could, or should have obliged the company with an appropriate song;
as, for instance, with the following:-
A bumper of febrifuge fill fill for me;
Give those who prefer it black draught;
But whatever the dose, it a strong one must be
Though ourist dose to night hall be quaffºd
And while Influenza attacks high and low,
And man's queerest feelings oppress him -
Mouths-making, nose-holding, round, round let it go,
Drink our Physic and Founder—ugh bless him!

Mouths-making, nose-holding, round, round let it go,

We give the two letters; the Emir's being in italics, the officer's

It is high time that we should cease to apply the term private, to a
soldier in the ranks; for if there is any one comfort enjoyed by our
common soldiery, it is certainly, not that of privacy. At the inquest
lately held at Leeds on the body of MARGARET GARRARD, a soldier's
wife, who was shot at Leeds Barracks by MICHAEL Stokes, one of her
husband's comrades, a very striking proof of this assertion transpired
in the course of the evidence.
“WILLIAM GARRARD, the husband of the deceased, said—“I am a private in the 57th
Regiment. MICHAEL Stokes is a private in the same regiment. Since webave been in
Leeds, Srokes has slept in the sameroom with me and my wife.”
Speaking of Sir John Falstaff, “How doth the ſº knight?” asks
Justice Shallow of Bardolph. " May I ask how my lady his wife doth *
“Sir, pardon,” answers Bardolph ; “a soldier is better accommodated
than with a wife.” Assuredly, a soldier with a wife cannot be worse
“accommodated” than he appears to be, in the British Army. A
bivouac must be a paradisein comparison with the dormitory of WILLIAM
and MARGARET GARBARD at Leeds. The cold might-air and frozen dew
are physically unpleasant; but they are not abhorrent and revolting to
the moral sense.
We believe it is one of the DUKE of WELLINGTON's aphorisms, that
a man who is particular about religion has no business to be a soldier.”
It would seem that a regard for common decency, a state of feeling
above that of an animal, are equally incompatible with the militar
profession. Qtherwise, the married soldier could never endure suc
“accommodations” as those provided for him at Leeds Barracks; and,
what is more to the purpose, they would never have been permitted by
those in authority over him. WiLLIAM GARRARD, we observe, wore a
stripe, by way of distinction as a “good-conduct man.”
As a reward for his good conduct, we, presume, he was allowed to
marry; and being married, to be thus “accommodated with a wife.”
How long would such a state of things be tolerated in Officers' quarters?
Or rather, how much longer will Head-quarters permit its existence?
If it is really expedient to degrade and brutalise the soldier, well and
good. Revive flogging, and continue a r tion which is even better
calculated to effect that purpose; or else let his back and his feelings
too be defended from laceration. Great pains are taken to make him
hold up his head like a man. Put an end to a system which, treating
him as a brute, seems intended to reduce him to grovel on all-fours.

We understand the nature of his complaint was elephantiasis—adisease

thought, materially accelerated by the excitement of his recent presen-

strongest constitution. His physical powers continued, however, unim-

ALSATIA RESTORED.
THERE is an awful NEMESIs who hovers over the Domain of Law, and
those who practise therein. She has last week interposed her terrors
between the Temple and the officials of the County Courts. She
stands on the threshold of the sanctuary of Dear Law, and says to
Cheap Law, “Enter not. Procul, O procul este, profani /*
The Temple, to drop the aid of metaphor and LEMPRIERE, has been
declared to be exempt from the jurisdiction of the County Courts Act.
MR. DUNUP may get credit right and left, if he can, to any amount
below £20,and snap his fingers at law, as law has hitherto snapped her
fingers at him, unless his creditors are frantic enough to venture into
a superior Court. -
Are we not right to call this the work of a Legal NEMEsis. Cheap
aw may triumph everywhere else; but her arm falls powerless in the
Temple, as evil spirits are paralysed on consecrated ground,
The old Alsatia is revived in the Temple. London can still boast
one Debtors' Sanctuary and Duns' Bºiel Not even that most
persevering of creditors, the Duns Scotus or Scotch Dun, who has won
a name in history for his subtlety and, acuteness, can penetrate within
.*::: unless at an expense which, as an economist, he is certain
not to ris
Since the above fact has been made known, MR. DUNUP has flung
open his outer door. The deceitful ticket, “At Westminster,” or “In
Judge's Chambers,” or “Qn Circuit,” has been taken down, and our
eyes are no longer saluted by the ºil. of that persevering trades-
man who used to be seen seated in his garden-chair for hours on the
landing in front of MR. DUNUP's inhospitable “ oak,” grimly taking
his meals there, out of a basin brought by his children. There is only
one thing to be tºº. the total stoppage of credit to the nume-
rous family of the DUNUPs. We need not say that such an event
would be even worse than a stoppage of credit in the commercial world.
The panic, however, is as yet, we are happy to say, confined to creditors.
MR. DUNUP may be said to be whitewashed, and exults in the fact.
The sanguine yo man forgets that the whitewash only conceals an
appalling nudity. It is true he need not now dread his old creditors,
but he cannot possibly create any new ones.
OUR NATIVE LANGUAGE IN DANGER OF INVASION:
MANY persons have complained that they could see no fun in the late
lengthy proceedings in the Court of Queen's Bench relative to the
confirmation of DR, HAMPDEN. We do not agree with them. We
think, some of the English-French, or French-English, quoted in the
pleadings, exceedingly i. We subjoin a specimen of the jargon to
which we have alluded:—
“Et MoUNTAGUE dit que ceo letter le Roy ne fuit authority; mes signification del
pleasure le Roy. FletchER ne est question, et ceo fuit grant del auter part, que Roy
poit fayre evesque sans election del deane et chap. per quo Bale est bon evesque. Etle
Court teigne ceo cleere, et ne voyle ceo traver in question, care est prerogative le Roy in
cest part.”
But, although it may be all very well to laugh at this gibberish, its
erusal may also suggest a serious reflection. In the event of our
É. invaded by Joinville THE CONQUEROR, and of our country being
reduced to a French province, we may conjecture, from the foregoing
horrible stuff, what will become of our English language. Oh, shade of
LINDLEY MURRAY! Oh, ghosts of BLAIR and DR. JoHNson How
happy are ye in being ghosts and shades, since your eyes, at least, are
for º secure from j. so horrible a corruption of your native
tongue!
The Use of Chloroform.’
We think that this valuable invention is too much limited in its
application, for there are thousands of circumstances of every-day life,
in which, # insensibility could be produced, the d effect would be
obvious. It is not everybody who stands in need of a surgical opera-
tion, and the restriction of Chloroform to matters of the kind is con-
sequently a great curtailment of the advantages of the new discovery.
We are sure that if Chloroform were always sold with new boots, it
would greatly add to the comfort of trying them on; and “Chloroform
for easy shaving” would be a popular announcement in the window of
any barber. In schools where the antiquated practice of flagellation
still prevails, if it is only the warning and disgrace that are the objects
of the brutal ceremony, the use of Chloroform would redeem the opera.
tion from the charge of cruelty, without depriving the punishment of its
assumed efficacy on the grounds specified.

A MODEL GOVERNESS.
[EspecTABLY connected, young,
accomplished, but poor, is the
Model Governess. She closes
the door against all acquaint-
ances and relations the moment
she enters her situation, and as
for friends, she loses them all
—forgets in time the very name
of one; for who ever heard of
a Governess with friends? She
never goes out, and is allowed
no visitors. To be perfect, she
should be ugly. oe betide
her, if she be pretty! The
mother suspects her, the young
ladies hate her, and even the
ladies'-maid cannot “abide her.”
Her beauty only exposes her to
compliments and attentions from
the guests, and, this makes the
oung ladies all the more jea-
º: and the mother all the
more irate against her. The
young gentlemen of the house,
also, persist in flirting with her,
and this rouses the suspicions
and sneers of the old gentle-
man. He accuses her of making
love, of “laying traps” for his sons, and of being “an artful, designing thing.”
She bears all without a murmur, and never retorts. It is her sad situation to be always sus-
pected. A letter cannot come to her by the post, but it instantly raises a storm of uncharitable
surmises—in fact, anything like a correspondence is highly improper, and forbidden accordingly.
Her drawings and paintings, elicit loud encomiums, but they are all showered on the youn
i. i. ave put their initials in the corner: the Model Governess is not thought of, muc
ess praised.
A kind word has such a strange effect upon her that it frequently makes her run up to her
room, where she hides herself and cries bitterly, yet joyfully. It is very curious, she is never
ill—at least, she never confesses to it... Her dress, of course, must, be, of the very plainest.
All light colours are prohibited as strictly as cousins. . It is all the better, in fact, if she
wears caps. A pair of spectacles, also, enhance the claims of a Model Governess, especially
if she is not more than twenty. Šhe must not mind being told once a week that she is eating
the “bread of dependence; -- - -
rather difficult to say what that station is . It is not the drawing-room, it is not the kitchen,
nor is it the young ladies' room. It must be the landing-place.
Children are her especial delight; they tell tales against her, outvie one another in teasing
her; play little practical jokes, peculiar to juvenile geniuses, with her work-box and desk.
The *: e life of the Governess is a living sermon upon the holy text of the forgiveness of
injuries. Her amusements are few; for singing cannot be called singing when it is done by
command, and dancing is but sorry º: when you are requested to dance merely to fill up
a side-couple. Her accomplishments, however, are manifold, though exercised for the
benefit of others.
She is an Encyclopædia in bombazeen, which must be ready to be referred to at a moment's
notice by every one in the house upon every possible and impossible science, including the very
latest improvements, corrections, and additions that may have taken place in philosophy,
poetry, or puddings. She plays the harp, piano, and accordeon; teaches calisthenics and hair-
curling; dances the newest fashionable dances, from Bohemia or Abyssinia; understands
flºº. and dress-making; is clever at Berlin wool-work; in short, must have every
emale accomplishment at her fingers’ ends. She knows eight or ten languages, but mustn't
talk unless spoken to. Her greatest talent should be ii. in listening cleverly. Her
sympathy should be all upon one side, like the Irishman's unanimity. She must have no views
of her own, but only reflect, like a looking glass, those of the person who is consulting her.
Her whole life is a heritage of petty meannesses. She has not the consideration that is paid to
a cook, and very frequently not half the wages that are paid to a housemaid; in fact, the house-
maid has the advantage of the two, for she is entitled at least to a month's warning, whereas
the poor Governess is often dismissed at a moment's notice...The Model Governess is literally
; tºtal work of fashionable society. Ladies, think of your own daughters, and treat

M
OUR IRISH PRIZE BULL.
THE Irish translation of “Union is Strength,” runs, “ Divide et impera.”
“Repeal of the Union” is a monstrous practical Bull; it grew out of a long line of such
Bulls, and has produced a numerous progeny, like their parent. Its head-quarters are in
Conciliation , so called because those who meet in it are always quarrelling. It embodies
itself in an “Association,” so called because no two members of it but are dissociated in views
and opinions.
. The original Repeal Association was a bit of furniture manufactured out of the old seasoned
timber of the arch Agitator and his clique, and the greenwood of Young Ireland. It naturally
warped and cracked in the heat of debate, agitation, and discussion. The cracks were
and, above all, she must “know her station,” though it is W
glued, and puttied, and warnished by that King
of vampers, the late , DANIEL O'Connelſ.
The rotten fabric looked yery imposing, while
glue, putty, and varnish did their office. But a
crack is a crack!—It soon widened to a split.
The Young Ireland leg came off, one fine
*: after a hotter fire of words than usual.
And thenceforward Old Ireland and Young
Ireland had each their own Association. There
were two original little Dust-pans in the field,
each warning the passers by that it had no con-
nection with the *. shop over the way.
The Conciliation Hall concern continued to deal
in unredeemed pledges, flummery, tricks, jobs
quirks, quiddets, and quibbles. The Young reland
establishment paraded the more formidable wares
of sedition and violence. MR. John Q'Connell
vainly solicits custom for the original depôt, while
John of Tuam bawls at the door, as touter in
chief, brazen and brainless, shameless and fluent,
as a touter should be, MEAGHER, DuFFY & Co.
resided (for some time harmoniously) over the
'oung Ireland counter, with its imposing array
of pikes and blunderbusses, slugs j -
powder. The two concerns abused each other,
of course, and filled their windows with placards,
each charging his rival, and late F. with
every crime conceivable by the Irish mind.
And so closes split the first... Young Ireland
next gets * a “Confederation,” which of course
shows the Bull blood in it, by at once ..f
to pieces; and this brings about split the second.
And lastly, the spirited firm of MEAGHER, DUFFY
MITCHELL, and Brothers, begins to warp and
gape, and crack like its predecessors. -
...And lo, now!, the one are three—each with
his ownNº. MR. Durry sticks by The
Nation, . MEAGHER invests in The Southern
Reporter, and MR, MITCHELL, who is by the
ears with everybody, and wishes everybody to
be by the ears, starts. The United Irishmen.
so the last of these Bulls is greater than the first.
. Thus runs the genealogy of this characteris-
tically-named organ. Old Ireland quarrels with
Young Ireland; the Association splits; and The
ſation grows out of the gap.
Physical force in %. quarrels with physical
force in esse ; The Nation is divided and The
United Irishmen rises on his Bull out of this split
of a split of a split.
We beg to propose to MR. MITCHELL, and any
of his friends, he may not yet have quarrelled
with, this problem— How many disunited parties
are required to make a United Irishman?
The Repealers have certainly repealed one Union
—their Union with each other.
THE CUTLER'S LAMENT.
INEVER wrote up “Skates to sell,”
Trusting to fickle Nature's law,
But—when I’d advertised them well,
And puffed them—it was sure to thaw.
Yes, it was ever thus—the Fates
Seem adverse to the trade in skates.
If #: I chanced to buy,
T g’twas likely still to freeze,
Up the thermometer would fly—
All in a day—some ten degrees.
Their presence in my window-pane
Turns ice to mud, and snow to rain.
A Dungeon Keep.
THE French have broken their word, but they

easier to keep than the other. If the Oll,
however, at this faithless rate, they º §§ it

THE GREAT CLOCK MOVEMENT.
Greenwich Clock, log. “Come, No stopping—you must Move on.”
THERE has lately been an attempt to heal the melancholy differences
existing in the Clock family; and their respectable head at Greenwich
has been pointed out to them as a proper example for them all to be
ided by. We regret exceedingly that the Clocks of England cannot
É. to act all alike, but that, in the eagerness of some to advance
themselves, while others hang back, there should be a disagreement of
the most serious character amongst them. In fact, it has almost
become proverbial that scarcely two are of the same mind, and quot
horlogia tot tempora will soon be as well established a proverb as quot
homines tot sententiae. -
We wish the disputatious Clocks, who contradict. each other so con-
tinually, would recollect and profit by the affecting lines of old Doctor
Watts-his-NAME, who tells children—and why not Clocks?—that
“their little hands were never made” for hostile purposes. We
really do not know what to propose with the view of establishing
harmony amongst the Clock fraternity. It is said that all the Clocks
in England are to be corrected until they conform to the rules observed
by that most respectable of all Clocks, who lives in his snug little box
at Greenwich; but this wholesale scheme of correction seems to us
very difficult of accomplishment. We presume that refractory Clocks
found keeping irregular hours, will, after this notice, be...sent to the
House of Correction in their respective neighbourhoods, We are unable
to guess the cause of this very distressing state of things among the
Clock tribes, which are enough to drive Old Time out of mind; but if
we may hazard an opinion, we should be inclined to say that the wheels
within wheels, which complicate the arrangements of all the Clock
family, may have something to do with their unhappy divisions.
Contrary Winds.
THE boy—or Professor, as he calls himself—who blows the organ at
St. Stephen's Church, Walbrook, has announced his intention of dis-
continuing that healthy weekly exercise, unless his salary, is regularly
paid., Touse the Professor's own emphatic words, he says “he’s blowed
if he blows any longer for muffin at all.” There is a complete panic in
the loft in consequence. The organ has been sounded by the vestry,
who have been endeavouring to play upon it for their own purposes;
but it is evident it will not be a tool, much less an instrument, in their
hands. It remains passive under every blow, and will certainly, go
altogether, if there is no one qualified to stop it. The bellows luckily
are quiet.
FALSE REPORTS.
It is not true that ABD-El-KADER is engaged by MR. WEBSTER, at
the Haymarket, to enact the part of the Invisible Prince, a character he
sustained for so long a time on the stage of French politics.
M. JULLIEN, the present lessee of Drury Lane, who has gone away to
the North to give promenade concerts, is not the celebrated JULIAN the
Apostate spoken of in Roman History. -
The MR. BRookE now acting at the Olympic is not the RAJAH OF
SARAWAK.
A Queer File.
We are continually seeing advertisements for complete sets of old
Hº: and we believe large sums are frequently given for a perfect
file of an established paper. , Now there is a better plan than this for
securing an old newspaper. A person has only to subscribe to a journal
for a twelvemonth, and the Post-Office will take very good care
that, before the papers reach him, they shall be, as old, and as far
removed from their original date, as the most greedy antiquarian could
wish. There is only one drawback upon this excellent plan, and that
is, the papers sometimes never reach the subscriber at all. But this is
* that will occur, of course, in the worst-regulated Post-
CeS.
A TREASURE-TROWE FOR NEWSPAPERS.
Of all the wonders in Natural History that generally take the run
of the news %. during the closing of Parliament, we wonder that
no provinci erald, or uncivilised Chronicle, in the dangerous soli-
tudes of Ireland, has, yet recorded the extraordinary virtues of the
Gutta Percha Tree. This is an oversight, which has only to be pointed
out, we are sure, to be instantly followed up by a whole Bushy Forest
of similar miracles. We make the country press a present of the
following º on condition of their inserting in their paper the
name of their generous donor. If we do a charity, we like, at least,
to have it acknowledged—or else, where is the use of doing it?
ARRon Gutta Percha.-A Genuine Boot-Tree.
“AN Astonishing FAct For NATURALIsts—A gentleman who is
strongly imbued with the spirit of experiments—having devoted ten
years of his life to the trial whether it is not possible to pickle herrings
alive—has just succeeded in introducing into this country the Gutta
Percha Tree. He bought a double sole of this strange, but true'
material, and Nº. it in his little garden, in front of his humble
abode in the New Road. What was his astonishment, a few weeks
afterwards, to see a Boot-Tree gradually rise out of the fertile soil
and bud with a perfect pair of little children’s shoes! These blossome

A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.
Those jolly old dogs, the Elder Brothers of the Trinity, have deter.
mined to turn the statue of NElson at Yarmouth into a lighthouse.
We presume, of course, that the illumination, cannot be placed on the
top of the figure, for this would infer at once that he was light-headed;
and the only mode we see, therefore, of effecting the object in view, is
to place a bull's-eye in the hero's belt, after the fashion adopted by our
metropolitan policemen. As this would be alittle out of character with
the naval costume, we recommend a change at once to the dress of the
police force; and a judicious arrangement of the cape on the shoulders
will convert it into a sort of shade above the lanthorn, which will ad
materially to its powers of reflection.
We hope the Committee of the NELson Monument in London will
e an example from the Yarmouth people, and begin to turn to some
use that which will never be acknowledged as an ornament. . If NELsoN
at Charing-Cross could be made to act as a sort of mechanical self-
acting time-keeper for all the omnibuses that pass by his base, he
would, indeed be a valuable acquisition to the metropolis, and he would
save the necessity for those rash attempts at taking notes in little
memorandum-books, which we constantly see made by men who are
pushed about in the most unceremonious manner by the crowds of
passengers.
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR. BRIEFLESS.
CHAPTER THE FOURTH.
ELEMENTARY INITIATION INTo THE PRACTICE of THE courts, AND THE
HABIT OF TAKING NOTES.
I was now regularly installed as a student of the law in the chambers
of my forensic friend, a promising junior of five-and-twenty years'
standing, who was always understood to be likely some day or {t}. to
“come out.” I see no reason for concealing his name, which I am
sure he will be delighted to see in print; and I therefore announce him
at once as MR. BALDERDAsh. He was the author of an elaborate
treatise on the “Right of Widows to Free Bench,” and had written an
article in a legal periodical on the “Rise, Progress, Uses, Abuses,
Stringencies, and Contingencies, of the Rule to Compute.”
MR. BALDERDASH was a constant attendant in Court during Term,
and was always present at the sitting of the Court of Exchequer, for
the gratification of bowing to their Lordships as they entered.
BAIDERDASH seldom an º of doing more than bowing
and shaking his head when the form of going through the Bar was
observed; but when it came to his turn to be asked if he had anythin
to move, he always . his negative in a peculiar manner, intend
to imply that his time had not yet come.
BALDERDAsH was not, however, at all times silent, and had contrived
to make himself a sort of amicus curiae on points of practice connected
with the ventilation, lighting, and general construction of the Court.
e did not venture on performing the office of amicus to their Lordships
in any º º but if the sun came in their eyes, and made
Justice a little more blind than she ought to be...MR. BALDERDASH was
always ready with a precedent showing how the inconvenience might be
removed. “ } recollect, my luds,” he would exclaim, “in a case, the other
day, of DoE er parte Roº wersus Roe, on the demise of DoE–a case, b
the way, which your ludships will, not find in the books—I recollect,
Say, my luds, that in that case your ludships had the sun in your ludships'
eyes for nearly ten minutes, and, on the suggestion of, MR. BARON
ALDERson, the rest of your ludships concurring, the usher drew that
curtain, and excluded the casual trespasser, by whom your ludships
will perceive that I mean the sun.” On another occasion, when the
gushes of cold air from the ventilating apparatus were very violent, and
the Judges were complaining, he submitted to the Court the propriety
of calling upon, the person who had prepared the original draft. He
observed, also, that it came very hard upon him, for he had got a motion-
paper to hand in, but, somehow or other, he had been prevented, doing
so, for the motion paper was carried out of his hands, and got rid of by
a side-wind. -
I have gone into these particulars because they formed a portion of
my legal education; for, having expressed a wish to get an insight into
the practice of the Courts, I was invited by MR, BALDERDash to
accompany him occasionally during his attendance in Westminster Hall,
He advised me to take . notes when I had the opportunity, and I
therefore did so; but not being skilled in short-hand writing, my note-
book presented a strange jumble, for I could only follow the proceedings
very j and catch a word or an expression here and there. I was
nevertheless advised by MR. BALDERDASH to persevere, “For,” said he,
“it will all tellin some day or other;” and as it may “tellin” for other
students as well as for myself, I give a transcript of the notes I took
during one of my morning sittings. I confess F was not able to make
much of the notes myself, but perhaps some student more acute than
I was may find the following hieroglyphics, for such they now appear to
me, “tell in" with some of the other information he has acquired.
NOTE.
Somebody called out “Jones against ToMKINs.” A Barrister said
MR. Somebody, his leader, was not there. Several Barristers, began
talking at once. The usher cried out “Silence, pray, silence!” and
drowned the voices of them all. The second Judge from the right-hand
-I don't know his name—asked if counsel were ready in DoE against
SOMEBODY. A Barrister said he was ready. Another Barrister said he
was not ready. Five or six Barristers began to talk out loud about the
Opera. The usher walked very near to them without looking at them,
and roaring out, “Silence, pray, silence!” pushed four or five quiet:
looking persons back to the rear of the Court. Four Barristers rushed
into Court, and said they were all ready in something that had just
been struck out of the list. The eldest of the middle Judges said, “Let
it be restored.” A Barrister began to speak somewhat as follows, as
near as I could catch it:- -
“Mayºt ple yeludships, in this case plaintiff, purchaser—your lud-
ships will see—he replies de injurid.”
Another Counsel interrupting, “My brother is in error; it was son tort.”
1st Counsel (resuming). “Well, son tort. Here we have a double plea
—find in the books—bad for duplicity—CoRE lays it down that tenant
at will *3.
Other Counsel interrupting. “That’s not theP.
1st Judge. “This is a case of ejectment. If tenant had possession—
profit by his own wrong—there is nothing in the books—We must
refuse your rule.”
2nd º: “Same opinion.”
3rd Judge. “I’m of—”
4th Judge. “I concur with my brothers.”
Here loud talking in the Court Fº my continuing my notes or
hearing a word of anything; and the four Judges, rising from their
seats, retired.
On locking round, I saw MR. BALDERDAsH throwing out his arms,
with a paper in his hand, and shrieking out something about “Your
ludship pleases,” when the last Judge, looking round as he quitted the
.."; exclaimed, rather angrily, “You can't be heard, Sir; the Court
as risen.”
Such are the memoranda contained in my note-book of one of my
first days of studentship in Westminster Hall. The report reads
rather incoherently, but I have no doubt an intelligent student will fill
up the gaps in such a manner as to e a most interesting case of
ejectment out of the materials my note-book provides. , MR, BALDER-
DASH afterwards told me the argument was a rich display of learning
and ingenuity, and the judgment one of the most beautiful pieces of
lucid exposition that ever was sent forth from the Bench. It occurred to
me to .. myself the question, If this is the sort of jumble my note-book
gets into when their Lordships are particularly lucid, what should I be
able to make of it if the Judges should happen to be rather obscure,
and the argument itself somewhat more elaborate than that which was
the subject of my first report?

SECRETS OF THEATRES.
EveRY. Theatre is rushing out with a Secret. The Princess's has a
Sister's Secret: The Haymarket attracts the Million with a Wiſe's
Secret; and the French Plays, appeal to all lovers of Secrets with
Le Secret de mon Oncle... JüLLIEN, too, has got Un Secret, of some
relation or other. The Secrets' surely will not stophere. Aunts,
randmothers, godfathers, German cousins, will all be coming out with
their respective Secrets. But the only Secrets of the theatrical world are
| not exactly, Family Secrets. We should like to ascertain who it is that
orders all the pieces which are performed “By particular and special
| desire.”. We should like also to dive, into the Secret why George
| Barnwell is played only on Boxing-nights—why, on that night more
than any other night? We should also be especially pleased in learning
the Secret why. Clowns, when their dress has been pulled off at the
| side-wing, rush forward and shout “Here weare!”. These are Secrets
which no historian of the stage has yet attempted to explain, and yet
the subject is well worthy of three volumes. The greatest Secret of
all, however, is the taste of the town for seeing actors in female attire.
People iangh at seeing a man in Fººt ough for the life of us
we never could discover anything funny in it. The Secretis, how any
respectable actor can be induced to do it. Probably it is the painful
conviction that they cannot support the character of a gentleman, that
forces them to try the opposite extreme.

FINERY, DIRT, AND DISEASE.
MR. WAKLEY, as chairman of a Sanitary meeting at the Hanover
Square Rooms, convened by the National É. Association, is
reported by the Times to have made the following observations:–
“Let any one pass through Regent Street, in the immediateneighbourhood of that
meeting, and see the splendid shops in that lecality, with the wonderful displays of in-
genuity which the windows exhibited. Where were the makers of these goods?" In
cellars, in garrets, in holes and corners, or places absolutely unfit for the occupation of
human beings." - --- - -
We'remember an old saw which reminds young ladies that the silks
which invest their fair proportions are merely the “production of a
poor worm.” We object strongly to all saws which are deficient in
the quality of sharpness, and therefore have a poor opinion of the fore-
going, which has no cut in it, and has totally failed even to answer the
purpose of putting ladies out of conceit with their clothes. A dress is
none the worse for being made of silkworms, any more than turnips are
for being raised from guano; but it must be unpleasant to the wearers
of finery and trinkets to reflect that they were manufactured in the
places described by:MR.WAKLEY. It detracts from the comfort im-
#. by a visite, to consider that it has been the work of consumptive
takes the shine out of a bracelet, to think that it has been

ameliorate the physical condition of the poor, than continue to carry
the consequences of it on their own backs. ---

A WOICE FROM THE WEATHERCOCK.
THE difficulty of understanding the Weathercock has at all times
been severely felt by ourselves; but the people at the Royal Exchange
have driven us almost to despair by the erection of an arrangement of
the most alarmingly hieroglyphical character. We defy anyone but the
Wizard of the North to tell whether the wind is in that or any other
uarter, if he guides himself, by nothing, but the Royal Exchange
eathercock. There is something pointedly impertinent in the arrow,
which seems so ambiguous in its aim, that, as the old poet hath it,
“Save the mark” if we can tell what it may be driving at.
However intelligible the odd complication of the Weathercock may
be to the initiated, we think the public at large is entitled to some little
consideration, and we have therefore, to propose the addition of
some signs by which the weather may be understood by the ordinary
observer, who may be thus enabled to adapt his costume to the changes

there may be reason to anticipate. We can understand the nauticale:

PUNCH, OR THE

LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WEAR AND TEAR OF TREATIES.
THE Gallic Cock lately has been behaving in a sad dunghill fashion,
trampling upon treaties, as if they were so much dirt, and tearing
romises to rags and tatters, just as if each one of them was nothing
tter *". Charte. owever, he struts about none the less
proudly for it, and crows just as lustily as ever. If anything, he is
proud of what he has done. Cocks, proverbially, have no regard for
jewels: Aºsop, and other historians, who have dealt in fables, have
proved this Cockish indifference for what is bright and peerless. Now,
a good name is a jewel. Fair play is a jewel. Honour, is another,
though it is one but rarely found in a king's crown. ...These jewels,
however, possess but little charm in the eyes of the Gallic Cock. He
picks them up, keeps them suspended for a while, wonders what they
can be, and then drops them in the mud, as things too worthless to
retain. The treaty with ABD-EL-KADER has been thrown aside exactly
in this fashion. At the next sale of Unredeemed Pledges by MACHIN
and DEBENHAM, we should not wonder to see figure amongst the “ve
rare * Lots, “ The worn orious Émirº to Aºi Kapºº
What pawnbroker, however, would be rash enough to advance ever so
little upon it, unless to sellit again amongst little bits of cracked china,
the great value of which seems to consist in proportion to the number
of pieces into which it is broken. If kings were obliged, like certain
servants, “to pay for everything they broke,” no fortune, not even
*.º, Łouis-Philippe in American banks, could possibly stand the
outlay :
Tuam's Dustman.
“THE only legitimate Dustmen” is a legend surrounding a medal
shown at Christmas time by certain scavengers. We propose that the
curate of St. Jarlath's be recompensed by Conciliation. with a
similar piece of plate. DR. M'HALE was in arrears of his poors-rates.
He was scandalously abused for the default; when lo! his curate—the
curate of St. Jarlath—comes forward and takes the blame upon him:
self: “The payment had been left to him, and he had forgotten it.”
And, after this apology, DR. M'HALE stands sweet and clean in the
nostril and eye of the world! And after this apology, ought not the
curate's medal to bear the words “Scavenger and Dustman, to the
ARCHIBIshop of TuAM?” For has he not cleaned the lion of his dirt,
by coming down with the dust?
“Respectability" in Ireland.
A waſtER in the Dublin. Evening Packet says of the late MR.
Waldhon:- -
“The deceased has been some time on his keeping to avoid arrest, and though an
improvident, he was a highly-respectable gentleman of good fortune, but by no means
remarkable for his observance of law or good morals.”
"High respectability (in Ireland) consists in being above the law, and
out of sight of good morals.
A HINT FOR THE COURT NEWSMAN.
EveRYBopy knows for whom the Court Circular is concocted. The
domestic details of Royalty are devoured by old maids in the country.
While the merchant dives into the records of the Sharemarket, and the
shopkeeper skims the list of prices, the ancient virginity of our *:::
. † tea, puts on the spectacles, and settles down to enjoy its bit
or regal gossip.
Now all this is highly proper. Punch does not quarrel with the
newspapers for printing intelligence so pleasant to their readers. Punch
is not angry with the maiden aunts for being greedy of this news; and,
supposing a number of rural females to pant daily for such information,
Punch sees no reason why the penny-a-liners should not recount how
many men º diem go through Temple Bar carrying umbrellas, and the
colour of the whiskers of each of them. But what Punch is dissatisfied
with, is the meagreness of the particulars inserted in the Court
Circular...So incomplete, indeed, are some accounts, that one might
almost while reading them, begin to imagine that Kings and Queens
eat, sleep, and walk about just like other mortals; whereas, the most
ordinary day at the Palace, when properly chronicled, is replete with
interest, especially to juveniles, whose notions are derived from the
popular ballad, in which it is remarked that “the king was in his
chamber counting out his money.” The º mind...would glow
with loyalty were but the pomps of monarchy properly delineated; and
why not then have
PUNCH'S COURT CIRCULAR.
Windsor, February 30.
THE QUEEN and her Royal Consort took an early walk this morning.
HER MAJESTY was attired in her usual walking costume, wearing the
train of royal purple and the British crown, and carrying the sceptre
and golden ball. The Prince wore a field-marshal's uniform beneath his
robes as Chancellor of Cambridge. The royal couple were attended by
a squadron of the Scotch Greys, and as HER ſº passed the
. to the kitchen-garden, the head gardener had the honour of an
audience.
After breakfast the Prince Consort enjoyed the sport of shooting in
the royal preserves. His Royal Highness duly returned to the Castle
for luncheon, at which repast HER MAJESTY and the royal family were
#. ... A magnificent collation was laid out, consisting, as usual, of
ouble-gilt gingerbread and sugarplums coloured after designs of the
ancient masters.
In the afternoon, theyounger branches of the royal family were taken
out for an airing in the state carriage drawn by seventeen horses. The
PRINCE 9F WALEs was habited in the splendid costume attached to
the Duchy of Cornwall, remarkable for being wholly composed of tin
plates from the mines. The royal infants wore pointed steel boots of
the 15th century.
LoRD John Russell had the honour of an interview with HER
MAJESTY: , He was arrayed in his customary court dress, a suit of
burnished brass armour, being the costume of a premier of the time of
EGBERT...The noble lord remained at the Castle for dinner, which was
of the ordinary every-day description, covers being laid for two-hundred-
and-fifty, and HER MAJESTY partaking of the banquet sitting on her
throne and apparelled in the royal robes.
In the evening the QUEEN inspected a present lately arrived from
the Rance of Bungybang for the PRINCE of WALEs... It consisted of a
magnificent bedstead and bedding to match; the palliasse and pillows
are stuffed with diamonds. HER MAJESTY was graciously pleased to
approve of the intention of the heir-apparent to use this article of
furniture in future; so that, we may announce, on the very highest
authority, that the Prince will discard his usual bedstead, the sheets of
which are composed of bank-notes. The QUEEN remained up until a
late hour in the Treasury rooms, and was employed in counting out the
quarter's revenue and the assessed taxes.
“Post" Donkeys.
THE Post thus speaks of the Manchester FreeTrade meeting. It is
very noble, very convincing writing:-
“In this herd of donkeys, the bray of the Vice-President of the Board of Trade appears
to have been the longest, and that of Mr. Coppex was probably the loudest. The whole
affair was utterly disgraceful to persons walking on two legs and pretending to the
exercise of rational faculties.”
Well, if Messrs. GIBSON and Coºpes are condemned by the people
of the Post as donkeys, they have at least this melancholy satisfaction-
they are tried by their peers. -
ONE MORE USE OF CHLOROFORM.
We recommend Chloroform to the notice of Poor-Law Guardians, on
account of what they will doubtless consider the desirable influence
which the substance is capable of exerting on relieving officers—that of
rendering them utterly devoid of feeling.

THE COMING COMET.
HERE are few
of our readers
aware that
a Comet is
going to visit
us this year.
He has been
due ever since
1556. What
he has been
doing since
that period,
our ADAMs
and LEVER-
RIERs do not
- tell us. He
must be very slow in travelling, and we always thought that Comets
came quicker, than grey hairs or railway misfortunes. Probably he has
been taking the round of the zodiac, stopping at every sign, and enjoying
himself at every astrological house where there was a drop or a cloud to
be had. However, he is on the road at last, and we are to expect him
some time this year, though we are not told the precise month. This
is awkward, for we should adapt our clothing accordingly; for who
would wish to receive a Comet in a great-coat? As for ourselves, if he
does come, we think we had rather that he dropt in upon us in winter
than in. summer. This cold weather is just the thing for him. We
might dispense with coals, and butchers would be able to sell their
joints ready cooked; but a Comet in the dog-days really would be
a little too much. Persons would be flocking to Vesuvius for a cool
spot; salamanders even would complain of the heat; and the Oriental
lub would be obliged to dispense with its usual allowance of Cayenne
Pº -
t seems that this great Comet is to be the arant-courier to announce
the arrival of some tremendous person. He is only a special engine
sent on in advance to tell us to look out for a long train of events more
or less filled with accidents. We do not believe a word of this; the
same thing was said of the “Coming Man.” He was to set all Europe
in a blaze, and yet his shadow has not been seen up to the present
moment, though the longest-sighted politicians have tº: looking out
for him for years with their mental telescopes, and advertising and
shouting for him everywhere. It will be time enough to run when the
Comet comes, like Lord ELLESMERE when the French invade us—till
then, we shall believe in the one as much as the other.
If the Comet stops, amongst us, we 'º to goodness he will take
up his residence in Trafalgar Square. e know of no better place
for him. He could quench his thirst with the two little basins—just
a sip, a mice morning drain for him—and he could exercise himself
by running up and down the Nelson Column. It would be refreshing,
also, to see how much the place was improved after his visit. In this
way the Comet may turn out to be the greatest architect London has
ever had since the Great Fire of London. he comes in this light
we will be the first to shout Welcome! and to hold up his tail. Ti
this happy advent, we promise to keep an eye, mental as well as bodily,
upon his movements, and to give our readers the very earliest informa-
tion of his expected arrival, besides a long Catalogue Raisonnée of what
the Comet will do, and what he will not do. In the mean time, we do
not mind saying—“LoUIs-PHILIPPE, beware l’”
INGLIS-CHURCH-CONSTITUTION.
WE, were surprised and more than equally delighted, on the re-
assembling of Parliament, to see SIR Robert INGL1s in the enjoyment
of excellent health. We had been led to expect the reverse. It was
currently reported among the Clubs (where do people expect to ;
who circulate such rumours?) that SIR. Robert was so oppressed by the
conviction that the Church was gone the moment a Jew trod the floor
of the Commons, that his frank and happy spirits had sunk, and his
health, visibly declined. With the full belief that the Church was
annihilated, and that the earth would open somewhere near the
Minories—so soon as BARON Rothschild ºld take his seat—it was
confidently reported that SIR Robert had refused all food, (save and
†. the thinnest ham sandwich per diem), in the conviction that
England was no longer worth living in. Another rumour declared
that SIR ROBERT's hatter had received orders to fit the worthy baronet's
beaver with a small bag of ashes; and another averred that SIR
Robert's tailor had measured him for a suit of sackcloth, with a fancy
horse-hair waistcoat!
What is our happiness, then, to give these more than idle, these malig-
nant reports, the most vehement co iction? SIR Robert, on the
opening of Parliament, never looked better, blither. It is true he pre-
sented, petitions, from several places, both against the Jews and the
Catholics; but his hand did not tremble; his lip did not ſº he did
not, by any gesture, betray the anxiety of a son, with his mother
Church in danger-the grief of a patriot, with the Constitution of his
country about to fall to pieces.
There can be no doubt that, directly Rothschild takes his seat, the
whole country will go with a crash. Nevertheless, like some late idlers
on the Serpentine, SIR Robert walks and smiles, albeit the Constitu-
tion—like yielding ice—is cracking under him.
THE BEADLE'S DREAM.
I HAD a beat whereon the laziest brute
Might find repose, -
A pound a week and every year a suit
Of bram-new clothes;
A brass-mobb'd cane, a hat with gold-laced band

I had a seat on which to blow a cloud,

And, joy supreme!

THE MODEL SPONGE.
As the dinner-hour strikes, the Sponge knocks, at the door. Some:
times he º a bag of filberts with him. The host thanks him, and
roduces sundry bottles of his best port. Sometimes he sends a hare.
e knows that the first rule of society is, that whoever sends a hare is
necessarily invited to dinner. Sometimes it is a box for the play. The
result is always the same. The Sponge knows all the secret springs of
the heart and the stomach (they too frequently lodge together), which,
ever so slightly touched upon, draw out a gratuitous dinner. . His
conversation, too, is got up as neatly as himself. His fronts are richer
than those of Regent Street. His jokes, also, are beautifully dressed.
His scandal (for the ladies) is always of the newest cut, and his anec-
dotes fit as if they had been measured expressly for the company. He
leaves early. He has a tea in the neighbourhood—a dear friend who is
ill. He does not stop long, however, for he recollects he knows a hot
supper just close by. He carves—his manoeuvres with the knife and
fork exercise, in Hist are perfect—helps everybody to a wing, and a
nicety, and does not forget" the old proverb which says, that he who
wishes to be helped in this world must, first of all, hº himself. He
oes home with a stranger, and breakfasts with him. He remembers,
owever, about two o'clock, that he has business in the City. , His
visit occurs, curiously enough, just at luncheon time. He is invited “to
ick, a bone,” and devours a chicken. “The air of the City is so
racing.” His appetite is most accommodating. Its range seems, to
exceed even that of SoYER's kitchen at the Reform Club. He likes
everything. Cold meat does not daunt him. A large family does not
terrify him. Saturday, however, is the day of the week he likes, the
least. It is the day yhashes, of make-shifts, of pickles, bread-pudding,
and liver and bacon. Sunday is his grand, day, but he gives the
preference of his society to those houses which do not involve a walk,
or a cab, or an omnibus home. At his own house he is—but here we
must drop the Sponge, for we would not go home with him for any*.
We cannot fancy a Sponge sponging upon himself; the sight would be
awful. To be properly appreciated, the Sponge must be seen at other
persons’ tables. He is the gentleman-greengrocer who attends dinners,
and waits at evening-parties without the fee.

The Arms of the See of Manchester,
THE College of Arms has done the handsome thing by the new

article. As the Arms have been altogether falsely described by our
contemporaries, we are the more earnest that the error should be
corrected... The Arms may be thus technically described: “Or Qn .

into a bishopric); “three mitres of Brummagem proper,” (showing that
episcopacy is altogether above gold); “a cotton pod,” (to mark
humility; for, whereas all other Bishops wear lawn sleeves, the
RISH9p of MANCHESTER will always appear in calico); and “a square
shield, charged with a factory chimney proper, with this motto—Er
Jumo dare gingham.”

it would enable him to advance into the midst of the assembly from

position as a person presiding over a multitude, for he could be

a method for facilitating the embarking or disembarking of steam-

To the chairman at a
GRAND DISCOVERY.—IRELAND'S REAL DISORDER.
At last it has been discovered what is the matter with Ireland. It
has long been felt that the Irish people are unable to take care of
themselves. Everybody has perceived that there must be something
odd about a nation which allows one of the finest countries in the
world to run to waste. We must all have remarked a certain strange-
ness in a population which, whilst labouring under the severest distress,
has contrived to subscribe, on an average, some hundred pounds a-week
to the Repeal rent. . A peculiar incoherence has always characterised
the eloquence of Irish agitators. Their persistency in ignoring the
grant of ten millions, and railing against the British Government for its
apathy towards their countrymen, must have been viewed as an
excessive singularity. In short, most of us must have at times, sus-
ected that the Irish were out of their wits. All doubt on this subject
as now been dispelled by their own leading journal, the Nation. Our
contemporary, in a recent article, after stating that “the Nayan Board
of Guardians, like true men, have taken land, and are resolved to sustain
their poor by the free work of their own hands,” thus proceeds:–
“In urging on the Guardians of the poor the necessity of making exertions of this
kind to save the lives delivered into their keeping, we omitted to mention the fact that
the lunatic asylums of Limerick, Carlow, Maryborough, Dublin and Clonmel, are in a
great measure supported by the produce of the industry of the inmates.”
. All other plans to render the Irish industrious have failed; the
discipline of a lunatic asylum has answered. Let the Nation vouch for
its results:—
“The Clonmel Asylum is really a model in its way, of what an industrial school is, or
ought to be. The poor inmates at the asylum are taught to labour at the lands, to
plough, dig, sow, and reap crops, to weave their own cloth, and to make of this cloth
the clothes they wear. Beautifully laid outgrounds, and ornamental plantations, taken
care º: persons who, were they outside the walls, would be unable to take care of
themselves."
So now at length we know how to manage Ireland. The truth is, we
must put her under proper restraint. We must recall LQRD CLAREND9N,
and transfer DR. CóNNoLLY from Hanwell to Dublin Castle. The title
of Lord Lieutenant must be exchanged for that of Lord Keeper; that of
I.L. for M.D, Physicians, instead of soldiers, must be sent to the
disturbed districts, which must be tranquillised, not with powder and
ball, but with sedative medicines." Special Commissioners must be
Commissioners de lunatico inquirendo. The Repeal Association must
be put in strait-waistcoats,"and the head of John O'Connell, must be
shaved to begin with, and kept so as long as he continues to ramble
about dying on the floor of the House. ARCHDEACON LAFFAN must be
seen to, and the Lion of THE Folp of Judah shut up. The Irish are
clearly incapable of managing their own affairs; and the Nation has
shown how it is possible to manage their affairs for them,
Salt-Petre Enthusiasm.
MR. Pigou-that tremendous. blank-cartridge—denies that he is
influenced by a wish to sell his gunpowder, when he presses for
national defence. And for this reason:-
“The Ordnance contracts are now conducted with so strict a regard to economy, that
it is doubtful if the merchant gains any advantage from them. The terms at present are
just one-half those of the last war, the materials and labour quite as costly.”
Thus the merchant deals, not for money, but for love! Who could
have thought there had been such a Christian element in gunpowder *

THE SHADE OF JENKINS

-
- - º
º
\LABLACHE
|N A PASSION.
HAD we not been recently confirmed in our belief of supernatural
yisitations by MRs. CRowe's Night-side ºf Nature, we should neverthe-
less have felt convinced of a late visit of JENKINs to the office of the
Morning Post. “JENKINs from the Shades!”. This intelligence—though
} not so written—is, every letter of it, implied in a tremendous leading
article hurled at the Italian beggar-boys—the mendicant minstrels. The
article has all the strength and elasticity of the footman's cane—all the
brilliancy of its gold top. J.ENKINs never drove a beggar from the
door-step—never, borrowing the coachman's whip, “cut behind”—with
greater energy than he last week exhibited in the bruising, flagellating
article aforesaid.
Next to our admiration of the superhuman force—the more than
E. indignation of the philippic—is our wonder that JENKINs could
e made so wroth against Italian minstrelsy, even when reduced to the
streets, and keeping, company with green monkeys or white mice,
But we presume that, in proportion to his protecting admiration of
the Italian big boys of HERMAJESTY's Opera, is his disgust of the little
Italian, rascals of HER MAJESTY's streets. LABLAche's organ is a
thing to worship—little GIAcoMo's grinder a nuisance, to smash!
Pointing his snaky º: at the Italian vagrants, JENKINs asks, as
FESTUs says—in a voice of “buttered thunder”—
“If they think it is not worth their while to work for themselves, º are we not
justified in thinking it not worth our while to work for them. P. How can they blame us
for not doing for them that which they will not do for themselves? Are we, then, to be
their slaves?”
There is something thrillingly awful in the interrogation?...Some;
thing tremendously humiliating in the notion it conveys. ...“What l”
exclaims the shade of JENKINs, speaking for every living Englishman,
“will you be no better than the white mice—sorchi bianchi—that the
lazzaroni carry in their cages?, Will you be traded upon?” And then
he asks, in good bold type, of his old friends the Italian minstrels—
“Are they to live in idleness, and ease, and sloth, a burden to their fellow-creatures,
while we toil, and sweat, and plan, and consume at once the daily sun AND the mid-
night lamp for their sustenance and pleasure?”
How grand—indeed, how very, very sublime is this question! Imagine
JENKINs “consuming” the daily sun; and, at once and the same time
the “midnight lamp; ” thus consuming the sun as folks consume a salad
—with plenty of oil to it.
The Morning Post is famous for its fashionable intelligence; but
this—as chronicled by JENKINs—is a most extraordinary movement in
high-life; a movement, too, distinguished by wondrous condescension:
Only think of the “daily sun” paying a visit to the “midnight lamp!”
JENKINs here makes both ends meet as by miracle.

PUNCH*S. POEMS OF PARLIAMENT.
“How we got RID or our oLD CAPTAIN.”
3. Caſe of the 33rotectionist &ars.
(As told by an old Country-party Trooper to his Children, A.D. 1890.)
REMEMBER it? Right well, I trow, that sorry forty-eight,
The year our famous Captain was forced to quit his state;
I see him yet, girt by the troop, when each face wore a frown,
Brow.beaten but not baffled-cut up, but not cast down.
Aye—LoRD GEORGE—he was a Captain—why, with his single hand,
'Gainst a battering train of argument, unarm’d, he'd make a stand;
On his good steed, “Native Industry,” he’d charge the Leaguer's van,
And if his petronel hung fire, with the butt he’d floor his man.
Then to see him work his great guns—to the muzzle ramming in
Whatever charge came handiest—lead, copper, brass, or tin;
And "; away ! my boys,” he’d say, as the smoke wax’d hot and
thick; --- - -
“Only give 'em plenty of it, and I’ll warrant some will stick.”
And if a piece burnt priming—mo matter what was in 't, -
He’d cry “Blow in her touch-hole, while I down her muzzle squint.”
He never cared for the recoil, tho' it floor'd our bombardiers,
Or burst the gun and rattled down the battery 'bout our ears.
When short of shot and powder, he’d cry “Boys, ne’er look blue;
If we can't lay hands upon a fact, we’ll make a fiction do!”
Fighting was fighting under him; for, egad! one didn't know
If one's firing was more dangerous to one's self, or to the foe.
I remember, as 'twere yesterday, when Cobden, WILLIERs, BRIGHT,
Drew out the canting crop-eared sons of Free-Trade for the fight.
Till forty-six we had held the knaves pent up in Lancashire,
But at last they gather'd head and march’d upon our lines that year.
We still had laugh’d to scorn their League of prating pamphleteers,
But that PEEL sow'd treason broadcast,'mong our trusty cavaliers:
For four long years he tampered with the Captains of our host,
Till, save LoRD GEORGE's trusty troop, a traitor held each post.
No shame that he and his true men were forced at last to flee,
For, to give the rascal League their due, they laid on lustilie;
And Quaker BRIGHT, in that same fight, down on our rearward bore,
For a man of peace, most marvellous like to a man of war.
But tho’ beaten, still we kept the field for that year and the next,
And with many a dashing foray, the crop-eared Leaguers vext;
Our hold was theirs; but many a fort we kept, and castle stout,
Whence the British Lion on our flag blew broad and bravely out.
And the West Indian Interest, breathing vengeance on Free Trade,
Their swart and sallow company beneath our flag array'd,
From their isles of palm and sugar-came, sons of the buccaneers
To cry, “Stand and deliver!” to their English customeres.
And the sturdy British ship-owner his cutlass keen did draw,
To strike a good stroke for high freights, and the Navigation Law;
And Mother Church she bless'd us, in the name of glebe and tithe
And our numbers gather'd daily, and our chief look’d bold and blithe.
We had for our Lieutenant one of the tribe of BEN,
Who, in an evil hour to us, for the sword laid down the pen.
we lowed him not, though forced to own that none, at point of steel,
In rapier and dagger-fight, so breathed the traitor PEEL.
He led our noble chief astray, unto his foul disgrace,
With talk of Asian Mystery, and the Caucasian race;
Till, Mother Church left in the lurch, from bad to worse he grew,
And held the hand of fellowship out to the unholy Jew.
Qh! wail and woe were ours, I trow, when Protection's noblest son
Shook hands with BARON ROTHSCHILD and SHERIFF SALOMON;
When we heard he'd purchased a buff-coat of Moses’ hated line,
And countermanded leg-of-pork, with his new friends to dine.
“Choose” was the shout, “another out, to lead Protection's band;
Down with this son of BELLAL! We strip him of command.
Our fealty ends! To thy new friends.” So out from his true men
Went forth LORD GEORGE, our Captain, and his Lieutenant BEN.
Leave me awhile, my children, I ne'er recall that day
But I forget our cause is lost, and that my head is grey:
He was our chief—the first, the last—where else were we to find
That recklessness of reason, that stableness of mind?
Ours was a desperate cause, Iween, and needed desperate men;"
e turn'd our whole ranks over, but found no LoRi, GeoRGE again.
All had their silly tº: there was none like our lost Lord,
Who ne'er doubted of his weapon, and ne'er knew when he was floor'd.
None that rode o'er facts and figures as he was wont to ride;
None that trampled Reason underfoot, when she refused to guide;
None reckless how he damaged friends, so he the foe might stay;
None that from every drubbing but rose up the more gay;
None that could raise an army of statistics cut and dry,
In the cramming of a º: in the course of a reply;
None that no rebuke could silence, and no exposure shame;
None, in a word, so fit to fight Protection's losing game!
AFFECTING INCIDENT.
WE have all heard of certain wonderful effects of instinct, by which
parents and offspring have recognised each other, as if by the intuition of
nature, though they have no recollection of meeting before. Many of us
have marked the magnificent burst of passionate recognition with which
the . man at the Surrey º towards the only acknowledged
victim of unmerited everything, with a shriek of .#'i. ostdaughter!”
answered by a scream of “My father, who I thought sleeping long ago
under the bolster and two pillars of HERCULEs, have Ifound thee at
last?”. This, in its way, is affecting enough, and we have often been
moved by it—out of the theatre where it was going on; but it is not
half so pathetic, and scarcely more dramatic than a little incident we
heard of as having happened the other day at the steam-hatching esta-
blishment of the ingenious MR. CANTELo...A chicken, which had just
been brought into existence, was seized with an instinctive conscious-
ness of having been indebted for its birth to steam, and seeing a tea-
kettle on the boil upon an adjacent hob, rushed towards it with all the
ardent affection of a child for its parent, and, *ś to its
spout, refused to be torn away. The kettle, trembling with emotion
even to the top of its lid, º singing in tones half of tenderness and
half of agony, until it seemed full even to bursting, and, avec explosion,
as the French dramatists have it, let fall its hot tears on the head of
the chicken, as if in gentle recognition of the relationship the latter had
claimed. Of course this violent piece of pathos was the death of the
poor chicken, whose remains were, by MR. CANTELo's humane direc-
tions, immediately placed in a shell and removed.

Memory carried me instan-

my youth. I had the honour of
being at school with BARDOLPH
before he went to Brazemnose; the under boys used to look up at him
from afar off, as at a godlike being. He was one of the head boys of the
school; a prodigious dandy in pigeon-hole trowsers, ornamented with
what they called “tucks” in front. He wore a ring, leaving, the little
finger, on which he wore the jewel, out of his pocket, in which he carried
the rest of his hand. He had whiskers even then; and to this day I
cannot understand why he is not seven feet high. When he shouted
out “Under boy!” we small ones trembled and came to him. I recol-
lect he called me once from a hundred yards off, and I came up in a
tremor. He pointed to the ground. . - - - -- -
“Pick up my hockey-stick,” he said, pointing towards it with the
hand with the ring on. He had dropped the stick. He was too great,
wise, and good, to stoop to pick it up himself.

gold medallist. When he went up to Oxford, the Head-Master, the

REv. J. FLIBBER, complimented him in a valedictory speech, made him
a present of books, and prophesied that he would do great things at the
niversity. He had got a scholarship, and won a prize-poem, which
the Doctor read out to the sixth form with great emotion. It was on
“The Recollections of Childhood,” and the last lines were
“Qualia prospiciens catulus ferit athera risu,
Ipsaque trans luna cornua vacca salit.”
I ºff. of these things rapidly, gazing on the individual before me.
The brilliant young fellow of 1815 (by-the-bye, it was the Waterloo
year, by which some people may remember it better; but at school
we spoke of years, as “PogRAM's year,” “TokELY's year,” &c.)—there,
I say, sate before me the dashing young buck of 1815, a fa , muzzy, red-
faced old man, in a battered hat, absorbing whisky and water, and half
listening to the singing.
A wild, long-haired professional gentleman with a fluty voice, and
with his shirt-collar turned down, began to sing as follows:-
“WHEN THE GLOOM IS ON THE GLEN.”
“When the moonlight's on the mountain
And the gloom is on the glen,
At the cross beside the fountain
There is one will meet thee then.
At the cross beside the fountain;.
Yes, the cross beside the fountain,
here is one will meet thee them 1 - - -
[Down goes half of MR. BARDOLPH's No. 3 Whisky during this refrain.
“I have braved, since first we met, love,
Many a danger in my course;
But I never can forget, love
That dear fountain, that old CrOSS,
Where, her mantle shrouded o'er her—
For the winds were chilly then—
First I met my LEONORA,
When the gloom was on the glen.
Yes, I met my, &c. -
[Another gulp and almost total disappearance of Whisky-go, No. 3.
“Many a clime I’ve ranged since then, love,
Many a land I’ve wandered o'er;
But a valley like that glen, love,
Half so dear I never sor'
Ne'er saw maiden fairer, coyer,
Than wert thou, § true love, when
In the gloaming first I saw yer,
In the gloaming of the glen?”
BARDOLPH, who had not shown the least symptoms of emotion as the
ntleman with the fluty voice º: this delectable, composition,
egan to whack, whack, whack on the mahogany with his pewter
measure at the conclusion of the song, wishing, perhaps, to show that
the noggin was empty; in which manner JAMES, the waiter, interpreted
the signal, for he brought MR. BARDOLPH another supply of liquor.
The song, words, and music, composed and dedicated to CHARLEs
BIVINs, Es , by FREDERIG SNAPE, and ornamented with a picture
of a young #. with large eyes and short petticoats, leaning at a stone
cross by a fountain, was now handed about the room by a waiter, and
# gentleman was at liberty to purchase it for half-a-crown. The man
did not offer the song to BARDOLPH; he was too old a hand. -
After a pause, the president of the musical gents cried out for silence
again, and then stated to the company that MR. HoFF would si -
Red Flag,” which announcement was received by the Society with
immense applause, and MR. HoFF, a gentleman whom I remember
to have seen exceedingly unwell on board a Gravesend steamer, began
the following terrific §ſ. :-
“THE RED FLAG.”
“Where the quivering lightning flings
His arrows from out the clouds,
And the howling tempest sings,
And whistles among the shrouds,
'Tis pleasant, 'tis pleasant to ride
Along the foaming brine—
Wilt be the Rover's bride?
Wilt follow him, lady mine?
Hurrah !.
For the bonny, bonny brine.
“Amidst the storm and rack,
You shall see our #º.
As a serpent, lithe and black,
Glides through the waving grass;
As the vulture, swift and dark,
Down on the ring-dove flies,
You shall see the Rover's bark
Swoop down upon his prize.
Hurrah!
For the bonny, bonny prize.
“Over her sides we dash,
e gallop across her deck—
Ha! there’s a ghastly gash
On the merchant-captain's neck!
Well shot, well shot, old NED !
Well struck, well struck, black JAMEs'
Our arms are red, and our foes are dead,
And we leave a ship in es!
Hurrah!
For the bonny, bonny flames 1"
Frantic shouts of applause and encore hailed the atrocious sentiments
conveyed by MR. HoFF in this ballad, from every body except BAR-
DoIPH, who sat muzzy and unmoved, and only winked to the waiter to
bring him some more whisky. SPEC.
WASTE OF MILITARY POWER.
. In these days, when our National Defences and the º of an
invasion are the topics of conversation among people of every class, we
cannot afford to waste a single military man; and every soldier is there-
fore expected to be at his post, during the present trying juncture.
Judge then of our indignation and surprise at seeing a healthy huzzar
stationed at a door in the Strand, for the purpose of showing the fidelity
of his likeness, as exhibited in the frame of a painter of portraits. The
lant fellow seems to belong to a sort of mongrel regiment, something
etween a lancer, a light dragoon, a fencible, and a Cossack, or rather,
he forms an interesting combination of all four, in his accoutrements
and uniform. Qur objection, however, is to the ignoble nature of the
service on which he is employed, at a moment when every sword ought
to leap out of its scabbard, and every soldier out of his skin—if required
—for the defence of our native hearth-stones. -
We hope that some patriotic member of the House of Commons will
move for a return of this soldier to his allegiance, and also for a copy of
the furlough upon which he ventures to take leave of absence from the
ordinary duties of his regiment. The gallant fellow seems to be him-
self half ashamed of the nambypambyness of the service on which he is
engaged; and though he has been drawn for a soldier by the artist, we
are sure the trooper feels that he ought not to be “framed for deeds of
arms” at a door in the Strand, when he might, on some foreign strand,
be fighting the battles of his country.
Rather too Bad.
SOME wretched joker has sent us the following Riddles:–
Q. When would a bed make the best hunting-ground?
A. When it is made anew for rest (a New Forest).

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR. BRIEFLESS..."
CHAPTER THE FIFTH.
MR. BRIEFLESS CONTINUES HIS READINGS, AND DOES HIS EXERCISES
Fort the BAR.
My readings with MR. BALDERDAsh now began to take a wider
range, and we swallowed, somehow or other, nearly a volume per week,
including somebody on Partnership, somebody else on jº
tremendous quarto on. Evidence, a couple of huge octavos on Nisi
Prius, and a dashing little duodecimo on the lively subject of Bills.
My head became a kind of old legal curiosity-shop, stored with cases full
of the most remarkable specimens of dried-up decisions, which might well
be compared to mummies, for the mummeries they seemed to comprise.
Feeling that I was loaded almost to the very muzzle with legal
ammunition, and fearing that I, should go. off with a tremendous
forensic explosion, unless I was allowed to direct my learning to some
aim, I requested that a practical object might be found to test the
value of the cramming I had endured. I thought it pitiable that so
eat a gun as I believed myself, to be should have no opportunity of
g away, but should sit at my desk with a quantity of blank cartridge
before me, while inferior geniuses were making themselves heard by
means of the Reports. I entreated MR. BALDERDAsH to let me have a
real case of some kind to exercise my skill upon; but unfortunately, in
the whole of my learned friend's large connection there was not one
individual who seemed to have a turn for litigation at the period to
which I allude. Not a plea, nor a declaration, nor a demurrer came in
to be drawn, and we therefore raised in our minds an imaginary assault,
in order that we might sympathise with a phantom plaintiff. We feel.
ingly described his º by fifty blows, whereby he suffered “forty
black eyes,” inflicted with “sixty fists,” and with three hundred
knuckles,” on “eighty eyelids,” at “one hundred different times,”
whereby he had “from time to time, and at all times, forty discoloura-
tions”of “sixty, cheek-bones, and eighty headaches,” to “the damage
of the said plaintiff of ninetyº
When we had pummelled our plaintiff in every possible manner
ºf: ten long and elaborate counts, MR. BALDERDAsH pronoun
our declaration to be the perfection of pleading for an action of
common assault. But we had not yet done with our victim; for, having
bed the multiplicity, and variety of the attacks upon him, we
dragged him through “Middlesex to wit, at Westminster, videlicet in
Surrey,” and continued to thrash him through half-a-dozen counties, lest
we might have made an error in the place where our client had become
Bowris in the manner described. Having once plunged into the prac-
tical, by the use of imaginary clients, we were never at a loss for
material; and we soon peopled the chambers with ideal suitors, all
rushing to BALDERDASH for justice, vengeance, or redress. No longer
fettered by the stringent bonds of reality, the business of my friend and
master grew to a tremendous extent, and the papers of which I had the
run accumulated at the rate of half-a-hundred-weight per week. We
drew declarations, by the quire, and pleadings by the ream ; we
went through all the various ramifications of the replication de injurid,
with steel pens and iron, hearts; we pleaded double, treble, an
uadruple, for the sake of º ingenuity in demurrer; and we
}. into rebutters, so that, in the shape of surre-butters, we might
compliment each other on the shrewdness we had displayed.
In the midst of these brilliant exercises of our powers on imaginary
cases, a real motion-paper, with a real half-guinea, was one day brought
in, and the endorsement told us that MR. BALDERDASH was instructed
to ask the permission of the Court of Queen's Bench to allow his client
to take a rule to compute. The morsel of bond ſide business came to
us like the one real biscuit, for the principal character, amid the
theatrical banquet of pasteboard apples, wooden hams, canvas pies
worsted maccaroni, glue jellies, dimity turkeys, sarsnet sausages, an
glazed red calico lobsters, to which the subordinates are limited at the
evening party given by Lady Macbeth. A real motion-paper appeared
to us like a bottle of ginger-beer spirting up from the midst of
the sands of the desert, and we hastened to regale, ourselves at the
refreshing fount of actual practice, after having so long, been pulling
away at #. immense drafts of nothing, on which we had been hitherto
employed. My first impulse, on reading the endorsement, was to tear
down Jacobs from the book-shelf, and look out, in that most lucid of
legal lexicographers, the word “Compute.” . MR, BALDERDASH ehecked
my impatience, chided me gently for not being already acquainted with
such avery elementary matter, and entered into a lengthy history of the
igin, rise, and progress of the rule. He picked it up first from the
sifting of a quantity of Coke; he then washed it, if I may be allowed
the expression, in a stream of LUSH,” and we ultimately carried it down
to Westminster, where MR. BALDERDAsH, having duly robed and
wigged for the occasion, went through the solemn ceremony of hand-
ing it in.
y preparation for the Bar was not limited to my readings, in
chambers, but I now began to do what are called exercises, with a view
to my approaching call. These exercises do not task the intellectual
faculties so much as may be supposed, though they are intended to
serve as tests for the mentative powers and the learning of the
embryo Barrister. The different Inns of Court adopt different modes
of conducting what is, by a bold and pleasant fiction, regarded as a
keen encounter of the wits of the candidates for forensic dignity. Two
students are presumed to be prepared for engaging in a severe legal
argument; which is conducted in some of the Inns before a Barrister,
and in others of the Inns before a butler, supported by two mugs of
beer, placed no doubt as refreshers, to invigorate the learned disputants.
In Gray's Inn, where I had the honour of first entering the lists of
litigation, I was conducted with a fellow-student to a corner of the
i". a parchment was put into the hands of each of us, and a
stray Barrister, having been caught by the waiter for the purpose, was
requested to preside over us while we did our exercise. I commenced
reading from my parchment prompter something to the following
effect:-‘‘I maintain that the widow is not barred of dower, because
though her right of free-bench—" - -
Here I was interrupted with a facetious “Oh, indeed!, Very good!
Quite sufficient, Sir!” from the presiding Barrister, who, turning to my
º asked with an amiable air what he had to urge by way of
objection to my position., I, maintain,” murmured my antagonist
reading from his parchment, “that the widow never having been seise
of her free-bench—” . But the presiding. Barrister, with an ejaculation
of “You don’t say so! Quite sufficient, Sir!”, put an abrupt end to the
somewhat abstruse discussion. . This ceremony having been repeated
the required number of times, I became qualified to enter into the arena
of legal discussion, in the character of an advocate. The introduction
of the beer into the ceremony, at the other Inn to which I have alluded,
has a curious effect; for the disputants are not allowed to get out a
word before the butler, by politely observing, “The beer, gentlemen, if
you please; just clap it to your lips—you needn't drink it—that’ll do!”
mips the discussion in the bud, and cuts short the exercise. .
#. got thus far on my road to the Bar, the next step is the call
itself; for the celebration of which, as I am expected to ask a few
§: s to take wine with me at the Inn, I must reserve an entire
chapter. ,

TRAVELS IN LONDON.
A NIGHT’S PLEASURE.
WHEN the piratical ballad of MR. HoFF was concluded, a simple and
T. young gentleman performed a comic song, in a way which,
must confess, inspired me with the utmost melancholy. Seated at the
table along with the other professional gents, this young fellow was in
nowise to be distinguished from any other young man of fashion: he
has a thin, handsome, and rather sad countenance; and º to be
a perfectly sober and meritorious young man. But suddenly (and I
daresay every night of his life) he pulls a little flexible grey country-
man's hat out of his pocket, and the moment he has put it on, his face
assumes an expression of unutterable vacuity and folly, his eyes goggle
round savage, and his mouth stretches almost to his ears, as thus:-
mº
º
in his comic HAT-
without his hat.
and he begins to sing a rustic song.
The battle-song and the sentimental ballad already published are, I
trust, sufficiently foolish, and fair |. of the class of poetry to
which they belong; but the folly of the comic country song was so great
and matchless, that I am not going to compete for a moment with the
author, or to venture to attempt anything like his style of composition.
It was something about a man going a coorting Molly, and “feayther.”
and “kyows,” and “peegs,” and other rustic produce. The idiotic
verse was interspersed with spoken passages, of corresponding imbe-
cility. For the time during which MR. GRINSBy performed thisP.
he consented to abnegate altogether his claim to be considered as a
reasonable being; utterly to debase himself, in order to make the
company laugh; and to forget the rank, dignity, and privileges of
a Inall.
His song made me so profoundly wretched that little GRIGG, re-
marking my depression, declared I was as slow as a Parliamentary train.
I was glad they didn't have the song over again. When it was done,
MR. GRINsby put his little grey hat in his pocket, the maniacal grin
subsided from his features, and he sate down with his natural sad and
rather handsome young countenance.
O GRINSBY, thinks I, what a number of people and things in this
world do you represent Though we weary listening to you, we may
moralise over you; though you sing a foolish witless song, you poor
young melancholy jester, there is some good in it that may be had for
the seeking. Perhaps that lad has a family at, home dependent on his
ſº I may entertain a reasonable hope that he has despair in his
eart; a complete notion of the folly of the business in which he is
engaged; a contempt for the fools laughing and guffawing round about
at his miserable jokes; and a perfect weariness of mind at their original
dullness and continued repetition. What a sinking of spirit must come
over that young man, quiet in his chamber or family, orderly and sensible
like other, mortals, when the thought of tom-fool hour comes across
him, and that at a certain time that night, whatever may be his health,
or distaste, or mood of mind or body, there he must be, at a table at the
Cave of Harmony, uttering insane ballads with an idiotic grin on his
face, and hat on his head.
To suppose that GRINsby has any personal pleasure in that song
would be to have too low an opinion of human nature: to imagine that
the applauses of the multitude of the frequenters of the Cave tickled his
yanity or are bestowed upon him deservedly—would be, I say, to think
too hardly of him. Look at him. He sits there quite a quiet orderly
young fellow. Mark with what an abstracted * air he joins in the
chorus of MR. SNAPE's second song, ‘The Minaret's bells o'er the Bos-
phorus toll,” and having applauded his comrade at the end of the song
(as I have remarked these poor gentlemen always do) moodily resumes
the stump of his cigar.
“I wonder, my dear GRIGG, how many men there are in the City who
follow a similar profession to GRINSBY's...What a number 9 r
rogues, wits in their circle, or bilious, or in debt, or henpecked, or
otherwise miserable in their private circumstances, come grinning out
to dinner of a night, and laugh and crack, and let off their good stories
like yonder professional funny fellow. Why, I once went into the room
of that famous dinner-party conversationalist and wit, HoRSELEy Col-
LARD; and whilst he was in his dressing-room arranging his wig, just
looked over, the books on the table before his sofa. There were
“BURTON's Anatomy for the quotations, three of which he let off that
yery night; ‘SPENCE's Literary Anecdotes,’ of which he fortuitously
introduced a couple in the course of the evening; ‘BAKER's Chronicle;’
the last new Novel, and a book of Metaphysics, every one of which I
heard him quote, besides four stories out of his common-place-book, at
which I took a peep under the pillow. He was like GRINSRY. Who
; like GRINSBY in life? thought I to myself, examining that young
ellow.
“When BAwLER goes down to the House of Commons from a meeting
with his creditors, and, having been a bankrupt a month before, becomes
a patriot all of a sudden, and pours you out an intensely interesting
tºº. upon the West Indies, or the Window Tax, he is no better than
that poor gin-and-water practitioner yonder, and performs in his Cave,
as GRINSBy in his under the Piazza.
“When SERGEANT BLUEBAG fires into a witness, or performs a jocular
or a pathetic speech to a jury, in what is he better than GRINSBY, except
in so far as the amount of gain goes?—than poor. GRINshy rapping at
the table and cutting professional jokes at half-a-pint-of-whisky fee ?
“When TIGHTRope, the celebrated literary genius, sits down to write
and laugh—with the children very likely ill at home-with a strong
º desire to write a tragedy or a sermon, with his wife scolding
im, his head racking with pain, his mother-in-law making a noise, at
his ears and telling him ſº. is a heartless and abandoned ruffian, his
tailor in the passage, vowing that he will not quit that place until his little
bill is settled—when, I say, TIGHTRoPE writes off, under the most
miserable private circumstances, a brilliant funny article, in how much
is he morally superior to my friend GRINsby When LoRp QoICHICUM
stands bowing and smiling before his sovereign, with gout...in his toes
and grief in his heart; when parsons in the pulpit—when editors at their
desks—forget their natural griefs, pleasures, opinions, to go through the
business of life, the masquerade P existence, in what are the tter
than GRINSBY yonder, who has similarly to perform his buffooning?”
As I was continuing in this moral and interrogatory mood—no doubt
boring poor little GRIGG, who came to the Cave for pleasure, and not
for philosophical discourse—MR. BARDOLPH opposite caught a sight of
the present writer through the fumes of the cigars, and came across to
our table, holding his fourth glass of toddy in his hand. He held out
the other to me: it was hot, and gouty, and not particularly clean.
“Deuced queer place this, hay?” said he, pretending to survey it
with the air of a stranger. I come here every now and then, on my way
home to Lincoln's Inn–from—from parties at the other end of the
town. It is frequented by a parcel of queer people—low shop-boys and
attorneys’ clerks; but hang it, Sir, they know a gentleman when they
see one, and not one of those fellows would dare to speak to me—no,
not one of 'em, by Jove—if I didn’t address him first, by Jove! I don't
|suppose there's a man in this room could construe a page in the com-
| monest Greek book, SPEC. You_heard that donkey singing about
‘LEoNoRAR’ and ‘before her’? How FLIBBER would have given it to
us for such rhymes, hay? . A parcel of ignoramuses! but hang it, Sir,
they do know a gentleman!” And here he winked at me, with a vinous
bloodshot eye, as much as to intimate that he was infinitely superior to
every person in the room. . - -
| Now this BARDolph, having had the ill-luck to get a fellowship, and
|subsequently a small private fortune, has done nothing since the year
1820 but get drunk and read Greek. He despises every man who does
not know that language (so that you and I, my dear Sir, come in for a
fair share of his contempt). He can still put a slang song into Greek
Iambics, or turn a police report into the language of TACITUs or
HERODoTUs; but it is difficult to say what accomplishment beyond
this the boozy old mortal possesses. He spends nearly a third part of
his life and income at his dinner, or on his whisky at a tavern; more
than another third portion is spent in bed. It is past noon before he
ets up to breakfast, and to º over the Times, which business of the
y being completed, it is time for him to dress and take his walk to
the club to dinner. He scorns a man who puts his h’s in the wrong
place, and spits at a human being who has not had a University, educa-
tion. And yet I am sure that bustling waiter pushing about with a bumper

Reformation might be applied with admirable effect to these military º:
in which many of our gallant veterans pass at least half their days. The
boxes should exhibit uniformity in

they are contiguous. In Trafalgar

like mustard-pot of the
er-castors, to be in keeping with the massive and dome-
ational Gallery, whilst the architectural taste for the
Elizabethan should be gratified as above, some slight modification of the soldier's
uniform might be necessary; but this would be very easily achieved.
WHERE DOES IT ALL COME FROMP
THE Times lately, in one of its leading articles, shows in
a clear and happy style how “the variety of distant regions
by which our every-day comforts and luxuries are -
is a geographical lesson familiar to our earliest
Our contemporary proceeds to tellus how the child knows
that the tea it is tº: comes from China, that the
coffee is grown by Arabs, the sugar extracted from the came
in Jamaica, or by the banks of the Ganges. And thus going
cleverly over the breakfast-table, the writer intimates the
sories of our ordinary morning's meal.
This is all quite true of children belonging to ons
in easy and respectable circumstances; but supposing the
case to be that of some poor infant who has been all its life
a witness, and a participator in the parental, makeshifts,
“dodges,” and degradations that poverty and bad manage-
ment will render necessary, the article we allude to would
have run somewhat as follows:–
“The child knows that the tea it is drinking came from
the bushes of Fulham, and has probably had half the twigs
of a birch broom amalgamated with the pound of damaged
Pekoe that formed the foundation of the contents of the
Chinese-looking chest in the window of the Lambeth grocer.
Its coffee was made ponderous by heavy chicory, and its
sugar was partly extracted from the sugar cask and partly
from the box containing sand, of whose coarseness the
Libyan desert might fairly feel ashamed. The morning
milk has acquired its present snowy whiteness and cream-
like consistency from the combined contributions of the
distant chalk-pit, the neighbouring pump, and the local cow.
The material of the tea-kettle came from the tin mines of
Cornwall, it was manufactured in Birmingham, and had
dangled at the door of the Little Dustpan, in Holborn,
with a ticket inscribed, ‘Look here! You can’t believe it,
Idaresay; but it’s a fact-only minepence,” º

BRITANNLA has lent her ennobling name; the blade of
the knife came from the New Cut—a guarantee for the
sharpness of the instrument—and the haft was boned from
some animal who never saw the owner of the weapon. The
tablecloth has been a constant traveller up and down the
connecting spout, between freedom and captivity in the
establishment of the pawnbroker, and the carpet is redolent
of Venetian romance. The child’s frock has passed through
the cotton mills of Lancashire, the mangles of Middlesex,
and the washing-tubs of London, until its colours have
flown; and indeed there is no limit to the number of
ingenious speculations that the contents of any apartment,
however humble, might not suggest.”

CURIOSITIES OF LEAP-YEAR.
TRIOUS facts occur during Ileap-year, which, upon no º whatever,
could, or would, or should, occur upon any other year. First of all, those
persons who happened to be born on the 29th of February will have a chance
of keeping their birthday; a pleasure they can only know once in four
years. We hope their parents will make generous allowances for this
accident, and, in giving their customary presents, multiply them by four, and
wish them four times the usual amount of “many happy returns of the day.”
Bill-discounters, who charge their interest per diem, will get one day's more
extortion this year; whilst Editors of Magazines and their contributors will
rejoice they have an additional day for sending in copy. Poor job-horses
however, which are let out by the month, will think the extra day a hard
pull upon them; and articled clerks and apprentices who are in their last
year of bondage, will not be very complimentary or grateful to the 29th of
February for perching them one day longer upon their high stools. But all
persons whose bills become due on the 1st of March, will rather like the
delay; and hares, whose madness always breaks out, it seems, on St. David's
Day, will enjoy, this year, twenty-four hours' more sanity than the last;
which must be a source of extreme pleasure to all philanthropists and the
Animals' Friend Society, to say nothing of the hares themselves. The Ides
of March, also, will visit us all the later, and we shall have pancakes, as an
Irishman would say, on Shrove Wednesday instead of Tuesday.
As for ourselves, we are married, and so do not dread the dangers of Leap-
year. But bachelors must be on their guard, and assume all manner of
surliness—that is to say, supposing they have it not–for they should

It is deeply to be
that such a custom occurs only once every four years, or else the
#aping the 33iper,
*TIs an Englishman's pride—and it can’t be denied
We're a people of mighty resources—
Our dominions are vast, and we’re quite unsurpass'd
By the world for our maritime forces.
Then our trade is immense, and in every sense
'Tis allow’d we're a wonderful nation;
But the worst of it is, that to keep up all this,
We’ve to bear such a load of taxation.
Oh yes! we’re a wonderful nation,
A very remarkable nation;
What a thing it would be, if it were not that we
Had to bear such a load of taxation'
Without scruple or doubt, we at once set about
Undertakings most grand and stupendous;
And we care not a bit how ourselves we commit
To expenses, however tremendous.
Thus, in Railways we sank half the wealth of the Bank,
And the upshot of this speculation
Is a horrible mess of commercial distress,
And the prospect of further taxation.
Indeed we’re a wonderful nation,
We are a most wonderful nation;
Oh that we could be such without paying so much
As we do in the shape of taxation
The world has no mate to the empire and state
Of the Rose and the Shamrock and Thistle;
But Truth bids us to say that we certainly pay
Most exceedingly dear for our whistle:
That’s the thorn in our side; that’s the gall to our pride;
That’s what spoils all our glorification;
That inordinate drain that our pockets sustain
In our awful amount of taxation.
But still we’re a wonderful nation,
By Jove! we’re a wonderful nation,
With a wonderful purse, and obliged to disburse
A most wonderful sum in taxation.
TALBOT AND TUAM.
TALBOT, in heraldic language, signifies a dog—not a cur, nor a
mongrel, but an animal of a noble, generous race. Such a thorough-
bred English TALBOT-a TALBOT of a breed which, for upwards of four
hun years, has been famous for never turning tail—has lately per-
formed as galiant an exploit as was ever achieved by our own Toby.
He has gone boldly in upon the “Lion of the Fold of Judah,” so called
-but whom we consider as a much meaner kind of brute in a lion's skin
-and has bearded this lion, such as he is, in his den. More correctly,
perhaps, we may say that our spirited TALBOT has drawn the badger, or
unkennelled the fox, of St. Jarlath's. The creature, on being dragge
to light, made a spiteful but ineffectual defence, and then erºt back
into his hole; whence he has again been dislodged by the bold TALBOT,
who has given him a shaking from which it will take him a long time to
recover. Thus wrote JoHN M'HALE, of Tuam, to JoHN TALBOT, of
Shrewsbury:–
“Had such wayward and extravagant caprices, &c. . . . . . . they should escape from
us all notice and observation; but when we find a Catholic Peer come forward, and
deliberately assert of an entire National Church, to which his country is so deeply
beholden, “that she is a conniver at injustice, an accessory to crime, a pestilent sore in
the commonwealth,’ &c. &c. ... we are actually reminded of the sincerity of
HEROD’s homage,” &c. &c.
Such, asserts DR. M'HALE, was the deliberate assertion made by the
EARL of SHREwsbury against the Irish Roman Catholic Church, in the
first letter addressed by the EARL to him—M“HALE. Whereas—and
John TUAM well knew it—his, Lordship merely complained of the ill
name which, thanks principally to the said JoHN, that Church has
acquired in England. These were the words of the EARL of SHREws-
BURY concerning the Church in question, written to JoHN TUAM
aforesaid:—
“The public voice in England now pronounces her to be a conniver,” &c.
ARCHBISHOP M'HALE compares the EARL of SHREwsBURY to
HEROD. He provokes a retort, which, but that comparisons are
odious, his antagonist might have made very appropriately. With
HEROD we naturally associate another personage, whom his Lordship
might have associated with somebody else. We allude to PILATE, so
memorable for his question, “What is Truth?” a thing which was
utterly beyond his comprehension, and seems to be as far beyond that
of a certain Archbishop.
A Real Invasion.
WHILST we have been talking of providing against a possible invasion,
we have had a foe actually ravaging the heart of the Metropolis. . The
Times declares that during six weeks the Influenza interrupted business,
and killed 5000 people in London. According to the last quarterly
return of the Registrar-General “the epidemic of Influenza killed twice
as many people in the insalubrious parts of London as it did in those
less unhealthy.” It may be all very well to fortify our coasts; but the
above statements show that we ought not, in the meantime, to neglect
our common shores. It is ridiculous, on the part of BRITANNIA, to
boast of ruling the waves, so long as she asserts no sort of control over
the gutters.

“JAcOB, you don’t know my feelings. Here I sits in this room with

Christian, won't he be expected to be just as good, if not better?
You're one of Young Israeſ, and don't see it; but since they take from

the writer says:– -
“The admission of BARon Rothschild alone breaks down the principle, and once
give that up, it is impossible either for the Times or ourselves to say how many Jews will
follow the example of the worthy Baron, or to what designs wealth, ambition, and the
aust of power, may conduct them."
“Yes, Jacob, this is the sort of stuff that I know Young Israel is led
away with. Open the House of Commons to 'em, and they 'll make it
only a passage, as they think, to the House of Lords. There’ll be

I mean it all the same. , Give me the disabilities, that lets Old Israel
buy the second-hand robes, and not the abilities that lets Young Israel
wear 'em. -
“Won't it be a shocking thing for our people to go spending their
money at all sorts of elections, and wasting their precious time in
the House of Commons?—time that ought to be given to bus'ness.

Questions at the Gramination for the abmisgion of
3ttorneys.
| *s UR last batch of answers
created a sensation among
the law-students that can
only be described as regularly
Niagarian, for cataracts of
correspondence have poured
in upon º why
we stopped -way in our
instructive course, and left
# three of the subjects of ex-
| amination unnoticed. We
| have consequently effected
another transfer from the
columns of º con-
temporary the Legal Observer,
and have forwarded the
remaining portion to MR.
BRIEFLEss, requesting him
to draw the requisite number
of answers, and file his bill-
being his account for fees–
at his earliest convenience.
With his customary prompt-
itude—for the arrow is not
more rapid in its flight to
the mare's-nest than is the
ounce of BRIEFLEsson the
- - rief—he has, favoured us
with the following answers to the questions under the remaining
branches, beginning with
IV. Equity and Practice of the Courts.
Q. State some of the principal cases in which relief is to be obtained
through a Court of Equity. -
A. #. are many cases in which parish relief is to be obtained
through a Court of Equity; for by pauperising the client it gives him
a claim for relief on the parochial funds. -
fi. State the principle upon which assets are marshalled in a Court
of Equity.
A. The officers of the Court have the first pickings out of the assets;
the lawyers have a second claim; and when this is satisfied the assets
may be marshalled, if thereisanything left to marshal, among the suitors
themselves. - -
Q. Explain the difference between the nature of the relief obtained
by mortgage creditors through the medium of a Court of Equity and
t º that of a Court of Law. -
4. When the mortgage-creditors goſorrelief to either a Court of Law
or a Court of º the remedy is often worse than the disease. It
would be difficult to point out the difference in the operation, except,
rhaps, that Chancery operates slowly, and the patient is allowed to
ger, while Law frequently settles him at once. -
Q. in what cases is it advisable for the defendant's solicitor to peruse
and consider the effect of the billimmediately upon entering appearance,
without waiting for the office copy, and for what reason?
4. In all cases...it is as well for a solicitor to draw up an imaginary
bill, and considerits relative effectupon his own and his client's pocket,
by which, of course, is meant the probability of its being paid. If on
considering the effect of the bill, he finds it satisfactory, he may go
a- at once without waiting for office copy or anything else. .
Q. In what cases is it necessary tº resort to a Court of Equity in
* of a right which can be established only through a Court of
w
\º
ºffs
A. When the fund or property is so plethoric as to render it
advisable to consume it by Law and by Equity at once, or in conformity
with a common º set the candle burning away at both ends.
- What is the distinction between a bill for discovery and relief,
and a bill for discovery only?
4. A bill for discovery, and relief is, I take it, a bill sent in soon
enough to enable you to discover your error and stopin time. A bill for
discovery only, is a bill, which prevents you from finding out your mis-
take until the mischief is all done, and the costs have been all incurred.
REVERSE OF FORTUNE.
AN affecting instance of reverse of fortune was accidentally brought
to our knowledge a few days ago, in the case of avery poor and wretched
old joke, that was found crouched up as if ashamed to show its face, in
a comer of our letter-box... We recognised the joke as one of our very
earliest acquaintances; and on tracing its history, we found it had been
introduced to the world by the celebrated SHERIDAN, who obtained for
it a most flattering reception at the Theatre, in the best society, and
also upon one occasion in Parliament. Time, however, soon began to
tell upon the joke, which was fº to find its way into a farce or two,
where it was received with much kindness. At length the patience of
its best friends began to be exhausted, and the joke was reduced to the
painful necessity of sustaining a precarious existence by attendance at
evening parties, until at last it sunk down into the deepest depths of
degradation, by rendering itself so familiar that contempt was every-
where felt for it. Ultimately it became evident that no one would take
it in, and it was at length found in our letter-box, into which the poor
thing had contrived to cram itself. We, of course, discovered its cha-
racter at once, and forwarded it to an asylum for decayed witticisms,
where every care will, no doubt, be taken of it.
A BLACK JOB.
WAs LoRD NE1son an Ethiopian? is a question that maybe naturally
asked by any uninformed person who happens to see the Statue of the
heroin its present condition in Trafalgar Square. The countenance of
the great naval captain of his age wears a blackness, more like the
lowering aspect of SIR LowRy. Cole than that of Nelson's own
º though º it is rather in character that he should
ave become black in the face at the indignity passed upon him by his
treatment at the Column. We might excuse his black looks under the
circumstances, if we were not aware that NElson is not personally
responsible for the sombre features of his much-neglected effigy. We
have only one way, in which to account for the darkness of the hero's
aspect, and that is by supposing that the whole of the arrangements
connected with Trafalgar, Square, have been managed with such a
niggard hand that NELson himself has at last assumed a nigger'd face
to keep them in countenance.
SOMETHING OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.
M. the D. of W. presents his com.
pliments to Mr. Punch, and thinks
the time has now arrived when it
has become expedient to announce
to him the real reason of his (the
D. of W.’s) fears with regard to an
Invasion by the French.
He (the D. of W.) had long since
been in the possession of secret
intelligence of the intended ultimate
surrender of the Great Emir; and
º his expectations of an invasion were
* based on this information. For he
| clearly º that as soon as
ABD-el-KADER should become a
risoner, Mr. Punch would remain
rance's greatest antagonist.
This event has now taken place:
Mr. Punch will, therefore, inevitably
attract all that persevering hostility, which has been so successful in
Africa, and direct it upon England. And as the war in Algeria was not
with Africa, but with ABD-El-KADER, so the war in England will not be
with Great Britian, but with Punch.
He the D. or W) therefore feels it right to warm Mr. Punch of the
responsible position in which he stands, and to inform him that he (the
D. of W.) considers that the man who º war upon anation, should
be the first in its defence. In pursuance of this conviction, the D. or
W. hereby officially signifies to Mr. Punch, that his (Mr. P.'s) baton
will henceforth be that of a Field Marshal. . . . . . - -
F. M. THE D. or W., in communicating this intelligence, wishes it
to be understood that he by no means approves of his (Mr. Pºs)
conduct towards himself, but feels that the present is an occasion when
his feelings as an individual must not be º to interfere with his
duty to his country.

FASHIONS FOR 1848.
THERE is quite a fashion at present for Constitutions. Each petty
State is putting on, a fresh one. , The old ones, in fact, were so
worn out that it was high time they should be thrown off and sold for
old rags. Prussia first started the fashion, though the Constitution it
assumed was of such a patchwork nature that it was not half so becoming
as it might have been. The form—the façon, as the French term it—
was good enough, but the materials were very poor stuff, and most
clumsily put together. The fact is, it had been ordered so many years
ago, that, when completed, the fashion had quite gone by.
Luccanext tried a Constitution, and succeeded in getting something
like a fit; no thanks, however, to its Duke, who absconded after a
most glaring case of cabbage. The fashion also has reached Naples,
who, there is no doubt, will look much smarter, and move all the
quicker, when she gets her new suit of clothes...Let us hope that when
it is ready, it will not, like her former Constitutions, follow the national
proverb as strictly: “See Naples, and then die.” The fashion is
spreading fast all through Europe. Denmark even wishes to come
into it. *... has all the Parisian desire to be, in the fashion, but
wants the courage; whilst poor º occasionally makes an effort
and orders a.º.º. though the order is alwa scountermanded
the next day. Portugal is also anxious to throw off her old habits;
and all Lombardy, much to the dislike of Austria, who hides her fears
behind a wall of soldiers, is burning to exchange threadbare forms for
bran-new ones. ..
. If this rage continue, we must have books of new Constitutions pub-
lished, like the Fashions, every month, so that a State who wishes for
a change may pick and choose for itself. In the meantime, the
favourite pattern seems to be the English Constitution. ... We are
glad to see other States cutting their cloth after ours; for, really,
putting the stains out of sight, and blinding ourselves to the few
patches here and there, we don't know where—all vanity apart—
they, could possibly select a better Constitution for finish, style, and
durability, than in England. We say nothing about its cheapness; for
. must expect to pay a good price if they want a good article. They
might get a cheaper and a more showy thing from France; but it
would go in less than a month, and they would only have to come
to us after all in the words of the tea-dealer, we say loudly
to all foreign States, “TRY_our BRITISH Constitution, STRONGLY
REcoMMENDED For FAMILY Use.” We hope before the Millenium to
see all the world (including America) our customers. In the meantime,
kings, dukes, viceroys, popes, queens, policemen, beadles, democrats,
and parish and German potentates, ºfup your orders.
The Pride of the City.
MR. WAKLEY and other people may inveigh against the filthiness of |
London; but it is the proud boast of the Corporation, that notwith-
standing the late panic and failures that have occurred in the Money |
Market, the City neither has been, nor ever will be, cleaned out.
EUCLID OUTDONE.
THE ºf proposition is so immensely difficult that we offer a |
large reward—the particulars of which will be duly announced—to any
one by whom the problem is solved. It is as follows: Given, a railway
time-table—to find the periods fixed for the starting of the trains.

AN ADAPTATION FROM
SHAKSPEARE.
THE British Lion has kicked off LoRD GeoRGE BENTINGK. This is ungrateful, unnatural
conduct in an animal we have been accustomed to consider the type of magnanimity, and the
nobler qualities of feline nature. -
What! Loºp George, the most daring keeper the greature ever had!-LoRD GEORGE, who
used to go into his den, hold up, before his bars that tempting morse! Protection, set him
wling andlicking his jaws and lashing his tail with, eagerness, and then whip it away-
opp George, who used to make him jump through the hoop of statistics, and perform the
funniestantics–LoRD GEgºge, who poked him up-I.QRD GEORGE, who stroked him down-
LoRD gº. who made him show histeeth, or offer his peaceful paw–Lord GeoRSE turned
upon at last!
We have lost our faithin Lions. -
But what will Loºp George do now? Let him turn CoRIOLANUs-curse his recreant party,
betake himself to the hearth of his PEEITUs PERFIDrus, and there demand, hospitality in
the name offancient Parliamentary fisticuffs. Such a proceeding would furnish matter for
an imitative tragedy, as affecting as that of Shakspeake, and more appropriate to modern
experiences. We beg leave to sketch the action of it from this point:-
LoRD GEORGE (muffled).
Enter PERFIDIUs.
Per. Whence comest thou? What wouldest thou? Thy name?
Lord G. If, PEELIUs, (unmuffling)
Not yet thou knowest me, necessity
Commands me name myself.
Per. What is thy name?
Lord G. My name is LoRD GEORGE BENTINCR, who hath stuck
To thee particularly and to all PEELITEs,
Like to a Trojan; thereto witness may
My surname, “Stable Mind.” The lengthy speeches,
The strange statistics, and the hosts of facts
Crammed for my º are requited
But with that surname—only the name remains;
The bigotry and blindness of the party,
Seconded by constituencies of counties.
Who disapprovemy vote upon the Jew Bill,
Have driven me by general desire
To drop my leadership. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth!
And soon. After the march of the º PEEIJus PERFIDIUs accepts with delight the alliance
ºf his old enemy. They unite their forces, Loºn. GeoRGE having brought MR BENAMIN
DISHAELI with him, and march against the citadelof Protection. They encamp before it. All
regular Parliamentary overtures of peace are rudely declined. At length a mourning proces:
sign of old women issues from the walls. MR HERRIES, SIR CHARLEs KNIGHTLEy, and
MR. Newpºgºre, the Parliamentary mother, wife, and child of the “Stable Mind,” prostrate
themselves before him, and implore him to avert his arms from his friends. The age of
the first, the inoffensiveness of the second, and
the inexperience of the third prevail. The
“Stable º gives way. The army, retire,
and the hero finally falls a victim. to PEELIUs
PERFIDIUs, and his associates, Political Progress
and Common Sense.
OUR LEGAL HEROES.
SINCE the prospect of an Invasion by the
French has been spoken of, the entire legal pro-
fession has been up in arms, and the Bar has
declared with one voice, that every member will
shed his last lock of horse-hair, and lay down his
lastfee if necessary, in defence of his nativeland.
Arrangements are already-in progress for com-
pletingaforensic corps, calculated fostrike terror
into the breasts of the bravestºfoes; and it is
not perhaps generally known that a Law Review
is about to be established, which will be in fact
a periodical, but will consist of powder and shot
instead of paper and print. It is in fact intended
to call out the legal cohorts, to exercise once
a-week, by roll of drum, in the precincts of the
Rolls. The weapons of this ant band will
consist of those legal instruments, with which
such deadly havoc is usually committed; and we
ask in the utmost confidence, which of us would
not fly further and sooner from a writ than from
a bayonet or abullet?, The word of command, to
“Draw declarations,” has something far more
terrible in it than the common-place exclamation
of “Draw swords,” and every one who owes a
farthing, though he might listen complacently to
the words “Recover arms,” would quail like a
very wild duck at hearing the ominous º of
“Recover debt and costs.” Exercises have
already commenced, and the drilling is about to
proceed in the garden of Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields,
which is to be fitted up as the Field of the Cloth
of Costs. The forensic forces will combine
upwards of a thousand rank and file, but there
will be a battalion of Barristers called, par ercel-
lence, the Deep Old Files, º way of distinction
from the ordinary soldiers. few meetings have
already been held, for the purpose of organising a
regiment of legal volunteers, and the Accountant-
General has been invited to accept the office of
General in command. SERIEANT WILKINs has
been selected on account of his vigourand enthu-
siasm, to undertake the office of recruiting-
sergeant, and we shall no doubt, soon see on the
* of Westminster Hall, a notice to the effect
t -
“A FEW FINE IIIGH-SPIRITED YOUNG JUNIORs
Are wanted immediately, to follow their leaders
in a great national cause.”
We can imagine the effect that would be pro-
duced upon the whole of the back rows in
Westminster Hall by
WILKINS'S ADDRESS TO HIS ARMY,
Adapted to the Air of “Scots wha ha".”
Juniors, who’ve your clients bled,
Juniors, whom I’ve often led,
(Though I’ve found you thick of head,)
On to Victory! 4
Who would fill a coward's wig,
Who for fame don't care a fig,
Who thinks nothing infra dig.—
Let him turn and flee.
Who th’ uncertainty of law, .
In each document they draw, " .
Would expose, and find a flaw-
Let him follow me!
There could not be a more appropriate finale
to this spirit-stirring song, than a cry of “Make
ready costs,” followed by an order to “Present
bills,” and winding up with one tremendous shout
of “Charge—Six-and-eightpence!”

DOINGS AT A “CERTAIN CHURCH!”
A WARNING TO WOMEN. -
WE have received a º tangle of a letter—evidently written in a
female hand, and under feelings of great excitement—from which we
pick, as well as we may, the following passages:–
At a certain church, which (says our correspondent) she is not yet
prepared to name, but which, if she is further provoked, she will most
assuredly denounce, to put all her fellow-creatures upon their proper
guard (for there never was such a wickedness heard of before!)—
At a certain church—the most extraordinary practice is resorted to;
and if she only knew the Bishop of that church, which she will know
before many days, or the fault will not be her own—
t a certain church—which qught to be the last place where any
experiment of any sort is made; for, hav'n't they hospitals, and
surgeries, and lecture-rooms, and who can say what, to play their fal-lal
tricks in, which they call the interests of Science (fiddlestick!) as if
Science had anything to do with human feelings and human affections,
and those sweet emotions of the heart that lead the heart very often to
give itself away before it knows where it is; and very often †: a very
nice return it gets for all its goodness—
At a certain church—and where the clergyman was brought up who
can suffer such things, there’s nobody can tell; for he ought to know
better, or the gown ought to be stripped from over his head, and not
another word said upon the matter; whereas, to the contrary, from all
that’s appeared, he rather gives in to the notion, as it saves him time,
and allows him to get home to luncheon earlier, as if people who have
duties to perform should think of luncheon before the happiness of their
fellow-creatures—
. At a certain church, and there—for there can be no doubt of it—the
big beadle stands looking and laughing on, instead of taking the culprits
up; , and the pew-openers do nothing but warm their keys in their
hands, instead of running for the police—
At a certain church—and what the feelings of parents who consent
to such doings, can be made of, it’s more than any Christian can tell—
At a certain church, on certain occasions when weddings take place—
and only consider, a wedding...that solemn occasion that seldom happens
above once in a person's life, and sometimes never; and after all,
perhaps, when it’s considered what troubles are in the world, people
are much better that are left entirely single than even those that go off

Government 50,000,000 florins, upon the most
liberal terms. , Nicholas, surely, must be one
of those gentlemen who, notwithstanding the
present hard times, are constantly lºft

requires some little pledge, which, }º:

hereby authorises him to adopt the motto and
legend of “Money Lent,” and to sport two
golden balls to the one now in connexion with
his sceptre. The EMPERoR of Russia, in the
political drama, is evidently the “Benevolent
Uncle” to the distressed Princes of Europe.

A GAME FANCY FAIR.
UST now we read a pargraph in
# the Stamford Mercury which
has set all our benevolent sym-
pathies in a ferment. We feel
much more than we can express
in any present known type; and
could wish that there was some
peculiar lachrymal font cast for
the development of extreme
ExETER. That distinguished
man has made for himself a great
reputation as a Game Peer.
The . feather is the long-
acknowledged plume of chiel-
tainship. Now ExETER might
Wear #. pheasant’s tail in his
coronet; which might further
be trimmed with the scut of
A hares in lieu of ermine; and all
as typical of his game ascend-
ancy. He is, so to speak, the
Prince of Preserves. cii, the
Marquis has of late been un-
fortunate in business. We feel
for the losses of any deserving
tradesman; but our grief is, of
course, much more poignant
when awakened by the sorrows
of a Poulterer of Blood. The
- Stamford Mercury, in brief but
impressive lines, gives the history of the noble tradesman's recent misfortune:–
“On the 1st inst. he sent to the Sibson railway station, in a cart, as many hares and pheasants as took two horses to draw
them, and the carriage of them by the railway to London was charged £3 10s. : there were to pay, besides, the fare and expenses
of the gamekeeper who accompanied them; and such was the bad return of the sale, that when the man got back, the noble Marquis
was actually 20s. out of poeket by the dealing, the London market being exceedingly overstocked.”
Qverstocked! Why can there not be unanimity among noble game-dealers, as among aristocratic
coal-owners, so that the limited supply should always command a certain return? ... It would greatly
grieve us to find a nobleman in the Gazette—that Colonna Infame of the newspaper-ſor reverses in the
poultry line. Imagine how it would read:—
“The most noble the MARquis of Cocktails, May Fair, dealer in game. Feb, -, at Basinghall Street. Solicitor, MR. WIREs,
Hare Court. Official Assignee, MR Ghouse.”
We should feel this as almost a national disgrace; and therefore we have to propose a plan that—if
carried out—will, we think, have with it the combined charms of novelty and profit. .
Why should there not be, about Christmas time, a sort of Game Fancy Fair? It is the glory of John
BULL that he loveth a lord. The very presence of aristocracy giveth out an odour. Even the playhouse
is made more spicy, more odoriferous, by the pººf visits of the Genii of the Red Book: . MADAME
WESTRIs knoweth this: and therefore, astute ladyſ are not our eyes gladdened at breakfast-time—
gladdened and mightily dazzled at the same moment—by the long list of aristocratic names—a very|Co

Hºº for when JoHN SIMPsoN hears that LoRD SCARLETHEELs, with LADY SQARLETHEEIs and
the HoN. MissEs PARROTBILL, have been to the playhouse, JoHN SIMPsqN, drysalter, immediately
prefers that playhouse, whereto he may carry MRs. SIMPson and her daughter PEGGY, He will not
own it; but there is a something superior in that sort of playhouse. It can hardly be; and yet he cannot
tell; nobility, like the measles, may, after all, be catching. -
"Noble dealers in the poultry of the preserves may, if they will, turn this laudable feeling of the country
at large to a very profitable account; and this they may do, as we have already suggested, by instituting
a Game Fancy Fair. People who buy such Christmas F. would, of course, give a larger sum for
the same commodities if vended by the noble dealers themselves. Hence, if the quis would only
bring himself to superintend a game-stand for two or three days in the season, he could not but
realise considerable profit, from the condescension, If, too, noble game-preservers appeared at their
stands in their robes, and coronets, and garters, they would no doubt add to the attraction of the
solemnity, whilst at the same time they would cast a lustre upon the commerce of the country by such
aristocratic decoration...We would, moreover, have the attendance of all ſº distinguished
by their wounds and achievements. Men who had killed a poacher should be duly medalled-like the
heroes of the line—and men who had suffered wounds and mutilation, in defence of that vital institution
of the country, the Game-Laws, should also be present, honourably badged, for the ready notice and
admiration of all visitors. . . We think, too, that—could it be obtained-casts of that poacher's head
immediately after the receipt of the “punch.” .*. it, made historical by MR. BERKELEY, might be sold
at a moderate price, so as to put the great moral lesson within the possession of all buyers. e believe
that if a faithful cast of that most medicinal “punch” could be disseminated throughout the rural
districts, so that the humblest field-labourer could not rise in the morning without a “punch.”
in his eye, a blow—a repeated blow—would be given to poaching that it could not long stand up again
This, however, by the . - -
course, many, noble game-preservers would sell the mere raw material:—the birds in their
feathers—the hares in their fur. But as ladies at their Fancy-Fairs sell the very prettiest manufactured
articles, so might the Game-Law Lords have their stands of game pies, &c. &c. agine the DUKE OF
ATHOL with a row of venison pasties, warranted by the noble tradesman to be made of the flesh of deer,
upon whose privacy, no Scotch professor, no Southern tourist had dared to intrude. Sacred venison
pasties from the sublime solitudes of Glen Tilt'
sorrow for the MARQUIs of |al
And there too may be the DUKE or
LEEDs, with his venison—his red and
roe deer—prepared for all sorts of
savoury eating.
And other Lords have their harepies
—and partridge pies—and glazed phea-
sants—and, in fact, all varieties of game
dishes made for the occasion—for the
general palate of the profane vulgar.

our hint will be acted upon.

of Tax-gatherers which drop upon us
regularly four times a year, coming in

find about them; but your Tax-ga-
therer knocks at your door, and nearly
eats you out of house and pantry.

OLD AND NEW TOYS.
Toys have been in a state of coma for hun-
dreds of years. It is time that Science should
pass her gentle hands over them, and unmes-
merise them. When everything else is moving,
toys should not remain at a stand-still. They
must advance with the age. , Children are too
clever now to be amused with the simple kites
that almost lifted us off our little legs in the
º days when we wore no straps. The
infant mind has so expanded that it is content
with nothing less than a Nassau Balloon...The
old rocking-horse, too, with his
red wafers and wooden tail, is
now voted “slow; ” and depend
upon it, long before the three
years of the Income Tax have
expired, that the NIMRODs of
the nursery will ride nothing
but a Megatherium, or at least
a monster steam-engine, worked
with real steam. ..
Fast boys will stipulate for a
velocipede instead of a hoop,
and the innocent amusement of
blowing soap-bubbles will be
- quite exploded eventually, by
the awful gasometer. Nurses will still be subjected to the playfulness
of their young charges, only in a more powerful form!
The New kite.
The old, The NFw.
Nurseries will be turned into miniature laboratories, and we shall
have the satisfaction of knowing that our children, as they grow out of
their clothes, are becoming men, or rather hobbedehoys of science,
every inch of them. A lesson will be contained in every toy; our

| lamb's-wool dogs will be taught to bark chemistry; our speaking-dolls
be made to talk ten languages, and the most abstruse sciences be made
easy to the smallest understanding by the aid of a plaything.
THE NEW Rocking-horise.
Questions at the 33ramination for Äbmiggion of
3ttormtpg.
THERE seems no limit to the excitement which has seized upon the
law-students to gain possession of our lucid explanation of the mysterious
nuts submitted to them for the operation of cracking. We have
accordingly resolved on plundering our able contemporary the Legal
Observer, for the third and last time, of the questions still remainin
to be answered; and we give them with all the beautifully reasone
replies that our standing counsel has appended to them.
W.—Bankruptcy and Practice of the Courts."
Q. What description of traders are now liable to the Bankrupt Laws?
A. Recent experience has shown us that no traders are too high or
too respectable to be exempt from such a disagreeable liability.
Q. Describe the mode of proceeding to make a debtor a bankrupt.
A. Send him to one of the universities; persuade him to take a
theatre; transfer all your railway shares to him; make him a Pro-
visional Committee-man; or encourage him to invent something useful,
by which he will be ruined, and large fortunes will be eventually made
by his successors, who are literally those who succeed.
WI.-Criminal Law, and Proceedings before Magistrates.
Q. State the mode of proceeding to obtain the liberation of a person
improperly restrained of º liberty.
A. Bribe the policeman with its son. If that won't do, try
him with half-a-sovereign; but, if that wont do, knock him down, and
run off with your captive friend.
Q. What are the material points of evidence in an indictment for
perjury :
A. A regular hard swearer, to swear the direct opposite to everything
which the alleged perjurer has sworn.
Q. What is the usual course adopted in practice to secure the
attendance of witnesses in criminal cases?
A. The usual course is to serve them with the usual order for beer
on the public-house nearest to the Court. When the original order is
not made out, the witnesses will in general not object to be served
with the drafts.
§ What is the mode of proceeding against a banker or agent for
applying to his own use money or securities intrusted to him for a
specific purpose? .
. A. The first step in the proceedings arising out of such a transaction,
is usually taken by the banker or agent himself, who proceeds to get
out of the country with all possible expedition. The §. proceeding
the injured July can take, is to run after the delinquent with the
utmost speed. -
Q. What are the material and necessary points on which evidence is
required in such proceedings?
A. The best, though certainly the most unsatisfactory evidence, is to
be found in the knowledge of the victimised individual, that his money
and his banker or agent are gone.
LEGISLATIVE CANDOUR.
MR. RENAMIN DISRAELI was seized, on Friday evening, with a fit of
extraordinary candour, or rather, he released the feline animal from the
reticule-let the cat out of the bag—in a manner quite astonishing.
In speaking against LORD John Russell's financial propositions, “Young
BEN” observed that “war was not produced by Powers that were
satisfied ; but, as in society, disturbance was created by an individual
who did not find himself in that position which he thought his
talents entitled him to.” This is one of the finest pieces of self-asser-
tion we have heard for some time. The public Estimates are not the
only estimates upon which MR. BENJAMIN DISRAELI differs from the
Government; for the estimate formed of the honourable gentleman
himself, is the great—or little–matter upon which he seems to be at
issue with all parties. Remembering that extremes sometimes meet,
there is a remote chance that the breach may be filled up some
day or another.
The Printers' Friends.
WE understand that it is contemplated by the printers, generally, to
# up a testimonial to the HAMPDEN controversialists, and also to
M'HALE, Archbishop of Tuam, for the great exertions of those gentle-
men, which have so much redounded to the good of trade.
BEWARE OF THE BAD JOKE.
A HostER in Oxford Street, who does occasionally on the sly a little
gambling and punning, has purchased lately a most tremendous lot of
opera ties. The reason he unblushingly gives for this is because he has
learnt from experience at Loo, that “ties always pay the dealer.”

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR. BRIEFLESS.
CHAPTER THE SIXTH.
MR. BRIEFLESS IS CALLED TO THE BAR.
º
onceiving the auspicious
moment had now arrived
when it became necessary
for me to take a hundred
pounds out of my pocket, or
rather out of a rich uncle's,
in order to raise the fees re-
uired for my call to the Bar
- ". upon the good ol
..man, who gave me his bless-
ing and a bill-stamp, both of which I readily accepted; and, receiving in
exchange a hundred pound note, I flew to the Treasurer of my Inn,
who soon relieved me of its charge, and presented me in exchange with
a table of expenses payable upon my entry into | profession.
º however, to the ceremony of a call, it is customary—or
was in the days when i turned that first preliminary somersault, which
will send me vaulting head over heels on to the Woolsack at last—it was,
I say, customary to ask your friends to the Hall of your Inn, to take
wine with you, in celebration of the auspicious event of the evening. I
had issued about half-a-quire of invitations, and three fellow-students,
who were to be called on the same night as myself, had each sent forth
note-paper to a like amount, and four parties of about a dozen each
assembled in the old Hall of Gray's Inn, to do honour to the acces-
sion the Bar was about to make to its ranks, in the shape of four new
| Utters of unutterable promise in the opinion of their respective friends
and relatives.
Instead of sitting unsociably at separate tables, in different parts of
the Hall, it was arranged that the four parties should join their forces,
and kill, as it were, four birds with one stone, by making a single cele-
bration of the four great events of the evening.
I must not, however, omit the ceremony of the call itself, which was
performed in the presence of the Benchers, with due solemnity. Each
student took—from the hands of the butler—a tremendous oath
engrossed on parchment, and binding the deponent not to stand by and
see foreign princes murdered in the street, nor to suffer any bull from
Rome to make him draw in his horms, on any pretext whatever. Such
were the provisions of this oath, which was washed down by a glass of
wine, to drink to the Benchers, who, wishing the new Barristers
success, were glad to get them out of the way, and resume the festi-
vities of the evening. - - -
was now a Barrister, and felt all the weight of my new dignity. My
legs seemed animated with a sort of involuntary motion of course, and
in the hilarious excitement of the moment, the spirit of Hilary Term
seemed to come suddenly over me. Had there been a turnpike-gate in
my way, I could have shown my readiness for a trial at bar, by vaulting
gracefully on to the other side of it. ... I felt that I was transmogrified by
the magic of the oath, and the fairy-like transmutation of the possession
of my uncle's hundred pound note into the hands of the steward. I felt,
in fact, that I was now the qualified champion of injured innocence, the
recognised advocate of lovely woman in distress, the authorised un-
masker of villany, and the privileged tearer out of all those false fronts
disfigure—as the ink besmears the pad—the guilty bosom. I yearmed
for some victim of oppression, I cared not how humble his sphere—
Hºmber the better—that I might insist upon justice being done
O Illinn.
What would I not have given for some acknowledged heroine of
domestic melodrama—some persecuted housemaid, such as I bad seen
divers of at the Victoria Theatre in the course of my life—some injured
creature with a hair-broom in her hand, and an avalanche of injustice on
her devoted head—what, I *: would I not have given for such a
creature as a client! I would have asked on her behalf, whether the
Constitution was to go no further than the drawing-room or dining-
room floor, and be refused admission to the kitchen * I would have
demanded to know whether virtue is not as respectable in stuff as in silk,
and whether the heart encased in muslin should be exempted from
the process of mangling, any more than the crushed bosom in a cotton
print, or whether we are to hold the feelings in Orleans cloth cheaper
{. those which are carefully wrapped up in the delicate velvet of
oaf
As there were four distinct parties amalgamated into one, there
might have been some jealousy as to the appointment of a Chair-
man, had not a friend of my own—an aged junior at the Bar-
been unanimously called to the Chair, in compliment to his very
palpable black wig, thrown out into relief, by the grey hairs straggling
from beneath it, and out of respect, no doubt, to a regular field of furrows
which the plough of old Time had cut out upon his countenance. This
appearance bespoke that if he had failed to reap, it was not for want of
the materials to sow, for there was something dreadfully seedy in his
i took an interest in my success; and
which are often worn to hide the tremendous blots and stains which ||al
aspect. He opened the proceedings of the evening by drinking the
health of the newly-called Barrister, and predicting, with much confi-
dence, that he would eventually sit upon the Woolsack. Each of the four
candidates rose at once to take to himself the little prophecy about
the Woolsack, and each disclaimed, at the same time, the compliment,
while each appropriated it, and each was assailed with a burst of
“Down, down!” from three sides, and a cry of “Bravo, Go on!” from
his own fourth fraction of the company. There were consequently no
less than four embryo Lord Chancellors—in their own opinion—talking
at once; and indeed a call to the Bar never takes place without the
new accession to its ranks taking ipso facto a reversionary interest in
the Great Seal, according to the notions of his own immediate friends
and family. I am sure I have kissed the royal hand, on my elevation
to the Woolsack, fifty times at least, in the imagination of those who
- as every family believes its own
scion is destined for the glorious post, there are always, upon an
average, some four or five hundred embryo Chancellors in the chambers,
garrets, and attics of the great metropolis.
The unlucky contretemps that had happened in the commencement of
the evening materially marred its harmony. The father—or grandfather
—of the Bar drank to such excess, in order to drown animosity, as he sai
that he grew extremely sentimental, and alternately º shrieked, an
speechified. I can scarcely call to mind what passed after this, or how
the evening concluded; but I have a vague recollection of my having
been ºf: to my lodgings on the tips of my toes between two friends,
one of whom proclaimed himself averse to going home till morning,
while the other administered to me a succession of assaults and batteries,
designed to irritate me into an attempt to maintain a perpendicular
position. Our respected Chairman was found at five o’clock in the
morning, without shoes, coat, or hat, imploring a pump in Gray’s-Inn
#: to pour over the affidavit, and allow him to take a rule for a new
rial.
REFORM YOUR PREMIER'S BILLS.
THE Budget this year is like the heavy pack which CHRISTIAN carries
in the Pilgrim's Progress. Its contents are of the most disagreeable
#. * it is very like to sink poor JoHN BULL in the Slough of
espond.
“We have to meet a deficiency of three millions,” says LoRD JoHN.
“How do you propose to meet it?” asks JoHN BULL.
“By adding three millions of Income-Tax,” says Lord JoHN.
B “You mean by taking off three millions of expenditure?” says John
ULL. -
“On the contrary, I mean to increase the Ordnance Estimates,” says
LoRD John.
“I won't pay a farthing more,” says JoHN BULL. |
“We must make both ends meet,” says LoRD JoHN, :
“Granted,” says John BULL. -
J “So I'm obliged to put a strain on the national income,” says LORD
OHN.
“Why not put the strain on the national outlay?” says JoHN BULL.
wº question of his fat friend Punch begs leave to echo. -
Making both ends meet is a process of great toil and torture, which
individuals, as well as governments, have been going through pretty
generally this Christmas; but when, on looking back, a man finds an
arming gap between his Dr. and Cr. aecounts, he tries to close it up
by adding to income what he cuts off from expenditure. . It is to
hoped that the country will insist on LoRD John following this self-
denying principle, No doubt putting a hand in the pocket of J. B.,
and pulling out three millions additional Income-Tax, is a very simple
and satisfactory process for a Minister, but it is by no means so pleasant
to J. B. -

LIBERALITY OF RUMOUR.
THERE is something quite extraordinary in the liberality with which
Rumour has been bestowing Bishoprics and Archbishoprics within the
last few months; and indeed the arrangements of Rumour fully realise
the proverb–º his dat guicito dat;” for Rumour not only gives away
a good thing very quickly, but, gives it twice or three times over to
different individuals. The Archbishopric of York, vacant a short time
back, was good-naturedly given by Rumour to some half-dozen prelates;
but stern reality, that terrible wet blanket on Rumour's good inten-
tions, soon interfered to take away from five of the favoured objects
the benefit that Rumour had bestowed upon them.

THE PICTURE OF A HOME.
LL the promises given to
ABD-El-KADER to go
to Alexandria have been
broken; but the promise
pledged to him that he
shall have a Mosque in
France is—incredible as
it may appear—about
A to be fulfilled. Artists
- have been despatched to
* the South with orders
- - º - to run up one as quickly
as possible: " Cicéri, the celebrated scene-painter of the Académie,
is intrusted with the decorations, and HoRACE VERNET has given a
sketch of the Desert, which, on account of its wonderful fidelity to
Nature, has drawn tears, from the poor exile who sells the luscious
Racahout des Arabes, at the corner of the Rue de la Paix, on the
Boulevards. Everything for miles is as barren, as Leicester Square,
only it is not relieved by the luxuriance of thistles and dandelions,
which flourish spontaneously in the neighbourhood of the Cockney
Walhalla. In the horizon, however, at several leagues' distance, is
seen a palm-tree in a wooden box, which has been generously lent for
the occasion by the Jardin des Plantes. A camel, too, it is expected,
will be thrown in to add to the effect; and negotiations are pending
for a live goat, and, if possible, a chamois. . Real sand, also, is to be
laid down, an engagement, having been signed with the Puits de
Grenelle to furnish from its inexhaustible reservoir three cart-loads at
least, a day. Nothing will be left undone, not a stone will be left
unturned, to bring the Desert to ABD-El-KADER, and make him feel
perfectly at home. - -
The first instalment of his native country is to be delivered by the
Messageries at his door on Monday, and the scene-painters have already
begun a minaret, the like of which has never been seen in Paris since
the palmy days of the Jardin Turc, when Juliº EN used to frighten the
rentiers of the Marais with his quadrilles of blue and red fire, and his
bomb-and-cannon waltzes. A body of Arabs is likewise to be given as
a guard of honour to ABD-El-KADER, as soon as the termination of the
Carnival will allow of the dresses being spared for such a purpose.
We feel a novel pleasure in recording this honourable fulfilment by

Rumour is, in fact, a great deal like a rich uncle in a º who goes
about ºf purses, which on inspection are found to contain
nothing but old benefit cards, and checks for the gallery. No sooner
had DR. SUMNER been summoned to accept the See of Canterbury,
than Rumour began giving away the vacant Bishopric of Chester to
half-a-dozen people at once, though only one could be destined to
obtain it. e greatly regret that Rumour is not amenable to a Court
of Law, where she might be sued for compensation by those whose
hopes have been raised and cruelly disappointed by her valueless
generosity.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 81
MR. PUNCH FOR REPEAL.
Y DEAR RAY,+If the office of Repeal Warden for the Fleet Street
district of London is vacant just now, I would be very glad to offer the
humble services of self and paper to forward the º cause which you
have at heart., The Repeal ranks, I am happy to tell you, are rapidly
increasing in this country. The exertions of your amiable clergy and
leaders are procuring a host of converts. By a little judicious manage-
ment and further, perseverance, you may make your favourite measure
80 º: in England that the best Irish patriots will be surprised, and
that the most selfish Saxons, among us will desire no longer to baulk
you. You have but to continue in a course of resolute begging and
cursing, and I make no doubt the desired end will be brought about,
and the †. Saxon will be anxious to break off from a Union
which only brings him back bad language for his money.
I, for my part, confess myself converted. TUAM and GALway º;
gered my belief, and ARCHDEAgoN LAFFAN uprooted it altogether.
am for a quiet life, and a Parliament where you may compliment one
another. What is the use of meddling? It is expensive and not
useful. There is a fellow near the National Gallery of London, who
keeps what he calls “a happy family,” whereas it is a family of slaves
the tyrant lords over. They isorderly I warrant if they were left to
themselves, they would be quiet before long. There might be a slight
quarrel at first ; a few feathers would be scattered about the cage,
probably; some members of the family might be missed from their
perches; but the end would assuredly be peace.
I, calculate that ARCHDEACON LAFFAN, like a venerable worthy
| | | Christian as he is, has made the country a present of many scores of
|H, thousand pounds. I will put my own case, not for the sake of ostenta-
-s & tion but illustration. I give a £5 note to the Irish fund in ’46; I am
sº ready with another for the winter of '47. The Archdeacon preaches a
9sº eulogy upon the dashing lads of Tipperary, and says that there is no
cowardly Englishman of us all that the pluck to stand behind a
edge and fire a few slugs into a dastard of a landlord. The purse-
strings close up. Tipperary shall have no more of it. We can lay it
- - out at better interest in this .#
Of how many well-disposed English gentlefolks of his own persuasion do you suppose the ARCHBishop of TUAM has buttoned up the breeches
pockets? No gentleman prefers to be cursed for a scoundrel, or to be abused as a thief and ruffian, when he is coming with the º intentions
to relieve an amiable fellow creature in distress. If you take out a º of broken victuals to a beggar, you do not expect that he will
throw them in your face, and condemn the poor innocent eyes into which he flings them... At least (whatever their desires may be) the
infernal artifice, and shrewdness of English gentlemen in distressed circumstances, induces them to keep their tongues quiet, when they are
actually on the begging business, and never to curse those from whom they hope to beg again, until they are out of hearing. The †† are
i.; niggardly and timid villains. We are obliged to coax and wheedle them, into charity:
they are too glad of a pretext for buttoning up; and the national cowardice of our alms-givers
no i. face a little abuse and foul language, than an Italian sailor will put out to sea in rough
weather.
We cannot help it. We are—as you kindly and constantly show us—naturally cowardly and
deceitful. You are open and courageous in Ireland. I admire the frankness of a man who holds out
his hand and says, “For the love of Heaven, you infernal scoundrel, give me your money, and I
should like to dash your brains out.” I admire him; and that, I say, is why I am and declare myself
a Repealer. I am for not being abused, for not having to pay money any more, and for not having
my brains dashed out. -
I have been led into the above amiable train of thought by looking over one or two late Irish
newspapers, and the excellent MR. John O'Connell's letter from §§ to his dear RAY. He
went to church, he says, where a funeral oration was pronounced over his late father by the ABBé
LAcoRDAIRE, and where ladies, the noblest, the fairest in the land, went round through the immense
crowd, when the sermon had concluded, to collect for the relief of the suffering people of Ireland,
and even the very poorest there contributed his mite with a willing and an overflowing heart:-
“O how the contrast struck me when I saw the artisan, the humble mechanic, the poor stall-keeper,
thus generously and cheerfully giving to the relief of the irish (with whom his country is bound in
no bonds of state connexion), between the conduct of these poor men and the heartlessness of the
statesmen, and legislators, and press-writers of wealthy England, who, after plundering, us for
centuries, refuse us the smallest assistance in the extremity of that misery which has been brought

It is clear, from the above, that the French congregation at Notre Dame subscribed a great deal
more than all England; and f wish you joy, my dear RAY, of the handsome sum paid up. . It is clear
that the English press-writers, and others have been plundering MR. J. O'Connell, and friends for
centuries; that we have brought a potato disease upon you and denied you the smallest relief; that
four or five hundred thousand pounds paid over honestly, squeezed out of all sorts of pockets—from
rich, men by hundreds, from men of small means in small remittances, from mechanics, private
soldiers, maid-servants, school-children, in sixpences and pennies—is not the smallest relief at all, and,
indeed, is a much less sum than five or sixthousand francs collected in the plates at Notre Dame. -
I don't know, for my part, about having plundered MR. O'Connell, for centuries; but I suspect that the famous Irish monarch, whose crown

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MONSTER MOTION.
MR. Anstey's motion is a misnomer; for how can we attach the ideº
of motion to an affair that brings itself and everything else to a dea
stand-still. We have a vague recollection of a certain Chartist petition
that was wheeled into the House of Commons on a truck, an broke
down the table it was ordered to lie upon. MR. Chisholm ANSTEY’s
motion is still more ponderous and voluminous; for as it expanded, it
fairly pushed everybody out of the House by its extent and ponderosity.
l STEAM CHICKENS.
We believe it was the benevolent wish of HENRI QUATRE that his
poorest subject should have a fowl in his pot, MR. CANTELO promises
to realise the philanthropic desire of the royal mind to the benefit of all
men. He proposes to prorogue the sittings of poultry sine die, and to
supply the world with fowls, turkeys, guinea-fowl, and pheasants, by
means of hot water. “Millions,” says MR. CANTELQ, j boldly,
“have been spent in fruitless attempts” to relieve female poultry from
the cares of a family—by hatching chicks in hot rooms or ovens. , Now
MR. CANTELo—the eggs granted—will produce any given number of
chicks by the application of “top contact heat,” conveyed by, “a
current of warm water flowing over an impermeable water-proof cloth
beneath which eggs are placed.” Thus, chickens may be produced
beneath a cloth, as multitudinous as mites in a cheese. . Consequently,
the price of poultry must drop to nothing. The guinea-fowl must
change its name, and become at most, a bob-chick. Again, when the
rocess is improved—as of course it will be—we see no reason why the
{j potato-men should not hatch poultry in their street ovens, and
sell a fine young pullet and a real “kidney” for twopence.
Our only fear of the success of the experiment—as explained by MR.
CANTELo—arises from “the artificial mother.” We have great fears
that the filial affections of the poultry will ever be developed. For
how can a chick feel its heart expand and beat towards a “number of
warm pipes, about an inch and a quarter in diameter, and about the same
distance apart, resting on supports about five inches from the floor?” A
step-mother is proverbially careless and indolent.
hope from a steam-mother?
evertheless, according to MR. CANTELO, art is above nature.
instance, he charges it against, the living mother that she “
tramples on the chickens—this always injures and sometimes destroys
them.” Again, she is apt to gad about ; when, “if the brood is
For
she took with her!” When hens are made to acknowledge, this, how
very small they will feel themselves, contemplating the sobriety and
maternal love of a number of warm pipes, about an inch-and-a-quarter
in diameter!” . With filial yearnings—if they have any at all-towards
steam, how curious it will be to watch a brood of chicks nestling about
a tea-kettle. - - -
MR. CANTELO has noble Spartan notions touching deformed chickens,
We think his ideas on this head quite worthy of attention and practical
imitation by Boards of Poor-Law Guardians. For MR. CANTELo with
patriotic sternness observes—
“In all cases of deformity, it is most economical and humane to destroy the chicken.
If a cross-bill, it always grows worse, and will finish by not being able to eat at all, and
a stiff-leg is pulled about, and made miserable by the other chickens; and, innsmuch as
a deformed chicken would not have left the nest of the mother, it is not worth while to
attempt to do better artificially. I have hatched a duck with three legs, that is, an im-
perfect and extraordinary one, proceeding from below the root of the tail. This lived and
did well, as it had two good legs to stand upon; but the third one was often pulled at by
the others.”
. How many a lame duck of the Stock Exchange must envy such a
bird—having, at his worst need, two good legs, at least, to stand upon.
We confess to be greatly taken with MR. CANTELo's enthusiasm;
nevertheless, the doubts we have must speak out... We fear, then, a
great increase of cases of deformity. We fear that, in process of time,
poultry, thus, artificially hatched, will, in their shape, assimilate to
nothing but “a number of #. an inch-and-a-quarter in diameter.”
Chickens, forlorn things, will be hatched without merrythoughts; and
turkeys-like peace-loving “friends”—think drum-sticks quite beneath
them, Let not the reader believe our fear fantastic; it is justified by

M. Solzer remarks of the swine in Normandy that
above all other breeds, “they stand very long on, their hind legs.
And the reason to ourselves is obvious. The swine have, in the course
of generations, thus adapted themselves to the wretchedness of
Norman roads. They have gradually grown upon stilts for more con-
venient walking. Again, M. Roulis declares that certain horses, in
many examples.
South America were taught “a peculiar pace, which is a sort, of running
amble.” And what has been the eventual result? Why, “these
horses became the sires of a race to which the ambling pace is natural,
and requires no teaching.”
It is these instances that make us fear for the future figures of our
poultry. Instinctively knowing that they are hatched by steam, fowls
may bulge into the shape of tea-kettles, and instead of clucking, fizz!

MERCY WITH A WENGEANCE.
PUNCH, seeing the Right, Honourable. Baronet, SIR George GREy,
in his place, at the head of the Home Office, begs to ask him if the
subjoined statement, which has appeared in a newspaper, is true. It
relates to one BARBER, a solicitor, who, together with a man named
FLETCHER, was transported in 1844 for forging wills:—
“BARBER invariably protested his innocence, which was also asserted by his fellow
convict; but they were both sent to Norfolk Island. It is stated (though from what
cause we are unable to learn) that a special order was sent from the Home Office,
directing the severest treatment to be º to BARBER, which order was rigorously
enforced. This excited the attention of the reverend chaplain of the colony, others,
who instituted an investigation, and hence his liberation. The REv. T. Roorks, one of
the chaplains, certified that the treatment of BARBER was of the most galling severity: he
was restricted to the barrack-yard ; he was ordered to perform the most loathsome
duties; he was deprived of the indulgence granted him by the medical officer; and he
was the only prisoner interdicted from writing materials; whilst the physical toil he had
to undergo was altogether disproportionate to his strength. . . . This statement is
confirmed by the Rev. Mr. TAYLon, who gives other particulars of the convict's “misery
and torture.” These statements, and the result of an inquiry made by the efficer of the
settlement into BARBER's case, were forwarded to the Home Office, and a reply was
received, announcing a pardon for BARBER, on condition that he should never again set
his foot in Great Britain. Within the last week MR. BARBER has arrived in France,
having been sent from Sydney by public subscription.”
Punch trusts that the Home Secretary will lose no time in giving the
above libel—for surely it is such—on the Government, the most un-
qualified contradiction. So often has the Home Office been accused of
granting pardons for nothing, and without indemnification, that people
are actually beginning to believe it to be capable of such injustice and
absurdity. It . absolutely acquired a bad name through neglecting
to clear its character. No doubt many of the public are disposed to
regard the present monstrous imputation on it as true. t must
they think on that supposition? Why, they will ask, if BARBER is
innocent, is he forbidden to return to his country? Not for what he
has done, of course; is it, then, for what he has suffered? Would his
presence be intolerable to those who, in their fallibility, were the
authors of his misery and torture? Is he banished merely as an eye-
sore? Or is a man to be º: for having been found guilty, no
matter whether he is guilty or not? Is it an axiom of the Executive
that a convict is a kind of victim, who must on no account be let off
altogether?. “The quality of mercy is not strained,” but the Home
Qffice, at this rate, strains the mercy of the Crown most grievously,
Can anything be conceived more unjust, more inhuman, and more absurd
than the treatment of unfortunate BARBER P Such will be the questions
and such the comments to which the Government will stand exposed,
if the Home Secretary will not take the trifling trouble of repelling this
apparently serious, but really (of course) perfectly ridiculous accusation.
A “Superior” Pony,
THE following appears in the Times:–
XEMPT from TAX—a superior PONY EQUIPAGE, (lowest price, to
prevent trouble, 27 guineas,) late the property of a clergyman of the Church of
England, by order of the executors. The Pony is young, sound, and quiet,”—&c. &c.
That it is thought expedient to advertise the Pony as the late property
of a Clergyman of the Church of England is only—for the avoidance of
extra advertisement expense—to roll up every equine virtue into one
short sentence. The pony being, as it were, of the Church—that is,
having in some measure imbibed the virtues of its master—is not a
crib-biter, nor a kicker; he bolteth not; neither doth he shy. Whereas,
had the beast belonged to a sectarian, he might have been .. objec-
tionable as a canter. Truly, this is an odd compliment to the Church
of England, to couple it thus adroitly with the Mews.

SURVEY OF LONDON.
CossIDERABLE, alarm has been excited in the minds of some of the Londoners by the
appearance of soldiers in sundry high and elevated positions, commanding the metropolis,
or at least some of the most important parts of it. One of the towers of Westminster Abbey,
which immediately overhangs the Houses, of Parliament, is at this moment mysteriously
manned by a military party, who, it turns out upon inquiry, are engaged in a plan for levelling
the Metropolis at the request of the Sanitary Commissioners. Directly this, fact was made
known, the consternation, ſº that of the lower classes about Tothill Street and its
vicinity, increased in a painful degree, for their only idea of the levelling of the Metropolis
suggests to them its being levelled with the dust in the ordinary manner. They exclaim that
it is the act of an Insanitary rather, than a Sanitary Commission to give orders for the
|-levelling of London; and though they have been told that the process includes its triangu:
| lation, or reduction to º, it has been found impossible to drum into them a just
appreciation of what is going forward. Some old women belonging to the party of the Duke
of WELLINgton believe that London is already in the hands of the French, and that they are
on the top of the Abbey, holding in abey-ance the formidable power they are about to exercise.
It is satisfactory to know from Lººp John Russelſ, that our foreign relations are in an
amicable, state; though it will be difficult tº make the nervous portion of the population
believe this, while *: men are walking about the streets with a machine that seems like
a cross between a telescope and a howitzer.

FINE ARTS.
G. Hupsos, Esq.; Madame Tussaud Fecit.
THE Iron. King is the last addition to MADAME Tussaud's unrivalled collection. It is
altogether, a superb work of art. We should, perhaps, have preferred the figure had it been
covered with Dutch metal, as more calculated to strike the vulgar with the awe that all the
lower orders ought to feel on the contemplation of a man with a million or two of money.
Madame—as we learn from the catalogue—has very judiciously padded the waistcoat of
MR. HUDSON with Bank paper; and his coat-tail pockets are filled with real sovereigns,
which, upon payment of an extra sixpence, as at the Chamber of Horrors, may be seen and
handled (of course, under proper surveillance) by the visitors. Independently of this, there is
great elevation of character about the figure. The face is placed towards the Mint, and is
possessed with a contemplative, sallow cast of thought, as though arising from an earnest
and unceasing study of bullion. .
Perhaps throughout the whole collection—composed as it is of the finest specimens. of.
human power and human genius—there is no figure like this, the last, of G. Hudson, Esq., so
calculated to make a deep and wholesome impression upon the English mind. Wha
t, for
instance, is JENNY LINDP. Only a cherubimic genius. What Pope Pius IX.? Only a mam
who has awakened a nation from the stupor of despair. But GEORGE Hupson, Railway
Rex, he is the incarnation of wealth, the man of gold, and as such is to be worshipped by
every man who glories in the name of Englishman.
PARLIAMENTARY GRAMMAR.
SoMEBODY-we forget his name—used to stick
up his laws with such a tremendously long pole
that nobody could read a word of them. he
had lived in our day, he would have Fº: the
regulations for omnibus-drivers round Nelson’s
cocked-hat in Trafalgar Square, and stuck on the
railing, of the top gallery of St. Paul's, a little
F. prescribing some duty to the citizens of
ondon, who in default would be exposed to a
penalty. It is true that we do not indulge in
such tricks as these in our own day; but we
adopt other means of placing our laws above the
comprehension of those who are compelled to
abide by them. One of these plans is to wrap
them up in such very mysterious lan that
no one can understand their meaning. The
Sanitary measure just introduced by Loºp
MoRPETH has the honesty to avow this error
of our Acts, and to remedy it as far as possible
|by starting off with a grammar and dictionary
to assist the peruser of the intended statute.
This grammar breaks up all the old connections
of relatives and antecedents; tears asunder the
ties that have hitherto existed between singular
and plural; contains a separation clause between
masculine and feminine-like that in the old
Poor-law for dividing man and wife; and inflicts
a series of other violences upon our ideas of pro-
priety in the art and mystery of authorship.
There is, nevertheless, something. º:
forward, and sofar satisfactory, inº: boldly
this shall mean that, and that's mean the
other, however different, they may appear, in
contradistinction to the old plan of putting into
an Act of Parliament a certain number of words
without any meaning whatever, and leaving the
solution to be arrived at by the lawyers. Every
one knows that a lawis, in nine cases out often,
|no law at all until it has undergone the process
of being interpreted by the Judges; and as this
interpretation often varies according to the cir-
ºcumstances of the case, we get that charming
yariety or glorious uncertainty, for which our
laws are remarkable.

CoLouB-SERGEANT PUNCH may
be heard of any day at 85, Fleet
Street; having received a com-
mission from his friend the Duke,
to raise an invincible Rifle Corps
from the fast young fellows of
London, to be known as the Punch
Rifles; or the Death's Head and
Cross-bone Fascinators.
At a moment like the present,
when the insulting French, are
marshalling their forces thick as
periwinkles on . the coast, the
oung British Lion has (except a
oyal payment of the Income-tax)
one only duty to fulfil—this is at his
over hours to rush to arms;, that
he may have his bayonet always
ready for the haughty stomach of
a proud invader. -
SERGEANT Punch is above ad-

the British youth. Else, he might beg their polite attention to the statue
(on horseback) of F. M. Tº Duº or Wººington. But no; he
scorns to ask’em—what should prevent them (every one of 'em) from
having a horse apiece out of the gratitude of their countrymen? SER-
GEANT PUNCH would not pander to a low passion for renown, but he
cannot help remarking that should the French come—as they certainly
will—laurels will be found growing as thick and as green upon Dover
beach, as upon the rock of Gibraltar, or the field of Waterloo.
How beautiful is the Bed of Glory, when BRITANNLA—like a weeping
Chambermaid—tucks her heroes up to rest ! -
SERGEANT PUNCH does not wish to inflame the passions of the young
men of London; but he feels himself called upon–in the words of à
great powder-monkey, that has seen the world, to exclaim—“Open your
eyelids—rise upon your legs—or be for ever in the dirt 1"
When the Guards quit London en echellon by Hyde Park—how gal-
lantly will the Punch Rifles deploy, in a half-moon, by the Regent's
Crescent!
Therefore, all young men who are tired of “the governor,” rush to
SERGEANT Punch, 85, Fleet Street. Bounty, any amount—and the
latch-key up to any hour.
One tier of boxes is engaged at the Opera for the Punch Rifles
during the campaign. However, as a slight reward for alacrity, the
last !". enlist can have no other accommodation than the stalls.
The Morning Roll will be served precisely at eleven. After which,

At one, rifle exercise will take place in Trafalgar §. where a
full attendance of nursery maids and others may be confidently expected.
(None but the brave deserve the fair.) -
At three, the corps will march off the ground (in summer, to GRAIN-
GER's for ices; in winter, for soup). -
At five, in summer, the corps is expected to show in the Park; horses
(BATTY's best) being provided for the occasion. The medical certificate
of a well-known physician can alone excuse from this otherwise indis-
pensable duty.

tellers, and conjurors, hired to come in with the dessert.)
No furlough above a month for Brighton, or wherever pressing
business may call, can at one time be granted. There is no doubt,
however, that it will always be renewed upon polite application to
head-quarters.

His Royal HIGHNESs PRINCE ALBERT, to crown the glory of the
corps, has, in the handsomest manner, invented a cap for it; having
condescended to take as his model, Punch's own. It is not yet deter-
mined whether the aforesaid cap will have bells; but if so, the corps
. rest assured they will be of the very best and most melodious

FISTICUFFS AT CAMBRIDGE.
According to the Times, gown and town riots have been lately very
prevalent at Cambridge. The Proctors have been obstructed in the
performance of their duty in conveying dissolute characters to the
‘Spinning House.” The townsmen have rallied round the *g. and
vagabonds, and the Under-graduates round, the Proctors. turday
has been the great field-day for these skirmishes, owing to the influx
into Cambridge on that day of bargees and butchers; in consequence
of the j of which description of persons, the scales of

to be wished that these Saturnalia, or Saturday-nalia, could be put a
stop to. It may be all very well that Proctors should be Wranglers, but
it is rather unseemly that they should also be fighters.
The Worst Come at Last.
SoME idea may be formed of the distressing effect of the new Budget
on the public mind, by the following anecdote, for the authenticity of
which we pledge our character and our cocked-hat:--An individual who
was brooding over the financial statement, suddenly started up with a
loud yell of Eureka! and a frantic exclamation that he had caught, a
pun. The moment the poor fellow's senses had settled down sufficiently
to allow him to explain his meaning, he declared that the tax on Incºme
being odious, might be called a very INCOME-opious Tax indeed. The
patient seemed better when this weight was taken of his mind, and he
was as well as could be expected when we last inquired. .
Fashionable Changes.
THE use of Chloroform has become so general, that we should not
wonder at cases of insensibility being brought up before the Magistrates.
How horrible it would be to read in the police reports, “Miss ToMKINs
fined 5s, for being found insensible under the influence of Chloroform.”
A change has come o'er the spirit of our drams! We no longer drink
—we only breathe. Drunkards are led away now literally, by the nose.
There is no more drunkenness—the word for it is “obliviousness.”

INITIALS.
MYSTERIES OF THE
WHO is not acquainted with the second column of the Times? It is
the spot where fond initials love to discourse; it is the electric tele-
graph between the most distant letters of the alphabet. It is the
whispering-gallery between father and son; the dispassionate mediator
between husband and wife. It has other duties, also. It is in the
second column generally that parcels, carts, and horses, that have been
left too long, appeal to their owners to be taken away, or else they will
be sold to pay expenses., Heirs-at-Law, who went to bed last night
without a sixpence, find themselves the following morning the owners
of thousands, and the second column is the first to bring them the
pleasant information. ..Its generosity does not end here. It is con-
tinually offering tempting rewards for information, and giving the best
price for old evidence, or mislaid deeds, lost lap dogs and absent keys
of tea-caddies. It is also the shady lane where parted lovers agree to
meet, and plan their little plots against parental despotism.
A beautiful poem, full of romance and sad reality, might be written
upon the second column of the Times, and if MR. Col.BURN will allow
us our own terms, we don’t mind doing it. We would clothe the naked
initials with the most glittering names, dress up the blanks most gor-
geously, and ornament those long dashes in the most approved style
of fashionable agony. Every “break” should have its due share of
pathos, every advertisement its full three volumes. In the meantime,
we give a vivid illustration of A.B., who was implored in last Monday’s
paper to return to his disconsolate friend, and everything would be
. to his satisfaction. C. D., in the background, is the imploring
mediator.
PASTIMES OF THE CITY POLICE.
THE Police in general should be an active body of men; but activity
ought to be the peculiar attribute of the City Policemen. ALDERMAN
WILSON lately stated, under an official examination, that he “has heard
the Police say that it is very difficult, to catch a thief in Smithfield,
because he jumps into the pens, and they cannot catch him.” The
City Police must be put under a course of gymnastic exercises, and
practised in vaulting and leaping at the bar, in order that they may be
enabled to compete with the thieves at this unequal game of hide-and-
seek. Perhaps the City authorities would do well to select their
constables from the peculiar sect called Jumpers . We did not know
till now that one of the “vested interests” of Smithfield consisted in its
being a playground for thieves and policemen. This, however, is one
of those interests which we would respect; and we would therefore
have the cattle-market and pens removed, that the parties might play
at prisoners’ base with a little more chance of prisoners being taken.
SUDDEN DEATH OF MB. WHIG.
WE regret to announce the sudden demise of this respected gentle-
man, that took place a few days ago at his residence, Morning Chronicle
Office, No. 332, Strand . He i. been for some time in a delicate state
of health; and it was plain to his oldest friends and acquaintance that
his mind had, for some time past, been somewhat wandering and un-
settled upon topics, which, for many years, he had discussed with
considerable energy and straightforwardness.
All circumstances reviewed, the end of the deceased may be considered
somewhat sudden; and though no inquest was held
upon his remains,
there is a suspicion riſe in the neighbourhood and elsewhere, that he
did not come to his end by fair means. It is, indeed, very loudly
whispered that his brains were knocked out by a bag of money. The
truth of this, however, time will develop. -
The business of the deceased continues to be carried on by another
party. It is honourable to the feelings of the successors of the departed,
that they did not attempt to interfere with the expression of woe
indulged in by the household of the defunct, all of whom have been
presented with decent, weepers, tastefully borrowed from the back
numbers of the Chronicle. And in these days of political tergiversation,
it is peculiarly grateful to record the devotion of one mourner—a gentle-
man from the sister-isle—who, upon hearing of the decease of MR.
WHIG, and of the succession of the purchaser of the effects of the
defunct, instantly drank off the contents of his inkstand, shivered the
vessel to atoms upon the floor, cut his goose-quill, took his hat, and
rushed for ever from the premises.
“THE KING CAN DO NO WRONG.”
It seems generally admitted that there is one thing more dangerous
in railway travelling than either a long-bodied engine, a leaky boiler, a
broken rail, or a drunken engineer. This monster danger is the presence
of KING, Hupson in the train. His Majesty is, it appears, in the habit
of stopping in his royal progresses for odd jobs, official gossips, hasty
snacks, receiving addresses, laying foundation-stones, &c., and the time
consumed in these stoppages is made up by a tremendous increase of
pace, which often ends in a smash, as appears from two or three recent
newspaper accounts of accidents so caused. The Iron King, no doubt,
trusts to the hardness of his material, and perhaps confides in the
monarchical principle “The King never dies.” But his subjects have
no such comfort or confidence. “Quidguid delirant reges, plectuntur
Achiri; ” or in English, “Passengers suffer for the absurdity of kings.”
f Wºº to suggest that a Royal Train should be kept exclusively
or ills
ajesty and suite, as, after all, kingship should always be a
limited monarchy, and cannot extend, with any safety to Constitutions,
over the lives and limbs of persons subject to be smashed. At present
no man ever starts on a railway trip with KING, HUDsoN
cipating a premature arrival at that terminus from which there are no
“passenger-returns.”
THE ST. JAMES'S CLOCK.
THIs disreputable horlage is continuing its irregularities notwith-
standing the kindly notice we have taken from time to time of the
vagaries it has been in the habit of practising. Latterly it has become
actually incoherent in its speech, and when it proceeds to make itself
heard, it goes on at such an extraordinary rate that a few days ago it
repeated the hour of twelve twice over, in a manner far more striking
than comprehensible. The inhabitants were of course very much dis;
usted and puzzled by this twice-told tale with which the clock had
een misleading its auditors.
We have made inquiries into the circumstances of this unhappy
clock, and find that extreme old age may account for the trembling of
its hand, the garrulous uncertainty of its clapper, or tongue, and other
melancholy symptoms. The clock was, in fact, presented to the parish
by QUEEN ANNE, and if that is the case, the case must be worn out,
while the minute dots marking the minutes, may be regarded as the
signs of second dotage.
Workhouse Wine.
A correspondent of the Times states that in the Sussex Union
three paupers
“were ordered port wine by the surgeon of the Union, and in each case home-made
port only was allowed by the Board of Guardians—the home-made port being “a species
of sloe-juice,” which was procured at the grocer's shop, at le. 6d. the bottle.”
Of course. What can be more in accordance with the workhouse
system than the harshness of the sloe What more incompatible with
it than the generosity of the grape?

THE DETOXICANT.
A discovery of an article called a Detoxicant has just been made;
but what a Detoxicant is, we are at present quite incapable of deter-
mining. As far aslexicography can assist us, a Detoxicant seems tº be
something exactly opposite to an intoxicant, and is doubtless of a nature
to de-toxicate any one
already labouring under
some intoxicating influ-
ence. If we are correct in
our surmise, the detoxicant
ought to be placed in the
hands of every member of
the police force, for the
purpose of facilitating the
management and subjuga-
tion of those refractory
persons who happen to be
excited by too much drink.
The detoxicant is doubt-
less some liquid of the
chloroform mature, and will
be the best substitute for
the violent action of the
stretcher that can possibly
be conceived. The an-
nexed illustrations show
the repentant individual -
soothed by the detoxicant, in contrast to the furious drunkard, whom
a stretcher is necessary to control and remove.
THE “FRIAR LAURENCE” OF TUAM.
THE Bishop of TUAM, in another long letter—reeled off like twine
from a roller—to the EARL or SHREwsbury, gives the following simples
as the materials from which his lordship has extracted public opinion
in England:—
“The hemlock of the Times, the nettles of the Examiner, the docks of the Morning
Post, and the poppies of the Morning Chronicle."
The meek and pious man of St. Jarlath's mightily reminds us of
Friar Laurence, “with a basket,” about to turn over the leaves of his
morning simples:-
“Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer, and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds, and precious-juiced flowers."
And the Friar of St. Jarlath's, having culled the Times, the Morning
Post, the Chronicle—with an occasional picking from the Jºraminer-
casts the simples into the alembic of his own malice, and therefrom
extracts the “leprous distilment” wherewith he writes his Christian
communications!
Chloroform at Billingsgate.
In the shop of the benevolent and poetic TAYLOR, of Lombard
Street, there is—we learn from a correspondent—this benign notice:-
“Oysters *Pººl, and their beards taken off, under the influence of
Chloroform ' " A greater wonder, however, is achieved at Billingsgate;
for there eels are skinned under the like circumstances; and, in the
words of our correspondent (evidently a female), “they are skinned
and know no more of having their coats taken of than a 'toxicated
husband.” The simile is alike flattering to eels and husbands.
As BRoad As It Is Long—MR. ANSTEy's Motion would have formed
a capital barricade at Paris, as we have not heard of a single person

THE MARKETS.
It is a saying no less trite than true, that song can elevate the lowest
themes, and that metre, if it is only gas metre or coal metre, gives
dignity to the subject to which it is applied. Acting on this impression,
we have endeavoured to impart an interest even to the state of the
Markets, by throwing them into verse. We imagine a mercantile man
attempting to entice the votary of pleasure to the pursuits of business
by cº his attention to the prices of the day, through the captivating
medium of song.
AIR-"The Light Guitar.”
Oh leave the gay, the festive scene,

And come with me, for now I mean

And as I note the oats and hays,
The iron—pig or bar,
The pork, the barley, and the maize,
I’ll say what prices are.
I’ll tell thee how the mutton leapt
From five to six the stone,
And how inferior beef was kept
At rates before made known;
I'll tell thee how fat lambs were high—
As fat lambs always are;
And if the tail you’d wish to buy,
I’d get thee one at par.
NATURAL PHENOMENON.
ONE of the most remarkable of natural phenomena is the wonderful
effect produced upon the age of a child by its becoming a passenger by
a railway or on board a steamboat. In the earlier stages of juvenility
it is a singular fact that infants who have for some time maintained a
respectable footing, relapse suddenly into the position of children in
arms, for whom, it will be remembered, no fare is payable. , Perhaps,
however, the most i. result is shown in the variableness of
the human stature amongst children under ten years of age, as exem-
lified º the payment of half fares at railway stations ai on Steam-
oats. It is of course impossible to doubt the assertions made by the
parties on these occasions; but we think it might be made a sine gud
non, with, every boy under ten, whose height is above five feet, to
produce the register of the date of his birth, before being entitled to
travel as a half-price passenger.
There ought really to be some Statute of Limitations, passed in
favour of steamboat and railway Directors, so that, the half-fare regula-
tion should be confined to individuals not exceeding a certain height;
or the Company-like the cabmen—might have the option of charging
either by time or by measurement. Some arrangement of the kind is
imperatively called for, now that the season for locomotion is coming
on, or the traffic accounts will suffer by the deception of those who,
from their high standing, ought to be above a practice worthy only of
|littleness.
THE WINDOW-TAX.
ood MR. PUNCH,
The Opera has begun: and allow me to
suggest to the CHANCELLOR of The Ex-
chequer, that, if he is still determined to
| make the poor pay for their window-glass,
that the rich ought to be taxed for their
opera-glass. Neither do I see why people
wearing spectacles ought not to pay the
window-tax.

THE Bad Boy who said. He Didn't can E.
THERE was once a Boy, who was a Small, but a Good Boy, and
his name was Jack. Now JAck had a snug Place, but he had
a great deal of Work to do in his Place, that he might keep
it, which it was hard to do at all Times, for there were some
who would have been glad to get him out. But though Jack
was a Good Boy, he was rash, and when he had the wish to do
a thing on which he had set his Heart, he would make up his
Mind that, let who would say “Nay” to him, he would go on
with his Work, and run all Risks to gain his Point. No one
could blame JACK for this, when he was right, but it might chance
that he would be wrong; and still he would say all the same,
“That he did not care, for he would try and get his Way for
all that.” So, once on a Time, he met with a fine Brute,” who
would roar out and grow fierce if a Slight were to be put on him.
But Jack was so rash that he made up his Mind to fly in the
Face of this fine Brute, who was, in fact, the King of Beasts,
and whose Roar was so loud and so fierce as to strike all who
heard it with great Awe. But Jack, who thought the King
of Beasts had put on a fierce Look, and set up a fierce Roar in
a mere Joke, did still say he did not care, till once Jack came
right Face to Face with the King of Beasts, who was in a great
Rage, and Poor JAck, who felt he was too weak to brave the
Rage of a Brute so bold and so strong, did run back in time
from the Course in which he had set out. At least we hope that
the Boy Jack will be a Good Boy, and will be so wise as to .
take our hint, for Jack ought to know by this time that “Don’t
Care came to a Bad End.”
CHARMING simplicity.
A Young gentleman, seeing several tickets in a haberdasher's window,
announcing Men's Woollen Comforters, Stout Men's Wight Caps, and Superior
Cotton Men's Hose, went into the shop to inquire whether he could be pro-
vided with any of the Mens conscia recti, which he understood to be the best

FASHIONABLE LABORATORIES
CHEMICAL evening parties now are all the rage. About a year
ago nothing was heard of in fashionable circles but gun-cotton-
Ether then was introduced after coffee, and flirtations carried on
without either party being sensible—as is often the case in such
matters—of what they were saying. Now Chloroform has invaded
our parlours and our drawing-rooms. It is the inspiration of all
our balls, and it is almost dangerous to talk at a soirée now; for
at the very first breath you may forget yourself and behave in the
most senseless manner. It will be the etiquette this season, we
suppose, to ask a young lady, not to take an ice, but “a glass of
Chloroform;” and after-supper speeches will be conducted by the
host inquiring of his guests, “ º are you all Chlo-
roformed?” and then he will de is toast, to the very great
relief, probably, of the company. -
This chemical joviality, however, must beavery greatsaving. We
don't know the exact price of Chloroform, but a whole hogshead of
it cannot be so expensive, we imagine, as cold chickens and barley-
sugar pagodas, to say nothing of bombon mottoes and crackers, for a
hundred people. We doubt if FARADAY would charge for a supper
as much as GUNTER; though, in enjoying our midnight meal we
must say that the economy of it is the very last thing that enters
into our thoughts, or mouth, either. We would sooner have one
tumbler of champagne than the very best bottle of Chloroform you
could offer us. If we are to be insensible, we prefer choosing our
own way of becoming so.

Female Disabilities.
WE wonder that the ladies, who are so easily agitated, have not
articipated in the agitation for removing Parliamentary Disabi-
ities. There is much to be said in behalf of their claims to Mem-
bership of the House of Commons. They constitute a large number
of important interests; for instance, the Silk interest, the Leghorn
interest, and the French glove and shoe interest are almost exclu-
sively composed of them. It is obviously absurd to pretend that they
would be unable to speak; the contrary objection, indeed, would be
better founded; but from no female tongue in England, we willum-
dertake to say, would the House ever endure such an infliction as
that which itsuffered the othernight from MR. Chisholm ANSTEY's.

POST-OFFICE LABOURS.
THERE is something pitiable in the probable position of the posſmen,
who upon the new regulation coming into force for the transmission of
books by post, will be obliged to waſk about with whole libraries upon
their shoulders. The ordinary little leathern bag will be rendered
utterly useless; and nothing short of a porter's knot will suffice for the
new burdens the postmen will have to bear.
We do not, in fact, see how one man can accomplish a delivery under
the new arrangement; and it will be necessary for the Post-Qffice to
provide trucks immediately, to be drawn by two or more postmen, in
order to convey the piles and packages of printed volumes that will be
forwarded through the post.
We are not very desirous to see an increase of the Estimates; but we
do hope, that since it has been determined to require a combination of
the strength of HERCULEs with the activity of MERCURY, the poor
postman will get some addition to his present paltry salary.
A GENUINE “DOO.”
THE subscribers of the Art-Union were surprised last week with the
distribution of a print, which has been due we cannot tell how long.
Many could scarcely believe their eyes; others sent it back as a
mistake; whilst a few looked upon it in the light of a large Valentine
the title and º very much helping that impression. They could
not understand why a soldier should have chosen a large roll of flannel
to sit upon in the open air. ...We have taken the trouble to look at the
print twice, and must, say, it does not appear anything like a riddle to
us, for it is just as bad as any of the prints that have preceded it. We
could trace a great deal that was unfinished—as if th. engraving had
been done in too great a hurry. We implore the Committee to take
more time over their next specimen. It is a pity a Pºint should be
spoilt for the want of a few years to perfect it. The “Convalescent”
ought never, to have come out, properly, before 1858, and we are sure
many subscribers would have been better pleased if it had been deferred
even later. We are sorry to see such a fine Society hastening its own
ruin. We are loth to condemn, but it must be recollected we have
proofs of the very blackest dye before us.
The Queen of Spain a Jewess.
WE learn that at a late grand fancy ball at Madrid, the QUEEN OF
SPAIN appeared sumptuously drest and diamonded as a Jewess. BARON
Rothschild, had he seen her, would, it is thought, have lent mone
enough upon Her Majesty wherewith to satisfy all the English bond-
holders. There are various reasons given for this assumption of the
Hebrew lady, by Her Majesty. The one best authenticated is the
following:—She appeared as a Jewess, having no fear that her matri-
monial happiness would ever induce her to claim the Flitch of Bacon.
** A SEWING MACHINE.”
This invention has been recently exhibited at the Royal Institution.
The stitches, larger or smaller, are made by “turning a screw.” . Is
there anything new in this?. On the contrary:, have not English shirt-
makers—sewing-machines of flesh and blood–been made to work for

FASHIONS FORETOLD FOR THE FAIR.
THE Ladies are sadly puzzled to understand the articles appearing in
the newspapers under the heading “Money-Market and City Intelli:
gence.” They wonder how the prospects of the country can be affected
by a dull row of digits and confused fractions. “What has the War
with France to do,” they ask, “with ‘Reduced 3 per Cents. at 72}}},
steady buyers ?’” -
But though, all this is Greek to them, yet the Ladies have their
revenge. Is there a man in England bold enough to declare that he
thoroughly comprehends the monthly descriptions of “The Fashions?”
Our vain search for such a man had well-nigh lapsed into silent despair
when an individual presented himself who asserted that he had
discovered the secret of these mysterious compositions. Punch is too
patriotic to patent the discovery; and in order triumphantly to con-
vince his fair readers that the cabalistic paragraphs alluded to, are now
perfectly intelligible to any gentleman who peruses them, he begs to
subjoin a specimen by the inventor of this new mode.
It will be observe
Fashions for a period, in advance. Indeed this wonderful man con-
fessed to us, that the chief direction to be attended to, was to interlard
the sentences well with French—never minding, of course, whether the
foreign terms were apposite or not.
MARCH FAshions.
Morning #...ºf is as much in *g. as last month for
the bodies of sleeves and morning dresses. Skirts generally critique,
and flounced with ticken of some lively hue, as puce, or apropos. The
head-dress sometimes finished with a berthe. . . -
Walking Costume.—Dimity boas are now quite in fashion. Gowns
should be of the elegant shape called trousseaur, or looped with
attache. Ladies moving in the highest circles are not unfrequently
seen in bonnets of rechauffé trimmed with corduroy to match. A light
scarf of quilted crenoline, or a shawl lined with artiste or coupe, gives a
graceful finish to a good figure. Coup d'oeuil is not so much in vogue
for muffs; but those made of blasé, are beginning to be the rage.
Parasols, to be in the highest fashion, should be of bombazine à la
récherché, but we have noticed a few of the beautiful fabric carte blanche.
Evening Dress.-The hair should be dressed a la papier maché for
young persons; but those who wear caps should have them high in the
stomacher, which looks well when made of printed taffeta. Gingham is
now the favourite colour for trimmings, and the bias should be wholly of
brown Holland, and placed cap-à-pied, the curtains being dependant from
the ſº. d'appui of the gusset. A distinguished belle, a leader of ton,
lately appeared in the ball-room, carrying a tuck in her hand. Mauvais
sujet is in high favour for handkerchiefs; but papillots for shoes are
quite gone out.
RIWAL MONSTERS.
Two Exhibitions of a somewhat similar nature have taken place in
London during the same week. We mean the Whale at the Fox-
under-the-Hill, and MR. CHIsholm ANSTEY’s Monster Motion. They
have both been exhibited on the banks of the Thames. The first
measures fifty-six feet; and, though no one has had the patience to
measure the second, still, there is not the smallest doubt that it is
longer, if anything, than the first. It is just the same dead lumber,
also-nothing but a large, heavy mass of useless matter, scarcely worth
the cutting up. It is lucky the same process of preserving it has not
been tried by means of the diodorizing fluid, or else it might have
encumbered the floor of the House of Commons for months, and have
obstructed the regular current of business. ... ---
...We propose that the two monster curiosities be exhibited side by
side, so that their gigantic proportions may be viewed together, #.
for the absurdity of the thing. We are inclined to believe that
ANSTEy's Monster Motion would decidedly win by several lengths, as it
is well known that the jaw of the whale is exceedingly small. In fact,
several Members have declared the impeachment of LoRD PALMERSTON
to be so excessively “like a whale,” that if it were extended along the
one now lying near Hungerford Bridge, that, competent judges would
really be puzzled to say which was which, and which of the two lied to
the greater extent.
Episcopal.
It is not often that the Bishop of Exeter treats himself to a harm-
less jest. He is, constitutionally, much too serious for that. Within
these few days, however, Doctor PHILPotts has perpetrated a joke of
the sardonic order. When the Bishop of St. DAVID's avowed that he
saw no harm in the Pope's title of “Sovereign Pontiff,” the Bishop of
ExETER, with pointed allusion to his Welsh brother, declared “that it
was no wonder the boat of the Church was in danger of sinking, with
so large a leak in it!”
that the author has no difficulty in prescribing

THERE is always something melancholy about nobility in reduced circumstances;
but the present distressed state of the British Lion is one of the saddest spectacles
of fallen greatness that ever was known. Unhappily the British Lion is quite
unable to turn his hand to º; to enable him to get an homest livelihood, and
he has not even the art of ºf y to resort to for the purpose, of embellishing
the pavement with the words, “I am starving,” or any other similar appeal to the
sympathies of the public at large. The Protectionist party can do nothing for him,
and have ceased to value even his roar, though we cannot blame them on this
account, for a mere roarer is rather an unprofitable sort of animal after all. We
wish there were some place at which the British Lion could be at once “taken in
and done for,” since it is next to impossible that the §. brute could have its
damaged constitution freshened up, for it is evidently beyond all hope of repair.
The feebleness of the beast prevents him from becoming dangerous, or some pro-
vision might be made for him, under the pretext of its being unsafe to let }.
remain at large.
LORD DUNCAN’S PROTECTIVES.
LORD DUNCAN, in moving for the repeal of the Window Tax, is reported to

who were coming home from the East and West Indies, we should put a musket

the metamorphosis of the truncheon into the musket. . The Police are not unprac:
tised in desperate charges: besides, they have long been accustomed to defend
our hearths and homes from burglars. At all events, they would greatly embarrass
the French; who, as their late insurrectionary movements clearly show, have no
notion of what it is to cope with an effective Police.

“T H E T H R E E B I R T H S OF FRANC. E.”
UP from the coast post follows post; each minute brings its tale;
Rumour meets rumour open-mouthed, and feverish and pale:
Along the wires electric fires flash tidings to and fro;
A great world-birth is breeding—France is again in throe.
Two such births she had borne before—the first, an awful birth,
A giant with a bloody hand, its stamp still stains the earth;
For blood, not milk, his mother's breasts he tore with hunger keen,
His lullaby the Carmagnole, his toy the guillotine.
But races twain met in his strain with adverse workings strong,
An angel and a devil—pure Right, and hideous Wrong:
This urged his red right hand to slay, that moved his left to save,
Half murderer, half martyr, half hero, and half slave.
The tomb that closed upon him closed on his evil too;
But the good bore fruit and flourished, and gave birth to good anew ;
And the world sees in his memory, with wonder and with awe,
How bannings grew to blessings, and lawlessness to law.
The great light of the future was gathered in his gloom;
The great tree of the future hath its roots within his tomb.
And the wisdom of the wise has taught how, in that wintry morn
Of the closing eighteenth century, a mighty child was born.
And forty years had sped away, and in the summer prime
France was in child-birth pangs again, as in that earlier time;
And Europe watched around the bed where that fair mother lay,
And a second Revolution came to the light of day.
A milder, meeker, gentler child than that first giant he,
No blood-stain on his hand was seen, to check the gossips' glee;
Yet stern of look, and sinewy, more mighty, as more mild,
Was he the world then welcomed, a bland and blameless child.
No Ca Ira rang round his bed, no red cap decked his brow,
And the world said, “Surely France will be a happy mother now!”
He had all his brother's beauty, but nothing of his frown,
More than his strength for building up, if less for pulling down.
And for a nursing father they gave the child a king,
And they girt him round with charters, and laws, a stately ring,
And they looked to see him grow to man in free, unchecked advance,
To be a blessing to the world, a glory unto France.
A wily man that fosterer was—he had lessons learnt enow,
And men read Right and Law and Truth, writ on his wrinkled brow.
And much he talked of honour, and much of Peace did phrase,
That Monarch of the Barricades, King of the glorious Days.
“I’ll rear this child on truth,” he said. He reared it all on lies.
“Its freedom I will strengthen.” He sapped its liberties.
“I live for it and France.” Both France and it lived but for him.
“I’ll make its name all glorious.” He stained its honour dim.
For the guard of law about the child, he placed a guard of swords,
Its craving for realities he fed with hollow words;
For its loving friends of liberty he paid to despots court,
And when it asked for guarantees, he built it up a fort.
Whenever he said Principle, behold it turned to Pelf;
Whenever he said Country, behold it turned to Self.
Till the infant's strength grew weakness, its constitution shrunk,
And helot-like it walked the world, with wine of falsehood drunk.
No wonder that the child grew sad and sickened, day by day;
No wonder those who loved it fell, one by one, away;
No wonder all the hopes that smiled around it at its birth
Sunk, slow and silent, from its path, and left its heart a dearth.
We heard the tale with sorrow—yet dreamed we nought the more
That the last hour was nigh at hand, the footstep at the door;
But so it is—its drink, its meat, empoisoned all with lies,
That second child, at bare seventeen, a rotten carcase dies'
And France is in the throes again, and who upon the earth
May say what frame and feature will mark this latest birth P
But take warning, anguished mother, from the sad tale we have told,
Beware such kings for fosterers—kings who love lies and gold.

No one can deny the Scotch credit for being at least
an ingenious people; and if any proof of their
being so were desired, it would be found in the
title at the head of this article. Some gentle-
men at Glasgow are trying to start a “Bank of
Character and Skill,” into which any one may pay
in what Character he possesses, and draw it out
again as he happens to want it. It seems to be
roposed that every customer of the Bank should
draw bills upon himself, or give promissory notes
in his own favour, and that these should i. dis-
counted by the establishment upon no other
> security than the bonus he pays by way of entrance-
fee. This bonus is regulated in a style that says
much for the odd appreciation our Scotch friends
have of the value of reputation in different capa-
cities. A gamekeeper is put on a par with a
governess, for the fee º from each, on
opening an account with the Bank of Character,
is five shillings.
Of course the fee is proportioned to the value of the article; and
we think therefore the railway world ought to rise up and protest against
the estimate of “half-a-crown to five shillings,” at which the Bank of
Character has rated them, the former sum being the same as that
demanded from “a footman of the first class,” if he should be disposed
to pay in his Character to the Bank in question.
There is one portion of the operations of the Bank that puzzles us a
great deal; namely, how the department for the deposit of Skill is to be
conducted. We are at a loss to perceive in what shape such deposits
can be effected. Is a lady's-maid, for instance, to send in to the Bank
a portrait of her mistress dressed for a Ball? or is a nurse expected to
deposit an infant with the Bank as a proof of her Skill in looking
after it? A first-class footman could perhaps deposit a mould of his false
calves, in which his Skill might be satisfactorily shown; but when we get
to gamekeepers, cooks, ship-masters, and Government officials, the shape
their deposits of Skill would assume puzzles us exceedingly. , Perhaps
some of the Directors will give us some information on this head, and
at all events let us know whether a deposit of this article with the
Bank, as a specimen of the author's literary Skill, will be sufficient to
obtain for him a thousand a year as a contributor to a solvent, well-
paying, liberal periodical. e shall have no objection to keep a balance
of a couple of conundrums, or a five-pun note, in the hands of the
Directors, if they can insure for us, by way of interest, an income of a few
hundreds a year as perpetual punster to one of the Quarterlies.
A Compliment to our Neighbours.
BARBER, the attorney found guilty of forging a will, and transported
for life, has felt the eccentric mercy of the Home Office. . He has been
conditionally pardoned, that he does not return to England. He is now
in France. Surely something must be wrong here. Either the man is
innocent, and ought to be welcomed with every sympathy to his native
country, or he is guilty, and ought—considering the gravity of his
offence—ought to remain still a convict. But the Home Office tempor-
izes, suffering the man to go anywhere but home. He is now in. Paris.
Very well. The Home Office—it is a compliment—may think him
honest enough for France, but not sufficiently i. for England.

FLUTTERING OF THE FEATHERED TRIBE.
THE birds have been thrown into a state of the utmost consternation
by the proceedings of MR. CANTELO, who has overturned, or threatens
to overturn, the nests and other cherished institutions of the feathered
tribe. A meeting has been held, which we are sorry old AEsop is not
alive to report, and several resolutions have been agreed to against the
new hatching system, which is calculated to stifle some of the best feelings
of henhood and, chickenhood, by severing the parental ties, and placing
an old tea-kettle in loco parentis for the goslings, ducklings, pullets,
and others, who inhabit the world of poultry. We find we were

creation into the vapours, and though warm water is, in fact, º;
by MR. CANTELo, the poultry complain bitterly of ibeing called into
existence by such wishy-washy means. - -
It is quite evident, by the perturbation among the birds, that there is
something hatching in º to MR. CANTELo's hydro-incubati

MAKING THE MOST OF I.T.

of intelligence coming from Paris, and have dealt it out in doses of
truly homoeopathic dimensions to their respective subscribers.

been made up of tremendous type, forming a variety of catch-lines
similar to the following:—

All this works exceedingly well, as far as the sale of our contemporaries'
papers may go; but it has been rather tantalising to the numerous
urchasers, who thought they were going to get something extraordinary
or their money, instead of an Extraordinary Express with the same
thing over and over again in it.
Who Harbours Another Man's Dogf
Two little boys—we cull the story from the Stamford Mercury—
having enticed a valuable dog, not their own, into Easton Wood, set it
upon a rabbit. The boys were fined for poachers; and the dog was
sent to Burghley, to LoRD EXETER, that he might have a look at the
quadruped offender. The dog has been applied for, but has not been
returned to the owner. And, for our part, we trust it never will. As
boys of twelve and fourteen are fined under the Game-Laws, we do not
see wherefore a valuable dog, offending against the statute, should not
be, duly castigated. “Love me, love my dog,” says the proverb.
“Fine boys, and confine their pointer,” implies a game-preserving
nobleman.

HINTS FOR MR. ANSTEY’s NEXT MONSTER MOTION.
WE do hope that on the next occasion upon which MR. Asstey may
favour the world with a Monster Motion, he will dress it up in a
h manner somewhat more attractive than that with which he has inv
his recent exhibition. The following style, for instance, would have
been far more telling than the common-place twaddle he thought
proper to adopt, while the truth would have been adhered to almost as
closely as it was in the honourable Member's statement. The following
is a brief outline of such a speech as he might have spoken:-
MR. ANSTEY, in moving for papers, condemned the policy of Lord
PALMeRSTON, as a policy that had not only destroyed the present,
blighted the future, and with retrospective infamy tarnished the ;
of the past. Italy he had unnecessarily meddled with; and by having
too many Italian irons in the fire, he had burnt his fingers at last.
As to Turkey, he had so truckled to the northern autocrat, that Turkey
had not a drumstick it could call its own.
He (MR. ANSTEy) would now turn to Egypt, and he would then ask
the House to look at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, and then say
whether LoRD PALMERSTON ought to show his face again. His treat-
ment of Circassia has completely stopped the growth of that promising
trade in Circassian Cream, which º: luxuriance to our º: When
these charges, were all responded to, he (MR. ANSTEy) should have
another wheelbarrow full of documents to read to the House; but in
the meantime he would give LoRD PALMERston an opportunity of
answering the accusations now made.
Statistics of Torture.
A PARLIAMENTARY return, quoted by the Times, states that “the
total number of persons º to the punishment of flogging in the
Royal Navy, in the year 1847, ºf to 860, and the number of
lashes inflicted upon them to 26,228.” The compilers of the return, we
suppose, were not arithmeticians enough to express in figures the cor-
responding amount of human agony. That, however, may be left
safely to the imagination. -

SHAKSPEARE's House. Many of the Council defended their vote by
reason that they had never heard of SHAkspeaRE before, and that if
they voted money for strangers in one instance, “there would soon

HE appearance of a London
/K \ → ** – Club at a time of great excite-
y - --~~ ment is well worthy the re-
~\ ,---- mark of a traveller, in this
*~' --~ –––– city. The Megatherium has
been in a monstrous state of
frenzy during the past days.
What a queer book it would
be which should chronicle all
the stories which have been
told, or all the opinions which
have been uttered there.
. As a Revolution brings out
into light of day, and into
the streets of the convulsed
capital, swarms of people
who are invisible but in such
times of agitation, and retreat
into their obscurity as soon
as the earthquake is over, so
you may remark in Clubs,
that the stirring of any great
news brings forth the most
wonderful and hitherto un-
heard of members, of whose
faces not the habitués, not
even the hall-porters, have
any knowledge. The excite-
ment over, they vanish, and
are seen no more until the
next turmoil calls them forth.
During the past week, our beloved Megatherium has been as crowded
as they say HER MAJEsty's Palace of Pimlico at present is, where dis-
three in a room; and where it has been reported during the whole of
the past week that Louis-PHILIPPE himself, in disguise, was quartered
in the famous garden pavilion, and plates of dinner sent out to him
from HER MAJESTY's table. I had the story from Bowy ER, of the
Megatherium, who had seen and recognised the ex-king as he was
looking into the palace garden from a house in Grosvenor place opposite.
We have had other wonderful stories too, whereof it is our present
purpose to say a word or two.
The Club, in fact, has been in a state of perfect uproar, to the disgust
of the coffee-room habitués, of the quiet library armchair occupiers,
and of the newspaper-room students, who could not get their accus:

The rush for second editions and evening papers is terrific.
Members pounce on the news-boys and rob them. Decorum is overcome.
All the decencies of society are forgotten during this excitement.
Men speak to each other without being introduced. I saw a man in ill-
made trowsers and with strong red whiskers and a strong northern
accent, go up to Colonel the Honourt ABLE Otto DILLwATER of the
Guards, and make some dreadful remark about Louis FEELIP, which
caused the Colonel to turn pale with anger. I saw a Bishop, an Under
gravity and eagerness to little Bob NoDDY, who pretended to have
brought, some news from the City, where they say he is a Clerk in a
Fire Office.
I saw all sorts of portents and wonders. On the great Saturday night
were always known to go to bed at ten. A man dined in the Club who

should be shut, no papers taken in, and the waiters marched to church
under the inspection of the Steward, actually came down and was seen
j the Observer, so eager was the curiosity which the great events
In the smoking-room of the establishment, where you ordinarily
meet a very small and silent party, there was hardly any seeing for the
smoke, any sitting for the crowd, or any hearing in consequence of the
prodigious bawling and disputing. The men uttered the most furious
contradictory statements there. Young BIFFIN was praying that the
rascally mob might be cut down to a man; while GULLET was bellowing
out that the safety of France required the re-establishment of the guil-
. *qual four heads must be had, or that the Revolution was not
complete.
In the card-room, on the great night in question, there was only one
whist-table, and at that even they were obliged to have a dummy.
CAPTAIN TRUMPINGTON could not be brought to play that night; and
PAMM himself trumped his partner's lead, and the . heart; such was
the agitation which the great European events excited. When Dicky
CUFF came in, from His Excellency Lord PILGRIMSTONE's evening
§: a rush was made upon him for news, as if he had come from
attle. Even the waiters appeared to be interested, and seemed to try
to overhear the conversation.
Every man had his story, and his private information; and several of
these tales I took down.
“Saturday, five o'clock. JAwKINs has just come from the City. . The
French Rothschi LD has arrived. He escaped in a water-butt as far as
Amiens, whence he went on in a coffin. A fourgon containing two
hundred and twenty-two thousand two hundred sovereigns, and nine-
and-fourpence in silver, was upset in the Rue Saint Denis. The coin
was picked up, and the whole sum, with the exception of the fourpenny
piece, was paid over to the Commissioners at the Hotel de Wille.
“Some say it was a quarter-franc. It was found sticking, afterwards
to the sabot of an Auvergnat, and brought in safety to the Provisiona
Government.
“BLANKLEY comes in. He made his fortune last year by the rail-
roads, has realised, and is in a frantic state of terror. “The miscreants!'
he says. “The whole population is in arms. They are pouring down to
the English coast; the sans-culottes will be upon us to-morrow, and we
shall have them upon—upon my estate in Sussex, by Jove' CoBDEN
was in a league with the §. government, when he said there
would be no war—laying a trap to lull us into security, and so give free
ingress to the infernal revolutionary villains. There are not a thousand
men in the country to resist them, and we shall all be butchered before
a week is out—butchered, and our property confiscated. CoBDEN
ought to be impeached and hanged. Lori, John RUssel.L. ought to be
impeached and hanged. Hopes GUIzot will be guillotined for not
having used cannon, and slaughtered the ruffians before the Revolution
came to a head.” N.B. BLANKLEY was a liberal before he made his
money, and had a picture of ToM PAINE in his study.
“Towzer arrives. A messenger has just come to the Foreign Office
wounded in three places, and in the disguise of a fishwoman. Paris is
in flames in twenty-four quarters—the mob and pikemen raging through
it. LAMARTINE has been beheaded. The forts have declared for the
King and are bombarding the town. All the English have been
massacred.
“CAPTAIN SHINDY says, “Nonsense! no such thing.” A messenger
has come to the French Embassy. The King and Family are at
Versailles. The two Chambers have followed them thither, and MARSHAL
BUGEAUD has rallied a hundred and twenty thousand men. The Parisians
have three days' warning: and if at the end of that time they do not
yield, seven hundred guns will open on the dogs, and the whole canaille
will be hurled to perdition. -
“PIPKINsoN arrives. The English in Paris are congregated in the
Protestant Churches; a guard is placed over them. It is, with the
greatest difficulty that the rabble are prevented from massacring them.
LADY LUNCHINGTON only escaped by writing ‘Weuve d' O'Connell’ on
her door. It is perfectly certain that GUIzot is killed. LAMARTINE
and the rest of the Provisional Government have but a few days to live:
the Communists will destroy them infallibly; and universal blood, terror,
and anarchy will prevail over France, over Europe, over the world.
“BounceR-on the best authority. Thirty thousand French entered
Brussels under LAMoRiclere. No harm has been done to LEopold.
The united French and Belgian army march on the Rhine on Monday.
Rhenish Prussia is declared to form a part of the Republic. A division
under GENERALBEDEAU will enter Savoy, and penetrate into Lombardy.
The Pope abdicates his temporal authority. The Russians will cross the
Prussian frontier with four hundred thousand men.
“Bowy ER has just come from MIVART's, and says that rooms are
taken there for the Pope, who has fled from his dominions, for the
Countess of LANDSFELD, for the KING of BAvARIA, who is sure
to follow immediately, and for all the French Princes, and their suite
and families.”
It was in this way that Rumour was chattering last week, while the
great events were pending. But oh, my friends! wild and strange as
these stories were, were they so wonderful as the truth?—as an army
of a hundred thousand men subdued by a rising of bare-handed
mechanics; as a great monarch, a minister motorious for wisdom, and
a great monarchy blown into annihilation by a blast of national breath;
as a magnificent dynasty slinking out of existence in a cab; as a gallant
prince, with an army at his back, never so much as drawing a sword,
but at a summons from a citizen of the National Guard, turning tail
and sneaking away; as a poet braving the pikes which had scared away
a family ot kings and princes, and standing forward, wise, brave,
sensible and merciful, undismayed on the tottering pinnacle of popular
power? Was there ever a day since the beginning of history, where

small men were so great, and great ones so little? What satirist could
ever have dared to invent such a story as that of the brave and famous
race of Orleans flying, with nobody at their backs; of wives and hus-
bands separating, and the deuce take the hindmost ; of Ulysses
shaving his whiskers, off, and flinging away even his wig P. It is the
shamefullest chapter in history—a consummation too base for ridicule.
One can’t laugh at anything so miserably mean. All the Courts in

misconduct of a regiment does an army. It tarnishes all crowns.

THE ART OF RECEIVING A DEPUTATION.
RISE as it enters. Beg of it to be seated. Throw yourself into your
arm-chair, cross your arms and legs, and listen most attentively. Take
especial care that no expression escapes your countenance. Admit
nothing; but just nod occasionally. Beware of a direct answer. The less
you know of a subject the better; if you are wise you are lost. Let every
one talk as much as he pleases; let the whole deputation talk together
if it likes. It flatters them and protects you from accidents. In fact,
say as little as you can. Show all your zeal in listening and taking
notes. Dispute nothing. If facts are rather too strong for you, only
express your surprise. A well-timed “Indeed l’ is frequently the
saving of an hour. All arguments are dangerous; they only waste
time; you do not want to be convinced, and as for convincing the Depu-
tation, it is hopeless—it comes alre { convinced. If pressed for an
opinion, express your sympathy with the important cause, and make a
note in your memorandum-book to give, it your earliest consideration.
If the Deputation does not retire, call in the Revenue to your aid
enlarge on its deficiency, run largely, into imports and exports, an
wind up with a sharp flourish about the British Constitution and the
interests of the community. -
At this point your servant should announce some important visitor.
Rise, and |. your Deputation to the door, after thanking it P.
for its trouble and intelligent advice. Shake, one or two gentlemen by
the hand, and the next º: account of the Deputation will inform
you that “every one was highly delighted with the extreme courtesy
and affability of the Honourable Lord.” Don't look in the glass,
however, for fear of laughing.

AWFUL POSITION OF MR. DUNUP AT BOULOGNE.
.OUR departed friend, MR.DU.NUP, who, as all the world, and especially
his creditors, well know, departed by the boat for Boulogne about two
months back, has been placed in a most awful position by the French
Revolution. Bayonets were urging him from behind; but if he looked
towards England, writs were threatening him in front; and, turn which
way, he would, his case seemed a hopeless one. Nothing, since the
celebrated case of the Soldier, who was proprietor of a certain popular
tear, which he “wiped away,” can compared to the touchin
dilemma—for touching it would have been, if he had allowed the bailiffs
to fraternise with him—of MR. DUNUP. We have placed the whole
matter in the hands of our Poet, who has drawn up the following
version of the affecting incident:— -
Upon the pier he turn’d
o take a mental look
At his credit and his creditors,
Whom basely he forsook.
He conjured up the sound,
So familiar to his ear
Of “Please to settle this account;”
And answer'd with a sneer.
He reach'd his .#. |
A trembling took his knees;
He found in Paris there had been
A most tremendous breeze.
“A bas les Anglais /* roar'd
Directly in his ear, . .
Told him there was not time to pause—
He sought again the pier.
He look'd on board the boat—
Oh! do not deem him weak;
For desperate was DUNUP's game,
The game of hide-and-seek.
Go watch him at Boulogne,
You’ll find him on the pier;
He’d rather risk the bayonets there,
Than brave the bailiffs here!

Louis-PHILIPPE, according to the Morning Post, on the day previous to
his overthrow. He certainly did hold France in his hand—for he has
let her slip through his fingers.

J.E. MIVART presents his humble respects to the Crowned Heads of
the Continent, and to the various branches of Foreign Royalty in
eneral, and begs to be allowed to inform his Royal Patrons that his -
Hotel, Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, continues to be the favoured -
House of Call for Dethroned Potentates in general.
Animated by the sincerest feelings of gratitude for all favours past,
J. E. Mrvant begs to assure his Imperial and Royal Patrons that
nothing shall be wanting on his part to continue to secure that patro-
nage which has already made his humble Hotel an historical edifice in
the annals of the political world.
With these feelings, J.E. Mºva RT has, in the handsomest and most
cºmmodious manner, decorated, furnished, and generally fitted up his
Establishment, in order that his imperial and Royal Guests may, as
completely as circumstances, will permit, continue, though exiled, to
feel themselves whilst in his house upon their old thrones at home.
J. E. Miyant ventures to believe that passing events will justify a
somewhat detailed description of the peculiar domestic conveniences
offered at his Hotel to Royalty upon its travels. And this, the more
especially, as this cardis int
liberal.
The EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA—should events not necessary
to be more particularly alluded to induce him to come to

be put in the back yard), with an eruption ready at a minutes'
notice. J. E. M. confidently hopes that the superior quality
of the brimstone will tend to make His Majesty feel himself
quite at home.
Her Majesty Queen Isa BELLA of Spain may depend upon

another three years. It does not stop them. Another continuation is
soon published, and the interest of it is found to be so absorbing, that
we are obliged to continue it whether we like it or no. Our grand.
children will still be taking in a work, the prospectus of which stated
was to have been finished in three annual volumes. , Let us run through
the several chapters which have already been published of this inte-
resting little periodical.

that it is to be completed in three years. This chapter was very

were happy in the content of others.
ChapTER THE SECOND.
This was published in 1845, under the superintendence of LQRD
John Russelſ, who had already proved his . in similar produc.
tions. This chapter by no means enjoyed the great popularity of the
first. This, however, was known to be the usual fate of any continu-
ation of a popular series, and caused, therefore, no great astonishment.
The circulation still kept up the same, for those who had taken in the
first series did not like to discontinue the second. Numbers, accord-
º were sold, and it must be acknowledged that the second chapter
did not fall off from the first. It was full of the same strong effects,
and took immensely.
Cilapter. The Third.
1847-8.-This chapter is still in course of publication; and it would
not be fair on our parts to anticipate its contents. The Income-Tax

cipate. We can safely say this much, that the enthusiasm for the work
has quite died away, and that, stron

Income-Tax on a permanent footing, to be issued regularly like the

activity with their Expresses ºf the last week or two, and have

We caught ourselves frequently reading the same thing over and over
again, having omitted, in our hurry, to take notice of the announcement
at the top, that “All of this important intelligence was given in our
yesterday's edition,” or that “The whole of these interesting particulars
will be found at length in our paper of to-morrow.” - -
We may compliment most of our contemporaries on their activity
though we have occasionally been doomed to find more cry than woo
in the relays of “latest intelligence,” whose announcement has beguiled
our pockets of sundry sixpences. In some instances we have been
informed by Extraordinary Express that “our correspondent has nothing
occur it will be communicated in a later edition.”. The “later edition”
is, of course, eagerly bought, and frequently with the same result, ºr
perhaps with the more tantalising intimation that “Important, Intelli;
gence is believed to be delayed by bad weather; but if the wind
should abate in time for the next edition, there will be something to
communicate.” -
Some of our contemporaries, have published fresh, editions to state
that “there is nothing fresh” except the breeze, “but a steamer is
waiting in case of anything occurring worth transmission, when details
will be published in a later edition.” -
We have a great mind to announce that we have the brains of a
contributor in a state of eruption, emitting jokes as fast as the fire is
sent forth from Mount Vesuvius, and that we have a boy stationed at
the door to bring us the reports or explosions of his turbulent in-
tellect. We might easily get up a tremendous excitement about a
discharge of puns, and intimate that the

We had some idea of imitating one of our evening contemporaries,
and sending a man on horseback at full gallop down Holywell Street
every five minutes, with a boy stationed at each end of the thorough-
fare to exclaim, “There goes the Punch Express!” but as our contem-
porary has to pay more for inquests and accidents, caused by riding
over the populace, than he can hope to realise by the extra sale of his
journal, we relinquished the ostentatious enterprise. We had the
notion at one time of copying a “dodge” of one of our pictorial con-
temporaries, who keeps a gang of foreign-looking persons at the door
i. which are promised in placards filling the windows; but as we
thought our window might be seen through, we avoided even this
harmless subterfuge.
We pretend, firefore, neither to steam-packets, extraordinary
couriers, pilot-boats, or anything else, nor do we even keep a man in
readiness to break his neck with the earliest news or no-news that may
arrive; but we think of starting a “life-buoy” at the foot of Blackfriar's
Bridge, by way of experiment. We do not expect that it will do much,
but it will afford us at all events the right to talk about our communi-
cations from the coast, which our contemporaries are all so mad about.

THE MYSTERY UNRAVELLEE).
AN earnest appeal was made the other day, through the second
column of the Times, to the writer of a Walentine containing the line
“I long'd an Afric's slave to be,”
to come forward and “unravel the mystery.” As we are wholesale
unravellers of mysteries in general, we have set to work upon the
matter, and have procured a copy of the original Valentine, which we
subjoin, and which, it will be seen, presents, a mystery that rather
requires unravelling. Such was the hieroglyphic that formed the
Valentine in question, and the meaning of which is certainly quite latent
enºugh to justify a demand that the sender of it should come forward
unravel the mystery.”
and
The following poem, which º: the tableau, does not much
tend to the elucidation which was called for in the advertisement:-
When the gay bulbul, light of wing,
Bore in its mouth the wedding-ring-
When o'er the church it flew with glee,
Nor stopp'd to perch on neighbouring tree–
When heart was closely joined to heart
# CUPID's skewer-resembling dart—
hen with the breath he gently drew,
The fire of love the urchin blew—
In lovers' knots when ringdoves bound
Were softly cooing on the ground—
When sights like these I chanced to see,
“I long’d an Afric’s slave to be.”
Thus far the Valentine; but now for the unravelling of the mys-
tery. The fact then is, that the contemplation of so much º:
in which he could not participate, was more than the writer could bear,
and he accordingly
“long'd an Afric's slave to be,”
in order that he might get away from it.

This is a very ancient maxim; but, if kings do not take care, it will

KING O'PHILLIPS FOR 1 RE LAND 1
CH-s—LM A–st—y To John O'Connell, M.P.
“SIR—ALTHOUGH I have not yet made it a part of my impeachment
of LoRD PALMERston, I intend to do so. Yes: The accusation—I
have to prefer—will be continued in my next. In the meantime, I take
the widest, the strongest, and the deepest means (need I allude to the
pages of Punch *) to inform all Ireland of the chains that at this moment
are being forged for her; forged by the traitorous Foreign Secretary, to
whom treason is a labour of affection.
“For many days, the whereabout of the Ex-KING OF THE FRENCH
has been kept a secret. He has been at Dreux—at Eu-at Tréport—at
Herne Bay. Such have been the conflicting rumours of a venal press.
All, of course, to put the world upon a wrong scent, until the iniquity,
for some days hatching, shall receive portentous birth.
“Now, Sir, prepare to be astonished ; for I am about to inform you
and the bamboozled world at large, of the real hiding-place of the late
KING of The FRENch.
Know, then, that his Ex-Majesty is at this
moment—and has been for some days, past—at No. 3, Carlton-House
Terrace. Yes; in legal phrase, he is there “harboured and comforted”
by Wiscount Paiversion, the Foreign Secretaryl
“I am the last, man to suggest any intrusion upon the privacy of
fallen greatness; but—if you doubt the veracity of my information—
I have only to direct you to the above address. Knock at the door,
rush by the porter, run up-stairs; and on the third-pair back (turning
to the right, you will see a cut-glass handle to the door) you will find
the royal fugitive. There he is, seated in an arm-chair covered with
Russia leather, which (stuffed with Russian bank-paper) was a grateful
present of Nicholas, for work done, to the Foreign Secretary. ...There
is the º; in that Russian chair, with his feet upon a Turkey
carpet, the bribe of the Sultan; there he is, with a Persian cat (the
souvenir of the Shah) bridling at his royal knee; with his royal but
exiled elbow leaning on a º mahogany table, the gift of CHRISTINA
for winking at the Spanish marriage. There is the King, Sir (at the
hour I write) with a cup of tea before him—the tea the gift of the
EMPEROR OF CHINA, in recompense for a certain foreign treaty that
sacrificed the interests of the English merchant; the tea sweetened by
the sugar of Brazil, originally sent in a loaf, to purchase the destruction
of the West Indies—milked from a Brahmin cow (the gift of the East
India Company)–and stirred by a spoon, a small item of the exten-
sive service of plate manufactured at the mine's mouth in Peru, to buy
the Foreign Secretary to the interests of the republic. . I might, Sir,
give many other particulars touching the furniture of that back-room-
nay, of every moveable of No. 3—but I am the last man to be personal.
“Well, Sir, you will ask wherefore should LoRD PALMERSton—the
Foreign Secretary of England—give an asylum to the castaway Louis-
PHILIPPE. Listen.
“The KING OF THE FREnch cannot leave, off a crown. After
wearing one for nearly eighteen years, it is—he declares—as needful to
his health as flannel.
“The KING OF THE FRENch is desirous to purchase another kingdom
—to lay down so much ready money for it—and, Sir, (now prepare to
shriek)–LQRD PALMERston PROPOSEs to SELL HIM IRELAND !
“Yes! You clench your patriotic hand–you strike it on your heart
(I knew you would)—you gaze towards the ceiling and—no, you are too
much of a gentleman—you don't swear.
“For these past three days, whilst even the Chronicle—a public organ
that Lord PALMERSTON has ceased to grind—has preached of Louis-
PHILIPPE's wanderings in France, his Majesty has—I repeat it—been
lodged at No. 3, Carlton House Terrace, bargaining for the purchase of
the ‘first flower of the earth and first gem of the sea;' and they are
now-after much haggling on the king's part—sold to him as though
the flower was of no more worth than a daisy, and the gem as common
as Margate shingle.
“‘Ireland was PEEL's difficulty’—said PALMERston to a friend I
could name—“but I have turned it into ready cash. We are the first
Ministry who ever made a penny by it.”
“I have not yet made my mind up to publish the precise sum paid by
Louis-PHILIPPE for the throne of Ireland; but I shall be quite prepared
–when the time comes—to summon to the bar of the
- - - - ommons the
identical clerk from CouTTs's who cashed his Majesty's cheque.
“I shall also be quite ready to call MR. — to the bar, to prove that
he received instructions to make out the conveyance deeds. This much
I will, however, venture to state without further hesitation. -
“Qf course, Ministers said nothing of the transaction. It was their
selfish policy to keep it secret until they secured the Income-Tax.
“It is not yet settled when his, Majesty will take possession of
Ireland, but I think I may venture to predict that it will be on the
very earliest day of April.
“The king—in order that certain passages of his Paris life may be
forgotten-proposes to cast aside his present name as he would change
dirty linen, and to mount the throne (which in this case he has ordered
of cast-iron, not to be consumed by fire) under the title of O'PHILLIPs
THE FIRST |
“I can assure you that the King re-enters upon Majesty with the
greatest vigour, and in the highest spirits...MR. SHIEL, the Master of
the Mint, has already been to advise with him respecting his new
coinage: and already MR, John LEECH, and MR. RICHARD D9XEE
have been solicited to supply designs for the Five Pat Piece and the
OPHILLIps-d'or. (A hand closing an umbrella, for the obverse, has
been suggested, as significant of the brevity of the royal reign.)
“Messrs. STORR&MoRTIMER have taken the king's hat to measure for
the new crown (of gilt silver); a light, tasteful thing composed of sham-
rocks, and enriched with polished º: of the real Blarney Stone.
“Mr. Moses, from the Minories, has been honoured with an order
to make the royal robes of the very best cotton velvet, to be trimmed
with real fox. Mr. Moses was, I am informed, kept in ignorance of
the rank of his customer; Lond PALMERSTON, in his wily, way,
assuring the single-hearted tailor that “the old gentleman was a bit of
a character, and only wanted the robes for the purpose of a masquerade.
“And now, Sir, having communicated to you a part of the designs of
LoRD PALMERston, it is for you, as the Patriot of Erin, to determine
for the seven millions who look all the way up to you; it is for you to
say whether you will take the Son of Gaul in exchange for the hated
Saxon. I will not tell you the name I have already heard as determined
º ºise O'Phillips as his Prime Minister for life; but it begins
with O'C. -
“Again, it cannot be denied that KING O'PHILLIts comes with *
ready-made royal family. There is NEMOURs, and D'AUMALE, and
Montpensień, each ready to head an Irish invading army; whilst
ADMIRAL Joinville, in command of the Armada of the Liffy, ...} pour
his thunder on either side of the Thames. This, it must be con essed
will be revenge on the blood-thirsty Saxon-revenge sweet and
unctuous as butter-milk! -
*That Ireland will benefit by the change—that the country, which
has been blighted by the rule of the Saxon, will run with ºil and honey
under the beneficent auspices of the Gaul—is not to be doubted. Never-
theless, be assured that the corrupt and avaricious statesman who has
transacted the bargain-selling a whole nation for a bank-cheque-will,
in the proper place, namely, the House of Commons, at the bar of the
country, be duly impeached by “Your obedient servant, ->
“J. O'Connell, Esq., M.P.” “CH-s—LM A–ST-Y.
“P.S. It is a small matter, but I have just learned that, Louis-

THE DELECTABLE BALLAD OF THE FOUR KINGS OF
ITALY ;
SHOWING HOW THEY EACH TOOK HIS ROUGH DRAUGHT OF A CONSTITUTION, AND How IT sokE MISLIKED some OF THEM.
The Pope. “I FEEL ALL THE BETTER for My Dose, AND I Think You R
MAJESTIES CANNOT Do BETTER THAN Follow My ExAMPLE.”
King of Naples. “TAKE Away that NASTY compound.”
King of Sardinia. “As NAPLEs is TAKING it, I MAY As well.”
King of Denmark. “I suppose the RE is No Help for it, so HERE goes 1"
King of Prussia. “I Mixed MINe Myself, ANd so I KNow it's All Right.”
It was four kings into the South,
And oh, they were brave to see;
Three of them had a crown a-piece,
But the fourth, oh he had three.
The first he was King of SARDIN1A;
The next, Duke of Tuscanie;
The third, he was the Pope of Rome;
And Naples, the fourth was he.
SARD1N1A he nodded 'twixt wink and wake,
And Tuscany shut one eye;
But Naples he slept as fast as a church,
With his crown set all awry.
Then it's up and spake Pope Pius,
That was ware and wakeful too,
“Oh rouse ye, rouse ye, my cousins,
For there is work to do.
“I hear a bird that sings strangely,
And the burden of his song
Isaye ‘Up with the rule of Right,
And down with the rule of Wrong.'"
At Sandinia he lugged, and at Naples tugged,
With Tuscany struggled sore,
But the more he strove to rouse them,
The louder those kings did snore;
Till at last—were Popes not holy men—
I had said his Reverence swore.
Then it's up and spake a little foot-page,
That sat below the board,
“I hear the clash as of musquet-buts,
And the clank as of a sword."
And it's in came a Lord High Chamberlain,
And oh but he was pale:
“Now leave off your bowing and scraping, my lord,
And straight unfold your tale.
“Excuse this rude waking, Sir Kings,” he said,
“And say will ye fight or flee?
Here comes young SARDIN1A, young NAples,
In fact all young Italy.
“‘Come peace, come fight, he'll have his right;
To humbug him you're not to hope;
He'll take no chaff from Tuscany straw ;
He'll have no Naples soap;
“Sandinia may keep his oil
For pickling his own Sardines."—
So he says, and, please your Majesties,
What he says I think he means.”
Then a lusty knock came to the gate,
And a tirling at the pin;
And with bonnet on brow, and never a bow,
Young ITALY he walked in.
He louted him low before the Pope :
“A blessing, Lord Pope, I crave;"
And then he looked the three kings in the face,
And I trow the three kings were grave.
For they saw the red glow in his eye,
And the long sword at his side,
And they heard the tramp of his weary men,
As they entered the court so wide.
“”Tis an ugly dream,” quoth Naples,
When he saw his brethren quake;
And 'twas not till he pinched himself black and blue,
That he felt he was awake.
Young Italy took four cups of gold,
Ycarven quaint and fair;
“Now pledge me ye kings, ere hence I go,
In a draught though rough that's rare.
“The draught is mixed of precious things,
Long kept under bar and ban ;
Its strength is Right—that mighty wine
Makes glad the heart of man.
“Its bitter is Water from the well
Where Truth hides from man's blindness;
Its sweet is Mercy's honey-dew,
With milk of human kindness.
“Old Egypt's queen quaffed melted pearls,
Plucked from her diadem;
So have we melted in our draught
Justice—that priceless gem.
“And the draught I tend, as the health 'twill mend,
Is ‘a Constitution' hight;
They use it in merry England most,
And it makes them wise and wight.”
Quoth the Pope, “Your host will allow me a toast:
“Here's luck to the triple crown ''"
The cup was full that he took up;
'Twas empty that he set down.
Then Tuscany and SARDINIA
Drained their draughts with a gulp and a sigh.
“I like it much,” quoth Tuscany;
Quoth SARD1N1A “And so do I.”
But Naples 1 it was a sorry sight
To see him over his cup ;
Thrice he tried with a sob and a scunner,
And thrice he gave it up.
He tried it in spoonfuls and in sips,
And with holding of his nose;
As ye see a boy with the rhubarb toy,
Or with the sable dose.
Then Tuscany and SARDINtA.'
At their brother sore did scoff;
“I’ll count twenty," quoth young Iralv,
“And then, if it’s not drunk off !”
He scarce had reached eighteen, eighteen,
Eighteen and barely one,
When Naples he made a desperate plunge,
And lo, the trick was done !
He turned him over on his side,
Well nigh slipped off his throne;
“I’m gone, my friends ; the business ends;
Oh—-leave me—do—alone.”
“Now nay—now nay—thou silly king,
It will but do thee good.”
So said they all, till he was fain
To agree he thought it would.
Since then those kings are all alive,
Tho' Naples at times will snore ;
They admit that what Constitutions were
They never knew before.
And the Pope he leads a happy life,
And bids them bless the day
That young Italy did physic them,
Whether they would or nay.

defendant proposed to him (MR. Bull) to pull out his money,
A DANGEROUS LITTLE MAN. LORD JOHN TRYING IT on.
Lord John. “You see, My Dean MR. Bull, it's A MERE roºm; you accept this little Bill,
AND PAY it when it becomes due.”
PolicE INTELLIGENCE. “DROPPING A BILL.”
A LITTLE man named John Russell, was brought upyesterday before the Magistrate at Bow
Street, charged by MR. BULL with an attempt to inveigle him into the acceptance of a certain
bill, which would have rendered him liable to the payment of 1s. in the pound on the whole
annual amount of his income. MR. BULL, it appears, is already responsible for a similar bill
at 7d. in the pound, into accepting which, he said he had been swindled by the fraudulent
º of one PEEL, not in custody. -
R. Bull stated that he met the defendant (Russell) near Westminster Abbey; when
he was persuaded by him to accompany him to a public house in the neighbourhood, called
“The Commons.” Defendant and some parties supposed to be his confederates called for
returns, and for measures, which appeared to be half-and-half. Some general talk ensued,
when presently RussBLL said he had a sum to make up, and asked complainant what, he
would stand towards it? He (MR. Bull) said that times were very bad just now; but
he would see. They then had some conversation about the National Defences; after which
- Complainant accordingly
produced his purse, which contained some loose sovereigns, a bank note or two, and some
silver; and expressed his willingness to accommodate defendant with as much as he could
reasonably afford. Russell, said that would not do, and requested him to accept a little bill
which he placed before him, telling him that it was only a matter of form, and that he ha
nothing to do but to put his name to it, and pay it when it became due.
To the proposal complainant demurred; when Russelſ, made several artful representations
since proved delusive, to induce him to agree to it; and, finding these ineffectual, intimated
that he must procure his signature by main force. He (MR, Bull) then cried out lustily;
upon which prisoner called to his companions, who surrounded him, and endeavoured to
stop his º Had no doubt their intention was to “..burke” him. But at this juncture
a cry arose in the street, of “Police!”, mingled with cheers and shouts of “A Revo:
lution in France!” Qne of the prisoner's associates, then said, “It’s no go, John NY; ”
and another exclaimed, in an under tone, “There’s a pressure from without.”. Upon
this, Russeſ, becoming alarmed, let his Bill drop, which was instantly seized § complainant.
MR. BULL here handed the document to the Magistrate. Complainant added, that having
succeeded in getting out of the house, he applied to a policeman, who subsequently took the
prisoner into custody.
The Magistrate asked the prisoner what he had to say for himself?
Russell, with great effrontery, contended that his conduct, had been perfectly legal, and
said that he was in the service of an illustrious lady, who would be put to great inconvenience
by his detention. -
The Magistrate observed that after what had been proved against him, he had better take
care, or his mistress would certainly dismiss him from his situation. He would remand him,
and in the meantime direct the Police to keep a sharp look-out after his accomplices.
AN. UNREASONABLE REQUEST.
MR. B. CochRANE is reported to have moved for “certain diplomatic correspondence that
had passed on the subject of the affairs of Greece.” This demand is really one of the most
extravagant that could possibly be made; for who ever heard of “certain diplomatic corres-
pondence,” when the very essence of all such correspondence is its uncertainty.
THE LOST GAME.
At cards a sly and an old man played
With a nation across the sea,
And oaths were taken, and bets were made
As to whose the game should be.
They played so long, and they played so well,
It was difficult to scan
If the sly old man should the people “sell,”
Or the people the sly old man.
The people wºre “flush” of “clubs" and
‘spades,”
And played as if in despair;
And “diamonds” he had, in all their grades,
But never a “heart” was there.
The last “heat” came of the game Ising,
And the people played pèle-mêle;
But the old man lost, tho’ he played the “king,”
For he played the “knave” as well.
Patriotism at a Discount.
MARSHAL BUGEAUD has had the politeness to
offer his services to the Provisional Government
of France. The Government does not at present
—and we hope it never will—want anything in
the Marshal's line; but thanks him as much as
if it did. PRINCE Louis-Napoleon has had the
impudence" to make the same offer, proposing
to lend his assistance in restoring order; an
employment for which the hero of Boulogne must
be finely qualified. The French Government has
displayed a nice appreciation of his ability to
serve his country, in requesting him to oblige
it by-keeping out of the way.
OLD ENGLAND FOR EVER!
Though Monsieur DE LAMARTINE can sit
through a sitting of sixty hours, Citizen ANstEY
backs himself to make a speech against the
Frenchman, and to give him twenty-four hours
in. The money is posted at BELLAMy's, and
the umpires will be named when found.
Curious Coincidence.
It is singular that MR. HoRsMAN, who pro-
posed the amendment for the equitable adjustment
of the Income-Tax, should have been the Member
for Cockermouth. No mouth could have been so
competent to speak to Lord JoHN Russelſ, on
d that subject as the mouth of Cocker.
CITIZEN LOUIS-PHILIPPE IN PARIS.
. Such is the confidence of the French Repub-
licans in the durability of their form of Govern-
ment that, it is said, in a very little time they
will allow all the ORLEANs family to return to
Paris to enjoy the comforts of private citizenship.
Louis-PHILIPPE, we understand, proposes to set
up in business as a money-changer.
THE THREE GLORIOUS DAYS OF PRINCE LOUIS-

This is the second time that titles have been
abolished in France. The rule in LINDLEY

ative;” but, as the French are not particularly
fond of English rule, there is still hope left for
the French nobility.

PERPETUAL INVASION.
* HERE are old persons who allow themselves
to be carried away with an invasion from
abroad, and yet the same thing is continually
being done at home, and not a single hair
of their heads—or rather their wigs—stands
on end. Good-humour and a little common
sense, aided by a good strong fleet, will
easily keep the French away; but the diffi-
culty is, how are we to defend ourselves
against the invasion of Tax-gatherers, which
the Whigs invariably bring with them directly
they come into power?
We advise Englishmen, therefore, to turn
their backs for the present upon France.
§ The French have quite enough to do at
* present, without troubling themselves about
tº us. There is no fear of an invasion from
§ them. Our advice, therefore, is, to make
every defence against this army of Tax-
gatherers, which the Whigs are collecting to
invade us, and to raise every cry and barricade against the Income-tax, which peace, liberty,
fair-play, and the Beadle, will allow. Aſ has l’Income Tar. Wire Punch!
FIVE MINUTES ADVICE ON RAILWAY ROYALTY.
WE advise the Railway King to take warning by the fate of Louis-PHILIPPE. If he does not
make timely concessions, he may fall just as rapidly. Railway passengers are naturally good-
tempered. They will bear a great deal; but there is a terminus to all subjects’ patience. The
KING OF THE FRENCH fell by the weakness of his troops, particularly La Ligne. Can the King of
the Rails depend upon the strength of his line? The National Guard turned at Paris. May not
the guards on the Eastern Counties turn in the same way, and force MR. Hudson to abdicate *
A banquet was the first cause of the French Revolution. The frequent banquets of the Railway
King may cause a similar rising in his dominions. His subjects may not relish his breakfasting
when he pleases, or his stopping to dine or lunch at what hour or what place he likes, especially
when they may have not breakfasted or dined or lunched themselves, and are anxious to get to
their §. end to fulfil those pleasant duties. His numerous stoppages, too, at each trip,
ultimately put a stoppage to his own career.
A railway is a dangerous game, which, if kings were wise, they would not play with too recklessly,
for it may become a mighty engine of destruction, and fly in its sovereign's face. The throne of
the Tuilleries is now but a heap of cinders, at the bottom probably of the hotle of some chiffonier
of Paris. Let the autocrat of the Eastern Counties beware lest his own diadem ornament the
brow of some scavanger in the employ of MEssRs. Johnson AND PRICE | | | |
UN-ENGLISH CONDUCT AT MILAN.
“LETTERs from Vienna,” says the Morning
Post, “state that so great was the hatred at
Milan of anything German, that the people
rose and left the La Scala Theatre as soon as
FANNY ELLSLER made her first bound on the
stage, although she had hitherto been adored
there.” We sympathise with the Milanese in
their intolerance of foreign domination; but
cannot say we admire the manifestation of it
above recorded. The tyranny of Austria, one
would think, is a petticoat-government, and
FANNY ELLslER its representative, considering
the animosity which they displayed towards
her. After this demonstration against German
capers, we suppose they will next vent their
fury on German sausages. No pas executed
by FANNY ELLSLER has consisted in trampling
on the necks of the people of Milan; her
bounds have never exceeded those of their
Constitution; nor has she ever polked upon
their rights, or pirouetted over their liberties.
She has not enslaved the Milanese; and if,
like many other continental townsfolk, they
have harnessed themselves to the chariot of
the danseuse, it has been their voluntary act.
Let them express their patriotic indignation
like men—which they certainly have not done
by outpouring it in an insult to a lady.
THE PATENTEES OF GOVERNMENT.
WE are so profoundly convinced that no
Ministry can survive for a week unless it is
compounded of the Nobility, that we have the
most serious alarms for the duration of the
Provisional Government at Paris. Why, there
is not a single Lord amongst them | It is true
that the members are all men of genius, every
one of whom has distinguished himself, more
or less, by his talents—but what has that to do
with Government * No 1 Give us the Red
Book before all other books, be they histories,
or the best works on political economy, or the
cleverest book you like. What is a man like
LAMARTINE to a Marquis? How can a person
like Louis BLANC, much less the editor of a
newspaper, know as much about statesman-
ship as an Earl, or a Viscount, or even a
Right Honourable P. No ; the probability is
absurd. The race of statesmen are all born
with coronets. It is a breed of itself. The
branches of Government, to flourish, must be
covered with strawberry leaves. For a country
to be happy, to be free from debt, to be pros-
perous, the Ministers that guide it must be
selected on the golden rule of “NobiLITY BE-
For E ABILITY.”
The preference reads rather absurd, but
the thing has been proved so often in England
that the justice of it must be true: an
are we not particularly happy P—Look to the
Income-Tax. Are we not free from debt?—
Only refer to the National Debt, And are
we not prosperous P-But it is useless solving
these questions when we have a Whig
Ministry. The Genius of Statesmanship
abides only in Heralds' College.
ST. HELENA THE SECOND.
THE NAPOLEON OF PEACE has worked out
his resemblance to his namesake. He now
only wants a St. Helena, which we hope he
will find at Claremont, where, upon his two
millions in the British Funds, he will be ena-
bled to rough it quietly for the remainder of
his days.

Her paramour hath slain.

Hath seal’d her for the hangman's hands.
Yet, 'ere the irrevocable hour
Of death hath pass'd away,
Consider well, ye men of power,
Will ye that creature slay?
Can mercy find no reason why
The wretched being should not die?
Oh! cruel was the injury,
Envenom'd was the dart
Which wrung her soul to agony,
And rankled in her heart;
Betray’d, deserted, scorn'd, she had
Thus cause enough to drive her mad.
Yet more—the villain for whose sake
She turn'd her steps astray;
The hound—the miscreant—sought to make
A booty of his prey.
He bade her go and sin, that he
Might batten on her infamy.
She slew the caitiff where he stood,
She murder'd him, 'tis true;
We know she did a deed of blood,
And mought can change its hue.
She crush'd a reptile—still she trod
Upon the image of her GoD.
Insulted honour is no plea,
No privilege to kill:
Such is the law, so let it be—
Murder is murder still. -
Yet she may hold her blood-stain'd hand
Up with the noblest of the land.

THE POLITICAL BROTHERS.
THE Siamese Twins are about to send in their
adhesion, also, to the French Government. Their
motto, henceforth, is to be “Union, Force, Fra-
ternité.” Their Union promises, at all events, to
be binding; and no one can dispute that their
Fraternité is upon an equal footing, which is
more than can be said for that which has been
lately displayed at Rouen, and other places
where the English workmen have been expelled.
Let us hope, if Fraternité is to bind England |
and France together, that it will resemble that
of the Siamese Twins, and be equally strong on
both sides, and that they will march together,
leaning one upon the other, keeping the same
step and movement, and having but one impulse,
one soul between them, and then they may safely
defy the efforts of all the world to make them
fall out, or to separate them by any division,
without doing equal injury to both. This would
be something like a Fraternité?

THE ART OF MAKING YOURSELF UNPOPULAR.
THERE are a thousand different ways which a man, who has a genius
that way, may practise with success one after another; but at, present
we will only take the political way. This is easy enough, and may, iſ
perseyered in, win you the hurrahs of two or three unwashed adherents,
and the condemnation of every sensible person.
First of all, make yourself a busybody in your parish. Attend every
meeting. If there is no meeting going on, start one. If the meeting
is prohibited, keep away: never mind about the consequences. Of course
you are very sorry; but it was no fault of yours; you were not there.
Don’t be put down, however: start another meeting to-morrow. You
are bºto make yourself unpopular, and you cannot do better than
by constantly getting up meetings wherever they are likely to lead to
disturbances, and interrupt business.
If windows are broken, all the better for you. . People talk about
you, and blame you for it, and this materially heightens your un Qu.
larity. If you kaye no meeting of your own, interrupt somebody . S;
you are an Englishman, and have a right to be heard. Get on the
platform and propose counter-resolutions—or a vote of censure on the
Chairman is not bad. It creates a row, and stupid editors rave
about it the next morning. Persons exclaim, “There's that fellow
again;” and if you are very lucky, a song about you will be sung in
the streets. Threaten all sorts of prosecutions, ad never lose a chance
of writing a letter to the newspapers; it all tends to keep your name
alive, aed that is your great object. If you have nothing to do, go to the
Workhouse. Taste the soup. . Give the crossing-sweepers a lift; and
mind you abuse everybody, but particularly the rich. Attend the
Westry regularly. Doubt everything; deny everything; oppose every-
thing. You are sure to be right sometimes; and your conduct proves
annoying in any case. You don't attend to please people. Get half-a-
dozen men to follow you about, and cheer you. A shilling a-piece—six
. a day—will do it handsomely. They must make a deal of
noise for the money, however, and you must stop every now and then
and address them about the Income-Tax. Write your Memoirs, an
introduce º servants, char-women, and every one you
know. Do all this boldly, unblushingly, and perseveringly, and you
will not only succeed in achieving a moderate degree of unpopularity,
but the chances are, that you will become, in time, The Most Unpo-
pular Man of the Day.

a time on tiptoe. We always thought MADAME Fuoco was the most
celebrated for standing the longest on her toes, but she has not a leg

“You say in Chancery you are thrown;

The costs will fall on thee.’
Then did the simpleton reply,
“”Tis true the first vendee

“You’re in a mess, my little man,

THE TRUSTEE.
A TRUE STORY.
It is not often that the law is susceptible of romance; and indeed we
know of nothing in connection with legal pursuits, that, is particularly
come to our knowledge an incident, or rather a series of incidents,
replete with the tenderest pathos. The subject is that of a Trustee,
who had been persuaded to accept a trust under the persuasion that as
a mere trustee of property, the enjoyment of which he has nothing to
plicity with which he adheres to the impression of his being only a
trustee, while suits at Law and in Equity, with their consequent costs,
him, will remind the reader of the innocent
exclamation of “We are Seven!” so affectingly persisted in by the
little child in the famous poem of WoRDsworth.
A simple creature GAFFER JONES,
A Court he never saw ;
An income adequate he owns;
What should he know of Law P
He had a quiet º air,
And he was richly clad;
I thought if he’s got cash to spare,
'Tis easy to be had.
A suit I heard was 'gainst him brought,
Which must expensive be. -
“Expense!” he cried; “Pooh pool, 'tis mought;
I’m only a trustee.”
“But how is that? I pray you tell.”
He answered, “Don’t you see?
I’d got some property to sell-
Only as a trustee.
Another suit they brought;
Because, they said, I’d sold it for
Less money than I ought.
“First, the original vendee
Had filed a bill to say, |
His purchase-money paid would be,
Upon a certain day.
“But as it happen'd, I’d been paid
By number two, and
To him had the estate consign'd,
Passing the first one by;
“And as I did not better know
With whom I ought to side,
I’ve let the money from me go—
The fund I did divide.
“So the executors have brought
An action 'gainst me, too,
Yet I’ve proceeded as I thought
'Twere best for me to do.”
“How many suits must you defend,
In numbers odd or even?”
Said he, “To say I can't pretend :
I think, though, there are seven.
“But them, you know, you’ll understand
It matters not to me; |
For though no fund I’ve got in hand,
I still am a trustee.”
“The cash is gone, the suits run on,
Each day requires a feel.”
'Twas waste of argument, for still
He said, “I’ve not to pay a bill,
I’m only a trustee.”
A PLEASANT DAY'S WORK.
THE. Morning Chronicle says that “Honour undeserved, is twice
degrading—it degrades both those who offer, and him who, takes it.”
It would be a pleasant calculation, as pleasant as calculating the fly-spots
on a pastrycook's ceiling, to ascertain, with the above scale, the awſul
amount of degradation there must exist in England Look to, the
occupiers of rotten boroughs, Lords' nominees—what a large share
they would contribute! Turn your eyes towards the Government
appointments, the endless shoeblacks of Ministers, or the , acci-
dental possessors of a title—what an incalculable proportion of degra-
dation they would subscribe to the national stock! Count, up the
sinecures; add to them all the genteel paupers who are snugly domi-
cited for life on the Pension List; and pray don't forget the Six-
Clerks’ Office, and the immense mass of corrupt honours its death gave
birth to. Ascertain the sum total of all this, if you have the heart and
stomach to do it; multiply the result of degradation by two, and then sit
down to dinner with º: appetite }. may. We are beginning, as we
get more philosophic, to believe that appointments and all the great
points of life are won, according to our present game of society, infinitely
more by “tricks’ than “honours.” -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI -
THE NELson column ÉMEUTE
RECITATIVE.
O’ER NELson's Column, by a hoard concealed,
All London cried to have the base revealed;
Those dismal hoards have shut it in for years,
Washed by two ginger-beer-like fountains' tears.
AIR.
'Twas in Trafalgar Square,
We saw the blackguards there:
Each . was busy then.
Afrothy noodle spoke, . .
They turned his words to joke,
Both the boys and the men.
To'ards NELson’s Column rolled the wave,
Three cheers the little blackguards gave,
A roar devoid of beauty;
To Scotland Yard the signal ran,
For MAYNE expects that every man
This day will be on duty.
And now the urchins roar
More wildly than before:
Young SNoBKIN led the way.
His hand a stone has aimed,
And a policeman, maimed,
Is useless for the day.
That broken head was dearly bought,
For SNoBKIN from a truncheon caught
A crack that spoiled his beauty;
He roared, as from the scene he ram,
“I’m a poor boy, and that 'ere man
Has been and done his duty!”
The base of Nelson's shaft
A flight of stones received;
Good taste was on the side
Of those who push'd and shied,
And thundering brickbats heav'd.
The sticks and stones flew thick and fast;
The #ly hoarding fell at last:
'Twas void of use or beauty;
It tumbled with a crash and bang;
The Square with the confession rang—
“The scamps have done their duty l’”
A Financial Question. answered by Mr. Dumup.
A. HAs given a Bill to B., and A. finds himself without a shilling
when the Bill has only two days to run. Now what is A. to do under
such circumstances?
Answer. If the Bill
has two days to run, A. has of course two days to
run also,
and he had better run accordingly.
RAILWAY REPORTS.
Even Railways, have their reckonings, and this is the time of year
selected to compel them to disgorge their gains. Meetings are reluc-
tantly summoned by the Directors, and crowds of hungry shareholders
are squeezed together “by five hours at a time.”
The chairman pronounces a report, which is second only to a speech
from the throne in vagueness, generality, and mystification. Anon
comes the secretary, redolent of new shares, and he thickens the mist
by a jumble of accounts, a hotch-potch of loans, debentures, calls, an
balances, and generally winds up his abstruse financial puzzles by a
prophetic announcement that the traffic next year is sure to be unpre-
cedented and immense.
All this is Greek to the poor shareholders, who really understand but
one word in the whole Railway vocabulary—the welcome sound of
“dividend;’ but the fear of being thought a commercial nincompoop
compels each one to look perfectly up to snuff, and wondrous wise. . It
is amusing, moreover, to observe how the Directors manage (notwith-
standing the impertinent interruptions of some inconveniently acute
shareholder, whose sayings are recorded as those of “A voice”), some:
how or other so to mix up this word dividend with other complicated
details, as to leave the unhappy shareholders unable at the end to say
whether they have to receive money or to pay it.
How refreshing, then, to find that the reports of our own pet line
are untainted by the faults alluded to The public should know this;
*º a pattern to other Companies, we subjoin some extracts from
the last
“REPORT OF THE HUMAND DIDDLESEx RAILwAY.
“The Chairman would now refer to their finance statement. (Hear!)

been mortgaged on annuities at par, and their debentures were wholly
independent of their stock of engines (Cheers). The permanent way

From this it was clear that there was £4000 balance per contra on the
new half shares. (A voice, ‘What’s the receipts P’). The chairman
could not be expected to go into such details. They had lately opened
six miles of the ‘Navvey and Stoker Extension branch,” which he had
no doubt would pay well when a town had arisen at each end, and
traffic, was, induced between them. (A, voice, ‘What's the expendi-
ture?'), The Chairman begged not to be interrupted. The Meeting
would observe one little item of £56,000 for law expenses. They had
triumphed over their opponents. True, they had incurred some trifling
expense—but were they, he asked, to be insulted by the Grand Gump.

to the dividend—(Hear, hear, hear !)—the secretary had recommended a
nett dividend of 10 per cent. (Hear!) on the 3.
§§ the surplus º Directors’ salaries (which, he was glad to say,
ad been raised £500 each, per annum), left the 4 per cent, incidental
expenses, as money in hand, which would render it necessary for the
shareholders at once to pay up the late £20 calls. (Sensation. A voice,
‘What is the dividend to be?”) . The Chairman put it to the Meeting
whether the gentleman's question had not already been distinctly
answered, and after some confusion he vacated the chair, and the
meeting separated.”
Mitchell “at Home.”
FROM the advertisements we learn that shortly there is to be an
“AsyIUM For IDIOTs” erected. It would not make a bad publishing
office for the United Irishman. The whole editorial staff might, also,
be transferred, and be put under kind medical treatment, as long as they
madly º: in writing. Each number of the paper might have
stamped upon it: " Entered at the Asylum for Idiots,” as a voucher of
its correctness. We have no doubt that all the articles would be
perfectly up to the mark.
THE LAST MOMENTS OF A REPUBLICAN.
Such is the unanimity, amongst all bodies for the new form of
Government in France, that the BoEUF GRAs, previous to his last
ficit, and this, after
sigh at the abattoir, was heard most distinctly to murmur the repub-
lican tune of “Mourir pour la Patrie.” He departed into beef in the
most perfect peace.
Sympathy.
TWELVE thousand five-franc pieces have been struck at the Mint of
the French Republic. This was no sooner known, than every employé
connected with the late Government immediately sent in his adhesion.
We need not say that their patriotic devotion

--
The NEW contributoR.
DURING, the late rush of French news, several of our contemporaries
have been boasting of their “special engine.” Are we to understand b
this, that each newspaper has its own particular boiler? We shall look
anxiously for them the next visit we pay to the Dover Railway. Some
of these engines, however, get through a quantity of writing. The one
on the Morning Post ran last week through two columns of print, and
turned the corner of the third. M. DE LAMARTINE has said “The days
of fictions are over; ” but still we imagine that a few of these “special
engines,” are kept at home, where they are supplied with ink instead of
boiling water, and, once set going, make at least fifty “Revolutions”
an hour, and every one of them turn out to be a greater fiction than
ever was invented by ALEXANDRE DUMAs, or even that great “special
engine" of fiction, MR. G. P. R. JAMEs. We should not at all wonder
that the name of the Morning Post’s “special engine” was JENKINs.
“SATISFACTION” FROM SIR, ROBERT INGLIS.
It is not often that we have the pleasure of agreeing with SIR ROBERT
INGLIs. Most cordially, however, do we approve of his views on the
subject of duelling, as expressed the other evening, in reply to a certain
hint from MR. SHEIL. SIR Robert INGLIS is reported to have thus
spoken:–
“I trust I should have acted as a gentleman, and a Christian gentleman, ought to do.
The right honourable and learned gentleman knows very well—at least, I hope he does-
that while it is not my habit or wish ever to give offence, it would not be consistent with
my principles to give the satisfaction which he seems to indicate.”
We are sorry that our typographical resources will not allow us to
print the foregoing words in letters of gold. SIR Robert INGLls,
whatever he is, assuredly is—not by courtesy alone—an honourable
gentleman. As such—by his public repudiation of duelling—he has done
much to discourage that asinine and savage practice. For once, at least,
we can cry #. to what has fallen from the Member for Oxford.
rom whomsoever he may have withheld satisfaction, he has given great
satisfaction to Punch.
A Minister for the Interior.
WE emphatically advise Monsieur DE LAMARTINE, at the very first
vacancy, or even, signs of sinking amongst his corps, to call in the
services of the BoEUF GRAs, and without mincing, the matter, appoint
him to fill the Interior. His substance and weight in the country
could not fail to strengthen materially a Provision-al Committee in the
eyes of all France, and we are sure that thousands who now hold aloof,
would quickl rally round it, with such a member at the head of the
Republican Board.

The Great Window-Breaker.
WE wonder if MR. CochRANE has any particular friend or relation
who is a glazier? We ask this question, seeing the immense quantity
of broken glass in the neighbourhood of Trafalgar Square. He has a
curious motion, if he fancies he can get into Parliament through a
broken window. The immense pains he has taken to be a Member, have
been smashed all in one day. It would serve him right if he were
made to }}} for every sheet of glass that has been broken in conse-
quence of the late riots. Talk di the “Star of Brunswick 1" why, it’s
nothing to the “Great Star of CochRAN.E.” Swan & EDGAR's shop:

Monpay, the 6th of March, 1848, was ushered in much as usual, by
the striking of clocks, the cries of “Milk below.” the shouts of “Dust
O, dust !” and the shrill shrieks of " Hareskins, cook!” but nothing
seemed to betoken that a Revolution was at hand. An individual named
CochRANE, impressed with an ardent desire for equality, had conceived
the desperate idea of making º else in London as great a fool
as himself; and, strange to say, he succeeded to some extent in his
bold experiment. This person, who aspires to the title of the
Windmill_Street WASHINGTON, but to whom the , name of the
Cockney CINNA would be more appropriate, had called a meeting, of
his friends to petition against the Income-Tax. It is, ever thus that
a good cause is injured by the intrusion of Tom-Noddies, who, like
blue-bottles on a gilt frame, deface that to which they add neither use
nor ornament. -
It having been intimated to CochRANE that the contemplated meeting
was illegal, and that if he attended it the police would teach him to
know his proper place, by putting him in an appropriate Station, the
Champion of the People's Liberties made arrangements for preserving
his own, by stopping away from the gathering. The intended hero of
the day was §. to be concealed in one of the receptacles for
soup, he having run into his own kitchen to “beg a copper,” that he
might be out of the way during the period of danger.
Some hundreds of vagabonds and boys were on the spot at an early
hour, and though their burning enthusiasm did not allow them to con-
tinue, cool, they were certainly collected—but such a collection it
would be difficult to furnish an accurate description of. For a con-
siderable time there was little stir, except when an occasional juvenile
immersed his unaccustomed hands in the waters of the Trafalgar
Square basins.
At length, in the absence of MR. CochRANE, a person who was
understood to be a literary gent from Holywell Street, declared himself
ready to preside over the meeting. He was accordingly hoisted on to
the top of a balustrade, which he called the pinnacle of human great-
mess, and began to hold forth on the necessity for abolishing everything
and uniting mankind in one great elastic Indian-rubber band of universal

mob, in pursuance of this liberal maxim, commenced equalising the con-
tents of each others' pockets, and taking from their neighbours a purse,
a watch, or a handkerchief, as a token of fraternity. The Revolution
had now fairly started, and we §§ from an eye-witness of the occur-

While this incident occurs, the rebels seem to be seized with a desire
to select their colours, and for this purpose they adopt the silk hand-
kerchiefs, which they tear from the pocket nearest at hand, without
regard to price or pattern. They evince a determination to support
liberty, by a general making free, and they tear off the chains—watches
included—from their surrounding brethren.

- Tuesday, March 7th.
It is clear from the beginning of the day that the Revolution will
be continued, for all the rogues and vagabonds, boys and idlers from
the suburbs, have fraternised with the insurgents in London. The shops
at Charing Cross are closed, and a tobacconist having had his windows
roken and his snuff stolen the day before, deals out rappee with a
liberal hand and a thick staff on the heads of the Revolutionists.
Hitherto much uncertainty had prevailed as to the object of the émeute,
but the mystery, was now cleared up by an attack on the permanent
hoard established for some time past at the base of the Nelson Column.
This irritating piece of exclusiveness, at which the loyal, constitutional,
and rational Mr. Punch himself had often expressed his disapprobation,

the hoarding round th. |. of the Trafalgar Square monument. . Not

at the instant of its becoming the subject of obvious hostility. Even

The English Agitator.
ON Wednesday a public meeting of the “Early Closing Association’’
was advertised for eight o'clock. The meeting, however, was antici-
pated long before by a large mob of boys and blackguards, rushing
down Fleet-street and Cheapside, when almost every shopkeeper carried
out the object of the above Society by putting up his }. as early
as two o'clock. We imagine that Mr. Coch RANE may compliment
himself upon being the great promoter and Chairman of this new
“Early Closing ” movement. If he were allowed his way, business
would º close still earlier; for the chances are, that the shops
would have to shut up the yery moment, they opened. We wish some
humane philanthropist would start, an Association for the Early Shut-

CHEAP TAX-GATHERING: OR, WORK FOR THE
WEALTHY.
It appears from a recently published statement, that for the year
ending on the 5th of January, 1847, the amount deducted from the
gross receipts of the revenue, chiefly on account of the expense of
collecting it, was no less than £5,904,690 17s. 4d. . We knew that an
immense sum of money passes through the tax-gatherers’ hands; but
we had no idea that so much of it stuck to their fingers. An outlay,
hard upon six millions sterling, and much harder upon the millions
forming the population, is incurred in merely getting in the taxes."
Why, all this cash would set us up for ever in a standing army, which
might constantly keep of invaders at the point of the bayonet, and, if
necessary, levy the taxes—especially the Income-Tax—in the same
manner. At least some of the money ought to find its way into the
Exchequer.
. We are happy in being able to propose a plan for the cheaper collec-
tion of the revenue. It is but fair that those who have a stake in the
country should take the trouble of preserving it. A stake in the country
is property in the country; now, we suggest that all unemployed gentle-
men of property should be liable to serve as tax-gatherers gratuitously.
It is thus that an individual who has a stake in his parish is obliged to
act as churchwarden or overseer; and what is a parish but a nation in
little? If Aristocracy has its rights, it has also its duties; let the latter
be extended so as to include those of collector, tide-waiter, and excise-
man. Dignify these offices with becoming titles, as Lord High
Assessor, or Grand Gauger, with the addition of Right Honourable or
Most Noble. Let those who are to fill them have the option of
appointing deputies, just as the High Sheriff delegates his functions to
jºck Ketch." What is there so absurd in this proposition to employ
the idle, when men of business are summoned from their desks and
counters—not to mention their hearths, and homes—for the purpose of
officiating as jurymen?, It is at least fair that tax-eaters should do thus
much towards getting their own bread.
A Whipping Well-Merited.
The Times says, that during the late CochRANE riots, the coal-
whippers, mustering 2000 strong, sent a deputation to the Home
Secretary with an offer of their assistance in preserving the public
peace; . As the rioters consisted mainly of a set of ºf. boys, the
coalwhippers would have been just the persons to deal with them, by
performing that operation which they practise on coals—viz., whipping
—on the backs of these mischievous young vagabonds.

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR.
CHAPTER THE SEWENTH.
BRIEFLESS.
MR. BRIEFLESS TAKES PART OF A SET OF CHAMBERS.
fully motion-less at my first outset—I resolved (if I may be allowed a had
nautical simile) on nailing my wig to the mast, and scudding away under of t -
as much black stuff as my gown was composed of. I should observe, as the subject wou
by the way, that the purchase of a wig requires con:
siderable, judgment, for there are various qualities of
forensic horsehair, from the chump end of the tail of
the omnibus hack, to the silken mane of the thorough-
bred racer. The eye of the keen observer will soon
detect the difference if he goes into a Court of Law or
Equity, for he will be sure to see some of the º:
men of the bar wigged in a material exquisitely fine,
while others will wear on their heads stuff that you
might swear had been fresh plundered from the over:
driven animal on the adjacent cabistand. I disdained
the ropy coiffure, and selected the superior article,
having been assured by the artisan that the better sort
of wig would be worth an extra guinea as stuffing for
an º chair whenever I might be disposed to retire
from the profession.
My next care was to secure chambers, where I
might make known to an expectant world the interest-
ing fact of my advocacy being in the market, by having
my name inscribed, in letters of appropriate length,
on some door and door-post. , My friends had recom-
mended, and my purse—which never stood my friend
to any amount worth speaking of-echoed the advice,
that I should take chambers in conjunction with some
other barrister. I repaired to the hair-dresser's in the
Temple, and commenced the perusal of all those notices
which make his window ..
advertising columns of, a newspaper. , I read how
chambers were to be had in entire sets, demi-sets, and
demi-semi-sets, with undivided moieties of clerks, and
occasionally “the use of a cat,” or “half a laundress.”
I was soon tempted by a notification that a gentleman
who had “no use for the whole of his chambers,”—
or, indeed, for anything at all, as I subsequently found
out—“was willing to share the accommodation” with
any one who was disposed to pay for the right to
participate.
Having carefully copied the address, I hastened to
the advertiser's abode, and found, in it a gentleman
without a coat, and without a waistcoat; but by way
of making up for the deficiency, he wore a pair of very
massive spectacles. The room was redolent of tobacco;
but, supposing that my intended landlord might have
a great cigar case among the other cases in his
chambers, I took little note of the scent; and, recol:
lecting that “the rose by any other name would smell
as sweet,” I fancied that the reverse of the maxim
would hold good, and that the business might, be
. flourishing, though the chambers were in bad
Odour.
. I bargained for the occupation of a small cabinet,
intending to remain there till I had time to turn myself
round, though really there was scarcely space for such
a pirouette. ... I was informed that the use of the clerk's
room would be common to both myself and my in-
tended landlord. On looking at the room,” I foun
it to consist of a small cupboard, half blocked .# by
a kitchen dresser, which I presume was intended for
the clerk's desk; and a couple of hundred of coals
occupying the other half of the apartment, must have
formed the stool for the clerk to sit down upon.
As the º of this room, though mutual, was
to be '. eputy, I did not demur to the accommo-
dation, for I supposed my landlord knew more than, I
did of the arrangements necessary for keeping a clerk
which seemed to be about on a par with those required
for keeping a cat, or any other ãº. animal.
... We rapidly came to terms, and my name figured
in due time on the outer door and at the bottom
of the staircase... As my occupancy was destined to

during the three months of my professional blockade,
at the end of which period I was glad to escape from
my most uncomfortable tenancy.
A MEDICAL MAIDEN.
AN American contemporary states that a young lady
—a Miss BLAckwell—is now attending as a student
at one of the medical lecture-rooms at Boston. Her
age is 26–for she has the sense to tell it, as well as
to study medicine. . She sits down at the class, and
takes off her bonnet, thereby displaying considerable
personal attractions; and her presence has the remark:
able effect of producing decorum in an assembly of
medical students. We admire Miss BLACKWELL,
though we have never seen her; . She is qualifying
herself for that very important duty of a good wife—
tending a husband in sickness. She is acquiring what
to ladies would be very useful information—a knowledge
of the distinction between real and fanciful ailments:
also, of the consequences of want of exercise, damp
feet, and tight lacing. . As a mother, she will have
learned better than to dose her children with DAFFY
and DALBY, or to take her monthly nurse's advice
instead of the doctor's. America is certainly going
a-head of us in respect of the medical profession, for
in that country it contains at least one, young lady;
which is better than, as in England, including many old
Women.
LIVERY OF SEISIN.
WHEN it was understood, a fortnight or so back,
that Mons. Guizot had escaped from Paris in the
disguise of a servant, there was not a flunkey in livery
who arrived at any one of the English ports, who was
not waited upon by the landlord with peculiar respect,
and who did not receive most ºil reetings from
all the tradesmen of the ...i. We under-
stand that several footmen, taking advantage of the
mistake, availed themselves largely of loans placed at
their service by the noodles in the provinces; and
there is still an unprincipled scamp going about
Margate in, a magnificent suit of livery, borrowing
money in all directions as the Ex-Premier of France,
upon the strength of his velveteen smalls, and a tre:
mendous aiguilette made out of a bell-rope pulled
down from the coffee-room of the Sow and Sauce-
boat, from which he decamped, quitting the family in
whose service he was, for the prospect open to him in
assuming the character of GUIzoT.
CHACUN A son GoëT.
AN advertisement we have read in all the papers,
informs us of an invention, called “Dr. Radcliffe's medi-
cated pad for the gout.” We presume that the article
i. to, must be a medicated footpad—aphenomenon
with which we should like an interview.
The Great Unburdened.
GREAT complaints some time ago were made re-
specting the burdens on the landed interest; but we
have heard little about them lately. The less that is
said on this subject the better. hilst a tradesman's

THE MODEL M.P.
He lodges in Parliament Street, but has his letters
addressed to the Garrick, or Reform Club. He
enters the House invariably before prayers, and
only leaves it with the Speaker. He never misses
a Wednesday. He even attends on a Chisholm.
ANSTEY ji, or when the Danish claims are
brought forward. He is a very great man at the
hustings, making the most lavish threats to amend
the Constitution and stop the supplies; but
somehow, when he gets into the House he sinks
into one of those Hon. Members whose voice is
always inaudible in the gallery. He rises occa-
sionally, but sits down directly if any other
Member rises with him. He is not very ambi-
tious, seldom going beyond a “laugh.” His
favourite flight is to count out the House on a
Derby day. He has not a large conscience. He
votes unremittingly with Ministers, and has his
reward in a gracious bow from LoRD JoHN, and
occasionally an invitation to dinner, when he is
quite proud to see his name in print, and dis-
- patches innumerable copies of the paper to his
constituents.
IIe has a profound veneration for the British Lion, and loves to
display his classical knowledge by applauding every little bit of Latin
and Greek. Ile is deeply skilled in the Parliamentary gamut, which
he can run up and down with the zoological flexibility of a Von Joel,
from a crow in C major to a donkey in Dalt. He is an easy victim for a
Committee, and takes a pride in attending the deputations of the
Commons before the Lords. He is a stern upholder of the etiquette
of the House, and is fond of summoning innocent printers before the
bar, or of incarcerating Irish Members in coal-holes, for contempt.
He czecutes the little errands of his party, and on an emergency acts
as whipper-in. He sups regularly at BELLAMY's, where his profound
knowledge of chops and steaks is highly respected, and his calls for
“lemon peel” instantly attended to. The clerks and door-keepers look
up to him as a clock, and put on their great-coats and comforters
immediately they see him come out.
In private life, the model M.P. attends public meetings, and seconds
all sorts of charitable resolutions for the Blacks, and philanthropic expe-
ditions up the Niger. He has been known even to take the chair at a
benevolent dinner, when the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE has been absent b
indisposition. He subscribes liberally to hospitals, to all charities, i.
and real, to eyery new testimonial, and is too happy to forward any
absurd plan with the full strength of his two initials. He reads every
newspaper, and dies in the possession of his seat, very obscure, but
universally regretted by the party who has had his vote for the last
fifty years.
PUNCH'S MAXIMS MORALISED.
IX. —A quiet tongue shows a wise head.
This is sheer nonsense. We might as well say an ineffective clapper
shows a good bell, or the absence of a bellows shows an excellent organ.
A quiet tongue only shows a wise head when the tongue has only folly
to utter; but if the proverb were a true one, the gentleman who found
it impossible to address the monosyllable “Bo” to the celebrated goose,
must have been the SoLON of his era.
Y.—As the old cock crows the young cock learns.
We hope this may prove true in the case of the Gallic Cock, for the
old one has been crowing a great deal lately, and the young one has
much to learn for its future benefit.
XI.-A free is known by its fruit.
This can scarcely apply to the boot-tree, which has no fruit at all,
cxcept perhaps a-corn.
XII.-A willing mind makes a light foot.
If a willing mind makes a person light-footed, we should be glad to
know what would make him light-fingered
XIII-Business is the salt of life.
Very true; and too much of the salt brings on the thirst for gain, in
a very dangerous excess. The author of the proverb might have added,
that failure is the vinegar, difficulties are the pepper, and looking for
money to meet a bill the mustard.
XIV.--Care killed a cat.
It must have been a very feelin(e) animal.
XP.-Confession of a fault makes half amends for it.
If we admit this to be true, confessing a fault twice over would repair
it altogether. The same principle might be applied to a debt, and it
would then appear that two cognovits would settle one liability.
MPI-Conscience is the Chamber of Justice.
Justice, however, like many other folks, is very apt, to write on the
door of its chambers, “Gone out—Return in an hour.”
XPII.—Cut your coat according to your cloth.
Very good advice, no doubt; but if you have no cloth, you must cut
your coat altogether.
A REAL SUBSTITUTE FOR THE INCOME-TAX.
To find an efficient substitute for the Income-Tax, Ministers are at
their wits' end; which, perhaps, is the reason why the debate on the
Budget has been so dull. We have resolved ourselves into a Committee
on the Government's Ways and Means, and we think we can greatly
improve the former, and add considerably to the latter. We believe
we can point out an honest mode of maintaining the natiºnal revenue-
and consequently a plan for dispensing with the Income Tax.
Our project is altogether one of indirect taxation, . In the first place,
we propose a tax upon opera boxes, the rent of which varies from £200
to º per annum. Those who can afford to pay all this money for-so
to speak—a mere song, must be rolling in an ocean of such boundless
wealth, that they would hardly be able to feel the most copious abstrac-
tion from it. - - -
In the next place, we would establish turnpikes at either extremity-
the Tyburn and Piccadilly—of the Ring in IIyde Park, leaving merely
--
º
-
the line of communication between the two thoroughfares free. Also
a turnpike at each end of Rotten Row. We would fix the tolls at
aristocratic rates, as half-a-guinea for a brougham or other one-wheeled
carriage, and for other carriages five shillings additional on every wheel;
a crown, also, for each horse, mule, or ass—for we rather think donkeys
are not excluded from the Park.
On all sums of money won by betting on horse-races, we would
impose a tax of fifty per cent. ; since money that lightly comes lightly
goes, and . as well go into the Exchequer as anywhere else. We
would have all members of the turf served with a schedule, on which
they shall be required to state the amount of their winnings, on that
"..." which has ever been so bright a characteristic of the Stable
li101.
We dare say that many other schemes for raising the public wind
will occur to us; and as fast as they do, we shall publish them for the
enlightenment of Downing Street. Like the foregoing, they will all be
based on the principle of taxing luxury, extravagance, ostentation, and
idleness, instead of poverty, frugality, providence, and industry. These
and the foregoing devices, however, we intend merely as substitutes
for the present Income-Tax, and not for one founded on simple arith-
metic and common justice.
Illustrations of Low Art.
“PICTUREs,” it has been said, “are the books of the ignorant.” Our
pictorial contemporaries, by their illustrations of the late revolutionary
scenes at Paris, have given the ignorant some very pretty lessons, the
influence of which has been abundantly manifest in the recent pro-
ceedings of the metropolitan rabble.
REASONS FOR RETIREMENT.
MANY reasons are assigned for the obstinate refusal of the CoMTE DE
NEUilly to appear in public. The probability is, that Louis-Philippe
keeps close until his whiskers are grown.

TRAVELS IN LONDON.
A ROUNDABOUT RIDE.
oUNG HENGIST havin
kindly offered to len
me a pony, I went out
for a ride with him this
morning; and, bein
now mercifully restore
to my arm-chair at
home, I write down
with a rapid and faithful
H. the events of the
aW.
HENGIST lives in the
Tyburn district, that
great rival, and some-
time, as 'twas thought,
conqueror of Belgravia,
where squares, cathe-
drals, terraces, spring
up in a night, as it
2– were : where, as you
sº wandered yesterday,
you saw a green strip
of meadow," with a
- washerwoman's cottage
and a #. arden; and, fo-day you look up, and lo! you see a portly
row of whitey-brown bow-windowed houses, with plate-glass windows,
j. the clear panes of which you may see bald-headed, com:
fortable old fogies reading the Morning Herald. Butlers loll at the
doors—[by the way, the Tyburnian footmen are by no means so large or
so powdery as the Mayfair and Belgravian gentry)—the road is always
freshly laid down with sharp large flintstones. Missis's neat little
brougham with two bay horses, and the page by the coachman's side,
is creaking over the flints. The apothecary is driving here and there
in a gig.: the broad flag-stones are dotted about with a good number of
tartan jackets and hats, inclosing, wholesome-looking little children.
A bran-new fishmonger’s shop is just open, with great large white-
bellied turbots, looking very cool and helpless on the marble slabs. A
genteel stucco-faced public-house is run up for the accommodation of
the grooms, and the domestics, and the hodmen of the neighbourhood;
and a great bar is placed at the end of the street, beyond which is a
chaos of bricks, wheelbarrows, mounds of chalk with milky-lookin
pools beside them, scaffoldings and brown skeletons of houses, throug
which the daylight shines, and you can see patches of green land
beyond, which are to be swallowed up presently by the great devour-
in London are given hereabouts; dinners where you meet a
ing City.
This quarter, my dear friends, is what Baker Street was in the days of
our youth. I make no doubt that some of the best and ºdinners
aronet,
a Knight, and a snuffy little old General; and where the master of the
|
house, the big bald man, leads LADY BARBARA MACRAw down stairs,
the EARL of STRATHBUNGO's daughter, and godmother to his seventh
child. A little more furniture would make the rooms look more com-
fortable; but they are very handsome as it is. The silver dish-covers
are splendaceous. I wish the butler would put a little more wine into
the glasses, and come round rather oftener. You are the only poor man
in the room. Those awful grave fellows give each other dinners round.
Their daughters come solemnly in the evening. The young fellow of
the house has been at Oxford, and smokes cigars, but not in the house,
and dines a good deal out at his club.
I don’t wonder: I once dined with young HENGIST at his father's,
MAJOR GENERAL SIR HERCULES HENGIST, K.C.B., and of all the
but hospitality forbids me to reveal the secrets of the mahogany.
Having partaken there of a slight refreshment of a sponge-cake from a
former desert (and a more pretentious, stuck up, tasteless, seedy cake,
than a sponge-cake, I don’t !. and a glass of wine, we mounted our
horses and rode out on a great exploring journey... We had heard of
Bethnal Green and Spitalfields; we ...] to see those regions; and
we rode forth then like two cavaliers out of MR. JAMEs's novels—the
one was young, with curly chestnut ringlets, and a blonde moustache
just shading his upper lip, &c.—We rode forth out of Tyburnia and
down the long row of terraces to which two Universities have given
their names. -
At the end of Oxford Terrace, the Edgware Road cuts rapidly in, and
the genteel district is over. It expires at that barrier of twopenny
omnibuses: we are nearly cut in two by one of those digin;
vehicles, as we pass rapidly through the odious cordom. -
We now behold a dreary district of mud, and houses on either side,
that have a decayed and slatternly look, as if they had become insolvent,
and subsequently taken to drinking and evil courses in their old age.
WOL, xIV. N
There is a corner house not very far from the commencement of the
New Road, which is such a picture of broken-windowed bankruptcy as
is only to be seen when a house is in Chancery or in Ireland. #".
the very ghosts must be mildewed that haunt that most desolate spot.
As they rode on, the two cavaliers peeped over the board of the tea-
garden at the Yorkshire Jingo. The pillars of the damp arbours and
the legs of the tables were reflected in the mud.
In sooth,’tis a dismal quarter. What are those whitey-brown small
houses with black gardens fronting, and cards of lodgings wafered into
the ricketty bow-windows P. Would not the very idea that you have to
pass over that damp and reeking strip of ground prevent any man from
taking those hopeless apartments Look at the shabby children
paddling through the slush : and lo! the red-haired maid-of-all-work,
coming out with yesterday's paper and her mistress's beer jug in her
hand, through the creaking little garden door, on which the name of
“SULSH" is written on a dirty brass plate.
Who is SULSH? Wi. do I want to know that he lives there? Ha!
there is the Lying-in Hospital, which always looks so comfortable that
we feel as if we should like to be in an interesting—fiddlestick | Here
is Milksop Terrace. . It looks like a dowager. It has seen better days,
but it holds its head up still, and has nothing to do with Mary-le-bone
workhouse, opposite, that looks as cheerful as a cheese-paring.
We rise in respectability: we come upon tall brown houses, and can
look up long vistas of brick. Off with your hat. That is BAKER
STREET; jolly little Upper Baker Street stretches away Regent's Park-
ward; we pass by Glum Street, Great Gaunt Street, Upper Hatchment
Street; Tressel Place, and Pail Street, dark, tragic, and respectable
abodes of worthy people. Their names should be printed in a black
book instead of a red book, however. I think they must have been
built by an architect and undertaker. -
How the omnibuses cut through the mud City-wards, and the rapid
cabs with canvass-backed trunks on the top, rush towards the Great
Western Railway. Yonder it lies, beyond the odious line of two-
penny 'busses.
See, we are at Park Crescent. Portland Place is like a Pyramid, and
has resisted time. It still looks as if Aldermen lived there, and very
beneficed clergymen came to them to dine. The footmen are generally
fat in Portland Place, I have remarked; fat and in red plush breeches
—different from the Belgravian gents: from the Tyburnian. Every
quarter has its own expression of plush, as flowers bloom differently in
different climates.
Chariots with lozenges on the º and elderly ladies inside, are
driving through the iron gates to take the cheerful round of Regent's
Park. When all Nature smiles and the skies are intolerably bright and
blue, the Regency, Park seems to me to have this advantage, that a
cooling and agreeable mist always lies over it, and keeps off the glare.
Do people still continue to go to the Diorama? It is an entertain-
ment congenial to the respectability of the neighbourhood. ... I know
nothing more charming than to sit in a black room there, silent and
frightened, and with a dim sense that you are turning round; and then
to see the view of the Church of Saint Rawhead º moonlight, while a
distant barrel-organ plays the dead march in Saul almost inaudibly.
Yoicks! We have passed the long defile of Albany Street; we cross
the road of Tottenham—on either side of us the cheerful factories with
ready-made tombstones and funereal urns; or great zinc slipper-baths
and chimney-pots that look like the helmets of the Castle of Otranto.
Extremely small cigar-shops, and dentists; one or two bug-destroyers,
and coffee-shops that look by no means inviting, are remarked by self
and HENGIST as our rapid steeds gallop swiftly onwards-onwards
through the Square of Euston—onwards where the towers of Pancridge
rise before us—rapidly, rapidly. -
Ha! he is down—is he hurt?—He is up again—it is a cab-horse on
a-head, not one of ours. It is the wood-pavement. Let us turn aside
and avoid the dangerous path. . SPEC.

almost look as if they had been pointed purposely at recent events:-

quite reckless of all rules, there will be no telling what will be the en

to make small and reasonable sacrifices, for the sake of obtaining
security. The alarming increase of political incendiarism prevailing
among the neighbouring States is no doubt occasioned by want of suffi.
cient care on the part of those having an interest in the preservation of
things, as they were; and it is believed that, by a system based on fair
and liberal principles, Crown property may be Insured against risks as
perfectly as property of any other description. It is proposed, there-
fore, to open an Office for the Insurange of Thrones;... and the sum
to be paid by way, of premium will be in a fair proportion to the risk
incurred; for, while some monarchies may be looked upon as secure,
there are many that, must inevitably be º: as doubly and even
trebly hazardous. The British Monarchy, for instance, which rests on
the security of the
MILLION,
whose interest, it is to be hoped, will always be conscientiously pro-
vided for, can be Insured upon very easy terms, provided none of
the parties concerned do anything in violation of the equitable and
liberal policy. A table of premiums will be shortly prepared, with a
view to the various classes of risk that are in existence at the present
time, from those constitutional sovereignties that may be Insured for
the whole term, down to those absolute despotisms which the Company
will not undertake to Insure for more than a single year, and at a very
high premium.
The fearful consequences of non-Insurance are shown in the case of
LOUIS-PHILIPPE, who, having omitted to avail himself of the liberal

policy that would have insured the French Throne during his own life
at least, has not only been brought to ruin himself, but has set on fire
the habitations of several of his neighbours. To prevent, the spread of
these destructive flames, nothing will be found effectual but the cele.
brated moral engines, of which there is a powerful brigade always ready
in this country, under the personal superintendence of Mr. Punch, who
may be familiarly called the BRAIDwood of the force alluded to.
LA SUITE D'UNE REVOLUTION.
WHATEveR may be the most remote, consequences of the French
Revolution, we have one of its immediate effects set forth in the
following advertisement:—
M THALBERG, in consequence of the recent event on the Continent,
• purposes RESIDING in LONDON this season. Address Cramer, Beale, and Co.,
201, Regent-street.
The convulsion that has shaken all Europe, and sent Princes #.
in every direction, has had its influence on the pianoforte-player, whose
name figures in the announcement we have quoted. The downfall of
royalty in France, has driven Louis-PHILIPPE from a French throne,
and consolidated THALBERG-for the season—on a British music-stool.
The THALBERG emigration will, of course, be looked upon, as a
momentous incident of the Revolution, and the French nation will wait
anxiously for his restoration to the cabinet, the piccolo, or the semi-
grand. The great questions, What will Austria do? How will Russia
act? and In what direction will Prussia proceed have all been extin-
guished at once, by the overwhelming interrogatory of “What will be
the course taken by THALBERG, in consequence of the recent eyents?”
He clearly estimates his notes at a thumping value, and as far more
important than any diplomatic notes that may be passing between
foreign powers and the Provisional Government. Thalberg answers
the inquiry in advance—before it is made—and, without pledging him.
self to any political opinion on the “recent event,” he intimates that he
shall reside in London “this season.” How much does this simple
notification imply ', THALBERG, like THIERs, will not commit himself
either one way or the other, but is biding his time.

THE SNOB OF NEW HAVEN.
GRAND NATIONAL FANCY FAIR.
SINCE our deficient revenue proves that we are nationally hard up,
why not, we ask in the face of our country, resort, for the relief of our
general distress, to the expedient of a National Fancy Fair?
Let the Fair be held in Hyde Park. Let the articles of merchandise
consist of home produce,—of things which foreigners are unable to
obtain in their own countries; so that our profits may be derived from
the pockets of our neighbours—not however against their will. Let the
Fair take place under the patronage of our most gracious Sovereign
who shall depute the Mistress of the Robes to preside at the Roy
Stall. As wares to be disposed of at the booth of MAJESTY, we may
suggest a stock of models of the British Constitution, which just now
would find a ready sale in Lombardy and the Italian States.
The First Lady of the Admiralty will perhaps oblige her country by
taking charge of a stall for marine stores, and other appurtenances
employed by BRITANNIA for the purpose of ruling the waves.
Some noble Duchess—assisted # a gentleman at Paddington—will,
peradventure, undertake the sale of the British bull-dog. No doubt,
many a lady of corresponding rank will be only too happy to adorn a
horse bazaar, and grace with her patronage a mart for the English racer.
The LADY MAYoFEss, probably, will not object to superintend a
refreshment-stall; the viands to include, of course, the well-known
civic. luxury of turtle, but their grand feature to be that exclusively
English delicacy, plum-pudding.
Lastly, our own Lady Judy will join the rest of the aristocracy in
; the benefit of her influence and personal attractions to an office
or the sale of this our º: periodical; the proceeds of which alone,
we are amply satisfied, will be sufficient to extricate us out of all our
difficulties, and leave a handsome residue towards the payment of the
National Debt.
A Strange Spell.
The French Academy will have to revise, their famous Dictionary,
for since February there has been a terrible revolution amongst its
words. For, instance, could one of the forty Immortels have ever
imagined (unless, he had been favoured with a particular spell) that
République would begin with an E mute (€meute)?
War and Letters.
. The speech of MR. Cobden on the Income-Tax convinces, us that,
in a very little time, Letters, will be too strong for War, binding glory
over to keep the peace. And these Letters are, in this case, certainly
Belles Lettres, though only three in number. Nevertheless, they are the
strongest in the alphabet, binding all men. Here are the final masters
of the Horse Guards and the Admiralty:—£. s. d.
WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IRELAND F
Of all questions this is the most difficult to answer. We have sent
it to the Editor of Bell's #. and every sporting paper, but have
received no satisfactory reply.
Several plans have been proposed.
Some have recommended the Cold Water Cure ; others, an Earth-
quake; and one or two bold persons have hinted at its being presented
a free gift (if such a donation can be called a gift) to Joinville, or
Louis-PHILIPPE, or its being sold for what it would fetch, to the
EMPEROR of Russia. None of these plans, however, have been tried,
or at all events have succeeded. The place is as incurable as ever.
O! that a second St. PATRICK would rise and drive all the vermin out
of the country! Ireland is not only England's difficulty, but also her
own. Her serpents and snakes in the grass make it impossible for
any one who is not fond of continual hissing and stinging, to live in
such a place.
Now we propose, for the benefit of Ireland, that a plan of emigra-
tion be Nº on the most extensive scale. If some of the inhabitants
could only be removed, we are sure the country would flourish. Con-
ciliation Hall might be shipped to Botany Bay, and Young Ireland be
exported in a body to the }. de Ville. Premiums should be offered
to every Agitator, corresponding with the amount of mischief he is
likely to do, to induce the race of MEAgiers and Mitchelis to prove
their real love to Ireland by leaving it.
We hope Government will appreciate our hint by *. starting a
General Irish Emigration Society. Ireland looks upon England as her
natural enemy. We beg to say she is no one's enemy but her own.
º sooner that enmity is buried, the better for her, and the pleasanter
or us.
OLD HEADS ON NEW SIIC) ULDERS.
The late Revolution in France has not only turned
the heads of the Parisian populace, but it has
turned the heads of some eminent men at home in
a very extraordinary manner. LoRD BROUGHAM's
head is turned into that of M. ARAGo; LoRD
GIRARDIN : the Duke of WELLINGTON, with
his mose slightly abridged, is published as MAR-
PRINCE LEopold are coming up as NEMOURSEs,
MonTPENSIERs, and others, in large abundance:
The fact is, that the enterprising proprietors of
some of our illustrated papers have got a large
collection of good intellectual-looking heads of
English growth; and, as there is not much use
for these heads at home at the present moment,
they are brought out from the box of woodcuts,
and placed upon the shoulders of those French politicians whose names
are just now in the mouth of every one.

MARSIIAL EUGEAUD.
In some few cases an attempt has been made to give an air of novelty
to an old portrait, in fitting it to the new subject, but in other instances
there is no attempt at disguise; and we have actually seen an ancient
woodcut of HoRACE VERNET figuring as M. DE LAMARTINE, without
even the shaving off of the moustachios, an operation which, strangely
enough, would have prevented the imposition from being quite so bare-
faced as it is at present.

FALLACIES OF THE FACULTY.
A work with this title has passed º
many editions; but we think another ºf t
still be brought out, containing some
tional Fallacies, to which the
Faculty are liable. One of the
greatest Fallacies on the part of
the Faculty that has come under
our observation, is the illumi-
# nated bottle or night-lamp,
which throws a streak of green,
blue, red, or yellow, along an
entire street, and is fallaciously
supposed by the Faculty to
create that change of complexion in a passerby, that would ||
urge him to rush in for medical advice to the doctor at
whose door the transparency is exhibited. -i-
Another enormous Fallacy of the Faculty is the old su-
perstition of dressing up a charity boy in a page's livery,
and imagining that the public can be misled by such a ſºl
shallow expedient. Another Fallacy of the Faculty consists &
in the delusion that a knocker of extraordinary dimensions, &
and a capacious brass plate, are a connection of themselves,
- or that a knocker violently agitated
will impress the surrounding neigh-
bourhood with an idea of the great
ability and large connection of the
practitioner.
We know a certain pure—a
i. SIMON PURE—who pays a
halfpenny for every run-away knock
|
º contributed to his door, and, as he
| supposes, to his reputation, by a
local young scamp who sends in
s account once a week for this
mischievous disturbance of the
peace of the neighbourhood.
The last, and perhaps the worst
Fallacy of the Faculty, is that which
is founded on the belief that the
poºr, are not up...to the dodge of |
... “Advice Gratis,” which generally
recommends the purchase of a pill and a draught from the benevolent
practitioner.
THE KENNINGTON COMMON REVOLUTION.
EveRY one recollects the memorable Monday after the Battle of
Trafalgar Square, when the Cochranites were to make another demon-
stration at Kennington Common, and have indulged in their love of
(small) change, by picking pockets of loose silver, or anything else they
could lay their hands upon. Thanks to the determination of the
special constables, who had shown their intention to stand no non-
sense, order reigned throughout the metropolis; and the elements
indulged in a short rain, but a merry one, for the purpose of cooling
own superfluous ardour, and removing superfluous dirt among the
ranks of the would-be revolutionists. The whole affair cannot better be
described, than by a paraphrase of “ALEXANDER's Feast;" and, who so
well suited as an imitator of DRYDEN, to chronicle the achievements of
the iº who were rendered wet-uns (pardon us) on the day to which
We allude :-
'Twas on the Common of famed Kennington,
REYNoLDs (old REYNoLDs' son),
Aloft in mimic state,
Upon a waggon sate—
The driving-box his throne.
The idle riff-raff stood around,
Some of their brows—for recent fractures—bound
(So theft, and mischief should be crowned).
The Chartist, WILLIAMs, by his side,
With envy his position eyed,
As if for chairmanship he sighed.
Precious, precious pair!
None but the brave,
None but the brave
Deserve the chair!
Young REYNoLDs, placed on high,
Produces half a quire - -
Of correspondence, which, without desire,
He reads, in notes that reach the sky,
And shouts of “Hear!” inspire.
Note one—bid SIR GEORGE GREY,
Before a certain day,
Leave Ministerial sway, , , -
And send the reins of power, straight from his hand,
To MisTER REYNoLDs, somewhere in the Strand;
When he, of the said reins possessed,
Would guide the State himself, in º the very best.
The listening crowd admire the lofty sound;
“A plucky chap this here!” they shout around,
And dabs of mud against the van rebound.
With lengthened ears
Young REYNoLDS hears,
And thinks, with joy,
“Yes, I’m the boy
That means to shake the spheres!”
Praise of the French he next in glowing accents sung–
French Freedom—very fair, but very young.
But a poor baker's cart there comes;
With their fingers and their thumbs,
The mob, to their disgrace,
(Blush, every honest face!)
Would fain have stole the bread—the crusts, the crumbs'
Freedom, very, very young,
Surely never did ordain
Making bakers' carts a treasure,
Robbing their contents at pleasure—
Pleasure to the owners’ pain.
In sheer disgust, the very rain, .
Resolved such conduct to restrain, -
Came down as if to say—“You shan’t do that again.”
Young REYNoLDs saw the vast supplies
Qf rain pour down before his eyes.
While he the Government defied,
Away he saw the Meeting glide.
Le chose a wilder strain
To bring them back again.
He spoke of France, so great and good;
Of Louis-PHILIPPE's fate,
Fall’n, fall'n, fall'm, fall'n;
From his high estate,
And flying with his brood.
Ileserted at his utmost need
By those who on corruption feed,
From his own realm in fear he flies,
To England turns his anxious eyes.
Still, in the rain, young REYNoLps boldly sate,
Until there linger'd scarce a soul;
The wet had clear'd the ground below,
d down the van, he gently stole
Thinking—he'd better go.
RAIN OF TERROR.
TAKE CARE OF YOUR POCKETS.
A CoNGREss of all the German sovereigns is, it is said, about to be
held at Dresden.

LORD NELSON TO PUNCH.
UNCH has received, by the hands of the late boy
.) (he is now a grey-headed old man, bent double
| and sand-blind), who worked at the Nelson
Column, the following letter, written by the
immortal Admiral. We believe the document
to be genuine. The character of the bearer is,
in the first place, above all suspicion; and the
left-hand character of the writing speaks, or
rather, scratches for itself.
“Mast-Head, Nelson Column, March 15.
“PUNCH -
“Śhives my bronze, if I stand this
any longer. My precious eyes! I was only
once more flesh and blood, I’d be down upon
deck, hand over hand,-and that they knºw;
so they’ve stiffened me up here in -metal.
Well, what next? For years and years have they perched me aloft
here, asking public and private charity, and seldom getting it. In the
first place, when am I to be finished?
“My precious eyes!'. Why didn't they put a bull-dog at the base of
the Column with a hat in his mouth, and a board slung at his neck with
—‘Pray, pity the Admiral!’ - -
“It was bad enough when a Russian threw money at me, for what f
call my base relief.
“But that’s not what I’m going to write of now, No, Punch : it’s
about this MR. CochRANE (no relation somever, I hope, to the gallant
chap of Basque Roads), who’s had his Trafalgar fight, when Field #.
expected every pickpocket to do his duty. And many on 'em-blind as
I am I could see that—did it. -
“MR. CochRANE, it seemed, skulked among the pumps, or in the
bread-room, or in the aſter-hold, or somewhere ºil; the
policemen's staffs were flying at the masſ-heads of the mob; I call
this—no; I won't say what. But this, I will say,+I do advise the
chaps to call CochRANE to a court-martial for cowardice; and if he’s
found guilty, to give him a round dozen of months or so in the Fleet.
[The Admiral is ignorant % its demolition ; but, no doubt, will be equally
satisfied with the Queen's Bench.] -
“They’ve been having, it seems, a rumpus in France; Well, I
shan’t talk of Frenchmen now; folks º they’re a good deal better
than in my time—I won't say they arn’t; but I will say, there was a good
deal of room for 'em. But what does make my bronze blood boil is
this, to think that Englishmen should demean themselves, and take a
pattern of a row from France. Can't they–if they must fight-can't they
t up a row out of their own head! I’m ashamed of my countrymen,
º: they even have rebellion, like caps and bonnets, from France? Can't
they, if #. will ºn right earnest fashion themselves?
“They’ve been throwing up, I hear, what they call Barricades—a
sort of battery made easy—in Paris. . This, I do confess it, gives, me
some hope. I felt a sort of horrid pleasure when the mob scrambled
about me; for I thought, to a certainty, they’d heave, me up, and flin
me across the square, flattening my mast-head and hull like a school.

hadn't devil in 'em enough to do it. To be sure, men don't get courage

chief or a three-decker. -
“Well, there Istood, and saw a good deal of the fun, and only wished
I could have got down among 'em. I didn't mind the row much, but—
as a loyaltar—I did feel for his Most Gracious Majesty, GEORGE THE
Fouaſh, of ever-blessed memory, on his bronze horse to the starboard|#
of me.
“Just, turning "º. a little, I could
see his Majesty. hat a pucker”he was
in to be sure. Every hair of his royal
wig, stood on end, like wires upon a wool-
comber. His face went all askew, and his
lip dropt at the low company about him,
for all the world as when he washed the
thoughts of marriage out of his mouth
with a glass of brandy (as LoRD MALMEs-
BURY below has since joked him about);
and he seemed to say to himself-over-
hauling his thoughts—“The nasty mob
warn’t allowed to do these things in the
days of CASTLEREAGH.’ And then he
looked ahead to the Horse Guards, as
though every minute expecting the
Qons to...gallop up, and fire, upon 'em.

pity. But, as a tar's private wrongs have nothing to do with his
QUEEN–God bless her! she looks very nice when she goes to Par-
liament—what I have to say is this—
“If this MR. CochRANE ever throws out the false colour of liberty
again, to bring a lot of fools and rogues together, to have their heads
broke, let me — as an old sailor, who knows what mutiny, is— let
me only advise this: , Just—as MR. C. is so very fond of Trafalgar
Square (I wish he'd had half as much of it as I have)—just let the
Government mast-head him here along with me. When he's once up,
if º: comes down till I think he's well served out, my name, Mr. Punch,
isn't—
“NELSON AND BRONTI.”
“P.S., No. 1. I don’t know what SIR Robert PEEL can think of
his Trafalgar Square now-for it isn't mine—I deny that. I do believe
that it’s all along of the National Gallery that the mob came here. It’s
such a low rubbishing ºf and makes people feel yulgar while the
look at it. For one thing, however, in my affliction I am grateful, an

as I am to stand near the National Gallery, I’m grateful that they’ve

HURRY.SKURRY TAXATION.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE Exchequer tells us, in one of his recent
clever speeches upon finance, that “when the hurry of business is
over, he intends to turn, his attention, to the subject of the general
rºyision, of taxation.” This is exceedingly kind of our friend, the
Chancellor; but still, it strikes us that the best time for this revision
would have been, not after the closing of Parliament, but rather before
the opening of it. What should we think of John, if, upon ringing for
our hot water and boots in the morning, he were to tell us he would
turn his attention to it when the hurry of the day's business was over?
What would the CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer himself say if, upon
his applying for his five or ten thousand, or whatever it may be a year,
we were to say to him, “You must excuse us: we will attend to it
when the hurry of business is over?” and then postpone the subject
for a year, or perhaps for ever. - - -
An actor would be dismissed if he were not perfect to the day in his
part; an official assignee would be roughly handſºd if his accounts were
put off for a twelvemonth; and we doubt if the plea of the “hurry
of business” would avail either of them much. Besides, the duties of
a CHANCELLOR or THE Exchequer cannot be so very excessive, espe-
cially in a Whig Ministry. His greatest difficulty seems to be to create
a deficiency; and we all know from experience how easily a difficulty of
that simple nature is surmounted every year. Hurry or no hurry, the
result is always the same; so why make such a fuss about it! SIR
Charles Wood is the first Chancellor we ever knew to be “in a hurry”
§ . taxation. We are only afraid that persons in a hurry never

SONG OF THE ARRESTED ONE.
My tailor has deceived me, and he’s broken every vow ; , ,
He promised time, and credit too-Alas, he’s done me now!
The heartless sneer, “Oh, pay him then,” they say; but goºdness!
And peace has vanish’d from my soul, and pale insolvent brow.
I cannot pay, my heart is full—I would my purse were so!—

Where—where the fi-pun-note I borrow'd three long days ago?
Alas! I’ve but a guinea left—“Esto perpetuo '''
A spunging-house—Qh, fatal go!--and is it come to this?.
The beer-stained tables, and the dirt, proclaim it RAYther is.
Oh! would I had the wings of doves, to flee and be at peace,
Or any style of poultry that my weeping readers please!

COCHRANE ON WINDOW-BREAKING.
THIS fºllº heads a petition to Parliament against the abuse of
window.breaking. MR. Cochrane's political reputation has droope
so very much of late, that we are not surprised he should endeavour to
bring it up under glass.
A WERY BACKWARD MAN.
SIR. Robert, it is rumoured, is about to return to Office. The report
originates solely in the fact that he has said lately he would not. e

XVIII.-Delays are dangerous. - -
His accounts for the proverbial perils of the Court
s of Chancery. There is, however, a sort of con-
science in these delays; for Chancery is reluctant,
as it were, to ruin its victims too rapidly.
XIX.-Deeds are fruits ; words are but leaves.
§ . There are some deeds—those of lawyers, for
instance—which, if they are really fruits, must
be stone fruits, for they are exceedingly unwhole-
some. These same deeds are fruits in another
sense, for they admit of very large pickings.
XX.-Deserve success, and you shall command it.
There is something consolatory in the idea of being able to command
success; but it is one thing to command, and another to obtain
obedience. Merit very frequently has its reward, though too often the
reverse occurs; and every one must allow that mere dessert is not always
equivalent to a dinner. -
XXI.-Early to bed, and early to rise,
Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.
If this proverb were literally true, the wisest and wealthiest men in
England, would be the sweeps, the bakers, and the market-gardeners.
The earliest ramoneur, who is always “up”—the chimney—“with the
lark,” should be a compound of QLD PARR, CROEsus, and SoLoN, if this
saying could be thoroughly relied upon.
XXII.-Every man is the architect of his own fortune.
This is true; but the architect must have the building materials
to work with, or his architectural industry and skill would be wasted
on castles in the air. It is on this account, probably, that the homely
saying of “Go it like bricks!” is often addressed to a person willing to
become the architect of his own fortune.
XXIII.-Ecerything hath an end, and a pudding hath two.
In this respect the county of Middlesex is superior to a pudding,
inasmuch as, while the latter hath two ends, the former hath three;
namely, North End, Ponder's End, and another called Snagg's End,
near the two-mile stone. The author of the

XXIV.-Everything is good in its season.
We have seen some theatres in their season, without having anything

ecause it happened to be the season for such a commodity. To us a
whelk was never welcome.

Parallel Points.
THE Paris Revolution and the Trafalgar Square, Ditto present, two
curious points of resemblance. We mean the rapid disappearance of two
hoards. The first is the memorable hoard so long held up to universal
infamy in our pages, and, which acted as a poor screen to NELsoN on
his column of #. and the second is the immense hoard, or rather
hoards, of money which flours Pimºre was reported to have saved on
the throne of France. Both hoards have disappeared “like the baseless
fabric of a vision.” We only wish the Pillar, which is a very ugly
vision, would go after them.
The True and the Beautiful.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 127
A veTERAN gent, just stepped out of a boat,
In a tattered old hat and a ragged pea-coat,
Appeared at a shop whither many folks run,
§ that was the palace of Moses AND SON.
A respectable dame with the mariner went,
Most likely the wife of this veteran gent,
And the eyes of the pair were excited with won-
der on seeing the mansion of Moses AND SON.
“I’ve look’d upon many a palace before,
But splendour like this, love, I never yet sor "
This party exclaimed. “What a great sum of mon-
ey it sure must have cost MEssRs. Moses AND SON!”
In the language of France his good lady replied, .
“This house is well known through the universe wide;
And you, my dear PHILIP, to seed having run,
Had better refit with E. Moses AND Son.”
E. Moses stepped forth with a bow full of grace,
Inviting the couple to enter his place:
He thought they were poor—but the poor are not done,
And the rich are not fleeced by E. Moses AND SON.
“What clothes can I serve you to-day, my good man?”
E. Moses exclaimed: “You shall pay what you can;
The peer or the peasant, we suit every one;
Republicans true are E. Moses AND SON.”
The pea-coated gent at that word made a start,
And looked nervously round at the goods of our mart:
“A vest, coat, and trowsers, as soon as they’re done,
I want, s'il vous plait, MEssieurs Moses AND SON.
“I once was a king, like the monarch of Room,
But was forced from my throne and came off in a Br—m;

CHICKEN FOR THE MILLION.
MR. CANTELo seems born for the refutation, of the proverb which
forbids us to count our chickens before they are hatched. He professes
to be able, by his system of artificial incubation, to produce seventy-five
chickens, on an average, out of a hundred eggs. In a letter to the
Morning Post, he declares, “I shall go on till I can produce poultry for
the million.” He proceeds to give some startling statistics of the
national deficiency in poultry, whereof he says, “At present, the supply
is not half a fowl a year to every member of the community.” That is,
a leg, a wing, a breast, and backbone, with the merry-thought, res-
pectively to each. It would take,” according to MR. QANTELO, “from
twenty-five to thirty millions of money embarked in the business, to give
everyone a chicken once a month.”
As the means, are º disproportionate to the end proposed, and
thirty millions are hardly likely to be forthcoming just now, we have
not much opinion of MR. CANTELo's project, considered as a public
undertaking. However, as a private speculation, we think, highly of
his scheme for producing cheap chickens. ... We really wish him every
success; and if he can only provide us with poultry at a shilling the

The Strangest Metamorphosis of 1848.
Ovid does not contain a metamorphosis more wonderful than the
following:-The abolition of titles in France changing, in one day, all
the noblemen into gentlemen. Some of our nobility must be envious
that they were not Frenchmen; but probably the metamºrphosis might
not have succeeded so well. Of º the English gentleman
is the most difficult to assume, especially at an hour's notice. Hºwever,
there would be no harm in trying the experiment, just on a small scale.
We wonder if the noble º: of Blenheim would submit to, the
strange metamorphosis for one ł. The public would, gain, by it, as
the shillings for admission to Blenheim Palace would instantly be
abolished; for what gentleman, we ask, would allow his house to be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH AT THE CIRQUE NATIONAL.
IRCUMSTANCEs, and a cab, took us to Drury Lane
Theatre a few evenings ago, where we found the
equestrian artistes from Paris, who are no doubt
ſad enough to be “from Paris,” in the present
#. times, when a state of “universal
brotherhood” seems likely to lead to “universal
botherhood,” if not to something worse. - -
We cannot help pitying poor old Drury in its
numerous reverses; but really our sympathy has
lately been, so much taxed, that the ci-devant
temple of the British Drama is becoming almost
as great a bore as “a man with a grievance,”
whose tales of ill-treatment we can no longer
listen to. We have let loose the flood-gates of
our sorrow so often over the desecration of old
Drury, that we have scarcely a tear remaining to
squeeze out upon the last indignity put upon the
former home of SHAKSPEARE ; and we have come
to the philosophic determination that “what can’t
be cured must be endured.”. If we were to weep
our eyes out, how faint would be the impression
- we could make on the sawdust now lying in the
pit of Drury Lane; and were we to sigh ourselves
away into half our present size, we could not
“the former light restore” of the English National
- Drama.
We can therefore only plunge into the circle, with a clownish exclamation of “Here we
are " and take, such amusement as the equestrian troupe may offer us. We entered the house
just as two gentlemen were lying on their backs, and balancing a couple of globes on their toes;
a process in which the two Frenchmen kicked the miniature world about as unceremoniously as
their countrymen would seem inclined to kick about the great original. It was very amusing
to see these two. French gentlemen with the world at their feet, though we could not help
thinking that a similar exhibition, if attempted in the great political arena by the Gallic nation
at large, would not be a very pleasing spectacle.
A M. FELIX next merited our approbation, for the graceful and easy way in which he rode
backwards at full gallop—a feat, by the way, that is now being accomplished in a political sense,
though not with a very successful result, by some of his compatriots. - *
We pass over the Four Seasons, as well we may in these times, when we are living at the rate
of a century a day, and come to the Roman Games, which give us anything but a lively idea
of the sports of the Roman youth, who seem to have taken delight in riding six horses at a
stretch, and indeed at such a stretch, that we expect every now and then to see realised the
old dramatic announcement of M. So and So “in two pieces.” But MADLLE: CAROLINE’s is
the triumph of equestrianism. Mounted on a charger, who, like the “old Joe” of the Nigger
melody, is constantly “Kicking up behind and before,”
she keeps her seat as pertinaciously as M. LEDRU-Rollin would keep his seat at the council
ºl
- k! º

º
table of the Provisional Government. Like him she overrides the spirit exerted for throwing her
off, and like him, she turns towards the multitude, and makes a plunge as if she would stop at
nothing. Like him she leaps over every barrier
with an audacity quite surprising, but unlike
him, she gains admiration and applause for
her achievements.
The AURIols, old and young, are amon
the troupe ; and though the English audi-
ences try hard to fratermise with French
humour, the fraternisation is an unhappy
failure. The Parisian clowns to the ring
accomplish the most admirable feats, which
deserve and obtain the warmest applause;
but the spoken fun falls as dead as Coch-
RANE's attempt to revolutionise Charing Cross
i. establish a dictatorship in the left-hand
aSlm.
We hope the French, equestrians are
making more from English liberality than
the British workmen in France, are likely to
get from French humanity, º and
justice. The keep of the horses will be the
chief expense; and on the night of our visit,
we counted at least two quarters of oats in
the pit, a load of beans in the private-boxes,
and a fair allowance of chaff in the galleries.
Supposing any of the horses to be ill, we
think we might fairly calculate that there was
a warm mash a piece in the rush at half-price;
and, taking it for granted that extra exertion
in some of the animals would call for extra
sustenance, we should say there were at least
two extra feeds in the two proscenium boxes.
THE IRISH MEMBERS AND THE
INCOME-TAX.
. The pursuit of Repeal, has been long con:
sidered a wild-goose chase; and peal
itself, from the dissensions of the Old
and Young Irelanders, is esteemed by many
as a “gone goose.” A sudden brightness,
however, has dawned on the prospects of the
Irish patriots, which have unexpectedly taken
to looking up. We do not allude to the
influence of the French Revolution, but to
that of a revolution which is commencing in
this country, and which has been originated
by the Irish Members. These gentlemen, with
an intrepidity—of face—for which we could
hardly have given even them credit, have,
with almost one accord, voted for the impo-
sition of the Income-Tax on this country;
whilst, with the same unanimity, * º:
y this

gallant defiance of common decency and
delicacy, they have excited an enthusiasm in
the cause of Repeal, in the mind of every
true Englishman. They have so plainly
proved their ability to take care of them-
selves, that we are now quite satisfied that
they should be allowed to do so. The English
nation owes them its thanks for the Income-
Tax; and we cannot do better than leave them
to manage their own affairs, without—but let
them mark well this condition-any longer
troubling them with our slightest assistance.

THE HAMADRYAD OF THE BOULEWARDS.
THE axe and the saw of Liberty—she sometimes uses all weapons—
has been known, in her wrath and exigence, to wield even scythes and
reaping-hooks; the axe and the saw have laid low the trees of Paris

They are still immortal in the heart of man, albeit the heart
siſks and rises with the low, quick pulse of the Stock Exchange.
And Hamadryads still live in all the trees of the Boulevards; though
one race has fallen with the trees of February, another sisterhood will
flourish with the newly-planted. Another race that—sophisticated it may
be by the fashions of the Gaul, fashions coming in and going out wit
spring, summer, and autumn º: of butterflies—will still endure
and flourish, the guardian nymphs of green and growing timber, looking
down from their .*. of leaves, now upon a black moustache, and
now upon a rose-blush bonnet.
The dying speech of a Hamadryad, of the 24th of February, has been
waſted to us. As the axe struck at the trunk that enshrined her, she
sighed forth her odorous breath, dying with sweet and solemn content,
ſor—she knew it—she died to make a barricade; she fell in the cause
of Freedom. - - - -

the spring came, my blood danced up and down, and I wore buds in my

deepened and changed, and I was never, for twenty-four hours, behind
the fashion of the season. -
“Beautiful days!. There was hope, there was confidence in the looks
and the voices of all men. Young patriots, with moustache of raven,
would sing the Marseillaise; and at the name of the Citizen King men
would embrace, and say to one another what LAPAYETTE-poor simple
heart—had said before, “Louis-PHILIPPE was the Best of Republics.
“And year after year went on. And men taking tobacco and coffee

THE MODEL AGITATOR.
HE is born with the bump of Notoriety.
*** This bump first expands at school.
n He heads, all the rows. His
special delight is in teasing the
masters. As for punishments, they
only whip him on to renewed rows.
He is insensible to the came, quite
callous to the birch. At home the
bump grows larger. He bullies the
servants, and plays the democrat to
his younger brothers. He is always
in open rebellion with “the go-
vernor,” and very seditious on the
question of latch-keys. His love of
talk bursts out on every little occa-
º sign. He will not, ring the bell
§ without an argument. He is very
rich in contradictions, having always
a No for everybody else's Yes. At
last he revolts against parental
tyranny, and is kicked out of doors.
He is an injured man, and joins a
debating club. The bump gets bigger. He attends a public meeting.
The bump enlarges still more. He is called to the bar, and the bump
has reached its culminating height. Henceforth he and Notoriety are
two inseparables. He runs after it everywhere, and eventually, after
numerous dodges through bye lanes, and heaps of mud, and narrow,
dirty courses, and the most questionable paths, he catches the dear
object of his pursuit. He is notorious ! He has good lungs, and his
reputation is made. He is a hearty hater of every Government. In
fact he is always hating. He knows there is very little motoriety to be

gained by praising.
The only thing he flatters is the mob. Nothing is too sweet for them;
every word is a lump of sugar. He flatters their faults, feeds their pre-
judices with the coarsest stimulants, and paints, for their amusement,
the blackest things white.

He is madly cheered in consequence. In
But cheers do not pay, however loud. The
most prolonged applause will not buy a mutton chop. The hat is carried
round, the pennies rain into it, and the Agitator pours them into his
patriotic pocket. . It is suddenly discovered that he has made some
tremendous sacrifice for the people. The public sympathy is first
raised, then a testimonial, then a subscription. He is grateful, and
promises the Millenium. The trade begins to answer, and he fairl
opens shop as a Licensed Agitator. He hires several journeymen wit
good lungs, and sends agents—patriotic bagmen—round the country to
sell his praises and insults, the former for himself, and the latter for every-
body else. Every paper that speaks the truth of him is publicly hooted
at; everybody who opposes him is pelted with the hardest words selected
i from the Slang Dictionary. A good grievance is started, and hunted

everywhere. People join in the cry, the Agitator leading off and shouting
the loudest. The grievance is run off its legs; but another and another
soon follows, till there is a regular pack of them. The country is in a
continual ferment, and at last rises. Riots ensue; but the Model
Agitator is the last person to suffer from them. He excites the
people to arm themselves for the worst; but begs they will use
no weapons. His talk is incendiary, his advice nothing but gun-
powder, and yet he hopes no explosion will take place. He is an
Arsenal wishing to pass for a Chapel or a Baby-linen warehouse. He is
- his hearers grow furious as they listen to
him, and rush out to burn ricks and shoot landlords. He is always
putting his head on the block. Properly speaking, he is beheaded

once a quarter.
A Monster Meeting is his great joy, to be damped, only, by the rain
or the police. He glories in a prosecution. He likes to be prosecuted.
He asks for it: shrieks out to the Government—“Why don't you pro-
secute me?” and cries, and gets quite mad if they will not do it. The
rows fat

ONE would imagine that the late tremendous Revolution in Trafalgar
Square had been in consequence of the Window-Tax; for the hatred of
the mob seems to have been hurled principally against the panes of glass.
The Chartists cannot surely imagine that the “five points” are within
a stone’s-throw of being carried; or, do they smash the windows on the
principle that when things come to the worst they are sure to mend?
The above portrait of a house that stood the front of the attack
during the three days of our inglorious Revolution, only shows what
wrong views misguided men are apt to take when they get everything
into their own hands. It is, indeed, a painful illustration of the
shattered frame, of society—we mean that kind of society which has
had its fling lately under the head, or rather the name, of Cochranites.
It is very clear that they do not live in glass houses.

liberty, the unfortunate men were publicly sold !

so she went a jabbring on;, but I'm blest if the Puple would let her
pass that way. They said there was a barrygade in the street, and turn-

impawsable to pass.

(of the Pollypicnic School, CANTYBERRY says, though what that is he
doant No), comes up to the door, while hothers old the osses, and says,
“Miladi, il faut descendres; ” which means, you must git out.

waggling her phethers and diminds, and screamin like a Macaw.

though he was ready to bust with laffin hisself. “We must make a
barrygade of the carridge. The cavilry is at one hend of the street, the
hartillary at the other; there’ll be a fight presently, and out you
must git.”
LADY KICKLEBURY set up a screaming louder than hever, and I war-
rant she hopped out pretty quick this time, and the hoffiser, giving her
his harm, led her into a kimmis shop, and giv her a glas of sally-
valattaly.
Meanwild CANTYBERRY sat puffin like a grampus on his box, his
face as red as Cielingwhacks. His osses had been led out before his

AN ANGLO-DUTCH VILLAGE.
THE rural district of Dalston has lately run the risk of having been
washed away. The Rain has invaded the houses, and sorely puzzled
the inhabitants how to repel the intruder; for there were not pails and

last week, has been in an amphibious state—one day on water, the next
day on dry land. If it had been built on the Goodwin Sands, it could not
be worse, further than it might have disappeared some showery
afternoon altogether. The householders are at a loss how to hold up
their heads against the tremendous overflows their houses have
lately had.

HOW TO DRESS A REVOLUTION.
. This very º: plat, though unsuited to the English Constitution,
is so very popular just now on the Continent, where it appears at most
royal entertainments, that we are induced to give the following recipes
for preparing it, according to the fashion of the different countries in
which it may be called at present a standing dish.
Revolution. A la Parisienne,—Take an old King and a, batch of
Ministers—if in an advanced, state of corruption, so much the better.
Then set on your public opinion, and let it boil, throwing in stimulants
à discrétion, and peppering highly with the most exciting topics tied up
tight in an old newspaper. Stir in your King and ters; when
your mixture ferments, strain them off and throw them aside. Next
take a poet, an astronomer, pamphleteer, a working man, and two or
three journalists (the higher flavoured are the best); mix into a Pro-
visional Government;...squeeze them well, and shred them into your
stock, when at the boiling point. Flavour with Socialism, Communism,
Liberty, Fraternity, and £ºli, and serve up hot.
Revolution à la Berlinaise.-Take of disappointed, hopes and broken
pledges as much as you want, let them simmer for thirty years in a cas-
serole kept very close shut. en sufficiently done, which you may
ascertain by the bitter taste and turbid look of your liquid, throw in at
intervals a handful of German nationality (which may be got very cheap
and strong at any German university town), and a rough censorship;
season with aspirations and imaginations & discrétion. in a few
heads of La Parisienne and La Marseillaise, with a bunch of Waterland
and Burschen-lieder, and a weak extract of spirit of royalty. Garnish
with poudre de canon and boulets, and serve up luke-warm.
Regolution à la Petit Allemand-Take small Germans, such as you
may find readily in the Almanach de Sare-Gotha, throw them into a
strong revolutionary stock, made in the proportion of an ounce of
common sense to a pound of despotism, and the mixture will effervesce,
your small Germans rising to the surface. You may serve either with
or, without your small Germans, according to taste; but the dish, in
either case, is not one we can recommend, being, in fact, a very feeble
imitation of an English original.
OUR NATIONAL DEFENCES.
WE are happy to hear that a few .. young men have formed
themselves intº a volunteer corps, under the Colonelcy of the Duº or
RICHMOND, and are meeting twice a week at ANGELo's Fencing Rooms
in Bond Street at # past 5 A.M., for the purpose of learning the military
exercise. This is patriotism with a vengeance; for though it is an
every-day occurrence to talk of dying for one's country, the idea of
turning out of bed at # past 5 ſor one's country, wº: a piece of
eroism that no one can be expected to perform. e have no doubt
that in an emergency the whole of the British nation would rise—at
four in the morning—as one man; but, under existing circumstances,
when it is not absolutely urgent that the razor should be exchanged for
the sword, and the boot-hook for the bayonet, there is a wonderful
amount of fortitude and patriotism in the movement of the Bond Street
Brigade, which goes on duty with the milk, and has achieved its morning
task by the time the regular dustman is only beginning to bite the dust.

THE
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR. BRIEFLESS.
CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.
UMPTIous, my landlord, was
very angry with me for leaving
the fortified attic, I had held
under him for the last quarter,
and H. insisted that I had un-
settled everything by my brief
tenancy; though, judging by
the applications for money
with which he was beset,
everything must have been
fearfully, unsettled before I
came to his abode. He hinted
that I had caused him to reject
a most eligible offer from a
Queen's Counsel, who would
have taken half the chambers
#. and paid all the rent
in advance, if I had not come
to an agreement just in time.
I left him, however, on good
terms, at three o'clock, one
summer's afternoon, while he
was taking in bed, according
to custom, his usual breakfast of a red herring and a quart bottle of
stout. He lived chiefly on dried fish, and heavy fluids; the herring
or soldier inspiring him, as he told me, with valour to face the
difficulties of his position, while the beer served as a sort of heavy
armour inst the assaults of his creditors. He fancied, moreover,
that the liquid gave him a pleasing substitute for that refresher he
was never ** to enjoy in a more professional form; and I have
known him murmur out, º you, BARCLAY AND PERKINs,” as he
perused, previous to settling the delicious draught. I am, however, in
danger, like the “gentle Zitella,” of loitering “too long on the road;’
so, being aware that the time for sending in copy is “advancing,” and
that the printer’s “devil’s abroad,” I shall go gallantly ahead
my manuscript. -
I had not quitted my fastness in the den of my dum-haunted friend
without providing myself, with other quarters, in lieu of those I had
halved, and a set of chambers—for chambers, like artificial teeth, jugs,
and window-curtains, are generally disposed of in sets—had been already
secured. These ...; of one of those mountain peaks which give
to a part of the Temple the appearance of an artificial or mosaic chain
of Apennines, rising up in proud opposition to thºse dreamy, uplands
which form the apocryph º mountain scenery, under the well-known
name of the Surrey #. --
These great untraceables, which, are said to be visible, from the º
window of every furnished lodging in London, on a clear º were hel
out as a bait to me, by way of inducing me to locate myse f where my
professional prospects would be so lofty. But, alas! how visiºnary are
such allurements, which, like the money of the industrious classes in
the French Savings Bank, after the glorious Revolution, got up for their
exclusive advantage, could not be realised. When I sought to feast my
gaze on the alleged hills, I was doomed to see nothing but a quantity
of the celebrated metropolitan curling fluid, forcing its eccentric way
from forests of chimney-pots, and leading the imagination to suppºse
that everyone of the Surrey His must beaminiature Vesuvius, judging
from the quantity of smoke it sent forth. Isometimes grew poetical on
my disappointment, and qut of fl. chaos of my feelings a beautiful set
of verses would occasionally arrange themselves, in a strain resembling
the following:-

Athwart the courts while glancing,
Elm, Pump, Fig-tree, Hare,
My gaze, with speed advancing,
paused in mute despair.
For in the distance lying,
Isee a cloud of fume,
Like fields of darkness flying
Tow’rds some far land of gloom.
Ande'en when days are clearer,
And I can plainly trace,
As if it had been nearer,
Nature's long distant face,
I come to a conclusion, -
Which every day-dream kills,
That they’re a mere delusion,
Those boasted Surrey Hills,
It would be difficult indeed, to descend suddenly from the poetic
heights amongst which I have been wandering, and fall to a subject so
insignificant as the engagement of a clerk; and therefore, for this
necessary appendage to a set of practicable chambers, of which the pos-
session is more than nominal-that is to say, including something
one’s name upon the door-I must refer

the reader to the ensuing c
ENGLISH ASYLUMS FOR FOREIGN. SOWEREIGNS.
A GREAT deal of misapprehension * to prevail on the subject
of the possessions held in this country by foreign sovereigns. Louis-
PHILIPPE's alleged two millions in the British Funds have dwindled down
to four hundred a year from a furnished house in Long Acre; and
indeed, that being just now unlet, he is compelled to reside, like a
policeman, in Leopold's empty house at Claremont, with the run of
the garden-stuff to supply him with eatables. If we have many more
distressed monarchs running, over, here for shelter, we shall...be
obliged to get up a benefit for them at one of the theatres, in imitation
of the liberality of MR.LUMLEY, who has just granted his splendid
establishment for a performance for the iº artisans. A series
of Walhalla-like tableaua of the Revolutions in the respective countries
where they have occurred, would prove immensely attractive, if the
deposed sovereigns and their ministers would, in the political poses
plastiques which we suggest, sustain their original characters,
REWARD OF MERIT.
THE Commissioners of Police have been graciously pleased to allow
as many of the letters of the alphabet as were present at the recent
revolutions in the metropolis to wear upon their buttons the words
“Trafalgar Square” and “Kennington Common,” in honour of their
brilliant achievements on those memorable occasions. This generous
act, which was only due to the bravery of the hardy sons of Scotland
Yard, redounds greatly to the credit of the Commissioners, and has
produced the most unbounded satisfaction amongst all the members of
the force, from 1 to 100 inclusive. A wreath of laurel is to run round
the edges of the buttons, which are to be put into hand and distributed
immediately, and not to wait, as has been falsely reported, till the
distribution of the medals to the Peninsular heroes. This latter favour
was granted especially at the request of the Duke of WELLINGros,
who, we are proud to say, not only appreciates, but takes a pleasure in
rewarding merit, in any shape.
Atrocious Assault.
The following has been forwarded to us by the Electric Telegraph.
We think we shall be able to recover damages from the Company for
the assault, for we were quite taken aback at the time by the violence
of the blow, and have scarcely recovered from it yet. Let the reader
see how he likes it himself:-
F Q. Wy is there no chance of the Comte DE PARIs being King of
rance
A. Because Louis-PHILIPPE sacrificed the heir to the crown, when
he threw away his wig.
... We have laid our damages at £10,000, and we are positive an intel-
ligent jury will award us every #. of them. If not, there is no
justice, no redress for injuries in England!
Cock and Hen Colours.
Frankfort correspondent of the Times gratifies the world with
the subjoined intelligence:-
“The national colours are worn by every one, in the shape of a small cockade, and
some enthusiastic citizens have decorated their pigeons, cocks, and hens-nay, even the
asses march about the streets arrayed in the Germantricolor.”
This is only fair, and in a truly liberal spirit. How long, for instance,
have double-headed eagles, and ies, and lions, and griffins, been the
aristocrats of the lower world, elevated by the herald? Equality, how-
ever, is now taking a turn even in the º and stable. Goiáen
eagles and unicorms have had their 3. tis time, then, that cocks
and hens, and drudging asses, should make a holiday of it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
COLONEL SIBTHORP
ON THE FINAL CAUSE OF SQUIRES.
, URELY it is a strange coin-
cidence that original minds
will often singly hit upon
the same idea. The two
subjoined passages exhibit
N a striking instance of this
A coincidence between, the
A views of two intellects of
a very different order, and
of two several ages—the
s one a departed, the other
a contemporary genius.
The first of these quota.
tions runs thus:-
“I have, indeed, a much better
opinion of this kind of men than
is entertained by some, as I take
them to answer the order of Na-
ture, and the good purposes for
which they were ordained, in a much more ample manner than many others. Now, as
HoRAce tells us that there are a set of human beings, fruges consumere nati—“born to
consume the fruits of the earth”—so I make no manner of doubt but that there are
others, feras consumere nati—“born to consume the beasts of the field”—or, as it is
commonly called, the game; and none, I believe, will deny but that these squires fulfil
this end of their creation.”
The above sentences were written by HENRY FIELDING, and are con-
tained in the second chapter of the third book of Tom Jones; or, The
History of a Foundling. Our second extract is the following:—
“It was the unanimous opinion of the tenant-farmers that the game preserves were
the main cause that induced gentlemen to reside on their estates, and fulfil those duties
which their wealth and station called upon them to discharge.”
The foregoing words are a portion of the speech reported to have
been delivered on MR. BRIGHT's motion for the Repeal of the Game
Laws, and in º to the same, by Colon EL SIBTHORP.
The idea which they embody may be safely concluded to be the
Colonel's own, since to have borrowed it from Field.ING, it is necessary
to suppose, not only that he has read him, but that he has understood
im. The fine satire of the Author of Tom Jones is confirmed by
the rich gravity of the Member for Lincoln. According to the gallant
and candid Colonel, the main cause that induces country gentlemen to
reside on their estates is the love of sport;, to this the fulfilment of the
duties attached to their position being a subordinate consideration.
It is for the preservation of the pheasantry, then, rather than of the
peasantry; of partridges, hares, and rabbits, rather than of the peace,
of which they are Justices, that country gentlemen live—at least, live
upon their land. They regard their property secondarily, with a view
to its improvement, primarily to the increase of the game which it pro-
duces. They are attached to it more by the amusement than even by
the revenue which it affords them;. Such are “the good purposes for
which they were ordained;” or which, at least, they subserve, according
to the tenant-farmers and Colonel SIBTHORP. And in consideration
of being enabled to divert themselves by sporting, they are willing, to
fulfil the duties of their station—which principally consist in ºil.
some of their wealth among those who create the whole of it.
It is very well for the tenant-farmers to say all this—for they have
good reason to know and lament it. But for one of the squirearchy
themselves to º te such a statement, is indeed very indiscreet.
'Tis an ill bird that befouls its own nest—a bird which we might
almost venture to call a goose. Oh SIBTHoRP SIBTHoRPl
The Moon's Changes.
QUR friend ALDERMAN Moon has been leaving his name at the Palace.
This is nothing but right, after the many attentions which the worthy
Alderman has received from the Royal Family. We regret, however,
that we have not seen his name amongst the hundreds of noblemen who
rushed to condole with Louis-PHILIPPE, through the medium of their
cards, upon his ex-Majesty's recent misfortunes. Moon no sym-
pathy for the abandoned crown of France? Has he so soon forgotten
the hospitality of the Tuileries? This total eclipse of Moon is even
blacker than the one which occurred after the rain last Sunday week.
But probably the princely patron of the R.A.'s is only waiting %. His
ex-Majesty to recover his exuberance of whiskers, before he calls upon
him, to ask him to sit for his ex-royal portrait. There is nothin É.
combining business with pleasure, when you can do it with a good face.

tates. Europe for the last month has been
nothing better than a big slate, where any-
body who has had the knowledge of drawing

was at liberty to make what sketch or new design he pleased.
The geography of France, however, requires the most correction.
We say France, to make use of the old name, for we doubt if there is
º and departments. They are all wiped away, like so many
rops of water, and are now swamped in the great ocean (by no means
a Pacific one) of Paris. There were once upon a time great cities, like
Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, Lyons, Orleans, and a large family of
rovincial capitals, who derived their importance from silk, or wine, or
arbours, or sausages, or pâtés, if not politics, of some kind or other.
Paris has guillotined them all. All other cities are contemptible ciphers
by the side of that great unit. In fact, il n'y a plus de France. It is
now all Paris. Future ARRowsMITHs must make a note of this, and in
describing the past capital of Gaul, print as follows:-
“Paris begins at the Pas de Calais, and extends as far as the Mediter:

thirty-seven millions of inhabitants, and enjoys absolute power over

THE
ROMANCE OF ADVERTISING.
MR. Colºurs, who maybe presumed
tº know what are the legitimate modes
of advertising, has put forth something
quite new in the art of literary puffing,
with º ence to his collection of
Standard Novels. He says, the new
vºlume, which is to º with the
Magazines on the 1st of April, will be
*The work which was found by theside of the
unfortunate Duchess; nk Paasins, and which,
it is understood, she was perusing at the
moment she was attacked by her husband—
a work which has been pronounced to exhibit
a better lesson to the sex than is contained in
a volume of Mas, Cnapoxe's Letters,”
We learn from this that MR.
Colburn relies for the sale of this
book upon the fact that it was being
read, just previously to her murder, by
the unfortunate victim of assassination;
and, though we can see no possible
connection between the merit of the
book and the crime set forth in the
advertisement, we presume that the
publisher knows his business, and has
reason to expect, a favourable, result
from the sanguinary spice he has
throwminto his puff.
We perceive quite a new era of
advertising opened by the line that has
been adopted, and we daresay that, in
future, no act of atrocity or villany
will be committed without its being
made use of by way of recommendation
to some forthcoming work. The mis:
cellaneous reading of the victim of
GREENACRE, had it been known to the
publishers, might have been very ser-
viceableiman advertising point of view;
and Hocker's perusal of any one of
the romances of the season would, of
course, have raised the favoured pro-
duction into rapid popularity, if the
connection of author and reader be:
tween the writer and the murderer had
been º known. We could
suggest a few specimens of this style
of advertising; but, as it would be
invidious to place any particular work
under distinguished criminal patron-
age, we abstain from furnishing the
º puffs that we might otherwise
ave put forth.
The French Princes.
WE understand that, immediately
on the arrival of the PRINCE DE Join-
viºle, in England, he proceeded tº
offer his services to the London and
Westminster. Iron, and Twopenny
Steam Packet Navigation Company.
MEssRs. CATTARNs and FRY, in the
name of the Directory, declined the
proposition, but intimated, with much
º feeling, that the British paddle-
o
x was always open as a º to glory
for those who had proved their sincerity
in England's cause...The DUKE. D'AU-
MALE has, it is said, applied for the
vernorship of the isle of Dogs, and

MEMOIR OF MR. MITCHELL.
---
*\ſº
| | || ſ'ſ ſº N
|TM’ſº
"ºulºu– Wºº
--
THIs individual, who has lately burst upon the world in the character
of an Irish patriot, was born of humble but honest parents, who sent
him to a small school, where he received several of those whippings,
which, had they been judiciously economised, might, some of them, have
been spared most advantageously, and come in very beneficially at the
present period. - - -
Young MITCHELL evinced, in early life, no decided predilection for
learning; and when his schoolfellows were engaged in their ordinary
tasks, he would be found in one corner of the playground, throwing up
brandy-balls, and catching them dreamily in his mouth, an incident to
which some are disposed to attribute the fiery nature of his eloquence.
He soon, however, began to show a disposition for romantic reading,
and we at the age of fifteen in a state of frenzied rapture over
an illustrated Edition of The Blood-Red Knight, which gave the hue to
his future character. - -
Perhaps, however, his mental condition took its last completing
stamp from the incident of the pot-boy Oxford having sprung, at one
bound, from the*...*. yard to the arena of notoriety, % a mis-
chievous and malignant piece of pea-shooting at the QUEEN, Oxford
had fired the pistol, and the pistol had fired Mitch ELL to such an extent
that his brain—what there was of it—became inflamed with the desire
of heroic martyrdom. It is true that the whipping clause had not then
been added to the Act for dealing with the §. of mischievous
urchindom, or there might have been an alteration, in MITCHELL’s
views; but the impress was given-he had become, in mind and intellect,
an Irish Oxfoºp, and no succeeding addition made by the legislature to
the penal statutes for repressing turbulent snob-ism could restrain him
from his puerile propensities. As he has lately been dignified by being
made the subject of a government prosecution, the height of his ambi-
tion must be presumed to have been attained. It is to be hoped that
is offence may be found to come within some category to which the
treadmill and a rigid course of hair-cutting may be applied.
The Royal Game of Goose.
THE publishers of the Almanac de Sare-Gotha are in the greatest
state of excitement. There has been a great temporary demand for
their little periodical, from persons anxious to ascertain from its pages
the names of a great many little German States and Princes, which were
never, heard of till the one was in a state of revolution, and the others
had abdicated—just as corked-up small beer makes a great noise when
it bursts its bottles in the dog-days. But, this momentary curiosity
once satisfied, it is feared by the proprietors that the lively little
chronicle of small royalties must shut º, altogether. Perhaps the
interest in it might be kept up for a while by transforming it into The
Sare-Gotha Calendar, on the model of the Newgate Calendar, giving an
account, not only of the birth and parentage of the various potentatikins,
but of their misdeeds and punishments.
THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR.
We are great friends of real economy; but we are desirous of
guarding against the popular error, that economy consists in the reduç-
tion of useful expenditure. Whenever a cry for retrenchment is raised,
the working men are the persons who unfortunately have the greatest
reason to tremble, while sinecurists, who receive their annual hundreds
or thousands, for some dozen signings of their name, are left to repose
snugly on their salaries. - -
France seems to be commencing its economy somewhat in the ºld
| conventional style, and we accordingly have a new Ambassador to this
|country with a salary of four hundred per annum. His Republican
|Excellency may manage, to live, if he is a single, man without encum:
|brance, upon the sum allowed him; but his establishment must be of
the most moderate kind, and his arrangements all of the most, econo-
mical character. As to an equipage of his own, that will be out of the
question; and if he attends Drawing-Rooms, or Levees at the Palace,
he must either walk or pop into the handsomest Hansom on the
nearest cab-stand.
His Excellency will, on ordinary occasions, patronise the omnibus
box, not at Her Majesty's Theatre, but on one of the Chelsea or
---
Blackwall vehicles; for cab hire, except when engaged like our old friend
CHEVALIER BUNSEN, “on a special mission,” will be quite out of the
question. We presume that he will be allowed to take some little ad-
vantage in the way of passports, for he will never make both ends meet,
and live like agentleman, upon his bare official stipend.
We hope the Provisional Government will reconsider the shabby
arrangement made with the Ambassador sent to England, so that the
poor fellow may at least, be able to keep up something like an appear:
ance among his brother diplomatists. The light comedian at ecent
theatre gets more than eight pounds per week, and the Republic ought
at least to allow the Ambassador his white kid gloves for Pº.
and six clean collars per week, in addition to the collar of the Order o
Liberty, if he is to feel comfortable in decent company.
EconoMy-WE learn that IBRAHIM PACHA was being saluted at
Naples, just as the news of the establishment of the French Republic
arrived there. This was fortunate: the same gunpowder served for a
twofold honour-every cannon firing a double compliment.

ment will be taken, with the greatest pleasure in the world, for three, six, nine, or twelve
months or years. The Gentleman desirous of this accommodation, rejects-or would
reject—with the deepest, mostinconceivable, and therefore most inexpressible scorn, any
proffersoever of the smallest tastein life of indulgence, from the parties desirous to treat
with him. On the contrary, he must be submitted to every species of revolting cruelty
and meanness. He must be denied books, pens, ink, and paper, and the sight of the faces
of his dearest kindred, the grasp of the hand, the warm pressure of amity, bubbling and
burning from the heart of devoted friendship. This, and much more than he can express
in the small limits of a public advertisement, must be denied him, or no party will be
treated with. Further, the advertiser stipulates for brown bread and brackish water as
his daily sustenance, and very little of it. Parties who can supply ſettersby the hundred-
weight (handcuffs are indispensable, or no letters will be answered) will be delightfully
responded to.—Address, postpaid (that is, with the Head of the Saxon Queen upon the

LOOP.HOLES OF BRIBERY-LAW.
To the Members for Great Yarmouth, Harwich, and Derby, we may
now add the Member for Horsham, unseated for bribery and corruption,
A rogue is an honest man till he is found out; Members of Parliament
are men: let us believe, then, in the general purity of the House of
Commons. But it is singular that the Election Committees should have
declared the unseated ones guilty of bribery merely through their
agents. This wondrous kindness would almost seem to have been
begotten of sympathy. One might really imagine that the Committee:
men must have put themselves in the place of the accused...Well-at
all events, there will be an end to capital punishment. If it is not to
commit bribery to be guilty of it through agents, it will not be to
commitmurder to beguilty of it through instruments. He who shoots
another through the head, will, of course, be acquitted; inasmuch as it
is the pistol that shoots the man, and not the person who loads it and
pulls the trigger.

BALFE AND HIS BATON.
THE music of VERDI requires so much
exertion on the part of the conductor,
that BALFE wears out a new baton every
night, when an Operaof the popular maestro
is given at Her Majesty's Theatre. The
magnificent band of the establishment
throws itself, with such enthusiasm into
the music, that it requires all the tact
and influence of the conductor to keep
the orchestral performers in their places,
and some of the wind instruments
grow positively frantic with the gigantic
nature of their task. . Such is the enor-
- mous exertion required, that the trumpets
are regularly on their metal, and after
each act, a heap of brass filings has to be removed from under the
ophycleide. The massive movements for the violoncello have frequently
worn away the strings of the instrument to a thread in a single night,
and the performer on the kettle-drum has been known to have fallen
down exhausted, like an over-fatigued policeman, on his arduous beat.
In the mean time, BALFE, like a musical AEoLUs, presides over the
harmonious storm, and insures the most perfect euphony from the
combination of the apparently discordant elements.
Dawn of Ignorance.
M. CARNot, the Minister of Public Instruction in France under the
new system of Fraternity, informs his countrymen, that “it is a great
error to suppose that it is necessary, in order to be a representative,
to have education.” This has been proved before now in our own
House of Commons; but still, if hº is to receive five-and-
twenty francs, a day, we think the least we have a right to expect
from him is, that he should be educated. The same thing is expected
from a clerk, who receives infinitely less. If all the Members of the
National Assembly are to be elected on the above principle, France
is likely to become a second Boeotia, and the president’s chair, to be
W. filled, should be put up to election only amongst the Lunatic
Asylums. If such is the instruction which M. QARNot generally dis-
tributes over France, we are profoundly grateful we have no similar
minister in our country for the propagation, of such doctrines. We
should, imagine that M. CARNOT was a pupil of M. LEDRU-Rollin—
a pupil, too, of the first class.
International Colours.
MANY of the long-sighted º declare that the moon looked
favourably on the new aspect of French affairs, for they could trace dis.
tinctly the colours of the tricolor on the clouds which, concealed it
during the late eclipse. These colours are not any one of them precisely
the couleur de rose ; but still we can understand pº well why the
moon should look with sympathy on France, for it must feel that next
to itself, there is nothing in the whole world subject to so many
changes and revolutions, as that country. We wonder the Man in
the Moon has not sent in his adhesion to the Provisional Government.
A penny postage-stamp would have done it.
THE PROGRESS OF ART.
THE artists of the illustrated newspapers have been evincing a won-
derful appreciation of the value of truthfulness to nature, in their
recent portraits of Louis-PHILIPPE, to whom, on his first arrival, they
gave, in accordance with historical accuracy, no whiskers at all." in
order to mark this curious effect of the Revolution, they turned the
ex-king's head into the most uncomfortable attitudes, so that the
absence of whiskers, caused by his shaving them off during his flight, to
avoid detection, were glaringly perceptible. Each week, however,
since his ex-Majesty's fºr the artists have been º augment-
ing the quantity of whisker in their portraits, and we shall soon have
Louis PHILIPPE's favoris restored to their old exuberance.
The artists, it is true, are dealing somewhat harshly with their sub-
ject, and are giving whiskers with an exuberance that Nature, who never
lays it on too thick, would repudiate; and we advise a more cautious
application of the artistical macassar, if probability is not to be entirely
set at defiance in the series of scenes of “Louis-Philippe at Breakfast,
“Louis-PHILIPPE after Breakfast,” “Louis-PHILIPPE taking a Walk,”
“Louis-PHILIPPE coming home from a Walk,” and other subjects of the
same interesting and exciting nature, that every week adorn the pages
of the pictorial journals. |
—
A HARD BLOW.
SIR GEORGE GREY said, in the debate on the Game Laws,
“He thought the majority of the House would agree with him in condemning the
modern system of battues (hear, hear), which was followed not for sport, not by country
gentlemen in their country pursuits (hear, hear), in which their tenants were able to join,
but for the sake of the enormous amount of game killed being inserted in the newspapers.
(Hear.) It was a practice utterly unworthy of English gentlemen (hear), and might
be considered as one of the sources of those numerous crimes which were attributed to
the Game Laws.”
This is strong language; but every word of it perfectly just. We
recollect, however, that PRINCE ALBERT is a great advocate and promoter
of all battues. His amount of game killed, too, is invariably inserted in
the newspapers. Now SIR. GeoRGE GREY says, that the practice is
utterly unworthy of an English gentleman., Gracious goodness! What
are we to infer? But the inference is too horrible to be seriously enter-
tained, and so we will dismiss it with the simple request that SIR GEORGE
will not sacrifice our loyal feelings again to the base purposes of truth.
We must really forego the pleasure of reading the jº. if we are to
be pained in this distressing way.
Making Game.
A Foolish accident has prolonged the existence of the Game Laws
another twelvemonth. They have been saved in consequence of a
“dropped order.” What that is, we do not pretend to say; but it must be
something very funny, for all the Members laughed. Now, we enjoy a
joke as much as anybody, but it strikes us that legislation is not exactly
the thing to make fun ºf "if it is merely a joke, then we contend that
we have a greater right to sit in the House than anybody yet returned,
with one or two exceptions. If it is not a farce, then, it seems strange
to us why the throwing out of a most important Bill should provoke
such general merriment. What is game to you, landed gentlemen, is
death to others. Farmers, you must not complain of the reduction of
your crops, for your representatives must have their joke, though it is
at your expense. The º: and pheasants still enjoy the Govern-
ment license to eat where they please. The game of landlord has
been won by a single trick. Tenants, you must pay the stakes, and
and hope for better luck, if not fairer play, next year.
New French Chambers.
At the last sitting of the Club of the Oratorical Institution at Paris,
a certain Citizen, says the Times–
“Demanded the reign of holy fraternity, and proposed the nomination by election, of
two Chambers, of which one should represent “Talent,’ and the other ‘Virtue.” -
All success to the demand for the reign of fratermity, and for
Chamber of Talent and Virºl' we wish the Parisians could take a
set of chambers for such occupants, and fill them. We only hope there
will be no demand for the Reign of Terror, and the consequent institu-
tion of another “Chamber of Horrors.”
Printers' Cannon.
WE understand, from our own correspondent at Vienna, that the
EMPEROR FERDIN AND is really so much in earnest in his new love for the
freedom of thought, that he has given all the cannon that were shotted
to fire upon the people, to be made into printing-presses. This is truly
the most humane mode of turning the guns of the enemy upon himself.

LED BY THE “NOES.”
THE business of the House of Commons was interrupted one night
last week, in consequence of the illness of the Speaker. We are not
finding fault with the RIGHT Honour ABLE SIR CHARLEs SHAw LEFevre
because he dared to be unwell. No man is proof against colds, espe-
cially in a house ventilated by DR. REID. We only think that remedies
should always be at hand for such casualties. In a theatre, when the
first tragedian or the prima donna is seized with sore throat, or chil-
blains, or the sudden loss of salary or voice, a substitute is invariably
put into his or her part. Why could not the same plan be tried in
the House of Commons? Why not have a sub-Speaker, who is #.
engaged to play second during the session, as often as a cold in the head
of his superior, or any other accident, calls upon him to display his
talents? At all events there should be some one to apologize for the ill-
ness of the Speaker; or notices might be exhibited outside, to the fol-
lowing effect:-
THEATRE ROYAL, S.T. STEPHEN'S.
. The Ministers regret to state, that in consequence of the sudden
indisposition of
THE SPEAKER,
the performances,advertised for this evening cannot possibly take place.
Tºmorrow will be repeated the laughable farce of “The Income-
AX. (Signed) Russell.
A medical certificate, signed by MR. WAKLEY, might accompany this,
and so would save the unpleasant necessity of the Speaker attending
when too unwell, and suffering publicly in order to attract the notice
ºf some sympathising Member to make the necessary adjournment
before his presence can be excused. We might suggest a pan of hot
water and afriendly basin of water-gruel, with napkins round the head,
if the big wig was not found sufficiently warm; but these homely
remedies might provoke the well-known gravity of the House, and
besides, it might be rather difficult to catch the Speaker's eye when
buried under a thick woollen comforter. However, a Sub, or some easy
remedy, should be thought of, as the Influenza, or a civic dinner, or
the north-east wind, or any of the thousand ills that English flesh is
heir to, might deprive us for several weeks, and perhaps a whole session,
of the services of the Speaker, and then what would become of the
public business? Why, Ministers would not be able to practise the

bitant sinecures of such persons as Lord ELLENBorough himself. We

OUR ROYAL CORRESPONDENCE.
We are overwhelmed from all parts of the Continent with letters
from our royal acquaintance. It is remarkable that, though they all
come free, the writers seem to avoid the use of the royal Head on the
outside, as disagreeably suggestive. We have received so many of
these “Epistole obscurorumvirorum” from little German potentates
whose names have hitherto been entirely, unknown to, us, that we
think seriously of opening a bureau of royal agency, for the purpose of
clearing reduced sovereigns through the Custom House, as MESSRs.
MCRACKEN and CHINNERY do with foreign works of art and vertu.
All these sovereigns, without any exception, write in the highest spirits
of the reforms going on in their States; but we are rather at a loss to
reconcile the tone of their letters with the hints and commissions in
their postscripts. Perhaps, from the subjoined specimens, our readers
may be able to solve this apparent contradiction for themselves.

From His Royal HIGHNEss FREDERIC-WILLIAM-Louis, Prince of

I may give my dear little coz the agreeable surprise
WEAK-MINDED persons are alarmed about the EMPEROR OF RUSSIA.
They are afraid lest he should put himself at the head of his Cossacks,
and sweep away every vestige of civilisation from the surface of Europe.
Strong-minded persons (ourselves included) only laugh at these fears.
We know that the Emperor loves a million as much as anybody; and
does he not possess millions in our Funds, and millions in the French
Funds? All these are liable to the fickle changes of the Stock-Exchange.
In the event of a war, they would tumble so low, that, probably, they
would scarcely be worth the picking up. No; Nicholas has bound
himself down to keep the peace in the heaviest sureties. War is a
game at which there is everything to lose, and nothing to gain. Depend
upon it, the best securities for peace are Government Securities.
“A Magnificent Patriot.”
A SUNDAY Paper applies this title to tyrannous old METTERNICH.
Now his patriotism, if not magnificent, was wonderfully ingenious. For
he contrived to evade the payment of taxes for his domain of Johan-
misberg for thirty-three years. . As he is such a hand at defeating the
Exchequer, he might in England, make a tolerable sum by delivering
a course of lectures—"on the Easion of the Income-Tar.”
Proper Dignity.
THE Regent's Park Zoological Professors have dropt their admission
from one shilling to sixpence. As soon as the Elephant heard that he
was to be shown at half-price,—with a dignity worthy of even an
eminent tragedian—he resolved to show himself only in profile.

AMERICAN PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY.
IN THE House OF REPRESENTATIVEs.
MR. Jones, of Tenessee, in a few brief observations, accused
MR. HARALson, of Georgia, of inconsistency.
MR. HARALsoN replied by a well-directed compliment addressed to
the Hon. Member's frontispiece.
MR. Jones retorted by an effective smasher, which told on MR. HA-
RALsoN’s proboscis. - -
MR. HARALson then let out with his right, but was º by
MR. Jones with his left; who planted an ugly counter on MR. HA-
RALSON's potato-trap. Some scientific parrying then ensued between
the Hon. Members. At length MR. HARALson, having got MR. Jones
into chancery, convinced him that, whether he was inconsistent or not,
he was well up to fibbing. -
The House here, #ing that the mill had lasted long enough, cried
“Time!” and the discussion between the Hon. Members terminated.
Tºur then resolved itself into a general set-to on the order of
6 day.
A BRUMMAGEM BYRON.
A GENTIEMAN having caught a glance at himself in a glass, with his
collar turned down, was immediately struck with his extraordinary
likeness to BYRON. He went to bed full of the idea, and rose in the
morning confirmed in the notion that he was the son-(who was his
mother he cared not to inquire about) of Childe Harold. He would
immediately, ". the strength of this relationship, publish the frag-
ments of his ſamented father; with letters, washing-bills, and every
thing that could illustrate the poet's history. However, the bookseller
discovers the Brummagem BYRON, and washes his hands of the unfor:
tunate acquaintance.
We are glad of this. . Otherwise, we should have had the great,
eat, great grandson of MILTON.—who was J. married to a
aughter of OLIVER CROMwell-publishing half-a-dozen new books of
Paradise Lost, besides a second part of Comus. BEN Jonson would
have been represented in the boy (now an aged man) of the NELSON
Column; and BEAUMONT and FLETCHER come backtous from America,
by the Siamese Twins.

pedestal.
A WORD WITH LOUIS BLANC.
CITIZEN BLANC, a word with you on the Organisation of Literary
Labour. Open your book; there Citizen; at page 222 it reads thus,
according to our English:-
“Literature has on society the right of a command. Now, what becomes of this right,
when the man of letters descends to exercise his genius as a trade—if he only writes books
to amass capital? To become subservient to the taste of the public, to flatter its
prejudices, to feed its ignorance, to compromise its errors, todally with its worst passions;
in a word, to write everything that may be hurtful, so that it is agreeable? Such is the
necessary condition of whomsoever exchanges his genius for money.”
Thus, Citizen, it is only wise and virtuous books that are made gratis.
Literature, like love, to be really pure, must not be bought. A man
who exercises his literary genius must prostitute it, if he sell his manu-
script to a publisher. Truly, Citizen, these are bitter conclusions. But
let us continue.
“What,” you ask, “in exchange for the gold I offer you, will you make me ashamed of
my stupidity ? Will you curb my egotism—will you disturb me in the enjoyment
of the fruit of my rapine—will you make me tremble for the future? Your wisdom, Sir,
will cost you a little too dear. I’ll none of it. Thus, thought loses its character of
teaching, and with it all moral authority. The writer who depends upon the favour of
the public loses the faculty of guiding it; he loses even the desire to do so. He is a
king who abdicates.”
From this, Citizen, we must conclude that every book hitherto
written for money is a piece of flattery and corruption. BoILEAU was
a public mischief, and Tartuffe, for which we fear MoLIERE took hard
louis-dºors, a miserable time-serving comedy. In a word, every paid
author is an enemy to the true nobility of human nature—a Swiss, who
lets out a pen instead of a pike.
“I could cenceive,” says CITIZEN BLANc, “that a law should be made to abolish, as a
trade, the condition of the man of letters; but to make a law to render this trade more
lucrative, and to encourage the manufacturers of literature, this appears to me utterly
insensate.”
Thus, if CITIZEN BIANC hold to his opinions of 1839, we may expect
no law of international copyright from the Republic. Let M. GALIGNANI
rejoice; and let his Bibliothèque in the Rue Vivienne still remain the
greatest literary “fence” in Europe.
CITIZEN BLANC would make literature the exercise of over hours.
He would have the author learn some handicraft whereby to obtain his
daily bread; and, the daily work over, he might then sit down to his
fºolscap, a pure and unsuspected teacher of the people, because teaching
them for nothing. Of course, Citizen, what applies to literature, also
applies to the arts that appeal to the higher nature of man. The
sculptor who takes money for his statues, chisels marble into vilest and
lºst sensual forms, to the defilement and degradation of the world.
he painter &: nothing but lust and gluttony—because he paints for
lº ITIZEN BLANC would alter this; somehow, no doubt, after
Slashion.
Let the author work—let us say—at a paper-mill his eight or ten
Sº a day. This may average him about thirty shillings a week. Self
and family frugally provided for, there will then remain money sufficient
for pens, ink, and º: and, as for time, at least four hours of the
might for gratuitous ſiterary composition.
The sculptor may also employ himself with some trade-qui subvienne
à ses besoins. Human vanity will never be without tombstones. There-
fore, let MICHAEL ANGELo work his ten hours in a stone-cutter's yard,
and lay out the rest of his time on JuPITERs and JUNOs. -
When RAPHAEL has returned from his daily work as an industrious
house-painter, he may then resume his palette, and at over hours pro-
ceed with the “Transfiguration.”
CITIZEN BLANC has an earnest, and we believe an honest, soul. But
with all its earnestness, all its honesty—verily hath it not crotchets?
PUNCH'S MAXIMS MORALISED.
25.-Evil communications corrupt good manners.
THIs accounts for the occasional rudeness and want of manners shown
by the editors of newspapers, who naturally get an amount of evil com-
munications that must try the politeness, as well as the patience, of the
best bred and the best tempered man in the world.
26.-Evil gotten evil spent.
Some people say that the crown. LQUIS-PHILIPPE has just made such
a bad use of, brought him ill luck in the end, because it was not quite
honestly obtained.
27.-Experience is the mother of Science.
Perhaps so; but Science, like many other children, will often despise
the maternal counsel, and go on in error to the end.
28.-Experience teaches fools.
Then Experience may say to every human being." You have been, or
will be, my pupil at some time of your life.”
29.-Fools make feasts and wise men eat them.
This accounts for the paucity of brains that has been observed among
some of the most hospitable of the Lord Mayors of London in the
olden time. The quantity of civic foolery used formerly to require the
assistance of an official fool, but, latterly the Lord Mayor has found
himself quite equal to the entire duty, which, to do him justice, is not
so heavy as it used to be.

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MR. BRIEFLESS.
CHAPTER THE NINTh.
Mr. BRIEFLESS TRIES TO SUIT HIMSELF WITH A CLERK.
Having now taken chambers all to myself, I was not only monarch of all I surveyed, but
monarch of all that had been surveyed for me, by a regular surveyor, in the shape of fixtures
taken at a valuation, and consisting of a book-case and a brown-holland blind. As I gazed at
the great shelving º: formed by the book-shelves, my imagination turned them into
the steps in the great ladder of professional eminence, and my fancy amused itself like a young
kitten, by leaping from one shelf to the other, as if they had been º in my future career,
and now and then holding on, like a matured.cat, to those posts into which everyone is strug-
gling to stick his claws. Now and then, the image of feline buoyancy and tenacity would take
me to the summit of the book-case—a position not to be obtained without a good deal of
scratching and tearing—when on a sudden the ideal talons would be unable to make good
their position, and down would come my mental grimalkin with a smash that threatened to
sacrifice one or two at least of its nine lives. These reflections were interrupted by the arrival
of the artist appointed to carry out the beautiful conception of SHAkspeaRE, by giving to
my “local habitation” the addition of “a name.”
The poet of all time knew thoroughly well that a business domicile without a door-plate
was likely to lead to results as unsubstantial as the “baseless fabric of a vision,” whose tenant
too often, “leaves not a rap behind,” excepting perhaps those useless posthumous raps—if I
may be allowed the expression—which his creditors, bring to the door after the abandonment
of the premises. I may perhaps betold that this is º but is not almost everything of
interest and importance a digression after all? The French Revolutions—all three of them—
have been digressions from the ordinary course; SIR. Robert PEEL's most valuable pieces of
statesmanship have been digressions from his customary career, and it is habitually said of
anything poor and contemptible, “Oh! it is nothing out of the way.” When, therefore, my
genius seems disposed to take a short cut, I am, often inclined to encourage it to a more
rambling and desultory movement, which has occasionally led it into a number of odd turnings,
and not unfrequently into a cul de sac, but some of these byways have proved the most
interesting, as well as the most profitable part of my intellectual pilgrimage.
I must, however, check for the present this rambling propensity; for I find myself suddenly
surrounded and beset, by a parcel of boys of every age and of every style of British costume,
who have been collected by an advertisement I caused to be inserted in the paper for a clerk.
They were told to apply between one and two, but they were between º and fifty at least,
i. life and juvenility to the whole staircase by the playful gambols in which they indulged.
eap-frog was rampant in the passages; while marbles and peg-top made up with conversation
the occupation of the pavement at the bottom of the stairs. The candidates for my clerkship
had given to the Court in which my chambers were situated, the aspect of a fair, and the whole
§
of the legal porterage were in arms—wearing their canes and their tickets—to stand by their
own order, and preserve the order of the Temple. An attempt was made at one time to get
them to fraternise; but with that loyal and constitutional feeling which has established a sort
of miniature bulwark immediately under the pewter badge worn on every breast, they to a man
gaminerie did not attempt to depose the chief
porter, cause the evacuation of the pump on to
the heads of the ticketed classes, insist on the
dismissal of all the clerks throughout the Temple,
go to the Treasurer's office for ſº a day
for doing nothing, and perform the rest of the
fashionable feats that liberty, equality, and fra-
termity, appear, according to the Parisian version
of them, to require.
It would be uninteresting to describe my nu.
merous interviews with the miscellaneous candi-
dates, for the single, and not very profitable
sº I had to bestow. Some of them to
whom º: osed the “half-crowns” by way of
salary, and who knew something of the probable
º of this mode of remuneration, asked me
itterly whether I wanted “to starve a cove?”
whereupon, not wishing to have that ponderous
burden, a “starved gove,” upon my conscience, I
closed with an urchin, not yet in his teens–
except his trowsers, which were velveteens—for
four shillings a week, and the usual clerical per-
quisites.
I, was surprised to find, by the offers of the
*::::::::: the very miscellaneous uses to which
a barrister's clerk could be applied. Some had
been accustomed to look after horses, as well
as asses-I mean clients—and some twenty or
thirty had no objection to undertaking the care of
a cat. The great Fº were wi to clean
my boots—in this Ishould have met them half
way, for Iwore highlows—and two or three had
a little, carpet-beating and new-laid egg connec-
tion, which they hoped their arrangements with
me would not render it necessary to disturb.
One drove a cab three days a week, and was
willing to give me the benefit of his clerkship
on the alternate days, with an undertaking not
to wear corduroy breeches at chambers; and
one juvenile who had been accustomed to dealin
congreve matches, thought that his connection
with the brimstone trade, and his dealings with
Lucifer, would be considered to have qualified
him for introduction to the law.
Having selected my future clerk, and dis-
missed the disappointed crowd with a few
sentences of judicious, clap-trap, in which I told
them that under our glorious Constitution every
one of them might sit upon the woolsack if he
could only get there, and asked them if they
ever knew a labourer mount a ladder, except by
beginning at the lowest round; they gave me
three rounds of cheering, and left me, like the
Vauxhall Hermit, alone—alone—alone! -
“The Woice of Woman.”
La Voir, des Femmes is one of the hundred
new journals published in Paris since the Revo-
lution. It is popular, the Woice ºf Woman being,
of course, heard all over the capital. We see in
it that one of the rules of the Ladies' Club—the
ladies who conduct the paper—is, “That no lady
shall speak longer than a quarter of an hour.”
There are some elderly women in the House of
Commons who might follow this excellent ex-
ample. A quarter of an hour only! Was there
ever such self-denial *
The Best Prosecution for the Irish
Agitators.
THE best prosecution after all for the Hibernian
CATILINEs, would be an unanimous resolution of
the Press not to notice them. When they found
that not a word of their sedition was reported,
they would very quickly hold their tongues. The
most cruel punishment for an Agitator is silent
contempt. It is more effectual than all the fines
and imprisonments, and saves a wonderful deal of
refused to surrender their allegiance. Happily there was no occasion for a collision. The
dangerous martyrdom.

OUR FOREIGN EXPRESSES.
s INCE the last few weeks, the news from abroad
7 has poured upon us so rapidly, that we cannot sit
quietly down for half-an-hour without being dis-
turbed by the intelligence of some fresh Revo-
lution. Our paulo-post-meridian chop is scarcely
placed before us when a knock comes to our door,
and “our boy” runs wildly in with the announce-
ment, “Please Sir, here’s the telegraphic despatch
just come with another Revolution; ” and that is
hardly registered in our mind ere we are broken
in upon once more with the intimation that, “a man is waiting outside
with another Republic, and wants to know whether he shall leave it, and
call again.” To deal with all these commotions is more than we can
accomplish, and we have for some time past ordered all the bond fide
Revolutions to be put upon our file; but the Irish shindies are to be
thrown at once into our waste-paper basket without the advantage of
a stop in transitu, to ascertain what they may be worth. We had
very *: pitched the whole of Lombardy to the dustmen, and thrown
Naples into the hands of the buttermen by another sweeping arrange-
ment; but the accumulation of Revolutions is really so rapid, that
we have no time to attend to them all. We have, however, been
i. by one of more interest than the majority of the others, in the
pe OI a
REVOLUTION IN THE CANNIBAL. ISLANDS.
(By Ertra-ertra-ordinary Express.)
Intelligence has just reached us, by special barge from Blackfriars
Coal:Wharf, that the Cannibal Islands have deposed their king, and |t
that a Republic has been declared. His Majesty, who was closeted with
HoKI when the rising commenced, immediately sent for Poki, who
promised to stir up what few embers of loyalty still remained among
the people. , WHANKI, who had the command of the forces, was
believed to be staunch, but at the last moment he received such intel:
ligence from FUM as induced him to fratermise with the insurgents; and
the king, having got a few beads and feathers together, flew towards
the frontier. WHosky PhosKY addressed the crowd from the window
of his wigwam, and he, with WHANKEY, and Twan KEY, were unani-
mously chosen to act as a Provisional,Government. A decree has
already been issued, promising to afford the blessings of Cannibalism to
any nation that will accept them willingly, and to force the said bless-
ings upon any people by whom they are ignorantly and maliciously
declined.º:
Freedom is declared to be established, and, to secure its interests, the
great principle has been enunciated that everybody has a right to do
what he likes with everybody else's own. Alarm is deprecated as
dangerous to the Republic of Cannibalism, and every one who exhibits
any symptom of terror, is to be at once killed, in order to calm his
apprehensions, and prove to him that he had nothing to fear.
& Such is the progress of the Cannibal Islands Revolution, according
to the latest advices we have received.
“The Queen's Royal Body-Guard.”
THE Gentlemen-at-Arms—so many of them being hitherto Gentlemen-
at-Counters, are to be purified of the shop and called as above. The
Post tells us that “no person is allowed to enter this corps*—(the
service of the corps is tantamount to that of footmen, with the
privilege of staring at Majesty)—“who is in any way connected with
trading or mercantile pursuits.” Hence, the MARQUIs or LoNDoN-
DERRY as a coal-whipper, is not eligible; neither is the EARL of
JERSEY as indirectly “connected” with CHILD’s banking-house.
Indeed, when we consider the matter a little, trade and commerce
º; so very low, that we hope to see the day when they shall be
abolished throughout the empire. . What does England want with
a ledger? Has she not the Red Book?
TO CROWNED HEADS IN GENERAL AND SMALL GERMAN ONES IN
PARTICULAr.
THE new Company, advertised as the “Sovereign Assurance Com-
pany,” having been overwhelmed with applications from France, Italy,
Prussia, Austria, and the German Confederation in general, beg to state,
for the information of Continental Sovereigns, that no Insurances can be
ºffected with, individuals answering to the above description. The
Sovereign Assurance Company” is strictly a commercial body, and
does not take political risks.
HOW TO DISPOSE OF YOUR SYMPATHISERS.
The Provisional Government en Séance.
M. de Lamartine. Messieurs, a deputation of Poles waits to express
sympathy, and to demand arms, provisions, and money.
Ledru-Rollin. Messieurs, a deputation of brave Belgians waits for the
same noble purpose.
Louis Blanc. Messieurs, twelve deputations of Prussians, Austrians,
Hungarians, Bohemians, and natives of various German principalities,
whose names, I º to say, have escaped me, wait with the same
eager sympathies, the same modest i.
F. Flocom. Messieurs, six deputations of Italian refugees wait, in
F. the same attitude as their Polish, Belgian, and German
rothers.
All the Provisional Government. What is to be done? Diable! .
M. de Lamartine. Messieurs, let us return their sympathy with
interest.
All. Bravo! Admit the deputations.
Enter the Deputations. "
M. de Lamartine. Messieurs, the Provisional Government accepts its
mission. Messieurs, we are all brothers. Messieurs, the Provisional
Government accepts your generous, your noble offer. Messieurs, the
Provisional Government is profoundly moved. Go, Messieurs, and f
the dictates of your sacred enthusiasm.
The Deputations. But the arms ?
M. de Lamartine. The Provisional Government gives you its sympathy.
The Deputations. But the Provisions? -
. M. de Lamartine. The Provisional Government gives you its admira-
lon.
The Deputations. But the money?
M. de Lamartine. The Provisional Government gives you its blessing,
and tickets for the railway trains about to start to your respective
frontiers. [The Deputations look slightly sold.
* M. de Lamartine (with great errºº respective countries
call for you. Adieu ! foreign brethren.
[Ereunt the Deputations grumbling.
M. de Lamartine. Messieurs, France has lost several battalions of
patriots, but Poland, Belgium, Austria, Prussia, and Italy have gained
them! Once arrived, the struggle is theirs.
[The Provisional Government look considerably relieved.
FISHING EXTRAORDINARY.
[By our own Penny-a-liner.]
As the season is now approaching
or enormous gooseberries, of
which a glut may be expected
and as these will be succeeded
by the colossal cabagges, and fol-
lowed in due course by a series
of late raspberries, inconsequence
of, some unlooked-for autumnal
mildness in some suburban gar-
den, we feel that there will be no
opening for fish, and such other
small fry, for a very considerable
period. The Folkstone Whale
came only just in time to get pa-
ragraphed; but we have on hand
a specimen of the finny tribe,
with reference to whom the motto
must be, “Now or never!” and as
we have º our penny-a-liner in
advance for it, we are determined
to bring it in.
“The other day an Irishman
of the name of MITCHELL was
hing among the gudgeons and
flat fish that are so plentiful in
his native country, and was going
to considerable lengths with his
own peculiar line, when all of a
- - sudden he caught—with a hook—
a most Extraordinary Pike! According to MR. MITCHELL's statement it
measured nine feet in length, and had a head of massive iron; but upon
a careful examination of the pike it was found not to have anything
like the weight that MR. MitchELL supposed.”

Of a fine young Irish gentleman whose Paper’s his estate,
And who writes and chatters treason at a most enormous rate,
From love of notoriety, sensation to create, -
e a fine young Irish gentleman—one of the present time.
His talk, so empty otherwise, is full of pikes and guns;
With yells for blood and massacre the people's ear he stuns;
He preaches war—but danger since the brawler always shuns,
If ever matters come to blows, depend on it he runs, -
Like a fine young Irish gentleman—one of the present time.
When Famine's hand oppress'd his land, we freely gave our store—
Although ourselves in grievous want—to save the starving poor;

Those hearts his fellow-countrymen he calls upon to gore, .
Like a fine young Irish gentleman—one of the present time.
And thus his curship howling in Confederation Hall,
Kept on defying constantly the arm of Law to fall,
Enraged that Government would take no note of him at all,
Because, though great the wickedness, the consequence was small
Of this fine young Irish gentleman—one of the present time.
At length, as when a puppy will in yelping persevere,
Since, though we reck not of his bite, É. bark annoys our ear,
And so we kick him: thus the Crown resolved to interfere,
And for sedition to indict this puny mutineer, -
Oh! this fine young Irish gentleman—one of the present time.
The Law, though late, asserts itself, no more to be defied:
This fine young Irish gentleman and friends are to be tried;
And, would some wholesome statute there existed to provide
A treadmill for the exercise, and a trimming for the hide

His Majesty visited the garden of the Luxembourg, in
which he planted a tree of liberty. The tree was decorated
- by the hand of His Majesty with flags, flowers, and bows of
- ribbon. The clergy of St. Sulpice were present. The curé
and vicaire assisted at the interesting ceremony, by pronouncing
an oration and a benediction, after which His Majesty danced
round the tree, and let off a number of muskets and crackers.
His Majesty subsequently visited the principal quays, and
other º: in which he planted more trees of liberty
trimmed with ribbons. On each occasion the clergy in the
neighbourhood were in attendance, and one of , their body
delivered an impressive discourse, the sermon being again
followed by a dance and a display of fireworks.
In the evening, His Majesty was graciously pleased to com-
mand all º: whose houses adjoined the trees of liberty
which he had º: to illuminate, himself setting them his
i. example, by lighting pitch fires in the principal thorough-
ares. -
Towards midnight, His Majesty thought proper to amuse
himself by dragging a bust of his predecessor, Louis-PHILIPPE,
round the neck of which was tied a label, with “A la lanterne”
written upon it, about the streets. -
His Majesty continues in the enjoyment of excellent health,

There will be a
Cºl.
The Ambassa-
-- - - - - dors of the foreign
Powers will bring their suites and their splendours to the Court of the
Republic...The nobility will flock back in crowds to our deserted squares.
Irish poplin will rise in price to ten shillings a yard, so vast will be the
demand for that web by the ladies of our city. . Irish diamonds will
reach the price of the inferior Golconda article. Irish linen and shirtings
will rise immensely. Indeed, all Irish produce, not being depreciated by
the ruinous competition for gold, will augment in value.
Debt at home, and absenteeism, have been the curses of our country.
Henceforth there shall be no absenteeism, and no debt.
. He who refuses to live amongst us is not of us—the soil is for the
inhabitants of the soil.
I have already, my dear friends, instructed you in the manner in
which every one of you may get a cheap and handsome property for
himself, viz., by holding possession of that which you at present occupy.
For, as every man has an indefeasible right to subsistence, and as Nature
Fº for the good of all, it is manifestly right that the many should
ye the possession, and not the few.
If a landlord should object to this ºr. (who is but a mere
accident on the face of the earth), for the love of God, boys, get rifles
and blow his brains out. It is much better that a few landlords should
É. and their families (who have been ºf on the fat of the land
itherto, and may therefore take a turn of ilſ fortune) should starve,
than that multitudes should die of want:
...And thus the curse of quarter-day will be removed at once from this
island: and after a very little necessary slaughter. For depend upon it,
that when two or three landlords have been served in the way recom-
mended by me, the rest will not care to be pressing for rents. The
butchers who govern us instituted the system of hanging for this very
reason: arguing, that one example before Kilmainham deterred numbers
of waverers; and we may be sure that the rifle, rightly employed, will
act upon an º as well as upon a housebreaker; for, are not
men men, whether clad in Saxon ermine, or in the rude frieze-coats of
Our ºble fatherland? Out with your rifles, boys, in the name of
umanity.
They say that the property of Ireland is mortgaged in a great degree,
and for the most part to the brutal Saxon shopkeepers, and j.
Yºu will have the advantage of getting your land entirely free; there
e no manacle of debt to weigh down the free arms which are
henceforth to till the beloved soil of our country.
And, the land, being unencumbered, you will have the farther advan:
tage of being able to invite capitalists to aid you with money to conduct
the operations of agriculture. Glorious America, which sympathises
with you sincerely, will be much more ready to lend its †. upon
§nencumbered, than on encumbered º: And we shall negotiate
loans in her magnificent commercial cities, where I have no doubt there
will be a noble emulation to come to the aid of a free Irish nation,
The idea of sending cattle and pigs to England, to feed Saxon
ruffians, is then to be scouted henceforth by all honest Irishmen. We will
Consume our own beef and pork by our own firesides. There is enough
live-stock in this island to give every regenerate Irishman good meals
of meat for the next year ensuing; and our lands, notoriously the
greenest and most fertile in the world, will have fed up a similar
UR troops *...*

quantity by the year 1850. Thus, we shall never want henceforth; and,
while we fatten and flourish, we shall see the Saxon enemy decay.
And, as the beef-fed scoundrels cannot live º cotton and hardware,
we shall have the satisfaction of reducing the prices of those com-
modities, and getting them at a much more reasonable rate than that at
which the accursed money-mongers now vend them.
FROM THE “ UNITED IRISHWOMAN.”
THE DUTIES OF OUR WOMEN.
In the coming time the weapon nearest at handis always the cheapest.
Only dilettant go about picking and choosing. Shillyshallyers are
cowards. Brave men are always armed. -
Brave men and brave women, a few suggestions to housekeepers we
have already given; we could supply thousands more. . . .
There is no better weapon, for instance, than one which is to be found
in every house in the refined quarter of the metropolis. A grand piano
sent down upon a troop of hussars will play such a sonata over their
heads as the scoundrels never marched off to. . A chimney-glass is a
rare thing for smashing. I should not like to be the Saxon assassin
upon whom some white-armed girl of Erin flung it.
Pokers and tongs everybody will know the use of. A cut-steel fender
is an awkward thing for a dragoon to ride over. A guardsman won't
look well with a copper coal-scuttle for a helmet. - - - -
Ladies' linen Jäf make the best of lint. A laced handkerchief tied
round a wounded warrior's brow will be well bestowed. I have seen a
servant in college knocked down by a glossy boot, ever so slight, of
yarnished leather ; if a footman, why not a private soldier?, Have at
him, ladies, from the bedroom windows. Your husbands will be away
yonder at the barricades. - -
A hot saddle of mutton, flung by cook into the face of a bawling
Saxon Colonel, will silence him; send the dish-cover with it; or at
tea time try him with the silver tea-urn. Qur wife has one. She longs
for an opportunity to fling it, heater and all, into a Saxon face. .
Besides the bottle-rack, the use of which and its contents are evident,
your husband will leave the keys of the cellar with you, and you know
what to do. Old port makes excellent grape-shot; and I don't know
any better use which you can make of a magnum of Latouche, than to
floor an Englishman with it. Have at them with all the glasses in
your house, the china, the decanters, the lamps, and the cut-glass
chandelier. - - - - -
... A good º cheese would be found rather indigestible, by a Saxon,
if dropped on his nose from a second story. ...And the childrens' wash-
ing tub artfully administered may do execution. Recollect, it is a tub
to catch a whale. -
There is a lady in Leeson Street who vows to fling her. Angola cat
and her pet spaniel at the military while, engaged there. The cat may
escape, (and it is not the first time the Saxon ruffians have tasted its
claws). The Blenheim cost her twenty-five guineas. She will give
that or anything else for her country; .
The water-pipes will be excellent things to tear up and launch at the
enemy. They may make a slop in the house at first, but the mains and
the gas will be let off. The ruffians shall fight us if they dare, in dark-
ness and drought.
You will of course empty the china-closets on the rascals, and all the
bed-room foot-baths and washing-basins. , Have them ready, and the
i.º: drawers balancing on the window-sills. Send those after
them too.
And if any coward Saxon bullet pierces the fair bosom of a maid or a
wife of Erin, may the curses of Heaven light on the butcherly dastard!
May the pikes of Erin quiver in his Nº. the bullets of Erin
whirl through his screaming eyeballs! Mayhis orphans perish howling,
and his true love laugh over his grave! y his sister's fair fame
blighted, and his grandmother held up to scorn! May remorse fang
him like a ban-dog, and cowardice whip him like, a slave!, May life
weary him death dishonour, and futurity punish him Liar Saxon!
ruffian Saxon! coward Saxon! bloody Saxon! The gentle and the
pure defy ye, and spit on yel
A Bit of True Philosophy.
How beautiful is the saying that “we should always hope for the
best, and be prepared for the worst l” For our own parts we, never
enter a grocer's to get our weekly ounce and a half of seven shilling
mixed tea without being animated by the advice of the moralist, who
tells us to “hope for the best, and be prepared for the worst.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE STUPID ART OF PROPHESYING.
HERE is nothing so easy, probably, excepting bor-
rowing money, as prophesying. A child may do it.
You have only to be as vague as possible, and to
steer clear of dates—excepting on a very liberal scale
—and your prophecies are sure to come true. A
prophecy, to be true, however, need not all of it be
realised. If a part, a tenth, or ever so small a frag-
ment of it happens, by the game of chances to turn
.# a trump *: are a recognised prophet, and
allowed to deal in prophecies for ever afterwards.
The best way is to make a number of prophecies at
the same time. If one out of a thousand be correct
the nine hundred and ninety-nine bad ones are all
forgotten, and the thousandth good one only remem-
bered. Still, a little probability should be at the
bottom of every prophecy. Thus, to º a
Revolution in France, or that it will rain at Man-
chester to-morrow, or that the next Art-Union engraving will not be
a good one, are remarkably safe prophecies. With the above license,
anybody can start as a prophet, and, in the teeth of the old proverb,
even be acknowledged as one in his own country. . We subjoin a
list of prophecies, for the use of those who have a talent that way.
The dates, of course, can be supplied according to the taste of the
particular prophet.
“Something very wonderful, of more than an usual interest, will
occur †† first month of the National Assembly.
“Several Irishmen will be taken up on St. Patrick's day, and fined
five shillings.”
“There will be a high tide at London Bridge in the ensuing twelve-
month, which will surpass the recollection of the oldest waterman.” . .
“We have consulted the stars, and can fearlessly state that the divi-
dend of the shareholders of the Thames Tunnel will be this year exactly

THE “TREE OF LIBERTY.”
We are glad to find there is at last some abatement of the melancholy
folly of planting Trees of Liberty in Paris, with the accompanying
j of forcing every one in the neighbourhood to light up—whether
he liked it or not-in celebration of the establishment of Freedom. It is
impossible to say how many poplars—for the “Tree of Liberty” is only a
º after all—have been sacrificed to the triumph of poplar principles.
Wherever one of these members of the leafy #. is visible, it is liable
to be dragged off root and branch to some open space, and stuck up in
a hole, amidst the letting off of crackers, the firing of guns, and the
shouts of “Wive la République;” or at least such was the case until a
few days ago, when a proclamation against such mummeries was issued
by the Provisional Government. If the official prohibition should fail
of its intended effect, perhaps, the following *. from us may be
received in a proper spirit. They are suggested by the well-known
song-
WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE.
Frenchman, spare that tree,
Its roots lie very low;
You’d better let it be—
Elsewhere 'twill never grow.
Though it may nobly thrive,
If tranquil it could stay,
"Twill never keep alive
If rudely torn away.
If Freedom, newly won,
You to that tree compare,
'Tis, when all’s said and done,
A very poor affair.
Upon the soil beneath
thath no hold at all;
Stirred by the slightest breath,
Its leaves, all withered, fall.
Vitality, to-day,
Within it there may be,
It perishes when moved away—
So, Frenchman, spare that tree.
PERSONS MISSING.
THE following, persons, unless they shortly, spring up, , will be
advertised by their disconsolate parties, and handsome rewards offered
for information of their whereabouts:–
i. DISRAELI, last heard of at an election dinner in Buckingham-
sinute.

herself Lola MonTEs.
LoRD GEORGE BENTINck, formerly at the head of a party which has

affairs are no affairs of ours, we shall leave them alone in their glory, if
they have any, and let those find them out who want them.

The German Pipe of Liberty.
“AMong other things,” says the Times, “the Germanshave conquered
by Revolution, is the right of smoking in the streets.” Thus, Liberty
walks abroad in Germany not only uplifting her head and unfolding her
banner, but also smoking her pipe. The Teutonic Goddess of Freedom
should be represented in a student’s cap, with a meerschaum in her
mouth. Qur imagination glows with an ideal picture of Liberty behind
a pipe. The natural consequence of being free as the wind is the
potentiality of blowing a cloud. But as there is really much room for
reform in Germany, we hope this is merely “the beginning of the end.”

freedom commencing in smoke, but shall be sorry to behold it terminate
where it has begun.

“REGISTER I REGISTER I REGISTER I’”
HEN SIR ROBERT PEEL made
use of the above memorable words
he never meant the advice, we
are sure, to apply to tailors,
hosiers, hatters, and the whole
Directory of quacks and trades-
º cº- men. The test of merit, now-
utiºn - Sº, -- a-days, does not seem to consist
zºº – in the article itself, but in the
== __ fact of its being “registered.”
−==~~ Your shirt, must be registered;
that is indispensable, or else it
could not be a shirt. Your frock coat must go through the same ordeal,
and your hat also, or else the one would instinctively jump off your
back, and the otherindignantly fly away from your head. The same rule
applies to your boots, your flannel waistcoat, your straps, your shirt-collar
—inshort, a man, to be in the fashion at the present day, must be “regis-
tered” from the top of his wig, or the crown of his hat, down to the
very sole of his boots. Would it not be a shorter plan to start, a
General Registration. Office, at which persons so inclined might
register themselves altogether, instead of every limb of their body
being obliged, as at present, to undergo a separate registration?
By the bye, male apparel is much more subjected to this test of
excellence º female. We do not know why, unless, in dress as in
politics, ladies are not entitled to the blessings of registration. .
As yet it is confined to tradesmen, and Irish patriots, who register a
vow in the same way that, a tailor would a “wrap-rascal.” If the
mania should increase, we shall be having JENNY LIND registering her
voice, FloßA FABBRI her steps, GUSTAvus BRookE his Othello, BARQN
NATHAN his eggs, Punch his jokes, and other inimitable. specialities by
far too numerous to mention. Our cry to the commercial and artistic
world is, “Don’t Register! Don't Register' Don't Register!”
THE POLITICAL APHIS AND THE BOROUGH ROT.
(By our own SMEE.)
OUR tubers have scarcely recovered from the disease which destroyed
the food of millions, when we find the same pestilent scourge attacking
the roots of our political system. The Harwich and other Election
Committees, have proved that though the rot has departed from the
tatoes, it is now devastating the boroughs. The cause of this national
§: may be traced to the ravages of an insect, which may be called
the Aphis Senator. This creature is furnished with antennae, or feelers,
which it extends in all directions where it is capable of exercising its
corrupt influence. It has at its sides a kind of pouches or bags, which
are the instruments of its moxious agency. A few of these aphides have
one benefit; however, by this system of international robbery; for English
society will not be so absurdly caricatured on the French stage, if
French authors will only take the representations of Englishmen instead
of inventing their own. This may, in time, lead to the abolition of all
the public sales of English wives at Smithfield, which have been carried
. at the * Gàité, and Porte St. Martin, lately, to the most bar-
arous extenU.
THE AñRIAL MAIL.
We are informed that when RADETsKI occupied the gates of Milan,
and thus commanded the town, the people within kept up a corres-
ondence with the country without by means of little balloons conveying
etters. This mode of epistolary communication is so analogous to the
celebrated Long Range, that it might be described as a species of
WARNER correspondence. ... We would put it to MR. Rowland HILL
whether the notion of an ačrial mail-bag might not be adopted in this
country. . All that would be necessary would be to have the letter-bag
attached by way of car to a balloon; a link of the connecting medium
to be composed of a cartridge, which shall be exploded by a fusee cal-
culated to burn according to the distance from a given point to a given
Post-Office. On the explosion of the cartridge, the bag would drop
plump down through the office skylight, just as certainly as the WARNER
shell through the gangway of a man-of-war.
THE LAST DAYS OF LoNDON.
IN, these days of revolution, when we do not know whether Europe
stands on its head or its heels, we thought England stood pretty firm, and
that nothing would shake London but an earthquake. Fancy then, how
startled we were to read the following announcement, which has been
liberally placarded the last two weeks about the walls of the metropolis'
Ah! thought we, there will not be a quiet spot in the world shortly,
excepting in the heart of the Desert, or on the top of the North Pole.
Imagine our horror on reading the intimation of the
“FINAL REMOVAL OF LONDON BY NIGHT!”
If it frightened us, standing upright in Long Acre, with brick-and-
mortar contradictions of the fact surrounding us on every side, what
effect must it not have had upon the quiet people of the country, who
only saw it in the advertisements We can imagine the flocks of old
women who would scramble to the nearest É.i. Telegraph to
inquire into the fact. They would have horrible visions of Joinville
invading London, and towing it off in the dead of night to the Brazils,
or else the Provisional Government proving their Fraternité by making
the metropolis a faubourg of Paris, and its peaceful inhabitants citoyens
of the most civilised country in the world. We are happy to set all
these fears at rest. London remains exactly where it º ever been
been dislodged from their boroughs; but their number is inconsider- since the days of the Oldest Inhabitant; and, though they say one
able in comparison with, those that remain, infesting the Tree of the
British Constitution, and tainting the very cockles of the, heart of the
British Oak.
Good Exchange.
5THE STABLE MIND has not been heard of for months past. It has
quite broken down, or cut and run. The only thing which is now
occupying the minds of the public is the “Constable MIND.” Of the
two, we think the latter will produce the stronger staff and make the
better stand. . They are both unanimous, however, about “Protection,”
and neither of them, we think, is anxious to repeal a single duty. Their
ardour is united in upholding the Customs of their country. Every
man, it is said, has his “speciality.”. An Englishman's apparently is to
be a special constable, when the public order is attacked. The power of
duty over disciplined minds has never, been so strongly evinced as
recently, when it was a matter of difficulty to put truncheons into the
thousands of hands that were burning to grasp them.
Robbery by a Gentleman of Talent and Fortune.
THE French dramatists are beginning to retaliate on the English
translators, SCRIBE has had all his pieces borrowed—and never im-
proved in the borrowing—for the English stage, . He is now beginning
to help himself to the British Drama. His first loan has been La Nuit
de Noel, the plot of which is taken from a piece performed some six
years ago, at MADAME WESTRIs's, called § Mark's Eve. We are
astonished at this—for we should have as soon suspected Rothschi LD
of petty larceny as SCRIBE of translating; but we mention the fact to
show that the thieving is not all on this side of the Channel. ...Qne rob-
bery certainly does not justify another; still, it is a comfort to think that,
poor as our Drama is, it cannot be sovery reduced, since the first drama-

prefer visiting the copy to the original, just at present. , English
artisans may visit it in safety, as there is not a single bayonet kept on
the premises.

A HINT FOR EXETER HALL.
A week or two, and pilgrims from all parts of England will gather
at Exeter Hall. There, in their comprehensive benevolence, they
plead the cause of the heathen, and subscribe, with all their hearts and
all their pockets, for the conversion of infidels of all colours. This is,
no doubt, yeryº in its meaning; but may it not be a little
absurd in its effect For our own part, we think that Exeter Hall is a
little too *:: to search for distant wretchedness, with a telescope;
forgetting the misery that lies at its very feet. A night or two since,
MR. GLADSTONE quoted a letter from the late DB. CHALMERs to the
Bishop OF LONDon. Here it is:—
“Beware, above all things, of scattering your resources over too large a surface; if you
have 50,000 destitute people in a district, and you can send only two clergymen among
them, beware of confiding this large number ºpeople to those two clergymen. Take a
small and manageable number of the people, and give each clergyman a small district in
which i. can operate; be content with doing a little work at a time, and with doing it
properly.”
Upon this, Punch writes to the zealous of Exeter Hall:—
“Beware, above all things, of scattering your resources over the
whole globe. If you have some three or four hundred millions of the
heathen in the world, and you can only send five hundred clergymen
(with New Testaments to scatter) among them, beware of confiding
the three or four hundred millions to those five hundred clergymen.
Take Spitalfields, or, Manchester, or Sheffield, or the filthy places of
Liverpool, and give to a division of each place a clergyman; give him a
home parish in which he can operate, and not a foreign island. Be con-
tent with doing alittle at a time, and doing it properly; namely, convert
St. Giles's to true Christianity, to temperance and cleanliness, and let
Timbuctoo, for the time, take care of itself.”
And this is the advice of Punch to the pilgrims of Exeter Hall.
THE PRESENT GovePNMENT or ENGLAND.—The Special Constabulary.
CHARITY AND PIKES.
The Diabolical Instigator, better known as the United Irishman, in an
article under the head of * Our War, Department,” declares that
“there is no charitable donation, like pikes for the poor.” Certainly,
in one sense, there is no charitable donation which can be said to bear
any resemblance whatever to pikes, whether for the poor or the rich;
and thus it would seem that the United Irishnan, like the perso
whose suggestions appear to actuate that periodical, can occasionally
speak the truth. Such, however, we apprehend, is not exactly the
meaning of the organ of MR. MITCHELL. The English put food into
the stomachs of the Irish poor, which was rather charitable; but to
at pikes into their hands would be more charitable, according to our
endish contemporary. The United Irishman would have the poor
Irish pike the English people for relieving them, pierce them with steel
for having been penetrated towards themselves with compassion. Its
demoniacal axiom might have been more clearly worded thus:-"There
is no return for a charitable donation to the poor so grateful as-the
thrust of a pike.”
Better Security of the constitution.
WHEN SIR,GEORGE GREY gave notice that he should move to bring
in a Bill for the better security of the Constitution, we learn that very
many pensioners and sinecurists, ...i. enough—that the
measure was levelled at their plunder, called a private meeting of them;
selves to defeat the Bill. Buttoning their pockets, they one and all
exclaimed, “No surrender!”

culinary era of the Regency, with its petits soupers. The whole art is
indelibly impressed with the reminiscences of this period.
“Republican France cannot accept the petit plats of a Bourbon chef,

essentially an aristocrat, and could not really create out of a ducal

nineteenth century. Need I hint at the great inventor of the potage à
la Peuple, the consommé à la Communiste, the soupe Sociale—whose con-

the spread of Irish discontent?
“The Hour is come, and he is the Man. Unfortunately, England
claims, his services. Devoted to the sacred duties of the missionary,
spreading the light of his beneficial and beautiful science amongst the

how can the former prosper?

Payment for Parliament. Clearing up a Mistake.
ONE of the five points of the Charter is the payment of Members of
Parliament. We do not know that this plan may not be better than
that of Members of Parliament paying themselves, as is supposed to be,
pretty generally, the present arrangement. But how is it proposed that
they should be paid P. If at so much per annum, this would be making
no difference between the idle and industrious Members; and a LEADER
would get as much as a Joseph HUME, which would be unjust. If at
SO ...; per speech, in proportion to its length, we should have longer
speeches in Parliament than ever, which would be a bore. It is manifest
that they should be paid for doing, not for talking; and this would
amount § them by the job; in which case the job-work ought
to be considerably more creditable than what has hitherto been performed
by Honourable Members.
A New MANTLE.
M, QUERARD has written a book on literary forgeries, in which

a cloak to steal under.
“SHRUBLAND RoAD” has written us a most pathetic appeal. In one
of our late Numbers we said it was a most aqueous neighbourhood, only
fit for Ondine to pass the honeymoon in, or something to that effect.
However, “Shrubland Road” assures us we were mistaken, and we are
j for its sake to believe it. The roads about Dalston are so clean
that the purest white satin might walk up and down them for hours and
not be defiled by a single dab of mud. The paths are as dryas a captain's

the Shrubland Roads.
The Wisdom of Parliament,
THE Times, discoursing of what constitutes treason in England, and
what does not constitute it in Ireland, says:–
“In England the intention, if evidenced merely by uttering or writing what directly
tends to treason, is itself treasonable. The act of GeoRGE III., under which treason is so
construed, does not extend to Ireland.”
Here is wisdom of Parliament!. This is as if it were unlawful to
explode fire-works in any part of HER MAJESTY's dominions, except in
such parts as should be in the neighbourhood of a powder-mill.

THE Morning Post will not let Louis-PHILIPPF, CoMTE DE NEUILLY,
alone. The Count wishes to be quiet and unobserved; nevertheless,
the Post insists upon making his late Majesty walk in print, for the
curiosity and amusement of Post beholders. Post / Post/ leave the old
man to solitude and silence.
“No farther seek his merits to disclose,
Or draw his frailties from their dread abode.”
France has, weeks since, forgotten him; why should England be told
of his daily doings?, France so entirely wishes to let the ex-king lapse
into oblivion, that she treats with marked coldness the exhumation of
Robert Macaire, dug up to swindle and grimace at the Porte St. Martin.
France says—by this indifference—“We have got rid of the P.
we will not be annoyed by the resurrection of the imitator.” Eng and
affords hospitality to the exile; she can do no less. Therefore, let
England's penny-a-liners respect the solitude of a penitent old man.
“The Count and Countess of NEUILLY, with the members of their family circle,
remain in the strictest retirement at Claremont. Nothing can possibly exceed the plain
and unostentatious manner in which the household is ordered, the most rigid economy
being observable in all its arrangements.”
They remain in strictest retirement; nevertheless, Penny-a-liner will
make his few groats by dragging them into print. The economise, and
the virtue is published that the chronicler may earn his two-pence by
the history of the heroic fact.
“The Count and Countess go out very little. The Count generally rides in a close
carriage on his way to and from the railway station, and evidently studies to avoid the
appearance of any display.”
But Penny-a-liner will not be thus baulked. Let the Count desire to
ride with the blinds down, Penny-a-liner will pull them up, to exhibit
the Ex-King. Ex-Majesty, “studies” to avoid the appearance of
display,+ i Penny-a-liner is equally resolved upon making money by
making a show of the humility. Is it generous that Claremont, the last
retreat of a fallen man, should be turned into a glass-house, and the
“rigid economy” therein practised exhibited to all the world?
TO R.A.’s IN GENERAL AND ARTISTS IN PARTICULAR.
WE beg, as a special favour, that there will be no pictures of the
French Revolution in the next exhibition. We are already saturated
with takings of the Tullieries, and the avalanche of furniture, from
the windows of the Palais Royal, and §§ with fancy whiskers
and classic blouses doing duty as Garde Mobiles, and have had more
barricades on paper than we shall be able to get over during the re-
mainder of our #. The illustrated papers have had the cream of
these subjects, and they have whipped the cream by this time into the
thinnest trifle.
Besides, the LORD CHAMBERLAIN forbade at the theatres all pieces
}. the French Revolution. Artists, in the same way, should prohibit
their brushes from mixing in scenes of fire, and smoke, and bloodshed.
We hope Louis-PHILIPPE, also, will be spared. There is Gil Blas, and
the Vicar of Wakefield, and many other subjects which have not yet been
sufficiently explored. All politics should be thrown into the shade,
even a greater shade than that of the Octagon Room—that is to say,
they should not be seen at the Royal Academy at all. An artist should
paint history in the most neutral colours, and should canvass his subject
well before he sends an exiled king to the wall.
We hope the author of the Pleasures of Memory, (a MS. poem), will
take these observations in friendly part, and send in his crop of “lobster
salads” this year, without any titles to them, for fear that they might
be understood. By these means all mischief will be avoided, and the
pictures will not lose anything in interest, as it will be easy enough
to find titles for them after the exhibition is over. Finding the
Body of Harold will do very well for one of them.
A Curious Patient.
WE see a medical work advertised by “the Surgeon to the Bank of
England.” We are aware that the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street
was lately in a very bad state, but how far the surgeon relieved her, we
cannot tell. There is one thing certain, he did not bleed her to a very
at extent. How does he feel the Old Lady's pulse? We always
lieved that was the Stock Exchange; and the Surgeon must be a
cunning fellow if he can take that in hand. The appointment is a
curious one; and we should as soon have thought of an “Apothecary
to the Mint,” or of a “Chemist to London Bridge,” as a “Surgeon to
the Bank.” By the bye, if our Statues had had medical men to look
after them instead of sculptors, the chances are, they would not look so
bad as they do. But we doubt if even SIR BENJAMIN BRODIE could
save Trafalgar Square now, for it seems to be past all cure.

THE NEW CONTINENTAL COACH, “REVOLUTION."
THE FRENCH REPUBLIC AND THE FINE ARTS.
(From Our Own Correspondent.)
We are informed that M. LAMARTINE, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, has written the following important letter (how the copy, was.
gbtained, the reader will not have the bad manners to inquire) to the
Spanish Ambassador at Paris:– -
- - “Paris, Hôtel des Erangeres, April 10.
“Your ExcELLENCY,-The Provisional Government of the Republic
desires that its relations with all countries shall be those of highest
honour, and most scrupulous honesty. Animated by these feelings,
I have the satisfaction to acquaint your Excellency that MARSHAL
SQUIT has received an order to place in the hands of your Excellency
all the Spanish pictures brought by him from Spain in the days of the
Empire, always excepting those pictures for which the Marshal can
show a proper receipt, in full of all demands. -
“The Marshal has further received orders to hold himself in readiness
to accompany the pictures to Spain, and to superintend their hanging
in their old familiar places.

CONTEMPT OF THE COUNTY COURT.
# THE treatment of MR.'Pol LETT, lately brought
- before the House of Commons, proves that
inability to pay a debt amounts, by County
Court ſaw, to contempt of Court, and is
Rºle in the same manner as petty
arceny.
We propose that, by way of warning to
persons on the brink of }... the
Court should be appropriately decorated,
and that the judges of County Courts
in passing sentence, should recite in fail
the particulars of the punishment to which
that offence is liable. As, for instance:–
“JoHN ToMKINs. After a full and patient investigation, you are
convicted, to the satisfaction of a judge and # your country, of the
heinous crime of Contempt of Court, in neglecting to pay a debt. You
are well aware that your inability to pay is no excuse. The sentence
of the Court upon you is, that you be taken from this place to the
House of Correction, and there be imprisoned, and kept to hard labour
for five days. You shall be first conducted to - --
a lock-up house, where your pockets must -
be unbuttoned, and your - whole dress
searched; and you shall not be suffered to
open your lips. A pint of gruel shall be given
you to drink, and a bit of dry bread to eat;
and these materials shall form your diet during
your imprisonment. You are to sleep at night,
under inspection, upon a low iron bedstead,
with a bed of straw, three blankets, and a rug;
At six in the morning you shall be compelled
to take your bed and bed-clothes under your
arm, and be paraded with rogues and vaga- |
bonds for half-an-hour around theF.
t
|
You shall next breakfast on bread and gruel;
and after that you, shall be searched again. -
Thereupon you shall be taken, together with -
thieves and pick-pockets, and forced to strip
and bathe with them in the same , bath. -
When you come out, you shall be clad in -
coarse blue clothing, and your own dress shall
be taken away from you. . A ticket shall be
sewn on your right arm and back; and, having roºman or a “roon prºron.”
suffered these indignities, you shall be set to --
work at the picking of oakum with a crew of the vilest convicts. But
your punishment is not to end here: for your hair is to be eut off, and
your whiskers are to be shaved close to your face; and, may your degra-
dation be an example to all others in your unfortunate circumstances.”
The above is a literal description of the P. inflicted on MR.
Poll.ETT, for being unable to pay a debt of two pounds. The impres:
siveness of the sentence of the County Court would be much enhanced
were it thus delivered in detail—the judge, we may suggest, putting on
a black cap. The humanity and justice of County Court law would
also be displayed advantageously to an enlightened public. Neverthe-
less, we are afraid that such sentences will hardly operate to the
suppression of the contempt of County Courts. .

T H E GO TO BE D LETT E R S.
EALLY it is henceforth a matter
of military history—quite as
much so as the investment of
Paris—that on the 10th of
April, 1848, a division of the
—th regiment took up their
quarters in the house of MR.
PETER GoToBED, stockbroker,
Consol Place. That house
commanded one of the bridges,
by which it was expected—
especially by the GoToBED
family—that the rebellious mob
would return into Middlesex
and Westminster, to proclaim
the Republic. The hopes and
fears and final delight of the
GoToBEDs may, perhaps, by a
lively imagination be conceived;
but sure we are they can never
be wholly expressed, as the
writers of the subjoined letters
(to their relatives and intimates
in the country) occasionally
testify.
MR. PETER GOTOBED to MR. LAURENCE PoulTENEY.
"My DEAR FRIEND, -
“It’s all over; and our glorious QUEEN sits tighter on the throne than ever. I knew you'd
have the gout yesterday. I was sure of it, when you would drink the Constitution in that manner with
nine times, nine bumpers at the Hall; I knew you’d be in bed with the gout on the glorious 10th, and
so miss a chance of going down to posterity with a Special Constable's staff in your hand (as my wife
insists upon my being painted, as she says, for the children.) However, as you were wrapt in flannel, and
- ive you all the particulars. . -
“The morning broke dull and hazy, and I said to myself, ‘PETER, you'll have a hot day of it.”
Never did I eat my eggs, and ham, and herring, with so much alarm for the British Constitution.
y wife saw my feelings but said nothing, and made the tea, as a Roman heroine. The mother
of Gºconus couldn't have been more herself." The girls, too—Iſmust, say it—seemed in the best
spirits., More than that, I remarked that they had dressed themselves like new pins. It was quite
plain that the principles I had brought 'em . in, were bearing the noblest of fruits, and they had
put on their best bibs and tuckers, to stand reso utely by the British Constitution. - -
“With not so much as a tear in her eye, did my wife bring me my staff; so much did that heroic
woman (although I was going to leave home for many hours) control her feelings. Just as I was
§. bell rang at the back-gate, and SARAH ran in all of a fluster, saying, “If you please, Sir,
e sojers!”
“You see, F. M. the DUKE or WELLINGTON had written to me overnight (that letter is, for ever and
ever, an heir-loom to the GoToBEDs) requesting me to give the back-rooms to a division of the gal-
lant --th. ...To ask was to command. The children's beds were immediately removed; and, as I said to
my wife—“For the sake of the country, and for one night, the boys must bivouack in the drawing-room.
“I immediately went to the back-gate, and showed the division upstairs to their quarters. You will
think that a whole troop of soldiers, coming suddenly into a private house, would a little alarm a
i. family. Not the GoToBEDs, depend upon it. The girls saw every soldier, bayonets and all,
efile up stairs, and never shrank a muscle. I felt proud of 'em : I own it; I was a happy father. -
“‘From this angle, Sir,’ said CAPTAIN RATIONs, taking me to a corner of my own window, from this
angle, Sir, my brave fellows would hit any one waistcoat button of any one Chartist; if, indeed, such
vagabonds can afford waistcoat buttons.” “Dear Captain,” said I, “my house and family are doubly insured
with you in it... I leave it. I go, upon my duty with perfect confidence.’ ‘MR., GoToBED,” said the
Captain to me, taking my hand with that ease and good breeding that makes the soldier at home every-
where; MR. GoToBED, if the worst comes to the worst, depend upon it, all my troops, with your amiable
family, shall be buried in the ruins of this house, before a Chartist, shall cross the threshold., Buried,
Sir—in the ruins.”. What could I do? Is ueezed the Captain by the hand. Words; I had none to
thank him with. Luckily, however, I rj myself; and, drawing the key of the wine-cellar from
º pocket, I gave it to the Captain's, keeping. With a whisper—and I saw he felt the delicacy
of the attention— I merely said, ‘The left-hand bin,” and left him for my duty.
“I went upon my beat. Having nothing to do—for there wasn't so much as a º stirring—I caught
myself a humming the Marseillaise. And then-how it happened, I can't say—I did nothing but think
of all the Six Points of the Charter. They would keep tumbling about in my head whether or not.
And, upon my life—never having thought of 'em so much before—some of 'em I can't think so full of
rebellion as I did. In the first place—but no: when we meet I shall be ready to defend an extension
of the suffrage, triennial parliaments, and certainly, vote by ballot! It’s very odd; but this you may
depend upon. There were so many Special Constables on the 10th, with nothing else to do, that they
never thought so much of the Charter before.
“Well, the day went off º I got home at nine at night; j." in time to see the Captain
and men—(I assure you they hadn't forgot, the left-hand bin)-defile again out at the back-gate.
Once outside, the fife and drum struck up The girls we leave behind us ; and didn't we have a jolly

QUEEN and the Constitution! and at
twelve o'clock didn't my wife say,
in her own clever manner, “My dear
PETER, as that’s the fourth glass of
toddy, and as you’re a Special Con-
stable, I think you couldn't do better
than take yourself up—to bed.”
“After the excitement of yesterday,
and after feeling that the Throne is
#! as a trivet, I cannot settle my-
self down to business, so make holi-
day till to-morrow. Wive the Whigs /
“Yours ever truly,
- “PETER GOTOBED.”
“P.S. Just received a letter from
LIEUTENANT SNIGGs to dine at the
Mess; who tells me that F. M. the
Duke takes a quiet chop with 'em on
Tuesday, and I must come.”
MRs. GOTOBED to MRs. DEFURBELow.
“DEAR MRs. DEFURBELow,
“ALL your fears, kind as you
were to express’em, have been in vain.
Our house, as my daughter JULIA says,
was invested by the military; but
never, never were there such dears
of men. Your account of the siege of
Brussels, where you lived three days
in a henroost, supporting yourself
upon nothing but the eggs, did, I own
it, terrify, me with notions of the
military character, garrisoned in the
bosom of a family. But your soldiers
were filthy foreigners. You had not
to deal with the gallant—th.
“I assure you the regiment had
ossession of our house for a whole
ay, and not one speck was left upon
the carpets; not a rumple on the
chair-covers. But, for a few dozen
broken glasses, with a small, heap of
cigar ash, nobody could tell that a
soldier had been near us.
." GOTOBED was absent with
his Staff. Therefore, upon me alone
devolved the duty of all the honours;
§§ I must sayit, JULIA acquitted
herself most, heroically. After our
military luncheon, (I mustn't call it
dinner) the dear girl sang—he may
be happy yet, the brave LIEUTENANT
SNIgGs turning the leaves with a
feeling, that showed the true musician.
“JulLA is, a little depressed this
morning—and I don't wonder at it.
One can't be calm for a whole day
upon the eve of Revolution, without
paying for it the next.
“Yours always,
“ELIZA GoTOBED.”
“P. S. I don't know why I should
ask; but you know these things
better than I do. What is the fullest
pay of an army lieutenant?”
Miss JULIA GotoBED to MISS ARA-
BELLA RoseGARTEN.
“Yes, ARABELLA; the die is cast.
He has come—he has seen—and
have conquered. I always had a dim,
mysterious notion that my fate was
somehow bound up with the fate of
my country. And so it has turned
out. The Revolution that has broken

THE French Revolution has been accused of having produced
nothing great, excepting deputations, demonstrations, and, poplar
plantations. However, something great is at last to grow out of the
chaotic confusion. After the discord, is to come the harmony. The
eternal Marseillaise is to be succeeded by an opera of MEYERBEER.
We are to be indebted to the Revolution for the production of the
Prophète. This opera has been in portfolio for ten years; a little
pamphlet might be written on its vicissitudes, forming a musical supple-
ment to L’Histoire de Dir Ans. Many persons have doubted its
existence; but so was that of ABD-EL-KADER, until he was caught.
The Prophète, however, is in custody. No less than five acts have been
handed over to the copyists of the Académie. Every note is under the
strictest surveillance, and a patrol is placed in the orchestrato prevent

THE EMIGRATION FROM FRANCE.
THERE is one Emigrant from France against whom the Alien Act
will certainly never be enforced, however rigorously it may be carrie
into effect in the case of seedy firebrands with long hair, long beards,
and long faces, who go about London trying to persuade, Englishmen,
in the spirit of the fox without a tail, that this country would be mightily
benefited by giving up some of those things that France has lately
sacrificed. These gentlemen are not progressing very rapidly in their
ropagandist attempts, and, indeed, the cases of fraternisation are so
ew as to be scarcely worth mentioning.
The most interesting of all the emigrants, and the only one that is
sure of a cordial reception from the British people, belongs to a peculiar
species or specie which one of our artists has been at some pains to
indicate. This emigrant finds every door open to him; the best hotels
are at his service, and he sees every hand stretched out to receive him.
His initials are L. S. D., and he is welcomed with as much avidity as
any exiled sovereign.
It is expected that his presence in England will be productive of much
good, for he is º of English extraction, and his long, sojourn on
the Continent has been very injurious to the country to which he pro-
bably belongs, and where his return will be hailed with the utmost satis-
faction. He has hitherto failed to contribute his fair share of taxation,
and has been otherwise unprofitable in his character of an absentee;
but the greatness and stability of England will amply repay him for the
calls that will be made upon him, and L. S.D. will be as gratified at having
gºt back as we shall be delighted to hail his restoration to the land to
which he chiefly owes his existence.
| A SERIOUS LECTURE ON BROAD GRINS.
RESPECTFULLY ADDRESSED TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONs.
GENTLEMEN,
You will readily give me credit, when I assure you I am no
enemy to laughter. It is a foolish child that quarrels with its bread-
and-butter; and my bread-and-butter is the Broad Grin. But you will
excuse me for pointing out some little distinctions between my mirth
and yours.
I † at foolish people and folly; because, though insensible to
reason, they are keenly alive to ridicule. I make few of them better
}. this, perhaps, but I make a great many ashamed of themselves.
The Spartans fuddled their slaves to show their children what a con-
temptible, thing is a drunken man. So I occasionally F. the fool,
that possibly fools may see the absurdity of the thing, and avoid it.
Again, I hat knaves, because the lancet of the satirist may often
be a better too for pricking the world's humours than the scalpel of
hereformer, the discipline of the priest, or the sword of the judge.
here is always one face of roguery which is purely ridiculous, and as
is the face, which least imposes on people, I do some good by
turning it towards them.
... I sometimes, though rarely, laugh at wickedness; but when I do, it
ºnotivitha kindly or natural laughter, but a bitter and contemptuous
chuckle, which indeed is the only way I have of expressing disgust and
indignation. Lastly, I laugh a great deal in pure lightness of heart,
and this is the laughter I best like the echo of.
You see I can explain my laughter. But hang me if I can explain
d|yours. It is true we have some subjects and objects of laughter in
common. You laugh, for example, at SIRTHoRP, and so do I. I could
mention some other of our common friends; but let that pass. It is
where you laugh every now and then at what goes as near as anything
can go to make me cry, that I desiderate your theory of Broad Grins.
For º you laugh whenever the Charter is mentioned, or
Chartists. Now, that there are knaves and fools in plenty, who ask for
the one, and call themselves the other, is certain. But when Iremember
that, though MR. FEARGus O'Connor and his friends have a knack of
sticking in their ciphers very much at random, there are some hundreds
of thousands who blindly believe in those Five Points, and that of those
hundreds of thousands there is a large proportion of ignorant, hungry,
and squalid men, who have no share in the exaggerations of Conven-
tions, but who in their intolerable suffering, and hopeless toil, cling to
something which, delusion as it may be, is the only pleasant delusion they
have—when Ithink that if theirignorance be crassandgross, it is only the
more dangerous for the society of whose base they form no small part
—that if their passions and desires be desperate and hopeless, they
will only rend the fabric the more by the wildness of their straining—
and more than all, when I think on what society and the state have
done for these squalid, blind, striving masses, and that you represent
the collective wisdom of our society, if they embody its collective
ignorance—then, to me deeply pondering these things (as BRough AM
would say), your laughter at these men, and their Charter, sounds the
strangest, saddest, vainest—I had almost written, wickedest-of sounds
utterable by human voices. Did you never hear of Alpine travellers
whose laughter has brought down an avalanche? So far as I can see,
you must abandon this habit. I do not suppose it is the wisest, or
oldest, or most thoughtful among you who indulge in it. But, for your
own sakes, such of you as are wise and thoughtful should put down
this crackling of thorns under a pot. At such a time as this, gravity
at least, if not sadness, would better become all of us. I sometimes
feelin my motley as if I were clad in sackcloth and ashes. But nothing
in the eventful history of the last two months has º so near to dry
up the spring of mirthfulness in me altogether as that ominous, asinine
laughter of yours. Ithought of it on Monday week, when the streets
were blank with e anxiety, and London bristled with bayonets, and
I said to myself, “What if that silly laughter of the Commons were to
be re-echoed (after the Irish fashion) this day with the voice of cannon?”

WE are happy in making an announcement which will instil

to be empowered with authority for *.*.*. and

We are informed his first experiment will be tried u
a Young Irelander, an Old Irelander, and an Orangeman. He
will shut them up in a room, and not allow them to leave it
till they have shaken hands, together, and have but one idea,
one impulse in common—the benefit of their native country.
We confess we have our doubts, but it would be ungenerous
to give expression to them at present. The talented tamer

PUNCH'S REVIEW.
The Parliamentary Duellist. Waistcoat-pocket Edition. By FEARGUs
O'ConnoR, Esq., M.P. To be had of all Parliamentary Agents.
THIS is a very timely book. No gentleman's pistol-case can be com;
lete, without it...MR. O'ConnoR has taken the whole, breadth and
ength of the subject; and has proved himself singularly capable of
teaching the rising Member, whoever he may be. Our first intention
was, for the good of the world, to infringe the law of copyright, and
transfer the whole of MR. O'Connor's book to our pages. A latent
feeling of honesty induces us to limit the larceny to one extract; and
as that one contains the whole essence of the volume, the economic
reader will pause before he wastes his money upon the book itself.
Here is the whole kernel of the nut :— -
“There may arise an occasion upon which the manifestation of an heroic contempt of
powder and ball will give the House avery elevated notion of the courage of the Member.
The occasion is this... Fasten a quarrel upon yourself. Translate in a high and arbitrary
spirit the assertion of an opponent as reflecting the very strongest bull's-eye light upon
your probity. Whereupon, looking hard at Mr. Speaker, and then turning to your
3. say—‘This, Sir, must be answered in another ºl. You shall hear from me.
Chalk Farm, or Wimbledon—take your choice.’. Upon which, with a pistol-ball in either
eye, stalk hurriedly from the House, going straight to your own lodgings. For, depend
upon it, the Minister or somebody, will rise to prevent bloodshed; will move that you
are immediately brought before the House; and it would be ill-manners to the Serjeant-
at-Arms to be denied at your own lodgings, when that, distinguished officer feels it his
: to call upon you. Showing a proper respect for the dignity of Parliament, you will
suffer yourself to be led back to the House: and further, to illustrate your docility to
the law, you will permit yourself to be bound like a tame lamb, as Pope says, to shake
the hand ‘just raised to shed your blood.’”
It must be confessed that this, passage pulsates—every syllable of it
-with wisdom. Moreover, it has this recommendation. It is not
offered on a crude theory; but is further recommended by the sincere
knowledge of the writer; he having personally illustrated by example
what he so eloquently teaches by precept, The book (with a gratitude
as rare as it is touching) is dedicated to the Serjeant-at-Arms.

NOBILITY AT THE PYRAM IDS.
THE season for continental tripping and touring being happily, rather
remote at the present period of the year, there is just a change that, by
the time the autumn comes round, the state of Europe will be suffi-
ciently tranquil to allow one to entertain the notion of going, for
leasure, to France or Italy. Unless a change does take place, the
ºyramids will be the only perfect substitute for Baden-Baden, and the
rt of Ascalon will be the recognised apology for Boulogne, as aforeign
§ ing-place. We shall be hearing of a table-d'hôte on the shelving
precipices of Palmyra, and a boarding-house started on the Libyan
sands, with water laid on from the Grand African, Junction, and
Friendly Nile Association, for the supply of genuine Nile on equitable
principles. The means of rapid locomotion are so very numerous, that
the journey to these remote places will be almost as easy as it used to
be formerly to visit France or Italy; and, as peace and quiet are indis-
nsable to the full enjoyment of a holiday, nothing nearer than the
mids can be thought of, at present, by travellers for pleasure.
COMMISSION OF LUNACY EXTRAORDINARY.
A CoMMIssion of Lunacy, which had been issued on the prayer of
the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, against three unfortunate individuals
JoHN Mºº MEAGHER, and W. S. O’BRIEN, was opened
last week, in Dublin.
Several witnesses deposed to acts of lunacy on the part of these un-
fortunate persons, John MITCHELL laboured under a delusion that he
was a slave, and that he was oppressed by certain imaginary persons
called “Saxons.” . He would walk about the room for hours, brandishing
a pen, which, he declared was a pike and calling upon every, one who
came in to “break their chains, Witnesses never saw anybody with
any chains on at the time he called out so. MITCHELL, MEAGHER, and
Q’BRIEN often quarrelled. When they were fighting, they used to call
themselves “united Irishmen.” They often tried to set the house on fire
with lighted newspapers. When remonstrated with, they used to shout
out “Ireland for the Irish!”. Witnesses had known them dress themselves
up in strange uniforms. They would get hold of or any weapons
left about, and witnesses had often, been alarmed by the reckless way
in which they brandished them about. O'BRIEN was once so violent
that he had to be put into the cellar. He was much quieter for some
time after that. Witnesses believed they knew the value of money
when they had any, but did not consider them capable of managing
their own affairs. The house they, lived in was kept by a MR. John
BULL. He was very kind to his lodgers—used often to send them up
victuals, and clothes, and money. They eat the victuals and took the
money, but used to tear the clothes to pieces and go about in rags.
They always abused MR. BULL, and witnesses believed it was he they
meant by “Saxon.” When he sent, them up victuals, they used to
complain he was starving them, andlwhen he gave them money, the
would shout out “robbery!” thus collecting mobs under the windows, an
alarming the neighbours, who used to come in, believing that they
were being ill used.
After hearing much evidence to the same effect, the Commission
proceeded to examine these afflicted persons. They found them very
much excited, raving about chains and slavery, though at the time
perfectly free from any restraint whatever. MR. MEAGHER was on a
chair making a speech. He had arms, as had also his companions;
and MR. BULL declared he did not consider himselſ safe under the same
roof with them. -
When , the Commissioners. came in, the three unhappy lunatics
demanded that their chains might be taken off, and that they might no
longer be starved and murdered by the “Saxon,” shaking their fists at
MR. BULL, who declared that so far from robbing, them, he was
seriously out of pocket for provisions with which he had supplied them.
The Commission, after putting a few questions to the lunatics, to which
they could not get any intelligible reply, gave their verdict unanimously,
that “John MITCHELL, THOMAS MEAGHER, and W. S. O’BRIEN, have
been of unsound, mind, and incapable of managing their own, affairs
since the 1st of April, 1846. They further recommend that the said
John MITCHELL, THQMAs, MEAGHER, and W. S. O'BRIEN be put
Mººn', as their violence is attended with danger to themselves
and others.”
CONSCIENCE-MONEY.
EveRY now and then we find an acknowledgment in the Times, that
the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER has received so many pounds
from So-AND-So, on account of unpaid taxes or unclaimed income-tax.
A qualm of conscience on the part of some secret defaulter sends a five-
ound note flying towards the national coffers. It is a refreshing thing
or our country's resources, when a sinner cannot unburden his heart
without unbuttoning his pocket. It would perhaps be satisfactory if
the sums sent in by reformed rogues were described under the heads to
which they properly belong in the quarterly accounts of the Revenue.
We ourselves have sometimes had our brains racked, and our feelings
tortured, by a recollection of having once brought over a letter from
abroad to a friend in England, and twice have we made the effort to
summon the courage to forward the eightpence to the PostMASTER-
GENERAL. But no; the resolution on some occasions, or the money
on others, has always been wanting, and we walk about, a wretched
robber of our country to the tune of eightpence. Besides, we are of
opinion that Conscience is not to be pacified by restoring at our own
convenience what does not belong to us. Such tardy honesty is but a
doubtful virtue, and we recommend the parties who practise it to be a
little more prompt, for the future, in the performance of their duties.
What will become of Him?
THIs important question is suggested by a contemplation of the
probable fate of the author of the following .
WE-DON'T-KNow-WHAT-To-CALL-IT-
..We understand that when it was proposed in the National Conven:
tion to die on Blackfriars Bridge, rather, than give way, MR. JULIAN
HARNEY, who is a little fellow, leaped enthusiastically on to the
shoulders of his friend CUFFEY, to make himself visible, and that
CUFFEY thereupon declared his wish to rush forth to battle, exclaiming
—“At least we’ll die with HARNEYs (Harness?) on our back.”
Dreadful Mortality.
WE have heard of Irish patriots promising to die upon the floor of
the House of Commons, but we little expected the frightful, mortality
which, has taken place in that patriotic cemetery within the last week.
We allude to the deaths of the 3,600,000 persons who were said to have
signed the Chartist Petition. They all gave up the ghost on the floor
of the House of Commons, and were followed to, the grave by...MR.
FEARGUs O'ConnoR, who was chief mourner on the occasion. Their
remains were properly, attended to by MR. CRIPPs, who was deeply
moved on the melancholy occasion. Though they all died for the
§§ their country, yet not one of the 3,600,000 has left a name

DREADFUL OUTRAGE IN THE CITY.
Monday, April 10th. We stop the press to announce that
the Bank of England has been entered during the night. Its
doors are closed, and all cash º suspended.
The whole place is filled with arms. The Old Lady has taken
refuge in the cellars, and it is rumoured that the Directors
have fled there also, to enjoy their rest.
The Beadle has deserted his post, and not a clerk is to be
seen for love or money.

skilled in the art of joking.
THE MODEL HUSBAND.
He walks out with his wife, on a week day, and is not afraid of a
milliner's shop. He even has “change” when asked for it, and never
alludes to it afterwards. He is not above, carrying a large. brown
º, or a cotton umbrella, or the clogs, or even holding the
aby in his lap in an omnibus. He runs, on first, to knock at the
door, when it is raining. He goes outside, if the cab is full. . He
goes to bed first in cold weather. He will get up in the middle of the
†: to rock the cradle, or answer the door-bell. He allows the mother-
in-law to stop in the house. He takes, wine with her, and lets her
breakfast in her own room. He eats cold meat without a murmur or
pickles, and is indifferent about pies and puddings. The cheese is
never too strong, or the beer, too small, or the tea too weak for him.
He believes in hysteries, and is melted instantly with a tear. He
patches up a quarrel with a velvet gown, and drives away the sulks with
a trip to Epsom, or a gig in the Park on Sunday. He goes to church
regularly, and takes his wife to the Opera once a year. He pays for
her losses at cards, and gives her all his winnings. He never flies out
about his buttons, or brings home friends to supper. His clothes never
smell of tobacco. He respects the curtains, and never smokes in the
house. He carves, but never secretes for himself “the brown.”
He respects the fiction of his wife's age, and would as soon burn his

innocent of a latch-key.
He lets the family go out of town once every year, whilst he remains
at home with one knife and fork, sits on a brown holland chair, sleeps
on a curtainless bed, and has a charwoman to wait on him. He goes
down on the Saturday, and comes up on the Monday, taking with him
the clean linen, and bringing, back, the dirty clothes. He checks the
washing-bills. He pays the housekeeping money without a suspicion,
and shuts his eyes to the “Sundries.” He is very easy and affectionate,
keeping the wedding anniversary § ; never complaining if the
dinner is not ready; making the breakfast himself if no one is down;
letting his wife waltz, and drink F. before company. He runs all
her errands, pays all her bills, and cries like a child at her death.
Beware of your Leaders.
We must not be too angry with the forgeries to the Chartist Petition,
for they have evidently proceeded from poor uneducated persons, whose
rincipal flourish is in never allowing themselves to be dictated to.
uch grossness never could have occurred, if § had had proper
rulers to guide them. . It is a doubtful point, whether MR. FEARGUs
O'Connor is anxious for a Republic, but one thing is certain, he never
would be popular as a DICTATOR.
Appointments.
We have great pleasure, in stating that the Order of the “High
Constable” is to be established in England. This appointment is to
be conferred on Mr. Punch, whose achievements in preserving
ublic peace last Monday week must come home to the bosoms and
#. of many. He will be invested with the baton de connétable in a
few days; that is to say, he will be allowed to retain the one he has
flourished so long and successfully in the service of his country.
NATURAL HISTORY OF ENTHUSIASM.
THE tricolor flag hung out of a house in Paris means “No rent paid
here.” No wonder, under such circumstances, that an unflagging zeal
displays itself among the house proprietors.
Real Equality.
ATHEATRE, it is said, is about to be established at Paris, in which
the prices are to be equal to all parts of the house, the salaries are to
be equal, for all the *. high or low, and the temper of the
manager is to be equal under every trial to which it may be º:
The system of perfect equality is also to be applied to a variety of other
matters. The equinoctial line has already given in its adhesion to the
French Republic, and the engineer's level is the only one that has been
known to turn dumpy in France at the present state of affairs.

under a hideous aristocratic despotism. . .
“The traject from Boulogne was made in two hours; a strong wind
agitated the waters of the Sleeve (la Manche); unaccustomed to mari-
time motion, I suffered frightful anguishes. More dead than alive, I
was supported to shore at Folkestone, by a couple of English opera-
tives who, (with many more of their nation) found themselves on board.
“These miserables and their families are quitting our country, where
they have been enriching themselves for . years at the expense of
France. I cannot but º the decree which banishes them from
our soil. Are there not Frenchmen enough to till it? Are we inferior
in art, in bravery, in science, to these insularies? Let them be flung
out of a nation which has need of all its wealth for the support of its
own children. - - - -
“I protest against the manner in which the fugitive artisans were
received upon the brumous shores, of Albion. Hypocritical means of
shelter have been provided for the fugitives. The Iord Mayor of
Folkestone ºf them with expressions of condolence, and with
offers of bread and the national, beer. These expressions, this food,
this sympathy that Albion flings into the figure of France, is an insult
to the Republic. She will wash herself of it, as of PRITCHARD indem-
nities and other outrages, with which she has been for a long time
beveraged. - -
“The Citizen Superintendent of the baggage of this port, is an

with insular scorn. Glorious emblem! In three days, in the midst of
bayonets and battles, it shall gird the heart of the patriot! WELLING-

I proceeded to London uncomfortably in the third-class wagon.
“An omnibus transports the voyagers from the station across the
foggy Thames and the bridge of Westmainsterre, by the Vite Hall built by
the Norman William, and where a traitorous monarch justly met his
doom, to the *. of the Gallery of the Nation,” as the Chambers are
here, called. Fountains bubble before it, endlessly, dirty and frothing
emblems of the deliberations within. Hideous equestrian statues
offend the eyes of the visitor. The palace of the QUEEN, called Northom-
berland Ouse, is opposite the Chamber: surmounted by a stupid British
Lion, which shall not long remain on those pinnacles. A column of
stone, called the Column of Trafalgar, of which I do not understand the
meaning, for history makes no mention of such a man or place, is in
the centre of this Squarr, as the places of London are called.
“Mylodgings were selected in this neighbourhood. Descending from
the omnibus with my sack-of-night, and showing the card on which the

“This, the fashionable quarter, is entirely in the possession of French-

Citizen Minister, how shall I describe to you my sentiments, when I
saw on the list of petitioners the name of the QUEEN VICTORIA, and
the miserable WELLINGTON | . . . -
“With these eyes I saw their writing ! With a coward eagerness
they have signed the document, not once, but many, times. So, you
train yourselves before the popular car, do you?. So, by devancing the
ranks of the nation, armed for liberty, you think to hide your own
liberticide projects? Miserable hypocrites! I unmasked at once their
intentions to the agent of the CITIZEN FEARGoose, who showed me the
parchments. He was much struck by what Isaid. -
“Other names were mentioned in the inscribed, which will astonish
the Statesman. SIR PEEL has signed it !—What principles has he not
already professed? PRINCE ALBERT, husband of the QUEEN, has
signed it. Even the infamous PALMERSTON has written that mame

that of SNooks: and merits well of the country. I should think there

“‘And will they all be in the field of honour to-morrow?' I asked.
“‘Behind the barricades, my brother Citizen, responded BRowN,

“CHEEKs the Marine also has signed: his corps of red-coats is with

LAYING DOWN THE LAW. THE REPEAL POETRY.
If we are to judge by some of the specimens
we have lately seen, the Repealers are very badly
off indeed for poetry just now; and they could
not do, better than engage our old friend, the
Invisible Poet of Cremorne, to rub, up their
reputation for lyrical talent. He could aid them
by contributing some of his “thoughts that
breathe and, words that burn,” to a cause that
makes burning one of its principal objects.
Some of the recent Re effusions are scarcely
worthy to take their place by the Saxon “ :
diddle diddles” of a primitive era. One of the
latest consists of a chorus, whereof the burden
—and a precious leaden burden it is, in more
senses than one—amounts to nothing more than
“Buy a rifle, buy a rifle,
For a trifle–for a trifle.”
And there is another distich, made up of the
sage remark–
“Onwards, onwards, - . ..
The foe is before us;
Our cause is so just,
It must be victorious.”
We think, the effect of this would be mate:
rially aided % a “tooral looral” or two, and
perhaps a little “right tooral”, in, just to give
an agreeable and cheerful finish. The Reptal

powers to those displayed in the rubbishwe have
quoted. The Chelsea Swan, who warbles like a
woodlark in the Caves of Cremorne, would supply
some real poetry, warranted to send the blood up
to boiling point, at a very moderate price, and
- would entirely supersede the necessity of resort-

PUNCHPS POLICE.
UEEN SQUARE. — A
aunt, oldish-looking
oy, who, turning up
his nose at the magis-
trate, gave his name as
HENRY BRough AM,
was charged with
having attempted to
injure Pio Nono,
º Pope of Rome,
y squirting at his
Holiness aquantity of
gutter-mud.
It appeared that
some evenings ago an
Italian was going
down Parliament
Street, carrying upon
his head a collection
of plaster-casts, mo-
dern and antique.
The Italian belonged
to that humble but
useful class of the
cognoscenti who have
done so much to abo-
- lish the spotted cats
and painted parrots from the shelves of country parlours and cot-
tages; placing in their stead the forms and faces of beauty and genius.
The Italian was one of the serviceable wayfarers, complimented by
MR. WILLIAM Wordsworth :—
“Or thro' our hamlets thou wilt bear
The sightless M1LtoN, with his hair
Around his placid temples curl’d;
And SHAKsp EARE at his side—a freight
If clay could think and mixd were weight,
For him who bore the world.”
Well, this harmless Italian paused to rest his load in Parliament
Street—his load of grace, and worth, and beauty. There was BAILEY's
Boe, with FIELD-MARs HAL PRINCE ALBERT, i among other notables
the bust of Pius THE NINTH. The complainant deposed, that, a friend
with a barrel-organ coming up, they began to talk about the glorious
regeneration of Italy, when the defendant passed them. “Regeneration!
Humbug!” said the defendant, making a mouth, and going on. Know-
ing the offender, from his much frequenting the neighbourhood, the
Italian took no notice of his insolence, . However, in a few minutes he
was covered with filthy water; and, looking round, he saw the defendant
kneeling beside a gutter, and filling a squirt. atched him, and saw
him deliberately attempt to squirt mud upon the bust of the Pope : the
filth, however, fell quite short of the mark, and the bust remained as
pure as ever.
The magistrate, commenting very severely upon such dirty conduct,
asked the defendant what he had to say for himself?
The defendant, with inimitable assurance, said his worship was a
humbug—the Pope was a humbug—the complainant was a humbug—in
fact, that all the world, save one individual christened HENRY, was a
humbug of the most forlorn and crass description. As for what he had
done, it was his pleasure—in fact he had no other enjoyment—to squirt
dirty water at everybody and everything. He had squirted ink at
GEORGE THE Fourth, and very lately at the KING or SARDINIA. He
squirted at Pius THE NINTH, and for the same reason that he
would squirt at the man in the moon; namely, for the light and lustre
that surrounded him.
The *:::::: expressed the strongest regret that there was no law
to reach the offender.
“I know that: I know the law,” said the defendant; “I know how
far I can enjoy mischief and never pay for it. I say, old fellow,” added
the hardened old boy, winking at the magistrate, “perhaps you don't
know who signed ‘Pugnose to the Chartist humbug; but I do.”
‘And again the defendant impudently winked, and again the magis-
trate regretted that there was no law to reach him.

FEARGUs O'ConnoR tells us he received ninety wounds on one
Qccasion at Manchester. Are we to take this number as accurate, or
tº knock off the same liberal discount which reduced the signatures of
#. Chartist Petition one-fifth P. Eighteen wounds are not bad, and we
think FEARgus ought to be content with our generous taxation. Many
persons would not have allowed him a single one. . As it is, we may say
if the reader and CUFFEY will forgive us) that how he has survived
it, is a perfect wounder!!!
WOL. XIV.
THE LION, THE COCK, AND THE EAGLES.
STORM-cLouds were over Europe, light slept on England's breast,
The nations heaved with earthquake throes, but England was at rest;
A cry went up from Passaro unto the Baltic shore,
And every tongue but England's had its echo in the roar.
The couchant Lion from his cliff looked o'er the Channel-sea,
To where the smoke wreathed o'er the wave its sulphurous canopy;
His ear erect, his big fore-paws stretched, claw-sheathed, out at length,
And in his eye the calm that comes from consciousness of strength.
Hark, hurtling wings and hurried What flight thus cleaves the smoke?
The Gallic Čock This mate and chicks—his crow changed to a croak,
Forlorn they stand about the strand, and cheep—all limp and lame--
Cock missing hen, hen missing cock, for they scattered as they came.
Still looked the Lion o'er the sea, where the storm lay black as might,
When he was 'ware, high up in air, of a strange and sudden sight—
Two huge black Eagles—double-beaked-their lean necks iron crowned,
At buffets with a screaming flight of their own eaglets round. .
A ruffled mass of tossing plumes, red beaks, and rending claws,
Dashed all about the ... heavens—and then a panting pause—
And those two monster Eagles reeled bloody from the cloud
Of their own eaglets' battle—crest-fallen, conquered, cowed.
The Emperor Wulture of the North, from his Carpathian height
Looked with a restless º: on that stern but short-lived fight;
And uneasily kept pacing his eyrie to and fro,
And spread his broad black wing to hide from his brood what passed below.
Then thought the Lion, “So it is—a lesson written plain–
I only, among beasts or birds, hold peaceable domain.
The Gallic Cock was crafty, the Almaine Eagles strong—
But what are craftiness and strength, with folly, fraud, and wrong?
“In the shrillest of his crowing, the Cock is chased from power;
In the fiercest of their swooping, the Almaine Eagles cower;
I only hold untroubled rule o'er beasts of fold and field– -
I, that know the strength of weakness, yield to keep, and keep to yield.
“All beasts. I take to council—the Fox's craft I share
With the Elephant’s sagacity, the brute-force of the Bear,
The wisdom of the Serpent, the mildness of the Dove;
I mate majesty with meekness, and wrathfulness with love.
“When the Ass insists on braying, the Ass is free to bray;
When the Bull-dog’s bent on growling, I give his growl free way;
All my Macaws may scream their screams, my Parrots speak their speech,
All my Quacks, Professors, Preachers, may puff, profess, or preach.
“I hold a time for all things—admit each fact a fact—
See the world changing round me, and with it change in act.
I look on nought as final, save the Good, and Just, and Right;
With these for backers, what care I under what flag I fight?
“Jostle it out among ye, blind leaders of the blind,
The windy empire .#}. Birds is little to my mind.
Light as your bodies float through air, so light your minds may range
From theory to theory, from endless change to change.
“Ye shall not stir the Lion from out his island lair,
In your brawlings, and your bluster, and your bickerings to share;
He keeps here in his quiet nook, ringed by the salt sea-foam,
For all opinion a retreat—for all distress a home.”
JOKES ABSOLUTELY THROWN AWAY."
Sever AL constables' staffs, on the memorable Chartist-Petition-
Failure were made of Gutta Percha. We wonder such a fruitful sub-
ject has escaped joking. The soluble qualities of the “best substitute
for caoutchouc” seem to melt almost into a rich cream of jokes. For
instance, we can imagine its being said that Gutta Percha was selected
purposely to enable the constables to stick to their duty. ...Again, we
can fancy it probable some daring humourist, would hint, that such a
material naturally was chosen to enable the Chartists, by being sworn
in, to prove their adhesion to the Government; or, in any, case, there
was a good chance of some one facetiously observing that the staff was
put into their hands so that, in the event of their displaying any
turbulent warmth, they would be bound down to keep the piege.
We hope, when such a subject presents itself again, it will not be
allowed to pass with the same neglect which universal jokers have
passed upon it this time, or else we shall have to reprimand our young
pupils severely.

ALARMING INTELLIGENCE.
PIMLIco has been in aº panic.
The loyal neighbourhood of Stafford
Buildings has gone crazy—and indeed
the houses were crazy enough before
—at the startling announcement that
if this, that, and the other, are not
done to please FEARGUs O'ConnoR,
he (FEARGUs O'Connor) will turn
Republican. Fancy the adhesion of
the “Convention Pet” being with-
drawn from the Crown, and Monarchy
losing the º it has hitherto pos-
j in this loudest of the friends
of Universal Nothing and Equal Every-
thing. As to the Palace, we tremble
at the most distant contemplation of
the melancholy effect that must be produced by the announcement
that FEARGus O'Connoit, threatens to turn Republican, reaching the
ears of his sovereign. We can almost see in our mind's eye—which,
by the way, is most emphatically our total optic or “all our eye”—we
can, we say, almost see HERMAJESTY rushing to one of the royal band-
boxes, and thrusting into it. that Crown which FEARGus O'Consor
has threatened with his contingent hostility.
We can imagine the making of preparations for removing the establish-
ment of the Royal Arms, and putting the Unicorn into the position of
a London cab-horse, while the British Lion may be seen “Alive, alive!”
—like last Monday's mackarel—in a caravan containing the º:
of Royalty, removed in consequence of FEARGUs O'Connor having
withdrawn from his allegiance.
We hope FEARGUs will pause, before he goes further, and that he
will not think of carrying out his horrible threat of turning Republican.
Of course, if he joins -
IRepublicanism, the *
thing, is done, , as -
everything elseisdone
that he meddles with.
Let us hope that he
will pause in time, and -
continue that very tº
valuable career of loy-
alty which has done
so much to consoli-
date the throne and
the institutions of his
country. Let him not
ersevere, and drive
is sovereign into pri-
vate life, or PRINCE
ALBERT into making
a profit of those
icultural pursuits
which he has hitherto
cultivated only as an
amusement.

IORD CANTELUPE, DIKE or
CUFFEY.”—Morning Post.
#. we observed Count D'ORsAY,
EAUFoRT, PRINCE GEORGE,-and Mr.
BROUGHAM ON GOVERNMENT.
LoRD BROUGHAM has volunteered an explanation of his request to be
turned inside out into a Frenchman. It was only to protect his pro-
perty when in France; as, on arriving in England, he could-upon the
principle that one good turn deserves another-turn again, bringing the
ermine outside. Curious, however, are the views of BROUGHAM upon
government. Liberty is a tree that cannot grow in a Republic; and
Truth is the amaranthine flower that will not flourish in a Court. Afew
nights since, in the House of Lords, BROUGHAM said:–
“Let Venice become a Republic if she pleases: perhaps she may find in that form of
government some peculiar advantages; but there is one thing that she will not find, and
that is liberty. Experience has led me to form this conclusion, that liberty is not a plant
that can flourish in a Republic.”
Let the reader turn to BRough AM's Sketches of Statesmen, article
and what an article!) George the Fourth. He will there find these
opinions applied to Kings and Courts :-
“They who believe that they are exempt from the toils, and hardly liable to the
casualties, of other mortals—all of whose associates and most of whose instructors set
themselves about confirming this faith—are little likely to waste the midnight oil in any
contemplations but those of the debauchee; and beings who can hardly bring themselves
to believe that they are subject to the common fate of humanity, are pretty certain to
own no inferior control.”
Again; and this is rather strong:-
“That they who draw the breath of life in a Court, and pass all their days in an
atmosphere of lies, should have any very sound regard for truth, is hardly to be expected.”
. From this it appears that LoRD BRough AM neither likes, the repub-
lican nor the monarchical form, of government. No: . but he has a
Utopia of his own; and Punch believes that he shall violate no confi-
dence by briefly describing it in his Lordship's words.--"My dear
Punch,” said his Lordship to us—for it is well known that, in the hand-
somest, manner, LQRD BROUGHAM always sits to us when we .
his portrait—“my dear Punch, my form of government is not a Republic,
nor a Monarchy, nor an Oligarchy, nor a paternal Despotism—but the
excellencies and advantages and manifold beauties of all these combined;
and in that government you will find—a paternal BROUGHAM.”

GREAT BARGAIN
WHo wants a BRough AM, still fit for any sort of work
I’m a rum 'un, p'rhaps, to look at, but a 'unsure to go;
The only thing I can't abide at all is being short of work;
All weights I’m up to, but a bore—all paces, but the slow.
There’s not a road in Europe but I’ve trundled every inch of it;
From the palace to the pothouse, I know all, and all know me ;
English boy or French postilion, I'll bowl you, willy nilly, on,
And in a crack I’ll plant you, smack, where you never thought to be.
Either pikes or barricades, Sir, I’ll go at undismayed, Sir,
If #. head you’ll only give me-else I’m stubborn as a bull;., ...
No odds how tough, no odds how rough the work, I’m not afraid, Sir,
There’s only one thing I can't pass, and that’s a sack of wool.
I’ve run every sort of rig, Sir—Tory, Radical, and Whig, Sir-
I’ve come out in every character wheeled thing could'h ure in;
I’m vettura at Milan, Sir, I'm French calèche at Cannes, Sir,
I’m drosky at St. fetersburgh, and wagen at Berlin. ,
For speed . ’s nought can catch me, for pluck there’s nought can
match me - -

Be quite as rash, yet save the smash that waits them in the end.
THE SWEETS OF SEDITION.
THE sweets in the sugar-shops of Dublin, have, lately run into the
popular mould of warlike sedition. Thus, little children have been able
to imbibe the instructions of MITCHELL AND Co. by buying a pike for a
halfpenny, in painted sugar. This is instilling poison into the infant
minds of Ireland with a vengeance. Any ammunition, from a cannon-
ball in Spanish liquorice to a musket in chocolate, can be had, we are
told, at these saccharine depôts. There is one consolation, however,
that these arms will not stand fire, but are likely to run if they are at
all warmly handled. This Young Ireland must be a tremendous fire.
eater, if, as we are informed, red-hot coals are sold three for a penny,
at these incendiary arsenals. One sweatmeat vendor has taken advan-
tage of this new rage, and has written over his door, “Pike-maker to
the Infantry of Ireland.” Thus is Sedition made succulent to the most
childish taste. ,

THE CHARTIST PROCESSION ACCORDING TO THE SIGNATURES OF THE PETITION.
It is a very remarkable fact connected with the late Chartist Petition,] . Perhaps, after all, the two Premiers—ex and present—have as much
that the parties who appear to have contributed the largest amount of interest as the CUFFEys the REYNoLDSEs, and the M'GRATHs in one
signatures were not forthcoming to back the document on the day of
its presentation. Our artist, in his beautiful simplicity following the
pictorial practice of the present day, has drawn from his own imagina-
tion the exact representation of the passing of the procession; and
in order to place our periodical quite on a par with our illustrated -
contemporaries, he has introduced almost as many characters that never \
were engaged in the ceremony, as are usually to be found in the views \\\
of passing events that are drawn expressly by “artists on the spot.”
—which spot, by the way, is always that convenient spot, their own
*ś the illuminated journals.
The Chartist Procession, with which we this day present our readers,
is in accordance with the view we should be justified in taking of it, if
the signatures to the Petition were bond fide, and comprised of the
actual autographs of the illustrious personages whose names were found
#: to the document in conjunction with those of the heroic
GNoSEs, FLATNoses, and other great nasal organs of Chartist opinion
that seemed desirous of being heard in favour of the six pints, or three
quarts, as our friend CUFFEY has ingeniously designated his favourite
measures. Had the petition been anything but a hoax, HER MAJESTY
would have been at an early hour wending her way towards Kennington
Common with seventeen DUKEs of WELLINGTON at her side, and SIR
R. PEEL would have been conspicuous in the van that was bearing the
monster document.

at least of the points of the Charter—the payment of Members–
for Lord John Russell, and SIR.R. PEEL would, at least, have some
prospect of earning the money, while the Chartist heroes, if they did
happen to get smuggled into the Legislature once, would sº disgust
their own ºnstituents that the salaries would soon be stopped to such
worthless representatives.
THE RAGGED REVOLUTION.
RAGGED LETTERS.
HARLEs. CochRANE—the Poor Man's
Advertised Friend—is the very hero
of rags.....His soup-kettle is not
merely “tinkling brass,” but an
instrument of loud-sounding metal,
whereupon he drums, and beats his
continual self-glorification. CochRANE
has laid out atolerable sum of money
for popularity; nevertheless—it does
sometimes happen—he has had but a
very shabby penn'orth for his hard
cash. The women of Westminster,
who covered themselves with confu-
º sign and blue ribands—when Coch-
RANK was blighted as M. P.--notwith-
standing behaved, very handsomely to
him when he called the meeting in
- - Trafalgar Square, having worked two
flags in black and white worsted—a skull and cross-bones as natural as
eath—wherewith their hero was to walk, as straight as possible, to
Buckingham Palace. Why CochRANE, staid at home it is not out
#. to inquire. That knotty point we leave for the teeth of
story.
However, following our hero, we now find him in the workhouses of
London. Determined upon a Ragged Revolution which should repeal
the English Unions, CHARLEs CochRANE addressed a circular to the
poor, º upon them to send their friends to take a walk with him
on Easter Monday from Leicester Square to Downing Street, by
Whitehall. The letter was a very pretty thing. On one side was,
“No Bastiles!” illustrated by a portrait of CochRANK waving a bird's.
eye handkerchief upon a stick, above the ruins of St. James's Work-
house. “After you have secured the contents of this in your brain,
and stamped its impression upon your heart, be pleased to put it in
your hat for the grand deputation on Easter Monday at one, Horse-
Guards' time.” This was the touching exhortation of C. C. on the
cover of the Circular. The contents were as follow:—
“As it is very likely, from a base and contemptible envy of my
growing reputation, you may not be permitted by your stony-hearted
tyrants to come yourselves, send your friends; d if I am not there
to head the procession, be sure of one thing: they will find the Police.
“Your friend till death (but not to the Station-House),
“Charles CochRAN.E.”
What is to be said of the gratitude of human nature—how can it be
defended—after a º perusal of the subjoined letters, written
by pauper hands, and forwarded from various Unions to the “Poor
Man's Friend?” Why, they are enough to make C. C. throw down
the and bells of tra ºf philanthropy, and turn man-hater for the
rest of his life. We give the first epistle:–
-- - “St. James's Union, April 19.
“I have been an inmate of this place for three years; once
kept a comfortable house and all that, and know what the bitterness
of a Union, is, Nevertheless, Sir, I don't choose my poverty to be
made the plaything of men with the disease of popularity raging, like
the small-pox, in 'em. Let me alone, Sir. have my wretchedness,
but leave it to me: don't approach it: don't affect a sympathy with it
to mum the part of benefactor, even as a mountebank, in his 's angled
jacket, plays on a carpet in the open street. The Poor Man's Friend!
Are you indeed that, Sir?
. “Well, then, you seek the poor in silence and solitude. It is suffi.
cient consolation to your large heart, touched with the woes—many of
'em, I fear, not altogether curable by state plaster—with the misery of
your fellow-creatures, to lessen and soothe them, content that only God
and his º should see you. That is popularity enough for you;
that is public sufficient.
“You are the Poor Man's Friend, and you do good, silently as the
dew falls to the ground * fruitful things spring up.
“No, you don't! You rattle your soup-kettle as a trading tinker
rattles his pot! You stand in the highway and bawl your benevolence;
and like a man who offers for sale a certain something to take out
spots of paint and grease from the coats of all comers, you, with your
specific, would minister to the cure of poverty, of wretchedness, and
“I won’t have it, Sir. I won’t be tried upon. I won’t have you
make experiments with my misery—leave me alone...Let, the poor
wear their tatters in quiet; why should you tog yourself in their rags
to act the philanthropist? The real Poor, Man's Friend doesn't dress
and, paint himself for the part; and why not?, Because, when he
really performs, he doesn’t call all the world to look at him.
“Yours, (about to break stones),
“John STRAIT.”
We shall give only another epistle; recommended by its brevity:-

*HE is a barrister with a subdued practice, and but littleknownbeyond

them five * this time. He issure he has seen every applewoman

a just hatred of a cabman, only to be equalled by his profound aversion
for an omnibus-conductor. He sees a poacher in every smockfrock.
All beggars he sentences to the Mill. He addresses a pickpocket as
“Sir”, and is sarcastic upon boys, calling, them “young gentlemen.”
Hºdelights in summoning overseers, and beadles, and enjoys a good

does not care, what they say of him, though he does inveigh sometimes

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 181
THE CITY TOLLs.
We feel it our duty to call the attention of the civic authorities to the
recent establishmentofarival tollatthe er of St Paul's Churchyard,
which levies contributions upon the female foot-passengers as strictly
as the Flying Pikeman at the corner of gº Lane makes his claim
upon passing yehicles. The toll at the corner of St.Paul's Churchyard
has been gradually growing into a permanent exaction during the last
twelve months, tº: may now be said to have acquired all the authorit
of long custom. ecollectºr is a black fellow—one of the º
importers of the celebrated Indian, dodge, that has inflicted so mu
loss upon our native mendicants. This impudent Malay addresses his
demand for toll to all ladies unaccompanied by gentl º who happen
to pass by him; and his mode of collection consists of a violent thrustin
of his hand into the face of the female passenger, with a sort of disma
growl, which is converted into a malignant muttering if his demand is
not complied with. - -
We are not aware of the revenue produced by this toll, or whether it
forms any part of the City funds, but the collection, is very rigorous
made, and any attempt to elude payment is almost impossible. We
have often thought the turnpike man at º: Bar tolerably resolute
in hanging onto the back of carts, clinging to the spokes of coal-waggons,
and jumping into the midst of baskets of clean linen, when the drivers
of the vehicles containing them have shown a disposition to omit the
usual fee; but we can assure the Lond MAYoR and Corporation that
their toll-collector at the corner of the City is mild, gentlemanly, and
ſorbearing in comparison with the Malay at the corner of St. Paul's
Churchyard, who pounces, something after the, to him, local fashion of
a tiger on his prey, upon all the well-dressed females, who pass, and who
seem likely to be agitated or otherwise intimidated out of their loose
silver or their halfpence.
ENGLISH SUBSTITUTES FOR GERMAN SPAS.
THE utmost consternation is beginning to prevailamong the English
habitués of the German Spas, in consequence of the probability that
all access to them will be cut off during the ensuing season; and it will
therefore be desirable to find some substitute near home, where a kind
of fashionable watering-place may be got up, presenting all the
agrémens of Baden-Baden, with all the comeatableness of a suburban
tea-garden. We understand that the proprietor of St. Chad's Well,
in Gray’s-Inn Lane-familiarly known as the Montpelier of Holborn
—has been making arrangements with a view of trying, on, a small
scale, the experiment of converting his establishment into a fashionable
Spa, combining all the attractions to be met with on the Continent.
It is well known that gambling forms one of the chief sources of
amusement at the Spas abroad; but this pastime being unpopular
among the better classes in England, it has been determined to intro:
duce at St. Chad's Well nothing in the shape of rouge-et-noir, but
simply to afford the public an opportunity of playing at the game which
turning round a sort of iron dart upon a board, which is surrounded at
certain distances by pieces of goºd wholesome British º:
The fine old Saxon Skittle will also be set up for the amusement of
the more muscular of the dilettanti; and that popular puppy, to which
our ancestors have prefixed the epithet bumble, will enable the lovers
of bumble-puppy to indulge in their favourite pastime.
We have every cºnfidence in the arrangements that are being made;
and when we consider the facilities that exist for reaching Gray’s-Inn
Lang—when we remember that threepence will transport the denizen of
the distant regions of Kensington to the New Road frontier—we feel
convinced that St. Chad will soon be restored to his old place in the
affections of the British people.
THE ART OF FIGHTING A DUEL.
“In a Parliamentary Sense.”)
BE valiant, Don't weigh your insult. The heavier it is the better.
Throw º at your opponent, and if it floors him, be quick and
er.
The legal time for the duelis uncertain. It is according to the sport
and º skill of the opponents. Sometimes it is interrupte
the first shot. |. you are very smart, you may load and fire several
imes. º, It is best, however, after an exchange or two to get some friend
o cry "Qrder.” This is the more, necessary if you are getting the
worst of it. The House will soon take up the cry. The Speaker next
interferes. He w º to you as a gentleman... You must not be
surprised at this, but talk of your honour. Leave the House instantly,
-----
first telling your man, with a pair of duelling eyes, that “he shall hear
from you.” You will be pursued, of course, by the Serjeant-at-Arms.
Don't befoolish, but follow him quietly, and be grateful to him for the
opportunity. You will be conducted to the Speaker. He will remind
you, in the most pathetic manner, of your insult. He will tell you it is
very wrong. He will insist that it does not go any further. You will
say you never meant that it should. If you insulted your opponent, it
was not personally. No; you have the highest opinion of him—you
always had, and you only intended to insult him in a parliamentary
sense. You will be cheered for this manly confession, Your opponent
will rise, and say the very same thing. He will be cheered. You will
cross over and shake hands with him... You both will be cheered
tremendously, and if you are very forgiving you can retire arm-in-arm
to finish the duel at Bºy’s, or you can adjourn it till the next
house-dinner day at the Club. -
N.B. By following these simple rules, you may fight your six duels
every session, and kill your six men easily, and be perfectly alive to
resume the sport the following year.
Royal Jealousy.
The Duke of CAMARIDGE is getting rather uneasy about the grow-
ing popularity of MR. Currey, and biºnumerºus invitations tº dinner.
His Royal Highness has given all Charities distinctly to understand,
that he will not attend where MR. Currey is invited. There has been
eat agitation down in the kitchens of the principal taverns, which
É. since spread to the drawing-rooms of May Fair. Several noble:
men have undertaken to persuade His Royal Highness to break his
resolution, on condition that Currey, comes in only at dessert. It is
feared that the Duke will reject this compromise.
* Not So GREEN As THEY LOOK.”
A porticultural paper says, “Many of the trees of Liberty will go
long before they get any leaves.” In this case it is but natural to
has been so popular for centuries at our English fairs, and consists in
suppose they will take French ones.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIWARL
HOW TO TREAT A FOREIGN PROPAGAN DIST.
WE are glad to find that the dirty long-bearded foreign ºp.;

Mr. Benjamin. I never could understand, MR. CUFFEE, why an olive
tree should have been selected as an emblem of peace. It has an
ungainly trunk, a º foliage, and a bitter fruit. It grows where no
other trees will grow; I have seen it, SIRBY, lining the bleak hill sides
of my native Syrian hills, and speckling the mangy mounds which they
call hills in Attica. BROUGHAM cultivates oil yards at his place in
Provence—a comfortable box enough, where he and I have speared a
boar many, a time, But, the Greeks were fools in their choice of
imagery. They call an olive tree peaceful, which neither gives shade
nor fruit fit to speak of ; as they call an owl wise, which only knows
how to whoop in the dark, and is a beast unfit for day-light. Peace is
a palm tree, Wisdom is the sun.
Colonel. What the deuce are

Sibby. But where would MRs. CUFFEE and her mangle have been?
Notable-cloth, no washerwoman.
Cuffee. Washin and luxuries be blowed, I say. What I want is that
every man should have a bellyful, and (here’s my health, to you,
Colonel) that there should be no superfluities. I say we aye advictuals
and drink enough to support twenty men. Look at this table and all this
your 3. This year gilt fork (don't be afraid, I ain't a * to prig
it, Colonel) would keep a family for a week. You’ve got a lozen of
'em. Why j I once ad two teaspoons marked with a C;
but that was in appier times, and they are separated now. Why are
you to ave dozens? What ave you done for’em? You toil not, neither
do you spin. You ain’t a SoLoMon in all 3. glory, certainly. You
are no better than me; why should you be better hoff And not you
only, but, those that is higher than you. . The time has come for doing
away with these superfluities, and that’s the great Principles of Free-
dom. Your health, Citizen.
Mr. Dizzy. If our friend the Colonel had no security for his spoons,
those articles, which are indeed very elegant, would lose half their
worth. My horse may be worth twenty pounds in London now; but
if I am certain that the Government will take possession of him
to mount the cavalry, my tenure in the brute becomes hazardous, and
his value instantly drops. And º you were to make a i.
distribution of all the spoons in the kingdom—what would happen
next? He would exchange his silver for bread; that is, the man who
had the most bread would come into possession of the most spoons, as
now. Would you commence the process over again? You propose an
absurdity, MR. CUFFEE., No: our friend and host has as good a right
to his forks as to his teeth; and may he long use both in the discussion
of his meals.
Mr. Cuffee. The law of man and nature is—that a man should live,
and that he is as good as his neighbour. No honest Chartist wants
your rights, he only wants his own. The Aristocracy have managed
matters for us so badly: have made themselves so rich and us so poor,
by managing for us, that now we’re determined to manage for ourselves.
We can’t be worse—
Mr. Dizzy. Yes, I say you can.
Mr. Cuffee. I say, again, we can’t be worse: and that we are the
strongest, and mean to have it. We’ll come down in the might of our
millions, and say we will be heard—we will be represented—we will be
fed—or if not—
. Mr. Dizzy. That's your Convention talk, CUFFEE-don't talk to us
in that way. . - -
. Sibby. No, no, Iº may wish it, and you may wish you may get it; but
since the 10th, I think that cock won’t fight—Ay, my boy? Say,
wasn’t that a glorious sight, MR. DooDLE, to see a people rally round
their Queen in the ãº. the citizens did P
Gentleman from P. Rally round the Queen! You would have had
to go to Osborne to do that. - - -
Čuffee (with a satirical air). Where His Royal Highness, the Prince,

Dizzy. Pish! The flag-staff was here, on Buckingham Palace arch,

dear Sir, Monarchy is but a symbol, by which we represent Union,
Order, and Property. -

Dizzy. And we can rally round a stick, just as well, as a living sove-
reign. The times are gone by when kings, turned out with white
*...* and tilted, against their enemies, like so many dragoons.
Would you have had HER MAJESTY, on a side-saddle, haranguing the
police, and His Royal Highness the Prince carrying a baton f
Cuffee. He is a Field-Marshal, ain’t he
Sibby. Ha, ha! Had him there, CUFFEE |
Dizzy. His Royal Highness is, so to speak, only an august ceremony.
He is an attendant upon the Ark of the Monarchy; we put that out of
danger when commotions menace us.
Cºffee. If a stick would do as well as a sovereign, why not have one?
It don't cost as much—it never dies. It might be kep in a box lined
with erming, and have a stamp at the end, to sign the warrants. And
it might be done for less than four hundred thousand a year.
Gentleman from P. We can do it for less in our country—our
President, MR. Polk, for instance. -
Dizzy...Your president, MR. Polk, cost, you a Mexican war: how
º millions of dollars is that ? If in this country we were to have
an election every year, a struggle for the President’s chair every three
§. men taking advantage of the excitement of the day, and out-
idding each other on the popular cry, we should lose in mere money,
ten times as much as the Sovereign costs us. Look over the water at
your beloved France, MR. CUFFEE.
Cuffee. Weeve la liberty (drinks).
, Dizzy. They have already spent two hundred millions of our money
in getting rid of old ULYsses. What is the value of the daily produce
of a nation? When MR. CUFFEE is professionally occupied, he earns—
how much shall we say?
Cºffee. Say five bob a day, you won't be far wrong; and here's your
Dizzy. He loses thirty shillings every week, then, that he does not
work; and either of free will or necessity spends it. If he does not
work himself, if he prevents. others from working, if he frightens
customers, our worthy friend ties the hands of labour, and stops the
growth of bread.
Cuffee. You mean § all these grand phrases that there will be a
convulsion, during which the labour of the country will stop tem-
porary P-of course there will. But then see how much better we
shall be after, and how much, freer, to work! Why, give us our six

ASTRONOMICAL AMUSEMENTS.
PASSION WEEK has restored to us, as usual, our old friend ADAMs,
with his canvas solar system, his spermaceti stars, his oil moon, his
gas sun, and his rushlight satellites. We are always delighted to
meet with him every year, but we hope, for his sake, that the astrono-
mers will give him breathing-time; for discoveries are now going on
so rapidly, that it costs him a little mint per annum in adding new
planets if he is compelled to at the rate of the last
O on ºlº;
four or five seasons, the thing will never pay; for he was, in 1847, com-
pelled to augment his astronomical establishment, and this present Lent
we find him advertising no less than—“FIVE NEw PLANETs.”
If we were in ADAMS's place we would get beforehand with the
|astronomers, and stick on a dozen new planets at once, in anticipation
of what may be brought to light during the ensuing lustrum; for we
understand that his planet manufacturer will charge no more for making
a dozen or so while his hand is in, than he would for producing a
solitary star if ordered separate. We believe the principle of a single
comet at the wholesale price does not prevail, but that if is with con-
stellations as with kid gloves, and other articles of ordinary traffic—a
reduction on taking a quantity.
A HUMBLE ATTEMPT TO ILLUSTRATE THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.
There is only one thing wanting to give completeness, to the Pro-
fessor’s exhibition, and that is some appropriate music; but we have
every reason to believe that he will form an arrangement for introducing
the original music of the spheres at his next year's entertainment.

The first day he met a troop of his own countrymen. Their wives and children were with
them; they were in tears. “We have been expelled,” said one of the men, “because we
are Englis men; our wages.have not been º to us, and we have lost all our instruments.
The money we had put into the Savings Banks has even been denied to us: we have nothing
but, charity to depend upon.”. The gentleman would scarcely believe his senses. “I have
º º * he said, after giving them a trifle; “surely this is not what they call
iberty?” -
.The second day he read a circular of a Minister of Instruction, in which electors were
directed to choose those men whose greatest recºmmendation was their ignorange—not talent,
nor wealth, nor character, nor pºsition were to be a Member's qualifications; but ignorance,
and the greater, the better. He said nothing, but thought to himself, “Hum! this is
strange Liberty.”
The third day he
met bands of º: ſº the streets of Paris. Their occupation
was to break the windows of those who would not illuminate. Hº they went from house to
house, insisting upon a blaze of tallow candles and lampions. He, who refused had not, the
next moment, an unsmashed eleſ; in his house. He was astonished, and wondered if
Liberty had ever been viewed in this light before?
The fourth day he attended a large meeting
of workmen. . He sympathised with them when
they talked of their wrongs. His heartbeat for
them when they vowed that all they wanted was
justice. They went in a body to their master's
factory. He followed them. They unrolled
their grievances. They must have doublewages;
they must work less; they must have a share in
the profits of the concern. The master could
not yield these demands. “Very well,” said the
foreman, “you must close your doors;” and a
guard was appointed, to º: any workman
entering the factory. The Englishman's face
lengthened, and his head dropſ, as he heard
* proceedings coupled with the name of
iberty.
The fifth day he paid a visit to, a Democratic
Club. He expected to heartheloftiest patriotism,
the noblest sentiments of humanity. A long:
bearded gentleman was speaking. He claimed
equality of riches; everything should be in
common; same wages, same profits, same every:
thing. The wealthy should give to the poor; if
not, the poor had a right to take from the
wealthy. The Provisional Committee were all
traitors. France would not be free before every
aristºcrat's head was rolling in the dust. The
Englishman shuddered at these new notions
of equality. He inquired who the speaker was.
He was informed in a whisper, “A convicted spy
of the late Government.” He could not help
looking with suspicion on this fiery apostle of
Liberty. However, it was mere talk, he thought;
but he was astonished, the next day, to hearthat
20,000 men had assembled in the Champ de
Mars, to listen to this º and that they
had proceeded to the Hotel de Wille, to demand
fresh concessions. These were granted; and the
Englishman began to doubt whether this was the
best way of proving the holy rights of Liberty.
The sixth day he was amused with the uni-
versal plantation of trees. This was harmless
enough, and the Englishman qmly smiled at the
sport. “May they alſbear good fruit!” he said;
but in the º of the night the rappel was
sounded, the streets were in alarm; the Govern:
ment was overturned; Paris was inflames; and
many other reports equally agreeable, but
equally untrue. The Englishman went to bed
again, only too glad to hear it was a false
alarm; but the same thing, was repeated the
following night, and the º: after that; and
he came to the conclusion there must be some-
thing the matter with Liberty, since she passed
such restless nights. -
The following morning the Englishman packed
up. He had seen enough of Liberty to last
him all his life. He is now in England, and has
e up his mind never to leave it again; not,
at all events, before the Liberty it enjoys ceases
to be a practice, and becomes, a mad.imprac-
ticable theory. Since his arrival in London,
he has drawn up the following programme of
Liberty:-
There are different kinds of Liberty.
There is the Liberty of smashing windows.
There is the Liberty of not paying your rents.
There is the Liberty of not doing anything,
and receiving afranca-day for it. -
There is the Liberty of seizing upon railways
which do not belong to you. ...
There is the Liberty of the Bank to suspend
cash payments.
here is, likewise, the º of kicking any
foreigner out of the country, who is cleverer than
yºurself, to say nothing of the tº
of playing at *† and at soldiers, an
º about Liberty, and a host of
other.Liberties, which are freely taken without
the slightest degree of Liberty.
Our Englishman says, however, and we must
admire his good sense, that he would not ex-
change all those Liberties, popular as they may
be in Paris, for the simple one of order and Peace
which he enjoys in England.

LONDON CHARIVARI.
“IT is our OPENING DAY.”
*ON Monday the first of May, the Royal Academy consented to open
included. The rush of artists was well sustained this year, and the
numerous falls on the staircase proved once more the powerful truth,
that the greatest genius is apt to fall when he attempts too bold aflight.
The admission to the Academy is a most slipperything, and many an
artist, who thinks that he is just on the point of entering, finds the
door-handle slip through his disappointed fingers, and that he is driven
back for another year. Several, *. get up again, not at all hurt
by their fall, and, mounting º by step, rise at last to the very top of
the Academy, going far beyond the very men who first excluded them.
The forty R.A.'s have earned the reputation of being dreadful “exclu-
sives,” and we must say the hard raps they have received for shutting
their doors in the face of rising talent, have not been given without a
very good handle. But we intend to pay a “bobbing”, visit to this
Royal Exhibition, and then we shall be able to report whether it is a
good shilling's-worth, or whether it is not worth a rush.
º One thing is certain: there issure to be plenty for the money; but
that is a recommendation which ought to be limited solely to stale
pastry. These Pictures of the English, painted by Themselves, ought to
be F. gratuitously. They certainly manage these things better
in France, and we never recollect hearing of an instance of a gamin
cutting up with his penknife the portrait of any one at the Louvre, or

A PETITION FROM PETER PINDAR THE THIRD,
TO MR. PUNCH.
Sovereign of all the jesters, autocrat
More dread than Russia's emperor barbaric,
We humbly beg thee on the back to pat,
And set up in thy type this lay Pindaric.
A Scot once met a Briton, each a sticker
For his own country's fame—their names you’ll pardon-
And the two fools debated o'er their liquor
The merits of a Scotch and English garden.
Sawney maintained, with slow enunciation,
“So help him good ST. ANDREw at his need,
That plums and peaches never reached perfection
Or near it, one Scotch furlong south of Tweed.”
The burly Briton swore with native wrath,
By all a Briton’s oaths—I won't repeat'em-
“As for all wall-fruit from the starving North,
Burn his old breeches, if a pig would eat 'em.”
*Twas clear the case could not thus be decided,
Each backed through thick and thin his own avowals;
Their swords were out, all compromise derided,
And SawNEY ran the Briton through the bowels.
Repenting when too late, and on his knees,
Bent on consoling to his utmost power,
“Freend, Iforgot,” howls Sawney, “to premeese
I like them vera hard and vera’sour.”
“Friend,” replies BULL, “I’m glad there’s enough life in me
To tell you that I quite forgive your haste;
But why the devil, ere you stuck your knife in me,
Didn't you tell me your outlandish taste?”
Sire! such a time as ours your wisdom craves,
For every man has need of his seven senses,
When all the fools at home, and foreign knaves
Would goad John Bull to break down his good fences.
We therefore pray your witship, ere we quarrel,
And send conciliation to the right about,
To knockinto your lieges' heads this moral,
For Heav'n's sake first to settle what they fight about.
IMPORTANT LEGAL DECISION.
In a case the other day, in the Court of Common Pleas, MR. Justice
MAULE laid it down with considerable learning and acuteness, that a
tiger or any other wild beast is decidedly distrainable for rent. This is
a “real blessing to landlords,” who have only to take advantage of the
clause in the Act, to seize the claws in the tiger, if the livery of seisin
does not happen to be anticipated by the animal himself. As to the
hyaena, we are quite sure that he would take care to defeat the statute
in his own peculiarly pleasant manner, by laughing the plaintiff, as
hyaenas will, completely out of court. We believe that a bear may also
be taken for debt, unless, he comes over the creditor's attorney by that
species of º in which bears are frequently skilled.
We have it likewise on excellent authority, that if A. owes B. money,
and Axis owner of an elephant, B. may detain the elephant's trunk till
the debt is paid; and it is also tolerably clear in all, the books, that a
boa-constrictor §: dormant, as if dead, in a deal box, is recoverable
by an action on the case; but if the plaintiff mixes himself up with the
boa-constrictor, so as to identify himself with it, he, the plaintiff, will
not be recoverable at all. If the boa-constrictor should unfold his tail
early enough, the plaintiff may have a severance; but otherwise, says
MR. Justice MAULE, he must inevitably be quashed.
The Soyer Sauce. -
M. SoYER has invented a new sauce-a day or two ago there was a
magnificent article upon it in the Chronicle, written by MR. DisrAELI-
a new sauce of such wondrous power that with it Colonel, SIBTHORP
has already professed himself ready to swallow the Charter!

STREET-FIGHTING.
FROM along ºr. General-in-Chief of the Artille
of Wit, and Commander of the Forces of Humour,
am enabled to give some suggestions upon the practice
of Street-Fighting. I do not recommend the plan
roposed by some of my contemporaries, and by some
#: maniacs in Dublin, who would throw down
their º wash-hand-stands, looking-glasses,
bedsteads, and other furniture, on the troops, or the
rioters, as the case may be; but I think there is
another mode of warfare to be adopted, which would
have a wonderful effect in keeping down an excited
multitude. I should propose, in the first instance,
throwing up a breast-work of four-pounders—I mean
four-pound loaves—and I would then call over the
muster-roll, by mustering all the rolls I could lay my hands upon. This I should lookupon as the very
flour of my army; and I am convinced that the force would be quite sufficient to keepingheck aparty
of insurgents, who, receiving the four-pounders in their stomachs, would get what is vulgarly called
a bellyful. would recommen
that these forces, should be well
flanked up by a division of BARCLAY
and PERKINs's Heavies, and I am
sure that the united force would be
irresistible.
With reference to artillery for
street purposes, I am prepared to
advise the use of the pop-gun on a
igantic scale, which should be
oaded up to its muzzle with grape
—in the shape of wine—and with
ammunition of various kinds, such as balls of forced-meat, blades of the bones of shoulders of mutton,
and other effective missiles. It is certain that if the disaffected were to be met in this way, they
would very soon be satisfied, or in other words, have had quite enough of it. Barrels of beer would

be more efficacious than barrels of gunpowder, and nothing would be easier than to secure the ring-
leaders, if they had been well played upon by the double-barrelled force I have suggested. These are
the chief points in the system of street strategy recommended by 39Cſ2Cº.
MERRY MAY IN PARLIAMENT.
MAY was never before so busy in Par-
liament. The Whigs—who may now be
considered the political sweeps of the
country—promised a capital show on the
lst. Jack-IN-THE-GREEN Russell was
blithe and confident as ever; º:
about as though clothed in immo
laurel. Then the CHANCELLOR of THE
Exchequerrattled the box for the Indian
Loan; then there was the hornpipe (with
Whig double-shuffle) of the Aliens Bill;
then Merry May brought up the Jews
to have their Disabilities removed; a
then Lord MoRPETH was to go on blowing
the Soap-and-Water Bubbles Bill. On
the 15th we are to have the Navigation
Laws set right. Indeed, everything seems
reserved for May. We have no doubt,
however, that she will contrive to defer
much of her business until August, when
LoRD Russell will observe, that it being
too late in the Session to do anything-
(hot weather and all that)—why, the
House will adjourn to the º
Having killed nothing but time in the
Commons, honourable Members are then
º justified in looking for game else-
wnere.
We Beg to Apologise.
MonstEUR MICHELET, amongst many
other new truths thrown..down upon
England, says—"No Englishman...ever
had an idea,” Now we take the liberty
to state that we had once an idea, which
was that Monsteur Michelet was a
yery clever, sensible man. Now that idea,
it is clear, had no right to come into the
head of an Englishman, and we willingly
retract it. We confess our error. We
cannot account for it, and promise
Monsieur Miche LET, as we love ideas
of justice, that we will never entertain an
idealike it again.
THE NOBLE ART OF FRATERNISING:
BY LEDRU-ROLLIN.
NoTHING easier. You must help yourself first, and
thing left, help your brothers. The best bonds of brotherhood are
Treasury Bonds, so collect as many as you can. Self-preservation
is the first law of Nature, which means that you must take the best
care of yourself. If SMITH has £30,000, you, as his brother, are
clearly entitled to half of it. Communism means share and share alike:
so, if ROTHSCHILD has a thousand railway shares, you are fairly entitled
to five hundred of them.
For perfect happiness society should have but one opinion, and of
course that opinion should be your own. What right has anybody else
to force his opinion upon you? Freedom of speech, when translated,
means persons being at liberty to think as you think. If every one
was to have a separate view and interest, and to think for himself, what-
ever would become of the noble principle of Equality?... You are bound
to relieve all workmen, and if they are English or foreigners, their
claims are all the stronger, so do your best to relieve them of their
tools and wages; and if the wretches murmur, tell them to leave the
country instantly, for they are not worthy to participate in the blessings
of Fraternity. If they are not convinced, mind force is better than
persuasion; one bayonet is sharper than a thousand arguments.
There must be a master-mind in all things. Prove this, especially at
elections, where the candidates should be your choice and not the
electors’. Communism is all very well, but, like writing, it is liable to
fewer errors, when guided by dictation. Think of your country, of
course—don't forget the sacred claims of your brothers; but there is
no true Fraternity unless you think of yourself first. A rainy day may
come, and you are a fool if you do not provide for it; for there was
never a brother yet, that would lend another an umbrella.

Heavy Blow at the Church.
“ON Thursday, the 27th inst,” says the Morning Post, “the advowson
of Clevely, near Newmarket, was put up to public competition, at the
|Auction Mart.” Well may the French believe that we sell our wives at
| Smithfield, when we vend the right of appointment to the cure of souls.
“It was knocked down,” adds our contemporary, “for £5950, which
was below the reserved price.” It is a pity that this variety of the
| game of “knock-em-downs” should be legal. Of all the blows that are
struck at the Church, none are likely to be more injurious than those of
the auctioneer's hammer. -

The Cochrane Doll.
MR. CHARLEs CochRANE has so nobly distinguished himself in his
attempt to make personal notoriety out of the poverty of other people,
that a very high and significant compliment has been paid to these
efforts by sundry humble dealers. The Black Doll has been taken down
from the shops, and an effigy of CochRANK hung in its place, with this
notice (containing the whole gist of the CochRANE philosophy)—“Here
the greatest price is given for old rags.”
Gutta Percha Again!
IN spite of our remonstrances last week, we have received another
joke on the above subject. A correspondent recommends all special
constables and soldiers to wear boots and shoes made of Gutta Percha,
for, in the event of a riot in the dog-days, it will enable them better
than anything else to stick to their flags. We declare, contributions like
these are enough to make us turn Communists, for then all dullards
would be obliged to share their jokes equally, instead of their being
| inflicted in their weighty entirety upon us. We ask the reader if the
| above isn't too bad?

THE MODEL WIFE.
SHE, never comes down to breakfast, in curl-papers. She does not
mble if her husband brings a friend home to dinner, even if “there
is nothing in the house”. She does not remonstrate if her husband
puts his feet on the steel fender, or cry if he does not wipe his boots
on the door-mat. She subscribes to no circulating library, and if she
reads a novel, she falls asleep overit. She is proficientin pies, and has

a deepºknowledge of puddings. She never talks politics; or “wish
that she were dead,” or “a man;” or slam the doors, or shut herself
* in her bedroom on the plea of a “nervous headache.” She is very
slow in tears, and a stout heretic as to hysterics. She allows a dog
to be kept in the house. She goes to church, but not to criticise the
bonnets. She is not above descending into the kitchen to get “some-
thing warm” for supper. She allows a fire in the bedroom on a wintry
night. She has a quickeye for dust, but does not martyr her husband
with continual complaints about the servants, nor worry herself to
death for a man in livery, or a page in buttons. She can walk, and
without thin shoes, or a JEAMEs to follow her. She prefers table-
beer to wine, and does not ſaint at the idea of grog, or in fact, faint
at all. She never sees that it is necessary to go out of town “for the
dear children's health.” It is true she follows the fashions; but then
it is at several years’ distance. She has the smallest possible affection
or jewellery, and makes the sweet children's frocks out of her old
dresses. She is never “delicate,” and would scorn to send for the
doctor because she is “a little low.” She never tells her husband
when any of her friends have got a new bonnet, or exclaims with en-
thusiasm that she saw “such a lovely cachemere in the City yesterday,”
and then rhapsodise on the smallness of the price. She never opens her
husband's letters, and preserves her wedding-gown with a girlish reve-
rence. She is not miserable if she stays in town on the Ascot Day,
nor do penance in the back parlour if she does not go out of town when
the season is over. She mends stockings, and makes unexceptionable
º and pickles. She does not refuse to go out with her husband
ecause she hasn’t a good gown. She asks for money sparingly, and
would sooner “eat her head off” than make anything out of the
*:::::::::g She always dresses for dinner. She never hides the
latch-key. She rarely flirts, and it makes her toogiddy to waltz, even
with an officer.
The Model Wife always sits up for her husband, to the most unmatri-
monial hours; and still she does not look black, or say “He’s killing
her,” though he should bring daylight in with him, or even come home
with the “milk.” She hangs over the little bit of fire, watching the
mantelpiece clock, alarmed by every sound, jumping up at every cab,
shivering and sleepy, her only companions during the long night the
mice in the cupboard, or a stray blackbeetle, and her only occupation the
restless fear lest her husband should not come home safe. She cries
sºmetimes, but never before him; and, above all-hear it, allye Wives
ºf England—she does not Cauple Lecture him when she gets him
inside the curtains and knows there is no escape for him!
TO THE UNEMPLOYED.
E have read, with the combined attention of the philoso-
pher and theº: a little book that, gay as a
summer butterfly, has just fluttered from the press.
The book is called Sketches ºf Her Majesty's House-
hold; and, among otherintoxicating intelligence, the
work professes to be A Guide to Situations in the
Queen's Domestic Establishment / A very solemn
little tome, it must be confessed, is this. Common
ºl. and mere, printer's blackness, are indeed too
vulgar for its sublime purpose. Its leaves ought to
be of the vellum of the sheep that grew the golden
fleece; and conserve of the hearts of Maids-of-Honour
should be its ruddy ink. However, it is not so;
the book is, notwithstanding, a nice little book that,
helped by the imagination of true loyalty, will gleam a libro d'oro.
ith so many worthy men and women out of employment, Punch is
desirous to show to those who want places, how many excellent situa-
tions are to be had in the Royal Household; situations with this double
recommendation, namely, a high salary and nothing to do. We are not
aware of any kind of post that can offer to man or woman a more
eligible investment of temporary attention.
In the first place, there is the post of Lord Chamberlain. His duty
is, we believe, to carry a stick in his fingers; to wear a latch-key of the
door of the back-stairs at his button-hole; and always, on state occasions,
to walk backwards. The salary for doing this is-É2000 per annum.
In 1805, the place—held by the EARL of DARTMouth—was only £1200
a year; but, the Aristocracy having struck for an advance, the wages are
now The duties of the post being made easy to the commonest
understanding, noman's modesty need standin the way of his preferment.
The Vice-Chamberlain is engaged as a sort of double; taking the
Chamberlain's post when absent on his own business. This post (salary
£924 per annum) is well adapted for any tº: gentleman
of leisurely habits. No talent of any sort required.
know his right hand from his left, and keep his thumb from his mouth.
e must, however,
The Lords-in-Waiting have £702 each per annum, with the run of the
Royal box at the opera and º: hey do nothing; and are often
much puzzled to get through their work.
The Master of the Ceremonies, in addition to the Chamberlains, has
£300; and would be a very nice addition to the income of any young
man of good deportment. -
Gentlemen-Ushers, Grooms, Serjeants, Table-deckers, Kings-at-Arms
Heralds, are all well º of the unemployed; whose leisure would
in no way be interfered with by an appointment to either post.
Toaretired sportsman the Master of the Buckhounds would be avery
eligible situation; inasmuch as he is not required to hunt above four or
five weeks in the season; for which he is paid £1700 per annum;
besides being free of all turnpikes. The Master has a very handsome
turn-out; the expense of the establishment averaging between £6000
and £7000 a year, and triumphantly showing how much of the people's
money goes to the dogs.
The Hereditary Grand Falconer. This is a very eligible situation for
any person of genteel exterior. The salary is £1200 a year. Not a
single hawk is kept; but the Falconer is expected, oncertain state-days,
to give toast to the parrots!
The Keeper of the Queen's Privy Purse is a very nice post, indeed,
for any respectable young man; good security is of course required.
The salary is £2000 per annum. This is as it ought to be. Honesty,
like all other good things, is not to be bought except at a high price.
Hence, the Keeper of the Purse is removed from all temptation, by
having £2000 a-year for only taking care of it. -
The Governor and Constable of Windsor Castle would be a capital
appointment for a º man; only it is at present in the possession of
PRINCE ALBERT., Vulgar...people, might imagine that his Royal
Highness would have no objection to swear himself in as a continual
special constable to take care of his own. house gratis; . oy
Highness, however, knows the worth of fidelity; and hence (in addition
to his £30,000) receives £1120 per annum with the constable's staff of
Windsor Castle!
The Ranger of Windsor Home Park would be a pleasant post for
any man with no objection to the country. PRINCE ALBERT, however,
being particularly fond of the Home Park, takes £500 a-year for
warning people “off the grass.” -
We shall not number the many situations conducing to the real
strength and glory of the Crown, to be found in thisinestimable volume.
Punch recommends it to the earnest study of the true and loyal. The
writer attempts to show (very unsuccessfully, as Punch thinks) that
easily enough a sum of £29,104 might be saved to the country without
“interfering, in the most trifling manner, with either the domestic
comforts and conveniences, or the necessary state ceremonies, of the
sovereign of this country.” Punch thinks the suggestion very disloyal.
The true strength of the British Constitution is in the money it costs
us. Make Government cheap, and you make it contemptible.

A Suggestion for the new Statue of Liberty, to be erected at Paris.
RAILWAY REPUBLICANISM.
THE monarchy of KING HUDson is at an end; the iron
crown is torn from his brow; and his supremacy over
the world of lo-comotion has been extinguished by a
very low-commotion indeed. He made an attempt to
abdicate in favour of his son, the PRINCE of RAILs,
and called out the whole of the 'Light Stokers; but they,
having fraternised with the Guards, a rush was made
into the refreshment-room, where a Provisional Govern-
ment was declared. The immediate cause of the out-
break was the refusal of KING Hudson to recognise any:
body or anything, and his determination to throw himself
upon the line. Every attempt to move him ºf
proved fruitless, a general agitation ensued, whic
extended even to the sleepers, some of whom were torn
out of their beds by the insurgents, who sent a great
moral engine as a vehicle of progress, to inform persons
in every station that the HUDson monarchy was at an
end. The Secretary, who had hitherto been on the Civil
List. sent in his immediate adhesion to the new order
of things, and the whole of the clerks, being very
anxious to retain, office, fraternised with the railway
people against their late king.
othing has yet been decided as to the new style
of Government, but a Directory has been spoken of as
the most obvious form to adopt. The engine-drivers
have resolved on driving matters to the utmost extremity,
and crowds of railway porters are rushing about fran-
tically in all directions, singing The Steam Arm, which
corresponds among them with the famous Chant du
Départ of France. The electric telegraph is in the hands
of the revolutionists, and the Chemin de Fer has become
a perfect Chenin d'Enfer, for everything is going in that
direction as fast as it can.
THE DAY-SLEEPER.
“SomerHING Must BE Done.” Such is the “great
fact” which every newspaper has lately, discovered;
such is the strong conviction of every sensible man who
|is fond of order, and averse to riots and revolutions; and
such doubtlessly was the soliloquy of every special con-
|stable on the 10th of April, after a ten hours' duty. But
LoRp John Russell hears the national cry, and twirls
his thumbs. He is rather prepared to admit that “some;
thing” ought to be done, but has not made up his mind
yet what that “something” shall be. His eyes are rivetted
º upon the ceiling, and he is ready to rush to the House
of Commons as soon as the inspiration comes down
upon him. In the meantime, the minutes of “Finality”

are numbered; if not, the days of Whig Government
soon will be, though we know that Finality is, the very
last thing which a Whig Government is likely to sur-
render. “Finality,” in the Russell vocabulary, means
“Government without end.”

THE "Special Polka” is announced, addressed to the loyal Special
Constables of the nation. Every Special is requested to present his
wife, daughter, or sister with a copy, if only to commemorate the
glorious 10th, We trust, that though the dandies of the 10th “don’t
dance,” the Specials of the 10th, do, and that the leader's bâton will
keep, the dancers “moving on” to the strains of his composition,
which may well be called a Polka, for it is adapted to stir the fires of
patriotism in the coldest heart.

they furnished him on Eas er Moºdy with water enough to start half-
a-dozen waterfalls at once, and place him as a permanent cataract in the
public eye immediately afterwards. He compares himself to a flake of
snow, which, barring the whiteness, is an apt comparison, for he dis-
solves with wondrous rapidity; and, as snow brings to our mind the
ancient image of the old woman picking the feathers out of her goose,
the number of white feathers CochRANE has displayed are suggested to

ORNITHOLOGICAL REVERSE OF FORTUNE.
WE imagine the
Austrian Eagle,
which but two
months ago held
its two heads so
high in Italy, must
at present be ra-
ther crest-fallen.
Pulled off its offi-
cial perch in Mi-
lan, left without a
single eyrie
through Lombar-
dy, it must be at
present in rather
reduced circum-
stances. " It has
not even the con-
solation of presid-
ing in its old age
over a tobacco
warehouse, or the
| poor resource of
| selling a pack of
- E. cards, two
ranches of trade
from which it for-
merly derived its
principal income.
All monopoly has
been snatched
- - -- - from its rapacious
claws, and we doubt even if it has the common comfort of a pinch of
snuff, which was another of its revenues, when it was in high feather.
This is proper retribution for having made the Italian people pa
through the nose for their common necessaries. It is a question, wit
many, whether this imperial bird of prey is now alive. Some say it was
ashamed to wing its way back to Austria, and has flown to England,
where it is hiding its double head in some miserable'garret near Hanover
§guare. Its principal amusement is to screech revengefully at the
Brunswick Hotel, since the PRINCE METTERNICH has arrived in this
Cºuntry. It had better offer its services to the Coliseum, where it might
fill the place on Mont Blanc, which has been vacant since the death of
the late lamented eagle.

A NARROW ESCAPE.
: There, from morning until noon
We beg to congratulate Westminster Bridge on the very marrow
escape it has lately had ; for if the Chartist Petition had really passed
ºver it, it never could have survived the severe shaking. The tremen-
dous weight of that document, even with one-fifth of its supposed
signatures, must have broken it down. The tottering old bridge must
have sunk for ever into its “native element”—we mean, of course, the
water, for it has been more in water than out of it all its life. Might
we ask as a favour of MR. CochRANE, and others who devote their waste
hours to arranging processions and collecting pickpockets, to choose
Westminster Bridge as the next place for their meeting? By these
means two nuisances might be º down at the same time, and MR.
QochRANE's ardour might be so far damped as to prevent him plunging
for some time into the turbid stream of §: Thus Westminster
Bridge may supply the place of the old ducking-stool that used to be
tried formerly, in its very neighbourhood, on those who were convicted
of libellous or, tºo much talking. Thames water would prove an
admirable cure for all rabid spouters. It would be the first time, also,
for many years, that Westminster Bridge had been connected with
anything like Public Safety.

With petition setting forth all the workhouse wrong. .
“Ho!” cried CoCKRoACH to himself, “won't I come it strong!”
CockRoach twirled his thumbs,
Fruitlessly expecting arrivals from the slums.
Hard it rained; the clouds on his scheme cold water threw,
Plenty of police were there, ragamuffins few.
CoCKROACH in an º chaise them at length did mount,
Some three hundred vagabonds, near as one might count,
Cheering him ; hard words to use much our heart it grieves
But most of them in sooth were boys, principally thieves.
Onward CockRoach took his way, follow’d by a van,
Showing forth, in loathsome daub, the wrongs of the Poor Man.
Verily thy taste was good, feeling was thy heart, -
CocKRoach, thus to blazon thine advertising cart.
Down the Street of Panton rolled, with motion slow,
Chaise and van; fast after, the mob were fain to go;
But a body of police, arm'd with trusty staves,
Forming straight across the way, stopp'd the ragged knaves.
To Cockspur Street thro’ Haymarket. CockRoACH crawl'd along,
Hiss'd, and groan'd, and hooted by “Specials” in the throng,
#ousekeepers from first-floor fronts on his head let fall
Gibes and execrations; that, luckily, was all.
No encouragement had he, not a single cheer,
Save from some few cab-drivers much the worse for beer:
Thirstily drank CockRoACH the plaudits of the sots;
Not with greater zest did they drain their pewter pots.
At the Street of Cockspur again the mob essay’d
In his wake to follow; again their course was stay’d,
Like a kennel in its current, by the men of A, 5
First division of police, under MR. MAY.
Round the Union Club he doubled, # Trafalgar Square. -
Cock Roach, certes thou hadst face, if thou couldst showit there.
Halting, “Fellow Countrymen!” his speech he then began ;
They, being chiefly constables, wouldn’t hear the man.
On came the merry men of A, the ragamuffins flew.
“Now then, move on, Sir, if you please,” cried the men in blue.
“This won’t do, we can't allow no more of this here gab.”
'Gainst the steeds of CocKROACH here ran a hackney-cab.
Thus was luckless CockRoach brought unto a stand;
Round his carriage closed the constabulary band.
Grievously they chaffed him, the “Specials” and the A:
“What right had you to come round here?” quoth Inspector MAY.
When from its entanglement his vehicle was freed,
Again was hapless CockRoAcH permitted to proceed. -
His van had gone without him, to the Green Yard it was said.
CockRoach, thy advertisement ill indeed hath sped!
Once more when our Cock Roach passed Messrs. Drummond's Bank,
All athwart the thoroughfare the blue-coats formed in rank:
Thus he went to Downing Street, unsuccessful quack!
With no rabble, after all, following at his back.
When he reached the Home Office, no SIR GEORGE GREY was there;
He left his sham petition to an under-porter's care.
: I think I’d better now go home,”, he to his friends did say.
“Upon our word we think you had,” wisely answer'd they.
CockRoach left without a tail, turned his steeds about,
*Mid some fifty urchins, who raised a scornful shout.
Thus his demonstration contemptibly did end;
Thus derision evermore humbug doth attend.

GREAT MEETING OF PETTICOAT PATRIOTS.
BRITISH MANUFACTURES! |
BSTERDAY, a very important Meeting was
held at WILLis's Rooms—a meeting
attended by, all the beauty and fashion
(they invariably go together) of Londºn:
The great object of this most interesting
gathering of the season was to receive
pledges—the deepest and tenderest—from
the ladies assembled, with respect to the
necessary encouragement of all articles
of British manufacture. (We sent our
own reporter to attend the meeting; but,
as it seems, he had, Mr. private business
of his own, to call on his way at the offices
of MEssRs. SHADRACH, MEsHACH, and
ABEDNEgo, he was unaccountably detained
by those gentlemen; and, strange to say,
has not been altogether himself since.
We are therefore indebted to the fra-
- - ternal feelings of the Morning Post for
the flimsy copy containing a true report of the proceedings.)
LADY DE Tissue was called to the Chair, which she filled. Her
Ladyship—odd as it may appear—in very few words explained the object
of the *..."; They had met together to #. a blow to the foreigner.
The French Revolution had wiped Paris from the world; that mag-
nificent city had been discharged from the map of Europe like a claret-
stain from damask. (Hear.) LoRD BRough AM had assured her (Great
laughter)—her Ladyship begged to say she was not aware that there was
anything in the name of that great man to provoke mirth—his Lordship
had informed her that what was once Paris was now unpetit fumier. (Cries
of “Dear me /*). The Tuileries, where they had all jº. -
—where LoRD BROUGHAM had always put up his carpet-bag—was
crushed, smashed, broken to bits like a chima tea-pot!... (Symptoms of
hysteria.) The trade of France was gone! No lace—no silks—no bijou-
terie—no, not even a bit of virtu to be had for love or money!, (Cries
of “Well, I never?”) Such being the case, it behoved them, as
patriotesses to take care of themselves., Lyons being abolished, th;
must, as true Englishwomen feeling for their country, go to Spitalfields!
They could moreover still effect a tie of sisterhood in the ribands of
Coventry! (Faint cheers), Valenciennes, worked into such historical
associations in its beautiful laces, was ruined—gone like a dropt stitch
—in which case they must go to-2
A Worce. Brussels?
The CHAIRwoMAN. Certainly; Belgium being still a monarchy, they
might still go to Brussels. Her La yship, concluding a very eloquent
and rapid speech, called upon the meeting to rally round the Altar and
the Throne, the DUKE OF WELLINGTON and the British Manufactures.
The MARCH19NEss of PACKEMOFF said she was prepared to make
great sacrifices for monarchical principles all over the world. She had
married six daughters at six different courts; and—why should she
blush to own it?—she was the grandm—that is, her daughters were
the mothers of six young princes. (Very faint cheers.) She had still
two daughters to marry (Signs of impatience), and neither she nor they
were to be put down by clamour. She had already discharged their
maid, a Frenchwoman; and had taken a girl—a thing with red elbows,
at reduced wages—from Devonshire; she had, moreover, changed her
laundress, the woman being obstinately wedded to an Italian iron.
(Cries of “Bless me!”) After this, need she say she was prepared for
great sacrifices?
The Countess of STRAwBERRICREME had only one—one little word
to say. (Ironical cries of “Oh!” and “The last word, no doubt.”) One little
word; upon her word and honour, only one. She was married when quite
—quite a child herself, and therefore that must account for the strange
fact of her already having just—she might say ". †:
daughter. ADELIZA-it was not perhaps too much for a mother to say
—was favourably known to many ladies present. She might add, very,
very favourably known. The child was to be married to LoRD WoRM.
woop DE ScKUBs to-morrow: and she would go to the altar, as
wholly and solely a bride of English, manufacture. (Cheers). That
her ladyship thought, was something, like a pattern for the #ymeneal
season about to commence in high life with its usual severity. (Three
cheers from the Mothers.) ... If not intrusive, she would indulge the
feelings of a parent by reading the wedding-dress—(she had brought a
copy of it with her to give to the man on the press, if he had a salver
about him to receive it)—the wedding-dress of darling ADELIZA. It
was this:—“The very young and lovely bride was magnificently
attired in a splendid shot gingham from the mills of MEssRs. CoBDEN
and BRIGHT, trimmed with Honiton lace of the British Lion pattern.
Over this she wore a Paisley shawl, embodying an exquisite design (the
work of a North British artist, and very touching for the occasion,
namely, CUPID in a kilt, with a nosegay of thistles.) The fair and
timid one also wore a bonnet of the most delicate Dunstable, enriched
with a wreath of British buttercups and daisies; to these may be
added a beautiful riband from the House of Peeping Tom of Coventry,
the bride’s-tear water pattern. Neither were the manufactures of the
Principality forgotten in the wardrobe of the bride, who seemed to
combine all the industrial resources of the United Ringdom. Whilst
upon the subject—and we dwell upon it at this length, the saison de
noces just beginning—it may not be too much to remark, that the bride's
dress was wholly put together with Whitechapel needles, and even her
wedding-ring had the good old English, hall-mark. We feel it more-
over only due to the patriotism of the bride's distinguished parents to
observe, that the marriage settlement of LADY. WoRMwooD, DE
Scrubs was engrossed upon British parchment, and enriched with an
English stamp.” (Here her Ladyship, with the conscious air of a
woman who Herº well of her country, dropt the MS. upon the
salver handed by MR JENKINs to receive it.) - -
LADY Popper addressed the meeting with considerable diffidence.
She so much admired the patriotic º of her friend the Countess
of STRAwBERRICREME–if she might be permitted to call her her friend
—that she should wish to see them carried entirely through. She rose
with respect to infants—cherubs in the cradle. A poet had said, “And
as the bow is bent, the boy's inclined.” By which, she inferred that
bows of foreign lace upon a baby's cap could not but have an unpatriotic
influence on the brain of the little precious. (It might, her Ladyship
added, be gathered that she spoke as a mother). She was prepared to
go to the root of the matter, and to abolish babies' caps at once...Let
them trust to the benign influence of their dear native hair. When,
moreover, it was remembered that so many of their little darlings came
into the world quite ready for the House of Lords (Cries ºf “Order /*)
—her Ladyship believed that she was º: to an historical fact;
their dear male eldest-born coming into the world with all the statutes
in their sweet little heads—it behoved them as mothers to guard them
against foreign influence. Therefore, she would abolish lace on babies'
caps once and for ever... (Faint cheers.), Again; she would not put a
coral in the hand of a child of hers; he should not cut his teeth upon an
exotic, a foreign substance; but—and, she was prepared to be called a
leveller; notwithstanding, if she knew herself, she was quite the contrary
—but upon a piece of home-grown, home-made English, crust She
believed that coral, and ivory, and India-rubber rings—all, it must be
remembered, the produce of the foreigner—had done more to spoil the
wisdom-teeth of the House of Lords (even before they had them) than
the chewing of any other thing soever. (Cries of “Question.'”)
The DowageRIApy MARRoBone said they had pretty well discussed
two questions—What babies were to be reared in, and what girls were
o be married in... She now, as an old woman—and she confessed to
having danced with the poet RoGERs, in pink and silver—she wished
i. ºire in what sort of manufacture ladies would like to be
urned .
[Here there was a sudden shriek. Then confused cries of “Shame/
Shame!”“Show that person to the door!” and the meeting finally separated
in several carriages, without coming to any resolution whatever,
PARLIAMENTARY DEBTORS.
WE perceive that MR. MorFATT and MR. BROTHERTON have brought
a bill into Parliament to provide for the exclusion from the House of
Commons of Members who shall be unable or unwilling to pay their
just debts. It is said that this bill will encounter a very determined
º This at first sight may appear strange. It is certainly odd
that the House which refuses the concession of that point of the
Charter which demands a no-property qualification, should persist in
retaining Members whose property, since they owe more than they can
pay, is less than nothing. #. if among the just and lawful debts of
Members may be included those which they owe to their country, ex-
perience has shown how likely it is that the utmost possible resistance
will be offered to any measure calculated to compel them to discharge
their obligations.
Cause and Effect.
A FINICAL, gentleman—the rose-coloured correspondent of the Post
—writes with the º of a poll-parrot on the doings in France. He
i. of the eatables at the late fête, and says, among other things,
there were—“most suspicious sausages, which made one shudder.” The
shudder, no doubt, arising from the old instinct, “Puppy doesn’t eat
puppy.”
ANTED.—By a Gentleman going into the Patriotic Line, a few Grievances
of strong manufacture, warranted to wear well. Also, seme materials for making
a Good Mob, that will not shrink in the washing, if a shower of rain should come on.
Best price given for Old Grievances, if they are not too much worn, and will admit of
turning over to the other side. Income-Tax objected to. Good Substantial Wrongs, to
which there are no appropriate Rights, will be taken with alacrity by the Advertiser,
whose object is chiefly occupation; but he is indifferent as to its being profitable to any-
body but himself. No Irish need apply.

R made a rightful claim to the sympathy of his country, and it

d now the man is dead. After a sojourn in England he
returned, a few weeks since, to the Hawkhillof Dundee, where,
in his own simple words, he “wished to return, like a bird
- that flutters around her forsaken nest, to spend his latter days
in comparative peace and quiet.” This was denied him. e
few days he spent were spent with all shapes of want about
him. Now, he is dead; and has left a widow and three infant

MR. GeoRGE GILFILLAN, of Dundee, and Messrs. Chal-

A FEW FARDONABLE words About OURSELVES. -
It is most flattering to our vanity
(if we have any) to see effigies of
our own jolly self gradually multi-
plying over the metropolis. No
cºffee-shop, no milk-shop, no cigar-
shop is now complete without
our bust. Trade, is glad of
our patronage, though we wish it
were accompanied with certain
reforms which should drive away
chicory, sand, chalk, cabbages,
and all other adulterations which
are a disgrace to our coffee, our
sugar, and—last, not least—our
-- - cigars. But as we are told “a good
- \ -- -- - - - - -
--- y time is coming,” we will wait till
that millennium. However, there are other purposes to, which we
should be glad to see our head devoted. The Loºp, MAYOR's mace, for
instance, would gain in meaning, and certainly would not lose in dignity,
if it were ennobled with the frontispiece of Punch. People might
laugh, perhaps; but don't they laugh also at the present preposterous,
staff, as it pokes its brazea head out of the Lord MAYon's carriage?
Again, the Great Seal of England might borrow our features, and we
would warrant that Justice would not lose anything if we gave it our
countenance. We would frown at all abuses, and turn up our nose at
the iniquitous delays of the Law, until we had fairly stamped them out
of the country. We put ourselves in the hands of the Lord CHAN-
cELLoR, referring him to the good impression we have always made
when we sided with a good cause, and set our face against a one.
This offer is tendered with the same impartiality to all those who hold
the Seals of Office.

THEY WON'T BE QUIET.
UDGING by the papers, our
ifriends the musical critics evi-
łdently intend to be the death
of us. A year ago they nearly
killed us with their learning,
and their elaborate exposition
of A, with its corresponding
semitones, forming a major
fifth, with a minor fourth, and
being equivalent to an octave
and a i. of the diatonic scale,
with eight sharps in the bar,
and a flat on the fourth crot-
chet. We did survive all this
erudition, somehow or other,
but now we are about to be
morally assassinated in another
way, and the first blow that
has been struck at us consists
in the announcement that
“TAMBURINI's voice proved
itself, at a recent concert, ex-
actly what it used to be in his
youngest and best days.” Now
we don't deny the justice of
comparing TAMBURINI's voice
to what it was in his “best”
days, but if it is like what it
was in his “youngest” days,
he must have had, for a new-born baby, one of the most astounding
baritones ever listened to. Our experience of infant vocalisation leads
us to believe, that any one's yoice, in his youngest days, is a some-
what disagreeable compound of the creaking of a door and the whining
ºf a cat; but, if the critic is to be believed, TAMBURINI came into
the world trolling out Largo al Factotum, or thundering forth Non
pin Andrai, with all the force he ever in his best days was known to
throw into them,
THE BATTLE OF LIMERICK.
YE Genii of the nation,
Who look with veneration,
And Ireland's desolation onsaysingly deplore ;
Ye sons of GENERAL J Ackson,
Who thrample on the Saxon,
Attend to the thransaction upon Shannon shore.
When WILLIAM, Duke of Schumbug,
- A tyrant and a humbug,
With cannon and with thunder on our city bore,
Our fortitude and valliance
. . Insthructed his battalions
To rispict the galliant Irish upon Shannon shore.
Since that capitulation,
No city in this nation
So grand a reputation could boast before,
| As Limerick prodigious,
That stands with quays and bridges,
And the ships up to the windies of the Shannon shore.
A chief of ancient line,
'Tis WILLIAM SMITH O'BRINE,
Reprisints this darling Limerick, this ten years or more :
O the Saxons can’t endure
..To see him on the flure,
And thrimble at the CICERo from Shannon shore
|
This valiant son of MARs
Had been to visit Par's,
That land of Revolution, that grows the tricolor;
And to welcome his return
. . From pilgrimages furren,
We invited him to tay on the Shannon shore.
Then we summoned to our board
| Young MEAGHER of the sword:
'Tis he will sheathe that battle-axe in Saxon gore;
And MITCHIL of Belfast,
We bade to our repast
To dihrink a dish of coffee on the Shannon shore.

Convamiently to hould
These patriots so bould,
We tuck the opportunity of TIM Doolan's store;
And with ornamints and banners

'Twould binifit your sowls,
To see the butthered rowls
The sugar-tongs and sangwidges and craim galore,
And the muffins and the crumpets,
And the band of harps and thrumpets,
To celebrate the sworry upon Shannon shore.
Sure the Imperor of Boha
Would be proud to dthrink the tay
That MISTHREss BIDDY Rooney for O'Brine did pour;
And, since the days of STRongbow,
There never was such Congo–
MITCHIL dihrank six quarts of it—by Shannon shore.
But CLARNDoN and CoRRY
CoNNELLANN beheld this sworry
With rage and imulation in their black hearts' core;
And they hired a gang of ruffins
To interrupt the muffins,
And the fragrance of the Congo on the Shannon shore.
When full of tay and cake,
O'BRINE began to spake,
But juice a one could hear him, for a sudden roar
Of a ragamuffin rout
Began to yell and shout,
And frighten the propriety of Shannon shore.
As SMITH O'BRINE harangued,
They batthered and they banged:
TIM Dool.AN's doors and windies, down they tore;
They smashed the lovely windies
. (Hung with muslin from the Indies),
Purshuing of their shindies upon Shannon shore.
With throwing of brickbats,
Drowned puppies, and dead rats,
These ruffin democrats themselves did lower;
Tin kettles, rotten eggs,
Cabbage-stalks, and wooden legs,
They flung among the patriots of Shannon shore.
O the girls began to scrame,
And upset the milk and crame;
And the honourable gintlemin, they cursed and swore:
And MITCHIL of Belfast,
‘Twas he that looked aghast,
When they roasted him in effigy by Shannon shore.
O the lovely tay was spilt .
On that day of Ireland's guilt;
Says Jack Mitch11, “I am kilt | Boys, where's the back door *
'Tis a national disgrace;
Let me go and veil me face;”
And he boulted with quick pace from the Shannon shore.
“Cut down the bloody hordel”
Says MEAGHER of the sword,
“This conduct would disgrace any blackamoor;”
But the best use ToMMY made
Of his famous battle blade -
Was to cut his own stick from the Shannon shore.
Immortal SMITH Q'BRINE
Was raging like a line; -
'Twould have done your sowl good to have heard him roar;
In his glory he arose, .
And he rushed upon his foes
But they hit him on the nose by the Šhannon shore.
Then the Futt and the Dihragoons
In squadthrons and platoons,
With their music playing chunes, down upon us bore;
And they bate the rattatoo,
But the Peelers came in view,
And ended the shaloo on the Shannon shore.

cHATEAU DE wigBox.-CANNEs.
RD BROUGHAM, after much pondering, having resolved to Let
his Mansion, known throughout the world as the Château de
Wigbox, Cannes, in the Department of War, France, will endeavour, in
the limits of an advertisement, to enumerate a few of the advantages of
that

Henceforth rendered, by the taste and reputation of its present pro-
prietor, to all future generations,
The Principal Shrine of Europe:

for it is not his Lordship's habit to beg anything—that he is not
induced to Let

In consequence of any threatened charivari now in preparation for him
—as reported in certain contemptible newspapers—should he return

It is his Lordship's well-known contempt and hatred of all republican
institutions—and of the Republic of France, as being based upon the
most crass ignorance, in particular—that induces him to Let upon
Lease
HIS FAIRY Ho ME;
(The said Lease to be determinable on the return of Royalty to the
Tuilleries). - - -
The Château de Wigbox is built neither upon the Ionic, nor upon
the Doric, but upon the true Chancery Order; and is therefore calcu-
lated to accommodate any number of people of property for any length
of time whatever.
The Château stands gracefully upon a green hill,—gracefully as the
Wig of Equity surmounts the Brow of Wisdom. At the back are
THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE,
Hitherto granted to the present proprietor as a stable, capable of
holding any number of hobby-horses. -
The Château is so constructed that for a few months it may be
compressed into
A Jolly Bachelor's Retreat,
Or expanded into a residence of Palatial Dimensions.
The BRowN STUDY of his Lordship (furnished with all his works in
every edition and in every language, # the use of foreigners) is further
decorated with

It is not needful for LoRD BROUGHAM to dwell upon the luxuriant
climate of Cannes. . In England, man, in his vain aspirations, sometimes
sings, “I’d be a butterfly!” Now at Cannes—so intoxicating is the
air—he is one. Yes; so delicious is the atmosphere, that, in the month

LoRD BRough AM might dwell at, length i. the beauties and
advantages of Cannes. But his Lordship—it is known to all the world
—is a man of few words.
LoRD BROUGHAM AND WAUx will merely add, that to any Statesman
tired of “fawning and 5. in a Court,” Cannes will afford a desirable

THE Swedish NIGHTINGALE (Curruca Lumlyana.)
. THIs Nº. is the most celebrated of all the warblers; but she
is the one of which least need be said, simply because nothing can
describe her. In the first place, there is no mistaking this Nightingale,
nothing in the world singing like her. She is the most graceful of all
the warblers, being about five feet high, with an extent and strength of
wing, that carry her over continents and across seas, borne upon the
breath of heartiest, deepest gratitude and praise. Her shape is very
succinct, and her habits at once frank, graceful, shy, and receding.
Her nest is in the wide world's heart, even though the said nest is
feathered with the finest bank-paper, carrying the very heaviest figures.
She sings equally well whether by day or night; and may often be
heard in the vicinity of Hanover Square, about two in the afternoon;
and as late as ten, somewhere in the Haymarket, in the evening.
Her range of voice is wonderful; reaching from the earth to the
stars, whereabout she seems to flutter and dally,
“Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim.”
She does not deal in the “jug jug” of the Curruca luscinia, so well
"T"---- - - - --
º to all pastoral folk, but gushes forth all sorts of sounds. Now
We nave- “Oh, gioja, oh gioja–Io tiritrovo, Elvino!"—
sounds that touch the tears into the eyes of the listener., And now
she pours forth a stream of plaintive song, and our heart floats away
upon it to blissfulness. Sometimes she pours out-
“Ah! non giunge,”
and they seem to flash like a shower of diamonds, of ethereal sparks,
kindling and subliming the sense they fall upon. - --- - - -
We cannot arrive at a certain knowledge of the food of this Nightin-
gale. Some say she lives upon roses steeped in moonbeams; some, on
melted amber. But, certain it is, from the divine emanations of her
music, most certain it is—
“She on honey-dew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise."

lips controls each impulse of the subjec, heart.

PARIS.
(From our own Correspondent.)
Besipes his Château at Cannes, LoRD BROUGHAM has been employed,
“plus de cing ans,”, in building “Châteauren Espagne.” A very pretty
design in one of these, having the Provisional Government of France
delivering letters of naturalisation in the foreground, and the election of
President of the º: in the distance, has been unfortunately spoiled
by some ill-disposed person having written on it, “Il m'est impossible
d'accueillir votre demande.—CREMIEUx.”
LIBERTY OF THE PREss-A Paris journal says, “Thursday was a
magnificent day. From daylight one unbroken series of clouds poured
down a close, penetrating, ceaseless rain, that, spite of all precautions,
wetted one to the skin. There was not a gleam of sunshine.” In a
Republic every one may publish what he thinks; but
“Diff'rent men-diff'rent opinions,
Some loves apples—some loves inions.”
Rejected Jokes.
THE proprietors of the two following things, called jokes, can, have
them by making application at the Punch Office, and paying for them,
The charge is according to weight, so there, can be no dispute about
payment, as the articles, are always weighed in the presence of the
owners. By the bye, the lightest subjects are, generally found the
heaviest. The two following weigh 28lbs. 9oz. and a few pennyweights.
The first is called—“How To MAKE.A. Room airy". The answer
to which is, “Rub the walls all over with Rowland's Macassar.”
. The second one is—if the reader, has patience for another-‘What
is the most favourable season to have letters from India?” and the
reply to this jocular inquiry is, “The season that brings them on soon”
(the Monsoon).
We have thousands more of the same quality; but we are sure our
fastest readers will not be angry with us if we reserve them for another
dose. Homoeopathy is best in such cases.
Pecuniary Embarrassment.--To the Benevolent.
AN Unfortunate Government, Totally Blind, in consequence of which
severe affliction it has plunged º an Expensive War, suddenly finds itself
involved in Hostilities, without a shot in the Locken. In this awkward and alarming
Predicament, it is obliged to throw itself on the GENERosrty of its Country, or of any
other that may think it worthy of Assistance. A Loan of Ten Dollars or Thirty Shillings
will confer on it an obligation which will be duly acknowledged by an I.O.U.; and the
lender is earnestly requested to believe that INTERest will be paid for the Monry. A
Silver Snuff-box, Candlestick, Spoon, or even Toothpick, will be gladly accepted in lieu
of cash; and the smallest contribution, down to the most insignificant copper, thankfully
received., N.B. As the Government is employed in an Invasion of its NEIGHBouns, it
sonfidently trusts to meet its engagements out of the Property, of which, by the Aid of
the BENEFICENT, it expects to be enabled to deprive them. Address—if by letter, post
Lºw-w the Treasury, Berlin.
PORTRAITS OF THE FRENCH DEPUTIES
WILL soon be in excessive demand amongst the various pictorial
newspapers. We do not intend to be behind our age in the gratifica:
tion of this laudable curiosity; but in order to get through, the 900
originals within any reasonable time, it will be advisable that their
likenesses should come out by instalments. -
Behold them, above, the first Number of this new and glorious Picture
Gallery. These deputy daguerreotypes are all warranted perfect like-
messes, and the late decree of the Provisional. Government, enjoining
uniformity of costume, has considerably simplified our labours. We
may mention that a friend has suggested that we should affix the name
below each portrait; but we think it is really too bad, when we furnish
their exact likenesses, to be asked besides for
the names of the particular individuals they so
faithfully represent.
In order to supply our readers—the world we
mean—with instantaneous representations of the
great men and events so rapidly succeeding each
other, we have in store a large stock of stereo-
typed statesmen, skeleton heroes, ready to be
endowed with life by a lively dash of the pencil.
Thus the annexed has been kept ready for the
likeness of the French President, and with the
addition of the features, yet to be supplied, the
face will appear instinct with life.
Again, should RADETsKI, defeat CHARLes
ALBERT in some bloody fight, or vice versä, the visage of the victor
shall instantly be thrown off from one of a set of faces,
merely requiring the judicious application of a nose
and eyes to make them faithful resemblances. We
hereby warn any gentleman who shall first make
himself remarkable on the stage of Europe, that we
have at least so much- -
of his profile in pickle. As, this is all complete
except the nose and colour of the hair, we shall have
those transmitted to us by electric telegraph.
Some interesting émeutes º soon be expected
in France; and as the public will require them to be
truly and instantaneously depicted, we beg to state
that an acquaintance of ours has on hand some old, copperplates
of the Bristol Riots, the PortEus Mob, &c., which he will be happy to
part with at first cost.
Gross Ignorance.
THE French have been much abused for expelling the English work-
men from their land. The whole affair appears to have originated in a
ºf...; The English called themselves, “journeymen,”
which the French translated into “gens de voyage,” and in consequence,
with their usual politeness, refused to interrupt them in their intended
expedition, even to work for the French people.

But you seem to be only Soupe Meagher.
SEASONABLE PHENOMENON.
As a remarkable indication of the early advent of summer this
year, may be noticed the fact, that a lump of ice has made its appearance

MAY-DAY'S LIBERTY TREES.
MAY has come up with quickening breath, to breathe about the flowers
That thro’ the mould of wood and wold º up from April showers;
All is blossom, bloom, and burgeon on trim lawns and woodland leas,
And Freedom's trees are sprouting, like other kinds of trees;
So kindly Lady Liberty, to her *. game addrest,
Hath thrown her nursery open to the nations of the West.
“Fair speed, old friends and new ones! let each his skill essay
To choose his Tree of Liberty, this merry month of May.
“Mine is a Dryad's nature—I flourish and I fade,
I have my scathings and i blights, bare time and time of shade;
So each of you his tree s lant, and call it after me,
And I shall wane or wax, as fades or flourishes my tree.
“I have laurels whose green glossiness is due to bloody rains,
whº, roots suck strength from that dark loam which fattens battle
plains;
I have mountain pines, rock-rifted, slow of growth as they are strong,
Poplars, in one night spindled up, as weak as they are long.
“I have broad platanes, such as cooled Ilissus’ waters clear;
Qlives, the growth of Italy, no longer shrunk and sere;
And this green sire, whose gnarlèd limbs still blunt the axe's stroke,
Ringed with a thousand summers—the knotty British Oak.”
To mingled Marsellaise and Mourir pour la Patrie,
Musket in hand, red cap on head, sprang France to choose his tree.
... Laurels? Bah! Of that plant, for me at will to pick and pull,
The Little Corporal stuck France, if possible, too full.
"Pines? Ah, out-Guillaume Tell, et ce grand tânor, DUPREz!
Qlives?-pas mal for a dessert, or to help a salad—mais—
The Qakh Ah, par erample! The Oak for France, que non!
The Oak!—a grand, grand, grand jamais / Ah, perſide Albion /
“Woyans-What's left? Ah, yes; this trunk, so gentille and so slim,
Sº nobly sudden, too, in growth—I fix my choice on him
The Tree of Liberty for France the Poplar I proclaim,
And with a grand fraternal fée inaugurate the same!”
Next Germany came much bemused with Burschen-schaft and beer:
He first was all for fixing there, then all for fixing here;
Qne moment hot ſor Poplar, the next agog, for Qak,
Till Liberty began to think his choice would end in smoke.
So she left him roaming vaguely thro' her garden for a tree,
Now roaring an “auf Bruder” now a “Crambambuli,”
Hid in clouds of his own blowing—moyen-age in coat and hat,
And apparently quite hazy as to what he would be at.
Then Italy came leaping, like a strong man out of sleep -
And with outspread arms the Laurel boughs and Olive down did sweep;
“Be these my trees, and thine this wreath—for peace and for renown.
And Liberty {j on well-pleased, and took the proffered crown.
But Britain in that garden stood, like one familiar there, - -
And watched the rush of stranger guests, with an untroubled air,
And shook his head, or nodded, as each chose his tree of choice,
But never shifted foot the while, nor liſted up his voice.
“Four tree?” at last quoth Liberty, when Britain, calm of soul,
Turn'd fondly to the Oak, and spread his broad hand on the bole.
“'Tis gnarled,” he said, “but honest—slow of growth, but firm of
graln: - -
Up from the ground he drinks the dew; down from the skies, the rain.
“His roots took time in spreading, but spread wider for the time;
Ring gradual welded on to ring, he broadened to his prime:
He has witnessed generations of quicker-blooded trees , , .
Shoot up, sink down, since first the fern clustered about his knees.
* This is my tree; the Liberty I crave, like this should thrive-
A thing of growth, however slow, in every vein alive.
Let France have Poplars, if she will; and at your garden call
For a tree per Revolution: my Oak is once for all.
“All he asks is careful tending. Foul things, at times, no doubt
Will roost in his broad branches; I must put them to the rout.
He has dead wood to cut away; bruis’d branches to sustain : - - -
But still my Oak, through all, is Oak—through all, shall Oak remain.”

A NEW MENAGERIE.
THE Zoological Society has recently accomplished apiece of wonderful
liberality in throwing open to the public the entire collection of animals
at a low charge, instead of going through the farce of insisting on a
Fellow’s order (and almost any fellow would do), with the accompanying
charge of one shilling. We understand that the authorities of the
Stock Exchange are about to throw open to the public their celebrated
collection of living Bulls and Bears, at a low figure. The Bulls will go
through their wonderful feats of tossing º: by way of illustration of ſ.
gambling spirit that pervades the Stock Exchange; and it is intended
also to combine a choice collection of Stags, being the small remnant of
this breed that happened to be preserved after the famous panic in the
Railway Share-market.
LETTER OF ADVICE TO MR, COCHRANE.
MR. CochRANE,
My contemporary, the Morning Chronicle, informs me that on
Thursday last, at a meeting of the inhabitants of St. Martin-in-the-
Fields, in the Westry Room of that parish, convened for the promotion
of Reform, you got up to make a speech, and having introduced
remarks extraneous to the topic under discussion, you were very
properly stopped by the Chairman, and, in fact, put down.
It is clear, therefore, that you were not aware that by the ridiculous
failure of your late attempt at agitation, you are as a political rushlight,
completely extinguished and snuffed out. I begin to recognise you as
a true Englishman: you never know when you are beaten. .
Let me beg of you to be convinced that it is all over with you as
an agitator; i. as a demagogue you are effectually shut up.
... I know what you want. It is notoriety. I will help you to obtain
it to the very best of my power.
I will place you in communication with MR. NELson LEE, and use
my interest with him, to enable you to make any display you please
outside of his establishment (late Richardson’s) at Greenwich Fair.
I shall be most happy to recommend you to the proprietor of Astley's,
in case anything unfortunately should happen to MR. BARRY.
I will commission my own barber to shave your eye-brows; and any
one of º artists whom you may choose to select, shall tip your nose
with : lue. -
I will furnish you with as many designs as, you may require for
your advertising carts, provided that they shall be simply calculated
to render you personal conspicuous. -
| In short, I will gladly aid you in any attempt to attract public
attention as a common mountebank; but mind, not as a political one.
You must really abandon all connexion with public affairs.
In particular, I warn you to cease altogether to mix yourself up with
the question of Reform; for you must not be suffered to damage a
good cause by the contempt and odium your advocacy will necessarily
entail upon it. I am, MR. CochPANE,
Your judicious adviser,

|...We regret to state that the Limerick Revolution has not been a
oodless one. The descendant of BRIAN B9Ru’s nosebled profusely;
and, as he received a black eye on the occasion, it has been remarke
that the “demonstration” was an ocular one for him.
THE CONFLICT OF THE COATS.
We find, by a tremendous article in one of the Communist papers of
Paris, that the struggle now going on in France is a combat for life and
death between the Blouse and the Redingote. It seems rather absurd
that these two articles of the wardrobe should be in such a state of
inveterate hostility. Nor can we see exactly how they are to fight,
unless they begin to dash each other's buttons, ºr perhaps exchange
cuffs in the course of their combat. The Blouse will have one peculiar
advantage over the Redignote, for the former can hang on to the latter's
skirts, whereas the former has no skirts for the latter to hang upon.
We should be very sorry to see a similar revolution in England, and
we can only hope that no one will ever be base enough to, set the
Taglioni in dire antagonism to the Wraprascal, or create enmity between
the Paletót and the Pea-jacket, the Wellington and the Highlow, the
Buckskins and the Over-alls. We hope with all our hearts, that he who
first attempts to rouse the Fustian against the Saxony, may experience
that ºnlins which is considered so beneficial to the article last
mentioned.
“Oh Where, and Oh Where?"
OH where, and oh where is young SMITH O'BRIEN gone?
He went to get the French to assail the English thrºne;
And it’s oh in my heart he’d much best have stayed at home.
Oh, suppose and º: he must fight or p'rhaps must die.
Then it’s oh in my heart I believe he’d º
For he found he’d got enough when they gave a black eye.
COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE.
THE Mercantile Articles in the daily press usually commence with-
“We have received papers from Paris.” Since the suspension of
cash payments, it is useless to expect anything else.
T H E PORTFOLIO.
I.—From Wiscount PUMICEstone to H. E. the English Ambassador at
Constantinople.
sTEEMED SIR,--I have to desire
that you will wait on the Grand
Vizier and convey to His Ex-
cellency the sentiments which
actuate this Government with
regard to the present position
of the Ottoman Empire.
“You will state to the Grand
Vizier that the line of politics
pursued by the Sultan can by
no means meet with the
approval of this country. Re-
forms are needed in the admi-
mistration and in the religion
of the Ottoman Empire, the
adoption of which you will urge
with all the energy in your
ower.
“The spectacle of a Sultan
surrounded, by at least five
hundred wives, is odious to
Europe, and unworthy of the
resent age of civilisation.
ER MAJESTY's Government
blushes to have to acknowledge, post after post, the birth of Princes
and Princesses of the family of Appuſ, MEDjeep; and as England has
not the slightest pretentions to control the actions of any state with
which she is in alliance, you will point out to the Government of the
Porte that His Imperial Highness is at perfect liberty to select any one
of his wives which he may prefer, but º: he must send back to their
parents the remaining four hundred and ninety-nine: -
“The religion at present professed by the Sovereign of the Turkish
Empire, and by a considerable portion of his subjects, is, you will have
the goodness to inform the Grand Imaum, an exploded supersition
and an insult to the civilisation of Europe. It must no longer callowed
to exist in this quarter of the globe. -
“You will therefore, request. His Excellency, on the part of this
Government, to subscribe º: Thirty-nine Articles as soon as may be;
and also, at his earliest convenience, to learn the Catechism. The
Mollah of Exeter, an English Bishop, will go out to conciliate the
Turkish clergy, and will be Patriarch of Constantinople. - --
“Further reforms will be the subject of future communications.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Among these you may mention our desire that the Turkish Government
should establish Gas-lamps, Trial by Jury, Weekly and Sunday News:
papers, Harvey Sauce, two legislative §º. and the Ten Pound
qualification for voting. “I &
am, &c.,
“PUMICEstone,
“To H. E. SIR. G. Goosequill.” “Downing Street.”
II.-From the Grand Pizier to H. E. the English Ambassador.
“In the name of Allah! The Grand Vizier has received the chaplet
of roses from the Paradise of Downing. Street. The eloquence of
PUMICEstone sings out like a nightingale from amongst the flowers. It
is sweet to listen to his music.
“But the nightingale, though sweet, is melancholy; and who does not
know that there are thorns in roses?—they have pricked the fingers of
the Grand Vizier. The notes of the British bulbul have made the
Padishah sad in spirit, , ,
“Why should he part with any of his wives? Let him who has too
many sew them in a sack...The children of the Father of the Faithful
will not be so costly to his country as are the many rosebuds of the
Joy-Gardens of Pimlico.
“The Exeter Mufti shall be welcome to the holy men of Constanti-
nople. If Pumicestone_Pasha will change his religion, the Grand
Vizier will be baptised. If the English Mollah is constant, why should
the Turkish Imaum be arenegade. Let them come and each have his
say. If they brawl and quarrel too much, let either be accommodated
with a bastinado.
“In respect of the other reforms proposed by Britannic wisdom, the
Grand Vizier will respectfully ask—Are Britons the only possessors of
beards? Who is it that rules in his own house?—Is it the lord of the
house, or his neighbour? PUMIcEstone is a sage, but we too have
sages.
‘Once, in the gardens of Delight, overhanging the Bosphorus, the
oung prince SHukoor KHANDEE, son of the Light of the Universe,
ound the egg of a peacock, which he took to the SULTANAVALIDE, the
mother of the sovereign. “Look, O Grandmother,’ said PRINCE
SHukook; this outer surface that you see is what they call a shell.
Within the shell is a white slimy fluid, within the white a yellow yolk.
I prick the head of the shell with a pin; I place it to my lips, and suck
in, and lo! I withdraw the yolk and the * from the shell, and they
slip down my own throat.”
‘‘O, wise in thine own conceit!” the Princess answered. ‘Dost
thouteach thy father's mother how eggs are eaten? Lo! I knew how
to suck them before thou camest into the world!’ And, clapping her
hands for Meskour, the Chief of the Eunuchs, she bade him º the
bamboo to the PRINCE SHukoor.
“Do we not also know how to suck eggs, O, Ambassador?. So write
to Pumicestone Pasha, and bid him to operate on his own henroosts.
“To the British Minister.” “KABob Pasha.”
III.-From Wiscount Pumicestone to H. E. Lond Tapeworm, at
Petersburg,
“You will have the goodness to communicate to H.E. Count GRoge-
Noºr the opinions of this Government upon some late acts of Russian
º: They by no means meet with the approval of Her B. Majesty's
advisers.
"The treatment of Poland can never be looked upon by this country
but with feelings of indignation and pity. You will urge upon the
Councils of His Imperial Majesty, the instant necessity of changing his
method of administering the affairs of that unhappy portion of his
empire. - -
“You will recommend H. I.M. immediately to recognise the inde-
pendence of the Circassian tribes, and to send to SchAMYL BEY his
order of St. Nepomuk of the first class. -
“It is the desire of this Government that Trial by Jury should be
immediately established throughout all the Russias, especially in the
Calmuck provinces of the Empire. The Tartars on the Chinese border
imperatively require slate-roofed houses: with thorough drains, and gas
and water laid on. It would be advisable to have a Methodist Meeting:
house, in their villages, and that the English system of pauper relief
should be adopted throughout the Russian Empire.
“We would suggest to H.I.M. that a Window-tax would be an
advantageous impost to levy on the Cossacks of the Ukraine, and that a
Water-rate on the Don and Volga might conduce to the increase of his
revenue.
“The uniform of the Preobajinski Regiment cannot but be º
displeasing to HER MAJESTY's Government: the yellow coatee and p
breeches of that corps neither harmonise with the silver helmet nor the
green morocco boots which they wear. . A great and august authority
on Military Costume in England, is anxious that changes should take
place in this particular, consonant to the spirit of the times and the
advance of freedom. - - ---
“The cut of the Emperor's whiskers has been viewed in this country
with the deepest grief. Instead of growing them over the cheek-bone,
you will have the goodness to suggest to his Imperial Majesty the
necessity of altering their direction; a portrait of a distinguished
military officer is sent out for this purpose, to which H.I.M. is
earnestly invited to give his attention. - -
“The usage of the knout is not viewed by this country with pleasure;
nor the practice of eating tallow-candles, in which some of the subjects
of H.I.M. fatally indulge. It will be as well to abolish the knout;
and to refrain from making use of dips in the manner described.
“The dinner hour of the Court of St. Petersburg might be advan-
tageously changed; the censorship of the Press ought to be abolished;
the serfs, ought to be represented in Parliament; the fares of the
droskies in St. Petersburg diminished. Gas should be laid down, in
Siberia; the Empress's maids of honour reduced in number; London
Porter, Missionary Meetings, New Policemen, and Daily Papers, should
be established in all the principal towns of the Empire, and it is very
desirable that the middle-classes of St. Petersburg and Moscow should
eat shoulders of mutton and baked potatoes on Sunday, instead of their
present unwholesome meal of fish-oil and hemp-brandy.
“You will communicate, to the above purport, with the Government
of His Imperial Majesty.
“(Signed) PUMICEstone.”
“To H. E., Lord TAPeworm.”
IV.-From the Russian Minister to the English Ambassador.
“I have the honour to accuse the . of Your Excellency's
letter, containing the proposals of His Excellency, MILoR PUMIcestone,
for the better regulation of this Empire, . -
“H.I.M. is profoundly touched by the interest which H. E. deigns
to take in the affairs of Russia. H. M. is charmed by the modesty of
a philanthropy so universal. There is no doubt but the º
Empire is at present so º that its statesmen have time to consider
what will most conduce to the welfare of other countries, and that all
º: º: of the world cannot do better than let the English manage
or them.
“H.I.M. hopes that the state of the country will soon permit him to
abolish the use of the knout, and at the same time desires to know
when flogging will cease in the English Army?
“H.I.M. will not fail to have a Chamber of Peers, and a Chamber of
Commons for the regulation of the affairs of his empire, as soon as his
Imperial mind is convinced that hereditary wisdom of necessity belongs
to the nobility: in the meanwhile he is content to select his own Senate:
and without the noise and trouble of elections he can find Councillors as
pure as MR. Attwood and as wise as Colonel, SIBThorp.
“H.M. will not enterinto the other questions which are touched upon
in H. E.'s agreeable letter; but H. M. cannot enter into reforms of his
own states at this moment, so deeply is he interested in the affairs of
Ireland-which, before all things, he wishes to see tranquil.
“As soon as that º is quiet and industrious. His Majestypledges
himself that he will withdraw his garrisons from Warsaw. that he will
Fº a free press, to preach rebellion and inculcate the murder of the
overnment authorities. But, in the meanwhile, H. I. M. submits to
LoRD PUMIcEstone, that it is possible that even English Institutions
are not suitable to all countries; that even against English Laws
there are some people who complain, and would rebel; and that H. I. M.
feels himself strong enough for the present to manage his own affairs,
without the obliging intervention of #. E. Wiscount Pumicestone.
“I beg your Excellency to accept the assurances of, &c.,

ON THE NEW FORWARD MOVEMENT.
A Letter from our old friend, MR. SNoB, to MR. Joseph HUME.
STEEMED SIR,-Seldom directly
meddling with politics, I offer
a humble . but particularly
warm adhesion to the princi-
ples of your programme for
the 24th. Any services in m
line I beg you to command.
I believe that the country is
not fairly represented, and that
Lord This coerced his voters
at Stamford, while. Mr. That
urchased his at Kinsale. I
lackballed CAPTAIN FITz-
whiskERs at the club last week
with perfect satisfaction, and
without risk of personal colli-
sion with the Captain, who is
since gone abroad, and I do
not see why LoRD ExETER's
tenants should not have a
similar modest way of assert-
ing their opinions. If ballot is
|an un-English practice, I hope
it will soon be an £nglish One.
If there were more lia-
ments, and more voters, I think
there would be less bribery, and that even MR. ATTwood could not
stand persuading electors too often. I stand by you respectſully, and
am ready to *:::: any peaceful and constitutional line of agitation
which you shall think advisable. -
. “If LoRD John Russel L will not come with us, I can conceive (with
infinite pain) the possibility of doing without him... I had rather have
bribery decreased than LoRD John Russell, at the head of affairs.
I had rather that landlords should cease to º even, than that LoRD
John should continue to be our chief. I can fancy, that the world will
go on even without him, and that the machine will not fall to pieces
although this prodigious little pin be withdrawn. Let it have a coronet,
gilt on its ...; .#be stuck in a cushion in the House of Lords.
“I can even go some length with MR. CoBDEN in his dangerous
speech about the barbarous splendour surrounding the Crown. It is
not the money, as some people object, so much as the sentiment. It
will make very little difference to any man in England whether there is
a silver stick or groom of the dust-pan more or less in the service of the
Court, of which we all admire the modest English merits. But there
are barbarous splendours about the precincts of Pimlico, that are
ridiculous and immoral, rather than costly, against which MB. CoBDEN
has a right to cry out. Who could not name a score such P
“It is very well for LoRD JoHN to cry out and say that the British
people love their QUEEN, that they will not grudge her any of the state
which belongs to her dignity, that she is a model of private virtue, and
that to meddle with her privileges is to meddle with the Constitution.
What is the Constitution, my dear Sir, d'abord? If the Constitution
of to-day is the Constitution of the PRINCE, REGENT's time, every
gentleman connected with this periodical would have passed years in
gaol, as MR. LEIGH HUNT did. Good Laws' how have we ridiculed
a certain august hat, for instance;, not because we are disloyal, but
because the object was laughworthy. In QUEEN ANNE's reign, we
should have had our ears cut off; by QUEEN ELIZABETH, we should have
been hanged without any mercy, and all under the exercise of the same
Constitution. The Constitution roasted us indifferently ſor being Catholics
or Protestants. If the Constitution is at the head of the nation, it is
not BRITANNIA's helmet, as it were, but her hair: it, renews itself per:
etually: it is cut off and grows again, and is curled in a thousand
ashions—ſashions is the word—the Constitution is the political fashion.
The country may wear what she likes—ringlets, or powder and a tail,
or a Madonna bandeau, or a Brutus crop.
‘And as for insinuating that a man is disrespectful to his QUEEN
because he wishes to alter some of the present appurtenances of Royalty,
I take the liberty to deny that charge with indignation. For instance,
love and respect # grandmother; but suppose she took it into her
head to walk in the Park with a hoop and ń. and the second head-
dress above described, should we not have a right to remonstrate with
the venerable .# CoBDEN has a right to look at the Court and say
that many parts of it are barbarousand foolish. Beefeaters are barbarous.
urt-Circulars are barbarous. Gentlemen-Pensioners are barbarous.
Jones with a black-satin º #. to Court with his sword between
his legs, is barbarous. My old friend JEAMEs, with his stick and bouquet,
ls an eminent and absurd barbarian. I hope to see them all sacrificed;
and as for poor.JEAMEs, I am like Mitchel and LoRD CLARENDon,
and exclaim, “Either you or Imust die, JEAmes’
“The day after the Drawing-Room, as I was walking down Pall Mall,
(with Colonel BLucHER and young HIGHLows, a relation of WELLING-
Ton’s, by the way), the Lord Mayor's coach passed down the astonished
street, escorted by policenſen, his Lordship, and the man who wears
the muff, being, inside; the Court of Aldermen and the Common
Council, with i. gowns, following their Chief in various cabs,
broughams, and other vehicles.
“When the hideous, monstrous, creaking, tumbling, lumbering old
trap was built, in which his Lordship was seated, it was made after the
fashion of the times, when people liked to travel slow, and was no
doubt the best vehicle of a large sort which could be manufactured.
Since them, railroads have learned to travel seventy miles an hour, and
there's not a dustman's cart that doesn't go better than the wretched
old mammoth coach, with its huge, old ugly, clumsy, costly machinery,
containing a magistrature just as costly, clumsy, and out of date. The
little civilised boys in Pall Mall ‘larked” the Lord Mayor and his friend
in the muff; the street-sweeper looked at him with scorn, and the
Policemen marched with downcast faces as the carriage rumbled into
the City, stopping up the way, annoying the passengers, interrupting
the traffic, and occasioning the general discomfort.
“Suppose the House of Commons had a †. should pro-
pose the civic rattle-trap should be abolished, or a new and more commo- |
dious carriage provided for the Lord Mayor. But my LoRD JoHN replies
“Beware of Republicanism. Dangerous innovations are being practised
everywhere...The people, it is my firm belief, are satisfied with their
resent institutions; and I have the happiness of thinking that the
rd, and Lady Mayoress are the most excellent, persons in their
private capacity, . their private virtues exalt their lofty station.
(Hear). Her Ladyship attends to the household duties; never break-
fasts in bed; looks to the tradesmen's books and, the housekeeping ;
sees the children in the nursery, and walks out with her ladies of honour,
in the pleasure-grounds of Billingsgate or Bunhill Row. His Lordship
º: in the morning; does Justice business all day; dispenses hos-
itality in the evening; but is never more than half-an-hour away from the
adies over his wine. (Immense cheers, in which MR. Hudson and MR.
BROTHERTON join). And this being the case, what follows? Why, the
consequence is obvious; they are virtuous, therefore they oughtn't to
have a new coach. The old one has borne for two hundred years the
bottle and the breeze. It rolls, and as it rolls, for, ever will roll on.’
(Immense cheers).
“It was exactly the argument J. in France by other little
statesmen and ministers of a moral monarch. “Louis-PHILLPPE is a
model husband and father; therefore don't let us have any more
reforms. Who dares say that this monarch does not sympathise with
the country, when it is known that he takes tea and plays his rubber in
the bosom of his family like the simplest bourgeois & What can the
people want with public meetings, when the king sleeps on a straw
mattress, and is a pattern of domestic propriety?... Reforms, forsooth !
Haven’t we a Chamber, and an immense majority ?" This was the argu-
ment up to the twenty-third day of last February; but it had ceased to be
very cogent on the twenty-fifth, when majority, monarch, and ministers
all §. from the scene.
“And this point being, rather brutally, disposed of, there comes
another argument, which Fº are very fond of putting, and is used
by your Conservatives and Whigs with a triumphant air. ‘Yes; they
have got rid of their monarch and ministers,’ says LoRD JoHNNY, or
LoRD ToMMY; “but what have they taken in exchange?...A howling
". ; a furious tyranny of 500,000 bayonets; aruined Exchequer;
a nationa bankruptcy; a general cessation of labour; and conspiracy
to organise famine. Does not every man of sense prefer the moderate
liberty of Louis-PHILIPPE to the monstrous licentiousness, and the con-
stant danger and terror of the present period * Would you have wild
revolutionists yelling in London streets, and clubs and muskets
governing the House of Representation?”. The meaning of which is,
that it is better that a man should forego, his undoubted rights for the
sake of peace and quiet, than that he should bestir and endanger himself
to Fain them.
“But in this case, MR. BANCROFT would never have been here as
American Minister, that is clear; and the American colonies would
still paying their tax upon tea. We might still have had STEwARTs
on the throne, chopping off heads of LORD Russells for, treason.
The cause for *::: HAMPDEN and SIDNEY still occasionally perish
after dinner, in those weak assemblies where the Whigs muster, was a
rank rebellion; and MR. BARRY should º a Star Chamber in the
new Houses of Parliament, where the dandy dealers in middle-age
gimcracks were afraid to set up, CROMWELL. Of course, no revolution
is good for trade. People can't do two things at a time. ſt is impossible
at once to work at a ... and in a riot. But who is the cause
of the riot?, What was it that brought Louis-PHILIPPE smirking over
the barricades of July, when all danger was over, and put him into a
cab, and sent liim out of the Paris gates in February?...What was it
that brought LoRD JoHN into office in '32, and will send him out before
many months are over? He can't stop, and keep all the world waiting
behind him. He is at the head of the column, and must march with it, or
shirk out of the rank and let it pass by, or stand and let it march over him.

ELABORATE ENGRAVING TO BE PRESENTED TO THE SUBSCRIBERS
To THE ART-UNION.
BROUGHAM ON LAW, AND PUNCH ON BROUGHAM.
OUR noble friend has turned hack to the old paths, along which he
marched to reputation, the slippery ways of Law Reform, beset with
pit-falls, and H. with all manner of man-traps and spring-guns.
We congratulate our noble friend on this return to his great and far
from finished work. We place at our noble friend's disposal the fol-
lowing comments on his excellent speech of Friday last, and thus play
Coke to his Littleton.
B. on Acts of Parliament.—“The persons who draw up Acts of
Parliament should always use the plainest language.”
P. on B.--"Not so; for they would often thereby disclose the
plainest want of meaning.”
B.—“They should never use any word, the meaning of which was
not well-defined.”
P.—“Not so: for thereby they would continually be left without
any words to use.”
B.—“They ought never to use the same word in two senses; they
should never use two words in the same sense.”
P-"True. Moreover, they should never use any word, or many
words, with no sense whatever.”
B.—“They should never refer in any one Act of Parliament to any
other Act, but always state in the same Act what they meant.”
P.—“This were well: also, that when they meant nothing by any
Act, they should state the same.”
B.—“In the enacting clauses of the Poor Law Amendment Act, the
changes were so .# upon the verb ‘to be,” which was sometimes
are,' sometimes shall, be,” sometimes ‘may be,” and sometimes ‘shall
have been,” that the unhappy judges were perfectly bewildered.”
P.—“Therein doth such verb resemble LoRD B. himself, who hath
so often rung all manner of changes on his opinions, that the best
judges are as much bewildered thereby as ever they were by any Act of
Parliament whatever.”
* B. on the Marriage Law—“In consequence of the conflict of laws on
marriage, many a man in England was unable to tell whether in the eye
of the law he was married or single, legitimate or illegitimate. Some
of the ornaments of their Lordships' House were in that predicament.”
P. “Perchance, by doing away with this uncertainty, would these
ornaments of their Lordships' House be made wise; for thereby might
“It i. to this I look, this which brings me with ardour to your ranks, large practice, whose inefficiency is discovered long before their deaths,
and this prophecy, which I beseech you to remember in the hour of but who, nevertheless, are allowed to practise, notwithstanding.”
they know concerning their fathers, and ‘It is a wise child that
knoweth its own father.’” - - -
B.—“He knew a conveyancer of large practice, whose inefficiency
was not discovered till long after his death, when the consequences
proved fatal to the peace and prosperity of many families.” -
P.—“Therein was the conveyancer luckier than many statesmen in
| B.—“He knew a solicitor who died, and whose papers were all cut
| up into tailors' measures after his decease.” - -
| P.—“Therein did the said solicitor differ from a Minister, whose
| measures are often cut up in the papers, before it.”
| B.—“To make two wills was unsatisfactory.”
| P-‘How unsatisfactory must, therefore, have been the life of
|LoRD B., who hath so often changed his will, that he has now no one
opinion, “whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.’”
With these comments P. leaves B., with a hearty congratulation, on
seeing him again at a work which he ought never to have oned.
A SHORT CUT TO PROSPERITY.
OUR attached Judy has had addressed to her an appeal of the Not-
tingham stocking manufacturers, which, at her request, we present to
our lady readers. It opens respectfully.
| “MADAM, Having seen it stated in the public papers that you are using your |
induence, in conjunction with others, to promote and encourage, by your own example,
the use of articles of British manufacture in dress, I venture respectfully to call your
attention to that of stockings.”
Under other circumstances, we should be prepared to resent this
|calling attention to any part of the dress of Mr. P. But patriotism is
aramount to delicacy. The letter proceeds, however, to still more
gerous ground.
“You and others with whom you are associated in this generous effort for the goed
of others, are rº, little aware of the very serious injury which has been inflicted on
this branch of trade, by the fashion some time since adopted by ladies, of wearing long
dresses.”
Here we must draw the line. We cannot permit this. Mrs. P. does
wear her crinoline of the most decorous dimensions, and we cannot give
way a single inch. , Mrs. P. is prepared to contract, our household
expenditure, but not her skirts. She has no objection to wearing long
stockings, but it must be with still longer dresses. She will thus be
|“doing good by stealth.” Were her robes shorter, she would “blush
to find it fame.” She would gladly go any lengths to aid the stockingers,
but positively declines to go the scantiness demanded of her. With
this assurance she begs to cut short the dangerous proposition of the
Nottingham manufacturers.
Questions for Circulation among the Candidates for
Teacherships.
It is an admitted fact, that a knowledge of error is one of the
nearest ways to truth; and it stands to reason, therefore, that the best
way to teach a person fact, is to begin by cramming him with the
reverse of fact, in any quantity he can be induced to swallow. With
this view we have prepared a few queries, which come under the useful
head of “What to Avoid” in the way of information:—
Q. Who invented cider.
A. M.R. PERRY.
Q. Where is the milk of human kindness to be found in the greatest
perfection?
A. Not within the pail of society.
Q. Are cigars an English invention?
. No!, the cigar is a Spanish article, that has been merely cab-
baged by the British manufacturer.
A BAD business.
. A Gentleman of our acquaintance has asked our advice on the sub-
ject of his pecuniary, affairs, which he says have become so deranged
that all his liabilities have gone out of his mind.
A New Movement Party.
WE have seen, in the columns of a contemporary, an advertisement
commencing with the strange words, “Old FEATHER BEDs RE-
DREssed.” The idea of getting up a movement to redress old Feather
Beds, whose grievances or wrongs cannot lie very heavily upon them, is
a needless excess of ultra liberality. Surely the old Feather Beds ought
to be downy enough to redress themselves.

ASTRAL LITERATURE.
HE readers of Panch
may not be generally
aware there is
ſ/ 2. published in America
2%. a newspaper called
**- the Sidereal Journal,
Sº, which is of course
devoted, as its name
implies, to the stars.
We have not seen a
Number of the pub-
lication, but we can
fancy its contents very
easily. There is, no
doubt, the celebrated
second column, in-
viting some missing star to return to his circle of disconsolate satellites,
and undertaking that if he will only come back in a twinkling, every.
thing shall be forgotten and forgiven.
e dare, say the Sidereal Journal contains an advertisement that
the Band of Orion will attend quadrille parties on reasonable terms,
and that the Great Bear is to be seen alive at a very small charge,
as usual., There will, of course, be an intimation that Saturn,
in the middle of his ring, will go through his celebrated scenes in
the circle ; and that new milk may be had from that very extensive
milk-walk, the Milky Way, in the highest perfection, without any
admixture of sky-blue, at the very lowest prices. The only wonder is,
not how the paper can be filled with matter referring to the Starry
World, but how room can be found for all that relates to it. We
should, however, doubt whether the range of mundane subscribers can
be very large, for the subjects can scarcely be very tempting to the
merely terrestrial reader, unless he is one of those who love to moon
over the stars, and who would be more thoroughly wrapped up in a
comet's tail, than in a story of merely sublunary interest.
THE CONVERSION OF THE ABBſ. LACORDAIRE,
. THE well-known preacher and friar, the ABBf LACORDAIRE, habited
in “the weeds of Dominic,” last week made his first appearance at the
new French Theatre, commonly called the National Assembly. The
Holy Father, on this occasion, made a remark of singular naïveté. He
declared, that “till the 24th of February he had been the advocate of
Monarchy; but that he was now a Republican,”, Verily, the ABBf dis-
played a marvellous adroitness in hitting precisely the nick of time for
changing his opinions. We may presume, that if he had been a Bona-
artist, he would have abjured Bonapartism simultaneously with
APOLEON's flight to Elba; professed Legitimism till the Emperor's
return; resumed that creed after the Battle of Waterloo; and trans-
ferred his allegiance to Louis-PHILIPPE immediately on the Revolution
of July. FATHER LACORDAIRE must have an acute perception of the
direction in which the cat jumps. In point of candour, there exists no
parallel to the avowal of the celebrated ABBł LacoRDAIRE, except the
confession of the equally celebrated Vicar of Bray.
THE SQUEEZEABLES 1
“Now, Sir, in a state of affairs so distressing,
Such serious interests so gravely depressing,
The House, I am sure,
Will be happy to cure -
The effects I’ve described, by their causes redressing,
And all shades of party at once coalescing
In support of the measure,
Which if 'tis the pleasure
Of the House, my right hon'rable friend on the Treasur-
y Bench will at once, Sir, submit to the House”—
(In plain English, “the mountain will bring forth its mouse”).
From the Treasury Bench,
With a wriggle, and wrench
Of papers from pockets, Los D BLANK, begs to ment-
ion the objects in view of himself and his friends;
“How they scorn to look forward to mere party ends,-"
How “The Bill must be carried,”
. How “The people have tarried,
Till their rightful demands can no longer be parried; ”
How, “if Clause one fall flat,
Then Clause two will come pat,
And if one don't do this, t'other’s sure to do that—”
And “how each county grants
The Bill's just what it wants,
From Kent to Caernarvon, from Caithness to Hants—”
When an honºrable Member jumps up in a hurry,
And throws all the Squeezeables into a flurry,
By decº “the measure's quite odious to Surrey
Whereupon my LoRD BLANK
Is sure he “must thank
The honºrable Member,” and lo! hankey-pank-
ey! the Bill, all were scrambling to get, hurry-scurry,
Is, we're told, “not intended, not just now, for Surrey.”
Any sort of objection
Is ground for exception; -
Still the game is the same, of the Squeezeable section;
et the veriest muff
But squeeze 'em enough,
And they fling up their cards, betwixt humbug and huff;
Still, little by little,
. . Go their Bills every tittle
Till, just as a Yankee a big log will “whittle”
To a splinter away,
Thro' a do-nothing day,
So, with every political “promise to pay,”
The Squeezeables “whittle,” to suit all folks' pleasures,
The biggest of Bills to the meagrest of Measures.
Not worth buying, so free from reproach of “venality;”
Never holding their ground, so uncharged with “finality;”
To please foes throwing over supporters, and then
ñº. themselves, with a “measures, not men;” -
Till when spent is the Session 'twixt long-talks and leisures,
We still have the “men,” but can't get at the “measures;”
And at last, tired of tumbling, from bad times to worse,
JoHN BULL, hot in head, as he’s poor in the purse,
Throws the Times down indignant, and swears, “Please the pigs,
He'll take to close shaving and give up his W(h)igs"
1 22
Catch Them at It.
THE Executive of the Chartist “National” Assembly calls upon the
masses to rush and “realise their paper securities.”
an unfeeling mockery of their destitute condition; for, we should be
glad to know what “paper securities” the poor creatures have got, to
realise. The only approach to ºf of the kind will probably
pear to be a number of pawnbrokers' duplicates, and these are not
ways so very easily convertible. A cry calling on the people to
realise this class of paper would not fall under the general head of a
command to “run for gold,” but would come rather in the shape of a
direction to “run for (flat) irons.”
The Prospects of Repealers.
MEssRs. SMITH O'BRIEN, MEAGHER, John O'Connelſ, and other
members of the Old and Young Irish parties, have conjointly signed an
Address to the Irish Repealers, containing the following remarkable,
if not ominous declaration:—“We have all the same bright goal in
view.” This is a very consolatory assurance. We wish, however, that
these United Irishmen had adopted the modern, style of orthography,
and placed the a before the o in spelling the word gaol.
This is very like

THE POLITICAL MACHEATH.
NoTHING, since the days of GARRICK between Tragedy and Comedy, or the
donkey between two bundles of hay, has been half so good as BRough AM
between, France and England. His feelings have been fearfully divided,
and his heart frightfully lacerated by the British Monarchy on the one side,
and the French Republic on the other. Tired of being “everything by turns
and nothing long,” he is now desirous of outstripping his former achievements
by becoming two-things together. He would be a Peer at home and a
simple Citizen abroad, at the very same moment; and in fact, he would sing,
with Macheath — ,
How happy could Ibe with either,
If tºother were not in the way;
But since you thus tempt me together,
Why, what is poor HARRY to say?
He'll sing, Wive la république, right tooral;
If you say to him “What can you mean #"
He'll turn with a run tum fal looral,
And break into “God Save the Queen!”
A PROPHETIC SPEECH FOR LORD JOHN.
MR. CoBDEN's motion, being put, that all useless sinecures—such as that
of Hereditary Grand Falconer-attached to the Royal Household, be
abolished, with a view to the gradual reduction of expenditure—
Lond John Russell rose and said–Sir, never in my life, have I risen to
oppose a motion with greater feelings of mingled pain and pride. Qf pain,
that I should be called upon by any such motion—of pride, tº: as I believe,
I can so triumphantly defeat it. Sir, it has been said by the Hon. Member
for the West Riding, that the office of Grand Falconer is one of pure expense
—is, one carrying with it no duties. This may be, Sir; but when I call to
mind the fact that, although no hawks are kept in the Royal Household,
the doves of conjugal affection build and nestle, as MR. BURRE finel
observes, above “the proud keep of Windsor’—(Loud cheers)—then, Sir,
do say that the motion of the Hon. Gentleman, the Member for the West
Riding, to abolish the sinecure of Hereditary Grand Falconer as one of
useless expense—is an insidious blow levelled at the conjugal happiness of
the Court—is an insult to the worth, and beauty of the highest domestic
existence. (Reiterated cheers). Sir, there may be a Minister bold enough
to entertain such a resolution. I can only say, far be from me the ignominy
of that boldness. There may be a Minister who, blind, and deaf to the
beauty and the music beaming and breathing from the Royal hearth, shall
nevertheless destroy those fictitious hawks, shall scatter to the
winds their baseless perches. I can only say, Sir, I will not be
that Minister. I should consider myself not only as a rebel to the
Crown, but as a traitor to human nature, could I for one moment
entertain the thought of abolishing the post of Grand Falconer.
Sir, while virtue remains more than a name, and Magna Charta
something better than blank foolscap, I-(here his Lordship strikes
his hand a red bor)—I never will do it. (His Lordship sits
down amidst cheers that last for a quarter-of-an-hour.)
Military Intelligence.
There is no truth in the rumour that F. M.; the Duke of
WELLINGton is about to resign his baton to MR, BALPE; nor is it
true that the gallant Nobleman has promised to confer their
majority on three Minor Sevenths belonging to the Line. The
rumour originated in the Duke having arranged to act as Director
of the next Ancient Concert, where it is probable he will put
himself at the head of a determined and well-disciplined band,
resolved on the execution of any task, however difficult, that may
be assigned to them.
OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS.
In these days of rows and revo-
lutions abroad, the foreign Cor-
respondent of a newspaper
must accustom himself to “feats
of broil and battle.” One of
the gentlemen engaged for the
Times begins a paragraph with
the appalling words, “I am
now in the centre of the sar.
dinian king's camp;” and we
fancy, we can see our gallant
confrère writing his “flimsy.”
amid the roar of artillery, and
in the absence of ordinary steel
pens, scribbling away with the
end of a bayonet.
We have some idea of send-
ing out our old friend, the
Brook Green Volunteer, as a
special correspondent, whose military education on the Scrubs, of
ormwood, and whose countersºarping in the ditch that divides
Hammersmith from Notting Hill, must have given him a fund
of military knowledge that
would be very useful to s
him in his reporting capa- W
city. Every foreign cor-
respondent of an English
newspaper ought to go.
through a regular course
of drilling before he enters :
on his duties abroad, for "
there is no knowing how
soon he may require the
qualities of a soldier; for
when an excited people
have once drawn the
sword, they are not parti- - -
cular where they draw the line, and the penny-a-liner may be
the victim of a Revolution before he can turn himself round with
a view to his own safety. One of our correspondents on foreign
service has taken advantage of his very soldier-like position to
express a wish to retire on half-pay, by which he means that he
would like to have one half of his salary for the remainder of his
life, for doing nothing.

OLD CLO !
... THIs should be adopted as the national cry for Germany, which, with
its new habits in politics, is desperately determined on adopting old
ones in attire.
The paletot of the nineteenth century is to give way, all over Deutsch-
land, to the jerkin of the fifteenth, and the chapeau Français to the
bonnet of MAXIMILIAN. The pink of fashion, is henceforth to be the
§ doublet of ALBERT DURER, and slashed hose are to cut out the
umble cotton socks of modern manufacture.
Germany is determined to walk into her political future in the
costume of the past, and at her National Diet the eye, at least, will be
fed with all the motley brilliancy of a masquerade. This may not be
out of place when the Kng of PRussia comes out as a go-ahead
democratic reformer, and the EMPEROR or AUSTRIA as a Progressist of
the first force. At the same time, the hotch-potch of costume will
make of the Frankfort Diet a sort of Potage à la JULLIENNE. We beg
to suggest to the Government of Berlin, the propriety of engaging
MR. PLANCHE to superintend the getting up of the Members, and we
trust that the opposing parties in the German movement, will rest satis-
fied with Fancy Balls instead of the cannon ditto, now in vogue in Posen
and Schleswig.
A DRAWING-ROOM FOR THE MILLION. :
OUR glorious Constitution is so deeply rooted in the affections of HER
MAJESTY's subjects, that certainly neither we, nor our unborn posterity,
shall ever live to see the end of it. It will continue to exist by con:
stantly accommodating itself to popular feeling, until at length it will
have completely gained the hearts of the people at large. We have
taken a long peep into futurity, and are enabled to state that, after the
lapse of a century, Royalty, like our old friend the Sun, will shine
on all classes alike, and, with indiscriminating condescension, will throw
itself open to the hº of everybody. We have cast our prophetic
eye over a paper of the future day, and have therein perused an account
of a Royal Drawing-Room designed for the reception of the masses.
We subjoin the interesting narrative:-
* “H.M.'s Drawing-Room for the Industrious Classes, in manifes-
tation of H.M.'s most gracious sympathy with that portion of the
population, was held yesterday.
“The usual arrangements respecting omnibuses going to and returning
from the Palace, were made by the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN. The regu-
. ºuise to mats at the foot of the Grand Staircase were strictly
eniorced. A
º, “At an early hour the Baths and Washhouses of the Metropolis were
thronged with industrious lieges, in obedience to the regulations of the
Board of Green Cloth touching soap and water.
“The following presentations took place within the Circle:–
“MR. FIGGINs, Grocer, and Wife, by the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN ; MR.
GosLING, Tailor, by the ARCHBishop of CANTERBURY; MEssRs. Hod-
son AND Co., Builders, by the Prime Minister; MR. PITTs, Tanner,
and Daughters, by the Commander-in-Chief; MEssRs. PUMMELL AND
SoN, Saddlers, by the Master of the Horse; Mr. Fºrt Shoemaker, and
Wife, by the LoRD CHANCELLOR; MR. BREVIER, Printer, by Earl
}ººl, MR. STEEL, Hardwareman, by the Minister for Foreign
alms.
“Among the operatives and others next presented, and who enjoyed
the distinguished honour of kissing hands, were
“Laundresses.—MRs. DURDEN, MRs. FAGG, MRs.WADDELL, &c.
“Sempstressess.-Miss BRown, Miss Jones, MIss JEMIMA SMITH,
Miss Polly HoPKINs, &c. &c.
& “Bonnet-Makers.-Miss JAckson, Miss BAKER, Miss MILLs, &c.

&c, &c., &c, &c.; &c.
“Being precluded, by want of space, from giving a full account of the

ollowing:-
“MRs. DURDEN.—A richly flowered bombasin; pattern, red cabbage
roses on a yellow ground. Mob cap. .
tº Row N-Alight blue merino dress, with plain starched collar.
Head-dress, two little bows of pink ribbon.
“Miss Jackson.—Black stuff apron, over brown frock of the same.
Lace, black—with a tag-worn in the chaussure.
.“H.M. was in excellent health and spirits, and was evidently
highly º to receive the good folks who came to pay their
respects. The whole scene was eminently gratifying. It is mainly by
these réunions between the sovereign .# the people that a feeling of
attachment to the Throne has been preserved amongst us, and thus has
secured to us our mild, and limited monarchy; whilst a neighbourin
nation, after having undergone twenty revolutions, lies crushed beneat
the hoof of a military despotism.” I
BRITISH MANUEACTURES TRIUMPHANT.
OUR ladies have been requested to wear British Manufactures. Our
smokers to smoke British cigars. Our elderly gentlewomen, to make
their tea with the British sloe-leaf. Our students to drink British
coffee. Our pawnbrokers to advance at their highest rates on British
late. Our bread-eaters to limit their appetites to British wheat. Our
eefeaters to insist on certificates that their steaks, are cut from the
British Bull. The proprietors of the Zoological Gardens to show none
but the British Lion. The West-End houses, and Clubs to emplo
none but British cooks. Our merchants to deal with none but Britis
customers. Qur sailors to sail to none but British ports. . .
Such are the demands of an enlightened national feeling. We
rejoice to add that the demand is being generally answered by compli-
ance. The consequences are most ºf The employment of our
manufacturing labourers has fallen off one half .
Manchester is paying a million less per week in wages.
The Commerce of Liverpool is annihilated. -
Nottingham, Derby, Salford, and Ieeds have thrown stocking-
machines, Jacquard-looms, and spinning-jennies out of gear.
Our old ladies are suffering from the cholic, and our hedges are bare
of hawthorn leaves. - -
The F. of lettuces is enormously enhanced, and Havannah is
reduced to chew her own tobacco. - -
The Pool and the Docks are filled with ships, carefully protected
from the weather; and our over-wrought sailors are enjoying that
leisure so indispensable to the cultivation of their neglected minds.
MR, LABLAsh (a stout gentleman from the West of England, with
an odd pronunciation of his native tongue) announces an entertainment
from the works of the late T. DIBDIN, assisted by MR. CoSTER at the
pianoforte; while, MRs. JULIA GREAsy (an Irish lady of great vocal
accomplishments) is singing in The Beggar's Opera in the Haymarket,
with young MR. MARYow, a handsome gent., apparently of the Hebrew
persuasion, with a moustache.
All the infamous foreigners, the JEFFERINIs, and Jonesis, and BILL-
sMITHIs, and Col.IINSIs, who so long have fattened on, pickings from
the British public, have disappeared from the playbills, and native
talent—and nothing but native talent—is everywhere recognised.
HER MAJESTY, with her noble British consort, and her British rose-
buds, enjoys #ritish music from a British brass-band, with singularly
Teutonic physiognomies, and an inablity to pronounce the “th.” -
“Ici on parle Anglais,” is placarded in all the milliners' windows in
Oxford Street and Langham Place, and that popular British, clown,
AURIoI, is alternating jokes and somersaults with BARRY, at Astleys,
where Miss ANN HATOE and Miss CARQLine, nightly delight crowds
of enthusiastic admirers of National British Sports. -
French and German are no longer taught in our schools; and, in one
word, we have, in the enjoyment of our own blessings, proudly ignored
the contemptible existence of the adjacent island—of Europe-Asia-
Africa, with the more distant one of North, and South America.
England has, in fact, cut the world. What will become of the latter?

Foreign and Home Relations.
“WHAT is the meaning of “diplomatic relations?’” inquired a young
GREY of his uncle, SIR GEORGE, upon receiving a lucrative Secretary-
ship. “Hush!” exclaimed the startled Home Secretary, looking round
him, “Never ask that question again. It might compromise us”. And
then whispering into his nephew's ear, he gave the following definition:
“Diplomatic relations’ mean the number of relations which our family
have in all the diplomatic appointments of the country.”. The last
reinforcement to the strong regiment of the GREYs was satisfied.

* LOLA MONTEZ.”
MR. URQUHART, seeing the Noble Lord the Secretary for Foreign
Affairs in his place, would wish to ask him if he had any objection to
roduce the correspondence between himself and MR.
§. on the subject of Lola Montez? -
CoLoREL SIETHORP jumped up to order. Whilst he
had a seat in that House—and he had represented the
Cathedral of Lincoln for three hundred years, at least
his family had, which was all the same and intended to
represent it, at least so long as Whigs, and Chartists,
and other ragamuffins, left anything in that House to re-
resent—where was he?–Oh!—he remembered-Whilst
H. had a seat in that House he would never listen to
such a question as that put by the Hon. Member for
Stafford. What had that House to do with such a º
as LoLa MonTEz? What had they to do with MR.
WEBSTERP. The woman might be a very good dancer;
and MR. WEBstER, for an American, (laughter)—he saw
nothing to laugh at—for an American, might be a decent
sort of individual enough; but what had an English
Parliament to do with the affairs of such people?
MR. URQUHART explained. . The gallant. and tre-
mendous Colonel had misunderstood him. question

MR. SPOONER º: that this country would º:
the demon of Revolution—the travelling earthquake, he
would, call it—that was taking its round, of the world.
But when he knew that money was subscribed to buy an
actor and a ºf. house, that had much better been
pulled down, the foundations turned up by the plough,
and the land sowed with salt—when he knew that Royalty
itself, and the Aristocracy, nay, even the Bishops of this
country, had subscribed for such an unhallowed purpose,
he would—he must—he could not do otherwise—than
take upon himself to tremble for the solidity of the
emplme. -
. LoRD, PALMERSTON said he would take time to con-
sider whether he would produce the correspondence
alluded to by the Hon. Member for Stafford. Perhaps
he would, perhaps he would not. He had no real objection
to do either one thing or the other, or both; or, as he
had intimated before, neither. -
MR. DISRAELI observed that the }. Hon.Secretary
for Foreign Affairs, like the oracles of old, spokeinriddles.
It well became the policy of a Whig Government to do
so;, they might thereupon obtain the benefit of a lucky
doubt, and have an accidental reputation for wisdom
not pertaining to them. (Cheers.) The Ri Hon.
* Secretary was in one of his arbitrary moods. He seemed,
in his imagination, to be playing with that, ingenious
instrument with which his name would especially descend
to posterity—a protocol. That official piece of paper, in
the hands of the Right Hon. Secretary, reminded him
(MR. D.) of the adroit inventive powers of an individual
well known in London streets, who, with a single sheet
of paper, would produce the form of anything. “Now,”
says that paper magician--who ought to have been a
Foreign Secretary in Utopia (cheers and laughter)—“now
it is a chest of drawers—now it is an arm-chair—now a
coalscuttle—and now a lady's fan.” There was nothi
that a twist, a fold of that paper would not represent,
twitched by the foolscap conjurer. In the like manner
the Right Hon. Secretary, would no doubt twist and
twirl the correspondence alluded to; making it now an
arm-chair, in which the KING OF BAVARIA should only
feel too happy to enjoy himself; now a coal-scuttle, to
heap fuel upon our foreign relations (cheers); now a chest
of drawers, locking up in diplomatic darkness its own
secrets (laughter); and now a lady's fan, to “brain” even the Hon. and
gallant Member for Lincoln.

was prepared to show that the bolero of MRs. KEELEY

atronage of the realm should be vouchsafed to the
oreigner; but must the English manager—our own
manufacture—be thus unjustly made a loser?
SIR GEORGE GREY asked if they were to permit the
stage to be a school for Chartism Was the Haymarket
to be a theatre of ease to Kemnington Common? MR.
WEBSTER, as a special constable—and he (SIR GEORGE)
would do the manager this justice; he had particularly

could be induced to take the office, if hampered with the
objection of either ºf an English play or seeing
one. For his own part, he was very sorry that MR.
WEBSTER had lost by the omission of MRs. KEELEY’s
bolero, or fandango, or whatever it was. But couldn't it
be introduced in anything else P Of course it could ;
and therefore the Hon. Member for Montrose was not
justified in attacking the House on the weak side of its
sympathy. (Hear.) There was good reason—so much he
would say—for the withdrawal of Lola Montez. The
Bavarian Ambassador had applied for his passport—a cab
was at the door—and his carpet-bag in the passage 1
MR. W. J. Fox observed that he was not appalled
even by the frightful picture of threatened war, painted
and conveyed by the Right Hon. Baronet, in a passport
—a cab-and a carpet-bag. (Cheers.). For his own part,
he would have a theatre-emphatically a royal theatre;
wherein all the Crowned Heads of the world might be
represented, for at once the warning and the edification
of themselves and the English public. He thought they
would be all the better if their Ambassadors could thus
transmit to their several employers the opinions held
of them in this country. He looked upon the appoint-
ment of a theatrical censor in the person of the LORD
CHAMBERLAIN as tyrannous and unconstitutional. It
was a joke to write up—as had been written-over the
playhouse proscenium veluti in speculum, when the wand
of the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN, by cracking the glass, might
give to its representations any falsity of distortion.

MR. URQUHART begged, in conclusion, to move for a

A VISIT TO JENNY LIND.
BEFORE THE squEEZE.
AFTER THE SQUEEZE.
A PRESIDENT'S CALL TO ORDER.]
THE Legislature of France is making noise
enough in Europe, but much more noise than
enough within its own walls. According to the
Times, after a protracted scene of yelling, shout-
ing, screaming, and scrambling for the tribune
in the French National Assembly, the Pre-
sident, with a tone of despairing wretchedness,
exclaimed, “En verité, en verité, citoyens, nous
donnons un spectacle pew digne.”. Nobody will
dispute the justice of the remark. Really, the
poor President ought to be furnished with some
effectual means of enforcing order in the As-
sembly. . At present he is merely provided with
a bell, which may serve very well to give an inti-
mation of muffins, but is wholly insufficient for
proclaiming silence, and quelling the h OO
of more than five hundred persons, each endeavour-
ing to put down the other by clamour. A good
steam whistle should be placed at his command ;
or, what would be better, a gigantic watchman's
rattle, to be set in action, when necessary, by the
same tremendous agent. A contrivance which
would prevent the whole body from being heard
together, would perhaps have the effect of in-
ducing its Members to allow themselves to be
heard in their turns. That is, if any mortal
power could procure peace among these u
roarious senators; but we fear that nobody
but JUPITER Tonans—in the strongest sense of
. *—wua effect that very desirable
object.
FAILURE AND FustLAN.—A morning contem-
porary states that a firm at Manchester, extensive
manufacturers of fustian, have stopped payment.
We believe that this catastrophe was occasioned
by the recent failure in Ireland of MITCHELL AND
Co., the well-known dealers in the same article.
THE MODEL BABY.
T is the image of its father, unless
it is the very picture of its mother.
It is the best tempered little thing
in the world, never crying but in
the middle of the ni ht, or scream-
ing, but when it is being washed.
It is astonishing how quiet, it is
whilst, feeding. It understands
everything, and proves its love for
learning by tearing the leaves out
of every book, and grasping with
both hands at the engravings.
It is the cleverest child that was
ever born, and says “papa,”, or
something very like it, when
scarcely a month old. it takes
early toP. whiskers, preferring
those of strangers. It has only one
complaint, and that is the wind;
but it is frequently troubled with
it. It is the most wonderful child
that was ever seen, and would
swallow both its tiny fists, if it
was not for a habit of choking. It
dislikes leaving home, rarely stopping on a visit, longer than a day.
It has a strange hostility for its nurse's caps and nose, which it will
clutch and hold, with savage tenacity, if in the least offended. . It
is never happy but in its mother's arms, especially if it is, being
nursed by a gentleman. It prefers the floor to the cradle, which it
never stops in º: than it can help. It is, very playful, delighting
in pulling, the table-cloth off, or knocking the china ornaments off
the mantelpiece, or upsetting its food on somebody's lap. It invents
a new, language, of its own, almost before it can speak, which is
perfectly intelligible to its parents, though Greek to every one else. It
is not fond of public entertainments, invariably crying before it has been
at one five minutes. It dislikes, treachery in any shape, and repels the
spoonful of sugar if it fancies there is a powder at the bottom of it.
Medicine is its greatest horror, next to cold water. It has no particular
love for dress, generally tearing to pieces any handsome piece of finery,
lace especially, as soon as it is put on. It inquires deeply into every-
thing, and is very penetrating in the construction of a the
economy of a work-box, or the anatomy of a doll, which it likes all the
better without, any head or, arms. It has an intuitive hatred of a
doctor, and fights with all its legs, and hands, and first teeth, against his
endearments. It has a most extraordinary taste for colours, imbibing
them greedily in every shape, more especially from the wooden tenants
of Noah's Ark, which are to be found in the mouth of every baby. In
fact, there never was a child like it, and the Model . proves this b
surviving the thousand-and-one, experiments of rival grannies an
mothers-in-law, and outliving, to the athletic age of kilts and bare legs,
the villanous compounds of GoDFREY and DALEY, and the whole poison-
chest of Elixirs, Carminatives, Cordials, and Pills, which babies are
physically heir to.
RULES FOR THE FRENCH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.
LIBERTY, FRATERNITY, EQUALITY.
THE blic demands that the Members of the National Assembly
shall stand on their dignity—the dignity of France. It therefore
requires that they shall not jump upon their benches. - -
he Republic recognises, the necessity of manners. Accordingly, it
ordains that no Citizen shall interrupt another while speaking:
The voice of the people must be heard in the National Assembly.
This will be impossible, unless Members speak, in succession. The
Republic on this account decrees that no two Citizens shall make their
speeches simultaneously. The Republic also recommends Citizens not
to shout from their seats whilst any Citizen is rushing to the tribune.
The Republic owns the supremacy of business; and desires Citizen
Members not to interrupt it by altercation.

MR. SNOB'S REMONSTRANCE WITH MR. SMITH.
“MY DEAR SMITH.—WHEN we last met at the
Polyanthus Club you showed me so remark-
ably cold a shoulder, that I was hurt by your
change of behaviour, and inquired the cause
of the alteration. You are a kind and excel-
lent friend, and used to tip me, when I was
a boy at school; and I was glad to find that
you had public and not private causes for
your diminished cordiality. Jones imparted
to me your opinion that a previous letter of
- mine in this periodical was of so dangerons
and disloyal a character, that honest men should avoid the author. He
takes leave to exculpate himself through the same medium.
“All our difference, my dear Sir, is as to the method of displaying
loyalty. Without fulsome professions for the virtuous and excellent
young matron and lady who fills the Throne now a days, one may ſeel
that those private virtues and excellencies are amongst her noblest titles
of honour, and, without, in the least implicating the royal personage
seated in it, quarrel with the taste of some of the ornaments of the
Throne. I do believe that some of these are barbarous, that they often
put the occupant of that august seat in a false and ridiculous position,
and that it would be greatly to the advantage of her dignity if they
were away.
“You recollect our talk at the Polyanthus, relative to the private
letters which passed between Louis-PHILIPPE and the Sovereign of this
country, which, the present French Government has thought fit to
republish. “Why," said you, "did they condescend to make public these
private letters? What could it matter to Europe to know whether, in
the yºf from Dover to Calais, “my poor MonTEENSIER” was dreadfully
sick, and the king did not suffer at all?” Royal families must have their
talk and gossip, like any other domestic circles. Why placard the town
with this harmless private gossip, and drag innocent people into
F.” And indeed, with the exception of that pretty letter to the
rincess. Royal, (in which her ‘old cousin’ Louis-PHILIPPE announces
to her his present of a doll with six-and-twenty suits of clothes, and
exhibits himself very amiably and artlessly for once, as a kind-hearted
old grandfather and gentleman,) it is a pity that the whole correspond-
ence were not consigned to the bottom of that ocean which made “my
poor Montpensiºn” so unwell.
“But if the privacy of Royalty is not to be intruded upon, why is it
ºf thrust, in our faces? Why is that Court Newsman not
stifled? I say that individual is one of the barbarous adjuncts of the
Crown, whom we ought to abolish, and whom it is an honest man's
duty to hoot of the stage... I say it is monstrous, immodest, unseemly,
that in our time such details should occupy great columns of the news.
papers, as that of a Royal Christening, for instance, which appeared
the other day, in which you read as follows—
“‘His Royal. HIGHNEss THE PRINCE of WALEs was dressed in sky-blue velvet,
embroidered with gold. The dress of PRINCE ALFRED was of white and silver, and the
three Princesses were all dressed alike in frocks of British lace, in imitation of Mechlin
lace, with flounces of the same over white satin.
*** His Royal HighNEss PRINCE ALBrar and the Duke of WELLINGron were habited
in the uniform of Field-Marshals; the Prince wore the collars of the Garter and the
Bath, and the ensigns of the Golden Fleece.
““The Royal infant was dressed in a robe of Honiton lace over white satin, and was
attended by the Dowagen LADY LTTTElton. Her Royal Highness was carried by the ==
head nurse.”
“Gracious Goodness! is it bringing ridicule on the Throne to say that
such details as these are ridiculous? Does it add to the dignity of the
§: persons in this country that other citizens should be told that
RINCE ALFRED wore white and silver, and the little Princesses were
all dressed alike in frocks of British lace, in imitation of Mechlin, with
flounces of the same, over white satin P Suppose their Royal High.
nesses wore their frocks inside out, what the deuce does it matter to
us?. These details may interest MR. MANTALINI, but not men in
England. They should not be put before us. Why do we still laugh
at people for kissing the Pope's toe, or applaud MACARTNEy's British
spirit, in the last age, for refusing kotoo to the EMPEROR or CHINAP
This is just as bad as kotoo. Those people degrade the Throne who do not
remove from it these degrading Middle-Age ceremonials—as barbarous
as absurd, as unreasonable as QUEEN QUAshyMABoo's cocked-hat and
epaulets, or KING MumBo-Jumbo's glass beads and tinsel.
“When the procession of the sponsors and Her MAJESTY's pro-
cession had passed, and the QUEEN and the other Royal personages
were conducted to their seats, the following corale was performed—
such a corale as was seldom presented to an infant before:–
“In life's gay morn, ere sprightly youth
By sin and folly is enslaved,
O, may the Maker's glorious name
Be on thy infant mind engraved 1
So shall no shade of sorrow cloud
The sunshine of thy early days,
But happiness, in endless round,
Shall still encompass all thy ways.”
“Now, MR. SMITH, on your honour and conscience, does the publica-
tion of stuff like this add to, or diminish the splendour of the Throne?
Is it true that if, in ‘the morning of youth,’ the Princess is brought up
iously, she is sure of endless happiness to ‘encompass all her ways.”
ho says so? Who believes it? Does it add to your respect for the
Head of the State, to represent HER MAJEsty to your imagination sur-
rounded by Bishops, Marshals, and Knights in their collars, Gold Sticks,
Sponsor-proxies, and what not, seated in the place of Divine Worship
listening to such inane verses? No; the disrespect is not on our side
who protest. No ; the disloyalty is with those who acquiesce in cere-
monies so monstrous and so vain. O Archbishop, is this the way
ſº should renounce the pomps and vanities of ihis wicked world? |
it is these ceremonies which set more people against you and your
§ º all your sermons can convince, or your good example keep
althful.
“And I say that we are, Mr. Punch and all, a loyal and affectionate
people, and that we exult when we see the great personages of the
Crown worthily occupied. Take the meeting of last Thursday, for
instance, for the Improvement of the Labouring Classes, at which His
Royal HIGHNEss The PRINce attended and spoke.
* Depend upon it that the interests of often contrasted classes are identical, and it
is only ignorance which prevents their uniting to the advantage of each other. (Cheers.)
To dispel that ignorance, and to show how man can help man, notwithstanding the com-
plicated state of civilized society, ought to be the aim of every philanthropic person.
(Loud cheers.) This is more peculiarly the duty of those who, under the blessing of
Divine Providence, enjoy station, wealth, and education." (Cheers.)
“Every man who heard that, I say, cheered with all his heart.
‘These are imperial words, and worthy kings.” There is no Gold Stick
in this empire, no Vice-Chamberlain, Groom, of the Stole, Hereditary
Grand Dancing Master or Quarterly Waiter in Waiting, that will yield
to Mr. Punch and your humble servant in loyalty, when words, such, as
these are spoken, and in such aspirit: and it is in tasks like these that
Princes mºst busy themselves if in our times they ask for loyalty from
others or security for themselves. The hold of the great upon us now
is by beneficence, not by claptraps and ceremonies. The people is and
knows itself to be the stronger. Wisdom, simplicity, affection, must
be the guardians of the English Throne; and, may God keep those
Gentlemen-ushers about the Court of QUEEN VICTORIA!
FAST CLERGYMEN.
Y a recent debate in the
House of Commons, on Ca-
thedrals and Collegiate
Churches, we find that a
“Fast Man” has become a
very necessary instrument in
the hands of a clerical plu-
ralist. The rate at which it
is necessary to run through
a number of ºil. 80 as
to give a regular church-ser-
vice—sermon included—at
each, has introduced a num-
ber of literally flying par-
sons, who are capable of
riding thirty miles an hour,
getting through the duty in
- forty minutes, allowing eight
for an original discourse, and officiating at seven different places in the
course of a single Sunday. -
We shall expect to see our sporting contemporary, Bell's Life in Lon-
don, full of advertisements from “the ReverEnd Joe Banks, the Cleri-
cal Stunner,” or “Ephraim S.MoothFace, the Protestant Stag,” under-
taking to back themselves to ride filty miles, preach four sermons, read
prayers six times, and marry twenty couple within ten hours, allowing
one for refreshment and stoppages. If the “Fast” system is con-
tinued in the Church, it will º: advisable for every candidate for holy
orders to show his skill, not only in getting over the Pons, asinorum;
but also in the mounting equorum; and the scholastic curriculum will
not be more indispensable than a course in the ring at Astley's, or some
other riding-school. The curate of St. Peter's will have to qualify
in the same way as the courier of St. Petersburg, and he may expect
to come galloping into his village six-in-hand, with his legs bestride
on the necks of his chargers.
Rather Superfluous.
THE Bishops dined in the Mansion House on Tuesday, the 16th.
We are informed in the next paragraph that the entertainments con-
sisted “of the greatest delicacies of the season.” We think this is
being a little too particular; but penny-a-liners never will leave anything
to the imagination of the reader.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LADIES” ART OF BIETTING.
Do not bet for money. Tt is vulgar,
and was never meant to cross
anything but a gipsey's hand.
But gloves are open to you, and
you are at liberty to bet as many
pair as you like. You can do this
very pleasantly over your chicken
and champagne; and the betting
is not attended with any great
risk, , as . you might foolishly
imagine, for it stands to reason,
that if you lose, you do not pay;
and if you win, you are provided
with gloves all the year round.
Beware of defaulters, however;
and do not bet with any gentleman
who has not paid his last year's
losses, or who is mean enough to
remind you of your own. Do not back the favourite, but take the
entire field, by which is meant all the other, horses, and, not the
race-course before you, as you might probably imagine; and by this
means you have generally 10 good chances to 1 bad one. Always
stipulate for French kid, if you win—for Houbigants, if you can-
as we once knew a young gentleman, send a lady a dozen pair which
looked uncommonly like dog's-skin; but then he was only a clerk in
Somerset House. If your better is a very nice fellow, you can give him
one of your gloves as a specimen, to treasure as a keepsake. -
There is no TATTERsALL's for ladies' where they can...post their
defaulters; but it is usual to do it at the very first quadrille or polka
party they meet at after the Derby. Try º; requesting the address
of his gantier; if he takes no notice of this hint, then you are perfectly
warranted in calling him ever afterwards a “shabby ſellow,” or even, “a
blackleg,” if you like, and in being always engaged “six deep” when
he asks you to dance.
By common attendance to the above rules of betting, a young lady
may find herself in gloves for every Horticultural, Floricultural, and
Botanical fête during the season, at the very smallest possible cost.
“ CLUB DES FEMMES.”
At a time when the gentlemen of France are asserting the “Rights
of Man,” no wonder the ladies are protesting against the “Wrongs of
Woman.” Amongst the many Clubs, which the temporary triumph
of Cub-law has engendered in Paris, there was lately opened a “Club
des Femmes.” At its first sitting much confusion was created by the
criticisms of a number of the Lords of the Creation, who had intruded
themselves upon the assemblage. This is unfair. What would be the
result if a corps of ladies was let loose to criticise the House of Com-
mons? The “Club des Femmes” has promulgated the following
CODE OF RIGHTS.
. Woman naturally is superior to man. The rule of the husband by
the wife is in the order of nature.
. The wife is the natural guardian of her husband's secrets,
- * wife belongs the absolute control of her own milliners'
Ills.
. The extreme age of woman is thirty years. She may be below
this age, but cannot pass beyond it.
. Woman has a right to her opinions. It is an odious tyranny which
enforces the reasons of them.
.
:
CODE OF DUTIES.
1. It is the duty of the woman to insist on her own way. This duty
is paramount. The end justifies the means.
. It is the duty of the wife to love and honour her husband. The
word “obey” is abolished except as a duty of husbands.
. It is the duty of every woman to set off those advantages with
which Nature has provided her. Dress is thus invested with
the sanctity of a religious observance.
4. The human species is the only one which clothes itself, amuses
itself, and cooks its food. Woman, as the highest being in the
scale of the human species, has exclusive sovereignty in the
thlee domains of the Table, the Toilet, and Society.
:
Pr0.JECTS OF LAWS.
1. A law rendering it penal in husbands to grumble at cold meat.
2. A law imposing various terms of imprisonment on the husband
who complains of a deficiency of shirt-buttons, struggles for the
last word, or exhibits impatience while his wife is dressing.
3. A law to constitute and punish the offence of lèze-marriage, or
conjugal treason—of which shall be adjudged guilty,

RAILWAY CHARGES.
Charges on a railway for scalding yourself with a
j of tea or a basin of soup are extraordinary, but
still we think they lag far behind those of the rail-
way hotels. The bill is always made out on the prin-
ciple of never seeing the visitor again. He is there-
fore charged as much as his patience or his purse
will bear, which is a sure plan of never inducing
him to return. Our feelings towards Southampton,
for instance, are anything but friendly, and the next
time we visit that inhospitable town, we shall walk
up and down the pier all night, or go to bed in the
boiler of the engine, sooner than submit to the
atrocious impositions of the railway hotels. We
were in one for five minutes, during which time the
waiter exchanged just three words with us, when
we were asked at the door for “one shilling.”
“What for "we indignantly exclaimed. “Attend-
ance, Sir, one shilling.” It is true we might have
stopped all the night conversing with the same
attendant for the same amount; still, we thought
that ſourpence a word was a trifle too dear, even to
converse with a waiter at Southampton.
We beg to draw up a small scale of prices, moderate
too, for the general use of railway hotels.

This would do capitally for a casual visitor; but
if a person slept there, immense ingenuity might be
shown in the high valuation of each separate item,
recollecting always that it is not very likely you will
ever see the visitor again. The following would not

Was there ever such a cannihal? And this is the man who would

beadle, boots against cook . . No lady, no gentleman is safe. The

the greatest Traiteur in England, or even Ireland; and the latter is
sayinz, at present, an immense deal.

PUNCH. OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RAILWAY ARCHITECTURE.
THE only sort of architecture that seems to form a study among those
who build for Railways, is the art of becoming, as speedily as pos-
sible, the architects of their
own fortunes. These gen-
tlemen seem disposed, na-
turally enough, to tile
themselves comfortably in,
but they do not display
much taste in selecting the
appropriate styles of achi-
tecture for any station but
their own, which they seem
anxious to render as exalted
as possible. The various
lines of Railway accordingly
present specimens of nearly
every order; and the tra-
veller cannot keep his ideas
or his imagination within
any consecutive train, for al-
most every place he arrives
2t presents some deviation
from the style of architec-
ture he has just left behind him. On the late Croydon Atmospheric, for
instance, the stations assume an ecclesiastico-rural shape, for they have
the outward form of village churches, though that of Mammon is the
only worship that is going on inside them. On the great lines of Rail:
way one may fancy one's self traversing all the countries in the world
within half-an-hour, for he is very likely to encounter an old English
ticket-office, a Turkish water-tank, a Swiss engine-house, a Grecian
goods depôt, and an Italian terminus, all within the limits of fifteen
miles of railway. He may find comprised in the same space a refresh-
ment-room a la wigwam, and a signal-man's watch-box built in imitation
of CLEOPATRA's Needle, all ready threaded with the wire of the electric
telegraph. We should be glad to see the Uniformity of Practice Act
put in force with reference to the architecture of Railway buildings in
general, and Railway stations in particular.
CURIOSITIES OF ECHOES.
..We have had innumerable Echoes, affirmative and negative, Hiber-
nian and American, and otherwise. The following, we think, is pretty
worthy to be added to the collection:—
* Eighteen years since, LAwarnck ended his brilliant and lucrative career. Who has
risen to fill his place f And in that interval, have we not lost Wilkie, Coxstablk, &c. :
Who has comeforward to supply their loss? To both questions, Echo Axswkus, ‘Who 2 " "
The preceding Echo is borrowed from the Morning Chronicle of May
11th. We wonder a newspaper has never been started under the title
of Echo, for it seems to answer better than anything else.
What an amusing book might be made of all the questions which
Echo has answered in its time P And Echo comes to our aid, and
says-“Wouldn't it—if beautifully illustrated, and brought out in
shilling Parts? I believe you, my bo-o-o-oy "
Rumoured Ministerial Changes.
. It is rumoured that Ministers intend to pass one measure of public
importance before they adjourn this Session. A remedial Bill is like-
wise to be brought forward for Ireland, previous to Parliament
being prorogued. These are onlv rumours, but if they are realised, they
will be the greatest Ministerial Changes that have occurred since LoRD
John has been in power.
The Powers that Be, in Paris.
FRANCE is not altogether in a state of anarchy. That country still
owns the authority of a sort of law, which, emanating from the various
Clubs of Paris, may with propriety be discribed as Club-law. MES-
sIEuas BARBEs and BLANQui appear to be Knaves of Clubs; and it is
difficult to determine which is the greater knave of the two. We are
happy to see that one of these Cards is taken.
MR. MITCHEL AT HOME.
THE Irish intelligence of the Times the other day contained the
ſollowing description, by an eye-witness, of MR. MITCHEL as he appeared
in Newgate:—
“In a small flagged court-yard stood an Irish citizen and an Irish patriot, surrounded
by the pickpockets and burglars who have been committed for hideous crimes.”
Really, some improved system of classification ought to be adopted in
prisons, Certainly the crimes of pickpockets and burglars are very
great;. but, stealing pocket-handkerchiefs, and breaking open houses,
are infinitely less atrocious than instigation to wholesale massacre.
However hideous may have been the crimes of the pickpockets,
those comparative innocents ought not to have been reduced to asso-
ciate with the man of pikes and vitriol. As for that person, no doubt
he ſelt comfortable enough in the society of his betters, and, under the
same roof with them, found himself perſectly at home.
A LITTLE DINNER AT TIMM INS’S.
MR. and MRs. FitzRoy TIMMINs live in Lilliput Street, that neat
little street which runs at right angles with the Park and Brobdingmag.
Gardens. It is a very genteel neighbourhood, and I need not say they
are of a good family. -
Especially MRs. TIMMINs, as her mamma is always telling MR.T.
They are Suffolk people, and distantly related to the Right Honourable
the EARL of BUNGAY.
Besides his house in Lilliput Street, MR. TIMMINs has Chambers in
Figtree Court, Temple, and goes the Northern Circuit.
The other day, when there was a slight difference about the payment
of fees between the great Parliamentary Counsel and the Solicitors,
Stoke and PoggRs, of Great George Street, sent the papers of the
Lough Foyle and Lough Corrib Junction Railway to MR. FitzRoy
TIMMINs, who was so elated that he instan']y purchased a couple of
looking-glasses for his drawing-rooms (the front room is 16 by 12, and
the back a tight but elegant apartment, 10 ſt. 6 by 8 ft. 4), a coral for
the baby, two new dresses for MRs. TIMMIxs, and a little rosewood
desk, at the Pantechnicon, for which Rosa had long been sighing, with
crumpled legs, emerald-green and gold morocco top, and drawers all
over. -
Mrs. TrMMINs is a very pretty poebess (her “Lines to a Faded
Tulip,” and her “Plaint of Plimlimmon,” appeared in one of last year's
Keepsakes), and FitzRoy, as he impressed a kiss on the snowy forehead
of his bride, pointed out to her, in one of the innumerable pockets of the
desk, an elegant ruby-tipped pen, and six charming little gilt blank
books, marked “My Books,” which MRs. FitzRoy might fil, he said,
(he is an Oxford man, and very polite) “with the delightful productions
of her Muse.” Besides these books, there was pink paper, paper with
crimson edges, lace j. all stamped with R.F.T. (Rosa FitzRoy TIM-
MINs), and the hand and battle-axe, the crest of the TIMMINSEs (and borne
at Ascalon by Roaldus De TIMMINs, a crusader, who is now buried in
the Temple Church, next to SERJeANT SNooks), and yellow, pink, light-
blue, and other scented sealing-waxes, at the service of Rosa when she
chose to correspond with her friends.
Rosa, you may be sure, jumped with joy at the sight of this sweet
present; called her CHARLEs (his first name is SAMUEL, but they have
sunk that) the best of men! embraced him a great number of times, to
the edification of her buttony little page, who stood at the landing ;
and as soon as he was gone to Chambers, took the new pen and a sweet
sheet of paper, and began to compose a poem.
“What shall it be about?” was naturally her first thought. “What
should be a young mother's first inspiration?” Her child lay on the
sola asleep, before her; and she began in her neatest hand-

“How beautiful! how beautiful thou seemest,
My boy, my precious one, my rosy babe!
Kind angels hover round thee, as thou dreamest:
Soft lashes hide thy beauteous azure eye which gleamest.”
“Gleamest? thine eye which gleamest? Is that grammar?” thought
Rosa, who had puzzled her little brains for some time with this absurd
question, when baby woke; then the cook came up to ask about dinner;
then MRs. Fundy slipped over from No. 27, (they are opposite neigh-
bours, and mºde an acquaintanee through MRs. FUNDy's macaw):... and
a thousand things happened. Finally, there was no rhyme to habe
except TIPPoo SAIB (against whom MAJOR GAshLeigh, Rosa's grand-
father, had distinguished himself,) and so she gave up the little poem
about her DE BRACY.
Nevertheless, when FitzRoy returned from Chambers to take a walk
with his wife in the Park, as he peeped through the rich tapestry

hanging which divided the two drawing-rooms, he found his dear girl
still seated at the desk, and writing, writing away with her ruby pen
as fast at it could scribble.
“What a genius that child has 1” he said; “why, she is a second
MRs. Norton " and advanced smiling to peep over her shoulder and
see what prettything Rosa was composing. -
jºi
||
It was not poetry, though, that she was writing, and Fitz read as
follows:—
“Lilliput Street, Tuesday, 22nd May.
“Mr. and MRs. FITzRoy Tywmyss request the pleasure of SIR
º Lady Kºuww. company at dinner on Wednesday, at
o'clock.” -
“My dear!” exclaimed the barrister, pulling a long face.
“Law, FitzRoy!” cried the beloved of his bosom, “how you do
startle one!” -
“Give a dinner party with our means!” said he. -
“Ain’t you making a fortune, you miser?” Rosa said. “Fifteen
guineas a day is fourthousand five hundred a year; I've calculated it.”
And, so saying, she rose, and, taking hold of his whiskers, (which are as
fine as those of any man of his circuit,) she put her mouth close up
against
and did something to his long face, which quite changed the expression
of it: and which the little page heard outside the door.
“Our dining-room won’t hold ten,” he said. -
“We'll only ask twenty,” my love; “ten are sure to refuse in this
season, when everybody is giving parties. Look, here is the list.”
“EARL AND Countess of Bungay, and Lady BARBARA SAINT
MARY's.”
“You are dying to get a Lord into the house," TIMMINs said (he has
not altered his name in Fig-tree Court yet, and therefore I am not so
affected as to call him Tymmyns). “Law, my dear, they are our cousins,
and must be asked,” Rosa said.
“Let us put down my sister and Tom Crowder, them.”
“BLANche CRowder is really so very fat, FitzRoy,” his wife said,
“and our rooms are so small.”
Fitz laughed. “You little rogue,” he said, “LADY BUNGAY weighs
two of Blanche, even when she’s not in the f-"
“Fiddlestick!” Rose cried out. “Doctor CRowper really cannot
be admitted; he makes such a noise eating his soup, that it is really quite
disagreeable;” and she imitated the gurgling noise performed by the
Doctor while inhausting his soup, in such a funny way, that FITz saw
inviting him was out of the question.
“Besides, we mustn't have too many relations,” Rosa went on.
“Mamma, of course, is coming. She doesn't like to be asked in the
evening; and she’ll bring her silver bread-basket, and her candlesticks,
which are very rich and handsome.”
T “And you complain of BLANCHE for being too stout!” groaned out
IMM-Ins. -
“Well, well, don't be in a pet,” said little Rosa. “The girls won't
come to dinner; but will bring their music afterwards.” And she went
on with the list.
“SiR Thomas and LADY KICKLEBURY, 2. No saying no: we must
ask them, CHARLEs. They are rich people, and any room in their
house in Brobdingmag Gardens would swallow up our humble cot. But
to people in our position in society, they will be glad enough to come.
The City people are glad to mix with the old families.”
“Very good,” said Fitz, with a sad face of assent—and Mrs.
TIMMINs went on reading her list.
“MR. and MRs. Topham Sawyer, Belgravine Place.”
“MRs. Sawyer hasn't asked you all the season. She gives herself
the airs of an Empress; and when”—
“One’s Member, you know, my dear, one must have,” Rosa replied,
with much dignity; as if the presence of the representative of her
native place would be a protection to her dinner; and a note was
written and transported by the É. early next morning to the mansion
of the Sawyers, in Belgravine Place.
The Topham Sawyers had just come down to breakfast. Mrs. T.

ULTRA.
IT is really too bad that Royal-
ty and Aristocracy should
take out of the hands of
humbler individuals the task
of furnishing testimonials to
puffing advertisers, when it
is clear that a good living
might be made by those who
are in want, if they were
permitted to enjoy the profits
of ſurnishing puffs for the pro-
prietors of registered pale-
ióts and quack medicines.
We perceive that the EM-
PERóR of Russia has been
condescending to, this small
business, and swallowing a lot of Revalenta Arabica for the sake of
testifying to the merits of that article, when many of the Continental
Kings are so badly off that it would be a charity to let them have the
job of puffing the Revalenta, if there is anything to be got by it. ..
We would suggest, by the way, that as Guarantee Societies are
established, it would be an excellent plan to form a Testimonial Asso-
ciation. consisting of a corps
of invalids of every kind and
degree, whose duty it would
be to take the various specifics
in vogue, and write letters
announcing the wonderful
cures that may have been
effected. A capital of twenty
bad legs of fifty years' stand-
ing would suffice to open a
negotiation at once with
Professor Holloway, and
a hundred individuals without -
a bit of voice in the country would set up the concern, with the
means of entering into an arrangement with DR.STOLBERG, in favour of
his celebrated lozenges.
Considering the immense number of foreign sovereigns and noblemen
thrown out of employ by recent events on the continent, it is gratifying
to think that there are means open to them of turning an honest
º by feeding on Revalenta, a sort of gruel—which, as they have
ately got their gruel, they will be accustomed to-or by taking all
sorts of pills to cure all sorts of maladies, and testifying to the virtues
of the several specifics in the newspaper advertisements.

The Gold Law League.
FROM 500 to 600 barristers assembled last week to take into consider-
ation a question of taking ſees. If it had been a question of returning

of taking ſees was allowed, as might have been expected; for, when

Raw materials must be rotten

Then good-bye to British trade!

Must with Tory systems fade.
PARIS IN LONDON.
We do not wonder at Paris having arrived in London and taken up
its quarters at the Colosseum, for poor Paris could certainly not have
felt itself at home in its own country, under circumstances like the
present. The skill of MR. BRADwell has been employed in rendering
Paris perfectly itself in the Itegent’s Park, though it has been utterly
beside itself for the last three months in its own locality. We may
behold in Albany Street the prodigy of a French Restoration, for there
is Paris as it was under Louis-PHILIPPE, and as it never could have
been again, but for the art of the painter and the skill of the machinist.
It is a pleasing sign of the absence of jealousy between the two nations,
that our old friend the London Moon, to whom we have soared in the
ascending room, and written sonnets to while lolling over the balustrade
of the upper gallery—the very identical Moon that has been shining over
the Thames for the last three years—has, in the most obliging manner,
consented to “come out” every evening for a little quiet reflection on
the Seine, and to indulge its liberality by tipping the towers of Notre
Dame and other Parisian pinnacles. We are not surprised that Luna
should be above the ordinary jealousies which less exalted luminaries
are in the habit of displaying, and we can also complimcnt a few of the
higher order of Stars upon their having shown themselves ready to
s: at the Panorama of Paris, after the fatigues of the London
eason.S.
Swearing for Ireland.
THE result of the trials of MEssrs. SMITH O'BRIEN and MEAGHER
suggests a necessary alteration in the form of the oath administered to
jurors in that part of HER MAJESTY's dominions, called Ireland.
Milesian jurymen—at least in cases of sedition—should be required to
swear “that they will not well and truly try and a true deliverance
make between our Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria and the prisoner
at the bar, and will a false verdict give, contrary to the evidence,” &c.
Thus, if they were not always prevented from perjuring themselves, the
ends of justice would sometimes be answered.
A WATCH THAT NEEDS REPAIR.
THE Jury has been called “the Watch of English Liberty.” This
watch seems to be regulated in Ireland principally by an “escapement-
movement,” if we may judge from the winding-up of the late Dublin
trials.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BEGGING AT EPSOM.
It is unanimously agreed this year, amongst all the carriages,
barouches, phaetons, britskas, and respectable carriages, one-horse
broughams included, to prohibit and put down, if possible, the growing
practice of begging, which has been carried on lately to a most alarming
extent, at Epsom. With this view it has been resolved, by the joint
papas and mammas, not to notice any hungry-looking young gentleman
who advances to the carriage to remark, “What a beautiful day it is!”
or any such shabby, empty pretence for being invited to luncheon.
Daughters have been instructed also to turn away their heads suddenly,
and stare in an opposite direction, as soon as they see any juvenile beau
of their acquaintance approach, as it is declared quite impossible for any
parent who does not take down a booth with him to find refreshments for
the numerous young gentlemen who go about the course, seeking what
they may devour. These precautions, it is said, have been found necessary
by those who possess carriages, and take down hampers, in order to guard
against the possibility of a shortness of provisions, or any chance of a
famine; for, last year, so many went down by the rail, and the cheap
coaches, that it was quite a race after the Derby, almost surpassing it
in excitement and intensity of struggle, to get anything to eat or drink,
there having been so many hundred mouths to fill who had not con-
tributed a single wing, or liver, or backbone, or glass of cider, to the
general stock of provisions. -
These resolutions may appear harsh, and selfishly severe, but it must
be borne in mind that these gentlemen strollers flock down in swarms,
with nothing more than a paper of ham sandwiches, trusting entirely to
their friends, or the slightest acquaintance, for their dinner and wine;
and ham sandwiches are known rather to irritate thirst than allay it.
All genteel begging, therefore, is to be suppressed with the utmost
severity of respectability, though we have no doubt that these fashion:
able laws will be broken through long before the aſternoon—as a good
dinner proverbially sharpens good humour, and it will be ſound im-
possible for those who have not paving-stones for hearts, to refuse the
customary alms to a poor fainting fellow, whose hollow cheek evidently
roclaims he has not had a plateful of anything all the day, and whose
usky voice tells too plainly that not a drop of champagne has passed
his dusty lips since the morning.
EXTRAORDINARY TRANCE.
A Most curious case of Trance is at present occurring in the walls of
St. Stephen's. An intelligent lad of the name of Russell has now been
sleeping there for several months, and his sleep is so intense that it is
#. he will remain in the same narcotic state for weeks to come.
What makes his somnolency the more curious is the extraordinay noise
in the midst of which he continues his slumbers. Nothing seems to
disturb him. Every effort has been made to wake him up, and it is
feared, unless he opens his eyes shortly, that he must fall for the want of
e common necessaries of support. In the meantime, every attention
is paid to him, but his soporific state excites the liveliest anxiety
amongst a numerous circle of friends. Everything is kept, too, as still
as possible out of doors. We shall acquaint our readers with the
particulars of this most extraordinary case of Trance every week, until
the poor patient evinces some sign of returning consciousness.
Everything in Common.
THE following question, which has been agitated at Paris, is likely to
create a great split amongst the Fourierists, “Query ºff a Commu.
mist is condemned to death, ought not every fellow-Communist to
share his fate?” The most violent partisans of the share-and-share-
alike system, even those who are Communists à mort, have been rather
staggered with this question. We have heard only of one reply to it,
and it is peculiar, as coming from a most decided BLANC, that is to say,
a gentleman who has nothing to lose. Upon the question being put to
him, he said, with a most tremendous stamp, and curl of his moustache,
“I’ll be hanged if I do!” Who can doubt him?
British Manufactures at the Drawing-Room.
IT is not perhaps generally known that, most of the ladies who
attended the recent drawing-room, carried their patronage of British
Manufactures much further than would at the first glance have
appeared, and we are authorised to state that Wales came in ſor her
share of support in the adoption of the useful but homely sous jupe, de
flanelle des Galles, which was worn by nearly every lady at Court, to
the exclusion even of the exotic crinoline. It is also a gra'ifying fact,
that nearly the whole of the gentlemen's shirts were of British long-
cloth, with the exception of the cuffs and frills, which were mostly of a
transferable nature; and even these were chiefly of the muslin familiarly
known as Book, from its being usually entered in the books of the
tradesmen who deal in it.
THE OLD AND NEW STAFF.
We have looked through all the rooms of the Royal Academy,
(with the exception of the Octagon Room, where we knew it
would be useless looking without a lanthorn, or, at least, a lucifer-
match,) and have been bitterly disappointed at the absence of a portrait
which we had made sure to feast our hungry eyes upon. . We had so
long admired the “Portrait of a Gentleman” that we panted for a change
and expected that at last it would come, for there never was so good
an opportunity, as when the Academy opened after the memorable 10th
of April. We repeat, we were disappointed. The old “Gentleman”
still hooks on to the walls of the Academy, with his curly hair and
Sunday clothes, and we must wait till next year for the payment of the
“Portrait” which was due this season. Then we shall expect to see
them in hundreds, from the peer to the poor merchant with only £20,000
a-year. We are sure Messes. GRANT, Pickersgill, MIDDLETON, and
SIR MARTIN Shee, will not disappoint us in 1849 with innumerable
phases of the aristocracy and gentry in general, taken in their new
pictorial character of
The PortRAIT of A “special.”
WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH HIM2
AFTER the christening of the infant daughter of the DUCHEss of
SUTHERLAND, a few days ago, HER MAJEsty and PRINCE ALBERT were
present at a grand banquet given by the Duke, and the healths of the
royal couple were drunk seriatin, with all the proper honours. In this
we see nothing objectionable; but we do protest against the Duke's
piper having come forward aſter PRINCE ALBERT's health had been
drunk, and striking up the Lament of Macintosh. What on earth had
the wailing of Mister M. to do with HER MAJESTY's consort f or, to

THE BUMBLE LETTERS.
UNCH makes no apology for
rinting the subjoined truly
ritish correspondence, which
must come home to British
businesses and British
bosoms, especially those
whose flame of patriotism has
been kindled at the altar of
Parochial Independence, now
that the sacred principle of
self-government seems in
danger from the centralising
efforts of a set of humbugs
and jobbing place-seekers.
From MR. JEREMIAH BUM-
BLE, (Attorney-at-Law, Poor-
Law, Guardian, Alderman,
Clerk to Paving and Light.
ing Commissions, Member of
%. Toll, and Sewerage
Commissions, and Chairman
of Gas and Water Companies,
&c, &c, &c., for the Borough
of Great Muddlewick,) to
QUINTUs Curtius PURE-
Foy, Esq., M. P. for the
same Borough.
“DEAR SIR,
“A MEETING was held
in the Board-room of the
Union, on Saturday last, and
most respectably attended.
Indeed, there was hardly a
single individual, bearing
either borough or parochial
office, who did not muster on
, the occasion, to defend that
noble principle of self-govern-
ment, which is rooted in the
Saxon, bosom, and for which
our ancestors bled freely in the field, and frequently on the scaffold. We all feel this to be a very critical
moment in history. When old-established empires are going right and left, and the most respectable
commercial firms smashing daily round about us, when Royalty is reduced to F. joints, and exiled
Ministers drive about in hack-cabs, how can we expect that our time-honoured parochial institutions
should escape the shock?
“Even in this favoured borough, where we are blessed with a Corporation (whose Charter dates from
Edward THE Second), a noble Charity School, educating six ..". gratis, and affording an income
of five hundred a year to the Reverend Master, with every department of municipal administration
superintended by its own Board, there are not wanting mischievous and revolutionary spirits. Lampoons,
reflecting upon several leading members of the Town Council, have been openly affixed on the Town
ump. GRIMEs, the shoemaker (who, you may remember, has always voted for the Radicals), has got
portraits of the infamous O'Connor, Jones, and CUFFEY exposed to view in his shop-window, and his
wife has been heard to recommend physical force. The one-legged pensioner in the alms-house has
been tampered with, and fraternises with GRIMEs over the Northern Star, in the Magpie and Stump on
Saturday evenings. But that is not the worst. Open enemies of the Constitution we could meet.
I know we can rely upon the Special Constabulary, in case of any frantic attempt at violence. But
what we have much more to fear from, is the insidious spirit of centralisation. There are not wanting,
even in the parochial camp, traitors who support the odious and abominable Health of Towns Bill?
It is in vain to direct the eyes of these misguided men to our venerable Corporation. They point to the
dirty little children dabbling in the open sewer, which, by the way, is mentioned rather curiously in
the Corporation Records, An. 1514, as–Y" foule ditche, whereoute, this yeare, a marvellouse ill stenche
y-cominge did breede a sore sicknesse whereof died XL soules.” In vain I have pointed out to them, again
and again, the offices to be created by the Bill, and asked them if they did not smell a rat P One of
them, in reply, impudently alluded to the offices which the Bill would abolish, and declared he could
smell nothing but .. gullw-hole under the Board-room window. (It is rather strong.) But the authorities
of Great Muddlewick, I flatter myself, are strong enough to keep down these sanitary gentry—insanitary
I call them—who are anxious to put their own necks and ours under the yoke of a despotic government.
“The Corporation are united to a man. Fortunately most of the Town-Council are in one or other
of our four local Commissions, and several upon all four. As we elect each other, we can easily exclude
these Health of Towns humbugs. . The poor are perfectly contented, and I am certain that the most
vigorous resistance would be made to any attempt at removing the pig-sties and midden-steads in
the Low Row, where the Irish live, who have come here to work at Dizzy's cotton-nill. They give
us a good deal of trouble, and keep the Fever Hospital pretty full. Indeed, we have not been free from
typhºs this summer; but what can be expected from the filthy habits of these wretched creatures P. .
... There has been a great stir making by the centralising party about Baths and Wash-houses. It is
ridiculous to call upon the rate-payers for any such stuff. The people won't wash themselves now
when water is, difficult to come at, and a good scrubbing a kind of luxury. , What will, they do, f
wonder, if we bring, soap and water to º door? As they very sensibly remark, “Dirt keeps
“m warm.” The Master of the House tells me he has the greatest trouble to get the paupers into
the cold bath as it is—especially the old women, in the winter mornings. How, I should like to know,
are persons of this class to be coaxed
into, bathing of their own accord?
Besides, ain’t the rates heavy enough
already, with four hundred in the
House, and two thousand gettin
relief out of it P But experience an
common sense are all thrown away
upon the misguided advocates of the
Sanitary (!) Humbug... I don't reason
with them now, as fdon't find it does
them any good. - -
“Of course we look to you to ex-
press to the House the feelings of
your constituency on that atrocious
measure, the Health of Towns Bill.
In case of a dissolution, no supporter
of such a measure could show his
face on the hustings of Great Mud-
dlewick, with the least prospect of
success. Our Local Boards, you are
aware, include the most influential
gentlemen and men of business of the
town. They are for self-government
to a man; so are all the parish trades-
men, and the various and numerous
respectable contractors employed by
the Paving and Lighting, the Market
and Sewerage Commissioners, and
most of the large Shareholders in
the Gas and Water Compani-s. You
are aware that I command the votes
of at least twenty ten-pounders, who
occupy houses in the two streets I
have built on my Swamp-hollow
property, which have let extremely
Well.
“I have the ºur to remain,

A SHOWER OF NEWSPAPERS.
THE French Revolution has not yet
produced a poet, or a painter, or an
historian, or even a cook, or a dancer.
It has scarcely produced anything,
excepting aloss of 1,000,000 francs, in
carrying out M. Louis BLAnc's
favourite, but rather expensive
scheme about labour. It seems as
if there was a conspiracy against the
Revolution, to prevent its being pro-
ductive in any way. Yet we are libel-
ling it in saying that it has not pro-
duced anything, for our library table
is groaning, as notable in the literary
or fashionable world ever groaned
before, under a weight of newspapers,
which have been laid upon it since the
“political horizon” has been thrown
open to competition by the removal
of the newspaper stamp. The Revo-
lution has produced 117 new journals |
The Trees of Liberty have been most
prolific since they have been planted
for their branches have been covere
with newspaper leaves, if with nothing
else. It is lucky this accumulation
of newspapers has not lately increased,
or else we should have had “Every
Frenchman his own Editor.” Where
the readers, much less the subscribers,
come from is a mystery—only that is
a question that rarely enters the head
of a person about to start a new
paper. France seems to be news-paper-
ridden. Waste paper must be uncom-
monly cheap at Paris!

THE MODEL GENTLEMAN.
He never broke a bank. He has never been known to dress up as a
jockey, or try practical jokes on watermen, or empty flour-bags ºn
chimney-sweeps. He shuns cross-barred trowsers, horticultural scarfs,
overgrown pins, and can wear a waistcoat without a cable's-length of
gold chain round it. His linen is not illustrated, but beautifully clean.
He never does “a little discounting,” nor lend his hand to “flying a
kite.” His aversion for a Gent is softened by pity. He can look at a
lady without the aid of an eye-glass. He allows a performer to talk
louder than himself at the Theatre, and does not spring on the stage if
there is a row at the Opera. He abhors, a lie as he does a sheriff's
officer. He is not prodigal of oaths, and is equally sparing of perfume.
He does not, borrow his English from the stables, and never puts his
lips through a dreary fashionable course of lisping. He is not too proud
to walk, or to carry an umbrella if it rains, and never waltzes with spurs
after supper, even in uniform. He never bets beyond his means, and
is not fond of playing high at cards. He never ruined a young
man—to say nothing worse. He bows scrupulously, even to an
inferior. enever shrinks from an I.O.U., nor is a raid of a bill,
nor seized with a sudden shortness of memory at the sight of an
old friend, whose coat is not so young as it used to be... He has never,
proved his cowardice by fighting a duel, giving satisfaction always in a
more gentlemanly way. He pays for his clothes, disdaining to wear his
tailor's in consideration for valuable introductions. His horses, too, are
his own, and not purchased of his friends by a series of profitable
exchanges. He is not madly attached to billiard-rooms, nor is he seen at
Casinos. He locks up his conquests in his ownheart, and his love-letters
in his desk, rarely disclosing either to his most intimate friends. He does
not bully his servants, nor joke with them, nor cutaman because his father
was in trade. He is not obsequious to a lord, nor does he hang on the
skirts of the Aristocracy, knowing that a man's nobility does not depend
entirely upon his title, however old and unstained it maybe... He travels
to enjoy himself, and does not attempt to crush poor foreigners with
English gold or pride. He values a thing, not by its price, but by its real
value, and does not blush to drink beer if he is thirsty. He does not
think it essential to his reputation to keep late hours, to pull down
sign-boards, bait policemen, and besiege º during the night.
He has no such violent love for door-knockers as to induce him to col-
lect them. He is not facetious with waiters, or given to knock down
a cabman, by way of settling a fare. He is not afraid of laughing iſ he
is amused, even in public, or of handing down an old lady with a turban
to dinner, or dancing with his wife. He likes quiet, but does not hate
children, and thinks a seat in the House of Commons not worth
the bribery and the continual riot. He was never the hero of any
wager, riding, running, racing, rowing, eating, or swimming, and does
not know a single prize-fighter. He is fond of amusements, but does
not instal himself at the Opera every night, because it is fashion-
able. He follows the races; but goes down without a dog-cart and a
key-bugle. He is unobtrusive in his dress, and very retired in his
jewellery, and has an antipathy for a white hat with a black band, and all
violent contradictions either in dress or conversation. He is generous,
but does not give grand dinners and expensive suppers to persons he does
not know or care about. He lends money; and, if he borrows any, he
makes a strange practice of returning it. He rarely “speaks his
mind,” and is very timid in rushing into a quarrel—of husband andwife
especially, . He is a favourite with the ladies, but does not put too
much starch in his politeness, or too much sugar in his compliments.
In matters of scandal he is dumb, if not exactly deaf, and as to
rumours, he only believes half (the kinder half, too), of what he hears.
He is not prejudiced himself, but has a kind toleration for the preju-
dices of others. His golden rule is never to hurt the feelings of anybody,
or to injure a living creature by word or deed. All his actions, all his
sentiments, are shaped to that noble end; and he dies, as he lives,
sans peur et sans reproche. This is the MoDEL GENTLEMAN.
THE TRIBUNE IN TRIBULATION.
We hope the Tribune in the French National Assembly is built of
somewhat stronger materials than the Republic itself; for if not, down
it will come with a tremendous crash, under the weight of orators that
are continually crowding on to it... We should suggest the substitution
of one of our old English Blackwall’busses that carry fifteen inside, and
an unlimited number out, for the crazy and gimcrack concern that
usually does duty for a Tribune in the French Legislative Chamber.
It would of course never break down; for no one ever, yet saw an
omnibus crushed under an avalanche of passengers; and besides, its
peculiar construction would enable twenty orators at least, to be heard
at once, from the various windows and doors, steps, coach-box, and
roof of the vehicle. Its power of running on wheels would also be a
great advantage, for the President might be mounted on the driving-
seat, and could make the circuit of the Assembly to take up and set
down—by the way, many of them want a good setting-down-the
orators desirous of addressing the Assembly. At all events, if the
ordinary Tribune is to be retained, there should be some regulation to:
prevent overloading, and no more than half-a-dozen speakers at a time
should be allowed to crowd on to it.
Quite Correct.
WE perceive that Mr. Edwin Chadwick has been appointed a
Companion of the Bath, a most appropriate honour to one who has
been lately employed in a vigorous effort to give Baths and Wash-houses
to the people. It is perfectly fair that this gentleman, by having the
Order of the Bath conferred upon him, should be enabled tº make what
is termed a “splashy” effect in civilised society.

people of England:-
“MR. PUNCH, “Holly Lodge, Highgate.
- “You will receive with this a sparrow-hawk, with hood, bells,
and jesses. It is the only creature of the hawk kind that, as Hereditary
Grand Falconer of the Empire, I have thought it necessary to maintain.
The bird, however, has, not been * useless, having waged a
successful war upon the snails and slugs of Holly Farm. You will
dispose of it as you will; either sending it to MR. Tyler, or keeping it
for your own office as an excellent mouser, should you (conformably with
Government) retain more cats in your establishment than have hitherto
caught vermin.
“Sir, For several years I retained the post of Grand Falconer, with
hope to sweeten my salary. I was wont to say to myself, under the
reign of WILLIAM the Reformer, “Go to, BEAgcLERC. Thou knowest
the King is old. Thou knowest he careth not for flight of ger-falcon–
for swoop of gentle-tassel. But is there not a blushing bud in bowers
of Kensington P Is there not the roseate WICTORIA P Will not her

“WILLIAM the Reformer died. (I pass the funeral and the general
mourning.) VICTORIA mounted the throne. Immediately, Sir, I visited
the Surrey Zoological Gardens, and laid in a large supply of hawks, of
every sort; employing the first milliners from the Wººd to make
their hoods; and the first bell-hangers to supply their bells. For three
months, I may say it, I lived among my birds, mewing and moulting
with them; and every day a light-footed page looked from the turret-
window for the royal livery, with a letter sealed with the Royal Arms, for
the Hereditary Royal F
d-taxed
alconer.
“For three months, Sir, three hours a day, I sat in my Falconer's
dress, with my favourite birds upon my two fists, awaiting the com-
mands of the QUEEN, my Mistress. It at length struck me that HER
MAJESTY did not feel disposed to hawk: and this truth seemed to
strike the birds at the same time; for some died of melancholy, some of
the pip; and in the end, I was left with the single kestril which comes
with this.

pigeons for her pies, I would have travelled to Windsor, birds and all,
with the delight of a loyal subject. Had she
a swoop at the pullets for the kitchen-to kill the geese for Michaelmas

it—I refuse any longer to take wages for doing nothing.

A FRENCH EDITOR.
BEHOLD him at his daily work. You would fancy he was in an
arsenal. He is merely in his étude. He holds the destinies of Europe
in the nib of his pen, and is obliged to defend himself with a ten-
pounder. He seems in a state of siege, but he is only appealing to the
noble citizens to preserve the public peace and order. He sways the
Provisional Government, and yet dares not É. uill to paper without a
musket ready loaded at his side. His “po #. horizon” is bounded
with pistols, carbines, pikes, and swords. He scribbles with daggers
about him, even if he uses none. They are not there to incense others,
but to defend himself. His writing-desk should be a drum, to enable
him to beat the rappel in case of an invasion. His penholder should be
a bayonet, to guard against any sudden attack. Each article is written
over a powder magazine, and the smallest spark from his plume d'acier
might blow him to Vincennes, or right over the border, far away from
his “belle France.” Doubtlessly his printer's-devil is one of the Garde
Mobile, and carries his copy to the printer's in a cartridge-box: Each
knock at the door must set him trembling all over, and make him
imagine some Frère has called for his head. His first impulse is to load

Doubtlessly he wears a suit of armour under his flannel waistcoat, to

som jumps with sympathy for thee! It is too bad that thy career
of peace should be attended with so much danger—that thy laurels
should be gathered in the mouth of the cannon. Who can tell thy
fears—the boundings of thy heroic bosom P Thou preachest Equality,
erhaps with a wild ouvrier º: thy manly beard; thou praisest

A BEAR-GARDEN.
IT is not generally known that there is at Shoreditch, near the
Eastern Counties Railway Station, a regular Bear-garden, for the
nourishment of bears, and from this establishment “families are sup-
lied with unadulterated grease direct from the bear,” every morning.
§. is the consumption of this rarity, that a man goes round with
bears'-grease as regularly as the milk; and the cry of "Grease below!”
is familiar in the vicinity. Sometimes a real bear is danced into a per:
spiration at the door of the customer's house, and the grease supplied
in its pure state from the hide of the animal. -
We are told that free-trade does not interfere much with the home-
grown grease, for there is none imported now from Ursa Major, though
a few small pots, said to be from Ursa Minor, are occasionally thrown
upon the market. The bears of the Shoreditch breed, are remarkably
fine; and, indeed, the old Bishopsgate Street. Bruin is considered to
afford the rarest specimen of Ursine life to be met with in the whole
range of Zoology.

FANTASTIC EXHIBITIONS.
THE evenings at the House of Commons lately have been every bit as fantastic as
those of RoHERT HoudLN's. There have been tricks, wonderful passes, and sleights-
of-hand which have struck every one with amazement, making us wonder however
they could be done so perfectly as to deceive us with our eyes open. The tricks
have been very clever, particularly that of the “Washerwoman's Cauldron,” in which
numberless Corporations were taken, tied into a bundle, thrown into the cauldron,
and brought out again perfectly clean, though the artful way in which the City of
London was left out elicited one tremendous “Oh!” and many could not make
out the evident sleight with which it was done, nor have forgotten it to the present
day. It is in these sleights particularly that the exhibitions excel. But the most
astonishing part is the Wonderful Boy, who supports himself on a slender stick, so
thin that you fancy it must break under him, and remains in an elevated position in
the easiest manner, just as if he were going to sleep. You are afraid that every
minute he must fall; but no: there he remains, caring apparently for nothing about
him, with his eyes
ut, and all his limbs and senses evidently paralysed. It is the
most wonderful act of suspension we have ever witnessed. All the support he has
for keeping him up is the little stick above mentioned, which is called “Whig
Government;” and how he manages to hold on to it so long is a bit of conjuring so
marvellous that we can scarcely credit our senses, though the thing is taking
before us.
ace
The name of this wonderful little boy is “John NY RussBLL,” # We
advise allour readers not to fail on any account to witness his incredible tricks, for his
evenings of performance are drawing to a rapid close. There never will, or can be,
anything like it again.
PRINCE HAL AND PRINCE AL.—A PARALLEL.
THERE are some comparisons which are not odious, and of these we hope we shall
afford aspecimen, in pointing out a resemblance between two Princes, one of whom
adorned our Royal Family above four hundred years ago, and the other embellishes
it now; although neither of them, it was once apprehended, would turn out to be
either ornamental or useful. We allude to PRINCE HENRY OF WALEs, afterwards
HENRY THE FIFTH, who has been handed down to us under the title of PRINCE
HAL, and to another Prince, whom, under that of PRINCE AL, we hereby transmit
to posterity.
PRINCE HAL commenced his career by devoting himself to that branch of hus-
bandry which is commonly called the sowing of wild oats—to reap, it was expected,
the usual harvest of seediness. He lay about in pot-houses; he associated with
thieves and vagabonds; he frequented all places of disreputable resort; and he
assaulted the LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE on the Bench; for which outrage he was com-
mitted to one of his own father's gaols. He was, in fact, the mediaeval Man about
Town, the Brick, the Beau; in short, the Fast Man of his º; But when HAL
t
succeeded to the Crown and Sceptre he abandoned the Blue Posts—at least the
Boar's Head in Eastcheap. He not only relinquished his fast and foolish courses,
but having ceased to be a great scamp, he became a great sovereign.
Now PRINCE AL, to be sure, never haunted gin-shops. He did not consort with
the swell mob, nor swagger about the streets and beat the police. Neither used he
to go to Coal Holes, Cider Cellars, and Casinos, nor to steal knockers, or wrench off
bell-handles at midnight. Nor will it be recorded of him
that he punched the head of LoRD DENMAN, or got sent
to the House of Correction. But AL did indulge in another
kind of dissipation—the waste of time. He gave his mind
up to his dogs and gun. . He rose up to breakfast and
shoot—and he came home to lunch. is life, *:::.
|had no better aim than the bearing of his fowling-piece
and rifle. He could bring down a stag, indeed, at a long
range, and knock over partridges and pheasants right
and left. But he was only great in a battue... It became
the general impression that he was fit for nothing but a
gamekeeper: nor was this removed when his Royal High-
ness betook himself to the more useful occupation of a
hatter. Thus, though AI, unlike HAL, was certainly an in-
offensive young man, yet the world, as in the case of HAL,
as certainly expected no good of him.
HAL was wanted at last; and when he was, wanted he
was found. So was AL. A neighbouring, dynasty was
suddenly overthrown. A movement directed against mo-
narchical institutions ensued throughout Europe. At the
bottom of it was a wide-spread feeling of discontent among
the labouring population. Just at this juncture, out comes
PRINCE AI, takes the chair at a meeting of an Associa:
tion for the Improvement of the Working Classes, and
makes a speech so, judicious and apposite, as to convince
everybody that he had quite mistaken his forte if ever,he
supposed it to consist in making, hats. ...PRINCE AL, like-
wise, assumes the patronage, and contributes handsomely
to the funds of an Institution for supplying the people
with Baths and Wash-houses. The whole British public
cheers him, and cries “Bravo!” and asks, “Who would
have thought it?” It is said that PRINCE AL has an ar-
tistic eye. No doubt he has. He knows, the value, of
contrast. He saw—as PRINCE HAL before him did—that
his reformation would show
“Like bright metal on a sullen ground.”
It is not for nothing that AL has dined off royal plate. He
|is up to the effect of polished upon frosted gold. In shoot-
|ing, and hat-making, he has been merely preparing a back-
| ground on which to put in his high lights. The result is
| a very remarkable brilliance; and, in the opinion of this
once facetious, then malevolent, now laudatory, and al-
ways impartial journal, the portraits of PRINCE AL, and
|Pºcº"#. may be regarded as companions. , Looking
attentively first at this picture, and then at that, we pro-
nounce them to be decidedly similar.
STAUNCH SUPPORTERS.
ONE of our fashionable contemporaries—for we have two
or three journals which deserve the epithet—gives a beau-
tiful account, which almost rises to the height of history
in its elevated tone, of a party at the DUCHEss of SUTHER-
LAND's. There is, however, one little touch of the familiar,
which is rather derogatory to the dignity of the drawing-
room GIBBON, or the West-End HALLAM, or the HUME of
the haute-monde, by either of which titles, our contempo-
rary may fairly describe himself. In speaking of a portion
of the entertainment, he says:–
“The Duchess or SUTHERLAND was supported right and left by the
PRINCE of PRussia and PRINCE WILLIAM of PRussia.”
This expression is forcible, but by no means elegant.
The idea of the Duchess being supported “right and
left” shows the enthusiasm of her guests, just as the inti-
mation that the banquet had been “pegged into, hammer
and tongs,” would be a forcible, though not a very polished,
mode of indicating that the répast had been sat down to
with a lively relish, and a vigorous appetite.

CoolNEss, it is said, is a quality essential to the lawyer.
This necessary ingredient of the legal character is displayed
in a most extraordinary degree by the Officers of the Court
of Chancery, who, with enormous arrears of business on
their hands, and in spite of the loudest outcries and the
greatest sufferings occasioned by their not despatching it,
quietly take a holiday from the 25th of March to the 26th
of May. There exists a Law Assurance Society; but we
know of no assurance in connexion with the Law to match
that of the Court of Chancery.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PUNCHPS
POLITICAL ECONOMY.
PUNCH was, a few nights ago, at the
Opera; and endured all the horrors of the
middle passage. He was violently squeezed
between the EARL of ELLENBorough and
the DUKE OF RICHMOND. Nevertheless,
with a philosophy—the fame of which, like
the fame of #m. Lucifers, is now be-
come European—he endured the pressure
with a dim religious feeling that good must
come of it. Punch, relieved from that pro-
digious squeeze, immediately made the best
of his fainting way to MR. RICHARD Doy LE,
who drew upon him for his likeness at sight.
The portrait has already interested the eyes
and hearts of millions. All this, however, by
the way of preface. Let us now proceed
to the important results of that historic
squeeze.
Punch, so long jammed between the two
peers, caught their Political Economy. He
almost immediately felt it; but next morn-
ing it came out upon him full as measles.
(It is well known, by the way, that the EARL of ELLENBoRough—
with a graceful forgetfulness of his own sinecures to the heroic tune of
£9000 per annum-is anxious to act the part of a LoRD Joseph HUME
in the Peers. He is, for the time, the noble Saveal of the nation.
The DUKE of RICHMOND has, within the past week, betrayed symp-
toms of a like economy. Indeed, such a passion for parsimony has
seized so many of our noblemen, that in several instances blue º
are, it is said, about to give way to blue tape, and real ermine to yield
the place to red rabbit.)
The effect upon Punch has been startling and immediate. He walked
home from the Opera, when it has ever been his inexorable custom to
take a Hansom. He .. without a rushlight; and, rising early in the
morning, he emphatically countermanded his matutinal red herring.
Then, knowing what certain Duchesses have done for their country in the
way of encouragement of home manufactures, Punch refused his ordinary
coffee, and sent out for roast home-grown corn. He moreover desired
his landlady to take every bit of Spanish mahogany out of his apart-
ment, and to bring him table and chairs of good stout English oak.
Then, having breakfasted upon a penny buttered roll—first assured that
the wheat was grown in Kent, and the butter churned in Devonshire,
being none of your Tamboff and Dutch stuff–Punch was about to shave.
...; however, that his looking-glass was lined with quicksilver
exported from the mines of Styria, he dashed the mirror into atoms with
a passion worthy of Richard the Second, and re-acted the good old DAY
AND MARTIN legend, by shaving himself in the lustre of his own boot.
Great, however, was his consternation upon finding the boot was not of
English hide, but of Spanish cordovan. Punch would have liked to
i. himself, but that was º:
Punch still proceeded to make his toilet. His soap—need he say it—
was Windsor—supplied by the same manufacturer who supplied MR.
T. B. MACAULAY, with his cake in the Devil's Tower, when he washed
his hands of that memorable visit to the Castle. Punch was then about
to brush his hair, when his eye fell upon the brush's ivory back.
Knowing that elephants were not of English manufacture, Punch
immediately sent out for a brush of British make, sitting patiently with
dishevelled locks, until the implement was brought.
This done, there was another delay. Punch's combs were of the
deepest and most delicate tortoise-shell. Now, assured that every
Duchess had repudiated tortoise-shell as encouraging the foreign animal
to the loss of our own domestic oxen, Punch had to sustain another
wait, until he might pass through his locks the horn of his own country.
After this, Punch proceeded very well with his making . until he
came to his cravat—this was of foreign silk (for those mulberry-trees
that are to grow in Spitalfields are not yet planted). Here was
another delay, until the landlady departed for, and returned with an
nglish cambric check.
There was another stop at the coat. It carried a collar of Genoa
velvet. Whereupon MR. RAPRAscAL of Regent Street was imme-
diately summoned with a choice of tots made of the hair of
CADwallad ER's goats, of ancient British manufacture.
All was now tolerably right, until a new difficulty arose with the hat.
Inside was written—'Superfine Beaver.” Now, Punch knowing that
beavers did not burrow in the banks of the Thames, or of any English
river soever, repudiated the foreign castor, and the weather being
sunny and soft, he straightway sent for a hat made of Dunstable straw,
#. in British fields, reaped by British swains, and stitched by
ritish females.
Punch took his stick; but remarking, for the first time, that it was a
piece of Oriental dragon's-blood, he snapped it across his knee, resolving
to purchase a bit of real English ash.
Punch, then, lighting a cigar—a British Hounsditch—sallied forth to
take his walk, delighted in the belief that he carried nothing about him
but what was of British manufacture.
“If the dear Duchesses,” thought Punch, vain-gloriously—“the dear
roseate wise ones who signed the British manufacture manifesto, could
only see me now"—
At this moment a ragged starveling woman with a baby in her arms
approached him. Punch (knowing, as a political and social economist,
that it was very wrong) took out his purse. It contained ten yellow
sovereigns. Punch was smitten to the soul. “Gold,” said he remorse-
fully, “is an article of foreign manufacture, and materially injures our
own Cornish copper. Take it,” cried Punch, placing the mischievous
exotic in the woman's hands, equally relieved himself that he had thus
got rid of every article that was not of British manufacture.
Yet one word. Punch returned home rather late. He could not
sleep. The bed seemed to draw him like a blister. He jumped up;
ripped open the tick—it was filled with foreign feathers.
Late as it was, he ordered up a truss of English straw, and slept the
double sleep of the patriotic and the innocent.
MAKING THE MOST OF THEM.
MR. HENRY RUsseII, who is the Composer, according to his own ac-
count, of the original idea from which every piece of modern music has
been pilfered, as well as of all the Ships on Fire, Maniacs, and Gamblers'
Wives that were ever known, has recently been adopting the capital
idea of making the most of his audience, by -
in the choruses at his entertainments.
calling upon them to join
This is all very well as far as it
goes; but if it should be carried a little further, and they should take

Russell
to amuse themselves, would get on very well without him, and might
keep their money in their pockets.
We advise MR. HENRY Russell to think of this before he carries
too far the principle of calling upon the public to entertain each other
for the small consideration of a certain number of shillings. We
recommend him to keep himself rather more independent of , his
audience, and his audience more dependent upon him for the effect of
his compositions. We shall have him next requesting the babies
present to squeal, by way of heightening the horrors of the song of the
‘Gambler's Wife,” or the “Ship on Fire,” or any other of the fifty
songs in which a child in arms and its mamma, interchanging squeaks
and sobs, are the principal characters. By this arrangement, MR.
Russell would be sure of a general chorus at all events; for it is a rule
of juvenile economy, that directly one infant begins to cry, every other
infant present affords its voluntary contribution to the harmony.
“SHOULD OLD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOTP"
WHEN a seat is wanted for any Member of the Government, some
obliging nobody is requested to go out to make way for him. e find
no fault with this plan, for the exchange is frequently a good one. A
clever man is in most instances gained by it. But why should these
tactics be restricted to the Government? Why should not the Opposi-
tion resort to the same means of gaining a cleverally? . Its strength is
not so invincible at the present crisis, that it should despise an expedient
that would strengthen its ranks. Men of talent are not so plentiful in
the country, that one should be spared. We beg, therefore, of some
illustrious unknown in the House—and their number is legion—to come
forward, and do a graceful act in giving up his seat to MR. Roebuck.
He will do more good by that one move than if he sat on the Parlia-
mentary benches till FEARGUs O'Connor was Prime Minister.
A man of MR. Roebuck's courage and sterling common sense,
would be invaluable in Parliament at the present time of lukewarmness
and heavy dulness. We have often had occasion to find fault with
MR. Roebuck; we have often been at variance with him; we have
often ridiculed him as kindly as our satirical disposition would allow
us; but we would willingly retract every word we have said; joyfully
sacrifice every joke we have made, however brilliant, to see our old
enemy and respected friend in the House of Commons again. ill no
one retire to make room for him Come, gentlemen, who are supposed
to represent the wisdom of the country, who amongst you will admit a

upon MR. Roebuck being once more in the House of Commons.

FREE AND EASY FELONY.
ONE of the most agreeable signs of the times is the gentleness and
forbearance—we may say the complaisance—with which the criminal
law is beginning to be administered. We read in the Times that on the
occasion of MR. MitchEL's trial—
“Severalladies occupied seats throughout the Court. MR. T. F. MEAGHER and a great
many others of the more prominent members of the “Young Ireland' party also at-
tended, and were accommodated with seats near the prisoner, for whom a chair was
placed in front of the dock.” - -
We thus see a criminal prosecution assuming the character of a per-
fectly civil proceeding. e expect to see burglars at the Old Bailey
allowed a seat in front of the §. and their associates, or, as the
are vulgarly termed, “pals,” provided also with chairs near their friend.
Perhaps minor offenders will be accommodated with a sofa, and the
Judge, instead of talking of the prisoner at the bar, will allude to the
defendant on the ottoman.
Should the accused be disposed to leave his case in the hands of his
counsel, he might also be supplied with a number of the Times, or a
cigar and a glass of brandy-and-water, to amuse himself with pending
its investigation. At least, a person arraigned merely for **ś
larceny ought to be treated with as much consideration as
MITCHEL, if what is sauce for goose is to be sauce for gander.
A SEVENTH POINT FOR THE CHARTER.
We have to propose a measure of economy that will, we think, effect
an enormous saving to the Exchequer. It is well known that scores of
Members of Parliament believe that their only º is to be continually
moving for Committees and Returns. The Blue Books and other waste
paper of which these senators are the prolific parents, it is grievous for
everybody—trunkmakers and buttermen excepted—to contemplate.
We have to propose a remedy—in fact, a Seventh Point to the Charter.
It is this:—“PAPER-Money for MEMBERs of PARLIAMENT.”
We propose that every Member of the House of Commons be allowed
£100 a year to find his own printing. If he do not move for what turns
into his own pocket. If his motions for printing exceed the sum, such
excess the Member shall pay himself. We think that we have thus hit
upon a mode that will save both public time and public money.

HOMAGE TO METTERNICH.
“AN Oxford Graduate” writes to the Morning Post, ºf...; that
the Oxford Hebdomadal Board should, at the ensuing grand commemo-
ration, confer an honorary degree on PRINCE METTERNIGH. To dub
this double-deep ex-Minister and diplomatist Master of Arts, would be
gilding refined gold and painting the lily-sending Natives to Čolchester,
or consigning to Newcastle Wall's-End; inasmuch as there are no arts
of which he is not a consummate master already. It is impossible that
any academic distinction could add to the peculiar reputation of MET:
TERNICH; but perhaps the University might create him Professor of
Intrigue, or Doctor of Dissimulation, or appoint him to be its Machia-
vellian Lecturer, just to manifest its appreciation of his deep attainments.
O R.A.C.L.E.S.
Lord John Russell—" The middle Mr. Hume–"The middle classes
classes do not want Reform. They do want Reform, and will have it.
do not care about it. I am positive I am positive of this—that the
they do not. The Hon. Member Hon. Member at the head of the
for Montrose has been misinformed Government knows nothing what-
about the feelings of the middle ever of the middle classes, or what
classes.” they want.”
Mr. Feargus O'Connor—“The Mr. Cobden. — “The workin
working classes (and no one knows | classes are eager for Reform, and
them better than myself) are to a am convinced they will not be
man against Reform. They would quiet till they have it. No one
not have it, even if it was offered knows less, and is more mistrusted
to them.” by the working classes, than the
| Hon. Member for Nottingham.”
Now, only one of these oracles can be right. Perhaps the middle
classes and the working-classes will decide for themselves? They have
till the 20th of June, when MR. HuME's motion for Reform comes on.
We hope the opportunity will not be lost.
A JUVENILE ATTEMPT.
ThE practice of infant joking has lately prevailed to an alarming
extent, and there is scarcely a boy of the present age—which includes,
of course, his own—that is not found getting into puns before he is
fairly out of pinafores. There is, in fact, a sort of epidemic going
about in families, whose younger branches are in a state of eruption
deserving the name of rash, which developes itself in a breaking-out of
a serious, because intended to be of a comic, character. We understand
in their system. Some of the original matter from Joe Miller is recom:
mended as the best for the purpose of vaccination, and the prevention of
more dangerous sorts of humour from becoming manifest. As an
instance of the sad state to which our juvenile population is reduced, we
may state the fact, that an otherwise exceedingly intelligent boy was
actually heard to recommend one of his schoolfellows to take a Bath bun
after having taken a bath in the Serpentine. Surely this is a case for the
interference of every well-wisher to }. species.
THE HAZARD OF THE DIE.
THERE is a very good fragedy, now being played, at the Olympic,
under the title of The Lords of Ellingham; but the author seems to have
considered that his
tragedy would be
unworthy of the
name, unless the
characters in his
bills were nearly all
brought within the
bills of mortality.
If the Olympic
Theatre furnishes
any returns on the
subject, we are
sure the Registrar-
General's next Re-
port will show an
alarming increase
of deaths for the
last quarter in
Wych Street, and
we may expect
that, in the next
new play at this
theatre, some extra
accommodation
will be required for
the defunct at the
fall of the curtain,
or there will be a
series of legs, vary-
ing in length from
two feet to three
feet, stretching a-
cross the stage in
the direction of the -
orchestra. We recommend the clever author to curb that propensity
to dramatic homicide, in which he has hitherto indulged.
DESCENT OF THE CURTAIN ON THE OLYMPIC TRAGEDY.
Heartless Calumny.
It has been lately whispered abroad, and muttered at home, that the
Ethiopian Serenaders—(rest, their bones!)-were a party of attorneys
disguised as serenaders. We are certainly sorry to think that such a
libel should have got into circulation; for, to describe them as attorneys,
is surely to make them much blacker than they were painted. If it is
true that they turned their legal parchment into tambourines, and cast
aside the brief for the banjo-if they bathed themselves in the ink
which would otherwise have flowed in unison with the money from the
ockets of their clients—we can only say that the Ethiopian ex-attorneys
ave shown wonderful versatility in turning from acourse of life employed
in ...; litigation, to a course of existence whose object is the
promotion of harmony.
The New Protectionists.
THE ladies have been recently getting up a new Protectionist party,
whose grand principle is to wear no article except of British manufac-
ture. The managers of the different and indifferent theatres have also
been requested to protect British interests by bringing out no production
or dealing in no piecework of foreign manufacture; but the fear is, that
the trade must stop altogether, if an end is put to dealing in the
French markets. #. several houses a determination has been formed
to drink nothing but British wine, and the gooseberry districts have
accordingly become a source of considerable profit to the proprietors,
while the old ancestral elder groves, whose antiquity is emblemed in
that it is in contemplation to get up a sort of facetious vaccine insti-
their name, have become the resort of the wine-merchant.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EXCUSES FOR NOT GOING TO THE DERBY.
WE, are astonished at the
number of reasons that kept
N people away from the Der-
by. We are convinced some
persons are clever at in-
ventingexcuses, and nothing
!) else. Their power of inven-
tion stops at that ingenious
º point. Every person that
^\}) was not at the Derby had
a different excuse. Instead
of boldly confessing that
he did not choose to go,
or could not afford to go,
he much preferred giving
some out-of-the-way excuse,
to hide the terrible truth.
We are so afraid of , ap-
pearing mean or vulgar,
that we prefer telling a
fashionableſalsehood, rather
... than be suspected of either.
Alas! when shall we improve? It is time we should, for, if we recol-
lect right, we are in A.D. 1848.
The following are a few, picked out of the innumerable excuses we
heard the day after the Derby, from persons who were not there:–
Jones had made arrangements to go, but his kitchen chimney caught
fire just as his party came in a carriage-and-four to fetch him.
RoBINson was summoned on a Jury; he was excessively annoyed;
he would sooner have given twenty pounds than have stopt away. .His
wife, whom we met shortly afterwards, told us she had been so disap-
pointed, but MR. RoBINsóN had had a touch of his old complaint only
that morning, and the doctor had forbidden him to, leave, the house.
He suffered such tortures from the gout, she didn’t like to leave him.
LADY TANNER had tried to get horses everywhere, and WELLINGTON
TANNER had missed the last train by two minutes. He had overslept
himself. It was just like his luck!
Bounce (of the Artillery) laid all the fault on his boots; they were so
tight he could hardly walk, his corns pained him so. #e was quite a
. r in warm weather; yet he was walking well enough when we
met, Illm.
SIMPson expected an important cause to come on, in which he held
a brief. It was just as well he did not go, for he was a most unfortu-
nate fellow in ºf. -
SMITH's father had come to town from Manchester that very morning,
and he did’nt like to leave the old gentleman, for he wanted him—in
secret—to pay his bills. . His heart, however, was at Epsom all the
while, which we thought was a very good compliment to his father.
BARKER had a bill, to take up, and was “very short.” This was a
favourite, excuse with a large majority, which proves that money must
be very “tight” just at present. -
CLARKE was going to his aunt's the next day; but what this had to
do with the Derby we did not like to inquire.
CHIPPENDALE promised his “governor” never to go to another
race—he had been bitten so º at the last Derby. -
SPOONER's wife was taken with hysterics at breakfast, and she did
not recover till it was too late:
METCALFE cut himself shaving, and could not stop the bleeding; and
poor SEYMOUR lost the key of his wardrobe, and he couldn't get a
shirt or a single thing to dress with. It was very provoking, wasn’t it P
These are º of the endless excuses we heard for persons not
going to the Derby. We pitied a poor pet parson the most ; he had to
attend the Meeting at Exeter Hall, for the Conversion of the Hindoos,
We shall never forget his saying, “Sir, I must have risen to speak at
the very moment the start took place, and can assure you all my
thoughts at that moment were upon Surplice.” Of all the excuses we
hear we do not believe in one, with the exception of that poor pet
parSOn S.
TN
National Humiliation.
We have heard a great deal lately about the proud position of Old
England, amid the wrecks and revolutions of surrounding nations, but
alas! the Derby Day has accomplished what Chartism, Republicanism,
and all the other isms and sch-isms put together, could never achieve.
It was generally remarked, that in going to, and returning from the
Races, the whoſe British people seemed to be collected together, and
that, without an exception, they were all obliged to bite the dust.
Many a patriot who has long had Old England upon his lips, was found
with his native land literally in his mouth, to an extent that must have
been rather disagreeable.
LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.
CoNSIDERABLE, sensation has been created in the literary world by
the removal of the intelligent railway librarian from the station at
London Bridge to that at Shoreditch. It is well known that this enter-
prising collector had established a library, second only to the Alexandrian
in extent; and, by a sort of sacrilege, second only in enormity to that
by which the Álexandrian Library was destroyed, have the Directors of
the Brighton and Dover lines driven away the rare museum of literature
which had hitherto adorned their station, gratified their travellers, and
enlightened their neighbourhood. We hear that lucre has been at the
bottom of this ill-advised step, and a few paltry pounds...in the way of
rent have been sufficient inducement to them to exile Civilisation
from their platform, Philosophy from their rails, and the dreams of
Poesy from their sleepers. The Spirit of Literature has, however, found
its way to Shoreditch, and there, under the fostering wing of the Prince
of Railway Librarians, we hope to see it flourishing.
THE BRITISH TREE OF LIBERTY.
LIBER LIBERTATIS BRIT ANNICUS.
GENUS.–Specialis Constabularius.-LINNAEUs.
Flowers about the 10th qf April.
THE British Tree of Liberty flourishes, only in a generous soil. . Its
branches are of a very hard wood, resembling, in the closeness of its
fibre, ash and sometimes oak, and they are not unlike in shape the con-
stable's staff. Its roots are as thick as a man's arm, and its trunk is so
large that it takes a very strong person indeed to grasp it, especially when
its branches are in full swing. The strength of this tree has been tested
very much lately; for, about two months ago, a number of idle hands
were engaged in trying to pull it down; but it maintained its position,
without shrinking or yielding an inch... It grows in towns, but can be
cultivated anywhere—even in ..i. climates, if there is good ground
for it, and the land is not impoverished too much by constant draining.
The native place of the Tree of Liberty is London; but it has spread so
fast everywhere, that it will take nothing but a national convulsion, to
which our country is but little given, to uproot it again. It affords the
*. protection to those who put themselves under its branches during
a SLOrin,
The Jewish Race.
Surplice beat Shylock on the Derby Day. -
Shylock was again beaten by Surplice the following day in the House
of Lords, on the Jewish Disabilities Bill.
This is too bad, two days running! However, the race is not yet
over. Shylock must make every effort next year, and 1000 to 1 he will
beat Surplice by several heads.
Betting in the City and House of Commons all in favour of Shylock.

TRANSPLANTING FRENCH THEATRES.
THE French theatres are running to ruin as fast as public excitement can take
them. Managers are advertised for in every direction, but they cannot be had;
which proves that the French are not quite so mad at the present moment as they
are represented to be. The few managers that are left are packing up their houses,
and preparing to give London the benefit of their companies. A Frenchman who
wishes to see a French piece, will have to come to London to witness it. He will
have a double advantage: he will be able to see it either in French or English–
that is to say, if there is an English theatre still left open. . In a few weeks, we
expect, an English actor will be able to advertise himself at a shilling a-head. People
will flock to see him then, as a curiosity. Who knows, the Court might visit him?
Depend upon it, if the threatened invasion of French actors takes place, the English
Drama will be on the following national footing:-
Drury Lane will be occupied by the Théâtre Français; RACHEL will perform three
nights a-week, and sing “God save the Queen” between the acts, with the Union
Flag, instead of the Marseillaise with the tricolore; MoLIERE, Marivaux, BEAU-
MARCHAIs, Musset, and SCRIBE, on the other three nights. No free representations.
The Académie will bring over its Juive, Favorite, Huguenots, and Comte Ory,
with all its Péris, Tentations, and collection of ballets and “rats,” to Covent Garden.
The Vaudeville will sing its couplets at the Lyceum, and the Gymnase will perform
its Mistress Siddons, Clarisse Harlowe, and Le Marchand de Jouets, (the Cricket
on the Hearth, with the “Cricket” left out, and no." Hearth”) at the Adelphi,
where we shall have an opportunity of º English manners and customs, as
translated by the French. The Haymarket will surrender its stage to the Variétés;
MADAME Floß E will supplant MRs. GlovER; FARREN will be succeeded by
HoFFMAN; MRs. Nisbett by the impudent Dejazet. Pièces de Pantalons
will be triumphant. - - - -
The Porte St. Martin will commence its reign of murder, and every possible
crime, at Sadler's Wells; Othello will be discarded for Le Docteur Noir, King
º º Le Roi Samuse, and the Midsummer Night's Dream be shelved for La Tour
este.
The Gaîté will go through its Sept Passions with La Gràce de Dieu on the Surrey
stage, and Les Folies Dramatiques will drive away, in a shower of blue fire, the
“Heroine of Domestic Drama” from her favourite servant's hall, the Victoria.
The Palais Royal will give the preference of its calembourgsau grossel (sometimes
of the very grossest) to the St. James's Theatre; that is to say, supposing it cannot
get the Walhalla (fit abode for it) or some place near Leicester Square, where the
colony of foreigners can gain easy access to it, and have it all to themselves.
MADAME SAQUI (her shade at least) will exhibit at the Marylebone, and Les
Funambules, and Les Délassemens Comiques lodge themselves at the Pavilion and
City. Theatres. The Château Rouge may have its quadrilles (revised and corrected)
at Vauxhall, and the Chaumière throw open its doors to all the étudiants of
By this arrangement every theatre, every place of public
amusement of Paris, will be comfortably installed in some corresponding building
in London, and the poor managers and actors will be able to shelter themselves
snugly from the ruin which is hanging over them in their own capital. -
But what is to become of the English managers and actors? #. this a subject
of such little importance now-a-days, that we do not think we need devote a line of
conjecture to it. The only person who will have reason to complain, will be the
Lord Chamberlain, for he will have to read some twenty new French pieces every
night, to see if he can license them. And the pieces will rather require it, for the
majority, we know, have been written without any license at all. We advise the
Lord Chamberlain to buy a cheap copy of La France Dramatique, and to begin
reading it at once; though, after all, Cumberland's Theatre, perhaps, will do just as
well. He had better be guided by the following rule:–“License all the pieces
that have already been translated, and cancel all those that have not;” for he may
depend upon it they must be bad, indeed, if they have escaped translation.

UNREPORTED ILLUMINATIONS.
THE Illuminations on the QUEEN’s Birthday were very
elegant—those of the Theatres particularly.
The Haymarket and Lyceum had the QUEEN’s box
beautifully illuminated. The following motto was hung in
a festoon of green-coloured lamps overtheranels—“Though
lost to sight, to memory dear.” The lamps, however, of #.
word “sight,” went out very early; but the “memory”
burnt vividly to the very last.
The Princesses’ was closed in honour of the occasion;
but the horological big drum over the portico was lighted
as usual.
The French Plays had a splendid medallion of the QUEEN
crowning Messrs. ScrubE AND CLAIRVILLE with laurel.
Underneath was a transparent scroll, with the following
words in gold:—“A la Reine d’Angleterre les Comédiens
Français reconnaissants.”
Drury Lane had a statue of AURIol, on the shoulders of
SHARspeARE. In the background was a transparency of
FRANcox1 riding on the backs of six English dramatists.
The whole liberally strewed with sawdust. -
The Olympic had the illuminated organon wheels outside,
playing “God save the QUEEN,” every five minutes.
The other Theatres proved their gratitude by burnin
their usual gaslights, even if their doors were not opened.
In fact, every place of amusement made light of the royal
patronage. It was transparent everywhere.

Music is a safe adjunct to anything. We have known a bad
meeting pass off quite lively with the aid of a good band; and many a
dreary evening party has been indebted to JULLIEN and his music
for drawing to a close. The Irish Patriots know the influence of music.
They speak with clashing cymbals, which strive to make as much noise
as they can, in order not to be mistaken, seemingly, for the symbols of
peace, and they º: manage to gain the ears of the mob through the
medium of a drum, the best accompaniment for eloquence as noisy and
hollow as theirs. Music, too, helps to make a jubilee of a defeat., .
In this way MITCHEL was accompanied to trial. He marched into
Court as if he were going to a triumph., He was no vulgar...prisoner,
but, lifted on the music, he rose into a hero. He walked like a con-
ueror, distributing coups de chapeaur with the affability of a i".

rabble cheer as they would at a street º: playing a voluntary on the
Pandean-pipes. However, the patron of pikes, the apostle of hatred
against the Saxon, is convicted. We are afraid his music is for ever ||
stopped. He should have reserved his triumph till after his acquittal.
The overture was bad, but the finale is worse. Let us hope the threatened
crusade of bloodshed is now over in Ireland, never to be renewed.
THE BUMBLE LETTERS.
From Q. C. PUREFoy, Esq. (M.P. for the Borough of Great Muddlewick,
President of the True Blue Association for promoting the Rights of
Britons, President of the Muddlewick Mechanics' Institute, Chair-
man of Quarter Sessions, &c., &c., &c.), to JEREMIAH BUMBLE,
Esq., &c., &c., &c.
“DEAR SIR, . . . “House of Commons, 12 o'clock, P.M.
“I HAVE to acknowledge the receipt of your closely-reasoned
and most enlightened letter. It comes at the right time. I shall take
care, that the sentiments of Great Muddlewick, and, especially of its
admirable municipal authorities, are made known in the House. It is
such opinions which really tell on Ministers. It is a painful truth that
... are being struckjust now at the glorious principle of Self-
government, out of doors. There is a dangerous disposition abroad to
run down vested rights, and to interfere with that most sacred of all
sanctities, the sanctity of property. We hear a great fuss made about
duties. But what i say to you, my dear Sir, and to all in stations of
influence, is, ‘Take care of the rights, and the duties will take care of
themselves!’. What is a duty, but something done freely and without
compulsion? How can this character belong to acts which are to be
enforced by law, and made compulsory under penalties?
“The Englishman's house, Sir, I hold with you, is his castle. This
is the great principle of the Constitution. If an Englishman choose to
live in a dirty castle, it is no business of any other Englishman. The
Briton may go about with a dirty face, when the subject of a despotic
É. is dragooned into a slavish cleanliness. Freedom, is our
#: and tyranny is not the less tyranny that it comes in the garb
of a Health. Inspector, and coerces the public into washilg-tubs and
pails of whitewash,
“Besides this, the principles of Political Economy are decidedly
opposed to the Sanitary humbug. Profits depend on wages—falling as
they rise, and rising as they fall. Wages depend on population. The
denser population is, the lower wages must be. T. if Sanitary
Improvements increase the number of children that are reared, the
it may be urged, that the Sanitary reformer is the selfish oppressor of
the poor. This motion you may find it worth while to work in your
ably-conducted Liberal newspaper, the Muddlewick Mirror. On the
other hand, it might be as well to get the Conservative Journal—the
Muddlewick Meteor—to take the other view, in favour of the Capita-
list. Sanitary reformers aim at raising the standard of Comfort amon
the working class. They are thus inducing a check of population, an
tending to raise, wages. They are, therefore, the enemies of the
Employer. In this way, you see, my dear Sir, you will have these
mischievous men between two fires; and, do them pretty brown on both
sides—if you will excuse the pun.
“In the House, however, I don't think there is much to fear. Between
ourselves, Ministers don't care a fig about the matter. The Public
Health Bill is only a sop thrown down to the noisy place-seekers out of
doors—the doctors, and philanthropists, and the popularity-hunting
parsons, and such fellows., LoRD PUMPKIN, perhaps, who has charge
of the Bill, cares as much about it as he can care about *f; But
then you know how soft he is—squeezeable to the last degree. Depend
upon it, by the time the measure drags its way through Committee it will
be a . tame snake indeed, with its fangs filed, and its poison-bag
extracted. -
“In all you say about the atrocious means of corruption, which this
Act will put within the reach of the Government, I entirely agree. We
cannot be too much on our guard against any measure creating appoint-
ments, which are certain, as all men of the world must know, to be

YESTERDAY.; A. TALE OF THE POLISH BALL.
BY A LADY OF FASBION.
“The absence of the Life Guards, being on duty against the Mob, occasioned some
disappointment to many of the fair fashionables at WILLIs's, on Monday night.”—
Morning Paper.
IONEL DE Boots was the son
of LoRD and LADY DE Boo-
TERstown, and one of the
most elegant young men of
this or any age or country.
His figure was tall and slim ;
his features beauteous: al-
though not more than eigh-
teen years of age, he could
spell with surprising correct-
ness, and had a sweet yellow
tuft growing on his chin,

A pattern of every excel-
lence, and brought up under
a fond mother's eye, LIONEL
had all the budding virtues,
and none of the odious vices
contracted by youth. He
was not accustomed to take
more than three glasses of
wine; and though a perfect

have heard his dear mamma remark, he never smoked those horrid

(CoLONEL GIZZARD), and was presented, on his appointment, on the
birth-day of his Sovereign. is fond mamma clasped her mailed
warrior to her bosom, and wept tears of maternal love upon his brilliant
cuirass, which reflected her own lovely image.
But besides that of her Ladyship, there was another female heart
which beat with affection's purest throb for the youthful LIONEI. The
lovely FREDERICA DE Torry (whose appearance at Court this year
created so thrilling a sensation) had long been designed by her eminent
parents; the EARL and CountEss of HARDYBAKE, to wed one day with
the brilliant heir of the house of De Boots.
.FREPERICA nearly fainted with pleasure when her LIONEL presented
himself at Alycampayne House in his charming new uniform., “My
military duties now call me,” said the gallant youth, with a manly sigh.
“But 'twill not be long ere next we meet. Remember thou art my
partner in LADY SMIGSMAG's Quadrille at the Polish Ball. Au revoir–
adieu !” Emotion choked further utterance, and, staggering from
the presence of Love, LIONEL hastened to join his regiment at
Kn—ghtsbrº-dge.
That night, as the Cavaliers of the Horse Guards Pink sate in their
tents, carousing to the health of their ladye-loves, news came from the
Commander-in-chief. that England had need of her warriors. The
Chartists had risen!...They were in arms in Clerkenwell and Penton:
ville. “Up, Cavaliers!” said the noble DEGIZZARD, quaffing a bumper of
Ypocras “Gentlemen of the Horse Guards, Pink, to arms!” Calling
his battle-cry, LIONEL laced on his morion; his trusty valet-de-chambre
placed it on the golden curls of his young master. To draw his sword,
to recommend himself to Heaven, and sweet ST. WILLIBAID, and to
mount his plunging charger, was the work of a moment. The next-
and the plumes of the Horse Guards Pink might be seen waving in the
midnight down the avenues of the Park, while the clarions and violins
of the band pealed forth the national anthem of Britons.
LIONEL's mother had taken heed that the chamber which he was to
occupy at the barracks was comfortably arranged for her young soldier.
Every elegant simplicity of the toilet, had been provided...“Take care
that there be bran in his foot-bath,” she said to his old servitor (pointin
at the same time to a richly-chased silver-gilt bain de pieds, emblazone
with the crest of the DE Bootses.) And she had netted with her own
hand a crimson silk, night-cap with a gold tassel, which she entreated
-nay, commanded him to wear. She imaged him asleep in his war-
chamber. “May my soldier sleep well,” she exclaimed mentally, “till
the ringing trump of morn wake up my !”
FREDERICA, too, as far as modest maiden may, thought of her LIONEL.
“Ah, CRINoLINETTE,” she said to her maid, in the French language, of
which she was a mistress, “Ah, que ma galant Garde-de-vie puisse bien
dormir ce nuit /*
LIONEL slept not on that night—not one wink had the young soldier.
In the moon, under the stars, in the cold, cold midnight, in the icy dawn,

measure steel with Fussell, or could stand for five, minutes point to
point with CUFFEY!” - But no actual collision took place, and the Life
Guards Pink returned to their barracks at dawn, when Colon EL
GIzzARD sent off a most favourable report to the Commander-in-Chief
of the gallantry of young DE Boots.
The warriors cared not for rest that day. A night in the saddle is no
hardship to the soldier; though LIONEL, feeling the approaches of
a cold and sore throat, only took a little water gruel and lay down for
half-an-hour to recruit himself. But he could not sleep—he thought of
FREDERICA ' ... “To-night I shall see her,” he said. 'Twas the night of
the Polish Ball, and he bade his valet procure from Hammersmith the
loveliest bouquet for FREDERICA, consisting of the rosy Magnolia, the
delicate Polyanthus, and the drooping and modest Sunflower.
The banquet of the Horse Guards Pink was served at eight o'clock
and LIONEL, to be ready for the ball, dressed himself in pumps and
antaloons, with an embroidered gauze chemise, and a mere, riband of
i. found his neck. He looked a young APOLLO as he sat down to
e .
But scarce had he put the first spoonful of potage à la reine to his
ruby lips, when the clarion again sounded to arms. “Confusion!” said
the gallant GizzARD, “the Chartists are again in arms, and we must
#: The banquet was left untasted, and the warriors mounted their
steeds.
So great was the hurry, that LIONEL only put on his helmet and
cuirass, and rode forth in his evening dress. ’Twas a pitiless. night;
the rain descended; the winds blew icy cold; the young soldier was
wet to the skin ere the Guards debouched on Clerkenwell Green.
And at that hour FREDERICA was looking out of the left window at
ALMACK's, waiting for LIONEL. -
Hours and hours he sat on his war-steed, through that long night-
the rain descended, the wind was more, chilly, the dastard Chartists
would not face the steel of the Loyal Cavaliers of the Horse Guards
Pink, but fled at the sight of our warriors. Ah! 'twas a piteous night!
FREDERICA was carried at daybreak to *...* House from the
ball. She had not danced all that night: she refused the most eligible
partners, for she could only think of her, Cavalier her º who
never came ! Her mamma marked her child's frenzied eye and hectic
cheek, and shuddered as she put her daughter to bed, and wrote a
urried note to DR. L–C–CK. -
At that hour, too, the Horse Guards Pink returned to their barracks.
The yeterans were unmoved; but, ah me! for the recruits! LIQNEI,

Last Saturday two hearses—the one bearing the helm and arms of a

how much of this agony might have have been spared if the odious
Chartists would but have staid at home, or if that young couple had taken
from twelve to fourteen of MoRIson's UNIVERSAI, Pius, instead of the
vile medicine with which “the Faculty” killed them?

Moves in the Right Direction.
WE have long inveighed against the nuisance of the passport
system, and the expense of it. Great alterations, however, have lately
taken place. Governments seem inclined to provide Foreign Ministers
with passports on the easiest terms, and to facilitate their travelling
in every way, so that they may experience no delay on their route. -
this manner have two Sardinian Ministers at foreign Courts, been
furnished with passports, and they have even been assisted in their depar-
ture. Our own Ambassador at Madrid has also been helped in the
same way. Every facility was afforded to him to leave the place with
all possible speed; and it is believed that the journey from England
and Spain never was so accomplished in so short a time, though the
distance between the two countries never was greater than at the
present moment.
. The Crops.
THE London Hay season is º favourably... We have
looked through the railings into the interior of Leicester Square, and
can assure the cab-horses of the metropolis that there will be this year
a good average crop. We have also seen two blades of grass, of the
very greenest description, sprouting up vigorously in the , Exeter
Change Arcade. The Beadle waters them regularly twice a day with
his tears, as the scene, he says, reminds him of the joyful hay-day
beleagured Policemen—now interposing between the infuriate mob and
the astonished Specials—everywhere LIONEL's sword gleamed in the
of his youth. An opulent farmer from Essex is in treaty with him for
the crop.

A SCHOOL FOR PRINCES.
| THE air of England has an extraordinary beneficial effect upon º
| Princes. When they leave their own country at the º of the
bayonet, and, without a change of linen, land at Dover, they generally
bring with them a very bad reputation. They have been driven away
because of their political and (sometimes).social vices; they arrive in
London; they are called upon by the nobility; they dine with JERSEY
and LoNDoNiekry; they visit a Chiswick Flower-show; they never
miss an Opera-night with JENNY LIND; and all the while they are so
constantly improving, that, at the end of two or three months, their
| dearest countrymen would scarcely know them. The last striking
instance of this amendment is in the person of , the PRINCE or
PRussia. He came direct here from Berlin, smelling woundily of
gunpowder and the blood of the Berliners. He was in very bad odour,
| indeed, for a few weeks. Since then he has performed quarantine from
home at the London West-end, and, within these few days, has quitted
| England, the sweetest of Princes. What says the Times of his amended
| Royal Highness?
“Every one who has had an opportunity of observing the demeanour of the illustrious
| Prince, and the attention which he has paid to the constitutional developement of our
institutions during his stay in England, must feel convinced that he departs sincerely
disposed to accept and serve the new constitutional monarchy with the same zeal and
self-devotion which characterised his adherence to the old order of things in Prussia.”
This is liberalism, made very easy. . Certainly, no sick baby—no
inhale the balmy breeze, drink new milk and smell cows' breath in some
suburban A —no pale, ricketty babe ever became so glowing and
so lusty, as the for. and pride of Prussia upon a few weeks’ London
air. And yet foreigners will abuse our fogs! How ungrateful, when
indirectly they so serve their inſant Constitutions. Still, we do not
think that advantages sufficient are derived from our political and
geographical atmosphere; and therefore , propose that a Political
Preparatory School should be opened, at which foreign heirs, apparent
and presumptive, should be properly educated for future thrones... We
wish we could induce LoRD BRough AM to superintend an establish-
ment of this sort. His world-wide fame would bring him scholars from
all quarters. We should see on his forms pupils of all colours, from
the coast of Guinea to the coast of France. In the lively hope that his

REVOLUTION IN THE DRAMA.
It is reported that among the performances at the Théâtre Historique
(formerly the Temple of the British Drama, Drury Lane) we are to
have Le Chevalier de la Maison Rouge. This is a piece which will create |
a true revolution in the Drama, if not elsewhere, by exhibiting one with
all its attendant atrocities, in progress upon the stage. As such a
spectacle is not likely to be particularly edifying, and as it is necessary
to adapt most French theatrical productions to the English taste, we
recommend that the Cheralier de la Maison Rouge should be Anglicised
under the title of The Gent of the Red House, and that the scene should
be laid at Battersea instead of amongst bloodshed and barricades.
There would be no harm in the lessons of a F. which would be sug-
- - - ere certainly is a slight
objection to one calculated to teach the Young English idea how to
shoot-on revolutionary principles.

AMongst the many
3. that are almost
y sentinto the QUEEN
we., notice a wonderful
Quilt, made of the most
curious patch-work. We
cannot tell what HER
MAJESTY does with all her
presents. The Pantechni-
convould scarcely contain
the produce of one year.
Probably , Buckingham
Palace is being enlarged
to contain a choice col:
lection of them. It will
form a most curious
museum, strangly stocked
with curiosities, alive and
stuffed, and to classify it
will require a Cuvier who
understands alike the
structure of a toy, the
anatomy of an Alderney
cow, and the fossilisation
of a seed-cake. We can-
not help wondering at the
very strange purpose of
some of the presents.
What does HERMAJESTY
want, with a Quilt? . It
might not fit her bed
either. Properly speaking,
a four-poster ought to
have been sent with it.
Now we can imagine
the sense of the gift, if a
Quilt had been sent to
LoRD John Russell.
He has been sleeping so
much recently, that it
might add to the comfort
of his slumbers. It might
be made, also, of the most
curious patchwork, that
is to say, portraits of the
different Members of his
Cabinet, all doze-a-doz-
ing. We are so much
in love with the notion,
that we give a design
gratis, for any intense
admirer of the Premier's
powers of somnolence, to -
copy it. As his Lordship is a member of the BEDFoºd family,
at the same time with the freedom of Beds.
PADDY REDIWIWUS.
WHATEVER may have been formerly the quality of Irish humour, the
only humour which Ireland has evinced of late has been dreadfully sour.
It is pleasant, therefore, to find a few stray sons of Erin emitting even
the faintest flashes of that drollery which was wont to set us in a roar.
The three following instances of Hibernian pleasantry are quite
refreshing, and remind us agreeably of other and better times.
On Tuesday night, at the Chartist meeting at Clerkenwell Green,
MR. DALY, of the Irish Confederation, declared that—
“He came there as one of the Irish Confederation, for the purpose of asking his fellow-
countrymen to form an offensive alliance with the Chartists of England.”
Admirable! What alliance could be more thoroughly offensive than
the combination proposed by MR. DALY f
MR. GRATTAN, on, the same evening, complaining of having been
misrepresented in the Morning Post, asserted that our peculiarly
fashionable contemporary
“Was mischievous, but perfectly harmless.”
Imagine the effect of this proposition on the Collective Wisdom.
| We understand that many Members have not recovered from it yet, and
that several of them—not, however, including MR John O'Connell—
were in real danger of dying on the floor of the House—with laughter.
“WE’RE ALL A-NoDDING,” &c.
a great compliment might be wrapped up in this Quilt by presenting him
Lastly, MR. Doheny, at a public dinner at Dunboyne, in allusion to
the present condition of Ireland, said–
“And if we do not better that condition, and prepare, we should only insult, the me-
mory of those patriots who sleep in their glorious graves, and why watch for the dawn
of Ireland's independence.”
Sure Ireland, then, is the land of patriotism. In what other country
upon earth are there patriots who sleep and watch at the same time,
|and that in their graves—patriots dead and buried, and alive and kicking,
|and asleep and wide awake? By the Powers, we should like to be
acquainted with these patriots, and go with MR. Doheny and plant
liaurels on their graves, and shake hands with the gentlemen under the
roots of the daisies
“See Naples, and then Die.”
THIs proverb has been cruelly verified by the recent massacres.
Strangers who went to see the beautiful city were so struck with the
above proverb, that they have not survived it. The inhabitants, too,
have fallen martyrs to it. Thus FERDINAND's, cruelty, promises to
become quite proverbial. If a nation be really judged, as is said, by its
roverbs, then Naples will be judged rather harshly by the one above;
| he sooner it is thrown into Vesuvius the better; the fire, combined
with the sulphur, might purify it.

THE MOB LEAVING THE ORATORY To RUN AFTER THE FIRE!
CoME, all lovers of Sedition for its own delightful sake;
Come, all disaffected rascals, a disturbance let us make;
Come, at midnight let us meet, ye revolutionary crew,
With no purpose in particular but rioting in view.
Whilst in almost every capital of Europe there’s a row,
Brother vagabonds, shall we alone continue quiet now *
What! of rapine, pillage, massacre, and all that sort of thing,
Fellow villains, is it only we that shall not have our swing f
No! my housebreakers and pickpockets, mythieves and cut-throats, no;
In our nightly mob assembled, what we’re made of let us show :
Let us bellow forth our rancour, let us howl and yell our hate
'Gainst all rule, and law, and order whatsoever in the state.
Let us shout, “Assassination' " whilst our Fussell recommends
Our approval of the sentiment—and take the hint, my friends;
Let us shriek aloud for pikes, and with the Patriot sympathise,
Who suggested flinging vitriol into British soldiers’ eyes.
Should the Guards appear, however, at that moment in our sight, .
We must set to work and cheer them, you observe, with all our might;
For, you know, they’re awkward customers, and 'tis our wisest plan,
With ourselves to make them fraternise, if anyhow we can.
Then, in long procession forming, all the thoroughfares we'll thread,
To create intimidation and excite alarm and dread;
Whooping treason as we march at night's unseasonable hour,
Breaking windows, lads, and doing all the mischief in our power.
Should the Specials or Policemen interfere to stop our course,
Knock them down, brave comrades—if of very much inferior force:
If it happens that our numbers should be only ten to one
Let them catch us if they’re able, whilst we nimbly run, boys, run.
Shan’t we have our insurrections—shan’t we have our barricades?
Shan’t we sing our Marseillaises * Yes, we will, my jolly blades.
Down with all our institutions—let them crumble in the dust.
Shan’t we have a revolution? Yes, we shall, we will, we must.
What with Trade though Wages perish? Plunder still we shall not lack;
Let Old England's power and greatness go to ruin and to wrack!
In our infamy we'll revel, we will glory in our shame;
Ape the foreigners, my hearties, and renounce the English name! .

PROFESSOR PUSSSSSSELL AND HIS TALENTED FAMILY ABOUT To AssassDNATE A “MINION.”
At one of the Chartist Meetings the other day, a MR. Fussell, who
is always. carrying out the meaning of his name by making a fearful
fuss, delivered himself of the declaration that he had five sons, and
would disown any one of them that refused to assassinate an enemy of
freedom. We can imagine what an exceedingly agreeable family
Fussell's must be, and what a beautiful spirit must animate the
domestic circle in which an objection to the crime of murder is regarded
as a piece of mawkishness that ought to banish the member who in-
dulges in it from the parental threshold. . We think FusseII, and his
five sons might go about like the DISTIN family, not to blow their own
trumpets, but to exhibit themselves as a party of British Savages. The
novelty of the thing would alone be sufficient to attract, and we re-
commend Fussell to # a caravan, for himself and cubs as soon as
possible, for the game of Chartist agitation has ceased to pay since the
attempt to get up a Liberty Fund ended in a balance of fourpence
against the Chartists.
THE DOWNY ONE.
. MR. FEARGus O'Connoh is i. as the reader will readily
imagine, after he has read the following bit of bombast, which is taken
from the Northern Star of May 20th, 1848:—
“MITCHEL, if you are convicted by the Whig Treason Act, my head shall feel no
pillow until your manacles are struck off.”
May we ask how the Member for all the Chartists has slept since
MR. MITCHEL has been convicted? Has he not been to bed for the
last two weeks? Or has he got over his dreadful threat % sleeping
without a pillow £ For, in that case, he would certainly feel none,
having none; or does he *i. head in a sling dangling from the
top of his room; or rest his head on a carpet-bag, for that is not,
strickly speaking, a pillow, as º one must have ºr. who has
slept in the cabin of a steamer, the floor his only bed, the rug his only
counterpane. We long to hear what MR. FEARGus O'ConnoR has
done with, his pillow. Doubtlessly, he uses it to smother his laughter
when he thinks of the foolish threats he makes to deceive his dupes,
A collection of his vows, taken from his paper, would not make j
pillow for him, if he likes to have something soft to lie upon.

A PROSPECT OF.Ye.VISCOVNTE
PALMERSTONE, PVTTYNGE HYS
SVTE. IN, IT, eſº
º THE MODEL BACHELOR.
He lives in Chambers. He is waited upon by an old laundress, who
lives he scarcely knows where. . He sees her once a week to pay her
wages; but hears her every morning putting his room to rights. He
rises late. He is skilful in lighting a fire—his practice generally of a
morning. He understands the principle of boiling a kettle, and can
cook a chop without burning his fingers. He bears all misfortunes
with º and goes out without an oath to take his breakfast at a
coffee-shop, if he is “out of tea.” He is not astonished if he finds no
loose silver in his trowsers, after they have been brushed. He has lost the
keys of his drawers. His tea-caddy is, also, open from morning to night,
the lock being, like his means, dreadfully hampered. He is uncertain
about the number of his shirts. He has not seen a button for years. He
cannot tell who drinks the grog, or what becomes of all the empty
bottles. He wonders who has taken his Waverly Novels, excepting
the second volume of the Pirate. He is allowed only one pair of boots per
diem. If he wants a clean pair, he must clean them himself, or wait till
the following morning. His washerwoman mends his linen—at least she
charges for it. He takes everything good-humouredly, but is a little put
out if he finds he has left his latch-key in his other coat, and that he cannot
get in. . He is a little ruffled, also, when he discovers the laundress has
not made his bed-on Christmas day, for instance. He plays only two
instruments—the flute and the cornet-à-piston. He is much sought after
in society, and is a great diner-out. He can tie his handkerchief in a
hundred different ways, and cuts an orange into the most impossible
patterns. He is a good hand at carving, and rarely sends a goose into
the opposite lady's lap. He makes excellent rabbits on the wall to
amuse the children, and allows them to climb up his knees, reckless of
his trowsers, and hang on his neck without a groan. He shines most
at, a supper party. He brews, a bowl of punch, and mixes a lobster
salad better than any man—so he says at least. He sings a good son
with a noisy chºrus, and makes a speech without *# unaccustome
to H. speaking.” He runs through a person's Health neater than
anybody else, and serves up a Toast in the most º: but does
not stuff a society with nothing else all the evening. He is amiable to
the fair sex, and hands cups of tea and #: of negus, without spilling
them. He is in great demand as a godfather, and keeps a silver mug
on hand, ready for the occasion. He enjoys his comforts, but doesn't
dine at home, for he has no cook. He studies his ease, but jumps u
readily on a cold morning to answer the door, if the knock is repeate
more than three times. . He knows where the best dinners are to be
had about town, and is intimate with the shops for the best meat, the
best fish, the best game, the best cigars, the best everything. He walks
up the stairs of his Chambers in the dark, without falling, or trying
at the wrong door. He prides himself on knowing a good glass of
port. He is the favourite stalking-horse of the husbands, who are never
out late, but they are sure to have been with him. Every “glass too
much” is put down to him; every visit to the Docks; all the half-
prices at the theatre; all the dinners and º no matter where,
are at his persuasion. The wives consequently bear him no great
affection, and generally convey their opinion by coupling his name with
the prefix “That,” very strongly italicised. . His good humour, how-
ever, conquers them, and he is welcome at every family table. He
sees everything, is seen everywhere, and scarcely cares anything for
anybody—excepting himself. His great object of life is enjoyment, and
he succeeds to his heart's content.
Suddenly he is missed. . He is not seen for weeks. He is entombed
alive in his dreary Chambers with the gout, and only his laundress to
tend him at distant intervals. The long days, the never-ending mights,
the racking pain, the cross old woman, who makes a favour of every.
thing and is grateful for nothing, the want of comforts, the utter home-
lessness of the place, strike a chill into his heart, and he would willingly
give all his past enjoyments for one kind voice to cheer him, for one
person whom he loved to be near him. He rises from his bed an altered
man. He finds out a young niece whom he has never seen. He buys a
house and gives it to her, to allow him to live in it. She nurses him in
all his sicknesses, and bears all his ill-humour. He leaves her his little
property, is as kind to her as the gout will allow him to be, and is lamented
at his death by one person, at least.—Thus lives and dies the MoDEL
BACHELOR.
THE MUSIC OF THE MOB.
WF wish that HULLAH, or RUssBLL, or DR. MAINZER, or anybody
would take in hand the voices of the Mob, and make them sing in
something like time or tune, if º must shout out the Marseillaise and
Moorear por lar patree in the public thoroughfares. The discordant
shrieks of the juveniles, with the hoarse and beer-stricken bleatings of
the men, form afar greater disturbance of the P. harmony than the
mere speeches of these lovers of mischief and idleness, who have no
#. to pretend to a voice in the .. as long as their musical
efforts are so contemptible as they appear when roaring out the revolu-
tionary burdens of the songs imported from Paris.
We met a crowd of these London gamins the other night in Fleet
Street, and we never heard anything in our lives so unmusical, though
most melancholy, as their attempt to sing some French air, in accordance
with the wretchedly slavish habit of imitation that the would-be sons
of Freedom have lately fallen into. Can nobody teach singing in six
lessons, and, preserve the drum, of our ear from being as constantly
aroused as the drums on which the rappel is all day beaten in Paris?
CALAMITOUS WISITATION |
IT is our agonising duty to inform a heart-rent public that the gout
w - - -
ilāS, ...; to the Morning Post, favoured the Jews, by confining to
the bowers of Blenheim the ducal Christian, MARLBoRough. ...We had
an ignorant notion, that such peers were permitted, even from the
antipodes, to vote by proxy. It appears, however, to be otherwise.
Or perhaps Blenheim and the gout make especial exceptions. Having,
we hope, duly prepared the reader to exercise his fortitude, and read a
bit of sorrow like a man, we give the subjoined:—
“His GRACE THE Duke of MARLBorough was prevented voting against the Jews
Disabilities Bill on Thursday last, by a severe and tedious fit of gout, which has
hitherto been the cause of His Grace not having yet taken his seat in the new Parliament."
Now, when we know, according to a recent calculation made by an
arithmetical man, MR. R. Y. YATEs, of Liverpool, that the House of
Marlborough has only costus £12,000,000 sterling, it must be confessed
that the least movement of the present Duke must be very dear to us.
Therefore, we dwell upon this fit of gout as being—like the Duke's
pension—one of national interest.
It is said, however, that the Duke has a peculiar dislike to Jews,
and for this reason. There was, on one occasion, a bad half-crown
taken at the gate of Blenheim–(it is two-and-sixpence a head to see
the place)—and no argument has hitherto convinced the Duke that
that copper half-crown was not put off by a guileful man of the
Hebrew persuasion. His Grace, to keep his anger warm, has had that
bad half-crown nailed to his dressing-table; and every morning shaves
with one eye upon his wrongs.

DRURY LANE SPECTRAL FUND.
THE Annual Dinner of the Ghost of Drury Lane Theatrical Fund took
place last week at the Freemasons' Tavern. The shadow of a distin-
guished Duke presided on the melancholy occasion. There was a
tolerable show of misty visitors; and the dinner was eaten seriously
and noiselessly.
“Not a knife was heard, not a three-pronged fork,
As the victuals were silently buried;
With never afizz flew the Champagne cork,
Nor steward, nor waiter was hurried.”
When the dinner was over, and the waiters had melted from the
room, the distinguished noble Ghost in the Chair rose, and speakin
thin-as ghosts are wont—and with a pallid smile upon its face, an
never blushing a bit at the sarcasm, begged to propose the “Prosperity
of the British Drama.” -
Hereupon the “Dead March in Saul” was played from an inner
apartment, and had a remarkably impressive effect. Several Ghosts of:
actors took out their pocket-handkerchiefs, and wept. After a pause,
for the spectres a little to recover themselves, the toast was again
given, which all the Shadows present drank in solemn silence out of
empty glasses. ---
After this, the ghost of MR HARLEy—spectral Master of the Fund—
rose to make its annual speech. Immediately behind the ghost was
exhibited a transparency, containing faithful portraits of several of the
horses, late actors at Drury-Lane Theatre. These faded away, and
then appeared the portrait of ALExANDRE DUMAs. ALExANDRE also
faded; and then dawned in the *ś in very bold letters—the
work of some evil genius—this brief" but malevolent counsel:—
“Gentlemen, take care of your pockets.” "
This occasioned a slight movement among the Ghosts. The company
stirred as stir the leaves when autumn sighs among them. When
º silence was restored, the spectral Master proceeded to make its
speech:-
“May it please you, my Ghost Duke, my Shadow Lords and Gentle-
men,” said the spectre, in a high, cutting voice, vibrating with fun
like an east-wind through a key-hole, “it is again my delicious privilege
to address you: it is, also, my delicious **** ilst revolutions are
shaking the world, as though the uneasy earth were stretching herself,
and now tossing upon one side and now upon the other (Spasms of
laughter)—it is my especial bliss to see, firm as rocks, the distinguished
patrons of what was once Drury Lane Theatrical Fund. As for the
real Drury Lane actors, one company has just departed for their forei
stables; and, at the present moment—M. DuMAs being manager of the
boards where GARRICK trod—(General flutter of Shadows)—an artist is
about to write beneath the statue of SHAKsp EARE, in golden words,
“Ici on parle Français!". Nevertheless, when Ireflectupon the brilliant
arena of the actors’ professional triumphs, and also remember that HER
MAJESTY WIcton LA, Queenof the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Dogs,
and Berwick-upon-Tweed, guards in her spotless diadem the Fund of
Drury Lane as the brightestiewel of her triple crown—when Iremember,
that HERMAJESTY has this day sent us £50, when, until very lately, the
royal donation was wont to be £100—how can I, even as the Spectral
Master of a Fund for actors in nubiºus, how can Ido otherwise than
feel; I ask it fearlessly of the Noble Shadows, how is it possible for me
to do otherwise than feel?” (Here the Ghoststruckitself upon the breast,
making such a hole in itself, that the daylight shone through it.
However, after a few moments, the Ghost closed up again like smoke,
and continued). “It has been said by the malevolent, that this dinner
in aid of actors of a theatre that no longer exists, is mere moonshine.
I mourn, most Noble, Shadow, for what were once my species, to say
that I have known the word ‘Gammon” flung at the object of this
dinner. Saving your noble presence, I hurl back the epithet. (Whist-
ling cheers)—and with that confidence which is far above blushing, I
ask you all to open your heart-strings—I mean your purse-strings—to
remember the poor player that may in the next century, perhaps, be at
Drury Lane—to think of the sere and yellow leaf-theintellectuall)rama
—the imperishable renown of the Crown of England—O. P., and the
British Sceptre—David GARRICK-habeas corpus—the Drury Lane
Fund, that was, and the British Drama.” -
A beautiful shade, named MIRAN, here warbled The Light of other
ays.
As the plate went round for the subscriptions, a ghost called SIMs
REEves sang very finely, and with touching significance, Let us take
the Road.
Every Ghost remained tillcockcrow; and then, with spectral HARLEY,
“vanished like a guilty thing away.”
THE REPEAL ** HANDS.”
Mitch EL boldly said—for we must praise the boldness of the man
—that he left behind him—“three hundred hands ready to follow |
his course.” Three hundred “hands,” no doubt, and not a trump
among 'em.

THE CLERKENWELL FOETs.
In the recent processions, or rather prowls, which have taken
place in London, a poet has been the most distinguished actor, and
indeed the only one who has evinced any desire to stick to his post
—a lamp-post-when the rumour of the arrival of the police has been
prevalent. We have had an ºpportunity of seeing some of the poet's
productions, and we beg to add a specimen. It is somewhat on the
model of a song, in a little book called Woices from the Crowd, entitled
“wait A LITTLE LONGER.”
There’s A. l coming, boys, there’s A.l coming,
But at his staff we’ll only laugh, --
Though A. 1's coming. -
What care we if we go tied,
Having received a broken head,
From A.1—coming?
Let us disdain the crack or kick,
If the Police prove stronger;
There’ll be some pockets yet to pick,
Don't hurry, then, to cut your stick–
Wait a little longer.

There’s a Special now coming, boys, a Special now coming;
Let’s knock the hat extremely flat
Of the Special now coming !
We’ll teach him how
To stop our row,

And p’rhaps some tills to ease of cash—
Wait a little longer!

ALEXANDRE DUMAs has obligingly consented to leave his hundred
feuilletons, his Monte Christo, his Liberté, his Mois, his politics made
romantic, his duels, his belle France, his everything, to come to London
and teach us French Dramas. We are to be instructed in French
history in the course of two weeks. Dramas, too, are to last for two
nights. You enter at the reign of CLovis, and come out at the º:
of the Bastille. You travel through, history at the rate of a hundre
years an act, and do not feel in the least giddy, only a little confused,
when you arrive at the end of your historical journey.
To make the arrangements as convenient as possible, the stalls will
be fitted up as French beds, and persons have been engaged to go round
and collect the boots, so that they may be cleaned by the following

in finding check-takers who would give

Lord Johns Russell was guilty of murder. He (MR. Mulles) now charged him with

Are there no straitjackets to be had in Ireland? No men bold
enough to catch madmen like MULLEN, cram them into worsted confines
carry them off to an asylum—and when their heads are shaved, and
they are properly cooled and lowered by medicine, is there no oakum
for them to pick, no stones to break? Yet, we would be tender to the
lunatics; and when they became harmless—their sanity is not to be

A LITTLE DINNER AT TIMMINS’s.
THE next persons whom little MRs. TIMMINs was bent upon asking,
were MR. and MRs. John Rowdy, of the firm of STUMPY, Row DY, AND
Co., of Brobdingmag Gardens, of the Prairie, Putney, and of Lombard
Street, City.
MRs. TIMMINs and MRs. Rowdy had been brought up at the same
school, together, and there was always a little rivalry between them,
from the day when they contended for the French prize at school, to
last week, when each had a stall at the Fancy Fair for the benefit of the
Daughters of Decayed Muffin-men; and when . TIMMINs danced
against MRs. Rowdy in the Scythe Mazurka at the Polish Ball, headed
by Mrs. Hugh SLAshER. Rowdy took twenty-three pounds more than
MMINs in the Muffin transaction (for she had possession of a kettle-
holder worked by the hands of R-y-lty, which º: crowds to her
stall); but in the Mazourk Rosa º: she has the prettiest little
foot possible (which in a red boot and silver heel looked, so lovely that
even the Chinese Ambassador remarked it), whereas MRs. Row Dy's
foot is no trifle, as LoRD CoRNBURY acknowledged when it came down
on his Lordship's boot tip as they danced together amongst the Scythes.
“Those people are ruining themselves,” said MRs. John Rowpy
to her husband, on receiving the pink note. It was carried round by
that rogue of a buttony page in the evening, and he walked to Brob-
dingmag Gardens and in the Park afterwards, with a young lady who is
kitchen-maid at 27, and who is not more than fourteen years older than
little Buttons.

“Those people are ruining themselves,” said MRs. JoHN to her
husband. “Rosa says she has asked the BUNGAYs.” -
“BUNGAYs, indeed! TIMMINs was always atuſt-hunter,” said Rowdy,
who had been at College with the barrister, and who, for his own part,
has no more objection to a Lord than you or I have ; and adding,
“Hang him, what business has he to be giving parties?” allowed MRs.
Rowdy, nevertheless, to accept Rosa's invitation.
“When I go to business to-morrow, I will just have a look at MR.
Fitz's account,” Rowdy thought, “and if it is overdrawn, as it
usually is, why” . . . ... The announcement of MRs. Rowpy’s
brougham here put an end to this agreeable train of thought, and the
banker and his lady stepped into it to join a snug little family party of
two-and-twenty, given by MR. and MRs. SECONDCHOP, at their great
house on the other side of the Park.
“Rowdys 2, BUNGAYs 3, ourselves and mamma 3, 2 SAWYERs,” cal-
culated little Rosa. -
“GENERAI. GULPIN,” Rosa continued, "eats a great, deal, and is
very stupid, but he looks well at a table, with his star and ribbon; let
us put him down!” and she noted down “SIR THOMAs and LADY
GUIPIN, 2., LoRD CASTLENooDLE, l.”
“You will make #. party abominably genteel and stupid,” groaned
TIMMINs. “Why don’t you ask some of our old friends? Old MRs.
Pontyan has asked us twenty times, I am sure, within the last two
“And the last time we went there, there was pea-soup for dinner!”
MRs. TIMMINs said, with a look of ineffable scorn.
“Nobody can have been kinder than the Hodges have always been
to us; and some sort of return we might make, I think.”
“Return, indeed! A pretty sound it is on the staircase to hear MR.
and Mrs. Óige and the Miss ODGEs, pronounced by BILLITER, who
always leaves his h’s out. No, no; see attornies at your Chambers, my
dear—but what could the poor creatures do in our society?” And so,
one by one, TIMMINs's old friends were tried and eliminated by MRs.
TIMMINs, just as if she had been an Irish Attorney-General, and they
so many Catholics on MR. MITCHEL's Jury.
MRs. FITzRoy insisted that the party should be of her very best
company. FUNNYMAN, the Great Wit, was asked, because of hisjokes;
and MRs. BUTT, on whom he practises; and Potter, who is aske
because everybody else asks him; and MR. RANVILLE, RANVILLE of the
Foreign Office, who might give some news of the Spanish squabble;
and Both ERBY, who has suddenly sprung up into note because he is
intimate with the French Revolution, and visits LEDRU-Rollin and
LAMARTINE. And these, with a couple more who are amis de la maison,
made up the twenty, whom MRs. TIMMINs thought she might safely
invite to her little dinner.
But the deuce of it was, that when the answers to the invitations
came back, everybody accepted! Here was a pretty quandary. How
they were to get twenty into their dining-room, was a calculation
which poor TIMMINs could not solve at all; and he paced up and down
the little room in dismay.
* “Pooh!” said Rosa with a laugh; “your sister BLANCHE looked
very well in one of my dresses, last year; and you know how stout she
is. We will find some means to accommodate them all, depend upon it.”
. MRs. John Rowdy's note to dear Rosa, accepting the latter's invita-
tion, was a very gracious and kind one: and MRs. Fitz showed it to her
husband when he came back from Chambers. But there was another
note which had arrived for him by this time from MR. Rowdy—or
rather from the firm; and to the effect that MR. F. TIMMINs had over-
drawn his account £62,18s. 6d., and was requested to pay that sum to
his obedient servants, STUMPY, Rowdy, and Co.
. And TIMMINs did not like to tell his wife that the contending parties
in the Lough Neagh and Lough Corrib Railroad had come to a
settlement, and that the fifteen guineas a day had consequently deter:
mined. “I have had seven days of it, though,” he thought;" and that
will be enough to pay for the desk, the dinner, and the glasses, and
make all right with STUMPY AND Rowdy.”
THE PORCUPINE WITH MANY FRIENDS.
THE Herald, with its accustomed sagacity, has discovered the cause
of SIR HENRY BULweR's triumph in the Commons. He belongs to
literature!, (How low is this in the serene eyes of a newspaper mag-
nifico!). The ex-ambassador is the porcupine with many friends. No
sooner is he threatened to be carried away by a stream of eloquence; by
“A river that hath burst its BANKEs,”
than all his porcupine friends rally to his aid. . All sorts of kindred
quills rustle to help him. The Herald proceeds to number them:-
“Then again there is Ma. SHIEL. The hon. and learned Master of the Mint is not
merely a personal friend of SIR. H. BULwen, but a brother author; and if the Right Hon.
MR. LErevak, the Speaker, had eyes and ears for all desirous to be heard, there were
MILNEsrs and others to rush to the rescue of a suffering scribe, [poor goosequill wretch]
in the enforced absences of the eloquent and learned MACAULAY, and the late Member for
Canterbury, the accomplished MR. SYDNEY SMYThk."
With so many literary men in Parliament—and with other probable
Members, is it to be wondered at that the Commons do not, and will
not, represent the people of England? ... There ought to be an express
law prohibiting all men from seats in Parliament who can write, allowing
eligibility only to those persons who can make their mark.
It was urged in the Post as a complaint against the Literary Fund,
that at the last dinner no notice whatever was taken of the newspaper
press. Let such omission be henceforth remedied. At the next fes-
tival let the great man of the Herald be stood during dinner upon the
table, with his own paper fashioned into a coronet, and his sceptre
uill—wherewith he rules the world—stuck in his button-hole. So
istinguished a member of the newspaper press ought not to be
neglected at a banquet of letters.
The Approach of Summer. A Rhapsody.
EveRYTHING betokens Summer!, The fly with fatal curiosity skim-
ming the surface of the milk; the blouse of brown holland-with the
inviting words “Look here!”—floating in the breeze; the five million
straw bonnets labelled “Now’s your time! all at 3s. and 9d.” thrown
carelessly into the window; the dust rushing up to make itself the
“apple of your eye;” and indeed º, betokens the approach of
the saucy Summer. The London fountains begin to run with ginger-
beer, and Rome rises on the ruins of Pompeii in the Gardens of the
Surrey Zoological. Activity reigns in the Thames Navy, and pro-
motions are numerous from the cab-stand to the paddle-box, on the top
of which the cab-driver of to-day will become the captain of to-morrow.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Frenchified method of
THE RAPPEL.
WHEN we first heard of the Rappel, we thought it was only a new
--- pronouncing the Hibernian word * Repale.”
However, it is a cry, apparently, that is making just as much noise in
Paris as the one in Dublin, and is every bit as hollow and as foolish.
The French beat it at all hours, and it is thought to have superseded all
the bells and door-knockers in France. If you want any one to come to
you, you beat, the rappel, and they run out in hundreds; though, with
the more º of society, such as the portiers, and the old
tentiers of the Marais, it has rather a repelling effect. By the bye, it
has been suspected that at the very early hour the rappel sometimes
is beaten, that it, must be done in bed...This is very likely; for,
as no Frenchman thinks of going to bed without his drum at his side,
it may be sounded as a signal of distress that he wants his shaving
water, or that he is waiting for his boots.
All this is very alarming, and is doubtlessly very trying to the nerves of
persons who have been accustomed to the quiet of London, where not a
‘Sweep” is heard, withoutbreaking an Act of Parliament. It is true we
have the dustman's belland the muffin bell; but what are these tinkling
sounds, which are but pleasantly suggestive of the sheep browsing on
Primrose Hill, to the deafening ran-tan-plan-ram-tan-tan-plan, which does
not allow you to sit on your chair for two minutes together, without
giving you such ashock that electricity would be pleasant to it? For our-
selves, if we were made, as a punishment, togoto Paris, we would rushto
MR. BURFoRD's Panorama, and lodge there till the term of our durance
had expired. We should have all the beautiful scenery of Paris, should
witness the planting of a Tree of Liberty, without being subject to that
confounded rappel all day, to give us a headache all night. We enjoy a
fine view all the more without noise, and we advise all travellers in-
tending to visit Paris this year, to take the route of Leicester Square.
It is the cheapest trip we know, and there is not a single drum on the
premises.
THE SENTIMENTS OF A 'SQUIRE.
THERE is at least one fine old English gentleman, who, albeit one of
the olden time, possesses a seat in the modern House of Commons, and
who, on the debate on the Game Certificates for Killing Hares Bill,
delivered himself of a remarkably fine old English speech. MR. Buck
“Was convinced that many of the sons of small farmers in the county herepresented,
were already demoralised by running about the country after hares and woodcocks.”
If the pursuit of hares and woodcocks is demoralising, what demo-
ralisation must exist in the House of Commons, so many of whose
Members are addicted to it! How demoralised those same gentlemen will
become two months hence, in consequence of running about the moors
after grouse! How obvious is the conclusion, that we ought to destroy
all the hares and woodcocks, and also the grouse, for the interests of
morality! This inference is rational, but it is not MR. Buck’s.
“He believed that this Bill was intended as the first step to the annihilation of the
Game Laws. This Bill permitted free trade in hares; and next year, they would have
the hon. Member for Manchester coming forward, and proposing free trade in pheasants
and partridges. The next thing would be to put down foxes, and so destroy one of our
greatest national sports.”
MR. Buck of course includes hare and pheasant, and partridge-
shooting among those national sports of which he describes fox-hunting
as the greatest...But hare-shooting, according to him, is no sport for
the sons of small farmers: small farmers' sons, then, in his opinion,
form no part of the nation. Moreover, fox-hunting is one of the
greatest of our national sports; consequently it is one of the chief
amusements of the English people. It follows that fox-hunters and the
English people are convertible terms; and also, that MR. Buck and his
brother sportsmen may be compared to the celebrated three tailors of
Tooley Street.
Oh, MR. Buck! Are these the times for upholding the Game Laws
—for taking serious political account of hares, pheasants, partridges,
and foxes? You are indeed a rare old Buck: it is only a pity that such
Bucks are not rarer.
DREADFUL DESTITUTION.
As. †† is being publicly talked about, we think there is an
English colony that deserves a prior right to all others. It is close at
hand, the expense of transportation is *...*. it has
numerous claims upon English sympathies. e mean Boulogne-sur-
Mer. The inhabitants have always behaved in the most liberal spirit to
Englishmen; they have never overcharged them; in fact they have
treated them more like fellow-countrymen than foreigners. They have
always done everything to make them comfortable, and have yielded to
their wishes in the same generous way that they have invariably con-
formed to their wants. Late accounts bring us sad intelligence of the
distress of this once-flourishing town. The lodgings are to let; the
hotels have scarcely a bed filled; the table-d'hôtes are deserted, and the
custom-house officers, whose courtesy must be remembered by every
traveller, have nothing to do but to search their own pockets; and the
pursuit is not of the most pleasant, as, search as they will, they can find
nothing in them. The town is just º There is not an English-
man in the place! This is very melancholy, and we hope Government
will take speedy measures to avert the dreadful consequences that
must otherwise result to the inhabitants. They should give every
inducement to emigrants to flock there; and probably if excursions
were got up which carried passengers free of expense, it might pour
into the town a sufficient number of tourists to keep the hotels open
and the waiters alive for a few weeks longer.
We should recollect how dear Boulogne has always been to the
British traveller, and should rush over to repay a few of the obligations
we owe the hospitable pille, haute as well as basse. We hope all those
who make a business of pleasure will recollect that if there is one place
more in want of their presence, and where the inhabitants will receive
them with greater pleasure than another, it is their old summer friend,
Boulogne. They need not be reminded to take plenty of money with
them, as it follows that the more they take, the more they will be wel-
º º will have the satisfaction of spending it in the noble cause
01 Unarity.
After Events.
METTERNIGH’s flight has been followed by that of FERDINAND... The
Minister's old saying, of “After me, the Deluge,” should be altered
now into “After me, the Emperor.” who will go next, it is impossible
to be, as an Irishman would say, “after knowing.” By the bye, we
much prefer DUNUP's saying to METTERNICH's. The poor fellow,
when he heard of “the Deluge,” exclaimed quite indignantly, “Pooh!
What’s that! After me, the Sheriff's officer.”
PANIC IN THE JOKE MARKET.
We understand that there are no less than five hundred punsters out
of employ in London alone at the present time, to say nothing of the
vastamount of jokers out of workin the provinces. In Manchester there
are no less than fifty first-rate wags, working half-price, and several of
the old hands who have been constantly employed in spinning yarns,
are literally without employment.
The Picture of an Advertised Gentleman.
His form was enveloped in a “Registered Paletot,” with a “Paragon
West” and "Victoria Trowsers.” His neck was encircled by a “Revolving
Cravat,” his bosom displayed a “Corazza Shirt,” whereon glittered a
splendid pin of the “Richest Mosaic.” His hands were encased in snowy
erlin; hischaussure consisted of “Pannuscorium;” he wore the Superior
“Chapeau Français” at nine-and-six, surmounting the “Gentleman's own
Head of Hair, or Invisible Peruke;” and his parted lips disclosed an
“Entirely New Description of Teeth.”

THE WOMEN'S CHARTER.
We believe in the speedy freedom of the female sex. That
beautiful half of the creation—and, like the rosy side of a
each, the much better half—has too long been in bonds.
he cunning, the selfishness, and the cowardice of man
have, apart and together, operated for many thousand
years to crush the lovely flower, or at best that he might
wear it—as one may say, in his button-hole as little more
than a fragrant, blooming ornament for a brief holiday.
These days are fast going—dying upon the save-all of
Time. At length women are beginning to know their own
strength, at length the hour of equality is about to
strike; and when it has struck, the world will really for
the first time know what’s o'clock.
The women, be it known them, have resolved upon
a Charter; a triple Charter, for Maid–Wife—and Widow.
Each condition of life is to rest upon its seven points.
At present, we are only enabled to give them: but we
are happy to inform our readers (Women, of course) that
a magnificent meeting has been determined upon; it
will take place in Kensington Gardens, under the º eye of the
military—within the very smell of gunpowder—to show the world that
Women, at least, are not afraid of soldiers.
We have, as the earnest and uncompromising advocate both of the
Rights of Woman, and of setting Woman to Rights, been favoured
with a placard, printed in gold letters upon white satin (which placard
it is our intention to have worked up into a waistcoat); and of which
the subjoined is an ink-and-paper copy:-
*Wom EN or THE UNIVERSE-
“Since the first pippin was bitten, it has been the cuming of Man tº
talk to us of our duties. The time has now arrived that we should
speak of our rights!
“Why should the feast of the good things of this world be given to
men—and why should we, like children after dinner, be only brought in
with the dessert? - - -
“The hour is arrived when we should throw back the pippin in man's
face; when we should repudiate the dominion exercised so many
thousand years to our subjection,-when women should have their
Charter, full of points, like a pincushion.
“Therefore, every woman—who is henceforth to be considered every
woman's sister—is invited to hold herself in readiness to meet in
Kensington Gardens on a day to be hereafter privately appointed.
. “As the enemy [it is needless further to particularize] may muster
in great force, every sister is entreated to come armed; yes, armed—to
the teeth. She will therefore see it expedient to wear new bonnet
strings, (if possible, a new bonnet). She must further not fail to dress
in her best gown; and further, to bring with her any bonnet or shawl
that she may consider to have the most fatal effect upon the enemy!
“Every woman will also provide herself with a serviceable parasol:
which—for sharpshooting—is occasionally found of the most efficient use.
“It is moreover expressly required of every single woman, and of
every widow, that she do not appear upon the ground without ºf
with her a stout substantial wedding-ring (with unmistakeable Hall-
mark), to the effect that, should the enemy attacklus—the single captives
may instantly be tried by martial law, and with the speediest benefit of
clergy be condemned to a settlement for life. (A parson will be in
attendance.)
Wºº-be ready to appearin full dress (if possible) at six hours'
notice:
“P.S. No curl-papers can be admitted to sororize.”
“THE MAID'S CHARTER.
“I. That unlimited pocket-money should begin at sixteen.
“II. That when, by the selfish neglect of the worst part of the
species—whom to name is often to blush—the question is not put, it
shall be onerous upon the spinster to put the said question herself.
“III. That she shall be permitted to break of a match either at the
beginning, the middle, or just at the end, with no liability for an Action
for Breach. -
“IV. That no such indulgence be granted to the other party; and
that transportation be added to damages.
“W. That neither fathernor mother be asked for consent, except
by way of compliment, when it is known they have no objection to the
gentleman.
“WI. That when the marriage is solemnized, the Duke or WELLING-
Ton shall give away the bride.”
“THE WIFE's CHARTER.
“I. That the Honeymoon shall last six months.
“II. That the amount of household expenses be fixed by her; with
an unlimited allowance for extras.
“III. That she chooses the watering-place for the season.
“IV. That she be never called upon to sit up; and further, that she
be never solicited for a latch-key.
“W. That the husband invariably smoke in the garden, (if no garden,
no smoke.)

“THE WIDOW’s CHARTER.
“I. That weeds—with the earliest despatch—be turned into orange-
flowers.”
The Widow’s Charter, it will be perceived, is only one point; but as
that one is to possess all the points of the wife, her Charter may be said
to aim at seven.
Our readers will be glad to learn that the authorities are fully alive
to the objects of the very dangerous individuals about to collect their
forces in Kensington Gardens. The Life Guards and Blues will be
called out; and it is further said that the “Duke”—in his own quiet,
energetic way—has ordered the Bands to keep the ground.
A new nunny MEDE.
JOBSON IN THE SUBURBS.
OUR old friend Jobson, of Ramsgate, who dresses uplike the Admiral
in Black-Eyed Susan, and declares himself commissioned by the Govern-
ment to sell penny Pickwicks at threepence each, and regular book-
muslim, under the pretext that the former have been smuggled from
the Havannahs, and the latter from India—our old friend Jobson, we
repeat, has set an example that has lately been followed at Kensington
and Hammersmith. Some individuals have taken the Assembly-rooms
at each town for three days, to give the nobility of those places an
opportunity of purchasing the manufactures of their native land at the
prices of foreign rarities. Worsted comforters have been disguised
as Turkish turban-pieces, direct from the backs of the Llama; and
several muffs, raw from the hide of the Leicester Square Cat, have
been offered to human muffs as rare specimens stripped from the downy
chests of the Cassowaries on the banks of the Ganges.
We believe that the Kensington nobility, and the Hammersmith
Aristocracy have not embraced very eagerly the liberal offer that has
been made to them, nor do we hear that a collateral appeal to the
Fulham Oligarchy has been much more successful. We can only say
that, if the goods represented as smuggled were really found in the
hands of smugglers, the contrabandists # this country give themselves
extraordinary pains to introduce, in an indirect manner, those very
articles that might have free admission to England, inasmuch as they
happen to have been there before, and are entitled to the P. of
visiting their own country. There must be a great deal of ridiculous
smug #. oing on formere smuggling's sake, if the collections of
seized goods offered to, the public. by the self-styled Government
Contractors may be relied on as genuine seizures.
IRISH SYMPATHISERS.
Weimagine that MR. John O'Consell will soon be in a position to
sympathise with Irish landlords. As Conciliation Hall seems likely to
; broken up, it is probable that he will know what it is not to get
s rent.

THE
Prologue.
OH, Whigs and Whiglings, let me speak:
Chance after chance has passed away,
And we’ve been waiting many a week,
For all you said you’d do some day.
And much amaze hath crossed my min
To see you in your pleasant doze
On Treasury Benches, and behind,
A country full of wants and woes.
And so I watched you, till at last, -
Marking your coolness, I grew warm,
And an old fairy-legend cast,
For your sakes, in a novel form.
The Sleeping House.
New worlds grow old, old worlds grow new,
Kings, firms, and people rise and fall:
The House is still the House you knew—
In act or speech no change at all!
Rumours come now and then, 'tis said,
Whispers what’s passing out of doors,
Like hints and shakings of the maid,
To one who 'neath the blanket snores.
Here soft repose, in what concerns
The public, reigneth night and day;
There’s no one reads the long returns
Which some one’s moving for, alway;
Here, not of this age, but the last,
In a somnambulistic strain
Protection twaddles of the past,"
And dreams the Corn Law’s come again.
3 Jairn Cale for the Cimes.
Like parent hen upon her eggs,
Each Member o'er his crotchet broods,
And whether on (or of his legs,
Bores drearily; no stir intrudes
Scarce e'en when goes a batch of kings;
And much more stagnant seemeth all,
Than would seem possible, with things
In any but this Sleeping Hall.
All round, ideas shoot and grow
Like ivy's close and clinging wood;
Fearless o'er Church and State they go,
O'er true and false, o'er bad and good;
And thick abuses—growth unclean-
Close-matted round the doorways climb,
And through them, here and there, just seen,
The glories of the better Time!
When will this reign of Nod expire,
And Act and Work be born again?
When will the sleeping House require
New measures, fitting for new men?
Here all is sleepy, stale, and flat;
“What has been, must be,” still the plan:
Hence, Whig and Tory, Rad and Rat,
And make way for “the Coming Man!”
The Sleeping Beauty.
Session on Session, in his seat -
He sitting, since a date unknown,
From feet to head, from head to feet, ,
Obstructions of all sorts have grown.
SLEEPING BEAUTY OF ST. STEPHEN’S.
'Gainst the red box his back reclined,
On Treasury cushions snugly curled,
The sleeping Premier's eyes are blind,
And ope not on the stirring world.
He sleeps! men's comments are not heard
In Whitehall Chambers far apart:
Nor seats nor salaries are stirred—
Things closest to each Whigling's heart.
He sleeps! on every side j.
Griefs, groans, and grumblings ill supprest;
He sleeps, nor dreams but all is well—
A perfect Whig, in perfect rest.
The Arrival. '
In Politics’tis well to know, -
Those who would win must learn to wait;
Trains Parliamentary are slow,
And precious things come precious late.
He travels by a faster coach,
A novel flag he hath unfurled !
The Coming Man! of whose approach
DISRAELI hath warned the world.
He gazes on the gallant dead,
Their epitaph in HANSARD reads,
This notion flashes through his head-
“They tried with words, I'll try with deeds.”
Strange things out of strange places hie;
From all sorts of snug nests about,
The oddest sorts of creatures fly,
But he bears on, nor fears their rout.

There rose a buzz of tongues and clocks,

THE VERNON GALLERY.
(A DESIGN TO BE STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED FOR THE PROPOSED GALLERY.)
THE way an English Government patronises the Fine Arts is by
accepting pictures and then building ugly, mews, which it calls a
Gallery, to shut them up in. If it does purchase a picture itself, it is
either a friendly job, to put a few thousands into the pocket of some
Lord who is rather distressed for a little loose cash; or else it buys a
bad “copy” at the price of a good “original.” Now we think the
very least a Government can do, after receiving a º: gift, is to
show a grateful sense of its value by giving it handsome warehouse-
room. We hope, above all things, that the cruet example of the National
Gallery will be carefully avoided; or else, following out the same style
of architecture, we may have a building composed of a complete dinner
service, so that if at any time the English Masters should feel them-
selves rather “dry,” they would only have to go above head and help
themselves to a friendly glass., .We have mustard and pepper-pots, at
one Gallery; we trust the architect (whoever, he may be) of the other
will not fall head over ears into a set of tumblers and decanters, for if
he does, the result must inevitably be a tremendous “smash.”. We
wonder when we are to have a Gallery or a Statue that shall not be a
disgrace to the nation, and a source of ridicule to foreigners? Where
is the “Coming Man” of the Fine Arts P
OMNIBUS
MUCH confusion has arisen since the reduction of Omnibus fares.
It was for a long time a matter of dispute which was the precise spot
of .. Square, and it almost required an Act of Parliament to de-
termine the exact boundary line of ºf Cross. These difficulties, how-
ever, have been got over, and, we are glad to say, without bloodshed;
but another obstacle has late; occupied their º: place. The
ingenuity to extort an additional threepence out of a passenger is some-
thing wonderful, and proves the extraordinary bent of the omnibus
mind. The trick is as follows. On a bit of pasteboard is printed a
monster 3d., occupying the centre of the card, and running from top
to bottom. On one side of this Brobdi ian figure is printed, in
respectable-sized letters, “ALL THE WAY; ” and on the other side are
enumerated, in the most Lilliputian type, the different distances that
make up a threepenny ride. º: the distance consists of two
or three streets; sometimes only the length of one street; in some
cases it is from one turnpike to another;, and in others it is very little
more than, going across the road. In this way the passenger cannot
escape without paying his full fare; for, as he gets out, the threepences
are cast up, and he is lucky indeed if he gets off with merely paying two
distances—that is to say, his sixpence. The scheme is very clever, onl
it requires one or two journeys before it can be properly understood,
and considerable experience in omnibus statistics before it can be
fully appreciated. Strangers are rather puzzled at first to understand
the difference between “All the way,” and having it chopped up into a
half-dozen distances, cash payable threepence; but before they have
been in town a week they get used to it, and pay the fare without feeling
in the least astonished. Habit is everything. It is curious how soon

These are all mysteries to us; but it is evident that, the Lord Cham-

about British Manufactures. We have been informed that he been

secrets of trade, to be able to tell, at a single glance, rabbit-skin frółn
ermine, and to detect French leather that is endeavouring to pass itself
as a pump of the best Bermondsey. He has made wonderful progress;
but it is evident that our Lord Chamberlains, for the future, have
to be apprenticed to a tailor and a milliner, before they will be qualified
to accept office. . By the bye, we wrote to know if the cream-coloured

short TIME, AND I Think IT HAD BETTER BE You.”
-
OUR facetious and useful contemporary, the Builder, informs us that
the works at Buckingham Palace are suspended on account of the short-
ness of money. Everything is consequently slack, except the lime,
which remains as before, for want of the necessary funds to pay for the
slacking. It is said that the labourers are to be put upon short time;

CONSCIENCE MONEY.
The Earl of Ellenborough, Sinecurist and Pensioner, unbosometh himself.
“Mr. Punch,
“I BELIEVE it is by no means enough to say that all Christen-
dom, has vibrated with my speech upon “broad Christianity against
the Jews—vibrated, like any steeple with triple-bob major. Well, Sir, I
wish to be worthy of my increased reputation. I want to grow up to
my own ideality. I desire to be known throughout the world as the
*śn Earl; as, emphatically, the British nobleman without guile.
I desire henceforth to be measured by the simple rule of Christianity;
to be, in a word, a shining light of the House of Lords.
“The saving salt of Christianity is self-devotion. Now, I propose
from this moment to give myself up to my country. . It is my serious
intention to shame the Jews by the lively force of contrast... I purpose
to set-off their avarice by my own generosity; to put to the blush their
money-bags (if, Sir, money-bags can blush, of which many excellent
persons are prone to venture a doubt) by my own empty pocket. I
purpose to make a clean purse of it; and so to prove that my oration
touching the loveliness and duty of Christianity was not, merely like so
many stones in a tin-pot, rattled to tickle the long-eared ones of the
world without. No, Sir ; on the memorable night of that speech, I
felt myself a new-born Christian. It refused to ride home in my
carriage; and the yery next morning, gave orders, for a horse-hair
corazza. Not that I think sourness and penance part of Christianity;
certainly not; but in my own case, I beg to be allowed a little
wholesome mortification.
“It is well known, Sir, that my father (who tried HoNE, and after
much º nothing in him) was Chief Justice of England. Now,
Sir, in his days to be Chief Justice was to make the very º penny
by the commodity that was nominally sold at his Court. his time,
the scales of Justice were as the scales of a money-changer. LoRD
ELLENBoRough, as the solemn depositary of Justice, held in his gift
certain offices for which—it is º record—he refused eighty thousand
guineas. For his Lordship had the feelings of a father, and provided
for his son out of the pocket of the public. His Lordship blessed me
with the place, which turned into a pension—as the grub changeth into
a golden butterfly—the place of Clerk of the Court of King's Bench;
for the which iſ a sinner and a Christian—have hitherto received
£7700 per annum. ... Furthermore, the same paternal love made me

Pension as Clerk . - £7700-0 0
Custos Brevium - 2338-19 8
£10,038-19 8
| “. Let us take this for some thirty years, with compound interest.
| And afterwards let us suppose the goods and chattels of a weaver, or
stocking-maker to be worth £218s. Such weaver or stocking-maker
is seized upon for taxes. How many weavers or stocking-makers must
º . up to pay thirty years' pension and sinecure of Clerk and
ustos
. “In this manner, Sir, after my memorable speech, against the Jews,
in this downright literal fashion has my thin-skinned conscience
presented the sum to me.
“Ever since that speech, I have been followed, haunted by the spirit
|of Christianity. You recollect my beautiful-Q must use the epithet)–
beautiful peroration to the Peers:- My Lords, let us not legislate for
private purposes or private expediency; let us not, above all, deprive
ourselves, in a crisis like the present, of all right to heavenly aid by
sanctioning such a desecration of faith as that involved in this Bill!”
My good spirit has again and again, repeated these melodious words:
they have been singing in my world-cleansed ears, singing like the voice
of cherubim. And then the spirit would thus wholesomely rate me:-
‘Come, ELLENBoRough, be to thy heart's content a Christian. Show
thy hatred of the Jew and Christian, by making common fellowship
with thy poorer brethren. Take no money that thou dost not earn.
Refuse to eat and drink and wear the poor man's sweat, changed as it
is into cakes, and wines, and rich apparel: proclaim thyself, by thy
deeds, the Christian that thou art; and let thy words, so full of balm
and honey, be the small preface to thy biggeractions. Thou hast eaten
taxes for many years, therefore disgorge, good Edwańp, disgorge.
Otherwise, when men think of the Christian orator, and the Christian
no-doer-some may crook the finger as thou passest by; some, haply,
hold the nose.”
“Now, Sir, to a man—as my friend BROUGHAM would observe-
much pondering on these things, such exhortations must bring forth
their fruits. I have considered of what this sham Clerk of the Bench
is made of Ihave thought of the composition of this impostor Custos:
and-summing up judgment in my own clear breast; judging them from
the sanctuary of my own conscience—they are the eaters of men's fees,
who, to buy justice, pay the wages of the º of Justice who, but
that she is beneficently made blind, would blush her robes to tinder to
see their doings. -
“In conclusion, Mr. Punch, Ibeg to show myself-socially, and po:
litically—a practical, Christian. It is my intention (may the good
example be followed in a hundred places) to defeat physical force
Chartism by justice. I, for one, will stop the mouth of discontent, by
leaving it no abuse to shout against. . -
“Therefore, herewith I beg to resign my sham Clerkship—my
shadowy Custos. I refuse from this time to be a pensioner on the
working poor; I will not eat the roast and boiled which—but for such
as me—might more frequently appear upon the labourer's table.
“In conclusion, from the present half-year (I wish, I could make the
further sacrifice of aii moneys hitherto received, but that is impossible),
I beg to resign my pension as Clerk-my sinecure as Custos-and thus,
as †. remarked in my speech, assure to myself the enjoyment of
that "heavenly aid” which is the reward o
simplicity of the true Christian.

A POTATO CONSPIRACY.
S. We extract the following important intelligence from the Ballinasloe
far:-
“The dearly-loved potato of the Irish peasantis springing up with seeming health,
and greater luxuriance, and in greater abundance, at this early period of the year, than
wereoollection former-occasions.”
There can be no doubt that this general rising of the potato through-
out Ireland, is solely to bring contempt upon the opinions of the distin-
guished prophets of Parliament and Exeter Hall, who declared that the
potato was for ever destroyed by the Maynooth Grant. As if to com-
plete the case, the Star further informs us, that “Turnips are slowly
making head.” Hence, the heads of the aforesaid prophets are further
threatened with dangerous rivals.

THE MODEL POLICEMAN.
E walks upright, as flexible as
a kitchen poker, his thoughts
and hands quite full—like the
KING OF PRUssia—of his “be-
loved Berlins.” He keeps his
§: straight before him, even
if there is a leg of mutton from
the baker's running the oppo-
site * He rarely looks
lower than the parlour win-
dows, when the servants are
on board wages. . His heart
—unlike himself—is constantly
“on the beat.” His taste for
beauty is only equalled by his
º: for cold beef. He
shows the weakness of his body
by calling DANIEL HARVEY
“WITTLES.”
The MoDEL PolicEMAN
moves only in the most fashion-
able areas. He is rather par-
ticular in seeing if the coal
cellar is fast, about supper
time. He is never inside a kitchen, unless “the street door has been left open.”
He is affable to the footman, and smiles to the page, but suspects the butler,
and calls the French maid “proud.”. His appearance and spirits are greatly
regulated by the neighbourhood. In Belgravia he wears straps, plays with a
ink, and buzzes to himself some popular tune. In St. Giles's his cheeks get
F. ow, his buttons grow rusty, his belt is put on anyhow, and his highlows are
polished only with blacklead! -
The MoDEL PolicEMAN arrives at a row before it is quite over, and sometimes
gets at a fire a minute or two before the fire-escape. He knows every pick-
pocket in the world, and has seen everybody who is taken up two or three
times before... He has a vivid recollection of what another Policeman remembers,
and if the testimony of an Inspector is * he shows a great love for his
cloth by swearing (as the saying is) “till all is blue.” He objects to “plain

clothes;” he thinks them not uniform, and “unperfessional.” He never smiles
when inside a theatre, nor sleeps at a sermon, nor takes an opera-glass to look
at the ballet when stationed in the ſº of Her Majesty’s.
He rarely releases the wrong person he has taken into custody
for disturbing the performances. He has a virtuous horror of
Punch and Judy, and insists upon the Indiarubber Brothers
“moving on,” in the midst even of the Human Pyramid. He
never stops at a print-shop, nor loiters before a cook-shop,
nor hangs about a pastrycook's, excepting to drive away
the little boys who choke up the door where the stale pastry
is exhibited.
He is not proud, but will hold a gentleman's horse at
an emergency, and take sixpence for it. . He rings bells
the first thing in the morning, runs to fetch the doctor,
helps an early coffee-stall to unpack her cups and saucers,
pulls down shutters, gives “lights” to young º stag-

not even mind going in with them, “just to have a little

MoDEL PolicEMAN does anything for the smallest trifle, to
make himself useful as well as ornamental. Above all, he never
laughs. He is the terror of publicans on Saturday nights, but
is easily melted with “a drop”—on the sly.
He is courageous, also, and will take up an applewoman, or
a “lone woman” with babies, without a moment's hesitation.
He is not irritable, but knows his dignity. Do not speak to
him much, unless you have avery good coat. Especially do not
joke with him when on duty. You are sure to know it by
his collar being up. Do not put a finger upon him, for he con-
strues it into an assault. Of the two Forces, he certainly
belongs to the Physical, rather than to the Moral Force. He
is tremendous in a row, and cares no more for a “brush” than
his oilskin hat. . He hates the name of Chartist, and cannot
“abide” a Frenchman in any shape, any more than a beggar,
especially if he has moustaches. He has a secret contempt
for the “Specials,” whom he calls “amateurs.” He y
fraternises with a Beadle, excepting when there is an insur-
rection of boys, and it comes to open snowballing, or splashing
with the fire-plug. He prohibits all sliding, puts down vaulting
over posts, º: grottos, chuckfarthing, and is terribly upset
with a piece of orange-peel, or the cry of “Peeler.” He avoids
a lobster-shop, for fear of vulgar comparisons, and hates the
military—‘‘the whole, biling of ‘em.”—for some raw reason;
but he touches his hat to “the DUKE.. He rarely, sleeps
inside a cab of a cold night. . He never lights a cigar till the

page is a hackney-coach gallop, even after a Sweep, who is
following, too literally, his calling. He is meektolost children,
and takes them to the station-house in the most fatherly
Inanner.
He is polite to elderly ladies who have lost a cat or
a parrot, and gives, directions to a porter in Otº a
particular street, without losing his temper. He is fond of
a silver watch, and he reaches the summit of a policeman's
pride and happiness if he gets a silver chain with it.. Next
to himself, however, there is nothing he loves half so closely
as his whiskers. He would sooner throw up staff, station, and
be numbered, amongst the dead letters of #. Post Office, or
the rural police, than part with a single hair of them; for the
MoDEL PolicEMAN feels that without his whiskers he should
cut but a contemptible figure in the eyes of those he loves,
even though he exhibited on his collar the proud label of Ali
Beyond his whiskers, his enjoyments are but few. He watches
the beer as it is delivered at each door, he follows the silvery
sound of “muffins!” through streets and squares, he loves to
speculate upon the destination of the fleeting butcher's tray,
and on Saturday night he threads the mazy stalls of the
nearest market, his love growing at the sight of the things it
is wont to feed on.
His principal amusement is to peep through the keyhole
of a street-door, at night with his bull's eye—especially if
any one is looking at him. . This is the great difficulty,
however, for the policeman's clothes are of that deep, “Invi.
sible Blue” that persons have lived for years in London
without seeing one. This is the reason, probably, when he is
seen, that he throws so much light upon himself, as if the
creature wished to engrave the fact of his curiosity strongly
upon the recollection of the startled beholder by means of
the most powerful illumination. Without some such proof, the
incredulous world would never believe in the existence of a

“My DARLING, will you TAKE A LITTLE of THE-A—THE STUFFING !”
“I will, DEAR, If You Do ; but IF You Don't, I won't.”
JENKINS AT DRURY LANE.
The spirit of JENKINs is not extinguished. Certainly not. It always wakes and shakes
itself with the occasion. For instance, JENKINs visited Drury Lane last week, and having
chronicled the “desecration of the classic temple where GARRICK, KEMBLE, SIDDoss, KEAN
and GRIMALDI trod and tumbled,” again faded in moonshine. Here, however, is the old
accustomed Jenkinsonian touch., JENKINs speaks of the most earnest rioters. (For further
paſſiculars of some of them see the Old Bailey).
“Some of the most earnest shouted “ Britons, be bricks!" and “Britons, support the British Dramal' and
various other patriotic cries. Then came the National Anthem, sang capitally by a majority of the audience.”
Nothing could be more apposite, more significant, than the frequent execution of “God
save the QUEEN” during º: Monte Cristo riot. , HER MAJESTY, always having set the
royal countenance against the undue encouragement of the foreign Pº to the neglect
of the English Stage, had the noblest right to the frequent bellowing of the National Anthem.
It served as at once a compliment to the QUEEN and as a warning to the brick-like Britons.
However, let JENKINs proceed with his history:-
“All then was hushed in grim silence; but the lull was threatening in its aspect, and foretold the
coming storm; and no sooner did the curtain rise, than one burst of indignation was yelled forth, sufficient
to fright the Isle from its propriety. . Up stood the Gallic Cocks, and crowed with might and main, and
shook their dingy wings; but the roaring of the British Lion, and his determined front, were not thus to
be put down.”
We have been kindly favoured by JENKINs himself with a portrait, of Cock and of Lion
#: and # must be acknowledged that they are wonderfully faithful—crowing and roaring
enesses .
FLIGHT OF GENIUs—Two or three of the DeMostRENEs of the mob have been proving
that they are far º: the Specials in some respects; for there is no shutting one's eyes to
the clevemess they have recently shown in outrunning the consºle.

*-
THEY SHOULD REFLECT, BUT THEY
WONPT.
We quote the following, for the benefit of
gentlemen at the Bar. It is MR, BARox PARKE
who is speaking, in the Court of Exchequer.
“It was a great injustice to suitors that learned gentle-
men should be absent when their services were required.
They should reflect, when they accepted briefs, whether
they would be able to discharge the duties they owed
their clients.”
If a person obtains money under false pre-
tences, he is indicted, but a barrister may take as
many fees as he likes under the falsest pretences,
and not be accountable for a single one! Worse
than this, the suitor may be ruined by the non-
attendance of his counsel, and the only remedy
the poor man has, is the consolation of knowing
that the barrister was defending a case in some
other Court! A similar fraud would take a
tradesman to the Old Bailey; but a barrister
apparently has a license to steal to any amount
he pleases. The days of highwaymen are not
quite over. We could point to many a Dick
TURPIN in our law Courts, who, holding a brief,
instead of a pistol, to a person's head, rifles him
with all the gentility in the world, of his money.
The wonder is, that the cry is not raised of
“Stop thief!” And yet the Bar is called one of
the literal professions. We are afraid that the
liberality is “all for themselves,” and that the
ruined client gets none of it. We recommend
counsel to put at the bottom of their briefs, as is
done with the playbills, the truthful announce-
ment, “No money returned.” It will save a
deal of disappointment, which must be very
annoying to the profession.
THE STEPS OF THE SEDITIONISTS.
ONE of our contemporaries, in speaking of
the gatherings of the "Bonner's Fields Raga-
muffins, describes them as “bootless and irregu-
far.” We can answer for them being not only
“bootless,” but to a certain extent “shoeless;”
and under these circumstances we are not sur-
prised that they cannot place themselves upon a
respectable footing. A report that one of the
orators came to a recent meeting in a Clarence,
would seem to indicate that he drove up in his
private carriage; but onfurtherinquiry, we ascer-
tained that the individual in question did not ride
to the ground in a Clarence, but walked thither
in a pair of Clarences. These articles had been
purchased by him as “warranted men's stout,”
and he had had extra nails driven into the soles,
to make them more effective in trampling under
foot the crown, the cabinet, the sceptre, the
throne, the ministry, the middle classes, and every-
thing else that our native rivals of the indians
at the Egyptian Hall are disposed to dance upon.
A Dilemma.
IN_consequence of the ill-treatment, which
SIR. H. Bulwer experienced from the Spanish
Government, ours retaliates upon that of Madrid
by depriving it of a resident English Minister.
W; MR. H.
HUME, or some other gentleman,
have the kindness to tell Mr. Punch which is
supposed to be the country that, in this case, is
made to suffer? Is it Spain, or is it this country?
If none but a first-class ambassador can trans-
act our affairs in Spain, why send a second chop
representative? It is injuring ourselves to spite
our neighbours. If, on the contrary, a second-
class man will do the work just as well as the
greatest and best paid grandee that ever wore
stars and garters, why not always employ
second-class men, and save the money?.
An answer, post paid, will oblige.

A LITTLE DINNER AT TIMMINS’s.
THE cards for dinner having been issued, it became the # of º
TIMMINs to make further arrangements respecting the invitations
the tea-party which was to follow the more substantial meal.
These arrangements are difficult, as any lady knows who is in the
habit of entertaining her friends. There are-
People who are offended if you ask them to tea whilst others have
been asked to dinner—
People who are offended if you ask them to tea at all; and cry out
furiously, “Good Heavens! JANE, my love, why do these TIMMINses
suppose that I am to leave my dinner-table to attend their—soirée º'
(the dear reader may fill up the – to any strength, according to his
liking)--or, “Upon my word, WILLIAM, my dear, it is too much toaskus
to pay twelve shillings for a Brougham, and to spend I don't know how
much in gloves, just to make our curtsies in MRs. TIMMINs's little
drawing-room.” MRs. Moser made the latter, remark about the
TIMMINs affair, while the former was uttered by MR. GRUMPLEy,
Barrister-at-Law, to his lady, in Gloucester Place.
That there are people who are offended if you don't ask them at all, is
a point which I suppose nobody will question., TIMMINs's earliest
friend in life was SIMMINs, whose wife and family have taken a cottage
at Mortlake for the season.
“We can’t ask them to come out of the country,” Rosa said to her
FITzRoy-(between ourselves, she was delighted that MRs. SIMMINs was
out of the way, and was as jealous of her as every well-regulated woman
should be of her husband's female friends)—we can't ask them to come
so far for the evening.”
“Why no, certainly,” said FITzRoy, who has himself no very great
opinion of a tea-party; and so the SIMMINses were cut out of the list.
And what was the consequence? The consequence was, that SIMMINs
and TIMMINs cut when they meet at Westminster; that MRs. SIMMINs
sent back all, the books which she had borrowed from Rosa, with a
withering note of thanks; that Rosa goes about saying that MRs.
SIMMINs squints; that Mrs. S., on her side, declares that Rosa is
crooked, and behaved shamefully to CAPTAIN HIcks, in marrying
FitzRoy over him, though she was forced to do it by her mother, and
prefers the Captain to her husband to this day. If, in a word, these two
men could be made to º: I believe their wives would not be dis-
pleased; and the reason.o all this * rage, and dissension, lies in
a poor little twopenny dinner-party in Lilliput Street.
Well, the guests, both for before and after meat, having been asked—
old MRs. GASHIEigh, Rosa's mother—(and, by consequence, FitzRoy's
dear mother-in-law, though I promise you that “dear” is particularl
sarcastic)-MRs. GASHLEIGH of course was sent for, and came wit
Miss Eliza GAshLeigh, who plays on the guitar, and EMILY, who
limps a little, but º sweetly on the concertina. They live close by
-trust them for that. Your mother-in-law is always within hearing,
thank our stars for the attentions of the dear woman. The GAshLeighs,
I say, live close by, and came early on the morning after Rosa's notes
had been issued for the dinner.
...When FitzRoy, who was in his little study, which, opens into the
little dining-room-one of those absurd little rooms that ought to be
called a Gentleman's Pantry, and is scarcely bigger than a shower-bath,
or a state cabin in a ship—when FitzRoy heard his mother-in-law’s
knock, and her well-known scuffling and chattering in the passage, in
which she squeezed up young Buttons, the page, while she put
questions to him regarding baby, and the cook's health, and whether
she had taken what MRs. GAshLEIGH had sent over night, and the
housemaid's health, and whether MR. Tim Miss had gone to Chambers
o Fº a dozen more dessert plates; an
or not? and when, after this preliminary chatter, BUTTONs flung open
the door tº: GASHIEIGH, and the young ladies,”
Fitzrºy ſaid down his Times newspaper with an expression that had
best not be printed in a Journal which young people read, and took his
hat and walked away.
MRs. GAshLEIGH has never, liked him since he left off calling her
* and kissing her. But he said he could not stand it any
onger—he was hanged if he would. So he went away to Chambers,
leaving the field clear to Rosa, Mamma, and the two dear girls.
—Or to one of them, rather; for before leaving the house, he thought
he would have a look at little FITzRoy up-stairs in the Nursery, and he
found the child in the hands of his maternal aunt ELIZA, who was
holding him and pinching him as if he had been her guitar, I suppose;
so that the littlefellow bawled pitifully—and his father finally quitted
the premises.
No sooner was he gone, and although, the party was still a fortnight
off, yet the women pounced upon his little Study, and º to put it in
ºrder. Some of his papers they pushed up over the bookcase, some
they put behind the Encyclopædia, some they crammed into the drawers
where MRs. GAshLEigh found three cigars, which she pocketed, and
§: letters, over which she cast her eye; and by Fitz's return they
ad the room as meat as possible, and the best glass and dessert-service
mustered on the study-table. -
It was a very meat and handsome service, as you may be sure
MRs. GAshLeigh thought, whose rich uncle had purchased it for the
young couple, at Srode AND CoPELAND's: but it was only for twelve
rsons.
*f; was agreed that it would be, in all º cheaper and better to
with “my silver basketin
he centre,” MRs. G. said (she is always bragging about that con:
founded bread-basket), “we need not have any extra china dishes, and
the table will look very pretty.”
On making a roll-call of the glass, it was calculated that at least a
dozen or so tumblers, four or five dozen wines, eight water-bottles, and a
proper quantity of ice-plates, were requisite; and that, as they would
always be useful, it would be best to purchase the articles Hº:
FITz tumbled over the basket containing them, which stood in the
as he came in from Chambers, and over the boy who had brought them
—and the little bill. - -- -
The women had had along debate, and something like a quarrel, it
must be owned, over the bill of fare. MRs. GASHIEIGH, who had lived
a great part of her life in Devonshire, and kept house in great state
there, was famous for making some dishes, without which, she thought
no dinner could be perfect. When she proposed her mock-turtle, an
stewed pigeons, and gooseberry-cream, Rosa turned up her nose-a
pretty little nose it was, by the way, and with a natural turn in that
direction.
“Mock-turtle in June, mamma!” she said.
“It was good enough for your grandfather, Rosa,” the mamma
replied; “it was good enough for the Lord High Admiral, when he was
at Plymouth; it was good enough for the first men in the county, and
relished by Loºp ForTyskewer and Lord Rolºs; SIR Lawsºngs
Porker ate twice of it after Exeter Races; and Ithink it might be
good enough for”—
“I will not have it, mamma!” said Rosa, with a stamp of her foot-
and MRs. GASHIEigh knew what resolution there was in that; once,
when she had tried to physic the baby, there had been a similar fight
between them.
So MRs. GAshLEIGH made out a carte, in which the soup was left
with a dash—a melancholy vacuum; and in which the pigeons were
certainly thrust in amongst the entrées; but Rosa determined they never
should make an entrée at all into her dinner-party, but that she would
have the dinner her own way. - -
When Fitz returned, then, and after he had º the little bill of
£6.14s. 6d. for the glass, Rosa flew to him with her sweetest smiles,
and the baby in her arms. And after she had made him remark how
the child grew every day more and more like him, and after she had
treated him to a number of compliments and caresses, which, it were
positively fulsome to exhibit in public, and after she had soothed him
into good humour by her artless tenderness, she began to speak to him
about some little points which she had at heart. - -
She pointed out with a sigh how shabby the old curtains looked since
the dear new glasses which her darling Fitz had given her had been put
up in the drawing-room. Muslim curtains cost nothing, and she must
and would have them.
The muslim curtains were accorded. She and Fitz went and bought
them at Shool BRED's, when you may be sure she treated herself like-
wise to a neat, sweet, pretty half-mourning (for the Court, you know,
is in mourning)—a meat sweet barège, or calimanco, or bombazine, or
tiffany, or some such thing; but MADAME CAMILLE of Regent Street
made it up, and Rosa looked like an angel in it on the night of her
little dinner. - -
. “And my sweet,” she continued, after the curtains had been given
in, “Mamma and I have been talking about the dinner. She wants to
make it very expensive, which I cannot allow. I have been thinking of

Fitz agreed to speak to MossIEUR MIRoBoLANT. If Rosa had had
a fancy for the cook of the Prime Minister, I believe the deluded
creature of a husband would have asked Loºp join for the loan of him.

thousand poor Frenchmen. The subject we have to propose is the
Grand Allegory of the Catspaw, in which Lond PALMERston should
represent the Monkey, using the hand, or rather, the paw, of SIR

the awkward operation of burning his fingers by meddling with the

WHO IS DAT KNOCKING AT DE DOOR 2
A Nigger Melody, to be Sung by LoRD JoHN RUSSELL in the character of
an Ethiopian Serenader.
I HAD just been having a little bit of spree,
And saying, “For Reform no demand there can be; ”
I’d come from the House and had just gone to bed,
When from Downing Street window. I pok'd out my head:
Dere was some one knocking at de door.
“Who is dat knºcking t de door?
“Am,dat you, Bob?”—“No, it am JoE.”
“Well: you ain't good looking, and you’d better go;
And dere’s no use knocking at de door any more, .
Dere’s no use knocking at de door.”,
“Who is dat knocking at de door,
Making such a noise with his lib’ral jaw P
I’ll at de House, and tell 'em as how
You only want to kick up a row.
Am dat you, Joe P’”—“No, it am DICK.”
Spoken. “What! Dick CoBDEN ?”—“Yes, DICK CoRDEN, who gave
you such a lift with the corn, that might have been too much for you.”
“Well! he arn’t good looking, and he can’t come in.” .
Den dey knock at de door with a precious din,
And at last they completely force it in.
In came Reformers, one, two, three, -
Saying, “Come, Nigger RusseII, you must wid me.”
“Who is dat knocking at de door?
Who is dat knocking at de door?
Am dat you, JoE’”—“No, it am BoB;
He’s the only fellow that can do the job.”
They took me to de Commons, and I stay all night;
Ineber sleep a wink, though in sleep I delight; I
My trance they break, and my rivals crow
To see my slumbers broken by #. old JoE.
'Twas he came knocking at de door;
He keeps on knocking at de door.
“Is dat you, BEN ?”—“No, it am Joe.”
“Well, you can’t come in; so away you’d better go.”ul

LE THéâTRE HISTORIQUE AT DRURY LANE.
UNNING over with cos-
mopolitan, benevolence,
Punch visited Drury
Lane on the occasion of
that theatre commencing
its fourth season within
eight months, under
Mons. JULLIEN's man-
agement, It began as a
Turkish Tent in October,
it became a grand Opera
House before Christmas
and ere March had found
its ides, it had lost its
identity by conversion
: into an arena for horse-
manship. FRANCONI
strutted where KEAN
had trod, and AURIOL
shrieked La, la / on the
very spot once devoted
to the La, la, la / of our
PATONs,ourSTEPHENSEs,
our TREEs, and our
BRAHAMs. Horses pranced, where VEDY had capered, and grooms
occupied the ground! once filled with a º dramatic peasantry at
eighteen-pence per night, or a stalwart ban of chorus-singing ca-
rousers, culled from the very flower of British basses and baritones.
Every sort of desecration and degradation had been yisited ºn poor
Drury Lane, and it had even been made an accessory before the fact
in the circulation of the engravings of the Art-Union; but even this
humiliation had been permitted. It had been suffered to lend its
agency in sending home the murderous steel to the public, in the shape
; wretched prints that carried with them, their own proofs of worth-
lessness. Having seen all this, we fancied that such a minor offence
as bringing the Company of one of the lesser Parisian theatrº to Drury
Lane would have been passed over as a comparatively trifling delingºency.
After various announcements and postponementº, onte Cristo was
positively advertised as "A Grand Drama in Ten Acts, occupying two
evenings in its performance.”. There had been a difficulty about the
licence, for the Lord Chamberlain had been compelled to get one of
our British dramatists, on whom a portion of the paletof of PLANCHE
is supposed to have fallen, to translate the Dram for the purpose of
having all the blasphemy and sedition taken out of it. . This operation
was a good deal like gutting a house; extracting the jam from a jam
tart; separating the meat from the sandwich; depriving the Surrey
seaman of his hornpipe and his ducks; or leaving out all the venom from
a speech of MR. BERJAMIN DISRAELI. Monte Cristo was ºf:
reduced to such a mere skeleton, that the licenser could not find a
single bone to pick with it. - - - -
§. began to wonder how two nights could possibly be occupied with
such an attenuated affair; and we º that even if there were too
much for one night, there would never be enough for two, in the paltry
trash that was about to be presented to the British public as a dra-
matic repast for a couple of evenings. We had heard there was tº be
an opposition from the British dramatists; but, as, we, knew that
compact little body could not by possibility spread itself into anything
beyond a single private box, we did not apprehend much disturbance
from that quarter. "We knew, moreover, that even if the .
wrights were to congregate, though they might be numerous...nough,
they would never be so ungrateful as to go and quarrel with their
bread-and-butter, by evincing hostility towards a French melodrama.
It would be something like suicide on the part of these º
to hiss a production of the Parisian stage, and we knew they woul
go and see a French play with all the yeneration and respect that a
child would feel for the author of its existence. - -
No sooner had the doors opened, and the French musicians taken
their places in the orchestra, than those great engines of public opinion,
the catcall and the whistle, began to exert their influence. That
astounding reasoner, the street-door key, acted upon as it was by all
the force of ſervid flatulence, silenced everything in the shape of
argument on the other side; and, if AEolus had taken the first row.of
the pit for himself and friends, he could not have dealt out heavier
blows than were puffed forth from the lungs of a generous, British
audience. In vain did the band attempt to abate the storm by throwing
the oil of God Save the Queen on the troubled waters. xx
At length, after a dumb overture, of which “not a drum was heard,
the curtain rose upon the deck of the Pharaoh, and the vessel encoun-
tered such astorm as its crew had not looked for. There was pantomime
on the stage met by opposition pantomime among the audience; fists
were shaken from box to box; hands were laid upon hearts; umbrellas
were hoisted; handkerchiefs and shawls were waved; orange-peel was
hurled upon the stage; and amidst all this din, the actors were going
through their parts as if they had been playing before a perfectly
attentive audience. At one time an old man came tottering on to
the stage, when he was pounced upon by one of the other actors, and
affectionately, mauled, after the usual French fashion—an incident
which, on reference to the printed Programme, we found to be “the
tender and affecting meeting of Edmond and his father.” In another
scene, a member of the corps dramatique began to skip about with frantic
energy, which at first we thought betokened the sudden loss of the
actor's senses at the uncourteousness of his reception; but the Argu-
ment informed us that, it was merely Mercedes rendered “wild with
joy” at the arrival of Edmond.
In a subsequent scene two of the principal characters were crawling
about a dungeon, and occasionally getting under an old bedstead, upon
which they ultimately sat down in a § very earnest conversation,
in the course of which we are told “Ilantes learns from Faria, who has
a profound knowledge of the human heart, the probable motives of his
incarceration.” We must have had a very profound knowledge of the
human countenance if we could have gathered this fact from the looks
of the two individuals sitting téte-à-tête at the back of the stage, and
“looking unutterable things,” or uttering inaudible things while
perched on a practicable bedstead. . When it came to a discussion of
“probable motives,” we thought it high time to retire, and accordingly,
giving the thing º as a hopeless affair, we left the theatre.
In the course of the evening, JULLIEN came forward and went
through a series of contortions of the most extraordinary character.
He pulled half-a-crown out of his pocket, rammed his finger down his
throat, pointed up to the chandelier, cast his eyes, down the hole
through which the foot-lights are drawn up, and set his lips in motion
at a fearful rate for five minutes together. "What he meant by all these
displays of physical force, it is impossible to tell; but we could see
that emotion shook his whiskers to their very roots, and that passion
gave fearful activity to his eye-balls. His nose quivered to its very
centre, and the colour turned to ashes on his lip; but not a single
syllable was heard, nor would there have been had he possessed the
power of one of his own monster ophycleides. , Monte Cristo may
well take two evenings in the representation, when so little progress
is made in the course of one performance. Those who may have gone
this week to see the second part, will know quite as much of the matter
as those who witnessed the first, and the interest will be equal for all,
whether they did or did not form part of the first audience.
A Matter of Course.
AT, a Meeting at the Literary Institution, Leicester Square, on the
Health of Towns Measure, Doctor GAVIN said—
“To Doctor Southwoop. SMITH was due the merit of having originated the
present sanitary movement.”
This fact is made emphatically evident by the neglectful manner in
which Doctor SMITH has been treated by the Government. The
“originator” of a great public benefit is of course the one especial
person to be overlooked, when through his energy—and Doctor SMITH
has devoted means, time, and the greater treasure, health—the benefit
is accomplished. All the appointments are made; yet do we in vain
seek among them for the name of DocToR SouTHwood SMITH. This is
a most disgraceful erratum to the Whig Cabinet.
THE CHISWICK FLOWER SHOW.
THE Horticultural Fête of the 10th of June was one continual shower:
bath, to which the elements, with their accustomed liberality, afforded
their gratuitous contributions. Having heard, probably, of cheap baths
and washhouses for the poor, the reigning Powers thought that the rich
might have no objection to the same luxury. The band played several
quadrilles, as usual, but La Poule, in consequence of the puddles, was
the only figure that seemed appropriate. One of our contemporaries
says that the showers gave a refreshing greenness to the aspect of the
plants; but the greenness of the sprigs of fashion, who had come out
upon the occasion, was, we should think, more striking than the viridity
of the foliage.
Special Dramatic Constables.
THE feeling of indignation at the late invasion of the French actors
is very strong indeed among the English translators. Many of the
Members of the Dramatic Authors' Society have sworn themselves in
as Special Constables, to take up every French subject directly the
said subject shall appear.

CERTAINLY Old AquaRIUs is the most loyal subject in HER
MAJESTY's dominions. We imagine he keeps a shower-bath ready for
every disorderly meeting, and directly he sees the pickpockets assemble,
flop! he pulls the string, and down falls the jolly rain, carrying deso-
lation, colds, and rheumatism everywhere. -
The Seditionists, too, should like old AQUARIUs. He cools their
ardour, and keeps them out of rows, in which the only glory to beº:
is a broken head. He has always a “drop” at their disposal, and
sprinkles discretion on their turbulent heat. Lately, he has been the
Mob's Best Friend, and has snatched many a red-hot FUSSELL out of
the fire, which the military have orders always to keep ready for those
who are determined to stir up the embers of sedition.
The Propagandists, also, should be thankful to MonsLEURAQUARIUs;
for, has he not supplied the water in º: Square, which has given
them a gratuitous washing, when they stood on the brink of a harsher
treatment? A little water did them all the good in the world, especially
with the towelling they afterwards received, and has prevented them
getting out of their depth by dabbling in the troubled waters of anarchy
and French revolution. -
The Government should be grateful as well to our peace-loving
AQUARIus; for he is without doubt the most faithful Special Constable
that can be found in England. He has only to raise his bucket, and
hundreds disperse. His staff must be a barometer that always points
to wet. Might we ask him, as an additional favour, to get the public
meetings always appointed in Vauxhall Gardens—his hereditary pro-
perty—ſor then we should care no more for a public demonstration
than we do for a Grand Gala night, or 40,000 additional lamps. The
result must inevitably end in rain, and lots of it! -
We vote that a .# testimonial be got up to AQUARIUS. The best
form for it to take would be a tremendous Pump, the spouts to consist
of portraits of the most distinguished orators: the longest spouter to
be, of course, MR. FEARGUs O'ConnoR.
A Difficult Move.
THE Suffolk Chronicle gives us the particulars of how a house was
moved º quite entire and uninjured, at Ipswich. It seems
it was done by mechanical means, and greased timber. The same
parties should be, invited to come up to London to move the House of
Commons; though, probably, it would defy the best machinery in the
country, as long as LORD John is inside it, and opposes every popular
movement. We warn him to give way, or else the House, when it is
moved, will be brought about, his ears in such a manner that he will
regret not having one of the above greased timbers to enable him (as
JENKINS, in his rose-water diction would say), to “cut his stick upon.”
ERNEST JONES's LockeR.—Newgate.
THE AQUATIC F#TE AT CHISWICK.
Most of the Plants were not enumerated at the last Horticultural
Show. We suppose the heaviness of the rain blinded the eyes of the
reporters. We repair the showery omission. Amongst those which
excited the most attention were—.
HE DRooPING LILy—a beautiful specimen, carried off by Miss
MONTAGUE, of Tavistock Square. - -
THE AQUATIg Rose.--The colours at first were very vivid, but
towards noon they faded terribly, *f; it is supposed, to too much
water. The head was surmounted by lovely flowers of a beautiful
feathery texture, of several colours; but they drooped too much, and
ultimately broke, though a parasol was carefully held over them all the

HE WATERY BLUE BELLE –Cultivated by Miss WATERs, of Peck-
ham. A yery slender plant, almost too delicate for the open air. The
hues, which were of a delicious cerulean sickly nuance, soon went,
though º wrapt up in a thick mackintosh covering, which an
officer had kindly thrown over the beautiful flower to protect it from
the pelting shower.
THE WEEPING WILLow.—Carried off by MRs. A’WHOPPER, of
Buttercup Lodge, Fulham: the exterior very exceedingly, showy, and
the proportions very large. The upper part was white, s *...;
with streaks of red, of a bright rouge complexion; but the beauty of
this soon disappeared, for after the first shower there was scarcely a
trace of it left. This plant was very heavy, and required the assistance
of two strong footmen to lift it out of the carriage. Towards the after-
drops of cherry-brandy, after which it revived a little, and kept up its
head with refreshed vigour.
There were some most curious parasite º such as the OLD MAN,
brought from the Oriental Club, who in the rain looked greener than
ever, and would, cling to the ladies' dresses; and the Sweet WILLIAM,
reared in the Albany—that rare outhouse for fast plants—and that kept
annoying the ladies terribly, till it was obliged to be cut, and ultimately
carried out on a wheelbarrow from the place. -
The fête .# gave the greatest satisfaction to those who are
fond of the good old aquatic sports of England; and it is supposed that
the Society cleared off their property the following day
253 buckets of rain-water. The Gardens had never
perfect bumper.

NO FOREIGN ARTISTS 1
THE same spirit of hostility against foreigners burst out last Monday
week, at Greenwich Fair as well as at Drury Lane. When the Ghost at
orange-peel and loud cries of “Off! Off!” It seems that the rumour
had been industriously spread, by agents of Scowton, that the Ghost
at RICHARDson's was a Frenchman. However, proof to the contrary
was soon given, by his º, forward, and, in very good Irish,
“intrating the indulgence of a British audience, which had never been
denied to a British Ghost before.” This quelled the rising storm, and
he was allowed to point to Don Ferdinando as his murderer, and to
descend with him quietly below, without any further interruption. The
curtain fell amidst the most prodigal display of blue fire that has been
known for years.
The Sapient Pig, Toby would have fallen a martyr, likewise, to the
same prejudice, only he had the presence of mind to hang outside
his booth a certificate from his medical attendant (an eminent. pork-
butcher), testifying that he was “no cochon, or German, or I or
Chinese Pig, but a genuine, native of Hampshire.” In consequence of
this H. the “spell” of his performance was not broken once,
and he escaped being prematurely hurried into that land of black
puddings, from which no pig was ever known to return.
THE FIVE SOUS BANQUET.
We must beg leave, to dispute with our Parisian neighbours the
originality of the Republican idea of giving five, sous banquets to the
populace. The notion is evidently copied from the once popular CANN
of St. Giles's, who obtained considerable renown a few years ago, by
...; to the public what, in the emphatic language of his own
lacards, he designated “a devilish good dinner for twopence-halfpenny.”
his repas diabolique consisted—if our memory does not betray us...?
a terrific mess, which CANN energetically termed “a jorum,” of little
bits of beef, saturated in a pint of water surrounding a large tract of
potato, which swam about like a floating island in the middle. This
was served out in a basin, and has evidently formed the basis of the
five sous banquets. It is not improbable that LoRD BRough AM, whose
establishment in France goes by the name of CANNES, may have
imported the idea into the country of his adoption.

RICHARDson's came on, as usual, in the fifth act, he was received with
