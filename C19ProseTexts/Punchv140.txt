THE ORATOR TO HIS TUB.
[A Rejected Candidate, after seeking temporary oblivion in the orgies
of the season, turns his thoughts to one who did him faithful service in
the late campaign.]
DoNE are the days when you used to accompany
Me, while I bumped you and banged you about;
Never again shall I hammer and thump any
Barrel whose sides are so solid and stout.
Scattered the hustlers and hecklers—so sly a tribe,
Armed with the frail and ubiquitous egg,
Making the orator skip to his diatribe,
Dancing a two-step on top of his keg.
Dead is the contest, and I, your Diogenes,
Seeking again my legitimate trade,
Gratefully send you, my barrel, to lodge in ease
Up in the tool-house with mattock and spade.
There may you lie like a veteran “warrior
Taking his rest,” while I, full of the past,
Wonder if, after the fight, you are sorry or
Glad you have won to a haven at last.
Have you a wish even now to be at it? You'd
Still wish to hector and fluster and rage,
Mouthing the sesquipedalian platitude,
Pessimist, patriot, prophet, and sage?
Harping again on the wrong and the right of it—
Language and libel and laughter and lies—
Making, as folks say, no end of a night of it,
Spouting unspeakable swank to the skies?
No! I had rather (if one quite so far gone ought
Ever to preach to a comrade in crime)
See you a sort of a voluble Argonaut,
Telling brave tales of an alien clime;
Spinning your yarns to the tool-house habitué–
Lawn-mowers hang on each word that you say!—
Pleased with your lot, while your hearers admit you a
Regular dog of a tub in your day!
- But, if it's otherwise, this be your nemesis:–
Oaths I have taken of terrible strength
(Time that I ended! It seems that my MS. is
Running to quite an inordinate length)
Never to rise in forensic apparel and
Roar through the night the eternal refrain;
Never to squat on the top of a barrel and
Never to take to tub-thumping again!

2 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 4, 1911.
A HOLT FROM THE BLUE.
THE recent Elections, which served
to tide The Daily Mail over the inter-
val between the two most thrilling
events of the century—the CRIPPEN
case and Mr. Holt's trip to Washing-
ton—have sunk into their proper insig-
nificance, and the universal topic of
conversation during the festivities of
Christmas and the New Year has
been that stupendous achievement
of The Mail's representative which
marks a new epoch in the History of
Travel.
While yet this World-feat, whose
memory we shall not willingly allow to
die, is fresh on the lips of every lover of
England, let us fix in our minds its fas-
cinating details. At noon on Decem-
ber 10 Mr. Holt, whose greatness was
still only in the stage of promise, left
Euston. Later in the day he stepped
on board the Mauretania bound for
New York, and never once quitted the
leviathan till the passage was completed.
Thus early in this historic adventure he
proved that he was not the kind of
man to relinquish his quest in mid-
Ocean.
Alighting on earth at Jersey City,
he entered a train which carried him
to Washington. Here he shook hands
with several people, and then returned,
with brief stoppages at Baltimore and
Philadelphia, shaking hands as he went
along. Throughout his triumphant pro-
gress he showed the same relentless
tenacity of purpose which characterised
his nautical effort. Never once did he
suffer his car to be side-tracked from
its course.
On arriving at New York his quick
eye at once took in the characteristic
sky-scraper; and next afternoon, after
a tedious delay of nearly twenty-four
hours, he again embarked on the Maure-
tania amid loud clicks of the camera,
having snatched from the Western
hemisphere that Record for Hustle of
which the possession had hitherto
been the envy and admiration of
the Globe. A new fillip was thus given
to the failing life-blood of the Old
World.
Meanwhile let us not forget the part
played in this moving drama by the
Mauretania herself, for, after all, she
was the instrument, however humble,
without which the achievement of Mr.
Holt might never have been realised.
While our hero had been sitting in
trains and shaking hands and taking
notes of local phenomena, the leviathan
had not been idle. She had actually
turned round within a day and a half–
a performance for which five days is
the customary minimum allowance.
On the homeward voyage—executed
in one piece without a break — Mr.
Holt was the cynosure of half-a-dozen
different decks. Even Americans ad-
mitted that he had proved himself the
equal of PEARY in daring and en-
durance, while in point of pace he had
easily eclipsed the Polar veteran.
Landing at Fishguard, Mr. HolT
proceeded to London by a non-stopping
train, and reached The Daily Mail
office at 3.39 A.M. on December 23,
having completed some 7,000 miles in
12 days 15 hours 39 minutes, at an
average speed equal to, if not sur-
passing, that of the best suburban
trains on the South-Eastern Railway.
Mr. Holt shows singularly few signs
of the awful strain which he must have
undergone, especially during the ten
days at sea, where he had to face the
terrible rigours of modern life on a
floating Ritz. His three-quarter-figure
photograph covered some twenty-three
square inches in The Daily Mail two
days after his unparalleled exertions in
the United States, but after his return
he occupied the same space, in the same
paper, with his mere head and shoulders.
His face is now a household joy in
a million happy British homes; and
his tremendous feat is the object of
veneration among five times as many
people as are served by any penny
London morning paper.
From the meagre seven columns
which Mr. Holt was allowed in The
Daily Mail for the story of his im-
pressions as an explorer, one tries to
visualise his personality. Foraman who
had proved himself possessed of such
adamantine resolution, the glimpses of
his character which may be culled from
his articles seem strangely elusive.
But it was easy to recognise the
modesty which came unspoilt out of
a triumph that might well have turned
the head of a smaller hero. It is true
that some of his statements (as, for
instance: “I broke the record between
New York and Washington; I broke
the record between Fishguard and Pad-
dington’’) might appear to be tinged
by egoism; but, after all, to have dis-
tributed the credit among the minor
performers — obscure engine - drivers,
stokers, traffic-managers, etc.—would
have been the merest pedantry and
affectation.
To illustrate his impression of the
Mauretania's outward voyage, I notice
that he quotes these lines:—
“When descends on the Atlantic
The gigantic
Storm-wind of the Equinox."
The word “Equinox" throws a fresh
light upon the blind courage of this
intrepid passenger. If he really sup:
posed that mid-December is the usual
period for the Equinoctial gales this
reveals an elemental inexperience of
the natural laws governing our planet
which adds, if possible, a new touch
of bravado to the astounding contempt
of danger displayed in this maritime
achievement.
If England occupies to-day a higher
place in the estimation of all true
Americans than she has held since the
days of the Pilgrim Fathers, she owes it
to her Holt. He has made History,
as History can never have been made
before. O. S.
GHOSTS OF PAPER.
SHOULD you go down Ludgate Hill,
As I'm sure you sometimes will,”
When the dark comes soft and new,
Smudged and smooth and powder-blue,
And the lights on either hand
Run away to reach the Strand;
And the winter rains that stream
Make the pavements glance and gleam ;
There you'll see the wet roofs rise
Packed against the lamp-lit skies,
And at once you shall look down
Into an enchanted town.
Jewelled Fleet Street, golden gay,
Sloughs the drab of work-a-day,
Conjuring before you then
All her ghosts of ink and pen,
Striking from her magic mint
Places you have loved in print,
From the fairy towns and streets
Raised by Djinn and fierce Afreets,
To the columned brass that shone
On the gates of Babylon;
You shall wander, mazed, amid
Pylon, palm, and pyramid;
You shall see, where taxis throng,
River lamps of old Hong Kong;
See the ramparts standing tall
Of the wondrous Tartar Wall;
See, despite of rain and wind,
Marble towns of rosy Ind,
And the domes and palaces
Crowning Tripolis and Fez;
While, where buses churn and splash,
There's the ripple of a sash,
Silken maid and paper fan
And the peach-bloom of Japan;
But, the finest thing of all,
You shall ride a charger tall
Into huddled towns that haunt
Picture-books of old Romaunt,
Where go squire and knight and saint,
Heavy limned in golden paint :
You shall ride above the crowd
On a courser pacing proud,
In fit panoply and meet
Through be-cobbled square and street,
Where with bays and gestures bland
Little brown-faced angels stand 1
º: º: -- *
These are some of things you'll view
When the night is blurred and blue,
If you look down Ludgate Hill,
As I'm sure you often will !

OUR SEASONABLE SYMPOSIUM.
WHEN there is nothing much happen-
ing the complete editor does his best to
get his paper written (free) by illustrious
persons. There is never less doing
than in Christmas and New Year
weeks, hence the following columns of
negligible matter. We have sent a
circular to a number of well-known
men and women requesting their
answer to the question, “Are Christ-
mas presents and New Year gifts worth
all the trouble of thanking people for
them?” A selection of replies will be
found below.
Mr. Asquith writes: “A Christmas
present of a majority of 126 is worth
any trouble.”
Mr. BIRRELL writes: “Your question
leads to another. What should one
say when, instead of receiving a present
at Christmas, one has one's property
abstracted ? Here there is doubtless
considerable choice of expressions.
Personally, I am very glad to see 1911
and get out of a year which assisted
me to a strained leg and the companion-
ship of such attentive cross-Channel
thieves.”
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD writes: “I
am too busy with my new Cornhill
serial, The Case of Richard Meynell, to
be able to accede to your request.”
“Mrs. MEYNELL writes: “I would'palette scrapings, how could one's
reply at once were I not so immersed
in my critical study of ARTEMUs WARD
and his English kith and kin.”
Mr. A. C. BENSON writes: “The
query is a deep one leading to profound
meditation. In some—I am glad to
say rare—moments of pessimism I
might be disposed to answer in the
negative. This is when I find my
Christmas breakfast-table covered with
votive offerings from my myriad
readers while I am suffering from
writer's cramp with complications. It
is then that, if I were not so bitterly
opposed to capital punishment, I might
be tempted to exclaim, ‘Hang it!"
But happily my betternature triumphs;
and my mature opinion is that presents
are worth while.”
Mr. Roger FRY writes: “To my
analytical mind it all depends on what
kind of Christmas presents or New
Year's gifts one receives. If, for
example, it is, a canvas by a straight-
forward painter who has brought to
bear on his faithful delineations of
nature all the knowledge of his greatest
predecessors, I shall say certainly not.
It is not worth a thank you. But, on
the other hand, for a naked Tahitian
woman by GAUGUIN, sprawling and
ungainly, and cruder than a ginger-
bread figure, or a frameful of MATIssE's
gratitude find adequate expression?”
Mr. John SMITH writes: “In my
opinion Christmas presents and New
Year gifts are not worth the trouble
of saying thank you for. At least, that
is what I have decided after attempting
to write different replies to the three
persons who have given me paper
knives (of which I had a dozen before).
Next year I shall distribute a printed
form stating that it was “exactly what
I wanted.’”
“PATERFAMILIAs." writes: “I have
not enough gratitude in my body for
the manager of The Times for his
Christmas gift of the classified index
once more. I did not know where I
was during the week or so that he
stopped it.”

“In the birth-throes of the present General
Election there is a rood of possibilities whose
momentum no man can measure."

Eighteen door-keys, a Yale-key, a

THE YEAR’S PROSPECTS.
ALTHOUGH you are still dating your
letters “1910," the fact remains that
we have slipped once again into a New
Year. The change occurred (so re-
morseless is the flight of time) on the
stroke of midnight last Saturday, at a
moment when you were round the
wassail-bowl, and was duly noted by
our lynx-eyed Press. I propose now,
if you are awake, to discuss with you
the coming events, as far as they can
be forecasted, of 1911.
ADVERTISEMENTs.
Most of the advertisements of the
year 1911 will be inspired by Cam-
bridge University. For this reason a
Chair of Literature has recently been
endowed at the famous seat of learn-
ing, the first appointment to it being
that of Mr. Hooper. Mr. Hoop ER's
style is, if anything, more mellow even
than it was in 1903, and it is expected
that with the present year his intel-
lectual powers will reach the extreme
height of their expression. His great
Scholarship scheme will be announced
by the University during 1911. But
you should order your set now.
BUDGETs.
There will be one of these.
CoRONATIONs.
There will be one of these, too. The
actual affair will take less than a day,
but for weeks and weeks beforehand
you will have to read Coronation odes
and Coronation articles. You may as
well begin at once. Mr. Punch's his-
torical pamphlet, containing an ac-
count of the coronation of every
sovereign from Harold Hardshanks to
the present May-Queen of Cricklewood,
will be out to-morrow.
DRAMA.
Many notable additions to dramatic
literature will be made in 1911. Several
entirely new plays will be performed,
whose plots hinge upon the fact that
the sinister Mrs. Dufray is attempting
to blackmail John Sterne by means of
a packet of letters which he had written
to her in a moment of mistaken
enthusiasm. Luckily John gets a
telegram to say that she has died
suddenly on her way to Dover. In the
world of musical comedy the rich and
beautiful Angela will change places with
her maid, thereby evading several
unwelcome proposals.
ELECTIONs.
There will be none of these. This is
a promise. If by any extraordinary
chance there should be one, come to
the office and ask for your money back.
You won't get it, but we shall be glad
to see you. Note the missionary-box
on the left-hand side of the door as
you pass out.
FRENCH.
A lot of French will be spoken in
1911. Hors (concours and d'ouvre),
entre mous, jeu d'esprit, Jupiter Pluvius,
eureka and ben trovato will be among
the most popular remarks of the day.

dulci, or something like that, will be
the 1911 catch-phrase at the music-
halls.
GEORGE (LLOYD).
I had hoped to get through without
referring to this, but I feel that it
would be wrong to pretend that there
will be no mention of him in the 1911
papers. His name is bound to crop up.
Look out for it and see if you can spot
it before your friend does.
HIATUs.
There is going to be a hiatus now,
until we get to L. It is obvious that
I cannot mention all the wonderful
things which are going to take place in
the New Year, and in any case there's
no prospect of anything very exciting
in the I or J line happening in 1911.
KoRONATION.
This is another way of spelling
Coronation. I only just want to re-
mind you that this is the year for it.
LoRDs (OLD).
It will be a memorable year for the
House of Lords. The great battle of
1911 will take its place in the history
books of the future with Hastings and
Waterloo. The broken square of New-
tons, the final rally of the De La Warr
Die-hards, the mad charge of the
Death-or-Glory Midletons to the war-
cry, “A Saye and Sele !”—these will
be subjects for the battle pictures of
to-morrow.
LoRDs (NEw).
But first there will have to be lots
and lots and lots of these—perhaps.
MARQUESSEs.
Even two or three brace of these.
They might just possibly ask you or
me! It is a solemn thought.
NoFL.
It seems too bad to remind you that
we shall be hearing all about this
gentleman again before the year is
over. He will turn up in 1911 all right,
depend upon it. This won't exactly be
a notable feature of the year, but there
will be a good deal of talk about it
later on.
PARENTHESIs.
(I ought to have said before that
Coronations are de riqueur this year.)
REBELLIONs.
The date of the Rebellion in Ulster
has not definitely been settled yet;
but due notice will be sent to all the
papers in time for the early sporting
editions.
STORY (SENSATIONAL, of WEST END
CLUB).
With any luck there will be about
three of these during the year—one
from Soho, and one from Hammer-
smith, and one from Notting Hill.
TUBEs.
Tubes will enter upon an entirely
new era. In future no smoking will be
allowed in the lifts, and the attendants
will see to it that everybody is standing
clear of the gates. The liſt will then
descend, and you will be in time to see
the tail lights of one of those jolly
little trains.
WEATHER.
There will be much too much of this
in 1911. Much too much. However,
we may get a fine Sunday towards the
end of July or August.
X. Y. Z. (or rather, N.B.).
It has been decided that there shall
be a Coronation this year. Don't go
getting the date wrong—1911.

PETER was playing sulkily with an

Margaret threw aside the book she had
just finished reading for the third time
and yawned; Norman searched half-
heartedly for the nib of his new foun-

seeing in the coal-scuttle two days
before; and Joan—Joan, bless her
heart!—was the only happily engaged
one of the lot, for she had discovered a
garment on the chief of the new dolls
which could do with an extra button,
and she was busy attempting to thread
a bodkin.
“D'you suppose father never tells a
lie?” asked Peter, defiantly.
“Of course he tells’em,” said Norman,
bluntly. “Ask Uncle Bob if he doesn't.”
“Norman 1" exclaimed Margaret,
shocked. “Remember that Joan is
here, even if you feel anxious to make
a cruel attack on your own father.”
“What about the attack he made on
me, then 2 ” asked Peter. “Just because
I said it wasn't me that fired the air-
gun through granny's portrait, he jaws
me for half-an-hour about making good
resolutions for the New Year, and then
stops my mince-pies.”
“Peter,” sang Joan, “can I have
your mince - pies what you're not

“Peter's quite right,” said Norman.
“Father gave me ten minutes of it this
morning because I was late for break-
fast, and he was only early himself
because his bedroom clock was fast.”
“Norman, how dare you say such
things?”
“Well, it 's the truth, and he's told
Peter to speak the truth, so there can't
be much wrong in me speaking the
truth too.”
“If I hadn't made a resolution to be
kind and gentle to my brothers and
sister I should be very angry with you
two,” said Margaret quietly.
“New Year's Day ought not to come
so near Christmas,” said Norman,
detaching another wheel from Peter's
engine. “They let you have a pretty
fair time at Christmas, and then when
all your presents have got lost or
broken and you feel you want cheering

THE LAST CHANCE.
[A hint to the young Hopeful on how to get
the present he wants.]
THE most urgent duty of all young
people at this happy season of giving
is (of course) to keep their relatives up
to the scratch. It may be that most
of your uncles and aunts have already
remembered you this Christmas or
New Year; but there are sure to be
one or two black sheep amongst them.
These may still retrieve their position
before the holidays are over if a little
tact is exercised in reminding them of
their faults.
Uncle John and Aunt Jane, one on
each side of the family, are the cul-
prits... Let us also suppose (which is
less likely) that they don't know each
other's address or for some reason are
not on speaking terms. Take two nice
clean sheets of note-paper, an ink-pot
and a pen, and carefully holding the
last-named so that the top end, if pro-
duced, would rest on the right shoulder,
make a copy of the following model
epistles:—
DEAR UNCLE JoHN, -Thank you
most awfully for the toy aeroplane you
so kindly sent me this Christmas. I
Let us suppose that
don't think there's anything I wanted
so much, unless it was Treasure Island.
I hope your gout is much better.
Your aff, nephew, N. (or M.).
DEAREST AUNT JANE,--Thank you
very, very much for Treasure Island.
It was good of you to send it me.
You could not have thought of any-
thing I should like so much, except,
perhaps, a toy aeroplane. I hope
Tabitha is keeping well. Believe me,
Your very loving nephew,
N. (or M.).
Now address two envelopes, one to
Uncle John and the other to Aunt
Jane, and put Uncle John's letter in
Aunt Jane's envelope, and vice versd.
If after this you don't get Treasure
Island and a toy aeroplane before the
holidays are over, I'm afraid that
Uncle John and Aunt Jane are both
past redemption, and no further notice
need be taken of them. Anyhow, you
will have done your best, and no child
can be expected to do more.
The Search for Beauty.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RENDEZVOUS.
I Took a dislike to Peter Gurney for
the following, amongst other, reasons.
He bought a gate-leg table on which
I had cast the purchasing eye, and
married the lady upon whom I had set
my heart. Speaking generally, he is
a grasping fellow, but his last and
worst effort has been to take the set
of residential chambers in the Temple
which I particularly wanted. Its
official number is 5, Inner Court,
fourth floor, North.
I dislike Perkins because he is a
new porter in the Temple, and Temple
porters ought not to be new ; because
he wears a gold band on his top hat,
and top hats look much nicer without
gold bands; and because he never
touches his hat to me when I pass,
and porters' top hats, even when made
of gold, are meant to be touched.
My dislikes were not so marked as
to prevent my calling on Peter Gurney
in his new rooms in the Temple on
the second night of his occupation.
But my dislike for him became so
marked at the end of the visit that I
left prepared to do my worst by him.
I felt that he might have kept his
householder's pride for someone else
under the circumstances. He should
have said, “These rooms are not so
good as they seem. There are drains;”
or, “These rooms are not so good as
they seem. There are no drains.” He
did no such kindly act. He pointed
me out all sorts of additional and
unsuspected advantages, and, having
had his gloat, he put me out of his
front door in a frame of mind bordering
on the homicidal. The mere sight of
Perkins at the Temple gate after that
was enough to make me loathe him for
ever. The Temple gates are locked
from ten at night till six in the morn-
ing, and to-night it was Perkins' melan-
choly duty to sit by this gate and
attend it during those hours. Even
that thought, however, did not appease
my hatred of him.
“Do you wish to go out, Sir?” he
said foolishly, starting to unfasten the
bolts.
“Oh, no,” said I, “that is the last
thing I want; ” but the sarcasm was
lost on him.
“Then what do you want, Sir?” he
said.
“I want,” I said, “I want . . .” and
I paused to conceive the most unlikely
thing I could want. Instead, I hit on
an idea.
“No,” I continued, less ironically,
“I do not want to go out. In fact, I
live in here. When I have lived here
a little longer you will know me better.
My name is Peter Gurney, and I live

at 5, Inner Court, fourth floor, North.
Now, I want to catch a very early train
in the morning, but doubt if I shall
wake up in time. My servant does not
come in the morning till seven-thirty,
and my train leaves King's Cross at
six-fifteen. If I am left to myself I
shall wake up at three o'clock, four
o'clock, and eight o'clock. When I
want to be awake is, of course, at five.
You, I understand, will be hereabouts
till 6 A.M. to-morrow. Will you come
and knock loudly on my door at five 2
Five o'clock sharp; and loudly, mind.”
“Yes, Sir,” answered Perkins, the
porter, “five o'clock sharp, Sir.”
“Thank you,” I said, “I will rely on
you. Here is a shilling for yourself.”
But I paused in the act. Why should
I give him the shilling? Why should
not Peter Gurney? “Look here—I
won't give it you now. You may
forget, and, even if you don't, the mere
fact of your knocking on my door
doesn't guarantee my getting up, does
it? Let us leave it like this; you
come and knock at mv door—Peter
Gurney, remember, 5, Inner Court—
knock loudly at my door at five, and go
on knocking till he—I come to the
door and give you the shilling.”
Then I made my way out of the
Templeby anothergate, pleasantly warm
within at the thought of the meeting
between Peter Gurney and Perkins at
five o'clock, five o'clock sharp, on a
cold and frosty morning.
Two extracts from one issue of The
Daily Chronicle:
“A holiday crowd of between 2,000 and 3,000
people witnessed the meet of Blankney hounds
at the South Park, Lincoln, vesterday.”
“Unusual scenes were witnessed yesterday at
Lincoln, when the Blankey hounds met in the
city. Fully 10,000 people assembled.”
Funny that the Blankey should be so
much more popular.

SECRETS OF THE PRISON HOUSE.
THE Editor AND HIs GoLFING EXPERT.
DEAR MR. BILTON, You have now
discussed in the 6,000 odd articles you
have written for us every conceivable
normal phase of golf, and I am begin-
ning to notice a certain tendency to
ring the changes in your otherwise
excellent papers. I wonder whether
you could see your way to discuss the
pastime under any novel, abnormal,
or even imaginary conditions. I have
consulted the editor of our Sporting
Supplement, and with his approval
send you the following suggestions:—
Golf in the Arctic Regions.
Golf in the Jungle.
Golf in Mars.
Golf as a ground for Divorce.
practising mashie shots in a blizzard
in Montana, should serve as a warning.
As the great NAPOLEoN said, il faut se
borner. Jungle golf, however, though
one of the most arduous and exacting
forms of the game, is distinctly within
the range of possibility. . . It was
NIETzsche who observed in his famous
work, Der Fall Wagner, “il faut médi-
terraniser la musique.” So the modern
golfer feels the insistent need, with a
view to effecting a rapprochement be-
tween East and West, of orientalising
the Royal and Antient game.
Danger, which lends spice to all true
sport, is the very essence of jungle golf,
which bears much the same relation to
the suburban variety as a picture by
WAN GoGH does to a canvas of WAN
through the jungle, a fact which re-
duces the clubs required to two—a
niblick and a putter. But if fewer
clubs are used the number of balls
needed is legion. The Maharajah of
GUTTIALA once lost 238 in a famous
match with the Begum of JELLIcore,
but won by 3 up and 2 to play in
25,427 strokes. The game only lasted
three weeks. Each player employed
300 caddies; of these 72 perished from
snake bites and 79 were carried off by
man-eating tigers.
It is an open question whether players
of jungle golf should be allowed to
carry firearms. Here local rules differ.

out by Mr. VALENTINE CHIRoL with a
view to allaying Indian unrest, Mauser

touch of preciosity or even a Greek
quotation. It may attract the
unathletic reader and lead to an
interesting correspondence. And
do not scruple to refer to NIETzsche,
BERNARD SHAw, DEBUssy, STRAUSs,
ANATOLE FRANCE, WAN GoGH, YEATS,

Madame ACRTÉ, if you can drag
them in somehow. Yours faith-
fully, ADRIAN FLAIR.
DEAR MR. FLAIR,-Many thanks
for your letter and the helpful
suggestions for widening the range
of my articles. I am afraid that
my Greek is rather rocky, and I
confess that I had never heard of
some of the people you mention.
pistols are habitually carried. At
Udaipur, on the other hand, the
players use an ingenious form of
niblick, the shaft of which contains
an air-gun.
From the foregoing remarks it
will be seen that the jungle-golfer
cannot count on getting a long drive
from the tee. There are many
reasons to account for their lack of
length, but it is best to treat the
matter philosophically and, instead
of bemoaning your own short-
comings, try to obtain consolation
by watching others who suffer from
a similar affliction. Besides, as
KEATs says, there is always “a
budding morrow in midnight.”
DEAR MR. BILTON,-The article
is, in the main, so excellent that
I am sure you will not think me
captious if I criticise one or two
minor points. About the inmates
of the jungle—are the birds you
mention quite correct? You might
verify your list before the article
NIETzsche, for instance, and VAN
Gogh are not to be found in Who's
Who. But I have a sister who is
very keen on art and music and the
classics, and she has helped me with
the enclosed article, which I submit as
a sort of trial trip over the new course.
I need hardly say that the whole thing
is entirely imaginary, but that is what
you said you wanted.
Yours very truly, BERNARD BILTON.
JUNGLE GOLF.
It is one of the peculiar merits of
golf that it can be played not only at
all seasons but under all atmospheric
and climatic conditions. The ideal
golfer should always be capable of
rising superior to circumstances and
asserting himself trip pºpov, as HoMER
says. Still there is a limit to human
endurance, and the fate of a young
Scots enthusiast, who insisted on
BEERs. Here is not the enervating
languor of “silken Samarcand,” but a
constant strife with the deadliest forces
of elemental Nature. Contact with the
Thanatophidia, the swift onslaught of
the greater Felidae, await the player at
every turn. As ANDREw KIRKALDY re-
marked in a luminous phrase, “it’s
juist one long suicide.” Then there is
the physical strain of barging through
the jungle, amid the terrifying shrieks
of macaws, parrakeets, cockatoos, and
other fearsome wild fowl, the derisive
hoots of the simian population, and
the trumpeting of rogue elephants. But
the fascination of the pastime is pro-
portioned to its perils, and the jungle
golfer comes of the same strain as the
aeroplanist and the football referee.
To come to particulars, it may be
well to explain that the holes are located
in clearings, but they are all approached
appears. Then the phrase, “simian
population," strikes me as a little
Telegraphese. I confess to a slight
disappointment that you have not
introduced any reference to the “whole
tone scale.” You see the proprietor
is a great admirer of DEBUssy, so I
think it would be politic to gratify
him in this respect. I return the
proof for you to make these corrections
and additions. Yours faithfully,
ADRIAN FLAIR.
P.S.—You might add to the list of
suggestions “Golf in Lunatic Asylums ”
and “Golf in the Grand Sahara, or The
Riddle of the Sands.”
In its advice upon the making of
Christmas cake Tit-Bits says:
“Pinch mixed spice.*
* Optional.”
In matters of conscience we shall
certainly not be dictated to.

of a dummy spectator, grows suspicious
of the process and silently protests.
He can swallow, swords (as alleged),
but this is rather more than he can
comfortably stomach.
However, all
comes right in the end.
The little lame boy (prettily played
by Miss HETTY KENyon) is not, as in
the , legend, left out of the
hollow of the hill, and the loss
of him provides Miss MARION
TERRY with a chance, as the
mother, of pleading with The
Piper for his restoration. A
tedious argument leaves him
stubborn, but he yields at last,
moved by the figure of the
“lonely man” on the wayside

professional vermin-killer; he
goes through the world, like
BRowNING's Herakles, putting
wrongs right, letting caged
things out of their prisons; and

his guilders, he pipes the children away
| from their narrow confinement among
the sordid burghers of Hamelin; and
not to their destruction, but to a life
of fun and freedom in the caverns of
the enchanted hillside.
So long as the children were on the
scene the play was full of natural
charm and delightful movement; but
in their absence there was a deal of dull
| stuffing. Mr. BENSON, who managed
his large family very cleverly, was not
himself quite the Pied Piper of one's
imagination. Possibly the absence of
all disguise from his head and face
spoiled the illusion. And I missed,
except at rare moments, the
note of sincerity. He just
threw off his lines with the
ease of an actor who does this
sort of thing every day of his
life, and will be ready to-mor-
row to play you any part in
reason with equal fluency and
detachment. I need hardly
say that he indulged in some
nice athletic interludes, pick-
ing up children and treating
them like dumb-bells whenever
it occurred to him. O. S.
“JACK AND THE BEANSTALK.”
I should like my opening
words to be, “Mr. Collins
has surpassed himself,” be-
cause that seems to be the
beginning and ending of Drury
Lane criticism, but, alas! I
have no authority to write
those words. Wait till next
year and I will see what I
can do for you. But this year
(I blush to think that some
sophisticated young gentleman
of ten may read these lines) I
have to start with a confession
—I went to Jack and the
Beanstalk in STEAD-like inno-
cence, having seen many pan-
tomimes, but never a Drury Lane one
before... (And I have always missed
the Lord Mayor's show too: one can't
explain these things—theyjust happen.)
So poor Mr. Collins may have sur-
passed himself in every scene, and yet
I cannot mention it ! What else, you
wonder, is there to say?
I think I shall imitate Robinson
Crusoe (another pantomime character),
and make a list of the good and the
bad, as it seemed to me.
Pro. The idea of excusing in advance
all improbabilities of plot by showing
the pantomime as the dream of a Boy
Scout was very good.
Con. But it was a pity to leave out
so much of the excellent story of Jack
and the Beanstalk.
Pro. The staging was wonderful—
Mr. GEORGE GRAVEs
Mr. AkTHUR CoNQUEST
particularly in “The Giant's Garden.”
The ballets also were beautiful, but—
Con. I had too much of them. (Do
children like it?)
Pro. Mr. GEORGE GRAVEs as Mrs.
Halleybut was a perpetual joy. He is
a real actor and a real humorist.
Con. Messrs. HARRY RANDALL and
GEORGE BARRETT, as Prince Spinach
and Rupert Halleybut, bored me beyond

OUR LIFT.
I LIVE in a flat. The hall-porter
lets me go up and down in the lift all
by myself.
It isn't one of those electric things
where you simply press a button
marked “fourth floor,” and it stops of
its own accord. They're not much
fun.
Ours is one of the old hydraulic sort,
where you pull a rope down to start it
and pull it up to stop it. It is no
child's play.
One day last week I came out of my
flat in my immaculate morning coat
and silk hat, opened the cage door and
pulled the rope. I suppose I ought to
have looked down first, but I have
acquired a sort of reckless daring in
dealing with the lift. Familiarity
breeds contempt, as you know.
The lift rose with intense speed.
Inside was the surprise of a lifetime.
A frightfully pretty girl in an enchant-
ing hobble skirt was sitting on the
floor. I recognised her as an inmate
of a lower flat.
I have the usual savoir faire of the
man-about-town. I raised the silk hat.
“I beg your pardon. Were you
using the lift 2 ”
“Yes, but I've finished with it,”
she said. “As soon as I can get up
I'll get out.”
“Stay where you are,” was my
gallant reply. “I am coming to the
rescue.”
I was as good as my word. I entered
the lift and placed her on her feet.
“Trust yourself to me,” I said,
closing the barrier. “The intrepid
aeronauts prepared to descend.”
“I think I'll walk down,” she said.
“I never aviate with strangers. Be-
sides, you drive too fast. I thought I
was going through the top of the
building just now.”
“Nonsense,” I said.
walk down. The charwoman is at
work. Communication is cut off.
Have no fear.”
I manipulated the rope.
Accidents will happen. It was not
my fault that the lift stuck midway
between two floors.
I worked the rope violently and
switched the light off as they do in the
Tubes when the train sticks. But
nothing came of it.
We were in complete darkness, cut
off from the world without an intro-
duction.
“What happens now?” she said.
“Keep quite calm,” I said. “First
we will have some light on the scene.”
I switched it on again.
"We must face the situation,” I
said. “For all we know we may

We have not been introduced. Let us
waive formalities.”
We waived them for two hours.
Yes. For two whole hours we were
suspended in mid-air.
I smoked the inevitable cigarettes of
the phlegmatic aviator, and talked to
her in a natural and reassuring manner.
Eventually somebody did something
somewhere, and we made a graceſul
descent. The crowd of welcomers in-
cluded the girl's mother and several
aunts and people.
The porter released us with an
offensive grin.
True to my habitual modesty I did
not thrust myself into the public eye.
I stood in the back of the lift while she
landed.
“My dear child,” said her mother,
“how often have I told you not to play
with the lift 2 ”
“I didn't break it,” said the ridicu-
lous girl. “Let me introduce Mr. * -
But I was disappearing again quite
quickly. Only my immaculate boots

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
In this age of travel everyone of us must know some-
body who is familiar with, or at least interested in, Japan.
Personally, my own previous experience of the country did
not extend beyond the confines of Shepherd's Bush, but
this has by no means lessened my enjoyment of Lady
LAwson's fascinating book, Highways and Homes of Japan
(FISHER UNwiN), which seems to me indeed a model for
works of its kind. The author, for one thing, obviously
knows her subject, and has enjoyed what appear to have
been exceptional opportunities for studying the home life of
the people about whom she writes. She has, moreover,
the journalistic eye for picturesque and essential detail,
a style that manages to convey information without
boredom, and a perfect genius for photography. The
illustrations which her camera has provided are altogether
charming, more especially several delightful snapshots of
Japanese kiddies at play; and a thing about these pictures
that struck me with a shock – - -
of gratified astonishment was
that in every case they are
inserted so as to coincide
with that portion of the text
which they illustrate. Would
that of all similar volumes
one could say the same.

Undoubtedly the best way
of solving the domestic ser-
vant difficulty is to write a
charming book about the va-
garies of the species as ELIZA-
BETH Robins PENNELL has
done. It is a subject, too,
which gives the writer a great
advantage over the ordinary
novelist who pillories his
concerned, but not over concerned, with the life of a lady
of that name. She so far forgot the traditions of her
ancient family as to marry a Nobody of Nowhere, a mere
lawyer, and to bear him a son of the name of Roland.
The ancient family disowned her, Mr. Nobody deserted her
and became, as mere lawyers will, a great judge, while
Roland, being deprived of a father's philosophy and
guidance, never put his nose out of his door without getting
it into somebody else's trouble. In the earlier eighteenth
century there was rather a lot of vicarious trouble lying
about for enterprising young gentlemen of Jacobite pro-
fessions, and Roland ends in the dock, charged with
treason and a murder committed by his rival in love. If
you have any acquaintance with other novels which touch
upon the law, I need not tell you who was the judge that
sat upon his case nor in what an irregular manner the trial
was conducted. Rather it must be shown with what effect
Mr. JAMES PRIOR tells his story. One feels that he has
spent all his pains upon his selection of words and left his
narrative to look after itself, and yet, in spite of him, it is
the narrative that pleases and the elaborate language that
–– tends to irritate. But on
the whole I may say that I }
quite enjoyed the book, and
hope that you will have the
patience to do the same. *

Our House (FishBR UNwiN) are ever likely to read it and
recognise their identities; though, I should imagine, it
would make them that wild if they did. Mrs. PENNELL's
experiences were perhaps rather more lively than the
average mistress need expect to undergo, but that was
because her “generals" were recruited from what she
insists on calling “The Quarter,” that is to say, Soho. It
is all the more to her credit that, if she failed to find many
“perfect treasures,” she unearthed vast quantities of the
gold of humour at every attempt; and, when I mention
that amongst the constant visitors at Our House were
WHISTLER, R. A. M. STEvenson and HENLEY, it will be
quite clear that it was not for lack of interesting friends
in the drawing-room that she has chosen to make capital
out of the kitchen. Of all the characters (though that is
rather a tactless word) who figure in these pages I think
I like Trimmer best : Trimmer of whom Mrs. PENNELL
writes, “I am convinced that if I had said, ‘Trimmer, there
is a lion roaring at the door," she would have answered,
‘That's all right, Mum ! thank you, Mum !" and rushed to
say that we were not at home to him.” Readers in search
of good situations are strongly recommended to try Our
House.
Fortuna Chance (CoNSTABLE) is a novel of some length,
lithe, the exquisite, was near
to be loved, and Monsieur le Curé tended his weather-beaten
flock and shot the good wild duck with impartial zeal.
Suzette, more a little daughter than a servant, achieved the
rarest soufflés, and The Essence of Selfishness was a cat.
They lived for adventures, now romance, now a mere
escapade, more often a delightful nothing, once a
stirring incident of melodrama. In the background were
the dogs and the guns, the tragedies of poverty, the
comedies of officialdom, the relentless sea and the say
Bohemian life. Whether Mr. BERKELEY SMITH is (as
he pretends to be) that same American, or whether no
such person ever existed, I care not one little blow. I care
not whether so excellent a lot of rogues were in fact created |
by heaven or invented in fiction by an author (incredible in
either case); I only know that I never want to read a book
lighter, prettier, merrier, daintier, more touching or engaging
than A Village of Vagabonds (HoddPR AND Stoughton).
“To clean a picture frame which has had silver leaf on it instead
of gold leaf, take half a dozen medium sized English onions and boil
them in their skins in about a pint and a half of water. Wash and
polish them with soft rags.”—Evening News.
The writer is getting away from the point. We don't
want to know how to clean onions.

Touching the case of fair young Henriette

Instinct for seeing through your sex and kind,
Is she-I put it to you—quite a suitable
Companion for the subtler sort of mind 2
Is she, or is she not,
Qualified for the post—to share my lot?
You know my taste, in virtues as in clarets;
Well, will she make a satisfactory bride?
Is she pure gold, or only fifteen carats,
Sound to the core, or simply fair outside,
- This Henriette (or Harry)
Whom I particularly want to marry?
Ladies, you well deserve this referendum,
For, when I chose, I had your charms in view;
Could I have seen that she contrived to blend 'em,
Had they not struck my notice first in you?
Her gifts your own recall,
And, wedding her, I seem to wed you all!
Kindly confirm my choice and you enhance her,
If possible, in my profound esteem;
Dut if, upon the other hand, your answer
Should throw discouragement on love's young dream,
Then hold me not to blame
If I proceed to wed her just the same.
For it is you (not she) are on your trial;
This is a test case meant to prove your worth;
And, if the bulk of you pronounce denial
That she is far the nicest thing on earth,
Such verdict will denote -

MANNERS FROM oregon.
PortDAND, the metropolis of Oregon, was founded in
1844, and became a city in 1851. Though it stands about
100 miles from the ocean it is a prosperous port. It has
churches, schools, sawmills, canneriés, breweries—in short
all the complex apparatus of an advanced civilisation. In
spite of these manifold blessings Portland has never been
sufficiently famous. This defect I propose to remedy.
There is, it appears, in Portland a newspaper named The
Oregonian, a mouth-filling and splendid title; and The
Oregonian sometimes devotes such leisure as it can spare
from the pursuit of politics, literature, and general news to
matters even more closely pertaining to the conduct of life.
Recently it published an article on the etiquette of the
table, by PRUDENCE STANDISH-Miss PRUDENCE STANDISH
as I may, I think, presume her to be.
It is an engrossing but a desperately difficult subject,
surrounded with pitfalls of varying depth and danger. How
shall an aspirant attain to perfect correctness and ease so
that those who see him (or her) sitting at table may say,
“Lo, there is one on whom at least twopence was expended
in early youth. He is quite sure about his napkin; he
knows what to do with his knife and fork; the manage-
ment of his bread and the lifting of his tankard of stout
are equally child's play to him. Why can't we be like
him 2 " You will be like him, I answer, if only you will
read PRUDENCE's article.
In the Book of Snobs (chapter 1) we are asked to believe
that Englishmen of rank and distinction must not make
use of their knives in order to convey peas, those mercurial
and elusive vegetables, to the mouth, but that foreigners of
rank may do this without reproach. “I have seen,” says
the author, “the Hereditary Princess of Potztausend-
Donnerwetter (that serenely beautiful ...) use her
knife in lieu of a fork or spoon; I have seen her almost
swallow it, by Jove' like Ramo Samee, the Indian juggler.
And did I blench 2 Did my estimation for the Princess
diminish 2 No, lovely Amalia | One of the truest passions
that ever was inspired by woman was raised in this bosom
by that lady. Beautiful one! long may the knife carry
food to those lips, the reddest and loveliest in the world !”
On this vexed question PRUDENCE remains almost silent.
Even Lady GROVE, our own British classic, says nothing
about it.
Listen, however, to PRUDENCE on napkins: “When every-
body is seated at table—not before—the napkin is taken up
from the plate across which it lies, and opened out across
the knees. However beautiful a gown or splendid a gentle-
man's evening get-up, it is the height of bad taste to pin
the napkin up to the bodice or tuck one end into the waist-
coat. One shake—the two hands held to the right of the
sitter—unfolds it sufficiently, and without more ado it is
laid upon the lap. After the meal, when dining with friends
the napkin may be folded and laid by the plate.”
I daresay all this is quite sound—though, I fancy, some
high authorities forbid the folding of the napkin when a
meal is over. They consider that it argues a mean regard
for economy, an intention, in fact, to use the napkin on
some subsequent occasion, and they prefer the reckless
daredevil custom of leaving the napkin in a chaotic con-
dition on the floor. My own special trouble with napkins,
however, arises from their being sometimes built up in the
shape of boats or mitres, in which state they often contain
a roll of bread hidden in their recesses. It's ten to one
with me that the bread rolls out of the napkin on to the
floor, and if I and the other guests used the method of
PRUDENCE—“the two hands held to the right of the sitter”—
there might be quite a dangerous fusillade of rolls. To give
or to receive a roll in the eye would be but a poor beginning to
a party. As to the tucking or pinning of napkins, I agree with
PRUDENCE. Not even thick soup and a heavy moustache
will excuse a man who callously tucks one end into the
waistcoat. Let him lean his head forward or sacrifice the
waistcoat. Finally, “the guest may lay down his or her
eating implements at any time, but the napkin is not taken
from the lap until the hostess removes hers.” This is a
counsel of perfection. My experience is that when napkins
are highly starched and glazed they remove themselves
over and over again. Nothing breaks the ice better than
to bring your head into a collision with a lady's as you
both stoop to recover her fallen napkin.
I pass now to some matters on which our own barbarous
customs appear to differ slightly from those of Portland:
“The knives and soup-spoon are at the right of the plate,
and the various forks used at the left.” So far, I think,
we agree, but “the smaller knife will be used for the

entrée and the larger for the roast ; the two forks for
these courses are generally the same size. The knife is held
in the right hand and is used exclusively"—here PRUDENCE
hints at the Princess of Potztausend-Donnerwetter—“for
cutting food, and after this " (my italics) “the fork is
shifted to the right hand for eating.” First chop your
food, then fork it, is a good motto. “But save for such
very small vegetables as peas and beans, or for rice, the
fork is not used spoon-wise, but rather to lift conveniently
shaped pieces with the ends of the prongs. . It is not
thought elegant to mash up food with the fork before
eating, or to turn the fork over and pile up the other side
with food, as some persons do; and though these things
seem fairly trifling, they count in the summing up of
perfect table deportment.” Here again we agree.
Let me give a few priceless maxims:–
(1) “One must not say, ‘I don't like' a thing when it is
offered, but simply, ‘No, thank you,' if it is not desired.”
(2) “Salt must not be put on the table-cloth for radishes
or celery, but on the side of the plate.”
(3) “The host carves, the hostess serves the soup (if
there is a tureen), and gives the signal for beginning the
meal by taking up her soup-spoon.” (But what happens
where the hostess, under dietary regulations, takes no
soup? Does she still wave her otiose soup-spoon?)
(4) “Oysters, clams, and terrapins are also fork foods,
and it is thought a break in good manners to eat any of
these things with a knife.” (But what shall we say about
kromeskies or patties 2 I have known a chicken-patty
stand out against the most powerful fork.)
(5) “Where a hostess has a very stylishly dressed
table, and there is a guest” |. for instance) “who is
likely to be green in the employment of the right utensils,
it is considerate and well bred of her to give the cue by
taking up the proper implement for the course, as the
great variety of forks and spoons now used on a smart
table is sometimes embarrassing.” (But if her chicken-
patty is softer and more amenable than mine, and she
takes up a fork for it, must I abstain from using a knife
for my obstinate one? I simply refuse to forfeit my chance
of the patty. I shall commit “a break” and use my
knife.

PRUDENCE does not tell us how they deal with asparagus

waves her hand for a signal and then everybody falls to
with fingers in the primitive British fashion which gains
in convenience all that it loses in elegance. Possibly
PRUDENCE will continue to instruct us. In the meantime
I bid her a grateful farewell.

THE EDIToR AND HIs MUSICAL CRITIC.
DEAR MR. KITE,-Although your
contributions to our columns have
hitherto lain in the sphere of sport and
pastime, the retirement of our musical
critic, Mr. Blandy, has decided me to
offer you his post for the following

reasons. The appeal of music is no
longer confined to persons who lead
sedentary or artistic lives. Musicians,
whether amateurs or professionals, are
increasingly addicted to outdoor exer-
cises — golf, motoring, cricket, &c.
Secondly, women, who form the great
majority of the concert-going public,
are nowadays habitually trained in
muscular and ath-
its luscious grandeur. After the custo, a very favourable impression on this
mary reprise comes the working-out
section in the form of a free fantasia,
and the peroration is at once jubilant
and majestic. The slow movement in
6-8 time is, strange to say, entirely
melodic in character with occasional
explosions in the percussion depart-
ment, but the Presto, a moto perpetuo,
has all the exhilaration of a toboggan
her first appearance before a Metro-
politan audience. Madame de Sapiolo
is a robust soprano, of the type of a
Cornish forward, who attacks her high
notes with the intrepidity of an aviator.
Her voice is no voia blanche; it strikes
her hearers pink at every shot. In
Ocean, thou mighty monster, she never
once foozled an approach or got into
letic pursuits.
Hence the need for
treating music in a
manner which will
meet the altered
conditions. Of
course I do not
want you abso-
lutely to disregard
the technical side
of the art, but I
have no doubt that
you can pick this

A TWICE TOLD TALE.
“Is that you, uncle?” said a voice
from the nursery, as I hung my coat
up in the hall. “I’ve only got my
skin on, but you can come up.”
However, she was sitting up in bed
with her mightgown on when I found
her.
“I was having my bath when you
came,” she explained. “Have you
come all the way from London 2"
“All the way.” --
“Then will you tell me a story 2”
“I can't ; I'm going to have my
dinner. I only came up to Say Good-
night. -
Margery leant forward and whis-
pered coaxingly, “Will you just tell me
about Beauty and 'e Beast 2"
“But I've told you that such heaps
of times. And it's much too long for
to-night.”
“Tell me half of it. As much as
that.” She held her hands about mineſ
inches apart.
“That's too much.”
“As much as that.” The hands came |
a little nearer together.
“Oh! Well, I'll tell you up to where
the Beast died.”
“Fought he died,” she corrected
eagerly. 3 . . . .
“Yes. We]] * >
“How much will that be? As much
as I said 2" *
I nodded. The preliminary business
settled, she gave a little sigh of happi-
mess, put her arms round her knees,
and waited breathlessly for the story
she had heard twenty times before.
“Once upon a time there was a man
who had three daughters. And one
day —” - -
“What was the man's name 2"
“Margery,” I said reproachfully,
annoyed at the interruption, “you
know I never tell you the man's name.”
“Tell me now.”
“Orlando,” I said after a moment's
thought.
“I told Daddy it was Thomas,” said
Margery casually. -
“Well, as a matter of fact he had
two names, Orlando and Thomas.”
“Why did he have two names?”
“In case he lost one. Well, one day
this man, who was very poor, heard
that a lot of money was waiting for
him in a ship which had come over the
sea to a town some miles off. So
he - ?
“Was it waiting at Weymouſ?”
“Somewhere like that.”
“I spex it must have been Weymouſ,
because there's lots of sea there.”
“Yes, I'm sure it was. Well, he
thought he'd go to Weymouth and get
the money.”
“How much monies was it 2 ”
“Oh, lots and lots.”
“As much as five pennies?”
“Yes, about that. Well, he said
Good-bye to his daughters, and asked
them what they'd like him to bring
back for a present. And the first asked
for some lovely jewels and diamonds
and * >
“Like Mummy's locket — is that
jewels?”
“That sort of idea. Well, she wanted
a lot of things like that. And the
second wanted some beautiful clothes.”
“What sort of clothes 2 ”
“Oh, frocks and—well, frocks and all
sorts of er, frocks.”
“Did she want any lovely new stock-
ings?”
“Yes, she wanted three pairs of
those.” -
“And did she want any lovely
“Yes,” I said hastily, “she wanted
lots of those, too. Lots of everything.”
Margery gave a little sob of happi-
ness. “Go on telling me,” she said
under her breath.
“Well, the third daughter was called
Beauty. And she thought to herself,
“Poor Father won't have any money
left at all, if we all go on like this!'
So she didn't ask for anything very ex-
pensive, like her selfish sisters, she only
asked for a rose. A simple red rose.”
Margery moved uneasily.
“I hope,” she said wistfully, “this
bit isn't going to be about—you know.
It never did before.”
“About what 2 ”
“Good little girls and bad little girls,
and fings like that.”
“My darling, no, of course not. I
told it wrong. Beauty asked for a
rose because she loved roses so. And
it was a very particular kind of red
rose that she wanted—a sort that they
simply couldn't get to grow in their
own garden because of the soil.”
“Go on telling me,” said Margery,
with a deep sigh of content.
“Well, he started off to Weymouth.”
“What day did he start 2"
“It was Monday. And when——
“Oh, well, anyhow, I told Daddy it
was Tuesday.”
“Tuesday—now let me think. Yes,
I believe you're right. Because on
Monday he went to a meeting of the
Vegetable Gardeners, and proposed the
health of the Chairman. Yes, well he
started off on Tuesday, and when he
got there he found that there was no
money for him at all!”
“I spex somebody had taken it,” said
Margery breathlessly.
“Well, it had all gone somehow.”
“Prehaps somebody had swallowed
it,” said Margery, a little carried away
by the subject. “By mistake.”
“Anyhow, it was gone. And he had
to come home again without any money.
He hadn't gone far * >
“How far?” asked Margery. “As
far as that 2" and she measured nine
inches in the air.
“About forty-four miles—when he
came to a beautiful garden.”
“Was it a really lovely big garden 2
Bigger than ours?”
“Oh, much bigger.”
“Bigger than yours?”
“I haven't got a garden.”
Margery looked at me wonderingly.
She opened her mouth to speak, and
then stopped and rested her head upon
her hands and thought out this new
situation. At last, her face flushed
with happiness, she announced her
decision.
“Go on telling me about Beauty and
the Beast now,” she said breathlessly,
“ and then tell me why you haven't got
a garden.”
My average time for Beauty and the f
Beast is ten minutes, and, if we stop
at the place when the Beast thought
he was dead, six minutes twenty-five
seconds. But, with the aid of seemingly
innocent questions, a determined
character can make even the craftiest
uncle spin the story out to half-an-hour. |
“Next time,” said Margery, when ||
we had reached the appointed place
and she was being tucked up in bed,
“will you tell me all the story?”
Was there the shadow of a smile in
her eyes? I don't know. But I'm
sure it will be wisest next time to
promise her the whole thing.

He finds it will not dough ;
He gazes stupid as a cough,
And fails to find a clough.

He fears his countrymen will scough
To see his spelling gough

There is, we hear, considerable

MR. PUNCH'S MEDICAL NOTES.
[A correspondent of the Lancet says:–“Smok-
ing just before meals is to be deprecated, because
the pungency of the pyroligneous products
..!. in tobacco smoke renders the buccal
mucosa insensitive to alimentary stimulation—
in fact, their effect is to dull or abolish the
olfacto-gustatory reflex, thus depriving us of
what Pawlaw calls Appetite juice."]
Mr. Punch also offers a few similar
homely tips on domestic hygiene:—
(1) Chocolate Creams before meals
are apt to produce ante-post-prandial
bursitis, collateral with sub-acute
lesions of meticulous patronymics. The

cipient rabies; sixty-three senile de-
mentia; eighteen acute delusional hys-
teria; and no fewer than half of them
chronic schlerosis of tissue and danger-
ous deficiency of currants. At the
expiration of five years the whole of the
buns lacked gusto-olfactory dynamics
of nutrition. Pawlaw therefore dis-
courages the use of bath buns as a
staple human diet but permits moder-
ate indulgence in them by lady typists
and polar bears in captivity.

It happened in Princes Street, which

there comes a lull in the conversation

the street was free from traffic. At
that moment there appeared, seemingly
from nowhere, a miniature carriage,
drawn by a tiny horse, driven by a
diminutive driver. Everyone stopped
to gaze at the apparition in amaze-
ment. One had to rub one's eyes to

four hundred bath buns from as many

research. He found only 2 per cent.
of the buns approximated to standard

closed foreign bodies within six out of
ten, and ninety-four showed evidence

eighty - one displayed symptoms of

It was the second month of the
For weeks great masses of
into Blackwall by road, rail and river,
till the pavements within a four-mile
radius were hot with their bivouac fires
and the traffic was obstructed over all
East London. Every garrison town of
the South and Midlands was stripped
of its defending force, having sacrificed
itself to the country's instant need.
The flower of the nation's manhood
was concentrated on Blackwall.
Here, in the Theatre of War, per-
manent gun-positions were established
on the roofs of every brewery. The
noise of the bombardment and the
accidental pulverising of a few private
dwellings had been made the subject
of letters to the Press by certain testy
residents on whose tender nerves the
roar of the twenty-four horse and field
batteries, and the heavy armaments of
the Channel Squadron in the river had
begun to tell.
Cheap excursion trains and steamers
brought sightseers from all parts of
the kingdom, and behind the infantry
lines the specially-erected steel towers
and flip-flaps, which gave a splendid
view of the besieged attic, were
crowded to suffocation.
At the end of the sixth week every
available man, child and regimental
goat in the Army, Reserves, Territorials,
and Boy Scouts had been requisitioned;
the river was stuffed full of Navy, and
an appeal for help had been sent to the
Colonies.
Then came the day when the evening
papers broke out in crimson and orange
stripes and their staffs foamed at the
mouth. The besieged criminal was
reported to have escaped. The next
morning there was a view-halloa from
an aeroplane over Clapham Common,
and the Blues, the 1st Life Guards, and
four Regiments of Cavalry of the Line
charged from Clapham Junction, join-
ing hands on both flanks with the
entire alphabet of R.H.A. batteries,
whose nimble guns at the gallop
searched the bush of the Common with
well-directed fire.
What happened to the criminal
nobody knows. He was never heard of
again. But the voice of the Boy in
the Street, who happened to be a Scout,
was heard to express a preference for
the good old days when Sleuth-Hound
Dick captured his miscreants in his
own quiet way, and soldiers were kept
for fighting.

AT THE PLAY.
“Is MATRIMONY A FAILURE 2''
No bachelor should attempt to solve
this riddle, but, if you asked me a
similar question about the play that
propounds it, I could hazard a shrewd-
ish guess. Of course, with a British
audience, it is not in mortal playwrights
to command failure, but the German
authors of this so-called “light comedy”
have at least gone a good way towards
deserving it. The play has an excellent
idea to start with. The discovery of a
technical flaw in their marriage cere-
monies at a certain church sets free a
variety of couples, and it is a question
how many of them will take advantage
of their liberty. The men are at first
unanimous for freedom; and the women
combine to reduce them to submission.
Here are the makings of yet another
Lysistrata; but the frank coarseness
proper to ARISTOPHANES becomes mere
vulgarity when modified to meet the
requirements of Teuton provincialism.
These things, once again, are managed
better in France.
There were some pleasant, if obvious,
touches of half-serious comedy between
one pair of separatists (played sympa-
thetically by Mr. CHARLEs BRYANT and
Miss EDYTH LATIMER), but much of
the rest was rather second-rate fun,
like the stuff you get in a musical
comedy, only without the music.
What humour there was arose for the
most part out of fairly commonplace
situations, and seldom belonged to
the dialogue as such. Surely it is
late, at this time of day, to repeat
the hallowed wheeze—“ls life worth
living 2 That depends on the liver”;
| or the ancient scintillation about the
route to a man's heart lying through
his stomach. -
Mr. CHARLES BRYANT was an attrac-
tive figure, and I freely forgive him
his palpable imitation of the vocal
methods of the lessee of the Criterion.
I wonder if Sir CHARLEs WYNDHAM,
| looking down from his box with grave,
| veteran air at the stage that has been
the scene for him of so many triumphs,
recognised the echo of his own voice.
Miss ELLIs JEFFREYs was wasted
upon her surroundings; and if Miss
| Rosin A FILIPPI as a mother-in-law
| found herself in the picture the credit
is due to the accommodating qualities
of her art. Mr. KENNETH. Douglas,
always very much at his ease, seemed
to take more interest than usual in his
part, treating it less like a passable
private joke between himself and the
other actors. He was quite good in his
scenes with the one unmarried girl of
the piece, played by Miss LETTICE
FAIRFAx, who had her happy moments,
though she did what she could to
handicap herself with her photographic
smile. Mr. DENTON was usefully
employed to bring down the first two
curtains; and Mr. PAUL ARTHUR was
well in his element, and we had better
leave it at that. 3
There was one gentleman, rather
amateurish, who played the part of a
moral prig, and, was described as a
lecturer on BRowNING. This must be
an original inspiration on the part of
Herr LEO DITRICHSTEIN, the adapter,
and I recommend him next time to
choose some more likely poet for the
encouragement of milk - and - water
orthodoxy.
As for the scene, I never quite made
out where we were. It was always the

same room of a private house known
as Rosedale, in the provinces, with a
staircase leading out of it into vague
regions beyond. People kept going up
and down it, no one knew whither or
whence. Everybody seemed to come
and stay in the house whenever it
occurred to them, and I shall never
understand how this very middle-class
establishment contrived to shelter at
any one time such an astonishing col-
lection of married supers. -

OBSERVATIONS ON SKI-ING.
THEY call us the Suicides' Club, and
Meyer, the one German in our hotel, |
distractedly hovers about the American ||
Bar buttonholing people and trying to
induce them to expound the etymology ||
of the name. Until he came to
Wengen a week ago, Meyer flattered
himself that he understood English.
Now he perceives that the tongue
possesses pitfalls whereof his Berlitz ||
professor left him unwarned. Why is
the beginners' ski-ing class universally |
known as the Suicides' Club? Why |
should the easiest ski-ing slope in
Helvetia be characterised as the Death
Trap 2 And why is Meyer, when he [
seeks enlightenment on these palpable
confusions of thought—why, oh why, [.
is he a Nut 2
Meyer, who fondly imagined that he
had conquered the chief entanglement
of our language when he learnt to say
“awfully,” is rather resentful. His
sojourn at Wengen will, however, not ||
be barren of profit, for he will be able |
to return to Potsdam and baffle his
friends (who only know “awfully” and
“old fellow") with the latest correct
Anglicisms. As thus: “You are, old
fellow, awfully a Nut.” Or; “When
I in the Berner Oberland was, I joined
the Suicide-Club of Ski-Laufing and at
the Death Trap to run learned.” -
As for the Death Trap, it is (as Meyer
has ventured to point out) perhaps the
only undulation in Switzerland where
the ski-ing novice could not break his;
neck even if he tried. That is why
(no, Meyer cannot see it!) the Suicides’
Club have chosen it as their meeting-
|place.-- Here we stagger up, up; up,
and here we reel down, down, down;
and here, when we have pirouetted on:
to our noses, we announce that we
have practically executed a Telemark.
Here, also, the slackers sit in a row on
a fence with their Kodaks and hoot
at us. “
The ski is a wanton and freakish
implement of human progress. When
you are lurching along the level one

boots. When you totter down a hill
the skis are boards to which your boots |
are strapped. It is a delicate distinc-
tion. I have tried several pairs of
skis. They were all proficient at ski-
ing; but I was not. As I told Meyer:
(who gives you quite a good cigar if you;
will talk English with him), what I'
wanted was a pair of skis which had
to begin at the beginning—skis which
had to learn. These skis knew how to
ski already, and they ski-ed energetic-
ally whenever I should have preferred
to remain in a dignified repose. They
could do Christiania Turns, they could

brake and herring-bone. And they did
all these before I could stand upright.
Sometimes they started doing them the
minute I took them out of their shed
and laid them down on the snow pre-
paratory to buckling them on. One
of my skis performed a magnificent
run down to the hairdresser's last
Sunday while I was looking for my
ski-pole in the hotel porch. I couldn't
have ski-ed down to the hairdresser's
to save my life, much less to show off
before the lunchers in the verandah.
“Wat is it—to “show off'?” asked
Meyer. “Oh, to put on side, you
know; to swank. Yes, I don't mind
if I do have another of your cigars.
They’re very sound—top hole, in fact.”
“Wat is it—' top hole' 8" “Top hole?
Oh, that's the place where the bit comes
from that you cut off at the end.”
It is disgustingly bad manners of
these skis to be so uppish. Skates
don't behave like that. You never saw
a Mount Charles, left by itself on the
edge of the rink, hop off on to a
rocker. And when you have put on
your skates they don't start cutting
threes and things. They wait for you
to tell them that your ankles are feeling
in the mood this morning for a little
inside-edge. These skis take the bit
between their toes without the slightest
sympathy for their rider. When I
have floundered to the top of the Death
Trap I say, “Now I'll pause to get my
breath and to look at the cloud-shadows
on the Jungfrau.” Not a bit of it!
My skis have no soul for cloud-shadows.
They respond, “Nonsense; we'll jab
the old fellow who is lying on his back
in that drift down there.” In ten
seconds, sure enough, they have jabbed
him. And I, who have followed, pro-
testing indignantly, am blamed ! In
vain I point back up the slope, where
my track is marked by (1) my dropped
eye-glasses, (2) my cap, (3) my tobacco-
pouch, (4) my pipe, (5) its dottle, and
(6) a spot of my gore. The jabbed
gentleman is unconvinced. My aim
has been too unerring. No mere tyro,
he insists, could have achieved such
a fine shot. And, in truth, no mere
tyro has. My skis have been at it for
years.
I am persuaded that the construction
of skis should receive the attention of
some humane reformer. Instead of
being so preposterously polished under-
neath they should have hob-nails.
The Hob-Nailed Ski—that is my idea.
In process of time friction would wear
down the nails; and when the neo-
phyte had mastered the art his skis
would be smooth enough for anything.
On the up-hill journey the hob-nailed
ski would be perfection. With the
present absurd slithery skis you can

never prophesy, when you take a step,
whether it is going to be forward or

the hob-nailed skis' rate of progress
would afford you leisure to enjoy the
beauties of the scenery and to laugh at

But they are very conservative here
at Wengen. Meyer is the only man

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. WALTER Sichel's discovery of The Glenbervie
Journals (CoNSTABLE) was not quite so happy a find as
that of The Creevey Papers. Their period is pretty much
the same as that through which CREEvey lived, plotted,
and wrote his diary. All unconscious of rivalry as a
chronicler Lord GLENBERVIE had an instinctive dislike of
CREEvey, whom he refers to as “the accusateur officieur
who tried to obtain eminence (unsuccessful attempt") by
personalities in the absence of the parties concerned.”
Lord GLENBERVIE, having a wide acquaintance among
public men, had not the gift his contemporary was
endowed with of making his surroundings interesting.
He was, to tell the truth, a dull man. The sentence
quoted gives some indications of his literary style. His
journal, written chiefly at the -–
hounds, while beside him sported on the green of the Irish
hunting-field his little sister Josephine, disguised as his
first whip by breeches and boots and the wearing of the
pink. At this point I confess that I very nearly went
home. I couldn't see even Miss WESTA TILLEY carrying
out this part of the imposture with success. However,
I knew that Irish bullfinches are often not so stiff as
they look. So I crammed my hat over my eyes and
scrambled over somehow, and was rewarded by a rattling
run after the two Herrings, with some very pretty love-
making thrown in when we all came home tired from
hunting. And if you have a taste for sport and Irish
ways and scenery and pleasant people and a happy ending
I advise you to follow my example. I ought to add that
Tinker was the fifth part of the only other pack besides
the Mullenboden which Derrick had ever hunted, and that
he saved Josephine from drowning when she met with the
inevitable accident by which her sex was at last revealed.
Since reading Master and
uncongenial hour between six
and seven in the morning, is
through many pages as dreary
as if the work he was engaged
upon was the posting up of
the family laundry-book. Still
here and there we catch a pleas-
ant glimpse of how people lived
in the good old days. Such an
one is presented in the story
told by Lord MALMESBURY how
in the year 1774 the Duc de
BIRoN came from Versailles to
Berlin on a secret commission,
and Lord MALMEsBURY lodged
him in his house for a twelve-
month, “during which he
thought he was outwitting his
host, who found easy means of
reading all his despatches and
taking copies of such parts as
he chose.” Lord GLENBERVIE
makes no comment on this
domestic arrangement, which
seems to have been up to date.

Now Derrick, junior, was rather hard up, and instead of
sending the letter back, in which case Miss DoRothBA

readily believe this. We tried the pro-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH.
[In a leader, entitled “Imagination and Fact,” The Daily Chronicle
remarks that “anybody who looks at all closely at the Tory papers
must be struck by some curious things just now ; ” and, having developed
this general observation with comments upon certain feats of political
fancy, issues the following authoritative statement: “Thus are imagi-
nation and facts at strife. When it comes to the test of the division
lobbies the facts will win.”]
NURSED on opinion of the looser kind,
Fed up with foolish talk and vacant tracts,
How oft it eases my Platonic mind
To think on regions where they know the Facts;
To feel that somewhere on Olympian heights,
Within a zone of perfect calm located,
Mocking Imagination's mortal flights,
Stands the abode of Truth Unmitigated.
So in our little world of party feuds,
Where daedal Fancy takes her chartered fling,
And everyone portentously intrudes
His own perversion of the Actual Thing,
How well it is, when politicians urge
Each man his private fiction like a hobby,
To pause serenely till the Facts emerge
From the infallible Division-Lobby.
While some will tell you how the recent poll
Condemned a rotten Peerage to the axe,
And some, who claim to read the People's soul,
Say that it turned upon the tummy-tax —
While thus Conjecture rides the vast inane
Waſted by various Fancy-made propellers,
I trust to Truth to make the matter plain -
When she conveys the verdict through her “tellers.”
None else can say just what the Public meant;
None but the speaking Truth can tell us why
With such precise exactitude they sent
The two great Parties back to make a tie;
Look to the Lobby, when the bells ring out!
Though Falsehoods meanwhile flourish for a wee bit,
ELIBANK is her prophet; he don't doubt
Magna est Veritas et praevalebit. O. S.
The New Coinage.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-You have before now hurt the sacred
feelings of some of your Scots clients by wrongly referring
to the inhabitants of Great Britain as “the English.” It
may please you therefore to have your attention called to a
letter in a Radical journal of Jan. 12, where the writer
pleads against the use of a dead language on our new
coins. “Is not the English language,” he asks, “more
widely spoken, and has it not a greater literature than any
other”? (I should not dare to answer the second riddle,
but as for the first I am very nearly sure that the English
language is more widely spoken than Latin or any other
dead language.), “Latin,” he continues, “is all right in
its proper place, but when it obtrudes itself on our modern
English coinage it becomes an absurd anomaly.” I
italicize the word “English,” because the letter is signed
“DEI GRA. HIELAN’ LADDI.E.” It almost looks as if the
writer might be a Scot. What do you think?

She. I told you all about it, but I suppose you didn't

it? A goose is such a rum bird to carve.
She. My dear Charles, you've always told me you were
a sort of heavy-weight championship carver.

with the knife.) This is easier than I thought. There!
I've cut you two of the daintiest slices I've ever seen.
She. Don't forget the stuffing.
He. Good heavens ! Stuffing!
She. Don't be absurd, Charles. -
He. Can nobody tell a gentleman where a goose keeps
its stuffing? I suppose I must chance it. (He does.)
Wrong, of course. What a mercy there's only one other
end. (He gets at the stuffing and inserts a spoon.) Here's
stuffing for the million. It's more exciting than digging
for diamonds. My, what a bird this is for stuffing! I
must say it's extremely creditable to you and cook to
choose a bird like that. You might have picked a goose
without any stuffing at all, and where should we have been

He. That's a nice thing to say to a man when he's
doing his best. I'm all among the legs and wings now, so
I mustn't be hurried. This looks like a wing, but where's
its joint? (He begins to perform feats of strength with the
carving-knife.) I take back everything I said in praise of

AN UNDESIRABLE ALIEN.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Now that Public Opinion is being so
very much exercised as to the wisdom of allowing foreign
undesirables to use our tight little island as a refuge, don't
you think, Sir, that this would be an admirable opportunity
to get something done with regard to that most undesirable
of all aliens, our Weather?
As far as I can make out, Sir, we have no weather of
our own—at least, if we have, it never gets a chance to show
itself, being quite overshadowed by these abominable foreign
importations. Whenever I look at the weather reports I
find something like this: “The Scandinavian cyclonic
disturbance is advancing rapidly in the direction of the
British Isles, while the Icelandic depression is already
encroaching on our northern shores,” or “The deep cyclonic |
system which is at present centring in the southern part
of these islands has travelled over from Siberia, and may
be expected to increase in severity for some days.”
Now why should we put up with these foreign mis-
creants any longer? Why should our island be the popular
resort of every meteorological desperado in two continents?
Their own countries won't stand them, that's evident. And
there is good reason to suppose that they never display
their full malevolence until they reach us. Other places
have their little climatic trials, I admit; but though the
behaviour of these disturbances and depressions is bad
enough over there to merit their immediate expulsion by the
clear-headed foreigner they reserve their most fiendish out-
rages for British soil. We offer them a refuge and they
repay us with the blackest treachery.
No, Sir, the strictest regulations must be drawn up to
prevent this abuse of hospitality. Let every doubtful de-
pression and disturbance that fails to guarantee a reasonable
modicum of sunshine per diem be resolutely deported back
to the country of origin. What we want is Protection; we
must refuse to be the climatic dumping-ground of Europe.
For I am old-fashioned enough to believe, Sir, that, given a
clear field, we ourselves could manufacture here in England
all the weather that is required for home consumption.
Whatever the results of our first unskilled attempts, they
couldn't very well be any worse than these imported
specimens. With “British Weather for British Consumers
and Down with Foreign Depressions” as our battle-cry,
Yours, etc., PATRIOT.

G.RAY's BREAKs LEAD to TROUBLE.
AUSTRALIAN FURY.
THE spectacle of the classic and
superb Diggle (who has recently
beaten STEvenson by several thousand
points) being kept in his seat for two
whole sessions (défense de rire) while
GEORGE GRAY, the Australian marvel
of eighteen, was compiling more re-

With such a record behind them the
Billiard authorities naturally would not
have shrunk for a moment from tack-
ling young GEORGE GRAY and the red
losers, had it not been for one thing.

to the stroke, to appease
DIGGLE and to pacify the
warlike sons of an outraged
Commonwealth.
But, first, what is the
stroke? Well, it is quite
simple. It is merely going
in off the red into one or
other of the middle pockets
and then doing it again and #:
again until you do it oftener
than any one else and your
father kisses you to a pulp.
We can all make the stroke,
but it has never occurred to
us—not even to our profes-
sionals — to go in for so
much of it. One or two, and
then the ordinary amateur-
you or I—turns to other and
more attractive fields of
action, to the cannon, to the
white loser, to the failure to
score, and even to the miss-
cue. Our game is varied;
the boy GRAY's is monoto-
nous. Clever he may be, but .
tedious and tiresome. And
think of DIGGLE seated there
with his chin on his knees
for four long hours; and

better than any number off

Madame Ada Crossley.
I regard the proposal of the
Billiards Control as an act
of treason against the South-

ness that the first word ought
to be spelled with two b's.
Lord Dudley.
I am prepared to withdraw
my resignation if by so doing
I can in any way support my
friend GEorge GRAY against
this attempt to impair his
supremacy.
Mr. Richard Jebb.
This is worse than the
thing, of course, had to be
| done. Billiards was threatened ; our
best professionals made to look foolish.
It is not the first time the authorities
have had to act. There was a stroke
once called the push. Where is it
now 2 To be found in its perfection
one must seek the giddy haunts of
bagatelle. There was a stroke called
the spot. A little man named PEALL
used to make it. His head just ap-
peared above the table, but he could
make the stroke for ever, and since
this shot, too, injured the game as a
whole it had to go. Then came the
anchor, and that also had to go, but
not before REECE had made nearly a
quarter of a million points from it at
the top end in the watches of many
nights, while the reporters slept in
young kangaroo's wings? Would any
of the Billiards Control gentlemen be
safe? Think of the boomerang, how

lethal | The cassowſry champagne,

Deciding, therefore, that it was best
to feel the pulse of Antipodean opinion
before taking too decisive action, a
number of cablegrams to prominent
Australians and Australophils, with
answers prepaid up to a reasonable
amount (considering Australian elo-
quence), were sent out by the Associa-
tion. The replies are subjoined:

one of our glories. My only regret is
that he is right-handed.

“The Australian's magnificent effort ter.

own ball, to screw into the top pocket.”—Daily
Mail.
With only his opponent's ball to play
with he ought to have had no difficulty
in getting it into any pocket.
“Quite an epidemic of burglary and house-
breaking appears to be raging in London, no
fewer than four cases coming before the
magistrates in various courts.”—Royal Corn-
wall Gazette.

LITTLE PLAYS FOR AMATEURS.
The difficulty of finding suitable
one-Act plays for country house thea-
tricals has often been commented upon.
The real trouble, however, is not that
there is a scarcity of such plays, but
that there are too many of them. But
while there are many plays there are
not more than half-a-dozen types, and
it is felt that if the choice of the
amateur impresario were restricted to
single examples of these plays he
would, without losing anything of
artistic value, be a considerable gainer
in the matter of time. We propose,
therefore, to indicate, once and for all,
the types at his disposal.

An aged man,
Still hearty and still hale,
A simple swain from out the West,
What should he know of gaol? .
He had a rustic woodland air,
He plied his humble art
On uplands where the hinds prepare
Sheep for the mutton mart.
He loved his flock, he knew them all,
Nor lost them, like Bo-Peep,
And to his side by name could call
Each individual sheep.
One day, when after work he stood
Beside an old church door,
He found a little box of wood,
'Twas labelled, “For the Poor.”
Within the box, as he could see,
A silver florin lay,
“The Poor," he cried; “nay, that
means me,”
And took the coin away.
And so because, o'ercome by ale,
He took what wasn't his'n,
For thirteen years, so ran the tale,
They shut him up in prison.
Far from the sheep he loved so well,
Companioned by despair,
They left him in a narrow cell
With nought but prison fare.
At last two gentlemen came by
Of credit and renown,
Seeking a good election-cry,
From famous London town.
Kind hearts are more than coronets,
And many a time and oft
Their tears had flowed in rivulets,
For, oh, their hearts were soft.
A soldier's coat the one had worn,
A lawyer's robe the other,
And now, in loyal friendship sworn,
. They joined to help their brother.
The soldier sighed; “Foul shame,” he
cried;
“And yet I think,” said he,
“This tale of woe may serve to
show
Our famous clemency.”
“I grieve to see,” the lawyer wept,
“This poor old shepherd's vile end;
I fear this scandal can't be kept
From my good friends at Mile End."
For months and months they thought
it o'er,
To be or not to be ;
Then opened wide the prison door
And set the Shepherd free.
In Wales a nice retreat was found
Where he might come and go,
Though ere he left it he was bound
To let his patrons know.
On Saturday his toil began,
On Sunday where was he?
Ask it of those who made the plan,
The plan to set him free.
Where did that gentle shepherd go,
And how shall end our tale 2
I rather trow that we shall know
When he comes back to gaol.
For there 'tis plain we'll see again
This man from Dartmoor (Devon),
Whose toll of years was thirty-eight
Of prison-service to the State,
The rest but twenty-seven.

AT A FootBALL MATCH.
ARound the ropes the tumult swayed
On rows of myriad feet,
The stands were packed with those that
paid
A shilling for a seat,
And faces blue and faces red,
And wild eyes starting from the head,
Confessed some little heat.
And now from every side arose
Full many a voice to prime
Their friends to newer zeal, their foes
To play the game (or gime),
While sounding threats, extremely free,
To scrag the whistling referee
Assailed the thick sublime.
And I, too, though of sober mood,
Letting my zeal outrun
Discretion, bellowed, howled and booed,
And carried on like fun;
Till suddenly, thou thing of Awe,
I lifted up my gaze, and saw
Thy face, majestic One.
From thy high gable near the roof
Thou gazed'st on the show
Supremely, icily aloof
From them that raged below;
While they, with puny fires, waxed hot,
Time's very flight concerned thee not,
Thou didst not even go.
Alone above that purpled crowd
Thy face was all unflushed,
Where every other voice was loud,
Thine, thine alone, was hushed.
There, while the world beneath thee
raved,
Thou wert the one thing well-behaved;
I really felt quite crushed.
And, gazing on thine awful face,
Upon my spirit came
A numbing sense of dull disgrace,
A sudden chill of shame;
The moments passed unheeded by,
The sport concerned me not, though I
Had money on the game.
In vain I strove to keep my glance
Fixed on that paltry fray;
Thy grave unsmiling countenance
Seemed somehow to convey
A mute contempt, a settled scorn
Too righteous to be tamely borne—
I had to go away.
O Clock, O cold and self-serene,
Bitter it was to see
How low that unbecoming scene
Appeared to one like Thee;
And sad—O grave and lucid brow-
To think that we were Britons, Thou
Wast made in Germany.
DUM-DUM.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
WAS JULIUS CAESAR EVER IN
LONDON ?
DEAR SIR,--Permit me to settle this
vexed question once and for all. A few
years ago there was, in the neighbour-
hood of Herne Hill—and it may still
be there if a criminal disregard for
historic monuments has not allowed it
to fall into decay—a neat and attractive
erection bearing the inscription, JULIUS
CAESAR SUMMER House, and some
reference to rustic work which, being
extraneous, I have now forgotten.
GARRICK, we know, had a villa at
, Hampton, Pope a grotto at Twicken-
ham, BRUCE a castle at Tottenham,
HADRIAN a villa in Northumbria, and
so on. The interesting relic in South
London not only establishes the fact of
CAESAR's presence, but indicates that
in the early days of the Roman occu-
pation it was customary to have a
period of summer here in our metro-
polis. Yours faithfully,
Historicus.
SIR,-JULIUS CAESAR never visited
London. WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE lived
on the spot 300 years nearer his time,
so that he was in a better position
to form an accurate judgment. Yet
SHAkspeaRE makes no reference to the
alleged incident, and he was a writer
of great distinction, and generally
accurate with regard to historical detail.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw, who also at one
time resided on the spot, has written a
play on the same subject. Mr. SHAw is
fully capable of making up his history
as he goes along, and the fact that he
never invented this myth shows that
he did not think it worth inventing.
The public and the press have—as
usual—got the thing wrong. In the
present case they have probably con-
ſused some hazy recollection of Sir
JULIUS CAESAR's tomb in the City with
something, inaccurately related, which
they have recently misread about the
Cato Street conspiracy.
Yours truly, ADELPHIAN.
MY DEAR SIR,-Possibly the solution
of this burning question is to be found,
not so much by examining local evi-
dence as in the conscientious study of
the conditions which existed in the
palmy era of Rome's ascendency. In
this connection there is no more agree-
able way of acquiring the necessary
information than in the perusal of
'sound literature, dealing—frequently in
the palatable guise of wholesome fiction
—with the period concerned. Here I
am reminded of a little work which
was received very favourably by the
press (The Clackfeldy Herald said, I
think, “Painstaking . . . and displays
. . . signs of . . . ability).” It is called,
if I remember the title rightly, “Thumbs
Down / or, Ave, Caesar ! ” The author
has evidently made the epoch the subject
of close study and much thought, and
—being entirely disinterested—I can
warmly recommend the volume (it
flashes across my mind that it is pub-
lished at 6/-, with the usual discount)
to those who are fond of dwelling on
the times that have passed away for
aye. Yours most sincerely,
W. CRUMMLEs.

For 'tis you that I am needing,
And my tender heart is bleeding
For your love that is so sweet.
Wake and hurry with your toilet,
Little bonnie girlie mine,
Ere the petals of the violet”
Wither in the noonday shine.
Lo! the world its best apparel
Has ecstatically donned,
And the song-birds raise their carol
In your honour, Hildegonde;
And the kindly cows are mooing
As the cud they're gently chewing,
And the cuckoos are cuckooing
And the merry lambkins bleat.
Come and listen to my pleading,
For 'tis you that I am needing,
And my tender heart is bleeding
For your love that is so sweet.

THE NOVEL OF THE SEASON.
It was Jones who began it by saying
excitedly, “Of course you've read Pink
Poppies, the book of the publishing
season, that everybody's going crazy |
over ?” I said, “No ; do tell me about
it,” and Jones gave me a résumé of the
plot, which, as he said, was a remark-
ably fine one, and described the cha-
racters, all (it seemed) wonderfully inte-
resting, and yet exactly like the people
one meets in everyday life; but there
was a something more about the book,
an atmosphere which had to be expe-
rienced to be believed, which it was
impossible for him to attempt to com-
municate. I yawned and said I would
read it. -
The lady whom I took in to dinner
the same evening almost immediately
opened fire with, “Of course you've
read Pink Poppies 2 What do you
feel about it?” And I (I hope I may
be forgiven) told a pink lie, and
answered, “Isn't it splendid?" adding
hurriedly, “but I would rather know
what you think of it.” So I got
a second account of Pink Poppies, in
which the characters (and even the
plot) seemed rather different but none

the less beautiful and stimulating.
Human nature, after all, is full of these
inconsistencies, and it was now that it
began to dawn on me what a wonder-
ful book Pink Poppies must be. Later
on in the drawing-room. I managed to
obtain a third synopsis from another
lady (some of the characters seemed to
have altered their names in the mean-
time, but that, too, has been known to
occur in real life), and I began to find
myself taking strangely individual
views about the heroine, and differing
from the ordinary opinion about the
great emotional crisis of her life.
After that I read eagerly all the
newspaper reviews of Pink Poppies,
and they all agreed in praising it,
though all for quite different reasons;
other people also insisted on discussing
Pink Poppies with me and growing
enthusiastic about it until gradually
out of the mist of warring motives and
changing events there grew up in my
mind a clear and beautiful memory:
Pink Poppies became a part of my
life, and I could more readily have
borne the death of either of my great-
uncles than the loss of the new friends
I found in its pages. I became an
authority on Pink Poppies, and was
celebrated as one who knew its hero
more intimately and appreciated his
mental struggles better than anybody
else. I began to see the world through
pink spectacles, and whenever I met
Jones I would thank him effusively for
being the first to introduce me to the
book.
I have not yet read Pink Poppies,
and I shall never bring myself to do so
now, for I feel sure I should be horribly
disillusioned.
A LOVE-SON G.
(Out of Season.)
HER name is merely Sarah Cooke;
She's not so bad a wench ;
She knits and sews and even knows
A smattering of French;
And, what is more, her father's on
The local petty bench.
Her wit is of the nature which
Not frequently expands,
But, when it rips, produces quips
Which no one understands;
She has, as all her friends admit,
A useful pair of hands.
Her teeth remind observant folk
Rather of gold than pearls;
Her hair is sound and hedged around
With artificial curls;
Her eyes (a greyish-greenish-brown)
Are much as other girls'.
Her singing voice is strong and large,
She has a powerful throat;
Her hats suggest the cheaply dressed,
Her boots suggest the vote;
And she is undefeated by
The longest table d'hôte.
Her waist is of the size that most
Suggests security;
Her competence is not immense;
Her age is forty-three;
I cannot say what makes me think
She is the girl for me.
From the Secretary of the Victoria
and Albert Museum :
“Sir, –I am directed to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter received yesterday which
will receive attention.”
This is one of those letters which
cannot be dictated off-hand, demanding
as they do the leisure of the study for
their composition.

[JANUARY 18, 1911.
WHEN WE ALL HAD A THOUSAND A YEAR I
I can't say for certain, but I suppose the sportsman who
happened to be Prime Minister at the time must have been
a bit on the Socialist side. Anyhow, he'd brought in a
Bill for providing every grown-up male and female with a
thousand a year for life. If anyone had more than that
already, the State would collar the surplus—but nobody
was to have less.
Which was fair enough all round. For, as he put it, a
thousand a year was as much as the richest required for all
but purely artificial luxuries, while on such an income the
poorest would be enabled to lead a cultured existence in
hygienic surroundings. -
Where all these incomes were to come from I have
forgotten now, but I know that the financial side of the
scheme, as he explained it, was as simple as shelling peas.
But of course the Nation had to be consulted first, and so
the Bill was referred to a Poll of the People. The People
seemed quite to take to the idea—the Bill was passed by an
overwhelming majority amidst the 'wildest enthusiasm.
Possibly the fact that the number of voters with an
income approaching a thousand a year was comparatively
insignificant helped to make it popular. I myself was a
clerk in one of the Government offices, and my own income,
from all sources, just reached six hundred. ... But, although
a bachelor and with no very expensive tastes, I found I
generally exceeded it. An extra four hundred a year would
leave me quite a comfortable margin. So of course I voted
for the Bill. -
| As soon as it became Law my first step was to send in my
resignation to my Chief. I didn't see any sense in going on
| drudging from ten to five when I should be getting more
than three times my salary for doing nothing. And a lot
of other fellows felt the same. All the shopkeepers, for
instance, retired promptly. What with Competition and
Bad Seasons and incessant General Elections, they said, it
had been as much as they could do to make anything like
a thousand a year. Now that that income was assured to
| them under any circumstances, it simply wasn't good
enough to remain in business, especially if the profits
were to go to the State | The streets were an extra-
ordinary sight, with every tradesman in such a hurry to
clear that he was positively forcing his stock on anyone
whom he could get to carry it away for nothing. I
remember that, in the course of a short stroll through
with a patent carpet-cleaner, an earthenware filter, a cut
crystal chandelier, a calf's head, and a tray of glass eyes,
none of which I really required, but the people were
so pressing that it would have been downright rude to
refuse.
F. Most of these articles I managed to shed as I went
along, but I was not allowed to return empty-handed.
There must have been some which I hadn't the moral
courage to deposit on anyone's doorstep, or I could
hardly have arrived at my rooms with a hair-dresser's
dummy under one arm and a large gilded cow from
a model dairy under the other. And when I got in
I had an unpleasant surprise. My landlady informed me
that she would be obliged by my finding other rooms as
soon as possible. “The girl,” whose father had been
employed as a road-sweeper by a District Council, had
departed to live at home in ease and affluence, and Mrs.
Simcox did not feel equal to cooking for and waiting on me
single-handed. Besides, as her husband's and son's joint
incomes would, with her own, now amount to three
thousand a year, it was clearly beneath their dignity to let
lodgings.
I tried to get rooms elsewhere, but without suecess.
I couldn't see a single fanlight that exhibited a placard
with “Apartments.” I suppose it was only what I
might have expected. But what I own I hadn't been
prepared for was the unanimity with which all classes
were giving up their previous occupations. Even profes-
sional criminals decided that honesty on a thousand a year
was infinitely preferable to small and precarious gains with
the risk of imprisonment. And a good thing they did, too,
because every constable in the force had chucked his job
already. But so had the Railway Servants, and the Post-
men, and, in short, all the sort of people one had come to
depend on. It was most inconvenient to the Public, of
course, and beastly selfish and inconsiderate into the
bargain—but there was no arguing with the beggars!
They'd only worked because they were obliged to, they
said; now they were independent, and would see the
Public blowed before they'd do another stroke 1
Still, we might have got along without them, somehow.
What really upset us was the discovery that all the
Butchers and Bakers and Provision Dealers generally had
closed their shutters and set up as country gentlemen in
suburban villas, as they could now well afford to do. As
we had to have food, the Prime Minister ordered them all
to come back at once and sell it to us. This they politely
declined to do, unless they were permitted to pocket all the
profits on their trading. Which, of course, would have
knocked the bottom out of the Prime Minister's financial
arrangements, so he wouldn't and couldn't give way on
the point. At least, not until there were riots and some
pressure was put on him; then he explained that the Govern-
ment had never intended to discourage individual enter-
prise. So in a very short time business was going on
as briskly as ever. Only, somehow or other, everything
seemed to cost ever so much more than it used to. It is
true that wages were higher—a fellow who has a thousand
a year already has to be paid pretty handsomely before he'll
take on any job—but I fancy prices must have gone up
higher still. Whether the Government had got into arrears'
with the incomes, or whether even a thousand a year was
no longer enough for the barest necessaries is more than I.
can tell you. All I do know is that things had come to
such a pass with me that I was just in the act of debating.

to get taken on at the Docks as a “casual” for a paltry,

UNAPPRECIATED TALENT.
Sportsman (without enthusiasm, watching recent purchase). “BRILLIANT HUNTER, FAST, JUMP ANYTHING, STAY For EveR.”
SNAPSHOT LITERATURE.
SPEAKING on the importance of
economising odd moments of time,
Mr. W. E. HARVEY, M.P. for Roch-
dale, the other day stated that he had
read nearly the whole of Shakspeare
whilst shaving and putting on his collar.
Earnest frequenters of Paternoster Row
and other students of English litera-
ture will accordingly be gratified to
learn that the idea is being developed for
their benefit. We are promised, during
the forthcoming publishing season, a
“Dressing-table Gibbon” in 6,500 half-
page leaflets, crown octavo, long primer
type, printed only on one side and tied
together by the top left-hand corner,
so as to be hung on the corner of the
looking-glass. The operator, therefore,
will not need to squint very badly
while directing his razor with one eye
and improving his classical knowledge
with the other. This edition should
last him nearly eighteen years, using a
leaflet each day.
We hear also of the “Wash-stand
Waverley Novels,” divided into 10,958
sections on celluloid tablets, impervious
to soapsuds and not liable to º:
by water. This is calculated to supply
the studious time - economiser with
masterpiece - instalments for thirty
years exactly (counting leap-years),
while he is, or should be, busy at the
same time with his ablutions and teeth-
cleaning.
Another highly improving produc-
tion is the “Coat-rack Milton,” to be
issued with a single line on each page,
and capable of being fastened upright
on the wall of a vestibule or front hall.
The diligent bank-clerk or the intel-
lectual shop-walker, it is estimated,
will just have time to master a single
line of Paradise Lost as he seizes his
hat and dives into his great-coat pre-
vious to rushing forth to catch the train.
A line a day will see his lifetime out.
“The Tube-lift Tennyson Poster”
offers culture to those soaring (or de-
scending) souls who would otherwise
be wasting the daily ten seconds of
their journey up from, or down to, the
depths of the earth. There is also the
“Strip-Kipling Ticket,” providing six
verses, one for each secular day of the
week.
TO A TERRIER.
CRIB, on your grave beneath the chest-
nut boughs
To-day no fragance falls nor summer air,
Only a master's love who laid you
there
Perchance may warm the earth 'neath
which you drowse
In dreams from which no dinner gong
may rouse,
Unwakeable, though close the rat may
dare,
Deaf, though the rabbit thump in play-
ful scare,
Silent, though twenty tabbies pay their
WOWs.
And yet mayhap, some night when
shadows pass,
And from the fir the brown owl hoots
on high,
That should one whistle 'neath a
favouring star
Your small white shade shall patter o'er
the grass,
Questing for him you loved o' days gone
y,
Ere Death the Dog-Thief carried you
afar !

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
GoLDwiN SMITH, whose Reminiscences (MACMILLAN) have
been skilfully edited by Mr. ARNOLD HAULTAIN, was a
Superior Person, even to a fuller extent than HoRSMAN
reached, or a more modern instance has attained. Looking
around him, commentating on men and matters, he found
little that was good. His memory of the Duke of WEL-
LINGTON is limited to the veteran's appearance in connec-
tion with the Oxford Commission appointed by Lord JoHN
RUssell, when “he seemed to proclaim his inauguration
by making false quantities in reading his Latin speech and
wearing his Academical cap wrong side before.” Lowell
he dismisses in a word. Of EMERSoN he writes: “I heard
him read his own poetry aloud, but it remained as obscure
to me as before.” I note these characteristics without

a tramp enters upon an Odyssey of complete worldly failure ||
and spiritual triumph. In case I have seemed somewhat ||
querulous I had better state that the author held my
interest chained from beginning to end, and that, although
the book is in certain ways carelessly written, and I was
always a little sceptical about the necessity for Frank
Guiseley's complete renunciation of his normal destiny,
there is no doubt that Father BENsoN has a peculiarly
vivid power of pictorial presentment; and I am glad that
he admits (at least in the case of the Yorkshire doctor) the
possibility of earnest devotion outside the pale of his own |
Church; otherwise I should have challenged him to impute
Laodicean tendencies to a Grand Lama, let us say, or a
howling Dervish in his next novel.
Some time back, I put Miss SHEILA KAYE-SMITH in a

He is at his best in his early
reminiscences, where the intel-

mellowed by the memories of
boyhood. Other interesting
passages are found in the
chapter devoted to the American
Civil War. Outside academic

this regard Spell Land was, if

ful strength. Spell Land is

the stingless insults of a coward.” All the same the
sting remained to the end. In his Reminiscences he finds
it as difficult to keep out reference to his old enemy as did
Mr. Dick to avoid allusion to the head of KING CHARLEs
THE FIRST when drafting his memorial. In spite of,
perhaps because of, certain foibles on the part of the
diarist the book is full of interest.
Heretics (and even infidels) may gather some faint gleams
of encouragement from Father BENSON's latest book; for,
though the heroine of Nome Other Gods (HUTCHINsoN), if
indeed I may call her by so flattering a name, jilted her
fiancé with a shamelessness only to be expected from a
girl brought up in the Protestant faith, there is a Cam-
bridge friend of the hero's (of no very definite religious
views) who is really quite a decent fellow; there is an
atheistic doctor in Yorkshire whose devotion to toxins is
recognised as not wholly discreditable, and a young clergy-
man down at the Eton Mission who seems to be doing his
best according to his very inferior lights. None Other Gods
is the story of an undergraduate who suddenly feels that
loves, and Oliver, his rival; and
of the ruinous end in which this love overwhelms them.
The truth of it all is wonderful. At least, this is always
my own feeling for Miss KAYE-SMITH's work. Never for
one moment does one feel that the persons of whom she
writes are characters in a story; all of them are tremen-
dously, even a little frighteningly, alive. It is this which
produces that impression of solidity in her telling of the
simplest episodes. If only sometimes she would laugh a
little. After all, one laughs quite often in real life; and
the fact that it takes no count of this seems to me the
one flaw in work of extraordinary quality.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“MILKY WAY.”—By the Military
Secrets Act it is forbidden to shoot
cows with a kodak on the Island of
Guernsey, but you are at perfect
liberty to pot lobsters on Sark.
“HEDONIST.”—We regret extremely
that we are not in a position to answer
The Daily Chronicle's poignant ques-
tion, “Can any one give the address of
the place where you get mignonette
sauce for oysters?” But orchids can
be got anywhere, and we always wear
one of these simple flowers in our hair
when eating the best Natives.
“PATRIOT.”—We sympathise with
your disapproval of Esperanto. If, as
Bishop WELLDoN anticipates, English
is to be the universal language, then it is
the first duty of every true Englishman
to help forward that great consumma-
tion by speaking nothing but his native
tongue. Every French word you speak
in France, every German word you
speak in Germany, helps to retard the
forward movement and undo the splen-
did work achieved by centuries of de-
voted insularity.
“Historicus.”—Mr. Punch's little
joke," Advice to persons about to marry:
Don't,” was not lifted from CHARLES
READE. It appeared in Punch in 1845,
fourteen years before CHARLEs READE
reproduced it in his French play.
When the historical critic wants to
determine which of two events fol-
lowed the other, it is always a good
plan to ascertain their respective dates.
One date is never really quite enough.
That was the trouble with the gentle-
man in The Academy who said he was
certain that Punch plagiarised from
CHARLEs READE.
“District PAssenger.”—We have
answered your complaint be'ore. On
its platforms the District Railway pro-
vides you with nougat shops and
tobacco emporia; you can't expect them
to supply time-tables too!
“MIDDLE EAST.”—You are right in
supposing that Taurus, the name of
the mountain range which is likely to
prove the only real obstacle to the
German Baghdad Railway, is the Latin
for Bull. But it has no connection
with John Bull. That's the annoying
thing.
“Do M MIGUELITE.”—We are not a
bookie, and we cannot say how far the
odds against the Portuguese Pretender
have increased since his published
interview with The Daily Mail. Have
you tried Lloyds 2
“A LovER of HospitaLITY.”—We
understand you to say that, owing to a
favourable testimonial from a member
of the present Government, you were
acquitted when last charged with
burglary, and you ask whether, an
action for damages would lie against
this Minister on the ground that he
had caused you to be deprived of the
State's hospitality to which you had
grown accustomed. This is a question
for counsel, but we warn you against
forming too sanguine a deduction from
the result of the recent Society slander
case. In regard to the second part of
your letter, you may absolutely trust to
our discretion, just the same as if you
had reposed your confidence in the ear
of Lord SPENCER.
“BRITON.”—Yes, you're all right.
Another First Sea Lord has spoken,
and the “Navy Scare” has once more
been “Exploded" (see Radical Press).
So you can go to sleep again. O. S.
POSTAL INTELLIGENCE.
THoMAs has been trying for about a
week to post an important letter for
his stay-at-home mother. Every morn-
ing she begs him to remember not to
forget it, and every evening he con-
fesses with tears in his eyes that he
has forgotten to remember it. On
Saturday morning she talked to him
seriously about it, and he promised
that, if he could guarantee nothing,
all that human skill and determination
could do should be done. Accordingly
I was called in to help.
2: -: +. + 2:
In the late afternoon we found our-
selves, quite by chance, in one of our
leading post-offices. “They tell me,”
said I, “that there is a miniature of
the late King here which is well
worth seeing.” So we approached the
counter, and were greeted with that
old-world courtesy which one only
finds in the busier post-offices.
“How d'you do?” said Thomas to
the lady behind the counter.
“Nicely, thank you,” she answered.
“Much doing in the postal order
trade 2''
“No-o,” she drawled, leaning her
arms on the counter and gazing
dreamily into space. “People have
not much money nowadays, or if they
have they don't send it to their rela-
tives. However, we must not get de-
pressed, for the post-cards are still
stout. But I beg your pardon ; I dare-
say you want to buy something. I
must not keep you here talking. What
can I show you ?”
“Have you any stamps?” said I.
“Stamps? We have them in stock
size, or we can, if you insist, make
them to measure. About what price
did you want to give 2"
“Money is no object,” declared
Thomas; “it is a question of colour.
I want something that will not clash
with this envelope.”
The letter was produced.
“I suggest, if I may,” and she smiled
with deference at us, “that nothing
goes so well with white as a nice shade
of pink. We have just the thing you
want.” She produced a book and
opened it at the pink page.
“Very nice indeed,” said Thomas
politely, “but these are just a wee bit
common, are they not 2 What about
the rarer tints 2''
Begging the lady's pardon, he leant
across the counter and turned over the
pages of the book.
“Ah!” he exclaimed with sudden
rapture, “this chocolate and blue is
the very thing! Striking and original;
bold and very nearly outré. We will
take one of those.”
She protested that the price was no
less than ninepence, but, as Thomas
explained, ninepence is only ninepence,
and we did not object to the letter
going nine times as fast.
“Shall we send it down for you?”
she asked, tearing one out and preparing
to wrap it up.
“No thanks, I think I will post it,”
said Thomas, licking its back.
“It is a fast colour,” she added,
“and is guaranteed not to shrink in
the wash. Good day.”
2: -: s: + +
Had we taken her hint and gone
then we might have met with more
success in our original venture, but
Thomas declared that it was only polite
to stay and chat a little. When at last
we made our way to Thomas's home,
his mother greeted us with a question
which, he says, is becoming rather
hackneyed.
“Did you post my letter?”
Thomas felt automatically in his
pocket and produced the familiar
envelope.
“Not quite,” he said. “But,” he
added with pride, “we very nearly
did.”
“Dr. Lawrence, M.A., D.C. L., will give 12
lectures on ‘The Making of Modern England
on Friday evening.’”—Devon and Ereter
(Wazete.
The superstitious will say that this
accounts for the motor-omnibus and
the hobble-skirt.
From a catalogue of conjuring
tricks:—
“Two green handke: chieſs are tied together
by the corners, the conjuror simply strokes
them with his empty hand, when they are seen
to change to green. Anyone can do it.”
We seldom believe these statements
about the easiness of a trick, but we
do this time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WAS CLEMENT SHORTER
EVER IN ST. HELENA 3
(From “The Daily Chronicle” of 2011.)
THE mystery long attaching to a
certain event in the life of the famous
littérateur and editor has been, if any-
thing, deepened by an interview with
Mr. Pieter Van Houten Cronjé, the
descendant of the famous Boer General.
Mr. Cronjé, who is an absolute image
of his illustrious forbear, save that he
is so peaceable by nature as to be not
only a vegetarian but to refuse to play
bagatelle with anything but composi-
tion balls (on account of the pain given
him by the thought of the elephant in
the dentist's chair), now lives in hushed
retirement on Balham Common, where
he was yesterday visited by one of the
representatives of The Daily Chronicle.
“Why I sent for you,” he said, “is
because, on going through my ancestor's
papers the other day, I found
but cannot consider evidence yet com-
plete.”
Sir Jowett Nicoll, Bart.: “The dis-
coverer of CHARLoTTE BRONTÉ and
NAPoleoN did so much so well that I
have no doubt he also did St. Helena.”
Mr. Pimpernel Pemberton: “During
a recent visit to St. Helena I was
struck by the extraordinary interest
shown by the inhabitants not only in
the romances of my great-grandfather,
MAx, but also in the calm philosophical
discursions of Sir Robertson NicoLL.
These, with Jane Eyre, are the favourite
reading of the islanders, and since my
great-grandfather was the pet novelist
and NicoLL the most acceptable homi-
list of the great critic I think we
may draw a very natural inference. In
other words, I feel sure that CLEMENT
SHORTER did visit St. Helena. If not,
so much the worse for St. Helena.
And also, if not, where did St. Helena
scholars of European fame have put it
beyond doubt that C. K. S. were the
initials with which this encyclopædic
commentator always signed his hebdo-
madal thunder. Very well, then. Over
the famous signature I found this sen-
tence:—'I am proud to say that it is
my steady privilege to add to my library
the admirable books published by my
old friend, John LoNg. Would that he
published more!’
“Now to the casual eye this is merely
a friendly reference to a publisher, one
of many in the great critic's weekly
letter. But to the eye of a deep student
of the controversy it is something more.
Note the 26th and 27th words in the
sentence. What are they?’ ‘Long’ and
“would.” Put them together and say
them quickly—Longwood. What was
Longwood? The famous house where
NAPOLEoN, CLEMENT SHORTER’s hero,
passed the last years of his life. Surely
this is very significant.”
a letter with some bearing
on the great controversy.
Writing from St. Helena
during the Boer War, while
a prisoner there, my great-
grandfather says, “We are
all well, but very tired of
our captivity. But it will be
better soon, as then [here a
tear in the paper] shorter.'
“That tear,” said Mr.
Cronjé, showing me the
paper yellow with age,
“comes at a very critical
point. The sentence might
read thus: “But it will be
better soon as the nights

IT is said THAT A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD HIS PORTRAIT PAINTED BY
A Post-IMPREssioxist PAID For IT with A Post-IMPRESSION IST CHEQUE.
For want of space we are
forced to exclude the next
eight pages of Mr. BURNs's
letter, in which he amasses
arguments to prove that
CLEMENT SHORTER un-
doubtedly did visit St.
Helena; but we may quote
a table of dates which he
gives by way of fortifying
his position:—

beginning to get longer and they can be
out of doors more. Or, on the other
hand, suppose it ran, “But it will be
better soon as the next boat is bringing
Shorter.” This would mean that the
weary hours were to be cheered by the
brilliant conversation of the London
lion straight from the clubs and
coteries of the capital. Even allowing
for the size of the ‘s’ in ‘shorter,’”
added Mr. Cronjé, “I am disposed to
favour the latter theory and consider
this letter a proof that the English
SAINTE-BEUve really did visit St.
Helena.”
Mr. Cronjé's contribution to the
matter, it is agreed by all those who
are following it, is of importance. In-
deed so valuable did we deem it that
we sent out a proof of the interview to
all the leading savants, asking for their
views. Among the replies which have
reached us are the following:—
Mr. Heinemann Primrose Gosse :
“Should like to think my great-grand-
father's old friend visited St. Helena,
get its very individual literary taste
from # "
We have also received a letter from
Mr. Will Keir Burns, a great-grandson
of a poet-statesman-pugilist of the early
years of the last century, remembered
now chiefly by his defeat of Johnson
in Australia, his public improvisations
of Scotch love-songs in Trafalgar
Square, and his admirable schemes for
providing every unemployed man in
London with a Court-dress. His
descendant, named after two of his
great-grandfather's closest allies, seems
to have made a life-long study of
the great ShoBTER problem, and he
is of opinion that the distinguished
censor and controller of taste was in
St. Helena once, if only for a few
moments—but long enough, of course,
to master its literature and history.
“Looking through an old file of The
Sphere,” writes Mr. BURNs, “I came
upon this sentence in the ‘Literary
Letter' signed C. K. S. But first I would
state that the researches of Trübner,

Upon Professor Meredith Clodd Mr.
BURNs's theory fell like a thunder-bolt.
“Very, very interesting. Profoundly
interesting,” was all that he could say
for some time. “But we must not
trust too much to cryptogrammatic
evidence,” he subsequently remarked
to representatives of the Central News
and Press Association. “Although Mr.
BURNs's discovery goes to support my
fondest hopes, I shall not place undue
reliance upon it. No, I shall not. It
will not appreciably influence the con-
clusions at which I have arrived in my
monograph on the whole matter to be
published in the autumn.”
Perhaps the question may now be left
until that epoch-making work is issued.

YIDDISH FOR POLITICIANs;
OR, THE NEW LIMEHouse.
The Morning Post, in an article upon
Yiddish, shows that the language is a
patois, not difficult to understand for
anyone with a knowledge of German
and English, if Roman characters are
substituted for Hebrew. Our contem-
porary proves this by the following
advertisement quoted from the Teglicher
Yiddish Eapress:—
“Fers. Wir kuifen dsshob Stoks
fun fers for spot kesh,” which is, being
interpreted, “Furs. We buy job stocks
of furs for spot cash.”
With so many naturalised voters in
the East End it would be good strategy
for opportunist Ministers to give an
occasional speech in Yiddish. Some of
the words seem to lend themselves very
happily to the Limehouse method.
We offer a sample:—

“The chiffon frock worn by Mrs. —— was

It must not be supposed that a para-
graph of this kind is admitted into the
columns of the press without the
closest scrutiny. The reporter in the
ordinary way would forward a piece
of the chiffon to the editor, who would
wait for a still clear night (the moon,
of course, being in the last quarter)
to give himself a chance of confirming
the statement before he passed it for

[JANUARY 25, 1911.
LITTLE PLAYS FOR AMATEURS.
II.-‘A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING.”
The scene is a drawing-room (in which
the men are allowed to smoke—or a
smoking-room in which the women
are allowed to draw—it doesn't
much matter) in the house of some-
body orother in the country. George
Turnbull and his old College friend,
Henry Peterson, are confiding in
each other, as old friends will, over
their whiskies and cigars. It is
about three o'clock in the afternoon.
George (dreamily, helping himself to
a stiff soda). Henry, do you remember
that evening at Christ Church College,
five years ago, when we opened our
hearts to each other . . .
Henry (lighting a cigar and hiding it
in a fern-pot). That moonlight evening
on the Backs, George, when I had
failed in my Matriculation examina-
tion ?
George. Yes; and we promised that
when either of us fell in love the other
should be the first to hear of it?
(Rising solemnly.) Henry, the moment
has come. (With shining eyes.) I am
in love.
Henry (jumping up and grasping
him by both hands). Georgel My
dear old George ' (In a voice broken
with emotion) Bless you, George
[He pats him thoughtfully on the
back three times, mods his head
twice, gives him a final grip of the
hand, and returns to his chair.
George (more moved by this than he
cares to show). Thank you, Henry.
(Hoarsely.) You're a good fellow.
Henry (airily, with a typically British
desire to conceal his emotion). Who is
the lucky little lady ?
George (taking out a picture postcard
of the British Museum and kissing it
passionately). Isobel Barley !
[If Henry is not careful he will pro-
bably give a start of surprise here,
with the idea of suggesting to the
audience that he (1) knows some-
thing about the lady's past, or (2)
is in love with her himself. He is,
however, thinking of a different
play. We shall come to that one
in a week or two.
Henry (in a slightly dashing manner).
Little Isobel? Lucky dog
George. I wish I could think so.
(Sighs.) But I have yet to approach
her, and she may be another's.
(Fiercely) Heavens, Henry, if she
should be another's 1
Enter Isobel.
Isobel (brightly). So I've run you to
earth at last. Now what have you
got to say for yourselves?
Henry (like a man). By Jovel (look-
ing at his watch)—I had no idea—is it
really—poor old Joe—waiting
[Dashes out tactfully in a state of
incoherence.
George (rising and leading Isobel to
the front of the stage). Miss Barley,
now that we are alone I have some-
thing I want to say to you.
Isobel (looking at her watch). Well,
you must be quick. Because I’m en-
gaged
[George drops her hand and staggers
away from her.
Isobel. Why, what's the matter?
George (to the audience, in a voice
ea pressing the very deeps of emotion).
Engaged She is engaged 1 I am too
late
[He sinks into a chair and covers his
face with his hands.
Isobel (surprised). Mr. Turnbull !
What has happened?
George (waving her away with one
hand). Go! Leave me ! I can bear
this best alone. (Eacit Isobel.) Merci-
ful heavens, she is plighted to another'
Enter Henry.
Henry (eagerly). Well, old man?
George (raising a face white with
misery—that is to say, if he has re-
membered to put the French chalk in
the palms of his hands). Henry, I am
too late | She is another's
Henry (in surprise). Whose?
George (with dignity). I did not ask
her. It is nothing to me. Good-bye,
Henry. Be kind to her.
Henry. Why, where are you going?
George (firmly). To the Rocky
Mountains. I shall shoot some bears.
Grizzly ones. It may be that thus I
shall forget my grief.
Henry (after a pause). Perhaps you
are right, George. What shall I tell—
Her 2
George. Tell her — nothing. But
should anything (feeling casually in his
'pockets) happen to me—if (going over
them again quickly) I do not come back,
then (searching them all, including the
vaistcoat ones, in desperate haste), give
her—give her—give her (triumphantly
bringing his handkerchief out of the last
pocket) this, and say that my last
thought was of her. Good-bye, my old
friend. Good-bye.
[Exit to Rocky Mountains.
Enter Isobel.
Isobel. Why, where's Mr. Turn-
bull ?
Henry (sadly). He's gone.
Isobel. Gone 2 Where 2
Henry. To the Rocky Mountains.
To shoot bears. (Feeling that some
further earplanation is needed.) Grizzly
ones, you know.
Isobel. But he was here a moment
ago.
Henry. Yes, he's only just gone.
Isobel. Why didn't he say good-bye?
(Eagerly.) But perhaps heleft a message
for me? (Henry shakes his head.) Noth-
ing? (Henry bows silently and leaves the
room.) Oh! (She gives a cry and throws
herself on the sofa.) And I loved him
George, George, why didn't you speak?
[Enter George hurriedly. He is fully
dressed for a shooting ea pedition
in the Rocky Mountains, and
carries a rifle under his arm.
George (to the audience). I have just
come back for my pocket-handker-
chief. I must have dropped it in here
somewhere. (He begins to search for
it, and in the ordinary course of things
comes upon Isobel on the sofa. He puts
his rifle down carefully on a table, with
the muzzle pointing at the prompter
rather than at the audience, and staggers
back.) Merciful heavens ! Isobel !
Dead! (He falls on his knees beside
the sofa.) My love, speak to me!
Isobel (softly). George!

Schoolmistress. “AND AM I To GIVE THE CHILD RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION ?”
Mother. “I Dox'T CARE wot YER. Do so LoNG As YER Don't BASH 'ER ABAHT THE 'EAD.”
OUR DEBT TO MR. DOTT.
[A letter signed P. McOMIsh DoTT appears in The Outlook of January
14th expressing the fear that England is falling into senile decay.]
THough a man of simple nature, living in a humdrum way,
To the spell of nomenclature I have always fall'n a prey;
Names with me are an obsession, thickening the thinnest
plot,
But my tastiest possession is the last, McOMISH DoTT.
Latterly, while curio-hunting, I acquired some splendid loot,
Bracketing Sir PERCY BUNTING with his friend Sir JESSE
Boot,
Now in even fuller measure there has fallen to my lot
New and valuable treasure labelled P. McOMISH DoTT.
I've collected Mustard, Smellie, Hog with but a single “g,”
Jubb, Earwaker and Whalebelly, Worple, Montecuccoli,
Gollop, Polyblank and Szlumper, Didham, Bultitude and
Sprot,
But I give my vote—a plumper—unto P. McOMISH DoTT.
LowTHER BRIDGER's lucubrations long have ceased to give
me joy,
KIPLING CoMMON's coruscations my fastidious palate cloy;
But a rapture fine and frantic, such as centred in Shalott,
Lurks within the rich, romantic name of P. McOMISH DOTT.
Somewhere in the Boreal regions first his sanguine star
arose,
Where the Macs abound in legions, alternating with the O's;
There he tossed the caber daily, there the golden eagle shot,
There the giant capercailzie fell to P. McOMISH DoTT.
Fed on mountain dew in Jura, and eschewing Saxon swipes,
Soon he mastered the bravura of the devastating pipes;
Or amid the glens and corries traced the stag's elusive slot,
Far from dull suburban “swarries,” sturdy P. McOMISH
DOTT.
Then he swept the board at college, gathering in his mental
net
Every earthly form of knowledge from CoNFUCIUs to
DEBRETT ;
Till—for so the gossips tell us—Admiral Sir PERCY Scott
Grew inordinately jealous of his friend McOMISH DoTT.
Next in retrospective vision southward I behold him fare,
England, rent by indecision, nobly striving to repair;
Hand-in-hand with GILBERT PARKER stopping ev'ry fiscal
rot,
Hand-in-hand with ELLIS BARKER—happy P. McOMISH
DOTT |
Last of all we see him, scorning our misgivings to assuage,
As he trumpets forth his warning in The Outlook's central
page,
Telling us that by to-morrow England will have gone to
pot,
Less in anger than in sorrow—noble P. McOMISH DoTT.
P.S.
Query:-Is the P for Peter, Parsifal or Peregrine?
Any of them suits my metre, but to Parsifal I lean ;
Still, I think I like him better in the form The Out-
look's got,
Prefaced by a single letter—simply P. McOMISH Dott.
“Old Age Prevented.—Eat orange flower honey.”—Advt. in “Daily
Mail.”
Can this be yet another example of commercial candour?

Athwart the chill and cheerless winter-skies

And then a futile left, and strained my eyes

Sinking to rest beyond the fir-wood's marge–
Not mine, not mine the fault: despise me not
In that I missed you; for the sun was down,
And the dim light was all against the shot;
And I had booked a bet of half-a-crown.
My deadly fire is apt to be upset
By many causes—always by a bet.
Or had I overdone it with the sloes,
Snared by their home-picked brand of ardent gin
Designed to warm a shivering sportsman's toes
And light a fire his reckless head within 2

The last day's absolutely final bird,
Scathless, and left me very ill content;
And someone (was it I?) pronounced a word,
A word which rather forcible than nice is,
A little word which does not rhyme with Isis.
Farewell! I may behold you once again
When next November's gales have stripped the leaf.

May I be there to add you to my sheaf;
And may they praise your tallness, saying “This

opened when a blue paper arrived
demanding a statement of royalties
received. I replied that I was both
surprised and gratified to learn that
my opponent had heard of my little
book. (It was gratifying, you know, for
I fancy it had been forgotten months
before by the whole of the garden-
ing public.) And I sent him an order
|form. He simply wrote reiterating his
| demand. Then I told him that since
he pressed the point I must admit that
I was perhaps a little sensitive about
the outcome of my book. I was quite
satisfied with its success as literature,
and I was sure he would agree with
me that mere monetary return was not
to be accepted as the only test of its
value. He replied very briefly, “Please
furnish the address of Messrs. Williams
and Anstruther.” That I declined to
do. I pointed out that it was not
quite playing the game; that they
might have some reason (one never
knew) for not wishing to make their
address known. I did not care to take
the responsibility. I felt it would be
more satisfactory if he would write to
them direct for it. This he must have
done, for his next communication was
a demand for payment of tax at 9d. in
the pound on the amount of royalties
received. The royalties were eighteen
shillings, so it worked out at eight-
pence.
I now began seriously to defend
myself. I told him (1) that this sum
of eighteen shillings had already been
entered in my first return under the
heading, “Promiscuous profits from
sundry sources,” also (2) that even if
he could thus isolate it for special
treatment, it was a question of the
average profits accruing to me during
the last three years from publication of
books. That made it about 2%d. Did
he think it worth collecting 2 I also
asked him, in a postscript, to send me
a packet of those jolly little yellow
envelopes of his marked “Official
Paid,” where the stamp ought to go,
so that I might be in a position to
carry on the correspondence on equal
terms. He had sent me one or two of
these before, but never in sufficient
quantities.
In his reply, which was ingenious but
inconclusive, he made no reference at
all to my demand for envelopes; and
this really became the crux of the
situation. For the contest came auto-
matically to an end yesterday when I
wrote and pointed out that I had now
expended on stamps the whole amount
of the tax claimed. I therefore re-
garded the incident as closed. The
Government had got my money. It
only remained for him to see that the
sum in question was transferred from
the Post Office to the Inland Revenue
Department.
But still the thing is hardly fair.
His letters cost him nothing, while
I am all the time incurring heavy
expenses in note-paper. I must have
the packet of envelopes next time.
Otherwise I shan't play.

for the harmless purpose of giving pro-
vincial actors an opportunity of appeal-
ing to Metropolitan tastes. The lights
of The Little Theatre had gone out and
from the Egyptian darkness of the
stage an unseen chest threw off one
of ELLA WHEELER WILCox's Poems
of Pleasure in the approved elocu-
tionary manner that emphasizes every
word and the gaps between. For a
moment I thought I should have to
be an Offgoer. But it was soon over,
and two figures did a praiseworthy
step-dance indicative of the origin of
the Opal. It appears that the Opal
is the direct result of wedlock between
a Sunbeam and a Moonbeam.
Then there was a great interval,
during which a lady came on (or
oncame 2) through the curtain and
sang, with perfect British decorum,
one of Carmen's most full-blooded songs,
and a pianist played and played in a
corner by the door till I thought
nothing else was ever going to happen.
At last a gong sounded and I sat up;
but it was only the dressing-gong; and
there was more delay before the dinner-
gong sounded and we got to work on the
piece of resistance. Its name was The
Trap, and it was rather a pleasant Light
Comedy, by ALICE CLAYTON GREENE,
about a husband who disguised himself
as a burglar and held up his wife and
her lover. A nice play for private
theatricals, and really quite as good as
some things that find their way on to
the London boards. And it gave good
chances to Mr. PHILIP CLAYTON
GREENE as the husband, to Mr. WYNNE
WEAVER as a butler, to Miss NELL DU
MAURIER as a French maid, and to
Miss NANCY York as a precocious and
oncoming young thing. Miss DAisy
Atherton played well, but was ham-
pered by a lover who was rather sticky
in a thankless part. Miss ANTON LANG
spoke as if she were really saying good
things; but this was a misapprehension.
The little play had its longueurs,
but they were as nothing compared
with those of the intervals. The per-
formance held the interest of an
audience not too intelligent (if one may
judge from the fact that a good many of
them never found out till the end that
the husband and the burglar were one);
but it was their patience in the inter-
vals that more than anything else is:-

TowsER.
I MET him on a July Sunday after-
noon in Hyde Park. Several dogs
were amusing themselves bringing
chips of wood out of the Serpentine
for the visitors to throw in. And this
fellow appeared to be stage-managing
the show. A rough Scotch Terrier cum
Dandie Dinmont, with matted towsled
silver-grey hair and a gaily waving tail.
He disdained to touch the chips him-
self. He gave instructions to the other
fellows. Swimming out after every
piece as it was thrown in, he circled
round it and swore until it had been
seized upon and removed by the nearest
unemployed dog. Sometimes he would
make a dash for the shore, look round
for a nice new summery frock, and
shake himself dry in its immediate
neighbourhood. The resulting screams
and giggles, alarums and excursions,
always made him roll on the floor in
fits of laughter; then into the water
again he'd leap with a shout of, “Now
then, you fellows, get those chips out,
will you !” Really a jolly dog to meet
on a dull day.
At last a sudden shower scattered
the visitors and all the dogs, except
my stage manager. When the poor
beggar realised this unexpected deser-
tion he gazed at the world in amazed
silence for a moment or two. Then he
gave a contemptuous bark expressive
of his private opinion of dogs and
humans afraid of rain, and set himself
to collect all the chips still floating in
the water. These he piled carefully in
a heap on the sand, looked invitingly
at the nearest group of people under
the dripping trees, and barked in eager
anticipation of joys to be repeated . . .

world that it might come and amuse

gently as his native London politeness
and remembrance of recent chocolates
will allow) when you insist that rabbits
are real living entities and not myths
or idle visions of a dog's dream,
well, that sort of animal puts you on
your mettle, don't you know. I re-
solved that he should eat his words—
and also his rabbits if he cared. I stole
the brute / I tempted him with choco-
late creams, and he followed me to
Euston, where I took a ticket to
Scotland for him.
Towser and I went to an hotel on
the East coast at a place where rabbits
are at a discount, and next morning I
took him along the cliffs to be initiated.
He exhibited a mild interest in the . .
new variety of scents to be found,
tracked a few smells on the footpaths
to little holes in the ground, wondered
a good deal at the big stretch of water
—into which he tried to jump from the
top of a cliff 200 feet high—but, on the
whole, looked unutterably bored, until
Brer Rabbit appeared. Then he sat
down and laughed. I hissed him at
the game, but my friend sat and grinned
up at me. “It’s a good joke, guv'nor,”
he said, “but you don't get over me
with a Teddy-bear. I know them
things.” Brer Rabbit hopped off a
bit. Towser stood up and stared.
Brer Rabbit turned towards us. Towser
put his tail between his legs and bolted
for home !
Next day he waited to see if Brer
Rabbit would really attack him before
he moved. As nothing happened he
made friendly overtures, which Brer
Rabbit resented and ran away from.
Then came the great awakening. There
were hundreds of these things about,
and every one of them was afraid of
him—of him, Towser—and they dis-
appeared like taxicabs before you could
make up your mind which to catch.
This was something like, this was the
land of real adventure, this—oh, Joy | | |
I lost him that day. He re-
turned to the hotel at night a physical
wreck. Chasing hundreds of disappear-
ing scuts without a working plan in
his head must be hard work for an
inexperienced dog. But the joy of
battle was in his eye. And next morn-
ing I discovered that he had learned to
associate the scents on the paths with
the disappearing fluffs, and both with
the holes in the ground. He had
apparently been working at the problem
overnight, for without the slightest
hesitation he made straight for a rabbit-
hole as soon as we reached the cliffs,
and, in his efforts to get the prize,
jammed himself so far and so tightly
in that I had to dig him out. He did
not stop to thank me, but, full of the
joy of life, with short, sharp, eager
yelps, ran from hole to hole shouting
for the denizens to come forth and give
a fellow a chance. . . .
Later in the day I heard my friend
whining pitiably. On going in search
of him I found Towser pawing gently
a little rabbit he had done to death,
turning it over and over, and trying to
lick it back to life again. He looked
up at me mournfully. “He’s stopped
playing with me, guv'nor,” he said;
“there's something gone wrong with
him.” And he licked it again caress-
ingly and whined.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT does not often happen that I am disappointed in a
HEINEMANN novel, but I confess that, till about half-way
through, I thought Young Life was going to prove one of the
exceptions. Even after the interest had quickened, I can-
not say that the reading of it gave me all the enjoyment
I had begun by anticipating, though I freely admit that
Miss JEssie LECKIE HERBERTson has written a clever and
original book. What plot it contains is of the slightest, the
interest being provided by a character-study of a girl,
Hester Stanton, the orphaned ward of Stephen Garfield,
whose “ young life" it is that, coming into the placid
existence of a number of middle-aged persons, leavens it
with most mischievous results to their peace of mind. At
least, this is the scheme of the tale as I understood it;
but the fact is that Miss HERBERTson's style is so bafflingly
elusive that much of her intention may well have escaped
me. Of course, in the end Hester marries Garfield—wards
and guardians are the matrimonial certainties of fiction—
but before this is settled - -
we have the episode, far
the best thing in the book,
to my mind, of Mary
Leverson, the rather prig-
gish matron, and the mu-
sician, Dalziel. Even ||
here, however, Miss HER-
BERTSON tends to over-
burden a clever idea with Hº

it is “not what he said,
but the way that he said

|
cern. And too much of

Throughout the book (produced by LAURIE).
The Mountain of Gold (MILLS AND Boon) ends where it
began, but is quite enjoyable in the part between. Miss
E. S. STEvens was, I imagine, divided between an inclina-
tion to discourse upon the religious, philosophical, social
and political controversies of the Near East, and a desire
to write a sex-problem novel. Mrs. Greville and Robert
Underwood, whom she sends to Mount Carmel, are both
typical of the enterprising European, but handicapped, the
one by an absentee husband, the other by a pair of crutches.
Jointly and severally they undergo a sequence of incidents,
receive a number of impressions, and impart their views to
each other in able, if unusual, dialogue. The incidents are:
well told and of considerable interest ; the impressions are
striking and subtly impressed; there is much clever
characterisation, and on the whole our author has put
together a good book. She may call it a “novel” if she
likes (almost anything written
comes under that elastic
term, even if illustrated,
º . this is, with photo-

natural that the heroes and heroines of these tales should
not be especially exciting people. Apart from one dramatic
and unexpected calamity the author has avoided sensational
incident, and although I feel that the analysis of character
is thoroughly sound, I feel also that it is rather dull—like,
if I may say so, the analysis of a bowler who is thinking
more of maidens than of wickets. Still, I have been able
to derive some placid enjoyment from this book, for if it
does not reveal striking powers of imagination it is, at any
rate, full of conscientious workmanship.
“Airmen are extremely fond of mascots. From the death-rate
amongst them, we should fancy it was not only foolish but a dangerous
superstition.”—Sheffield Guardian. -
Let this pass, though one would have thought that if it
was foolish there was nothing in it, and so it could not be
very dangerous: but when the writer goes on to say:—
“It is curious the superstitions of sausages should flourish in a
century of science,”
we confess that he is taking us right out of our depth.
“Rat-killing has been stopped at Hadleigh, Suffolk, for want of
sufficient rats.”—Halstead Gazette.
Of all unsporting animals commend us to the rats of

Of my rivals busy working off the old Horatian tag.
Envious Time, that often likes to print a
Crow's-foot on the ageing cheek,
Favours your façade, my Araminta,

Who, but just ten springs ago,
Lightly told the fact-collector every word he wished
to know.
Twenty-one you were and un-selfconscious,
As became the prime of youth,
Never nursed a doubt, like PILATE (PontiUs),
On the attributes of Truth ;
But with riper years I shouldn't wonder
If, in drawing up this next report,
On the point of age you made a blunder
Of a not unusual sort; -
No, it wouldn't greatly shock me if you got the total

Where conjecture serves for guide,

Err upon the minus side;

And you do the little sum that 's set

Out at 27, net ; -
27 is the answer which I seem to see you get.
And with every ten years, as they flow on,
You will add a lessening few
To your summers—five and four and so on,
Sticking fast at forty-two;
There in future, permanently dated,
You'll defy the periodic quest,

DEAR SIR,--I am anxious to celebrate the impending
twenty-fifth anniversary of the appearance of my monu-
mental monograph on the Mammoth and the Flood. With
a view to placing on record this interesting event in a
suitably pictorial manner, my friend, the Editor of The
Times—to whose journal I have contributed more than
10,000 columns of correspondence—has suggested that I
should be photographed with him and a specimen of the
gigantic but unhappily extinct quadruped mentioned above.
I should be glad if you could arrange to procure either a
skeleton or a good “reconstitution" of one of the mummies
discovered in the frozen tundras of Northern Siberia [Here
a column and a half of interesting matter dealing with
the Flood, Mr. Cobden and other cognate subjects is un-
avoidably omitted] and let us know on what day and at
what hour it would suit you for myself and the Editor of
The Times to attend. I propose to appear in costume
suitable to the geographical habitat of the Elephas primi-
genius, i.e. a long walrus-hide coat with stereognathous
leggings and sandals of mercerized mink. The Editor of
The Times will probably appear as a hunter or trapper

THE BUTLER SCANDALISES.
[Being a specimen of the new Society journal-
ism for American consumption. See “House-
holder's" recent letter to The Times.]
DEAR MADAM, I take up my pen to
give you another batch of good gossip
for our lively cousins on the other side
of the Great Pond to repeat to each
other through their nasal organs over
their pie and gum, which are, I under-
stand, their national provender, washed
down with cocktails and iced water.
To one who, like myself, prefers his
meals beefy and regular, it is a problem
how the Americans live at all; but
however short their lives may be they
tip merrily and brightly while they
last. Which reminds me, dear Madam,
that I have not yet received any remu-
neration for my last letter. Times
under the present Government being
so hard, I must request a speedy re-
mittance.
My principal item of news comes
from a scrupulously untainted source
—no less a person than Sir Elihu
Crusher's own valet having given it to
me. Sir Elihu, it seems, recently
opened a new branch at Chelmsford,
and who do you think was the first
customer? Lady Wirridge's French
maid, for a shilling's-worth of rat
poison. When I tell you that Lord
Wirridge has since been very ill and
that the French maid has disappeared,
you will no doubt draw such conclu-
sions as America requires.
You know, of course, that LoRD
GEORGE SANGER gave up the circus
business some few years since. I have
it on the best authority that his Lord-
ship cannot feel comfortable at night
or get good repose without a Teddy
bear on the counterpane at the foot of
the bed. His Lordship has recently
been visited by Sir Joseph Lyons, and
this, too, has reminded him pleasantly
of old times.
The latest news of Sir John BARKER,
of Kensington, is that his establish-
ment was visited recently by the
Duchess of Sunderland under the
impression that it was Harrod's Stores,
but she stayed there and made a
number of purchases, including a Vir-
ginia ham. I had this from a friend
of mine in the Packing department,
and can vouch for it.
Perhaps a few facts concerning
gratuities (or honoraria) might yield
material for one of your spicy and
highly-paid articles. The Earl of
Rosherville gives butlers ten shillings
and footmen five; keepers a sovereign.
The largest present I ever received was
a fiver from the late Marquis of Clac-
ton, but its value was depreciated by

The readiness with which the young
and more spirited nobility will extract
loans from men-servants is not the
least of the blots on the peerage.
In conclusion, dear Madam, let me
say that I have three friends all most
advantageously placed to hear interest-
ing things—a chambermaid at the
Walrus, a waiter at the Mermaid
Restaurant, and a page at the National
Radical Club; but they refuse to divulge
without a little encouragement. I must
therefore again request you to forward
me something, if only a trifle, on
account. My experience is that no
palm is properly open until it is oiled.
Believe me, dear Madam,
Your obedient Servant,
From a letter in The Guardian :-
“I wonder whether Mrs. Shearme has met
with the description in Herodotus of the exces-
sive hardness of the skulls of the Egyptians,
and their immunity from sunstroke because
they cause their children from earliest infancy
to meet the elements bareheaded.”
HERODOTUS might have gone on to give
bachelors some idea of the precautions
they should adopt.

THE NOVEL OF THE FUTURE.
“Now, Miss Barlock,” I said to my typist, as I entered
my writing den, “if you're quite ready we'll begin at once,
please. Title: THE SYNTHETIC PILGRIM; a Post-Impres-
Sionist Romance. Have you got that ?” Miss Barlock had
got that, but she looked puzzled, and, as she seems to take
an intelligent interest in my work, I thought it better to
explain the idea before proceeding. “It's like this,” I
said; “we are assured by competent authorities that,
in spite of the warnings of Sir WILLIAM RichMond, Sir
ALFRED EAST, Mr. SARGENT and others, all the Art
Students now at the Academy will within the next ten
years have become Post-Impressionists. That is, they will
set down their impressions of Nature with the technique of
a very young child whose powers of observation have not
had time to become paralysed. by any instruction in
drawing. Well, Literature, being so closely allied to Art,
is quite certain to be affected sooner or later by the new
Movement. It will throw off the shackles of style and
composition, and be primitive and go-as-you-please. I’m
going to be the Pioneer of Post-Impressionist Fiction. You
see what I'm trying for, don't you? Wery well, then.
Chapter One. The Hero, and how he became a Pilgrim :—
“‘He was quite a simple ordinary kind of man. His
outlines were hard and black. He had a small, roundish
head with three dots in it, one above the other. His body
was triangular, and all down it was a row of little circles.
These were his buttons. His arms were straight and
uite thin. They ended in three prongs like toasting-forks.
t was the same with his legs. . . . .'"
I noticed a slight elevation in Miss Barlock's eyebrows
at this point. “It's all right, Miss Barlock,” I assured
her. “I am merely adopting the method by which an
unsophisticated mind invariably represents the human
form. Probably that is the shape in which all of us
would see it if our vision had not been warped by
civilisation, or tradition, or something. Anyhow, no one
ever yet failed to recognise that it was a man. And an
author may devote pages and pages to description and
analysis of his hero and never even get as far as that.
Why, for instance, should I tell the reader that my Man
had long nervous muscular fingers when these simple
tridents amply suffice to express the handiness of his hands
and the footiness of his feet? . . . You don't know?
No more do I–so let us get on.
“‘He lived in a really and truly artistic house. It was
an irregular parallelogram, and the roof was bright pink.
The door and windows were stuck in anyhow, and there
were little corkscrew-things coming out of the chimneys.
These were the smoke. There were trees about. Not any
particular trees, because I don't know one tree from
another and couldn't bother to describe them if I did.
Just trees — with bright blue and green and chocolate
foliage like the loveliest woolwork. There was a bow-wow
outside the house, and inside it a fat cat sat on a mat.
But at last the hero got tired of living there, so he called
for his gee-gee. Gug-gug.' . . . Yes, Miss Barlock, I did
mean that to be typed. You see, I'm taking the point of
view of an infant of very tender years, who at this stage of
the narrative would inevitably make that remark. It gives
the necessary note of naiveté, and I shouldn't wonder
myself if there were a deep and subtle meaning in it some-
where. So down it goes. . . . Chapter Two. About His
Gee-gee:— Unless you were told you would not have
known it for a gee-gee at all. It was the sort of gee-gee
you see when it is a long way off and you are rather short-
sighted. But it was a gee-gee right enough. It had all
the essentials of gee-gee-iness. If it hadn't, our hero
wouldn't have been seen with it. And so he said good-bye
to his bow-wow and the fat cat, which couldn't be seen
because it was inside the house, and he got on his gee-gee
and his travels began. Goo-goo.”
“I insist on having that “goo-goo' typed, Miss Barlock,”
I told her. “It's part of my technique. You are merely
one of the Public, so you mustn't try to dictate to me
how I should express my temperament. Besides, I'm
dictating to you . . . Chapter Three. His Adventures
among Masterpieces:–
“‘Well, and so he rode and he rode, till at last he came to
a country which was entirely composed of little prismatic
smuts, so that you couldn't make out what it was like
unless you went ever such a distance off, and then it was
disappointing. So he didn't stay there very long. And the
smuts did not suit his gee-gee at all. So on they went to
the next place, and there the sky was all neatly paved with
small slabs of paint, and the inhabitants were all completely
out of drawing and perspective, and had no anatomical
nonsense about them. But the gee-gee wasn't very well
even there. . . .'”
Here Miss Barlock ventured the criticism that, so far,
my novel did not appear to have much plot. “It has none
whatever,” I said, with some pride, “and it's not going to
have. I'm depicting Life as I've observed it. Have I
detected any kind of plot governing my own or others'
experiences? I have not. Then why, I ask you, Miss
Barlock, should I undertake the mental labour of inventing
one? No, no, let us be true to Nature as we happen to see
it. . . . Chapter Four. His Further Adventures —
“So he got on his gee-gee again, and he rode and he rode
and he rode. And soon he came to a land where there
were huts and palm-trees and things, and all the natives
were brown and quite flat, exactly like people made of
gingerbread. Only they were not so nice to eat. So
the gee-gee was very sick indeed. Gug-gug. Goo-goo-
oo. . . .’”
9. Miss Barlock glanced up at me over her typewriter with
some anxiety. “Are you quite sure,” she inquired uneasily,
“that this sort of thing will be really popular 2"
“Not immediately,” I admitted. “Every inventor of a
new literary style has to go through a period of misunder-
standing, and even derision. Look at CARLYLE and
BRowNING and MEREDITH, for example !”
“But surely,” she objected, “that isn't quite the same
thing. I mean, they didn't write like babies—'gug-gugging'
and ‘goo-goo-ing,' and all that.”
No doubt Miss Barlock didn't mean to do it, but some-
how she put me off. I have made no further progress with
my great Post-Impressionist Novel. But it is merely biding
its time. F. A.
Commercial Candour.
“It would seem possible that almost any woman, no matter what the
extent or depth of her wrinkles, might have been removed entirely and
for ever by means of this lucky discovery.”—Advt.
“‘Women's Friendships' forms the subject of an article in the
February number of ‘The Quiver,' written by Dr. Elizabeth Sloan
Chesser. A description of the foreign churches in London, illustrated
by photographs, throws a light on this subject.”—Publishers' Circular.
Not a searchlight, of course, nor the fierce kind that beats
upon a throne; but just a few candle-power—a sort of dim
religious light.
“Mr. — is too well-known locally to begin expatiating at any
length upon his vocal excellencies.”—I kley Gazette.
The writer shows a wise caution.

LITTLE PLAYS FOR AMATEURS.
III.-"Miss PRENDERGAST.”
As the curtain goes up two ladies are
discovered in the morning-room of
Honeysuckle Lodge engaged in work
of a feminine nature. Miss Alice
Prendergast is doing something
delicate with a crochet-hook, but it
is obvious that her thoughts are far
away. She sighs at intervals, and
occasionally lays down her work
and presses both hands to her heart-
A sympathetic audience will have
no difficulty in guessing that she is
in love. On the other hand, her
elder sister, Miss Prender-
one may play an important part in her
life.) “Dear Miss Prendergast, I hope
you will pardon the presumption of
what I am about to write to you, but
whether you pardon me or not I ask
you to listen to me. I know of no
woman for whose talents I have a
greater admiration, or for whose qualities
I have a more sincere affection than
yourself. Since I have known you, you
have been the lodestar of my existence,
the fountain of my inspiration. I feel
that, were your life joined to mine, the
joint path upon which we trod would

TO A HAIRPIN.
O PIN that didst of yore constrain
Some lady's would-be wanton mane
With dear enslavement,
Till wind or luck, rude autocrat,
Expelled thee from that maiden's mat
On to the pavement.
What story hast thou? Was the head
Thou tired'st hazel, black or red,
Gold or peroxide?
Had it a parting? Did it wave?
Was it in mode demure and suave,
Or on the shock side 2
Didst thou, with hidden guile, attach
Some cunning tresses bought “to match,”
To hide a lacking?
We can but trust, if that be so,
The hair hung on, despite the blow
That sent thee packing.
Ah me! No doubt a deal of care
Was spent to bring that head of hair
To full perfection;
We wonder if, for all her toil,
Thy tragedy went far to spoil
The whole erection.
It may be; for that man, indeed,
Who begs, to serve his direst need,
A pin–a hair one—
To clean his pipe, is ever met
With hackneyed statements of regret
That “she can't spare one.”
He may not doubt. Yet, truth to say,
Judged by the free and casual way
These maidens scatter—
E'en as his quills the porcupine—
Their pins abroad, this fall of thine
Should hardly matter.
O hairpin cast upon the earth,
'Tis not for man to ask thy worth
Or probe thy history;
He only knows that, being one
By which a lady's hair is “done,”
Thou art all mystery.
But, lowly though thy present state,
Thou hast for memory this great
And deathless blessing,
That thou—oh joy beyond eclipse!—
Didst lie between a maiden's lips
When she was dressing.

THE PARLIAMENTARY BALLERINE TRIP. SMARTLY FORWARD TO THE FOOTLIGHTS AGAIN.
(The Artist was so overwhelmed by the charms of the first few who presented themselves that he has had to omit six hundred and
sixty odd coryphées of hardly less attractive mien.)
ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM.
[An American Counsel, in the course of a case
of alleged poisoning, has swallowed in a cocktail
a dose of arsenic of the same strength as that
alleged to have been employed by the prisoner,
in order to demonstrate its hº Fore-
seeing many developments of such action in the
future, Mr. Punch makes no apology for printing
the following forecast of a newspaper article of
1926.]
IT is with great regret that we record
the sad loss which newspaper readers
and all frequenters of law courts have
sustained by the untimely decease of
Sir Robert Riskett, the eminent King's
Counsel. It was known that Sir Robert
had been suffering from ptomaine
poisoning ever since the Great Marine
Stores Case, in which he ate three blown
tins of salmon in open court in proof
of his client's contention that they were
quite wholesome. He was believed,
however, to be making his usual good
recovery, and the news this morning
will come as a shock upon a public
accustomed to regard him as the
ablestexponent of spectacular advocacy.
From the day, a dozen years ago,
when he shot the instructing solicitor
in the leg with a pocket pistol in sup-
port of the theory of the prosecution
in the Great Railway Mystery, his career
has been one long series of dramatic
triumphs.
It was, of course, unavoidable that such
a man, in the course of such a career,
should make occasional enemies. We
believe the solicitor just mentioned—
in spite of the fact that the case he
had presented was definitely established
by Sir Robert's coup—could never be
induced either to brief him again or
even to sit in the same court; and it is
an open secret that a certain law officer
of the Crown never forgave him for the
blow on the point of the jaw with
which, in the trial arising out of the
Club Prize-fight Scandal, Sir Robert
dissipated in a moment his wordy
sophistries upon the inefficacy of the
“knockout.” -
But, putting aside criticism arising
from merely personal or petty feeling,
we are of opinion ourselves that there
is something to be said on public
grounds against the strenuous advocacy
now so much in vogue. For one thing,
it cannot be maintained at this high
pitch without ultimate damage to the
personnel of the judicial Bench. Much
though we admired at the time the
devotion to duty of the talented K.C.
who a year ago allowed himself to be
trepanned in the well of the court by
the medical client whose skill had been
slanderously impugned, yet we cannot
shut our eyes to a possible connection
between that operation and the reversal
on appeal of nine out of ten of his
judgments since his elevation to the
Bench.
We will not, however, dwell upon
this aspect of the subject, for there are
obvious compensations. Judges who
have been previously, during years of
advocacy, broken upon the wheel of
their clients' necessities, may not prove
capable of sustained attention or con-
nected thought, but their histrionic
ability abides. In proof of this we
need only cite Mr. Justice Leary's dis-
play in the Hypnotic Pocket-picking
case last summer, when he himself
went off into a trance during his sum-
ming-up, and was found, after restora-
tion to consciousness by a doctor and
the leader of the Circuit, to have the
watches of both in his possession.

The Professor. Amusement is not considered to be our
chief object; but we do try to amuse while we instruct,
and generally we find we succeed wonderfully well.
She. Ah, here comes the audience. I must help to get
them seated. - - -
[The audience, consisting of children ranging in age
from 4 to 12, all dressed in their best and bringing
with them a sprinkling of mothers and nurses,
begins to troop in. The seats are gradually filled.
The Professor takes his stand on the platform and,
silence having been established, he begins to speak.
The Professor. I have to thank you for inviting me to
come amongst you this afternoon. I own that this is the
first occasion on which I have had the privilege of address-
ing an audience so largely composed of the young of both
sexes. However, in such a matter as this it is impossible
to begin too early. Knowledge acquired in the impression-
able years of youth remains firmly implanted throughout
life, and I therefore welcome joyfully the chance of
sowing seed which will in due time grow into a beneficent
and plentiful harvest of wisdom. - The subject of my dis-
course is, as you all know, “Domestic Hygiene."... [A
small child here begins to cry and is hastily removed.]
“Domestic" is, as you are aware, derived from domus, a
Latin word meaning house, and “domestic” therefore means
of or belonging to a house. “Hygiene" is from the Greek
word for health, and “Domestic Hygiene" may therefore be
described as the science of health in relation to the house-
hold arrangements amid which our lives are passed. ,
[The Professor proceeds in this fashion for nearly an
hour, and ends with an impassioned appeal to
his hearers to enrol themselves as members of the
Domestic Hygiene Central Association.
I am sure it will all be

Extract from “The Chorsleydale Standard” of the fol-
lowing Saturday :-
“The Lowmead Willage Hall on Wednesday last was
filled with an enthusiastic meeting of members of the
Lowmead Scientific Association, who had gathered for.one
of the series of scientific afternoons which have formed
such an outstanding feature of the proceedings of this body.
Unfortunately Professor Borradaile, who was to have
lectured on Domestic Hygiene, was unable to be present,
but his place was supplied practically at a moment's notice
by Lieutenant Dobbs with his well-known and refined
scientific Wentriloquial Entertainment. The members are
to be congratulated on having provided for themselves and
the rest of the audience a most enjoyable afternoon. The
Lieutenant was heartily applauded throughout, and we
hope shortly to see him again in Lowmead.” . . .
The extent to which the twentieth-century boy is expected
to look after his parents may not be realised by some ; but
two extracts (one from a notice of Long Leave at Eton and
the other from The Acton Gazette) may serve to show the
tendency of the modern movement: ... . -- - - - - -
“Long Leave will be granted to Parents or Guardians of all boys who
apply for it." - --- - - -
“Two schoolboys, aged respectively seven and thirteen, were charged
with being found wandering at Acton-lane, Acton, and having a parent
who did not exercise proper guardianship over them." . º
“The Chairman stated that before they went into voting for a pre-
sident he should like to say there was no one who could appreciate the
honour the society had done to him by re-electing him to the presidency
in succession, as they had done as much as he had."—Rugby Advertiser.
The punctuator of this speech is determined to show that
the duties of the president are merely nominal.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“PRESERVING MR. PANMURE.”
WE were warned to be in our seats
punctually, as the interest threatened
to begin practically at the same time as
the play did. This was misleading, for
one might easily have evaded the First
Act and lost little by it except the
irresistible pedantry of little Miss IRIs
HAwkINs. A short synopsis would
have put us in touch with the facts.
Thus: Mr. Panmure, a gentleman of
rather dotty physique (the result of
early excesses), having ostensibly re-
formed through the ministrations of a
pious wife and clergyman, and got into
the habit of delivering discourses at
family prayers twice a week, still
retains some irrepressible relics of the
old Adam. These break out, and in a
moment of amorous gallantry he vio-
lently kisses the pretty governess of
his daughter.
To the exordium here epitomised—of
which the humour may be judged from
the fact that it secured one of its most
poignant effects by means of a dollop
of powder smudged across the child's
nose, which had suffered from the
weather—two brilliant Acts succeed.
Wind is got of the outrage done to the
governess, but the identity of the delin-
quent remains in doubt. A great and
glorious quest is set on foot by the
ladies. For a moment, when I saw
a spasm of suspicion cross the devout
face of Mrs. Panmure, I feared that
Sir ARTHUR PINERo was going to break
through that tradition of detective
stories which requires that the actual
culprit should be the last person to be
suspected. However, it passes, and
the innocence of Mr. Panmure, stoutly
asserted by the injured party, is even-
tually confirmed to the satisfaction of
the ladies by a little man staying in the
house—the most unlikely of Lotharios
—who, at the girl's request, takes upon
himself the guilt, and receives from
Mrs. Panmure, as the guerdon of his
honesty and courage in confessing, the
badge of the Order of Fine Souls (First
Class).
The scene now shifts, for the last Act,
to the house of a Mr. Stulkeley, M.P.,
who had been a guest of the Panmures
in the preceding Acts, and had offered
hospitality to the governess in her
predicament. Here we get right away
from Mr. Panmure, except that he is
briefly dragged in with a family crowd
that we may hear of his ultimate con-
fession, and that the author may have
an opportunity of showing that he has
not absolutely mislaid the title of his
play. (Incidentally it transpires that the
confession was wrung from Panmure by
the revelations of a footman who over-
heard the smashing of a plate during
the stormy interview which followed
the Kiss, and subsequently found his
master engaged in retrieving the frag-
ments. Unfortunately, when I assisted
at the second performance, the plate
bounded along the floor intact.)
The interest now centres in a com-
petition for the hand of the governess,
as between Mr. Stulkeley and his Private
Secretary, the little man who had as-
sumed the guilt of the outrage. This
Act contained some fairly good fun of
its own, but had obvious difficulty in
dragging out its slow length. Its failure
was not the common one of last Acts—
the failure of an author to maintain
interest when clearing up the threads

Miss IRIS HAwkiNs (Myrtle). “The pro-
gramme tells you where my Mamma and my
governess go to get their costumes; but Heaven
§ Pinero only know why I'm dressed like
this.”
that have been already unravelled. Its
fault lay (apart from its undue expan-
sion) in the attempt to establish interest
at that late hour in a side issue.
Sir WING describes his work as “a
Comic Play,” and I bow to his
authority. But he might well have
called it a Farce, for some of his
characters were sufficiently incredible.
I am not sure that I quite believed in
Mr. Panmure, that amalgam of irrecon-
cilable elements; and I know I never
believed in the loud crudity of his sister-
in-law, or in the familiarity of Wood-
house, the M.P.'s Private Secretary. I
have had the privilege, beyond my
deserts, of acquaintance with many
Parliamentary Private Secretaries, but
I have never known one who was on
terms of such contemptuous intimacy
with his chief. Of course, in the case
of cousins it may be different, but it
can't be so different as all that.
MISS MARIE LöHR, as the governess,
bore the brunt of the work, and did it
with great intelligence and versatility.
I was sorry that she was made
gratuitously to appear in a scratch
costume, minus gown and stockings,
because it looks as if this kind
of episode, coming so soon after
her pyjamas scene in Tamtalising
Tommy, might grow into a habit with
the people who write for her or manage
her. I was sorry, too, that in the end
she should have had to choose, for a
husband, between a puppet and a prig,
for in this latter category I must reluc-
tantly place Mr. Stulkeley, M.P., who
carried his platform manner into the
domestic circle. For the sake of the
humaninterest, such as it was, the author
might well have allowed him, in the
act of proposing marriage, to throw off
his oratorical style and behave less
like a gramophone on stilts. There
are some things that are not fair in
love or war, and elocution is one of
them. Mr. DAwson MILLwaRD, in this
not very grateful rôle, was, as always,
an admirable figure, though perhaps
he marched and countermarched about
the stage a little too much and too
rapidly.
Mr. ARTHUR PLAYFAIR, as Panmure,
did not commit the mistake which he
made in Vice Versé, but showed excel-
lent restraint when tempted to conduct
himself farcically. Miss LILIAN BRAITH-
waite was a very perfect Mrs. Pan-
mure, and Mr. DIon BoucICAULT took
advantage of his many chances, though
his methods were sometimes a little
irritating.
Regrettably the chief attraction of
this rather unequal play disappeared
quite early when the precocious Myrtle
was despatched to bed. I venture to
join in her protest at this premature
dismissal. It is true that she had
nothing to do with the play except to
afford the governess a reason for exist-
ence, and could not conceivably have
been the child of either of her parents.
But this only helped her to be a thing
apart and wonderful. I never saw
anything to compare with Miss IRIs
HAwKINs for sheer aplomb, and I only
wish she could have been there all the
time. O. S.
“One of these men, a Calabrian named
Motta, went to his partner's shop and tried to

[After reading the early history of medicine.]
YE makers of fortunes gigantic,
Quack vendors of potions and pills,
Who now give us nothing romantic
Except your advertisement bills,
Consider the wondrous concoctions
Put up in the bottle or box
By doctors aforetime and, wasting no
more time,
Just pull up your socks.
“Digestion,” they'd ask, “misbehaving?”
Or, “Blisters on both of your heels?
Tut, tut! Take an ivory shaving
Thrice daily, an hour before meals.”
Such sorts of medicinal dainties,
Backed up by a ponderous mien,
They'd foist upon folly as certain of
jolly
Well curing the spleen.
They'd (almost) put up in a flagon
And afterward offer for sale
Pink hairs from the head of a dragon,
Blue tufts from a unicorn's tail.
And, could they have only got at them,
No doubt they'd have mixed with
their drinks
For troublesome tummies the wrappings
of mummies,
Or chips off the Sphinx.
But you, did we ask that a pimple
Be cured with a Balsam of Bats,
Would only look hopelessly simple,
Or rudely ejaculate, “Rats.”
Come, give up your commonplace
nostrums,
Present something quaint to our

Those picturesque liars could always
find buyers,
So why shouldn't you?

recent origin.]
ONCE, if I read in story books
Of mediaeval deeds of daring,
And how the baron said “Gadzooks,”
Instead of “Dash it all,” when
swearing,
I prated of the “good old" times,
But now their goodness is forgotten,
Since life bereft of pantomimes
Would be, to put it mildly, rotten.
If matters happened to annoy,
The baron could not soothe his
“paddy”
By harking while some leading boy
Burst loudly into “Yip-i-addy!”
He could not feel a moistening eye
As someone (on a princely salary)
Warbled a strain repeated by
The fireman's inſant in the gallery.
Not his our laughter loud and free
At clowns who give policemen toko;
It was not even his to see
The humour of the ruby boko;
Some motley fool his ease beguiled,
Punning with tedious persistence,
A thought that makes me reconciled
To twentieth-century existence.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Simpkins, the agent, was not popular in Ballymoy, and
the question was how to get rid of him. The Rev. J. J.
Meldon's idea was to marry him to Mrs. Lorimer. Mrs.
Lorimer had just been acquitted on a charge of murdering
her husband, the general feeling being that she was lucky
to get off. In the Miss King who had taken Ballymoy
House, Meldon thought that he recognised Mrs. Lorimer;
if he could only induce Simpkins to marry her, there was a
chance that she might murder Simpkins too. As a casual
suggestion, thrown off after dinner, the joke would be well
enough; as the basis of a novel—even of a wild farce by
GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM—it does not bear emphasis. The
Simpkins Plot (NELSON) is written for the most part
in dialogue—or rather in monologue by Meldon, with occa-
sional interruptions from other characters. A sufficiently
humorous Meldon
sheer perversity, that's what it is. Kindly do that last
chapter over again, and bring back the ingots slung over ||
your shoulder in a sack this time, and we might call the
book Success, or something of that sort.”
When you begin to read Lady Fanny (METHUEN) the
chances are that you will consider it a very ordinary
society novel, a little more obviously feminine perhaps than
most, about a young wife who goes to Switzerland for a
“rest-cure” from a boring existence in the Shires, and is
there fallen in love with by two men, one of whom knows,
and the other does not know, that she is already married.
This, certainly, is the bare outline of the tale; but by the
time that Mrs. GEORGE NoFMAN has got fairly into her
stride, and you have been made acquainted with the
Brabazon party at Lucerne, the conviction will probably
dawn upon you that you are in for a usual story written
with a quite unusual degree of skill. Later, when Lady
Fanny has fled to Wolpera, and the affair of Prince Maurice
has developed it-
might have carried
the book to success;
Mr. BIRMINGHAM
has tried his hard-
est to make him
sufficiently humor-
ous, but he has only
succeeded in mak-
ing him a bore.

with delicacy and

No, Mr. MASEFIELD, I refuse to be put upon. When a
man starts a story with a mingled flavour of Kidnapped
and Treasure Island, steers us to the Spanish Main, and
then goes on to introduce Indians, and the gold of Incas
concealed in a desolate and mysterious temple, that man
has got to make his hero lift the treasure before the end
of the book, or I shall get my machete into his ribs. Of
course you will answer that your story is entitled Lost
Endeavour, and that I must have known what to expect
from the beginning. To that I can only reply that it
makes no difference, it's not cricket (or even pelota), and
that the name of your publisher is NELSON, who obviously
ought to have known better. He ought to have said, “Now,
Mr. MASEFIELD, you have a wonderfully fertile imagination,
and you know everything there is to be known about sailing
sloops and chopping a path through unexplored forests;
also you have given us some very pretty characters here,
notably Dick, the smuggler, and Mr. Theodore Mora, the
Spanish schoolmaster who was destined to be a god. Why
should you leave us with this unsatisfactory ending 2 It's
pect that Mrs. NoF- ||
MAN may have been as strongly moved in writing them,
because (though I hate, rather, to mention it) there were ||
certainly two instances in which her grammar would not
bear the cold light of reflection. But this, after all, is no
great matter. Syntax is of less value than sincerity; and
for this virtue above all others do I subscribe myself the
author's most appreciative and grateful debtor.

THOUGHTS ON THE COMING CENSU.S.–ll.
[If any member of a household is deaf and dumb, blind, a lunatic,
imbecile, or feeble-minded, the fact has to be given.]
WHEN last your father filled for you
The census-roll, he had no knotty
Riddles to guess; he knew your name,
Your age and health of mind and frame;
Thus: “Betty, spinster, 15.2,
Not deaf, nor blind, nor dumb, nor dotty.”
Since that occasion I have wooed
And found you stiff with indecision;
So if he knows the facts about
That fatal error he will doubt
Whether your senses still include
The almost priceless gift of Vision.
Blind to my charms! or, sadder yet,
You had your mental optics blinded ;
You loved my nose, but ſailed to trace
A corresponding inward grace,
And so your sire will have to set
His daughter down as feeble-minded.
I have admirers, men of weight,
Who hold that I, too, lost my head (you'll
Pardon this view); I, too, was blind
(To your defects of form and mind),
And ought to have my shocking state
Frankly recorded in the schedule.
Two cases, similarly sad'
Yet there's a solace to beguile 'em —
Let you and me, my dear, repair
Each to the other's arms, and there
Win what they need, the blind and mad—
A safe and permanent Asylum. O. S.
THE GREATEST LITTLE LION.
THE house was in that part of West Kensington which
is better known to its inhabitants as Kensington, W. My
host came out of his drawing-room the moment the bell
rang. It was his invariable custom thus to waylay the
arriving guest and whisper into his ear the names and
achievements of those already assembled. Everybody you
met thºre had achieved something.
On this occasion he wrestled with an unusual amount of
subdued triumph. “So glad you've come. You're just in
time to meet Evelyn Starker. Just dropped in quite
informally, you know. No ceremony or anything of that
sort.”
“Very glad to meet her,” I murmured.
“Her 1 My good man, you don't mean to say you
haven't heard of Evelyn Starker? You've read his books,
anyway. He wrote Fallacy or Phantasy and The Duke's
Diogenes and—and lots of others. Come on in. You'll
find him awfully affable and nice—considering what he is.”
I found the Greatest Little Lion standing with his
back to the fire. Before him in a semi-circle sat the
Great Little Lions. Beyond these stood a fringe of Lesser
Little Lions.
I was introduced to Mr. Starker. He acknowledged my
presence by closing his eyes for nine seconds and then
glancing in my direction for nearly two.
“Editors,” he remarked, “are consistent only in their
inconsistency.”
The Great Little Lions looked at each other in delighted
amazement, and I noticed one of the Lesser Little Lions
hastily scribbling upon his shirtcuff.
I shook my head. “I am not an Editor,” I said.
Mr. Starker started violently.” “I didn't say you were,”
he remarked shortly. “I was continuing the conversation
which was interrupted by your arrival.”
I retired hastily to the outer fringe of Lesser Little
Lions. The inner circle would have to turn right round
if they wanted to look at me like that again.
“Editors,” he continued, “so rarely recognise that they
are the slaves of the Contributor—and not his masters.”
“Hear! Hear!” roared four of the Lesser Little Lions
in chorus.
“I mean by “Contributor,’ of course, a man who has
made his mark in the literary world. I do not refer to
the legions of would-be Contributors who vent their spleen
and disappointment by abusing Editors.”
“Hear! Hear!” cried two of the Great Little Lions.
“I will give you an example which occurred to myself.
It was in connection with a paper which has established
for itself the reputation of being the leading journal of
poetic culture.”
“That's The Warbler,” explained our host in a stage
whisper. “He writes for it.”
“The Editor has actually had the impertinence to return
my work with criticisms on it!”
“Never!” roared the Lions of all degrees. “Impossible!”
“Criticise it and point out what he considered to be its
faults l''
“I wish more Editors would do that,” I said regretfully.
The Greatest Little Lion carefully adjusted his glasses,
put back his head, and regarded me with patronising
interest. “What would be an encouragement,” he said
slowly, “to a young beginner is, I repeat, an insult to
a man who wrote before the Editor of The Warbler had
ever been heard of. To criticise a finished author—”
He paused impressively.
“Oh, no,” I said. “Don’t say that. I expect you've only
run dry temporarily. All great writers suffer from that.”
Mr. Starker put his head back still further and blew
shortly and sharply through his nose.
The artist in the front row, who had “quite nearly"
had a picture hung, turned on me reprovingly. “Mr.
Starker never dries up,” she said.
The great author still regarded me fixedly. “Perhaps,”
he remarked ponderously, “we regard the matter from
opposite ends of the literary ladder. I repeat that I con-
sider it downright impertinence of the Editor to return
the work of a man who has published no fewer than five
books of serious verse.”
“But you have had something in The Warbler 2"
implored our host.
He stroked back his raven locks with one hand and
smiled quietly but triumphantly. -
“The Warbler published a little thing of mine called
‘Rulers of Rimmon about two years ago,” he remarked
with unconvincing carelessness.
“Ah!” said the Little Lions rapturously.
“Really? Was that yours?” I asked.
The Greatest Little Lion unbent. “Why? Did you
see it? Do you remember it after all this time?”
“I have got it pasted in a book at home,” I replied.
“Some day,” he said, beaming patronisingly upon me,
“people may cut out some of your work and paste it in a
book. Don't be disheartened. Go on trying. Remember
my encouragement next time you read my little poem
in your book.”
“I'm afraid I can't read it now,” I explained, when the
applause had subsided, “because it's on the sticky side.
You see, it happened to be printed on the back of one of
my own.”

Niece. “AUNTIE, Do come IN THE GARDEN–I want To show You To The Ducks.”
T H E C R. E. W.
(To F. C. B.)
LAST week it was my lot, dear FRANK,
A tow-path horse bestriding,
Along the Cam's familiar bank
To witch the world with riding.
With all the undergraduate's rash
Contempt of wintry weather
The zephyred crew set out to flash
Their eight blue blades together.
Their catch was fair, their swing was slow
(Though much their coxswain chid it);
Their faces showed they meant to row,
And pretty well they did it.
That arbiter of life and death,
Their coach, had lots to teach them;
He spoke a shade above his breath,
And thus contrived to reach them.
Beginnings were, he said, the root
Of his aquatic system;
The lack of these entailed the “boot"—
He marvelled why they missed 'em.
And, not as one who quoted hymns,
But yet with moderation,
He mentioned all their youthful limbs
And each articulation.
He praised a wrist, reproved an arm;
Their legs, he thought, were so-so.
Their hands, he added, did the harm
And really made them row so.
“Your strokes,” he said, “should be designed
With something nearer vigour.
Reach out and grip it well behind,
And dislocate your rigger.”
And so with many a cheerful shout
He scored his patient eight off,
Declaring Three must hold it out
And Six must get his weight off;
With wise advice to all the rest:
How they might charm beholders
With straightened back, or bulging chest,
Or hips, or knees, or shoulders.
He spoke them fair, he spoke them free,
Imparting stacks of knowledge,
And did his best that each should be
A credit to his College,
And row the race so well that you
And I may see them win it,
P.S.. I write about the crew
Because your grandson's in it! TIs.

minster Gazette.

IITTLE PLAYS FOR AMATEURS.
IV.—“AT DEAD OF NIGHT.”
The stage is in semi-darkness as Dick
Trayle throws open the window
rom outside, puts his knee on the
sill, and falls carefully into the
drawing-room of Beeste Hall. He
is dressed in a knickerbocker suit
with arrows on it (such as can
always be borrowed from a friend),
and, to judge from the noises which
he emits, is not in the best of train-
ing. The lights go on suddenly;
and he should seize this moment to
stagger to the door and turn on the
switch. This done he sinks into the
nearest chair and closes his eyes.
If he has been dancing very late
the night before he may drop into a
peaceful sleep; in which case the
play ends here. Otherwise, no
sooner are his eyes closed than he
opens them with a sudden start and
looks round in terror.
Dick (striking the keynote at once).
No, no! Let me out—I am innocent
(He gives a gasp of relief as he realises
the situation.) Free! It is true, then
I have escaped l I dreamed that I was
back in prison again l (He shudders
, and helps himself to a large whisky-and-
soda, which he swallows at a gulp.)
That's better! Now I feel a new man
—the man I was three years ago.
It has been a lifetime !
(Pathetically to the audience.) Where
is Millicent now 2
[He falls into a reverie, from which
he is suddenly wakened by a moise
outside. He starts, and then creeps
rapidly to the switch, arriving there
at the moment when the lights go
out. Thence he goes swiftly behind
the window curtain. The lights go
wp again as Jasper Beeste comes in
with a revolver in one hand and a
bull's-eye lantern of apparently
enormous candle power in the other.
Jasper (in immaculate evening dress).
I thought I heard a noise, so I slipped
on some old things hurriedly and came
down. (Fingering his perfectly - tied
tie.) But there seems to be nobody
here. (Turns round suddenly to the
window.) Ha, who's there? Hands
up, blow you—(He ought to swear rather
badly here, really)—hands up, or I fire
[The stage is suddenly plunged into
darkness, there is the moise of a
struggle, and the lights go on to
reveal Jasper by the door covering
Dick with his revolver.
Jasper. Let's have a little light on
you. (Brutally.) Now then, my man,
what have you got to say for yourself 2
Ha! An escaped convict, eh?
Dick (to himself in amazement). Jas-
per Beeste!
Jasper. So you know my name?
Dick (in the tones of a man whose
whole life has been blighted by the
machinations of a false friend). Yes,
Jasper Beeste, I know your name. For
two years I have said it to myself every
night, when I prayed Heaven that I
should meet you again.
Jasper. Again? (Uneasily.) Wehave
met before ?
Dick (slowly). We have met before,
Jasper Beeste. Since then I have lived
a lifetime of misery. You may well fail
to recognise me.
[Enter Millicent Wilsdon — in a
dressing-gown, with her hair over
her shoulders, if the county will
stand it.
Millicent (to Jasper). I couldn't sleep
—I heard a noise—I—(suddenly seeing
the other) Dick' (She trembles.)
Dick. Millicent 1 (He trembles too.)
Jasper. Trayle ! (So does he.)
Dick (bitterly). You shrink from me,
Millicent. (With strong common sense)
What is an escaped convict to the
beautiful Miss Wilsdon ?
Millicent. Dick—I—you—when you
were sentenced
Dick. When I was sentenced—the
evidence was black against me, I admit
—I wrote and released you from your
engagement. You are married now 2
Millicent (throwing herself on a sofa).
Oh, Dick |
Jasper (recovering himself). Enough
of this. Miss Wilsdon is going to
marry me to-morrow.
Dick. To marry you ! (He strides
over to the sofa and pulls Millicent to
her feet.) Millicent, look me in the
eyes! Do you love him 2 (She turns
away.) Say “Yes” and I will go back
quietly to my prison. (She raises her
eyes to his.) Ha! I thought so ! You
don't love him 1 Now then I can speak.
Jasper (advancing threateningly). Yes,
to your friends the warders. Millicent,
ring the bell. -
Dick (wresting the revolver from his
grasp). Ha, would you? Now stand
over there and listen to me. (He
arranges his audience, Millicent on a sofa
on the right, Jasper, biting his finger
mails, on the left.) Three years ago
Lady Wilsdon's diamond necklace was
stolen. My flat was searched and the
necklace was found in my hatbox.
Although I protested my innocence I
was tried, found guilty, and sentenced
to ten years penal servitude, followed
by fifteen years police supervision.
Millicent (raising herself on the sofa).
Dick, you were innocent—I know it.
(She flops back again.)
Dick. I was. But how could I prove
it? I went to prison. For a year
black despair gnawed at my heart. And
then something happened. The pri-
soner in the cell next to mine tried to
communicate with me by means of taps.
We soon arranged a system and held
conversations together. One day he
told me of a robbery in which he and
another man had been engaged—the
robbery of a diamond necklace.
Jasper (jauntily). Well?
Dick (sternly). A diamond necklace,
Jasper Beeste, which the other man hid |
in the hatbox of another man in order
that he might woo the other man's
fiancée 1 (Millicent shrieks.)
Jasper (blusteringly). Bah! -
Dick (quietly). The man in the cell
next to mine wants to meet this gen- |
tleman again. It seems that he has
some old scores to pay off.
Jasper (sneeringly). And where is he?
Dick. Ah, where is he? (He goes to
the window and gives a low whistle.
A Stranger in knickerbockers jumps in
and advances with a crab-like move-
ment.) Good! here you are. Allow
me to present you to Mr. Jasper Beeste.
Jasper (in horror). Two-toed Thomas!
I am undone !
Two-toed Thomas (after a series of
unintelligible snarls). Say the word,
guv'nor, and I'll kill him. (He prowls
round Jasper thoughtfully.)
Dick (sternly). Stand back! Now,
Jasper Beeste, what have you to say?
Jasper (hysterically). I confess. I
will sign anything. I will go to prison.
Only keep that man off me.
Dick (going up to a bureau and writ-
ing aloud at incredible speed). “I,
Jasper Beeste, of Beeste Hall, do hereby
declare that I stole Lady Wilsdon's
diamond necklace and hid it in the hat-
box of Richard Trayle; and I further
declare that the said Richard Trayle
is innocent of any complicity in the
affair.” (Advancing with the paper and
a fountain pen.) Sign, please.
[Jasper signs. At this moment two
warders burst into the room.
First Warder. There they are
[He seizes Dick. Two-toed Thomas
leaps from the window, pursued by
the second Warder. Millicent picks
alp the confession and advances
dramatically.
Millicent. Do not touch that man
Read this
[She hands him the confession with
an air of superb pride.
First Warder (reading). Jasper
Beeste! (Slipping a pair of handcuffs
on Jasper.) You come along with me,
my man. We've had our suspicions
of you for some time. (To Millicent,
with a nod at Dick) You'll look after
that gentleman, miss?
Millicent. Of course ! Why, he's
engaged to me. Aren't you, Dick?
Dick. This time, Millicent, for ever!

RECORD NOVELIST.
INTERVIEw witH Mr. SILA SHOCKING.
A GREAT MANUFACTURER.
MR. SILA SHOCKING is indeed to be
envied. Though still in the prime of
life—he wears a full beard hardly
touched with grey, and is the proud
possessor of a golf handicap of 36—hé
is admittedly the Captain-General of
the most typical modern industry—
that of novel-making. The Daily
Chronicle has already told us the thril-
ling history of his early years and the
noble principles which inform his new
masterpiece, a great cricketing story
with a strong ethical interest, which is
appearing serially in a leading journal,
but some further particulars, gleaned
by a plucky representative of Punch,
who scaled the heights of Highgate in
the pursuance of his duty, may not be
unacceptable to those who love to learn
of the prosperity of our prominent
penmen.
In his early years, Mr. Shocking was
almost entirely immersed in the study
of theology, metaphysics, conchology
and kindred subjects, but the call of
romance was not to be resisted, though
for long he turned a deaf ear to these
siren voices. “Often enough,” he said,
“the impulse came upon me, and plots
evolved themselves almost uncon-
sciously in my mind, but I put the
temptation aside. It was not till many
years had elapsed that I became con-
vinced that my capacity for influencing
my fellow men for good would be
enormously enhanced by my abandon-
ing the pulpit for the pen—by my
turning my sermons into novels. Since
then my pen, or perhaps I should say
my phonograph, has known no rest.
The process of preparation is arduous,
involving long journeys, nights spent
in sleeping-cars, horseback riding—
I was once run away with by a Mexican
mustang, another time I was badly
shaken by a fall from a camel in Egypt
—but when once my material is col-
lected it is plain sailing. Formerly
I wrote, now I dictate everything to
the phonograph.”
“Have you any time for meals 2"
timidly queried our representative.
“Not much,” replied the intrepid
littérateur. “A thimbleful of tea at
8 a.m., a hasty snack at 1 o'clock, and
a poached egg and a banana before I
retire to rest at 12.30—that is my usual
regimen. I drink barley-water most
days, but in the summer I own to a
weakness for gingerbeer and raspberry
vinegar.” -
“Do you hold any views on the
Bread question ?"
“Yes,” replied Mr. Shocking, “I am
a whole-hearted whole-mealer.
I once!
wrote a novel on a diet of white bread,
but it barely sold 100,000 copies. It
was a romance of the Cornish Riviera
describing the abortive attempt of a
South African millionaire to establish
a Casino at Tintagel, and his terrible
end. I took the greatest pains to make
my meaning perfectly and unmistakably
clear. But somehow or other my
tragedy and comedy became hopelessly
and inextricably mixed, and my char-
acters became quite unmanageable.
The book, in short, was a failure, and
I only cleared £5,000 by the sales.”
Turning to the question of his colossal
clientèle, Mr. Shocking said that his
readers could be numbered by millions
in the Midlands before the sale of his
books climbed into hundreds of thou-
sands in London. It was only by
degrees that he had stormed the citadel
of metropolitan fame, and even still
there were houses in Mayfair where
his name was practically unknown, ex-
cept in the basement. Of late, too, he
had begun to sell widely in the Isle of
Man and Stratford-on-Avon in spite of
strenuous local competition. Beyond
these areas, Manchuria, Japan, Korea,
Heligoland and the Falkland Islands
were countries where Mr. Shocking's
stories are every day gaining a wider
vogue. Translations already exist in
Romany, Urdu, Basque, Aztec and
Esperanto.
The statistics relating to Mr. Shock-
ing's output are worth recording. The
total number of copies of his books in
circulation is estimated at ten quintill-
ions (it will be remembered that a
quintillion=a billion penillions). The
paper on which these copies is printed,
if spread out flat, would carpet the
entire Solar system, and, if piled in a
vertical heap, would reach to Mars.
The amount of printer's ink consumed
on these immortal tomes would fill the
Caspian Sea. In writing his books,
again, before he took to the phono-
graph, Mr. Shocking used up 2,743
º pens, 590 stylographs, 411 foun-
tain pens, and 33,775 steel nibs. The
process of revision accounted for
three tons of blue lead, and 70,398
sheets of blotting-paper were ex-
hausted in drying the manuscript.
Furthermore Mr. Shocking has, in the
search for the requisite local colour,
travelled 30,000 miles on bicycles,
160,000 miles in motor cars, and 24,000
miles on donkeys, camels and elephants.
Mr. Shocking has been interviewed in
all nearly five thousand times, and
he is the proud recipient of the Order
of the Purple Patch (Servia), the Golden
Gasometer (Costa Rica), and the Hokey
Fly (Ireland), besides being an Honorary
LL.D. of the University of Tipper-
usalem, and a D.D., of Monte Carlo.

TO THE PERENNIAL RABBIT.
THE Savage by primeval Thames,
Lurking, the mammoth to waylay,
Amid the awful forest stems,
On some far, dim, forgotten day,
As that vast bulk of brawn and beef
Squelched off unscathed through lone
moraSSes,
Would turn, I doubt not, with relief
To where you scuttled in the grasses!
Perhaps my cave-man blood's to blame,
For—atavistic taint—I too
Have dropped a more exacting game,
Bunny, to have a bang at you;
The driven partridge missed in front,
And eke behind, lacks serious merit
Beside a sunny hedge-row hunt,
A terrier and an active ferret !
Give me a summer afternoon,
An air-gun and the drone of bees,
The water-meadows lush with June,
A stalk among the Alderneys;
Then, hit or miss, I care no-ways,
In such surroundings I consider
You're worth a hundred storm-swept
braes
And all the royals in Balquidder!
Indeed, wherever I may go,
Tºº summer woods, by wintry
fell,
I've found you, in the sun or snow,
A friendly little Ishmael;
Along the southern trout-stream banks,
Or with the ptarmigan consorting,
You've always earned my grateful
thanks,
And in all seasons acted sporting !
Hushed is the hairy mammoths' roar
And gone the mastodon uncouth
Down to decay with dinosaur,
Aurochs, and fearsome sabre-tooth;
But you, small beast in hodden-gray,
Survive, and will, I take for granted,
Be here when I am dust, to play
In moonlit covers still unplanted

of impending peril has always nerved heroic souls to
make their supremest efforts. There must be no falter-

THE SCHOOL FOR WARIETY.
MR. GRAYson recommends the estab-
lishment of a school for music-hall
artistes so that the public may be
spared some of the less successful turns.
SCENE–Comic-patter class.
Professor.—It is a wise plan to think
out all one's jokes for one imaginary
person in the audience and never get
above his head. A typical gallery boy
for choice or, when addressing the
ladies, a gallery girl. It is true that
other people will be in the hall, but
if you can make these two laugh you
will make enough of the others laugh
also; never by any chance say anything
new or fine. Keep it all to the lowest
level by cynicism and suspicion. See
the worst of everything and everybody.
For example, if you sing about the sea
let it be either of the sickness upon it,
the fleas in the lodging houses beside
it, or the adventurer on the pier who
took your watch and chain. Remember
that in any narrative there is nothing
really funny but failure. For briefer
gags bear in mind that all music-hall
audiences are conservative; and it has
become safe and popular to use what-
ever language you like about both the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER and
the Home SECRETARY. After that there
are always sausages and bananas and
kippers; the mere mention of such will
convulse any audience.
SCENE–Pronunciation Class.
Professor. Take great pains to keep |
your voice strictly to street pitch, and
with a street accent. I mean, of course,
those of you who are not Scotch or
Lancashire comedians. These may do
as they like when in any towns not in
Scotland or Lancashire. But all you
London singers must be most scrupu-
lous to retain your cockneyisms. Thus,
when singing of, say, a man named
Brown living in London town, be
watchful to say both “Breown” and
“teown.” Much depends on it.
SCENE–The Serio-Comic Class.
Professor. The first thing, Ladies (or
shall I say, “Dears”), that I want you
to understand is that the seat of the
serio-comic voice, if it is to be success-
ful, is not the chest, but the back of the
head. Some of you seem to have
acquired the elements of voice-produc-
tion. These you must forget as quickly
as possible. The music-hall public does
not want anything but what it has had
for generations. Remember that. It
expects heady nasal notes, and you
must give them. -
SCENE–Comic Costume Class.
Professor. The first essential of a
comic singer's clothes is that they do
not fit. If they fit, the song cannot
be comic, whatever the words. Some
of you, I see, have trousers that are not
patched. What kind of chance in the
profession you expect, I cannot imagine.
Others have shirts when the simplest
gallery boy knows that, when the
waistcoat is lifted up (being made
loose for that purpose), a dicky should
be all that can be seen, or, possibly,
in really funny men, a pair of very
ancient corsets. Thus attired you will
succeed in whatever you sing: there
will be enough members of every
audience to persuade the rest that you
are funny. The boots should be too
large, the hat too small. Paint your
nose red, your mouth large, and give
your eyebrows an arch. Never omit
to carry a stick, as every time you hit
yourself it will convince your audience
that your last remark was a joke, and
they will laugh, and the more they
laugh the better for you. That indeed
is why your clothes have to be so
carefully thought out: it is so that
immediately you are seen the audience
will know you are funny and will be
practically bound to laugh. It is a
kind of hypnotism.

Tuesday, Jan. 31.—New Parliament
meets for first Session. Quite exciting
scene in Lobby. Everybody shaking
hands with WILLIAM Jones, who, hat-
less and smiling, bustles about. That
he should smile not an uncommon
thing. That everyone should, after brief
parting, want to shake hands with him
equally habitual. But where's his hat?
Can it be that, owing to LLOYD GEORGE's
financial extortions, he has been obliged
to “put it down,” as millionaires and
landlords have under same malign in-
fluence “put down” carriages, horses
and the odd boy in the garden 2
This question murmured by stranger
looking on. Old Parliamentary Hands
recognise the sign. According to quaint
custom, whose origin is lost in the murk
of dead centuries, a Whip never shows
himself in the Lobby with his hat on.
One remembers how, when Tweed-
MoUTH occasionally visited scene of the
labours of Edward MARJoRIBANKs,
Liberal Whip in Mr. G.'s last Adminis-
tration, he was for a moment hardly
recognisable under his hat. WILLIAM
Jones comes to new Parliament a
Junior Lord of the Treasury, enrolled
among the Whips under the Master-
ship of ELIBANK.
Off with his hat. So much for North
Carnarvon.
Appointment not one of high degree,
such as a Secretaryship of State with
seat in the Cabinet. But it distinctly
strengthens position of Government by
increasing its corporate popularity.
Only drawback to satisfaction shared
equally in both political camps is that
the Member for North Carnarvon hence-
forward must needs give up to the
Whips' Room what was meant for
mankind in the House. Simple, un-
affected, undervaluing himself, he is
one of the most eloquent speakers
known at Westminster during last
fifteen years. The unwritten law which
forbids a Whip to wear his hat in the
Lobby also precludes him from taking
part in debate. Thus the House be-
comes the poorer by a well-merited
and universally acclaimed promotion.
Business done.—Mr. LowTHER elected
Speaker for fourth time.

scene, watching Members struggling

without opposition for one of the many
Universities on whose rolls of honour his
name stood high, HENRY BUTCHER
looked forward with keen interest to
the coming Session. Sickening with a
vague disease, he, shortly after the
General Election, took to his bed and
died, whilst others were preparing for
the fray at Westminster.
His name did not loom large in the
eye of the public. It appeared but
rarely in the Parliamentary reports.
But in the House, as in the Universi-
ties, his unobtrusive personality was
equally admired and esteemed. Con-
servative representative of an exclusive
community, he was singularly broad-
minded in his views, ever courteous in
manner.
A scholar of rare distinction, a
speaker of polished lucidity, intimately
acquainted with the drift of public
affairs, he was of the limited group of
men who are the salt of the mélange
of humanity that goes to make up the
House of Commons,

some catch in that ; but, ...]." the question as a mathematical

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
THE CRIMINAL.
THE accused with great precision
arranged himself into a semi-circle on
the hearthrug, indolently wagged his
tail, and fell into a peaceful sleep.
Despite this evidence of a clear con-
science, the pleading face of the sup-
pliant showed signs of agitation.
“He didn't do it. I'm certain he
didn't,” she protested.
“That,” I informed her, “is the atti-
tude of the Defence all the world over,
and carries no conviction.”
She made an effort to smile, in case
. remark was funny, and edged her-
self between the object of my wrath
and me.
“Besides,” she said, with that depth
of scorn in her voice to which youth
alone can reach, “it was only a slipper.”
The suppliant threw herself on the
ground by the accused, and roused him
from sleep by kissing the tip of his ear.
“He wouldn't do a naughty thing
like that, would he?” she asked.
He looked up at me with deliberate
innocence and slowly licked his lips.
“He convicts himself,” I said, “out
of his own mouth.”
The Defence was equal to the occa-
sion.
“If he did then,” she informed me
in a phrase choking with verbs, “I
don't believe he could have known he
mustn't. It's no good smacking him
if he doesn't know he's been naughty,
is it 2 ''
I raised a threatening hand at him.
With limp tail he skirted the arm-
chair and took refuge under the sofa.
“Is that,” I inquired, “the action of
a dog conscious of moral rectitude 2"
She clung desperately to my hand.
“But there's no need to punish him
now that he owns he's done wrong, is
there 2 " she said.
Directing my voice towards that end
of the sofa beneath which I imagined
the dog to be now cowering, I made an
inquiry regarding the whereabouts of
a certain whip.
With my mangled slipper in his
mouth, the accused brazenly stepped
out from the sanctuary of the sofa and,
after gazing fondly into my eyes, sat
demurely at my feet and tried to stare
my lowest boot button out of counte-
Ilan Ce.
“Is this,” I asked, “the shamed
attitude of the penitent?”
Now that punishment seemed in-
evitable, there was, on the part of the
Defence, an accommodating change of
front. Aware that her pleading for
the accused had left me unmoved, the
Suppliant assumed an expression of
stern and inexorable wrath.
“The wicked dog," she exclaimed,

“Difficult as it may be,” I said,
“you must endeavour to restrain your
righteous indignation. His behaviour
convinces me that punishment would
be wasted on him. There is nothing
for us to do but to assume he has no
moral sense.”
She gave a sigh of relief as she
climbed on to my knee.

ELECTION SEQUELS.
LAw Courts DELUGED WITH LIBEL
Actions.
INTEREstiNG echoes of the General
Election (which, it may be remembered,
was held towards the end of last year)
will shortly be heard in the Law
Courts, and we are fortunate in being
able to give our readers advance details
of some of the more important libel
actions that are down for hearing.
BULLION v. Blood.
One of the earliest on the list is
connected with the exciting contest in
West Toffshire, where Sir John Bullion,
| Bt., the well-known City magnate and
former Liberal Member for the division,
succumbed by only three votes to the
Hon. Arthur Blood, younger son of
Lord Backwood. It is alleged that on
the eve of the poll the Unionist Candi-
date distributed a circular to the
electors making a personal attack on
his opponent, and containing in par-
ticular the following paragraph —
“Quite apart from questions of Party
politics, it is in the highest degree
essential that, for the sake of its good
name, West Toffshire should be repre-
sented in Parliament by a well-dressed
man. Can it be said that Sir John
Bullion fulfils this condition ? One or
two facts will suffice by way of answer.
| On December 5 the Radical Candidate
was seen to address a meeting with
one trouser-leg turned up and the other
down. On the following day he toured
the constituency in a frock-coat and a
bowler-hat. And, worst of all,
he buys his clothes in the City'
Blectors, think of your reputation, and
WoTE For BLOOD AND STYLE | "
In his affidavit Sir John characterises
the allegation touching his trouser-legs
as a malicious invention, and affirms
that the second charge made against
him contains a serious suppressio veri,
inasmuch as no mention is made of the
fact that on the day in question his
| frock-coat was covered by a stylish
overcoat with velvet collar. Sir John
further states that the circular, which
was issued too late to permit of a con-
tradiction, lost him the seat, brought
him into social disrepute, and caused
him great distress of mind. With
regard to the general appearance of
plaintiff's clothes (whose civic origin
is not denied), several sartorial experts
are being called to give evidence on
either side.
“THE PEOPLE's Food.”
Some significant revelations are pro-
mised in the action which Mr. Will
Barrow, who unsuccessfully contested
Grimesby as an Independent Working
Man, is bringing against Mr. Alf Pint,
the Labour Party's nominee. Mr.
Barrow complains that during the cam-
paign his opponent repeatedly made a
most dastardly allegation against him,
to the effect that he (Mr. Barrow) was
“the sort of man who never stood a
pal a glass.” Unfortunately, owing to
the stringent provisions of the Corrupt
Practices Act (which many leading
politicians in the district would like to
see amended), plaintiff was unable
during the course of the election to
disprove the charge in a practical
manner, and was even debarred from
promising to do so on the conclusion
of the contest. Such a statement was
bound to exercise a tremendous in-
fluence over the electors of Grimesby,
where beer is the principal article of
food, and in consequence, Mr. Barrow
asserts, he only polled seventy-eight
votes against over ten thousand given
for the Labour Candidate. The case
will be followed with great interest
by the local publicans.
WHAT DID HE MEAN ?
The contest in Puddenhead will long
be remembered by the inhabitants of
the division as one of the most em-
bittered in its history, and little sur-
prise will be caused by the announce-
ment that Mr. Ebenezer Bloggs, who
championed the cause of Tariff Reform,
is instituting an action for libel against
the newly-elected Member. Mr. Bloggs
takes exception most of all to a poster
with which the entire town was
placarded, and which bore the follow-
ing words in huge letters:—
“Don’t Vote for Bloggs. For years
he has been Continually Growing
Madder! Plump for SAwNER and
SANITY.”
Plaintiff contends that this state-
ment imputes mental infirmity to him,
and was evidently so interpreted by a
majority of the electorate, since there
could not conceivably be any other
reason for his defeat. Defendant, how-
ever, repudiates all knowledge of the
poster in question, and alternatively
denies that the words complained of
bear the construction put upon them,
and further pleads that they are liter-
ally true, plaintiff being the head of
the dyeing firm of Bloggs & Son, which
is engaged in the cultivation of madder.
In reply Mr. Bloggs has filed an affi-
davit stating that for some years, owing
to the increased rigour of foreign com-
petition caused by our so-called Free
Trade system, he has had to give up
growing any madder.
AN ECHO of BILLINGsditch.
Damages to the amount of £10,000
are being claimed by the Conservative
Candidate for Billingsditch against The
Billingsditch Observer. It is com-
plained that an article appeared in the
local organ stating, among other things,
that the Candidate in question had
opposed in Parliament the provision
of free life-annuities for every man,
woman, and child in the United King-
dom. This, plaintiff says, is a gross
distortion of the truth, the real facts
of the case being that, in a speech
delivered in the House of Commons,
he actually spoke in favour of the pro-
posal, his sole protest being directed
against the reprehensible procedure by
which it was “tacked ” on to a Budget
Bill. The allegation, he maintains,
constitutes a most damaging reflection
upon his character, holding him up to
popular execration as a monster of in-
humanity, callous to the sufferings of
the poor, and deaf to their legitimate
demands upon the State. It was also
the cause of intense mental and physical
discomfort to him during the Billings-
ditch Election.
MostMore NCY or 2
Yet another case—that of Mont-
morency v. Grab– is likely to prove
especially rich in piquant details. The
plaintiff is Mr. A. Fitzalan Montmor-
ency, who conducted so strenuous an
anti-alien campaign in the Crackling
Division of Porkshire, and who grounds
his present action on the fact that his
Socialist opponent placarded the con-
stituency with the legend:—
“Where was Montmorency when
the Light went out?”
Mr. Montmorency denies that his
name is really identical with that of
the great Hebrew law-giver, as he de-
clares this query to suggest, and says
that he is taking this step to vindicate
his character in public as a true
Briton, patriot and Christian gentle-
man. Among Mr. Grab's witnesses,
we understand, are a number of gentle-
men resident in Whitechapel, including
Mr. Montmorency's father.

“There were 1,190 inmates in the Tranmere
Workhouse, as against 1,191 for the corre-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
- (By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE present edition of Tillers of the Soil should be
recalled and a second published with print enlarged, cover
brightened, and preface omitted. The first sight of so much
small print depresses an eye already a little discouraged
by the severity of the cover, and Mr. J. E. PATTERSoN's
apology for his methods does no more than put the reader
on his look-out for faults, which he would not have otherwise
noticed and which probably do not exist. For the book itself
is bound to be a pleasure to all who love the land or can
appreciate in others a passion they do not feel. For my-
self, a townsman, I was made intimate with agricultural
conditions and even canvassed in the matter of certain
farmers' grievances and their proposed remedy, without
having my entertainment suspended for a moment. Abe
Shuttleworth, a cheerful -
farmer with large ideals,
an unruly tongue and
an irresistible opti-
mism, is certainly a
person to meet, and I
know of few better por-
traits in fiction of an
ardent reformer with a
past—a past which re-
appears in the midst of
the reforms and be-
comes only too present.
With the exception of
Ola, his in definite
daughter, and Lucian,
her American and poeti-
cally-inclined lover, the
minor characters are
most natural and true
to their rural environ-
ment. The Rector is
perhaps a little too
narrow, but the rectory
party are delightfully
fussy and typical. I

idea of listening for the footsteps of a man who is always
coming up behind me and passing the molecules of his
body through the molecules of mine, until at last I go mad
and kill myself in my efforts to get rid of him. Nor, if I
were a sculptor, should I care to achieve fame in the hour
of my death by the crazy design of exerting my will-power
to force my own flesh and blood and bone into the marble
of my chef d'ouvre. Weirdly imaginative, and with an
uncanny air of unreality, often effectively heightened by
the skilful way in which Philistinism and art and the
material and spirit worlds are placed side by side, these
stories by Mr. ONIons are told so cleverly that some readers
might find that almost they persuade them to be believers
in Ghaisties and Ghoulies and long-leggity Beasties and
Things that go Bump in the day as well as in the night.
Sleuth-hound fiction has already scented out a style of
its own; the characters talk in a kind of correct journalese
- which takes no account
of idiosyncrasies, when
they narrate their past
histories or the terrible
events which have re-
cently happened to
them. For this reason
Gilead Balm (FISHER
UNwiN), which is Mr.
BERNARD CAPEs's in-
cursion into this species
of romance, suffers from
a certain lack of homo-
geneousness, since the
author every now and
then shows glimpses of
|his real self and allows |
flashes of humour or
pages of really literary
description to intrude
into the story. Gilead

There are onions that make you weep, and onions, as
the Athenian hoplites knew, that make you warlike, or
perhaps that make your enemies take to their heels. There
is also, in a class by himself, Mr. Oliver ONIONs, who
wants to make your flesh creep. The text of his book,
Widdershins (MARTIN SECKER), is the quaint petition for
deliverance “From Ghaisties, Ghoulies, and long-leggity
Beasties and Things that go Bump in the night.” Its
title means—in what language I know not—“Contrary to
the course of the Sun,” that is to say, contrary, as I hope,
to Nature. For I should not at all like to think that the
creepy happenings described in these extremely ghoulish
stories could possibly come my way. I don't want to be
driven to starve myself by a beckoning fair one who haunts
my rooms, paralyses my work, slays my love, and causes
my arrest as a suspected murderer. Nor do I relish the
cases of distress.

In pursuit of this generous avocation
the author has allowed his hero to range through a con-
siderable variety of cases, from the purely comic to the
mysterious and spiritualistic, but always with the detection
of crime as a dominant motive. There is no one like
Mr. BERNARD CAPEs for describing the horrors of a dark
and empty house; he has some very ingenious ideas for
crimes, and he often says some very good things; as for
instance, “But if there is no morality in art, you can
hardly expect it of its dealers; ” and therefore, although
he has been unable to maintain the dead level of melo-
drama which is the tradition of this kind of novel, I can
confidently recommend Gilead Balm to those in search of
yet another literary hair-tonic.

OF A WELL-KNOWN PARROT,
NOW MORIBUND.
[If Imperial Preference has been killed by the proposed Reciprocity
Agreement between Canada and the United States, as the Radicals
cheerfully assert, then they cannot have much further use for the
election cry of Dearer F.'which has done them so great service in
the past.]
A PRINCE of parrots, such as seize
Upon the spoken word,
Master of one most poignant wheeze—
The deadliest ever heard,
He stood apart without a peer, this undefeated birdl
For years he worked the old refrain—
“You R Food will cost You MoRe "—
Without a sign to show the strain
Had left his larynx sore:
| Until the thing became a most abominable bore.
The Liberals loved to hear that cry
Boom like an eight-inch gun;
The moment-he began to try,
Election-wars were won;
But now I fear he's on the moult; I fear his day is done.
He had but this one phrase in stock
Touching your loaf's expense;
It's single purpose was to knock
Imperial Preference:
But now the point of that remark has ceased to give offence.
For lo! the Tory fiend that he
Laid himself out to slay
Has died of Reciprocity:
Imp. Preſ, in fact, is clay;
And cannot be expected to resume the hoary fray.
That was the one he used to keep
His beady eye upon,
And now, with Food for ever Cheap.
His occupation 's gone, /
There seems no reason why the bird should care to linger on.
Then, Liberals all, prepare the bier
Whereon to lay your dead
Who might have stopped his ſoe's career
By screeching off his head,
Only the latter went and died another death instead.
And Tories, too, when o'er your friend
You raise a pious howl,
And tears for his untimely end
Bedew the haggard jowl,
Spare one, in courtesy, for this indomitable fowl |

She. Oh yes, I do. I appreciate everything.
He. Well, what do you want?
She. What's the time?
He. Something struck just now.
She. I know ; what was it 2
He. I didn't notice.
She. Can't you see the clock 2
He, No. Can't you ?
She. I could if I lifted my head, but I can't lift it.
He. And I can't pull my watch out. Makes me shiver

She, Don't you think we've got intluenza very badly?
He, Yes—at least I know I have. I'm cobso sure about you.
She. I'm sure nothing could be worse than mine.
He, You can't know how bad mine is.
She. If you don't admit that mine s worse than yours,
I'll never speak to you again.
He, Oh, very well! Have it your own way.
She. That's not an admission.
He. If you talk to me like that I shall cry—l know I shall.
She. You'd have been crying long ago if you'd only got

He. I have, and much worse too.

He, Eſave you got aches and pains all over your back?

He, Yes, I've got nothing but bones, and they're all in

She. Except your backbone. You said you hadn't any

He, I haven't got a backbone.

He, Nor can I.

He. What are the children doing?
She. Children 2 What children?
He. Haven't we got any children?
She. Let me think. There were some children about

He. I'm going to have a pino-menthol lozenge.
She. Do. And I'll have a eucalyptus lozenge.
He. I shall take two.
She. You mustn't overdo it, Charles.
He. I see what it is. You want to rob me of all my
little luxuries, but I'll take two all the same. [Takes two.

Tell me, young man, the nature of your revels
When not on duty: do you dance or rink?

And (this is most important) do you smoke?
Immobile-featured as a marble statue,
You stare me in the eyes, ingenuous youth;
You make no answer to my questions, drat you!
No sound of sorrow, mirthfulness, or ruth;
Either because you think I'm getting at you
Or (much more probably, to tell the truth)
Because I have not said these things aloud,
Let me get on, then. Do you know the fevers
Of common men on earth, unskilled to slam
The irrevocable gates and ply the levers?

Through “faëry lands forlorn" of light and myth,
Shunted to Finsbury Park or Hammersmith?
And does some damsel greet you with embraces,
Some charming girl about to be your wife,
And bid you tell her of adventurous cases,
The haps and hazards of your strange stern life?
The whims of passengers, their clothes and faces,
Whether they touched the gates, and all the strife?
And does she call you Alf, or Herb, or Reub 2

These things I cannot answer, and it's wearing
To go on talking bunkum all in vain;
But some day I have sworn that, greatly daring,

LITTLE PLAYS FOR AMATEURS.
W.—“THE LOST HEIREss.”
The Scene is laid outside a village inn
in that county of curious dialects,
Loamshire. The inn is easily
indicated by a round table bearing
two mugs of liquid, while a fallen
log emphasises the rural mature of
the scene. Gaffer Jarge and Gaffer
Willyum are seated at the table,
surrounded by a fringe of whisker,
Jarge being slightly more of a
gaffer than Willyum.
Jarge (who missed his dinner through
nervousness and has been ordered to sus-
tain himself with soup—as he puts
down the steaming mug). Eh, bor, but
this be rare beer. So it be.
Willyum (who had too much dinner
and is now draining his samatogen). You
be right, Gaffer Jarge. Her be main rare
beer. (He feels up his sleeve, but thinking
better of it wipes his mouth with the
back of his nand.) Main rare beer, zo
her be. º:
Jarge. Did I ever tell 'ee, bor, about
t' new squoire o' these parts—him wot
cum hum yesterday from furren lands?
Gaffer Henry wora-telling me.
Willyum (privately bored). Thee didst
tell 'un, lad, sartain sure thee didst.
And Gaffer Henry, he didst tell 'un
too. But tell 'un again. It du megaod
to hear 'un, Zo it du. Zure-lie.
Jarge. A raekun it be a main queer
tale, queerernor any them writing chaps
tell about. It wor like this. (Dropping
into English, in his hurry to get his
long speech over before he forgets it.}
The old Squire had a daughter who
disappeared when she was three weeks
old, eighteen years ago. It was always
thought she was stolen by somebody,
and the Squire would have it that she
was still alive. When he died a year
ago he left the estate and all his money
to a distant cousin in Australia, with
the condition that if he did not dis-
cover the missing baby within twelve
months everything was to go to the
hospitals. (Remembering his smock and
whiskers with a start.) And here du be
the last day, zo it be, and tº Squoire's
daughter, her ain't found.
Willyum (puffing at a new and empty
clay pipe). Zure-lie. (Jarge, a trifle
jealous of Willyum's gag, pulls out a
similar pipe, but smokes it with the
bowl upside down to show his indepen-
dence.) T' Squire's darter (Jarge
frowns), her bain't (Jarge wishes he had
thought of “bain't")—her bain't found.
(There is a dramatic pause, only
broken by the prompter.) Her ud be
little Rachel's age now, bor?
Jarge (reflectively). Ay, ay. A main
queer lass little Rachel du be. Herbain't
like one of us.
Willyum. Her do be that fond of
zoap and water. (Laughter.)
Jarge (leaving nothing to chance).
Happen she might be a real grand lady
by birth, bor.
Enter Rachel, beautifully dressed
in the sort of costume in which one
would go to a fancy-dress ball as a
village maiden.
Rachel (in the most expensive accent).
Now, uncle George (shaking a finger at
him), didn't you promise me you'd go
straight home? It would serve you
right if I never tied your tie for you
again. (She smiles brightly at him.)
Jarge (slapping his thigh in ecstasy).
Eh, lass yer du keep us old uns in
order. (He bursts into a falsetto chuckle,
loses the note, blushes and buries his
head in his mug.)
Willyum (rising). Us best be gettin'
down along, Jarge, a mºckun.
Jarge. Ay, bor, time us chaps was
moving. Don't 'e be long, lass.
[Eaxount, limping heavily.]
Rachel (sitting down on the log). Dear
old men How I love them all in this
village I have known it all my life.
How strange it is that I have never
had a father or mother. Sometimes
I seem to remember a life different to
this—a life in fine houses and spacious
parks, among beautifully dressed people
(which is surprising seeing that she
was only three weeks old at the time ;
but the audience must be given a hint
of the plot), and then it all fades away
again. (She looks firedly into space.)
Enter Hugh Fitzhugh, Squire.
Fitzhugh (standing behind Rachel,
but missing her somehow). Did ever
man come into stranger inheritance?
A wanderer in Central Australia, I
hear unexpectedly of my cousin's death
through an advertisement in an old
copy of a Sunday newspaper. I hasten
home—too late to soothe his dying
hours; too late indeed to enjoy my
good fortune for more than one short
day. To-morrow I must give up all
to the hospitals, unless by some stroke
of Fate this missing girl turns up.
(Impatiently) Pshaw She is dead.
(Suddenly he notices Rachel.) . By
heaven, a pretty girl in this out-of-the-
way villagel (He walks round her.)
Gad, she is lovely Hugh, my boy,
you are in luck. (He takes off his hat.)
Good evening, my dear!
Rachel (with a start). Good evening.
Fitzhugh (aside). She is adorable.
She can be no common village wench.
(4%) Do you live here, my girl?
Rachel. Yes, I have always lived
here. (Aside) How handsome he is.
Down, fluttering heart.
Fitzhugh (sitting on the log beside
her). And who is the lucky village lad
who is privileged to woo such beauty 2
Rachel. I have no lover, Sir.
Fitzhugh (taking her hand). Can
Hodge be so blind?
Rachel (innocently). Are you making
love to me?
Fitzhugh. Upon my word I
(He gets up from the log, which is not
really comfortable.) What is your name?
Rachel. Rachel (She rises.)
Fitzhugh. It is the most beautiful
name in the world. Rachel, will you
be my wife?
Rachel. But we have known each
other such a short time !
Fitzhugh (lying bravely). We have
known each other for ever.
Rachel. And you are a rich gentle-
man, while I
Fitzhugh. A gentleman, I hope, but
rich—no. To-morrow I shall be a
beggar. No, not a beggar if I have
your love, Rachel.
Rachel (making a lucky shot at his
name). Hugh 1 (They embrace.)
Fitzhugh. Let us plight our troth
here. See I give you my ring !
Rachel. And I give you mine.
[She takes one from the end of a chain
which is round her neck, and puts
it on his finger. Fitzhugh looks
at it and staggers back.
Fitzhugh. Heavens ! They are the
same ring ! (In great eaccitement)
Child, child who are you? How came
you by the crest of the Fitzhughs 2
Rachel. Ah, who am I? I never had
any parents. When they found me they
found that ring on me, and I have kept
it ever since
Fitzhugh. Let me look at you ! It
must be! TheSquire's missing daughter!
[Gaffers Jarge and Willyum, having
entered unobserved at the back some
time ago, have been putting in a
lot of heavy by-play until wanted.
Jarge (at last) Lor’bless’ee, Willyum,
if it bain't Squire a-kissin' our Rachell
Willyum. Zo it du be. Here du be
goings-on What will tº passon say ?
Jarge (struck with an idea). Zay, bor,
don't 'ee zee a zort o' loikeness atween
t’ maid and tº Squire 2
Willyum. Jarge, if you bain't right,
lad. Happen she do have t' same nose!
[Havring something, Fitzhugh and
Rachel turn round.
Fitzhugh. Ah, my men! I'm your
new Squire. Do you know who this is?
Willyum. Why, her du be our Rachel.
Fitzhugh. On the contrary, allow
me to introduce you to Miss Fitzhugh,
daughter of the late Squire
Jarge. Well this du be a day ! To
think of our Rachel now !
Fitzhugh. My Rachel now.
Rachel (who, it is to be hoped, has
been amusing herself somehow since her
last speech). Your Rachel always!

“Fuit autem pudor,” said CICERo,
no doubt waving his right hand in the
air and pouring himself out a glass of
water with his left, “fuit humanitas 1”
“The age of chivalry is gone,” ex-
plained BURKE to a generation which
had forgotten what CICERO meant.
But they were both wrong, for there
is always Thomas Watts.
He and I work together, but had
been for some days separated because
it had been holiday-time. That is in-
variably the occasion on which my
relations, friends, acquaintances and
dependants fall ill—some noisily, some
importantly, some heroically, some
boastfully, some priggishly, none un-
obtrusively, but all in such a manner
that I have to sympathise with them
and hear them out. To escape the
local depression I had returned to
London a little before my time, and,
when last of all Thomas arrived heavily
Scarfed and sighing deeply at short
intervals, I felt that everyone except
me was ill, and I the one poor unfor-
tunate left to do all the sympathising.
I could bear it no longer.
“For heaven's sake,” I shouted,
“don’t. I will assume that you feel
absolutely rotten, that you simply can-
not understand it, that your tempera-
ture has been everything from 98° to
110°, that it cannot be due to anything
that you have eaten, that you ache all
over. I assume everything, and let
that be the beginning and the end of
it. Now hear my tale. I have met
nothing but invalids during the last
weeks. I have listened to symptoms
for hours. I have said, ‘I am so
sorry,' and “I am so sorry,' more
often than I care to remember. If
you are a gentleman,” I concluded,
“you will not even mention your
malady, much less describe it.”
Thomas was not annoyed, not even
a little short with me. On the con-
trary, “My dear fellow,” he said with
a hurried and apologetic sneeze, “how
stupid and thoughtless I have been.
If only I had known how it would in-
convenience you, I would never have
gone and caught this chill.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TALKS WITH THE GREAT.
STUDY IN THE MANNER OF
MR. FRANK HARRIs.
HAVING met everyone, it follows of
course that I was on terms of intimacy
with BRowNING. No one, in fact, can
withhold friendship from me. There
is something about me—a je ne sais
quoi, as dear BAUDELAIRE used to put
it—which impels confidence, kills re-
serve. I slip my arm through theirs,
hold it in the vice of friendship, and they
give way. As BRowNING used to say,
“My dear Frank, you're wonderful.
The Old Man of the Sea isn't in it
with you.” Poor BRowNING ! How ex-
traordinarily ordinary his conversation
could be Few things have perplexed
me so much as that. We would walk
along the Paddington Canal morning
after morning from Warwick Gardens,
and all the talking would be left for
me. Once I remember I was develop-
ing some daring fantastic theory with
more than usual brilliancy, when I
found that the poet, had disappeared.
In my excitement I had let go his arm
and he had lost his way, or something.
IBut that was a slip; it never occurred
again.
How different was NEwMAN | In
the safe silent security of Edgbaston,
he was always sweet, always patient.
Hour after hour have I spent with this
great if utterly misguided man—l
almost wrote gentleman—pouring out
floods of what must have seemed to
him terrible heterodoxy if not positive
free-thought. But he never stopped
me. I did my best to get him to stay
at Monte Carlo with me, but in vain.
It was, I think, my only rebuff.
TENNYsoN I saw rarely in London,
but both at Aldworth and Farringdon
in the Isle of Wight he and I were
inseparable; but I preferrel BrowNING.
There was something a little vulgar, a
little provincial, and also something
far too smug for my palate about
TENNYSON. He looked as if he might
read the lessons in church, as I said to
him one day. He took it very well
“Do I ?” he said. “Well, Frank, you
don't l” “No,” said I; “and what's
more, ALFRED, by ! I don't
want to."
In the afternoon he gave his guests
one of his tiresome readings of Maud
and I made a number of criticisms.
but his was too parochial a mind to
appreciate them. None the less I am
not sorry to have talked with him.
He meant well in the main.
Hux.EY was made of sterner stuff.
He met every argument with another
and, as I once said to him, if his pisto
missed fire he knocked one down witl.
the butt end of it. “Wery good, Frank,”
he replied, “that's one of the best
things I ever heard. Where did you
get your wit?” But who can answer
questions like that ? Just as I had
helped NEwMAN with some of his real
sermons, so did I help Huxley with a
lay sermon now and then. But it was
useless to try to get style into the man.
His knowledge, however, was encyclo-
paedic and his observation very keen.
I remember one instance of both. I
had gone to see him one cold day in
winter and I was wearing a fur coat.
As it happened, it was a new one.
“My dear Frank,” he said, “you've got
a new coat. It's rabbit this time. Your
old one was retriever.” The amazing
part of this is that he was right.
But I consider CARLYLE my trump
card. CARLYLE I used to see con-
tinually, as all readers of The English
Review know by now, in 1878 and
1879. The first time (or was it the
last 2) I met him was on the
Embankment. It was the saddest
face I ever saw. Why did he look
so wretched ? What could be the
meaning of it? Could it be that
he knew who I was 2 He did not
speak, and I turned and walked
beside him with my best half-Nelson
just above his elbow. He still said
nothing. After waiting for a little I
determined to make him speak, so I
said, “CAGLIosTRo says somewhere
that man is, after all, man. PARACELSU's
differentiates between man and woman,
but BoEHME, in that wonderful vision
in the Sixth book (you remember),
would have us believe that man and
woman, or woman and man, each is
distinct—in other words, male and
female. To quote the sublime WILLON :
‘Sait vostre mºre que vous estes sortiº"
What do you think, master?”
He stood still. “IEh, mon,” he said
at last, “ye're a marvel. And only
twa-and-twinty. It's braw leukin’ at
ye: such as ye ought not tae be sub-
jected tae the risks of daily life. It's
cotton-wool I'd be presairvin' ye in.
But don't quote VILLON to me. WILLON
was a guttersnipe.” By this time I
had seen all his limitations, and my
heart was filled with pity for the mis-
taken old man. WILLON a guttersnipe'
There you have CARLYLE in both his
greatness and his littleness—greatness
in being so positive, littleness in being
so wrong. I proceeded to put him
right.
It is strange, but I had been very
nervous with CARLYLE at first. When
he had said foolish things I merely
neld my tongue, but now that I had
grown to know him better I became
impatient and threw restraint to the
winds. That is my way. Each two
minutes of a solitary talk with anyone
I look upon as a separate conversation,
divided from the next two minutes by
days, weeks or months. In this way
intimacy ripens fast. What else CAR-
LYLE said I shall not write here, not
even the story of his married life,
which he told me without reserve
while the tears poured down his face.
Everything he laid bare to me, and
some day I shall lay it still barer.
One odd thing in our first talk I may
however mention in this place, and
that is that neither he nor I knew

“SATISFACTORY NOBLEMEN ''
WE have read with mingled emotions
the following interesting statement in
that sturdy Radical organ, The Man-
chester Guardian :-
“A figure that can ill be spared from
the pageantry of the Coronation is
Lord Howard de Walden. Of all the
lords of long pedigree he is the most
picturesque, both physically and in the
manner of his life. His tall, athletic
figure, the delicately strong lines of his
face, the slight aristocratic curve of the
nose, and the rather lazy droop of
the eyelids would have given Disraeli
vast pleasure to describe. And if his
presence in a drawing-room of the great
world, his Chesterfieldian politeness to
the arts, his brilliant effect, have not
actually been described by Mr. Henry
James in The Velvet Glove, then the
world has been more than usually out
in its guesses. He is probably as
satisfactory a nobleman as we could
produce for our guests of the great year
to look at.”
It is a great comfort to think that the
g up left by the absence of this
picturesque figure will be more than
made up by some of the new peers
who will shortly be created to redress
the inequality of parties in the House
of Lords.
Amongst these a foremost place is
lue to Sir Ahasuerus Goldberg, who,
it is understood, will on his elevation
assume the title of Baron Boodle of
Bonanza. Though his stature does
not exceed middle height, his glossy
ringlets and the opulent contour of his
figure, the sheer slope of his shoul-
ders and the noble curve of his nose
are enough to tempt Mr. Sargent back
nto the arena of portraiture. Sir
Ahasuerus is a many-sided magnate, dis-
tinguished alike in the fields of finance,
act, and rubber planting. A man of
simple tastes, he lives almost entirely
on Devonshire cream, pſité de foie gras,
ortolans and caviare. He has three

sons at Eton and his only daughter
was married last year to the Master of
Musselburgh. A vivid if somewhat
malicious portrait of this great citizen
is to be found in the sparkling pages
of Mr. ANTHONY HoPE's romance, The
Proclivities of Satan.
Equally attractive in physique and
even more distinguished intellectually
is the Right Hon. Jonah Gladstone
Bagstock, late Radical Member for
Chowbent. Mr. Bagstock, whose in-
come runs to six figures, has probably
the most luxuriant whiskers in all
Lancashire, and his genial wit makes
him the idol of his cronies in the smoke-
room of the National Liberal Club.
He has the finest collection of Sigis-
mund Goetzes in the world, and is an
expert performer on the pianola. Mr.
Bagstock will almost certainly take the
title of Baron Bagstock of Chowbent.
It should be added that Sir W. RoBERT-
SON NIcoll, has hit off some of Mr.
Bagstock's most salient traits in his
poignant romance, Catechismal Clement.
Another magnificent specimen of the
chivalric Anglo-Semitic type is Sir
Aubrey Sonnenschein. Of ample pro-
portions, with beautifully modelled pre-
hensile hands and a superb pigeon-
toed walk which is the delight of Pall
Mall, Sir Aubrey's resonant voice and
rich guttural enunciation invariably
secure for him an attentive hearing
even in the most plutocratic salons
of Mayfair. A staunch and unflinching
Radical, he has only yielded reluctantly
to the call of duty in consenting to
accept a peerage. His passionate
interest in life and letters is sufficiently
illustrated by the fact of his being the
proprietor of the Post-Humanitarian
Review, in which the doctrines of the
New Epicureanism are propounded
with a fearless realism seldom at-
tempted on this side of the Channel.
Sir Aubrey has a place in Cornwall
near Marazion, a stately mansion in
Surrey, and a charming rococo villa
near Joppa, N.B., where he goes for
golf. In a few months we shall wel-
come him under his new title of Lord
Mount-Carmel of Joppa. Lady
Sonnenschein, who was formerly Miss
Bathsheba Sloman, is a superbly hand-
some woman, of whom a brilliant
sketch will be found in Sir ARTHUR
LE QUEUx's famous novel The Climbers.
Lastly we have to mention Mr.
Leonard Nuneham, the best dressed
and best groomed member of the
present House of Commons. The
disparity between principle and prac-
tice which is illustrated by his life
lends a peculiar fascination to this
admirable politician. On the platform
he is practically a Socialist, yet at
home he lives a life of semi-sultanic
and , almost Sardanapalian luxury.
His baths are of solid gold, he has 10
butlers, 24 footmen and 72 best bed-
rooms, and his housekeeper always
wears a diamond tiara night and day.
He has gone far already, but he will go
further as Lord Downy of Rufus-stone.
A spirited if somewhat partial picture
of him will be found in Mr. HALL
CAINE's clever novel, Sir Humphry
Calmady.
“Hampstead Heath. — Board-residence or
apartments in English lady's home.”
Advt. in “Daiſy Mail.”
“England I with all thy faults I love
thee still, my country ! and, while yet
a nook is left where English minds and
manners may be found, shall be con-
strain'd to love thee.”—The Task.

MINISTERIAL ANGELS.
THE heroism of Mr. HERBERT LEwis,
M.P., Parliamentary Secretary to the
Local Government Board, who recently
lunched at the Cardiff Workhouse, has
excited great interest in humanitarian
circles, and a movement is on foot to
recommend him for the Carnegie
Decoration. Mr. HERBERT LEwis, it
will be remembered, only had half-
rations of soup at the workhouse, and
less than an hour afterwards went into
a well-known Cardiff restaurant “to
get some prunes and a cup of tea "
(Daily Chronicle).
This fine example, we are glad to
learn, has soon found a distinguished
imitator.
Mr. LEwis HARcourt, M.P., the
Secretary of State for the Colonies,
not to be outdone by a subordinate
colleague, paid a visit on Saturday to
the Hammersmith Workhouse and,
greatly daring, dined with theastonished
inmates.
During the afternoon he was seen
by a Press representative, when he con-
firmed the report, which had already
been cabled to the Springfield Repub-
lican, that he had dined at the expense
of the ratepayers. “Why, of course,”
he replied with a winning laugh,
“holding the views I do on the strenuous
and ascetic life, which alone is the
guarantee of a good conscience, what
else could I do? Besides, there is
nothing new about it. My home is
a temple of toil, and I always lunch in
a work-house.”
“Were you introduced to the in-
mates ?” he was asked, and answered,
“Oh, no, they naturally thought I was
one of themselves, and I had not the
heart to undeceive them.”
“Your lunch, I hope, was en-
joyable?”
“Very substantial and very enjoy-
able,” replied the eminent statesman.
“Then how comes it,” asked the
inquisitive Pressman, “that you were
seen entering the Fitz Restaurant in
less than an hour's time?”
Mr. HARcourt laughed a rich melo-
dious laugh and explained. “You see,”
he said, “they only gave me half rations
of pea - soup at the workhouse; and,
joking apart, I simply went into the
restaurant to get a peacock's brain
sandwich and a thimbleful of Imperial
Tokay.”
Mr. Punch has been requested to
state that “The Oncomers' Society,”
of whose inaugural performance he
recently gave a short notice, is not to
be confused with the “Oncomers'
Association,” which started earlier. He
declines however to say which of the
two it was that invited him to make
this statement.

Extracted Fito M THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Feb.
13.−Looking round crowded Chamber
ºn busiest moments of debate on Ad-
dress, one is struck by comparative
absence of change in personality of
Members. There has been the, of late,
customary annual General Election,
bringing reverses here and there. But,
as the French say, the more things
change the more they remain as they
were. Easy to fancy this a sitting of
House of last year with a few score
Members still making holiday or tem-
porarily absent in search of dinner.
Treasury Bench perhaps most con-
spicuously suffered sea change. Robson
and SAM Evans, respectively Attorney-
General and Solicitor-General in the
last Parliament, come back no more.
This not consequent on defeat at the
poll; due to well-deserved promotion.
Lovely and pleasant in their Parli-
amentary lives, in political death they
are divided only by the walls of
divers Courts of Justice. Proof of
a undance of talent at disposal of
happy PREMIER is evident in the fact
that to fill the vacant places he had at
hand RUFUs Isa Acs and SIMON. Never-
taeless House thinks kindly of those
gone before—old Members who, by
sheer ability, won their way to the
highest posts in their profession.

whelming in Opposition camp that it
can afford to put any of its lights
under a bushel. SARK is reminded
that not all cases of extinction are
voluntary, like BoNAR LAw's. There
was JoHN O' GoRST at the disposal
of the MARKiss when, twenty-five
years ago, he unexpectedly strode into
power over wreck of Liberal Party
s' attered on rock of Home Rule.
The MARKiss made him Under Secre-
tury for India, with humour character-
1stically sardonic placing over him
as head of department GRAND CRoss.
Later Gorst was made Vice-President
of Committee of Council on E lucation,
and was finally got rid of by the subtle
device of abolishing the office.
As PRINCE ARTHUR observed, with
that deadly logic to which upon
occasion a supremely innocent look
lends force, “Since there is no longer
a Vice-Presidency of Committee of
Council on Education, how can GoRST
hold it 2 ”
So one of the most effective debaters
of his time on the Treasury Bench
drifted to a back bench, finally into
private life.

prise. In his last race he, so to

With respect to the last, the
to keep close company with him
on back bench above Gangway is
modified by reflection upon removal of
a contingency which, though purely
fanciful, was not the less productive of
apprehension. Often hear of danger
arising in places of crowded public
resort through feminine fashion of
mysteriously fastening on hats with
prodigiously long pin. This nothing
to HERMoN Hodge's moustache,
especially at sittings when it had in
the morning been freshly trimmed and
waxed. At the turning of his head
you would see Members seated to right
or left of him, according as his glance
wandered, hurriedly withdraw their
cheek.
HENNIKER HEATON carries into
retirement the comfortable reflection of
having effected many useful reforms in
the postal service. CHARLEs McLAREN,
withdrawing a pleasant presence from
long-familiar scene, leaves behind
hostages to fortune in the persons of a
brother and two sons. This redund-
ancy of M.P.s. in a family circle runs
Hatfield House establishment
pretty close.
Of graver concern is the event that
emptied the corner seat below Gangway
on Ministerial side. There, when he
entered the House forty-three years
ago, sat CHARLES DILKE. Thence he
rose to make historic attack on the
Sovereign's Civil List. After brief but
brilliant career on Treasury Bench that
seemed to promise in due, perhaps not
distant, time reversion of the highest
office in the service of the Crown, he
disappeared in the darkness and
desolation of suddenly falling night.
When he came back he claimed his
old corner seat, whether to the right or
left of the SPEAKER according to the
vicissitudes of Party triumph. Slowly
but surely, with dogged courage and
impregnable patience, he succeeded
once more in working his way to
prominent position. His death, taking
place on the very eve of the meeting of
the new Parliament, drew from all
quarters personal tributes, through
which ran the murmur of inconsolable
regret. -
TEIE TOO-EARLY BIRDS.
THE latest, but by no means the
last, beauty-cure is sufficiently heroic.
Ladies who are in trouble about their
looks are recommended to go for a long
walk an hour before day-break. It is
not apparently stated whether the fair
devotees are expected to sit up all
night, so as not to miss the society of
the milkman and the early worm, but
this seems not an unlikely outcome
of the present roosting-hours. We
foresee wigs in the Green Park. Those
who out-Willett the order of Nature
are bound to pay for it in the long run.
They will either be breakfasting or
supping at four a.m. The idea must
be firmly and thoroughly squelched.
We cannot have Society disorganised
because, in the sacred cause of her com-
plexion, my lady is impelled to go cub-
hunting with the Battersea Beagles or is
out with the Hyde-Park Otter Hounds
by the light of the morning star. It
would mean that we others, who have no
particular looks to bother about, would
have to get up too. We should all
be cross after eleven, and the Divorce
Court is hard enough worked as it is.
Besides, the retainers of Harriet
would never stand these early-rising
plaguy ways, and there would be a
general lock-out of mistresses.

I FANcy they must have fed him on
oats this morning, for he is louder and
more self-assertive than usual. There
are some people who take a foolish
pride in manifestations of municipal
progress, but they have probably never
been bullied for three whole days by a
Borough Council steam-roller. It is
not so much the grinding and puffing
that I object to, as the vanity of the
creature; he carries as much lift as
the peacock, which he faintly resembles
in colour, though his figure, of course, is
not so svelte. Personally, I do not
believe that the road needs repairing
at all, certainly not the part just in
front of my windows. But knowing
that I should be in all the morning
the detestable brute has chosen this
patch of ground for his insolent parade.
For a long time I refused to get up
and look at him, but at last I yielded,
and (would you believe it?) he positively
simpered with pride, spread out his
back wheels to their fullest extent, and
minced (there is no other word for it)
down the road.
I have drawn up a small bill which
I intend to submit to the Borough
Council who own him. It runs as
follows:—
The Borough Council.

ing to your steam-roller. 2 gns.

I rather doubt if I shall be paid, but,
'even so, I shall not be satisfied. What
I should really like to do would be to
spread the Borough Council very neatly
(in their top hats and frock coats) on
the ground in front of my windows and
lay two cart-loads of flints on the top
of them. Then the steam-roller could
get to work again. The sound would
be considerably deadened, and there is
nothing that binds a road so well or
makes such an excellent and lasting
surface as a really plump Borough
Councillor.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE WITNESS For THE DEFENCE."
Henry Thresk was one of those rare
trotters who can spend six weeks in
India without proposing to write a
book about it. He had, in fact, no
connection with the Labour Party.
Hearing that an old love of his was
leading a dog's life with her brute of a
husband—an official somewhere in
Rajputana—he breaks his journey and
runs over on a camel to see if the
reports are correct. A rapid meal and
a few brief passages of postprandial
dialogue suffice to prove the worst.
His last sight of her, before he responds
to the whistle of the train and the call
of the camel, is in the act of toying
suspiciously with a rook-rifle.
Arrived at Bombay, he learns that
the husband was found dead in his
tent that same night, and that the wiſe
is charged with his murder. He
volunteers evidence in her defence, and
by adroit perjury helps to get her off.
Two years later he finds her in
Sussex, about to be married to :
nice clean young fellow, whose rela-
tives (including a solicitor), being
sceptical about her innocence, have
invited him down there on a plausible
excuse, with the purpose of pumping
him about the evidence he gave at the
trial. Under a stiff cross-examination
he repeats and embroiders his former
perjury; but, on hearing her own
confession of an act that was on the
borderland between murder and just -
fiable homicide, he insists that she
must share her secret with her future
husband before it is too late for him
to scratch his engagement. In point
of fact it is already too late, for they
were privily married a week ago; but
he takes the news very nicely.
Well, what I want to know is this :
(1) If Thresk volunteered to perjure
himself for the lady so as to save her
neck and give her a chance of getting
what happiness was still to be had out
of life, why should he worry as to how
or where she gets her happiness—
whether through marriage or other-
wise? Having saved her from one
possible death, why should he insist
on her risking a second, for she
threatens to take her own life if her
lover kicks at her revelation ? And
why, in Heaven's name, should Thresk
make it his officious concern to see
that this man, a perfect stranger to
him, should not marry with his eyes
shut 2
Solutions to these riddles will be
very acceptable, and if Mr. MAsoN will
adjudicate I shall be much obliged to
him. He might at the same time tell
|
me (2) what sort of etiquette it is that
permits a solicitor to cross-examine a
witness on the evidence which he gave
for the defence in a murder trial after
an interval of two years. It was
immensely to the credit both of
Mr. SYDNEY WALENTINE and Mr. GEORGE
ALEXANDER (as well as to the author
for his handling of the argument) that
this unbelievable investigation was
carried out with such an air of prob-
ability.
Certain details of the play recall the
fact that Mr. MAsoN last year made an
excursus into the realm of detective
fiction. I read his Villa Rose with
wonder and sadness: wonder that he
should have caught the trick of it so
cleverly, sadness that he should have
thought it necessary to drop his own
Stel, a Bul'antymº (Miss ETHEI, IRVING).
Then I shall kill myself with an overdose ol
sleeping draught.
Henry Thresk (MR. GEORGE ALEXANDEl:).
Well, take pains about it. Last time you
attempted suicide you missed yourself!
charming literary style in favour of the
dull and banal manner traditional v
affected by the hack-writers of this
school. In The Witness for the Defence
he scems still to be labouring under the
regulation, proper enough to detective
stories, that secrets must be hidden
from the public as long as possible.
Thus in the First Act the curtain falls
prematurely on Stella Ball intyne point-
ing her rifle at her oncoming husband;
and so far from being shown whether
she kills him by intent or oversight,
or reverts to her original arrangement
and shoots herself, we are not even
allowed for the time being to know
whether she so much as discharges the
weapon at all.
Again we are left in the dark as to
her previous relations with Thresk.
Just a hint or so, and misleading at
that, is permitted; and it is not till the
Third Act that we learn that she was
in love with him once, but has long
ago grown out of it. Sticklers for
tradiion may resent these shock-
tactics, and insist that the audience
should be taken at once into the
author's confidence. Personally I have
no feeling in the matter, except that
I am always rather glad if a dramatist
can see his way to scandalise the old
stagers.
The honours went to Miss ETHEL
IRVING for a really remarkable per-
formance, to which her nervousness
on the first night lent an added touch
of emotional realism. Her self-revela-
tion in the Third Act was a triumph
of spontaneous sincerity. In a less
picturesque part Mr. SYDNEY WALEN-
TINE was the very mirror of nature.
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER's mood was
one of modest restraint. His rôle
lacked the usual prominence, and at
times he even seemed to be employing
a scheme of protective colouring by
which to merge himself in his back-
ground. I cannot say whether he got
shaken up by his experience with the
camel, but I have seldom seen so much
subordination of self in an actor-
manager. Mr. ALFRED Bishop was
not perhaps allowed so much chance
for his particular gift of humour as he
could have found use for. Mr. LYstox
|LYLE as the bully, Stephen Ballantyne,
came very near to the achievements of
Mr. NorMAN McKINNEL, specialist in
this kind. The rest of the cast were
uniformly good.
I am told that Mr. MAsoN's latest
play is likely to get at the British
bosom; and this is good hearing, by
whatever unfathomable judgment it is
decreed that he should prevail at last
after comparative failure with plays
whose merits, if not so immediately
urresting, were just as sound. For
myself I could have wished that he
had allowed us a little longer time in
India, for he has a nice taste in exotic
colouring, and there was an intriguing
quality in the scene and circumstance
of the First Act that was never quite
ecovered in the more familiar atmos-
phere of the Sussex Downs.

and just as the rest of us were turning
our thoughts towards lunch he took off
his bat and gloves and sat down at
his desk. He surveyed the books and
papers with disgust, picked up a pen
and nibbled it, and then unhung from
the wall a calendar which proclaimed
January 9, 1911, and that kind hearts
are more than coronets.
“What's to-day ?” he asked, idly
fingering the calendar.
“Tuesday—nearly Wednesday." I
replied. Wortlebury turned it over in
his mind. “I mean the date,” he said,
almost crossly. Somebody handed him
a piece of paper and a pencil, and
remarking that yesterday was the 6th
suggested that he might work out the
problem; it would give him something
to do to keep him quiet. Wortlebury
tore off a bunch of leaves from the
calendar until he arrived at February 7.
Then he started ; it seemed to me that
he even blenched.
“Great Heavens !” he exclaimed,
and plunging his pen deep into the ink
he bent his broad shoulders to the task
of writing on one of the papers on his sort of thing, and, do you know, it
desk
"Behold ! Wortlebury has begun
the year's toil,” said Pillington.
Wortlebury worked on as one pos-
sessed. Now and again he glanced
timidly at the calendar, only to renew
his labours with increased vigour. He
waved aside suggestions for lunch. He
was not yet ready, he said. He would
be taking only twenty minutes. Some
people, he added, appeared to be ob-
livious of the passing of time. Were
we conscious of the fact that 37 days
of the year had already passed ? The
precious moments were flying. He
assured us that we did not live in this
world for ever Between ourselves, be
informed us, the announcement on the
calendar had shocked him and made
him ashamed. He intended to take
only fifteen minutes for his lunch—
twenty at the outside.
When we returned, Wortlebury was
out. He lounged in at twenty past
three, and stood in front of the fire
telling us a story he had just heard in
Bond Street,
“Yes, but what about the precious
moments?” I asked.
“Well,” replied Wortlebury, “every
cloud has a silver lining and all that
| quite escaped my notice until you'd
gone that the calendar also says ‘327
days to come.' So ” He yawned
twice, and began to turn the pages of
a magazine, humming the while an
air from The Chocolate Soldier.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
If it should come to pass, after all, that the war is
averted and we are able to regard the German once mole
as a man and a brother, then I hope somebody will have
the gratitude to start a public testimonial to Mrs. ALFRED
SIDGwick, in recognition of her contributions to this most
desirable end. I know of hardly any other author who can
write about Germany and its people with so pleasant and
engaging a touch. What has provoked this reflection is a
volume of reprinted stories and sketches, with the candid
and appropriate title of Odd Come Shorts (MILLs AND
Boon), because in it cecurs a trifling but delightful dialogue
—one of a number grouped together as “The Opinions
of Angela.”—which, properly read, ought in itself to bring
about an international understanding. All “The Opinions
of Angela,” indeed, are wholly entertaining; though I
think Mrs. SIDGw ICK was in some uncertainty whether to
make her heroine an absolute fool, or not. The Angela
who recounts her experiences at a bargain sale seems a very
different person from
Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but in any case her subsequent
punishment is quite sufficient to satisfy the moralist. The
chief faults that I have to find with A Large Room are
that it is so difficult to get into (Mrs. DUDENEY's style
being best described as a series of spasms), and that, when
you do get there, there is not a single nice person barring
Amaza inside it.
In My Life's Pilgrimage (John MURRAY) Mr. CATLING
modestly tells a story of strenuous effort successful against
disadvantages that by less courageous spirits would have
been regarded as insuperable. Without patronage, social
standing or generous education, he rose from the printing
office to the Editor's Chair. Though his paper was
a weekly one, hampered by conditions that limit sale
on Sundays, he lived to see it reach a circulation ex-
ceeding a million. Full of ideas and energy, dowered by
sympathetic proprietors with a fat purse, he sought for
contributors of special articles amongst a class not at that
time accustomed to be approached by editors. Among
others he caught Mr. GLADstoNE with a lordly bribe of £100,
the fee of an article
the Angela who
speaks so sanely
about a holiday hurt
for “t he real
Germany." Still,
this may really be
only another proof
of the author's in-
sight into feminine
character. Wise or
foolish, however,

| account for their delinquencies (and they have been so
very incautious, some of them) a favourite excuse will be,
I should think, to throw the blame on their sponsors, and
ask, Well, what could you expect of anyone with a name
like this? Amaza Meeks is the label which Mrs. HENRY
DUDENEY has attached to the principal figure in A Large
Room (HEINEMANN), and even without red hair and the most
remarkable combination of mental agility and practical
innocence to which I have ever been introduced a girl so
styled would have been hounded on to eccentricity. An
orphan, and deserted for the time by an unsympathetic
stepmother and sisters, Amaza, who had never even been
to a theatre or restaurant in her life, fell in with Sir Walter
Wintle (you won't believe it, but she was bending down
to look at the stars in street puddles at the time), and the
lively hatred with which the authoress has succeeded in
inspiring me for this well-preserved roué is some testimony
to the merits of her story. Indeed you can't help liking
Amaza and sympathising profoundly with her, even though
she didn't say a word to the man whom she married after-
wards about this part of her life. Perhaps she had read
reminiscences he could present to an eager public if he
had prepared and preserved notes I Perhaps he has.
I beg Miss Rosa MoRD NAPIER not to interrupt her next
story by outbursts of quotation from various poets, and
also suggest to her that if nicknames are ever amusing
their constant repetition is more than likely to become a
weariness. The Serocolds were not silly people, but I
cannot imagine anything more provoking than the way in
which they addressed each other. So far, so captious;
for the rest I offer the warmest congratulations to the
author of The Faithful Failure (Duckworth). In the
competition between Christopher Serocold and Maa Chinoch
for the love of Yoë Hope there is no melodramatic contrast,
but a struggle between two good fellows, one of whom
adored WAGNER and had more brains than health, while
the other sang “Boney was a Warrior” at the top of his
voice and had more health than brains. In this book
Miss NAPIER shows a real appreciation of the influence of
Nature upon character, and I feel that she has a most
distinct and curious talent which at present is partially
past master of his .

BIRD, of whom last week I stated
Death had got you on the hip,
Let me own I antedated
His inexorable grip ;
It appears that you contracted just a temporary pip.
Growing daily wan and wanner
With a dull insidious pain—
Once regarded as a goner
You are now yourself again,
Nay, if possible, a little more intelligibly sane.
Like that storied fowl, the Phoenix,
You arise superb and whole,
Stamp my fingers with your free nicks
When I pet you on the poll,
Walk your perch again serenely with the old familiar roll.
Did I say your voice had faltered,
Stricken by the moulting mange?
Wrong | It has but slightly altered,
Suffered but a small key-change
Into something not less strident, something quite as rich

With your clear prophetic vision
How our food will cost us more,

A PAPER ON THE Works of Mits. AMANDA. M. Ros.
With apºlogies to the Comuluctors of “At the Sºgn of the Jºlough" in
“The Cornhull ſauſa-ºne.")
1. (a) Describe the ornament belonging to Lady Mattie
Maynard found by Lord Gilford. Answer: “Composed
of every colour . . . and terminating in a cat's face studded
with diamonds.”
(b) State, in his own words, how he discovered the
precise purpose of this ornament. Answer: “As I coiled
it, I could not fail seeing the word “garter' worked in
emeralds about its centre."
2. How may we infer from a casual remark of Lord
Gifford's that he had his doubts as to his cousin's claim to
be addressed as “Lady" Mattie 2 Answer: “Lady Mattie
(Heaven knows who died, or if anyone died and legacied her
the title).”
3. What clue is furnished by the author to the identity
of the well-known Dublin Hotel in which Delina Delaney
was ushered, with Lord Gifford, by “dim-wigged footmen,
bowing before him,” into “the elegance of a large drawing-
room, more in keeping with the strides of royalty than
the requirements of an humble maiden,” where “a
low fire burned beyond a rug of horny beauty"?
Answer: “That famous hotel whose Shell burns with a
raging heat.”
4. Who “instantly picked up the deeply flavoured
cigar" which Lord Gifford “cast from him, when nearing
an inch or so of its death,” in “Antrim’s busy capital” 7
Answer: “A stout-lunged newsboy or beggar editor of a
penny birdie weekly.”
5. How did Lord Gifford “dress himself fully in
London's proud fashion ?” Answer: By “basking his
slender extremities in velvet slippers with heels of stiff
crimson morocco.” º
6. Give some description of the sunset witnessed by Lord
Gifford while “he sipped unaccompanied by the merest
edible.” Answer: “Golden plumes and arms of cloud, that
shone like stacks of fire upon the western rim of the
horizon, grew grey and died in a death-pail.”
7. In what words did he recognise the body of “Miss
Fontaine” as that of his cousin 2 Answer: “O God, it is
true ! This is my cousin, Lady Mattie Maynard | She had
six toes on her right foot | "
8. How did Sir John Dunfern behave on discovering
that his wife Irene (née Iddesleigh) had, after-eloping to
America with her “noble and well-learned tutor,” Oscar
Otwell, gone through a form-of-marriage with him in that
country 2 Answer: “He at once sent for his solicitors,
Messrs. Hutchinson and Harper, and ordering his will to
be produced, demanded there and then that the pen of
persuasion be dipped into the ink of revenge and spread
thickly along the paragraph of blood-related charity to
blank the intolerable words that referred to the woman he
was now convinced, beyond doubt, had braved the bridge
of bigamy.” - -
9. Did Oscar Otwell's advertisement in the leading
journals for a situation meet with any response 2 Answer:
No. “It was treated with muſiled silence, so much so
that after a month's daily appealing to a praiseworthy
public, the result proved a decided failure.”
10. In what manner did Irene betray her emotion after
reading the letter Oscar wrote to her before committing
suicide 2 Answer: “ Folding the letter, and handing it to
the officers . . . Mrs. Otwell quietly moved again to the
breakfast-room, and, strange to say, finished her meal in
silence.”
11. “The wings of love and lasting strength Shall flap
above his hollow bed.” On whose tomb were these lines
“carefully cut in gilded letters"? Answer: “On Sir John
Dunfern's.”
12. In what terms did Sir John Dunfern's son and heir,
Sir Hugh, rebuke his erring mother? Answer: “Woman
of sin and stray companion of tutorism.”
In the opinion of Mr. Punch the best sets of answers
were received from Mrs. Harris, c/o Mrs. S. Gamp,
IKingsgate Street, High Holborn, and — 13rooks, Esq. (of
Shelheld). A cheque for one thousand guineas has been
sent to each of these competitors. F. A.
“Upon the point of elasticity, the explanations forthcoming were

THE STAFF OF LIFE.
MRs. JEREMy's face grew more and
more startled as she read the indict-
ment to herself at breakfast. She
cast a glance of loathing at the innocent
piece of bread in front of her, shuddered
and pushed the plate away.
“Dear,” she said earnestly, looking
up from her paper, “we must get
some Standard Bread in at once.”
“Bread,” said Jeremy, looking up
from his. “Certainly, dear.” He
pulled the board towards him and cut
a large slice. “Your bread,” he
remarked, and held it out to her.
She looked up again in surprise and,
seeing the bread, shrieked.
“I didn't ask for it, Jeremy. In
fact I simply daren't touch it now.
Doesn't it say anything about it in
gour paper?”
“What's the matter with it 2" said
Jeremy, taking an immense bite. “It's
ordinary bread.”
“It 's Poison.”
“Then I think you might have said
so before. I've been eating it steadily
for half-an-hour.” He got up with
dignity and stood in front of the fire.
“At least you could have saved me
that last bite. Doctors will tell you
that it is always the last bite which is
fatal. We'd better have Baby down.
She might like to say good-bye to me.”
“Don’t be absurd. It can't really
be as bad as that. Only haven't you
noticed anything about the bread 2 I
can't bear it. It suddenly seems horrid
to me." -
“What is there to notice in bread 2
I always notice if I haven't got any,
and sometimes I notice if you haven't
got any, but x -
“Well, there's too much starch in it,
the paper says.”
“That accounts for it,” said Jeremy,
feeling a piece. “I thought it was
simply stale. Well, tell them not to
put so much in next week.”
“There isn't going to be a next
week. We're going to start Standard
I}read to-day. You're going out on
your bicycle to buy some. You'll have
to go to Hillborough —they'll never
have it in the village.”
Jeremy prowled round the room in
search of his tobacco, found it, filled
his pipe, and returned to the hearth-
rug.
* What is standard Bread?" he
asked between puffs.
“You won't ask when you've once
eaten it. It does you twice as much
good as this stuff. I'm longing to try
it.”
“But how is it different from this . .
stuff 2"
“It contains,” said his wife, who
knew it by heart now, “at least eighty
per cent. of the whole wheat, including
the germ and the semolina.”
“Including what " " said Jeremy
sharply.
“The germ and the semolina.”
“Oh ' " He paused for a moment.
“I’m not at all sure that I like germs,”
he announced.
“These aren't those germs, dear,”
said Mrs. Jeremy soothingly. “These
won't hurt you at all.”
“I don't see how you know that.
Besides, it's very easy to make a
mistake with germs. They're tricky
little things, 1 can tell you. The
baker may think he's putting in quite
a harmless one, a slight cold or some-
thing of that sort, and then, just while
he's turning round for the semolina,
in hops a diphtheria germ looking as
innocent as you please. And, anyhow,
that reminds me—I loathe semolina.
We've been married two years, and
you ought to know that I always
refuse semolina.”
Mrs. Jeremy walked over and patted
his head gently.
“We'll just try a loaf, and if you
don't like it * *
“If I don't like it I shall live en-
tirely on nuts. You've unnerved me.
I've been eating bread—except for a
few months at the start—for nearly
thirty years, and now you tell me
suddenly that it's poison ; and that
unless I include eighty germs and the
whole of the semolina ->
“There, there, get on your bicycle like
a good boy and go into Hillborough.
I know Cobb won't have it here.”
Jeremy grumbled, jumped on to his
bicycle and rode off. Having arrived
at the baker's he walked firmly in and
gave his order.
“I want,” he said, “a loaf of Standard
|Bread.”
“Standard bread, Sir 2"
“Yes. There's a lot about it in one
of the papers. The Standard, I suppose.
It's a new loaf that they've invented.”
“We never see the papers, 'cept a
Sunday.”
“To-day's Wednesday—that's awk-
ward. We can't wait. But, after all,
you're a baker; you oughtn't to want
to look up things about bread in papers.
It 's different for me.”
“What's it like 2''
“I've never seen any. As far as I
am informed it's just like ordinary
bread, only it has to contain eighty per
cent. of something which I have just
forgotten.” He put his hand to his
head and thought. “Wait—wait—it's
coming back. Microbe and tapioca
. microbe and tapioca. . . . mi
“Whatever -
“No, it isn't actually that, but that's
what I remember it by. Ah, now I've
got it !” He cleared his throat im-
pressively. “It's got to include the
germ and the semolina. And the sem-
olina, mind. Now does that convey
anything to you?”
The man scratched his head thought-
fully.
“Maybe I'm wrong about the
paper that invented it,” said Jeremy.
“Now I think of it we don't take in
The Standard. My wife takes in
somebody's Home Dressmaker, but it
wouldn't be that. And The Times still
only sells books. How about Black
and White bread 2 ”
The man scratched his head again,
pulled down a dark loaf and suggested
it hopefully.
“Well,” said Jeremy, “ some people
might call it merely brown, but I
suppose it's near enough. Thank you.
I'll take it with me. I've got a
bicycle outside.”
Mrs. Jeremy received him joyfully,
but her face fell when she saw the
loaf.
“Why, that's brown bread,” she
cried.
“Only where it fell off the bicycle,”
said Jeremy.
“And inside too,” said Mrs. Jeremy,
cutting it open. “Ordinary brown
bread.”
“That's the germ,” said Jeremy.
“They're all brown this year. Gre-
garious little beggars—just like sheep
the way they follow each other.
Simply no individuality.”
“I wonder if brown bread is all
right.” She broke a piece off and
nibbled at it. “It is ordinary brown
bread.”
“Is that poison too?”
“I—I don't know.”
“Then let 's ask cook—she knows
everything . . . Oh, cook,” Jeremy
went on bravely, “about this new
bread we're all talking of now • *
“I was just going to ask you, mum,”
said cook, wiping her hands on her
apron. “Did you both like it? Cobb

“Darling,” said Jeremy to his wife,
as he put his arm round her waist and
led her to the baby's cradle, “let us all
sing something together. Father is
not poisoned. He lives. The family is
re-united and goes on.”
“I knew there was something funny
about that bread,” said Mrs. Jeremy.
The baby said nothing—only smiled.

THE FALSE STEP.
SHE was rich. She was beautiful
She was charming. She liked me.
I had only arrived in Switzerland th
day before. I had found the men in
the hotel prostrate at her feet. I had
gazed at her and sighed bitterly. What
chance had I?
This was our fourth dance together
We sat it out. Not even the angry
stare of her legitimate partner could
mar my happiness, any more than the
merry laugh of my legitimate partnel
could ease his misery.
We had known each other but a few
hours, and yet already we spoke of the
deep things of life—of the things which
matter—and not of the floor, the
weather, or the elusive snow. We
spoke of our inmost personalities. I
told her of my hopes, ambitions, and
ideals (a subject on which I have inside
information), and she, in return, lifted
the veil for me and showed me her
true thoughts and laughed scornfully
at the mask she turned to other men.
“How rarely one meets a fellow-
creature with whom one can be abso-
lutely natural,” she said pensively.
“How nice it would be if one could ||
always speak the truth. One gets so
tired of the daily lie and common sham.”
“Not lies,” I protested. “I hate
liars. They are so untrustworthy.
You are a woman that any man would
trust implicitly.”
“‘Lies' is a strong word,” she
laughed, “but, apart from their un-
truthfulness, they may at times be
positive virtues. For instance, sup-
posing a man were to hand me my
coffee two seconds ahead of the cup.
If I were truthful I should say, ‘Miser-
able reptile, do you realise that coffee
stains detract from the wearing value
of blue satin 2’ As it is I say, ‘Oh,
it's only an old skirt. It doesn't
matter a bit, thank you. Run along
and see if you can get me some more
coffee before it all goes. Thanks so
much.'”
“You are an angel,” I murmured.
“No, an angel would wait there till
he arrived with that second cup, but I
don't 1 I never run unnecessary risks.
Also I carefully avoid him in future.”
“Serve him right.”
“Moreover,” she continued, “when
angels say, ‘Oh, it doesn't matter a
bit, thank you,' they probably mean it.
They aren't longing to scratch the man's
eyes out all the time ! Isn't that the

“May I have another dance later 2"
I pleaded.

give you the one after this. Au revoir.”

[FEBRUARY 22, 1911.
THE DEGENERACY OF BOYS.
My morning paper recently informed me that “Mr.
Charles Thellusson yesterday presented to the museum of
a new school at Woodlands, near Doncaster, a birch
which, he explained, he stole when he was a boy at Eton.”
Something might be said as to Mr. Thellusson's position
before the law.
possible that the governing body of Eton might, if they
cared, institute a successful prosecution against Mr.
Thellusson for the dashing offence he committed, let us
say, some thirty years ago. They might also, perhaps,
recover the dreadful trophy from the museum of Wood-
lands School by means of a civil action—but I don't
suppose they will trouble themselves in either case.
What startles me, however, about this announcement is
not so much the confession of Mr. Thellusson as the
implication that a birch is now fit only for a museum—
that, in short, the manners of our boys are now so mild
that birches are not required for their traditional purpose,
but may be placed in a glass case and reserved for the
inspection and wonder of the curious, together with the
headsman's axe and the thumbscrews and the rack—
instruments rendered useless by the refinement of the
age in which we are fortunate enough to live. Has the
birch come to this? I wonder.
But even if it were proved that the birch is still, if I may
say so, in full swish all over the land wherever sound
knowledge is laboriously driven into the heads of
young males we should not be able to stop the lamenta-
tions of boisterous and patriotic old gentlemen, who are
always ready to “tell you what, Sir, the Country is going
to the dogs, Sir. They don't flog boys now, Sir, as you
and I used to be flogged. And what's the result, Sir?
I'll tell you, Sir: a miserable lot of molly-coddles, Sir.
No manliness in the whole lot of 'em. Girls, Sir, that 's
what they're being turned into. Don't talk to me about
brains, Sir. Give me a boy who can take a flogging, Sir.
You and I, Sir, didn't bother about brains, and we've not
done so badly—hey "" And thereupon he will proceed to
wonder why the Yankees and the Germans are getting
ahead of us everywhere, and will say some very severe
things about Free Trade.
For my part I am convinced that the soaring human
boy is at this moment much the same sort of jolly little
barbarian as he has always been. Probably he is better
cared for and better fed than he used to be, but he still
uses catapults, inks his fingers, spoils his clothes and
provides temporary resting-places for the birch in the old
traditional fashion. I have not yet come across the fork
with which you can drive his nature out of him. Modern
schoolmasters may take his temperature, but they can't
prevent him taking tips or, in fact, any sort of present that
may be offered to him; and it still takes wild horses to
drag him to the point of expressing his gratitude for gifts
in writing. “My dear Aunt,” wrote one little fellow,
“thanks awſully (blot) for the beautiful present it is just
what I wanted we have had a joly Chrismas except for
the beastly letter writing with love from Herbert.”
This was a boy aged ten. At an age slightly more
advanced the distaste for pen and ink begins to be
modified. Here is a letter from a boy of fourteen, describing
his first day's shooting:—My dear Grandpa, you may like
to know how I've been getting on with my shooting, well
the first day I didn't get a shot though I tramped through
Nullum tempus occurrit regi, and it is
turnips all the morning. On Tuesday I went out again
and we soon put up a covey of 15, I lost my head
completely and loosed off both barrels at once about ten
yards behind the last bird, we picked them up again 3
minutes later and having taken aim till it was out of range
I hurt my finger in trying to pull the trigger when it was
half cocked. Then we came on to birds again and I
dropped the bird behind the one I was aiming at, but five
minutes after I dropped another by a much better shot,
afterwards I got two more and returned home carrying
two brace by a string round their necks.” For a sporting
frankness which extenuates nothing this letter cannot be
beaten. There isn't a word about the cartridge hanging
fire or the sun being in the shooter's eyes.
Here finally is a Homeric letter written by an
English boy in the French language from an English
School, and addressed to the French governess of some
little girl-friends:–Chère Mademoiselle, j'espère que vous
vous portez bien. Excusez moi de ne pas avoir mit votre
nom sur l'envelope car je ne le sais pas. Aujourd'hui un
de nos garçons qui avait 16 ans ma enuyer un peut de
trop alor je lui aie dit venez vous battre avec moi, mais il
etait occupé. Je ne pouvait pas lui trouver après ceci.
Alor A la fin je lui ai fait descendre dans le Changing
Room. Il y avait beaucoup de garçons pour nous voir.
Le premier tour je lui ai fait saigner la machoire, alor,
nous nous sommes reposés pour quelques minutes. Tout
les garçons crient ‘Depeche tois 'ga sera fini en quelques
minutes, mais il criait ‘ma macheroire me fait trop mal.'
Mais après un peu de temp nous recomençons notre
battaille, cette fois je lui fait saigner le nez et je coupe sa
levre. Maintenant nous avons finis et il dit “Soyez amis,
soyez amis avec moi!” Maintenant il membete plus.
Avec beaucoup d'amour pour vous tous votre petit ami
Charles.” On the whole I think we may make our minds
easy about the degeneracy and the effeminacy of boys.
Indeed I am not at all sure that the birches won't have
to come out of their museums. R. C. L.
A PLAINTIVE HEIR.
OUR Special Interpreter sends us the following expres-
sions of opinion given by the infant Viscount MILTON
respecting the celebrations attending his christening.
“I am sorry to say,” remarked his Lordship severely,
“that the proceedings were arranged without my being
consulted, and that I cannot regard them as satisfactory.
You would think, would you not, that any celebrations on
my behalf would be such that I could be permitted to
share in them. As a matter of fact, except for the
christening, I took practically no part in the show.
“Under these circumstances I think you will admit that
some bitterness is permissible. I do not wish for one
moment to cast reflection upon the wisdom of my dear
Father and Mother, yet I still think it singular that my
every wish, upon such a day, should have been thwarted.
“I asked, quite humbly, that I might be allowed to eat
the roasted ox. The request was refused. When I desired
to taste a portion of the pink part of my own christening
cake, my demands were silenced with milk, of which I
am already growing more than weary. Instead of being
permitted to indulge in the simple pleasures of the swing-
boats and steam roundabouts, I was not permitted to
enjoy a single moment's liberty; and they didn't let off the
fireworks until I was fast asleep in the far wing.
“I understand that I shall be given another large party
when I am twenty-one. You may take it from me that I
shall insist upon different treatment then."

THE FOOTER MART.
IN ANTICIPATION OF THE NEwsPAPER OF 1921.
[The Daily Mail lately proclaimed in º
headlines that a Football Player had been sol
for £1,800, and went on to point out that this
was a record and represented a price of about
twelve guineas per pound (avoirdupois)].
Successful Auction.
MEssrs. RAMs DEN AND PLUNK held
their monthly auction at the Footer
Mart yesterday afternoon when some
attractive lots visited the block, result-
ing in a good attendance. The sale
was advertised for two o'clock precisely,
and when Mr. Joseph Ramsden
mounted the rostrum a few minutes
later cries of “Yah-Taddy-Yah-Yah”
and “Gee-Gee-Gee " predominated,
indicating the rival interests repre-
sented. Mr. Joseph kicked off by
saying that the present occasion would
be eagerly watched by exponents
throughout the world, and he hoped
that buyers would not under-estimate
the importance of the lots he was to
have the honour of putting up that day.
He reminded his hearers that although
the record of 52 guineas per pound had
not been touched that season the state
of the market plainly indicated that
bigger money would be wanted before
long. (Cheers.)
The lots were then put up. Pounds
avoirdupois unless otherwise stated.
Lot. 1. Charles Tinker.—Aged.
Dought Sheffield United, May,
1919, 173 gns. Centre Forward.
Lot withdrawn after 11 gns. had
been bid.
The Club will do well to put
this lot on the field once or
twice before offering him, as
there was an impression among
experts that he had not regained
form after the accident of being
forgotten last month by the Club
Secretary who left him in the
Cloak Room at King's Cross for
five days.
Lot 2. Four Novices (names not
given).-Apprenticed combina-
tion players, Denton Whoopers.
No records. 12s. 9d. (Ventnor
Incurables). This was a poor
lot. We think the Denton
Whoopers are ill advised in
adopting the American fashion of
shaving the scalp and cropping
the ears of their players.
Lot 3. Bert Brummles. –27. Full
back. Bought Tottenham Hot-
spurs 1918. 26 gns. Wind
defective. No bids.
Lot 4. “Captain Crumbs.”—Aged.
It was a surprise to many that
this well-known player should
appear again on the block so
soon, but it is understood that

there was something wrong
with the purchase money a
fortnight ago, the owners of
“Captain Crumbs" claiming
that he had always been knocked
down at pounds troy in compli-
ment to his small size. “Captain
Crumbs" is four feet five with a
forty-seven inch chest measure-
ment, and is nearer sixty than
fifty. He has little executive
value, his money being due to
his eccentric antics on the field
which draw big gates. His
popularity shows no signs of
waning. Forward. Bought
Trafford Creepers 1917, 28 gns.
troy; 28% gns. troy (Bramham
Maulers).
Lot 5. James Tagg.—27. Consider-
able interest was evinced when
this lot was put up, as it was his
first public appearance since he
booted the Dalston referee. and I
there was no lack of electricity
in the air when it was seen that
a good fight would result. The
lot finally fell to Mr. Postle-
thwaite, buyer to the Malton
Murderers, the immediate run-
ners-up being the Langdale
Bodysnatchers and the Pale- |
thorpe Ghosts. The price
however indicates that in the
excitement of the engagement
bidders overlooked the fact that
this lot has been putting on |
flesh while in prison and buyers
are therefore paying
quantity of superfluous blubber
which cannot be used and must
be got rid of before James takes
the field. Right Wing. Bought

given as one ton.
The proceedings then terminated.
| During the afternoon some attention
mand. This was probably the was drawn by the presence of the
first occasion upon which an American lot Silas P. Sago, which,
imported team has been knocked though catalogued, was not put up, it
down in one lot, and the circum-
stances are remarkable. After
the fiasco at the Crystal Palace
when, in its first match, the
team was beaten by the Totten-
ham Hotspurs who secured
twenty-eight goals before the
referee stopped the proceedings
at half-time, the team played a
series of matches against second-
rate amateur clubs and girls'
schools with indifferent success,
and Mr. Plunk was therefore
fully justified in offering the lot
at lump weight. Bidding was
slow, and the lot was knocked
down at £3 7s. 4d. for the lump,
to a gentleman from the
Japanese Legation. The lot
comprised sixteen details (two
being understood that he had been
acquired privately by a firm of Wall
Street Agents. Silas was in the cage
which has secured him since the fiasco
at Messrs. Wiltshire's sale when he
laid out the Auctioneer with a hefty
clip in the ribs, and the character of
this player was well established during
the afternoon by his reaching through
the bars and presenting a bystander
with a thick ear.
! We are glad to see that our old friend
Mr. George Slaver has brought off
another of his coups. Last August he
picked up Alf. Dickinson at £40 (lump
weight), Alf being in a very low way and
not expected to take the field again. Mr.
Slaver however sent him to his cure
establishment at Homburg, and we
understand that when this lot comes to
the block next week he is expected to
touch his highest previous figure—
viz., 28} gns. per lb. We congratulate
Mr. Slaver on his well-merited success.
“Melilla.-The garrison is preparing to give
General Toutée the insigned of the grand crow
of military merit.”—Le Progrés.
The General should escape while there
is yet time. -
“Diggle did nearly all the scoring in the
afternoon, but Gray turned the tables on lim
in the evening.”—Daily Mirror.
We cannot regard this as a sportsman-
like form of revenge.
“An economical mother can make from the
upper part of a lair of pants that have been
hand-knitted a very cosy skirt for a baby
petticoat, and a bodice can be cut from the
unworn portions of the leg. If this is not
dainty enough for the home baby, it will at
least make a really sensible addition to the
charity parcel.”—Daily Sketch.
Some baby or other has jolly well got
to wear it, after we've taken all this
trouble.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted from THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Thursday, Feb.
16.—Since he was gazetted out of active
service on account of perennial youth,
CHARLIE BERESFORD has taken to cruis-
ing across the lobby, up and down
the corridors, in a pair of felt slippers
several sizes too large, working his way
to win'ard with assistance of stout stick.
“What is this?” I asked, never
missing opportunity to inform my
mind. “Is it the undress uniform of a
paid-off Admiral 2" -
“No, Toby dear boy, it's gout. I
should like to use an adjective. Have
tried one or two; found them no better
than other forms of medicines; so
reſrain from further doses.”
Hard lines coming immediately on
being shelved at time of life when still
in prime mentally and, bar transient
attack of gout, physically. Happily
nothing clouds CHARLIE's cheerfulness.
Comforts himself with reflection that
he will have undivided leisure now to
look after affairs of State and see that
Navy is kept up to two-keel standard.
Lengthened life and fuller experience
do not increase his respect for Lords
of the Admiralty of whatsoever degree.
Was one himself for a couple of years,
so ought to know. Following on
formation of the MARKiss's first Ad-
ministration, they made him Lord
Commissioner of the Admiralty. But
he didn't care for the ship. One day
they brought round in ordinary course
of things an estimate of certain ex-
penditure with request that he would
sign it.
“Sign it!” cried the Lord CoMMIs-
SIONER, hailing the trembling emissary
as if he were at the other end of the
wharf. “Why, I don't know anything
about it. First I’ve seen of the figures.”
Politely explained that it was all a
matter of form. Regulations required
document should be signed by one of
the Lords of Admiralty and CHARLIE had
happened to be near at hand. He was
obdurate in refusal, and another official,
equally uninformed but more pliable,
put his name to the paper, which in due
course appeared in Navy Estimates.
As soon as he was “unmuzzled,”
like Mr. G. at Manchester in the Sixties,
CHARLIE came down to House and in
Committee on Navy Estimates moved
an Amendment. It was terse and to
the point. “The allocation of authority
at the Admiralty,” so it ran, “requires
entire reform.”
Remember two yarns CHARLIE spun
in illustration of his thesis. One told
how a Lord of the Admiralty, receiving
account of disaster to a ship, couched
in technical terms familiar on the
quarter-deck and in the gun-room,
thought it was bad language, and
penned a minute gravely censuring
the Captain guilty of the imagined
indiscretion.
Another story related to a civilian
Lord whom the House thought it re-
cognised. News reached Admiralty
of a ship's crew being cast away on
small island in the Pacific. Looking
over chart, and finding that a cruiser
homeward bound had, according to
admission made in ship's log, passed
the island distant by only two inches'
space on the chart, he indignantly
wanted to know why the Captain hadn't
looked in and brought the men off.
As CHARLIE explained to delighted

Committee, the two inches' space
marked on the chart represented a dis-
tance of 4,000 miles at sea.
These are frivolities. Let us not
forget or fail to recognise that behind a
smiling countenance CHARLIE BERES-
FoRD has through a period of thirty
years cherished and pursued a serious
purpose. To few men more directly than
to him is due awakening of Ministerial
mind and public conscience to neces-
sity of keeping the British Navy at a
standard of strength and efficiency
calculated to safeguard the Empire in
time of peril.
Business Done.— Time of Private
Members up to Easter appropriated
for Parliament Bill.
Friday, 17th.-Address out of the
way, are settling down to real work of
Session. Labour Members approach it
| with pleased consciousness that what-
ever may happen they have had them-
selves photographed in a group seated
in their accustomed quarter below
Gangway on Ministerial side. Here
was missed, not for the first time, the
skilful art, the tireless energy of Sir
BENJAMIN STONE. During his long
honourable service as Member for East
Birmingham, he photographed every-
thing and nearly everybody connected
with House. Never thought of
doing the Labour Members. In his
absence they had recourse to opera-
tor with flash-light, an agency which
gave a curiously spectral look to the
face and figure of “MABON,” just back
from Buckingham Palace, where he
had been invested with the high, well-
earned dignity of Privy Councillor.
Incident attracted much interest.
Example likely to be followed by other
sections. The Welsh Members are
thinking of having a turn. ELLIs
GRIFFITHs, new Leader, sounded on
subject, has intimated that if affair
comes off he shall have no objection
to appear with a harp in his hand and
a bardic wreath bound about his manly
brow. The Scotch Members not
likely to be left out of a good thing.
We may presently be able to enrich
our albums with photographs, cabinet
size, displaying EUGENE WASON at the
head of his clan, wearing the kilt and
hugging the pibroch.
With object of making fuller study of
the effect of new departure in Parlia-
mentary procedure, pressure is being
brought to bear on PRIME MINISTER to
induce him to authorise copies of the
Labour Members' photographs to be
circulated with the Votes.

AT THE PLAY.
“ALL THAT MATTERs.”
THE title is a breezy rendering of the
motto, “Quid cetera prosunt & " You
might think it meant the world well
lost for love or honour or the saving
of a soul. Not at all. Something
much more solid is thrown in, as you
may see from the arms that go with
the legend and symbolise peace and
plenty in addition to a woman's love.
So the motto is not so very splendid.
And I couldn't find that it had much
relation to the facts of the play. For
the hero, though he gets his woman's
love in the end, is not likely to have
much “peace” with it, to judge from
her uncertain and vixenish behaviour;

“I've got her, Pacy,
. . Mr. Norman TREvoR.
and I see no prospect of “plenty" for
him if he does no better than he did
with his farm, which was always in a
rotten state.
So much for the title. The play
itself contains a few well-observed
characters and a patch or two of
idealism, but its scheme is of the
most artificial and improbable. There
never seems to be any good reason
for anything that happens. A fatuous
female, belonging to a party of Cockney
trippers, tripping in Dorset, is inspired
for no reason in the world to write an
anonymous postcard to a local squire
suggesting that he should marry the
daughter of a local yeoman. The girl
loves another, and for no particular
reason concludes that he wrote the
post card. Having already quarrelled
with him, on the silly pretext that he
had neglected his farm because his
thoughts were always with her, she
now consents to yield to the advances
of the squire, who, instead of being
put off, as you might expect, by the
anonymous missive, admits that it
helped to confirm him in his original
designs upon her.
At times the action went with a
very halting movement. People always
seemed to be wanting to get off the
stage and unable to. The audience,
eager to speed them into the wings,
was impotent. If it was an interior,
then a door got in the way; if it was
a cave, then the rising tide detained
them; and if they were on the top of
a down, with nothing to stay their
departure, still they stuck.
What attraction the play provided
was due to the fine performances of
some of the secondary characters.
Mr. FISHER WHITE made a noble
shepherd, whose dignity had an ex-
cellent foil in the frivolous vulgarity of
the trippers. But in the last Act he
seemed to grow tired of his own voice,
and the audience agreed with him.
Mr. WARBURTON gave an admirable
study of a Scotch agent. But the
most remarkable character-sketch was
that of Miss HELEN HAYE as the yeo-
man's wife. With rather colourless
material she did wonderful things.
Miss NEILson-TERRY, as the heroine,
had an uncongenial part, in which a
great deal of arbitrary conduct was
required of her. Gaiety and tender-
ness are the qualities that belong to
such youth as hers, and she had little
chance of exhibiting either. One traced
signs of incipient staginess in her
manner, a tendency that is bound to
develop if more discretion is not used
in the choice of the right parts for her.
Mr. NorMAN TREvor worked con-
scientiously as the lover, and seemed
to think out everything very carefully
before he said it. But it was a lifeless
and ligneous part. As for Mr. LYALL
SweTE, who ought always to be an
old professor or some sort of detached
antiquity, being gifted by nature with
a voice that would be the making of a
don, he was, of course, an absurd
selection for the character of a squire.
The trippers, though they were
dragged in rather wantonly, were
attractive till we had had too much of
them. There was one who kept on
saying, “That's quite right,” and she
was a great source of joy to me.
Everybody did his best for the play,
but I cannot predict any great profit for
the Haymarket. “All that matters ”
is not gold ; it is a rough lump of
quartz, with here and there a streak of
precious metal, in the proportion of
about ten pennyweight to the ton,
hardly enough to repay the labour of
crushing. O. S.

At eventide I love to lie at gaze,
Wallowing while the calid water wets me,
And illy watch (provided that the haze
Subtly composed of steam and soap-suds lets me)
The sea-gulls and the jelly-fish and all
The jolly things that deck my bathroom wall.
It makes me think of those delightful dips
I mean to have this year in far-off August,
With gentle wavelets lapping lound my hips
And sunshine beating on me, and no raw gust
To shake my courage with its bitter sting
And counsel me to shirk the beastly thing.
I turn the tap and conjure up the scene
What time I let some more hot water trickle:
Old Oc an shall be bright with silver sheen,
And Zephyrs for the nonce shall not be fickle,
While flving birds and swimming fish and such
Mºre odds and ends shall add their pleasing touch.
The prospect charms—but that 's at eventide,
When prospects have a knack of looking rosy.
Next morning comes and spreads a frost outside,
And things begin to look a lot more prosy.
Moreover, men who like their water hot
Are never optimistic when it's not.
So, while I take the Briton's brutal tub
And view the scene of cloud and fin and feather,
I call to mind (yes, there's the wretched rubl)
Last summer's bathes in diabolic weather;
Then do I murmur sadly, “Hope is vain;
Things will be just as rotten once again.”

MARRIAGE A LA MODE.
THE MULL-KLAw WEDDING.
(From our New York Correspondent.)
I HAVE just returned from witnessing
the most superb scenic happening in
the whole annals of the New World.
The wedding of Miss Mélisande
Semiramis Klaw to the Marquis of
Mull was solemnised to-day at the
First Church of Rarer Thought, Flat-
bush Avenue, Dr. van Pelt Blotters
officiating.
THE MENACED MARQUIs.
Though the Marquis of Mull had
received many sinister threatening
letters, no untoward incident occurred
to mar the harmony of the nuptials, but
special precautions had been taken to
guard against accidents, and it was
noted that the principal actors in the
ceremony wore a strained expression
which hardly accorded with so blissful
an occasion.
EscorTED BY BLooDHouNDs.
In addition to a force of 500 police,
armed with Mauser pistols and sand-
bags, who mounted guard outside the
Marquis's hotel, the carriages of the
bride and groom were closely guarded
by a squadron of Pinkerton's mounted
detectives, each horseman holding a
Cuban bloodhound in a leash, the
baying of the formidable quadrupeds
blending admirably with the salvoes
of artillery which were discharged at
intervals by a battery of the Mull
Territorials, who had crossed the
Atlantic to do honour to their chief-
tain.
SCENE IN THE SANCTUARY.
The church, which is a splendid
specimen of Flamboyant Rococo archi-
tecture, was profusely decorated with
golden rod and thistle, typifying the
significance of the union, and banners
emblazoned with the names of the
protagonists of Rarer Thought, such as
Ulysses Opp, Hendrik van Boogaard,
and Volney Streaker, were tastefully
disposed along the nave, which was
carpeted with rich sables.
A LIST OF LUMINARIES.
Shortly after the Marquis of Mull
appeared at the altar rail with his best
man, Lord Ian Pluscardine, the bride
entered the sanctuary leaning on the
arm of her father, Mr. Schenectady P.
Klaw. She was preceded by two
flower-girls, the Misses Gloriana and
Polyxena Klaw, and two pages, Master
Jared Oelstreich and Master Agag
Naselheimer, bearing wands of 22-carat
gold with electric-lighted tips. Behind
the bride marched the chief maid of
honour, Miss Aphrodite Klaw, followed
by the six bridesmaids, the Misses
Volumnia Vandercrup, Artemis Chew,
Jeanne Darc Pogram, Araminta Crom-
well Bangs, Aspasia Conger and Miriam
Otaheite Stodge, the last-named , re-
placing Miss Sonora Schlumbacher,
who is suffering from Californian
mumps. Rumour credits Miss Stodge
with being engaged to Mr. Bolossy
Klaw, a brother of the bride, but no
official announcement has yet been
made. Miss Stodge's mother, it may
be mentioned, was the former Peruvian
Princess, Dadapalona Fuflunga, in
whose veins runs the bluest blood of
the Onoto Incas. The Princess was
conspicuous amongst the 5,000 guests
in a superb robe of Peruvian pemmican,
set off by a conical talc helmet with a
phosphorescent peak and puma-skin
ear-flaps. The service was partly
choral, partly orchestral, but altogether
bioscopic. Mr. Pinkerton presided
at the grand organ, Mr. Samson
Bangs had charge of the instruments
of percussion, and Professor Rooseboom
operated the contrabass tonkophone.
I had almost forgotten to add that the
ushers numbered eight, including Lord
Archibald Kingander, Mr. Otis Slott,
Mr. Nahum Titus, Mr. Ignatius Loyola
Schloss and Mr. Peabody Greathead.
Lord Talboys acted as ringmaster, and
Senator Tertius Cramp was janitor of
the vestry.
CoNFECTIONERY IN Excelsis.
The wedding cake is generally
admitted to have been the richest and
largest example of matrimonial con-
ſectionery ever constructed. It was
ten storeys or 100 feet high, and
weighed 20 tons. The confectioners
state that it cost 100,000 dollars, but
this is obviously an underestimate. It
was profusely embellished with cupids,
farandoles, ghibellines, gobelins, aba-
cots, holophotes, marabouts and other
appropriate figures. Ten detectives,
disguised in angelica uniforms with
almond-paste buckles, were concealed
in the interior, one in each storey, to
prevent depredations on the part of
sweet-toothed kleptomaniacs.
MR. KLAw's CHEQUE.
Although the presents were of un-
paralleled sumptuousness and splen-
dour, they were naturally eclipsed by the
chief exhibit of the collection, Mr.
Klaw's cheque. This was displayed on
a special stand under a crystal magnify-
ing glass and was guarded by a special
posse of detectives dressed as noblemen
of the Court of Louis XIV. The
amount of the cheque was so porten-
tous that the resources of wireless
telegraphy are unequal to an accurate
record of the figures into which it
runs. The bride's wedding dress was
of old Clos Vougeot satin with mosaic
insertions of peacock's feathers imitated
in precious stones. She wore a triple
diamond tiara illuminated by a radium
fountain, and her shoes had belonged
to MARIE ANToINETTE.
HINTS ON HEALTH.
According to a writer in The
Medical Times, among the symptoms of
digestive failure or “slow suicide” may
be included “a feeling of lightness and
ease after a substantial meal, hunger
some two hours subsequently, and
sound sleep at night.” As this appears
to us to open up fresh and absorbing
regions of speculation for the hypochon-
driac, we have ourselves been at pains
to collect a few similar warnings. As
under:-
A craving for open-air exercise on a
fine day, coupled with exhilaration
and a marked absence of fatigue, is one
of the most significant symptoms of
approaching beri-beri.
Pronounced cheerfulness in the early
morning, manifesting itself in sustained
and jovial conversation at the break-
fast-table, very frequently precedes an
attack of homicidal mania—on the part
of somebody else.
Similar hilarity at the evening meal,
increasing towards the close of the day,
is usually caused by incipient alcoholic
poisoning.
Optimism generally, or a disposition
to look at the bright side of things,
should be regarded with the gravest
suspicion. The patient should at once
consult as many volumes of the medical
press as may be obtainable. A course
of these, even should it fail to identify
the precise malady, will almost
invariably be found to have removed
the symptom.
The Five Hundred Pour Rire.
Mr. GULLAND, Scottish Whip, who
was reported to have announced that
he was already compiling a list of
possible new Peers, has denied the
allegation and attributed the misunder-
standing to the dulness of his Edinburgh
audience. To compensate for the dis-
appointment caused by this démenti,
Mr. Punch himself, ever animated by a
passionate desire to make his pages the
repository of the best British humour,
is prepared to receive the names of any
gentlemen volunteering for nobility,
and to publish them in his columns.
Better Late than Never.
“The Mayor proposed ‘that the Coronation
of His Majesty King E ward V. le loyally and
properly celebrated in the Borºugh.'"

Laughter.) Stung to emulation
by this jeu d'esprit, Mr. TAFT is alleged to have remarked: “If we are
going to embark on the annexation business, we must at the earliest
opportunity annex the Aurora borealis.” Further laughter was pro-
voked by this sally.]
WHEN a talk of wiping up a sister nation
Sent a ſlutter round the Ministerial camp;
When there broke, in fact, a cry for annexation
Through the nostrils of a party known as CHAMP;
In the course of honorific Saturnalia,
He for whom they felled the fatted ox
Calculated they would soon absorb Australia,
And the laughter set 'em shaking in their socks
At the persiflage of Secretary KNox.
Close upon that elemental flash of humour
Came an effort from another local wit,
One by whom, if we may credit native rumour,
After-dinner sides are regularly split;
“Following up,” said he, “its via triumphalis,
Lo, our Eagle—every plume become a shaft—
Will at once annex Aurora Borealis "
And the feasters, full and generous, loudly laughed
At the badinage of bully BILLY TAFT.
Thus the shameless CHAMP has had his notion shivered
By the ridicule that cracks a folly's crust,
Yet so lightly and so gracefully delivered
That a smile adorns his features in the dust;
Ay, and we, who may not hope to touch these levels,
Feel a natural envy gnaw our British breast,

When we think that even we might learn to jest,

II. ON THE LIFE OF JUSTICE ONoocool, CHUNDER
MooRER JEE.
1. WHAT was the comment of little Mookerjee's Moulowee,
“senile as he was and grown grey in the profession of a
tutor,” upon his pupil's extraordinary precocity? Answer:
That “it was to him quite a wonderment wrought by a
little mechanism of flesh and blood.”
2. Did Mookerjee show any quarrelsome or resentful
tendencies as a schoolboy 7 Answer: No. “Little Mook-
erjee never had a snip-snap with any of his college boys,
and was indeed of so ſorbearing a disposition that he would
not even notice what impulsive natures would have
signally retaliated as an insult.” -
3. In what manner did he protest when “a Cyclopean
Inglish sailor” came out of the Ochterlony monument,
and, after giving him “a severe blow on his head, which
rendered him impercipient for a few moments,” referred to
him as a “niggar"? Answer: It “stung little Mookerjee
to the quick, and he addressed his rude assailant for more
than an hour . . . enlarging on the duty of regarding all
men as fellow-brethren.”
4. Was the family left well- or ill-provided for at his
father's decease ? Answer: “The family was threatened
with Barmecide feast.”
5. What was Onoocool Chunder's “first business on
making an income"? Answer: “To extricate his family
from the difficulties in which it had been lately enwrapped
and to restore happiness and sunshine to those sweet and
well-beloved faces on which he had not seen the soft and
fascinating beams of a simper for many a grim-visaged |
ear.” * - -
y 6. How was his health affected in July, 1869? Answer:
“He was attacked with a doloriferous boil.” -
7. Would you say that he was, or was not, “orthodox
to that pitch, as there are many Bramins now who, after
having perpetrated heaps of the lowest dregs of vice,
would go and bathe once in the Ganges . . . having a
faith in that stream as one having the power to absterse
one's heart from sin, they will go on committing sin till
they pop off"? Answer: He was not. “He had no
such troth in the Ganges and feared the very name of sin.”
8. Give some description of his personal appearance.
Answer: “When a boy he was filamentous, but gradually
in the course of time he became plump as a partridge . . . . .
He was neither a Brobdignagian nor a Liliputian, but a
man of mediocre size, fair complexion, well-shaped nose,
hazel eyes, and ears well proportioned to the face, which
was of a little round cut with a wide front and rubiform
lips. He had moulded arms and legs, and the palms of his
hands and feet were very small and thick with their
proportionate fingers. His head was large, it had very
thin hairs on it; and he had a moustache not close set and
a little brownish on the top of his upper lip." . . . . . .
9. In what condition did he make his last exit from
his court 2 Answer: “He left like a toad under a harrow.”
10. How may we ascertain from Justice Mookerjee's
own statement the age at which his father died ? Answer:
“My father went to reside with the morning stars at about
this age of mine.” (Last words of Justice Mookerjee, who
is stated by his biographer to have departed this like at the
age of forty-two.) -
11. What effect had “the doctors' puissance and knack
of medical knowledge” on their patient? Answer: “It
proved, after all, as if to milk the ram . . . He remained
sotto voce for a few hours and then went to God at about
6 P.M.”
12. Describe the condition of his home after his decease.
Answer: “Tho house presented a second Babel or a pretty
kettle of fish.”
In the opinion of Mr. Punch, the best set of answers
was received from Sooshen Sheekhur Pukkabhoy, Esq.,
16, Cheechy Terrace, Bayswater, W. F. A.
Another Event of the Coronation Year.
From a pamphlet:—
“We are enthralled by a two-headed dragon. With one maw it
protects the dog in the manger, with the other it attacks improve-
ments.”
Up maws and at them!

And still more easily if the leg is pulled and the oil offered
to them as golden syrup.

| “He [the late Mr. MARION CRAwford] was so
scrupulous that he would not write about any
subject of which he had not personally and
practically mastered the details. “A Roman
Singer' was the outcome of years of familiarity
with the musical life of Rome; for “Marietta:
a Maid of Venice' he went into every process
of Venetian glass work on the spot. In order
to write “Marzio's Crucifix' Crawford became
a silversmith, making his own designs and
beating them out in the metal in lovely classic
forms. For ‘The Witch of Prague’ he went
and lived in that city and learned Bohemian,
which Mrs. Hugh Fraser says was the seven-
teenth language he had acquired.”

WITH this example before them some
of our more energetic novelists are
already deep in their autumn campaign.
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT has just begun
a trifle of some 260,000 words, which he
will have ready by April, the only delay
being due to the difficulty of obtaining
a first-hand knowledge of the inner
life of an Oswestry house-agent in the
comparatively brief time at his dis-
posal. He is, however, confident of
Success.
Mr. SILAs K. HockING, whose name
has been not inaptly described as more
Americanthan the Americans, is making
a departure in fiction, his next book
being devoted to an intimate study of
the Smart Set. With this object in view
he has taken a suite of rooms in a Gower
Street boarding house and a season
ticket for the Brondesbury Rink. A
human document of unusual value and
courage is anticipated.
Mr. E.M. ForsTER, in order to prepare
for his next novel, Norfolk's Treat, is
adding a new and more comfortable
arm-chair to his study.
The CHEVALIER LE QUEUx, whose
accuracy is only equalled by his
distinction, has taken rooms in Sidney
Street in order that nothing actual
may be lacking from his forthcoming
romance of anarchy, which will be
entitled The Radium Bomb.
There is no truth in the rumour that
in order to fit himself for his new novel
Mr. HENRY JAMEs is attending a series
of classes on elementary syntax.
Considerable anxiety is felt by the
friends of Mr. R. S. HICHENs at the
startling news which has reached them
from Taormina. In order to get an
inside view of the operations of the
Sicilian brigands for his next romance,
Mr. HICHENs has joined one of the most
active bands under the picturesque alias
of Malatesta Spaghetti.
Undeterred by the criticism passed
on his humanitarian methods by a
writer in the Nineteenth Century, Mr.
John GALsworthy has, so we are
assured, been recently seen in the
picturesque garb of a Dartmoor shep-
herd in the neighbourhood of Chagford,
where he is engaged on his new play,
entitled Preventive Detention.
The prowess of Mr. E. PHILLIPs
OPPENHEIM on the Norfolk links is
well known. With the view, however,
of lending an intimate touch to his
new novel he has apprenticed himself
to a well-known club-maker at St.
Andrews. The title of his forthcoming
romance is The Schenectady Mystery,
in which a Scotch professional is un-
justly accused of murdering a rival
with the deadly weapon in question.

HAROLD IN INDIA.
[Mr. HARold Begbie, the eulogist of Mr.
Liow D George, the interpreter of Sir Olive R
Long E and the champion of the oppressed
| agricultural labourer, is visiting India for the
first time.]
THERE is bliss on the banks of the
Ganges, -
There is glee in the vales of Assam,
There is mirth in the halls that are
RANJI's
And joy in the heart of their Jam.
The bazaars of remote Tinnevelly
Resound with the din of the drum,
And they're holding high revel at
Delhi,
For BEGBIE has come !
Will they make him a Rajah, I wonder,
And grant him a special salute?
Will he hold a Durbar at Secunder-
abad, or prefer to be mute?
Will the morals of Simla distress him 2
Will he highly approve of the Taj?
Will he visit Lord HARDINGE and
bless him,
Or boycott the Raj?
Will he scale with the ease of a squirrel
The perilous peaks of Nepal?
Will he back Mr. VALENTINE CHIRor,
Will he stand by KEIR HARDIE, or
fall ?
Will he traverse the passes of Sikkim 2
Will he track the wild ass” to his
lair?
When he sees the wild pig, will he
stick him,
Or will he forbear?
Will the Akhond of Swat's jubilation
Be pleasant or painful to see?
Will the Begums of Oude in rotation
Invite him to afternoon tea 2
Will he cross to Colombo and Kandy
By boat or by ačroplane?
Will he mount to the hills in a dandy
Or travel by train?
I know not ; but this I am sure of
A man of his stamp and his school
Is bound to discover the cure of
Whatever is wrong with our rule.
And his style in its tropical fervour
Will wholly outdazzle The Mail,
And make the full-blooded Observer
Look perfectly pale.
For there's none who can ladle out
butter
So deftly on demagogues' heads;
There is none who on snipe of the
gutter
A richer eulogium sheds.
There is none so unbridled in praising
The aims of St. DAVID LLoyd
GEORGE ;
* “The will ass . . . is confined to the sandy
desºrts of Sind and Cutch, where, from its
speed and timidity, it is almost unapproach-
able.”—Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. xv.,
p. 380.
There is none more efficient in raising
A delicate gorge.
He will tell without any compunction
The steepest of tales of the plains,
And discourse with impartial unction
Of rajahs and ryots and rains;
The jungle will gather new glories
When BEGBIE has threaded its brakes,
And gleaned a new budget of stories
Of tigers and snakes.
But what India gains by his teaching
We lose while our HAROLD's away;
And Peers, undeterred by his preaching,
Will resume their nefarious sway.
Unabashed by the Savonarola
Who lashes the sins of the age,
They'll play on the godless pianola
And wildly rampage.
So when he has fittingly carolled
The praise of the fabulous East
We'll hail the return of our HAROLD,
Democracy's lyric high priest.
For while he is absent there shineth
No star on the pathway of Hodge,
And, reſt of his trumpeter, pineth
Sir OLIVER LoDGE.
ROSY.
“AND how did the new horse go?”
I asked in the intervals of puffing at
the spirit lamp.
“Like that.” The youngest subal-
tern nodded grimly.
“Like what ?” -
“Like you sound blowing out the
thingamy.”
I offered him the sympathy of a
great silence and a cup of tea.
“It wasn't obvious, was it—not as
if she'd had a spavin or been fired for
curby hocks or anything like that 2. It
was all inside, you know, and the hair
on her beastly face prevented one from
seeing that she was pale or anything.
She was a nice-looking mare, wasn't
She 2"
I assured him that I had never seen
an animal with a sweeter expression or
a better permanent wave in her tail.
“And yet, after all, I'd have done
better to stick to the twelve-pounder—
but one never knows.”
“Two might have,” I said, “if one
had been a vet.”
He seemed a trifle hurt at that, so I
played a mollifying question upon him.
“What have you called her?”
“Rose,” he made answer softly, and
appeared red-faced from hunting his
tea-spoon, which had taken cover
behind the right-hand back leg of his
chair.
“Rose?”
He grinned painfully, and the exi-
gencies of his dejected attitude revealed
the startling fact that he was wearing
pink socks. I looked up, and my
eyes were confronted by a purple neck-
tie. I was not mistaken.
“You are in trouble, my friend ?”"
He nodded wearily.
“I had named her aſter Rosy
O'Callian.” He hung his well-oiled
young head. -
“Did she seem pleased ?”
“Pleased ?” He put his tea-cup
into safety and shrugged his shoulders.
“That isn't the worst of it, though.
I went to the meet yesterday a hopeful,
happy man; to-day I know that my
mare isn't as sound as a worn-out
‘hairy,' that the prettiest girl in the
county is laughing at me and that her
mother is thirsting for my blood.”
“Lady O'Callian 2"
“Yes. It happened like this. We
had one short run and lost again. I
was beginning to find out what my
brute was made of in fact she was
pretty well confiding it to the whole
field—and when I rode up to Rosy
whilst we were waiting at the next
covert she would pretend that my poor
brute was a motor—said that so long
as my engine was making such a noise,
I shouldn't need to sound the horn.”
“I see. And did she know about
the mare's name then 2"
“Yes, I had told her at the meet.”
“And she wasn't flattered 2" -
“I don't believe she was. She said
it was rather an anachronism; seemed
to think it was a bit rough on her, and
asked me if I'd mind telling people
that it was the other way round and
they had named her after the horse.”
I pressed a tea-cake upon him and
awoke him from a mournful reverie.
“What's in a name?” I asked him.
“A good deal. What was I telling
you—about the run? Well, you can
guess that after Rosy had said that
about the horn I didn't feel over-cheer-
ful, and when the fox broke at last I
thought I'd make just one effort not to
look quite such a fool. We had a
brisk quarter-of-an-hour, and it seemed
to me that pretty well all the field
went by me. Then they checked again,
and, when the stragglers came up, for
a wonder Rosy's mother was among
them and simply covered with mud.”
“Well, if she was covered with mud,
somebody must be due to alter his
land valuation forms, I think.” I
made the remark as an interjection,
and he disregarded it.
“Lady O'Callian came straight up
to me and spoke. ‘Mr. Smithson,'
she said, ‘do you call yourself?' I
explained to her that I never call
myself; that I always leave it to my
servant to wake me when he brings
my shaving water. ‘I mean, is it
'Smithson' your friends call you ?’ she

went on, and her face grew red. I
really had begun to feel awfully pleased
by her coming to ask all those friendly
little questions, and I told her... that
though some of my friends call me
'Smithson' I like it best when they
make it “Freddy.’”
“Do you?” she said. “Well, let me
assure you, young man, that I don't
like such familiarities, and I won't
have you calling me by my Christian
name, or swearing at me either, so
take care of that.” .
“I told her that I had never done
such a thing in all my life.”
“Oh!” she said; “then what was
that you said when I'd taken a toss
into the ditch a couple of fields beyond
there, and you jumped right over me,
if it wasn't "Get up, Rosy, you old fool!'
—tell me that.”
“Awful! Did she believe when you
explained about the horse?”
He shook his head. “I couldn't
very well!”
“Of course her name is ‘Rosy' too !
You hadn't dreamed that she was
lying there.”
“No; it was perfectly true. Do
you think I like the idea of jumping
over Rosy's mother? It's not—nice.”
The youngest subaltern sighed as he
got up to go. “It's over,” he said
sadly. “My day's done, my dream's
finished; I'm a miserable outcast, and,
as the poet Johnnies say, troubles
never-come singly. I've lost my flask.”
THE DUNMOW DOODLE-DOO.
THERE is good news for the lovers of
animal and mechanical noise, for the
first public cock-crowing competition
in England is to be held at Dunmow
shortly, under the auspices of the
district poultry association. The donor
of the first prize, Mr. J. W. Robertson
Scott, of Great Canfield, stated the
other day that in Belgium he found
such competitions for cockerels to be
very popular and useful, presenting all
the excitement of cock-fighting without
the brutality.
However, the cockerels are not going
to have it all their own way in rural
Essex. Already we hear of a dog-
barking tournament, promoted by the
Ladies' Kennel Club of Great Baddow.
A sine quá non for entry is that the
competitor's voice shall be able to
carry as far as Chelmsford, three miles
off, and wake the inhabitants thereof
on a still, moonlight night.
As a counterblast to this, the little
village of Matching, not far away, has
developed a promising feline orchestra
of entirely local talent. After pains-
taking selection and weeding-out of
inefficient performers, the impresario

CHAPTER I.
THE Manager knocked at the door
of the editorial sanctum and came in
briskly.
“Ah,” said the Editor, “here you
are. Good. Help yourself.”
The Manager sat down and helped
himself.
“Well,” said the Editor, “you see
how it is. Our campaign on behalf of
Standard Butter, including the er— ”

ochre, has certainly done an immense

“But there comes a point where one's

week they only came to—”
The Editor coughed and turned to
his desk. “I sketched out a little idea
this morning,” he wenton, “which might
keep up the interest for a few days
longer. It's just an imaginary con-
versation and goes like this: ‘The
following dialogue was overheard at
a well-known West-end dairyman's
yesterday afternoon :-
Lady Blank. Will you send up six
pounds of butter to Berkeley Square
to-morrow, instead of the usual four 2
Dairyman. Certainly, my lady. (To
Assistant) Six pounds of butter for
Lady Blank.’
“And then we could put a little note
underneath, something in this manner:
‘The above is typical of what is going
on every day in the West-end of
London. The denizens of Park Lane,
Curzon Street and Cadogan Square are
as insistent upon Standard Butter as
are families in less fashionable parts
of the Metropolis.’ You see what I
mean 2 ”
“Good,” said the Manager.
“It was just an idea,” said the
Editor modestly. “It occurred to me
in the train. But it is time we thought
of something else. Something entirely
new. Now have you any ideas?”
The Manager thought profoundly.
“What about Standard Jam 2 " he
said at last, “including the raspberry
and eighty per cent. of the splinters.”
“No, no,” said the Editor im-
patiently. “Something on entirely
different lines.”
The Manager thought again.
“Of course,” the Editor went on,
“we can always fall back on a com-
petition of some kind. You increase
the intelligence of the country—”
“And the circulation.”

“Well?” said the Editor next day.
“How do you grow carrots?” asked
the Manager.
“I don't know,” said the Editor coldly.
“I suppose in the ground. Why?”
“It was Parsons' idea. He said we
might give a prize for the best bunch
of carrots. I don't quite know what
he meant.”
“If Parsons tries to be funny again
in this office he'll have to go. We've
warned him once before.”
“Still,” persisted the Manager,
“there... is something in the idea.
Carrots come from seeds, don't they 2”
“I dare say,” said the Editor
indifferently.
“Well, if we gave a prize for the
best bunch of carrots—of not less than
twelve sprays, Parsons says—then the
people who went in for it would naturally
want to buy seeds and—and loam and
things. And so the people who had
seeds and loam to sell would naturally

“I see,” the Editorinterrupted hastily.
“You mean that we should stimulate

“It had better be a flower, I think.”
“Buttercups or chrysanthemums or
something,” said the Manager vaguely.

Editor suddenly. “Was it the pansy?”

CHAPTER III.
“The announcement we made yester-
day of a prize of £1,000,000 for the
best bunch of carnations, including
not more than twelve spikes, has been
received with startling enthusiasm by
all the seedsmen of the Empire. A very
pleasing feature of the correspondence
which poured in yesterday was the
number of congratulations from well-
known firms. A still more pleasing
feature, however, was the number of
advertisements.
“The competition is especially one
for the London grower, carnations
being notoriously partial to smoke. It
is even more especially one for the
country grower, who can give his
carnations the open air and exercise of
which they are so much in need. It
is generally considered, however, that
the suburban gardener will stand the
best chance, as this delicate flower,
with its fondness for animal society,
thrives most strongly in the neigh-
bourhood of cats.
“It is hoped that a feeling of loyalty
(carnations being the Coronation flower)
will induce everybody to enter for this
competition. You may not win the
great prize, you may not even win a
medal, but our advertisers will at least
have the consolation of knowing that
you have bought a packet of seeds.”
The Editor put down his proof and
rang the bell. “Who wrote this and
gave the whole show away?” he asked
the Sub-editor sternly. “Parsons?
Thank you. Will you say I should

THE BATTLE of PINKRE.
I DEDCATE these stories to my afecshnate uncle with
love from Alice he is older than me but I will be as old
as him sumday and he will then kno wot care I took of
him now the battle that you are just going to read which is
the battle of Pinkre between the French and the English
was a very firce battle, the English arma had 5403th men
and the French arme had 8924th but the French King was
in an awful state.
But I must first tell you about a boy whose name was
James Frederick this boy was the son of the last King of
England who had not been a properly King but had been an
egsile and had died there leeving his son swiving but this
son did not kno he was a King he only spected it he was
not James the first or James the second his royl name was
James the nothing and he lived by hisself in a cottage.
One morning James got up erly before brekfus and walked
up a hill what he new and on the top of the hill he found a
palis what he didn't kno so he said to hisself sumbody's put
up this palis I must go in and see about it so he went into
a mense salune. There was a lether bag on a table and when
James touched it it broke open and a lot of gold rushd out
Haha said James stufing the gold into his pockets Haha
I will bie canon balls with this but at this moment a tal
dark man with a bierd burst into the room when the boy
James sor the man he new he must make an escuse so he
looked at the man and said If you plees Sir your chimnies
want sweeping but the man looked at him and said Well and
your nose wants wiping. The man was the French King
and after this they hated one anuther.
Now I will get back to the battle by this time James had
cum to the throne and the French King's name was
Charles. The foot soldiers had thire guns and the Kings
had thire sords and helmets and thire were korprils with
flags. The French King was in grate trouble becas he
had just had a little baby girl and had noone to look
after it, so he could not do much in fighting. One day
when the little French girl was ten years old and she
was playing in the garden a soldier came and said
to her Were is the King. Why she said. Becas the
English are coming. What the English are coming, go
and gather up the arme quick quick. I can't do it said
the soldier runing at the same time I can't do it becas
thire trampling down the corn oh were is the King.
The little girl bagen to cry oh dear oh dear were can be
be.
Left right Left right.
What is that she said and she looked round and she sor
cuming towards her the hole English arme.
Oh do not hurt me she cried, nelying down at Jameses
feet and he did not take eny notise of her but marched on
throu the gates. But soon she herd James cry out We
have one the battle and King Charles is ded.
The little girl did not mind very much she was to yung
and next summer she was marred to the brave King of
England and they had ten boys and two girls and often
talked of the battle of Pinkre were they met the first time.

THE GREAT white SALE.
(By one who misapprehended the words.)
Not here, not here, where drapers squander,
-
It seems (I say) I was mistaken;
In sheer self-sacrifice, -
Their hoarded goods, I saw you wander,
But where eternal ice -
Glitters about the Great White Stick
Found by Commander PEARY (sic)
I fancied you a creature rare
(Something betwixt a seal and bear),
Furry and far from nice.
A beast within whose larder-cupboard
Were remnants mouldering long,
A beast at whom the sperm-whale blubbered,
The walrus ceased his song,
I saw you thus, O Great White Salel
Having observed upon the tail
Of some one's millinery cart
Those awful words, but — bless my heart—
It seems that I was wrong.
I saw you also by the hummocks
That formed your frozen lair;
tout sailors crawled upon their stomachs
With dirk and cutlass bare;
I saw you, as the fray began,
Savagely maul them man by man,
Till at the last you, growling, died
And all about were bits of hide,
Buttons and bones and hair.
That is the worst of bards,
The wings of fancy once you waken
They soar for yards and yards;
But, since my aunt, my good aunt Jane,
Has been so kind as to explain
Exactly what a White Sale is,
The knowledge of these mysteries
Has spoilt my house of cards.
Or has it? when the Muse considers
The bargain-room that teems
With crowds of petticoated bidders,
The anguish and the screams,
The broken armies that emerge,
The triumph paean and the dirge,
I say, when she considers this
The Muse is not so badly dis-
appointed of her dreams.
The Blood, the Tumult, and the Terror,
The tresses flying fleet
(Although I placed the thing by error
Too far from Oxford Street),
All, all are there (I take it) when,
Torn with a strength unknown to men
By damsels pitiless and pale,
The carcase of the Great White Sale
Falls at the hunters' feet.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 157
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, 20th
February.—“Man and boy,” said the
MEMBER FOR SARK, “I have been in
the House of Commons forty years.
Have witnessed many cases of alleged
breach of privilege, beginning with one
in which CHARLEs LEWIs had the
publishers of The Times and Daily
News haled to the Bar on a charge of
publishing evidence given before a
Select Committee upstairs. When
they appeared the House didn't know
what to do with them. After awk-
ward interval the culprits were, in
effect, begged to go quietly away,
which, being fortunately persons of
amiable disposition, they presently
did. With this almost unique experi-
ence I solemnly declare I have never
seen the House come out of breach of
privilege case without loss of whatever
may up to date have stood to its
credit.”
GINNELL affair no exception to rule.
IAN MALcoLM all right from his point
of view in bringing obscure case under
the fierce light that beats upon the
SPEAKER's Chair. Been out of Parlia-
ment for some years. Just back. Must
make up for lost time.
But see what comes of his activity.
WEDGwood, who wrote the obnoxious
letter which GINNELL made haste to
publish in an obscure Irish road-side
paper, rides off with flying colours.
If at risk of his own life he had saved
the SPEAKER's, he could not have been
more heartily cheered than he was
when he read out retractation of the
offensive letter and apology for send-
ing it. Never through parliamentary
career has been made so much of.
As for GINNELL, his luck passed
bounds of wildest expectation. On
opening day of Session he gained
opportunity of delivering long speech
unfettered by authority in the Chair.
That was the prize of his own ingenuity
and originality. Repetition not possible
until there be fresh election of Speaker,
when we shall probably have half-a-
dozen long-suffering cranks taking it
out of helpless House. And here, pro-
vided by the vigilance of IAN MALcol M,
was another chance of repeating, with
slight variation, the indictment of the
SPEAKER framed and delivered on day
of election.
Out came the old manuscript written
on fly-sheets of private correspondence.
The reading made more embarrassing
by interlined alterations, suiting speech
to altered circumstances. The House,
with business of Session before it,
fumed and fretted. GINNELL spared
them not a sentence, not a phrase.

King Henry (Mr. REDMoND) relies on his dear Cardinal (Mr. Asquith) to push through
that little matter of the State Divorce with the least possible delay.
Apologise to the Chair? Not he. On
the contrary, safe in knowledge of
magnanimity of SPEAKER unwilling to
take advantage of his authority to
close the mouth of a personal accuser,
GINNELL reiterated with emphasis the
specific charges out of which the whole
wretched business grew. In the end
got off with a week's holiday, and the
pleased satisfaction of having loomed
large on the most commanding stage
in the world, delaying public business
by an hour and a half, and obtaining
in the newspapers columns of ad-
vertisement whose united length would
encircle St. Paul's Dome an indefinite
number of times.
Of all events in public life Lord
MELBourNE's profound suggestion,
“Can't you leave it alone?” applies
most closely to cases on which are
based charges of breach of privilege.
Business done. — Remains of last
year's Budget disinterred and further
considered.
Monday, Feb. 27.—Government
approaching fourth week of the new
Session. Have had their ups and
downs. Most tornadic reverse was
revolt of Mr. PICKERSGILL. Catas-
trophe happened on proposal to take
time of private Members up to Easter
in order to shove Parliament Bill along.
This too much for PICKERSGILL. In
spite of all temptation still an unofficial
Member. Just a simple, loyal unit of
the Party, constrained now to come
forward and wave red flag in dazed
eyes of Treasury Bench.
His speech rather a mixed argument.
Sacrifice of private Members made last
year was, he said, fruitful only in lead-
ing to Dissolution. Ministers drawing
salaries of £5,000 a year—“paid quar-
terly,” added PICKERSGILL in tragic tone
that plumbed depth of this enormity
— might face cost of Election with
cheerful countenance. But it was an
intolerable strain upon resources of
impecunious private Members who had
lost their inheritance of balloting for
precedence before Easter.
In same delightfully inconsequential
fashion, P. confessed that what pricked
him to the core was what he called
“bringing into existence a new class
of parliamentary private secretaries.”
Every Minister, every Sub-Minister,
every Deputy Sub-Minister had his
private secretary. As for WINSTON, he,
with characteristic exuberance, “had
two Members of Parliament dancing
attendance upon him.”
“My constituents at Bethnal Green,”
cried P. in final flood of tumultuous
eloquence, “have not sent me to the

[MARCH 1, 1911.
House of Commons for over twenty
years to be a mere voting machine or
to speak only with the kind permission
of the Government licenser.”
Suborned Members on Ministerial
side tittered. Conservative Party sitting
opposite profoundly impressed. PICK-
ERsgill, claimed to be the champion of
class of legislators doomed to destruction
by arrogance of impetuous PREMIER.
He was the Last of the Mohicans
representing the independent private
Member. Is certainly the last repre-
sentative of one peculiar type, being
only man left to us who, turning body
from side to side as if fixed on swivel,
personally addresses sections of
audience to left and right. Only sur.
viving Member who shakes a warning
forefinger at the Chair, who with up-
lifted voice gives full pronunciation to
every preposition and prefaces every
third sentence with direct address to
“Mr. SPEAKER.”
Crowning charm of pretty scene was
attitude of Party opposite. Time was
when they somewhat unkindly made
PickFRSGILL their butt, ironically
applauding his strident speech. Now
a murmur of sympathy occasionally
broken by sharp cheer encouraged the
mutineer. WINTERTON, rising to follow
him in debate, was at the outset almost
speechless with emotion, and with
cambric handkerchief dried a preli-
minary tear. -
Against this Ministerial rebuff must
be set the hard-won triumph of
MACKINNoN Wood. As representative
of Foreign Office in the Commons
he was challenged by the WEARIsoME
WEDGwood to ask whether a member
of the British Embassy “was allowed
to be present at the trial of Dr.
Kotoku and his wife in Tokio" upon
a charge of conspiracy. The UNDER-
SECRETARY, pulling himself together,
made a gallant attempt to pronounce
the name of the Doctor. He would
probably have succeeded had it not
been associated, five words later,
with the capital of Japan. Anyone
who does not realise the difficulty
| of pronouncing the name Kotoku,
immediately followed by reference to
Tokio, in the hearing of a crowded
critical Assembly, will do well to make
the attempt in the privacy of his room.
MACKINNoN Wood, conscious of the
diſliculty, rather rushed the first name,
adding an unauthorised syllable or two
to its sufficient number. This naturally
brought him up breathless at Tokio.
The combined vocal effort resulted in
something between a cough and a
sneeze. 13ut it is a poor spirit that
accepts deſeat on first attempt. For a
second time in the course of his reply
refer to Dr. Kotoku and his wife in
Tokio. The House, now thoroughly
interested, watched and listened in-
tently. Coming slowly up to the
scratch, instinctively indrawing his
breath as is the habit of the Japanese
in moments of excitement, he worked
off every syllable and resumed his seat
amid a hearty cheer.
Another notable incident crowded
into the first three weeks of the Session
was the exposure by Mr. LANSBURY of
the habits of the working classes in
respect of early marriages. Contributed
the information in course of debate on
subject of the unemployed.
“Some hon. gentlemen,” he said,
“seem to forget how these people are
manufactured. I wonder how the
hon. gentleman"—he was alluding to
ARTHUR WILSON.—“ or myself would
have felt if at twelve years of age we
had been pitchforked out of a job and
had wandered about for several months
unable to get work of any kind,
perhaps with a wife and child at home
starving.”
This picture of ARTHUR WILsoN and
the newly-elected Member for Bow and
Bromley wandering about in petticoats,
weighed down by ineffectual sorrow
for a fireless breadless home, peopled
by wife and child, deeply touched an
Assembly which with all its short-
comings is ever susceptible to human
sympathy.
A BURNING GRIEVANCE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I have openly
announced my intention of writing to
the papers on the point, and you are
the papers. Quit fooling and attend.
I write from the Inner Temple
Library, where much against my will
I am surrounded by men opening and
shutting books, scratching their heads,
looking up the law, and breathing
stertorously. Why then be here 2
That is what I am about to explain.
I pay a large rent for half a room of
my own, and yet I come here because
I like to be near a nice fire. It is not
that I am niggardly. Indeed, but for
good and substantial reasons, I should
now be sitting in my half-room, heap-
ing on coal with a lavish hand and
watching it burn with an ungrudging
eye—for my rent includes coal, free.
The good and substantial reasons
are the Other Half and a universal
truth. The latter is that, of the
100,000,001 inhabitants of the civilised
world, only one can stoke a fire pro-
perly and that is oneself. (You say
that is a trite apothegm. Confessing
that I don't know what an apothegm
is and remarking that it has a nasty
the UNDER-SECRETARY had occasion to isound, I pass on.) The Other Half is
a man, like myself, at the beginning of
things; the sort of fellow who will,
as I shall, go mad when he sees a brief
with his own name on it. Charming
in every way and ever furnished with
a pouch of the best tobacco, which he
leaves forgetfully on the common table,
he can be loved entirely, except . . .
yes, he is one of the 100,000,001.
Now in this room of ours there is a
fireplace. Some happy charwoman,
with none to dispute her ability or
harass her performance, sets it going
in the morning, and we arrive be-
times to enjoy the warmth as long
as it lasts. There comes a moment,
about noon, when we are waked up by
the cold and someone must attend to
the fire. Other Half, though normally
confident of his unique skill in the
matter of fire-stoking, forgets all about
it till I approach stealthily to put a
shovelful on. I am allowed to get as
far as this in my operation simply be-
cause even he has not the face to say
I am doing it wrong when I am not
doing it at all. But I have only just
begun when he gets up, as one con-
ferring a favour, and says it will be
all right, he will see to it.
“Don't you trouble, old man,” I say.
“It is no trouble,” he says, “and it
will make your hands dirty.”
“They are dirty already, and look
better so. I don't mind doing it.”
“Nor do I,” he answers.
“I like it.”
“So do I,” and at last we are at the
truth.
Then the trouble begins in the shape
of an argument. We being profes-
sional disputants, and I being armed
with a shovel, a settlement is only
come to after a long while, and a con-
clusion arrived at never. Meanwhile
the fire (wondering why) has gone out,
and we return to it to find a few ashes
lying shivering in the grate. I then go
to the Library to write to the papers,
and he goes to the Common Room to
read them, and that is our grievance.
If you are curious to learn how the
affair ends, you may know that I am
now going to lunch and shall after that
return to this room of ours. The
absence of fire we shall regard with
indifference, for in the cupboard, marked
“Stationery,” there are weapons and
armour, and I and Other Half will
keep ourselves warm during the aſter-
noon, as is our wont, with the Single-
stick. For, your Honour, the practice
of the Law is as varied as it is exacting.
“Victor Trumper, once more his triumphant
self, fell short of a century by three figures
only.”—Sheffield Daily Telegraph.
There's nothing in that. We have
often done it.

[“I am a great singer,” CARUso is reported to have said, “because
I have always remained a bachdor. No man can sing unless he smiles,
and I should never smile if I married."]
HIs age was forty, his name was White;
He sang all day and he sang all night.
He wore on his face, to improve his style,
A terrible twist which he called a smile.
Her name was Kate (though she called it “Kite,”)
She sang all day and she sang all night.
And her face was marred by a similar smile,
Which curved at the ends and stretched for a mile.
He lived in the basement, she under the light,
And the neighbourhood found them a positive blight.
For the singing alone had disturbed their bile
Or ever they knew of the permanent smile.
“We comfort ourselves,” they were wont to write,
“By the thought that your bark may be worse than
your bite.”
But they changed their minds and their words were
vile
When they first beheld the Carusial smile.
They tried by persuasion, they tried by fright,
They tried with their main, they tried with their might;
They tried by duress, they tried by guile,
But they could not get rid of the song or the smile.
Each answered so often, it grew to be trite:
“I must be great and I cannot be quite,
Unless I am happy. Accordingly, I'll
Never, no never abandon my smile.”
WELL-BRED NOTES.
The Daily Mail having given The Standard such a
lift by urging the consumption of “Standard Bread” on
the whole community, The Standard with perfect journalistic
courtesy is proposing to lend the full weight of its
influence to a scheme for adding to the various new staves
of life a “Whole Mail Loaf" that in nutriment and
purity goes far beyond even Sir Oswald BRIERLEY's famous
lump of dough.
Meanwhile all the papers are considering the advisability
of adding a form of bread to their other attractions.
Thus The Daily Telegraph purposes to issue gratis to
every subscriber a peculiarly succulent comestible to be
known as the “D. Tea cake,” which, it is anticipated, will
enormously increase its circulation.
The proprietors of The Morning Post will provide their
clientèle with a constant supply of “Bathurst Buns" of a
most salubrious and stimulating character.
Lastly, The Spectator, always the true friend of the
canine tribe, will in future give away a pound of dog
biscuits with each copy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“MR. JARVIS.”
OLD Pretenders, like the measles,
are just now in our midst. These
epidemics occur from time to time in
the theatrical world. Now it is the
NELL Gwynn E bacillus, and now the
Musketeers microbe. I would not
think of saying that one theatre catches
the complaint from another; simply,
| the thing is in the air. No doubt
Messrs. LEoN Lion and MALCOLM
CHERRY had conceived the idea of
adapting BETH ELLIs’s “Madam, will
you walk 2" long before they knew
that Mr. MASON proposed to bring out
an Old Pretender play on the lines of
his romance of Clementina. But any-
how there are at this moment two
JAMIEs in the field.
Charles Lebrun, a penniless adven-
turer who happens to have a face the
very image of the King's over the
water, turns up in England. The
MARLBoRough party, who are out of
Court favour, see a chance of utilising
this speaking resemblance to damage the
MASHAM-BoLINBROKE clique, who are
the happy recipients of QUEEN ANNE's
bounty, by extracting from them a
written proof of their sympathy with
the cause of the Pretender. Lebrum
shall be Sarah Marlborough's tool at
the price of a few hundred crowns. So
he is wigged and dressed for the part,
and lodged at the house of Lady
Margaret Beauchamp, a staunch and
fascinating Jacobite. Bolinbroke duly
commits himself on paper, but grows
suspicious when he receives a com-
munication from the actual JAMEs, who,
not being a bird, cannot be on both
sides of the water at once. Mean-
while, Lebrun, like everybody else
who sets eyes on her, has fallen in love
with Lady Margaret; and she, adoring
him first as her King, has in the end
come to care for him on his own
account as a man and a charmer. He
confesses his imposture, and for the sake
of her and her cause would tear up the
compromising documents if he were
not under promise to hand them over
to Sarah's man, Captain Drummond.
Lady Margaret's guardian offers to
ruake a present of her to Lebrun if he will
destroy the papers, but he is resolute
to keep his word. Finally, the hitch
is cleared by Drummond himself, who
in a spasm of nobility burns them and
leaves Lebrun free to take the lady
to his arms.
Here is pretty matter for a costume
play, and, if your head is not asking
for subtleties or your heart to have its
strings set quivering, you will find good
entertainment at Wyndham's. For,
on its lighter side, Mr. Jarvis is well
enough, and the plot itself is handled
with economy and a deftness which
leaves you in doubt to the last. But
the central character, Lebrun, is not
perfectly adapted to the methods of that
delightful actor, Mr. GERALD DU
MAURIER. Admirable in his assumption
of kingship and excellent in his casual
revelations of the impostor's own
personality, he is less happy when he
comes to grips with the sterner stuff
of romance. Perhaps it is that his
voice lacks depth and variety of tone.
Or, possibly, when you have been
making pretence to be a Pretender, you
are not in the best mood for emotional
sincerity. Anyhow, Mr. DU MAURIER
did not quite impose upon me as a
desperate lover, or, indeed, as being
desperately in earnest about anything.
He did not even trouble to rap out his

parbleus and morbleus and sapristis
with conviction. Still, it was a very
attractive performance.
Miss BRANDON THOMAs was a charm-
ing Lady Margaret, with manners as
pretty as her frocks. Apart from the
right carriage of some very pictur-
esque costumes, no great demands were
put upon the rest of a workmanlike
cast; but I should have liked to see
more of Miss HENRIETTA WATson, who
made a brave and virile Sarah; and of
Mr. MARSH ALLEN, who, in the person
of that gay Irishman, Lord Peter Wild-
more, might well have been allowed a
larger scope for his pleasantries.
Indeed, in exchange for a better
acquaintance with these two characters,
I could comfortably have dispensed
with some of the incessant hand-
kissing, fond as I am of seeing this
manoeuvre neatly executed.
My only other complaint—for I am
easily pleased—is that the movement
should have been so rapid and intricate
at the start—always a mistake with
an historical theme, and peculiarly
dangerous when you are expounding
the annals of its own race to an audience
notoriously shaky on such matters.
I should like to add that on the night
when I assisted at the performance of
Mr. Jarvis the Safety Curtain was
lowered twice; but I have not allowed
this fact to influence my judgment,
O. S.
A RESOLUTION.
[“In addition to the spread of vulgarisms and
other word-saving resorts, we are now warned
of the increasing evidence of the collapse of
descriptive power. Objection is taken to the
frequency with which people wind up their
efforts at coherence with “and all that sort of
thing.”—Lady's Pictorial.]
Touché! You hit me shrewdly;
Mine, I confess, the vice.
I too have spoken vulgarly (I don't
mean rudely)
More times than once or twice.
Phrases like “jolly rotten,”
Or worse, as “howling frost,”
Words roughly wrenched to other
meanings, such as “cotton,”
Or “damage” (meaning “cost”);-
These have I glibly uttered.
I shouldn't have spoken so;
Better—though beastly painful—had
I paused and stuttered,
And so on, don't you know?
Touché ! I am a sinner
(Or have been, in the past);
Yes, my descriptive efforts
thin and thinner,
And petered out at last.
I take to heart the warning;
Henceforward, as it ought,
My speech shall be a chastened
eloquence, adorning
A reasoned flow of thought.
ve got
By self-imposed restriction
I'll check the faults which spring
So plenteously from incoherence,
slangy diction,
And all that sort of thing.

AN ENGLISHMAN'S HOME.
[The women of Switzerland are petitioning the Government not to
grant any more half-holidavs because, when their husbands come home
º they do not know what to do with themselves and are a nuisance
in the house.]
WHEN they closed the office early, honouring the KING or
QUEEN,
I would fly to Little Girlie and my cot at Golder's Green;
Swiftly 2 Lightning wasn't in it ! Newly wedded, would
I miss
E’en the fraction of a minute of my sweet domestic bliss?
Gladly Girlie used to greet me, with a hammer in her hand,
“Edwin, dear, the pictures beat me! On the steps I cannot
stand. -
Twice the naughty hammer lighted on your Girlie's little
thumb;
Edwin, I am so excited that my ownest own has come.”
Then we sought our occupations. On a chair my Girlie sat
And directed operations—kept me doing this and that:
And she passed severest strictures on my hand and on my
eye
As I hung askew the pictures, as I made the plaster fly.
When the feast of good St. Michael warned that summer
joys must cease,
She would bid me clean her cycle, coating it with wintry
grease;
And I toiled for hours together, vaselining spokes and rims,
With a rag and chamois leather, till I ached in all my
limbs.
When there came upon the tapis first a lass and then
a lad,
Girlie used to make them happy at the thought of tea with
Dad:
And as I was fingered jammily by adhesive little cubs
Girlie used to leave her family for an evening at her clubs.
When they close the office early, honouring the KING or
QUEEN,
Do I fly to Little Girlie and my cot at Golder's Green,
Or when in their eager numbers all my fellow-clerks have
fled, -
Do I prosecute my slumbers in my office chair instead?
“Here is a true story, says The Sporting Chronicle, regarding
J. A. King, the Yorkshire forward. As is well-known, the young
farmer was about the most prominent man on the field in the last of
the Trial Matches at Twickenham, and 'Played, King l’ ‘Well done,
King !’ were frequent shouts from the stand.”—Edinburgh Evening
Dispatch.
Yes, that is the end of the story. Good, isn't it? If
your friend wants another, let him try this one:—
“A rather long-winded preacher's little boy was taken to the service
on Sunday night. During the long sermon he fell asleep, and when he
a woke his father was still preaching.”—Evening News.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
NoT so long ago, the “love-story" used to be regarded
as the most popular type of fiction; but if things go on as
they are going we shall have to coin a new title, and salute
the triumph of the “hate-story.” This at least is what I
thought after reading Mr. HUGH WALPoDE's most powerful
(and depressing) novel, Mr. Perrin and Mr. Trail (MILLs
AND Boon). The tale, an apparently simple one of the lives
of certain masters in a third-rate public school, their intrigues
and jealousies, and the general way in which they get on one
another's nerves, is finely told. The protagonists are Perrin,
the warped product of twenty years at Moffat's, under
conditions which Mr. WALPoDE lashes with merciless
severity, and Trail, whose arrival brings about by force of
contrast the tragedy of the other's madness. Of course, one
has to grant the author his conditions; and, for my own
sonality. The most remarkable features of the letters in
this volume (almost all written to Professor HALL CHAM-
BERLAIN, though there are a few at the end to Mrs. HEARN,
very charming, but of noparticular substance) are the striking
criticism of contemporary and general literature, French in
particular, and the oscillation of the writer's views on
things oriental; he is now charmed, now disgusted, now
in despair of finding the face behind the mask, and always
his theories, whether one agrees with them or not, are
extremely interesting. I should remark in conclusion that
there is a glossary at the end of the book, so that even
such sentences as “The Koto-shiro-mushi-no-kami of
Miomoseki is the great Deity of the hyakusto-no-jin,” ought
not to alarm the energetic reader. -
Does Miss MARJoRIE BowFN still regard herself as a
beginner, in spite (it is said without offence) of her
precocious success? If so, Defender of the Faith (METHUEN)
part, I am aware of a doubt whether these are quite honestly may be readily and heartily commended. History supplies
the plot and spares the
typical, or whether any
body of schoolmasters
(and I have known
many) was ever quite so
collectively neurotic as
the staff at Moffat's.
But the art of Mr. WAL-| Rºº?
PoDE's treatment is un-| H
deniable. He has the gift
of writing largely about
little things, which en-
ables him to make out
of this sordid quarrel of
two overstrained men
about a borrowed um-| |z23
brella a drama full of
pity and terror. The
grim strength of the
last few chapters is at
times almost overpower-
ing, and the book alto-

reader with weak nerves.

the charge of sacrificing his artistic conscience to the

the weak spot in a clever and original story.
Those who were accustomed to regard the writer of
Japan; an Attempt at an Appreciation as a fantastic,
wholly orientalised, if not slightly improper person, will
(I hope) be agreeably disappointed by The Japanese Letters
of Lafcadio Hearn (CONSTABLE). The editress of this book,
ELIZABETH BISLAND, claims for it, as is usual with the
compilers of correspondence, that it affords a true insight
into the character of the man, and in any case, I suppose,
it would have challenged comparison with the letters of
R. L. STEVENSON from Samoa, since to both these men the
artistry of words was a passion, to HEARN almost an
idolatry (there is a very striking passage where he explains
how even the alphabet has for him colours and human
faces); both were invalids, both exiles, and both to a large
extent identified themselves with the land of their adoption.
And if we fail altogether to find in HEARN that exuberant
boyishness and gaiety which made the letters from Tusitala
so attractive, we are none the less forced to admit a very
imaginative, very likeable, and withal a very sane per-
maturity alone and from no effort of youthful perseverance,
that subtlety which enables the artist to conceal his
art and make his characters inevitably alive. At the
beginning that is not yet to be expected, but if Miss
BowFN is to be considered as at her zenith then its absence
is a fault. If this is a promise of greater things to come,
there is reason for congratulation; if the final product by
which she shall be judged, then, alas! that so fair a flower
of genius should have been spoilt by a premature blooming.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE.

But if we've plumbed not the depths, and the grand ages
Rule us, when Woad was the “dernier cri"
(Saved by a soupçon of buckles and bandages),
Then—and then only—give ear to my plea.
Broaden the lines of our “chapeau's" concavity,
Large as a tent for a bather's retreat;
There let the prey of your modish depravity
Shelter her shame from the curious street.

TO THE LATE NOAH WEESTER.
[In honour of the new and superb edition of his le icon, lately issued
by Messrs. BELL AND SoNs, of London, and the MERRIAM Co., of Spring-
field. Mass.] -
This weighty structure—one stone one, or more—
Full as an egg of meat, and very showy,
Yea, packed with such a variegated store
As filled the hulk in which that other Nof,
With SHEM and HAM, et cetera, made his mark
(That is to say, The Ark),
In wealth of illustrations fairly dims
The luminous past. Four hundred extra pages,
A trebled stock-in-trade of Synonyms,
And several new “Fictitious Personages,”
Conspire to make the sort of wedding gift
No thief could hope to lift.
WEBSTER, you should be here, right here, to-day,
Snatching an idle hour from realms of Fairy,
To mark your Eagle, strangely proud and gay,
Smile on your devastating Dictionary—
That fowl for which the earth supplies no mate
(See opening coloured plate).
What if the firm of BELL of London (Eng.)
Upon the volume which I here review sets
Its imprimatur, sharing this great fling
With Messrs. MERRIAM of Massachusetts?
Initially, old man, the rightful praise
Is yours and U.S.A.'s.
And, though Columbia calls your teeming tome
“The International,” she don't repent her
Of fashions fixed in that New England home
That was your theater (sic), your working center;
Still where your “Unabridged" began to sell
They own your ancient spell.
Yet Time has changed a lot, omniscient Sir.
Some things that to our vulgar vision lie plain
Had never had occasion to occur
Within your knowledge—sample I., the Biplane;
In those far days they simply ran to kites, -
The local WILBUR WRIGHTS.
The biograph, the motor-bus, the ski,
The tube, the tubal lift, the fleet Marconi,
Were still undreamed in your philosophy,
Contemporaneous with the tyrant Box Ey;
And yet on these our daily souls are fed—
On these, and Standard Bread.
Microbes, again—you never heard the term.
The larger monsters, such as Megatherium,
Engaged a fancy still untaught to squirm
At lesser fauna like the slim Bacterium ;
Nor yet did table-topics, ere you passed,
Include the Scleroblast.
Thus Science ruthlessly extends her range.
One lives and learns; let's hope one dies and learns too;
For I should loathe to think you cannot change,
That all in vain your cabined spirit yearns to
Pick up fresh wrinkles from the Book of Fame,
Noż, that bears your name. O. S.

THE LUCKY MONTH.
“KNow thyself,” said the old Greek
motto. (In Greek—but this is an
English paper.) So I bought a little
red book called, tersely enough, Were
you born in January 2 . I was ; and,
reassured on this point, the author told
me all about myself. -
For the most part he told me nothing
new. “You are,” he said in effect,
“good-tempered, courageous, ambitious,
loyal, quick to resent wrong, an excel.
lent raconteur, and a leader of men."
True. “Generous to a fault"—(Yes, I
was overdoing that rather)—“you have
a ready sympathy with the distressed.
People born in this month will always
keep their promises.” And so on.
There was no doubt that the author
had the idea all right. Even when he
went on to warn us of our weaknesses
he maintained the correctnote. “People
born in January,” he said, “must be
on their guard against working too
strenuously. Their extraordinarily
active brains Well, you see
what he means. It is a fault perhaps,
and I shall be more careful in future.
Mind, I do not take offence with him
for calling my attention to it. In fact,
my only objection to the book is its
surface application to all the people
who were born in January. There
should have been more distinction
made between me and the rabble.
I have said that he told me little that
was new. In one matter, however, he
did open my eyes. He introduced me
to an aspect of myself entirely un-
suspected. s
“They,” he said–meaning me," have
unusual business capacity, and are
destined to be leaders in great com-
mercial enterprises.”
One gets at times these flashes of
self-revelation. In an instant I realised
how wasted my life had been ; in an
instant I resolved that here and now
I would put my great gifts to their proper
uses. I would be a leader in an immense
commercial enterprise. - - -
One cannot start commercial enter-
prises without capital. The first thing
was to determine the exact nature of my
balance at the bank. This was a matter
for the bank to arrange, and I drove
there rapidly.
“Good morning,” I said to the cashier.
“I am in rather a hurry. May I have
my pass bock 2"
He assented and retired. After an
interminable wait, during which many
psychological moments for commercial
enterprise must have lapsed, he returned.
“I think you have it,” he said shortly.
“Thank you," I replied, and drove
rapidly home again.
A lengthy search followed; but after
an hour of it one of those white-hot
flashes of thought, such as only occur
to the natural business genius, seared
my mind and sent me post-haste to the
bank again.
“After all,” I said to the cashier, “I
only want to know my balance. What
is it 2 ''
He withdrew and gave himself up
to calculation. T paced the floor im-
patiently. Opportunities were slipping
by. At last he pushed a slip of paper
across at me. My balance
It was in four figures. Unfortunately
two of them were shillings and pence.
Still, there was a matter of fifty pounds
odd as well, and fortunes have been
built up on less.
Out in the street I had a moment's
pause. Hitherto I had regarded my com-
mercial enterprise in the bulk, as a
finished monument of industry; the
little niggling preliminary details had
not come up for consideration. Just
for a second I wondered how to begin.
Only for a second. An unsuspected
talent which has long lain dormant
needs, when waked, a second or so to
turn round in. At the end of that time
I had made up my mind. I knew
exactly what I would do.
up my solicitor.
“Hallo, is that you? Yes, this is me.
What? Yes, awfully, thanks. How
are you? Good. Look here, come and
lunch with me. What 2 No, at once.
Good-bye.”
Business, particularly that sort of
commercial enterprise to which I had
now decided to lend my genius, can
only be discussed properly over a cigar.
During the meal itself my solicitor and
I indulged in the ordinary small-talk of
the pleasure-loving world.
“You’re looking very fit,” said my
solicitor. “No, not fat, fit.”
“You don't think I'm looking thin?”
I asked anxiously. “People are warn-
ing me that I may be overdoing it
rather. They tell me that I must
be seriously on my guard against brain
strain.”
“I suppose they think you oughtn't
to strain it too suddenly,” said my
solicitor. Though he is now a solicitor
he was once just an ordinary boy like
the rest of us, and it was in those
days that he acquired the habit of
being rude to me, a habit he has never
quite forgotten.
“What is an onyx 2" I said, chang.
ing the conversation.
“Why?” asked my solicitor, with
his usual business acumen.
“Well, I was practically certain
that I had seen one in the Zoo, in the
reptile house, but I have just lea: nt
that it is yny lucky month stone.
Naturally I want to get one.”
I would ring
The coffee came and we settled
down to commerce. --
“I was just going to ask you,” said
my solicitor—“have you any money
lying idle at the bank 2 Because if
so—” - :
“Whatever else it is doing, it isn't
lying idle,” I protested. “I was at the
bank to-day, and there were men
chivying it about with shovels all the
time.”
“Well, how much have you got?” .
“About fifty pounds.”
“It ought to be more than that.”
“That's what I say, but you ! now
hat banks are. Actual merit counts
for nothing with them.”
“Well, what did you want to do
with it 2 '' º
“Exactly. That was why I rang you
up. I–er This was really my
moment, but somehow I was not quite
ready to seize it. My vast commercial
enterprise still lacked a few trifling
details. “Er—I—well, it's like that.”
“I might get you a few ground
rents.” -
“Don’t. I shouldn't know where
to put them.” -
“But if you really have fifty pounds
simply lying idle I wish you'd lend
it to me for a bit. I'm confoundedly
hard up.” - -
(“Generous to a fault, you have a ready
sympathy with the distressed.” Dash
it, what could I do?)
“Is it quite etiquette for clients to
lend solicitors money?” I asked. “I
thought it was always solicitors who
had to lend it to clients. If I must,
I'd rather lend it to you—I mean, I'd
dislike it less—as to the old friend of
me cheildhood.” -
“Yes, that's how I wanted to pay it
back.” - -
“Bother. Then I'll send you a cheque
to-night,” I sighed.
And that 's where we are at the
moment. “People born in this month
always keep their promises.” The money
has got to go to-night. If I hadn't
been born in January I shouldn't be
sending it; I certainly shouldn't have
promised it; I shouldn't even have
known that I had it. Sometimes I
almost wish that I had been born in
one of the decent months. March, say.

| THE ADVANCE OF ASQUITH.
| (With acknowledgments to Mr. T. P.
O'Connor, M.P.)
It has been suggested in some quarters
that in my articles on LLoyd GEORGE
and WINSTON CHURCHILL in The
Chronicle I have exhausted the re-
sources of eulogy as applicable to states-
men of the day. I am glad to think
that I am not only able but proud to
complete these lauds of the living with
an even more terrific explosion of super-
fatted panegyric.
HERBERT HENRY Asquith, for of him
I propose to write to-day, was a wonder-
ful boy. But as he was even more
wonderful as a boy than CHATTERTON,
|so was he more prodigious as a child
than MozART or PADEREwski. Helisped,
in faultless elegiacs, and on his second
birthday repeated the paradigm of
rūrra, without a single fault. At the
City of London School he swept the
board of prizes, including those for
exemplary conduct,tidiness,and classical
dancing. And yet in the midst of it all,
behind that front of light-hearted gaiety.
and those sweet star-like eyes, his
profound mind was already working out
the colossal scheme destined to paralyse
feudalism and accelerate the march of
triumphant democracy. . .
I shall never forget our first meeting.
It was at Oxford, where I had been
asked to address the Union on the Gospel
of Love in Personal Journalism. I was
terribly overworked just then, having to
finish my Lives of the Oil Kings against
time, and though I spoke with fervour
-there was a chilly detachment about
those superb young barbarians that
affected me sadly, . I was on the point
of bursting into tears when a brilliantly
handsome freshman, who was sitting in
the gallery, cried out in trumpet tones,
“Good old Tay Pay!” The effect was
simply electrical. My fatigue and
nervousness vanished as if by magic;
from that point I held the whole house
in the hollow of my hand, and after the
debate they carried me shoulder high to
the Mitre—no easy task even in those
days. My readers will have guessed the
identity of that trumpet-voiced fresh-
man. It was HERBERT HENRY Asquith,
who shortly afterwards took a double
first in the Classical Tripos. Next day
he invited me to breakfast with the
Master of Balliol, dear simple old
BENJAMIN Jowett, and the ſlow of soul
ran deep and strong. We did not leave
the table till 12.30, as Asquith insisted
on reciting the whole of the Ars Poetica
|-backwards in my honour. It was a
... wonderful tour de force, and from that
day I have reckoned him amongst my
dearest friends, only less dear than Sir
“—MY Mistake.”
THOMAS LIPToN, Lord PIRRIE and Sir
ALBERT Rollit.
Asquith's industry as a journalist
and barrister was phenomenal. Though
passionately fond of dancing, he re-
fused all invitations to balls until he
took shk. Judges quailed before him
even while he was a junior. No doubt
the astonishing beauty of his profile
and the superlatively lovely timbre of
his voice had much to say to it. As
GEORGE ELIOT once said to me, “There
has been no profile like Asquith's since
the days of DANTE.” As for his voice—
I have drunk in the golden glory of
MARio, the cherubic rapture of ALBoNI,
the stentorian ecstasy of LABLACHE, but
they were a mere jejune jangle compared
to the cosmic majesty of Asquith's in-
comparable organ. But the magnetism
of a gorgeous voice can effect little
unless it is backed by the compelling
force of a gigantic intellect and a great
heart. And that brings me to my final
word. Asquith has a certain super-
ficial hardness, as all great men have;
but it is hardness with immense soft-
ness combined; and the softness of his
heart is only equalled by his passion-
ate sense of justice, his transcendent
generosity, and his perfectly appalling
unselfishness. It is dreadfully painful
to me to say all this, because he is the
most modest of men, and anything that
borders, however remotely, on the ful-
some is gall and wormwood to me.
But, remembering the magnificent cou-
rage of those friendly words of good
cheer launched from his fearless lips in
the good old Oxford Union, without a
ualm I have plunged baldheaded up to
the neck in the mid-stream of oleaginous
adulation.

NOT CRICKET.
THE SCANDALous AFFAIR OF MY UMBRELLA.
It was no article of costly make,
Fashioned of silk and ebony and gold
(The kind that careless men are apt to take),
It was not even very neatly rolled.
Still it was my ewe lamb. And when I found
The place untenanted where erst it stood
I told my sorrow to the wainscot round,
I said some things that nearly warped the wood.
I cried aloud to the Olympian gods
And all the shadowy powers that rule the air
To punish him that did this deed with rods—
I also spoke to the commissionaire.
I said, “This was the apple of my eye, - t
Bought when a boyish heart was clean of doubt;
I loved the little windows where the sky -
Came peeping through when it was opened out.
To some their silken hats are dear, to some
Their overcoats of astrakhan or fur,
To me my ombriſuge, my childhood's chum.
He said, “I will inquire about it, Sir.”
Alas! I have no hopes. But this, oh this,
Is what annoys me most about the thing:

The well-known handle, the familiar spring,

Whate'er might be the chances of the change,
Whatever substituted gamp I bore,
Chill to the grasp, and comfortless and strange,
In value I was simply bound to score.
Some elder poet, fired with heavenly flame,
Might leave his thyrsus with the gilded knob,
And brandish mine unconscious till he came
Home to his flat and then be vexed—the snob
Or I myself, through want of proper care,
Might fail to localise my gingham roof,
And seize some editor's of Samite rare,
Crusted with chrysoprase—and waterproof.
But now these hopes have crumbled into dust.
Cursed be the man who took beyond recall
The ancient shelter of a bardic crust,
And never brought his brolly here at all. Evoe.

STORIES FOR UNCLES.
(Being Extracts from the MSS. of a Sir-Year Niece.)
THE MAGIC SUNSET. -
I AM riting this story for my Uncle becas he is a good
man and this is a good story there wos wonce an old
wooman she was 30 or 42 yeers old and she lived by herself
in a cottage in a garden and she was very kind to evrybody
and spent a lot of munny in giving things to poor peeple
but she had nobdy to live with her and she did want a little
| baby girl or better still a prinsess to help her in the house
and mend the clothses and she orfen asked for one but she
coudent get it wich made her very sory.
One day she wos out warking in her garden and she
lookd up to the ski and wen she lookd doun agen loan
bold thir wos a Fairy about the size of up to my nee dresd

Have you cum here on purps to vist me sed the old
wooman. Yes I have sed the Fairy Ive herd your askings
till Im neerly tired of it and Im going to giv you wot you

very kind Im sure. Dont menshun it sed the Fairy but
you must worter this bit of ground day and nite for
fore days and then you shall see sumthing to make you
larf goodby. '
And wen the old wooman lookd agen the Fairy was gorn.
So she went home and fetshd her wortering pot and
worterd away like mad and the first day thir was nuthen
and the old wooman neerly gav it up but she went onn and
the secnd day up came a little wite flour on a long grin stork.
Oho sed the old wooman shes going to keep her proms
and she went on wortering and on the thurd day thir wos
nuthen more and the old wooman wos sleepier than ever
but on the foreth day loan bold thir wos the sweetis littel
baby girl in the wirld kirled up in the flour she wos no
biger than my thum and the old wooman wos very pleesd
and brort her home and tuk grate care of her.
Of corse the little girl was tu smal at ferst to help mutsh
but she very sune gru to be 9 or 10 yeers old and then she
was very usfull but she olways fellt thir was a Prinse
looking for her her name was Mabella.
Not long after this wen Mabella wos in her teens we
will say 16 yeers old she went out one evning and sat
doun on a bank when sudnly thir wos a butefull sunset

Get inside it sed and I will carre you to wunderfull plases'
So Mabella got inside and the sunset carred hir of and

Mabella got out to strech hir legs sudnly she hird the sound

Then Mabella and the prinse got inside the sunset tugether
and they sat next one anuther and torked about luv wile the
sunset wos carren them away but they left the horse behind
becas thir was no food for him and they dident wont to be
botherd with a horse.
The sunset carred them to a chirch and wen it got thir

ladders to the chirch dore and Mabella and the prinse went
doun the ladders and were marred in the chirch.
They were very hapy and sune had a large famly of 16 grone

THE POETRY OF MOTION.
THE recent discussion in The Times
on the question whether the best
poetry is designed for recitation or
for silent perusal recalls once more the
story (revived not long ago) by Mr. A.C.
BENson in The Cornhill how the late
Professor SIDGwick defied sea-sickness
by declaiming English poetry in the
secluded part of a Channel steamer, but
succumbed when asked to desist by
some lady-passengers, frightened at his
behaviour. When this remedy is more
widely known, as it certainly ought to
be, the Philistine public will perhaps
realise that there is some practical use
in versification after all. We foresee
a general desire among ocean travellers
to join the Poetry Recital Society. In
fact, the enterprising officials of this
institution are already, we hear, rigging
up a rocking platform in the club-room
for beginners to acquire their sea-legs
upon and get what they remember of
Casabianca, The Last Chantey and The
Ancient Mariner off their chests. Things
are looking quite bright, too, for minor
poets and professors of elocution. We
know of a thoroughly reliable and
seaworthy coach who is prepared
personally to conduct uncertain tourists
from Dover to Calais, or vice versa. He
guarantees immunity in the roughest
weather, holding a class on the bridge-
deck, while his pupils repeat “BARRY
CoRNwall's" well-known piece of
hypocrisy, “The sea the sea! the
open seal " There is, of course, a
slight soreness among the stewards,
who regard this panacea as likely to
imperil their vocation, but it will
doubtless wear off. Meanwhile, if cer-
tain of our amateur reciters betake
themselves to the high seas for the
purpose of testing the Sidgwickian
theory, we stay-at-homes should have
much to be thankful for.
HOW TO BECOME —
[With apologies to the ingenious con-
ductors of “Careers.”]
How To BEcoME A BATH-CHAIR MAN.
This interesting profession, which is
by no means overstocked, can best be
entered in the following way. Write
an autobiography and dedicate it to a
famous man of letters, and with the
proceeds you ought to be able to buy a
bath-chair, or even two.
How To BEcoME A BURGLAR.
How shall a man become a burglar?
It is a difficult question to answer.
Some go so far as to maintain that the
burglar is born, not made. Certain it
is that the requirements for success in
this interesting calling have become

Much depends on deportment and
education, and there are fortunately
numerous establishments in which the
high art of house-breaking is taught
with great thoroughness. At the best
known of these, the Meum and Tuum
Academy, an entrance examination is
held before the beginning of each term
for the admission of candidates. Only
those are accepted who succeed in
entering unobserved. The accepted
candidates are then divided into sec-
tions A, B and C. The course of study in
Section A is Noiseless Movement; in
Section B, Pane Removing and the use
of the Jemmy; and in Section C, the
use of the Blow-pipe for fusing Safes.

How to BEcoME AN EARL (CREATED).
It cannot be too urgently impressed
on those who aspire to Earldoms that
the Peerage is no sinecure. It is a
profession which makes a heavy
demand on strength and vitality as
well as the purse. Long hours of
attendance in the gilded chamber or
on boards in the City; the nightly
strain of frequenting fashionable res-
taurants and consuming rich and
indigestible food; constant travelling
to and from the Riviera and occasional
privations through losses at Monte
Carlo or on the Rubber market, are all
part and parcel of the Peer's life, and
all demand robust health if they are

to be faced successfully. Another point
that cannot be too often remembered
is that it is seldom possible for a
commºner, even though possessed of
boundless wealth º and a Sephardic
lineage, to become a belted Earl at one
step. Remember that there is no such
thing as a belted Baron. There are
two main ways of embarking on the
Peerage as a career:—(1) by desert;
(2) by purchase. The former is far
too precarious a method to be recom-

There is always room for a sane and
healthy antipathy to hard work and
a consistent and single-minded devotion
to futility and frivolity, if only as a
protest against the excessive strenuous-
ness of the age. We want folly to
enliven this drab world, and who is so
fit to supply this need as the thorough- |Th
paced smart-settite? Some, of course,
possess the initial advantage of starting
with an hereditary equipment of fatuity,
but in this, as in all other careers, very
few people are unable to acquire
qualifications for admission into the
ranks. -

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Exrn ACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Feb.
27—Stranger looking on from Gallery
whilst SoN AUSTEN was denouncing
Parliament Bill would never guess
that country is on eve of constitutional
revolution. Questions over, Members
streamed out through glass door to
write letters, read papers, or chat in
Lobby. At half-past eight things so
desperately bad as to suggest a count.
RONALDSHAY, on his legs supporting
amendment moved from front OppC-
sition Bench, had for sole audience
on Unionist side a Member intent on
catching SPEAKER's eye as soon as
the EARL had made an end of
speaking. Less than a dozen Minis-
terialists scattered about benches
opposite, glowing with same purpose.
As LANSBURY observed, “A revolu-
tion is proceeding and there is no one
here to stop it.”
Affair might have fizzled out in
ignominy of a count save for accident
of moment at which it was moved.
Mr. EMMOTT, temporarily relieving
SPEAKER in Chair, pointed out that
Standing Orders forbid count between
8.15 and 9.15.

elections for the seat won at last January
Wigan, rose to make his maiden speech.
Tallin figure, in aspect mild to benignity,
there was about new Member some-
thing irresistibly reminiscent of the
deacon who treads softly down the
church aisle carrying plate for collection.
Nothing the least diaconal in speech
that followed. Early in its progress
Member for Wigan, like Silas Wegg,
dropped into poetry:-
“The General Election came down like a wolf
on the fold,
The Nationalist cohorts were gleaming with
gold.”
“I don't blame them,” he added, turn-
ing benevolent countenance towards
the Irish quarter. “Having got the
sinews of war behind them, they are
in their right to use them.” After
vivid picture of LLoyd GEORGE en-
couraging growth of agitation against
the Lords, he observed, “Then it was
that we had rats in a trap. Rats in
a trap, Mr. SPEAKER, that let the cat
out of the bag—if I may say so,” he
added, after a moment's reflection.
The charge against the House of
Lords was that they had acted contrary
to precedent. “I may say with
justice,” said Mr. NEVILLE, fixing with
stern glance SECRETARY to TREASURY
left in charge of debate, “the boot is
on the other leg.”
Business dome.—Rejection of Parlia-
ment Bill on second reading moved
from Front Opposition Bench.
Tuesday.—Not in vain has TULLI-
BARDINE gone a-soldiering with the
Horse Guards, the Black Watch, the
Royals and the Scottish Horse. To-
day executed a manoeuvre which testi-
fies to military instinct, even genius.
Things looking in bad way for branch
of Legislature the Marquess will in due
time adorn. What Asquith proudly
called “the phalanx" determined to
carry Parliament Bill remains unbroken.
Appeals for compromise plaintively
raised from Opposition camp meet with
no response. As far as one can see events
are marching straight to passing of Bill
by overwhelming majority that will make
it awkward for Lords to throw it out.
Direct attack being here, as at Spion
Kop, hopeless, thing is to distract
attention by movement in another
quarter. Accordingly, whilst attention
and time of House are ostensibly con-
centrated upon fate of House of Lords,
TULLIBARDINE chips in with question
addressed to PRESIDENT OF BoARD of
TRADE. What he wants to know is
“the average annual value imported
into the United Kingdom from Canada
of laths, sawed boards, planks, deals,
and other lumber, planed, tongued,
grooved or variously finished?”
Note the subtlety of this master
stroke. Whilst it effectually withdraws
attention from a troublesome question,
giving the assailants time, “so to
speak,” as Mr. NEVILLE would put it,
to bury their dead, it shows how far-
reaching and minute are the sympathy
and knowledge of one of the class of
legislators whom an infamous act of
tyranny threatens to destroy. Whilst
professional agitators prate about here-
ditary anachronisms and the like, here
is a man who perceives the importance
of a question which, neglected, might
insidiously gnaw away the Imperial
bonds that link the Motherland with
the eldest of her Colonics.
“Full of wise saws and modern instances'
—of planed and grooved planks.
(The Marquess of Tullibardine.)
SYDNEY BUxTon, taken aback, mut-
tering something about necessity of
lengthened details, and promised to cir-
culate answer with the Votes. TULLI-
BARDINE, full of wise saws, carrying a
modern instance in shape of planed
and grooved plank, graciously assented,
and the incident closed. But its effect
was felt in subsequent course of debate
on Parliament Bill, which became in-
creasingly paralysed.
Business done. — Debate on SoN
AUSTEN's amendment continued.
House of Lords, Wednesday.—Lord
WolverHAMPTON's death leaves no
gap in the ranks of backwoodsmen.
Not one of their class. Rather the
ideal of the sober-minded business-
like recruit to whom reformers of here-
ditary chamber look for help. Curious
evolution of political life that the son
of a Wesleyan minister, thirty-five
years ago an obscure solicitor in a
Midland borough, should in course of
time come to rule India in succession
to CLIVE and HASTINGs.
One who has known him throughout
his Parliamentary life finds it difficult
to imagine HENRY Fowler (the name
by which his memory will be kept
green) going about with a coronet in

the Upper Chamber, he was essentially
a Commons man. Entering the House
thirty-one years ago next April, he
was absolutely unknown at Westmin-
ster. Highest honour yet achieved was
that he had been Mayor of Wolver-
hampton. He did not take the House
by storm, as, after brief assault, did the
ex-Mayor of another Midland town.
By sheer capacity he won his way to
front rank. Beginning by favour of
Mr. G. at foot of Ministerial ladder,
his rise to Cabinet rank was compara-
tively rapid. As a debater he was
excelled by few in the gifts of lucidity
and force of argument. -
He was one of the rare Members who
achieved the supreme triumph of con-
trolling votes by a speech. It befell
during Lord Rosebery's brief Premier-
ship. HENRY JAMEs, perceiving oppor-
tunity of smiting his old friends the
enemy on Treasury Bench, brought
forward Resolution designed to pro-
tect interests of British cottonspinners
trading with India. Government major-
ity was under forty. Not so deep as
a well nor so wide as a church door, it
would have served, as it had done before,
if it kept together. But a sufficient
number of Ministerialists representing
Lancashire cotton districts wavered.
Loyalty to Party is a good thing, but
profits in cottonspinning should, like
charity, begin at home and, as far as
Lancashire is concerned, end there.
Fate of Ministry hung in balance,
with almost certainty that it would
kick the beam in favour of Opposition.
In masterly speech delivered with
authority of SEcRETARY of STATE for
INDIA, HENRY Fowler turned threat-
ened rout into brilliant victory.
Another conspicuous success was his
conduct of Parish Councils Bill through
a House which, wherever not hostile,
was unsympathetic. A masterpiece of
adroit parliamentary management.
HENRY Fowler was a dependable
man, as distinguished from a brilliant
one. He was nearer akin to type
of STAfford Northcote and Lord
KIMBERLEY than to DisrAELI or
GLADston E. John BRight once said
of a colleague, “We believe in no man's
infallibility; but it is restful to be sure
of one man's integrity.” This a com-
fort enjoyed by all having dealing with
HENRY Fowler, whether in private
relations or in public life.

The glorious old library of Hornsey

Pre-eminent among papyri of the

eighty magnificent volumes of press-

prior to her marriage, she was a star
of our lighter stage.

majestic volumes—a veritable Walhalla

of sixty volumes is devoted to picture-

The collection of detail for this
monumental work has been the one
preoccupation of its author's life, and
he has spared himself no self-denial
in the quest of gustatory experience.
Fascinating as the whole of the six
hundred volumes are, one lingers most
over the thousands of alimentary charts
detailing the author's daily menu since
he was two months old.
Catholic in experiment, he has
sampled the cuisines of all nations in
pursuit of the ideal. Thus the ornitho-
rhyncus, the marabout, the hyena,
the chinchilla and the scone have fallen
to his fork.
Once only, at a Guildhall Banquet,
his appetite failed him and he burst
into tears.
The last volume closes on a note of
pathos. Analysing the span of human
life, the author laments that only one-
sixth of it is occupied by nutrition—the
remainder is frittered away. This,
however, is the only morbid reflection
in a work eternally hopeful with ante-
prandial speculations. --

AT THE PLAY.
“LoAves AND FISHEs.”
MR. SomeRSET MAUGHAM calls his new
play at The Duke of York’s “a satire in
four Acts”; he may be supposed there-
fore to imply a moral. It is not
difficult to discover what the moral is.
Theodore Spratte was a worldly man.
He never tired of referring to his
“father, the late Lord Chancellor,” or
to his family's supposed descent from
the Montmorency stock; he admitted
he was a snob and recommended
snobbishness as a virtue to his children.
He spared no pains or self-advertise-
ment (within gentlemanly limits) to
advance himself in his profession, and
as a widower of fifty took care to marry
again for money rather than for love.
When his daughter fancied (quite
mistakenly) that she was devoted to a
bounder who wore detachable and rever-
sible cuffs and owned unpresentable
relations, he hurried on her engagement
to Lord Wroacham by methods which
may have seemed unscrupulous, but
very certainly made for Winifred's
happiness. He practised, perhaps more
whole-heartedly than some, the usual
| insincerities of speech and manner
which a civilised society demands, and
accepted with considerable calm the
extremely pleasant and luxurious state
of life into which it had pleased Heaven
to call him.
Who will rise and curse Theodore
Spratte 2 Who will denounce vanity
and egoism and pushfulness and good
living? There are a few fine souls
who may do so, but it is not for us to
range ourselves ostentatiously among
them. Theodore Spratte, as I have
described him, may pass for an average
man. Wait a moment, though; I find
I have left out something rather
important. Theodore Spratte was Vicar
of St. Gregory's
This, I take it, is the meaning of the
play. A clergyman, inasmuch as he is
º judged by the same standards as
other men, must be different from other
men. The Church is not the same as other
professions, to beentered light-heartedly
by the younger sons. By all means
let it be denied indignantly that Canon
Spratte is typical of the Church; it
will scarcely be denied that the Church
is too frequently regarded as a means
merely of worldly advancement. It is
possible (and legitimate) to satirize all
the reverend Sprattes without satirizing
all the reverend Canons.
This is much the best of Mr.
MAUGHAM's later and successful plays;

I don't know if it is because he has
adapted it from a book, The Bishop's
Apron, written some years ago.
Recently his literary conscience has not
always been as wakeful as one could
wish; he has shown an ingenuous
confidence in the powers of the
MAUGHAM varnish to give newness to
any situation. Loaves and Fishes has
old moments, but it is for the most
part truly funny, and—thanks to a
great performance by Mr. Robert

“BARDELYs THE MAGNIFICENT.”
The vestibule and palatial salle-d-
boire of the Globe Theatre are redolent
of the triumphs of Mr. CHARLEs
FROHMAN. Here are portraits, life-
size or better, of Miss PAULINE CHAs.I.
and Miss MAUDE ADAMs, silent tributes
to what he can do in the art of
presentation. Here is a framed colla-
tion of heads, chiefly American and out
of my cognisance, to which is attached
the sounding title: “Mr. CHARLEs

solace during the intervals of Barde ys
the Magnificent. I cannot say if Mr.
LEwis WALLER aspires to join that
galaxy, but it could hardly be on the
strength of his latest achievement, even
if it had been presented by Mr. CHARLEs,
Fi on MAN, instead of being simply ad-
vertised as “by arrangement with Mr.
CHARLEs From MAN." (How difficult it is' told of to procure the necessary article' escape with ribs unwrung.
togetaway from Mr.CHARLEs FROHMAN!)
Mr. WALLER's many female admirers
have come to expect of him a reason-
able allowance of sword-play and knock-
about business. But here, apart from a
brief scuffle in the dark and a trivial
turn with a walking-stick, he is content
to wear fine clothes and talk glibly, often
perfunctorily, in a part of which he
is the first to appreciate the futility.
C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la
guerre. Even his fine clothes could not
always be accounted for. How he came
by the pleasant design in black and gold
in which he made so brave a figure I
never could make out. For he was in a
strange house, cut off from his luggage,
and had made his entrance through a
window in the course of an escapade that
had left him with nothing but the rough
and sodden garments he stood up in.
It is a poor reflection on the present
chances for an actor with a sense of
style that Mr.WILLIAM HAvilAND should
have nothing better to do than play the
villain in a second-rate Romantic Com-
edy like Bardelys the Magnificent. His
dignity of manner did all that was
possible for the part, but it was thank-
less work. Mr. REGINALD DANE as the
dandy braggadocio, Laurent, Chevalier
de St. Armand (they all had nice names
like that), succeeded in getting the savour
of his perfumes across the footlights.
Miss MADGE TITHERADGE, on the other
hand, was all for nature's scents, and kept
on sniffing roses with a conscious air
of innocence. Mr. Ashton PEARSE spoke
his lines correctly as Louis XIII., but
looked too much like a Nonconformist
Mephistopheles in mourning. The final
travesty of a Court of Justice was not
improved by the sad crudity of the
Judge's diction. The plot was passable,
and there was a beautiful scene for the
loggia of the Chateau of Lavedan; but
altogether we should have come off
badly indeed but for the humorous relief,
such as it was, of the part assigned to
Miss Lotti E VENNE, who called herself
a seventeenth-century Wiscomtesse, but
in point of fact was just that delightful
creature, Miss Lottie VENNE of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
“BABY MINE.”
Let me confess, to my shame, that I
laughed immeasurably over the not-too-
delicate humours of the new Criterion
farce. Only an American woman, type
of the pinkest of propriety, could have
written it; and only a British Censor,
representing the finest intelligence and
discrimination, could have passed it.

try and draw her husband home by the

occurs, and the husband, summoned to
his wife's bedside, arrives slightly in
advance of his supposititious offspring;

actual mother, it is found necessary
to acquire a fresh baby, and it turns up

[IN a letter to The Times on “sulking” animals, it is maintained
that “sulking is essentially a bodily and nervous condition,” and a
subsequent leader and various letters emphasize the applicability of
this statement not only to the lower animals, but to mankind, and
cspecially children.]
My little son, whom I propose to wallop
For being in a fit of sulks to-day
And acting impolitely whilst at play
Towards your cousin (bless the little trollop!)—
I know, dear boy, that you perhaps are blameless;
If one may trust the statement of the wise,
These fits of sulking probably arise
From some disorder which as yet is nameless.
Things being thus, my child (I hope you take me?)
I may be counted cruel if I go
And grip you by your roundabout, and so
Proceed to spank you till my powers forsake me.
But please observe, if bodily conditions
Are going to be cited as excuse
For faults like this, they'll simply play the deuce
With other moral laws and prohibitions.
Besides, as yet the theory is lacking
In full acceptance by the general mind;
It may in future save your tender rind,
But in the meanwhile you require a whacking.
So do not think me brutal if at present
I have to give you what, it seems, is due.
Believe me, if it causes pain to you,
I shall not find it any less unpleasant.
Regard me not as some unthinking drover
Beating a sulky, semi-fainting beast;
Believe me (once again), I'm not the least
Like such a man . . . And now, my boy, bend over !

CoNSIDERING the constancy with which Mr. EDEN
PHILLPotts lays the scenes of his stories upon Dartmoor,
it is amazing that his descriptive powers show so few signs
of the strain placed upon them. No rains were ever more
wetting than his and no winds more penetrating. In fact
Demeter's Daughter (METHUEN) proves—if such proof is
still necessary—that he is a great atmospheric artist. But
when I turn to the story itself I am not so satisfied, for it
leaves me depressed and waiting for the big novel which I
expect Mr. PHILLPoTTs eventually to write. Alison Cleave,
handicapped by a faithless husband, a brutal son and a
false neighbour, struggled hard in her fight against odds,
and in the fight revealed a noble character. But she was
beaten ; while her husband—a bibulous platitudinarian—
remained to call her a “trier" and an “awful stupid
woman.” I recognise and bow to the courage which
disdains to make sacrifices to sentimentality, but at the
same time I think that -
third of the way through, when I began to be impatient
with A Fair House (John LANE). The reason for this was
that Mr. HUGH DE SELINcourt, after being at pains to
show me the fairness of the house and to fill it with
interesting people, would persist in shutting me up in the
nursery. . What I mean is that, though Bridget herself is
a delightful child, we have, frankly speaking, a good deal
too much of her in the early stages. I was frightened for
Bridget's sake also. The only daughter of a publisher,
brought up by a conventional old nurse, and exhibiting a
marked tendency towards literary baby-talk, she seemed to
stand every chance of developing into a prig. Fortunately,
however, Mr. DE SELINcourt's skill was able to avert this
danger, and the latter part of the story shows us a Bridget
who is an entirely real and captivating human girl. The
whole episode of her relations with Selby Parramore, the
insincere genius, is most adroitly handled; though of all
the scenes in the book I prefer that of the introduction of
this same Parramore as a “marvellous boy,” long before
there is any thought of Bridget growing old enough to fall
- −1 in love with him. His
Mr. PHILLPoTTs would
be a better artist if he
painted in less gloomy
colours, and if he
allowed himself to re-
new some of the glad-
ness which permeated
The Human Boy.
Casting about, I sup-
pose, for something
more sinister and bizarre
than mere burglary, Mr.
HERBERT FLOWERDEW
(for, after all, what's in
a name?) , has seized
upon the idea of in:
corporating into a novel
one of those modern
Bluebeards who occa-
sionally figure in the
police-reports. The
interview with, and
bland patronage of, the
friendly publisher is a
thing wholly joyous.
Take it for all in all,
Mr. DE SELINcourt has
made his Fair House
into a quite desirable
property, which should
find no difficulty in
securing appreciative
tenants.

cre row - or J imitation of HENRY
FIELDING. To this end
he has omitted no
affectation of spelling,
little more food for the romantic emotions than is
usually the case with detective fiction, and the efforts
of Arthur Lawrence (alias Hermitage) to dispose of his
wife (No. 3) for the sake of her fortune, and to capture her
when she suspects his designs and refuses to live with
him, gave me some very delectable thrills. I must also
take off my hat to Mr. HERBERT FlowerDEw for creating
the most incompetent sleuth-hound that I have ever seen
nosing the trail; for though the fine specimens of the
breed are all too few, and I seldom close a book of this sort
without murmuring regretfully to myself those well-known
lines—
- “The stately Holmes of England,
How paramount he stands,”
I think for sheer bungling inefficiency Mr. Robert Clickett
took the red herring. And indeed the unfortunate heroine
would have been done to death with the greatest of ease at
the end by her dastardly spouse and his hired minion but
for one of those curious little accidents—but there! you
had better read the book for yourselves.
I have to confess that there was a moment, about a
composition, style, plot and period, and yet he has over-
come by the end all the prejudice which such anachronism
was bound to excite in the beginning. Upon my word,
I am not sure that he has not succeeded all the way.
Though The Passionate Elopement (SECKER) would not
have been so intituled by FIELDING, yet otherwise, save
for the absence of the master touch (one must say that
to be orthodox), the book might have come from that great
pen. Much of the humour and philosophy is there, but
there is happily avoided the long anticipated climax,
intolerable, and, I think, rightly intolerable, to present-day
tastes. FIELDING or no FIELDING, our author has put
together a vastly entertaining account of Curtain Wells, its
Great Little Beau, its Exquisite Mob, and its Gallant
Young Gentlemen. I doubt if he has in his conclusion
availed himself to the full of the ingenuity of his construc-
tion, but I leave it at that, insisting that you buy and read
for yourself without further revelations from me.

THE COCOA SCANDAL.
[The duty on manufactured cocoa, being proportionately in excess of
the duty on the raw material, serves to protect the home industry, and
therefore constitutes a scandal for Free Traders. A group of Liberal
Members has recently approached the CHANCELLoR with a request for
the removal of all duties on cocºa. The Daily Chronicle, while desirous
that Liberal Governments should “continue to move in the direction of
the Free Breakfast Table,” would be content for the present if the duty
on manufactured cocoa could be so readjusted as to eliminate this
protective element. The cocoa trade itself, the same authority assures
us, does not want Protection.]
SHALL it be said that we who buy and vend
That beverage which the People soak owe
Our bulging fortunes (gracious Heaven forfend )
To profits on protected cocoa 2
The thought would make our tender conscience bleed,
It would indeed.
The past, of course, is passed; the sin is sinned;
Nor can we wholly rectify it ;
But, for the future, whether loose or tinned,
Let him who takes our temperate diet
Be well assured it is for honest nibs
He pays his dibs.
Meanwhile repentance for our gains ill-got
Should seal the mouths of Tory mockers;
And we have half a mind to pour the lot
Into the Liberal Party's lockers,
And so from off our 'scutcheon wipe the stain
And start again.
The People's conscience, too, when down their neck
Flows the brown stream, incurs a fracture
To think that England puts a cruel check
On the dear alien's manufacture;
Cocoa, they claim, should have one equal law
For cooked or raw.
This is the type that ought to breakfast free.
But if the ideal cornucopia,
Sprouting with sugar, chicory and tea,
Still lurks in some far-off Utopia;
If even Liberal voters can't be fed
At nil per head;
If such a prospect shows a shade too pink—
At least we'll let our proletariat
Under the spreading Rowntree sit and drink
An unprotected commissariat ;
With conscience free, desipiant in loco
Over their cocoa.

with the Moon and got in an awfil state about it becas he
dident know wot to doo wen the Moon kept shining doun
on him evry nite and jest out of spite it wosent a harf
Moon or a quartr Moon but a fool Moon all the time witch
made it ever so werse.
One nite Ronald wos out warking with his girl frend Rose
and they were torking about the carpets for thire new house
and sudnly Rose sed wot is that and Ronald sed Im sure I
dont no and they went on and loan bold it was a pore little
star witch had falln out of the ski and hert hisself thire was
a big bump on his forrid and he was neerly ded Ronald pikt
him up and Rose gave him a pouder and he opend his eyes
and said Ware am I and wen they told him he sed he had
tripd up and falln thru a hole in the ski Ronald tuk him
home and the nex morning the dokter kame to see him and
wen he put out his tung the dokter sed he wos duin nisely
and in a fu minits more he wos quit well. Of corse the
star wos verry gratfle and promsd to do all kinds of things
for Ronald so that nite they all went for a wark tugether
and Ronald told the star about his hating the Moon.
Thats alrite sed the star I hate the Moon tu and I
think weer going to have a war agenst her sune the stars
agenst the Moon.
Wont that be fun sed Ronald.
Haha sed the star I think its jest started hark.
And wen Ronald harked he herd the sound of drums and
trumpits and canons roling round and round the ski and
Rose herd it tu.
Then sudnly a bugil bugild and the star sed thire cuming
to fetch you to help them.
Hurah cried our heero who wos verry brave and Rose
cried hurah tu and wen they lookd agen they sor a rejment
of stars warking down littel golden starstairs and the stars
came to them and srounded them thire faces were littel stars
with long gold hare and thire brests were big stars with flags
made of lite at evry point and they sluted with thire sords
and askd Ronald and Rose to cum and help them in thire
terrble battel agenst the Moon.
Certainly sed Ronald but how can we get into the ski
weer no good doun here.
Osed the Genral I can manige that pick up that long
stick orf the ground and you will find it turn into a magic
lance witch will carre you both into the ski you can take
my hand if you like.
So they tuk his hand and the magic lance carred them
-all up into the ski and in a minit they were all in the midel
of the battel.
Our heero and Rose did grate deeds of valler agenst the
Moon and all the stars were verry brave tu espeshly the
fallen star what Ronald had pikt up he wos a Kurnel and
wore a red unform with a silver helmit but at last they
were all tu menny for the Moon and wen our heero pirsed her
face with the lance she held up her sord to mean shed had
nuff and wonted piece then they put her in prism and kept
her there till she promsd to be better in futcher Sune
after this Ronald and Rose went back to the erth and held
grate feesting amung thire vassils and all the srounding
moniks came and feested with them Rose went back to
starland and livd there wen her mother dide so they were

THEORY AND PRACTICE.
“WHAT have you been doing since I
saw you last 2" asked Miss Middleton,
as she dropped lumps of sugar whought-
fully into my tea. “One, two, three,
four, five—that means she would if she
could, but she can't. I expect she's
engaged already. You'd better have
one more.” She dropped in another
lump, explained that they were large
cups, and asked her question again.
“Besides working,” she added as an
after-thought.
“I've been learning something,” I
said.
“But how brave of you ! Don't say
it's the piano. Music lessons are such
a bother.”
“No, it isn't the piano. I finished
learning that when I was a child.”
“Is it something you can show me
in here after tea 2"
I looked round the room and con-
sidered.
“There's hardly space enough here,”
I said. “Not when I'm in form. It's
golf, you know.”
“Golf! Slow back, don't press, keep
your eye on the ball. Hooray!”
“There's more in it than that,” I
remonstrated. “You’ve no idea what
a lot of golden rules they've taught me.
I’m full of maxims.”
“I’ll beat you. When will you play
me? But I expect you're awfully good
now. What's your handicap 2"
“I worked it out at thirty-seven
yesterday afternoon, but my caddie said
I was playing a good eighteen. He also
said his father was out of work and that
this was only his third round that week.
He seemed to be preparing the soil for
something. I don't think I'm really
eighteen.”
“I expect you'd beat me, anyhow.
I always get so excited when I'm play-
ing a match. I'm best at friendly
foursomes.”
“I’m best in the bedroom before the
looking-glass. When I get on the tee
my mind suddenly becomes a perfect
blank. I give a waggle or two just to
show that I know the game, and then
I lay my club-head carefully behind the
ball and leave it there while I try to
remember all the things I've been told
to do. There's something with the
body, and something with the arms, and
something with the wrists, and some-
thing with the legs, and I stand there
and think and think, and by-and-by I
remember some of them, and then I
have to concentrate on the things I've
been told not to do. Sometimes on a
very warm afternoon I stand there so
long that I go to sleep.”
“Oh, I just hit the ball as hard as
I can at once,” said Miss Middleton
confidently. “Or else miss it as hard
as I can.”
“Well, that 's what I decide to do
at last. And as I swing back, I think:
‘I know I shan't hit it, I'm doing it
all wrong, and I don't believe my left
knee is a bit like the photographs.'
And I catch a hasty glance at the left
knee as the club comes down, and say
to myself, ‘Well, I may just as well go
through with it now, and then I can
have a really good drive at the meat
tee,’ and my opponent says, “Dad
luck!' and to my great surprise the
ball lands a whole fifty yards away.”
“Eye on the ball, Sir.”
“Yes, yes, I know. I wonder if it
would id: me if I wore blinkers ?”
“Of course, the great thing,” said
Miss Middleton, “is confidence. If you
feel you're going to hit the ball——”
“Nothing has ever happened on the
previous tee to make me feel that.”
“But you must be able to hit it
sometimes, if I can.”
“Yes, I do. Quite a lot of times.
Now, in my round yesterday afternoon,
out of twenty drives from the tee—”
“Oh, is yours a twenty-hole course?”
“You don't understand. Two of my
drives were encored. Well, out of
twenty shots I got in nine good ones,
—but each one of those nine surprised
me intensely.”
“I don't think that matters. If one
isn't surprised oneself, the others
always are. I'm a bit surprised some-
times.”
“Well,these perpetual surprises aren't
good for the nerves. Anyway, they
don't establish confidence.”
“But you can always recover with
an iron or something. I'm awfully
good with an iron.”
“Oh, yes, I recover all right. I never
give in. For instance, I pulled the
eleventh hole out of the fire yesterday
when it seemed absolutely lost.”
“Do tell me,” said Miss Middleton,
eagerly. “I know you do want to tell
me, don't you?”
“I think you ought to hear. It ma
be a lesson to you. Well, he had the
honour, and drove a very long ball out
of sight. I sliced my drive into the tee
box, had to take a niblick to get out,
and laid my third dead on the tenth
green. Then—”
“Did you say you had mistaken the
flag?”
“I didn't. I took a brassie and got
back on the tee again, and then had
three beautiful iron shots which brought
me up to him. That was seven, and
my eighth landed me in an impossible
position on the beach. You would
probably have picked up at this
point.”
“I wouldn't,” said Miss Middleton,
indignantly. “I love playing on the
beach.”
“Well, some people would. I didn't.
I got to work with the niblick again.
Meanwhile my opponent, who, I should
have said, was conceding me a stroke,
pulled his second on to the beach too.
Fortunately—I mean unfortunately—
he never found his ball. And so the
hole was mine. Which so bucked me
up that I did the twelfth in two.”
I leant back and waited for the
applause.
“Well done !” said Miss Middleton.
“Like the hare and the tortoise.”
“Not at all,” I said indignantly.
“IDon't call me a tortoise.”
“I’m sorry,” said Miss Middleton,
penitently. “I meant “Boys of the
bull-dog breed.’”
“Yes, that 's it. Grittish Brit—
British grit, that's what did it. The
spirit which never knows when it is
beaten.”
“Were you beaten ?”
“I won the bye. Many people let
their grip of the game relax at the bye,
but I stuck to it.”
“I can see I shall have to play you,”
said Miss Middleton. “You mustn't
get too successful. What about to-
morrow 2 ''
“Well, I did think of having a lesson
to-morrow so as to find out again from
my man all the things I mustn't do,
so that I could write them out and
paste them on the head of my driver.
Then while I’m standing over the ball
on the tee I can refresh my memory
before swinging. But after what you've
said I don't think I will.”
“Oh, what have I said 2’’
“Why, that the great thing was to
hit the ball. Blow the rules. I'll
play you to-morrow, and I'll forget all
about them, and just keep my eye on
the ball and hit it.”
“Oh, but you mustn't do that. That
isn't fair.”
I laughed and got up.
“You’ve done me a lot of good,” I
said, “and I shall beat you to-morrow.
Thank you so much for listening to
me.”
“I wish I hadn't,” said Miss
Middleton nervously. “I know my
swing 's all wrong. Let me see, what
is it you do with the left knee 2"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MASTERPIECE OF THE ACE.
I.—THE WHOLE BoILING.
LET us at once state that it is
stupendous. It weighs several hundred-
weight: enough to fortify the door of
any reviewer against duns and writ-
servers. It is alphabetical: you have
but to know how any subject on which
you seek information is spelt and you
will be instructed. Those students
who cannot spell are advised to use it
in collaboration with a dictionary.
Supposing, for example, that you find
yourself in the same predicament as a
famous man of old and need some facts
on Chinese metaphysics. All you have
to do is to swing the crane loose, adjust
the chain to the volume containing
China, set the machinery in motion, and -
a sad discrepancy. Of the difficulties
deposit it on your desk. Then you
apply the same process to the volume
containing Metaphysics, and combine
the information.
In short, no strongly built house
should be without these instructive
volumes, which have cost so much
time and money in paper, ink, binding,
advertising and public dinners, to say
nothing of the hire of experts.
Finally we may remark that they
make the purchasers of the previous
edition, who were by no means few,
look rather foolish. Let them, how-
ever, take heart and concentrate their
thought on the state of mind of the
purchasers of this edition when the
next comes along, as surely it will,
from the banks of the reverend Cam.
While there is life there is hope—for a
new Encyclo. Britt.
II.-LITERATURE IN THE NEW
EDITION.
By Prof. Claudius Clemgoss, D.Litt.
The literary articles in the superb
work before us, which we are glad,
indeed, to own, are without exception
marvels of form, accuracy and sound
judgment. We read them all at a sitting,
and are now bulging with culture.
If we have a criticism, it is that
several of the writers seem to be sin-
gularly ill-equipped for their task. The
author of the article on the BRONTÉs,
for example, seems to be totally un-
aware that Lord NELsoN, whose title
was, of course, NELsoN and BRONTE,
was poor CHARLotte's long lost brother,
occupying the same close relationship
to EMILY and ANN. Any ordinary
student of the BRONTÉ family could
have told him this. On the other hand,
when he states that CHARLOTTE BRONTÉ
wrote the early chapters of Jane Eyre
in the upper room in “Eyre Arms,”
in the Finchley Road, he is merely
making the wish the father to the
thought. Apart from these blemishes
the article is magnificent and well
worth the price of the whole edition,
which, if we knew it, we would
quote.
III.-BILLIARDS IN THE NEw EDITION.
By Canon Diggle.
We have perused with the deepest
interest the fascinating remarks on the
great indoor game in the voluminous
and meritorious work which recently
stole into existence from the Cambridge
University Press; but to our astonish-
ment we can find no mention of the
latest records of GEORGE GRAY, the
marvellous boy who has completely
eclipsed the fame of his namesake
THOMAs. In an edition labelled “up to
date” in every newspaper, this surely is
of keeping abreast of the times from
day to day we are aware, but surely
the ingenuity of the set of men who
have invented so many devices for
advertising their wares could have hit
on some means of altering the figures
in the billiard article for the benefit of
subscribers, e.g. a circular posted to each
one every morning with the latest records
on some “stop press” system. It is
not my province to teach, merely to
CenSUllte.
IV.--ART IN THE NEW EDITION.
By Roger Loose Hind.
Whatever one may say of the solidity
of these wonderful volumes, there
cannot be two opinions as to their
value. They stand alone. We have
tried the experiment with each volume
and proved it. Whether or not the
best man has been obtained for each
article is a point we should prefer to
leave to them to decide. The experts
are well known; their addresses are in
Who's Who; and if the Editor over-
looks them his be the blame and
penalty. But it is not so much the
maladroit selection of writers in this
otherwise glorious work, which we are
delighted to possess, as the omissions
that are so distressing. We turn to
M. hoping to find that superb genius,
MATIssE, but in vain. And yet his
“Woman with the Green Eyes” will
undoubtedly be a living force when all
TURNER's golden visions are forgotten.
Just think of giving no column—or
indeed columns—to a man whose work
would honour any pavement, we care
not where it is. But this, after all, is
only a trifle. The work as a whole is
a triumph. Nothing mars the con-
tributions on art but a totally false
view of what art has been, is, and
should be. Everyone should purchase
a complete set.
W.—MUSIC IN THE NEw EDITION.
By Sir Sandow Donald, Mus.Doc., and
Professor Newman Sloggs.
There can be no doubt that, whether
we look at the length of the articles
or their weight, nothing like them has
yet been seen in any similar work.
Some captious critic may be inclined
to cavil at the fact that ninety columns
have been assigned to the Piccolo,
while WAGNER is disposed of in ten.
The absence of a portrait of Madame
AINo ACKTÉ and the omission of the
fee received by RICHARD STRAUss for
conducting at the opening of Messrs.
WANAMAKER's new building in New
York are unfortunate oversights; and
the inclusion of MENDELssohn, while
no mention is made of Mr. CLUTSAM or
Lord TANKERVILLE, is distinctly un-
patriotic. Still, when all deductions
have been made, the work has been
done in a way calculated to stagger
musical humanity. Anything more
gloriously illuminative than the illus-
trations to Miss Porringer's article on
the Contra-Pontoon cannot easily be
imagined, while Dr. Slithy's monograph
on the prospective plagiarisms of
Orlando Lasso is a masterpiece of
remorseless erudition.
-
We gather from the Crewkerne Ad-
vertising Sheet that there has been
some friction between the Urban District
Council and Mr. A. H. Hussey, the lay
rector, as to the organisation of the
local Coronation festivities. “I fear,”
writes a correspondent to the paper,
“after the insult offered to Mr. Hussey
that the Coronation will be a fiasco.”
However, there is a rumour in London
that in spite of this risk it will still
be proceeded with.
“Speaking at the Plymouth Library lecture
on Saturday, Mr. Arthur Spurgeon said that
though their great Devonshire novelist, Mr.
Philpotts, had been influenced by Mr. Thomas
Haruy, he had struck out a line of his own . . .
To be quite candid, Mr. Eden Phillpotts's
books would not be admirable for Sunday School
prizes.”— Western Evening Herald.
At least, he would have to strike out
a few more lines first.

SALLY SLUGABED.
A MoRAL TALE FOR THE LITTLE ONEs.
“GET up, you lazy, good-for-nothing
child !” cried Sally's mother one foggy
November morning. But Sally only
grunted and turned herself over for
another half-hour's sleep. The same
thing happened every day. Her sisters
were always down punctually at half-
past seven, and took breakfast with their
dear father, who had to leave for the
City at eight. And thus they enjoyed
to the full the benefit of his valuable
conversation and his searching ques-
tons, and listened carefully while their
mother sought to inform him why his
egg was hard boiled, and why the
kidneys were underdone, and whether
she called that coffee. But Sally, who
could not be made to see how good the
early morning air was for the mind,
thissed all this, and came down regularly
had been ordered for six, had not turned
up till nearly 7.30, so Mr. Weston had
had a cold and sooty breakfast, and his
conversation had been even brisker than
usual. But by the time Sally came
down the fires were alight and every-
thing was shipshape.
“Do you realise, you improvident
child,” said her distressed mother,
“how many years of your life you are
wasting by such conduct 2 Susie has
just worked it out, and it comes to
nearly forty days a year.”
“But you know, Mama,” answered
Sally, “I am always willing to stay up
extra late in order to make up for it.
And I am sure that at night Papa is
much * *
“That will do,” said Mrs. Weston
hastily. “Miss Pinker is waiting for
you in the schoolroom.” /
In the schoolroom Sally was imme-
diately made to declare ten times in
at ten o'clock in an aggravatingly good her best writing that the early bird

On this ſoggy November morning she could not get her governess to
Sally's mother, who was called Mrs. understand that there was another side
Weston (after her husband), was espe- to the question, and that the late worm
cally annoyed, because the sweep, who avoided the early bird. “Little girls,”
said Miss Pinker severely, “are not
worms; they have no early bird to
avoid.” “But what about Papa?"
asked Sally.
But after a time she grew tired of
her mother's lectures and her gover- |
ness's ideas about early birds. So one |
day she announced that she was going |
to turn over a new leaf and not waste
any more of the precious morning
hours. Everybody was overjoyed to
hear this, and next morning, true to
her word, Sally got up at six o'clock,
went downstairs, and commenced prac-
tising her scales with the loud pedal
down. In ten minutes' time Mr.
Weston entered the room in his dress-
ing-gown, picked his daughter up in
his arms, carried her to her bedroom,
and locked her in.
After that there were no more lec-
tures, and Miss Pinker was asked to |
get a new set of copy-book maxims.
But I am sure that Sally, who is now
grown up and still as great a slugabed
as ever, will never marry a nice earnest
young curate, as her sister Susie did
last year; and I, for one, shall have no
sympathy for her if she doesn't.

whereat they wonder is, where will he

This afternoon broke out in quite
unforeseen place. Douglas HALL had
on Paper innocent-looking but subtly
framed question suggesting that dis-
cussion of Committee stage of Veto

until LANSDown E's Bill reforming
House of Lords had been introduced
in another place. Swift MACNEILL's

infringement of independence and

support of this thesis he, interposing
between HALI, and PRIME MINISTER,
read at considerable length an essay on

Long Parliament (hence the lengthy

upon Captain CRAIG and the Member

sorrow, indignation and pity were
eloquently mingled. As for Dougi,As
HALL, who had put the original
Question, his existence was by this
time absolutely forgotten.
Having shrivelled up the guilty
Ulster Members, Sw1FT MACNEILL,
profiting by effect of threat to read his
paper all over again from the beginning,
was allowed to reach its portentous
conclusion in comparative silence.
Two little touches of comedy followed
upon tragic interlude. DEPUTY SPEAKER
remarked, “I do not see any reason

notwithstanding the fact that her age
was found in the Census of 1851 to be
ten years, and on further search in the
Record Office she was shown to be two
years of age in 1841.2”
From the first been some astounding
evolutions in Ireland in connection
with Old Age Pensions. Passing of
Act revealed to amazement of man-
kind unprecedented proportion of the
community whose life had passed limit
of threescore years and ten. Here was
a new and, by reason of its definiteness,
a more difficult problem. It is only in

THE HERO SPEAKS.
THE NEWSPAPER's VERSION.
MR. Joseph BINKs received our
representative courteously during the
quiet hour following his evening meal.
“Little did I think,” he remarked, “as
I proceeded to my daily labour yesterday
morning, that I was to pass through
experiences so overwhelming in their
intense excitement and so fraught
with deadly peril. I perceived smoke
issuing from the upper windows of
No. 973, Brabazon Terrace, and in a
flash something told me that the place
was on fire. ‘Heavens !' I exclaimed;
‘there are people sleeping there, little
dreaming of the danger that threatens
them. Perhaps helpless children l'
Divesting myself of my coat, I burst
open the front door without waiting on
ceremony, and rushed up the stairs,
calling “Fire!' as I ran. The top
landing was in a blaze; the fumes of
the burning woodwork well-nigh choked
me; but on I went. A cry, the cry of
a frightened woman, assailed my ears,
and Ileapt in the direction from whence
it issued. .
. . . Hastily wrapping al
blanket about her, I picked her up,
none too gently, I fear, and started to
return. But, horrors the stairs had
fallen in one blazing mass. A veritable
inferno roared beneath us. The win-
dow was our only chance. But the
cruel flames were already licking the
paint from the sashes. However,
gripping my charge as in a vice, I
crept cautiously . . . . .” and so on.
WHAT THE HERO REALLY SAID.
“That's me, mister—W'ich paper?—
No, never 'eard of it; always reads The
Star myself.-Yus, I did.—Yus.—Yus.
—No, left-'and side, goin' towards the
'Igh Road.—Yus.—Well, if you like to
put it that way, I spose it was.-Yus.

THE INNEEBAGS.
Now Herbert Preeps was kind and
stout,
And nothing seemed to put him out.
And Herbert Preeps was stout and
kind ;
His golden rule was “Never mind.”
He was not in tire least enraged
To find that he bad got engaged.
Where you'd have been intensely riled,
He merely stroke is chin and smiled.
He chose the ring and paid for it,
And did not care a little bit.
He simply went on smiling still,
And asked no discount off the bill.
The queeresh coif, the largest hat,
The worst and most appalling spat
Did not avail an inch to stir
His spleen. He said, “It pleases her.”
But oh how reckless women are ;
Of course she went a step too far,
And wore a Harem-scarum skirt.
Yes, then at last her Herb was hurt.
Where you'd have been content to
scoff,
The placid Preeps, he broke it off.
A drastic measure ? Ah, but note
The covering letter which he wrote:—
“Whatever sort of dress you wore,
I never was annoyed before;
For well I knew that women's clothes
Were things I could not be supposed"—
(The man was cross. He had no time
To excavate a better rhyme)—
“Supposed, I say, to understand,
But trousers, on the other hand,
“I am acquainted with. At least,
I think you might have had them
creased.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW TO HUMANIZE THE
LANDSCAPE.
THE proposal to commemorate the
nij birthday of the PRINCE
REGENT of BAvARIA by carving a
mountain into the semblance of a
colossal statue representing the vener-
able ruler has naturally led to the
formulation of an immense number of
similar schemes in this country.
Thus subscriptions are being actually
solicited at this moment for a fund to
celebrate the five-hundreth retirement
of Lord RosBBERY from public life by
moulding the summit of Primrose Hill
into a gigantic representation of his
Lordship's finely-modelled cranium.
Again, theatrical circles are stirred
to their depths by a brilliant idea
for commemorating in fitting fashion
the purchase, by Mr. GEORGE ALEx-
ANDER, of his ten thousandth pair of
trousers for histrionic purposes. It is
proposed that on the cliffs at Holyhead
a huge full-length portrait of the
illustrious actor-manager should be
executed in the living rock, facing St.
George's Channel (to be henceforth
known as George's Strait), and .#
to all time the adamantine creaseless-
ness of those historic nether garments
which have moved so many millions
to tears and laughter.
Mr. T. P. O'CoNNOR, M.P., whom
Mr. HEALY in a moment of affectionate
ecstasy once called “a rale Pat of
butter,” has never had his statue
erected in or out of his native isle.
The recent appearance in his magazine
of his ten-millionth article, entitled
“The Moral Beauty of Back-scratch-
ing,” has suggested to the innumerable
admirers of his luscious bonhomie how
imperatively necessary it is to imprint
upon the landscape the adorable linea-
ments of the universal lubricator of
modern life. It has accordingly been
roposed that a monstrous portrait of
º O'Connor should be traced on
Ireland's Eye, and that the space so
covered should be sown exclusively
with buttercups.
It has often excited surprise that the
possibilities for landscape portraiture
resented by the chalk downs should
É. almost entirely monopolised by the
equine tribe. A judicious novelty will
shortly be inaugurated on the occasion
of the appearance of Sir HENRY
Howorth's twenty-thousandth small-
print letter in The Times, when his
friends have arranged that a portrait of
that indefatigable . gladiator,
mounted on a mammoth, shall be scraped
on the hill-side at Boreham.
A very touching act of homage has
recently been paid to Mr. BRAM StokeR.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
AT THE PLAY.
“THE LILY.”
I HAVE to complain, but not bitterly,
of two fly-leaves inserted in my Kings-
way programme—one giving favourable
extracts of press-notices of The Lily,
the other setting forth typical menus
of a neighbouring restaurant, where
luncheons and dinners may be ob-
tained at reasonable charges. Now I
am prepared for the simple indication
of an address where I can get supper
after the play, but I hardly ever lunch
or dine after 11 P.M. Besides, a
critic might easily mix up these two
insertions to the confusion of his
judgment. Thus, when I read The
Daily Mail's statement—“Held the
house in its grip "-in conjunction
with The Pall Mall Gazette's comment
—“Cheers at the finish "-I thought
that something must be wrong with
the “Grilled Chump Chop of Lamb”;
and when I perused The Star's critique
—“Invigorates like mountain air. Fill
your lungs with it"—I could not help
feeling that, if the reference was to the
“Braised Duckling Fermière,” the lungs
were the wrong place for it. However,
to the play.
“Lo the lilies of the field,
How their leaves instruction yield !”
This flower of our childhood's hymn-
als has nothing in common with The
Lily of Great Queen Street, except
that each of them declines to be a
spinster. “Lily" is apparently the
recognised term for a woman who is
expected to spend her life in minister-
ing to the comforts of a selfish and
dictatorial parent and gets no social
opportunity of escaping a perpetual
maidenhood. Such conditions are likely
enough to encourage secretiveness,
and one can well understand how a
girl in this position, foiled of her proper
chances of finding a husband in her
own class, might contrive a clandestine
marriage with an undesirable person.
This scheme would have sufficiently
served the authors' purpose, but they
preferred to overstate their case by
making their “Lily” contract a liaison
with a married man.
The First and Last Acts are moder-
ately futile, but the Second and Third
—the Second in particular—have some
really excellent stuff in them. One
was given a very effective impression
of the ménage at the château, and the
plot for decoying the lover was
freshly laid. For a modern play, how-
ever, adapted to English tastes, it
suffers from a leading motive—the
idea that the sole end of woman is
to get herself married—which seems
strangely out of touch with the times.
Mr. LAURENCE IRVING, as the egoist
parent, gave a quite admirablecharacter-
study, treating every detail with the
very nicest artistry. He knew exactly
what to do and what to leave un-
done. His one blemish was the miser-
able cloth cap which the old dandy
wore over his dyed locks in the Last
Act. It looked as if it had been
borrowed from a scene-shifter.
Miss GERALDINE OLLIFFE was deli-
cately true to nature in her interpre-
tation of a patient daughter and devoted
elder sister. Unhappily the authors had
laid themselves out to supply her and
her sister with a long and exhausting
tirade apiece, in which their pent-up
grievances found an expression which
was too much both for me and their
father. I liked Miss MABEL HACKNEY
“Lilies of
Comte de Maigny (to Christiane).

parents l.ce that.
daughter of mine !”
Miss MABEL HAckNEY and Mr. LAURENCE
IRVING.
(The Lily) better in her quiet deceitful-
ness than in the terrific outburst of
candour which was meant to be the
clou of the play. Mr. ARTHUR LEwis
had an easy and grateful part as every-
body's friend and counsellor, and did it
very comfortably. As Arnaud, a French
artist (with complications), Mr. RUPERT
HARVEY had the most saintly air of
celibacy that I have ever yet observed
among the spoilers of innocence.
I confess that I was surprised at
the excellence of much of the play,
though there were things in it which
I did not quite grasp, as, for instance,
how it was that, with a widowed parent
whose irregular habits must have fre-
quently called him away to the capital,
Henceforth you are no
his daughters had not utilised these
interludes for a little social amusement
at the château on their own account,
which might have led up to a chance
of matrimony, if that was what they
wanted so badly. And I was also a little
troubled by the abruptness of some of
the transitions, as when two visitors,
immediately on their arrival, sat down
and played, at nobody's request, a duet
for voice and harp. O. S.
ART NOTES.
THE absence of so many peers from
England at this moment is due to the
circumstance that they are scouring
the Continent in the hope of picking
up cheap Old Masters which they can
offer to American millionaires at greatly
enhanced figures.

The advertisement of Mr. Hiram L.
Flinkers, the multi-millionaire of
Cincinnati, in a recent issue of The
Times may have escaped general
notice, but enough interested persons
saw it to serve Mr. Flinkers' purpose.
It ran thus:—
To Noblemen.—American collector
requires heirlooms. Must have family
history attached.—Apply, etc.
It is understood that in response to
this appeal a number of applications
for permission to sell historic heir-
looms will shortly be before the Courts.
Everyone must be glad that so much
lumber is in the way of quickly being
translated into that currency which
procures such real necessaries of life
as motor cars, suppers, &c.

Lord Slough of Despond has just
successfully negotiated the sale of the
famous Hals which has long been the
glory of his ancestral seat. Lord
Slough of Despond, being nothing if
not patriotic, on receiving the offer of
£300,000 from Mr. Slick, of Pittsburg,
at once replied, with rare self-sacrifice
and thoughtfulness, that the American
connoisseur could have it at that figure
only if England did not come forward
to buy it at a reduction of £1,000
within three days of the offer. The
money not being forthcoming, the
picture is now on its way to Mr. Slick's
palace in 687th Street.

Mr. Elihu Z. Bird, who has been
called the Lorenzo dei Medici of Seattle,
differs from his fellow American vir-
tuosi. His idea is to acquire pictures
from the private collections of none
but Trustees of the English National
Gallery. . This circumstance, he says,
should lend piquancy to his Ārt
Museum.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
In a Preface to her latest hook, A Diplomatist's Wife in
Many Lands (HUTCHINSON), Mrs. HUGH FRASER anticipates
that “some excuse will surely be demanded for giving so
much space to the opening chapters of my life in these
volumes.” This is a mistake born of modesty. The most
delightful portion of the work is, happily, the more exten-
sive section, that which deals with the childhood, girlhood
and unmarried life of a charming lady. Mrs. FRASER was
by birth richly endowed. Her grandfather came of old
Scots-Irish stock; her father was borº in New England;
her mother in New York; she herself, sister of MARION
CRAwFoRD, was, like him, born in Rome and educated in
Italy. She lived there up to her marriage, atmospherically
and socially in the sunshine. From her earliest years
fate and good fortune brought her in personal contact with
prominent men and women, who little suspected the close
study to which they were subjected in succession by child,
girl and woman. To a -— -
least, these were the conditions of the Bodger-Wallon |
household, and we are left to suppose it not untypica
of the rest. The Wallon father having married the Bodger
mother, each brought two children, a boy and a girl, to the
joint home; and of these four, the Bodgers, stronger and
coarser, persecuted the Wallons, Tudor and John (it is one
of my smaller grudges against the book that a girl should
be confusingly named John), till their existence became
a misery. Thus Tudor, with all his bright and happy
possibilities—the author, you see, spares us no aspect of
her tragedy—is maimed, by circumstance and the Bodgers,
into a gloomy and drunken coward. Eventually he tries
to kill Philip Bodger, and, failing, flings away his own life
to save the girl-Bodger and John from a carriage accident
pre-arranged by the latter. Life in Wales, according to
Miss MACAULAY, is like that. I wonder!
Whatever else you feel concerning America—Through
English Eyes (STANLEY PAUL), you cannot refuse sympathy
to an author who, having promised herself (and possibly
keen eye for descrying
character is added the
gift of presenting a
vivid portrait in a few
touches. One thinks
in reading some of the
passages what a splen-

there is (on pp. 59, 60)
a marvellous picture of
Rome on the day when,

things a good Catholic,
discerned a preternatural protest against the desecration of
the Vatican. Her strong prejudices in respect of forms
of religion and political partisanship sometimes lead her
astray. Angrily denouncing action by the Foreign Office in
1878, which, she says, “roused a storm of indignation all
through the diplomatic family,” she bitterly adds, “It took
place under a Liberal Ministry, of course.” In 1878
Lord BEAconsfield was Prime Minister, and the Marquis
of SALISBURY Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
I don't know when I have encountered a grimmer story,
after its own quiet, domestic fashion, than The Valley
Captives (MURRAY). Miss R. MACAULAY's picture of rural
existence in Wales haunts one afterwards like a nightmare.
Her skill and the obvious sincerity of her manner naturally
make its effect worse. Perhaps hitherto you have vaguely
thought of the Welsh as a people living chiefly upon
furnished apartments, with a flourishing export trade in
picture post-cards and politicians?, Miss MACAULAY will
show them to you as “captives,” victims of boredom
unspeakable, and consumed with a black hatred of one
another, lightened only by flashes of intoxication. At
Boston, and records her ingenuous “impressions” of these
cities, faithfully explaining that taxi-cabs are expensive to
hire, that tram-car conductors shy at “Please” and
“Thank you,” and that you cannot get your boots cleaned
at the hotel. Fresh as these observations are, we might
have had something even fresher if only she had not had
to put up, throughout, with the sham article. However,
the elusiveness of her object does not seem to have pre-
vented her from having a fairly good time. The only
real trouble with America, as seen through “Rita's" eyes,
is that it is not typically American.

CHARIVARIA.
LoRD KITCHENER has been appointed
to command the troops assembled in
London for the Coronation ceremonies.
It is an open secret that, if he should
acquit himself satisfactorily, a Terri-
torial adjutancy may be offered him.
The National Peace Council has
expressed the hope that the Coronation
pageant will not be confined to repre-
sentatives of the naval and military
forces of the Crown. It would, by the
way, be rather pretty if, in one of
the processions, room could be
found for all persons named
should be followed rather than
George.
“Radicals,” says The Daily
Chronicle, “attribute the enor-
mous growth in the Navy
Estimates to the fact that
they are dictated now, not by
statesmen, but by admirals.”
It does seem curious that in
such a matter the advice of a
man like Sir KNY VET WILSON
that, say, of Mr. KEIR HARDIE.
The Débats thinks it would
be a graceful acknowledgment
if, in return for France's con-
cession in adopting Greenwich
time, England would adopt the
metric system of weights and
measures. We have heard of
time working wonders, but this
would be a miracle.
Mr. CHURCHILL has decided
to appoint a committee to
inquire into the question of r
Manx Constitutional reform.
It is possible that a re-
commendation may be made
in favour of an Omnibus Bill to
cover the cases of Ireland, Wales,
and the Isle of Man.

THE SEMOLINA AND THE GERM.
[A phantasy based upon the combination of these two elements in the
ide il, or “Standard,” loaf.]
GEORGINA 1 if the high divinities
That mould our lives had never laid
Their ban on our profound affinities,
Oh, what a pair we might have made 1
But the Olympians chose to chuckle,
Upsetting Nature's wise decree
That you should play the Honeysuckle,
And I the Bee.
It is their game to bring together
The uncongenial groom and bride; -
Conversely, too, to cut the tether
That kindred tastes would else have tied;
This is the thought that thins my locks so,
That such a pair apart should slip–
You, so to speak, the Cup of Boxo,
And I the Lip.
A combination badly sundered,
Forced by estranging routes to go—
United, how we might have thundeled
Along this dusty vale of woeſ
Yes, truly, we had travelled better,
Parts of a whole, with Love to steer—
You, as it were, the Carburetter,
And I the Gear.
Nature, I notice, now and then drills
Her family to clasp and twine;
So I would have your loving tendrils
Cling to this lonely heart of mine,
As o'er the oak in Druid copses
The faithful ivy joys to crawl— *
You, by your leave, the Ampelopsis,
And I the Wall.
And yet, perchance, in that hereafter
Where severed loves redeem their gage,
Where mid Elysian fields of laughter
“Standard ” ambrosia 's all the rage,
We'll readjust, my poor Georgina,
The rift that marked our mortal term—
You, let us say, the Semolina,
And I the Germ.
AN ACCLIMATISED COLONIAL.
WHEN I first saw him I was standing by a seat on the
Broad Walk, Regent's Park; he was sitting up on the grass
a few yards away, and I could see by the expression in
his little round eye that he was considering whether my
acquaintance was worth cultivating or not. Finally
he decided to risk it, and, making straight for me in
a series of swift undulating leaps, sprang on to the top
of the seat, and thence to my left arm.
I might have felt more flattered by this condescension
on the part of a Canadian squirrel if I had not been fully
aware that it was due less to any personal attractions of
my own than to the fact that my right hand happened
to hold a small paper bag containing pea-nuts. You
can procure these at the Refreshment Pavilion close by,
and they give you quite a lot for a penny.
“I don't mind trying one of those,” he said in squirrel
language º if I speak it but indifferently, I under-
stand fairly well). I passed him the bag. He helped
himself, turned the nut once or twice in his forepaws,
examined it critically, and rejected it with disdain.
“Rotten ''' he remarked with unaffected candour. “Not
fit to offer a wood-pigeon I shall have to trouble you
again.” Which he did, but with no better success.
“Another wrong 'un ' " he said. “They seem to have
been working off all their back numbers on you ! If those
Pavilion people don't supply a better quality of pea-nut, we
squirrels will just have to withdraw our patronage—and
where would they be then, I'd like to know?" I begged
him to give them one more chance, and he graciously
consented. “Well,” he admitted, as he sampled a third
nut, “this isn't so bad. Wants keeping—a trifle out of
condition, but it'll do at a pinch. Yes,” he continued, in
the intervals between his nibbles, as he sat on my arm,
“we’re pretty numerous here. When we first arrived, all
the most desirable residences were occupied by brown
squirrels. Mighty condescending they were to us. Said
they were superior to colour prejudice, and if we did
chance to be born grey, we were nevertheless squirrels
and brothers. Told us we were welcome to any branches
or nuts they'd no use for. Offered to show us round.
But I guess we showed them round. There was no
enterprise about those squirrels, Sir, that was the trouble
with them. Wouldn't go out of their way to appeal to
your great British Public | Too stuck-up and stand-offish.
And as for hustling—why, they spent more 'n half the
winter asleep! It was get on or get out, and they couldn't
seem to get on—not with us, anyway. So you won't see
any brown squirrels about here now. We started in to run
this settlement as a business proposition from the word
‘go,' and we're progressing, Sir, by leaps and bounds!
Made our pile already, most of us have. I'm not one to
blow, but if I was to tell you the amount of nuts to m
credit in that bank over there, where the tulip bed is, it 'd
make you open your eyes! And I'm not the warmest
squirrel in this Walk by any means. It only shows what
can be done, even in an old country like this, by getting
a move on. I don't say we haven't a failure among us
here and there. For instance, you see that squirrel sitting
up under the plane-tree? . . . Yes, the one with his fore-
paws clasped tight across his stomach. No, he isn't looking
well, and what's more, he isn't feeling well either. That
squirrel, Sir, drew out the whole of his deposit directly the
bank opened this morning, and now he's gono and busted
every blessed nut he had l But it isn't the first time he's
gone bankrupt, not by a long way, and, soon as he's
got his digestion in working order again, I expect he'll
re-commence business and like as not be as rich as ever he
was " . . .”
“Excuse me a moment,” he broke off suddenly, and,
darting down into the Broad Walk, held up an approaching
perambulator and child with the air of a highwayman.
When he returned to my arm he was holding a fragment of
a biscuit, which he inspected dubiously. “It's either an
Osborne or a Marie,” he pronounced; “but I've an idea
that baby's been having a go at it first. . . . No, on the
whole I'd rather have another nut. Talking of nuts,” he
continued, “the Public that visits the Zoo don't begin to
realise what nuts are meant for. I know, because I've got
cousins and things in the Zoo. Most elegantly located
they are, with a tree and enclosed lot all to themselves,
and free to go in and out and receive their relations just as
they please, and no questions asked. I look in at times,
and, if you'll believe me, the Public there actually squanders
all its nuts on a set of undeserving monkeys whose manners
—well, I'd be sorry to think any squirrel would be so
wanting in ordinary self-respect | It's a mercy we haven't
got to associate with monkeys here. The wood-pigeons are
bad enough. Just look at 'em, waddling round ! If any

After all, he was my guest). “It's our nuts they fatten

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
VANITY FAIR.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-People are tell-
ing each other un petit conte pour rire
about the Sunday Club at Olympia.
Lady Manoeuvrer has been there
regularly through the season with her
youngest and only unappropriated girl,
Bluebell, in tow. Bluebell being very
timid and wobbly, the Duke of Dulwich
undertook to help her and show her
how it's done. Entre mous, my dear,
he's only a wobbler himself, but there's
no point on which people are so self-
deceived as their skating—except, per-
haps, their profiles | Well, Bluebell
(her mother's own daughter!) made
the very best use of her time, flattering
r Dulwich about his prowess on
rollers and the immense help he 'd
given her; and now that their engage-
ment's announced and the wedding-
day fixed it comes out that the
Manoeuvrer girl is quite one of the
best amateur skaters of the day, can
do the Donkey's. Lars, Mustard and
Cress, and all the most diffy club
figures—in short, that what she can't
do on rollers or blades isn't worth
doing !
Aunt Goldie hasn't come to town
yet. She sends Norty an occasional
sixpenny wire from Devonshire (answer
prepaid), asking him if he remembers
that he has a wife I don't know
whether the answer is in the affirma-
tive, as they say in the House. Talking
of that dreadful House, Norty says the
way Private Members are being used
is simply scandalous, and that there's
not been such a state of affairs since
PITT, or somebody. The plan of giving
them jig-saws to keep them quiet and
prevent them from noticing what's
going on is a failure. Norty says Pri-
vate Members might just as well send
messenger-boys to sit in their places,
and a great many of them mean to do
so. He's only had the chance to
speak once since Parliament met.
Wasn't that a lovely speech of his 2
and didn't he let them have it straight
about this proposal to give Australia
to Japan and the Isle of Wight to
Germany ”
Such a funny affair at the Wim-
bushes', my dear! You know them,
don't you? He's Sir Peter Wimbush,
Ltd., the great bristle man of Thames
Street; but one meets them every-
where, for they're simply rolling, and
bristles—qua bristles—so long as they
don't make themselves into brooms
and brushes—are visited and may visit !
George, the elder son, followed his
father into bristles and his mother to
parties, and was just like other young
men. But Leonard, the younger one,
has suffered acutely from “views.”
He wouldn't live at home, dressed
anyhow, spelt people with a big P,
wore a red tie, addressed open-air
meetings, and led about dingy pro-
cessions that wanted things. The old
people and George were horribly angry
and ashamed. Not long ago, George's
engagement to Torfrida Saxonbury
was announced. She's the Mercias'
second girl, pretty and popular and
an enthusiastic Daffodil-Leaguer (her
brothers, Hengist and Horsa, are two
of the nicest boys I know). The old
W.’s were in raptures with George's
engagement, and asked their dear
future daughter to use “a sister's
influence" with Leonard to win him
from the error of his ways. She set
to work obediently. George and his
parents used to leave her tāle-à-téle
with Leonard, that she might argue
and coax and win him back to the
right way; and so the arguing and
coaxing and “sister's influence” went
on—till, two days before she was to
have married George, Torfrida ran
away with Leonard, and then wrote
to say she had won him back to the
right way, that his views had proved
to be dissolving-views, that he 'd
thrown away his red ties and spelt
people with a small p again, but
that they'd found that they couldn't
live without each other, and so
they were married, and they hoped
George and the parents would forgive
them
The old Wimbushes had nothing to
forgive, of course. On the contrary,
they were overjoyed to have Leonard
won back. But their joy was short.
George, in his rage, has become a
worse Socialist than Leonard ever was,
vows vengeance against society, and
not only wears a red tie but a red
revolutionary cap! I hear that he
addressed a meeting in the Park last
week and advocated the abolition of
almost everything, and particularly of
parents, brothers, and fiancées /
Lala Middleshire gets on splendidly
with her Maison de Deuil. The Bullyon-
I3oundermere woman has been heard
to say that she wishes “the dear
duchess had gone into a business
where one would have had more
opportunity of dealing with her "
Norty says Mr. B.-B. had better keep
a sharp eye on his better half and a
bright look-out on what he eats, as
wifely affection may go down before
the longing to give Lala a job
Oh, my dearest and best! I'd such
a dilly evening a week or so ago! I
went to the great fight between Basher
Briggs and Kid Billings. (I gave a big
tea for them the afternoon before, and
everybody voted them simply and
absolutely charming).
The fight itself was just a little bit
rather a disappointment, the poor dear
Kid being knocked out in the sixth
round. Beryl Clarges was quite furious
about it, said she'd expected a thirty-
round contest at least, and had given
ten guineas for nothing !—which I con-
sidered distinctly bloodthirsty of her.
We've got the victor, Basher Briggs,
for our next Causerie du Mardi. He's
going to talk to us about upper-cuts
and body-blows, and all delicious things
of that sort, for the especial benefit of
women who were too nervy to go to the
fight.
So all that tiresome nonsense about
SHAKSPEARE and BAcon is up again,
and they're positively groping in a river
for writings to prove that it was BAcos
But I can just tell them this:–If they
do find any writings in the river, it will
prove the case for Shakspeare, for you
know, my dearest, in one of his plays
he mentions “books in running brooks,”
and that was evidently after he'd put
some there. Nothing like a woman's
wit for settling these matters!
I asked dear Professor Dimsdale
what he thinks about it, and he says
that, for his part, he holds that not only
was there no such person as SHAR-
SPEARE, but that there was no such man
as BACON either, and that QUEEN ELIZA-
BETH did it all ! I thanked him in the
name of all my sex for having such a
tip-top opinion of one of us, and he said,
“Not at all. It's my fixed belief that

THE BR00DINGS OF GAMBERLEY.
SECOND SERIES.”
(After “The Comments of Bagshot.")
September 9th, 1837–While waiting
for my 'bus this morning I had the
good luck to fall in with a window-
cleaner. Sitting by me all the way to
my office, he talked of his profession;
and he was, I think, the wisest man
I ever met, and certainly the most
modest. “Yes,” he said, in response
to one of my questions, “it’s cer-
tainly dangerous. But, then, so is
life. Life's dangerous, life is. It's
dangerous for us to sit here. The
horses may run away; the wheel may
come off; something may barge into
us; we may be catching cold ; for all
I know to the contrary, you've got
the diphtheria, and I shall get it too.
Window-cleaning, no doubt, is perilous
work; but what I say is this: every-
thing's perilous, come to think about
it. Look at the blokes what have died
in bed. That's what I say, and that's
why I'm not afraid when I'm cleaning
the third floor front or the fourth floor
back.” I call that heroic common-
sense. Ever since then I have been
racking my brain to imagine what he
would say if he fell.
June 6th, 1852.-Last night I had a
curious dream, as indeed I often do.
I dreamt that I had gone to a swim-
ming bath and had undressed, but could
not find any bath with more than one
foot or possibly eighteen inches of water
in it. They were splendid large baths,
and I was looking for a good swim, but
it was no use. I went from one to another
and always the same want of water.
It is impossible for my pen to convey
the disappointment that I felt in being
thus defrauded of the natation I had so
eagerly anticipated. I woke thoroughly
unrefreshed, and have often thought
since how remarkable dreams are and
wondered whence they draw their
inspiration.
November 5th, 1871.-I saw an odd
sight in the street to day. A number

about remembering something, which,
as it is what I am always doing or
trying to do, naturally interested me.
But all my humanity was roused by
the spectacle of the child being thus
exposed not only to the elements and
the ridicule of the passers-by, but also
to the ordinary danger of vehicular
traffic in this vast and busy city of
ours, and, acting on an impulse, I
dashed at the perambulator, intending
to snatch the baby from it. This, how-
ever, was not easy, as it was tied in.
But I quickly drew my pen, that being
much mightier than my knife, and
slashed the cords. Meanwhile the boys
were saying things that would set the
readers of this reminiscence screaming
were I to repeat them ; but I was not
silenced, and bore the baby swiftly to
my office. There, however, to my dis-
gust I discovered that it was only a
stuffed dummy. I have been wonder-
ing ever since what I should have done
with it had it been real.

one's ears open and one's eyes wide.
A heavily-laden waggon, containing I
do not know what, but evidently mer-
chandise of considerable avoirdupois,
drew across our way. Our driver,
without a moment's hesitation, called
out, “Why don't you get your old
woman to come out and drive for
you?" The expression of mortification
on the waggoner's face, as he realized
that he had no fitting reply, would
require the pencil of a CLAUDE to do it
justice. I have often wondered since,
not only what the best retort would
have been, but also what the waggon
contained.
March 15th, 1904.—Walking down
Southampton Row this morning, I
noticed three little boys playing the
game which I believe is called tip.cat,
One of the urchins struck the cat with
such violence that it flew through the
window of a solicitor's office; but before
the indignant clerk emerged, the boys
had disappeared. I am still wondering
what would have happened if the
“cat" had been alive, or, worse still,
had had nine lives and nine tails.
March 17th, 1911.-I was walking
down the Strand to-day, and passed a
party of girls going westward on the
north side, opposite the Savoy. One
of them, pretty, daintily dressed, aged
about eighteen, and apparently quite
sane, suddenly detached herself from
the others and planted a fervent kiss
on the window of The Globe office. All
to-night I have been racking my brain
to imagine why, if she had to kiss any
evening paper, she kissed that. As if
there were no others!
It is fortunate, is it not, that these
are merely extracts from Camberley's
note-book, and not my own 2. This
thought keeps me busy and happy
most of the spare time I get.

at first see how a future one is going
to get born. Possibly it will be
managed away from home.

A DEFENCE OF THE FELINE..
[The Reverend Head Master of Eton, a
º vegetarian, recently attacked the
onestic cat at the annual meeting of the
Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
“The harmless necessary cat,” he declared, “is
neither harmless nor necessary. Could not the
public be compelled to check the multiplication
of cats . . . Could any tragedy be more
wanton than the devastation of a goldfinch's
nest by a prowling brute that nobody wanted to
live.”]
STRONG indignation fires my soul,
With strength my Muse apparels;
Come here, ye kittens ! Caracole,
And fill your furry barrels;
Tush to the reverend pedagogue's
controll
Roll on, thou deep and dark blue
Persian, roll
And rend the night with carols.
Have I no sympathy with larks
And nightingales and throstles,
Who love my Tiger's purred remarks
When round my boots he jostles 2
I would not suffocate his vital sparks
For all the thunders of the Church's
clerks,
Backed by the twelve Apostles.
What if he takes a tit or two
Or other tiny trillers,
The feathered victims that he slew
Were they not also killers ?
Shall we not weep for gentlemen who
rue
The flush unborn of wings that never
flew—
Who keep pet caterpillars?
Has not the anguish of the worm,
His mute eyes turned to heaven
(Beast who, the scientists affirm,
Is nature's salt and leaven),
By the rathe blackbird's beak com-
pelled to squirm,
Sometimes prevented boys for half the
term
From getting up at seven 2
No, if the gods have been unkind
And filled the world with riot,
It scarce becomes a sage's mind
To add to this disquiet.
Better to found some academe designed
To teach both birds and cats the more
refined,

OUR NEW PATRICIANS.
PALACES WHILE You WAIT.
THE superb palace which Lord
Ockstein, the famous South African
magnate, is building on his Surrey
estate of Hankley Hall, midway be-
tween the Devil's Jumps and the Hog's
Back, is not only remarkable as a
typical specimen of modern rococo
domestic architecture of the most
advanced order, but as constituting a
record in rapid construction. The
Hankley Hall Estate, it may be
mentioned at the outset, was for some
four hundred years in the possession
of the old Surrey family of Tilford, but
was purchased for a song in 1896 by
Mr. Nathan Frankel, the well-known
City financier, who sold it two years
ago to Lord Ockstein for £750,000.
The estate lies in the heart of the most
picturesque tract of what is still known
as wild Surrey, and the view from the
site of the new house is one of the
finest in England.
The old Elizabethan manor-house
which Lord Ockstein took over with
the property occupied a beautiful tree-
sheltered position facing South over
the Wey valley, and was pronounced
by Mr. REGINALD BLoMFIELD, A.R.A.,
to be an even finer specimen of late
Tudor style than the superb Norfolk
manor-house which was recently pulled
down by Lord Lumley of Peckham.
Hankley Old Hall, which was begun
in 1576 and finished in 1613, was
demolished in two days by Messrs.
Wallop, the famous contractors, who
are pushing on the construction of the
new palace at such a high rate of
speed that it is expected the whole
work will be finished in less than
three months. Since the days of
the Great Pyramid of CHEoPs there
has never been so large an army
of workmen simultaneously employed
on the same work. Already the shell
of the gigantic building is complete,
and in a week or two the battalions of
masons, stone-cutters, &c., will be
replaced by fresh hordes of skilled
craftsmen from the Tottenham Court
Road, who will complete the internal
fitting, decorating and upholstery.
As for externals, it may be at once
admitted that Messrs. Gotch and
Knackfuss, the architects, have reso-
lutely refused to retain any of the
features of the old building. The new
palace is entirely in the neo-Gulielmian
style, and is built from end to end
of collo-concrete blocks of condensed
"päté de foie gras faced with Parian
marble. The portico, supported by
Ionic columns, is a fine specimen of
the Debased Byzantine school, and
the mixture of Gothic arches, Norman

THE MARTYRS.
MY cousins, the Metcalfes, have just
returned from wintering in Switzerland.
I say this without fear of contradiction,
because each of them, at his or her
own time, has told me all about it.
Yes, all and a little bit more besides.
I have marvelled much, and with never-
failing politeness. I have uttered many
a “Really?” many a “You don't say
so,” many a “How delightful!” - My
face has ached from the incessant strain
of a concentrated expression. Ah I
I have suffered.
My relatives-in-law, the Adden-
brokes, invited me to dine with them
last night. I went. “They are talk-
ative,” I admitted to myself, “but they
do not like snow. They cannot have
been to Switzerland. With them I
shall, at any rate, find relief from the
never - ceasing information of my
cousins, the Metcalfes.” But upon
greeting my hostess I received the
worst news. My relatives-in-law, the
Addenbrokes, had, it appeared, been
wintering in Egypt, and it was for me
to take the youngest and the worst of
them in to dinner. This I reluctantly
did.
“Tell me all about Egypt,” I said,
“and get through with it as quickly
as possible.” -
She started telling me all about
Egypt, beginning with the crossing
from Dover to Calais. “That,” I told
her, “is more or less familiar. Come
to the detailed glories of the Orient as
expeditiously, as may be. One travels
to Switzerland also vid Dover and
Calais.”
She tarried at Naples. “Have we
much further to go?” I asked, swallow-
ing a yawn.
We arrived at Cairo with the entrée
and had only left Egypt with the
savoury. We just managed to reach
England again by dessert-time, and I
had scarcely been put out upon
Charing Cross platform and had the
luggage examined, w). ... the ladies with-
drew, Egyptian cigarettes (smuggled)
appeared, and John Addenbroke drew
his chair up to mine. At once I was
re-embarked at Dover. From Dover,
it seems, one sails to Calais.
“Pardon,” I interrupted, “but a
thought occurs to me which demands
instant utterance. Has it ever occurred
to you that history omits all reference
to its real heroes, its genuine martyrs 2"
“Talking about our journey to
Egypt,” he replied irrelevantly.
“I was thinking rather,” I persisted,
“of another man's journey to America.
In no book of history have I even seen
their names mentioned, but what
agonies they must have been through!”
“Who are “they’?” he asked im-
patiently. I answered him with great
deliberation.
“The relatives,” I said, “and the
relatives-in-law of Columbus.”
IRREGULAR ANNIVERSARIES.
[“It being twelve years and a half ago to-day
since Queen Wilhelmina ascended the throne,
celebrations are being held throughout the
country.”—“Daily Mail.”]
As it is now exactly twenty-seven
years, three months and a half since
Mr. Roosevelt shot his first grizzly,
the anniversary is being suitably cele-
brated at Oyster Bay.
Precisely nineteen years, nine months
and three quarters have elapsed since
Mr. BART KENNEDY arrived at the
epoch - making decision to eliminate
verbs from his narrative style. In com-
memoration of this joyous date the
Bermondsey Quick Speech League have
decided to entertain the eminent littéra-
teur at a quick lunch at the Cassowary
Restaurant.
Close on thirty-two years have
winged their way into the past since
Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE, during
a sojourn in the Bavarian Highlands,
acquired the fascinating accomplish-
ment of jodelling. . The Incorporated
Society of Bavarian Highlanders have
very properly decided to signalise this
auspicious anniversary by an al-fresco
concert in Trafalgar Square, at which
Sir HERBERT has kindly promised to
render the Ranz des Vaches in costume
to an accompaniment on the xylophone,
performed by Sir HENRY J. Wood.
Just eleven years and eleven months
ago Mr. Douglas SLADEN narrowly
escaped being run over by an omnibus
in Piccadilly. To celebrate the anni-
versary of this happy escape, his fellow-
members of the Omar Kháyyám Club
have decided to serenade him with an
Ode, which has been written by Mr.
CHARLEs GEAKB and set to music by
the Queen of RoumanIA, assisted by the
Chevalier LE QUEUx.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM The DiARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday March 13.
—SreAKER coming back to Chair after
nearly week's retirement more or less
cheerfully spent in company of an old
family friend finds hanging low over
House an appreciable, though inde-
scribable, cloud of dulness. Some-
thing to do, perhaps, with absence of
PREMIER, called away by illness of his
daughter, and sight of empty seat
rarely occupied by CHANCELLOR OF
ExchEQUER since Session opened.
Gaps in other quarters of House,
occupants not caring to face wintry
March, who, having failed to come in
like a lion, assumes aspect of polar
bear. PRINCE ARTHUR drops in
punctually when Questions nearly over.
Edward GREY, understood to be in
charge of forthcoming debate, strate-
gically makes himself master of situa-
tion by viewing its early development
from retirement of his room behind the
SPEAKER's Chair.
WINsoME WINSTON, wide awake after
being up all Thursday night, appears
at Table, bearer of Royal message. No
demonstration greets his first official
reappearance on the scene. Varied
opinions expressed upon his conduct of
affairs during all-night sitting. Some
say more generous distillation of his
characteristic winsomeness would have
shortened proceedings. Others discern
in succession of stormy scenes an
organised plot above Gangway opposite
Treasury bench to “take it out of ’’ an
obnoxious Minister.
From that point of view WINSTON's
bellicose attitude defensible. The worst
that may be said of him has already
been hymned by a French poet:
Cet animal est très méchant ;
Quand on l'attaque il se défen l.
However that be, here he is at
Table, submitting in suavest manner
“another proof of the gracious con-
sideration His MAJESTY shows for the
convenience of his faithful Commons.”
Goes on to explain that it takes the
form of desiring that the House shall
be represented by Mr. SPEAKER at the
solemnities of the Coronation. “Leaving
other Members to go to Westminster
in the manner most convenient to
themselves,” WINSTON cheerily adds,
thinking of the scramble for the best
laces.

down spirits of Members in opening

one would connect with his placid
countenance, his measured monotony
of utterance, the level flow of
what promised to be interminable
verbiage.
The MEMBER For SARK estimates that
in time of threatened invasion MURRAY
MACDoNALD's services to the State
would be equal in value to at least one
Dreadnought. If he were to go down,
accost the enemy and threaten to talk
for an hour's length in the manner and

would, at end of first twenty minutes,
fold his tents like the Arab and as
silently steel away.

sitting. Irish Members thoroughly
enjoyed the outing. Reminded them
of old times when Joseph GILLIs
BIGGAR was yet with them. With
glistening eyes they told each other of
the morning when JoEY B., having
slept for a couple of hours on two chairs
in the Library, returned to the wearied
House and, drawing himself up to his
full height of five feet, addressing the
Chair, remarked, “Mr. SPEAKER, Sir, I
have had a comfortable sleep and have
come back like a giant refreshed.”
Other times, other manners. At
present epoch not for Irish Members
to play the part of obstruction. Theirs
rather to sit and watch amateurs at the
game, refraining from speechmaking
but contributing to uproar the blast of
three-score voices brought into fine
condition at recent General Election.
It was after one such outburst that
CRAIG interposed.
“If it is of any assistance to you,
Sir," he said, addressing DEPUTY
CHAIRMAN of CoMMITTEEs, “we will, if
you only give the word, put the whole
of the §. Party out of the
EIouse.”
Nothing could exceed the courtesy
of the gallant CAPTAIN's way of putting
the thing, or the blandness of his
manner. Had he been volunteering
to go and get an orange for the tired
DEPUTY CHAIRMAN he would have
spoken just so. Observe also the
deference to constituted authority.
Possibly nothing would please the
CAPTAIN more than full liberty to cross
the Gangway and engage Mr. McWEAGH
and Mr. DEVLIN in a bout of fisticuffs,
“one down the other come on,” as we
used to say at school. But he was
not the man to press personal predilec-
tion unduly. It was for the DEPUTY
CHAIRMAN to decide. “If it is of any
assistance to you, Sir.”
WHITLEY in Chair at the moment, not
recalling any precedent for proposed
procedure, made no sign of acquiescence.
After brief pause, their breath almost
literally taken away by audacity of
suggestion, the Redmondites broke into
a howl of defiance that would have
shaken the rafters had there chanced
to be any.
There the matter ended for the time.
But Party below Gangway too old
campaigners to be taken at disadvant-
age. No one knows what may happen
when two desperadoes from Ulster
like Captains CRAIG and WILLIAM
MooRE. (6 ft. 44 in. in his socks) put
their heads together. Accordingly
Irish camp put in condition of defence
ready to resist any attempt to carry it
by storm.
At council of war held at Head-
quarters (Committee-room No. 15) it
was resolved that LoNG John O'Connor
should be placed in forefront of ex-
pected battle. If in pursuance of the
sporting offer of Friday morning CRAIG
and MooRE swoop down with intent to
“put the whole of the Nationalist
Party out of the House,” they will
have to begin with LoNG John. His
exit will necessarily be slow, and during
process of effecting it opportunity will
be afforded to consider second move in
defensive tactics.
Probably Mr. SLAviN will next be
the Ulsterman's burden. Experience
nothing new to him. Years ago, in
time of Mr. GULLY's Speakership, he
was carried out on the shoulders of
eight policemen, trolling forth as he
went the plaintive melody, “God save
Ireland.” Has never been quite the
same man since. Provoking air of
respectability, apparently resultant
upon this close contact with constituted
authority, has taken the place of earlier
exuberance. Possibly fresh experience
on altered lines may have effect of
shaking him up into semblance of his
former self.

MARCH 22, 1911.] PUNCH, or THE LONDON CHARIVARL 213
I begin by crossing off the careers
that I can possibly do without, and
am just about to decide whether I will
be an Actor or an Actress, an Aeronaut
or an Art needleworker, when a sad and
bitter thought distracts me.
How many born Almoners, Actuaries
and Antique furniture dealers may there
be who, through lack of the necessary
sevenpence, will eke out their lives
earning a mere pittance and wasting
“the energy and brain which, properly
applied, would lead them to fortune?”
It is in the midst of this sorrowful
reflection that my own tragedy becomes
apparent to me.
On bringing to the surface my latent
ambition (as requested by the promoters
of this noble scheme) I find that I
crave for fame and fortune only as a
Xylographer, a Yachtsman or a Zoolo-
gist. In any other profession I should
be wasting my time; my heart would
not be in my work. But find me a
position in any of the above capacities
—tell me “How to start,” “What I
shall earn,' and ‘My prospects of
great success,’ and I am willing, nay,
anxious, to put my whole soul into the
work to-morrow.
But
A cruel fate has decreed that for a
whole year I must curb my impatience,
for a whole year I must wait, for a
whole year I must watch our future
Admiralty Officials, Bush - rangers,
Curates, etc., being put upon the path
to fortune before my need can be
considered.
There is, however, one consolation
that remains to me. With ‘750 well-
paid professions’ welcoming the career-
seekers with open arms I am inclined
to hope that by the time we reach
* X' I shall meet with little or no com-
petition.”

DISILLUSIONED.
THE card was just an ordinary card,
The letter just an ordinary letter.
The letter simply said, “Dear Mr. Brown,
I'm asked by Mrs. Phipp to send you this;"
The card said, “Mrs. Philby Phipp At Home,”
And in a corner, “Dancing, 10 P.M.,”
No more—except a date, a hint in French
That a reply would not be deemed offensive,
And, most important, Mrs. Phipp's address.
Destiny, as the poets have observed
(Or will do shortly) is a mighty thing.
It takes us by the ear and lugs us firmly
Down different paths towards one common goal,
Paths pre-appointed, not of our own choosing:
Or sometimes throws two travellers together,
Marches them side by side for half a mile,
Then snatches them apart and hauls them onward.
Thus happened it that Mrs. Phipp and I
Had never met to any great extent,
Had never met, as far as I remembered,
At all . . . . And yet there must have been a time
When she and 1 were very near together,
When someone told her, “That is Mr. Brown,”
Or introduced us “ This is Mr. Brown,”
Or asked her if she'd heard of Mr. Brown ;
I know not what, I only know that now
She stood At Home in need of Mr. Brown,
And I had pledged myself to her assistance.
Behold me on the night, the latest word
In all that separates the gentleman
And waiters from the evening-dress-less mob,
And graced, moreover, by the latest word
In waistcoats such as mark one from the waiters,
My shirt, I must not speak about my shirt;
My tie, I cannot dwell upon my tie–
Enough that all was neat, harmonious,
And suitable to Mrs. Philby Phipp.
Behold me, then, complete. A hasty search
To find the card, and reassure myself
That this is certainly the day—(It is)—
And 10 P.M. the hour; “P.M.,” not “A.M.,”
Not after breakfast—good ; and then outside
To jump into a cab and take the winds,
The cold east winds of March, with beauty. So.
Let us get on more quickly. Looms ahead
Tragedy. Let us on and have it over.
I hung with men and women on the stairs
And watched the tall white footman take the names,
And heard him shout them out, and there I shaped
My own name ready for him, “Mr. Brown.”
And Mrs. Philby Phipp, hearing the name,
Would, I imagined, brighten suddenly
And smile and say, “How are you, Mr. Brown?”
And in an instant I'd remember her,
And where we met, and who was Mr. Phipp,
And all the jolly time at Grindelwald
(If that was where it was); and she and I
Would talk of Art and Politics and things
As we had talked these many years ago. . . .
So “Mr. Brown "I murmured to the footman,
And he—the fool!—he took a mighty breath
And shouted, “Mr. BROWNIE!” – Browniel Yes,
He shouted “Mr. BROWNIE" to the roof.
And Mrs. Philby Phipp, hearing the name,
I3rightened up suddenly and smiled and said,
“How are you, Mr. Brownie?”—(Browniel Lord!)
And, while my mouth was open to protest,
“How do you do?” to some one at the back.
So I was passed along into the crowd
As Browniel
Who on earth is Mr. Brownie’
Did he, I wonder, he and Mrs. Phipp
Talk Art and Politics at Grindelwald,
Or did one simply point him out to her
With “That is Mr. Brownie” 2 Were they friends,
Dear friends or casual acquaintances?
She brightened at his name, some memory
Came back to her that brought a happy smile—
Why surely they were friends ! But I am Brown,
A stranger, all unknown to Mrs. Phipp,
As she to me, a common interloper—
I see it now—an uninvited guest,
Whose card was clearly meant for Mr. Brownie.
Soft music fell, and the kaleidoscope
Of lovely woman glided, swayed and turned
Beneath the shaded lights; but Mr. Brownie
(Né Brown, not Brownie) stood upon one side
And brooded silently. Some spoke to him ;
Whether to Brown or Brownie mattered not,
He did not answer, did not notice them,
Just stood and brooded . . . . Then went home to bed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. SMALLEY has brought the business of London
Letter-writing nearer to the sacred skirts of Literature
than any practitioner I know. A keen observer, with a
perhaps uniquely wide range of acquaintance with men
who make history, his style has a recurrent mordancy
probably more agreeable to the reader than to the subject
of his commentary. In Anglo-American Memories (DUCK-
worth) he has culled from his weekly contributions
to a New York newspaper the flower of his writing con-
tinued throughout more than half a century.
English readers may possibly be most interested in his
crystallised talk about persons on this side of the
Atlantic. They include Sir GEORGE TREvrºxAN, Lord
MINTo, Lord GREY, Lord KITCHENER, Sir GEORGE
LEwis, Lord RANDolph CHURCHILL, Lord GLENESK and
Lord St. HELIER. Nor, greatly daring, does he shrink
from dealing with the personality of some ladies, stars in
the firmament of London Society. I confess I find deeper
and more abiding in-
time, and each time is more surprising than the last, the
martyr of the outrageous idea became the hero of the
astounding achievement, till people came to wonder what he
would do next and to be of opinion that he was a re-
markable fellow. Denry, having always shared the general
wonder, is not long in fully endorsing the popular opinion.
His real name was Edward Henry, and, from that name
and the nickname into which it was contracted, you may
guess what an offensive creature he was and yet how there
was something very likeable about him. He tails off a
little towards the end of his career, but there he is only
human ; for to succeed is one thing, but to go on being
successful is another and much less amusing. If you
have a right appreciation of the author, you will prefer to
make for yourself the acquaintance of his Denry. Be duly
grateful to me, therefore, for telling you that the book in
which this may be done is The Card (METHUEN).
One may well overlook a certain light-hearted looseness
of design in John Winterbourne's Family (Constable) for
terest in the first half
of the volume, in
which from personal
knowledge he traces
the growth of the
American Civil War

war, revealing to the
present generation how nearly the issue of the struggle
justified Mr. GLADstone's memorable indiscretion, when he
hailed JEFFERSoN DAvis as the creator of a nation.
Mr. SMALLEY's greatest achievement as a newspaper
correspondent was his interview with Bismarck in 1866,
when aft: ' 'Xóniggrätz Prussia emerged from long obscurity.
Of quite other kind, scarcely less interesting, are the
intimate picture-portraits of EMERSoN, WENDEL PHILLIPs
and CHARLEs SUMNER. These letters, when they appeared in
a Sunday newspaper, commanded wide attention and wielded
much influence on public affairs. Proof of their rare quality
is found in the fact that they are fresh in interest to-day.
The succès fou of sheer impudence is no new theme, but
it has remained for Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT to appreciate the
exact feelings of the pusher and to trace the true origin of
his push. Denry was not naturally impudent (he was far.
too shrewd and calculating for that), but he was, in
business and love alike, subject to fits of impulse which led
him willy-nilly into acts of extreme cheekiness. Inasmuch
as these impulses always conduced to the most profitable
ends, he felt bound to obey them all, cursing himself the
while for the most unhappily obsessed of fools. Time after
– pains for their right
appreciation. One of them—Celia—remained for me a
mystery to the end; but most of the o hers, even if some
of them could never have existed in fact, are a triumph
of pure creative force. Her sense of unspoiled beauty in
the virgin type that comes nearest to the heart of savage
Nature recalls the art of Mr. THOMAS HARDY; and her
way with children Mr. BARRIE himself could not better.
But there are chapters in this book of hers that neither
of these masters, nor both of them together, could have
achieved. Winterbourne's personality, in its relation to
little children, to Mother Earth, to THEocritus, to the
adopted girl who dumbly adored him, and to the wife whose
intrusions, sentimental or worldly, roused him alternately to
Olympian laughter and Olympian wrath, would arrest the
imagination in any company of the memorable characters
of fiction. I don't know what proportion of due honour
is enjoyed by ALICE BRown as a prophet in her own
country, but I know I sincerely envy America the
possession of her genius.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DETACHMENT OF PRENDERBY.
ON ARBITRATION.
“WELL,” I said, “I hope you approve of the TAFT-GREY
scheme of arbitration ?”
“My dear fellow,” said Prenderby, “ of course I approve
of it. I am all for schemes of that sort—the Millennium,
for instance, and Utopia and Paradise. But I permit my-
self to doubt whether a family arrangement of this kind
between two nations who have already practised the habit
of arbitration for the settlement of their trifling differences
is going to be allowed to serve as a lofty example to a
world not yet prepared to follow lofty examples. I'm
afraid I have a very poor opinion of national morality.
Governments may consist of very honourable Christian
gentlemen, but do they, in their composite capacity,
ever behave to other Governments like gentlemen, not to
say Christians? One does not expect them to love their
neighbours better than themselves, but are they ever
actuated by any but the most crudely savage instincts 2 do
they ever “forbear their own advantage,” or decline to
hit a rival when he's down or looking the other way,
if it suits their convenience? The very qualities which in
an individual would be regarded as the mark of an
.impossible bounder, are in a Government accounted for
virtue and patriotism. “God and my Right,’ as we say
(cheerfully implicating the Deity); not the Right, if you
please, but my Right.”
“But surely,” said I, “whether they follow our example
or not. other nations must regard our motives in this
matter as purely humane 2"
“I)ear fellow,” said Prenderby, “does any nation ever
regard the motives of another nation as purely humane?
When the two great Teutonic Powers agreed to settle their
differences in a lasting alliance, did we acclaim their
motives as purely humane 2 And these peoples, in their
turn, whatever praise they may publicly bestow on our
scheme, will tell one another privately that our motives
to-day are a matter of mere expediency; that England is
saying to America, ‘Look here; you and I speak the
same language or something like it; let us agree to put
our differences to arbitration and abide by the results,
however obnoxious to either party, that so we may hold
our own together against the rest of the world !”
“Well,” I said, “I daresay that's what is at the back of
some of our heads. Put neither nation is ready for it yet.
Indeed, it seems doubtful whether the American Senate
is ready even for a harmless treaty of arbitration. That's
the worst of these Second Chambers!”
“Your observation,” said Prenderby, “interests me
strangely, for it starts me on our own Second Chamber, a
topic germane to our theme. Here is Edward GREY pro-
pounding, to the open applause of the civilised world with
its motto Video meliora probogue, deteriora sequor, a scheme
which he hopes may lead eventually to the universal
reduction of armaments. But what is his attitude in
regard to a domestic matter equally clamorous for a peace-
ſul adjustment 2 He belongs to, and apparently endorses
the policy of, a Party which has no idea of submitting the
case of the House of Lords to arbitration, but proposes to
destroy it by the sheer brutal force of superior numbers.”
“At any rate,” said I, “as between the various com-
ponents of that Party you find the spirit of mutual
concession. You find Liberals, Labour Members and Irish
Nationalists compromising their own differences for the
common good.”
“But for whose ‘common good'?” said Prenderby
petulantly. “For the common good of the State 2 Not
at all. They combine for the common good of the Party
as against the Party's common foe—the very motive which
Europe will attribute to us in our scheme for an Anglo-
American treaty of arbitration.”
“Well,” I said smartly, “don’t the Tories do the same
thing when they get the chance?”
“No doubt,” replied Prenderby judiciously. “In general
I have no greater regard for one side than for the other.
But in the case of the House of Lords even you will admit
that the Tories have in this Parliament offered to assist the
Government in arriving at a compromise by consent, and
that their overtures have been ignored.
“My point is this:—If your prophet (whom I honestly
respect) claims to be leading a crusade not merely for the
particular advantage of his own country, or even that of the
English-speaking race; if he asserts a higher and broader
motive; if it is the acceleration of Universal Peace that he
is aſter; then let him ask himself whether England might
not contrive to set the nations an example with the sort of
piety that begins at home. We talk at large of the intoler-
able burden and extravagance of bloated armaments, but
never seem to worry ourselves about the infamous waste of
time and material and energy that is the curse of a Parlia-
mentary system which in the end always decides things
by the mere weight of heavier battalions. There is not a
single controversial matter in our home politics that could
not be settled by twelve good men and true endowed
with common sense and impartiality. We are willing
to leave the question of a man's life or death in the hands
of a common jury, but the destiny of a nation is left to the
mercy of a voting-machine. On the day when we establish
a domestic Hague tribunal at our doors I shall begin to
have some hope for the Dutch one.”
“At this point,” I said, “I will break it to you that my
purpose in coming to see you to-day was to procure copy
for a humorous paper. You haven't helped me much.”
“I am laughing all right,” said Prenderby, “at the
pitifulness and poverty of national ideals; but in my
sleeve, for decency's sake. But you, with your visions of a
New Earth, a land flowing with milk and arbitration—I
wonder that you complain of my dulness. In Utopia there
will be no accommodation for humour.”
“That's all right,” said I cheerfully; “it won't be in my
time.” O. S.
The following epigram is attributed by a calendar to
Lào-TszE, whose works we must certainly read again:—
“Intelligence is formed by minute observation; and strength by the
conversation of the germs of vital energy.”
Conversation between Two Germs : —
1st Germ: Well, we've managed to give our man a
cold at last. He's sneezing like anything.
2nd Germ: He's not really sneezing; he's only saying
“LAo-TszE” to himself.
From a Manchester newspaper:-
“Anything that will set the blood into active circulation is good for a
cold. Bathe the ſcet in hot water and drink hot water, or hot
lemonade, on going to bed; take a salt water sponge bath and remain
in a warm room. Bathe the face in very hot water every five minutes
for an hour or so. Snuff hot salt water up the nose every hour or
two. Four or five hours' exercise in the open air is often effective.
Four or five grains of quinine taken at night will usually have a
good effect. A vapour bath, followed by a cold sponge bath, is good.”
The great thing seems to be—Keep it moving.
“Even in this old university town we can step from noble colleges,
which are graced by antique chapels, quaint cloisters, perfect lawns,
and stately trees, into ſoul sums which are the incarnation of ugliness.”
Manchester Evening Newcº,
So we found when going in for the Mathematical ºripos,

JUST three short years ago—no more than three–
When yet our faith was perfectly intact,
Upwards we soared on wings of prophecy,
Beaming like Cheshire kittens in the act.
That flight was wasted, Thomas;
The Chicks have not fulfilled their dazzling promise.
We had good cause, old boy, for hopeful pride—
The Chicks, our Chirpy Chicks, were runners-up!
And rapturously we rose and prophesied
That in a year or two they'd win the Cup.
But did they 2 Not a bit.
Each time since then they've made a hash of it.
We've never failed them, Tom. We're not to blame.
We've done our duty; what can man do more?
We've spared no sacrifice to see each game
(Proving that we are sportsmen to the core);
We've yelled like crazy fellows,
And cheered until we nearly burst our bellows.
We've stuck to them through changes. We have seen
Old favourites sold, whose strength we ill could spare;
We've hailed new men from Bristol, Aberdeen,
From Wales, from Ireland, from the Lord knows where;
We've even helped, my son,
To purchase them, and now they haven't won
And so you'll chuck the Chicks: you've lost your wool;
Henceforth the Bluebirds have your whole support.
Thomas, I share your anger to the full;
Don't think I blame you—nothing of the sort;
But, for at least a season,
I'll hold my ground. I have a sporting reason.
It's Local Sentiment. The Chirpy Chicks'
Headquarters are but thirty miles away;
The Bluebirds', as you know, are fifty-six;
That is the reason, Thomas, why I stay
(If there's another loss,
I'll throw them up and come and join you, Thos.).

From an advt. :—
“While the seal is on the bottle, the collar round the neck, the
cork (with ——'s brand) inside and the capsule over that, you are
absolutely safe.”
Are we to understand that it is when the bottle is opened
that the danger begins?
“There is a remarkable family at Rosedale, in which for a period of
35 years there has not been a death. Five of the sons have played
various instruments in the Brotton Brass Band."—Malton Messenger.
If the band is as brotton as it sounds this immunity is
indeed surprising.

[MARch 29, 1911.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HALF-TOLD TALE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Your reputation
for sympathy with those in trouble is
growing daily. It extends now, from
Finchley in the north to Hayes in the
south, and perhaps further. I will state
my trouble and then we shall see if you
can help me.
Do you know Hayes at all 2 It is,
I believe, a village or suburban town
in Kent or Surrey. I have never
been to Hayes, but I can tell a good
story about it. It is not the sort
of good story with which you cap
the other man's good story about
WINston CHURCHILL; nor is it just an
ordinary joke which a friend might
borrow and narrate as having happened
to himself. It is simply a little personal
adventure connecting myself with
| Hayes, pleasant, if a trifle subtle in its
| humour; and while it is not necessary
to know Hayes well in order to appre-
ciate it, it is, I think, necessary to
know me. -
I was calling on Mrs. X. last Sunday.
There were only three or four people
in the drawing-room, so that the con-
versation was general. My modest
share in it had been temporarily cut
short by a large slice of cake, when
suddenly my ears caught the word
“Hayes.” It happens sometimes that
the word Hayes is spoken in my
presence, and that, before I have time
to do anything about it, the conversa-
tion is switched on to some other topic.
Such certainly might have been the
case upon this occasion; but by great
good luck quite a little argument arose
about Hayes. One said it was near
Croydon, and another knew it was in
Buckinghamshire, and Mrs. X. smooth-
ed matters over by suggesting that
there were probably two or three towns
of that name. :
I wonder if you can realise, Mr.
Punch, all that this meant to me—for
by this time I had finished my piece of
cake. My story, subtle, delicate gos-
samer thing that it is, depends abso-
under which it is told. It cannot, it
simply cannot be dragged in. There
are some houses to which one may go
for years without ever hearing the
place Hayes so much as mentioned,
and to attempt to tell the story in
houses like these is simply to ruin it.
So now to hear Hayes not only
mentioned but dwelt upon, better even
than that (for the point of my story
depends largely upon the exact position
in the map of Hayes), actually to hear
doubts expressed as to its locality—
this was, Mr. Punch, the chance of
my life.
“I’ve often wondered where Hayes
lutely for its success upon the conditions|.
was,” I said with a little laugh,
“because—well, it was rather ſunny; ”
and I smiled reminiscently to myself.
They all looked at me inquiringly.
They seemed to know somehow that a
good story was coming. I took a sip
of tea and began.
As I have said, it is simply a pleasant
little story connecting myself with
Hayes. The interest in Hayes was by
this time at fever-heat, and I knew the
few people in the room well enough to
assume at any rate a temporary and
polite interest in myself. But this
much must be admitted. Good story
though it is, it begins badly. The first
few minutes of it are very dull indeed.
The first few minutes descend of
necessity to depths of apparently point-
less autobiography such as nobody
should permit himself to dive into
beforea mixed company—unless for vital
reasons. My own reasons, of course,
were that the finish would more than
reward my hearers' patience; but also
I began to feel this: I began to feel
that the mere fact of having ready an
appropriate story, however dull, about
such an unlikely place as Hayes was
in itself a justification. It was the
duty of my audience to regard me as a
man who could tell a story of some
sort about any town on the map.
Well, Mr. Punch, I had cleared the
ground of the necessary introductory
matter, and I was just arriving at the
point where I get the anonymous
letter from Finchley—in other words,
my story was on the verge of becoming
interesting, which interest would
steadily increase henceforward to the
dénouement—when an interruption
took place. The door opened and
about half-a-dozen fresh people were
announced. There were greetings,
some introductions, and a little
handing of refreshments. We were
too many now for general conversation,
and I found myself paired with one of
the newcomers upon a very comfort-
able sofa. We talked, I think, about
theatres. It was a very pleasant talk
... but I was not happy. I left
about half-an-hour later.
You see, my story stopped at the
wrong moment. I don't blame any-
body. I could hardly have been asked
to go on with it in front of half a-dozen
strangers who had missed the opening:
and I am not sure that I should have
cared to have begun it all over again.
The beginning is so very dull. Besides
it is too autobiographical to tell to a
complete stranger; you would want to
have talked to her for ten minutes or
so first about general matters. But I
repeat that my story stopped at the
wrong moment. There is a little lull
before the anonymous letter from
Finchley, and it seemed to stop there
quite naturally. I have not the slightest
doubt that my audience thought that it
was meant to stop there—that what I
told them was the whole story.
Mr. Punch, we all have moments of
black doubt when even the things
dearest and most familiar to us assume
strange shapes. At some such black
moment I may have doubted whether
my Hayes story was quite as brilliant
as I have sometimes thought it. But
never have I had any doubt that the
first half of the story, regarded as a
complete whole, was the most utterly
futile thing ever told by man. That is
the story which the X.'s think I sat
down deliberately to tell them. . . .
When I began this letter I had meant
to ask you to help me. I had thought
that if you gave us a cartoon on Hayes
next Wednesday I might call on Mrs. X.
on the Thursday, mention Punch
casually, and so get by way of the cartoon
up to my own connection with Hayes.
But I see now that I shall never tell the
X.'s the Hayes story again. I might be
stopped a second time at the same place.
That would be too terrible. They may
think me an egoistic bore if they like:
they mustn't think me an obsessed
lunatic. Your unhappy friend,

THE SENSATIONAL WINKLE
CASE.
[“At a me ting of the Kent and Essex Fisheries
Committee it was reported that the Board of
Fisheries had been appealed to on the subject of
the protection of winkles on private grounds, a
Kentish be ch of magistrates having held that
winkles were wild animals, and for that reason
they dismissed a charge of stealing. The Com-
mittee was advised that the cultivation of
winkles on private grounds would tame them.”
—Daily Pup. r.]
IN the course of proceedings before
the Board of Fisheries evidence was
heard on behalf of the Kentish magis-
trates, the owner of the grounds from
which the winkles were abducted, and
the colony of winkles occupying those
grounds. Counsel for the magistrates
maintained that such abduction did
not amount to stealing, inasmuch as
winkles were wild animals.
A member of the Board: That is what
you have to prove.
Counsel : I propose to do so.
In an impassioned address counse!
declared that he would bring evidence
to prove that winkles were a most
ferocious species of mollusc, a social
pest, and in particular a positive
menace to the lives of little children.
For years it had been their brutal
practice to lie in wait for passers-by
on solitary parts of the coast at low
tide. They would seize upon their
victims in overwhelming numbers, and

adhere to them with fierce tenacity
The sight of a bather's bare foot was
always sufficient to rouse them to a lust
for blood. In fact, he maintained that
no human being was safe in the
presence of a winkle unless armed
with a sledge-hammer or a pin.
Evidence having been taken in sup-
port of counsel's statements, Mr.
Winkle and Mr. Perry Winkle, who
had been much affected by the asper-
sions cast upon their tribe, were then
examined.
A member of the Board: You are
a representative of , the colony in
question ?—Mr. Winkle: I am.
Have you any answer to make to
the evidence adduced with regard to
your attacks on human beings—par-
ticularly the bathing episodes which
have been referred to 2–Mr. Winkle: I
maintain they are gross perversions of
the truth. Human beings act in the
most ungentlemanly manner towards
us, coming upon us almost invariably
at meal-times, and not giving us time
to move out of the way.
Mr. Winkle was followed by Mr.
Perry Winkle, who complained bitterly
and with genuine feeling of the pro-
tection afforded to whelks and mussels,
whom he characterised as “abandoned
Borgias,” and declared that it was
their practice to feed upon the un-
offending winkle tribe after they (the
whelks and mussels) had poisonel
them (the winkles) by means of the
sulphuric acid they (the whelks and
mussels) were in the habit of secreting.
Mr. Perry Winkle, whose evidence
caused a great sensation, was followed
by Mr. Snodgrass, the owner of the
grounds from which the winkles had
been abducted. Questioned whether
he thought that winkles, even though
originally.wild, could be tamed by cul-
tivation on private grounds, Mr. Snod-
grass, who was evidently regarded with
Mr. Perry Winkle, answered warmly in
the affirmative. He stated that he had
always considered the winkles on his
property as personal friends, and would
their company for hours at a time.
They were so tame that they would eat
out of his hand and come to him when
he whistled. He regarded this matter
horror and consternation.

representative left.

THE HOUSE ON HOLIDAY.
[A certain newspaper has recently informed us that, “like the rest of
humanity, the House of Commons has its moods,” and there are times
when “Members, both young and old, like boys just released from
school, break out into boisterous mirth, and indulge in the most
frolicsome antics.”]
AND I was in the gallery that night ! . . . .
Asquith began it—mind you, it was but
The merest lull, succeeding some grim fight,
That turned them from their customary rut.
The House of Commons, like the rest of mortals
(Perhaps you never thought of that before ?)
Has got its moods: within those sacred portals
Our legislators sometimes slough their lore
And try to make things hum, when life becomes a bore.
AsquitH, I say, began it. Full of beans,
He hoisted up his slack and cried, “Ahoy!
BALFour, old man, suppose we find some means
Of killing time?”
Nor yet was HALDANE loth, but, rising up, he
Offered the House a reckless challenge: “Who'll
Stake tuppence on a game of bumble-puppy 2 ”
And others gambolled too, like boys from school;
There were that leapt, and some that played at snooker pool.
CECIL and HoRNE (SILVESTER), lithe of limb,
Requested REDMOND to “provide a back."
And played at leap-frog with the utmost vim
Till CECIL's head sustained a nasty crack.
WINSTON and F. E. SMITH, a wrestling couple,
Circled about to get a decent squeeze,
And both appeared distinctly fit and supple;
While all the time the SPEAKER sat at ease
And peppered everyone impartially with peas.
A game of marbles soon was going strong,
And WINTERTON and CARson won applause
From all the cognoscenti in the throng
By artful knuckling of the alley-taws.
And here one might observe the stately AUSTEN,
Who, though at play, preserved a proper tone,
Poised on one nimble foot and wholly lost in
A little game of hopscotch on his own—
A topping game, but one inadequately known.
I did not mark the antics of the rest,
For, just as BIRRELL offered trifling odds
That F. E. SMITH would sit on WINSTON's chest,
The SPEAKER started potting at the gods.
We went confusedly, but as we hastened
From that high fane St. Stephen holds in fee
I cried aloud with joy, albeit chastened,
“These lofty men who write themselves M.P.
Enjoy their little jape even like you and me!”
From “Answers to Correspondents” in The Birmingham
Daily Post:-
“‘Anxious."—The Bishop of Birmingham, who was born in 1853, is
a bachelor.” * . -
We hope this is the good news that “Anxious ” wanted.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEO-PRANDIALISM.
MR. CHISHol.M., the Editor of the
Greatest of Great Works, having pre-
sided at a series of dinners to its
English contributors last autumn and
being now engaged on a similar feat in
America, is himself to be entertained
at dinner on his return. And why
not ? Let there be dinners and then
more dinners. Let a dinner celebrate
everything.
As a contribution to the New Pran-
dialism we suggest that the following
banquets are more than due —
A complimentary dinner to Mr. SHAw
by the road hogs of England in honour
of the courageous stand taken by him
in The Car against the hysterical op-
position to running over their pets
which is displayed by too many dog-
owners. Mr. SHAw candidly admits
that he has run over thirteen and only
twice has stopped to apologise. Such
a lead from so eminent a humanitarian
cannot be too cordially acknowledged.
A dinner to Lady SELBoRNE to be
given by sympathisers with her on the
trying time she has recently undergone
in her endeavour to establish a new
and more elastic method of corre-
spondence in the papers. It has long
been felt that to sign one's own name
to a letter was at best mechanical.
Lady SELBoRNE has boldly come for-
ward to put an end to this tedious
practice by signing some one else's.
Only a dinner—and a very good one—
can properly bring home to her mind
the benefit she has conferred both on
the cause of women's franchise and
woman at large. The Chair will be
taken by Lady CoNSTANCE LYTTON.
It has long been felt by the friends
of Sir Edwin DURNING-LAWRENCE,
Bart., the great Baconian littérateur,
that public expression should be given
to the gratitude and appreciation of
his gigantic labours under which the
cultured section of the community has
so long groaned. This sentiment has
now taken concrete shape in the pro-
posal to entertain Sir Edwin at , a
banquet, at which the Chair will be
taken by Dr. O. Owen, the eminent
American savant, who is now assidu-
ously delving in the bed of the Wye,
near Chepstow, for BACON's lost note-
books. Mr. G. G. GREEN wood has
also kindly promised to attend and
will oblige with the sentiment, “It's
a long lane that knows no Durning.”
Any attempt to enliven the drab
monotony of male attire is always to
be welcomed, and it is with great
pleasure that we learn of the general
support leant to the suggestion to
give a fancy-dress dinner to Mr. Josiah
WEdgwood, M.P., for his noble attempt
lº
=|
“WELL, ToMMy, caught ANYTHING !”
“No, I Don't BELIEVE THE
silly won M was TRYING."
to introduce velvet coats into the
House of Commons. Mr. L. GINNELL,
M.P., who has consented to take the
Chair, will appear as an Irish cow-
puncher, and Mr.JEREMIAH MACWEAGH,
M.P., will probably assume the en-
gaging disguise of a South Down
shepherd. Welvet or velveteen will be
de rigueur for all who attend the
banquet, at which it is understood
there will be no Speakers.
As side issues of the revival in com-
memorative dining we may state that
the Savoy Hotel is about to open a new
grill room tº be known as the Chisholm,
with a twenty-five shilling inclusive
lunch for scholars. Be sure to ask for
Encyclo. Brut champagne.
The Great Eastern Railway Company
are adding to the Cambridge noon ex-
press every day a dining car especially
reserved for officials of the University
Press and contributors to the Phenom-
enal Compilation.
Lastly we may note, as a pleasing
illustration of the popularity of the New
Prandialism, the inclusion at more
than one of the leading music-halls of
a turn in which the performer, d propos
of nothing in particular, eats three
large dinners one after another, champ-
ing his teeth in perfect time with the
music. At the same time we under-
stand there is no truth in the report
that the charming MLLE. BRITTA has
assumed the Christian name of ENCY.
Festina Lente—“Easter will soon be
here.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, March
20.-Heard much of late of the mil-
lennium near at hand, when Ireland,
refusing to be happy till she gets it,
shall have Home Rule. Captain CRAIG,
back again after carrying out LoNG
John, not disposed to regard prospect
with unqualified pleasure.
“What about Irish stocks?” he asks.
“Does the PRIME MINISTER know that
since Home Rule was mentioned by
the Government the price of Irish
securities has appreciably fallen?”
Later LoNSDALE raises
blighted the hopes of Ireland. St.
AUGUSTINE’s glance resting upon the
pretty scene was dimmed by a tear of
sympathy. It was a slight thing,
incidentally arising out of accidental
contiguity. The seeing eye discerned
in it token of millennium.
“By-and-by,” ST. AUGUSTINE mur-
mured, “we shall see John REDMOND
walking on the Terrace with Captain
CRAIG, passing by a table at which are
stated WILLIAM MooRE and JoHN
DILLON, while, like, great Anna (since
dead), whom three realms obey, they

times tea.’”
more amazed than he at sensation
created by his utterance. Intended as
expression of personal feeling, welcoming
suggestion thrown out by PRESIDENT
OF UNITED STATEs. And lo! it turns
out to have been a trumpet call, not
summoning to war but to peace on
earth and goodwill among the nations.
GREY instinctively shrinks from
private congratulations, public compli-
ments, and the like. Has much in
common with the DUKE of DEvoN-
SHIRE long known to Commons as
Lord HARTINGTON. HARTINGTON did not
care a brass farthing for anything people
said or thought or wrote about him.
At the bottom of his
similar objection. Like
bonnets, tin, bootlaces
and other industries
whose condition was
noticed at time of
launching Tariff Reform
propaganda, Irish bank
stock is “going ” —
down. ST. AUGUSTINE
BIRRELL points out that
price of Bank of Ireland
stock is subject to causes
affecting similar stock
in United Kingdom.
Only that, and nothing

LoNSDALE shook his |
head incredulously. A
student of history, he
remembers how in times
past the policy of the
Whigs at a particular
juncture led to disastrous
multiplication of large
bluebottle flies in but-
chers'shops. The Whigs
of the day strenuously
denied that they were in
any measure responsible
for the incursion, just as

It means that the wealthiest nation
in the world has out of its total expen-
diture of a trifle under 172 millions
contributed so much to the cost of
expedition led by Captain Scott in
search of South Pole. Better than
nothing, it is less than one-half of
actual cost, estimated at a minimum
of £50,000. Gallant little New Zealand
has planked down £1,000; United South
Africa, £500; a princely Australian
subscribes £2,500, which, with con-
tributions from the public, brings up
amount to nearly £44,000, leaving
deficit of £6,000.
This a weight which throughout his
perilous journey over trackless waste of
snow Captain Scott will find heavier to
draw than the most fully-laden sleigh.
He started on his enterprise cheered
by national applause, but depressed by
consciousness that he was handicapped
by what, if matters remain as they
stand, means impending bankruptcy.
Long ago Mr. Micawber put great
economical truth in classical nutshell.

In the lengthened night under
Antarctic skies Captain Scott will be
doing an analogous sum : “Expendi-
ture, £50,000; cash subscribed, £44,000:
result, misery. Cost of expedition,
£50,000; subscriptions, say £55,000 to
cover emergencies: result, happiness.”
The first news from England that
can reach the little party of explorers
will as near as can be calculated arrive
on Christmas day, 1912, when the Terra
Ncra returns from New Zealand to the
Antarctic to take fresh stores to the
expedition. It would be a pleasant
kind of a Christmas card if CAPTAIN
Scott's wife, who remains in London,
were able to send him word that the
full amount has been made up, leaving
him to go on his way unhampered by
the thought that every weary mile
achieved on the way to the Pole adds
to the burden of his indebtedness.

MR. PUNCH'S LITERARY ADVER-
TISEMENTS.
WHAT CESAR KNEw.
“I.ET me have men about me that
are fat,” cried JULIUS CESAR in an
inspired moment. This is one of the
most illuminating utterances recorded
in the history of the world.
Why did so great a statesman,
general, and littérateur as CESAR ex-
press this desire for an adipose entour-
age? Because he knew by experience
that for general trustworthiness and
honest ability ſat people were second
to none. Other men, in other ages,
diture, £20 ought six: result, misery."
may have discovered the same truth;
but CESAR was the first to crystallise
it into a policy, to make it the guiding
principle of his wonderful career.
To-day, however, we are in danger
of forgetting the message left to us by
the illustrious Roman. In this country,
indeed, we have largely given up the
deliberate cultivation of corpulency,
and are even beguiled at times into
removing some of our so-called
“superfluous" adiposity by means of
remedies of the “Antitum " type.
Herein the appeal is all to the eye,
to the sense of form, rather than to
the heart and brain. The ancient
Greeks made precisely the same mis-
take—they cultivated external beauty,
demanding fineness of figure, at the
expense of substance—and what is
Greece to day ? On the other hand,
how has the Turk been able to defy
the Powers all these years? Because
he has developed to the utmost his
capacity for sitting tight.
Englishmen, in the mass, seem to
have stopped their ears to the call of fat.
And yet some of our most successful
modern men follow the cult of the
obese. In almost every department of
public and private activity it will be
found that, sooner or later, rotundity
comes out on top; and once there it
stays there.

THE TONSURE TOUCH.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-A good deal has
been said about the pathos surrounding
the struggles of middle-aged women to
preserve their youth, but I feel that
members of your own sex similarly
engaged deserve even greater sympathy
because they have fewer adventitious
aids and less opportunity for practising
them. So I have invented a little
arrangement by which the out-of-doors-
man on the wrong side of fifty can
knock at least fifteen years off his age.
You will have noticed, when through
work or worry a man loses his back
hair, the line of demarcation often
appears just under his hat at the back,
and gives him away, however studiedly
youthful the rest of his appearance
may be. Few men will wear a toupee,
in spite of the pathetic efforts of their
hairdressers to make them, but there is
neither trouble nor risk attached to my
little invention.
“The Tonsure Touch" (for so I have
named it) consists of a crescent-shaped
bandeau of hair fastened inside the hat-
brim at the back, and is so placed that
it not only completely covers the ex-
posed bald area, but blends naturally
with the wearer's own hair. When
social or other duties necessitate the
lifting of the hat, the right thumb
presses a stud on the under side of the
right brim (this is, of course, reversed
in the case of left-handed wearers).
The stud is connected with a spring,
which causes the “scalpette" to fly
up inside the hat as it is raised,
while the releasing of the stud causes
the hair-flap to spring back again in
correct position as the hat is replaced
on the head.
“The Tonsure Touch" is made in all
sizes and shades, and it is only due to
myself to add that my invention will
be placed on the market at cost price,
my idea being not to make profit but
merely to add to the comfort and
happiness of a sex for which I have a
sincere respect and esteem.
Truly yours, SYMPATHETIC SPINstER.

the hips of one lady with the point of

even for a farce, but Mr. CYRII, MAUDE
braved it out, using his well-known
and popular voice-trick for all it was
worth to carry off the mildest mirth
that ever was. But it cost him many

To give the author his due, I admit
a fresh effect in his representation of
the interior of a parched well, with
the Duke and his fiancée in a cage

anticipated this dropping of a ring into
a well, but never thought of sending
Pelléas and Mélisaunde down after it.
His well was too wet. In Salome,
again, we were not privileged to see
through a brick wall into the interior of
the prophet's retreat at the bottom of the
cavity. So this was quite a fresh scheme.
Whether it will serve to impose the
play upon the general taste I dare not
conjecture. The kindly audience of
the first night were hard put to it to
counterfeit enthusiasm. Mr. ALLAN

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WRITERs of random “memories" are apt to pose rather
dishonestly as authors of a connected literary narrative, so
that it was not a bad idea of Professor Poulton's to throw
this pretence to the winds and figure in different parts of
the same book in the separate rôles of biographer, essayist
and general remembrancer. Calling his compilation John
Viriamu Jones, an l other Oxford Memories (LoNGMANs),
he begins with a sketch of the life and work of the late
Principal of Cardiff University College, goes on to various
recollections of Oxford life in the seventies, inserts a short
memoir on Professor GEORGE Roll ESTON, and concludes
with a treatise on Oxford Reform and the British
Examination system, which it would ill become me to
criticise. His stories are not always very good ones: on
Proctors, for instance, he makes the following note:–
such justice to the diverse temperaments and complex
states of mind of humanity in crucial situations. It is to
be observed that in this case what he makes up in
thoroughness he lacks in spontaneity, that his plot
produces his character rather than his character his plot,
and that neither the one nor the other is strikingly
original. But if it is inevitable to criticise, it is by no
means necessary to disparage his half-yearly production,
and Account Rendered (HEINEMANN), though nothing to
boast about as a work of art, may with all confidence be

In the first chapter of Adventure (NELsoN) we are
introduced to David Sheldon riding pick-a-back “on a
woolly-headed, black-skinned savage,” and giving medicine
to the man-eating, dysentery-stricken cannibals employed
by him in the Solomon Islands. As Sheldon was also
such a very sick man that these amiable cannibals were

MILNER, when a B.A., tell- ||º

‘proctorized' the night be-

that he was still in statu

aware of the fact,' he had
replied to the Proctor.”

interesting narratives than

an American girl of the
“get on or get out” brigade
can do. Joan had all the

MILNER made up a better
retort by the time he paid
his fine next morning. On
the whole the most interest-

by WIRLAMU Jones on EDGAR

A NEw biography of CHARLES II. is
promised for immediate publication by
Messrs. STANLEY PAUL & Co. “The
author,” we are informed by the
publishers, “is Miss DoRo THY SENIOR,
who claims descent from CHARLES II.
She has entitled her work The Gay
King, but she endeavours to show
that beneath the superficial gaiety of
CHARLEs there was a deep vein of
melancholy.” … . .
Simultaneously with this gratifying
tions of a somewhat similar character
from several other leading publishers.
Thus a new memoir of HANNIBAL, the
celebrated Carthaginian general (dux
Carthagimiensis, as dear old LIVY has
it) is announced by Messrs. Odder and
Odder. The author is Miss Dido
Barker, who is a collateral descendant
of the famous warrior, and has brought
to her task an hereditary affection
coupled with literary ability of a high
order. Her biography connects the
famous incident of the manner in
which her ancestor crossed the Alps
with his having at one time been a
large dealer in Tarragon vinegar
during his sojourn in Spain, but she
endeavours to show that beneath the
superficial acidity of his manner there
was an exuberant vein of frolicsome
humour.
Miss Ida March, so we learn from
a communiqué just issued from the firm
of Thicker and Thicker, has now com-
pleted her exhaustive monograph on
JULIUS CAESAR. As Miss Ida March
claims descent in an unbroken line
from the tyrannicide BRUTUs, it would
be too much to expect that she should
take as favourable a view of the great
Roman as that embodied by the late
Mr. FROUDE in his famous appreciation.
The title of her work, Great Caesar's
Ghost / sufficiently indicates the view-
point from which Miss March ap-
proaches her task. At the same time
she in no way subscribes to the popular
theory that CESAR was an austere or
strait-laced man. On the contrary,
she aims at showing that underneath
his somewhat grim features there
lurked an element of diablerie for
which we look in vain in the pages of
his laconic Commentaries.
Special interest attaches to the long-
promised biography of WILLIAM THE
CoNQUEROR which Messrs. Pougher and
Blower hope to publish in Coronation
week. It is from the pen of Mr.
Otho Long-i'-th'-Nose, who traces his
descent from the great Duke of
NoFMANDY through Rebecca FitzMoses,
the morganatic wife of WILLIAM
RUFUs. Although his Norman sym-
pathies are naturally pronounced, Mr.
Long-i'-th'-Nose makes no attempt to
whitewash his ancestor, yet en-
deavours to show that, underlying his
semblance of ruthless force, there was
a deep vein of almost “sloppy"
tenderness.

The popularity of the above move-
ment has led to the association of
other pedestrian gestures with the
names of writers of genius. Thus, the
following vogues are shortly to be
established:— -
THE BELLoc GLIDE,
THE CoreLLI SKIP,
THE BART KENNEDY Hop (Two-stEP),
AND
THE BEGBIE BUMP.
“A group of well-known racing men snapped
at Brooklands. The names from left to light
are W. H. Bashall, A. Bashall, J. T. Bashall,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CELEBBITY.
I got into a third-class carriage
about one hundred miles from Town,
and that is how we met. He was the
only other occupant of the carriage—a
nice clean old rustic, with a patriarchal
beard. I sat down opposite him, and,
producing a newspaper from my pocket,
began to read.
After a time I became aware, sub-
consciously, that the old fellow was
perusing the other side of the paper
which faced him. Soon he
began to fidget and to
show signs of some little
excitement. I was the first
to speak. I had finished the
front page and wished to
get on to the second, but,
realising that the other
reader might be in the thick
of a very entertaining para-
graph, I enquired politely,
“May I?” At that he
cried, “Accuse me, Sir,
accuse me, but that's Me!”
(I give his lingo throughout
to the best of my recollec-
tion, but cannot guarantee
its accuracy, for I am not an
expert in dialects and have
no memory.)
* How do you mean?” I
asked.
“Why that, Sir!” and he
pointed to an advertisement
of “Professor Ball's Sweet
Essence of Anti-Rheum.” I
still looked puzzled, and he
specified a portrait—a “muz-
zotint "-over a testimonial,
signed “William Rackstreet,”
entitled “Cured after Eighty
Years of Suffering.” “That's
me!” he cried triumphantly;
“I am a Celebbity.” I
looked at the portrait and
I looked at the old man.
The latter might have been
the rough design for the
former. I had never quite
realised before that these
“cures” were real people, and might
be met in the flesh.
“Yes, that's very interesting,” I said;
“I see the resemblance.”
“My old 'oman says I get more like
every day," remarked my travelling
companion. -
“Well, you must persevere,” I
said, and with that I thought the
incident had closed. But no, the old
man was not going to let the matter
drop.
“It's a wonderful fine thing to be a
Celebbity, Sir," he continued. “I’m
the talk of my part o' the country, and
that envied. Folks all points at me,
and my old 'oman likes goin' out with
me. Still I don't let it make me
uplifted, Sir–but it's a mighty fine
feelin' to be a Celebbity—to be in the
papers along o' the KING and Lord
CHARLES BEERSFORD and 'ARRY LAUDER
and SANDow, and the rest o' the nobs.
Ah, my old 'oman thinks summat o'
me now, and I don't get so much
naggin' from 'er as I used to. And the
other women's that jealous of 'er cos
she's married to a Celebbity
women's funny cattle.”
Ah,
Scotch Seaton (who has shown old lady over church and followed her to
the gate without getting a tip). “WEEL, MA LEDDY, GIN YE FIND
when YE GANG HAME YE've LosT YER PURse, YE’ll MEBBE MINI,
YE Di DNA liae IT oot HERE.”
It would have been churlish to go on
reading my paper. “And how did it
all come about 2 ” I asked.
“Ah, that be a long tale, Sir. You
see I was well known up our way for
my rheumatiz, even afore this. And
one day the Genkleman—what was 'is
name, Sir? I can never memory it.”
“Professor Ball's Sweet Essence of
Anti-Rheum,” I said.
“Ah, you're a knowing one; that 's
it. Well, 'e call when I was out
a-work, and 'e give my old woman
a bottle for me for to try.
And then 'e calls arter-
wards, and asks if I feels
better, and I tells 'im as
maybe I does. It was one
o' my good days it so
'appened. I didn't tell 'im
I 'adn't swallered 'is mix-
tur’. You see I don't never
take no physics, Sir. I don't
'old with 'em. I ain't 'eld
with 'em since the show-up
"º of Dr. Smith's Cure-All.”
º “Oh, what was that ?” I
asked.
“Why, I used to take
that reg'lar, Sir, until a
paper what never printed
'is adwertisings showed 'im
up. It seems 'e wasn't really
no doctor at all, Sir, and 'e
first brought 'is stuff out as
a Happetising Sauce for
whittles, and it didn't ketch
on as that, an' 'e then turns
it into a 'Air Lotion, but
folks complained as it was
Ž% too sticky, an' then 'e ad-
~~ 22.2% wertises it as a Cure-all, and
zºza-zz- it goes off like 'ot cakes—
º - until the paper gives it away.

º “Ah,” I said.
“Well, the Genkleman, Sir,

WHAT a strange world it is, to be

a day or so later we were buttoning up
our coats and shivering as though at
the North Pole. No wonder that the
American said that England had no
climate, only samples. There is, how-
ever, no use in grumbling, and this
writer has always found consolation in
the old couplet:
“Whether it's cold or whether it's hot,
You've got to weather it, whether or not.”
What, however, he has never rightly
understood is how the last “whether”
should be spelt. Should it be “whether
or not " or “weather or not " ? At the
Club lunch opinion is divided, but the
ablest man there inclines to “whether,”
as in the version above. Asked to
state his reason, he replied, “Wild
wethers wouldn't extract it from me.”

When you come to think of it the
great bore about life is dressing. If
we could rise from our beds in the

how easy everything would bel. At the
same time it must be admitted that a
new coat is by no means unknown to
our canine friends, and at this moment
the writer's coat is covered with hairs
from one of his pets. Such a state of
things naturally did not pass without
comment at the Club lunch, where,
after various sarcasms had been dis-
charged, the whole company joined in
the hymn, “Daré to be a Spaniel.”
Descending yesterday from his bus,
this writer was requested by a news-
paper boy to purchase the latest edition.
Although totally lacking any military
distinction, the writer was addressed by
the boy as “Keptin,” and the question
arises, why does it please a civilian, no
matter what he is, whether grocer or
journalist, to have a military title
conferred upon him 2 An interesting
volume could be written upon this
particular human foible. Referring to
the matter later in the day at the Club
lunch,this writer obtained some valua-
ble suggestions. But it was left for the
Club lunch wit (as usual) to say the
best thing. “The reason why we like
being called “major,’ ” he said, “is
that we know ourselves to be so —

“If this is spring,” said Jeremy—
“b-r-r-r-r—give me—give me — well,
give me the matches, anyhow.”
“Catch,” said Mrs. Jeremy. “And
tell me the news, if there is any.”
Jeremy lit his pipe and began to
explore the paper.
“There is a most important announce-
ment about the Coronation that I caught
a glimpse of a moment ago,” he said,
“only it keeps on slipping past me.
Ah, here it is—in large print. ‘Book
your seats for the Coronation now !'
What do you think of that ?”
“Oh, Jerry, shall we book three
seats now 2 ” - - - -
“Two seats,” said Jeremy.
“Jeremy!” said his wife indignantly.
“Have you forgotten Baby?”
“I don't think Baby wants to go.
She hasn't said anything to-me about
it.” ... *
“You don't understand her, that's
what it is. I told her all about it
yesterday.” -
“If she could only say ‘Gee-gee,’”
said Jeremy, “that would be some-
thing. I mean it would keep her busy
while the procession was on. As it
is— ” *…* - *
“She did say ‘Gee-gee" once.”
“Not in a competition—only in
practice. That doesn't count.”
“But think how nice it would be for
her when she's grown up to be able to
say that she remembers seeing GEORGE
THE FIFTH's Coronation.”
“She won't remember it. People
never remember, things that happened
to them before they were one. That's
what makes it so nice to own quite a
young baby. You don't have to be so
careful.”
“But of course we should tell her that
she saw it.”
“I shall probably tell her that any-
how. You get the same results at less
expense. I don't think you realise,
dear, how expensive it's going to be.”
“I suppose it depends where we see
it from ?”
“To a certain extent I suppose it
does. Some places are fairly cheap.
For instance, here is something for
forty pounds the day in-oh, well, it
isn't actually on the best part of the
route—in Willesden.”
“I don't think I’ve ever been to
Willesden,” said Mrs. Jeremy.
“Then we shall be able to bring off
the double event in one day—Willesden
and the Coronation.”
“I think I'd rather be a little nearer,
dear, if it's possible.”
“Well, what about Brixton ? Here's
a house at Brixton being given away
in Coronation week for five hundred
miles, dear?”
“I don't know, I've never been to
Brixton.” f
“You don't seem to have been any-
where. Youshould travel, darling. Now,
have you ever heard of Hampstead 2
For a thousand pounds you can get an
upper part in Hampstead, from which a
view of St. Paul's Cathedral and other
points along the route can readily be
obtained.” -
“It's going to cost a lot of money,”
sighed Mrs. Jeremy.
“It is indeed. Aren't you glad now
that we decided not to take Baby?
Oh, look here, this is all right! Two
guineas a week! It's in Oh, that's
too far off. We must draw the line at
Devonshire. Oh, I see, I've got on to
the wrong column. It's for Easter.”
“I suppose,” said Mrs. Jeremy, “we
couldn't go up for the day and stand
in the crowd, and get back here the
same night?”
. “I don't know. I’m full of loyalty,
but six hours in the train and six more
in the gutter in a broiling sun–or a
beastly blizzard, or whatever weather
it is—will strain my loyalty to the
breaking point. How would Baby
like to be woken up that night by a
Republican father?”
“Then we won't go. We'll celebrate
it in the country by ourselves.”
“Right,” said Jeremy. “And I will
now take a brisk walk round the gar-
den and work out something brilliant.
Loyal but brilliant.”
He finished his paper, read one
column over again, and then walked
thoughtfully out into the garden. In
spite of the bitter wind he strolled
down the deserted pergola and stood a
moment looking at the little stream
which divided the lawns from the
cabbages. Then he surveyed the
herbaceous border with a careful eye,
nodded his head three times, and came
back into the house at a brisk trot.
“My dear,” he said, bursting enthusi-
astically into his wife's room, “I have
it Put on all the clothes you've got
and come out with me.” He dashed
into his dressing-room and dashed out
again, doing up buttons. “Six of my
knitted waistcoats are missing,” he
said. “If I catch a chill it will be be-
cause I could only find four. Come on.”
When they got outside, Jeremy
paused. “This is a momentous occa-
sion,” he said. “I rather think we
ought to have Baby here. Is it too
cold for her ?” -
“Much,” said Mrs. Jeremy firmly.
“Then we'll waive that point. Now
then, this is my idea. We are agreed,
are we not, that we ought to celebrate
“We are.”
“Very well. Then this is how we'll
do it. You see this silly pergola, with
its ugly wooden posts and grass walk
leading to nowhere? We'll pull it
down and replace it with nice stone
pillars and gravel. How does that
strike you?”
“Beautiful, dear.”
“‘Beautiful’ is the word. Then this
bridge over the stream. It's nothing
but an old log. Now what do you say
to a nice stone bridge into the kitchen
garden?”
“That would be rather sweet.”
“You see, what I feel is that, as
things are, a person approaching from
the cabbages might easily miss the sun-
dial at the top of the herbaceous
border simply because he didn't know
it was there. Even if he did know
and wanted to get to it he might fall
off the bridge into the stream on his
way. Now if we have this strong ||
stone bridge first, then the broad gravel
walk, and then turn the herbaceous
border into a macadam road, why then
nobody would have any excuse for not
getting to the end of it.”
“All the same the sun-dial is rather
pretty.”
“Yes,” said Jeremy; “I feel that
that is the weak part of the scheme.
Perhaps we'd better have an iron
summer-house there instead.”
When the great Coronation scheme
had been thoroughly explained to her
and they were before the fire again,
Mrs. Jeremy said, looking up from the
paper: -
“You were being sarcastic just now,
weren't you, dear?”
“Yes,” said Jeremy, “but I shall be
all right after lunch.”
“Well, but what is your idea of a
beautiful Edward Memorial?”
“Oh, I don't know,” said Jeremy.
“I think I should re-turf the Mall and
pull down Buckingham Palace.”

DERRING-DO.
As it is I have a bad cold in the head
and it might have been much worse.
Also I feel that I cannot now marry
Diana. For that however I care little;
she has no nice feelings and would
make but an indifferent wife.
It was a few days ago that I went a
solitary walk upon the sands. The sea
was rough and there were few people
about. It is a little difficult to explain
what I was doing. My readers will
think it was a somewhat childish pro-
ceeding. The fact was, I was amusing
myself by approaching to the very jaws
of a wave and, when it broke, en-
deavouring to escape it. The practice
requires no little skill and dexterity
and is moreover attended by some
considerable personal risk; but that is,
of course, an element in all true sport
and makes us Englishmen what we
are.
! So absorbed was I in this occupation
that in the very midst of a critical
retreat I had the most hairbreadth
escape from being run over and killed
by Diana, who came prancing up on a
beastly horse. I uncovered and asked
her with biting sarcasm whether she
had bought the sea-shore.
Being at a loss for a telling repartee
she panted and made a great show of
being out of breath. “Glorious !
glorious!” she shouted at last, brush-
ing the golden hair out of her eyes.
“James, why do you never come and
ride with me?”
I said that my stud of horses was
wintering in the South of France.
“You can hire one,”, she replied;
“but I believe you're afraid.”
I confess that I had no leaning
towards equestrianism, but her sug-
gestion put me on my mettle. “I’m
not,” I said; “I’m as brave as two
lions.”
So we arranged a ride for the follow-
ing morning, and she scampered off,
covering me with sand from head to
foot. -
The next day accordingly found me
at the livery stables with a riding-crop
under my arm. I spoke to the seedy
individual in charge. “I want a small
tame horse,” I said.
“Yes, Sir,” quoth he, and thereupon
presented me with an enormous animal, ,
which moveover had a roving eye that
was exceedingly distasteful. I never
realized before how large horses are.
“Can you ride, Sir 2" he asked
impertinently.
“Can I ride / " As a matter of fact
I did not know, as it was my first
experiment, though I work a car rather
decently. However I had seen people
mount, and grasping a bunch of its

hair in my left hand I vaulted lightly
into the stirrup. The ostler then put
in some assistance and I presently
arrived upon its back.
“Where 's the brake?” I asked.
He gave me a sinister grin.
“’Orses don't 'ave no brikes,” he said.
A feeling of disquiet came upon me,
but as I went gently down the High
Street on the first speed I gained con-
fidence.
“People talk a lot of rot about
learning to ride,” I thought.
At the next moment a tram passed
and the brute got automatically into
its second gear. With great prompt-
ness I pulled the reins and it stopped
dead and sneezed so violently that I
all but slid down its neck.
For some time we remained station-
ary and then a bystander very kindly
started it again for me.
After that I soon found that I had
the beast well under control, and took
several corners in good style.
On reaching the “Laurels,” Diana's
abode, I was in a quandary. It seemed
impossible to dismount, but how else
could I ring the bell? Fortunately they
have no silly front-door steps, and after
some skilful manoeuvring I managed
to ring it with my foot. As soon as
the door opened my horse made a
foolish attempt to enter the vestibule

or lobby. The trim maid retreated in
alarm. With great presence of mind I
grasped some ivy that grew upon the
wall.
At that moment Diana opened a
window above me.
“Leave your horse outside, James;
surely you know it isn't etiquette --
“I did not intend the horse to enter,"
I protested. “I trust sincerely it is
not eating the umbrellas. It is almost
beyond my power to control its actions,
for it is very wild. I fear I must
abandon it and climb into the ivy.”
However, at this point the horse
suddenly tired of the interior and backed
out of its own accord. -
Diana was tactless enough to suggest
again that I should dismount.
“I cannot descend,” I said. “It
would leap from my hands if I did and
speedily be lost in the woods. It is a
horse of the most deplorable character.”
Diana's steed was shortly brought
round from the stables, and, after
putting her arms about its neck and
kissing its ear, she was mounted by a
groom, and we set forth. -
For a time all went well. I rode
along beside her at a gentle pace and
told her how frightfully pretty she was
and how her horse matched her hair.
We were a striking couple as we
rode through the town. Small wonder
that the people on the tram-cars leant
over the side as one man to look at us.
My only anxiety was lest my horse
should sneeze again.
However, when we reached the sea-
shore, another difficulty beset me.
Diana suggested that we should
gallop. - -
“Gallop,” I said. “Yes—perhaps.
The only thing is, I don't think my
horse does that.” - . .
“Then I should beat him till he does,”
she answered helpfully. - -
Somehow I felt opposed to this course.
“Do you know,” I said, “I think
kindness is the better treatment. If
you beat a horse it doesn't under-
stand; it only resents it.”
“Well, let's try,” she said, and, lean-
ing over, she gave it an enormous bang.
What exactly happened I don't
know, but the sands whizzed round
me, the sky appeared to vanish into
the sea, and the next moment I was in
the middle of a large wave.
When I sat up I found myself drift-
ing about in the surf, while Diana was
on the shore, lying upon her horse's
neck and shouting with laughter.

I might have been willing to forgive

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtractED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday March 27.
—Curious how sudden impulse unex-
pectedly seizes a man, embarking him
on enterprise which when he rose in
the morning was far from his mind.
Here's AINsworth, for example, one of
best groomed men in the House, has
decorated it theseeight years and not dis-
turbed its serenity by making a single
speech. With characteristic originality
when he broke the spell he chose
unauthorised opportunity. Generally
understood that there exists ancient or-
dinance forbidding making of speeches
at Question time. Nothing easier, few
proceedings more frequent, than eva-|.
sion of this rule. If in course of Ques-
tion hour a Member rose and, address-
ing the MINISTER, remarked, “I should
like to inform the right honourable gen-
tleman that two and two make four,”
there would be angry shout of “Order!
Order!” SPEAKER would interfere, and
the rule-breaker would have to resume
his seat. But if he put his great thought
into interrogative form, thus: “Is the
right honourable gentleman aware that
two and two make four?” he would
be perfectly in order. The Minister
would reply at greater or less length;
other Members below and above the
Gangway would nip in with supple-
mentary questions; and the SPEAKER
would benevolently preside over regular
debate.
AINsworth, by this time quite an
elderly young Member, well aware of
this regulation. Observed it throughout
the greater part of his speech. In fact,
it was somewhat inartistic deference
to formula that led to his downfall.
Occasion of this memorable address
appropriate in its noteworthiness.
Captain WARING asked SECRETARY To
TREASURY “whether he is aware that
the method of assessing licence duty
on the basis of alcoholic trade done has
the approval of the licensed trade in
Scotland as the fairest way of raising
the money required; and whether, in
view of the fact that the licensing law
in Scotland has always differed from
that which obtains in England, he will
consider the advisability of adopting
a different system of assessment in the
present case ?”
HoBHOUSE, Martha of the Treasury
Bench, troubled about many things,
made due answer. From midway
along the Front Bench below Gang-
way on Ministerial side rose the good
grey head of the Member for Argyll-
shire. But WARING's conundrum had
excited emulation in several parts of
the House. When others jumped up
AINsworth, pink of courtesy, always
ready to efface himself, dropped back
in his seat. Debate carried a little
further he rose again, and this time
caught the SPEAKER's eye.
Began his address very well, intro-
ducing it with the consecrated formula:
“Is the honourable gentleman aware
that—?” Went on with his Secondly
and Thirdly safeguarded by similar de-
vice. There was some murmuring at his
Fourthly; had he not been so absorbed
in the profundity of problem set forth
in original question he would have noted
ominous rustling in SPEAKER's Chair.
Where he made mistake was in
reiterating the phrase “Also whether"
when introducing fresh section of the
NIPPED IN THE BUD–AS IT WERE!

shire entirely ruined by the unfeeling interven-
tion of the SPEAKER!

speech. If he had varied it on turning
to his fifth point, all might have been
well. When once more it resounded
the SPEAKER was on his legs with
stern cry of “Order! Order!” AINs-
worTH dropped back in his seat with
suddenness that recalled action of the
American gentleman, whose name I
for the moment forget, who in the
course of animated conversation received
in the abdomen a chunk of red sand-
stone.
Regarded as a maiden speech it was
full of promise, which the House will
look forward with interest to see
fulfilled on some not far distant
occasion.
Business done. — PREMIER moved
Resolution authorising use of guillotine
with view to completing Budget
business before close of financial year.
Under its provisions Report stage to be
accomplished on Wednesday; Third
Reading taken forthwith. Opposition
bitterly complain that allotted time is
insufficient. Accordingly they make
denunciatory speeches which, com-
mencing at a quarter to four, conclude
at sound of dinner-bell ringing at eight
o'clock. Having thus occupied more
than four hours lamenting inadequacy
of time for dealing with important
subject, House emptied, something like
scoreof Members remaining to deal with
Bill in Committee. Progress reported
at 2.27 A.M.
Tuesday.—At a moment when union
of hearts between Irish Nationalists
and Liberals seems on verge of con-
summation unhappy incident arises
that threatens to undo labour of many
months. From question addressed to
PostMASTER-GENERAL by Mr. CRUMLEY
it appears that on the 17th inst., being
St. Patrick's Day, a tyrannous post-
master, hireling of Saxon Government,
ordered a telegraph messenger boy to
remove a bunch of shamrock from his
cap. When not engaged in direction
of Imperial affairs at Westminster, the
Member for South Fermanagh carries
on the business of a butcher in Ennis-
killen, the ancient and renowned city,
scene of this alleged outrage. Pretty
to see, as Mr. PEPYs was wont to
observe, how, when sternly addressing
the hapless PostMASTER-GENERAL, Mr.
CRUMLEY's hands moved with almost
imperceptible gesture as if he were
sharpening a knife on a steel.
Had already privily engaged Post-
MASTER-GENERAL's attention on subject.
What he now desired to know was
whether the Minister “has yet com-
pleted his enquiries into the matter;
whether he found the allegation to be
true; and if so" (observe the variety of
interrogation in contrast with AINs-
worTH's slavish, fatal adherence to his
“also whether”) “how has he dealt or
proposes to deal with the postmaster
who so far exceeded his duty 2"
The INFANT SAMUEL met with plain
unvarnished tale this damaging charge,
which has shaken South Fermanagh to
its centre and threatens, as hinted, to
break up the ententecordiale between the
Irish Members and Downing Street. The
boy, it appeared, had, in excess of pat-
riotic zeal presented himself at the post
office all on St. Patrick's morning not
only with a sprig of shamrock in his
button-hole but with a generous wreath
twined about his cap. The postmaster
felt the line must be drawn somewhere.
Raised no objection to the buttonhole.

Memberſor Haddingtonshire had to say.
His first marked success was dis-

which he carried through some useful
Bills. In the late Eighties Mr. BIGGAR
was in full career as an Obstruc.ionist.
His shrill “I 'bject" rang out when-

Bill after midnight. HALDANE had
much at heart a measure he with
characteristic brevity named “The

THE HONOUR OF THE NAVY.
MR. PUNCH,
SIR,-As an Imperialist I feel that I
am almost entitled to encroach upon
your valuable space and appeal through
you to the Naval Authorities, begging
them to mark this “year of years,”
as The Daily Mail so aptly puts it, by
some alteration in the dress or equip-
ment of the Navy.
Why should the Army alone have
fresh buttons and braids and caps, etc.,
every other month, and the Navy re-
main completely neglected in statu quo?
Only to-day I see in my morning
paper that Infantry officers in future
are to exchange the plain red sash
for a handsome cummerbund of gold
and red (price, £5 15s. 0d. spot cash,
to £77s. 0d. credit).
What, I ask, has been done for the
Navy 2 Absolutely nothing! The last
honour conferred upon the Senior Ser-
vice was after the death of NELsoN,
when the men were given a black sash
and three white lines on their collar to
denote his three great victories. Surely
the introduction of the Torpedo might
have suggested an alteration in the
cocked hat, whilst the launching of the
Super-Dreadnought would have been
an excellent opportunity for a further
row of gold lace all round.
I am,
Yours obediently,
“DISINTERESTED.”

THE RECOGNITION.
I HAVE not always lived in the
country. Once upon a time I lived in
London. When I lived in London I
had many friends. Sometimes I re-
member them. Sometimes they remem-
ber me.
It was not really a fog. My train
had only attained that exact degree of
lateness which betokens a fog for the
following day. The Strand was hazy;
the air was raw. I walked quickly.
“Hullo!” cried a voice at my elbow.
“ Hullo 1 ''
I stopped and glanced back. He
came forward and held out his hand.
I took it. -
“By Jove,” he exclaimed. “Fancy
meeting you again here ! The yery
last man I expected to see! Talking
about you to the wife only yesterday !
Know I'm married, don't you ?"
“No,” I replied quite truth ſully, “I
didn't.”
“Well, how are you?" he con-
tinued. “How do you like the country?
'Pon my soul, you haven't changed a
bit ! Seen any of the boys lately 2”
“What boys 2 Whose boys?". I
asked, hoping for a clue to his identity.
“Why, all the old crowd. Why
didn't you let me know? We'd have
had a rare old time.”
His face seemed dimly familiar to
me. ... I had met him somewhere
before. -
“I’m awfully sorry,” I said. “I
know you, of course, but I'm hanged
if I can think what your name is for
the moment.”
He stepped back a pace and looked
at me in pained reproof. “Well,"
he exclaimed, “I never thought you
would forget me ! If I'd been asked
—oh, well !”
“What is your name 2"
“I shan't tell you,” he replied
shortly. “If you can't remember me
I'm not going to help you.”
“Well, then, where did we meet 2

Yes—I remembered him then, per-

“Great Scott " " I cried. “Of course
I do! It's years since we met!"
“Time does move,” he assented.
“It's Captain Brimmacombe, isn't
it 2 ''
“That's me,” he replied, drawing
himself up. “I thought you'd remem-
ber me all right.”
“Of course you were in pink last
time.” -
“Pink what?” he inquired—and
then added hastily, “Oh, yes, of
course I was l''
Do you remember
“Out with the Tamworth beagles,

“And nearly another,” amended
Brimmacombe. “Very nearly another.”
“Only it got to earth and we'd
no ferrets, so we rode back from the
meet and had a snipe drive at Lord
Blackacre's.” -
“That's it,” cried Brimmacombe.
“Lord—how it all comes back to one.
There weren't many huntsmen could
touch us that day ! Not much !”
“Done much hunting lately 2” I
inquired.
He shook his head mournfully.
“My days with the dogs are over,” he
replied. “I was thrown off my horse
and had to very reluctantly give it up.”
“Split your infinitive, didn't you?”
“I did. Hospital for six weeks, and
had to leave the Army.” -
“What regiment was it?”
“Ugh 1” he shuddered, “it’s cold out
here. Come in and have a drink.
Just one. I never have more than one
in the middle of the day. Must have
something to warm one in this weather.
Ugh "
I learned a great deal about British
sport during that one drink—and a
great deal that was new concerning
crack cavalry regiments.
“Shall we do as they do on board
ship?” inquired Brimmacombe when
our glasses were empty. “Just the
one drink and toss who pays for it?”
He produced a handful of silver coins
and counted them, turning one or two
over in the process. “Seven. That's
right. You call.”
He turned his hand, palm down-
wards, over the coins. “Shall we have
a bob on it, too 2 Just for luck.”
“Why not half-a-sovereign 2." I
suggested.
“Done,” he shouted. “You call,
that 's fair enough, eh? You call.”
My eye fell on the glass door of the
bar-room. I stared in amazement.
“By Jove!” I cried, “there is Lord
Blackacre' I'll bring him in l’”
The day was raw and I walked
quickly. I don't know Warwickshire;
I don't know anyone of the name of
Brimmacombe; I don't know Lord
Blackacre. I know that I had only
met this old friend once before. That
was three years ago at the same spot,
and I lost the toss. I know that,
on the present occasion, when I left
him, three of the coins beneath his
palm lay with their heads uppermost,
and three with their tails on top. I
don't know how long the seventh one
stood on its edge between his fingers.
I don't know what he said when he
paid for the drinks.
But I do know that we shall never
meet again.

| AN ERROR IN DIET.
|
GwendoLEN, it appears, is extremely
annoyed with me: but, sorry as I am,
the mistake, I maintain, was just one
of those which might have been made
by anybody. There was no doubt that
her rabbit was getting monstrously fat
(when it was first given to her on her
ninth birthday it was I who suggested
calling it Bernard, on account of its
vegetarian diet; but as time went on it
became clear that Gilbert would have
been a more appropriate name). Amy-
how, she seems to regard me as a kind
of godfather to it, and in some way
responsible for its behaviour. We had
just seen it consume something like its
own weight in lettuce and cabbage
leaves, with an occasional monkey-nut
thrown in to vary the monotony, and
it still seemed ravenously ſlungry. Its
eyes were glassy Lut determined.
“What it wants,” I said at last,
“is some exercise; what can you
expect when it's cooped up like that 2
You ought to take it out on a le.d every
morning.”
“But then some big dog night get
it,” she objected.
“It would have to be a very big
one,” I said. “Besides, I don't suppose
any dog would take it for a rabbit
at all: with those lop ears and that
waist measurement it would probably
be mistaken for one of the pigmy
elephants that explorers see in Africa.
By the way, how long have you had
it 2 ''
“A year and a half,” she told me,
“ and when it came it was only a teeny
—just so high. And Nurse says they
live eight years,” she added rather
solemnly.
“In that case,” I said, “by the time
you're seventeen it will have eaten
you out of house and home. You will
have to have a new stable built for it.
Still, it might have been worse, you
know. Suppose it had been a tortoise:
they live for a thousand years, and at
that rate of growth, if the present
Government were still in, just think of
the land-taxes your descendants would
have to pay.”
“I don't know what you're talking
about,” said Gwendolen.
“No,” I said, “I suppose not. By
Jove, though, I have it : the verything.”
On my way home I bought a bottle of
“Makelene,” that infallible remedy for
reducing the flesh which forms (if one
may judge from the advertisements)
almost the sole topic of conversation
on golf-courses and skating-rinks and
even at receptions and balls. I judged
that it would meet Bernard's case
exactly.
About three weeks later I had a letter
“How Do You Like THE WICAR 7"
“Not AT ALL; HE 's so FAT—AND IN LENT, Too !"
from Marjorie (she is Gwendolen's
sister and about three years older).
“I am writing,” she said, “because
Gwendolen is too angry. We gave
Bernard that stuff you sent, and he is
worse than ever. We have to feed him
all day long, and he is grown about
two inches all round. Nurse says he
couldn't eat more if he was a Christian,
and he will probably die of epiplexy.”
This was very puzzling. Could those
advertisements have lied ? And then
a wave of horror swept over me. I
went into my bedroom and found it
was only too true. The “Makelene"
was still there. I had accidentally
sent Bernard a bottle of “Robusto,”
the great nerve-tonic and appetite-
restorer, which (in common with the
crowned heads of Europe) I have been
taking lately. Well, well. Bernard is
evidently one of those who have great-
ness thrust upon them. I have not
dared to ask for any more reports of
him—there is only too much fear that
the next may be the last, and possibly
a very loud one.

I HoPE Mr. BERNARD SHAw will
snatch a little leisure from his arduous
compositions to go to the Haymarket

of mock-sentiment. He will there find
how the thing should be done. Paradox,

to possible prejudices; freedom from
attractions not too obvious, but sup-
posed to be of an intellectual order,
seeks diversion in the pursuit of his
opposite, a young barbarian by whom
her best lyrical utterances are character-
ised as “corking.” The fact that she
is at pains to keep this affair secret
from a husband of whose devotion she
is confident, seems to her mind to
sanctify the intrigue, which for the
rest is sufficiently innocent. The hus-
band, in turn, seeks distraction in the
pursuit of her opposite—a sporting

one another's arms. They succeed;
and the Dean, threatening to embody
in his morrow's sermon a treatise on
conjugal perfidy drawn from his per-
sonal observations, brings the married
couple to their knees. In the Deanery
garden, an unusually picturesque
frame for a confessional, each is
admitted to a knowledge of the other's
indiscretion, and the play ends with
the promise of a reluctant reunion on
the old intellectual basis.

themes and from intrusion of the
author's own personality; humour,
and everything else, kept under
restraint and in the service of the main
design—add to these virtues, positive
or negative, a very fresh and original
setting, and you have in Lady
Patricia a model for the makers of
light comedy.
It had its defects, but they were
almost unavoidable. A certain me-
chanical repetition of situations was
necessary to a scheme made up of
parallels. But these echoes were of
the very essence of the irony of things.
Lady Patricia, who has married
Michael Cosway on the strength of
too is greatly concerned to avoid
wounding the susceptibilities of a
partner of whose whole-hearted fidelity
he is equally assured.
However, in course of time Nature
has her way; youth turns to youth, the
young barbarian to the flapper, and
both set themselves to elude the
attentions of their senior admirers.
Pursuers and pursued, they follow and
fly across the stage, in a veritable
Midsummer Night's Dream of cross-
purposes. Meanwhile there is much
espionage on the part of a Reverend
Dean (father of the boy) and a châtelaine
(mother of the girl), who work hard, in
collusion, to throw the young pair into
word of her part as if she really enjoyed
it. It is no detraction from the merit
of Mr. RUDOLPH BESIER's exquisitely
humorous dialogue to say that her per-
sonality was necessary to his triumph.
Her recitation of jewelled verse in
the presence of an embarrassed foot-
man was a thing to be remembered
always. Mr. ERIC LEwis as the Dean
was superbly in his element; and
Miss Rosina FILIPPI played up to
him in the brusque business-like way
that one associates with the work of
this sound and virile artist.
Mr. ARTHUR WoxtNER, as the hus-
band, seemed a little outclassed, and
Mr. CHARLEs MAUDE, as the boy, was

perhaps rather too mature and refined
for the raw article. But I heartily
commend Miss ATHENE SEYLER's
flapper; she played with just the desired
gaucherie, and cleverly avoided all
attempts to be conventionally attrac-
tive. The chorus consisted of Mr. C. V.
FRANCE, the most perfect gardener that
ever clipped an oak or begat thirteen
children. Apparently blind and deaf
to his surroundings, he took quiet note
of many strange occurrences, and I
| shall not soon forget the pregnant com-
parison which he established between
the singing of Lady Patricia and the
| call of an amorous tabby.
Two of the three Acts were laid on
the first floor of an oak that might
have accommodated half the survivors
of Worcester. You could climb higher
up, as the young folk did, into the
actual branches, if you wanted to; but
the inconvenience of this way of retreat
from intruders was oarly recognized
by Lady Patricia, who had a separate
exit-ladder built during the five weeks
that intervened between the First and
Second Acts; and this was subsequently
utilized to great advantage. It was a
roomy oak, as I have hinted, and not
only did it serve for tea parties, but it
supported a summer-house that was in
large request with eavesdroppers and
others whose behaviour was not for
the general eye.
It may be that the subtleties of
Mr. BESIER's play will tell against
its popularity. Even the first-night
audience was not too quick at taking
the points. But I shall hope that the
freshness of its dialogue and mise-en-
scène and above all the enchanting per-
formance of Mrs. PATRICK CAMPBELL
will give it the success it deserves.
I have only two small complaints to
make to the author. I said that his
ridicule was never ill-placed, but I
make one exception. He should not
have laughed at the little novice's song
in Guinevere—“Late, late, so late.”
This, I am certain, was a lapse from
right taste. And, secondly, before his
next call, he must learn to make a
better bow. O. S.

REFLECTIONS.
To you, O faithful friend who never
change,
I raise my brimming glass and cry,
“Live long !" -
No jealousy can ever us estrange,
No quarrel snap a tie so staunch and
strong.
No other soul in this wide weary earth
Is worth a moment's serious thought
but you,
Who share my sorrows, mingle in my
mirth,
And give me—what the world denies
—my due.
For you alone perceive my virtues rare,
My store of wit, my touch of classic
grace,
My mellow wisdom and my courtly air,
The strength that gives distinction to
my face.
Yet, on reflection, with the morning light
Sometimes there's disillusion in the
alr;
For when I shave my mirror shows a
sight
That almost makes me cut you then
and there.

written with a destructive purpose is that too often the parti-
cular Aunt Sally chosen for overthrow is apt to revenge
herself by upsetting the balance and credibility of the plot.
It is thus all the more credit to Mrs. MAUD that, setting
out to expose the errors of the creed (or superstition, if you
prefer it) known as Christian Science, she has incidentally
produced a most clever and interesting story. The Ea:-
piation of John Court (METHUEN) is all this, and more;
speaking for myself, I can say that it holds the attention
of the reader from the first page to the last. John Court
was a young English tea-planter in Ceylon, to marry
whom, Prudence, the heroine, comes out from England.
Prudence is, and John was when they last met, just an
attractive example of ordinary, well-educated, healthy-
minded humanity; judge therefore of her surprise when,
expecting to be met by a lover, she finds instead a fanatic.
John, on his own voyage out, has met with one Hinton,
under the influence of whose arguments, and still more his
personality, the lad has been “brought into science.” At
first he thinks it his duty to abandon his intended union
with Prudence; it takes place, however, and what follows
is the story of Mrs. MAUD's book. It seems to me to be
exceedingly well written; the author has the skill to avoid
all appearance of exaggeration in dealing with her opponents;

Remarks the wife in a wailing croon ;

*HE RUBBER-SOLED RUSSIANS.
IN view of the engagement of the
famous corps de ballet of the Imperial
Theatres of St. Petersburg and Moscow
for the Coronation season at the
Bolosseum Music-hall, some personal
details about the most illustrious
members of the troupe should not be
without interest to our readers. They
have been obtained at great expense
and no little risk by our representative,
who has attended most of the dinner-
dances given by the Russkiy Encyclo-
pedicheskiy Slovar on its tour through
+ Great, White, and Little Russia.
The ladies are headed by Mlle.
Dushenka Nosovich whose pedal presti-
digitation places her in a class quite
apart. She is, in the charming phrase of
our Transatlantic cousins, a very lovely-
appearing woman of some twenty-two
summers, a fine classical scholar, and
from her earliest childhood she has
subsisted entirely on Koumiss, Edel-
weiss and Standard bread made of
ground jumping beans inoculated with
the Bacillus Bulgaricus. She studied
music under Napravnik and Khanikin,
and singing under Klinka.
Mlle. Eugénie Gherkin, who hails
from Nijni-Novgorod, where her father
was Professor of Experimental Toxi-
cology, excels in the macabre style.
Her figure is slim and willowy and she
is famous for the size and colour of her
eyes, which have an emerald lustre
that is all their own. Mlle. Gherkin
originally intended to embrace the
literary calling, and it is rumoured that
she has been approached with a view to
her undertaking the editorship of The
Times' daily Dancing Supplement. As,
however, she has never dined at any of
the Ency. Brit. dinners, negotiations
were reluctantly abandoned.
Prominent amongst the male dancers
is the far-famed Marko Vovchok, who
since the lamented death of Prosper
Shevchenko has stood at the head of
the saltatory confraternity. Vovchok,
who is of Ugro-Finnish descent, has
long been hailed by experts as the
greatest living executant of the auto-
cephalous school of dogmatic choreo-
graphy. He was destined for the stage
in infancy and studied for ten years
under Kirsha Pypin, Sviatogorskiy,
Pososhkov and Bogdan Khmelnibskiy
before making his début at Pskov.
Vovchok is a confirmed vegetarian
and deeply versed in the lore of the
Midrash. His great recreation is
sturgeon-fishing on the Volga.
As a grotesque dancer Stenka .
Shusherin has no equal. It is he
who enraptured the fastidious French
critics by his rocking turns in mid-air,
and though not yet twenty-three he
has qualified for an old-age pension at
thirty-five. His youth was spent
among the Polabs and he is a great
authority on the palatalisation of the
Proto-Slavonic nasals. (See Ency.
Brit., vol. xxiii., p. 912.) He has
already dined seventeen times with
Dr. HUGH CHISHolM, whom he pre-
sented on the occasion of their last
meeting with a magnificent silver-
plated tundra.
M. Shusherin, it may be added, is
deeply mortified that, along with the
Rhodes Scholars, he is unable to take
part in the All-British Hopping week
which will be held in Kent later in the
year.

THE POLITICS OF MÉNYA.
A PREHISTORIC PRECEDENT.
It will be news to many that in the
days of Atlantis there was in that
remarkable continent a country called
Mēnya, which was at one time in a
political condition exactly similar to
that in which we find ourselves to-day.
Like our own, that fortunate land
possessed two Houses of Assembly—
the upper and hereditary, and
lower and elective.
nate in possessing a party system;
it is known that the peoples of
Atlantis were in-an-advanced state
of civilisation. As our two Houses
are at present quarrelling, so were
those of Ménya, and for a pre-
cisely similar reason; while, to
carry the parallel still further,
the party which was temporarily
“top-dog" (as they called it in
their quaint phrase) in the lower
assembly, finding themselves in a
permanent minority in the upper
house, had arrangel to get over
the difficulty by the creation of a
large number of hereditary legis-
lators of their own way of thinking,
thus transferring the preponder-
ance in that element from their
opponents to themselves. To the
British patriot of to-day a know-
ledge of how things turned out in
that far-off epoch ought to be a
matter of absorbing interest; and
such knowledge we are enabled to
place before our readers.”
To employ our modern termin-
ology of “peers ” and “peerage,” it
is recorded that the new creation
of Mènyak peers amounted in
number to some six hundred.
This gave a very comfortable ma-
jority, besides allowing quite a
handsome margin for casual-
ties, such as backsliding. The
experiment was, for a time, en-
tirely successful. More so, in-
deed, than appeared to the careless
eye; for, as the giving of a peerage was
conditional on the payment by
recipient of a large sum into what was
called the party chest, the Government
of the day found themselves provided
with a considerable addition to those
sinews of war by which they proposed
to keep the voters up to a conviction

THE CYNIC'S TRAGEDY.
[Cynicism, we are informed, is out of date, and optimism has come to
its own.]
WHEN I was in the zenith of my youth,
And all the world was, so to speak, my oyster,
I asked myself the question: “What is Truth?"
And from her native well essayed to hoist her.
Each week with some new problem I'd contend,
With some new-found philosophy I'd finnick;
I tried all ways of life and in the end
I wore an eyeglass and became a cynic.
At orthodox beliefs I flung my glove;
On heresy alone I spoke a benison;
I scoffed at art, at politics, at love,
At chivalry, at honour, and at TENNYson.
At dinner-parties, when I aired my mind,
The general conversation always halted;
Waving aside the sweets, I underlined
Each comment with an almond, highly salted.
At dances, sitting out, I played the part
Of an uncompromising woman-hater;
The ladies loved to dally with a heart
Reputed colder than a worn-out crater.
They hung upon my lips to catch the gall,
Noted my epigrams, in albums stored 'em ;
Alas! those golden days are past recall;
Now, when I speak, they simply gape with boredom.
The cynic's had his day, like other dogs;
And yet I can't throw off that fatal manner,
Don a new set of philosophic togs
And wave about the optimistic banner.
Death sooner than disgrace!—as someone said
When unforeseen disaster overthrew his side,
And, flourishing his sword above his head,
Unhesitatingly committed suicide.
But even in my end (since Fashion's rule
Leaves nothing else for him who disobeys her)
I'll guard the best traditions of my school
And slit my gullet with a safety-razor.
The Craving for Sensation.
“The carriage passenger train from Forfar to Brechin was derailed
on Wednesday afternoon, but unfortunately no person was hurt.”—
Montrose Standard.
“The Standard Dictionary does not pose as an authority on ecclesi-
astical history; still it should not blunder to the extent of saying that
Joan of Arc was canonized in 1904. The truth is, she was beautified in
April 1909, and is not yet canonized.”—The Xaverian (N.S.)
We dislike these quibbling distinctions. Besides, according
to Miss ELLALINE TERRIss, JoAN was always a rather
attractive person, even when she was alive.

THE FINISHING TOUCHES.
THE House went into Committee on
the Parliament Bill at 2.30, with Mr.
EMMoTT in the Chair.
Mr. BooDE (U., Tattenham Corner)
moved an amendment to substitute the
word “notwithstanding" for the word
“although.” He said that the Govern-
ment had forced this quarrel on the
House of Lords (Opposition cheers)
contrary to the wishes of the country
(loud Opposition cheers), which was
perfectly content with the present state
of things. If this Bill became law the
country would practically be under
Single Chamber government. (Loud
and prolonged Opposition cheers.) In
these circumstances he felt it was only
his duty as a patriotic Englishman
(Opposition cheers) to move that the
word “although" be deleted in favour
of the word “notwithstanding.”
Mr. AsquitH said that the Govern-
ment could not accept the amendment.
This was the seven hundred and ninety-
fifth amendment moved by the Oppo-
sition, to seventy-three of which the
honourable gentleman had felt it was
only his duty to stand godfather.
(Laughter.) The Government welcomed
criticism, but they would not tolerate

cheers.)
Mr. BALFour said that, speaking
as one who had sat in that House for

tion was only out for obstruction.

The CHAIRMAN said that to make a
serious charge against the right honour-
able gentleman in his personal capacity
would not be in order, but one could
accuse a Prime Minister of anything.
Lord HUGH CECIL, resuming his
speech, said that the Opposition could
not do less than insist upon the sub-
stitution of the word “notwithstanding”
for the word “although.”
Sir WILLIAM WINKs (U., Regent's
Park) rose to continue the debate, and
Mr. ASQUITH moved the closure.

The Committee then divided on the
amendment:

Mr. WHISTLE (U., Preston North
End) moved an amendment to delete
the word “and.” He said that if this
Bill became law the country would
to all intents be under Single Chamber
government. The Government had
forced this resolution on the country
and entirely contrary to the wishes of
the country. He had consulted with his
friends and they had come to the con-
clusion that it was their duty to move
that the word “and” be deleted. (Loud
Opposition cheers.)
Mr. AsquitH said that the Govern-
ment could not accept the amendment.
Mr. BALFour said that, speaking as
one who had sat in that House for
more than thirty-five years, he was
bound to say that never in the whole
course of his Parliamentary career had
he known the House to be treated in
the contumelious manner affected by
the PRIME MINISTER. (Loud Opposition
cheers.)
Mr. GoFFIN (U., Brooklands) said that
this Bill was the beginning of the end.

Mr. BUTTERY having resumed his
seat, Lord HUGH CECIL rose to continue
the debate. He said that although
they could no longer expect the PRIME
MINISTER to observe the ordinary
standards of honour customary in
polite society they did not expect him
deliberately to deceive the House.
(Prolonged uproar, all the Members
speaking at once.)
The CHAIRMAN said that he gathered
that the accusations of the honourable
Member for Oxford University were
merely academic. He appealed to Lib-
erals to allow him a hearing. When the
time came for them to be in Opposition
they would be considerably handi-
capped if they could not accuse the
Government of deliberate deception.
Lord HUGH CECIL said that the
Opposition insisted on the omission
of the word “and.”
Sir WILLIAM WINKs rising to con-
tinue the debate, Mr. Asquith moved
the closure. This was accepted, and
the Committee then voted on the
amendment :

The reduction in the Government's

prolonged cheers by the Opposition.
Mr. DIBBs (U., Scafell Pike) moved
that an exclamation mark be sub-

the clause. He said that under the
present Government the defences of
the country were starved. (Loud Op-
position cheers.) The country had never
properly discussed the Parliament Bill.
Home Rule was the first step to the
disintegration of the Empire.
Mr. Asquith, on behalf of the Go-

Mr. BALFour said that, speaking as
one who had sat in that House for
nearly forty years, he was bound to
say that, never in the whole course of
his Parliamentary career, a career ex-
tending over more than thirty-five
years, had he known the House to be
treated in such a-he would not say
outrageous—such an unprecedented
manner, as it had been on this occasion.
Mr. TookE (L., Chesil Beach) said
that his constituency, at any rate, was
in favour of the Parliament Bill.
LCrd HUGH CECIL said that among
gentlemen, when one gentleman gave
his word to another gentleman, it was
customary for that word to be kept.
In a corrupt assembly like the House
of Commons the word gentleman was
defined differently.

Lord HUGH CECIL, finishing his
argument, said that the least the PRIME

THERE was a subtle change in Archi-

Archibald since he was seven, and for
ten years our friendship had been a
beautiful and wondrous thing. Never
before had the slightest shadow fallen
between us. Since his return we were
outwardly as good friends as ever,
but—l -
Archibald obviously expected some-
thing. There was something which I
ought to have done and had not done.
Perhaps it was something I should
have said or noticed or grasped in-
stinctively. That I was in some way
remiss was obvious. That Archibald
felt disappointed in me was equally
plain. In vain I waited to pounce
upon the slightest elusive clue. One
thing only I realised—that the mystery
must be solved by intuition. Our
relations, if I had been tactless enough
to put a direct question, could never
have been the same again.

him on that... I had inquired tenderly
after the heights and difficulties of the
mountains he had scaled; I had noticed
the hotel labels on his bag; I had
listened with adequate interest to his
accounts of “her" and his casual
references to the other girl; I had
admired his snap-shots and perjured
myself with reference to the authenti-
city of the chamois horns. Up to this
point I knew that I had merited his
approval; but there was something
else!
The solution came from Archibald
himself. I felt instinctively, even
before he opened his lips, that he was
about to tell me. “Er,” he began.
“Er—ah.” Then I knew he was
going to.
He gave me one last despairing look.
There was still time for me to retrieve
myself in his eyes. I lit my pipe
deliberately and then confessed my-
self beaten. “Well?" I encouraged
him.
“Er—I–er—I,” he began again, and
then broke off into a falsetto laugh.

PENELOPE'S STORY.
“I HAVE just written a wonderful
story,” wrote Penelope, “and I want
you to criticise it for me. I was going
to send it to you, but haven't an en-
velope that will take it. So come to tea
on Tuesday, and you can read it here.”
“If you haven't an envelope that
will fit your story,” I replied, “ you
should write a story that will fit your
envelope. However, I'll come.”
I found Penelope in the cupboard
she is pleased to call her study, sitting
in the one armchair that could be
coaxed into the den and in an obvi-
ously rehearsed attitude. At the
moment of my entry she was writhing,
it was made to appear, in the throes
of incipient inspiration.
“So glad you could come,” she said.
“Now have something to eat, and then
you can read the story. Only don't
take too long over your tea. I'm sure
you'll like it.”
“I'm certain I shall,” I replied.
“Fortunately I had a light lunch.”
“I meant the story. Sugar 2"
“Several. What delicious sand-
wiches!”
Penelope, who took nothing herself,
eyed every morsel I ate with impatience.
“Finished 2 " she asked, when I had
had but three sandwiches.
I dislike being hurried over my food;
besides, I really was hungry, and there
were buttered buns and cherry-cake to
come. So I mºnched resolutely on, until
Penelope was on the verge of tears.
“What a pig you are ' " she ex-
claimed. “Pass me one of those
buns.”
I passed the dish in injured silence,
had another cup of tea and a slice of
cake, and then heaved a sigh of satis-
faction. Penelope hailed the move-
ment with undisguised relief. “Now
for the story,” she said, as she took a
pile of smudged and blotted paper out
of a drawer and put the pages in order.
“Here it is, and here's a blue pencil
for you.”
“Why a blue pencil 2 " I asked.
“You must have a blue pencil to
make the alterations. All the best
editors use them.”
“But I never can vºrite with a blue
pencil,” I protested. “Besides, they're
so unpleasant to lick.”
She threw the implement with a
gesture of contempt into the waste-
paper basket and handed me the
manuscript. Penelope's writing is evil
enough at the best of times, but here
there was hardly a sentence that had
not been crossed out and re-written–
some of them several times over. The
whole thing was a nightmare palimp-

hair. And I like the name Jasper
and I hate Dick. So there." -
When Penelope clinches a statement
with “So there,” it is useless to argue
the matter further. Meekly enough I
invited her to continue her synopsis.
“The heroine,” she resumed, “is
Carmencita Delafontaine. Both her
parents died when she was a child.
Her mother was an Italian opera-
singer and her father an English artist
of Huguenot extraction. Their mar-
riage was a very romantic one. While
| sketching one day in Venice, Maurice
Delafontaine—that's the father; he
was really a great artist, but was not
properly appreciated until after his
death. He used to have awful rows
with the critics, and wrote very clever
i sarcastic letters about them to the
papers; so of course that made them
all the more bitter against him. And
he wouldn't sell any of his pictures,
but left them all to Carmencita when
| he died of a broken heart a few months
aſter his wife's death. And the pic-
tures came to be worth thousands of
| pounds each, and CHRISTIEs went
down on their knees to Carmencita to
| sell them, but she wouldn't, because
she worshipped her father's memory
and was very strong-minded and wrote
stories at ten guineas a thousand words.
Do you like it?”
I made a non-committal gurgle.
“I thought you would. Well, I was
telling you about the romantic way in
which Carmencita's parents got mar-
ried. He was sketching one day from
it gondola which was moored to the
wall of an old castle when he heard a
most exquisite voice singing the what-
d'you-call-it from Traviata. The voice
came from a window right above him,
and he was so entranced that he
climbed up the wall --
“Fortunately there happened to be
a rope - ladder suspended from the
window," I suggested.
“Oh, something of the sort; or else
he clambered up the ivy. Do they
have ivy in Venice? Find out for me,
will you? However, he got on to the
window-ledge, and just as the singer
had finished he chimed in with the
tenor's part. He had a naturally fine
baritone voice • *
“Baritone?” I inquired.
“Oh, well, it must have been the
baritone's part he sang. He certainly
was a baritone, because he had an
auburn beard, and it needn't have been
the thing from Traviata, but something
from something else. You mustn't
worry about these trivial points just
now : the main thing is the plot.”
“Yes, the main thing is the plot." I
assented. “Suppose you drop Car-
mencita's parents for the present and
come to it. What's the story all
about 2."
“I’m telling you: you can't gain a
proper impression of Carmencita's ex-
traordinary character unless you know
something about her parents and her
upbringing. She was educated on
entirely novel lines. Until she was
seventeen a 1. -
“No, no,” I insisted firmly; “I want
the plot, and nothing but the plot.
What about Jasper and Dick?" -
“I was coming to them. Jasper
Lascelles is the editor of the magazine
that takes Carmencita's stories, and fell
in love with her, long before he had
ever seen her, through reading her
manuscripts. Dick Ferrers had the
education of a gentleman, but chose to
become an art-dealer, and makes love
to Carmencita in order to obtain pos-
session of her father's pictures, which
are worth millions. Now you see how
necessary the other part is.” --
“Yes; but what do the rivals do?
What of their struggle?” . -
“Well, that 's as far as I've got at
present. I haven't quite thought out
the rest of the plot, except that
Jasper, of course, marries Carmen-
cita in the end, after a misunder-
standing, because Dick had prompted
Carmencita to send in a story under
an assumed name, and Jasper had
rejected it. Only it wasn't really his
fault, because Dick had altered it before
it reached him, making it bad grammar
and not quite the kind of story a nice
girl would write. It's just here that I

the best way to work out the plot.”
“I’m fearfully sorry,” I said, “but
I haven't time to read it now ; I'm
expected home to dinner. What I
should suggest is that you finish it off
on your own lines, have it typed, and
then send it on to me, and I may be
able to make a few suggestions.”
“Well, I don't think you 're very
helpful; besides, it costs such a lot to
get things typed. But if you really
like the story I suppose it 's worth
while. I'll send it on in a day or two.”
It was over a fortnight before I
received an untidy brown-paper parcel
from Penelope. On opening it I found
the manuscript in the very self-same
state of disreputability that had so
repelled me on the occasion of my
visit, together with a note in Penelope's
most impossible scrawl.
“I'm afraid,” she wrote, “that I
shan't be able to find time to finish off
the story, as I have just joined some
ducky art-classes. So let's corroborate
over the story. You finish it and send
it somewhere, and we'll halve the
profits.” -
But I make it a rule never to
“corroborate"—even with so versatile
a creature as Penelope. -

It was a windy day and I
was principally concerned with
trying to keep my hat on:
therefore it was not until the
West Highland terrier had
wound himself round my legs
with the cunning and precision
of an American bolas that I
quite realized what was happen-
ing. Then I looked up and saw
Miss Wilkinson at the other
end of the lariat, “Oh, it's you,
is it?” I said. “Do you think
it quite nice to entrap single
young men in this manner?”

bred to begin with ; if not, of
course his eyes would drop out.
And, secondly, it makes the
blood rush to the head, thereby
enhancing the mental faculties.
Now I'm going to take him
off the lead, and speak to him
quietly but distinctly.”
Replaced upon the pavement,
Alan Breck Stewart looked up
at us with eyes that positively
beamed with docile intelligence.
For some minutes after he trot-
ted quietly to heel, meditating.
“It's no use, really,” said
Miss Wilkinson, “he's certain
to do something stupid; we've
lost him twice already and had
to pay two guineas reward.
“he will do it; you're the third this
morning, and the last was a police-
man. Are you going this way?
You might come home and lunch
with us.”
“Well, I wasn't, you know,” I said;
“but since you have roped me in, I
may as well go quietly to the stockade.
What's his name 2 ”
“Alan Breck Stewart,” she replied
as I disentangled myself, “Breck for
short.”
“I see; Breck, Breck, Breck, like that
poem of TENNYSON's. What you ought
really to do with a puppy that hasn't
learnt to follow is to put him on a
little wheeled trolley, with his paws
fastened down firmly, and drag him
along. Then he would get the hang
of the thing, you know.”
At this point we cast anchor suddenly
round the base of a lamp-post.
“It's so silly of him,” said Miss
Wilkinson; “he never can see that he
must go back the way he came; he
always will try to get round the other
side.”
“It is a case for firmness,” I declared;
“leave him to me a moment. First of
all I am going to hold him up by the tail.”
“Why?” she asked.
“Well, it shows whether he's well-
He's quite a well-known contributor
to the papers.”
At this point the adventurer espied a
sparrow in the middle of the road, and
cantered briskly towards it with that
peculiar slantwise action of his hind-
quarters which he appears to think suits
his style of beauty. At the same moment
a huge touring-car came up the road,
and jerked itself out of forty miles an
hour with a wrench that must have
taken a month's wear out of the tyres.
It just managed to stop about a foot
in front of Alan Breck, who, standing
unperturbed on the spot where he
had confidently marked his sparrow,

sniffed the front of the car and trotted
slowly back to us. Meanwhile the
chauffeur was saying things softly to
himself about dogs in general and
Alan Breck in particular—things that
reflected on the Scotchman's character
and pride of pedigree. He also seemed
to believe in a future life for animals.
I apologised, and we put Alan Breck on
the lead again. His bag for the rest
of the way consisted of an errand-boy,
a perambulator, his own front-paws
(three times), and two ladies, who,
owing to the curious conformation of
their skirts, seemed to have some
difficulty in walking as it was. Each
time Alan Breck looked up patiently
and asked to be unwound. He had a
good appetite for his puppy biscuit at
lunch and, after thoroughly testing the
china plate with his tongue to see
whether leadless glaze had been em-
ployed, lay down with a sigh in front
of the fire, probably to compose a new
Scotch reel. - -
THE GRUMBLERS CORNER.
Le Matin has established a column
in which all kinds of grievances may
be stated. Mr. Punch adopts the idea
for his own dissatisfied countrymen.
Mr. LANSBURY, M.P., writes: “There
is no scandal to compare with the
waste of time and energy in the House
of Commons. I recently made a care-
ful analysis of a day's proceedings, and
I found that, of the seven hours occupied
in speeches, two hours twenty-five
minutes were given to idle forms of
courtesy. Such a phrase as “Honour-
able Member for So-and-so " makes me
mad. None of us think other Members
honourable, and the sooner we cease
to pretend that we do the better for
England. The way to refer to another
Member is by his surname only. I am
plain LANSBURY, and I expect others to
be the same. Again there is the absurd
tradition of catching the SPEAKER's eye.
Every man should have as much right
to speak as another, and should not
have to wait to be called. In short,
the House is not a place of legislation
at all, but a museum of mediaevalism.
Coming now to the third, and perhaps
worst scandal, I refer to the PRESIDENT
of THE LOCALGovI.RNMENT BoARD–”
[Not here. ED. Punch.]
Mr. Jay Penn writes: “I wish to
protest with all my power against the
modern practice of allowing publishers
in their advertisements to eulogise their
books. That privilege belongs to the
reviewer and the reader, and to them
alone. Publishers' advertisements be-
come more disgusting every day. Each
new book is a classic and a miracle,
He
until we don't know where we are, relatively harmless; now that we have
and the conscientious literary man who
chances to have a publisher of decent
restraint is lost.”
Mr. B. Punter writes: “A most
unsatisfactory state of things which
needs careful legislation is the irre-
sponsibility of the Press. There are a
number of papers, each assuming great
authority and each making money by
this authority, which are permitted
by an apathetic and cynical Govern-
ment to mislead exactly as they like.
I will give you an example-racing
tips. With one or two exceptions all
our morning and evening papers offer
their readers advice as to the horses
that will win. And how often are they
right? Almost never. Yet all do it
and make money by it. Take, for
example, the Grand National, recently
run. Had I taken the advice of the
seven daily papers which I read I
should have backed seven horses not
one of which reached the post at all.
Is not this an abuse? And an indefen-
sible one? I think so."
Mr. LowTHER BRIDGER writes:
“Can nothing be done to combat the
confusion which arises from two public
men being allowed to bear the same,
or practically the same, name. For
many years Mr. LLoyd GEORGE was
allowed to enjoy the possession of this
combination undisturbed. Iłut now on
the Unionist benches there sits a
Member who has turned the CHAN-
CELLOR of THE EXCHEQUER's name
upside down—I refer to Mr. GEORGE
LLoyd. Unless this evil precedent is
dealt with in summary fashion we may
expect such further enormities as the
appropriation of the names Churchill
Winston, Harcourt Lewis, and Buxton
Sydney by the rank and file of the
Opposition.”
“An Indignant Father" writes from
Hyde Park Gardens: “When I was a
boy I, like most of my contemporaries,
suffered from the measles. But I did
so on the strict understanding that
there should be no recurrence of the
complaint; and this agreement, for
which our family doctor went bail, has
been strictly kept. For some thirty-
eight years I have enjoyed a perfect
immunity from this disorder. But
now mark the difference. My son,
aged fifteen, has had measles three
times running in three successive
years, and the doctor at his school
—a very expensive public school—
has refused to guarantee that he will
not have it again. Apart from the
serious expense in which I have been
involved, this state of affairs casts a
lurid light on our vaunted progress
in bacteriological research. When we
knew nothing about bacilli they were
identified and named them, they dis-
play a revolting virulence.”
Professor W. A. S. HEwins writes:
“It grieves me to have to record the
painful fact that at all the instrumental
concerts held during the All-British
shopping week no effort was made to
dispense with the French horn ; worse
still, that during the same period the
native worth of the tenor oboe was
still disguised under the gallicised title
of the cor anglais.”
THE POET'S RESOLVE.
Lo! the woods to life awaken;
Spears of green commence to sprout;
Dormice, from their trances shaken,
Simple nourishment have taken

Youthful herdsmen with their choices

IT was a little Circular
(Marked “Confidential” too)
Containing information
Painful, perhaps, but true.
But someone treacherously let
The cat out of the bag,
Which caused of late at Question time
A most unholy “rag.”
It was a little Minister
Whose speech was one long cry:
“Please, Sir, I never did it;
Please, Sir, it wasn't I.
Please, Sir, it was another boy
Who ought to bear the blame,
But he's no longer with us–

That, in the following days,
Bedaubed the little Minister
With its most fulsome praise,
For nobly disavowing
The obscurantist creed
Embodied in the contents
Of this pernicious screed.
It was, if I may put it
In language bald and brief,
The story of an honest man
Imperilled by a thief,
And thrown instanter to the wolves
By a disloyal chief,
In whom extremists still profess
Their unimpaired belief.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Mr. John TREveXA can see no good in a Radical and,
politics being as they are, is without hope. , Casting his
student's mind a generation or two ahead, he has no
difficulty in picturing an England devoted to hedonist
Socialism, given over to blind worship of its players,
practising violence, robbery and free love, slaughtering the
remnants of its old aristocracy (in which alone the author
is sketched lightly, but with a sure hand. One or two of
her people make palpable pretence of being drawn from
actual models, and Mr. SoMERSET MAUGHAM may have a
word to say about that.
By her title she means the point beyond which the strong
silent husband will not go in his tolerance of the tertium,
quid. But Mrs. LEveRSoN has her own “limit,” and if she
had followed the dictates of temperament she would have
drawn the line on this side of serious developments instead
of boldly grasping the fringe of tragedy, as she does towards
the end. Here, I think, in her right effort to avoid obvious

managed by an alien ad-
venturer and eventually
leased to Japan, with no

payment of a fat premium

doubtedly something in the

aggeration could only have

vancement of a low-class

A logical exposition of tfiel
possible end of modern ten-
dencies might have been un-
dertaken on these lines, but
this book, a realistic novel of
the future, cannot seriously
pretend even to logic. The
narrative is graphic and the
excitement is well main-
tained, but the moral of it
all, upon which the Preface
insists, is not convincing. I
am a bit of a Tory myself,
but I am left comfortably
sure that things are not so
bad as all that.
Humour comes more
easily to Mrs. LEVERSoN
than to most women-writers.

would surely jib at the net-
work of wrinkles with which
she covered her face, and
Never too subtle, and sometimes, perhaps, a little too
easy, it colours her work with a very natural gaiety.
But she cannot always keep her own personality out
of the dialogue; as when the adoring flapper says of her
baby Guardsman: “Oh the jolly way he has of saying
“Righto' and ‘You’re all right.’” I am confident that
the ſlapper thought it, but I am equally confident that
she would never have said it. So Mrs. LEveRson says it for
her. In this new book, The Limit (GRANT Richards), one
recognises the pleasant mot about the golden-haired lady
who darkened her locks at the roots; and I am glad that
the author has at last embodied in print a repartee of her
| own from long ago that deserved to be enshrined. She
does not attempt to analyse her characters very closely, but
she can seize a rapid impression of a type. Her American,
for instance, who is anxious to be very English and good form,
— still more (I speak as a man)
at the mysterious removable pads, inflated with air, which
gave her the bust and figure of a buxom Juno of sixty,
in place of her own “admirable slenderness.” And even if
they allowed the possibility of the wig and the wrinkles
and the pneumatic pads, and admitted that by their
aid a slim young girl might day by day for weeks make
a number of people, some of whom knew her quite well,
take her for a stout old woman, an imaginary cousin of
the noble house of the Glenalvas, they would be troubled
by the reflection that someone would inevitably have
looked her up in Debrett. And then her whole scheme
would have fallen to the ground. The next time that Miss
EveRETT-GREEN wishes one of her heroines to bowl out the
public, I should recommend her to set the field in more
orthodox fashion, and, above all, not to hamper her with
“pads” in the wrong place. -

Though his wife is trailing her off-side boot .*
In the ochreous ooze, and he hears her purr e.
As his mate at the tiller makes eyes at her.
A lurch and a slip—she is overboard, . .
And her lover dives in at the nearest place.
No sign on the part of her legal lord
As the waters close on their last embrace,
Except that he smiles, “I shall miss them both,”
And leans to his oar with a grateful oath.

At the WINNING-Post.
She waits in the grand-stand's grassy patch,
Externally cool, but her manner clothes
A throbbing heart, for they ride a match,
The man she loves and the man she loathes;
A hundred sovereigns they ride to win,
With a purse, her sewing, to put them in.
Neck and neck, at identical rates,
They ride to the finish, a clear dead-heat.
“Shall we run it off 2" says the man she hates;
And the other, “Not me; I'm much too beat ' "
Then the first : “There are prizes enough for two,
And the declaration I'll leave to you.”
“Very well,” says the man she loves, “ you're free
To pocket the purse—the cash for me!”

THE GOLFER'S EXCUSE.
JAMES is one of those players who
nearly always hit a tremendously long
ball off the first tee just to dishearten
their adversaries. But this time his
“Albatross" flapped heavily over the
undulating turf and beached itself
securely in the shelving sand of the
bunker, while m “Cormorant "
bounced on the top, struggled gamely
and went over into the Elysian fields.
My heart swelled with joy and I
talked gaily to James as we went
forward to examine the site of his
proposed excavations. His first error
was the prelude (as they say in the
Sporting Press) to a series of similar
misfortunes, and at the fifth hole I was
four up. As we walked to the next
tee he was still rubbing sand out of his
eyes, and after we had both driven off
he said to me solemnly, “It's no use
concealing it any longer, old man;
I am in love.”
Dissembling my inward jubilation so
- well that I actually assumed a mask
of sorrow, I condoled with him. “So
bad as that,” I said; “have you tried
Thanātogen? They say it's a wonderful
thing for these internal complaints,
and what's more puts beef into the
drive. I once wrote a little poem
beginning:—
“There's nºthing to beat Thanatügen ;
# 's better for golfers than Sloe Gin ;

“Thank you," said James, “I will take
it on trust.”
Right up to the turn he continued to
foozle deplorably, and seemed incapable
of keeping his eye on the ball (“Very
possibly,” I said to myself, “her name
is Daisy or Celandine or something of
that sort”); but at the tenth hole,
when I was already lured into a
sense of serene confidence and had
even tried one or two chip-shots,
he suddenly began to find his game.
Somehow I mislaid mine at the
same moment, and by the time we
reached the fourteenth green I was
only two up, and filled with bitter and
cynical reflections. “Love,” I mut-
tered to my caddie, “love, indeed!
He is probably out after her money,
poor girl; or else she has a title. Ah!|
the hollowness of these so-called
romances.” It was just after this that
I played an approach-shot into the
female sand-box belonging to the next
tee, and at the end of the round James
was one up. He purred with satisfac-
tion as we walked into the club-house,
and it was not until I had drunk four
cups of tea that I felt better, and
asked him gently, but reproachfully,
“Who is she 2 You haven't told me
anything about her yet."
“Who's who 2" said James.
I reminded him sternly of his acci-
dent, but he only laughed. “Oh,
that l” he said. “Well, I had to make
some excuse for playing so atrociously
at the start, and people never seem to
believe you if you say you have a touch
of liver or sat up late working the
night before. It wasn't true. I say,
you remember my last baffy shot but
one 2"
“No,” I said, “I don't, and I don't
want to."
Next time I play with James I shall
tell him that I have just been medically
examined and found to be in a gallop-
ing consumption, with only two more
months to live. That will probably
trick him into using his brassy out of
rough lies, and with any luck I ought
to down him.

Posto, the new game. I say
“game.” Well, it is a game.
But please understand that
it is one of those games
that dignify the word. Chess,
Bridge, Golf, Billiards, Cric-
ket—it will fall naturally into
rank with games like these—
games that satisfy something
fundamental in the human
mind, and in consequence
live on indefinitely. True,
the origin of Posto is not
shrouded in antiquity. But
even on this point our pos-
terity's posterity may in,
otherwise.
Posto is a game that only
admits of one player. The
first thing he has to do is to
learn the road to the dust-
bin. This done he is ready
for the Posto Spot. The
Posto Spot is simply a mo:
ment of time. At this period
of the game it has one dom-
* feature for the player.
It is a monent that may on
no account be actively ap-
proached, beckoned, or en-
couraged in any way. The
player is therefore advised
to return to the ordinary
occupations of his life, and,
as far. as possible, to forget
Posto.
Possibly on a Sunday after-
noon—possibly on a muggy
day during, say, influenza
convalescence, when ordinary
time seems a tinge more or-
dinary than usual, our player
will realise abruptly that he
is on the Posto Spot. No one
can tell him when he is there.

Before I end, a word to the
timid. The player does not
meet anybody on the road to
the dust-bin. No. It is quite
a mistake to be afraid of this.
The reason is that he acts at
once. If he were to wait to
think the matter over and act
later, it is a 1000 to 1 that he
would meet somebody, and
100 to 1 that it would be the
somebody that he would most
wish to avoid. Acting at
once, however, he just catches
the road clear. It is a pe-
culiar thing. I can offer no
theory to explain it. But

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SEASON'S PROSPECTS.
THE great question in the Mallory
family just now is whether Dick will
get into the eleven this year. Con-
fident as he is himself, he is taking no
risks.
“We're going to put the net up
to-morrow,” he said to me as soon as I
arrived, “and them you'll be able to
bowl to me. How long are you
staying?”
“Till to-night,” I said quickly.
“Rot l You're fixed up here till
Tuesday, anyhow.”
“My dear Dick, I've come down for
a few days' rest. If the weather per-
mits, I may have the croquet things
out one afternoon and try a round, or
possibly—”
“I don't believe you can bowl,” said
Bobby rudely. Bobby is twelve—five
years younger than Dick. It is not
my place to smack Bobby's head, but
somebody might do it for him.
“Then that just shows how little
you know about it,” I retorted. “In
a match last September I went on to
bowl x -
“Why?"
“I knew the captain,” I explained.
“Well, as I say, he asked me to go on
to bowl, and I took four wickets for
thirteen runs. There!”
“Good man,” said Dick.
“Was it against a girls' school?”
said Bobby. (You know, Bobby is
simply asking for it.)
“It was not. Nor were children of
twelve allowed in without their peram-
bulators.”
“Well, anyhow,” said Bobby, “I bet
Phyllis can bowl better than you.”
“Is this true?” I said to Phyllis.
I asked her because in a general way
my bowling is held to be superior to
that of girls of fifteen. Of course,
she might be something special.
“I can bowl Bobby out,” she said
modestlv.
I iºd at Bobby in surprise and
then shook my head sadly.
“You jolly well shut up,” he said,
turning indignantly to his sister.
“Just because you did it once when
the sun was in my eyes
“Bobby, Bobby,” I said, “this is
painful hearing. Let us be thankful
that we don't have to play against
girls' schools. Let us * >
But Bobby was gone. Goaded to
anger, he had put his hands in his
pockets and made the general observa-
tion “Rice-pudding”—an observation
inoffensive enough to a stranger, but
evidently of such deep private signifi-
cance to Phyllis that it was necessary
for him to head a pursuit into the
shrubbery without further delay.
“The children are gone,” I said to
Dick. “Now we can discuss the
prospects for the season in peace.”
I took up The Sportsman again. “I
see that Kent is going to—”
“The prospects are all right,” said
Dick, “if only I can get into form soon
enough. Last year I didn't get going
till the end of June. By the way,
what sort of stuff do you bowl?”
“Ordinary sort of stuff,” I said,
“with one or two bounces in it. Do
you see that Surrey 2 p.
“Fast or slow 2 ”
“Slow—that is, you know, when I
do bowl at all. I’m not quite sure
this season whether I hadn't better —”
“Slow,” said Dick, thoughtfully;
“that's really what I want. I want
lots of that.”
“You must get Phyllis to bowl to
you,” I said with detachment. “You
know, I shouldn't be surprised if
Lancashire—”
“My dear man, girls can't bowl.
She fields jolly well, though.”
“What about your father?”
“His bowling days are rather over.
He was in the eleven, you know, thirty
years ago. So there's really nobody
but—”
“One's bowling days soon get over,”
I hastened to agree.
But I know now exactly what the
prospects of the season—or, at any
rate, of the first week of it—are.
MR. MALLORY.
The prospects here are on the whole
encouraging. To dwell upon the bright
side first, there will be half-an-hour's
casual bowling, and an hour and a
half's miscellaneous coaching, every
day. On the other hand, some of his
best plants will be disturbed, while
there is more than a chance that he
may lose the services of a library
window.
MRs. MALLORY.
The prospects here are much as last
year, except that her youngest born,
Joan, is now five, and consequently
rather more likely to wander in the way
of a cricket ball or fall down in front
of the roller than she was twelve
months ago. Otherwise Mrs. Mallory
faces the approaching season with calm,
if not with complete appreciation.
DICK.
Of Dick's prospects there is no need
to speak at length. He will have two
hours' batting every day against, from
a batsman's point of view, ideal bowl-
ing, and in addition the whole-hearted
admiration of all of us. In short, the
outlook here is distinctly hopeful.
PHYLLIs.
The prospects of this player are,
from her own point of view, bright,
as she will be allowed to field for two
hours a day to the beloved Dick. She
is also fully qualified now to help with
the heavy roller. A new experiment is
to be tried this season, and she will be
allowed to bowl for an odd five-minutes
at the end of Dick's innings to me.
BoBBY
enters upon the coming season with
confidence as he thinks there is a
chance of my bowling to him too; but
he is mistaken. As º he will be
in charge of the heavy roller, and he
will also be required to slacken the
ropes of the net at the end of the day.
His prospects, however, are certainly
improved this season, as he will be
qualified to bowl for the whole two
hours, but only on the distinct under-
standing (with Phyllis) that he does
his own fielding for himself.
Of the prospects of
JoAN
I have already spoken above. There
remain only the prospects of
MYSELF,
which are frankly rotten. They con-
sist chiefly of two hours' bowling to
the batting of Dick (who hits them back
very hard), and ten minutes' batting
to the bowling of Phyllis (slow, mild)
and Bobby (fast wides); for Dick, having
been ordered by the captain not to
strain himself by trying to bowl, is not
going to try. It is extremely doubtful
whether Bobby will approve of my
action, while if he or Phyllis should,
by an unlucky accident, get me out,
I should never hear the last of it. In
this case, however, there must be added
to Bobby's prospects the possibility of
his getting his head definitely smacked.
Fortunately—it is my only consol-
ation—the season will be a short one.
It ends on Tuesday. A. A. M.
A Rip among the Railways.
The rumour that that quaint old
anachronism, the London and South-
Western Railway, has waked up to the
necessity of allowing through-tickets
to be issued between the Tubes and
stations on its own lines over which
the District, Railway has running
powers is lacking in confirmation. It
seems improbable that a Company
which took years and years and years
to arrange for the issue of through-
tickets between these same lines and
the Metropolitan Railway should
recognise at this early stage the
existence of the Tubes. After all,
they are only a few years old.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, April 11.
—Looking across at WINTERTON's
manly form, hearing his not infrequent
speeches(sometimes monosyllabic) con-
tributed to debate, recognising his
remarkable parliamentary instinct,
have sometimes wondered how it all
came about. And he still so young
and so fair! Secret disclosed in portly
volume entitled The Speakers of the
House of Commons, written by
ARTHUR IRwin DASENT and
in right hand what looks like a sprig'
of shillelagh, apparently ready to bring
it down on any deserving knuckle or
head. Sort of accessory that would
befit our noble Earl when remonstrating
with WINSOME WINSTON on points of
decorum and order.
Other links with old parliamen-
tary times are provided in this fasci-
nating book. Six hundred years before
Mr. LowTHER was conducted to the
Chair whose high traditions he has
splendidly maintained, one of his kith
and kin sat in Parliament as Knight
longo intervallo. The greatest of these
was ARTHUR, who with distinction
filled the Chair in five successive Par-
liaments. Of Sir RICHARD ONSLow,
Speaker in 1708-10, it was recorded:
“There was an ease and openness in
his address that even at first sight
gave him the heart of every man he
spoke to.” That might well have been
written of the present Earl ONSLow.
All who know him will recognise.the
curious appositeness and accuracy of
the characterization.
Regret to find the earliest recorded
published by JoHN LANE.
Amid score of things learned
in this storehouse of parlia-
mentary erudition find that in
the MEMBER FoR HoRSHAM
House has been entertaining
unawares a descendant of a
Speaker who filled the Chair in
the decadent days of the STUARTs.
Sir Edward TURNour presided
over debate through the memor-
able epoch that lay between 1661
and 1670. This exceeded by three
years LENTHALL's term of office,
theretofore the longest period.
Seems almost a pity that the
laws of nature did not permit
concatenation of circumstance
whereby our Lord WINTERTON
might have been seated in Par-
liament to look after his some-
what rapacious progenitor. The
Journals of House contain an
order passed shortly before re-
tirement of Mr. SPEAKER TURN-
oUR, possibly hastening the
event, directing “That the Back
Door of the Speaker's Chambers
be nailed up and not opened
during any sessions of Parlia-
ment.” It was said at the
time—in those days there was
malicious gossip in the House—
that this cryptic injunction had

appearance in House of forbears
of the MASTER of ELIBANK led
to what is to-day known in Par-
liamentary reports as “a scene.”
ALEXANDER MURRAY, brother to
the Lord ELIBANK of that day,
was summoned to Bar of House
in order to be reprimanded for
alleged riotous behaviour in
Covent Garden during recent
election for Borough of West-
minster. Ordered by the
SPEAKER to kneel whilst the
right hon. gentleman addressed
to him a few pregnant remarks,
MURRAY refused to obey, and
was forthwith haled to New-
gate, where he remained till the
Prorogation brought about his
release.
Business done.—Progress re-
ported in Committee on Veto
Bill. Not much made. But if
we wait till resumption of sit-
tings after Easter we shall, as
the PREMIER with characteristic
brevity puts it, “see.”
Wednesday.—Usual miscel-
laneous debate on Motion for
adjourning over Recess. Good
Friday too close at hand and
holiday too brief for heart to
be thrown into the business.
Business dome.—Adjourned
something to do with backstair in-
fluence. Howbeit there was much ado
when discovery was made that Mr.
SPEAKER was secretly in the pay of the
East India Company.
To this day there hangs on the wall
of the dining-room in the SPEAKER's
House, amongst other portraits of
his predecessors, one of Sir Edward
TURNOUR. It was presented more than
a hundred years ago by the regnant
Earl WINTERTON. No personal re-
semblance to be found in latest bearer
of honoured name. SPEAKER TURNour
of 1661 was shorter, stouter, not to
speak of being balder, than his popular
descendant. There is, however, one
characteristic point. Sir Edward, in
laager behind the Mace, holds uplifted
of the Shire for Westmorland. In the
Parliament of 1597 there was returned
as Member for Brackley, Northants,
one RANDoIPH CREWE, forbear of the
statesman temporarily retired from
the leadership of the House of Lords.
Seventeen years later Sir RANDoLPH
was elected Speaker. That is only
half the story. He was, at due
interval, succeeded in the Chair by
his brother THOMAS, a unique dis-
tinction for a family.
More familiar is the fact that the
Lord Chairman of the House of Lords,
whose resignation is pending under
circumstances of health everyone de-
plores, is a direct descendant of not
fewer than three progenitors who sat in
the Speaker's Chair. But they came
till Tuesday next. One of the
briefest Easter holidays known in
modern times. Members complain
that arrangement hardly leaves them
time to get up to Hampstead Heath
for a donkey ride, or to Green-
wich for a roll, adown its grassy
slopes. This, Cousin Hugh points
out, comes of a truculent Ministry
imperiously forcing the pace of revolu-
tionary legislation. In spite of arctic
weather prevalent of late, HUGH goes
scattering round rare flowers of speech.
Described the Mother of Parliaments as
“in alarge measure a corrupt assembly.”
wherein “Members are forced to put
up with the vicarious insolences of
a Deputy.” This a backhander for
WINSTON in charge of Parliament Bill
during PREMIER's absence.

A BILLIARD FORECAST.
FROM The Sportsman of January 1,
1913.−The outstanding event of the
past year, in the world of billiards,
has undoubtedly been the new regu-
lation about the losing hazard off the
red. Mr. GEORGE GRAY's (unfinished)
break of 10,179 at Leicester in June, on
which occasion he occupied the table
for three consecutive weeks, and his
opponent felt justified in spending the
week-ends in the country, has at last
opened the eyes of the authorities. It
is not generally known that in the
course of this match the right-hand
centre pocket had to be three times
renewed by a local upholsterer. The
stroke was repeated with such perfect
precision that, after the first ten days,
no objection whatever was raised to
spectators placing their hats on the
left-hand side of the table, and on one
evening towards the close the umpire
went so far as to take his tea off
it. While heartily sympathising with
Mr. GRAY, we feel sure that he will
recognise that in the best interests of
the game the new regulation could be
no longer delayed, and his favourite
stroke was bound to go the way of
the spot-stroke and the anchor-stroke.
Now that only ten such consecutive
losing hazards off the red are permis-
| sible we look for a revival in the
interest taken in the game.
From The Sportsman of January 1,
1915.-It has been a year of great un-
There is no
doubt that the advent of the Chilian
champion, Signor Pianola, has shown
up weak spots in the game as it is at
present played. His wonderful new
stroke, by which he makes the red ball
run along the top of the cushion, off
the spot, into one corner pocket, while
his own ball screws back into the other,
has led to some astounding scores.
As he always makes six in this manner
at a single stroke his figures mount
rapidly, and he appears to be able to
repeat the performance indefinitely, so
that his º break of 23,675
at Wolverhampton, in September, was
compiled in the remarkably short
period of scventeen days. The authori-
ties are, however, looking into the
matter, and drastic action is expected.
It is abundantly clear that the game
has become too easy.
From The Sportsman of January 1,
1925–The redoubtable Scot, Alexander
McKettrick, who has caused such a
profound sensation by his (unfinished)
break of 78,952 at Exeter, which began
in October, and was suspended in the
beginning of last week, when the
umpire declared the spot ball no longer
playable, informed our representative

(Mr. BALFour.)
ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE OLD
GUARI),
(Mr. Chaplix )
in the course of a chat last evening
that he had spent no fewer than eight
years in perfecting his new policy of
chivying the white. He pointed out
that the red ball was now so hampered
and protected by limitations that he
had found it best to tuck it out of the
way under the bottom cushion while
he goes in off the white into each of the
six pockets in turn. It is understood
that the special regulations for the
coming season are now under discus-
Slon.
From The Sportsman of 1951–The
match between Mr. Percy Plump and
Herr Hans Kartofflen for the world's
championship, which begins at Widnes
on February 3, will be played under
the new regulations. That is to say,
with the circular table, the oblique
pockets, and the diminished red. "It
is, by the way, whispered in certain
circles that Mr. Plump has been
elaborating a new stroke off the bunker
guarding the centre pocket, which may
cause trouble. Herr Kartofflen has
lodged a protest against the exten-
sion of the baulk, pointing out—not
without, reason—that being a man
of small stature it makes it almost.
impossible for him to play from behind
the popping-crease without the use of
the long rest. There is something, we
think, to be said on both sides of this
question. - -
Much interest is manifested in the
probable effect of the two new regu-
lations—that which lays down that
every stroke shall include a cannon off
the red, and that which compels the
player to use both ends of the cue
alternately. It is hoped that they will
not so far reduce the scoring as to
cause any further marked curtailment
in the leisure of the performer who is
not in play. The old custom of paying
a visit to the Continent has already
fallen into desuetude, but short trips
to British beauty-spots should still be
possible. - - -
The table will be tilted, as is
customary, at an angle of 13 degrees.

THE GREAT MIND AT WORK.
ARTHUR is a novelist, and yet he
is my husband. They all told me,
when I allowed it to happen, that one
should never marry novelists because
they are always about the house when
you don't want them, and of no use
when you do. But after all it isn't as
if I went into a showroom full of
eligible young men (labelled) and said,
“I will take that one.” Besides, he
didn't mention the novels at all until
I had said Yes. -
We have been married about a year
now, but, not seeing why even the

newly-married wife of a novelist with
private means should not have a few
friends to dinner, I asked the Went-
worths and Captain Prosser and old
Miss Walker and one or two others for
Tuesday night; but on Tuesday morn-
ing I could not for the life of me
arrange how they were to sit at table.
If I arranged it so that the people who
ought to sit next to each other did, the
people who ought not to sit next to
each other also did; if so that the
people who ought not to sit next to
each other didn't, the people who ought
to sit next to each other also didn't.
Perhaps I should have done better if
Arthur had not persisted in helping
me. This is Arthur's idea of help.
“Bill Wentworth to take you in and
sit on your right? Yes. No. I dare
say. He will tell you all about himself
and be very cross with you if you laugh
at him. He doesn't like being ragged.
His leg is like the communication cord,
obviously pullable, but not really meant
to be pulled. On the other hand, if
you show sympathy he will want more.
He will get you on to the subject of
hot baths and tell you that he always
has a cold one. The cold bath is the
most arrogant form of martyrdom. I

she thought her husband was becoming
a prig. I must mention her to Mrs.
Bill.”
“Thank you,” I said, biting the
pencil in despair, for we had been at it
for nearly an hour and had not even
started. “The question is rather, What
about Captain Prosser? Ought not he
to take me in 2 He is such a dear!”
In pressure of business Arthur follows
every line except the right one. “Short-
sighted husbands would take objection
to that,” he said, lighting a cigarette,
“but not so I. I should never be
jealous of another man. Just suppose,
for instance, that you were to carry on
with young Prosser. . . .”
“Arthur !” I exclaimed.
“Only suppose,” he answered, taking
up a position (horrors) before the fire.
“I should not be alarmed. I should
not even be angry. Husbands, my
dear, are like collar studs. When you
have them they only irritate you. To
lose them is to find you cannot do
without them.”
I tried a fresh start. “There is old
Miss Walker. What shall we do with
her?” -
“Yes,” he murmured. “That is the
question. Woman is an eternal pro-

“Darling,” I interrupted, with my
most flatteringsmile, “you are obviously
inspired this morning. It is very nice
to have your help like this, but isn't
it rather wasted on the mere arrange-
ment of a table? Why not sit down
now and write some more novels 2 ”
With a little persuasion Arthur came
to believe that he really was inspired,
and actually sat down at his desk and
started putting new nibs in his pens. I
put a nice sheet of clean paper before
him, stroked his hair, and left him
looking thoroughly important and
businesslike. Thence to interview the

But what about the arrangement of
the table? you ask. Ah! I had no
need to worry any more about that. I
knew that when I went in again to see
Arthur and ask him how the novel was
getting on he would show me a beauti-
ful plan of the table, drawn to scale by
himself, with everybody put to sit in
the only one place that everybody
could possibly sit in. And of course
he had. You know these Arthurs can
be quite useful as long as they are not
trying to be clever.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON HARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S SUPPLEMENT.
[With acknowledgments to The Times and its
South American Supplements.]
I.—BOLUMBIA.
Bolu MBIA AND GREAT BRITAIN.
It would be idle to pretend that Sir
EDw ARD GREY's recent great utterance
attracted any notice in Bolumbia, either
in the country at large or in the capital.
This probably is due to the circum-
stance that the local papers pay no
attention whatever to foreign affairs.
But it may not be a misapplication of
time to speculate a little as to what
the Bolumbians would have thought
had a translation of our Foreign
SECRETARY's weighty words come
their way. For Bolumbia, it has to be
borne in mind, is a country of some
millions of square miles, entirely sur-
rounded either by an impassable chain
of mountains or by the sea, and is thus
to some extent safeguarded by nature
from certain of the dangers that beset
such a country, for example, as
Germany—so near and accessible to
France, Austria, Holland, Denmark,
Russia, Belgium, and, last of all, to
the bloodthirsty Swiss. Any talk of
universal arbitration would necessarily
set the pulses beating in Germany;
but when you get a country like
Bolumbia, with its natural bulwarks,
why, then, any idealistic peace aspira-
tions, were they to reach it at all,
would fall on indifferent ears. But,
as we have said, Bolumbia knew
nothing about it.
OUR IMPREssions of U RAJAY.
(By a Correspondent.)
Entering Urajay, the capital of
Bolumbia, from the North, one is struck
by the change from country to town.
Where one had been seeing only the
boundless prairie one sees now houses
and streets. Nothing could be more
different. The wild horses meanwhile
give way to human beings.
One knows, moreover, at once that
one is not in an English town. The
walls are too white, the roofs too red.
The head-dresses both of the men and
women, to say nothing of their swarthy
complexions, are against it. The whole
air of the place, in short, is foreign.
The principal means of locomotion
in Urajay is walking. One sees people
walking in all directions. Carriages
one sees too, and carts loaded with pro-
duce. The whole scene is animated :
here a café, there a church ; here a
private house, there a shop.
Urajay is certainly smaller than
London. It would be absurd to com-
pare the two capitals, but it is larger
than Epping. The Government House
is in the centre, and here dwells the
President during his term of office, a
cinematoscope being constantly trained
on the back door to mark the succession
of rulers. For the Bolumbians are a
pleasure-loving race, and rather than
have nothing to laugh at in their
picture theatres they will improvise a
drama whenever they catch sight of the
muzzle of a camera. I’very adult, and
not a few of the children, carries a six-
shooter, while the hat-pins of the
women are all of tested steel. It is no
uncommon thing in a restaurant to see
a well-dressed woman refusing to pay
her bill, and, if pressed, stabbing not
only the waiter, but the proprietor to
death. - ~~
No doubt the quick temper of the
Urajayans is against them as neigh-
bours; but it has to be confessed that
by their energy and resource they hav
built up a wonderful city, which cannot
be too widely discussed.
ENGLISHMEN IN BoIUMBIA.
I.—LoRD BROADHEAD.
The brief and tempestuous life of
Hercules Bulley, first Baron Broad-
head, had many phases. It is barely
twenty-five years since he was sent
down from Christ Church for filling
the basin of Mercury in Tom Quad
with bottled beer and bathing in it in
broad daylight. His exploits as a jour-
nalist, when be wrote simultaneously
for The Church Times, The Tablet and
Reynolds's, are still fresh in the memory
of Fleet Street. From journalism he
passed to politics, but here too the
stormy petrel element in his character
militated against enduring success. He
accused the Speaker of gross partiality,
and when rebuked by the Opposition
he suddenly produced a corkscrew from
his pocket and drove it into the calf of
the Tory Leader. As a result of the
litigation which followed, Mr. Bulley
resigned his seat, but was shortly after
raised to the Peerage. The atmosphere
of the Upper House, however, was too
chilling for his ſervid temperament and
he suddenly disappeared from England,
re-emerging shortly afterwards as the
ringleader of the revolutionary party in
Bolumbia. At the head of the Franco-
English legion he drove out the Presi-
dent, Dr. Jabon de Verbena, and in-
stalled himself as Dictator, celebrating
his rule by a number of edicts which
still render the Republic of Bolumbia
the cynosure of the civilised world.
One of his first acts was to expel all
Jews and teetotalers from Bolumbia.
He also made it a penal offence to sell
methylated spirits for drinking pur-
poses. When the United States de-
clared war on Bolumbia, he led his
forces into the field, chanting war-songs
in a high falsetto to the accompaniment
of a ten-stringed lute, and so paralysed
the American rough-riders that in less
than a week the invaders had evacu-
ated Bolumbia. The memory of his
exploits still hangs about Oxford and
St. Stephen's, but his most conspicuous
services to humanity were rendered
in Bolumbia, where the natives still
allude to him by the affectionate nick-
name of “Fathead.”
MUSIC IN BoI,UMBIA.
By Dr. J'onald Bovey.
The musical instruments of Bolumbia
are limited in number, being practi-
cally confined to the Bom-bom, a rude
side-drum made of solid wood and
struck alternately at each end with an
implement called the Kampang; the
Tlericoatl, a rattle formed of shark skin,
containing sea shells; and lastly a
curious instrument of percussion, known
as the Popatopatop, which consists of
the bisected skull of the tapir with the
skin of the pangofilin stretched tightly
across. This is also played with the
Kampang, or sometimes with short
sticks made of petrified asparagus.
My colleague, Miss Slazenger, tells me
that she has discovered documentary
evidence that in the antediluvian
period of Bolumbia, before the invasion
of the Catepetlican hordes from Yuca-
tan, no fewer than 378 distinct types
of Popatopatop were in use, and I much
regret that I am unable to reproduce
them here. Readers, however, may be
referred to the XCIXth volume of the
new Encyclopædia Britannica, in which
an article of 514 pages is devoted to
this remarkable instrument.
For the rest it may be noted that the
natives of Bolumbia have a fascinat-
ing habit of singing through their
noses in absolutely unrelated keys, an
accomplishment in which they are not
excelled by any civilised nation.
CoRRESPONDENCE.
SIR,--It was stated of the Prefect
of Bexillico, at the recent celebration
of the foundation of the Republic of
Bolumbia, that to the first President,
the illustrious Don Ovadon, we owe the
inestimable privilege of a two-risotto
post. This is an error. Much as
the ever-to-be-remembered President
Ovadon did for his not-too-grateful
country, this particular act escaped
him. Throughout his whole fortnight's
period of Presidency the cheapest
stamp for a letter cost six risottos, and
for a postcard, three risottos. The
introduction of the two-risotto standard
was inaugurated in the same year as
Ovadon's Presidency, it is true, but by
the fourth President to succeed him,

[Armii. 19, 1911.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FIRE-ARMS DANGER.
SoME wives are wonderfully generous.
They are ready to make a present of
their husband to the first burglar who
asks for him.
Take my own case. I am not strong.
Of a studious nature, I have, I fear,
thrown physique to the dogs. I have
developed my brain at the expense of
my muscle. In these circumstances I
hold that, provided one is , insured
against the risk, one should allow
burglars, if they call, to work un-
disturbed. It would be crass folly to
interfere with them. My wife—who
is considerably younger than I-
holds different views in this respect.
Well, I hope she has had her lesson
now. -
The incident which I am about to
describe happened four weeks ago, but
I only now feel well enough to set it
down. My nerves are still all awry.
It started in the usual way. My
wife woke me up, and said she heard
noises downstairs. I listened, distinctly
heard a movement, and told my wife
that she must have been dreaming.
She then sat up, listened hard again,
and said it was no dream. At that I
sat up, and said I thought I did hear
something now, but it was obvious
what it was : it was the wind making
a door creak. “It's nothing of the
sort,” she said, “it’s a man got into
the house. Do go and see.” I then
went through all my stock arguments.
“Granted,” I said, “that it is a burglar,
what then? We are insured; why not
leave him alone 2 Moreover, think
what an unequal contest it would be.
Here am I awakened suddenly at
two o'clock in the morning, when my
vitality is at its very lowest, and asked
to face an armed ruffian who is at
his very best. He'll be able to see
me coming before I can see him, and
simply pot at me. Everything is in his
favour. Why, he'd only have to stamp
on my feet.” “It may not be a
burglar,” said my wife feebly; “go and
see.” “And catch cold for nothing?”
I added. “John,” said my wife, “I
believe you're afraid.” “Anyone but
a fool would be afraid,” I retorted,
getting slowly out of bed and donning
my dressing-gown and slippers.
I went downstairs and listened, and
could hear nothing now. “Well?"
said my wife on my return. “You
were right,” I answered, as I playfully
pinched her cheek; “there are fifteen
burglars in the dining-room and three
in the drawing-room.” “Funny?"
asked my wife. “Fairly,” I replied, as
I settled myself comfortably again in
bed. But not for long. Scarcely had
I let down my eyelids when she roused
me again. “I am quite certain this
time,” she said. “Do go down and see,
or we shall have them going upstairs and
frightening the servants.” A husband,
I suppose, is easier to get than a good
cook. “Oh, leave them alone,” I said.
“All right, I'll go myself,” she retorted,
and she made as though she would get
up. And I believe she would have done
so had I not anticipated her. My wife
is the very antipodes of me: she has
not sufficient imagination to know what
danger is, excels in sport, loves dress
and pleasure, and would dance a
dervish off his feet. She has just
those qualities which I lack, and ours,
I suspect, is the ideal union. I resolved
to make one last fight for my life. “I’ll
go,” I said; “but remember that black
does not suit you.” “Oh, go,” she
cried; “and take a stout stick, and,
when you come back, don't slam the
door, as I may be asleep;” and she
turned over and composed herself.
- When I got outside there was no
doubt at all about it. I distinctly heard
movements below. I was about to
fetch a knobkerry which I keep among
my curios, when a better idea struck
me. Why not try bluff? There was
my little sham pistol. After all, the
fellow would as likely as not wrench
the knobkerry, which I valued, from
my grasp, and use it against me, for
some burglars are shockingly dishonest.
The sham pistol had been given me
by a friend who bought it in Paris—
though I have since seen them here in
London at a shilling. It was rather an
ingenious little thing. An exact re-
production, in black metal, of a mag-
azine revolver, it was really a cigarette
case. You pulled the trigger and it
emitted a cigarette. Curiously enough,
I remember someone remarking once:
“A capital thing to frighten burglars
with.” So I fetched this from my
dressing-room, went downstairs quietly,
and threw open the dining-room door.
The electric light had been turned
on, and sure enough, in the far corner
of the room, there was an ugly-looking
customer stowing away my silver in a
bag. I surprised him as he had his
hand on a silver épergne which had
been given me by a friend for whom I
had done some little service. I was
peculiarly attached to this, as it had
an inscription on it to which I would
occasionally draw my wife's attention
as showing that there was someone,
anyhow, who had a high opinion of me.
“Hands up !” I cried, as I levelled
the sham pistol at the fellow. To my
surprise he complied with my request,
and the épergne fell to the ground.
“Don't shoot, guv'nor, and I'll come
with you.” “And now back out of the
He continued to obey me, and the more
he backed the more I liked it. The
majesty in man seemed to be aroused
in me, and I remember wishing my wife
could have seen me. Then, I suppose,
I grew elated and reckless. We were
in the hall now, and I quickened my
pace. All the time I had my finger on
the trigger. Suddenly an irresistible
impulse made me pull it—and an
innocuous cigarette shot out and fell
gently at the burglar's feet.
To attempt to take a burglar by
false pretences is a serious matter.
The man resented it. With care, the
doctors think, I shall be quite myself
in another couple of months. My
wife is nursing me, and I like to
think that I am rather a troublesome
patient.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN The Patrician (HEINEMANN), Mr. John GALsworthy
has made an admirable study of an ancient and honourable
house, lavish of service to the state according to the
traditions of its class, and now just beginning to be made
uncomfortably aware of the existence of democracy. He
is less happy with the characters that intrude upon the
ordered serenity of its preserves. Mrs. Noel, who so
nearly ruins the career of the eldest son, is never quite
realisable. She is so content to be described by the author
that she scarcely opens her lips lest she should disturb the
effect by saying the wrong thing. Charles Courtier too,
whose Radical tastes are tempered by birth and education
and a large experience of men and wild beasts, is a rather
shadowy figure, and we have to gauge his attractions by
inference drawn from the woman whose heart he might have
had for the asking. Worse still, we have only one person's
evidence of the low-
to discover by occult means whether there is a future
life or not. But the result of these secret séances was
not at all what the rector expected. The curate had only
been persuaded by the rector's assurances that the sole
this is what really happened. Gradually the curate
instead of becoming an admiring cherub, was changed into
freak. Surely it is time that Professors in fiction ceased to
dress as if their supplementary duty in life weretoscare crows.
In contrasting the comforts of the American and British
artisan I don't think any of our statisticians have laid
stress on that fecundity of Homeric metaphor which must
be a far more valuable possession to the former than mere
trifles like food and clothes.
ableness of the pro-
tagonist. Absorbed
in himself and in
the struggle that di-
vides his heart be-
tween a secret pas-
sion and the claims
of his career, he
hardly says a gentle
word from first to
last. But the hu-
man charm of his
sister, that lovely
Dian, Lady Babs,
makes irresistible
amends for all.
As in his Frater-
nity, if the author

MORE MANNERS FROM OREGON.
SoME weeks ago I ventured, for the benefit of the curious,
to set out the views of Miss PRUDENCE STANDISH (of Port-
land, Oregon) on the important subject of table manners.
These views, it may be remembered, had been contributed
in the form of an article to the columns of The Oregonian,
of Portland. Did I describe them as being bland, passionate,
and deeply religious? I cannot remember; but if I did not
I now repair the omission. They are all that and a good
deal more. - -
I had imagined that this high-toned discussion of spoons.
forks, soups, vegetables and napkins was, if I may say so, a
solitary burst on the part of PRUDENCE; that she had brooded
long over the dreadful spectacle of napkins tucked into
collars or waistcoats as soup-guards and sauce-diverters
and had then, once and for all, rushed into print to correct,
to stimulaté, to exhort and to convert. I was mistaken.
A friendly correspondent, dating from Portland, now informs
me—I use his own somewhat disrespectful words—that
“one of the leading features in the Sunday papers of Port-
land is a weekly effusion by PRUDENCE STANDISH; ” and to
prove what he says he encloses a cutting from The Sunday
Oregonian of March 5th, of which more than a column is
taken up with “Etiquette for the Engaged Person,” by
PRUDENCE STANDISH. * ---
I feel that I must enter a preliminary objection. How can
there be any etiquette for engaged persons? Before their
engagement they may have been strict observers of every
article of the social code. ... When their engagement is past
they will, no doubt, revert to an attitude of well-disciplined
submission. But during the engagement surely all the
petty restrictions are thrown aside. PRUDENCE may have
a larger experience than any I can pretend to ; but I must
state my opinion that etiquette and engagement are mutu-
ally destructive terms, and no one has a right to bring
them, as PRUDENCE has done, into the same title.
No doubt there are certain great principles which may
be gathered from the action of all engaged persons. For
instance, they believe that the whole of the world outside
themselves is leagued together to spy upon them and
obstruct them, whereas, as a matter of cold fact, the
outside world considers them a nuisance and wants to see
as little as may be of them. Then again, having developed
a strange liking for such remote and inaccessible places as
drawing-rooms or summer-houses or country lanes, they
are furious with housemaids or butlers or gardeners or
postmen, upon whose observation they may have thrust
themselves. And finally they imagine that the assumption
of an air of foolish detachment will prevent everybody
from drawing inferences from wildly ruffled hair and a
necktie which has got itself tucked away under one ear.
I3ut this is not etiquette. Far from it.
Neither is this what PRUDENCE means. She has received
(at any rate she declares in print that she has received) the
following letter from a Southern girl:—“I have just be-
come engaged to a young man I have known three years
and will be married "-evidently a most determined young
woman—“next October. It is the only love of my life,
and I reckon I am pretty foolish sometimes and rude with
friends and all that. How ought engaged people to behave
generally 2 I am very ignorant and just eighteen.”
Upon this, PRUDENCE observes that “the very fact that
an engaged girl is so young as this—eighteen—should
make her more careful to observe the niceties of conduct,”

and so she launches out upon her column of advice, in the
l
course of which she explains in detail how a Southern girl
ought to behave to her acquaintances, her friends and,
above all, to her “fiance”—this dreadful word is through-
out printed without an accent, as if it rhymed to dance or
chance or finance, and possessed only two syllables, instead
of the three that convention and the French have assigned
to it.
My own advice to the Southern girl would be very
shortly expressed. I should say, “Don't bother too much
about your behaviour. If you're a nice girl—and I'm sure
you are—you'll behave all right. Your friends won't be
offended with you. They know you're slightly mad. They've
all been slightly mad themselves, or they hope to be so in
the future.” But PRUDENCE would call that disgraceful
flippancy. She says, “It is the greatest unwisdom to neglect
friends if one wishes to keep them, for friendship is entirely
a thing for consideration, kindness, and the most delicate
courtesies. As an exquisite old lady of my acquaintance
said on one occasion, “Friendships are hard to make and
very easy to lose.’” Upon my word, one need not be either
exquisite or old to commit such a platitude as that—and,
like most platitudes, it isn't even true.
“The girl must see all the girls, once so much to her, in
the usual way, and not be merely content to sit and moon
| alone with her fiance. She must give him his own chance
to see his masculine chums whenever the mood comes upon
him for their society, and must not monopolize his move-
ments until he feels for the briefest moment like kicking

DEAREST DAPHNE.—The new cure
for everything is to dig 1–et, par con-
séquent, we're all digging. We not
only call a spade a spade; we catch
hold of it and use it as such. Dear
Sir William Kiddem, who's better than
all the rest of Harley Street put to-
gether, says it's the cure for indy, and
nerves, and brain-fag, and all those
horrors that come of the strenuous life,
and that it calls into play whole heaps
of muscles that have been most shame-
fully neglected, and sets free a lot of
nerve-centres and fearful things of that
kind. He makes us dig in real earnest,
putting a foot on the spade, and turning
up the earth in style. There's nothing
like it, my dear, for preserving the
figure and compleck, and those
who have neither dig in the hope cf
unearthing them. “Olga " is showing
some simply sweet digging-suits, the
coat fastening with little silver picks
and spades, the skirt short and plain,
high boots, gauntlet gloves, and a sort
of coal-heaver's hat in dark-grey silk
or satin, the little silver picks and
spades being repeated again in the
hat-pins. Any afternoon you may see
the old dowagers in Berkgrave Square,
in full diggers' rig-out, going over to
the square garden (with footmen carry-
ing their spades and gauntlets), and
setting to work, with the idea of digging
up their far-away youth! Some of them
shriek whenever they turn up a worm,
—but they go on digging. Lord Berk-
grave, who owns all that part, says
they're spoiling his property, and that
j go to law with them,--but they
go on digging.
I hear that the Bullyon-Boundermere
people had a week-end party down at
Bullyon Towers at Easter, and one
night after dinner everybody suddenly
remembered that they hadn't done any
digging that day, and they sent; for
spades, and all rushed off into the
winter gardens, and the conservatories
and the orangeries, and dug everything
up, and left the place quite ruinous, and
those poor wretches, the B-B.s were
trying to pretend they were enjoying it
all ! - •
Fluffy Thistledown is very much
down on her luck just now. I drove
round there one afternoon with darling
Pompom, who left one of his teeny-
weeny cards on Fluffy's Pekingese “to
enquire,” the poor little thingy-thing
having been operated on for appendy.
Fluffy sent out to ask me to come in,
and I found her in the dolefullest of
dismals, howling among the comfies
and cosies of a couchin her chattingden.
“What's the matter?” I asked.
“Is little Peky-peky worse?” . .
“Bother little Peky-peky 1’’, she
sobbed (only she used a shorter word
than bother). “I’m the wretchedest
woman on earth !”
“Don't speak of yourself as if you
were an East-end drama at popular
prices, my dear,” I said. “What's
the matter 2"
“Blanchel Dulcie and Westshire

with “Thanks awfly Isn't it per-

People are wondering about the sud-
den reconciliation of Billy St. Adrian
and his father, who've been at daggers
drawn for ages. Would you like to
know the true inwardness of the matter,
my dear? Well, so you shall.
Sir Richard St. Adrian, though
(according to the newspapers of his own
way of thinking) “a statesman of
colossal ideals and magnificent grip,”
has never been able to do anything
with Billy, who's always been what
people used to call “a trouble at
home" (now - a - days they call it
“having a temperament.”) Ever
and ever so many times he's touched
old Sir Richard for big sums of
money and tried different things
that have always turned out failures.
Then he has come back for more.
(Norty says that at Eton the three
St. Adrian boys were called after
the three divisions of Arabia:—Dick
was Happy St. Adrian, because he was
the heir; Jack, who's very fair, was
Sandy St. Adrian; and Billy was
Stoney St. Adrian, and has been so ever
since). Last time he came for money,
the old man went into a rage, said it
was the limit, and that he washed
his hands of him. For quite a long
time after this Billy made himself
scarce, and people wondered what had
become of him and what his latest
venture was. My dear, it was this :
disguising himself, and taking the pro-
fessional name “Dr. Hymen,” he
started a Marriage Bureau in Bond
Street, on rather new lines, and for
a time made it a succès fou ! The
fee for consulting “Dr. Hymen."
was ten guineas, and he had a little
salom in connection with the bureau,
where he gave weekly teas, at which
would-be bridegrooms could meet
would-be brides. Heaps and heaps
of people, without the least suspicion
as to who “Dr. Hymen" really was,
went there just for fun and with no
matrimonial intentions. But at last
poor Billy's luck began to peter out
as usual, and just as he was won-
dering how he was to pay his rent,
“Dr. Hymen" got a private and con-
fidential letter from “an elderly gentle-
man, some years a widower, and
anxious to meet a lady, young, loving
and handsome, with a view to matri-
mony,” making an appointment for a
consultation. At the discreet hour of
dusk the new client arrived on foot,
and “Dr. Hymen,” all ready, with his
silvery locks and beard, and his long
flowing robes, presently found himself,

Sir Richard really was looking for a
second wife, or merely for une plaisante
aventure, will remain as great a mystery
as the Letters of the Man in the Iron
Mask. Billy didn't give the show
away at once; he played his fish
for a time ; and then he said,
“You’re looking for someone young,
loving, and handsome. Well, Sir,
you're now in the company of
someone who is young and loving—
as to handsome, that's a matter of
opinion. This is Billy,” he added,
shedding his disguise, “your loving
youngest son, into whose hands you've
delivered yourself up, and whose price
for not handing you over to the tender
mercies of your admiring public, your
dearest friends and enemies, and the
halfpenny press, is that you overlook
the past and finance him once more l’’
And that, my dear, you may believe
me, is the real secret of Sir Richard's
reconciliation with his youngest son,
of their immensely amicable relations,
and of Billy's flourishing circs just now.
Norty has a suggestion that he means
to lay before Parliament as soon as ever
he can get a chance. He's going to
propose that snappy, impressionist,
short stories shall be bound in with the
parliamentary blue books and white
books. Numbers of Members have said
they'll support the measure, and would
be only too glad to have bright, amusing

THE PORTUGUESE CIGAR.
EveRYTHING promised well for my
week-end with Charles. The weather
was warm and sunny, I was bringing
my golf clubs down with me, and I
had just discovered (and meant to put
into practice) an entirely new stance
which made it impossible to miss the
object ball. It was this that I was
explaining to Charles and his wife at
dinner on Friday, when the interruption
occurred.
“By the way,” said Charles, as I took
out a cigarette, “I’ve got a cigar for
you. Don't smoke that thing.”
“You haven't let him go in for
cigars?” I said reproachfully to Mrs.
Charles. I can be very firm about
other people's extravagances.
“This is one I picked up in Portu-
gal,” explained Charles. “You can get
them absurdly cheap out there. Let's
see, dear; where did I put it?”
“I saw it on your dressing-table last
week,” said his wife, getting up to leave
us. He followed her out and went in
search of it, while I waited with an
interest which I made no effolt to
conceal. I had never heard before of a
man going all the way to Portugal to
buy one cigar for a friend.
“Here it is,” said Charles, coming in
again. He put down in front of me an
ash-tray, the matches and a — and
a— well, as I say, a cigar. I
examined it slowly. Half of it looked
very tired.
“Well, said Charles, “what do you
think of it 2 ” -
“When you say you—er—picked it
up in Portugal,” I began carefully, “I
suppose you don't mean—” I
stopped and tried to bite the end off.
“Have a knife,” said Charles.
I had another bite, and then I
decided to be frank.
“Why did you pick it up?” I asked.
“The fact was,” said Charles, “I
found myself one day in Lisbon without
my pipe, and so I bought that thing; I
never smoke them in the ordinary way.”
“Did you smoke this?” I asked.
It was obvious that something had
happened to it.
“No, you see, I found some cigarettes
at the last moment, and so, knowing
that you liked cigars, I thought I'd
bring it home for you.”
“It's very nice of you, Charles.
Of course I can see that it has
travelled. Well, we must do what we
can with it.”
I took the knife and started chipping
away at the mahogany end. The other
end—the brown-paper end, which had
come ungummed—I intended to reserve
for the match. When everything was
ready I applied a light, leant back in
my chair, and pulled.
“That's all right, isn't it?” said
Charles. “And you'd be surprised if
I told you what I paid for it.”
“No, no, you mustn't think that,”
I protested. “Probably things are
dearer in Portugal.” I put it down by
my plate for a moment's rest. “All
I've got against it at present is that
its pores don't act as freely as they
should.”
if “I've got a cigar-cutter somewhere,
l - >
“No, don't bother, I think I can
do it with the nut-crackers. There's
no doubt it was a good cigar once, but
it hasn't wintered well.”
I squeezed it as hard as I could, lit
it again, pressed my feet against the
table and pulled.
“Now it's going,” said Charles.
“I'm afraid it keeps very reticent
at my end. The follow-through is
poor. Is your end alight still?”
“Burning beautifully.”
“It's a pity that I should be missing
all that. How would it be if we were
to make a knitting-needle red-hot, and
bore a tunnel from this end ? We
might establish a draught that way.
Only there's always the danger, of
course, of coming out at the side.”
I took the cigar up and put it to
my ear.
“I can't hear anything wrong,” I
said. “I expect what it really wants
is massage.”
Charles filled his pipe again and got
up. “Let's go for a stroll,” he said.
“It's a beautiful night. Bring your
cigar with you.”
“It may prefer the open air,” I said.
“There's always that. You know we
mustn't lose sight of the fact that
the Portuguese climate is different from
ours. The thing's pores may have
acted more readily in the South. On
the other hand the unfastened end may
have been more adhesive. I gather
that though you have never actually
met anybody who has smoked a cigar
like this yet you understand that the
experiment is a practicable one. As
far as you know this had no brothers.
No, no, Charles, I'm going on with it,
but I should like to know all that you
can tell me of its parentage. It had a
Portuguese father and an American
mother, I should say, and there has been
a good deal of trouble in the family.
One moment"—and as we went out-
side I stopped and cracked it in the
door.
It was an inspiration. At the very
next application of the match I found
that 1 had established a connection
with the lighted end. Not a long and
steady connection, but one that came
in gusts. After two gusts I decided
that it was perhaps safer to blow from
my end, and for a little while we had
in this way as much smoke around us as
the most fastidious cigar-smoker could
want. Then I accidentally dropped it;
something in the middle of it shifted, I
suppose—and for the rest of my stay
behind it only one end was at work.
“Well,” said Charles, when we were
back in the smoking-room, and I
was giving the cigar a short breather,
“it’s not a bad one, is it?”
“I have enjoyed it,” I said truth-
fully, for I like trying to get the mastery
over a thing that defies me.
“You’ll never guess what it cost,”
he chuckled.
“Tell me,” I said. “I daren't guess.”
“Well, in English money it works
out at exactly three farthings.”
I looked at him for a long time and
then shook my head sadly.
“Charles, old friend,” I said, “you've
been done.” A. A. M.

WHAT BECAME OF LADY
TEAZLE 2
[A correspondence which obviously ought to
have gone to The Westminster Gazette.]
SIR,-It has often struck me as a
great pity that our dramatists do not
take the public (by whose kindly
support they live) a little more into
their confidence. They interest us (or
not, as the case may be) in their
puppets; the curtain falls, and we
know no more. A little leaflet containing
the subsequent history of those who are
left alive, given away at the doors as
the audience pass out, would do all
that is necessary. To circulate it
earlier would of course be a mistake, as
it might rob the play of some of the
elements of surprise. There is no
doubt that we are entitled to a full
account of the career of Nora after
she has slammed the door at the end of
The Doll's House, because her life was
really only then beginning. We also
want more information about Lady
Teazle. Any of your readers who can
tell me more about Lady Teazle will
earn my deep gratitude.
Yours, etc., John STODGE MEARs.
SIR,-Your correspondent, Mr. Mears,
asks what became of Lady Teazle.
There is, I think, very little doubt that
she and Sir Peter “quarrelled again.”
I have known that kind of woman in
real life, and she always quarrels again.
Sir Peter probably died in the course
of a few years, and his widow married
Joseph Surface. A little later she
divorced him and settled down as a
paragon of virtue at Bath, where she
died at an advanced age. I enclose
my card, and I am
Yours, etc., ANGUs STERLING.
SIR,-It pains me to read the cynical
letter on the after-life of poor Lady
Teazle which Mr. Sterling sends you.
According to my reading of her
character, Lady Teazle was not like
that. She was a true woman. She
had been a little flighty, no doubt, but
only from the point of view of man.
How is one to know oneself unless one
is foolish as well as wise? Are women
to have no off-moments? Are they to
be eternally at their husbands' sides
and obeying their husbands' orders?
The whole idea is obnoxious. Lady
Teazle, directly Sir Peter was dead—
as he soon would be, for he ages at an
incredible speed in all the representa-
tions of the play that I have seen—
began to live her own life. Always a
believer in the suffrage for women she
devoted herself and Sir Peter's money
to the cause, dressed entirely in green,
purple and white, and spoke at public
meetings. She also refused to fill up
her Census paper. That is how I read
dear Lady Teazle.
Yours, etc., MAY WINKLE.
SIR,-In my opinion Lady Teazle
was a woman, a truly human one,
and an identity. After her last and
final row with Sir Peter, which
quickly came, she went away to try
and learn about that identity, which
was herself. Where she went, what she
did, we don't know. But a woman who
would face the world alone and unaided
as she did, without accepting any of Sir
Peter's money, would not be likely to
fail. Quite possibly she took up type-
writing. On Sir Peter's death she mar-
ried again, became a lecturer on small
holdings, and settled at the Garden City.
Who is right, your correspondent or I,
about the character and fate of Lady
Teazle 2
Yours truly, JULIA TUPMAN.
SIR,--The end of Lady Teazle was
recently revealed to me by a crystal-
gazer. Determined at all hazards to
assert her ego, she took lessons from
a French aeronaut, obtained a pilot's
certificate, and was the first woman to
cross the Channel in a balloon. She
subsequently converted Sir Peter to
Christian Science, adopted a rational
dress, and died a vegetarian.
Yours faithfully,
LEVEsoN TILES, M.A.
SIR,--You ask what became of Lady
Teazle. I will tell you. At the fall
of the curtain she went to her dressing-
room, changed and washed, and had
supper at the Savoy. The next day
she was at the theatre again as usual.
Yours etc., OLD THESPIAN.

moustaches and smiled a little grimly at the

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR AMBULANCE CLASS.
Fair First Aider. “I say, what's The Poison For which you give AN Epidemic t”
FARMING NOTES.
(By our Agricultural Expert.)
ON WHEAT.
WHEAT is the only thing besides
bulbs that you may talk about in
the country at this time of year.
There is an old saying that it should
be high enough to “hide a hare in
March.” This is very true, but the
farmer scores either way. In one
case he gets the wheat, in the other
he gets the hare. -
ON Sowing.
Seed, as the little Irish girl said,
should be sown three days before
steady rain. Be very careful to arrange
for this.
ON AGRICULTURAL DEPREssion.
This is what the farmers get when
it rains, or it doesn't rain, or there's
a little extra work to do. It is their
custom to congregate on Saturday
night in the village inn to try to
forget it. They then become post-
depressionists.
ON MANGOLD-WUnzels.
Most farmers stock them in three
sizes at least. The big ones for the
cows, the littler ones for the sheep,
and the littlest ones for the children
to play with.
ON RATs.
An evening paper recently asserted
that the numbers of these could be
greatly reduced “if farmers would put
wire nettirg round their haystacks
when they threshed them.” Don't
scorn these agricultural experts. Try
it yourself when you are threshing the
turnip-tops.
ON BoARD OF AGRICULTURE
INSPECTors.
They are good fellows, really. They
get on best by posing as scientists
to the farmer, and as farmers to the
scientist. -
ON PotATOES.
These are of two kinds—bad and
good. The very bad ones are called
“chats" because they really do talk
a lot.
The good ones are eaten by the
farmers, and the bad ones by the farm
animals, except in Ireland, where the
pigs have the good ones. It is thought
by some authorities that the historic
reply of the cottager—“Father's in the
pig-sty; you'll know him by his
hat"—has, in the course of centuries,
been evolved, by careless repetition,
from a remark which originally ran
as follows: “Father's in the pig-sty;

There seems some doubt as to the

that it may be derived from a similar

A practical farmer once told me of
a young man from Cambridge who
called it, CaFI (CO)2, but he very
wisely asked him to move on to the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, April
18.-Whilst Lords still make holiday
in anticipation of hard work ahead,
Commons resume sitting after so-
called Easter Recess. As one looked
round scantily filled Benches when
SPEAKER took the Chair, nothing in
appearance suggested that we are
actually in midst of revolution. Com-
pared with methods in Mexico, for
example, peaceful condition is really
monotonous. Point of resemblance
between two hemispheres comes in in
respect of occasional shooting over the
boundary and hitting the wrong man
—generally in the back. BANBURY,
however, was the right man. Up again
with mitrailleuse discharge of ques-
tions about procrastinated payment of
income-tax by railways, was himself
bowled over by shot from the Chair.
House notes with marked satisfac-
tion that the SPEAKER's forbearance
with the plague of Supplementary
Questions, marvellous in its tenacity,
has at length broken down. Before
adjournment for Recess he addressed
stern reproof to one of the most per-
sistent practitioners of this clumsy art.
To-day BANBURY, nipping in with intent
to extend shorter catechism which had
already occupied some minutes of
limited time, was brought up with
what on board ship is called a round
turn. Shifting his position under the
coil of rope, he proposed to catechise
the SPEAKER himself, asking whether
he had not said so-and-so on earlier
occasion ?
“What I have said I have said,”
remarked the SPEAKER in warning
voice.
BANBURY resumed his seat, wondering
where he had heard that remark before.
Later came along WINTERTON
with delightful affectation of judicial
manner that adds charm to what
Labour Members, jealous custodians
of good manners, call his impertin-
ences. Firing shot designed to bring
down PRIME MINISTER on subject of
proposal to pay Members, he hit group
below Gangway.
“The object of the Labour Members,”
he said, in soothing voice and with
bland manner suggestive that he
was inviting them to high tea on the
Terrace, “in coming to this House is
to see that as much money as possible
shall be taken from the pockets of the
taxpayers and put into the pockets
of themselves and their friends.”
CHAIRMAN, amid strident cheers
from Labour Party, declared the charge
not a proper one to make.
“Charge 2" cried WINTERTON, rais-
ing eyebrows in unaffected surprise.
“What charge?”
Thought he was making a plain state-
ment ; if it was out of order he unre-
servedly withdrew it. But it was left
to rankle, and Labour Members growled
resentment in fashion suggestive of
lively times for noble Earl if at any
time they catch him up their street.
Business done.—Having spent two
hours in discussing whether under
pressure of business Government Bills
shall have precedence on Wednesdays
after Whitsuntide, House got into
Committee on Parliament Bill. Kan-
garoo Resolution still in operation.
CHAIRMAN skipped over batches of
amendments with graceful agility not

camps.”

to be rivalled by his brethren in far-off
Australia. Sat till after 4 A.M. and
passed Clause I.
Wednesday night.—Been reading in
Recess ARTHUR ELLIoT's Life of
Goschen; recalls memories going back
for nearly forty years. When I first
knew Goschen he sat on Treasury
Bench, First Lord of Admiralty, fervent
admirer of the Chief who, recognising
his great ability, first gave him
Ministerial office. He lived long
enough to take leading part in the
revolt which in 1886 shattered the
Liberal Party and broke the spell of
GLADSTONE's long predominance.
Striking but appropriate coincidence
that GoschEN and his biographer twice
at successive crises sacrificed position
for conscience' sake. Both broke away
from Liberal Party on Home Rule
question. Having crossed floor of
IIouse both again went into Opposition
on question of Free Trade.
Nothing permanently barred Go-
scHEN's progress. Having broken with
MR. G. on Home Rule, he, “forgotten"
by GRANDOLPH, was received with open
arms by Conservative Cabinet. When
DoN José ran up Protectionist flag
from Unionist citadel, GoschEN, retired
from fighting line, his helmet now a
hive for bees, took field again, and
proved himself as redoubtable a com-
batant of DoN José's fiscal heresy as
he had been in the case of MR. G.'s
political mistake. ARTHUR ELLIOT,
equally impregnable in his honesty,
marching step by step with Goschen
in these excursions, by the first suffered
long exile from Parliament; by second
loss of Ministerial office and what has
to present date been exclusion from
Parliamentary life. Both examples are
shining lights in occasionally mirk
atmosphere of English politics.
Next to HARTINGTON, whom he much
resembled, and with whom through
his public life he always sympathized,
GoschEN was a statesman who in
unobtrusive manner most largely in-
fluenced English politics in the period
between 1885 and 1905. In one of
the phrases of which he is master,
John MoRLEY, writing of him on his
quitting the live arena of the Commons
for the sepulchre of the Lords, de-
scribes him as “a man who has done
so much to keep a lofty standard both
of the integrity and the dignity of
public life.”
Eleven years have, sped since
Goschen for the last time passed
out behind the SPEAKER's Chair. His
memory is still cherished in both
camps as that of a fighting-man who
never hit below the belt.
Business done.—Army Annual Bill
in Committee.
Thursday.—For fully six years there
have been heard in caves of Liberal
Party murmurs of discontent with LoRD
CHANCELLOR's dealing with appoint-
ments to magisterial bench. Began
whilst C.-B. was still with us. In
earlier months of his Premiership John
BRUNNER led into his room behind
SPEAKER's chair a band of angry
Ministerialists demanding LoREBURN's
head on a charger.
Situation certainly curious. There
was a sweet simplicity about HALS-
BURY's method that made it at least
comprehensible. Honestly believing
that no good could come out of the
Nazareth of Liberalism he systemati-
cally packed the magisterial bench with
good Conservatives. From time to
time the matter was brought before
notice of Commons. Stout HALSBURY,

Early next morning I
found myself sitting in the

stream of water trickled
and still Aspodestera and I
were engaged. We had every reason
to be proud and grateful, I to be
proud and she to be grateful. For the
moment, however, we were in complete
accord and were discussing the situation
lightly in the abstract.
“If only I had made a note of the
actual words I used at the fatal mo-
ment,” I said, “I should be in a much
better position now to argue. What I
meant to say was, ‘Will you marry
me?' It certainly was not, “May I
marry you?’ ‘To marry,' I may add,
means ‘to love, honour and obey,' and
I am almost sure you said that you
would.”
Aspodestera busied herself with her
i hair and the mirror over the mantel-
clothes that are wrong, or only myself
this time?”
I knew there was something coming
when she thereupon took steps to com-
fort and exhilarate me and allowed her
conversation to be, for a time, irrele-
vant but sweetly docile. Let me warn
you against the irrelevance and sweet
docility of Aspodestera and her kind.
When the worst came, it came in a
playful whisper from a head leaning,
pleasantly enough, on my shoulder.
“What is the French for ‘to-send-to-
the-dentist-for-inspection-and-repair'?”
I abandoned her at once (she was
not entirely unprepared) and assumed
a commanding and defiant attitude
before the fireplace. “No,” I declared,
unceasingly into a blue
bowl on my left and a little benzine
lamp burned merrily near by. Mean-
while I had reason to believe that
there was a man in my mouth looking
for trouble with a pickaxe.
“Not every man,” he said, supposing
that this was flattery to me—“not
every man would have had the sense
to come to me in the very nick of

MR. Punch's suppleMENT.
(With acknowledgments to The Times.)
II.-BILLIARDS.
IN view of the heightened interest in
billiards that is now being displayed it
is felt that a brief history and survey
of the game would be grateful and
'illuminating.
H a HISTORICAL.
| . The origin of billiards is wrapt in
mystery. SAYCE claims to have found
traces of the game in a rudimentary
form in mural hieroglyphics at Luxor,
and it cannot be denied that the name
given to the most popular of the
winning hazard variants—Pyramids—
lends colour to his theory. SHAK-
SPEARE, too, in Antony and Cleopatra
has the phrase, “Let’s to billiards.”
At the beginning of the last century,
however, the savant RoBERT ALLEN
was positive-that the game was first
played in Lombardy; hence the
Lombardy crest of three balls. The
circumstance that these balls are
all of brass, and not two white and
one red, may be dismissed as an
accident. Professor ALLEN held that
the game was invented as a recreation
for the great financiers of Lombardy
after the fatigues of money-lending
during the day. -
Other investigators have other
theories. Thus Sir RoberT BALL
assigns an Arabic origin to the game
and sees in it an effort to symbolize
the solar system, the red ball being
obviously meant to indicate Mars, the
pinkest of the planets.
As to the derivation of the word,
Professor Topirambour, of the Ecole
des Langues Orientales at Paris, notes
that the name is identical with milliards,
when the latter is pronounced by a
person with a cold in the head, for
which billiards are an excellent tonic.
BILLIARD BALLS.
In the earliest days of the game in
England, the balls were made of stone,
on which very little work could be got.
The cues were of iron, or, in the houses
of the nobility, of steel. Ivory balls
came in in the eighteenth century, cut
from the tusks of elephants. The dis-
covery of this use to which to put
| those appendages is due to the Dutch
explorer, Van Winkle in 1783, who,
confined to the jungle for some months
and longing for 100 up, constructed, it
is said, a whole billiard table and
appliances from one elephant, flattening
the back for the bed, retaining the
| legs in situ, turning the balls from the
tusks, and after petrifying both using
the tail as a cue and the trunk as a rest.
With this alleviation he is said to have
been so content that he refused to leave

his solitude when a relief party at last
found him.
THE BONzo.
Ivory balls held the field until the
opportune discovery of the bonzo in
the forest of Swami by the late Sir
H. M. STANLEY. The explorer came
suddenly upon a huge herd of them in
a clearing. The creature is practically
all tusk, the merest thread of body with
several hundred-weights of the hard
glistening material attached to it. No
sooner did the bonzos see STANLEY than
they made a huge break for cover—a
happy augury. The herd, however,
moved but slowly owing to their wealth
of bonzoline (as it is now called), and
it was an easy matter to round them
up and secure them. Bonzo ranches
now cover the Swami district and large
fortunes are being made. Not only are
the bonzo's tusks (which, we ought to
explain, it drags behind, having insuf-
ficient strength to carry them) useful
for billiard balls, but excellent false

teeth, almost like real, are made from
them too, and the best professionals
wear no others. Dx-President Roose-
veLT also keeps a set by him, in case
of accident.
BILLIARDS IN FRANCE.
In France, where orthography runs
riot, they have the word “billard,”
signifying merely the table on which
the game is played. Hence a hotel or
café proprietor will announce that he
keeps two, three or whatever number it
may be—“billards”: which is absurd.
The French table has no longer any
pockets, a deprivation due, according
to the same Professor ALLEN, to the
| circumstance that when there were
pockets the Lombards could not keep
their hands out of them. They were
therefore removed under the Code
Napoléon.
BILLIARDS IN South AMERICA.
The game in Terra del Fuego is
perhaps not worth consideration here,
since they do not play it at all.
SHAKSPEARE As A CUE-1st.
That our national poet knew the
game is beyond question. Again and
again in his Works we find references to
his passion: direct, as in the instance
given above, and indirect and more
poetical, as when he says (Love's
Labour's Lost), “My love is most
immaculate white and red"; and again,
in The Taming of the Shrew, “Such
war of white and red”; in Henry IV.,
Pt. I., “This cushion my crown "; in
Midsummer Night's Dream, “When my
cue comes call me and I will answer,”
and in Lear (after the balls had been
running badly for him), “My cue is
villainous melancholy.”
SNookER's Pool.
Snooker's Pool was invented by
Alfred Snooker, marker at the “Green
Posts" in Leicester Square, in 1843.
The exact date is not known. Snooker
lived to be quite an old man, dying in
1901 in a lodging in Camden Town.
He took an interest in the game to the
end, but seems to have wandered a
little in his mind at the close of his
life, for his last words were: “Two for
his nob.” Longevity was once prac-
tically assurel to all good billiard
players, but it is not thought that any
of the many professionals of the present
moment will ever be GRAY.
THE HALF-BUTT.
This interesting weapon, originally
invented by the Duke of Malmsey, is
now, by a delicate compliment to one
of our leading vocalists, habitually
described as “the semi-Clara.”

INDAND REVENUE OFFICIAL.
OLD STYLE.
SIR,-Only a week now remains be:
fore the closing of the financial year, and
I must press the immediate payment
of your Income Tax, otherwise the
amount will be lost to the Sinking Fund,
and considerable inconvenience will
thereby be caused to the Inland
Revenue Department.
Yours faithfully, W. S.Nooks,
J. Brown, Esq. Surveyor of Taxes.
SIR,--I note that my demand of the
24th ult, has been ignored by you: your
Income Tax has therefore been irretriev-
ably los', to the Sinking Fund. I have
now to inform you that unless it is paid
within four days, I shall have the
painful duty of putting in a distress
upon your goods. ... *
Yours faithfully, W. S.Nooks,
J. Brown, Esq. . Surveyor of Taxes.
SIR,-Here, confound you, is your
tax. I am glad to think the robbers
of the Inland Revenue Department
will have been put to considerable
inconvenience by the loss of this sum
to the Sinking Fund. I wish (for this
reason only) that the amount had been
larger.
Yours faithfully, J. B.RowN.
NEw STYLE.
March 24th.
DEAR MR. BrowN,-May I ask you
as a personal favour kindly to postpone
the payment of your Income Tax for
one month. I know and appreciate
your accustomed regularity, but at
present the Government has really
more money than it knows what to do
with. I am sure that you do not wish
your hard-earned savings to be
squandered on the mere repayment of
debt. To force up the price of Consols
is to inflict a grievous wrong on the
saving classes of the community who
wish to invest in them. I think I may
promise you that next year your money
will be devoted to much more romantic
objects—the payment of your excellent
Parliamentary representative and the
creation of a large number of lucrative
civil service posts. Trusting that you
will see your way to comply with my
request,
Believe me, with kindest regards,
Yours faithfully, W. S.Nooks,
Surveyor of Taxes.
DEAR MR. S.Nooks,—I have the
greatest pleasure in complying with
your very amiable request. I quite
appreciate your point about the glut of
money in the Exchequer, and if it will
be any help to you will postpone all
payments till this time next year.
Yours faithfully, J. B.RowN.
SIR,--In direct violation of instruc-
tions from the Department, you have
obstinately and deliberately persisted
in paying your Income Tax. . It is
obvious from your wish to rush the
payment through and avoid enquiry
that you have been assessed at far too
low a rate. " I enclose form relating to
Super-tax, which please fill up and
return instantly. In default thereof
you will be assessed for Super-tax by
the Commissioners. -
Yours truly, W. S.Nooks,
J. Brown, Esq. Surveyor of Taxes.
DEAR MR. S.Nooks,—My ass of a
cashier filled up cheque, for Income
Tax, and forwarded same without con-
sulting me. I have discharged cashier
and stopped cheque. Please accept
my apologies.
Yours faithfully, J. Brows.
MY DEAR MR. BrowN,-Please ac-
cept my apologies for the tone of my
last note. I ought to have guessed
that there was some mistake. I much
appreciate the courteous and patriotic
manner in which you stopped payment
of the cheque. May I venture to inter-
cede for your cashier. His conduct to
my mind is more significant of slight
mental weakness than direct moral
obliquity. Pray do not trouble about
that little matter of Super-tax. I wrote
under the mistaken impression that
you had grievously wronged the depart-
ment. With kindest regards,
Yours cordially, W. S.Nooks.
MY DEAR Mr. BRowN,-I cannot
leave my post (on promotion to an
Inspectorship at our head office) with-
out thanking you for the very kindly
way in which you helped me depart-
mentally. During the last week of the
financial year my district achieved the
unique record of paying nothing into
the Exchequer. Without the help-so
freely and generously given—of your-
self and others such a result could
never have been achieved. My one
regret in leaving this district is that
it involves separation from so many
friendly non-tax payers. Believe me,
Yours very cordially, W. S.Nooks.

effort was a gigantic ducal coronet,
which has since been baked and pre-
sented to the Gladstone League, who
propose to exhibit it at their head

country as an object lesson in the
futility of the feudal system.
Mr. HERBERT SAMUEL invited several
of the officials of St. Martin's-le-Grand

delicate consideration which cannot be
too highly commended, Mr. SAMUEL
insisted on playing General Post with
his guests every day from 10 to 1 and
from 2 to 5.
Mr. SYDNEY Buxton gave a charming

THE clou of Sir HERBERT TREE's so
brilliant revival was his extremely
clever troupe of tame rabbits. For a
first night's performance they played
with an extraordinary absence of nerves
and self-consciousness. Not even the
spectacle of Mr. Bourchien's legs,
foreshortened in repose, disturbed their
complacency. From the moment of
their appearance in the forest scene, our
gaze was diverted from the charm of
Oberon and the gamineries of Puck; the
rabbits became, if I may say it, the
coneysure of every eye. When Bottom,
dazed with slumber and the vague
memory of strange dreams, called aloud
on Peter Quince, a piebald rabbit mis-
took himself for the Athenian prompter,
and advanced, amid loud signs of ap-
proval, in the weaver's direction, and
Mr. BourgHIER, in a spasm of jealousy,
beat a swift retreat under the guise of
a very natural terror.
To the sporting mind it seemed a pity
that the hounds of Theseus, “bred out
of the Spartan kind,” were not intro-
duced in person. But Sir HERBERT
has a tender heart, and, after all, the
rabbits were too confiding.
Another fresh effect was the flight
of doll-fairies across the background.
This pleased me less, for from my seat
I could not define the nature of these
fluffy objects and took them for cock-
atoos or birds of paradise, my difficulty
being increased by their tendency to fly
upside down. Nor did I find the mar-
vellous beauty of these sylvan scenes
enhanced by so much trapeze-work on
the part of the living children. For the
rest I cannot imagine how things could
have been bettered.
These dreamlike glimpses of faérie
and the buffooneries of the local his-
trions seem never to stale; and even
the tediousness of the lovers' affairs,
always unsympathetic, were made more
than tolerable by the charm of their

setting. Dull and artificial talk matters
less when the speakers are so good
to look on.
Of the fairies, Miss EVELYN D'ALRoy
bore herself with a very graceful dignity
as Oberon, but in comparison with what
one remembers of the virility of Miss
JULIA NEILSON, she was perhaps not
quite man enough for the part, and,
indeed, beside the scurrilities of Hermia
and the unmaidenlike advances of
Helena her Oberon seemed the most
womanly creation in the play. I shall
not soon forget the exquisite beauty of
the dying fall of her song as she moved
away through the dimness of the
forest—“I know a bank.” Miss MAR-
GERY MAUDE was a sweet and gracious
Titania, but even allowing for her
fairyhood she lacked a little the qual-
ity of queenliness. Master HAMPDEN's
Puck was a very perfect imp.
As for the mortals, if in her Hermia
one missed the piquancy of Miss LAURA
CowIE's Anne Bullen, she showed
an unexpected gift for feline ameni-
ties, and bandied Billingsgate with
the right fishwife's gusto. One almost
overlooked the thanklessness of Helena's
part for delight of Miss CREssaLL's
beauty and the clinging charm of
her Greek hobble-skirt. Miss FRANCEs
DILLON showed no false shame about
the exposure of one of her nether limbs,
but this did not deceive me into
the belief that she was really an
Amazon Queen.
To pass to the mechanics, Mr.
EDWARD SAss, as Starveling, made an
enduring impression with his yokel's
smile that refused to come off. I shall
hope to see it permanently secured on
a picture-postcard. But, of course,
Mr. BourchIER very properly overbore
the rest of the company of comic
tragedians. It was indeed a mid-
summer night out for him and he
made it his business to go one better
than all previous Pyrami. Bottom had
been “translated" often enough; but
this time he should be adapted with
new effects under his (Mr. BourcHIER's)
personal supervision. Having no
theatre just now under his own
control he felt the less embarrassment
in burlesquing those foibles of actor-
management of which he enjoys a
ripe experience. Naturally his weaver
was more robust and bucolic than Sir
HERBERT's, and still no subtlety
escaped his grip. For a moment I
thought that he had grown a fresh crop
of facial hair for the part of Pyramus
in the interval between the Second and
Third Acts. But the colour, a deep
sable, was against this view, and
when his moustachios slipped below
his under lip, and, later, were de-
pressed beneath his chin with the
idea of permitting a greater clarity
of speech, I saw that I had over-
rated his fertility. Later in the even-
ing he kindly offered me, in an en-
velope, the relics of his Tudor beard,
now permanently discarded; but I de-
clined the generous gift, feeling that
its proper place would be under glass
in the new museum of Metropolitan
treasures.
“It may seem an anachronism to say that a
60lb. wether is as profitable as a 65 lb. one, but
if an average is taken, it will be found that the
difference between cost of feeding, and the
difference in the price obtained, of the two is
greater in the first.”—ſhe Land (Sydney).
Whatever this means, it is too fresh
for an anachronism.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I CANNOT question the loyalty of motive of those to whose
labour of love we owe The Life of John Oliver Hobbes
(MURRAY), but I do question, without using other argument
than may be drawn from the internal evidence of her works
and of her letters, whether Mrs. CRAIGIE herself would have
desired the publication of her private correspondence. It
is not as if her life had been spent in ways that allowed her
no chance of self expression. She wrote for the public, and
the public was at liberty to judge her, if it could, by her
books. But she never invited it to make conjecture of her-
self from this source. She preserved, even in her most
analytical moments, a fastidious detachment of manner, a
nice distaste—temperamental as much as artistic—for the
exposure of her own personality.
Was ich weiss kann jemann wissen;
Mein Herz hab' ich allein.
At least she kept her heart for her intimate friends; and,
for them the fascination of reading her letters to other
intimate friends is tempered by a sense of intrusion, as if
one were overhearing private speech or listening to the
betrayal of a confidence. The publication, however, of her
purely literary letters is justifiable as adding something to
the world's knowledge of her as a writer. Many of them
contain criticisms of great and abiding value. But too
much attention, as usual, is given to correspondence with
her publisher and others about details of production, what
one may call the commercial side of the author's work, a
subject always best suppressed, and it is perhaps a pity that
so many needless examples should have been given of her
extreme sensitiveness to criticism and her insistence upon
the need of less prejudice and more intelligence in English
reviewers. Her appreciations of the work of other writers
and artists, as shown in her letters to them, are marked by
extraordinary generosity, and one can only marvel, in the
case of one or two who shall be nameless, that their modesty
permitted them to offer these flattering testimonials to the
public eye.
Mrs. CRAIGIE's father, Mr. John MoRGAN RICHARDs, has
done his work well, contributing a short but adequate
sketch of her life that is marked by great simplicity and
restraint. The friend who selected her letters has had a more
difficult and delicate task, and if the result is unsatisfactory
the fault is not his alone. Among other pleasant traits
Mrs. CRAIGIE's habit, rare among women, of nearly always

taking the man's point of view, brought many men within
the charmed circle of her intimate friends. Her letters
to them breathed an air of delightful candour whether she
touched on private matters or public affairs, and their
reproduction would in many cases have been a breach of
privilege. It follows that some of her closest friends are not
represented—openly, at least—by any letters in this col-
lection, and others but meagrely. The most self-revealing
correspondence is that addressed, within the last two
years of her life, to one who remains inconnu under the
initial X. To him she writes: “I have had great attach-
ments and great friendships, but something tragic within
me never made it possible for me to ‘avail myself of
the glamour.” And this was true of her art as well. She
knew the craftsman's delight in do ng good work, but she
Miss SILBERRAD's briskly-written chapters. One feature,
however, there is that redeems this story from being
altogether a thing of formula; its picture of Quaker life
in the seventeenth century has been drawn with evident
knowledge and affection. For this alone the book is worth
reading.
I cannot help thinking that ETHEL SIDGwick has been
rather ill-advised in choosing the title for her last book.
The ordinary Island reader, on seeing the announcement
of Le Gentleman (SIDGwick AND JAckson), and observing
that it is by the author of Promise, would no doubt
spring to the nearest bookseller's to buy it. He would
say to the shop-assistant, “Will you please give me
Le —?” and there he would stop. How can you
place a crude British noun
took no real joy in her art;
to her it was a means of
escape from life; she never
“availed herself of the
glamour” of it. The sadness
and disillusionment of one
who saw things too clearly
and felt the inadequacy of
the intellectual vision; who
sought comfort in her Faith,
but never found a perfect
solace for the conviction that
life, on its human side, had
failed her; who, tired out
before her time, foresaw, and
gladly, the end and even the
manner of it; these are the
dominant notes in the corres-
pondence of her later years.
It may well be that they are
accentuated out of all right
proportion in the letters
available for publication, for
one certainly misses in this
record the swift and un-
affected sympathy which
was the charm of her living
speech; one misses her gay
and sparkling vivacity. And
if, which I doubt, these starry
gifts were just a disguise
which her courage and tact
employed that she might hide
her despondency from the

after a French article? No,
he would try a Gallic pro-
nunciation, and then (as
Mr. BELLoc would say) no
more would be heard but
“sounds of strong men
struggling with a word.”
But if any such catastrophe
does occur it will be a sad
loss for the Island reader;
for there is a peculiar charm
and simplicity about the
telling of this story which,
though not easy to analyse,
make themselves felt on the
first page and keep the sym-
pathies engaged until the
last. It is almost as if we
had met the characters before
we were introduced to them
by the writer. The plot (as
may be divined) is laid in
Paris, and is concerned with
the not uncommon theme of
a love that came too late,
because the obligation of a
previous tie was paramount.
I shall not be so barbarous
as to attempt to describe it
further, but it will perhaps
be enough to say that, in-
artistic though it would have
been, I hoped against hope
world at large, and spare her
friends the full knowledge of it, then that is the best of
reasons why the veil she wore in life should have been left
untouched with the seal of death upon it.
Messrs. NELSON's floriners continue to display excellent
quality and a fine catholicity of style. In Sampson Rideout,
Quaker, the last to come under my notice, Miss UNA L.
SILBERRAD has added to the list a volume that will probably
be as popular as any ; since it is of that category of quasi-
historical-costume-romance (what R. L. S. used to call
“tushery") that in these days, whether made for theatre
or library, catches the great heart of the people in its
tenderest spot. Perhaps the tale is not very new; it seems
impossible to vary the ingredients of this kind of fiction—
the high-born heroine, full of whims and captivating
insolence, and the honest hero, “no lady's-man this, but
a plain, outspoken, etc., etc.," who from their first meeting
has obviously not a dog's chance of escaping his matri-
monial destiny. You will find many familiar friends in
for a fatal accident in the
|last few pages. By the way, that little difficulty which
I mentioned at the beginning may be avoided by ordering
Le Gentleman through the post.
Felons and frauds are all the rage in St. JoHN ADcock's
latest book:
On almost every other page you meet a pigeon or a rook;
Of all its people but a few can truly be described as
winning,
And hardly one of all the crew is neither sinned against
nor sinning.
And yet the tale (from STANLEY PAUL), A Man with, so it's
named, a Past,
Is, curiously, not at all of the old shilling shocker cast.
Crime does not lure me as a rule, yet this book did, and that
I read it -
Through and enjoyed it is, as
you'll acknowledge, to the
author's credit. . -

USES OF THE FESTIVAL OF EMPIRE.
THox1As, I own it is a moving sight :
I understand your dazing sense of stupor
When you observe me in a newish light
Posturing as a Crystal Palace super.
To one who knows my unassuming ways
Nothing beneath the sun could well be droller
Than my appearance in the festal maze,
A ancient British warrior in a bowler.
Never before to-day have I been seen
Immersed in purely histrionic wassails,
Where 'neath Londinium's towers the tortured
green -
Thrills to the megaphone of Mr. LASCELLEs.
Yet 'tis the Empire calls, and I musº do
Whate'er she asks me for the Great Idea ;
Must paint myself with woad till all is blue,
And prance to battle under BoADICEA.
And there is Mabel. I am greatly cheered
To see her from a local shrine emerge in
A picture headpiece, having volunteered
To come and figure as a Roman virgin.
She serves Diana's altar, I remark;
And, suiting that vocation so ascetic, you'll
Notice her costume, fragrant of the Park,
And, pendant at her knee, a monstrous reticule.
Thomas, if these rehearsals lend a flame
To mould the links that Love so swiftly forges
In those conditions, frank and free of shame,
Which are the atmosphere of Thespian orgies,
Then, when the Pageant, at its final fling,
Has left us warriors lying dead by sections,
“Butchered to make" et cet., I'll do a thing
Uncontemplated by the stage directions:
I shall break in upon her virgin rites,
Where smoke ascends before the plaster idol,
And, having veiled my prehistoric tights,
Carry her off to make a British bridal!

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
No. 1.-MY FIRST GoLF MAtch.
AFTER Mr. W. T. STEAD.
I was 40 years old before I ever saw
a bull-fight, and 55 before I first entered
a circus. I am now 62, but I never saw
a golf match till last Saturday, when
Mr. Bedlam lured me to Hanger Hill
to see an exhibition game. (I have
not been to a roller-skating rink yet :
I am keeping that experience until I
complete the span of the Psalmist).
There is a certain novelty about the
impressions produced on the sane mind
of mature age by sights familiar to
most people from their childhood, and
I accordingly jot down at random the
thoughts that occurred to me as I
followed the encounter.
First of all I was impressed by
the physique and personality of the
combatants—TAYLOR, sturdy, ruddy,
sanguine and mercurial, with a pro-
nounced prognathous development and
of brachycephalous type : BRAIo, tall,
dark, reserved and somewhat sombre of
visage; a profound thinker, I should
say, with a strong turn for theology
and metaphysics.
Golf is supposed to be a gentle game,
yet the tools—the weapons, I prefer to
call them—are of a sinister, almost dia-
bolic appearance. The head of a driver,
when seen protruding from a bag, is
exactly like that of a snake. There is
something cruel in the very name of
the mashie, and the sight of a niblick
reminds me of the Inquisition. Starting
from the first tee, TAYLOR hit the ball
a cruel blow. BRAID responded with
an even more vicious whack, whirling
his club round his head with the
abandon of a dervish. Then a terrible
thing happened. BRAID's ball rolled
into a bunker. When he came up
to it, his face was black as night, and
when he took the niblick from his
caddie I confess I shuddered at the
thought that he might use it on his
opponent. But, with a restraint that
was ethically admirable, he concen-
trated all his pent-up fury on the ball.
Then in a lightning flash I realised the
final cause and true justification of the
game—as a safety-valve for the ele-
mental passions of humanity.
When BRAID had extricated the ball
from the bunker, his face resumed its
normal pensive expression. So later
on, when TAYLoR's ball lodged in a rut,
and his face became positively purple
with emotion, I trembled for BRAID;
but my tremors were unfounded.
Compared with bull-fighting or polo—
which I hope to witness on my 80th
birthday—golf is an unexciting game.
Only once was a player temporarily
placed hors de combat, and that
was when, a supporting brace hav-
ing given way, an improvised sub-
stitute for a waist-belt was needed
to keep the nether garment in its
place.
The bearing of the spectators filled
me with amazement, their silence re-
calling that of a Quakers' meeting.
Once a shiver ran through the crowd
when BRAID missed a short putt, but
otherwise they kept their feelings
absolutely under control. One feature
of the game struck me as profoundly
touching. While BRAID (a Scotsman)
wore a Norfolk jacket, TAYLOR (who
hails from Devonshire) was clad in
Harris tweeds. And they both of
them played with balls of a pattern
which, I am assured, had its origin
in the inventive genius of Americans.
This tribute to the solidarity of the
Scoto-Anglo-American entente I regard
as the most refreshing lesson of my
visit to Hanger Hill. Next week I am
to see a game of poker for the first
time, and I hope that my impressions
will be equally reassuring.

I hear . acclaim every ace won, by whatever kind of

Acclaim the crashing half-volley stroke, just above the board;
Acclaim the swift, heavily-cut service, that drops from the
back-wall like a stone, or pitches dead in the nick;
Acclaim the mis-hit off the wood, correlative in value to the
subtlest “drop”

- THE SIMPLE LIFE.
“ARE you doing º to-
morrow 2" said my friend Horace
St. George Fitzroy de Were Beau-
champ.
“I expect I shall do something,” I
said cautiously.
“Come and lunch with me at the
Automobile Club. Have you seen it

“Only from the outside, when
trudging to my 'bus.”
. “Well, come early, and I'll show
you the inside. Come about twelve.”
“Right,” I said, “I shall be there in
my automobile.”
I was a little late the next day,
however, as my automobile (a Putney
one) refused to take me further than
Waterloo Place, and I had to make
the rest of the journey on foot. Horace
St. George, beautifully dressed, but
looking extremely small on the horizon,
was waiting for me among the marble
pillars of the entrance hall.
“I suppose you're sure this is your
little club,” I asked. “We haven't
met at the Louvre by mistake?”
“Come along,” he said, and I fol-
lowed him nervously downstairs to the
garage, where we tethered my hat and
stick. With these gone I felt shabbier
than ever.
“Now then,” began Horace, “what
about a bath ?”
I could see what it was.

“I meant a swim,” he hastened to
| explain.
| “Oh, I see,” I said, extremely
relieved. “Right you are.”
“Or suppose we have a game of
| squash first, and a swim afterwards?
Or would you like to try the rifle
range 2"
“You did ask me down for the day,
didn't you? Let's do it all.”
We did it all. By the time we were
dressed again it was two o'clock.
“Lunch,” said Horace. “Shall we
go to the restaurant, or to one of the
club dining-rooms, or—”
“Which is nearest ?” I asked.
don't want to walk very far.”
We set out briskly and arrived at
the restaurant with a splendid appetite.
We lunched amidst rare old tapestries
and to the sound of sweet music.
“Now,” said Horace, “what would
you like to do?”
By this time I was beginning to
understand the spirit of the place.
“Let's go down to the archery
butts,” I suggested, “and put on a few

golds. And after that I should like to
have a game of shinty.”
Horace was willing, but a little
doubtful as to the way. We made
enquiries; and, passing a signpost
which said, “Billiard room, 3 miles—
Card room, 2,” turned sharp to the left
at the bezique courts, kept the lacrosse
sheds well on our right, and arrived at
last on the archery ground.
I suppose it was the lunch, but, any-
how, I was not in my usual form. I
never got a gold at all—only a couple or
so of yellow ochres. Horace was even
worse. Once in the shinty tents, how-
ever, we made up for all this, and a
fiercely contested match ended in my
favour by the odd set in five.
“I should like another swim,” I said,
“Have you only the one bath in your
club 2 ''
Horace had to confess that this was
so, but he was very nice about it. He
promised to complain to the committee.
It is a long and difficult way from the
shinty tents to the one swimming bath,

particularly as there are, at present, no
| telegraph poles to steer by. However,
I made the attempt, with the result
that when I found Horace again I was
thoroughly worn out.
“I must have absolute rest and
quiet for a little,” I said.
“So must I,” he agreed. “Let's go
to the silence room.”
We joined a well-equipped party
which was making a dash for the
library, said good-bye to them there,
and pushed on to the silence room.
Not a sound penetrated the massive
walls and the thick carpet. The carpet
indeed was so luxurious that I com-
pletely lost Horace in it for some
minutes, fortunately spying the top of
his head just when I was giving up
hope, and dragging him by the hair to
a place of safety. Thereafter we slept
till tea.
I am not sure where we had tea. I
think it was brought to us in the Art
Gallery. We had a round on the nine-
hole course afterwards; and then, while
Horace put in an hour with the marker
at the ludo pits, I had my hair cut, and
turned into the Cinematograph Theatre.
We dined in the Italian gardens and
danced in the ball-room till midnight.
“Well,” said Horace, “what do you
think of it 2 ”
“It's a cosy little club,” I said, “but
I don't feel I've really explored it yet.
You must ask me for the week-end
next time. For one thing I want to
see where you all keep your auto-
mobiles.”
“You ought to join.”
“Well, the fact is I am rather short
of automobiles just for the moment.
My aunt has an automobile veil, if you
think I could get in on that. But thank
ou for a very delightful day, Horace.
Y. must come and stay with me at
the Stores some time.”
“You’re sure there's nothing else
you'd like to do? It's quite early.”
As a matter of fact there was some-
thing. I hesitated a moment, and then
decided to take the plunge.
“Horace,” I said, “it’s a magnificent
club. Do you think”—I hesitated
again—“do you think I might”—I
sank my voice to a whisper—“er—might

MR. PUNCH'S SUPPLEMENT.
III–THE MUSIC HALL.
THE decision to give in Edinburgh
a gala music-hall performance to the
KING and QUEEN after the Coronation
has drawn every eye to the variety
boards. The time then is opportune for
a survey of this increasingly popular
form of alleged entertainment.
HISTORY.
The origin of the music-hall is lost
in the mists of prehistoric antiquity,
but its existence can be traced back
several thousand years B.C. Dr.
ARTHUR Evans, while excavating at
Cnossus, in Crete, placed it beyond
doubt that the Labyrinth was a music-
hall, and the Minotaur a monstre
comique. SEMIRAMIs is believed by the
most learned German historians to
have been a bare-back rider, and
THEoDoRA, the wife of JUSTINIAN, was
the VESTA TILLEY of her age, thus
showing at an early epoch the close
relations which have always prevailed
between the Bar and the Stage. Music-
halls have not been confined to one
country or nation, but have flourished
all over the world. There was an
Alhambra in Spain, a Tivoli in the
Campagna, and a Coliseum in Rome
centuries before their names were
associated with the palatial structures
which adorn our Metropolis. The
famous dynasty of Moss had its original
seat at Mosul in Mossopotamia, where
the original Mossoleum still stands; but .
the Iceland Mosses have also long been
famous in pharmaceutical circles. The
name music-hall has been cited as
the most perfect example of the kind
of nomenclature to which the term
lucus a non lucendo is applied, and it is
noteworthy that in one of his rare lapses
into inspired waggery the late John
MILTON emphasized this point in the
phrase, “most music-hall, most melan-
choly,” which later found a counter-
part in RUSKIN's phrase, “all the
agonies of a pantomime.”
MANAGEMENT.
The motto of the music-hall is “one
good turn deserves another—but rarely
gets it.” Clever managers are careful
to mix the bad with the indifferent and
to get as few good things as possible.
By a curious psychical operation that
has never been rightly explained, the
members of every music-hall audience
relinquish their taste and judgment
automatically as they pass the pay-box,
and then everything that they see seems
to them equally meritorious and attrac-
tive. This is peculiarly true of writers
of notices for the press. Hence it
would be a waste of time and money
for managers to obtain real talent.
This explains the success of a host
of performers at the present day from
whom, were audiences not hypnotised,
they would run shrieking. Now and
then, however, it chances by an acci-
dent that a decent performer creeps in;
but were he to disappear no one would
really miss him. -
It should be added that the great
managers are all men of remarkable
culture. Thus Mr. Oswald STOLL has
written one of the most luminous com-
mentaries extant on HERBERT SPEN-
CER's Synthetic Philosophy, while Mr.
ALFRED BUTT's occasional excursions
into eschatology are greeted with rap-
ture at the University of Tübingen.
TERMINoLogy.
A male music-hall performer is
called an “artist,” and a female an
“artiste.” The old theory that an
artist was a fellow who painted pictures
has entirely broken down. A quick-
change performer is called “A Protean
artist.” A dancing girl is “The rage of
Paris,” but whether Paris was in a rage
to see her, or because it had seen her,
is never stated.
Most artistes, it may be added, have
names beginning with Z, such as Zºo,
ZAZEL, ZENA, ZonA, Zoe. The names
of MozART and TENNYson are familiar
to music-hall frequenters, but HoMER,
VIRGIL and LUCRETIUS are unaccount-
ably absent.
SERIos.
Serious singers wear evening dress,
particularly at matinées: hence the
epithet “dashing.” The visitor who
was asked to fill up a Confession
Album, and against “The sweetest
word I know” wrote “Exit,” had just
been listening to a serious singer. For
the most part, they are employed by
distillers and brewers, who pay the
music-hall management to allow them
to sing. The worst of all at the
present moment are—[No advertise-
ments permitted. ED.]
CoMEDIANs.
The ordinary music-hall comedian is
a Cockney comedian. He wears a bad
hat and worse clothes, smacks his leg
with a tiny canc, and sings about
drink. There are also comedians of
all nationalities, which are easily de-
tected. Scotch comedians have twisted
walking-sticks and refer to lassies.
Lancashire comedians say “roon"
instead of “run,” but otherwise are like
comedians from any other country.
Entente cordiale comedians sing too
many songs. Rustic comedians say
“oi ’’ instead of “me,” as in real

country life. American comedians
say “Look-a-here.” Jewish comedians
wear bowler hats over their ears.
Australian comedians seldom learn any-
thing new. There are no Norfolk
comedians.
SAUSAGES.
This article of food, without some
reference to which no music-hall
comedian is really funny, is of ancient
origin. HERODOTUS mentions some-
thing of the kind, but the first allusion
to the sausage more or less as we know
it (or do not know it) now is in
CoPERNICUs. The Germans, always so
ingenious, brought sausage-making to
a high art, and it was the favourite
food of HANs Holbein, who introduced
it to the Court of HENRY WIII.,
when he arrived here from Augsburg in
1526. It is said that he was so
addicted to sausages that he could not
paint without one, and sometimes
would absent-mindedly employ it as
a mahl-stick. While painting the
“Duchess of Milan” he consumed
eight dozen of the best.
Any reference to sausages, particu-
larly in association with dogs or the
word mystery, convulses the audience
in every hall. Hence, since man is
an imitative animal, one gets plenty
of it.
THE DANCE.
The Christian patron of the Dance is
of course ST. VITUs, a holy man who
made his way through life with some
very odd steps in the fifth century.
There had been dances before, but St.
WITUs brought the art before the public.
At the present moment the fashion is
for Slavonic or Russian dancing, which,
when the performers can be induced to
perform together and bury their private
hatchets, can be very effective.
SKETCHEs.
The sketch is a play, either original
or a condensation of an old drama,
which may not by law last for more
than twenty minutes and never lasts
less than half-an-hour.
IMITATORs.
The music-hall imitator is the only
form of pickpocket who is not locked
up.
“It is almost needless to state that the sew-
ing of kitchen garden seeds is now in full
swing.”—Gardening No'es in “Alloa Journal.”
We have certainly heard of some
vegetable patches being “darned.”
“The Baltic sailed for New York on Saturday,
having on loard Colonel and Mrs. Buchanan,
Mr. and Mrs. Waldo Pettingill, and various
others.”—The JVorld.
We are glad these “various others.”
were there too, if only for ballast.
“Lord Salisbury, who has not been very well,
is taking a motoring tour in the South of
France, by way of recruiting his health."—The
World.
Without the assistance of this last
phrase we should never have guessed
his Lordship's motive, so we have great
pleasure in putting it into italics.
From a testimonial :-
“After the second treatment she walked
downstairs one foot at a time. She has not
been able to walk downstairs before in the
past five years, except by stepping down on
each step with one foot at a time. This is re-
markable. Send five more boxes.”
The old jumping days of six years ago
seem to be over.

To hunt him up in Who's Who's.
I shall not clasp him by the kingly hand,
Nor meet his steadfast eyes—not if I know it—

SHEEHY more than insinuated that

heard him roll out the syllables), “post-

not being on friendly terms with one of
the FoxEs, invariably handed over to
the other the correspondence thus ad-

PostMASTER - GENERAL, bound to
support a subordinate officer of his

It was Mr. O'SHEE, of whom the
House knows little, that placed it under

arising, he was evicted, and the farm
left desolate, mouldering to decay.
There were subtle touches in Mr.
O'SHEE's prose that recalled another
picture limned for all time by
TENNYSoN :
The broken sheds look'd sad and strange:
Unlifted was the clinking latch;
Weeded and worn the ancient thatch
Upon the lonely moated grange.
Something more fleshly than the
hand of Time being suspected in con-
nection with the quickening of the
ruin of the farm buildings, they were
placed under special police protection.
It happened by strange coincidence
that on a certain day when the police
were on protection duty at the farm
a case of housebreaking occurred in
neighbouring hamlet and property was
stolen. What Mr. O'SHEE wanted to
know was “whether the police have any
general community when their services
are requisitioned to preserve the grass
on derelict farms where there are no
cattle to graze the same.” The
phrasing is a little obscure, but its
meaning may be guessed.
The Ministerial minion who represents
Dublin Castle having made reply fami-
liar in such circumstances, Mr. O'SHEE,
relentlessly pursuing him, insisted upon
knowing why the cost of special police
protection was incurred on account of
a farm “when the only living animals
on it are seagulls that fly over it.”

most perfect bull ever trotted through

parliamentary elections. JIMMY had
cited a case in which it was alleged
that no less a person than the LoRD
CHANCELLOR-HALSBURY, to wit—had,
on the eve of a by-election, interposed
with speech or letter, championing the
cause of one of the Candidates.
Regarding JIMMY with wistful air,
BILLY DYKE, opposed the motion. “I
must,” he said, “admit that the righthon-
ourable gentleman has gone to the top
of the tree and caught a very large fish.”
That was delightful, and till to-day
remained incomparable. Think it will
be conceded that Mr. O'SHEE has

Business done :—In Committee again
on Parliament Bill.
Thursday.—LoRD CHANCELLoR once
more at Bar of House (so to speak)
charged with carrying on HALSBURY's
mission of swamping magisterial bench
with good Conservatives. Crowded
House hears with delight of the morn-
ing call of Lord DE RAMSEY upon LoRD
CHANCELLOR. Related in artless style
of the Custos Rotulorum of the Isle
of Ely, it is the daintiest comedy. DE
RAMSEY dropped in at Eaton Square,
he tells us, to suggest names of six
gentlemen suitable for Commission of
the Peace for the Isle of Ely.
“If the Family Bible were in my
hands,” he assured the Lord CHAN-
CELLOR, “I would swear that I do not
know their politics.”
There flashed across Lord CHAN-
CELLOR's agile mind the shrewd saying,
“Qui s'eaccuse s'accuse'; but he did
not allude to it. Pink of politeness, he
waved aside the Family Bible, which
Custos had left at home. Suggested
merely for form's sake that, an Advisory
Committee having been appointed for
the expressed purpose of nominating
candidates for the magistracy, it would
be just as well if the list were submitted
to them before names were added to
Commission of the Peace.
Custos had not the slightest ob-
jection. Indeed, thought it was rather
the kind of thing you ought to do, you
know. Only it happened that he was
leaving for Egypt in the morning. The
six suitable gentlemen of anonymous
politics were growing impatient, and
perhaps the affair might just as well be
finished right off. LoRD CHANCELLOR
agreed, and NEIL PRIMRose, waking
up one morning, resolved to make
fresh effort to interest Lord CHAN-
CELLOR in direction of redressing
balance of Liberal and Conservative
magistrates for the Isle of Ely as it
was left on retirement of HALSBURY
from Woolsack, learned that six more
Conservatives had been added in a
batch. And this after he had been
assured by Lord CHANCELLOR's Sec-
retary that the composition of the
Bench was “a question that could
not at present be reopened.”
As for LoRD CHANCELLOR, the
MEMBER For SARK tells me that
when he learned he had added six
Conservative magistrates to a single
Commission of the Peace—this in
addition to others of same political
complexion with whom he had en-
dowed the Blessed Isle—you might
have knocked him down with a feather.
That obviously a figure of speech,

it sufficiently expresses the surprise

“It's doing me no harm either,” said
the stranger, in that languid manner
that expresses the enthusiasm of certain
temperaments.
“And if I ever met him, it would give
me the greatest pleasure to invite him

geniuses—aren't you?”

after thinking. Then, passing his hand
over his thinning locks, he added:

AT THE PLAY.
“KISMET.”
“I HAVE lived to-day!" said Mr.
OscAR Asche, on a note of justifiable
exaltation, at the close of his perform-
ance as Hajj, the Baghdad beggar.
And indeed it had been a good day's
work, as you may see from the follow-
ing time-table, drawn up roughly from
memory:— -
5.30–7.30 A.M. Sits outside a mosque,
and begs for alms, calling down Allah's
blessings on those that give, his curses
on those that don't.
7.35. Nearly kills another beggar
who wants to appropriate his ancestral

informant.
7.55. Gives up being a beggar.

11.47. Is pardoned by Mansur out of
consideration for his wrist-muscles,
which might be useful for assassina-
tions.
11.48. Is given an appointment in
the service of Mansur, on the under-
s'anding that he will murder the
Caliph for him.
11.50. Offers to Mansur his daughte:
in marriage.

proper to his new office.

at the Caliph's Diwan.

a sword.
7.5.-7.10. Does his best, but is
embarrassed by the fact that he is

amulet, of which he, as long-lost son,
wears the counterpart. Mansur flings
his sword away.
7.11. Hajj assumes fatherhood, to-
gether with discarded weapon.
7.15. Stabs Mansur in back of ribs as

edge of hareem plunge-bath.

7.21–7.45. Holds him under till he is
drowned.
7.46. Withdraws into private life,
by trap-door. -
8.10–9.15. Is absent from his daugh-
ter's wedding. (A case of tact, the
bridegroom being the man he had
attempted to murder at 3.45.)
9.30. Returns, in beggar's guise, to
ancestral pitch, to find another in
possession.
9.31. Kicks him out.
9.35—10.0 Moralises on the strange
vagaries of Fate (Kismet).
10.5 Retires to sleep on pitch.
10.5%. Snores like a pig.
You will gather from this schedule
that, though he ends as he began—a
beggar on a stone pitch—he has not
lived his day in vain. Things in
Baghdad can never be quite the same,
for he has rid the place of two villains,
a brigand and a wicked Wasir.
Meanwhile his status has been
modified by others who also have not
been idle, for his daughter has been
wedded to the Caliph, and Hajj is
therefore now the father-in-law of the
representative of Allah.
I dare not ask myself how far the
plot, frankly crude and obvious in its
melodrama, would have satisfied our
intelligences if it had been laid in
London of the 20th century; but in so
superb an antique setting, with its
Oriental wealth of colour, the play it-
self hardly mattered at all. Indeed, with
the vision of Sumurun before me (the
author of Kismet, by the way, took no-
thing from this source) I am not sure
whether, apart from the obscurity
which it entails, dumb-show would
not have been more effective, so
hard it is to listen well when the eye
is closely engaged. Certainly our best
time was what we spent in the gorgeous
bazaar, where the dialogue was least
distracting. Now and again, still
recalling Sumurun, one felt the need of
a greater severity of background. The
hot sunlight on the wall of the “Poor
House” seemed to lend a certain
tawdriness to the gay colours of the
dresses. One's senses, too, grew tired
long before the end, in part because
they were never allowed to rest in the
intervals, which were filled with pro-
cessions and songs and formal dances
in front of the drop-curtain—a happy
device, but one that made for satiety.

had the occasion; for Peggy Admaston,
the respondent, soliloquised more
than once under cross-examination in
a manner which he must have recog-
nized (if he had ever been to theatres
across the water) as the real thing.
I should have cheered like mad in
the gallery.
If it is the object of the authors
(Messrs. E. G. HEMMERDE and FRANCIS
NEILsoN) to show up the cruelty and
injustice of the Divorce Court, then
they have not chosen the best case for
their purpose. Mrs. Admaston's con-
duct had been so incredibly foolish that
no man who had not seen the first two
Acts of the play could have believed
her guiltless; no counsel who had
spent the best years of his life in an
atmosphere of lies could have thought
her explanations truthful. And if it be
said that every look of Peggy's beau-
tiful face, every tone of her protesting
voice spoke innocence—an innocence
which made the relentless cross-
examination a deliberate cruelty—then
I reply that any one who has seen
Miss MADGE TITHERADGE at the Globe
Theatre knows just what a wonderful
air of reality can be given to play-
acting by a woman of beauty and
great histrionic ability.
In short, a guilty woman would have
behaved out of court and in court in
exactly the way Peggy behaved; and,
that being so, the severity in this
particular case of the search for truth
can hardly be indicted. The authors
have been hardly fair to their theme;
they should have made the respondent
less foolish, the co-respondent less
notorious, the situations less com-
promising. Then I, for one, should
have joined them most cheerfully in
any expression of contempt for the
Bar. It is a subject upon which I
have long wanted to give tongue.
Mr. LEwis WALLER was Collingwood,
and he had an unsympathetic part until
the last Act, when he discovered the
authorship of the anonymous letter and
unveiled the wicked Lady Atwill; but
he was always interesting and quietly
effective. Mr. GUY STANDING was
very badly suited by the part of the
Itt. Hon. George Admaston, M.P. Say
what you like of our dollar-dictated
Cabinet Ministers, they haven't Ameri-

sel and the Butterfly was magnificently
played throughout by Mr. NorMAN

ADGE. I had never seen the latter in a
big part before, and I was astonished at
her power. M.
“Dr. Strnuss's Eatest,” says The
Observer,and we are left rather anxious.
FIRST-FRUITS OF COVENT
GARDEN.
WHETHER it meant that the operatic
public is saving itself for the Coronation
festivities; or that there were not enough
tiaras on exhibition in the scantily-filled
boxes of the more expensive tiers; or
that the improbabilities of Lakmé were
past swallowing (I don't think this can
be thereason, for Grand Opera is nothing
if not improbable)—anyhow the attitude
of the audience at the opening night
at Covent Garden was marked by what
Mr. John BURNs would describe as a
certain “gelidity.” True, Madame
TETRAzzINI brought down an odd
rafter or two at the traditional point—
the close of the so-called Bell Song ;
but most of her pearls were cast before
rather unresponsive stalls, and the rav-
ishing notes of Mr. M'CorMACK some-
how missed their rightful dues. Later,
no doubt, we shall warm to our work.
Meanwhile, Lakmé was a sufficiently
appropriate prelude to the season's un-
ambitious programme.
Regarded as an historical study,
this French picture of British India is,
of course, farcical. I pass over the
sacrosanct groves of the Hindoo temple,
where fantasy is permissible; but for
anybody who has ever seen the actual
thing there could be no purer work of
creative art than this travesty of an
Indian bazaar (“market-place,” the
programme calls it). The headgear of
the native men was that of a French
chef; and the women resembled
Hindoos in nothing but their wigs
and the duskiness of their cocoa-paste.
At one time the crowd was thick as
a swarm of bees; at the next it parted
to admit an incredible troupe of Nautch-
girls, British to the bone, and poorish
dancers at that ; then in a flash it was
gone, leaving the “market-place” com-
pletely at the disposal of a Hindoo
girl and an English officer for the
purposes of an Italian duet. As for
the uniforms (the officers carried canes)
I doubt if some of them had ever been
seen before on land or sea. One or
two seemed to be of an amphibious
pattern; for the period can hardly be
later than the date of the Indian
Mutiny, and epaulettes had by then
been abolished in the Army.
Even Mr. CLAUDE Aveling's English
version of Signor A. ZANARDINI's Italian
version of Messieurs E. GondinBT's and
P. GILLE's original French libretto
failed to convince me that the atmo-
sphere was strictly Anglo-Indian. For
one thing my book of words (1/6 net)
contained not a syllable of the dialogue
(negligible, no doubt) of the English
ladies. Even the name of Gerald's
carelessly-discarded fiancée appeared
always in the Italian as “Miss Ellen "
and in the English as “Eleanor”; and
I shall never know what Messieurs
E. Gondine.T and P. GILLE called her
till I hear the opera in French, and that
will never happen here so long as
Madame TETRAzzINI has a voice in the
matter.
The diva's pyrotechnics pleased
me less than the dulcet notes of her
amorous passages; but I ask nothing
better than Mr. M'CorMAck's singing,
and have certainly never heard anything
half so good from a British officer
in a tightish uniform. Mr. EDMUND
BURKE's voice had the dignity of his
beard, a really noble appendage. One
expects a good deal from the beard of a
Brahmin hierophant with a name like
Nilakantha; and I am sure that Mr.
CLARKSON felt this too, and that was
why he put some of his best work into
it. O. S.
RONDEAU.
[Mr. CHURCHILL said that unless they could
dispose of certain amendments by a certain time
there would be nothing for it but to put their
heads down and butt into the Bill.]
OUR statesmen but a little while agone
Trimmed each his lamp of intellect and
shone,
Eager to make the darker places plain
By the effulgence of an ardent brain;
No surfeit of high-thinking once could
glut
Our statesmen—but
To-day they catch a newer, better trick;
Why use the brain if craniums are
thick?
Do we expect ungovernable rams
To war with words or pale at epigrams?
So, trusting to mere density of nut,
Our statesmen butt.
Mr. ANDREW LANG in The Morning Post:
“In the Eighteenth Century a young man
was hanged (if we may believe John Wesley)
for the murder of a person whom he later met
in a Spanish prison in South America.”
Sorry as we are to have to say it, we
don't believe JoHN WESLEY this time.
“The coiner of what will surely become an
immortal phrase was Mr. Brodribb. Of course
he used it in the holiday spirit. Speaking of
the internal affairs of his church he said: "He
knew little about ritual and cared less. The
exuberance of church music was to him a super-
fluity of naughtiness' . . . . There is nothing
new under the sun, and I don't suggest that
Mr. Brodribb has discovered a new idea. He
would not let himself claim that. Our grand.
fathers used to say “It’s naughty but it's nice."
Mr. Brodribb simply puts the old idea into
twentieth century clothes.”—Hastings Argus.
Mr. BRodRIBB must try again. There
are lots more immortal phrases which
he might coin.

CoMPLAINTs made of symptoms of
poisoning by diners in certain cheap
restaurants have led to stringent pre-
cautions in the claret industry in the
French provinces of D’Ope and Faique.
Cavalry occupy the wine-vats, and a
prohibitive tariff has been placed on
croton oil, French polish, methylated
spirits, and pain-killer. This has
thrown thousands of employees in the
wine business out of work, and, the
manufacturers state, entirely destroyed
the strong aroma which was the
peculiar feature of cheap claret.
Fresh riots have broken out in con-
sequence of the determination of the
British Government to support the
Pure Milk movement, and make a
sharp line of delimitation between the
dairies and the pumps and reservoirs
of the country.
Great excitement exists in the Mid-
lands over the Standard Bread riots,
due to the suppression by the Govern-
ment of white bread as dangerous to
life. Coffee grounds, sawdust and oak
varnish had been extensively used to
bring flour to the requisite Standard
colour, and honest millers have to be
protected by a detachment of the Car-
melite Fencibles (Harmsworth's Own).
During the operations a White (or
Starch Meal) Attacking Force at-
tempted to get through a Brown (or
Standard) Defending Force and loot the
supplies of germ and semolina. The
indignation of the White rioters is all
the greater because they assert that no
one would want Standard bread if they
hadn't been told that they ought to
like it.

“DEAR Miss—, My little Elsie come

A CORONATION COMPLAINT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I hope you will
excuse my writing this letter, and not
think I mean any disloyalty by it. For
that, I assure you, Mr. Punch, I do not.
But it is a thing which has grieved me
to the heart, and I am sorry to say my
husband too is quite dispirited about it.
It is the matter of the Coronation
gifts to the KING and QUEEN, Mr.
Punch—I mean those that all the
Georges are giving to the KING and all
the Marys to the QUEEN. As I say, I
don't want to make a fuss or seem dis-
loyal, but I do want to say that I think
there is some mistake when my hus-
band and I are left out of it. You
wouldn't find loyaller people than us
anywhere, Mr. Punch, though I say it
myself. But when we see all the
Georges and Marys (yes, and the Mays
and Maries and Miriams too) allowed
to contribute to the presents, and us
not, it does seem hard. You see, Mr.
Punch, my husband's Christian name
is Marius, and mine is Georgina. I
suppose it wouldn't be considered eli-
quette for him to contribute to the
QUEEN’s gift and me to the KING's?

THE UNDYING FLAME.
Too soon, when the Spring has released us
From Winter, his rage and his rods,
We banish the Fire-god, Hephaestus,
The best of the gods;
Forlorn in my desolate “sitter,”
Too soon I am bound to grow bitter
For lack of his warmth and his glitter,
And the poker's affectionate prods.
We are sons, I suppose, of the Viking
Who conquered the storm and the wave,
And although it is not to our liking
We have to be brave;
So we say, “There shall be no surrender,
The sun has arrived in his splendour;"
And we put an old fern in the fender,
A garland of flowers on a gravel
But the Sun-god so frequently loses
His way, or has punctured a tyre;
And chilled is the heart of the Muses,
And hushed is the lyre; -
And scarcely a song-bird has carolled,
But still we go lightly apparelled,
And bear it, remembering HAROLD
And TosTIG, and don't have a fire.
I call it unspeakably silly ;
Yes, even in years that are hot,
I shudder, I shrink from that stilly
And ghost-haunted grot;
Ah, would that some builder would fashion
The home of my dreams, of my passion,
Where Yule-logs are rosy and ashen,
Let the weather be no matter what
From May to the end of September,
By no superstition enticed,
The brand, the Olympian ember,
The booty unpriced
That was boned from on high by Prometheus
(All hail to his nerve and his knee-thews!)
I should still (in the caviller's teeth) use,_-
And the rest of the house should be *
Svobl.

TEIE PATENT MILITARY HAT
TRUNK.
THE PATENT MILITARY HAT TRUNK
is constructed so as to hold the
complete equipment of service hats
required by every officer, vide “Dress
Regulations, 1908.”
THE PATENT MILITARY HAT TRUNK
is exceedingly strong, being made of
steel with gun-metal hinges.
THE PATENT MILITARY HAT TRUNK
can be easily moved by a fatigue party
of one N.C.O. (sergeant, if possible)
and 19 men. The stores required are
as follows:—
1 20-ton “Jack" lifting hydraulic.
6 planks, oak, 10 inches by 17 inches
by 3 inches.
8 6-inch ground rollers, elm.
1 heavy gun tackle, a treble and
double 9-inch block, with a fall
of 3}-inch rope, 15 fathoms long.
1 crab capstan (when moving the
trunk up an incline).
THE PATENT MILITARY HAT TRUNK
can be converted into a strong case for
the grand piano.
THE PATENT MILITARY HAT TRUNK
may be used on service as an absolutely
impregnable obstacle, or a bomb-proof
shelter.
THE PATENT MILITARY HAT TRUNK
will be found, without its lid, a perfectly
seaworthy eight-oar gig. The lid may
be used as a bath.
THE PATENT MILITARY HAT TRUNK
is an ideal receptacle for the mess
silver, the band instruments, and the
regimental trophies.
THE PATENT MILITARY HAT TRUNK.
Colonel Currie Liver, C.B., writes:
“I found no very great difficulty in
moving the trunk when we left Pickle-
kidnie for Devilishpoore (our present
station) as I was able to charter a
traction-engine for the purpose.”
“I have persuaded my husband to
let me use his fascinating trunk for my
hats.”—H. DELANEY KNox (Mrs.).
“We wish you every success |
A boon to trade. It undoubtedly
fills a gap.”—MANAGER, West-Eastern
Railway.

NoTICE.
Owing to the Army Council's recent
issue of a new “Shako,” the PATENT
MILITARY HAT TRUNK will necessarily
have to be enlarged.
The Daily Mirror finishes up its
description of an encounter with bur-
glars thus:—
“He threw up the window of his room and
fired with a revolver at a man below, who
escaped. The only article of value missed was
an old silver épergne.”
It must be a consolation to the marks-
man to know that, even if he missed
the burglar, he scored several bulls
among the old silver. Amid the hail
of bullets the épergne seems to have
borne a charmed life.

IF Harry had not been so anxious to
take me to see the Russian Dancers,
it would never have happened; as it
was, MICHAEL MoRDKIN entirely upset
all my previous ideas of manly beauty
in general, and Harry's in particular.
In the Tube going home my throbbing
brain was filled with soul-stirring
memories of that gay and glorious
young Greek god—or was it a shepherd?
—anyhow, it was something with dark
clustering curls and a bow and arrow,
who, with one of his exquisite, intoxi-
catingly eacquisite leaps, had landed

mured passionately. “anyone can do it with practice.”
“Who?” inquired Harry. “Can they 2” said Harry. He
“MICHAEL,” I replied softly. “Oh, looked at me, as I thought, with
Harry, those beautiful leaps of his, a rather contemptuous expression, and
when he hung poised in the air for allo! I seemed to see myself stodgy and
moment, with one symmetrical leg insignificant, dowdily clad and plainly
trailing behind!”
“That's easy enough,” remarked
featured. It was horrid, so was the
remote far-away look in Harry's eyes.
Harry scornfully; “it’s only hurdling
without the hurdles.”
“Easy, is it?” Iretorted. “I should
like to see you do it, anyhow.”
He has beautiful blue eyes, by the
way, but just then they seemed to be ||
looking right beyond and above me.
“Yes, she's quite good,” I remarked

straight into a heart I had hitherto
believed was exclusively engaged by
another. Then I woke from my
rainbow visions, looked across at Harry
on the opposite seat, and realized with
a horrid pang that I had promised to
marry him. How heavy, how dull,
how earthly he looked; how unromantic
his bowler hat, how depressing his
overcoat, how terribly commonplace
his tweed trousers' Could I bear it 2
My eyes closed. Again the gay and
graceful young god, or whatever he
was, flashed across my vision, and I
decided I could not.
“Well,” said Harry, with an evident
effort, as we walked home, “what did
you think of it?”
“We must go again!” I answered in
a suppressed voice.
“You have,” he replied; “you saw
me win the hurdles last year.”
His words called up a vivid recollec-
tion of a lanky youth in shorts with
a red face and dishevelled hair
scrambling over a few fences in a foggy
field. I drew in my breath with a
shudder and said no more, but once
again sank into a blissful nerve-vibrat-
ing reverie. Then I became aware that
Harry had apparently forgotten my
existence and was talking to himself.
“Divine !” he murmured; “beauti-

petal, a floating feather l’’
“What are you burbling about?”
I said sharply.
“ANNA,” he answered softly—"ANNA

it. I had never dreamed of such
briskly. He made no reply, but his
head drooped dejectedly. I forgot my
own hopelessness and slipped my hand
in his. His fingers closed round mine
and our eyes met in a long understand-
ing look of mutual sympathy.
“Harry, old man,” I faltered, “on
second thoughts I think we won't go
again.”
“Right O, little woman,” he replied,
and we sighed two big sighs of mingled
regret and relief.

ALL GIRLS.
A PROTEST.
SIR,--I wish as a man to record an
injustice to men and to lodge a com-
plaint against theatre-managers and
dramatists—whichever of them it is
that gives new plays their titles.
My grievance is that the impres-
sion conveyed by these titles is
that only women are interesting on
the stage. Go to any play you like
and you will find that the men in it
are as important as the women; and
yet, if the title is to be trusted, women,
and only women, are involved. How
often does a man get into the title 2 I
ask you. One did recently—in “The
Man from Mexico"—and before that
we had “A Man's Shadow" and “The
Man from Blankley's"; but how few
and far betwcen! Look at the plays
of the moment in any newspaper. The
first to catch the eye is “The Quaker
Girl.” Girl, you observe. Why not
Quaker Boy? Because (I am told) no
one would then go to see it ! True;
but what an injustice to man, equal to
any of the so-called injustices to women
of which we hear so much—too much.
Then “Peggy,” then “Lady Patricia,”
then “A Doll's House,” then “Fanny's
First Play" (why not “George's Last
Play" for example?), then “Cousin
Kate,” then “The Girl in the Train"—
always girls, you notice. There are
men in this train too—otherwise there
would be no drama (there isn't very
much any way)—but do you suppose
it ever occurred to the author or man-
ager to name it after them 2 . Never!
And what had come before it 2 “The
Girls of Gottenberg,” “The Shop
Girl,” “The Balkan Princess,” “The
Dollar Princess,” “The Merry Widow”
(are widowers never merry, then?),
“The Woman in the Case,” and myriads
more.
Girls, girls, girls—that is the rule;
and the nauseous part of it is (as I
must admit) that the rule was drawn
up by men. There is no esprit-de-
corps. That is what England wants—
esprit-de-corps.

Uplift thee, Muse, and sing us why and where
So many what-d'you-call-'ems sit and stare
Upon the King of England and the Queen
In tooral-coral umti-something sheen—
(You see the idea.)
But most uplift thee, Muse, to tell of those
Who, for the lack of necessary clothes,
Or else because they do not like a crush, -
Remain behind at Bewdlay-on-the-Mush—(our village).
Their hearts beat just as loyally as if,
Clad in a something-umthing collar stiff,
Or in a lumti-tumti harem gown
They'd left the country for the stifling town.
Loyalty bursts from every heart in spates,
But, most of all, from Mr. Banting-Bate's 1– -
(Husband of Mrs. Banting-Bate. He has very kindly
lent his hill for the bonfire. There will be a pause
here, while the Vicar leads the cheering.)
Lo, lightly dawns at last the day of Kings,
Of Pomps and Power and Pageantry and things,
When to the Abbey goes beloved George—
Ter-rumti-umti-umti forge or gorge—
(This line doesn't look very promising at present.)
Archbishop, Bishop, Dean, Archdeacon, Priest,
Gathered from North and South and West and East,
Duke, Marquis, Earl, Baron and Baronet
And Wiscount too, in solemn conclave met,
Salute him, England's monarch—“George the Fifth !”
(Tremendous applause, led by Mr. Banting - Bate.
I hope it will go on long enough to hide the fact
that we are going to lose a line here. The fact is
there is simply no rhyme to “fifth.”)
And lo! the cheers break forth, both long and loud,
From everybody in the Abbey's crowd—
From Duke and Deacon, from The Daily Mail's
Own correspondent and the Prince of Wales.
Still more they cheer (how much I cannot tell)
As soon as good Queen Mary's crowned as well—
(Applause led by Mrs. Bletherstone, who inaugurated
the Mary Fund in our village.)
The ceremony over, then they go
Around the city in procession slow;
In all the pageantry of pomp and power
They ride through London for about an hour—(roughly.)
Let us, dear people, let us leave them there—
So kingly, queenly, noble and so fair.
(A pause, while Miss Gathers of the Post Office presents
Mrs. Banting-Bate with a glass of water.)
So much for that. And now a solemn hush
Comes o'er us here in Bewdlay-on-the-Mush.
These scenes which I have tried to adumbrate—
The Coronation and the March in State—
These scenes are not for us—except, I hope,
Upon the Little Bewdlay bioscope.
But even here, remote from King and Queen,
How great our preparat-i-ons have been
Some say the tale of it has darkly spread
From Upper Bewdlay down to Bewdlay Head—
(Two important towns in the neighbourhood.)
Who knows but what a rumour of the thing
Has even reached our gracious Queen and King!
How that a certain resident of fame—(Mr. Banting-Bate)
Has nobly lent the place which bears his name—
(Banting Place. Mr. Bate took the additional name
of Banting when he took the place. And, to be
eract, he has only lent one hill on the Estate.)
That there a bonfire might be built and burnt
And lessons too of loyalty be learnt—
(I mean, of course, that the bonfire will in itself be a
lesson. Not that any sort of continuation class
will be held upon the ashes.)
Moreover, how the Vicar will assist
Supported by his kindly wife, I wist—

no trouble when once the facts are in my hands.)

THE UNIHAPPY MEAN.
THE man had gone on his bended knee and proposed
marriage to a lady, and the lady, being willing to marry
and not otherwise engaged, had said “Yes,” or uttered
sounds to that effect. The parents had consented, and
in due course had telephoned to the London Stores and
ordered a wedding. But neither the lucky man, nor the
accommodating lady, nor either of the affable parents,
was the leading character in this drama. The pro-
tagonists were a nasty young man in patent leather ||
boots, whose duty it was to show the invited guests to
their proper seats in the church, and a nice old gentle-
man in spats, who attended the ceremony in the double
capacity of uncle of the bride and second cousin of the
bridegroom.
“This way, please,” said the young man to the elder as
he met him at the door and took him in charge. “Rela-
tives of the bride will sit on the left side of the aisle,
relatives of the bridegroom on the right. Which are you?”
“Both,” said the old gentleman, pleasantly; “shall I
stand in the aisle 2"

No. 2.-MY INTRoDUCTIox To GRAsso.
Thrilling ea periences of Mr. F. C. Selous.
In a life so largely given up to big
game shooting as mine, there has
naturally been little time for the more
polite and pacific amenities of civiliza-
tion. Hence I have seen but few plays
and met fewer players. When therefore
I received, last week, an invitation to
visit the IIippodrome and see the
Sicilians and afterwards sup with the
famous Signor GRAsso I gladly con-
sented. -
Of the play I say nothing. It was
Malia, and sufficiently thrilling; but I
am no dramatic critic. But of GRAsso,
as I met him aſter the play, I have
done little but think since, and can
write freely now that my arm is better
and the bandages are off my head.
| But let me tell the story as it
happened. We were to meet in a
private room in an Italian restaurant.
I arrived first, and was standing by
the fireplace meditating on the Sicilians
and their emotional art when I was
conscious of a thundering on the stairs'
and a tremor of the whole building,
accompanied by a rich roaring as of a
peculiarly unctuous lion. As the sound
drew nearer I could distinguish some
Italian words, among them prominently
“Illustrissimo Inglese,” “Maraviglioso
cacciatore,” and “Tiratore intrepido.”
Then with a crash the door was
burst in, and into the room there
sprang the ardent Sicilian with his
arms outstretched. He made but one
spring and was on me. We fell together,
his teeth affectionately but firmly
fleshed in my left ear and his arms
embracing me with the grip of a
boa-constrictor. All the while he was
uttering expressions indicative of the
joy it gave him to be privileged to meet
me, whom he styled his “incompara-
bile gallo di combattimento.”
I struggled to get free, but in vain.
I replied in my best Italian that the
honour was no lºss mine, and I was
proud indeed to be on terms of intimacy
with such an artist. He liked this and
changed to my other ear. At length
he released me and rose, and, seizing
a glass from the table, filled it with
Chianti, emptied it at a draught and
flung it to the ground, vowing that no
one should use it again.
rebounding flew in my face and cut my
A fragment
cheek, thus completing the ruin both of
my features and of my dress-shirt.
For a few moments GRAsso remained
quiet; then with a terrific smile he
observed “Andiamo"
and pointed
to the door, which opened into a
gallery overlooking the main hall of
the restaurant. Scarcely had I got
outside when he seized me with an iron
grip, called me the most wonderful
man he had ever met, kissed me
twenty-two times on each cheek, and
observing in a hoarse voice, “Volti
subito," leapt over the rail on to seven
members of the Stock Exchange, who
were supping together.
My impressions of GRAsso are still
vivid, but my doctor assures me they
will gradually fade away.
I am planning a new tour to the
Zambesi for rest and quiet among the
man-eaters.

Seem to remember that, when at the
General Election of 1905 there was
talk of BROTHER EUGENE going to
assist BRoth ER CATHCART in his can-
didature for Orkney, SARK circulated
report to effect that at a public meet-
ing, held in Kirkwall Court House,
protest was made on ground of public
safety. There was, it was insisted,
no room on the island for both the
Bounding Brothers,whose united height
approaches 14 feet, whose combined
weight would (if the scales held out)
mark 39 stone.
That by the way. It did not
seriously affect weight of CATHCART's
grievanco. Hobhouse, judiciously ab-
sent, ILLINGworTH, acting as Deputy,
ments to existing laws, it was also
decided to formulate the following
Unwritten (Amateur) Laws:—
1. Players shall, in the best interests
of the game, refrain from emerging
from the pavilion for at least a quarter
of an hour after the umpires have gone
out.
2. A player who, on returning to the
pavilion at the conclusion of his inn-
ings, is received with applause, shall
break into a lumbering run for the last
dozen yards, at the same time being
careful not to trip on the pavilion steps.
3. An appeal for l.b.w.. shall not be
regarded as a “confident" appeal un-
less it include an ejaculation on the
part of long-leg.
4. A “general” appeal for l.b.w.. shall
be any appeal loud enough to wake the
not at right angles, to the crease,
which shall be drawn preferably in the
centre of the matting. The matting
shall be maintained uncracked and in
good condition by the application of
grease regularly throughout the season,
the best results being secured by a
mixture of linseed and olive oil in
equal parts.
The Secretary will be glad to hear of
any other Unwritten (Amateur) Laws
suitable for embodiment in the M.C.C.
Rules.

Bread.]
OH, the sports were done and the races run, but the Tug-
of-war was left,
And the school was full of the coming pull, and longed to
display its heft;
For every house had applied its nous to training a lusty
eight,
And each was mad on somebody's fad for putting on extra
weight.
For Blore's had smiles for EUSTACE MILEs, and lived on the
sweet, sweet pea,
And Cook's were caught by the line of thought of a very
renowned M.D.,
So they stayed indoors with unwashed pores for most of
the Easter Term,
But Foster's were fed on Standard Bread and the whole of
the healthy germ.
But Cook's caught cold when they left the fold, and shrank
in the light of day,
And Blore's physique was wretchedly weak, and they
suddenly passed away,
But Foster's remained and Fort's, who trained on original
English fare,
Whose food in chief was the good roast beef and plenty of
open air.
Now Fort's were big with ox and pig, and one of them
broke the scale,
But Foster's had grown a good ten stone and swore by The
Daily Mail;
So they put their trust in the Standard crust and the power
of the halfpenny Press,
And they shifted Fort's on the seat of their shorts, and won
a superb success.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“PLAYING WITH FIRC.”
WHEN an actor marries an actress
(always a daring experiment) and, six
months later, disguises himself in a
wig and moustache, a Russian uniform
and an Italian accent, and succeeds
in imposing upon her, you will be right
in suspecting an improbability. Un-
likely in the case of an ordinary wife,
it is more than unlikely with one who
has been accustomed to recognise her
man under all sorts of histrionic make-
ups. So certain critics, I understand,
are complaining that all this is in-
credible. I confess it delights me that
they can preserve so fresh and ingen-
uous an attitude in the course of labours
that would leave most men hald and
cynical. Improbability in a theatre!
Heavens, what do we go there for,
except to see improbabilities? I love
them | I loved the big one and I loved
all the others that only seemed small
by comparison. I loved that loud and
passionate dialogue in the vestibule of
the Royal Box at Covent Garden, partly
conducted in full sight and hearing of
the house, and drowning all the first
Act of Butterfly except theorchestra and
one female soloist. I loved, too, the
spectacle of the foreign prince appear-
ing in full military uniform at afternoon
tea in a London flat. Credo, quia credere
volo is my motto for the theatre, as it
was that of the husband in the last Act
when he was as well aware as I was
that his wife was lying all she know.
But, even if your logical mind resented
this kind of thing, yet her final lie,
and the swift ease of it, ought to have
made amends. Her previous prevari-
cations had been creditable, yet they
might have been achieved, in a tight
corner, by a mere man; but this last,
where she tells him that she had
seen through his disguise all the
time, was a triumph of pure womanly
inspiration. And here the author
cleverly disarms the critics by antici-
pating their view of the improbability
of things. For, in her quality of
actress, she appeals to her husband, as
an actor, with the argument that he
must know too much of the stage to
imagine that such a disguise would not
be easily penetrable. Thus the very
incredibility of what has gone before is

but in the end she was altogether her-

Mr. LoRAINE was admirable in his
assumption of the taint of the stage.
His imitation of Sir CHARLEs WYND-
HAM was no doubt partly unconscious;
but, not only in his adopted rôle of
Russian Prince, where professional
experience was necessarily indicated, but
also in the domestic circle, he con-
sciously suggested the atmosphere of
the theatre. His subtleties, however,
were perhaps a little spoiled by the
author, who now and then played the
part of showman, being over-anxious
lest we should miss the idea."

task of killing time, and Mrs. CALVERT's
delightful gifts were badly wasted on
the third-rate character of a duenna.
I venture to think that the wife's
vague yearnings for some glimpse of
romance—yearnings that find expres-
sºon in the habitual strumming of
Chopin in a half-light (a foible which
naturally irritates her husband)—are
inconsistent with the record of the
many hearts she had captured in her
prenuptial career.
But my real grievance is that we
had to pass one long interval with the
curtain up instead of down. I think
it rash for an author to fix deliberately
by schedule a definite period before
the next feature of interest is due to
OCCur.
Thus for a solid half-hour,
lighting the fire that he was advertised
to “play with,” we waited with our
eyes on the dilatory clock, knowing that
we had to wait, and with nothing to
occupy us except a dull speculation as
to whether the trivialities of the dia-
logue and action had been properly
timed to last out. Otherwise I enjoyed
myself very well indeed—much better
than I did at the Royal Academy.
There (apart from the pictures them-
selves) the trouble is the want of space
between them. Here, at the Comedy,
there was too much wall-paper. But
the pictures, when they did occur, were
always worth while. , O.S
“THE MASTER OF MRs. CHILVERs.”
Mr. Geoffrey Chilvers, M.P., on his
appointment to the post of Under Home
Secretary; decided to seek re-election.
Mr. JERoME K. JEROME thought that
the law required him to do this, but, of
course, Mr. Chilvers knew that he was
accepting a post of profit under the
Home Office and not under the
Crown, and that therefore he did not
need to go before his constituents again.
However, having nothing better to do,
and wishing to celebrate his appoint-
ment in some way, he arranged to
indulge in the luxury of a by-election.
Meanwhile his wife had promised
the Women's Parliamentary Fran-
chise League to contest the next
by-election, a recent decision of the
House of Lords having made it legal
for a woman to be nominated, even
though she would not be allowed to
take her soat. When she finds she is
up against her husband she is naturally
surprised—so is he ; but it is suggested to
them that they are in a position to give
a great examplc to the world of the
way to fight an election—i.e., in love
and sympathy.
However, it turns out that the elec-
tion is fought just in the ordinary way
—i.e., in angcrand bitter::ess. Mrs.
Chilvers gets in by fourteen votes.
Husband and wife are by this time
completely estranged; in fact Geoffrey,
who started out by being President of
the Men's Loague for Extending the
Franchise to Women (M.L.E.F.W.), is
now, to judge from some of his remarks,
a keen anti-Suffragist. ... And then Mrs.
Chilvers tells her husband that she is
going to have a child, an announce-
ment which, if it doesn't settle the Suff-
rage question completely, at any rate
settles it in the Chilvers household.
Mr. JEROME has done a notable
thing. He has written a play upon
a very debatable subject without re-
vealing where his own sympathies
lie. Probably everybody who goes to
the Royalty will come away convinced
ANDRA CARLISLE was extraordinarily while the hero, off the stage, was busy that the author is really on his side.

OUR NEW ANTHOLOGISTS.
AN interview with Mrs. ELLA
WHEELER WILCox, which recently ap-
peared in an evening paper, contains
the following memorable passage:–
“Mr. Sumner has edited “Great Thoughts,'
a birthday book with quotations from my
poems. He read the dictionary through three
times to find out all the most uplifting and
inspiring words, and these words head each
page in alphabetical order, with a verse referring
to it from one of my poems. The idea came to
him while sitting in Trafalgar-square, and in
the book, which will be published in two
months, there is a photograph of the square as
the frontispiece.”
Mr. SUMNER's idea is admirable, but
it is not altogether original, as the
following exclusive information, sup-
plied by our literary expert, will
sufficiently prove.
Mr. Alexander Biffin is engaged on
a volume of Ez-Austin. Eactracts—a
birthday book with quotations from
the poems of the Laureate. By way
of preparation he read through the
Encyclopædia Britannica ten times to
familiarize himself with the whole
range of human knowledge, and the
most stirring subjects head each page in
alphabetical order with an appropriate
couplet from one of the Laureate's
poems. The idea came to Mr. Biffin
while he was travelling in the Tube,
and in the book a photograph of the
interior of a Tube carriage appears as
the frontispiece.
Mr. Raymond Begbie is at work
on a volume with the engaging title of
Great Strokes, being an anthology
of wise, witty and tender sayings
from the works of Mr. Bam Stroker.
As a preliminary to his labour of
selection Mr. Raymond Begbie read
through the volume of the New Ox-
ford Dictionary containing the letter
“B,” thirteen times, in order to find
out all the most soul-satisfying epi-
thets. These epithets—e.g., “bulbous,”
“bountiful,” “burbling"—head each
page in order of intensity, with an
appropriate extract for each day of the
week. The idea came to Mr. Raymond
Begbie while he was lunching with Sir
OLIVER LoDGE, and a photograph of
the cerebellum of the great scientist
decorates the volume as a frontispiece.

MR. PUNCH's SUPPLEMENT.
IV.-RAILWAYS.
THE press of persons expected in the
Metropolis for the Coronation of KING
GEORGE W. and the circumstance that
many of them will be brought thither
in trains has made it a suitable time
for some illuminative remarks on the
railway systems of this country, more
especially as His MAJESTY is himself
an occasional passenger.
CoNDENsed HISTORY OF STEAM.
Steam, which is the vapour given off
by water at certain temperatures, was
first noticed at the Hot Springs in
Colorado by the aboriginal Indians.
Subsequently Sir WALTER RALEIGH,
while engaged in cooking potatoes for
the first time upon a peak in Darien,
noticed that water begins to boil in an
open vessel at 212°F. The next stage
was reached by Sir Isaac WATTs, whose
kettle boiled over while he was writing
“How doth the little busy bee.” From
this stage to the triple-expansion spon-
taneous combustion engine was simple,
once Boy LE's Law had been fully
grasped. The crank will always be
associated with the name of SHAw.
The throttle valve was invented by
Dr. GAROTTE.
MoDERN IMPRoveMENTs.
The first ordinary passenger loco-
motive was constructed by GEORGE
STEPHENSON, an engineer famous for
his remark that if a cow should meet it
on the line it would be “awkward for
the coo.” Since that day—1829—there
have been many improvements in rail-
way travelling, and you may now sit
comfortably in your compartment and
learn how far you are from London by
the information on the boards erected
by pill-makers in the meadows beside
the line.
PERSONNEL.
Promotion is the essence of a rail-
wayman's life. Carriage-cleaners be-
come porters, porters become ticket-
collectors, ticket - collectors become
guards, guards become inspectors, in-
spectors become station - masters,
station-masters become superinten-
dents, superintendents become general
managers, general managers become
very rich and ride free on all other
lines. Porters become rude, if you don't
tip them. Whether porters are paid
by the railway company as well as by
the passengers is a point that has never
been rightly decided. The only person
with courage systematically to oppose
tipping is Sir Joseph LYoNs. All
SMITH's bookstall boys carry in their
baskets the portfolio of a First Lord of
the Admiralty.
HUMoUR.
As a field for an enterprising
humorist there are few places more
profitable than a railway compart-
ment—particularly if he is rich and a
rebel. When tired of the ordinary
amenities of travel, such as looking
out of the windows, whistling, and
staring his fellow-passengers out of
countenance, he may begin to be
original. Taking out his pocket-knife
he may erase the “T” of “Train "
in the sentence “Wait till the train
stops.” He may then place upon
the rack above the opposite seat
bulky articles for which it was
not constructed and watch the effect.
He may throw soda-water and other
bottles out of the window. Finally he
may pull the communication-cord
without sufficient reason, and when the
train stops and the guard arrives hand
him a five-pound note in payment—
that being the priºr fire. Many of our
funniest men have graduated in rail-
way compartments.
A FEW Stray FACTs.
It is not permitted to a passenger
with a third-class ticket to travel in a
first-class compartment, and the officials
of the line display the liveliest emotion
on discovering any one doing this, and
exact from him the difference in fares.
But it is open to any one to travel in a
third-class compartment with a first-
class ticket and no restitution is made
to him.
One way to travel free is under the
seat or clinging to a buffer or in a coal
or cattle truck. A better and more
comfortable way is to wear a good hat
and say “Season" in an authori-
tative and opulent voice.
A return ticket is one which is sold
for both journeys at a slightly reduced
rate, in the hope that the purchaser
will lose the other half. It is illegal
to give or sell the return half to any
one else, but few forms of illegality are
more popular and less unreasonable.
Some English trains are heated,
especially those designed for stock-
brokers and co-respondents on their
way to Brighton. Or else footwarmers
are placed in the compartments by
porters in return for a money payment.
These footwarmers are supplied to the
railway companies free by the amalgam-
ated boot-makers of England, who
reap a splendid profit on their outlay
through the damage done to pas-
sengers' soles.
RAILWAY ELocution.
With the laudable view of carrying
illiterate passengers past their destin-
ation, porters and other officials are
carefully instructed in a system of
voice-production which renders the
names of stations entirely unintel-
ligible.
DISTINGUISHED TRAVELLERs.
Among eminent persons who fre-
quently make use of railway trains are
LORD Esher, JAMSETJI, and Mr.
WILLIAM WILLETT. Miss LILY ELSIE
has occasionally been seen alighting
from a first-class compartment.
Madame CLARA BUTT is very loath to
leave the platform and invariably
warbles a few bars before entering her
compartment or departing from the
station. On these occasions the
engine-whistles are carefully tuned
in the favourite key of the great
vocalist.
THE FUTURE.
Those who watch the signs of the
times realize that, with the competition
of the motor so active, railway com-
panies will sooner or later have to adapt
themselves to new conditions. But
they know also, from their knowledge of
railway companies, that it will be later
rather than sooner. There is no doubt
that trains which may be flagged so as
to stop at cross-roads as well as at
recognized halts and stations will have
to be established, even if it means a
new set of rails for them to run on,
so as not to interfere with express
traffic. Our great great-grandchildren
will perhaps see it done.
Billiard Note.
A correspondent writes, d propos of
our Billiard Supplement: “It may be
of interest to your readers to know that
by the munificence of a patron of the
game who wishes to remain anonymous
a home of rest for ex-champions is now
being built at Grayshott.”
“In printing yesterday the name of one of
the musical comedies, which the Bandmann
Company is presenting next week, as the
Grill In The Train’ what cur compositors
really meant to set was, of course, “The Girl In
the Drain.'”—South China Morning Post.
We are glad to read this correction
What sounded merely tough before

“The celebrated club scene will be a very
special attraction, and the very exceptional
sight of some fifty representatives of the
theatrical profession, one of them a star,
rouped in the club as “supers,” will be

The grouping of forty-nine represen-
tatives of the theatrical profession
round one star has always been a very
popular effect with our actor-managers.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WE are still, perhaps, too near to the actual epoch of
which it treats, for such a book as George Bernard Shaw,
His Life and Works (HURST AND BLACKETT) to have the
right perspective. To the elders amongst us, especially,
many of whom can actually remember BERNARD SHAw in
the flesh, the task of Mr. ARCHIBAL.D HENDERson, the
compiler of this monumental tribute, must appear little
However, he is an American, which no
doubt upheld him. The large and exceedingly handsome
volume which he has produced (at twenty-one shillings
net) deals with its distinguished subject in every variety
of aspect, while managing to remain itself both interesting
and entertaining. Nothing, indeed, but copious quotation,
which space forbids, could do justice to its many-sidedness;
the value of the whole being increased by an unusually
large number of facsimiles and illustrations, amongst
which I greeted with delight “our Mr. E. T. REED's"
inimitable drawing of the Super-Shakspeare. Altogether,
if the last word on a great man had to be said, it could not
have been done better; though I hardly understand why
an Author's Introduction and a Preface should have been
required (perhaps it was force of association that com-
pelled the latter). On the other hand, the chapters headed
“Closing Days,” and “Summary,” usually to be found in
books of this nature, seem unaccountably omitted. This
apart, however, Mr. HENDERSON's volume remains a most
complete, not to say exhaustive, survey, which one cannot
dismiss without reflecting how greatly BERNARD SHAw
himself would have enjoyed reading it.
It was the opinion of the town of Mallingbridge that
“its best business man was a woman,” and that is a
fair estimate of the commercial side of Mrs. Thompson
(HUtchINson). The large emporia of the Provinces are
of two kinds. The one is sedate and old-fashioned, and
the mere fact of being in its windows gives to saleable
goods an air of soundness and durability. Such was
Thompson's. The other relies upon its magnificent exterior
to tempt you to buy articles which you know from the first
to be gimcrack. Such was Thompson's rival over the way.
As long as Mrs. Thompson kept to business, success re-
mained on her side of the street; but it crossed over when,
in spite of her more than middle age, she took to marriage
with a plausible blackguard. In short, the only fault of the
commercial side of her was that it was not the only side,
for out of that alone Mr. W. B. MAXWELL creates a story
entertaining and very true to life, and the nicely contrived
surprise, on which it ends, pleased me none the less because
I ought to have anticipated it all along. But progress
through the matrimonial part was somewhat in the nature
of a wallow; for, though prudery is to-day the one un-
forgivable sin, I yet think there are some intimate details
of sex and physique better not mentioned in polite society
and to be left without regret to the medical text-books.
If the country goes to the dogs, Sir, in the hands of
Radical extremists, it will not, I gather, be Mr. HoRACE
ANNESLEY WACHELL's fault. People who read and admired
The Hill will no doubt remember the struggle between
good and evil friends for the soul of Caesar Desmond. In

was supposed to be working) by means of a shameless
Free Trade leaflet, and finally secured the affections of
John's fiancée, Sheila Desmond. There is much that is
good and much that is clever in Mr. VACHELL's book (in
which I am happy to say that the angels triumph at last);
but we live in a democratic age, and I find his tacit as-
sumption of the importance of gentle birth at times a little
ridiculous. Lucifer, son of the morning, would, I think,
on account of his aristocratic descent have received far
more tolerant treatment from this writer than “Demon"

political situation for the purposes of romance, and only
the accident of being obliged, on his father's death, to
en'er the House of Lords prevented the Demon from
forming a trio with two prominent statesmen whose iden-
tity has not been very laboriously concealed.
Wilson's (CHAPMAN AND HALL) is a public-school story
by DESMOND Coke, which will probably appeal most to
an older generation of school-boys. Mr. CoRE describes
emotions and temperaments with more conviction than he
enjoyment of some vigorous and unconventional scenes,
which form the best part of the tale. Anyhow, what
ensued was a sad blow to some nice but nebulous persons
who had been striving to bring about a happy ending to
the affair. Personally, I was rather pleased; though I
cannot pretend that the fate of Rosanne interested me
to any overwhelming degree, one way or the other. Mr.
GissiNG tells it all very well, however, in an austere style
that I have admired before. I am sorry he does not like
the stage. But it was surely a little gratuitous to bring in
“a famous actor” at the opening simply in order that he
might behave like a cad, and disappear, after one chapter,
amid the scorn of the elect.
Mr. CosMo HAMILTON has given such an air of reality to
the polite scoundrels, male and female, in his book, The
Princess of New York (HUTCHINsoN), that I feel almost
bound in spite of myself to believe that there really are
people in London cultured, titled, and pedigreed, for
whom the police are only waiting until they take just
one more false step. The nice people in this story of a

school. Unfortunately, this theme is old, as readers of Hugh
Rendal will remember; but, whereas in that book Hugh had
the difficult job of ruling a rebellious house by the force of
authority alone, in this book Dick had the advantage of a
personal strength which had nothing to fear from anybody.
In this way Mr. Coke makes things easier for Hunter, but
even so he gives us an interesting picture of his hero
at work, and an excellent study of the house-master's
detachment.
What prevented me from enjoying Rosanne (F. W. WHITE)
so much as I might otherwise have done, was the behaviour
of the central character, who gives her name to Mr. ALGER-
NoN GissiNg's latest novel. This was such that in spite, or
perhaps because of, the real skill with which she was
presented, I could only regard her with impatient irritation.
In the first chapter, Henley St. Cloe, her husband, announces
dramatically at dinner that he is a ruined man, and inci-
dentally that he is more than fed up with Rosanne.
Accordingly he goes to America, which I was sorry for,
as, before we had gone much fuzºuer, I should have liked
to grasp his hand in cordial agreement. Rosanne, left to
herself, becomes a kind of novice in an Anglican sisterhood;
till ten years later, when St. Cloe returns with a fortune,
and she-but to tell you, more would be to spoil your

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
[MAY 17, 1911.
a TRAGEDY of THE Tube.
IN RHYMED PROSE.
LISTEN, fair ladies, while I tell
The sad occurrence which befell
A junior of the Scottish Bar,
The bonnie Sandy Lochinvar.
It was his firm and stout intent
To carry off, with her consent,
That lovely creature, Ruby Warner,
Whose town address was Hyde Park
Corner. -
Both of her parents lived there too,
Sir Dyke and Lady W.,
And had their own peculiar plan
To make her wed another man,
Namely, Sir Obadiah Doyle
Whose speciality was Oil.
(He was to come and woo and win her
That very evening after dinner).
But she, who loathed this fatted swain,
Proposed to travel North by train–
11.30 G.N.R.—
With her belovéd Lochinvar,
And wed in Edinburgh Toun
On the ensuing afternoon.
In Hertford Street a plain but handy
Lodging had been secured by Sandy,
A most convenient situation,
Near to his love and Down Street
station.
At 7.45, exact
(The hour was fixed by solemn pact),
He was to come and fetch Miss Warner
From her address at Hyde Park Corner,
And bear her off, for time was pressing,
Just as the family was dressing.
The stroke of 7.30 found
Our hero on the underground.
Alas! he should have sought his Rube
By taxicab and not by tube
(I fear he shirked the driver's fee
From motives of economy,
A habit which, I hear, is not
Unusual in a bonnie Scot).
I would he had not gone below !
But how should he, a stianger, know,
How guess what curious things go on
In subterranean Babylon 2
Descending after some delay,
He saw the first train pass away.
The second (this was bitter gall)
Rushed by and never stopped at all.
The third (he took it) went and tore
Through Hyde Park Corner with a roar.
At Knightsbridge he alighted from it,
Panted across and, like a comet,
An Eastward train went flashing
through,
Sucking his hat off up the flue.
The next ignored his destination
And ran right on to Down Street
station,
Where he debouched and crossed apace
To what had been his starting-place.
l—
And lo! a notice caught his sight
That told him in electric light
Which of the trains proposed to miss
Which of his stations, that or this.
And there—for on the silly board
Only the next event was scored,
But of the further trains to come
The thing was absolutely dumb–
He watched the alternating text,
Thinking “The next l—the next |!—
the next | | | "
Growing forlorn and yet forlorner,
Waiting, the while his heart went flop,
For one that should consent to stop
At Down Street and at Hyde Park
Corner;
Till he concluded, red with wroth,
That nothing ever stopped at both.
I cannot say how long he sat
Without a smile, without a hat;
But finally he felt aware
Of a desire for change of air,
To see once more the natural light
Before his head was wholly white
(It must have been about midnight).
So toward the regions of the sun
(Though for that day its course was
done)
Wearily he began to drift,
And fainted halfway up the liſt.
But what of poor Miss Ruby Warner,
Waiting her love at Hyde Park Corner,
Wishing her Ma had never borne her ?
Dinner at eight o'clock was served
And she must eat it, all unnerved,
Letting her wild thoughts wander far
After the absent Lochinvar.
By 10.15 she lost all hope
Touching his promise to elope,
And in a pique became betrothed
To him that in her heart she loathed,
Namely, Sir Obadiah Doyle,
Whose speciality was Oil.
And thus her Sandy she forswore,
Who, true to her in every pore,
Still hung about the tubal bore,
Growing forlorn and yet forlorner,
Trying to get to Hyde Park Corner.
O. S.
MR. PUNCH'S ACADEMY NOTES.
(In humble imitation of some of his
Contemporaries.)
Room 19 is dominated by Mr.
Mandragora's “Interior of my Cash-
box.” As a tour de force of pigmentary
ululation this poignant cri de couleur
of numismatic negation has been un-
equalled since CRISTIPPo Di FIRENzE's
“Last Grain of Arsenic in the Borgia
Larder.” Perserk in ruthless realism,
yet almost bleating with pathos, this
enormous canvas is obsessed by stark
DANTE-like lacunae of emptiness. The
brush has succeeded in painting a
vacuum !
It is a pity that the sombre deso-
lazione of this chef-d'oeuvre should be
mocked by the juxtaposition of Mr.
Guy Dalliance's “Drawing-room Clock
at Dawn,” with its smirk of bourgeois
villeggiatura.
It is a relief to turn to Mr.
Corporal's appalling “Portrait of the
Mayor of Brillington"—more merciless
in its elephantiasis than the hallu-
cinations of a convex mirror. The
artist has depicted his sitter with
remorseless brutalitā; and, despite
the bravura of fur overcoat and the
insignia of office, one recoils from the
canvas in ecstatic repulsion.
Almost equally masterly in its
splendid spleen against the subject
is Mr. Abb Smith's “Mrs. Iky
Naselbein.” With amazing insight
he unveils the inmost malignancy of
his sitter's mind, while satisfying con-
vention with a deafening pasticcio of
her famous gems. Almost diabolic in
audacity is the suggestion of the
family skeleton in the cupboard
behind the sitter.
Of opposite attraction is Mr. Bishop
Park's delicate and capricious pastoral,
“Motor Buses in Putney High Street”
—a veritable danse des nymphes 1
Mr. Park is as dexterous in the
glutinous chiaroscuro of the pave-
ment as in his reticent nuances of over-
lubrication, or the Puck-like bragga-
docio of the side-slip. Gazing with
dimming eyes on this elfin and charming
idyll, one thinks of that rapt apostrophe
of KEATs, “Little town, thy streets for
evermore will silent be.”
The Committee, with their usual
brutal ophthalmia, have “skied" Mr.
Lorenzo Chalfont's infinitely tender
“Booking Hall at Snow Hill Station";
and similarly ill - treated is Miss
Pantile's courageous “Cinematograph
Audience.” This suggestive little can-
was is a miracle of restraint. The
artist with almost spanielesque fidelity
has painted only an oblong of ebony
black.
The cynosure of Room 20 is Mr.
Stipple's “Form IV. at the Vicarage."
Loath as we are to commend humanity
in Art, it is impossible to deny the
rugged and cyclopean simpatica of
this work. It will be the popular clou
of the Exhibition.
The scena is the breakfast-room of
a country vicarage. The vicar has just
opened the envelope, and his apoplessia
is superbly dynamic. Mr. Stipple, in
fact, has succeeded in visualising an
expletive' We are yet more impressed
by the exquisite technique of the over-
turned cafetière, and the consummate
restraint of the parrot in the back-
ground. -

WALL STREET.
REMBRANDTs spurted a point yester-
day afternoon, on rumours that “The
Mill” had changed hands at $600,000;
a cargo of three hundred tons of fresh
old masters is expected from Europe.
The “Duchess of Milan "is quoted at
$250,000 taken and offered. CoRots
sagged, and TURNERs were banged
heavily by the bears. VELASQUEZEs
jumped instantly on London buying,
and were healthy and strong on the
wing all day.
MSS. of HANDEL's sacred works
drooped to nothing, first editions of
STRAUss and WAGNER feverish, BEET-
HoveNs Ordinary dull, MENDELssoHNs
A nervy.
Paradise Losts crumbled, but
Hamlets and Othellos boomed on
fresh wires from the Shakspeare
Exploration Syndicate, whose mining
expert reported having struck a new
reef of code first editions. These last
ran up hurriedly on the rumour that Mr.
PIERPoNT MoRGAN was getting together
a complete collection of the bard's
works regardless of expense, and any
refuse having any resemblance to an
old copy was worked off on outsiders
at enhanced figures.
Money MARKET,
Money was scarce all morning, and
several day-to-day loans were negoti-
ated by prominent artists and actors.
Gold was in a very sluggish circulation
in the Royal Academy department,
being more plentiful for forward de-
livery than for spot cash. A good deal
of bar silver changed hands in the
refreshment section.
Stock Exchange.
Authors were more optimistic, the
literary market being roused to some
extent from its lethargy by a perusal of
the new Copyright Bill. Dramatists
were dull and devoid of interest—
especially in the musical comedy
section—and towards nightfall showed
an irregular tendency. A large consign-
ment of plots for dramas and novels
arrived from Paris and Vienna.
In Musicians there was nothing doing.
Owing to the near approach of quarter-
day, overnight accommodation was
largely in request among Sculptors and
Painters for the settlement, and in
many instances landlords' and trades-
men's bills were carried over at an
increased rate. The only strong
feature was the boom in GREAVESEs

An expert in handwriting will be
retained to forge signatures, and piracy
(musical and literary) will be con-
ducted by a competent adviser in the

The manufacture of Strad violins will
which also had the effect of attracting be commenced on a wholesale scale.
A profitable income is also expected
from the stuffing of modern busts with

been entered into for a large supply of
lichen and mildew.

paid on all applications bearing an

Do you observe that every time you eye
With pulsing orbs, and breathing quick and choky,
Yon fatal sphere, the mental strife

Which means, my Reginald, that you will die
Sooner by years than if you stuck to croquet.
Well, we must alter; but I doubt we can.
'Tis hard to putt without procrastination,
Without a shaking in the shoes;
Which makes it clear that we must choose
Between curtailing our appointed span

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TOPIC OF THE NIGHT.
“ARE you going to the Coronation?”
asked my first partner as we rested
after our exertions.
“Yes,” I said, after thinking it out
carefully. “Yes. . Are you?”
I added, making a great effort to keep
the ball rolling.
“Yes.”
Sometimes at dances I get very tired,
and can't think of anything to say.
It was not so on this occasion.
“Have you got your seats yet 2" I
asked.
“Yes. Father got them to-day.”
I rose to the cocasion brilliantly.
“Where are they 2” I asked.
“Outside St. Margaret's.”
“Oh, yes. I expect you'll see it
all from there.”
“I expect so.”
There was nothing more to be said:
| and in a little while I was dancing
with my second partner. As soon as
we were seated we turned to each other
and asked:
“Are you going to the Coronation?”
“After you,” I said, with a bow.
“I was just wondering if you were
going to the Coronation.”
“Well, I'm not quite sure yet.
Are you ?”
“Oh, rather. We've got our seats.”
“I was just going to ask you if you
had. Where are they 2”
“Outside St. Margaret's.”
I looked at her anxiously for a
moment.
“Did you dance with me just now?”
I asked.
“No,” she said in surprise. “I
don't think I've ever danced with you
before.”
“You would remember—I mean I
should remember if you had, of course.
But the fact is there's somebody here
who talks just like you.”
“Really 2” she said with interest;
and so I drifted on to my next partner.
This time I waited for her to begin.
“I suppose you're going to the Coro-
nation ?” she asked.
“The Coronation?" I repeated doubt-
fully to myself; “the Coronation ? Oh,
that's the little thing they're doing at
the Abbey next month, isn't it? No, I
don't think I shall go.”
“Oh, but why not?”
“I never go to Coronations.”
“We’ve got seats outside St. Mar-
garet's,” she volunteered.
“The whole parish is here to-night,”
I murmured to myself.
“What did you say?”
“I said it would be much cooler
inside St. Margaret's.”
“But then you wouldn't see the
procession.”
“True,” I admitted. “There's al-
ways that. It's simply a question of
which you prefer.”
“I suppose so,” she said doubtfully.
My fourth partner skipped the
opening exchanges altogether and
asked me point-blank if I had got my
seats yet.
“Rather,” I said.
St. Margaret's.”
“Ours are outside St. Clement’s.”
I nearly dropped the lemonade—we
were in the lemonade room—as I
looked at her.
“I believe you've been done,” I said
at last. “What makes you think
they're having a coronation there 2"
“Well, they're putting up seats,
anyhow.”
“Oh, well, I suppose they know.
But you've come on the wrong night,
I'm afraid. Only the St. Margaret's
people are here this evening.”
However, I must have been wrong
about that, for my next three partners
had got seats in Piccadilly, Whitehall
and Piccadilly respectively. (I suppose
I must have struck a family of sisters
at the start—that's how it was.) The
Whitehall member was the most in-
teresting of them, and when we had
exhausted the subject of the Coronation
agreed with me that it would not be
very long before we were all of us
going about in aeroplanes. And she
was nice enough to think that it was
very brave of me to say that I should
like to go up in one now.
When I got to my fifteenth and last
partner, St. Margaret's and Piccadilly
were leading at five-all, and the casting
vote might rest with her.
“I suppose,” I began—
“No,” she said, “I’m not.”
“We ought to have met before,” I
said warmly. “They've been talking
to you, too.”
“They have.”
“Well, I shouldn't have begun it, if
I hadn't thought you'd have begun it
if I hadn't. Is that clear, or shall I
say it backwards?”
“Oh, do say it backwards.”
“Perhaps it would be too exciting
for you at this time of night. May I
ask you just one question instead 2"
“If it isn't about—you know.”
“It isn't about that at all. It's
simply to settle a little bet I've got on.
Er—if you were in London on a hot
day in June and you wanted to sit
down, would you do it outside St. Mar-
garet's or outside Piccadilly 2”
“Neither,” she said.
So that's how it is.

CoME out, my BEACH ! come out and
teach,
Beyond the traffic's tight jar;
Come out amid the fields and herds,
And tell us all the names of birds,
And what is who, and which is each,
And whether that's a night-jar.
I'll say, “Hark, harkſ there goes the
lark' "
And you shall murmur, “Not it;
That was an owl, unless I err,
There is a spotted fly-catcher!!”
“Is it?” shall be my awed remark,
“I somehow failed to spot it.”
Then up shall float the rapturous note
Of cuckoos in the covers,
And, faring on by field and fen,
We'll find the titmouse in his den,
And cull from aspic trees remote
The mottled eggs of plovers.
You shall prolong the bittern's song
And burble to the wryneck; |
The jay, the cushat, and the pye
Shall tell us little tales, and 1
Shall all the time be going strong
Out of the back of my neck.
Thus all the lore I've learnt before,
But could not rightly follow,
I'll quaff beside the fountain-head

I do so want to hear some more
About the dear old swallow). |

“Her head was crowned in gold and her
small figure draped in a deeper shade of glue—a

This was the appropriate costume of
the Be-gum of BHoPAI, when she was
presented to the KING (as PRINCE of

the Coronation.

A cheap way of producing it, however,
and, besides, electric light is much less
dangerous than gas.

TEIE LITTLE TOWNS.
PUDSEY.
[After Mr. HILAIRE Belloc.]
MEN have invariably two sets of
affections and two anchoring grounds.
Thus in a man's life his mother and
his M.P.; on another plane his public-
house and his church ; on another his
wanderings and his memories; and on
another the great mountains and the
little towns. -
The little town that means so much
to me is Pudsey, in the heart of York-
shire. It is the strategic centre of
England. It lies like a lion couchant
between Leeds and Bradford. Who
holds Pudsey controls those two great
cities and has sway over the North
Road between London and Edinburgh.
No stately cathedral towers over the
little town. No citadel holds it in
thrall. It is just a little town. But
it has bread, and yellow beer, and
faith; and thus Pudsey, the unknown,
the Lhassa of Yorkshire, is dear beyond
wo: ds to me.
The drums and tramplings of three
conquests have left Pudsey untouched.
The Middle Ages changed it not a whit.
The Victorian Age besmoked it but left
no mark on its spiritual atmosphere.
To-day it stands, dour and dogged,
glowering on its neighbour Morley,
which gave a so-called Radical Premier
to England. But when the great day
comes and the battle is formed Pud-
sey will give the lead to England, and
the tricky sham-fighters of modern
politics will cower before the stern
arbitrament of Pudsey's sword.
The little town of Pudsey gives as
much pleasure as may be given by that
delightful sense of observation which
you get in the eyes of the old when
their lives have been well lived. The
town of Pudsey does not die as men
die. It stands in grey immortality. It
has old grey-stone hostelries at . its
corners, where stern men grip their
tankards firmly with a cautious eye
on their neighbours. The Leeds trams
clang through its streets, yet Pudsey
deigns no answer to their clamour. Its
gas-works swell out magnificently
and dominate it as Windsor's castle
dominates the royal borough.
I wish that human life might last for
ever that I might continue year after
year to get down at the simple station
and see the simple sights and hear the
simple sounds that memory renders
inexpressibly dear to me. The stern,
judicial “Gud meet" of the policeman
on night patrol; the cheerful “’Ere's
luck” of the masterful Yorkshire
drinkers ; the thrill that one ex-
periences when the lamplighter issues
forth and when the sweep comes
home. To revisit this little town
perpetually, and renew my loves with
it, I could wish that human life
stretched on for ever.
There are other towns that tug at
my heart-strings; Moses Gate, the nerve
centre of busy Lancashire; Tonypandy,
which but awaits its Danton to make a
revolution; and Burton, dear Burton,
from which the malt-life of England
steadily pulsates; but I come back ever
to Pudsey.
It has bread, and yellow beer, and
faith. It is my little town.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Monday.—Odd thing
happened just now. House crowded
to hear LANSDown E explain his Reform
Bill. A garland of Peeresses wreathed
the side galleries, on this occasion
specially reserved for their ladyships'
accommodation. On steps of throne
Privy Councillors jostled each other for
front places. Everyone glad to see
LANSDown E back in renewed health.
Noble Lords displayed generous emo-
tion by a murmured cheer.
Lucid explanation of revolu-
|CHANCELLoR being a little worried of
late, sudden recognition of Chairman
of Medway Liberal Association was
sufficient to upset ordinarily well-
guarded, almost phlegmatic equani-
mity.
Business done.—LANSDowNE intro-
|duces Bill designed to exterminate the
loyal Backwoodsman.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—John
WARD rather to the front just now.
Pink of loyalty, he has bought him-
self a new felt hat in honour of the
Coronation. Compared with the head-
|. under which he earned earliest
iniquitous chucking-away of chances in
the race with Germany for predo-
minence of Naval power, McKENNA
quietly added “The 9th of April was
a Sunday.”
John had got hold of the wrong end
of the stick, or, to bring the imagery
nearer home, had put on his hat back
to front.
Undismayed by this accident he
turned up to-day with a new word for
addition to the English language.
Asked UNDER-SECRETARY For INDIA
whether it is proposed to alter the law
relating to the payment of wages due

tionary measure occupied hour
and a half. It was on LEADER
of OPPosition resuming his seat
that, as WILLIAM BLACK used
occasionally to remark in
strangely forgotten novels, “Lo!
a strange thing happened.”
LoRD CHANCELLOR put the
question “That this Bill be read
a second time.” In this storied
chamber exclamation regarded
as bad form. But Noble Lords
so taken aback at this strange
slip that amid general movement
there were correcting cries of
“First reading.”
CHANCELLOR, hurriedly rising
again, amended the error, and
way cleared for Lord MoRLEY,
who declared against the
measure in uncompromising
tone and manner that recalled
LANSDown E's treatment of Old-
Age Pensions Scheme when it
came along after PRINCE ARTHUR
in the Commons had publicly
washed his hands of responsi-
bility in the matter.

ence of Commoners, explains an

To-day they have come

lation.” Not a pretty word
“victimisation,” but well enough
for a beginner.
Guillotine merrily at work
chopping off amendments to
Report stage of Parliament Bill.
This to be concluded to-morrow
night, to which end the hours
are parcelled out, and on the
stroke down drops the ruthless
blade. As the amendments are
old acquaintances, made familiar
in Committeo, without tho
slightest chance of being ac-
cepted on second time of asking,
no serious harm is done. Still
it is a stupid performance, in-
volving loss of two sittings.
At one moment clamorous
storm burst round the ethereal
form of Cousin HUGH. According
to time-table, guillotine blade
due to fall at half-past four.
At 4.28 Cousin HUGH interposed;
received with shout of angry
remonstrance from Radical quar-
ter. HUGH always ready for
fight. If any trail their coat
before him, be sure he'll tread
on it. Ministers had declined to
enter upon detailed discussion
incident that occasioned much remark.
Just as CHANCELLOR was rising to put
question his eye fell upon WALTER
McLAREN amid group of M.P.'s below
the Bar. It is a matter of common
report that WALTER has volunteered to
“see the Lord CHANCELLOR" about
constitution of Malling bench of magis-
trates, which, consisting of fifteen
Conservatives at time of LOREBURN's
accession to office, has since been
strengthened by addition of seven
members of whom the odd half-dozen
are Tories.
Of course there is nothing terrific in
prospect of the interview. None of

he is the mildest-mannered man that

shade lighter and a furlong or so less
ample in dimensions. Not so deep as
a well nor so wide as a church door, it
will, like Mercutio’s wound, serve.
Yesterday JoHN created some sensa-
tion by drawing statement from FIRST
LORD of THE ADMIRALTY in reply to ques-
tion as to how many men were employed
in one of the dockyards on the 9th of
April, and how many hours each one
worked ? It turned out that there
were no men in the dockyard on the
date named, nor was a stroke of work
done. Whilst House gasped at state
of things here revealed and guardians
of the Navy moored behind Front Op-
position Bench half rose to denounce
of amendments on ground that
they had already been debated in
Committee. “Yah!” cried Cousin
HUGH, wringing his hands in anguish
over such evidence of human depravity,
“you don't answer our arguments
because you can't.”
Here the Radicals broke in with
prolonged burst of groans and jeers.
Cousin HUGH raised his voice almost
to screaming pitch in vain effort to
shout down the enemy. Happily, clock
interposed with stroke of half-hour,
and Members went forth to vote on
proposed new clause.
Business done.—Clause 1 of Parlia-
ment Bill passed Report stage without
amendment.

HUMOL is prepared by a

plant — a member of the
Smilax family and a native
of Chihuahua. It is made
up in the form of a hair-
wash, and on being well
rubbed into the head dis-
plays at once its remarkable
properties. It may also be
used as an embrocation for
the ribs, to which it affords
a pleasant tickling sensa-
tion. Its effect is amazing
and instantaneous. Not
only does it render the mind
susceptible to every wave
of humorous emotion tuat
passes through the air, but
it sets similar waves in
progress from the seat of
its own action. Thus it
entirely alters the perspec-
tive of things. The so-
called worries of life become
a source of exquisite enter-
tainment. You smile at
the importunities of the
income-tax collector; you
chuckle at the advent of
spring-cleaning; you laugh
aloud when your partner
revokes; you roar with full-
bodied (or nearly full-bodied)
mirth at your own sea-sickness.
Why waste money on expensive and
conventional “amusements”? Why
not halve your expenditure and double
your life? A day in Brixton is funny
enough if you use HUMOL.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
No. 3.-A SALE AT CHRISTIE'S.
BY A NoDDE LORD.
THE other day, a friend took me to
a picture sale. How and where these
ſunctions were conducted I had till then
no notion. That pictures changed hands
1 had heard; and indeed they must do
so, or how could my ancestors have
brought together the superb collections
which I understand I possess? Now,
however, that I have witnessed a pic-
ture sale and seen what can be done
in that direction I shall keep a much
sharper eye on the course of events.
Arrived at the auction-room, we
found a large number of men gathered
together, either seated or standing,
bidding for the pictures that were dis-
played, one by one, in turn, by the
porters. At a little raised desk, called,
I am told, a rostrum, sat the auc-
tioneer, and below him were his clerks.
Occasionally smiling gentlemen, whom
I took to be the Christie Minstrels,
stood there too, evidently not displeased
at the figures that were being realised.
For it was what is called an important
sale, and a large number of very
valuable pictures were being sold,
dealers from all over the world being
present. From the general cast of
feature I should say that, if Mr. ZANG-
will's scheme of returning with his
people to Palestine ever became prac-
tical, he could not do better than make
a start at CHRISTIE's during an im-
portant sale—that is, of course, pro-
vided they were willing to go.
I noticed, too, that although the
auctioneer was extremely quick in
taking bids it was practically impossible
for an outsider to see from which of
the company it proceeded—some kind
of marconigraph being evidently in use.
Buying pictures is not my line, so
this did not trouble me; but I won-
dered how I should have to go to work
to get my bid recorded supposing
that kind of folly ever did take hold
of me.
As picture after picture was sold
my friend, who knows the ins and outs
of this mystery, groaned more and
more deeply. “What is it?” I kept
asking. “Only that that German fellow
has got that,” he would say. Or,
“Another beauty gone to a Dutch-
man.” Or, “That 's the third Wan
Dyck that the Americans have se-
cured.” And so on—always naming
some foreign purchaser. “But how
is it,” I said at last, “that some one
representing the National Gallery is
not here buying for England 2’’ “Be-
cause they haven't any money,” he
snapped out. “No money?” said I.

THE SAD GASE of. THE FATHER
OF PELLEAS.
For me, he is far the most intriguing
figure in M. MAETERLINck's tragedy of
Pelléas and Mélisande. There he was
half the time lying ill in that dour castle
with its dark woods, where the sky was
never to be seen except in summer
(that was funny, too, for you might
have thought there would be moreleaves
to hide it then), and people went on
getting paler and paler and letting their
hair fall out of windows, and throwing
their rings into wells, and telling lies,
and crying, and complaining that it
was very dark, and that they were very
unhappy . about him, though), and
keeping their eyes wide open (except
when they were fast asleep), and saying
they were going away, and not going,
and nobody took the slightest notice of
the poor invalid.
It is true that Pelléas did say he had
been to see him; but no one saw him go.
It is tiue, too, that the old grandfather
(but not before the Fourth Act) said
that the whole household had been
doing nothing all this time except
“chuchotant autour d'une chambre
fermée" where the patient lay; but no
one hoard their whispers. And we were
never shown his room, inside or outside.
The only proof we have (and a poor
one too) that his illness made any
difference to any one was that, when
he was out of danger the house woke
up a little and one or two rather sudden
deaths ensued ; but I think this must
have happened anyhow, for people
can't go on for ever being very un-
happy in the dark without something
coming of it. And, when allis said, we
never once set eyes on him—never even
had the poor solace of seeing his name
in the play-bill. Truly a tragic figure
in its isolation
As for M. DEBUssy's setting of the
play let us, in imagination, hear what
M. MAETERLINCK has to say about it.
M. MAETERLINck: It is not your
fault. No, no, little DEBUssy; it is
not your fault. My Mélisande began
weeping when she was one minute old.
She was weeping when you first met
her, little DEBUssy. I do not know
why she was weeping, Nobody knows
why she was weeping. She had just
thrown a gold crown into a well. But
that was not the reason. It was a
habit with her to throw jewellery into
wells. I think she must have been
very unhappy. Yes, that was it; she
was very unhappy. And so your
music is sad and sombre. Your music
is sad and sombre from the very
beginning, little DEBUssy. And when
the two tragic destinies are fulfilled at
the end you have nothing new to say.
You have said everything thirty-five
scenes ago, and have been saying it
ever since. They were beautiful scenes,
but they began a long time ago. There
was nothing more for you to say.
My play is not a gay play, little
DEBUssy. And it does not abound in
strong and vivid contrasts. And that
is why your music is not gay. That is
why your music does not abound in
strong and vivid contrasts. It is not
your fault, little DEBUssy. I said just
now it was not your fault.
But I liked your music. Oh, yes, I
liked it, little DEBUssy. I liked it when
you frightened me in the scene where
R- T
LE SHAMPOO.
Pelléas (M. WARNERY): “Tu entends mes
baisers le long de tes cheveux Ils montent
le long detes cheveux."
Mélisande (MME. Edvis A): “Oh oh! tu
m'as fait mal."
Golaud kills his brother from behind.
You frightened me with the noise that
the castle doors made when they were
being bolted for the night. I did not
know that bolts could make so terrifying
a. In Olse.
Madame EDVINA was not quite my
idea of Mélisande. Nobody was quite
my idea of anybody, except, perhaps,
Signor MARcoux, as Arkel, and Mlle.
Bourgeois as Geneviève. They just
had to be old, and they did that. One
would think that M. GHASNE forgot
who Golaud was. He forgot that
Golaud was still young enough to be a
sportsman and fall in love at sight with
a pretty girl crying in a wood. He
forgot that ; or perhaps I forgot it for
him. Perhaps it was my fault that
Golaud was so repellent. One would
say that he was almost like a kind of
Golaudwog. You do not mind my
making that little joke, DEBUssy 2 I
do not often make little jokes. I do
not often make any sort of joke.
M. WARNERY never looked a bit like
my Pelléas. He never looked as if he
were worried about the obverse of his
destiny. He might have been almost
anything in any other French opera.
And his wig'ſ Oh, oh, he made me very
unhappy.
Do you know, I have a horrid doubt
in my inside 2 Have you ever had a
horrid doubt in your inside, little DE-
BUssy 2 I will tell you what my doubt
is. I am beginning to wonder if French
is, after all, the right language for ro-
mantic tragedy. It is so precise. It
says things so dreadfully clearly. It has
no atmosphere of suggestion, especially
when it is sung. Oh, oh, it makes me
very unhappy. O. S.
THE CALLER.
Miss Muse, since you have made so
free
As thus to risk a call on me
Here in Throgmorton Street, E.C.,
The grim, the glaring,
How is it that you come to be
So rather daring?
You're welcome in a fitter sphere—
The long, white road, the hills of deer,
Great woodlands when the mellow year
To Autumn changes,
Or stretched beside some shady weir
'Neath Cumnor's ranges—
(Not that you lack an urban grace,
I love you when you bid me trace
Youth's springtide in a girlish face,
A Bond Street setting;
They didn't grow such nymphs
Thrace,
That's certain betting!)—
But in the City—well, there's this:
Come out and see its mysteries—
The jewelled jobber sleeked with fizz,
And stuffed with salmon;
How beautiful a broker is,
How chaste looks Mammon I
So, ere you join the other Eight,
Your sisters, at the Sun-god's gate,
You'll leave me of your blossom-freight
Some songful guerdon,
To mingle with the market rate
A brown bee burden I
Commercial Candour.
From an advt. in Public Opinion of a
Physical Culture school:—
“The Devils of Insomnia, Nervous De-
pression, Indigestion, and a dozen others of the
Infernal Brotherhood are exercised every day.”

WHAT OUR ARTIST'S FRIENDS HAVE TO PUT UP WITH.
Extract from letter. “In a moment of foolish generosity I undertook to pose in Jack's studio as a comic Scot; and in the middle who
should his silly wife bring in but Violet and her Mother? I had long been anxious to make an impression on Violet and now I've
succeeded.”
THE INGRATITUDE OF EDWIN.
[The new guides are busy at the British Museum. Efforts are being
made to discover how far the experiment is being appreciated.]
Edwin, on many a showery afternoon,
When Hampstead Heath was much too damp to sit on,
With Angelina you've been known to moon
Through wonder-halls, the pride of every Briton,
And there, among the world's first treasures tarrying,
Discourse of walnut suites, of maisonettes, and marrying.
The kind Authorities it much distressed
To see you so irrelevantly wandering,
Oblivious both of script and palimpsest,
And other things o'er which the wise stand pondering;
And now they mean, by tactful ministrations,
To fructify your ignorant perambulations.
A grave curator, spectacled and bland,
Shall, for the future, with compassion heed you,
And intervening give to each a hand,
And gently to the manuscript room lead you,
And, sojourning before the show-case, start a
Profound discourse, let's say, on England's Magna Carta.
Then, resting in the nook which, all unseen,
For confidential friendship well suffices,
This learned person, seated in between,
Shall talk to you of Ammun Ra and Isis,
While still the smile (you never could abide her)
Upon the face of Pasht, the pussy-god, grows wider.
Thus spoke I, giving Edwin and his maid
A sketch of how philanthropy was seeking
To render to his ignorance first aid;
But, credit me ! before I'd finished speaking
(One may too much solicitude by half show)
They'd passed away into—a Cinematograph Show!
The growing popularity of aeroplanes is having a startling
effect on the bicycle trade. “Now is the time,” says a
Dundee paper, “to buy a bicycle. If you want a good second-
hand one, advertise for it in the ‘Courier.' It will only
cost you sixpence, and you will probably get a wide choice.”
“Broken china may be mended by brushing the edges with white
lead, such as painters use; press the pieces together and tie them in
place, then leave them two or three days until thoroughly dry. The
dish can be broken as easily anywhere else as at the old break.”
Transvaal Leader.
Still a break in a new place is never quite so satisfactory.
“Notice.—F. B. is the only one in all the world who can turn straight
hair into natural waves on the head without injuring the hair or scalp,
and will last for ever, from 2gs.”—The Queen.
A very lonely immortality for F. B.
“Specimen bush plants, eventually to be 3 feet or more high, should
have different treatment. Stop the plants at 6 inches, and continue
to do so until the desired size is attained."—The Garden.
It sounds hopeless.

MR. PUNCH'S SUPPLEMENT.
W.—CITY CoMPANIEs.
THERE are few London institutions
more interesting to strangers than our
ancient City Companies, and few about
which so little is accurately known.
Since the metropolis promises to be
heavily invaded by American and other
foreigners during the coming summer,
for a function that shall not be named,
and since all are then likely to ask
questions about the City Companies,
the following timely account has been
drawn up and vouched for by experts
of unimpeachable veracity —
History.
The oldest City Company is probably
that of the Hide-bounders, the founda-
tion of which is attributed to JULIUS
CESAR, who, during his stay in Britain,
always dined with them on the Hides of
March. The Gum-boilers, again, date
back to the Roman occupation, the
first Prime Warden being a native of
Tusculum and a descendant of CURIUs
DENTATUs. The Gin - slingers came
from the Balearic Isles, where they
own extensive plantations of juniper to
this day; and the Coal-scuttlers are
the lineal descendants of some Barbary
Corsairs, who were captured by Cap-
tain Coke.
WEALTH.
The wealth of the City Companies is
a byword. So vast is it that there is
the greatest difficulty in disposing of
it. The ordinary channels of charity
are often congested, and the Companies
are bound in self-defence to indulge
freely in banquets, at which not only
are food and drink consumed, but pre-
sents are distributed. A visitor to a
City Company dinner is disappointed
if he does not find a gold cigar-case or
black pearl pin under his plate, while
ladies are rarely permitted to leave
without tiaras or sables. Many a
visitor has also come away with a
diamond pain beneath his waistcoat,
the food being not less rich and
generous than the Company.
THE HALLs.
The City Companies pride themselves
exceedingly upon their Halls, which
are usually buried in the very heart of
the City, so that it is advisable for any
one who is bidden to a feast to allow at
least an hour extra for losing and finding
the way. Once found, however, the
Halls turn out to be fine examples of
mediaeval architecture, and hospitality
reigns in every one. At the entrance
door a yard of ale is proffered to every
visitor, and he is expected to drink it.
He must then give up his hat and coat,
receiving in exchange a ticket of pure
gold, which he is asked to retain as a
souvenir. On being presented to the
Worshipful Master he must join him
in a second yard of ale, and then all is
ready for dinner.
TURTLEs.
The life-blood of a City Company, it
has been well said, is turtle soup; and
since real turtle soup can be made only
from the real turtle it follows that a
considerable traffic is carried on in this
unwieldy but toothsome creature. The
turtle most dear to the City Companies'
palate is the green turtle, which yields
the succulent calipash and calipee—
calipash being the green fat of the upper
shell, and calipee the yellow meat of
the lower. Lumps of these delicacies
'swim about in the soup and give extra-
ordinary contentment to the consumer,
whether he be Worshipful Master or a
mere literary guest. The green turtle
comes from the coast of South America
and is brought here alive in tanks. Each
City Company has its own aquarium
for turtles and keeps an official execu-
tioner, who has a fee of fifteen shillings,
dating from immemorial times, for
every one killed—also the shells as per-
quisites, from which the more ingenious
ones carve combs for their wives and
daughters and paper-knives for their
sons. In 1743, it is told that one
Simon Fergus, turtle-executioner to the
Worshipſul Company of Razor-strop-
pers, on being discovered substituting
mock turtle from the Caroline Islands
for the real thing, was deprived of his
office and set in the pillory. And
quite right too.
ETIQUETTE.
The City Companies are sticklers for
routine. No one may seat himself
before the Worshipful Masters and
none may eat until grace has been
sung. It is an offence to refuse any
dish or to leave anything on the plate;
but since few of the dinners contain
more than eighteen courses this is no
great hardship. Different Companies
have, of course, different customs.
Thus the Honourable Company of
Wire-walkers restrict their courses to
fifteen, and invariably, no matter what
the season, have calf's foot jelly. The
calf's-foot, being cleft and therefore
more easily retaining a hold on the
precarious wire, is their emblem.
The Honourable Company of Heel-
tappers, again, make it a practice to
drink a toast with their Worshipful
Master between each course, and since
their courses are twenty in all this is
no small feat considering that heel-
taps are forbidden. The least generous
of the Companies is the Worshipful
Company of Flint-skinners, which
gives its guests only fourteen courses,
and, whereas the other Companies serve
their food on platinum, offers only a
gold service.
HoNorARY MEMBERs.
Every City Company has a few dis-
tinguished honorary members. Thus,
the Worshipful Company of Hair-
splitters has lately added to its roll
Mr. BALFour and Mr. HENRY JAMEs;
the Spot-strokers have paid a similar
compliment to Mr. GEORGE GRAY :
while the Worshipful Company of
Wool-gatherers have enriched their
native intellectual strength with the
addition of Mr. Josiah WEdgwood, M.P.
The two men of eminence who hold
the greatest number of honorary mem-
berships of City Companies are Mr.
EUSTACE MILEs and Mr. BERNARD
SHAw.
Thus Mr. SHAw is an honorary life
member of the Gas-baggers, the Horn-
blowers and the Blotting - padders;
while Mr. MILEs is attached in a similar
capacity to the Milk - blenders, the
Sponge-cake-walkers, the Egg-flippers,
the Nut-hatchers, and the Floor-chasers.
E.
WHAT THE EYE DOESN'T SEE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - While Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE was thinking about
State Insurance for Every Workman
(except you and me) I, in my larger and
broader way, was maturing a scheme
for the private insurance of my cook.
Unfortunately the CHANCELLOR got out
with his idea first, and, to show that I
regard him in no bitter spirit on that
account, I will admit that his little
enterprise helped in its way to bring
my greater one to fruition. “For,"
said I to myself, having been on the
point of effecting this insurance ever
since the notorious Workmen's Com-
pensation Act of 1906 came into force,
“now that we have to insure, let us do
it thoroughly.”
I don't suppose that the CHANCELLoR
pays the same attention to our schemes
as we do to his. The Insurance Com-
pany, however, at once evinced the
most polite interest in the details of
the affair and asked some very pertinent
questions as to cook's workmanship.
On a common proposal form, intended
to display such interest in the work of
every employee, it has begged me to
state “what acids, gases, chemicals,
and explosives are used in the course
of her employment.” To this question
I think you will agree that the only
answer which can do justice to my
cook's cooking is :—“I am sure I don't
know, and can only say that they
produce a most agreeable flavour.”
Your trustful EMPLOYER of LABou R.

6.31 P.M.
THE SMILE THAT COMES OFF.
A BUDA1-Estii Tiiratite MANAGER HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IN FUTURE PAYMENT WILL NOT BE EXACTED FROM PLAYGOERS TILL
AFTER Tile PERForMANCE ; AND THAT Those who IIAVE NOT ENJOYED Til EMSELVEs NEED NOT PAY.
THE POSTSCRIPT.
Opposite the Norley Arms stood
Norley Station. From the Norley Arms
issued a man, with a small handbag.
He was destined for Norley Station.
Such things are common in human
experience.
On the far platform of this wayside
junction was a porter, having the
appearance of a clout, but nevertheless
competent to deal with most intricate
questions regarding the local service.
Now the man with the small handbag
had previously looked up for himself in
a time-table the time of his train, and
had ascertained that it was due to
arrive and depart (either or both) at
The time was then only
6.25, but all the same the man with
the small handbag made his way over
the level crossing to the porter and
there put a question to him.
“Is there a train due to start from
here at 6.31, for London, to-night 2"
That question, put with no desire or
expectation of eliciting new information,
was quite in keeping with the ordinary
run of human nature, but the answer
was a little out of the common.
“No, Sir,” said the porter, merely.
People who come to ask questions
generally stay to argue. Resort was
ultimately had to the official bills of
the Company, and there indeed the
6.31 train was clearly indicated (so
that the man with the small handbag
was right), but rendered suspicious
by an asterisk (so that the porter also
was shown to be right). Do not blame
the publishers of the time-table pre-
viously referred to, for the fact is that
the asterisk was incorporated there
also ; but men with small handbags do
not always realize the importance in
life of asterisks. This asterisk, upon
being properly enquired into, demon-
strated that the 6.31 train ran on
Saturdays only. Unhappily to-day was
a Friday.
Further argument was useless, so the
man returned slowly to the level
crossing; but, as he was about to cross,
his eye fell upon a notice which had
previously escaped him—
BEwARE OF THE TRAINs 1
Smiling sardonically—smiling (I say)
sardonically—he produced a piece of
white chalk from the small handbag
and amplified that notice. The complete
edition then ran :-
BEWARE of THE TRAINS 1
and especially
of those
MARKED WITH AN ASTERISK.

prospect, I may say, of getting snubled for
my pains.]

Their lady's cheek some bards compare;
Whatever kind of rose in June it is,
It's not a match for Mistress Unity's.
The nightingale's nocturnal note
To some suggests their lady's throat;
Whatever kind of noise or tune it is,
It's not a patch on Mistress Unity's.
They say that each man's heart at last

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
UNDER the shadow of the great Angkhor Wat (for
What's Wat see Appendix) in the time of the Khmer
Empire in Kambodia transpires the rather grisly drama to
which Sir HUGH CLIFFoRD has given the title of The
Downfall of the Gods (MURRAY). Employing a rhapsodic
style, slightly reminiscent at times of some of Mrs.
STEEL's works, he succeeds very well in producing an
atmosphere of Oriental vastness and mystery wherewith
to surround his story of the love of a young Sudra for a
Temple dancing girl, a love which overthrew the tyranny
of the Brahmans and inspired a new religion more despotic
and more short-lived than theirs. There were moments,
I confess, and especially when the hero indulged in lengthy
rhetorical outbursts, when I found the high-flown language
a little wearisome, and when, remembering the dedication
in which the author has stated that this is the first book
he has written (though he seems to have published ten
others) I felt that I could have pardoned some occasional
lapses into mere unitalicised logography. There is a
instruction and entertainment while (literally) you wait.
The short truth is that the writer lectures without being
dull and is serious without being solemn.
The chief thing I have to say about Some Happenings
of Glendalyne (HUTCHINson) is that, if they are in any
degree typical of the usual sequence of events in picturesque
Ireland, 1 protest that the L. & N.W. railway shall spread
its attractive posters in vain, so far as I am concerned.
But of course, really, it is all Miss DoRothea CoNYERs'
ſun. At least, this is the only way in which I can account
for such an amazing production from her usually well-
graced and witty pen. My perplexity began on the third
page, where one of the characters, relating the mysterious
disappearance of the boy-owner of Glendalyne, observes
that they never found Hugh's body, only his pet rabbit and
his hat on the edge of the cliff, adding carefully, “Hugh's
hat, not the rabbit's." In the next chapter I found a
wicked uncle in wrongful enjoyment of the estate; I
found bloodhounds, a secret passage, and a madman
walled up in a deserted wing of the mansion. Later
on, it turned out that the madman was really poor Hugh,
who had been kept by his guardian for eight weary years,
difficulty, I think, in
in chains, and (O my
feeling a proper senti-
mental interest in a
love-affair so far re-
moved in point of date
and geography; but
the writer shows great
imaginative skill in the
narrative, and his
knowledge of his
subject gives him an
undoubted advantage
over many tellers of
Eastern tales. He has
also very kindly added
a round dozen of ex-
planatory notes at the
CLARKSON') a whitewig
and beard. Towards
the end, the “happen-
ings” became such a
delirious whirl of im-
possible horrors that I
was obliged to abandon
the attempt to follow
them. But I want to
know whether this
story was intended to
be funny or not. It
undoubtedly is, in the
purple passages at
least, though these
end, which were very
useful to a reader who

PHRASES THAT HAVE GONE WRONG.
were not, one imagines,
the parts intended by
Miss CoNYERs to pro-
As A Lord.”
could scarcely have
told you without their aid what the Wat was, and certainly
not the date at which it was constructed.
To a somewhat light-hearted generation of novel readers,
preferring laughter to abstruse discussion, Mr. PUTNAM
WEALE has dared to submit a story touching upon the
fundamental principles of Eastern philosophy and religion,
and taking for its locus in quo the mission field of China.
Not to be outdone in boldness, Messrs. MACMILLAN have
sent The Unknown God to no less frivolous a person than
Mr. Punch for review, and his Learned Clerk, rising to the
occasion, declares that he has found this interlude of deeper
thought not only instructive but pleasantly arresting. An
accident in the early youth of Paul Hancock leads him to
search for truth in a foreign well, to become involved in the
petty quarrels of different sects, to play a leading part in
a violent and dramatic uplising of a primitive people, all
to end no nearer the solution of the mystery of life than
does the everyday lover. It is perhaps regrettable that the
villany of Mr. Grey, of the English mission, should have
been entirely unrelieved, and that the heroine should be
burdened with the name of Virginia Bayswater, but it is
evidence of the general excellence of the book that an inter-
ruption of the narrative at its very climax, by the devotion
of a whole chapter to the position of the Mohammedans
in China, gives no offence and causes no yawn. You get
duce that effect; or
were they? It is all very perplexing.
“A Callow Chronicle of Frivolous Affairs” is the sub-
title which Mr. WARD MUIR gives to When we are Rich
(STANLEY PAUL); but this does not prevent the best chapter
of his book being concerned with a tragedy; and I am inclined
to think that, although he has tried very hard to write
merely a funny book, his guardian angel controlled his pen
and compelled him to write something infinitely more
engaging. To be young is to be rich—this is the gospel
which he preaches; and, although he has not disdained to
bring to his aid a fat woman, a practical joker, a screeching
parrot and a giggling landlady, I feel that lurking beneath
his obvious effort to provoke smiles is a real understanding
of the pathos of life. I would not say that Mr. MUIR's
practical joker is devoid of ingenuity, but all the same his
novel would not escape mediocrity if it had to rely solely upon
its humour. Those who wish to acquaint themselves with
Bohemian life in London will find, from When we are Rich,
that its laughter is close akin to tears, and if they are
depressed by the frequency with which Mr. MUIR foozles
his attempts to be amusing they will have also to ac-
knowledge that he makes some fine recoveries.
For all the ills of nature, occ. or chronic,
Take Printer's Pie, the universal tonic.

He owns no affectionate habits;

That means, when the passage is dark,
That a fellow is apt to fall over him.

Saying things that a bard mustn't say
In respectable family verses.

This omission no rudeness confesses,
For his voice is confined to a squeak
Which proceeds from his inner re-

And, regarding his fear of a rat,
Well—it's scarcely our place to

For his teeth were forgotten, and that

Forgive me, Thomas, if I wore last night
A touch of hauteur in my lifted nose
While I was prancing on a toe once light,
Fantastic once, and now in silken hose
Recalling memories of the golden time
Of our resilient prime.
Forgive me if I looked you up and down
As one who rudely questions, “What is this?"
You were a Pierrot (were you not 2), or clown 2
Something, at any rate, that went amiss
With my superb costume that spoke a taste
- How exquisitely chaste!
I was a bit above myself, I own;
I felt it due to my historic part
To take the mincing supercilious tone t
Which, as I gathered from a coloured chart,
Characterised a dandy of the days -
Of the late Louis XIII.
But that was not the only reason, no
Some shock had wrought in me a mental change;
I, with my manly scorn of outward show,
Had caught an itch for colours rich and strange;
I meant, as any woman might, to see
How beauteous I could be.
I, who had never sought my tailor's lair
Save at the call of decency—I passed
A solid month selecting what to wear, .
A fortnight trying on, and, when at last

Rigging my person out.
You too, my Thomas, though you walk the town
Clad unobtrusively in something dark,
Yet in the guise of Pierrot (or a clown 2)
You saw yourself as matter for remark;
Though commonplace enough 'twas only bought
After a lot of thought.

Our vanity would find the strain severe;
We should do nothing all the time but play

MY AUNT'S INSURANCE.
My Aunt Harriet has practically decided—she says
“practically,” because, as she adds with considerable truth,
many details have yet to be settled, and you can never be
quite sure until the last moment—she has, I say, practically
decided to insure her plate and jewelry against burglary.
She has lived in her present house for more than twenty
years, and there has never been even the remotest suspicion
of a burglary in the whole district, but that, as my Aunt
says, only makes it the more probable that there will be
one in the immediate future. Burglars, she observes,
are a crafty lot, and must be getting ready to pounce on a
fat neighbourhood hitherto unattempted. -
My Aunt's first step—she took it on my suggestion—was
to write to an insurance agent, with whom she has since had
an extensive correspondence of a highly technical character.
The effect of my Aunt's letters on the agent can only be
faintly surmised. The effect of his upon her has been to
plunge her into a vortex of confusion and despair. As one
possibility after another was opened up to her mind, she
began to conceive the world as one vast and infamous con-
spiracy designed to deprive her of every scrap of her silver
and to unjewel her, if I may say so, down to her last
amethyst. Nor has her gloom been at all mitigated by the
revelation of a long list of substantial companies-prépared
to compensate her (on terms) for every imaginable sort of
loss. She has begun to fear that, after all, there may never
be a burglary in her house, “and then what good will
it all have done me? I shall have paid immense sums for
nothing. Now in life insurance it is different. You must
die some day, you know, and then the company must pay
up, and you can have the satisfaction of leaving the money
to someone. But you can't count on burglars, now can
you? Though, mind you, I'm morally certain we shall
have a burglary here, and that's why I want to insure.”
“Quite right, my dear Aunt,” said I; “let’s hear what
the agent says.”
“That's just it,” said my Aunt morosely. “Here is the
letter in which he says he will give me a list of some
of the better companies taking ‘this class of risk.” What
does the man mean by “risk’? That's their look-out, not
mine. I'm not going to pay them a penny more because
they choose to talk of it as ‘risk.” There's no risk in it
either in such a safe neighbourhood as this. I was very
particular to tell him all about it, and then he writes about
“risk." Pooh Besides, isn't it their business 2 And
business people oughtn't to talk about risk to a business
woman. However, I see through all their dodges, and
they shan't bamboozle me.” I smoothed her down and
we proceeded.
“Now the ‘Irish Orphans Insurance Society,’” said my
Aunt, “sounds very attractive. It is a touching name,
and I should like to deal with them. But what in
heaven's name is the use of mentioning it to me ! I'm not
Irish and never was—haven't a drop of Irish blood in º
veins, and never gave him the least reason to suppose
had ; so that's out of the question. Then there's the
“Accountants' and Auditors' Reliability." Respectable
enough, I dare say; but how can a woman be an account-
ant or an auditor? At any rate, I know I'm not one, and
it's a mere waste of ink and paper to write about it.
‘The British Accident and Burglary Guarantee Corpora-
tion' is the only one that's at all suitable.”
“Well,” said I, “what do they offer?”
“They,” said my Aunt, “make a variety of offers, but
the best is ten per cent. Now if I insure for £2,000—and
the jewels alone are worth that—I shall be getting, let me
see—there are twenty hundreds in two thousand, and ten

twenties are two hundred; that's £200 a year, which is

A HAUNTING FACE.
My physiognomy has never struck me as being in any
way commonplace. Yet it is extraordinary what like-
nesses are seen in me by enthusiastic acquaintances, and
even friends. There are few people among those it has
been my privilege to meet in life, who have not at least
one close relation, cousin, step-father, or what not, of whom
I am the very living image. Disinterested persons have
also traced in my expression characteristics suggestive
of great men in the present and the past, e.g., Lords
RoseBERY and HALDANE, BoxAPARTE, and M. PELIssier.
Nobody, curiously enough, has, up to the time of writing,
recognised any of my features in CROMwFLL's head. But
I am young yet.
Well, the climax came a few nights ago. I met a really
charming woman, who in due course put to me the now
familiar question: “Who is it that you remind me of so
much 2" I promptly tendered her a catalogue of the
celebrities and others I have at various times resembled—
but none would satisfy her. A sudden thought made me
pause, and, in my turn, I regarded her with a searching
look. Yes, the face was undoubtedly familiar. I felt
a conviction that I had sat out a dance with that face
somewhere in my historic past. As I gave her the answer
to her question my eyes sparkled with an affection she
must have considered hard to explain. Here, at last, was
one who had seen in me some resemblance—a passing
fancy, no doubt, but still some resemblance—to myself!

THERE are wild parts of the world,
I am led to understand, where, if one
man treads on another man's toe, a
six-shooter is produced and the offender
shot on the spot. In England the

Severe.
I trod on the toe of Dixon, a business
acquaintance, coming out of the liſt at

only fair to myself to say that I should
have trodden exactly where I did, even
such a hurry as all that,” I murmured,
“for it has taken him nearly twenty
minutes to do it.”
“What's that ?” asked Dixon.
“Nothing, nothing,” I answered.
“I was only just repeating it to myself
to be sure that I had the details right.
Well, I suppose the young man said
he was sorry?”
“No. The young man was coming
round the corner don't you see? Then
he ran into the Yorkshireman, and,
being a decent sort of fellow, stopped
and apologised and asked if any harm
Laughing uproariously, Dixon pro-
ceeded with the narrative. “‘You are
sorry?" said the Yorkshireman, tower-
ing above him, for he was a great burly
fellow. “You will be sorry, young
man, for I am going to give thee a
clout across the face.’”
I stopped dead, and Dixon, having
gone a few paces ahead, came back to
ask me what was the matter.
“Forgive me,” I murmured apolo-
getically, “but your last remark took
me a little by surprise.”

there. -
“I am sorry,” I said.
“You will be sorry, you
mean,” he answered, laughing.
Dixon's laugh generally por-
tends the worst to those who
know his idea of a jest. “You
will be sorry, young man, for I
am going to give thee a clout
across the face.” -
I observed him narrowly,
and he explained.
“You know the story of the
Yorkshireman in London, who
said, ‘You will be sorry, young
man, for I am going to give
thee a clout across the face.”
Have I never told it you?”
Unfortunately, I was not in
a position truthfully to say
that he had.
“The Yorkshireman,” he
continued, “who came up to
London to see the final of the
football cup at the Crystal
Palace. Or was he a Lanca-
shireman? Let me see.”
I had trodden on his toe at
5.15 P.M. The story of the
“ clout across the face” had
begun at 5.16 P.M. (approx.),
and from 5.17 to 5.25 P.M. he

CHEVELURE.
REASSURING REPORT.
THE sensational rumours to
which currency has been given
in the press as to the condition
of the chevelure of Mr. BAM-
BERGER, the famous pianist,
have naturally caused great
anguish to his countless friends
and admirers in both hemi-
spheres. -
We are more than glad
therefore to be able to publish
the following highly reassur-
ing pronunciamiento issued by
Mr. Drysham Pugh, the
famous capillary specialist
who has subjected Mr. BAM-
BERGER to an exhaustive ex-
amination.
Mr. Pugh writes as follows:
“I found that, as the result
of the continuous nervous
strain involved in giving fifty ||
recitals in two months, there
was distinctive evidence of
partial thrombosis of the meta-
tarsal follicles of the occiput,
complicated by a slight failure
of the processes of pigmenta-
tion. I at once prescribed a
course of radium baths followed
by the application of a lotion
in which an infusion of Euca-
lyptus gomphocephala was a
prime constituent, with the

Yorkist.
“Well, whatever he was,” pursued
Dixon, “he had come up to London
by a cheap trip to go to the Crystal
Palace. Just outside Euston . . .”
“Yes,” I said hastily, observing him
pause, “one can come from Yorkshire
as well as from Lancashire to Euston,
if one really wants to. Probably your
man had his own reasons for choosing
the more circuitous route.”
“Anyhow, whether it was Euston or
King's Cross, he was just outside it,
when a young man, hurrying round a
corner, ran into him.”
“The young man can't have been in
had been done. But the other was not
going to leave it at that. Drawing
himself up to his full height, and he
was a great big navvy, he towered
over the unfortunate young man who
had run into him . . . .”

corner,” I put in.

got it quite right.”
I led Dixon into a side street and got
the matter put in order. The young
man had said, it appeared on cross-
examination, that he was sorry. That
point cleared up, we pressed on again.
I haven't malevolent
most beneficial results. Upon
examination to-day I found that all
traces of fluorescence had been elimin-
ated from the occiput, while the follicles
had resumed their normal splendour,
thus restoring to Mr. BAMBERGER his
full power of capillary attraction. The
rumour that he would be obliged to
wear a wig is a dastardly falsehood
which can only be attributed to the
invention of some dis-
appointed rival.” -
Sir Pompey BoldFRO, Mr. BAM-
BERGER's father-in-law, is celebrating
this auspicious recovery by a reception
in Belgrave Square, at which Mrs.
BAMBERGER will recite “Balder Dead.” l

- PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ADVENTURER.
CHAPTER I.
JASPER FourToBs gnawed the ends of
his moustache and scowled gloomily.
The Countess whom he had been
blackmailing for the last three years
had died suddenly—as luck would have
it, on the very day on which her
monthly instalment was due. . . There
seemed to be nothing between him and
beggary but honest work. Shrugging
his shoulders slightly he picked up the
daily paper and ran his eyes over it
cynically. - - -
Suddenly he started back with a
hoarse cry of triumph. Once more Fate
had stepped in at the psychological
moment.
“BY-ELECTION IN North souTHSHIRE”
were the magic words which had caught
his eye. Mr. Samuel Boodle had at
last been appointed to the post in the
Civil Service for which his subsizarship
at Downing College in 1873 had long
marked him out, and his retirement
from the House “ of Commons had
brought about the first electoral con-
test since the establishment of Payment
of Members. f -
“Ha,” said Jasper sardonically to
himself, “eet is well. Ha, oh, ha!” He
lit an expensive cigarette and laughed
coarsely. “My luck is in,” he muttered.
“Four hundred a year, Jasp, you
sinner, be dashed to you!”
Drawing on his pumps and slipping
into his fur-lined coat, he left the room,
and with long panther-like strides made
his way rapidly to the station.
CHAPTER II.
“You say you have called to solicit
my vote,” said Mr. Pennywaite
plaintively, “but you won't tell me
your views. Are you for or against
Free Trade 2 ”
“Hist,” said Jasper, putting a finger
to his lips. “Are we alone 2"
“Of course we are,” said Mr.
Pennywaite. “Can't you see?”
Jasper rose from his seat and stole
to the door. He stood there silently
for a moment, his fingers grasping the
handle, then turned it suddenly and
flung the door open. The hall was
empty.
“Don’t do it,” said Mr. Pennywaite
testily. “What's the matter with the
man 2''
Jasper returned to his chair.
“I had feared that there were eaves-
droppers,” he explained. “One cannot
be too careful. Now I am ready to
listen to you.”
“I asked if you were for or against
Free Trade. I don't see how you can
expect me to vote for you without
knowing that.”
Jasper lit a cigar and leant forward
impressively.
“Neither,” he said, blowing out a
cloud of smoke. “Or perhaps it would
be more accurate to say “Both.’”
“What on earth do you mean 2 ”
“What do the people want?” said
Jasper cynically. “You know this
part of the country; I don't. Which
goes down best ? Once I know that,
I shall preach accordingly, and they
will vote for me.” º
“But, my dear Sir, you seem to for-
get that there is an official Tariff
Reformer and an official Free Trader in
the field already. Why shouldn't the
electors vote for them 2 "
“I had forgotten it,” cried Jasper,
with a terrible start. “I had read so
much in the papers about adventurers
snapping up seats when once Members
were paid that I began to think that
there was never more than one candi-
date for a constituency. It is a fact
that there are these two other men.”
He scowled and lit another cigar.
“Even if I remove them,” he added
darkly, “two others would take their
laces.”. -
“The point is,” said Mr. Pennywaite,
“have you anything to offer that they
haven't.”
“Yes,” said Jasper suddenly and
desperately. “This.” He produced
a loaded revolver from his pockets
and pressed it to the temple of
the other. “Now, then, I want a
thousand pounds. I have just re-
membered that I had forgotten some-
thing else. I had quite forgotten that
there were such things as election
expenses. Hand over quickly—for,
by Heaven, I am in no mood for
trifling.”
“My good man,” said Mr. Penny-
waite, “don’t be so silly. I haven't
even got a hundred pounds.”
“Then you must borrow it for me.
The interest is certain; I shall have my
four hundred a year, and I will pay you
eighty pounds a year while you live.
Quick, I am desperate—your promise,
or I shoot ' "
“You fool,” said Mr. Pennywaite,
“you've forgotten something else.
There is a general election every four
years. So, even if they keep on
electing you, which is extremely un-
likely once they know the sort of man
you are, you’d want——”
But Jasper didn't want anything
just then. He had swooned.
CHAPTER III.
A month later, in London, Jasper
Fourtoes was gloomily surveying two
sets of figures. The first set went like
this:—
Sir Thomas BILTON (L.) 4,837
Capt. PADDock (U.) 4,695
JASPER FourToBs (Ind.) 3
L. majority over U. 142
L. majority over Ind. 4,834
L. majority overall parties 139
No change.
lº second set of figures went like
this:—
Debit. Credit.
£ s. d. To cash value of
To sundry enhanced pros-
expenses 834 611 | pects of suc-
To damage cess at next
by eggs Election due to
and simi- fact-of having
lar argu- | stood before,
ments 15 15 0 say - - - 9d.
Total 850 1 11
Jasper studied these figures long
and earnestly as he gloomily chewed
his moustache. Then he shrugged his
shoulders and lit a cigar.
“The adventurer's life is not what it
was,” he said with a sigh. “Sometimes
I think that even on the Stock Exchange
there is more doing.” A. A. M.
THE LITTLE HEN.
A WAYSIDE SKETCH.
NEveR will there be a more sudden
or inexplicable accident. At the one
second I was booming at a reasonable
pace down a naked white road which
ran straight and utterly empty of traffic
for the whole of a mile. At the next
second the brakes had torn the bloom
off forty pounds' worth of tyres. A
man had appeared in the middle of the
road literally from nowhere, holding up
a horror-stricken hand which appeared
to contain bread, and pointing with the
other to an unexpected hen that lay
dead in the dust ten yards behind.
He was wearing striped socks and
carried his boots in the other hand.
On reflection, I see that my momentary
fancy that the person was lunching
upon bread and boots was a wrong
and ill-considered fancy. -
He wore a black straw hat which
was turning iron-grey; a cricket blazer
striped in three colours, that had been
chocolate, yellow and red, but from
which quite half the stripes had
vanished; corduroy trousers that had
once been green and somehow made
you think of railway stations; and a-
beard grown in two colours, blood-
orange and dun, with a touch of
lemon at the edges. He looked at me
through wooden-framed spectacles.

He said, “Pardon me, Sir—my little
hen is dead.” He raised his hat—the
brim of it.
then that the crown was kept on by
elastic passing under his chin. “Per-
mit me to examine the little hen, Sir.”
He bent over the body for a moment,
spoke to it without getting a reply,
tried to bribe it to wake with a piece
of bread, and, finding this inspired
effort at resuscitation unsuccessful,
furtively wiped away a tear, and came
back to me.
Then he raised his brim again.
“The little hen is dead,” he said, and
sobbed slightly. Then he closed both
his eyes and pressed his hands over his
face, having put his bread into his
pocket from which it ſell into the road
—through a hole like the hole of the
bottomless pit. He picked it up, lightly
brushed the dust from it with his sleeve,
and held it in his hand during the
remainder of the interview.
“My little companion 1" he said.
He had an educated voice. “I used to
build it a little roost at my feet every
night,” he added sadly.
I felt horribly ashamed, and thought
of the prisoner who tamed a spider.
His beard trembled. -
“She was all I had, Sir . . . that
hem—that little stolen fowl . . . Stolen,
Sir. I stole her from a farm in Kent.
This is my punishment. For fourteen
hundred miles we have been compan-
ions in adversity—walking the same
roads, sharing the same shelter of the
hedge in storm, the same crust in
hunger, the same rivulets in thirst.”
He looked thoughtfully at the bread
in his hand.
“Sir, this means starvation to me.
I bartered an egg for half a loaf yester-
day . . . . half a loaf and a handful of
corn. But now . . . there will be no
more eggs.” His lips moved silently.
Then he spoke again.
“It would be unfair to expect you to
realise quite all that little bird meant
to me, Sir . . . unfair and an admission
of gross vanity. And yet . . . every
man, I suppose, possesses his little hen,
something to love, to protect, to indulge.
Weak, illogical, wayward, perhaps . .
but with its charm. . . .
“That little hen once saved my life.
And once I saved hers. You will see
there were ties above the ordinary.”
He lifted one foot, and I saw that he
did not wear soles on his socks.
“I will journey on—into the infi-
nite . . . . alone,” he said, in little
more than a whisper, and at the same
time slipped on a boot.
“Alone . . . . penniless.”
He lifted the greater part of the fowl
and kissed it.
“Forgive this display of feeling,” he
I had not noticed until l''
Doctor's Wife (reading telegram). “IF You ARE INTERESTED IN A PREITY FOOT AND ANKLE

muttered. “Pardonable—perhaps—
Frenchmen. But we English. . . .”
He slipped on the other boot. The
majority of the hen dangled from his
hand as he stared across the distant
downs into the sunset.
“How lonely are the uplands !” he
said suddenly.
I fumbled.
“If a half-sovereign—” I began,
and hesitated.
Tears sprang to his eyes, blurring
the spectacles.
“What can I say or do? I am poor,”
he cried, “and a coward. I dare not
refuse.”
He stood for a second in an attitude
of deep dejection. I pressed the
money into his hand.
Then suddenly his face lighted up.
“She is all I have in the world,” he
said bravely, “and I will commit her
into your hands.”
He stepped forward and laid the hen
tenderly on the floor of the car. Then,
nodding blindly, he stood clear of the
car to watch me go. He removed his
brim and remained standing, desolate
and downcast, until I was out of sight.
It was a queer little incident—touch-
ing in its way. I showed my wife the
little hen that night.
“You'd better let John bury it,” she
said. “It is asad littlestory—if you have
a bad cold in the head. I haven't. This
hen has been dead at least a fortnight.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted froxi The DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, May
HoPE, rising to move rejection
of Parliament Bill, “that I
shall have the sympathy of the
whole House—”
Assurance not falsified.
Only, feeling of sympathy so
acute that Members felt con-
strained to go forth and express
it in fuller space of Lobby
or in fresher air of Terrace.
Amid bustle of departing
throng the special ground of
effective appeal not made clear.
Select few who remained heard
HoPE tell a flattering tale of
his preference for “the newest,
crudest, rawest American
Western State Senate, with a
row of spittoons along the floor.”
—he was a little particular
about the spittoons—“rather
than the House of Lords subject
to this Veto Bill.”
It was the last night of long,
occasionally stubborn, fight
round a Measure denounced
by Opposition as an iniquitous
attack on a sainted Constitu-
tion.
one wouldn't have thought it.
Benches filled up when PREMIER,
PRINCE ARTHUR, and WINSTON were
on their legs, but for the rest remained
half empty, their occupants altogether
listless. Members eager only for the
division that would put an end to
wearisome marching and counter-
marching varied by tedious talk.
F. E. SMITH, favoured with what
looked like great opportunity, was
selected to lead this last attack. Cer-
tainly had full audience. Somehow his
blunderbuss missed fire. He might
have been leading a minuet instead of
a forlorn hope against an impregnable
position. Too evident that no fiery
ſurnace of righteous indignation glowed
behind his immaculate shirt-front. No
light of battle glared in his pensive
eye. At intervals he furtively waved
flag of truce. Occasionally he made
curious gesture as if restraining dis-
position to obey the command, “Hands
up,” before it was uttered by the
overbearing foe.
SARK has a story of a shipmate on
a sea voyage who woke him every
morning by giving orders from an
adjoining berth for his bath. Con-
cerned for its temperature he never
omitted to say, “Not 'ot or else cold.”
Such was the precise temperature of
F. E.'s speech. To put it more briefly,
it was tepid.

vailing dulness. His contri-
bution to debate through long
succession of sittings probably
exceeded that of any other
Member. Turned up now as
fresh and vigorous as if he
were making his first plunge
into the salt estranging sea
of controversy. Incidentally he
got in one of the neatest retorts

ing that under the Parliament
Bill “the power of the Lords will
not merely be effective but for-
midable, even menacing,” a
Voice from benches opposite
contributed to argument the
monosyllable “Rot!”
“An Honourable Member
says 'Rot,’” remarked WINston
with increasing winsomeness.
“Doubtless it represents what
is in his mind.”
At eleven o'clock House filled

A throng peopled the Bar. Side

sciousness shone on every face

on £400 a year. But will it? Certainly
not if opposition, by no means confined
to one side of House, be skilfully and
resolutely led. Men who have closest
at heart veneration and affection for
Mother of Parliaments see in this
proposal inevitable degradation. The
voluble Carpet Bagger, hitherto partly
restrained in search of a seat by
knowledge that if he succeeds he
must needs meet lodging and other
domestic expenses out of his own pocket,
will find difficulties vanish at magic
touch of State payment. He and his
kind will shoulder off the premises the
class of men, by no means universally
rich, who, honoured and bestowing
honour, have raised House of Commons
to its present stainless pinnacle.
Of course, if PREMIER makes proposal
a question of confidence, a majority will
be forthcoming, however reluctantly, to
support it. But it is essentially a case
in which private judgment of Members
should be untrammelled by considera-
tions of Party fealty. PRINCE ARTHUR,
as leading Composite Opposition, should
insist on Government Whips taking no
official part in the decisive division.
Business done.—Budget brought in.
House of Lords, Wednesday.—Third
night of debate, even more dolorous
than greater part of that in Commons
on Parliament Bill, on what Marquis of
LANsdowne calls the House of Lords'
Reconstitution Bill. Looking down
from Strangers' Gallery, catching here
and there a sentence from dispirited
speeches forlornly uttered, the visitor
might well suppose the House had
come to bury Caesar not to reconsti-
tute him.
Everyone, not least clearly the author
of the Bill, knows it is a not altogether
harmless delusion. On its forehead was
written at birth the fatal words “Too
late.” Had it been introduced a couple
of years ago, it might have served as
basis of settlement between two political
parties of long vexed question. In
1909 the Peers preferred to devote
their available time to throwing out
the Budget. That accomplished, what
followed was as inevitable as it is
irrevocable.
LANSDown E's crown of sorrow is that,
having devoted long labour, skilfully
overcome much opposition privily de-
monstrated, his endeavour to save the
situation does not call forth anything
like enthusiasm on his own side. On
the contrary there have been forth-
coming during progress of debate rarely
precedented signs of revolt against
authority of Unionist Leader. Regarded
as a national custom practised by others
something may be said in favour of the
custom of hara-kiri. But when the
sword is placed in your hand and it
is your own carcass that is to be cut
up the point of view is changed.
Business done.—Reconstitution Bill
talked round and about.
House of Commons, Thursday. —
MoRRELL raised a nice and difficult
question. Arose upon appointment of
additional commissioners under Small
Holdings Act and particulars of the
Areas allotted then.
“Will each commissioner,” he asked,
“be obliged to reside in his area?”
Familiar fact that in well-ordered
domestic establishments, the area (per-
taining to the kitchen) is the domain
of the Cook, open to occasional visits
from the perambulatory policeman.

MUSIC.
(In the manner of “The Morning Post.")
LoHENGRIN AT Covent GARDEN.
WAGNER's Lohengrin was performed
last night—needless to say not for the
first time; but it is only just to remark
that in this case familiarity with the
work was not allowed to engender any
negligence in the representation, and
at every turn indications were not
lacking of conscientious preparation.
Special interest attached to the per-
formance in that on this occasion
M. Paprika, the eminent Bulgarian bari-
tone, made his London début in the rôle
of Telramund. As the unfortunate
Brabantian nobleman M. Paprika
created on the whole a highly favour-
able impression, and he undoubtedly
enhanced the efficacy of his interpre-
tation by his judicious. Sartorial equip-
ment, which evinced a regard for detail
not always observable in lyric artists.
Thus the sinister attributes of the part
were cleverly indicated by the choice of
a steeple-crowned beaver hat, a purple
toga and a Roman sword, the whole
being set off by a pair of weirdly sug-
gestive red sandals. M. Paprika's
voice is of sonorous quality and his
enunciation is commendably articulate.
Altogether this estimable artist must
% be reckoned a decided acquisition to
the company. The Elsa of Madame
Joska Pipitolf is too well known to
demand a meticulous survey of its
many excellences, vocal and histri-
onic. Suffice it to observe that she
acquitted herself in a manner which
fully justified the plaudits bestowed on
her efforts by the influential audience
who witnessed her meritorious rendi-
tion. The same remarks, when the
appropriate modifications involved in
the discrepancy between the rôles have
been made, can be fittingly applied to
the Lohengrin of the cast, M. Ingo
Brobiloff, the capable Lithuanian
tenor, whose engagement by the opera
syndicate has been signally vindicated
on so many occasions by his industrious
co-operation. The part of the King
was safe in the vocal cords of Signor
Annibale Tarabuso, and an efficient
Herald was forthcoming in Mr. Mario
Carkeek, a Californian singer of ap-
proved talent and urbane deportment.
Commendation is also due to the oper-
atic taxidermist responsible for the
appearance of the swan, whose gestures
were permeated with an instinct for
refined gentility. The performance
was conducted by Signor Bartolommeo
Bolcione, whose artistic ideals and
temperament were manifested at every
point in the choice of tone values, the
manipulation of his bâton, and the
vitality which he contrived to impart
to the conceptions of the meritorious
and distinguished composer with the
execution of whose elegant score he
was entrusted.
“In the House of Lords this evening Mr.
Asquith said he was satisfied that in the
interests of this country it was desirable we
should have a properly constituted Second
Chamber."—Manchester Evening News.
A coward would have been satisfied to
say it in the House of Commons.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PASTURES NEW.
THERE are times when I tire of
adding up figures, or weighing out tea,
or whatever you like to suppose my
present occupation to be; and then I
dream dreams, in which I imagine
myself translated to a higher and mºre
congenial sphere of activity. Now I
am a popular Actor-Manager, now a
Prime Minister, and in even more
reckless moments editor of The
Observer. But sooner or later, having
finished dreaming, I turn to solid
reality, and glance through the
“Situations Vacant " column of my
daily paper to discover what I actually
might be if I wasn't what I am.
I thought I had “found myself.”
(as the biographers say) the other
morning when the following advertise-
ment caught my eye;— .
“Electric Jib Crane Driver wanted.
Must be experienced and willing to
make himself generally useful. Apply
Box 2,357, General Post Office.”
The possibilities inherent in such a
situation so fired my imagination that
I determined to lose no time in apply-
ing for it, and sat down at once to
write the necessary letter. The be-
ginning caused me the most trouble.
How, I wondered, did one address a
Box” “Dear Box,” or “Dear Box
2,357,” sounded a little familiar;
“Dear Sir or Madam as the Box may
hold "seemed too impersonal; and the
task of writing more than two lines in
the third person is one from which I
have always shrunk. In the end I de-
cided to risk the assumption that the
occupant of the Box was a man, an
wrote as follows:— -
“DEAR SIR,-Seeing that you re-
quire an experienced chauffeur for your
electric jib crane, I beg to offer my
services. I am thoroughly acclimatised
to electric jib cranes of almost every
make—Daimler, Remington, Heidsieck,
and so on. For the past year I have
been driving Mr. Asquith about in a
single-house-power Viteau, without a
brake, but fitted with a patent anti-
suffragetter. The latter, however, was
recently put out of action by a bomb,
and since then I have resigned the
post. I should be quite willing to
make myself generally useful about the
house and grounds, and could take a
hand at Bridge in cases of emergency.
Salary is not so much an object with
me as a comfortable, Christian home.
—Yours, etc.”
I waited several days for a reply,
but strangely enough none was forth-
coming. Little rebuffs like that, how-
ever, were not going to deter me, so I
tried in another direction. This time
nothing on the list caught my fancy
till I came to the V's, when I lighted
upon this:— -
“Warnish - Maker. Man used to
gum-running. State wages, with full
particulars, to the Stikkey Business
Development Co., High Street, Ber-
mondsey.”
To which I replied:—
“DEAR SIR ,-Warnish has always
exercised a great fascination over me,
and, although I have no first-hand
acquaintance with its manufacture, I
have often stood for hours watching
the decoration of a shop-front with
the substance in whose development
your firm has played so conspicuous a
part. When they come to putting in
the wriggly lines, nothing could ever
induce me to move on. As for the
special qualifications you demand in
your advertisement, I may mention
that I did a good deal of gum-running
in the South African War, which, as
you may remember, was brought to a
successful conclusion. I am a constant
speaker at our local Debating Society,
can play easy accompaniments, and
should require a commencing salary of
£500 (five hundred pounds) a year.—
Yours, etc.”
When nothing came of this either,
I left the “Situations Vacant " column
pretty severely alone for some consider-
able time. The other day, however, I
happened to look through it again, and
my apathy comple!ely vanished when
I found the following:—
“Smart Young Gentleman wanted,
to learn duties as assistant manager
for theatrical business. Wear evening
dress. Premium required. Apply
Hy. Knutt, 763A, Charing Cross
Road.” -
It was, I need hardly say, the
evening dress that did it. Who could
resist such an inducement 2 Not I,
for one. With almost feverish haste
I wrote to Mr. Knutt, adapting the
tone of my letter to the character of
the profession I had always longed to
enter.
“MY DEAR HY.,” I said, “I was no
end bucked at seeing your little advert.
in to-day's rag. It's the very thing
I've been looking for. I'm just
dying to be an assistant theatrical
manager, and help the governor stroll
round the house every evening and
chat with the pretty programme-girls
and swear at the plain ones. And
evening dress, too ! Do you think I
might wear a white waistcoat? If so,
I wouldn't mind paying a little bit
extra in premium. So long, Hy., old
pal. Write soon. How are Thos.,
Chas., and Jno. 2–Ever yours, etc.”
This morning I got Hy.'s reply.
“What do you say,” he inquired,
“to a little bit of dinner at the Rococo
to-morrow evening 2 We could then
fix up things over a bottle of the best.
I may tell you that I pºcked your
application out of several hundred I
have received for the post, for which
you seem to have exactly the right
qualities. Wire me what time to
meet you, and if you bring your
cheque-book the business can all be
finished with on the spot.—Yours,
HY, KNUTT.”
But I'm not wiring him. I can't
stand the food at the Rococo.
AN APPALLING CONTINGENCY,
[Suggested by the the ºry recently put for.
ward that, in the m dern drama, other motives
are tending to displace the hitherto supreme
“love interest,” and that in the play of the
future the aºleal to the amorous emotiols will
be less and less in evidence.]
WE English are a sober race,
And yet, beneath our colder
fashions,
I've always held that one could
trace
The stirrings of volcanic passions,
For which our Drama, though
derided,
A senimental safety-valve provided;
That, though a prudent mother-wit
Ruled drably o'er our actual
doings,
When settled in the stalls or pit
We gave ourselves to loves and
wooings,
To plightcd troths and secret
meetings,
Flopements, vows, and amorous en-
treatings;
And thereby managed to assuage
Our wilder moods and reckless
feelings,
Which otherwise might start to
rage
In all Life's ordinary dealings;
To give the theory brief expression:
Love on the stage, but in our lives
Discretion.
Hence with your loveless plays one
Sees
Arrive a dark and horrid doubtlet:
What of our hidden passions, please,
When you've removed their an-
cient outlet 2
Is every Briton, wise or stupid,
To wander blindly in the toils of Cupid?
Heaven forbid! No, give us still
The themes and plots of orthodoxy,
And let us take our modest fill
Of passion, as it were, by proxy:
The play's the place for Cupid's
antics,
Else in our lives we all become
Romantics!

MR. PUNCH'S SUPPLEMENT.
VI.-STEAMSHIPs.
To the vast influx of visitors to the
Coronation from other countries and
the circumstance that few of them fly
or swim, but instead use steamships,
must be attributed the fascinatingly
veracious article which follows. The
reason that no errors are to be dis-
cerned in it is due to the fact that
the proofs have been rigorously read
by well-known experts. Thus, Mr.
Montagu Holbein and Sir ARTHUR
WING PINERo have revised the section
which deals with the Cross and Mid-
Channel services. If any reference to
rackets is found here it will have been
first scrutinised by WILLIAMs, while
the long dissertation on Lloyd's rates
for insuring the Heraldic Jall on a
sea passage is the work of Sir ALFRED
Scott GATTY, Garter King-at-Arms,
but may, of course, be cut out by the
editor at the last moment. The
historical section has been supervised
by Sir Kyloe Watts (the descendant
of Sir Is AAC WATTs, the inventor of
the steam-kettle), Mr. JoHN MASEFIELD,
Miss BEATRICE HARRADEN and other
authorities on shipping.
HISTORY.
The first steamship was built on
the Thames. Hence the phrase “Old
as the HILLs.” She was of only
200 tons burthen and was christened
Dread-most-things-but-particularly-the-
open-sea. This name was given to
her by the VENERABLE BEDE, who
broke over her bows a bottle of
vintage metheglin in the presence of the
very flower of art, literature and
politics. From this simple vessel grew
the gigantic fleet that now ploughs the
waves in every direction and harrows
the stomachs of all poor sailors on
board.
The largest Atlantic liner that exists
is the Dollarmania, recently launched
by the celebrated American firm of
Cramp, of Philadelphia. The Dollar-
mania is exactly half-a-mile long. She
has six funnels, a permanent theatrical
company, a morning and evening paper,
a polo ground, and a golf course. Her
chef receives £4,000 a year.
PURPosL AND Use.
Steamships go all over the world,
except to the coast of Bohemia. There
was a line thither in SHAKSPEARE's time,
but it has since been discontinued.
There are even steamships on the Swiss
and Italian lakes, greatly to the per-
plexity of tourists, who cannot think
how they got there.
The only way to get to certain
places is by steamship—the West
Indies, for example. The West Indies,
whose motto (an adaptation of an old
Spanish phrase) is Hava bañana, are
famous for fruit, a Socialistic govern-
ment, and periodical visits from Mr.
x X x X x X x X x X x (the author
of Fanny's First Play), and teams of
jocular but not quite first-class
cricketers. Steamships that succeed
in avoiding a collision with the
Bermudas take one to the West
Indies in about ten days. Other places
which one may visit in steamships are
Calais, Ryde and Margate. Few trips
are more popular than that to Calais, a
famous French seaport once celebrated
for duels, and now for a sprightly French
dance named after it—the Pas de
Calais. Ryde has been wittily called the
Calais of the Isle of Wight, a piece of
land entirely surrounded by water,
lying to the south of England and de-
pendent upon steamships not only for
the visitors, by whom it subsists, but for
many of the necessities of life, which
it offers for sale at an enormous profit.
Margate differs from Calais and Ryde
in that it may also be reached from
London by land; but only the intrepid
make the journey.
Steamships carry not only their pre-
cious freight of human and American
souls, but also merchandise and things
to eat. Forexample, without steamships
we should get no eggs from Denmark,
or, at any rate, they would not be
worth getting when we got them.
Nor should we be able to correspond
freely with our distant relations and
send remittances to Queensland and
British Columbia.
It is steamships that bring us
currants from Greece, and slippers from
Morocco, and sprouts from Brussels,
and tenors from Italy, and creepers
from Virginia, and crosses from Malta,
and blinds from Venice.
MAL-DE-MER.
Few persons can travel by steamship
without suffering from the horrid com-
plaint to which the above delicate
French name has been given. It was
first discovered by the famous Cartha-
ginian navigator, HANNo, who in his
Periplus has a most moving chapter on
the subject, headed Sic Transit. See
also the refined article, “Storm-pan,” by
Professor Onotis P. Flagler, in the
new edition of the Encyclopædia Britan-
711C01.

No steamship is complete without
an engineer and stoker. Captains are
carried on Atlantic liners to be pleasant
to important passengers. In addition,
every ocean greyhound (as they are
facetiously called) has on board a
marconigraph - operator in case the
Wall Street magnates should feel
bored, or captains should wish to
communicate with the daily papers.
The voyage from England to America
is performed by the Dollarmania in
three days, all of which are spent
either in entertainments in the saloons
or in wagering on the day's run.

TRUE LOWE.
I SING of bed, for topics fail,
And sing I must and will.
The broken heart is getting stale,
The moon is staler still.
The kiss is clearly oversung,
The thread of love is bared,
And nothing beats a pair of sheets
(Providing they are aired).
| When I was young and full of sense
I tried to climb a tree,
But, owing to incompetence,
I fell and broke a knee.
I lay in bed for weeks and weeks;
| The thing became a craze.
: Unhappy me, that I might be
Back in those good old days!
There are who wag untiring jaws
And hardly ever cease
| To clamour hotly in the cause
Of Universal Peace.
These blame the darned inventiveness
Of MAXIM and of KRUPP;
They should taboo the villain who
Invented getting up.
I know a man who loves a face,
But yet his love is such
That he can leave it for a space
— Nor miss it overmuch.
To leave my bed at any time
I am extremely loath;
And that is clear to all who hear
My matutinal oath.
And if at times I should suggest
That we might well arrange
To give our love a little rest,
And give ourselves a change:
Where wives would make domestic
Scenes,
Fiancées sulk or pout,
It does not cry or even try
To follow me about.
The tepid lover asks a lot
But takes what he can get.
Such I, most certainly, am not,
“And yet,” say you, “and yet
Those charms which you would
emphasise
You carelessly forego;
The night is sped; you're not in bed!”
I answer, “See below.”
We poets labour overtime
That so our pots may boil.
As bait to catch the elusive rhyme
We use the midnight oil.
We cannot always practise what
In theory we discuss;
But anyhow I'll do it now,
And clinch the matter thus:—
They say that Daisy is a dear,
That Mabel is a treat;
They rhapsodize of Elsie's ear,
They rave of Phyllis' feet;
They say that Rose's cheeks are pink,
That Sally's eyes are brown. . . .
For all I know that may be so;
Give me my eiderdown.
The procession of medical students
which got into trouble on the occasion
of their protest against Dr. MACAURA,
was headed by men carrying a coffin.
This does not strike us as a particularly
happy symbol of their profession.
Extract from The Liverpool Evening
Echo on the subject of the Nottingham
petition:—“The judges issued warrants
for the apprehension of two men,
GEORGE SHAw and public-houses.” If
our contemporary has not given the
second man a name, it has certainly
given him a “local habitation.”

and the boiler will be furnished with brass

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is good to find that the author of The Professional
Aunt has written another book at least equally delightful.
She calls it People of Popham (CoNSTABLE). As to what
it is about, that is a different matter; for the greater part,
nothing whateyer happens to anybody of whom it treats;
but it is impossible to be annoyed with Mrs. GEORGE
WEMyss over this, or to attempt to hurry things by skipping,
because on almost every page you are given some quite
duced to an herbaceous border, or (unless he is in for a
competition) at the contemplation of a sweet pea. The
hero's favourite apothegm apparently (since he quotes it
twice) is the line from The Blue Bird, “There are no
Dead,” a thought which appears to me neither new enough
nor true enough to get very excited about.
If the unsophisticated schoolgirl still exists, to her, no
doubt, Winding Paths (HURST AND BLACKETT) will make
its instant appeal. And so much success is by no means
to be grudged Miss GERTRUDE PAGE, for, though the loves

Thére was once a village called
Popham, and some nice friendly
human people lived in it. This
is the matter of the book; and
bf course you will say Cranford
at once; to which I reply that
Mrs. WEMYss has no cause to
be frightened even at this com-
parison. There is, in short, a
quality about her work which
can only be expressed by one
rather over-used word—charm.
One feels that she could write
about a railway goods-station
—the most uninteresting thing
I can think of for the moment
—and make you feel that it
was one of the compensations
of life. When you have read
the book and chuckled time
after time over its tender and
wholly inconsequential humour
(Mrs. WEMyss writes exactly
like a very nice woman talking),
you will see that all I have
said about its attractiveness is
thoroughly deserved.

Moreover her humour is, in
its quieter moments, attractive

of the world the book will, I am
afraid,
Draw the te r from many an eye,

Its reasoning upon the bigger

he ought, for all his ugliness, to have found a few
ladies not wholly indifferent to him before the book
opened. I am afraid it was the fact that pretty women
did not notice him in the street which really got upon his
nerves. But barring this criticism I am extremely grateful
to the writer of a very pleasant story. Readers of his former
books will not be surprised to find plenty of humorous and
subtle observations in this one, and Belwattle, the wife of the
unlovely gentlemen's friend, Moza his man, and, above all,
Dandy his dog, are delightfully sketched characters. But
why, oh why must we have this superſluity of sentiment
over flowers ? I dare not conjecture what a primrose by
the river's brim would have meant to most of the people
in this book, and I am sure they would have burst into tears
at the sight of an auricula. Even a “plain blunt man,” I
think, should set some limit to his raptures on being intro-

DEAR MR. PUNCH.—May I through

attention of the gentleman who is
responsible for the Coronation Stands
in the Strand district of Westminster
to a grave oversight in their con-
struction ? He stated, some time ago,
that these stands are constructed
to support four times the weight
of the people they are to accommodate
in order to withstand the strain
when the spectators all sway to one
side to see some object of interest
(such as the procession—always an ||
object of interest on these occasions).

WHEN Hamlet found the King at prayer—
A very soft and easy victim—
He meant to kill him then and there,
Taken behind and unaware,
Dut checked the previous blade that would have
pricked him.
He could, I say, have “done it pat,"
But, when he made a careful study
Of what it was the King was at,
He saw a better way than that,
More practical and every bit as bloody.
“If I should knock him now,” he said,
“Kneeling, a self-acknowledged sinner,
He 'd never drop to hell like lead,
But fly aloft to heaven instead. … .
I'll do it later—some day after dinner.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
At this point there was an ominous
break in the golden voice of the
speaker, and suddenly, with a despair-
ing moue, she whispered in an in-
describably pathetic aside to Sir
Canterbury Lamb, “I can't go on with
this; it's really too thick.” En-
couraged by the Director's assurances
she struggled on for a few more
sentences, only to break down hope-
lessly in an interesting passage, in
which she recommended the would-be
prima donna to make a point of
reading aloud at least fifty lines every
morning from PLATO's Republic or
ARIstotle's Ethics. “I cannot go
on,” she cried in poignant accents;
“I really cannot stick it out. I have
never referred to ARISTOTLE in public
before and it makes me too nervous.”
The consternation amongst the
audience was most painful to witness,
but after an agonising pause the
tension was relieved by Madame
Brisbani's kindly consenting to sing
the mad scene from AMBROISE
THoMAs's Hamlet, and the company
shortly afterwards broke up in
paroxysms of the sincerest adulation.
E-
PHANTASMS OF THE LIVING.
By the courtesy of the Editor of The
Dictator we are enabled to place before
our readers a selection from the letters
on this enthralling subject which will
appear in the next issue of our valued
contemporary.
A FELINE APPARITION.
SIR,-When I was an undergraduate
at Balliol in the late sixties, I had a
favourite cat, a Peruvian tortoiseshell,
which suffered from ophthalmia, and
which I had fitted with spectacles. It
could see perfectly well at night, but
in the day required artificial aid—as
Jowett wittily said, redeunt spectacula
mame. One summer term, returning
to my rooms late at night after a some-
what pro' racted bump supper, I was
amazed to see my cat hovering in mid-
air. I called to it by name, but it paid
no attention and suddenly vanished.
When my scout came in the morning
I at once asked after the cat, and
he informed me that the cat had
followed him home the evening before
and spent the night in his house.
Jowett was immensely interested in
the incident and intended to introduce
it into the notes to his translation of
PLATO, but for some reason or other
failed to carry out his intention. The
cat, I may mention, lived for several
years afterwards, and in extreme old
age was able to dispense with its glasses.
I am, Sir, yours faithfully,
LEMUEL LONGMIRE.
[We are delighted to have the
opportunity of recording an authentic
story of the phantasm of a cat. The
idea of a cat in spectacles may sound
odd, but have we not good historical
evidence cf a puss in boots? The
appearance of a cut in mid-air is re-
markable, but oxcasioral levitation

THE TRAGEDY of A CRUSTACEAN.
SIR,-When I was Secretary to the
Chilian Legation at Naples I had a
tame oyster which used to follow me
about all over the house, and feed from
my hand, emitting faint cries of
delight when I inserted a particularly
tasty morsel between its upper and
lower mandible, such as a spoonful of
ice pudding or a chocolate fondant.
My oyster—which bore a silver plate
on its back, inscribed with its name
(Lulu) and my own—was absent one
day, and was apparently lost, but as I
was dressing for dinner I heard a
faint squeak from the floor, and found
that I had trodden, as I believed, on
| my trusty bivalve. I could have
sworn to its presence, as it always
squeaked on the note of C sharp in alt,
but when I looked there was nothing
there. Next morning a fisherman
brought back Lulu stone dead. She
had been run over by a motor car the
previous evening at a distance of
some twelve miles from the Legation.
I am, Sir, yours faithfully,
ALFONso AGUARDIENTE.
[We always thought that oysters
were mute, but no doubt in the land
of bel canto the melodious environ-
ment may work wonders on the organ-
ism of crustaceans.—ED. Dictator.]
GRIMI TALE of THE GoLF LINRs.
SIR,-About three years ago, when
I was playing golf on some well-known
bunker which guards the Punch-bowl
fear, but, regaining my self-command,
I advanced on the tiger, waving my
niblick and singing “Rule Britannia.”
You may imagine my relief when the
monster melted into thin air, leaving
no trace of its presence but a slight
tigerish odour. That afternoon I learnt
that a tiger had escaped from a tra-
velling menagerie at Bangor, though it
was captured long before it could have
made its way to the links in question.
I am, Sir, yours faithfully,

[We congratulate our intrepid corre-
spondent on his fortunate escape from
a truly awe-inspiring predicament. No
one can say that Englishmen are
decadent when a golfer dares to face
a tiger with no better weapon than
a niblick. The choice of “ Rule
Britannia” was a real inspiration.
May we hazard the conjecture that
the tiger was attracted to the spot by a
natural confusion between links and
lynx?—ED. Dictator.]

No, not that; the graven memory

In the old days the game was diffi-

usual opening was to remark upon the
passing of another year, and the
increase of personal expenses. The
first move of the defence was to sit
back in speechless astonishment at the
insolence of the suggestion, and to say
“Pooh, pooh.” It being my turn

he would reply that I knew very well
how bad trade was just now, but that
after another year perhaps—and a look
of dreamy benevolence would steal into

would point out, by the aid of unmis-
takable figures, how much worse trade
would have been but for my labours,
and would state the minimum increase
of salary I could accept—the sum men-

hopes aspired to. With the benevo-
lence stealing away from his face, he
would snappily offer one-third of m
minimum, which I would reluctantly
accept; and my wife and I would
spend the evening at the theatre.
By some such methods I have come
to acquire an income enough for the
necessities of life. But in recent years

[MAY 31, 1911. -
THE POINT OF VIEW.
My mind, such as it was (and is)
refused to make itself up in the matter
of the 22nd of June, but there seemed to
be no reason why I shouldn't have a
non-committal look at the stand. So
I stood in a forest of planks and gave
myself up once more to the problem.
There was only one other idler in
the forest, and she was sitting on
Row C, Block A, and looking so cool
and comfortable that I hadn't the
heart to disturb her. But presently
she turned in my direction and waved
a friendly hand.
“Well?” I said, when I had made
my way across the jungle.
“I want three seats for the Corona-
tion Procession,” said Miss Middleton.
“It’s a secret.”
“How many people have you told?”
“Everybody in an apron whom you
can see, but they never let it get any
farther.”
“These are all carpenters. Buy a
saw or something, and come and have
tea with me. You oughtn't to be wan-
dering about alone.”
“I’ve got Mother somewhere.” She
smiled slowly to herself, and added,
“Mother is fun. It's lovely to have
her.”
“You must keep her,” I advised.
“She asked a very hot man with a
hammer if the Coronation Procession
came past here.” Miss Middleton
gazed up at the army of workmen busy
on tiers and tiers of seats, and sighed
happily to herself. “He was very
polite about it, and simply said that
they would all be most disappointed if
it didn't.” - - -
“Of course it might take the wrong
turning by mistake. Who leads it?
It's a most responsible position. I
expect he has to know London pretty
well.” - -
“They drive him over the course the
day before,” said Miss Middleton con-
fidently. “Oh, I nearly forgot,” she
went on. “At the other stand Mother
began, ‘I want to see some seats.” It
sounded lovely. If she had said, ‘I
want to see some church'—well, she is
fun.”
“At the other stand? Are you book-
ing seats in every stand 2 Isn't that
rather extravagant’ ”
“We never get as far as booking ; I
huve to come away long before then.
| Where do you think she is now 2 I
suppºse I ought to go and see.”
| “She's probably gone to have tea
with me. We'd better hurry back or
we shall miss her.”
“Well, we did sort of suggest it to
each other, only Mother said you
mightn't want us.”
-
“And what did you say?”
“I said you'd jolly well got to
have us.”
We made our way out of the stand
and turned in the direction of my rooms.
“We'd better get something for
tea,” I suggested. “Is there any par-
ticular kind of bun that Mrs. Middleton
likes 2 ”
“She likes just what I like,” said
Miss Middleton quickly.
We bought a lot of them and climbed
slowly up the stairs. There was no
trace of Mrs. Middleton on the way.
“She isn't here,” said Miss Middleton,
looking round the room,
“ Unless she's hiding behind the
revolving bookcase. No, no luck.”
“I wonder if I ought to stay.”
“I don't see what I can do with the
buns if you don't.”
“You see, I'm supposed to be help-
ing her buy seats for the Coronation
Procession.” She looked doubtfully
at me and then smiled.
“Did you say the Coronation Pro-
cession ?” I asked suddenly.
“Yes, that 's what I said.”
“But, my dear madam, you have
come to the very man. What sort of
seats did you want?”
“Wooden ones,” said Miss Middle-
ton, “with splinters.”
- “Well, of course, we have lots of
those. But what do you say to a nice
window 2
“A window 2"
“Yes, I will let you my little win-
dow.” And I waved a hand at it.
“But aren't windows very ex-
pensive 2"
“N-no, no I don't think so. A
thousand guineas—or five pounds—or ||
something like that. ... Refreshments
included, of course.”
“It's a nice lot of window,'
Miss Middleton, looking at it.
“It's only right that you should
sample the refreshments too,” I said as
I began to pour out the tea.
“I think mother would love
May I have a bun ?”
“Seeing that buns would be going
all the time,” I said as I handed her
the plate, “I consider a thousand
guineas cheap.”
“That would be for the 22nd and
the 23rd 2"
“Yes. After the 23rd we should
make a slight reduction.”
Miss Middleton ate and drank
thoughtfully for a little.
“I suppose,” she said, taking another
bun, “you 'd be having the window
cleaned about then 2''
“Bother, I hoped you wouldn't
notice that. The fact is, you've just
come on the wrong year. Now last
year But I dare say I could come

it.
to some special arrangement with my
landlord about it.”
Miss Middleton went to it and
looked out.
“But how funny,” she said. “I
didn't know the procession went past
here.” -
“It doesn't,” I admitted.
“That is rather against it,” she said
regretfully.
“Of course I should be prepared to
take that into consideration, if you
feel at all strongly about it. Suppose
we say eight hundred guineas.”
“Well, I'll mention it to Mother,
but I'm afraid—you see, she's so
particular.”
“It's only two hundred yards from
the route. She 'll be able to hear
everything.”
Miss Middleton smiled suddenly be.
hind her hat, as she bent over her
glove buttons. Then she smoothed out
her frock, looked wistſully at the last
bun and announced that she was ready.
“I'm sorry we couldn't arrange
about the seats,” she said as we went
into the street again. “But it was nice
of you to help Mother and me.”
“I esteem it a great privilege,” I
said, “to have been of any assistance
to Mrs. Middleton at a time like this.
Let's see, where did we leave her?"

Earnest Speaker (more eloquent than truthful). “AND I Ask You, ARE You GoING TO TAKA This LI'ING Dowy f"
Voice from audience. “No ; THE REPORTERS ARE Doi NG THAT."
ALL THE PREPARATIONS.
(By our own Special French Correspondent,
M. Jules Millefois.)
DEAR AND very HosourED CoNBROTHER,--First I give
you to understand I am not man to mix myself of the affairs
which are not mine. I should be worthy to be flanked to
the door. But this which you are preparing in London,
this Crownment of the KING GEORGE and of the QUEEN
MARY, it is the affair of all the world. Everybody can to
rejoice himself in it, and we other Frenches perhaps more
than all. So I have the honour to say to you that I accept
your obligeante offer. Only we will not say five guinees
for a letter. After all what is it a guinee ? Who serves
himself of a guinee 2. It is a piece abolished in England
and we do not know her in France. Let us say more-soon
two hundred francs. Is it convened 2 Good | Then I
have the heart free and I can commence.
Quant to my style I forecome you that it is my style to
me and it is not the style of the first come. They teach us
English at the Lycée. Bah, I mock myself of it. It is not
like that what one can learn to interhold himself in a
stranger language. All what I know I have insigned me
myself, it is well the case to say it, and now I speak and
write more curramently than my compatriots.
But to the work'
I have a chamber to couch all near of the Strand, not
an appartement, well understood, but an all small gite
where I have the honour to repose myself on your
count, my dear Mister, and to write my letters. It is
not big thing, but in fine it is suffisant. The lady of the
lodges is Mistress McAndrew, real type of the Scotch race,
meagre, dry, flat, to the tint brown and to the hairs eparsed.
I cannot understand her, but in revenge she cannot under-
stand me no more. Donc we are quits. She governs all
the house. Her married man dares not find nothing to
resay to it. He is a gross buffle, tall, to the shoulders
squared, to the red favorits and to the crane bald, but of a
baldness to inrhume oneself, bald as a morsel of ice.
There are two childs, a girl of fourteen years named Dolly,
of a figure full of taches of redness, nose retrussed and
teeth like tombeaus. The boy has twelve years, a young
John Bull of the most accentuated. He names himself Bill,
and has taken me in aversion. At that I yield him nothing.
This morning I hear these two who quarrel themselves on
the staircase. They bat themselves, they push some
terrible howlments. They go to it at cups of fist. It is as
if one had lashed the demons of the infer. Mistress
McAndrew is in the kitchen and cannot hear. Mister
McAndrew is in the cabaret. Me, I have well guard to
sort, occupied as I am in redacting a letter to my aunt in
Paris. They bat themselves pending five minutes, and
then I hear them who laugh and then they chuchote
together. But I hear them. They conspire to make
tumble something on my head in sorting. “Ah, little
scelerats,” I outcry me, “you will not dare!" and they
laugh again and esquive themselves. What a country
where the youngness manks of respect to the more aged
All to you of friendship,
JULES MILLEFois.

There is a fascinating rumour that, as a compliment to the KING, many gentlemen intend to grow beards during the Coronation Year.
Politically, the possibilities are most alluring, and our Artist proposes to anticipate (more or less intelligently) a few of them.
(Mr. A. BALFour, Lord WINTERTON, Mr. Asquith, Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, and Mr. H. CHAPLIN.)
House of Commons, Monday, May 22.
—Great happenings in progress and
to the fore. To-night Lords without
a division passed second reading of
Bill abolishing their hereditary right
to serve their country as legislators.
To-morrow they will have introduced
to their favourable notice another mea-
sure destroying their right of Veto.
In the Commons two days of the
week have been set apart for second
reading of National Insurance Bill,
which, supplementing the boon of Old
Age Pensions, will bring light and
warmth to countless homes.
Amid this whirl of events House of
Commons, faithful microcosm of public
opinion, can attend to only one thing
at a time. To-day it is the prospect
of baving its pocket filled with salary
of £400 a year. Satisfaction keener
since the abundance of the blessing
unexpectel. Sum first fixed upon was
£300. Almost at last moment, certainly
within two days of Budget speech, extra
£100 thrown in.
This full of hopeful augury. Amid
cloud of questions addressed to
CHANCELLOR to-night BonAR LAw
suggested salary should be doubled.
LLOYD GEORGE, who, having mastered
Golf, is learning Bridge, answered in
effect: “I leave it to you, partner.”
As he pointed out, control of Finance
is in hands of the House, and if
Members wish to double, or even treble,
their salaries it is their affair.
He might have added quotation of a
precedent for such course. Members
of the French Chamber were originally
in receipt of salaries of 9,000 francs a
year, equal to something like £360 of
our money. Four years ago a Member
of the Left moved to increase the
indemnité to 15,000 francs, anglice
£600. On a snapped division the
motion was carried, and is in vogue
to-day. The principle accepted, what
has been done in Paris may be brought
about in London.
Meanwhile, the £400 as good as
pouched, Members already asking for
more. Why not free passes? The wily
WEDGwood, totting up figures, comes
to conclusion that if Railway Managers
are so unpatriotic, so soulless, as to
refuse to supplement beneficence of
taxpayers by the bounty of share-
holders a good bargain would be struck
if the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
in leisure moments would negotiate
purchase of first-class passes available
on all the railways of the Kingdom on
payment of £100 a year docked from
Members' wages. As the wary WEDG-
wood whispered to Members near him,

actually be something less than a £100.
The other night Members heard with
disappointment deepening to disgust,
announcement by
ExchequER that Income Tax would
be deducted from their salaries.
“Very well,” says WEDGwood to
MoRRELL, who has temporarily quitted
his residence in the area. “You see
how it works. Income tax on £100
at current ruinous rate is £5 16s. 8d.
Accordingly we shall be paying for our
passes not a £100, but £94 3s. 4d.

MoRRELL said he would like to think
area to do so.
Business don”. –Members, elate with
prospect of riches beyond the dream
of avarice, began week by giving them-
selves half-holiday. Budget Resolu-
tions brought up on Report stage.
Usually occupies two or three days,
frequently a whole week. To-night
House up shortly after half-past six,
not only having disposed of Resolu-
tions but read Finance Bill a first time.
Tuesday.—Like head of Charles I.
in Mr. Dick's memorial, question of
payment of Members thrusts itself
in at unexpected times and places.
BENNETT-GoLDNEY asks CHAIRMAN OF
KITCHEN CoMMITTEE whether, in view
of changed conditions following on pay-
ment of Members, the cost of meals
will be placed on a more businesslike
footing. MARK Lockwood, assuming
the lofty judicial manner pertaining to
his high office, cautiously answered
that, when the changes alluded to
become law, he will endeavour to find
out whether Members desire to spend
an increased portion of their income on
food. -
IIereupon the greedy disposition
developed by the unfortunate pledge
to which Ministers have committed
themselves manifested itself afresh.
BURDETT-Coutts wanted to know
| whether arrangements could not be
made whereby free lunches might be
| served in the dining-room. KILBRIDE
followed with what appeared irrelevant
suggestion that, with a view to deco-
rating the tables of the dining-room,
the Government should secure the
return of the Dublin Castle Crown
Jewels. House, seeming to find per-
sonal point in this dark saying, laughed
consumedly. Lockwood obdurate. No
free lunches—at least for the present.
Business done.—Irish Wotes in Com-
mittee of Supply.

election his attendance, once constant,

was ever a marvel that the House
should roar with laughter at appar-
ently pointless remarks. , His success
was, perhaps, largely to be accounted
for on the score of paternal vanity.
In appearance and manner one of the
solemnest of mankind, inspired solely
by honest desire to serve the interests
of his constituency, the House insisted
upon regarding him as a humorist.
Having adopted the fancy it persisted
in living up to it, laughing merrily
whenever the man from Ross and
Cromarty rose to put a question to
the Scotch Minister.
Often he had half-a-dozen in suc-

increasing solemnity of , tone and

in his boots. In due time through
the hushed Chamber resounded a deep
chest-note slowly enunciating the
words, “Mr. SPEAKER, Sir; I beg to
ask the Right Hon. Gentleman, the
SECRETARY FOR Scotland, ques-ti-on
No. 79.”
By way of increasing importance of
occasion he always made “question"
a word of three syllables.
Nor did he, having put his question,
forthwith drop into his seat as others
use. With another sweep of the arm
he removed the pince-nez, glanced
round to watch the effect of his
interposition, and, slowly subsiding,
stared haughtily at Members rolling
about on their seats in ecstasy at a
little comedy that never palled. 1.
Such were his mannerisms. In the
man there must have been sterling
merit. Representative of the crofters
of Ross and Cromarty, whilst others
standing higher in public esteem

with increased majority. At the last
General Election he was returned
unopposed.

DICKENS POST-MARKS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Having chanced,
in a recent re-perusal of The Post-
humous Papers of the Pickwick Club,
upon a few passages that provoked a
marginal query or comment, I venture
to send some of them to you, knowing
that your readers are one and all
sealed of the tribe of Boz. I copy them
in the order in which I find them.
Chapter I. Surely it is rather a pity
that DICKENs never re-wrote this open-
ing. Everything changed so quickly
after it—humanity swept in and farce
hurried out—that it is almost a blot.
Nothing, for example, in Mr. Pickwick's
after-life suggests that he was ever
interested in the tittlebats of the
Hampstead Ponds.
DICKENs, of course, had comic sport-
ing pictures to live up to at the start.
SEYMoUR, their artist, soon died and
left him free. This makes it the more
strange that he never re-shaped the
beginning. Nothing but his genius can
atone for it. Had he done so he would
have told us more to explain the attrac-
tion—by no means patent—that Mr.
Tupman, Mr. Snodgrass, and Mr.
Winkle had for Mr. Pickwick.
Question.—Why is Mr. Snodgrass
called a poet? Why was no specimen
of his poetry given 2
Question.—What had been Mr. Pick-
wick's business 2
Chapter II. Had he revised the
book, DICKENs would have got more
| reality into the following passage.
Mr. Jingle is speaking:—
“‘Here, waiter!’” shouted the stran-
ger, ringing the bell with tremendous
violence, ‘glasses round—brandy-and-
water, hot and strong, and sweet, and
plenty.—Eye damaged, sir?—Waiter!
raw beef-steak for the gentleman's
eye.—Nothing like raw beef-steak for
a bruise, sir: cold lamp-post very good,
but lamp-post inconvenient—damned
odd standing in the open street half an
hour with your eye against a lamp-
post, eh—very good—ha, ha!” And
the stranger, without stopping to take
breath, swallowed at a draught full
half a pint of the reeking brandy-and-
water, and flung himself into a chair
with as much ease as if nothing un-
common had occurred.”
Now, the terrific speed of Jingle's
utterances is always insisted upon,
| which gives no time whatever for the
preparation of hot brandy and water
for four gentlemen during the actual
progress of this speech.
Chapter IV. We owe the unfortun-
ate predicament of the Pickwickians
at the Review entirely to the original
and false scheme of the book.
Is it credible that Mr. Wardle ever

GOIN' To BUY ANY 1"

had been, as he says he was, an
occasional guest of the Pickwick Club?
Chapter V. How did the Pick-
wickians' luggage get to the Manor
Farm, Dingley Dell?
Chapter VII. DICKENs was no
cricketer.
Chapter X. What was the status
of Miss Rachel Wardle on returning to
the Manor Farm 2 It is significant
that she is not there when the Pick-
wickians return from Cheshire.
Chapter XI. I fancy that the anti-
quarian discovery was a piece of old
copy in DICKENs's pigeon-holes before
he began this book, and he took this
opportunity for working it off.
Chapter XII. All deadweight and
lumber have been thrown overboard
now. The great epic begins here and
never again falters.
Chapter XV. Will no one write a
specimen chapter or so of Count Smorl-
tork's book? This chapter gives the
best opportunity for one of Mr. Snod-
grass's poems—a complimentary ad-
dress to Mrs. Leo Hunter.
Chapter XXII. How did Mr. Pick-
wick come to have his nightcap with
him 2
Chapter XXV. Here DICKENs nods
badly in the matter of chronology, for,
after stating that the rebellious school-
boys of Ipswich had dispersed to cricket,
he makes the Pickwickians separate
for a few days only before spending
Christmas at Wardle's.
Chapter XXXI. Would so astute a
lawyer as Mr. Perker showed himself
in the Eatanswill elections have briefed
Mr. Phunky at all?
These are of course only spots on a
glorious—to my mind, increasingly
glorious—sun. Yours, A. B. C.

AT THE PLAY.
“MARGARET CATCHPOLE.”
To my regret—for it contained a part
peculiarily adapted to Mr. LAURENCE
IRVING's best manner—there would
seem to have been features in his last
enterprise, The Lily, which made it
miss popular success. The last time
I saw it the audience was thin and
stony. So now, in Margaret Catchpole
(one had almost said Catchvote) he has
| gone all out, with a candour that
| savours of cynicism, for the suffrages
of the less expensive seats. Sitting in
! the last row of the stalls, where the
ºf enthusiasm of the pit took me full in
the back of the neck, I can vouch for
his triumph in that
quarter. I was not in
an equally good posi-
tion for gauging the
| emotion of the stalls,
but I shall allow my-
| self to doub; if the
| Higher Intelligences
| will be appeased with
| this melodrama. For
iſ melodrama it con-
| fessedly is, and Mr.
LAURENCE IRVING
means that you should
know it as such, and
not mistake it for ro-
mantic drama. To this
| end he has set forth,
on an old-fashioned
broadsheet, an epitome
of events, thus:– “Will
Laud is drowned" (he
wasn't really)—“Mar-
garet's anguish —
“Alone, alone in the
world—alone, alone!'"
And again; “The
Struggle on the Cliff.
Hurled to Destructicn.
‘Ahoy! - Ahoy!' Safety for Margaret
and Jim . . . . The tangled skein of
years at last unravelled. The path of
life opened to loving feet.”
The full style of the play is
“A new, exciting, vivacious and
spectacular Drama, entitled The Life
and Adventures of Margaret Catch-
pole.” And indeed it is all this, being
founded upon a career unusually
coloured by romantic adventure. To
cope with its vivacity Mr. IRVING had
to invoke the aid of the cinematograph,
an animated tableau, and two inani-
mate pictures of Australian scenery.
The cinematograph presented Margaret
Catchpole committing her historic
theft of “Crop,” and riding him, full
gallop, in groom's attire and posture,
from Ipswich to Lambeth. -

But if she did leave this feat to an

all the time, and if it had been
asked of her I am confident that
she would have committed before
our eyes that deed of heroism (what-
ever it was, for I missed the particulars)
which earned for her—an escaped con-

how many costumes, male and female,
she wore—a feature in her performance
to which Mr. IRVING made poignant
reference in a pleasant First-night
Speech. But this was only a small
part of her task; she carried the whole
play on her nice shoulders, and was
always charming, sweet-voiced and
natural, except when she had from
time to time an attack of rhetoric; and
that was no fault of hers. -
Mr. IRVING was content to efface him-
self in a part (that of a common Surrey-
side villain), on which his sensitive
intelligence was thrown away. Mr.
GoDFREY TEARLE, as a sham hero
with an amateur taste for smuggling,
played with restraint, and escaped
the terrible charge of “breeziness.”
He made a good figure, but will have
to do something with his own well-
kempt head of hair, which was out of the
picture. Much relief to our nervous
tension was afforded by the quiet but
sailorly humour of Mr. FIELD FishFR,
who, first as a smuggler and then—
after his services had been secured by
the press-gang—as a gallant tar in the
fighting Navy of KING GEORGE III.,
was always a godsend. So was Mr.
PERcy NASH, as Philip, a footman with
leanings towards pedantic phraseology
and other aspirations. (To him we
owe the information, conveyed with
a fine dignity, that Australia is “in
the Hantipódes.") It was a happy
chance that brought so many old
favourities together again in the final
Act in the house of the Governor of
New South Wales, for they had all
sº been in the neighbour-
hood of Ipswich when
we saw them last. Even
Miss AMy EANCHETTE,
the buxom and sym-
pathetic hostess of the
Dog and Bone at Lam-
beth, reappeared out
there (unless my eyes
deceived me) in a differ-
ent rôle and with her
name thinly disguised
in the programme. ..I
hardly doubt that the
villain and the false
hero would have been
prepared to turn up too,
only they were both
lying dead at the foot
of a cliff on the coast of
East Anglia. That, by
the way, was a great
struggle on the cliff's
edge; but the argu-
ments with which it
was punctuated were
ill-judged. It was no
time nor place for dia-
lectics.
Altogether, if we except the Austra-
lian appendix, which seemed rather
loosely attached, the play went very
well, with a swift and easy action; and,
for what it set out to be, offered an
exceptionally small scope for ridicule.
All the same I have my fears for its
future; for Melodrama has its own
recognized haunts; and of none of
these is the address to be found ia
St. Martin's Lane. When, therefore,
I wish success to Mr. LAURENCE
IRVING's adventure—as who does not ?
—the relation of my thought to that
wish is of a strictly filial character.
By the way, I must find out where
the Duke of York management gets its
candles from. I want some like them
—like those two in the First Act,
which were stuck in stone bottles. I
had not noticed their illuminative
power till they were extinguished (it is

And, hasting toward that “lie” unseen
With anxious mind, she came
To where the bay gleams blue between
The gorse's golden flame;
Where, in a sunny glimpse, one sees
Brown sails and sea-birds' wings,
And where his love-taught lutanies
The nesting linnet sings.
Pausing a moment's space apart,
The footling lie forgot,
She felt the pulse from Beauty's heart—
And bunkered balls were not.
I saw the frown that marred her fade,
With thoughts of medalled fame:
She guessed that regal Nature played
A still more “ancient game.”

Of tree-flowers and young silken leaves
The moonlight filtered through.
Inside, with rosy silks arrayed,
Lost to that lovely sight,
With deadly earnestness she played—

But while her solemn partner dealt
She heard the night-bird sing,

MR. PUNCH'S suPPLEMENT.
VII.-The BRITISH Museum. "
THE recent appointment of a scholarly
guide to lecture on some of the more
remarkable and picturesque of its
rarities having drawn all eyes to
what Lord Avebury once wittily called
the Bloomsbury Treasure House, it
has been felt that Mr. Punch's readers
must not be kept any longer from a
history of that institution (for it is an
institution).
History.
The British Museum naturally is not
very old. A lot has to happen before
the time comes to collect ruins in a
museum. Hence the authorities waited
for Assyria and Egypt, Greece and
Rome to vanish as powers before they
began at all. This was very wise.
The opening year at last fixed upon
was 1759, by which time a consider-
able body of history had accumulated
worthy of record. In those days the
museum was at Montagu House. The
present building was completed in
1847, as it was found that without
some such haven of refuge as the portico
offers London might have no pigeons
left.
t UMBRELLAs.
Such is the acquisitive zeal that
permeates this wonderful place that
everyone who enters is at once asked
to deposit his (or her) umbrella. Were
none of these reclaimed it is estimated
that the British Museum would by
now have the finest collection of
umbrellas in the world. Such investi-
gations of them as the curator of the
Umbrella Department (Sir Hume E.
Dye) and his staff of trained and
meticulously courteous assistants wish
to make never last more than an hour
or so, and the umbrellas are returned
to their owners. The system of identi-
fication is so exact that the chances of
getting a better one than your own
have been worked out by Mr. HARPER
(late of the L.C.C. and now an unpaid
official, but still, we hope, a capable
statistician) at 3007 to 1.
THE PRINT ROOM.
The Print Room, famous for its
poetical staff, is in the charge of Sir
SIDNEY Colvin, who has won the
Museum billiard handicap, played after
hours in a room in the third Assyrian
Court, for several years running. Sir
SIDNEY, it has been well said, knows a
print when he sees one. Since it is a
point of honour with every Museum
official to write a book, Sir SIDNEY has
compiled a charming volume of the
letters of STEvenson, the professional
billiard champion, whose epistolary
style, especially in a series of billets
douz to Miss Jane Long (known as
Long Jenny), is hardly less attractive
than that of his cue. Among Sir
SIDNEY's colleagues is Mr. BINYoN, the
poet and the author (although, in view
of his apparent youth, the fact is not
generally suspected) of the Death of
Adam. In the Print Room—if you are
lucky enough to find it—you may see
prints; and nowhere are the officials so
unfailing in their courtesy to visitors.
THE ELGIN MARBLEs.
The Elgin Marbles (in which the
“g" is pronounced soft, as in Bingen-
on-the-Rhine) were acquired by the dis-
tinguished art-dealer, THoMAs BRUCE,
Seventh Earl of Elgin. They represent
the manufactures of Elgin, which, ac-
cording to the latest official reports,
consist of watches and watch cases,
butter and other dairy products, cooper-
age (especially butter tubs), canned
corn, shirts, pipe organs and caskets.
The city, we may add, is the seat of
the Northern Illinois Hospital for the
Insane. Sir Alley Taw, the keeper
of the marbles, is a very paragon of
courtesy.
THE POLICE.
A Museum without policemen would
be like the play of Omelette without
the egg, as the Frenchman said. The
British Museum has many fine,
sturdy, well-set-up fellows who know
an anarchist or futurist a mile
off, and would die sooner than allow
a thief to carry away the Rosetta
Stone. Many, it is true, have tried,
but no one has got farther than the
entrance hall.
MANUSCRIPTs.
The collection of MSS., which are
under the safe care of Dr. WARNER,
ranges from specimens of the calli-
graphy of ancient Egyptian scribes to
the originals of Mr. HALL CAINE's
novels. The latter are guarded night
and day by special custodians imported
from the Isle of Man, and can only be
examined by persons who have received
a special permit from the Keeper of
British Enormities. . The courtesy of
Dr. WARNER and his assistants is a
by-word in Bloomsbury.
EGYPTology.
It is notorious that nothing can
exceed the courtesy of the chief of
the Egyptian Department, Sir ERNEST
WALLIs BUDGE, or Sir BUDGE, as dis-
tinguished foreigners persist in calling
him. Not even a lifetime spent among
mummies and sarcophagi has in any
way impaired his native sunniness, and
even the recurring facetious query of
Cockney visitors, on the first Monday
in August, as to how and when
CLEOPATRA copped the needle, leaves
him radiant and kind. . The result
is that few visitors interested in
Egyptology leave the museum without
entering Sir BUDGE's department.
Such is his versatility that he presides
also over the Assyrian relics; and the
same remarks apply to them. Sir
BUDGE is the author of more books
than any of his colleagues, which is
saying a good deal. He is also the
editor of The Isis.
THE READING Room. - " -
It has been computed that were the
British Museum reading-room to be
closed for a year all the dealers in
remainder copies of books would be
bankrupt. It is therefore kept open.
The Principal Librarian is Sir FREDE.
RICK G. KENYoN–a gentleman whose
courtesy to strangers and inquirers is
unequalled in any other department.
The peculiarity of the room in which
sits the Keeper of the Printed Books—
Sir G. K. ForTEscue—is that, singe
every inch of the wall, doors and all, is
covered humorously with real or
imitation books, once you are in you
cannot find the way out. Apart from
this nothing can exceed the courtesy
of this official, to whose zeal in keep-
ing the printed books must be attributed
the fact that one so often cannot get
what one asks for in the reading-room.
Fog.
Although the wisdom of the world
is stored in the British Museum it has
not taught its officials (who are
courtesy itself) any way of dealing
with fog. No sooner does this Novem-
ber visitant arrive in Bloomsbury than
all search for books in the basement
ceases and hundreds of readers are
thrown out of work. And yet there
are little electric hand-torches for such
difficulties in every stores list at a
trifling cost.
FEEs.
There is no charge for leaving the
British Museum. No tips are allowed.
Any head of department discovered in
the act of receiving sixpence or a
shilling is instantly dismissed. It was
his readiness to accept such sums in
defiance of the rules that led to the
loss of that otherwise valuable public
servant, Sir O. Penpalm, one of the
most courteous men who ever had
charge of Chaldean postage-stamps.
THE FUTURE OF THE MUSEUM.
It is considered probable, by com-
petent vaticinators, that in about five
years' time the pick of the Blooms-
bury treasures will be located at Pitts-
burg. . . . - t

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
SIR ARTHUR CoNAN Doyle does not go altogether as
a stranger into the “region between actual story and
actual history, which,” as he says in the preface to The
Last Galley (SMITH, ELDER), “has never been adequately
exploited.” His book, Rodney Stone, was a clever essay in
this field, giving as it did a vivid picture of the great days
of the boxing ring. In his latest volume he has worked less
ambitiously, though he hints at something greater to come.
He gives a series of ten brief “impressions,” based on
facts dotted up and down the long stretch of years during
which the Roman Empire was the world. He has coloured
these facts with “the glamour which the writer of fiction
can give,” and he has produced a set of very readable
stories which help one to form a conception of affairs as
they may have existed at that time. I don't know that it
is anything against them that the glamour is in some cases
derived rather from the possible than the probable. He
relates, for instance, the meeting of THEoDoRA and her son.
It is generally believed that this versatile lady lost no time
in removing from the sight of the world, and of her husband
JUSTINIAN, all trace of so untimely a reminder of her
early adventurous career. Sir ARTHUR, giving her a sudden
access of maternal affection, rescues the boy from the very
brink of the underground well to which he had been
doomed, and sends him back to the monastery in Antioch
whence he came. Nobody knows exactly what did happen,
so this is conceivably true, but personally I doubt it.
Again, he makes of MAXIMIN a bluff, honest sort of
barbarian soldier, who an hour before the thing occurred
had no idea of becoming emperor. This also may be true,
though for my part I put my money on the other side of
the picture.
To choose a district of old France,
To strike a path where paths are few,
To leave his resting-place to chance,
Take what it gives and start anew ;
To quaff the country's local drink,
To chaff its people, maid or man—
Such things HILAIRE BELLoc, I think,
Can tackle as no other can.
It makes no sort of odds to me
Whether afoot he makes his way,
As just himself, to wit H. B.,
And sees the France we know to-day;
Or whether, in some borrowed guise,
As, say, a military gent,
He sees it with historic eyes—
No matter which, I'm well content.
The Girondin (from NELsoN) shows
The second case: it brings to view
A mounted sergeant in the throes
Of war in 1792;
He roughs it with a cheerful smile,
Gets in the end a nasty knock,
As soldiers will, yet all the while
You know that he's HILAIRE BELLoo.
IN one respect, at least, Dr. J. MoRGAN-DE-GRoot, the
author of The Hand of Venus (Hutchinson), is deserving of
the honour reserved for them who resist great temptation.
Some time before the opening of the story, he tells us that

Among the mourning pageantry you paced, Than thus to rule a people proud and free,
Dimly aware what splendours of the scene For whom you stand as symbol of a race
By Death's enfolding shadow lay effaced ; Heirs to the ancient lordship of the sea;
A King that nursed his private grief apart, . . . .sº So on this day, when Peace may lightly wear
Nor comfort from his kingly state could borrow, - - The warrior trophies won from sterner ages,

Mid silent greetings hushed to share your sorrow. Of ampler revelry in these our pages.

Crowned and anointed King, once more you come, A touch of humour something over-bold;
And Grief fulfilled recalls her backward gaze, If, for relief, we ask the latitude
And Joy unlocks our lips that then were dumb ; Allowed to licensed jesters from of old;
Glad heart and voice, we greet your proven worth, Delieve me, Sire, in all your faithful isle
Whose courage, called to meet the test of royalty, None pays a fealty more profound and ſervent
By better elaims than any right of birth Than he who here appends his name and style—
Has earned the homage of our love and loyalty. Than Punch, your Majesty's most loyal servant.

Mr. Punch’s
Gala Variety Entertainment.
<=i-coe}=
HEREAS Their Majesties KING GEORGE and QUEEN MARY have shown a gracious
interest in the Art of the Music Hall, Now this is to say that Mr. Punch proposes
to offer to Their Majesties an opportunity of attending a Gala Variety Entertainment
of his own. So sanguine is he of being able to persuade Their Majesties to assist at
his Fête, that he has already engaged an extraordinarily talented cast, and drawn
up a thoroughly exhaustive programme. As to the date, everything will depend upon
Their Majesties' pleasure, but it may be confidently asserted that it will not be
allowed to clash with the actual Coronation.
Mr. Punch, accompanied by some of the QUEEN's Maries, will himself receive the KING and QUEEN (always supposing
that Their Majesties are present), and a bouquet, consisting of “silver bells and cockle shells, and pretty maids all of a
row,” will be presented to the QUEEN by “Mary, Mary, all contrary,” who will be supported by another Mary—the
one with the pet lamb.
The National Anthem once played and Their Majesties comfortably seated, a short interval will be allowed for
staring, but no pointing will be permitted. Mr. Punch will then deliver a Prologue composed by one of his woung fellows.
išft||||||||||
§
º: º -
The final touches have not yet been given to this masterpiece, and, indeed, much will be left to the inspiration of
the moment and the individuality of the prompter. But, roughly, the idea will be as follows:—
Prologue.
Your Majesties, your Royal Highnesses, Oh for a Muse of fire (as SHAKSPEARE said,
Also (if present) your Serenities, But cannot now repeat it, being dead),
Your Graces, Lordships, Ladyships—in short, Oh for a Muse that could aspire to sing
Ladies and Gentlemen of ev'ry sort A fitting ode of welcome to our KING,
(The Press included), welcome to our show, To offer neatly, at the very start,
Now, aſter months of labour, on the go. The tribute of a most devoted heart.

Oh for a something else with which to greet

And dwell upon the circles for a bit !
It needs a demi-god—half Milton, half
Reporter on the Daily Telegraph.
A mortal overwhelmed by your effulgence
Can only crave your very kind indulgence;
Let me, instead, foreshadow the surprises
We spring upon you when the curtain rises.
My task is rendered lighter by the fact
That many of you, with consummate tact,
Have bought and favoured with at least a glance
The special programme issued in advance—
Meaning, of course, that enemy to slumber,
My Extra-special Coronation Number. [Advt.
You know that soon, unless the curtain sticks,
You'll see a masque of Art and Politics,
A feast of Fun and Fantasy and things—
Possibly, too, the prompters in the wings.
Georges of every kind will take their calls
Hoping for recognition from the stalls;
Newton himself, no less, and other Lords
Will make a first appearance on the boards;
History will affect the modern manner
And Mr. CHURCHILL sing to the pianner;
While at the finish I myself may take
The chance of thanking those of you awake.
Now, if the carpenters have stopped their banging,
And if the manager has finished slanging
The carpenters, and if the double bass
Will kindly hurry up and find the place,
Then let the curtain rise upon a night
Of unexampled splendour and delight.
After a short but adequate interval for applause the
performance proper will commence; and of this Mr.
Punch has pleasure in issuing herewith a preliminary
Illustrated Programme.
His pictures are based upon representations made by his
performers as to the nature of their turns and do not
pretend to be an historic record of events that have not yet
occurred. No person will therefore be permitted to claim
his money back at the doors on the plea that any turn
(or turns) differed materially from the counterfeit present-
ment (or presentments) of it (or them). Mr. Punch also
reserves to himself the right to supplement his Preliminary
Programme (though this is, humanly speaking, improbable),
or to withdraw any turn of which the performer proves, at
rehearsal, to be less good than he said he was going to be.
The Programme will begin with some
Variety Turns,
1. Mr. GRAHAME-WHITE, in a self made biplane, accom
panied by warlike music, will manoeuvre over the audience
and undertake to drop a couple of conſetti on the head ot
the German Naval Attaché.
2. Mr. F. E. SMITH will sing: “I'm shy, Mary Ellen,
I'm shy.”
3. Lord Newton will give his inimitable sketch, “How
I made even the Peers laugh.”
4. Mr. A. B. WALKLEY, dramatic critic of The Times, will
deliver, in Attic Greek with a French accent, a dissertation
on “Aristophanny's First Play.” At the same time Mesdames
MELBA and TETRAzzINI, who refuse to appear apart, will
simultaneously sing Altiora peto, each going as she pleases.
Mr. F. E. Smith will sing: “I’m shy, Mary Ellen, I'm shy.”
5. Mr. Oscar Asche will give a demonstration of
First Aid, exhibiting the “Kismet” system of holding a
drowning man under water till he has stoppel drowning.
6, Mr. (who desires at present to remain name-
less) will write a cheque for 4.5, ooo in favour of a charity
(to be chosen by Mr. Punch), on condition that his name be
announced from the proscenium in clear and bell-like tones.
During this performance, Mr. Somerser MAUGHAM will
write a complete new play, and Miss Lily Elsie will waltz
up a salmon-ladder with the Master of ELIBANK.
7. M. MAETERLINck and Lord Avebury will conduct
an exhibition bee-fight (one bee a-side), after which the
latter will oblige with “I know a Bank.”
and this form of entertainment will be

10. Mr. GARVIN, Editor of The Observer, will give a selection (the
whole is far too long) from his popular Ventriloquial Sketch, “The
Power behind the Peerage.” In the event of an encore he will bring
on Mr. W. WALDORF Astor, and they will sing together as the
“Dollar Duettists” in “For Hever and for Hever.”
11. Lord Rosebery, wearing the yellow primrose of a detached life,
will recite a parody of “The House that Jack built,” entitled “The
House that Archibald re-built.” At the same time Mr. NEIL PRIM-

It has been widely felt that many famous Historical Episodes would take on an entirely new aspect if they
could be re-enacted under present conditions.
Great disabilities have notoriously been suffered by distinguished people
through living in some other century than the twentieth A.D.; and from these Studies in Applied Modernity (arranged by
well-known experts) it is hoped that a moral lesson may be drawn for those who are too apt to imagine that the old
times were the most convenient.

RUNCIMAN will perform his staggering feat of “Squaring the Circular.”
31. Mr. MAX BEERBOHM, Mr. MAx PEMBERTON, Sir HERBERT MAxwell,
Dr. MACNAMARA, Mr. Swift MACNEILL, Sir HIRAM MAxiM, and Mr. LFo
MAXSE, having been gazetted, for Coronation purposes, as the Seven Macs,
will sing in unison Wordsworth's poem on this hallowed numeral.
32. Mr. ARTHUR BALFour will introduce his famous troupe of Cecilians,
and Lord Ugo will undertake to bite off the ear of any member of the
Cabinet who cares to come up on to the stage for this purpose.
33. Mr. GILBERT CHESTERTON, Lord Michelh AM, Mr. EUGENE WASON
and Sir Edward Poy NTER will dance a solemn Pavane. In the event of
an encore Lord Michelh AM will reappear alone and give his famous serio-
comic rendering of Robert BURNS's eulogy of the proletariate—
“The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
The man's the gowd for a’ that.”
Rajeepeat-
º
Sir Sherbet Beerbohm Tree
dispenses midsummer iced drinks.
34. Lord HowARD DE WALDEN will appear in his amusing monologue, “The Draper's Assistant" (after the late DAN LENo).
35. Eight well-known Harley Street
physicians will illustrate the dietetic
value of Standard Oil, showing how
its health-giving properties cnable
even a sardine to live beautifully for
days with its head off. The title of
their exhibition will be “Grace in
the Grease.” During this turn, Earl
WINTERTON, to mark the festal
occasion by an act of self-effacement,
will appear behind the scenes as a
“shout off.”
36. At 3.0 A.M., whether the
programme is completed or not,
Mr. Pºnch will bring the proceed-
ings to a close with a brief Epilogue,
in which he will embody a toast. For
the purpose of this toast, Sir SHERBET
BEERBOHM TREE, supported by his
company of Shakspeare Revivalists,
will dispense midsummer iced drinks.
The Alcoholic Department will be
under the management of Mr.
HiLAIRE BELLoc, attired as Chief
Cellarer in non-particoloured hose.
Epilogue.
Well, you've had the whole concern—
And, if here and there a turn
Fell comparatively flat,
We must not complain of that,
Seeing that it so occurred
No performer “got the bird."
Thank you, then, for this. And now,
Ere I make my final bow—
Only one more bow at most–
I.et us drink a loyal toast
(It will look a trifle neater
Put into another metre):
“The KING, God bless him 17-ar
Alex '" And Greater
Britain will echo, “Pivat Rev ºf
Imperator!”

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“THE DAILY EVENING'S’’
PR ZE CORONATION ODE.
BALHAM MAN wiNs FIRST PLACE.
THE entry for this competition has
been gratifying in the extreme. Five
thousand and seventy-seven odes have
been sent in, and naturally the task of
adjudication has been no easy one.
Perhaps a short statement as to our
method of arriving at the final verdict
will be of interest to our readers. In
the first place the entries were gone
through by a trained cashier, who
extracted the postal-orders and con-
signed to the waste-paper basket those
which did not comply with this
trifling but necessary formality. That
done, and the money safely lodged in
the bank, the senior office-boy (a
bright lad and a leading authority on
the Cinematographic Drama) was
entrusted with the preliminary weed-
ing out. Acting upon instructions, he
carefully separated those of loyal and
patriotic schtiment from those which
displaycd Anarchistic leanings, and
further reduced the number of “possi-
bles" by rejecting those containing
French ihymes—the conductors o'
this competition being firmly of the
opinion that entries of strictly all-
British workmanship alone should be
considered. A printer's reader next
glanced through the residuum with an
eye to grammar and spelling, and by
this means a final batch of fifty was
reserved for the judges' examination.
For this difficult and responsible
function we were fortunate enough to
secure the services of Lord FROHMAN
and Sir IMRF. KIRALFY.
One of the most serious reproaches
levelled against English literature in
recent years has at last been rolled
away, and that in the most decisive and
incontrovertible fashion. For some
time past we have had it dinned into
our ears, both in and out of season,
that our poets are dead. We have no
hesitation in affirming that the present
year, crowded as it is likely to be with
political and other events of the first
importance, will be remembered by
posterity chiefly as the year of the
great poetic renaissance in Great Britain
and her dependencies.
It must not, of course, be supposed
that all the entries reached the high-
water mark attained by the winning
ode, printed below. A very large num-
ber, however, exhibited here and there
distinct gleams of genius. It is difficult,
for instance, to imagine anything at
once more simple and arresting than
the following, the opening verse of an
ode that comes all the way from the
Solomon Islands:–
From Finsbury to Fiji,
From Clapham to Cawnpore,
We hail thee King and (D.G.)
India's Emperor.
Of very considerable merit was the
work of another Colonial competitor, in
which, however, there was a little too
much sacrifice of dignity for the sake of
effective rhyming, as in the following:—
Let the cheers echo from coast unto coast;
Bitons, your loyalest hullabaloo raise
Utter the loudest of “ Hilº," and the most
Frenzied of “Hoºrays" !
wºrrºw-
arre,
A SUGGESTION To AID THE PolicE IN CARRY.
ING OU tº the recent Order to ExCLUDE Aero-
NAUTs FROM THE Corox Ation RouTE.
The word “hullabaloo" is perhaps
hardly the right term for the expression
of a nation's patriotic fervour.
From a lady competitor comes a
tender poem giving utterance to the
feelings of her sex towards the KING in
his quality of naval officer. There is a
subtle reminiscence of a popular ballad
in the lines:—
Of British girlhocd's heart thou art the gaoler,
For all our nicest maidens love a sailor.
And there are some fine moments in
the ode which, headed “To George W.:
A Regalia. Rhapsody,” opens thus:—
What is the crown we crown thee with to-day,
Whose brilliance fairly takes our breath away?
A golden circlet set with handsome
Gems, each of which is worth a royal ransom.
The corrective bathos in the last line
is very convincing. The only other
poem we have space to mention is one
whose prolixity is but partially atoned
for by flashes of inspiration in such
lines as–
George for his England, England for her George 1
and
The pyrotechnics of a people's pride.
After deep consideration we have
awarded the first prize to Mr. J.
Milton Slopp, of 725, Laurel Avenue,
Balham, S.W., whose fine achieve-
ment is here given:—
GEORGE, thro 'gh thy Empire's boundless
traits
All eyes to-day are turned on thee
And on the interesting facts
Connected with thy pageantry.
When from thy crowning thou art come,
And all the solemn pomp is o'er,
The telegraphic wires will hum
As they have never hummed before.
And then a hundred million throats,
Making the woull-wide welkin ring,
Will loyally essay the notes
That summon Heav'n to save the King.
On thee our steadfast gaze we fix;
And in thine honour for to-day
Britons confound their politics
And brush their diff'rences away.
No talk of People versus Peers,
Of those who toil and those who slack;
Dustman and Duke unite their cheers
And slap each other on the back.
And after—when the flags are furled,
And all the festive trappings down—
Shall England then confront the word
More bravely for thy kingly crown
Oh, yes—a thousand times, oh,
For through the Empire's
length
This day hath shown that we possess
A wealth of union, which is strength.
This be thy rôle, then, royal GroRGE,
To bind the folk together fast
With loving fetters, and to forge
iinks that are warranted to last.
Let not the head we crown to-day
Walk in the paths of horrid strife;
Wear in thy buttonhole alway
• The swelt-pea of a peaceful life.

The very large expenses of conducting
the competition having been deducted

money goes to the prize-winner, to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
A CoRoNATION SEASON.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--The Coronation
feeling in everybody is showing itself
in fancy dress. This is quite and
altogether a fancy-dress season. Every-
body who is anybody must be always
dressing up as somebody else !
The regulation fancy-dress dance is
always with us, of course : ... but
we coronate by giving, in addition,
fancy-head dinners, domino suppers,
thés poudrés, and guess-who-I-am
lunches. Oh, and if you please, my
dear, the first fancy-dress wedding
has made its bow—Lord Oldpark's
to Hypatia B. Blogg of Pittsburg. St.
Agatha's was simply packed, and it
went with a bang. Oldpark was
screamingly well got up as a slot-
machine. “A Million in the Slot”
was written across him, and, when
they came to the part of the service
where the ring is wanted, instead of
the best man producing it as usual,
Hypatia herself, whose white satin
gown was made to look like a roll of
dollar bills, worked the Million-in-the-
Slot machine and got out the wedding
ring in the regular way. -
Your own Blanche is responsible
for the very latest thing in costume
functions—c'est - d -dire, fancy-dress
church services. I want to persuade
the Rector of St. Agatha's to preach to
us as Friar Bacon, or St. Augustine, or
one of those old-time preachers, and we
would all come as Canterbury pilgrims,
or something. I mean to coax the
dear bishop to allow it. I shall put it
to him that people are always com-
plaining of the empty churches in town,
that he must want to see them filled,
and that the way of ways to have them
full to the brim is to let us have fancy-
dress services on Sunday !
Of all the Coronation dances, so far,
the big costume affair (under the pat-
ronage of both, or I suppose I ought to
say all, political parties) at the Gorge-
ous Galieries was easily first. Beryl
Clarges took charge of the quadrille of
Typical British Peeresses. She told
me she felt a bit awkward at being the
only English woman in it, and that the
others seemed to look on her as by way
of being an intruder!
In the Little England quadrille a
quite new figure was introduced, called
Toeing the Line. It made a big sen-
sation. It's a difficult figure, and I
hear they've been practising it for
some time; but they certainly did it very
well—to a queer tune called “Shil-
lelagh's a-walkin'.”
On dit that the Bullyon-Bounder-
mere woman has been to a certain
Minister and asked that, if a new batch
of peers is to be created, Mr. B.-B. may
be one of them. She says he's pre-
pared to give something enormous to
the party funds, and to make himself
generally useful in the Upper Chamber
in shoving things on or holding them
back, wouldn't want any veto, and
wouldn't even mind being abolished,
when once he'd got his title! But the
offer only holds good before the Coro-
nation, as they both want to be present.
Another item of Coronation gossip
is that The New York Trumpeter has
offered Lord Needmore £100,000 for
the use of his name, robes and coronet
on the 22nd of June for their repre-
sentative, as they want an absolutely
first-hand account from a peer's point
of view. And Lord N. is not the only
one to have such an offer. It's to be
hoped that all the American pressmen
will wait for the supreme moment in
the ceremony, and not put on their
coronets too soon |
The huge number of visitors in
London this season has made the
taking about of parties quite a little
rage. Kiddy Vavasour, Norty's younger
brother, who's very nice and very clever,
but a fearful pauper, poor boy, saw his
way to make a bit out of the epidemic
of expert guides and conducted parties.
“Museums and historic buildings are
all very well,” he said, “but for
one person who wants to know
what's what and where's where, there
are thirty who want to know who's
who ; and I'm their man '" And, my
dear, he takes great gangs of queerities
to the Park and to Ranelagh and to
Hurlingham during the day, and in
the evenings fixes up with host-
esses to take them to parties, ranges
them round the walls in the danc-
ing-rooms and tells them who every-
body is, marches them through the
supper-rooms, points out which of
the people are on diet and oughtn't
to touch the things they're gobbling
up and predicts what form of indy
they 're likely to have next day, and
lets them peep into the sitting-out
places, telling them which couples
have no right whatever to be murmur-
ing and cooing in a solitude a deua, 1
His fee is immensely enormous (cach
of the hostesses whose houses he
takes his crowd to expects something),
but he's overwhelmed with business
and simply coining money !
Such fancy prices are being offered
for town houses just now that a great
many people can't afford to stay in
their own, and as, of course, they've
got to be somewhere in the neighbour-
hood, they've gone into lodgings. The
Middleshires have let Middleshire
House for £5,000 a week, and gone to
lodge at a place called Holloway.
Then the Needmores, the Sangazurs,
the De Stoneyvilles, and several others
have let their houses in Berkgrave and
the other squares, and gone to live
at Peckham and Camberwell. They
charter a motor-bus among them,
which brings them to town every day
and takes them back every night—or
morning, as it may happen.
Pity me, my dearest | Some of Josiah's
relations have come from the uttermost
ends of the earth to coronate, and are
staying here. They're stout and red,
and want to “see everything" and to
“enjoy themselves”; in short, they're
much about what Josiah was before
Somebody took him in hand. Their
vocab. includes such phrases as “the
height of fashion,” and “sumptuous
entertainments!” But the wo.st thing
about them is that they remember
Josiah when he was a boy and are fond
of taking of those pre-historic days.
I bore it till reason tottered on her
throne, and then I told them, “Memory,
socially speaking, is bad form. In
other words, remembering is not done—
except when written in the shape of
memoirs that will sell. Just as people
keep their money and valuables at the
banker's, so they keep their mºmories
at the publisher's.”
Just a little story of Hugo Daubeny,
the Flummerys' artist cousin. I found
myself next him at dinner the other
night, and he asked me what I thought
of the Academy show. I said I never
went there, but that people said it was
a dull one, and I added, “There 's no
Picture of the Year, is there?” “The
Picture of the Year,” he growled,
scowling at his plate, “is still in the
cellars at Burlington House waiting to
be fetched away !”
Ever thine,
BLANCHE.
“Indeed, the present year is doubly associated
with the memory of Hume, for not only does it
mark the lapse of ten centuries since his birth,
but also the passage of a contury and a half
since his great history was completed.”
Bombay Gazette.
A great history, indeed, even if put
together a little too hurriedly.
“The part which the school children of
Edinburgh are to play in the celebrations con-
nected with the Royal visit to Edinburch was
discussel yesterday. . . . It was remarked at
yesterday's meeting that if 30,000 children
were present, that would be the equivalent of
the Scottish Army at Bannockburn.”—Sotsunaw.
We wonder who it was who thought
of that tactful comparison. It looks
as if somebody had been reading
about Bannockburn that afternoon,
and had to bring it in at all costs.

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCHI,
CHARIVARIA.
WE have no complaint to make in
regard to the Coronation; but, fond as
we are of these functions, we trust that
it will be many many years before we
have another.
* *
We understand that while KING
GEORGE and QUEEN MARY are, with
chal acteristic kindness, determined to
do their best, they will find it quite
impossible to look like all the portraits
of themselves which are being given
away with the various Coronation
Numbers.
This wonderful year ! We already
have Coronation Exhibitions, Corona-
tion Bibles, Coronation Dances, and,
for all we know, Coronation Dog
Fights, and now, in addition to these,
it seems there is to be a Coronation
Ceremony at Westminster Abbey.
::
The Coronation Ceremony, by-the-
way, promises to be the most successful
function of the year. In addition to a
host of notabilities, the KING and QUEEN
have promised to be present.
In the regulations as to the dresses
which Members' wives may wear in
the Abbey, “considerable latitude,” we
read, “is allowed.” We should have
thought that this would lead to much
undesirable over-crowding.
:: *k
A proposal has b, en made that every
helpless little baby born on the 22nd
inst. shall be named Coronation. The
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Children has the matter in hand.
:: :::
::
The KING's wish is Law even to-day,
and we are glad to hear that HIS
MAJESTY's desire that an extra week's
holiday shall be given to the boys and
girls in all schools in honour of the
Coronation, is being accepted cheerfully
by the entire juvenile population of the
country, even though they realise that
it may interfere somewhat with the
course of their studies.
:: :::
The police regulation, that all lights
in connection with illuminations shall
be put out by 12.30 on the morning
following Coronation Day presses some-
what hardly on some persons. For
example, a lady living at Peckham had,
before the regulation was issued, paid
extra for her fairy lamp, on the under-
standing that it would keep alight
until 1.30.
+...+
We have a large amount of sympathy
with Mr. BENNETT GoLDNEY, M.P., who
suggested that, as each Member having

a wife, an unmarried sister, or a daugh-
ter, receives an invitation to the Coro-
nation for one such relative, an equal
privilege should be extended to those
who have no wife, unmarried sister, or
daughter, but who have a mother. We
consider it of the highest importance,
in thºse days of dwindling population,
to hold out inducements to persons to
have mothers.
*...*
At the Coronation Costume Ball,
which is to be held at the Botanical
Gardens on June 16th, there is to
be an interesting innovation. Mr.
GRAHAME-WHITE is to fly in his
aeroplane from Hendon in costume
to attend the function. The success
of the innovation will depend to some
extent on whether the distinguished
airman alights on a glass-house or
not.
*...*
The announcement that Mr. Eve
has had a hand in designing the
stamps to be issued on Coronation
Day has led to a stupid rumour that
they will bear a representation of
Britannia in the costume of a Classical
Dancer.

[Addressed to Charles, who proposes to see the Coronation Procession with me—urging him to loyalty.]
CHARLEs, at this hour of pageantry and ermine,
When soon the royal crown (remember that)
Shall rest on England's King, you must determine
To pension off that piece of mouldy mat;
This is a resolution I am firm in-
Charles, you must buy a hat.
In some dim long-ago, as I imagine it,
In days of stress and hardihood and fight,
It may be, with a crest or else a badge in it,
The morion you wear was new and bright;
Yes, at the crowning of the first Plantagenet,
It may have looked all right.
And later, when the land was rent asunder,
And monarchs swam through gore their crowns to win,
On some bold baron's head, creating wonder,
It had its place, although the fur was thin,
And by some strange, discreditable blunder
Nobody bashed it in.
Circa the little trouble of the Roses
It may have seemed a useful sort of tile
For Coronations after battle-closes,
Roughened and scarred with use, and bare of pile :
But now, when Albion's realm at peace reposes,
Charles, it is not the style.
Out of what show-case, with nefarious lever,
From what museum, or what midnight troth
Making with broomstick.hag, the baleſul-weaver,
You got it, goodness knows. What was its growth 2
Is it a silk hat, Charles, or is it beaver ?
Probably bits of both.
Give it away, Charles. Give it to the vendor
Of rags and bones, or sit on it, or hoof
It up and down, or burn it in the fender.
Shall it be said that garb of golden woof,
The gowns of peeresses, the Life Guards' splendour
Were spoilt by Charles's roof 2
Shall History relate with heartfelt sorrow,
What time the links of truth she comes to forge,
That midst the cheering on that splendid morrow
Were hoots from England's aggravated gorge?
That one old stove-pipe hat impaired the Coro-
nation of good KING GEORGE 2 Evor.
Already worn-out with the strain of preliminary festivities
and the general buzziness of London, many people are
intending to seek the repose of Paris during the actual
Coronation week. The rumour that the KING and QUEEN
are among this number is fortunately without foundation.

THOUGHTS OF A CORONATION
i COLLAR-STUD.
June 21st.—I was sure of it. Faith-
ful service for many years is to be
rewarded. I am to be His Majesty's
collar-stud to-morrow. The order has
just been issued. An Eall came to the
KING and said, “Have you any special
order, Sir, with regard to the sleeve.
links and shirt-studs you will wea.
to-mcreow 2'' “No,” said the KING
promptly, “I leave all that to you.
There's only one thing I insist on.
I must have my old plain gold collar-
stud, the one I wore when I first went
to sea. It's my lucky stud, and I
couldn't think of wearing any other—
you know the one I mean.” “Certainly,
Sir,” said the Earl, and the incident
ended. I am now on the KING's toilet-
table and am apparent'y to stay there
to-night. Is this quite safe? If I
were lost could the Coronation go on ?
Oughtn't they to put me away in a
jewel-box” But then the jewel-box
might be lost. Tush | I am over-ex-
cited. Let me try to compose myself.
June 22nd, 7 A.M.–I am awake.
I am still on the toilet-table. All is
well so far.
8 A.M.–A valet has entered the
room. He is moving towards me
very softly. I hope he will be very
careful. It would— There! I knew
it would happen. He has knocked me
off the table. I have rolled under the
fender. Help! help ! . . . The vale
has not noticed my fall. What, oh
what, will happen?
8.30 A.M.–The KING has asked for me.
The valet has fainted. Messengers are
flying in every direction. The KING
has said again that he must have his
lucky collar-stud; that he will wear
no other. I'verything is in confusicn
The KING is not angry: he is only
calm and resolute.
8.40. A.M.–A Duke, a Marquis, two
Earls, a Baron, several Equerries and
a Groom-in-Waiting have come in.
The Groom-in-Waiting has suggested
that they should all look under the
various articles of furniture.
8.45 A.M.–They are doing so. The
Duke is stoutish and he breathes hard
when he stoops. They have looked
under the wardrobes, the chests-of-
drawers, the tables—under everything
except the fender. When will this
agony end?
8.50 A.M.–An Equerry has suggested
that they should all take their shoes
off and pace over the floor in their
stockinged feet. Anyone, he says, who
treads on the stud will be sure to
know it. Suggestion adopted. They
are pacing and re-pacing over the
floor. The KING is cheering them on—

Lord Algernon Henne-Heriot. Yes, siree, Gussie has
the whole push buffaloed once in a while. About the
third rattle out of the box Gus corralled four bellhops and
hung on. I read him wrong and started sandying for the

back he calls me and lays down his little men. I nearly
threw a fit when I saw them.
Captain Reggie Brasyl. Mangy little piker' I bet he
had cold feet the first time you turned loose on him. It
ain't up to you to kick though.
Lord Algy. Maybe not, in this case, but you can't play
poker with a double tarred ball of twine round your wad.
Gussie strips off the long green about as cheerfully as the
teller of a country bank at the end of a three-day rush.
Didn't see you at Lady Betty's Thursday.
Reggie. You're dead right, you didn't. The fair Betty's
shaken little Willie for keeps ever since that baccarat
squabble. Serves me right for butting in. I started to
flag her in the park Sunday and she gave me a look that
would have frozen the ears off a brass monkey. Talk about

Lord Algy. Nit. I'm through playing the ponies now
till the cows come home. What the bookies have done to
me this year is a shame. Last month I was in so deep
I had to crowd the old man for a couple of thousand
simoleons. IHe went right up in the air when I started to

having to put a plaster on the Cumberland estate, and a

play, but the old war-horse wouldn't reach for the kale till
I'd promised not to lay a bet for a year. I hated to do it,
but I had to have the dough and now it's up to me to
deliver the goods.
Reggie. Wouldn't that jar you! Odds are, though,
you're better off without it. I've been getting the dope
on this horse stuff now for ten years and, whenever I think
I've picked a sure enough live 'un and backed him for all
the dinero I could muster, some rube with a broken-winded
bronco bounces up and throws the harpoon into me six
feet. Suffering cats! If there was only my fancy to beat
you could win the St. Leger with a hand-painted hearse
horse. It's a fright.
Lord Algy. It is that. Well, I got to mosey along.
Reggie. What's your hurry? Sit down and I'll buy

Reggie. You're on. One flop horses. Etc., etc.

A big detachment of Coronation troops is to be housed
at St. Martin's-le-Grand. “In its former occupation as
Post Office,” The Daily Mail tells us, “the building provided
accommodation for 4,000 workers, so there will be ample
room for all soldiers like to be posted there.” We take
off our hat to our contemporary. “Posted" is happy.
Whence the most torpid brain (which mine is not)
Rises to new thoughts which, with warm surprise,
He feels instinctively are good and wise;
These are the themes by poets held most dear;
Of such are poems made; and such, methinks, is here.
Yes, ’tis a sight no loyal eye may view
Without emotion; here the gaze is fed
With the great Stone of Scone (pronounce it oo),
Brought from old Palestine, whereon, 'tis said,
Tired JAcoB rested his nomadic head.
A fine thought this; let cavillers assert
The stone is new Scotch sandstone—what are they but dirt 2
But to the Chair. The casual regard
Might hold it for its office all unmeet;
Hewn of the callous oak it is, and hard,
And unresponsive to the royal seat;
Yet, with a stern composure bad to beat,
From our first Edward, England's kings have sat
Here, and have here been crowned; and what d'you make
of that ?
Bethink you what the chronicle relates
Of those great souls, long laid on history's shelf;
Try to imagine (never mind the dates)
All their proud line, from Norman down to Guelph;
For me, my wandering dream confines itself,
Somehow, to stout QUEEN BEss; full well I ween
Good heed the prelate took who crowned that hasty Queen.
They come, as in a mist they go; and thus
The contemplative mind must needs recall
How surely waits the dark Mors Omnibus,
Looming ahead, alike for great and small.
A sombre lesson this, if this were all!
But look again; look closelier yet, and read;
Can those be letters? Yes. And names? They are, indeed.
O ye unknown, that have, in ages back,
Carved on the seat of kingship each his name
Or his initials, thus with happy knack
Making a bold, pathetic bid for fame,
Now after long days ye achieve your aim;
Not to the kings, ye meaner, but to ye
The minstrel turns his muse in clear apostrophe.
Not yours the royal diadem to wear;
Your state was humble as your manners low;
Yet, as we view this Coronation Chair,
Out of the mind all kingly visions go—
They fade, they perish; only we may know
Your simple toils; only the sense is gript
By these rude names of yours, rough-hewn in clumsy script.
And thus we learn that men of quiet lives
May hope not ever to remain unknown;
It is the unobtrusive that survives,
The man that shuns the light, that works alone,
Who carves his name on Time's enduring throne.
Nor is there one so lowly, one so weak,
But may attain the utmost—with sufficient cheek. e
DUM-DUM.
South Africa's Coronation gift of representative animals
includes some “velvet monkeys.” Their British grit, how-
ever, is shown in the iron heart beneath the velvet exterior.

A CORONATION
THE morning was brilliant in Kensington Gore,
When Emma remarked, as she called me at four,
“The elephant's waiting for you at the door.”
So I put on my slippers, one brown and one black,
Wrapped my form in a waterproof Union Jack,
And cautiously climbed on the elephant's back.
There were three of us there—the Archbishop and me,
And a man with a racket, a portly Parsee
Whose name, he informed me, was Jim Jamsetjee.
“Hurry up,” said the Prelate, “ or else we'll be late,
For the dinner begins at a quarter to eight,
And money is never returned at the gate.”
So we rode and we rode, and the elephants sang,
Beating time with their trunks, in a glutinous twang,
An anthem of which I've forgotten the hang.
We were flying quite nobly when Jamsetjee cried,
“My elephant says that he's punctured inside,”
And down from the welkin proceeded to glide.
The various survivors to dinner sat down,
But I saw the Archbishop was wearing a frown,
For I had to reply to the toast of the Crown.
NIGHTMARE.
I was pleased with the duty and proud of my fame,
And firmly determined on playing the game,
But unluckily couldn't remember my name.
Then the mist cleared away as I rose to my feet—
It was just at the corner of Arlington Street—
And found myself airily clad in a sheet.
It was awkward, because the procession was due,
And the rest of the crowd were in red, white and blue,
And I couldn't unfasten the door of my pew.
Then I rose in my wrath and exclaimed, “Let me go.
I am suff'ring from partial collapse of the toe,
But, whatever may happen, the KING mustn't know.”
There were pathos and pride in the words that I spoke,
But a giant guffaw from the populace broke,
And I thought they were justified—after I woke.

the conversation, “ or do They split one

promise;" and I took out my notebook.
“What I mean is, people always talk
about the English Crown and hardly
ever about the English Crowns.”

said glibly, “is better than no recog-

Whereupon I doubled the fee and

partly to justify the title of this article.

CASTING SEASON.
“Ne'er cast a clout
Till May is out.”
Old Sºying.
WHILE enthusiastic clout-casters all
over the country have been impatiently
waiting for the passing of May, few,
perhaps, have been so enterprising as
the Old Etonians, who held their first
interested in coronations
than that I have any
intention of marrying the
girl.” On second thoughts
I omitted the reference to
the fourth daughter.
I tied the correspond-
ence in a bundle and took
it with me, so that I could
prove that they had asked
me in case of a bother at
the door, and the first
person I met in the ball-
room was Tommy Clarke.
“Hello, Thomas,” said
I, “what brought you

“A taxi,” he replied;

no good and, if he wanted

12.30 A.M. on the 1st of
June under somewhat
novel conditions. By a
clever arrangement of
acetylene lamps and an
illuminated basket the
groundsman had made
preparations at once
adequate and ingenious,
and in consequence there
was a large muster of
ardent O.E.'s. Under the
circumstances anything
like accurate casting was
scarcely to be expected,
and in the practice game
that had been arranged,
Puce v. Maroon, the com-
bined flights were inclined
to be ragged. But some

In spite of my faultless
evening dress and my stiff white shirt
without spot, none of the ladies knew
or seemed to want to know me. So I
went up to the solitary girl by the door.
“How do you do?" I said to her.
“I don't suppose you remember my
face. And I'll tell you why; I don't
suppose you have ever seen it before.
Nevertheless I hope you like it. There !
If you admire my courage, come and
dance with me and tell me a funny
story about the Coronation.” The only
funny story she could remember was
that she once had a father (whom she
still retained) and that father had pro-
cured seats for the procession for the
whole family, including Alfred.
“And you will all live happily ever
afterwards,” I concluded for her.
“Delightfully fresh but hardly print-
able. Thank you.”
The freshness of the episode wore
off with frequent repetition. Indeed
only “Many-a-plain-face-hides-a-kind-

joke more correct, arithmetically. But
even that wouldn't have made it new.
Let us suppose They do share a crown.
Can't you do anything with it? No?
Well, there's the band again. You'
mean well with your head, but I expect
your real skill is in your feet.”
After that I determined that it was no
captionally strong season.
Thus Captain Halfe-Pryce, who led
the Maroons, found the basket with his
three-button Jaeger in four successive
casts.
While this was, perhaps, the only
team play indulged in at such an early

THERE is an event that is to occur
in this month of June, an event of such
deep and mystic significance that I feel
I can only write of it with bated breath.
It may well be said that the destinies
of a country and an empire hang in
the balance, while the sun that never
sets burns with a fever of anxiety. You
have guessed the nature of that event?
Yes, you are right. I, the most pro-
found law-student perhaps of modern
times, am to offer myself for exami-
nation in the Bar Final.
I should explain that this section of
the work is not the Essay, but is in
the nature of an introduction. The
alleged Essay has been written by my
little daughter atat twelve, and I do
not think it can be suggested that she
has distinguished herself. I most par-
ticularly wish to impress upon our
readers that it is she, and not I, who
wrote it. My little girl, Equity, has
grown up from babyhood in an atmo-
sphere of forensic research, and of recent
years she has devoted herself to help-
ing me with my “home-work" or
“prep.”
How it was that the Essay which
comes infra (if it comes at all) ever saw
the light of day I will now explain.
It was this morning that Equity and
myself, sitting at breakfast in the soft
spring sunlight, engaged in the follow-
ing dialogue.
I had propped against the coffee-pot
a page of lecture notes, with illustra-
tions by my daughter.
“You know, my dear,” I said,
helping myself to a brown crumby
fish, “I don't think these pictures
really assist me much. Who is the
man in pince-nez cutting down a
tree ?”
“Mortgagee committing waste,” she
replied, munching toast.
“But why the pince-nez?” I pro-
tested. “It's so irrelevant.”
“Mortgagees are solicitors,” she
explained briefly, and for a time there
was a silence broken only by the
sound of my brain at work.
“Papa,” said Equity suddenly—
“Papa, what about the Coronation ?”
“Well, what about it 2 ” I said.
“I think a balcony.”
“What do you mean, “you think a
balcony'?”
“I think a balcony. You can see
all right, and, what is even more
important, you can be seen. I think
I shall wear n >
“You think a lot too fast, little girl,”
I said. “A balcony indeed! I should
be ruined.”
“Oh, Papa,” she exclaimed, with a
look of reproach under her long, dark
lashes. “I should never have believed
that a paltry question of money would
have come between you and your
loyalty.”
I got up and paced about.
“My child,” I said, “you know that
the results of the examination are pub-
lished only a few days before this
so-called Coronation. Your poor father
will very likely be in a Nursing Home
for some weeks. Besides, I don't
suppose there are any balconies left.”
But I knew at once that this last
argument had weakened my case;
Equity would have her balcony if it
meant asking them to alter the entire
route. Still I felt that it might yet be
possible to make some show of paternal
authority, so I told my daughter that
she should write an Essay on the
Coronation, and that, if she took great
pains with it, I would see what could
be done about a balcony.

“I’ll see you,” said Equity, pouring
out the marmalade, and immediately
after breakfast she seized my favourite
quill in her chubby hand and wrote for
about half an hour in solemn silence,

plant upon the hearth rug and struggled
in my mind to trace some connection

ALL THE PREPARATIONS.
(By Mr. Punch's own Special French Correspondent.)
DEAR AND VERY HonourED MISTER.—It needs that I tell
you the history of an affair almost bleeding which I come
of having with Mister McAndrew 6 propos of a billet
(he call them tickets; I call them billets) for the crown-
ment of the King George Five. Me, I am of a natural
very sweet. I do not inflame myself very easily. I have
not batted myself in duel but one time and then it was my
adversary who provoked me. I have lanced him a straight
cup to the shoulder at the first engagement and retired
myself sane and safe from the groundplot without even a
scratching. After that one has left me tranquil.
But let us re-come to our McAndrew.
Mr. McAndrew seem to have his domicile at the cabaret,
but sometime he visit the house of Mistress McAndrew,
where I have loued a chamber to sleep. Or, one morning
Mister McAndrew hear me speak of a billet for the Crown-
ment. At once the rascal take an air goguenard. “Without
doubt,” he say me, “you do not desire to pay a price
too high 2" “Naturalmently,” I say him. “In France we
do not employ ourselves to throw money to the water.”
“Nor in Scotland not more,” he answer me in laughing.
Then he recounts me that he has a friend, one named
Johnson, who have billets to sell at a price very modest.
It is at a shop in the celebrated street of Pall Mall. The
ordinary price is one hundred francs, but for the friends
of McAndrew he will not ask but fifty francs par billet.
I demand him to procure me a billet at fifty francs, and he
promise that he will do of his best. Afterwards he come
to me and after having regarded round of himself he say
me to the ear, “Perhaps you will well pay me now. That
will be more quick and more easy.” Me confiant like a
lamb I pull my purse and count him two pounds. “All
right,” he say and sorts.
After to-morrow he re-comes. He has a poched eye and
the nose very red, and he scents the whiskey, but I
suspect nothing. He say me that unhappymently Mister
Johnson has selled all the billets at fifty francs, and that
there rest only billets at a hundred francs. He ask me if
I will to pay that price. I say “yes I will well,” and
give him two pounds of more.
In the morning he approach me. The other eye is
poched, the nose is again more red. This time he wakes
me suspicions and I say: “Do not tell me I have two
pounds of more to pay." - .
“It is justmently that,” he say. “We were too late.
The seats at four pounds come to be selled."
“Give me my four pounds,” I say to him with coldness.
At this he recries himself and say I have no confiance in
him. Do I wish to call him a voler, him the most
honourable man of the quarter” Ah, he will fetch a com-
missary of police and will insign me how I must conduct
myself. At the end I lose patience and the mustard
mounts me to the nose. I jump him at the figure and
commence to arrash him his red favorits:–
“Ah, polisson,” I cry me, “is it like that you vole the
honest peoples 2 I know him, your Mister Johnson. I
have rencountered him at Paris. He was in the house of
correction, and it is there one will send you, gross rascal.
Yes, I will fetch the whole corps of police, and they shall
hear my story, and dress you a procès verbal, my beautiful
mister.” And I apply him my right foot in the back, and
he fall down and demands me pardon.
Mrs. McAndrew, poor woman, has paid me my four
pounds, and I, I have solded my count and have changed
the lodges. I am now in Putney, near to the bords of the
Thames. JULES MILLEFOIs.
IN A GOOD CAUSE.
KING GEORGE's suggestion that Schools should be
allowed, if possible, an extra week's holiday in honour
of HIS MAJESTY's Coronation has been received with
marked approval by the loyalty of the rising generation.
Mr. Punch now begs to appeal for those less fortunate
children who have no means of spending holidays in the
country except by the kind help of generous friends. He
appeals, in particular, for the Fresh Air Fund, which has
now reached its twentieth season. It is hoped, at the
cost of £12,000, to give a day's holiday in the good air to
250,000 boys and girls, and a fortnight's holiday to 4,000.
The money required for this purpose will be devoted
entirely to the actual expenses of holiday-making, the cost
of organization being borne by the promoters of the Fund,
Messrs. C. ARTHUR PEARSoN, LTD. Mr. Punch ventures to
plead with his readers to make a special effort to do honour
to the KING (who is patron of the Fresh Air Fund) by
making His MAJESTY's Coronation year a record in the
annals of this good cause. Contributions should be ad-
dressed to the Hon. Sec. Fresh Air Fund, “PEARSox's,"

A Shadow Across the coronation.
The following terrible news reaches us from no less an
authority than The Weekly Call of San Francisco:-
“AMERICANs DENIED Count PRIVILEGEs.
There are hundreds of bitterly disappointed ones in London who
thought Ambassador Reid could secure their appearance at court and
get them good seats in the abbey.
The limit assigned to American presentations is considered altogether
out of reason, considering that Americans compose so large a part of the
class of society that is making things hum socially for the coronation
season. Many are going away in disgust to Paris and other parts of
the continent. The British tradespeople are accordingly on the verge
of a panic."
Can nothing be done to stop this rot?
“MASONIC.
CoRoNATION DAY PROCEss:on.
It has been decided (at a joint meeting of representatives from the
Lodges) that the Freemasons take part in the Procession. It is hoped
the Brethren will make every effort to turn out on such a special
occasion. Lress: Dark White Tie, and White Gloves."
Arbroath Herald.
The march of the brethren should be the making of
the day. The best dark white effects in ties are obtained
by wearing them frequently before.
The Poetic Touch.
“The rain came down in sheets, and poured through the streets with
the violence of a mill sluice. The result was that the High Street,
Albion Street, and other thoroughfares speedily resembled a vast lagoon,
water rippling and bubbling everywhere, so that the centre of the town
was for the nonce converted into a replica of gleaming Naples with its
aqueous streets along which pretty gondolas ‘skim the smooth surface
o'er.'"—Dunstable Borough Gazette.
“O what a night it was to have been ''”

which had been fixed for Friday, June 23rd, has been cancelled owing to
the difficulty which would be experienced in embarking the guests in

(So named because he kept asking for more.)
IN many a Springtime, haunting woodland ways,
Hillsides and hedgerows, with the old school-boy zest,
One sight would bring me ever fresh amaze—
A cuckoo bantling in a small bird's nest;
Like the odd changeling of some elfin art,
Bulging from brim to brim, I watched him there,
Bloated usurper, play his ruthless part,
The rightful heirs barged—he alone knew where.
I heard the tyrant orders shrill and loud
He gave the small befostering he and she,
And marvelled much to see them slaving, proud
Insanely of their infant prodigy;
And tried to guess what all-compelling law
So bade them toil the day long to appease
That never-sated, ever-clamouring maw,
Nor take, from morn to night, a moment's ease.
But knew not how much more than met the eye
Explained this genius for obtaining food,
Until, one day, the gardener's boy came by
With, in his cap, one of the tyrant brood;
There, from a desecrated nest, half grown,
But fitting tight, a form of brindled down
Gaped forth. Tom grinned, and made the thing my own,
Touching me to the tune of half-a-crown.
I took him home and, from his earliest meal—
Was it by that red maw, the monstrous-sized,
And some strange glamour of its vast appeal?—
He had the whole house deeply hypnotized.
Helpless before it, we were straightway taught
How weirdly strong suggestion's force may b2.
Talk of the “tyranny of tears”—'twas nought
Beside that open mouth's autocracy l.
Priestlike we fed that gizzard's sacred flame;
The page-boy's pockets bulged with woolly-bears:
Cook “didn't hold with it,” yet daily came
Laden with tit-bits, toiling up the stairs,
And, 'neath a witchery that never waned,
All seem compelled to help him dine and dine;
Even languid Gwendolen was sore constrained,
Letting her novel wait, to serve the shrine.
And, though the tyrant all-ungrateful took
Our offerings, we bowed to his commands,
Yet knowing well he would not give a cuck
For anyone who came with empty hands.
So this Gargantuan infant's days were spent
On endless dishes like a gourmet's dream,
Until, praise be, with every good intent,
Gwendolen choked him with a chocolate-cream.

THE NEW MUSICAL CRITICISM.
DEAR MR. PUNCH.-It seems to me
that the musical critics, make an enor-
mous mistake in dwelling on tedious
detailsº relating to , the technique of
compositions or their performance.
What people really like to know are
personal facts about the artists and
impresarios and agents and lessees. A
few emancipated critics are trying ten-
tatively to introduce notices of this
sort, but what we want is something
like this:—
“At the Royal Albert Hall (Pro-
prietors, the Commissioners of the
Exhibition of 1851) a concert (arranged
by Concert Director NATHANIELSPEYER)
took place yesterday (by permission of
the Clerk of the Weather. the Board of
Trade, and the Ecclesiastical Commis-
sioners). Madame PATTI (the Baroness
CEDERSTR3M) and Madame MELBA (by
the permission of the Royal Opera
Syndicate, Covent Garden) sang Folk-
songs arranged by Cecil, Sharp and

Provinces, Canada, Australia, New

CALENDAR REFORM.
MR. PEARCE's Bill to reform the
Calendar will, we hope, prove as
effective as Mr. WILLETT's Daylight
Saving Bill in providing food for
agreeable discussion and conjecture.
Not that we are disposed to admit the
necessity for reforming the Calendar.
It does perhaps look a little absurd
“on paper,” as they say—even a little
far-fetched—but in practice it has
always seemed to us to work fairly
well, so long as one clings to its great
guiding principle—that thirty days
hath September. It is probable that
the late JULIUS CAESAR devoted not a
little thought to his ingenious arrange-
ment. Certainly, apart from slight
modifications, it has had a long and
uninterrupted run, and if it is at last
to be suspended, if the hereditary
principle is to be abandoned, so to
speak, we are inclined to ask: “Who
is Mr. PEARCE that he should elect to
supplant the Conqueror of Gaul? Why
Mr. PEARCE 2 We also have our plan
of Calendar Reform.”
His (Mr. Fº plan, it will be
remembered, is to eliminate a day—
we like that idea; it is full of pos-
sibilities—which shall not belong to any
week or month, but shall be called
simply New Year's Day. Thereafter
he divides the year into 52 perfect
weeks, every month having 30 days,
except the last month of each quarter,
which shall have 31. Our first objection
to this proposal is taken on artistic
grounds.
Thirty-one days hath September,
March, June and i.
cannot be made even to scan, and will
hardly be accepted with equanimity by
those of us who have been brought up
on the authorised version, and have
become attached to it through long
association. But let that pass.
Of course we see Mr. PEARCE's
difficulty; that has not escaped us.
We ourselves have been trying to
figure it out, and we also got up
against a very awkward fact—namely,
that 365 is divisible only by five and
73. Clearly you can't do much with
that without getting yourself involved
in recurring decimals. But we find
Mr. PEARCE's solution—of dropping
only one day—rather timorous and
half-hearted. What we want is to lay
the foundations of a thoroughgoing
and comprehensive scheme, which shall
at least stand the wear and tear of
nineteen centuries, as its predecessor
has done. And here let us say that
the details of the plan are open to
amendment in committee. We invite
discussion. We are always prepared
to receive suggestions from any part
of the House.
We begin boldly, then, by eliminating
five days, and at once we have a work-
able figure to start on. Nothing could
be better than 360. This we divide
into 12 months of 30 days each. So
far, so good. The critic has probably
observed, however, that we cannot
divide it into weeks of seven days.
But we have thought of that. We are
going to drop a week-day and make it
six. By this device we have five weeks
in every month. Rather happy; we
think. The seven-day week, if you
come to examine it, has been a very
clumsy instrument. You cannot divide
it in half. That in itself is an enormous
drawback. Life is full of things that
fall due to be done twice a week, and
as the matter stands they cannot be
done at equal intervals. To take only
one instance:—there are many of us
who make a practice of changing our
white waistcoats twice a week, and are
guiltily conscious that those which
begin their career on Thursday morn-
ing must drag out a protracted existence

There still remains the question of

oppressive piece of legislation, that
necessity of telling the truth seems to
on its victims, the M.P.'s. But even so
I dare say their old habits will get the
better of them, and they will describe
their salaries, loosely, as Earned Income.
Your confirmed Tory may have the
decency to put an exclamation mark
in brackets after the “Earned,” but he
will do so less from motives of honesty
than in the hope of influencing the
political convictions of his assessor.
they could be slipped in with
advantage, in late and back-
ward seasons, between the 11th
and 12th of August—to give | }
the birds a chance. Or they
might be handed over to the
M.C.C. for the last test match,
or sprinkled through the year
as Bank Holidays. No doubt
they would prove to be a very
powerful instrument in the
hands of the Government of the
day, if used for Parliamentary
purposes. But we think this
would be a risky experiment.
If the CHANCELLoR of THE
ExchEQUER got hold of them at
the close of the financial year
they might lead to a prodigious
cooking of accounts.
On the whole we are inclined
to save up these five days till we
have a whole month in hand—
to be called a Leap Month.
This could be allotted for any
important national purpose. It
would be invaluable in a year
like the present to carry out a
complete and protracted celebra-
tion of the Coronation, for the
whole populace could go on
holiday without any actual loss
of time.

Aspodestera, is your face your

dear old man's letter makes me
wonder, for these income-tax
people do know such a lot.
“The income of a married
woman,” he writes, naming no
names but mentioning it too
casually to be entirely with-
out suspicion, “living with her
husband, is deemed to be her
husband's income.” Let me
say now that it is the dearest
wish of my life that when you
are a married woman you should
live with your husband, never
leaving me except when these
Income Tax Forms have to be
filled in. Then I think it would
be a kindly act for you to go
and stay with your parents,
you and they fixing it between
you as to whose that income is
to be deemed to be for the pur-
pose of paying tax on it.
And now I must leave you
to write to my dear Assessor.

less often, than you do, but I

the usual thing, in our set at any
rate, for engaged couples to correspond

| Why, I do not know; but there the
fact is for you to make the most of it.
| I must add, however, that this paper
will only cost you threepence, and if

ing £160, but I do not think that that
can have anything to do with it. Well,
well! We must face our troubles with
a brave front. Either you must go out
and be a governess, or I must go out
and be a Member of Parliament. If I
happen to hear of a family with a lot
of small children in it whose parents

happen to hear of a constituency in
need of a new Member who will be
ready to adopt any policy or opinion,
and to change either at a moment's
notice, you let me know.
Should I contrive to get that con-
stituency, the State will, I suppose,
know all about it, and I shall have
to be accurate about the £400, when
scripts. His reads to the
effect that, if I am not very careful
how I reply to his buff-coloured
notes, I may render myself liable, on
summary conviction, to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding six months
with hard labour. That I am prac-
tically certain to do, and, should an
officious parson have married us off
before I am discovered, my idea is that
the weekly allowance for housekeeping
should be suspended for a period (not
exceeding six months) and the accumu-
lated sum be devoted to providing me
with a much-needed and well-deserved
holiday at the end of it. For I have
the dark suspicion, gathered I know
not whence, that when the kind old
fellow says “hard" he means it.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHIARIVARI.
“THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN
WEST.”
FROM the moment when, across the
footlights, a whiff of Rance's cigar was
blown to me in the first row of the
stalls, I knew that we were in for a
melodrama as realistic as anything
ever can be on the operatic stage. It
brought to my quivering nostrils the
full local aroma of a mining camp in
the Golden West (period 1850). I was
prepared for a chorus of pioneers with
rough exteriors and primitive notions
of summary justice; but also with
warm hearts (when you got at them),
and with natures so sensitive that the
coarsest of them would break out into
manly grief and wipe his eyes
with the back of his hand on
receiving news of the death of
his grandmother far, far away
in the Leaden East. And I was
never once disappointed in these
admirable fellows,who did every-
thing according to the book.
But I confess to a certain
chagrin at not being allowed to
set eyes on Nina. Nina was
theat' raction at the rival saloon.
Minnie (“the Girl of the Golden
West”), who ran the “Polka”
saloon, and was a pattºrn to
all barmaids, sketches be: char-
acter lightly as that of “a
designing hussy who spends her
time ogling all the men.”
I think it a grave cversight
that she was not introduced to
us in person, if only to serve as
a foil to the virtues of Minnie,
and to create that palpable
atmosphere of jealousy without
which no melodrama can be a
really perfect thing.
But to return to Irance, the
“Sheriff.” In every scene, in-
cluding the noblest I have ye
enjoyed at Covent Garden—a forest of
gigantic Californian pines—he wore,
without finching, an evening waistcoat
with a soft shirt front and black tie,
and a rusty opera hat. I don't com-
plain of these things in their proper
place. Indeed, I have often admired
them when worn by eccentric occupants
of the stalls at Covent Garden. But in
“the forest primeval" they seemed to
betray, if I may dare say it, a lack cf
harmony with their environment. Per-
sonally, I was never in a Californian
mining camp during the middle years
of the last century, and cannot say
whether this costume was de rigueur
with the sheriffs of that era. Of course,
I have heard of a sheriff’s “posse,” and
it may well be that this was the fatigue

was justified of his uniform, for he
seemed to be on posse-duty most of
the time; but I would have been con-
tent to forego historical accuracy for
something a little less destructive of
the picture.
Mlle. DESTINN was once more ador-
able. Apart from her delicious voice,
with the moving appeal of its middle
notes, every detail of her action—the
last thing that most prime donne worry
about—was perfect in its sympathetic
refinement and restrained dramatic
force. Signor BAssi, whose memory
was at times a little faulty, played also
with a commendable reserve. Nor
must I pass over the fascinating figure
of the Redskin, Billy Jackrabbit, who

effects. All the same, when I com-
pare his Fanciulla with Carmen, one
popular theme of melodrama with
another, I ask myself whether he might
not have allowed himself to put our
senses under a rather stronger and
more captivating spell. For, after all,
BizET gets his atmosphere, and very
seldom keeps the drama halting, and
yet all the time is weaving about us an
irresistible charm. There is very little of
this in Signor Puccini's new work; our
interest is always engaged, but no sus-
tained demandisput upon our emotions;
and such memories as remain with us
are concerned rather with the novelty
of the scenes than with his setting of
them. Even these memories are marred
by the ugly note on which the
lovers persist in iterating their
final addio.
My neighbour, by the way,
seemed obsessed by the idea
that they were going forth to
start upon a new life out in the
Golden West. A pretty thought,
in which one recognises an echo
of many melodramas. But, as
I took pains to explain to her,
they were already as far West
as they could go.

WHAT NO MAN KNOWS.
I DID not intend to read anything at
all when I entered the club that day;
I wanted to write a letter. But it was
lying open on the chair, and so I picked
it up.
I am inclined to believe now that it
was put there as a trap.
It was a weekly paper and five days
old at that, so I passed hastily and
forgivingly over the racing column, in
which “The Newmarket Nut" had
given two non-runners and three losers
as his selections for the previous day's
races.
Then I came to a column headed
“Man and his Dress,” written by one who
styled himself “West-end Lounger”
—a nom-de-guerre which attracted
me at once by the careless grace with
which it admitted human frailties in
one of exalted social station.
Most of this column was taken up
with Answers to Correspondents, and
it was Answer No. 3 which led to
all my trouble.
It ran thus: “ENQUIRER.—Certainly
not; no man with the slightest preten-
sions to being decently dressed would
ever dream of having more than two
buttons on the cuff of a lounge suit.”
One felt that “Enquirer” must be
having a bad time of it but so digni-
fied and crushing was the rebuke to
his artless query that at first my
sympathy for him was tinged with
contempt.
I pictured him as a pushing man,
with no taste and little tact; doubtless
an honest man according to his lights,
but—well, anyway he had been put in
his place now.
Then, without warning, one of those
pangs of self-doubt that come to º

that “They” are wearing certain things.

He screwed his right arm round as
he spoke, and I counted them care-
fully—Jones checking me as Inumbered
them off.
“Four !” I shouted. “Why, you're
worse than I am!" and I grasped his
hand again.
It was selfish, no doubt, to show my
pleasure in his degradation so openly,
but it is so comforting to know that
one is not all alone in these times of
trial.
I explained his disgrace to him as
we strolled to the club; but he did not
seem to be much affected.
Jones always looks neat, but he
knows nothing about clothes. He is
the sort of man who tells his tailor,
when he orders a new suit, that he
wants something to “wrap round him."
We had lunch together, and he helped
me to regain my self-esteem by point-
ing out several men who had three or
four buttons on their cuffs.
Later on we became quite unpopular
by putting the question direct to every
man in the smoking-room; and none of
them could answer without counting.
One military member became quite
annoyed when it was pointed out to
him that he had three buttons on one
cuff and two on the other.
We did not ask any more after that.
[Should this meet his eye, perhaps
“Enquirer" will kindly send me his
address, and I will write him a nice
letter of sympathy and comfort.]
WHO'S FOR COSTA RICA 2
or, THE ART of REcoMMENDATION.
THE latest method of inducing
strangers to visit or settle in a country
(as exemplified in a Times article) is so
naïve that we are tempted to explain it
a little fully. It is to be found in the
last South American Supplement; and
if these supplements are not for the
exploitation of South America, what
are they for 2
Let us see how The Times' corre-
spondent helps us. He begins: “Costa
Rica claims to be the one Latin-
American Republic which denies itself
the pleasurable excitement of frequent
revolutions. Perhaps the numerous
earthquakes give sufficient variety to
life, especially as they usually come
late at night or early in the morning,
when a hurried exit from the house is
most disturbing; but there are years of
stillness in the earth, and then this
little country must be an earthly
paradise.”
That is tempting. One never knows
one's luck, and, of course, it may be
that a year of stillness is imminent.
But before settling in this capricious
land there are certain difficulties. “It
is easily reached,” but “at present the
health regulations require fresh vac-
cination marks to be shown on arriving,
and after 19 days' voyage from England
last November passengers were obliged
to report themselves at a doctor's office
daily for 10 days, in case of cholera
symptoms.” Consider, however, that
the promised land is not only reached,
but entered. Then hey for the capital'
But here again the sweet is so dashed
with sour that one must be a very
hardy explorer to pursue the quarry.
“Seven or eight hours are needed for
the 102 miles of railway journey up to
San José, the capital of the Republic,
but it is an unique and beautiful trip.
There may be stoppages for slides or
breakdowns, and the passengers may
have the amusement of helping to put
back a derailed car, or be detained for
weeks when heavy rains have washed
away the line. But,” adds The Times'
own Mark Tapley, “when all goes well
the lover of nature has a feast.”
Cartago is on the way. This is, of
course, au fond a deliriously enticing
spot, but just now “is trying to recover
from the terrible earthquake of last
spring, when scarcely a house was
left standing. As it was also destroyed
by an earthquake in 1841 there was
some discussion whether it should be
again rebuilt on the same spot at the
foot of the active volcano of Irazú,
but the inhabitants decided to do so.
Both there and in San José they are
endeavouring to profit by the experi-
ence of other earthquake countries in
building, and no longer put roofs of
heavy tiles; but a drawback to the
sheets of corrugated metal now used is
that they wear into holes quickly,
letting the rain through.” The corre-
spondent's reflection that “a superior
quality of metal roofing, warranted to
last more than two or three years,
should sell readily there,” makes one
wonder whether, perhaps, it would not
be better for the emigrant to let the
roofing get there first.
We reach San José at last—if we
are lucky—and quickly find that it
has “a prison and a lunatic asylum
of the best modern description.” It
is also very healthy, there being
“little sickness, except that due to
impure water.” But what is that,
after all 2 Merely a little typhoid, a
little diphtheria, now and then, just to
prevent life from being too monoton-
ously joyous. The situation of the
city is delightful, being sheltered from
the north by the volcanos of Irazú,
Barba and Poas, the last of which
“has an extraordinary geyser in its
—
crater which explodes sometimes to a
great height,” no doubt to the immense
satisfaction of the neighbourhood.
The industry is banana growing, and
“vacant land can be obtained by any-
one who puts in a claim, apparently
without payment"—that “apparently”
sounds rather like a catch — “but
roads are bad and construction diffi-
cult.” That is to say, even though
you may get your fruit it may go
wrong before it can reach the cus-
tomer. The Italian emigrants who
tried have found it unsatisfactory and
returned home. The lower hills look
—“look” is good — suitable for tea
growing; but tea-growing has not
succeeded. The natives also are not
capable of much work, especially near
the capital, where the women are
addicted to goitres.
The last sentence states that
“the Government wishes to attract
foreigners.” Surely that end must
now be attained.
TO CREATE A MODERN HAT.
THE ONLY WAY.
TAKE any shape of straw that pre-
tends to be the foundation of a hat.
Give the thing to the baby or any
other inquisitively destructive animal
to play with for ten minutes on a well-
washed, dry floor. º
Choose a large collection of incon-
gruous odds and ends, very big and
all ugly.
Lay them on the middle of the table.
Bandage your eyes and draw ends
and odds alternately with either hand,
but perfectly at random.
With the eyes still bandaged, sew or
gum all the odds on one side of the
thing and the ends on the other.
Remove the bandage from your eyes,
and throw the confection vertically
upwards with a spin on it, and catch
it on your head as it descends.
Pin it there instantly. This decides
which is the front and also on what
region of the head it shall be worn.
Avoid communication with persons
of taste and judgment during the
critical stages of construction.
If at the end your friend (not known
to be jealous) says, “That's something
like a hat,” you may know you have
failed.
There should be no resemblance.

MRs. EARLE won a high place in the regard of the
reading public by her first book, Pot-Pourri from a Surrey
Garden, which, I am not surprised to see, is flourishing
in its 29th edition. The claim will be strengthened by
her new work, Memoirs and Memories (SMITH, ELDER).
It has the charm of the Pot-Pourri style, of which
There is no particular order
a number of old family letters and papers locked up nearly
seventy years ago, in the cupboard of her father's library,
she sorts them out in leisurely fashion and sends them to
the printer. Her father's hoard was supplemented by
her mother's, and of these, linked up with some of
her own memories, she makes a charmingly disorderly
book. It purports to be written for, and is dedicated
to, her grandchildren, a circumstance that permits of the
introduction of much intimate family correspondence.
From the letters, dating as far back as the second decade
of the 19th century, we get interesting glimpses of the
past. Writing under date 1819, an uncle of Mrs. EARLE's
husband reports: “Mr. Buckland, in a letter received from
him this morning, says he lately went in a steam vessel
90 miles in little, if anything, more than 6 hours.”
Prodigious ! Mrs. EARLE's quick eye for good "copy” is
shown in varied instances. One is supplied by quotation
of the account of her parents' wedding, which appeared in
The Morning Post: “The bridegroom,” it is recorded, “was
supported on either side by the Marquis of Londonderry
and Lord John Russell. It gave us great pleasure to
remark this oblivion to political differences in the great
leaders of opposite parties whilst engaged in the more
pleasing duties of private life.” In the best passages of his
frequent burlesques of The Morning Post man of the Thirties,
THACKERAY never exceeded that delightful touch. From
childhood Mrs. EARLE has, over a period of 60 years, been
brought into close contact with many of the most interest-
ing people in literature, art and politics. She chats about
them in the simple artless fashion that conceals the
highest literary art.
In the days of Moll o' the Toll-Bar (HUTCHINson) there
were no County Councils, no half-penny press and no Mr.
WINstoN CHURCHILL. Their sermons finished, cock-fighting
parsons backed their own birds against all comers in bloody
combat in their own churchyards. Women who were
vagrants were stripped to the waist and flogged at the public
whipping-post till they swooned. Lovers were torn from
their lasses, as they walked the lanes, by men wearing the
King's uniform, and carried off, bound hand and foot, to
fight and, what is more astounding, to win their country's
battles on the high seas, side by side with the scum of the
nation. Starving men crept out on the hill-sides to search
for food for their starving wives and children, and were
hanged (sometimes, like the father of Mr. MASEFIELD's Nam,
when they were innocent) for stealing sheep. It was in
this Merrie England of a little more than a hundred years
ago that Lady Moll, as the Ullerdale villagers called her,
loved and was loved by Sir Harry Brackenthwaite. Miss

But I like it all the same, because I like her Lady Moll,
who was ahead of her time, as well as above her apparent
station in life. I like, too, to think that even in those
amazing days there were plenty of sweet Molls in England,
as there are still. Perhaps that was partly the reason
why we won our Trafalgars, in spite of the press-gangs
and the cock-fights and the bangings and the whippings
of vagrant (and voteless) women.

exceptionally readable novel, but it is also an able and
ingenious argument of Mr. C
engraved on the top so badly done that in several places
the metal was cut through.” The quotation is a good
example of the frank and somewhat pungent style in which
the whole memoirs are written. Their greatest interest
lies in their revelation of a personality rather arresting
than attractive; not so much an unconscious revelation, as
one conveyed deliberately, with that frank absorption in
self which is among the penalties, or the rewards, of the
artistic temperament. Anyhow, it is all exceedingly good
reading; and one cannot but regret that the story should end
abruptly, with the royal summons to Munich, at the begin-
ning of what should have been its most fantastic chapter.
G. CoMPTON on behalf of Lady
Wimborough, sometime Laura
Henderson. The short fact is
that she, having been induced
to take her honeymoon before
her marriage, and having been
left in some poverty with no
husband and one son, contracted
an other alliance with an
Gliental-minded but charming
Greek of the City, marriage still
being deferred. You are asked
to fall in line with the many
high-principled and clever men
and women who, some at once
and some after laborious con-
viction, forgive, exonerate, and
finally applaud her conduct.
So delicately and yet brilliantly
does her advocate state her case,
and such is her character shown
to be, that the defence must so
far have succeeded. But it goes
further; it urges that she is
typical of a class, small but
extant, and that the class must
at the least have toleration.
There I am not convinced.

high aim, went to the last
resource; the class more often

If I have any criticism to make
upon the two handsome volumes
in which Messrs. Constable
have issued the memoirs, it is a
regret that the person responsible
for this “authorised translation”
should not have been named
upon the title-page. The skill
with which the flavour of the
original German has been pre-
served in his rendering—e.g.,
such phrases as “dazzling re-
spectability,” applied by WAGNER
to the position of Court con-
ductor—deserves grateful recog-
nition by the many to whom
this book will be a delight.
If you read The Price of Em-
pire (BLACKwood) as I did, out
of doors on a very hot day, you
will find your hands slightly
embrued with scarlet, which,
combined with the ominous
hints contained in the earlier
chapters of the book, will give
you the gloomiest anticipations
of a terrible and tragic dénoue-
ment. Utilising the topical
theme of unrest in India, Mrs.
|HobART-HAMPDEN has written
a rather thrilling story of a con-
spiracy to murder the English
women and children in the
remote station of Pachor. The

attempted, to the view which, not entirely in ignorant
bias or conventional intolerance, sticks out for marriage
before honeymoon. The verdict, however, is left with the
jury of readers. My recommendation to them is to give
the matter their most careful attention, and by no means
to neglect the mass of irrelevant but wholly delightful
matter with which it is surrounded.
The announcement, made in the press a few days ago,
that an “unknown” work of WAGNER has been unearthed
at Dresden, in the form of an instrumental accompaniment
to the chorus of male voices written by the master for a
State command in 1843, comes as an interesting supplement
to his own account of the occasion, which I have just
been reading in My Life, by Richard Wagner (CoNstABLE).
Nothing, of course, is said here as to the instrumental
accompaniment, which was perhaps discarded as unsatis-
factory, WAGNER's comments being merely that “my
simpler song”—as compared with MENDELssohn's anthem
plot is complicated by the fact that the Assistant
District Commissioner is himself a Bengali, vowed
to the cause of emancipation and possessed of a
beautiful sister who attempts to entangle the young
civilian, Allan Tremaine. I cannot say that find
the development of the emotional drama overwhelmingly
probable, and it was not assisted by a rather conventional
style of narration. There are too many sentences like
“The thin veneer of civilisation restrained her ” (it is time,
I think, that civilisation found itself a new simile and be-
came a varnish, perhaps, or even a distemper). But the
tale moves well, and I gave a little gasp of relief to find
that, in spite of a badly split infinitive somewhere about the ,
hundredth page, the Empire retained its integrity to the end. ,

“It is said that the King's gift will take the form of an electric motor-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE.
[On the occasion of the Historic Costume Ball given in his honour,
June 20th.]
MAs TER, I would the scene were graced by you
When, richly dizened by the costume-drapers,
For your peculiar benefit we do
Our set quadrilles and honorific capers;
To miss in person this so flattering boom,
To have no part in our memorial melly,
Should make your hallowed bones assume
A restive air within the tomb
At Stratford-cum-Corelli.
Swift falls to some the meed of high renown;
At eve their fame is nil; they 've not begun it;
Next morning they're the talk of half the Town—
A column in The Daily Mail has done it. …
But, ere the country came to understand
That your performance furnished ample reason
For pomps of so superb a brand,
It took them just three centuries and
A Coronation Season.
But now the Smart Contingent “takes you up;"
For you, the very last of London's crazes,
Society consents to dance and sup—
The noblest monument it ever raises;
Not theirs to question—that were too abstruse—
Whether your actual merit more or less is,
But, like a charity, your use
Is to afford a fit excuse
For wearing fancy dresses.
Thus in their dinner-parties forth they go,
Plumed and brocaded, wigged and precious-stony—
Rosalind, Portia, Puck and Prospero,
... Strikingly reproducing your persona
All times and scenes—from Hamlet's Elsinore
To Juliet's “fair Verona” (quattro-cento),
Making for you, from out their store
Of rather vague historic lore,
A truly chic memento.
Master, if such affairs intrigue your ghost
Moving at large among the world's immortals,
You'll guess what motive bids this gallant host
Swarm to the masquerade through ALBERT's portals.
Is it your show or theirs? Of such a doubt
Your human wit will make a healthy clearance:
You'll judge that all who join the rout
Are solely exercised about
Their personal appearance.
And yet—God speed them at their “SHAKSPEARE Ball,”
Treading (on others' toes) the daedal dances,
Though some have never read your plays at all,
And some imagine you are BAcon (FRANCIs).
They serve an end ; their ticket-money buys
Solid material for the shrine we owe you;
And soon a temple's walls shall rise
Where, even under English skies,
People may get to know you.
ALL THE PREPARATIONS.
(By Mr. Punch's Own Special French Correspondent.)
I HAVE recounted you, my dear Colleg, how it is passed
itself that I have loued a chamber at Putney, faubourg
very agreeable situate on the bords of the Thames. For
to find it I have dued to sue blood and water, but now
I live like a cock in paste. It is a modest house, a quin-
caillery, and the proprietor names himself Bolus, droll
of name, but one must not regard to it of too near, for
my chamber has the air to be pulled to four pins. Even
at Paris, town of the propre chambers, one would not
find nothing of more propre. Mr. the quincaillier Bolus
is an honest boy. He speak not a word of French. “I
learn not the liego a school," he say, “and now it
is too late; the old dogs learn not tricks any more.”
I say to him “There is my affair,” I say. “I desire to
exerce myself to speak English.” He say, “Right, all
right; we shall not fall out, I daresay,” and me to answer
him, “Parbleu, no,” I say to him, “the bed is big enough
for that I do not fall out of it.” He places himself to
laugh. “Aha,” he say, “you are a joker; I like jokers.”
My little pleasantry, I make myself strong to say it, has
had a mad success, for he call Madame Bolus and repeat
it to her, and then he call his daughter Miss Bolus, and
she too has to pass by there, but she say, “Papa! how
you do run on,” and at the end I tend him my hand
and say, “Tap there, my old,” and he taps, and there
we are then friends. When I think at the detestable
McAndrews it is well the case to felicitate myself of
having had the courage to demenage from there. I believe
I have well pulled my pin out of the game. “
Chez Madame Bolus, there is not even difficulty about
the repasts. For my breakfast she between-opens the
door of my chamber and pushes me in on the carpet a
cup of coffee to the milk and some tartines of butter.
That suffises me; it is the habitude of us other Frenches.
And the coffee is of an excellence, but of an excellence
to make forget his salutel Never even in Paris I have
not gouted of better. It appear that Mister Bolus is
celebrate for his coffee in all the quarter. In the past
he has had as locatary a professor of the French tongue
who fell malad and was tendermently soigned by Madame
Bolus who deployed for him all the virtues of a guard-
malad. For reconnaissance, when he guerits, he give
Madame Bolus a dictionary French-English, veritable
trouvaille for me, though I have not employed him much
yet, and he insigns Mister Bolus the art of making the
coffee d la Française. “Truly,” says Madame Bolus in
recounting me this history, “we have not obliged an
ingrate.” Yes, they are brave peoples, these Bolus.
For the Crownment I have now a good billet at three
pounds, and I shall be at same to make you see that
grandiose spectacle with some French eyes.
Believe me, your all devout JULES MILLEFoſs.
[Post SCRIPTUM.—The time ecoules itself without that
we apperceive ourselves of it and there we are at one week
of the great eventment. I please myself to promenade me
in the streets of London. What a changement of decora-
tion | Everywhere workmen who chancel under the weight

all response he laugh, and then he say to me, “’Yes, the
whole world will be there, and a tidy lot more too.”

[JUNE 21, 1911.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TEN AND EIGHT.
THE only event of importance last
week was my victory over Henry by
ten and eight. If you don't want to
hear about that, then I shall have to
tell you a few facts concerning the
coming ceremony of the Coronation.
You'd rather have the other ? I
thought so.
The difference between Henry and
me is that he is what I should call a
good golfer, and I am what everybody
else calls a bad golfer. In consequence
of this he insults me with offers of
bisques. -
“I’ll have ten this time,” I said, as
we walked to the tee.
“Better - have twelve.
with eleven yesterday.”
“Thank you,” I said haughtily, “I
will have ten.” It is true that he beat
me last time, but then owing to bad
management on my part I had nine
bisques left at the moment of defeat
simply eating their heads off.
Henry teed up and drove a “Pink
Spot” out of sight.” Henry swears by
the “Pink Spot” if there is anything
of a wind. I use either a “Quo Vadis,”
which is splendid for going out of
bounds, or an “Ostrich,” which has a
wonderful way of burying itself in the
sand. I followed him to the green at
my leisure.
“Five,” said Henry.
“Seven,” said I; “and if I take three
bisques it's my hole.”
“You must only take one at a time,”
protested Henry.
“Why? There's nothing in Wisden
or Baedeker about it. Besides, I will
only take one at a time if it makes it
easier for you. I take one, and that
brings me down to six, and then
another one and that brings me down
to five, and then another one and that
brings me down-to four. There ! And
as you did the hole in five, I win.”
“Well, of course, if you like to waste
them all at the start—— ” -
“I’m not wasting them, I'm creating
a moral effect. Behold, I have won
the first hole; let us be photographed
together.” -
Henry went to the next tee slightly
ruffled and topped his ball into the
road. I had kept mine well this side
of it and won in four to five.
“I shan't take any bisques here,” I
said. “Two up,”
At the third tee my “Quo Vadis”
darted off suddenly to the left and tried
to climb the hill. I headed it off and
gave it a nasty dent from behind when
it wasn't looking, and with my next shot
started it rolling down the mountains
with ever-increasing velocity. Not
until it was within a foot of the pin
I beat you
did it condescend to stop. Henry, who
had reached the green with his drive
and had taken one putt too many, halved
the hole in four. I took a bisque and
was three up.
The fourth hole was prettily played
by both of us, and with two bisques I
had it absolutely stiff. Unnerved by
this Henry went all out at the fifth
and tried to carry the stream in two.
Unfortunately (I mean unfortunately
for him) the stream was six inches too
broad in the particular place at which
he tried to carry it. My own view is
that he should either have chosen
another place or else have got a
narrower stream from somewhere. As
it was I won in an uneventful six, and
took with a bisque the short hole
which followed.
“Six up,” I pointed out to Henry,
“and three bisques left. They're jolly
little things, bisques, but you want to
use them quickly. Bisque dat qui cito
dat. Doesn't the sea look ripping
to-day ?”
“Go on,” growled Henry.
“I once did a two at this hole,” I
said as I teed my ball. “If I did a
two now and took a bisque, you'd have
to do it in nothing in order to win.
A solemn thought.” .
At this hole you have to drive over
a chasm in the cliffs. My ball made a
bee line for the beach, bounced on a
rock, and disappeared into a cave.
Henry's “Pink Spot,” which really
seemed to have a chance of winning a
hole at last, found the wind too much
for it and followed me below.
“I’m in this cave,” I said when we
had found Henry's ball; and with a
lighted match in one hand and a mib-
lick in the other I went in and tried to
persuade the “Ostrich " to come out.
My eighth argument was too much for
it, and we re-appeared in the daylight
together.
“How many ?” I asked Henry.
“Six,” he said, as he hit the top of
the cliff once more, and shot back on
to the beach.
I left him and chivied my ball round
to where the cliffs are lowest; then I
got it gradually on to a little mound of
sand (very delicate work this), took a
terrific swing and fairly heaved it on
to the grass. Two more strokes put
me on to the green in twenty. I lit a
pipe and waited for Henry to finish his
game of rackets.
“I’ve played twenty-five,” he shouted.
“Then you'll want some of my
bisques,” I said. “I can lend you
three till Monday.”
Henry had one more rally and then
picked his ball up. I had won seven
holes and I had three bisques with
which to win the match. I was a
little doubtful if I could do this, but
Henry settled the question by mis-
judging yet again the breadth of the
stream. What is experience if it
teaches us nothing 2 Henry must
really try to enlarge his mind about
rivers. -
“Dormy nine,” I said at the tenth
tee, “and no bisques left.”
“Thank Heaven for that,” sighed
Henry. -
“But I have only to halve one hole
out of nine,” I pointed out. “Techni-
cally I am on what is known as velvet.”
“Oh, shut up and drive.”
I am a bad golfer, but even bad
golfers do holes in bogey now and
then. In the ordinary way I was
pretty certain to halve one of the
nine holes with Henry, and so win the
match. Both the eleventh and the
seventeenth, for instance, are favourites
of mine. Had I halved one of those,
he would have admitted cheerfully that
I had played good golf and beaten him
fairly. But as things happened
What happened, put quite briefly,
was this. Bogey for the tenth is four.
I hooked my drive off the tee and down
a little gully to the left, put a good
iron shot into a bunker on the right,
and then ran down a hundred-yard
putt with a niblick for a three. One
of those difficult down-hill putts.
“Luck!” said Henry, as soon as he
could speak.
“I thought I'd missed it,” I said.
“Your match,” said Henry; “I can't
play against luck like that.”
It was true that he had given me ten
bisques, but, on the other hand, I could
have given him a dozen at the seventh
and still have beaten him.
However, I was too magnanimous
to point that out. All I said was, “Ten
and eight.” -
And then I added thoughtfully, “I
don't think I've ever won by more than
that.” A. A. M.
“By-the-way, we have of recent days neglected
to inform our readers of the fact that Dr. W. G.
Price still continues, each Thursday evening, at
the hour of 8 p.m., to compel from the famous
grand organ attached to the northern end of our
vast Town Hall volumes of richest polyphony
and no end of (xquisite melody, accompanied by
either hand, in rhythmiest, traditional st Italian
method. The latter pleases the hoi polloi; the
former Bacchians; the cºgnoscenti few. In
simpler phraseology, the learned doctor, a worthy
successor to the famed Lemaire, opener of said
organ a few brief years ago, delights and
demands encores from audiences that should
be four times as large at least once a week, and
do not forget that that once is Thursday.”
Adelaide lºgister.
Unless The Daily Telegraph can think
of something really good in Coronation
week, it looks as though Australia will
retain the ashes.

How To KEEP cool.
[A private and more effective recipe than

WHEN I weary of infinite lays
(Like a hen) as the weather grows
hotter, - - -
When Pegasus languidly neighs,
And the Muse is a rotter, ,
And I envy the ducks in the park and
the seals at the Zoo and the otter;
When the dust eddies up from the
path
Which the wheel of the motor car
threshes, -
And no place allures but the bath,
And no drink refreshes,
And drives are all topped from the tee
and all services faint in the meshes;
Shall I list to the voice of the Press 2
Shall I purchase their hints for a
copper
On how I should cut down my dress
(Which would hardly be proper),
And only eat turnips and wear a huge
cabbage leaf under my topper?
Ah no! for the power of the mind
Is lord of the frailties of matter,
And food is so pleasant, I find,
And I don't think my hatter
|Would let me fit greens in his tile, and
I can't leave off clothes like a
satyr.
My thoughts I relentlessly switch
To souls who are fated to follow
Some calling contrasted with which,
When he worships Apollo,
The weaver of honey-sweet songs is as
cool as a cow in a wallow.
I think of the people who toil
For gold in the grasp of the City,
Of stokers and engine-room oil,
Of bakers all gritty
With germ of the standardized flour,and
of chaps on some futile Committee.
I think of the hind hoeing roots,
Of pedlars their articles hawking,
Of g ulants in very tight boots
(Blessed dreaml) who are walking
On shadowless plains with their loves
and expected to do all the talking.
I think of the men on the Mail,
I think of my butcher and grocer,
And when all these solaces fail
Am I comfortless? No, Sir!
I think, and revive at the thought, of
one place where it's fifty times
closer. Evoe.

PUNCII, OR THE
LONDON CHIARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracred From THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, June
13th-Back after Whitsun Recess—
at least, some of us. The children of
light, including PRINCE ARTHUR, still
linger in holiday byways. Colleagues
on Front Bench dutifully follow their
example; prevalent elsewhere, above
and below Gangway on both sides.
PREMIER in his seat, bronzed by fresh
air of Imperial Conference-room. Also
CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER, really
amused at the way folk talk about
magnitude and intricacies of Insurance
Bill. SPEARER still completing his
cure. DEPUTY-SPEARER in chair, ar-
rayed in sweet simplicity of dinner-
dress.
As usual, a more than half-empty
House is the Minister's opportunity.
Getting into Committee after brief spell
of Questions, it takes Ordnance Vote
in hand. Usually a stiff job. Closely
touches wages question, and workmen
have votes. Now the time and oppor-
tunity of testifying to local Member's
personal interest in the wage-sheet.
Not wholly neglected to-day. MARK
Lockwood, amongst whose con-
stituents are wage-earners in Govern-
ment factories at Waltham Abbey and
Enfield, insists on minimum pay of
thirty shillings a week. A mere trifle,
not comparable with the £400 a year
some honourable Members mean to
vote for themselves.
“Why,” exclaimed the Colonel, in-
stincts of Chairman of Kitchen Com-
mittee asserting themselves, “thirty
shillings for a week's work is less than
one-half some of us pay for a bottle of
wine at dinner.”
This sounds pretty high. Don't find
in wine list in dining-room any priced
at £36 a dozen. Must be a private
cuvée of Chairman of Committee.
Members move uneasily in their seats.
If it gets abroad that with their
shilling dinner they sip a £3 bottle of
wine it will make things awkward in
their constituencies. Can't talk any
more of necessity of reducing range
of subscriptions to local charities, or of
knocking off from their establishment
an odd groom or gardener's boy, all on
account of LLOYD GEORGE's extortion.
MARK quickly saw he had made
mistake. Dropping his costly bottle
of wine as if it were corked, dwelt on
peril hourly environing workers in the
danger-houses of the factories.
This brought up ACLAND with in-
genious speech. Sir Edward WATRIN,
whilst yet with us, used to say that
the safest place in the world was a
seat in the middle of a railway train
travelling at the rate of forty miles an

OFFICE, varying illustration to suit time
and circumstances, insisted that if a
man really wants immunity from
accident he should do a day's work in
the danger-buildings of a gun factory,
Cited figures to show that, according to
the percentage of accidents per man at
Woolwich, one could not expect to
enjoy more than one disaster in the
course of five hundred years.
As few of us attain that age,this seemed
complete answer to MARK Lockwood's
case. But the Colonel was out for the
evening. Determined to enjoy its full
privileges he took a division, his amend-
ment for reduction of Supply being
negatived-by-139 votes against 61. So
surprised was House to find there were
two hundred Members within hail that
it forth with adjourned, it being ten
minutes to six and a fine evening.

carried through Committee passed the
Report stage without controversy.

about precise date. Assumed that the
business would figure in programme of
next session.

it even been distantly alluded to in

AN APPEAL.
THE day draws nigh—that royal day, for which
London assumes her bravest, poor and rich
Hoping that all may pass without a hitch.
Now are the mid-street islands cleared away,
Whereto, from roaring 'bus or sounding dray,
The frighted traverser would leap, and pray.
Now the front windows on the route (or rowte)
Are duly blocked to persons looking out
By bare erections which before them sprout,
Whereon the carpenter suspends his din
To view, each day with livelier chagrin,
Luxurious luncheons going on within.
Now, too, in ever-growing hordes appear
Strange faces and strange garb from far and near,
Strange tongues fall strangely on the startled ear.
On every space the mounting seats rise high;
Tall masts of Venice lure the upward eye,
And cause collisions twixt the passers-by.
So London, heartened by a record Spring,
Arranges to acclaim her crownéd KING,
And to enjoy herself like anything. |
And on the day—that “day, which is not long"—
O Sun, when London's multi-coloured throng
Turns out regardless, going very strong,
I trust that thou wilt manfully decline
All monkey-tricks, and condescend to shine,
And, generally, make the weather fine.
Be it not thine, as often it has been,
With ill-timed levity to mar the scene;
Let all be decent, ordered, and serene.
With thy warm gaze, O blithe and jolly ball,
Illume this loyal land; let no rain fall,
For that, indeed, would be the deuce and all.
So shalt thou well requite the public's trust.
And yet—if anywhere—if rain it must,
Be it in London, where 'twould lay the dust.
For there are some who, leaving house or flat,
Propose to fly the gladsome scene; and that,
I may say, is the point I'm driving at.
Because, whate'er the London weather be,
If it should rain where I am, by the sea,
It would be simply tragical for me.

ILIE awake at night and bitterly ask
myself what I had to complain of in
the dear old days that are gone. Could
I but live them over again, enjoy but
one of those peaceful nights of long
ago, I should be content.
“There,” I should now say, smiling
blissfully as the shrill whistle awoke
me, “goes the 3.40.” I should wish
myself adieu, as I buried my head in
the pillow again. “Till 4.401” I
should say, sighing happily.
But as it is—
They have lately constructed a siding
under my window.
I asked Sisyphus the meaning of it.
I always ask Sisyphus. He has, poor
fellow, made a hobby of Explaining,
and when I tell you that each morning
I leave him rolling milk churns from
the wall to the edge of the platform,
and each evening I find him rolling
milk churns from the edge of the
platform to the wall, you will see why
I have not the heart to understand
without his help.
“Can you explain to me, Sisyphus,”
I said when I saw the direction in
which the partly-constructed line was
pointing, “why the Company has
decided, without consulting my wishes,
to run a branch line through my
kitchen 2''
“It's orlright,” he assured me, “it’s
a siding.”
It sounded innocent enough, and for
the time being I didn't give it another
thought.
A week or two later Sisyphus
proudly called my attention to its
completion.
I waxed enthusiastic and waned
sentimental. I compared it in my
innocence to a backwater. I regarded
it as a convalescent home where tired
engines would recuperate, or as a haven
of rest where veteians with one foot in
the scrap-heap would spend their last
days reviewing their strenuous lives
and boasting to each other of the
speed they made or the points they
jumped in their wild youth.
I was in error! By two o'clock that
very night I was disillusioned. I
don't know on whom I can throw the
blame of it all. I only know that some
impersonal, unassailable “they” began
at 1 A.M. to train yourg locomotives
under my very window. Hour after
hour I lay awake and listened. The
moment I closed my eyes some par-
ticularly inexperienced engine, confused
probably by the harsh shouts of the
coach, would be guilty of a crude and
amateurish mistake which invariably
caused its row of trucks to nudge each
other and guffaw with amusement.
The shriek of the 3.40, which had
previously been my chief dread, I
scarcely noticed. The rumble of the
4.40 seemed only a soothing messago
from an old friend whom, I blamed
myself, I had never properly appreci-
ated. It seemed to me that I had
wronged the 5.40, who, I now realised,
had only in all kindness tried to per-
suade me to enjoy the beauties of the
dawn. And the rattle of the 6.40 was
less like a noise than any rattle I have
ever heard.
At 7 o'clock I got up and looked out
of the window.
On that new siding upon which
I had been optimistic enough to
suppose I should witness nothing but
the admirable repose of age, an engine
was playing “Touch” with a truck
that was old enough to have known
better, and Sisyphus—yes, Sisyphus,
was playing “Hide and Seek” with
the truck.
-: º: + *: + + +
“Morning,” said Sisyphus as I came
on to the platform.
“I know,” I answered peevishly.
“That's why I got up.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 21, 1911.
THE INEVITABLE WARDE.
THE position is this: Warde loves
George, but George cannot stand the
sight of Warde. Unfortunately the
relations between their respective
fathers (in Yorkshire) is such that
George (in London) cannot say so.
For three years he put up with the
droppings-in of Warde and endured the
long-drawn agony of his automobile
conversations (there is nothing that
George detests so much as the inwards
of a machine) till at last he came and
sought my protection. We thereupon
determined to share a flat, and it says
much for my ingenuity and the offen-
siveness of my demeanour that Warde
has only got at George three times
during the year and then has never
stayed more than half an hour. Once
he got in during my absence, and
George, perspiring, gave himself up for
lost, but William, our friend and con-
fidant (who has the makings of a real
brute in him), intervened, and Warde,
departing in haste, is reported to have
said that, much as he admires and
loves George, he could wish that he
had made friends more worthy of
himself.
So far, so good. George, immune
from the worry of sparking plugs that
will not spark and forty-horse-powers
that are really fifty, grew fat and con-
tented. Paternal relations in the
country remained in accord, and
| William and I bore all the blame in
| London with light hearts and even some
pride. Then George, getting careless,
caught appendicitis, was borne off to a
nursing home, suffered a little, soon
began to convalesce and invited all
his real friends to come and watch him
doing it. Of these things Warde got
wind, and accosted William for further
details. Scarcely had William come
to me and warned me of the danger
ahead, when I was rung up on our
telephone.
“Can you tell me,” said a voice that
might have been anybody's, “the ad-
dress of the home where George is
being ill?”
“Yes,” I said, incautiously.
whom am I speaking 2"
“Warde," came the answer, and I
thought rapidly, but not too clearly,
how to get rid of my “Yes.”
“Erm Yes. Yes— Erm.
You know, poor old George is very ill.”
“I do, and I also know that he is
seeing people. He will be disappointed
if I don't go. Can you give me the
address 2''
“Well, not exactly.
always go there in a cab.”
“What do you say to the cabman 2"
persisted the voice.
“To
You see, I
“Quite so. What do I say to the
cabman 2 What, indeed? Something
like this. “Cabman, the person who
accompanies me will pay the piper
and must call the tune. Drive wher-
ever he tells you.’”
“Well, where do you send the
letters?” This on a querulous note.
“George never has any letters,” I
said, briefly.
“Nonsense. I wrote to him myself
yesterday.”
“Ah! That letter—the only one
George has ever had. I—we took it
round in a cab, and George got so
excited over it that a relapse is feared.
What he wants, in my opinion,” I
added, confidentially, “is absolute
quiet.”
“My father tells me——” began the
voice, and, in the light of all that the
voice's father had told it, it seemed
useless to pursue that line. So the
cross-examination continued, helped by
the fact that William had already been
in the box and made some damaging
admissions.
“Percy Street?” said I. “Well, I
never rightly knew, but now you
mention that name I confess that it
had just that look. Number 7, 17, 77
or was it 3A 2 You know I can see it
all in my mind's eye, but I can't just
describe it.”
“Oddly enough, that is exactly what
your friend William said. Is it on
the right or the left 2 " Warde is
immovable.
“I don't know what you will think
of me," said I, “but I never can
remember which is right and which is
left. To find out, I have to look at
my finger nails to see which are the
better cut. Now of course my rigl.u
hand is my better hand, but it doesn't
cut its own nails, so, when I have
looked, I get so confused let ween the
better hand and the better cut hand
that I have to get some scissors out
and try for myself then and there.
Unfortunately, when I go to see George,
I never have a pair of scissors in my
pocket.”
“Can't anybody tell me where the
place is 2" said the voice, positively
angry.
“Of course. Ilet me see. Have you
tried his doctor 2"
“ No. Where does he live 2"
“Ah! That I can tell you,” said I.
“Next door to George.”
2: + 3: +
Not to be beaten, the persistent
fellow wrote to George, and George
answered —“My very dear Warde,-
Your kindness is most touching and
appreciated." (There were two pages
of that.) “I am most disappointed to
have to confess that even I don't know
the address of this house. I arrived
here in a weak and unobservant state
of mind and, though I determined even
then to send for you as soon as
possible, I forgot to look at the
number. Of course I might ask, but
it seems so rude to my hostess to
appear not to know the number of the
house I am staying in. She is, I fear,
peculiarly sensitive." This was fol-
lowed by four repetitions of the original
statement and a most affectionate
conclusion.
Good for George! Unhappily, being
unmanned by his illness or carried
away by his enthusiasm, he wrote on
notepaper fully stamped with the num-
ber and all. From that Warde inferred
that George's need was greater even
than he had been told, and the worst
happened at once. It seems likely to
go on happening, unless the doctor can
be induced to say that appendicitis has
suddenly been discovered to be in-
fectious. Failing that, George must
suffer till he is loose again, and the
last straw, he tells me, is that Warde
refers to the human anatomy, and
particularly George's own, to illustrate
and explain what he means about
carburetters.
PATIENCE ON A WEIR.

And the roads are dry and dusty,
And the crimson may 's turned rusty
On the stems,
From a weir a maiden fishes,

You may watch the cane wand winnow
As it drops her dace or minnow

To a wrist
Tough as steel, but trim and tiny,
And as round as that of Phryne),
Where the stream spreads silver-shiny,
Sunbeam-kissed
With a heart that does not vary
See, she waits, a water-fairy
Come ashore in cool and airy
Linen drill,
While a kingfisher, down dashing
Where the schools of fry are splashing
Spots a rival, and goes flashing
With his kill !
Still at eve when swifts are plying
And the wasteful sunset 's dying -
You may see her light lure flying º
Up and out; º

THE gods were very good to Gaspard Cadillac, the
Provençal, once stoker on the Rhone, but now married and
living (in prodigious luxury, I should imagine) at Grande
Anse. When he killed his companion Yves on the island
where they were shipwrecked together, I remembered what
a deal of annoyance the Ancient Mariner had to undergo
about a mere waterfowl, and feared the worst for Gaspard,
especially when he fell into the clutches of that disre-
putable trader, Sagesse, who rescued him from his first
experience as a Crusoe. But the hero of The Ship of
Coral (HUTCHINsoN) had a knack of falling upon his feet,
and, though he was left upon the same island (marooned
this time) a few weeks after, there was a handy American
vessel in the offing to take him back to St. Pierre, his
pockets stuffed full of the hard-earned life-savings of a
defunct buccaneer, and with the prospect of hearing the
loud bassoon played at his own wedding feast. Mr.
H. DE WERE STACPoolE has written a novel of the right
sort, full of strange happenings on the high seas, with
excitement maintained to the very end, and a pretty love-
chapter thrown in. If I have a fault to find with it,
it is that the author's riotously luxuriant scene-painting
(excellent though it is) is apt to divert attention from
the movement of his drama, for one cannot imagine that
Monsieur Cadillac revelled in the magnificence of tropical
effects with the same cultured appreciation as Mr. STAC-
Poole. But The Ship of Coral is most certainly a book
to be read, and, if you feel that Gaspard drew an almost
unfair overdraught on the bank of good fortune, who, after
all, is better fitted to do so than a French sailor, and a
Provençal at that?
I have long regarded the stories of Mr. JACK LONDON as
a welcome relief from the dulness of most contemporary
fiction, and his latest, Burning Daylight (HEINEMANN) did
nothing to disappoint me in this respect. It has two very
excellent points, both of which should make for popularity.
First, it treats of one of those super-beings whose triumphs
and exploits we all, deep down in our hero-worshipping
hearts, love to contemplate; secondly, the period of the
tale is one of which the memory is still fresh enough to give
the reader a personal interest in it. This is the time of the
Klondyke gold discoveries, and the first—and to mythinking
decidedly the best—half of Burning Daylight's story con-
cerns his hardships and adventures in the frozen Yukon
country. No one who recalls the author's previous work
will need to be told with what wonderful skill the
atmosphere of this grim and unfriendly land is conveyed.
There is one chapter, especially, which tells how, for a bet,
Daylight raced two thousand miles over an unbroken trail of
ice and snow in sixty days, that seems to me absolutely the
best piece of descriptive writing of its kind that ever I read.
Later, when, with a fortune of eleven millions, Daylight
comes East to try his luck among the comparatively
civilized populations of San Francisco and New York, the
tale becomes more ordinary, and by so much less absorbing.
But the effect upon the hero of this new life is excellently
told. I shall not spoil the end for you with hints of its
nature; whether you find it wholly convincing or not (I
didn't) the book remains one that is quite worth anybody's
while to read for himself. Yes, Sirs! Every time !
If Miss CYNTHIA StockLEY was determined to take for
protagonist a perfect being of her own sex, whose ability
was as great as her virtue and her beauty infinitely more
amazing than either, she should never have allowed this

paragon to tell her story in the first person. Ladies will
detest Deirdre Saurin intensely and with reason, and even
a man, mg orately conscious of his own demerits, is bound
to dislike from the first a woman who tells him a dozen
times in the first twenty pages that she is charming in
every way; nor will he get to love her better when, with
cumulative egotism, she sets out in detail her triumphant
progress through all the minor feminine virtues to a climax
of ineffable self-sacrifice and positive saintliness. And yet,
granted the one touch of humour in the authoress or the
heroine which would have prevented this mistake or
have averted its disastrous effect, The Claw (HURST AND
BLACKETT) would have been more than readable, with its
impressive background of Africa and its faithful presenta-
tion of English people out of England but with all their
English limitations. The men are heroic, the women
properly feminine, and the rivalry for the love of Anthony
Kinsella is cleverly done. One could have followed with
pleasure the passionate history of the heroine herself, if
only her blatant self-satisfaction had been suppressed
for their portraits. Then we also have a very proper hero
“with the strength of a young lion" and “the sinews of a
Samson,” who moved enormous boulders so that he could
save the life of the enchanting heroine. Had Ivor lived in
this prosaic age he would have got his ‘blue' at :
Cambridge for throwing the hammer and putting the
weight; indeed I can almost imagine that he would have
caused anxiety to the scholars of Mr. RHoDEs at the Inter-
Varsity Sports. But in the century in which he lived feats
of strength were reserved to harass noxious noblemen and
to relieve distressed and beautiful damsels. Such feats Ivor
performed with unflagging energy, and though, considering
his intimate knowledge of French, I found him excessively :
modest in his use of that language, I am not prepared in
any other respect to accuse him of diffidence.
Mr. STANLEY PortAL HYATT says pretty definitely in
The Land of Promises (WERNER LAURIE) that you must
go to Africa to learn what happens there, and then you
must search Capel Court for clues to those happenings—
or to some extent kept
in hand.

ROMEO TO JULIET.
(With a personal explanation.)
THAT moment when I saw your starry eyes
Shining at SHAKSPEARE's Costume Ball,
I}lue as the blue of our Italian skies,
You had this Romeo's heart in thrall.
I said, “Of all the maids in Juliet's image
(I had already counted thirty-three
Fighting for breath in that historic scrimmage)
You are the one for me. - -
Not all were Juliets born, but some were made,
And most were frankly past their teens;
But you were IT-pure youth that asked no aid
Of artificial ways and means;
In you I found a hermitage (or haven);
No other features, coloured on the card,
Not even MARLBorough as the Swan of Avon,
Diverted my regard.
While Lady Capulet (your chaperon)
Slept in her thirty-guinea bower,
We took a balcony like Juliet's own,
, And talked like SHAKSPEARE by the hour:-
“If I be perjured, put a dagger through me!”
“This is so sudden!” “Yet I speak you true,
By yon electric moon I swear (beshrew me!).”
- “O Mr. Montague !”

THE CROWNMENT.
(By Mr. Punch's own Special French Correspondent.)
VERY DEAR AND HONourED CoNBROTHER,-Me there then
arrived at last to the great day aim of so many hopes
and prayers. What of times I have said me, “Jules
Millefois, my old, that night you must not sleep on the
two ears. The thing is grave. It goes there of the honour
of the French nation. Courage, my friendl With a little
of courage you will arrive to lift yourself of good hour and
the rest will be easy.” Mr. Bolus, his wife and his girl all
promise to help. They do not go themselves, but they are
excited on my count. The bonne-d-tout-faire is equalmently
excited. She swear she will wake me at 5 hours of the
morning. Mr. Bolus, too, he swear he will wake me at that
hour. He say, “Sleep in peace; I will wake you.” I say
him, “Foi de quincaillier, n'est-ce-pas ?” He say, “What's
that?" and I to reply him, with a smile fine and narquois,
“Faith of an ironmonger.” He regard me a little across
and he say, “What's the matter with my face anyhow 2 "
I say, “I have not made allusion to your face, my friend,”
and I try to explique to him the difference between face
and faith, but it appear I do not pronounce well the words,
and he becomes of more in more angry. But at the end
Miss Bolus arrive when I was on the point of lashing a
live word, and she say, “Don't be silly, Papa,” and she ex-
plique my words to him. Then he begin to twist himself of
laughing, and I laugh and Miss Bolus laugh, and there is the
thing raccommoded. I go to bed not without emotion, but
with much of confiance. - - -
At five hours of the morning precise, rassemblement of all
the family Bolus at the door of my room. They bat on the
door; the bonne-d-tout-faire bats also. I awake myself in
sursaut. How, it is already the hour? Thereover no
doubt. All the clocks of Putney are awake and signal the
hour with all their force. I jump in base of my bed.
“Thank you, my friends,” I say, “I will, dress myself,” and
with that I begin to make my little end of toilet. At five
hours and a half I have drunk the excellent coffee of Bolus.
I make my goodbyes, and me there departed with a little
flacon of eau-de-vie and a paquet of sandwiches, the gift of
Miss Bolus. , --
I march on foot. At first in Putney no crowd, but in
approaching of London itself the streets begin to fill them-
selves with a crowd always increasing. Always, more and
more automobiles and omnibuses and thousands cn foot
like me. Here and there I hear the sound 9f clairons. It
is the regiments who put themselves on route. I see one
and that makes me much emotion, for I also I have been
soldier. They are grand gaillards solidmently built, to the
bonnets of fur, grenadiers of the guard. I cannot empesh
myself of crying with high voice, “ Vive l'armée anglaise 1"
The Colonel to horse smiles and salutes me; a gross
sergeant gives me a clin of eye, and a passant taps me on
the shoulder and say, “Vive l'ontonty cordialy!” I hear
not but that everywhere. : -
At seven hours I am in my seat in Pall Mall. I arrive
there not without difficulty, but everywhere the policemens
give themselves much pain to aid me. Wonderful, the
policemens. No superfluous words, but everything quick
and efficace; and for the women and the children they are
like boats of sauvetage in the flood always increasing of
the crowd. And the crowd itself which stations on the pave-
ment pending hours, they are of a good humour to support
everything; and constamently they amuse themselves with
sallies and there they are who puff of laughter. I have
not seen one sole angry visage the whole day.
Quant to the KING and the QUEEN I born myself to say
that I have seen them, and I dare to say it they are well
worthy of the great nation of which they carry the crown.
Others will tell you how they were acclaimed everywhere
where they have passed in their golded carriage. For me
the vast crowd and the frenetic huzzas, there was that
which has overall impressioned me.
Au revoir, then, dear colleg. Tomorrow I make my
mails and return to Paris. I have still the heart all
gonfled with the noble spectacle at which I have assisted.
All to you, JULES MILLEFors.

You seemed to me, O man of blood and rage,
To do your duty nobly when you set
The hero trussed before a midnight train;

I liked it when, frustrated and o'erthrown,
You ground your teeth like mills of standard stone;
And several times I heard you say, “Ha-ha!”

And there,
When the June air
At dusk is cool and fair,
And the great roses strengthen on their
stalks,
Down the long path, beset
With heaven-scented, haunting
mignonette,
The gardeners say,
A little grey
Ghost-lady walks!
I haven't seen her, haven't heard her
legend,
Pale little shade, only the rumour tells
That 'tis her wont to wander to the
hedge-end,
And vanish near the Canterbury
Bells;
And so
I do not know
What sends her to and fro–
Murder, may be, or broken heart, or
gold.
I like to fancy most
That she is just some little lady's
ghost
Who loved her flowers
And quiet hours
In Junes of old !

TEIE CYNIC AT THE ALTAR.
PRICE is really quite an ordinary,
| primitive sort of person at heart, but
he has a reputation amongst us for
unconventional ideas and a decadent
point of view. He reſerred to his en-
gagement as “this regrettable entangle-
ment,” and, when he asked me to be
his Best Man, he took care to write
that “a lady having proposed marriage
to him and having shown no signs of
relenting, he supposed it was up to him
to put in an appearance at the church,
and to go through the solemn farce
|of giving his formal consent to her
| autocratic designs.”
for we all felt that Price, when he was
| married, would have to give up saying
that sort of thing, and therefore one
I agreed willingly,
of us ought to be near by to take a
note of his last utterance.
The great day came, and the bride
in her white Je-ne-sais-quoi looked
charming, the bridegroom pale but
prepared, and the parson much as
usual. With the help of a little stage-
management from a discreet curate we
succeeded, at the appointed time, in
being at the chancel steps; the bride's
father, the bride, Price and myself, in
the customary formation.
“Wilt thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife?” asked the parson of
Price, and I thought for a second that
he was going to seize his opportunity
and make his great remark then. But
no ; he merely, as he would have
himself described it, politely acquiesced.
“Wilt thou have this man to thy
wedded husband 2" asked the parson
of the bride. “I will,” said she.
“Ah!" whispered Price in my ear,
“I was afraid she would." . . .

[JUNE 28, 1911.
PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
O.H.M.S.
This is not in the least amusing. If
anybody laughs about it, it will be in
the worst taste. I appeal to my readers
for their sympathy in this unhappy
business.
Very likely I shall be asked to retire
from the Bar—a profession which I
have followed, albeit without con-
spicuous success, at least with dignity,
these many years.
My little daughter, Felicity, while
she admits herself that she was the
prime mover and principal performer
in our mistaken enterprise, refuses
point-blank to face the music with me.
“I cannot go to gaol with you,
Papa,” she says. - -
“You will look very pretty in the
dock,” I reply, to tempt her.
“I have nothing to wear,” she says,
“and, besides, there is that children's
dance on next week. I will come to
your cell each day, Papa, and bring you
strawberries and things.”
The above conversation has just ter-
minated as I take up my quill to write
and thus relieve the bitterness of my
mind.
I think, perhaps, the ultimate re-
sponsibility rests with her uncle, who
took her to see the launch of a Dread-
nought, or some such craft, whereat a
lady of title performed the christening
ceremony—a foolish proceeding which
appears to have made an impression on
my little girl's mind. It seems that a
bottle of champagne is broken upon
the bows on such occasions—a most
reprehensible waste of my favourite
beverage.
It was one morning last week that
I was seated in my study, which con-
tains some fine examples of the art
nouveau style of furniture, when my
daughter burst suddenly through the
door, with the flush of the June morn-
ing on her pretty fair cheeks.
“Where are your manners, Felicity?”
I asked.
“Write a letter, Papa,” she cried,
“quick, quick—write a letter.”
“Certainly not, my child,” said I; “I
have no wish to write a letter. I wrote
one last year and never got an answer.”
“But you're writing one now,” she
said ; “send that.”
“This, my child, is a poem for Punch.”
“Well, that will do,” she said. “I
must go and get the flowers.” And she
departed without further explanation.
Marvelling greatly, I folded it into
an envelope. It has not hitherto been
my custom to send flowers with my
contributions. Perhaps that is the
reason they are never accepted. It
struck me that my little girl had very
original ideas.
I had scarcely addressed the en-
velope when Felicity returned with a
mass of roses stolen from the drawing-
room, a large bottle of blue-black ink,
and a Post-office Directory, handsomely
bound in red.
Up to this point—except, perhaps,
in trying to write a poem for Punch—
I had behaved in an entirely rational
manner. It was when, after accepting
the above articles from my daughter's
hands, I obeyed her request to follow
her down the carriage drive, that I was
too easily led and found myself event-
ually within jeopardy of legal process.
My mind was filled with doubts at
the time as to the wisdom of the per-
formance, but explain it how you will
the fact remains that I fell in with
Felicity's wishes and followed her
through the lodge gates into the high-
way. -
There a strange and unexpected
sight met my eyes. Where but yester-
day had been a barren side-walk, there
had arsen in the night an object
familiar enough in itself, but strange
in its sudden apparition. A brand-new
pillar-box stood before me.
in the sunlight.
“Isn't he a dear?” said Felicity.
“Look at his mouth. I think he has
the darlingest expression.”
“Yes,” I said, “it is really a very
fine specimen. Was it this you brought
me out to see ?”
Thereupon she explained the situ-
ation. It appeared that I was the
Mayor of the town, and that she was
Lady Felicity Postle-Lauder, who had
graciously consented to christen the
pillar-box and post the first letter.
It struck me at the time that it was
a foolish proceeding, but not wishing
to disappoint my daughter I consented,
and together we decorated it with
the roses. A small bunch Felicity
retained and tied round the bottle
of ink.
When all the arrangements were
completed, she spoke as follows:—
“Mr. Mayor will now read the
address.”
“I regret,” I began, “that I have
come completely unprepared with
an 1–"
“Out of the Directory,” she prompted,
“it’s full of them.”
I opened the book and began to read
in a loud clear voice.
“That is enough,” said Felicity
presently; “now give me the letter.”
My daughter assumed a majestic
attitude before the flower-decked pillar-
box, with the letter in one hand and
the bottle of ink in the other. After a
dramatic pause, she pushed the letter
into its mouth and brought the bottle
It shone ||
down with a crash upon its head.
About two pints of blue-black ink
streamed over its face.
“I name thee Philip,’” she said.
I felt that a few further words were
expected from me and so I proceeded
as follows: -
“Philip,” I said, “take up thy
humble burden. A time will come,
Philip, when thou wilt be a great and
famous letter-box. I look into the
future, Philip, and see ->
“And see the postman coming,” broke
in Felicity, who was looking up the
road.
Whereat the performance came to an
abrupt conclusion, and we dispersed
rapidly into the garden.
“A beautiful ceremony,” said Felicity,
sitting upon the arm of my study chair
that evening, with her arms round my
neck and her dimpled cheek held up
for a good-night kiss.
“Yes,” I said. “The only thing that
went wrong was ”
“What 2 ” -
“I forgot to stamp the letter. I'm
afraid it will be prejudicial to the suc-
cess of my poem.” -

The next morning an important-
looking missive arrived upon the break-
fast table. -
“What is it?” asked Felicity, stop-
ping with her porridge spoon in the
alr.
“I think, probably,” I said, “I have
been asked to join the staff of Punch.”
“No. Impossible, Papa.”
Then I opened it, and immediately
all my appetite was taken away. It
was an alarming letter from somebody
“On His Majesty's Service,” and ran
in this wise No, I will not give its
contents. The subject is rather painful
and sub judice.
THE RUBBER BATH.
I of TEN think that we might use it
more if it were watertight. It is a
twenty-seven inch bath, and it cost me
thirteen-and-six. You can get them
up to thirty-six inches, but the large
ones are not to be recommended; they
are very difficult to control, and some-
times get quite out of hand. It shuts
up very neatly and goes into a bag,
and it is important to remember that
it should not be folded up wet. When
you open it out on the floor it looks
more or less like any other bath, only
wobbly. It appears to have no sort of
fixed outline, if you understand me.
But as soon as you pour in the water
it stiffens up all right. The real
trouble begins when you try to empty
it. You don't learn how to do that
without a pretty careful education.
The wrong way to do it is for two

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
people to get hold of it at once. My
wife and I used to try that way, but
we simply couldn't work harmoniously
together. Quite against our will the
thing degenerated into a contest. I
used to get into my oilskins, and my
wife slipped on her mackintosh, and
then we faced each other, one at each
side, and took hold. We soon found
that it wasn't a question of strength
or balance or knack; it all depended
upon who could get the first grip. If
you were half a second late you got a
tremendous cascade about the ankles.
For when it is in really good form it
can throw the water six or eight feet
across the room. -
Of course there is a way in which it
can be lifted, if you get a throttle hold
on it in four places at once. Then it
becomes a mere bag, and a jolly
unwieldy one at that. Perhaps the
soundest method—though it takes
longer—is just to bale it out and dry
off with blotting-paper.
I often think, as I said, that we
might use it more if it were watertight.
That is really its weak spot. I might
have known at the beginning, but I was
persuaded by the Scotchman.
I bought it from a Scotchman in a
little shop in Holborn. I made him
give me a full demonstration of the
working of it. He put it on the floor
and filled it, showing the admirable
effect of the stiffening-up process. He
then went on to explain how it was
emptied. He was in such a tearing
hurry to get to this part of his expo-
sition that he only allowed the water
to remain in it for about ten seconds.
I can see now that that was where he
scored. Even as it was there remained
a beautiful circular patch of moisture
on the oil-cloth where the bath had
been. He tried to kick a rug over it,
but I was too quick for him.
“It's not watertight,” I said bluntly,
—I am blunt sometimes.
“Oo ay,” said he. “She's pairfitly
watertight.”
I pointed to the mark on the floor
without a word.
“Hoots,” said he soothingly, “that's
naething. It's merely the naitural
moisture. It's no damp.”
“It escaped from the bath,” said I
sternly.
“Escapit?” said he.
“Leaked,” said I.
“Not at all,” he reassured me. “It’s
| a species o' mist. Congealed, one
micht say.”
“But how does that happen?” I
º determined to get to the bottom
of it.
“It's the temperature o' the floor.
It's a warm day, ye see. Pityer hand

Ye micht go so far as to say it was

“But I don't see why the floor
should be wet,” I maintained.
The Scotchman sat down and began
patiently to explain. His defiant atti-
tude had subsided, and there was a
sweet reasonableness about his manner,
as of one who is instructing a little
child.

Myself, I address him as SIDNEY BELGRABIT.

He'd a way of pronouncing amdbit, “amābit"—
And his master would frequently censure BELCI, ABIT.

He hits local bowling for sixes and fours,
And when he's exhausted by running he'll cab it

For bream (though it happens there ain't any bream),

I must not omit his success with the gun.
Shooting over the Moors, he can pick off his rabbit
With quiet precision. Wive SIDNEY BELGRABIt

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted from The DIARY of Toby, M.P.)

homoeopathic doses. Resumed last
Tuesday after brief Whitsun holiday.
To-morrow break up again for Coron-
ation Recess; coming back next Mon-
day bringing the Lords with us. Then
or soon after will come the tug-o'-war.
This intervening week has been one
of exceeding dreariness, varied only by
LLoyd George's onslaught on critics
of his financial policy who attribute to
it not only recrudesence of overgrown
blue-bottle flies in butchers' shops but
the collapse of Birkbeck Bank. Next
week business will really begin. Decks
have been cleared for action and shotted
guns will be fired. The Lords, who
have almost forgotten they passed
LANsdown E's Reform Bill, which
abolished time-honoured system of
hereditary legislators, will go into
Committee on that really substantial
measure, the Parliament Bill.
What Will They Do With It? is a
question even Lord Lytton, having
hereditary connection with the problem,
is unable to answer. There remains
nothing for us but to wait and see.
What is certain is that, after strictly
limited period of waiting, we shall see
far-reaching change in Constitution.

Report probably takes its origin
from undeniable fact that CHAIRMAN

at a luncheon specially cooked en

of a submerged art. Too often is found

the feast, MARK Lockwood, whilst
admitting its general excellence, mur-
murs at the memory of the lamb
cutlet garnished with green peas.
“The lamb,” he remarked, with the
native shrewdness that stamps his deal-
ing with loſtier Parliamentary affairs,
“was, I believe, a cut from the loin of
a goat. As for the peas, they were so
under-done they were more suitable for
the filling of the shoes of a pilgrim on

MR. PUNCH*S SUPPLEMENTS.
THE RIVER.
It was a lucky chance, as the old
lady remarked, that set the Thames
flowing through London; for otherwise
those speculators who purchased the
County Council steamers at a hun-
dredth or even a thousandth part of
their cost, only a year or so after they
were built, would have had no such
bargains; nor would the sea-gulls that
in the winter time crowd about Black-
friars Bridge obtain anything like such
good nourishment as now.
The Thames may be divided for
purposes of study into two sections—
the river below, say, Hammersmith
Bridge, and the river above it. Below, it of Parliament by the late GUILo FAUx.

suspicious hour in the early morning.
It is notable also for a statue of
BoADICEA, at one end of it, qualifying for
St. Thomas' Hospital, at the other end,
by standing wholly without support
in a chariot drawn by prancing horses.
TEA ox THE TERRAcE.
This institution, which so pleasingly
illustrates the growing amenity of
political life and the temperance of
our times, was started by Mr. KETTLE,
|M.P., and Mr. HoRNIMAN, late M.P.
for Chelsea. Or it would be more
correct to say that they revived it,
since there is evidence that gunpowder
tea was first introduced at the Houses
adherents. On the other hand, a few
friends of the Butterfly, remembering
certain gleams of originality in his talk
and behaviour, cannot but hope that he
did not learn quite everything he knew
from his youthful associate. Anyhow,
between them they gave the river at
Chelsea a huge advertisement.
THE BoAT-RACE.
Once a year the Thames from Putney
to Mortlake is given up to the inter-
University boat-race between Oxford
and Cambridge. As the athletes who
have taken part in these contests in
the past have all achieved distinction
either as Judges, Bishops or Stock-
brokers, the popularity of the insti-
tution may be readily imagined. The
above, to pleasure.
Below, it may be called
above, locks.
It is the lower part to
which Mr. John BURNS
was referring when he
epigrammatically des-
cribed the Thames as
“liquid history.” For
that is what it is—
liquid history. One has
but to look at or even
fall into it to know that
it is liquid; while, as for
history, are not the
Tower and the Houses

bank, and Battersea

fact that the race is
always rowed on the
Thames has, of course,
placed the Cantabs at a
decided disadvantage.
The first mention of
sliding seats is to be
found in the poet
SPENSER, who speaks
of the “silver sliding
Thames,” though some
critics see in the word
“sliding” a reference
to the great frost in
1515, when the Thames
was frozen overand oxen
were roasted whole on
its surface. The prac-
tice of roasting oxen
partially was given up
at an earlier date, in
deference to humani-
tarian protests.
Boulter's Lock.
The original Boulter
who gave his name to
this famous Sunday re-
and Surrey would either
never meet or would have to cross in
boats. But as it is they mix freely with
each other, thanks to this great boon.
The bridges of London are numerous,
and another one will shortly be added
as soon as the architects and experts
have finished wrangling over its
position and the exact amount of St.
Paul's Cathedral which those who
cross it from south to north are to see
in their progress.
Of those already in existence the
Tower Bridge is at once the lowest
and the loftiest. There is no bridge
between that and the open and often
exceedingly unquiet sea. Just below
the Tower Bridge is the Pool of London,
where old Father Thames has his
clothes made; and then come the
docks. London Bridge is famous for
having once had houses on it. West-

and the political views of the consumer.
It is worthy of note that the reporters
of the Radical papers generally charge
their fountain pens with cocoa nibs.
SPORT.
Within the memory of many living
Londoners excellent sport was enjoyed
on the banks of the great metropolitan
waterway. Badgers nested in Pimlico
as late as the year 1866, and snipe
were shot in Battersea fields by Mr.
CHELSEA AND BATTERSEA.
These two riverside townships ºne
on either side of the Thames were dis-
covered, as picturesque spots, either by John BURNs at a much later date.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I RECOMMEND to your particular notice a collection of
stories under the title of Members of the Family (MAC-
MILLAN). Even if they were not from the pen that wrote
The Virginian, I would none the less heartily commend
them. Mr. Owen WISTER does not and, I think, could not
claim to be a deep psychologist or a subtle analyst of human
motives; like many other Americans, he is in that business
frankly sentimental and not often correct. But his imagin-
ation and the creatures of it are a positive delight: his
sense of atmosphere is perfect; his style is so effortless and
unlaboured as to lead you to believe that writing books is
a matter of the greatest ease: and his “In the Back” is as
good as the best of RUDYARD KIPLING or BRET HARTE or
whatever writer of English you regard as the master of the
art of the Short Story. He tells us of the untamed West,
the Cowboy, the Tenderfoot, the Indian, and in particular of
Scipio, the undaunted, undefeated and incomparable Scipio
Le Moyne. Herein is my only quarrel with the clever
illustrations of Mr. H. T. DUNN. The Scipio of his
picture is an excellent individual, but not my idea of that
humorous vagabond. I doubt if he (or any other of Mr.
WISTER’s people) is capable of being illustrated. They do
not belong to this cold and unpractical world. They are a
delicious race apart, not born to be criticised but created
to be laughed with and loved. The author in his preface
asks if we will forgive him a preamble of gossip, of retro-
spection. For my part, I will forgive him anything
provided he never allows me to forget him.
Dr. FARQUHARSON, having retired from Parliament with
the well-earned guerdon of a Privy Councillorship, a dis-
tinction that satisfied the desire alike of Sir Robert PEEL
and Mr. GLADSTONE, has written some memories of his life
In and Out of Parliament (WILLIAMs and NorgaTE). The
story opens with chapters descriptive of life in Edinburgh,
with the Guards, with whom he served as Medical Officer,
at Rugby under TEMPLE, and of social life in his native
county, Aberdeenshire, which he represented at Westminster
for twenty-six years. These last comprise a momentous
epoch compared with which our present prosaic Parliament,
albeit engaged upon what is described as revolutionary
procedure, is as water unto wine. The Member for West
Aberdeenshire did not take prominent or persistent
part in debate. But he was in constant attend-
ance, and when he interposed was listened to with
that attention the House reserves for special favourites.
If a fault may be hinted at in a book full of charm it is
that it is a little monotonously good-natured. To the
genial Doctor everyone is the best of good fellows, living
in the very best of worlds. It must be said that the
sentiment was reciprocated, every section and party
delighting in the Doctor. The book contains several por-
traits, some reproduced from these pages. The most

headed, with hand outstretched, he addresses the throng.
The peculiarity of the situation is that it is represented
by a single figure partly obscured behind an empty
chair. The general effect is almost uncanny—the
animated orator and a vanished audience, apparently
swept out of the garden by the torrent of eloquence
falling from the lips of the Hon. Member.
For my part, whenever nowadays I see the name of
Mr. GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM on a title-page, I already begin
to chuckle, knowing that I shall certainly have to do so
before I have read half a chapter, though with quite a
possibility that at the end I shall look back and reflect

finely sympathetic record of adventure on the Surrey side.
There is, indeed, a sane and all but jolly optimism, be-
gotten not of complacent ignorance but of knowledge
hard-won and at first-hand. Of such come the chivalrous
hopes that alone breed action. Not much scope, of course,
for direct humour in a theme of which the text is—“the
blight which kills half a garden's roses surely spoils the
rest"; but, as in the life this chronicle describes, so here
there is laughter to set against the tears, and there are the
kindling virtues of courage, pity and love; not a touch
of self-conscious sentimentalism, but shrewd strokes of
criticism and some tentative, wise suggestions. A work

BIRMINGHAM's peculiar gift, you can imagine, and will

he creates out of such slender material. Still, I have not
hidden my feeling that there might have been a little
more in the intrigue with advantage to the tale (I was
disappointed, for example, when the visit of the Lord-
Lieutenant passed off so quietly, quite against what up
to the last moment had been my pleased anticipation);
but the fact that, even so, it was never boring serves to
increase my admiration for its author.

Hº owes her fortune—and her
isolation—to whisky. On the other hand, we have for hero
an Irishman of good family who has taken to journalism
in California and returns home to straighten out the affairs
of his sister-in-law and nephew. Everybody takes it for
granted that he is a millionaire, and when the heroine
discovers the truth she writes him down most unjustly as
a fortune-hunter. The author's style is at times old-
fashioned—modern young men do not call ladies on horse-
back “ fair equestriennes"—and his treatment recalls the
manner of LEveR, though it lacks the high animal spirits
of LEveR's early novels. The dreadful squireen, Mat
O'Hara, dominates three-fourths of the book, and his violent
end only increases his prominence. Ireland, as depicted by
Mr. JEssop, is, we fear, “a grand country to live out of."
But, though his novel cannot be pronounced exhilarating, it
is pleasantly written and deserves better paper and binding.
