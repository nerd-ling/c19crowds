“MR. J.ENKINS.”
I LIKE to think of him as one who spent
His manhood in an atmosphere of schism,
Flouting the grim proprieties that went
To make the period of the prune and prisºn,
Who for conventions did not care a lira,
And frankly loathed the Mid-Victorian era.
'Twas in the days of crinolines and (worse)
Of crude embroidery and cruder painting;
When England's youth betook itself to verse
And maids were periodically fainting,
That Mr. Jenkins timed an apt arrival
To preach his famous drawing-room revival.
He did not waltz, he did not care for whist,
For pressing ferns or pokering a panel,
And, fresh from Paris, naturally miss'd
The joie de vivre in vogue across the Channel,
So, as became his Continental schooling,
He taught mankind a livelier mode of fooling.
He took a table, set the players round,
Piped “hands below,” that so the nimble shilling
Might pass unseen, a part the ladies found
A trifle bold, yet infinitely thrilling;
Each seeks the coin and, while the fingers fidget,
Our Mr. J. doth squeeze Clarissa's digit.
The game caught on : “Up, Jenkins” was the cry
In hall and cot, in vicarage and tavern;
Dxtreme Dissenters tried it on the sly,
And every smuggler played it in his cavern;
And thus it was that Jenkins earned his laurels
As one who 'd ruined Mid-Victorian morals.
-k -k + *k -k -k ×
He's dead and gone, yet, when the rafters reel
With shouts that bid the palm-locked line untether,
We (she and I) are horrified to feel -
A ghostly grip that holds our hands together—
A fact observed by none, save me and Mabel—
'Tis Mr. Jenkins underneath the table l i
How they encourage Art in India.
“The Scarlet Serenaders will shortly arrive in Naini Tal. Thir

[JULY 5, 1911.
CHARIVARIA.
The New York Herald, in reporting
Mr. PIERPONT MoRGAN's appearance
in Court dress at the Coronation, re-
marked, “Mr. Morgan has as neat a
calf as anybody.” Why not? He, if
anyone, can afford it.
The report that Mr. S. J. SolomoN,
R.A., was to paint the official picture
of the Coronation turned out to be an
under-statement, this distinguished
artist having been actually com-
missioned to execute a drawing of the
ceremony for The Daily Mail.
:: :::
We are sorry to learn that a large
number of Scotch visitors had their
enjoyment of the Royal Progress
entirely spoilt by knowledge of the fact
that similar seats to those for which
they had paid a guinea long before the
event were sold for five shillings on
the day itself. In every instance, when
the fact became known, mortification
set in. - * * * -
A foreign representative remarked
that the Royal Progress met with an
even more hearty reception in South
London than on the other side of the
river. This is scarcely remarkable.
The rich southern blood of the people
across the water naturally makes them
more excitable and demonstrative.
The memento-hunters were hard at
work during the Corºnation week. In
the Borough Road there was a scramble
for the flowers and plants with which
the stands had been decorated, and in
the West End some fortunate person
secured the Lord MAYOR's gold watch.
:: :
We do not want a repetition here of
the trouble in Morocco, and we think
the police were wise to arrest a Pre-
tender who was found walking down
Park Lane with a large gilt crown on
his head, copiously jewelled with glass.
The menu at the Royal Luncheon at
the Guildhall was printed in English.
We believe this innovation to be due
to the fact that previous menus have
been found to puzzle the French guests.
:k :::
It is hoped to hold a Progress-of-
Peace Exhibition next year at the
Crystal Palace—wars permitting.
:: :::
One of the chief functions on the
occasion of the royal visit to Dublin
will be, we are told, the Special
Chapter of the Knights of St. Patrick,
at which Lord SHAFTEs B J Y and Lord
Kitch ENER will be invested. This, we
suppose, will be the Opening of a New
Chapter in the History of Ireland, of
which we have often read.
Rumours of another appointment for
Lord KITCHENER reach us. It is said
to be due to his historic success against
the Dervishes. His Lordship, accord-
ing to our information, is to join the
board of a well-known firm of Rout
Furnishers. :: *k
>'s
Lord RosBBERY has announced that
he will not adopt his new title, the
Earl of Midlothian, “for general use.”
He will use it merely on Sundays and
Bank Holidays. • * * *

A laundry mark on a handkerchief,
left behind after a burglary at a shop
in Garrick Street, led to the arrest of
the supposed criminal last week. This
explains why shrewd burglars so seldom
have their handkerchiefs washed, while
some dispense with them altogether.

Playgoers in search of an absolute
novelty are now going to see “The
Girl Who Couldn't Lie.” --~
Our congratulations to The Daily
News for publishing at least two items
of exclusive information concerning our
Navy. KING GEORGE, we are told, has,
in his time, not only swabbed the deck
and fed the fire, but has also “furled
the mast.” Further, “our eight Dread-
noughts represent a total tonnage of
523,650,” thus averaging over 65,000 t
tons apiece. Prodigicus!—not to say,
grateful and comforting.
“Two-year-old twins who fell from
the second-floor window of a house in
Hamburg were,” The Erpress informs
us, “uninjured.” The fortunate couple
will, we presume, adopt as their motto
the paradox, “United we fall.”
- :: ::
The Times has published a letter on
“Losses of Sheep in Hunts.” We can
only imagine such losses to be due to
the fact that many of our sportsmen
suffer from short sight. -

“We must bring religion into the
realms of statesmanship,” says Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE. This should not be
impossible. The CHANCELLOR has
already succeeded in bringing politics
into the purlieus of the pulpit.

cording to the Petit Parisien, an
Englishwoman riding home in a taxi-

You just obeys your orders? Wery good.
But one stout plank, amid the serried tiers,
A single section where a bard has sat,

When I remember how; before the day,
I sang its praises, telling all men where
I should behold the pomp, and heard them say,
“Yes, you will see it rather well from there; "
And how I sank a most stupendous sum
To purchase it, and all the weary hours
I waited for that glittering coach to come,
And longed for soft, soft valleys strewn with flowers;
And how I might not smoke, though very sweet
That boon had been, nor kick the man below,
But martyr-like endured it, when my feet
Sank into baleful slumbers, toe by toe;
And watched the crowd, the troops and the police
And wondered what a gryphon was and why;
And if KING GEORGE would note my trousers' crease
And pale, but not disloyal, gloves and tie;—

No softer roost than this, I say, he found,
And braved it gladly, for on this he saw
The golden pageant when KING GEORGE was crowned."

AT THE PLAY.
THE GALA PERFORMANCE AT
His MAJESTY's.
THE judgment of those who attend
a morning Dress Rehearsal is generally
supposed to be very valuable, but
actually it is of the least critical use
in the world. Apart from the Press,
who refrain from applause and reserve
their censure for the papers, the
audience consists largely of members
of The Profession and personal friends
of the actors. They have therefore
either been trained in the same stage-
traditiens, good and bad, or else they
love their favourites as much for their
foibles as for their virtues. But at
His Majesty's nothing mattered very
much, for a Coronation spirit (unham-
pered by police and the fear of barriers)
was abroad and nobody wanted to be
critical even if he could.
The charm of this Gala Rehearsal
was that it gave you the rare pleasure
of seeing distinguished actors con-
descending to inferior parts. The iden-
tity of some, playing as mere supers
and units of a crowd, was almost
concealed under a veil of the finest
humility. Thus, our new stage-
knight, behaving just as if the honour
about to be conferred upon him
was quite a common thing among
actor-managers, did nothing beyond
getting his halberd mixed up with
the halberd of another veteran.
The programme was for all
tastes — the lighter kind for
choice. Miss ELLEN TERRY and
Mrs. KENDAL were in rollicking
mood in the letter episode from
The Merry Wiccs. Here the
rotundity of Mr. RUTLAND
BARRIngron, as Falstaff, was
momentarily admitted on to the
stage (without the author's con-
nivance) for the purpose of
rounding eff the scene.
As David Garrick, Sir CHARLES
WYNDHAMr simulated intoxication
(for moral purposes) with all his
old verve and masterſul ease;
Mr. WEEDON GRossMITH, careful
not to be as funny as he could
have been, was Jones; and
Miss SYDNEY FAREBROTHER was
a very perfect Araminta.
In the rostrum-scene from 2
Julius Caesar (taken full-face
instead of in profile), the crowd
was so terribly true to life that
it almost overwhelmed the chief
actors. These Romans had been
admirably stage-managed, but I
confess to having found some
difficulty in distinguishing be-
tween the noise of their anger
and the noise of their approval,

and both must have been alike offensive
to Antony (Sir HERBERT TREE) in his
heroic struggle to make himself heard.

one could wish for. Mr. BourchIER

personal names or, more fraternally,
as “dear."
BEN Jonson, again, was barel
recognisable in his Vision of Delight—
a very firmament of theatrical stars
of the first or second magnitude. I
could grow lyrical on this theme, and
Mr. HERBERT TRENch actually did
burst out into several “additional”
lyrics. Excellent in themselves and
sympathetically delivered, they were
perhaps a little wasted upon the
intelligence of an audience whose eyes
were being feasted almost to the
bulging-point. By a happy device,
KING GEORGE was spared the gross
flattery which BEN Jonson lavished
on the King of his day, to whose
benign influence he ascribed the birth
of Spring; the diminutive figure of
Cupid, King of Love, was introduced
instead to receive credit as the prime
mover in these vernal developments.
At the close a great largesse of flowers
and herbage was flung to the front
rows; and for my share I received a
rose or two in the midst of a heavy
rain of moss and mould that did grave
injury to my personal appearance.
All ended well with a superbly stal-

The entry of great actors was ignored,
and applause, as is the habit on
such occasions, was very rare.
Yet the audience was appreciative
.in its own subdued way. Pos-
sibly The Critic lost most by the
change of air, for its fun depended
a good deal upon a recognition
of the incongruous situations in
which well-known actors found
themselves. Our foreign guests
could hardly be expected to know

commonly simulate a hoary

LIFE.
It was in the Saloon Bar of a more or
less reputable hostelry off Leicester
Square that he was thrust into my
ken. He was a smallish, perky-looking
individual, with an enormous mouth
and a chin blue from the eternal shaving
of what Nature had designed for a
strong beard. A flat-rimmed bowler
was crammed upon his head, and he
was perched upon a high stool, pulling
luxuriously at a tankard of bitter beer.
There was a latent twinkle in his eye,
and a grin lurking about the corners of
his mouth that piqued my curiosity,
and I wondered what on earth he could
find to look so cheerful about.
He seemed to welcome my cnquiring
gaze and remarked waggishly that it
would probably be a fine day if it didn't
rain. There was something in the way
he said it that made me think I must
have met him somewhere else, but
before I had time to remember properly
he laughed, and for the life of me !
couldn't help laughing too. Conversa-
tion flowed freely then, and soon he
leant over to me and said confidentially
in his quaint raucous voice:
“Sociable, that's wot I am. In the
pro'esh we 'ang together.”
“The profesh 2 " I said naïvely.
“Yes,” he said; “I’m a clown, yer
know, a pantomime clown.”
It took me by surprise. So that was
why I half-remembered him. And yet
—this cheerful soul who was drinking
and cracking jokes away from his native
footlights, a clown. If ever a smile hid
an aching heart it must be here, and I
hoped my accents were broken enough
as I murmured, “My poor fellow!” and
took his hand in mine.
My friend seemed mystified, and I
could see by the earnest way he looked
at me that he was trying to find out
whether I was being funny.
“’Ullo,” he said at length, “wot's
the game, eh?”
I looked again. Poor chap, I
thought, he keeps it up bravely. I
almost had to blink away a fear.
“You can trust me,” I said simply;
“how is she—the little girl?”
“The little wot?” he almost gasped.
“Your little daughter, the dancer,
you know—dying from pneumonia and
all that.” My voice broke at the edges.
“Daughter!”—his voice rose to an
indignant shout—“why, I never 'ad a
daughter, and never 1 -
“Then your wife, fading away with
consumption and tossing this very
minute upon a straw mattress 2 And

The clown set his mug down upon
the counter and descended from his stool

could not ſail to be impressed, and said:

Tooting. Upper Tooting may not be
Park Lane, but it is, I 'ope, respect-

I could not disbelieve the man.
For
a moment I gazed upon him sorrow-
fully. And then I said: " --
“It is rather quaint that the only
real live clown I have ever met should
be such a traitor to the traditions of
his calling. A clown who can laugh

And so I left him.

stamps?” asked my young friend
Bobby. He has been having a week's
holiday ia honour of the Coronation
and has been making a nuisance of
himself because he saw it and I didn't.
However, as I point out to him, I was
at least alive at the Diamond Jubilee.
“Do I–what ?”
“Know anything about stamps?”
“My dear Bobby,” I said, “I know
everything about everything.”
“Coo—I bet you don't. You don't
know what Tomlinson's average is
this term.”
“Ah, now you've just hit upon the
one thing——”
“Well, it's thirty-eight.”
“Batting or bowling?”
Bobby looked coldly at me.
“I was going to ask you about my
stamp,” he said; “but if you're going
to be funny—”
“I’m not, I promise. This isn't my
day for levity. Show me the stamp.”
I collected stamps when I was
Bobby's age. I suppose in those days
I did know something about them, but
they have altered since my time; with
the result that I can now only judge
them by the beauty or otherwise of the
illustration. Sometimes I come across
a letter stamped with the representa-
tion of a volcano or an iceberg or a
couple of jaguars—whatever it may be,
and I have gent it off eagerly to some
youthful philatelist; to receive a week
later such formal thanks as are generally
reserved for the man who offers you a
large Cabbage White for your butterfly
collection.
“It's just got a lion or something
on it, and a josser's head, and some
other things,” said Bobby, searching in
“Uncle Henry sent it to
me.”
The description seemed to apply to
a good many stamps.
“Any words?”
“Wait a sec.,” said Bobby, and he
ran it to ground in his right-hand
trouser pocket. “Here it is.”
It could claim to be unused, and
by so much the more valuable, but
another week or two in Bobby's pocket
might have invalidated its claim.
However I had no doubt that I had
never seen a stamp like it before.
“Who is the josser 2" said Bobby.
“It's nobody I know,” I said, look-
ing at it closely, “unless—no—it isn't
your Uncle William, is it?”
“It's got “postage revenue' on it,”
Bobby pointed out. “So it must be
Colonial, I should think, wouldn't
you?”
“Yes, that shows it couldn't be
“I believe it's Australian,” said
Bobby. “It's just the colour of some
of the Australian stamps.”
“Sometimes you can tell by the
gum. The gum from the Australian
gum-tree tastes quite different from
any other sort.”
Bobby tasted it carefully. “It's
just like ordinary gum,” he said, when
he had finished it.
We looked at it again, and then
Bobby went and got an atlas.
turned to the map whereon the i3ritish
possessions ale marked red. There
were an awful lot of them.
“You see, it might be any one of
these little islands,” I said. “After
all, we're pretty sure it isn't one of
the big colonies, because we've seen
photographs of the premiers in all the
illustrated papers, and this isn't really
like any of them.”

I'll do. I'm lunching to-morrow with

I'll ask him about yours. And I'll send
you a line.”

memories were a little vague for one
thing, and for another I was probably
wrong to have assumed that it went
into Bobby's pocket the same smudgy
colour as it came out. He was in-
terested, however, in the gum test, and
on my suggestion, made on the spur of
the moment, that it was a mid-Victorian
issue of one of the islands in the South
Pacific, he proposed that it should
be sent to him for examination. I
wrote to Bobby to this effect and went
into the post-office for a stamp.
“One?” said the lady.

She threw one at me. I picked it

quite suddenly that perhaps I was an

From a Highland Railway Company's

“Standing at the north-west corner ºf the
Castle, the view is one of surpassing, eharm.
Under the eye is St. Andrew's Cathedral, the
Bishop's Palace (Eden Court) and the Northern
Infirmary by the river side; and beyond, in the
same direction, the boat-shaped, isolated, oak-
clad eminence of Tomnahurich, now converted
into a cemetery, unsurpassed for adaptiveness
and for beauty and extent of outlook in all
directions. Immediately below Tomnahurich
is a large public park and a new cemetery, both
belonging to the Corporatiºn. At a distance of
a couple of miles is scen the District Lunatic
Asylum.”
Indeed, were it not for the absence of
any kind of Workhouse or Prison, the
view might claim to be the most beau-
tiful in Europe.

MUSICAL NOTES.
THE extraordinary circumstance of
M. PADEREwsKI passing unnoticed
through the crowd in Pall Mall during
the Coronation Festivities has aroused
widespread comment. We have re-
ceived an interesting communication
from the secretary of Mr. BAMBERGER,
the famous pianist, extending to forty-
eight folios of typewritten script, which
may be thus briefly summarised. Mr.
BAMBERGER, as is well known, is the
son-in-law of that distinguished official,
Sir PoxiPEY BoldERo, formerly Colonial
Secretary of the Solomon Islands, and,
on the occasion of the Coronation pro-
cession, had arranged to witness the
spectacle from a stand erected in front
of Sir PoMPEy's mansion in Piccadilly,
together with his wife, Mrs. BAMBERGER
(daughter of Sir PoMPEY BoldeRo),
and his three children, BEETHovex,
MENDELssohn and HUMPERDINck BAM-
BERGER (the grandchildren of Sir
|Pompey Boldeno).
+ + + +
Starting from his hotel at an early
hour, Mr. BAMBERGER and family made
their way to the nearest tube station,
but were recognised at the booking-
office and subjected to the most
gratifying, if somewhat embarrassing,
attentions. While in the lift en-
thusiastic admirers sought to pluck
capillary souvenirs from the exuberant
chevelure of the great virtuoso, and
during his subterranean transit he
signed his name in no fewer than thirty-
nine birthday books. Mrs. BAMBERGER
was repeatedly congratulated by fellow-
passengers on the extraordinary beauty
of her offspring, and sandwiches,
bananas, chocolates and other com-
estibles wele showered upon them in
lavish profusion.
+: º: + -:
Arriving at the house of his father-
in-law (Sir PoMPEY BoldeRo) at 7.30
A.M., Mr. BAMBERGER, his wife and
children, at once proceeded to take up
the seats allotted to them in the front
row of the superbly decorated stand.
This was the signal for an extraordinary
demonstration on the part of the
crowd, who shouted “ Bravo,” “En-
core,” “Bis,” and other honorific
exclamations for nearly twenty-five
minutes. Sir PoMPEY, who is a man
of strong family feeling, was visibly
affected, and in a brief but eloquent
speech expressed his acknowledgments
to the populace. In a manifesto sub-
sequently issued to the press, he stated
that if, as Mr. LLOYD GEORGE declared,
the people were Caesar, he at least was
their only Pompey.
-: -: + +
We regret to learn, however, that
the strain imposed upon Mr. BAM-
BERGER himself by this prolonged
exhibition of popularity combined
with the emotional tension caused in
his own highly-strung temperament
by the spectacle of the Procession, has
led to a peripheral nerve-storm, having
its seat in the capillary ganglia, which
has obliged him to cancel all engage-
ments for the next fortnight. Since
the awful experience he underwent at
the hands of the Terrorists of Tim-
buctoo, when he was kidnapped on
the banks of Lake Chad and carried
away on the back of a gorilla into the
Mountains of the Moon for six weeks,
Mr. BAMBERGER has been liable to
occasional recurrences of this distress-
ing malady. Sir PoxiPEY BoldERo-
who it can never be repeated too often,
is Mr. BAMBERGER's only father-in-law
—is unremitting in his attentions, and
Mrs. BAMBERGER is a devoted nurse.
Until complete convalescence sets in
Mr. BAMBERGER's children will remain
with their grand-aunt, Miss Cornelia
Bold ERo at her charming marine resi-
dence “Plinlimmon,” Mulberry Road,
Weston-super-Mare.

Mr. F.tz-Masters, the Chairman,
proved himself an ideal choice for that
onerous post. Not only did he preside
at every meeting of the general com-
mittee, but also at all the sub-committee
meetings, and it is due in no small
measure to his ability and tact that
the day was such a signal success.
Nothing could exceed the courtesy
and efficiency of Mr. Last, the hon.
sec. of the general committee, whose
tact and resourcefulness were unfailing.
All praise is due to Mr. Farr, who
assisted Mr. Last, and whose unruffled
temper and skill in organisation did
much to ensure the triumphs which
we have all witnessed.
The training of the voices of the
choir relects the highest credit on
Mr. Arthur Throstle, their indefatigab's
instructor. Rarely can sweeter music
have been discoursed than that which
rose obedient to his inspiring baton.
The organist, Mr. Soper, interpreted

edifice, must indubitably have moved

loud plaudits.
The catering, which was in the
capable hands of Host Bland, of the
Crown Hotel, was in every way
admirable, and ample justice was done
to the many good things provided.
The flowers which decorated the
banqueting-room were arranged by
Mr. Dedham, the head gardener at The
Court, and it would be impossible too
highly to praise the taste with which
his part of the labour of love was
executed.
Among the Squire's gifts were 5 lbs.
of tea (supplied by Messrs. Leadbetter),
Dairy Farm, Ltd.), and 60 loaves of
bread (supplied by Mr. John Bush).
Mrs. Gallop presented each of the
children with a Coronation medal with
her own hands, and the thanks of the
village cannot be too warmly accorded
to her for this act of kindness and
generosity.
Mrs. Lyon-Wagstaff, looking charm-
ing in mauve, kindly consented to
distribute the prizes, and it would
be difficult to exaggerate the cleverness |
feel that his award was beyond all the
others in value.
The arrangements for the tea were
in the efficient hands of Host Boker of
the Shipley Arms, and nothing was left
undone.
The decorations and illuminations
on Messrs. Putt and Roller's Brewery
reflect the highest credit on Mrs.
Aubrey Putt, who cannot be too much
complimented on the effectiveness and
originality of the colour scheme.
The bonfire, it should be noted,
would not have been half the grand
spectacle that it was had it not been
for the generosity of Mr. James
Stunt, who gave 500 faggots, and
the untiring and willing industry of
Messrs. Block and Bullivant, who
superintended the structure and them-
selves presented the tar and paraffin.
Nothing could exceed the punctu-
ality with which, at ten o'clock
precisely, Sir Henry Bower ignited
the train which led to the bonfire,
and caused the riotous flames to burst
forth in a blaze of loyalty.

party man, SEYMoUR KING was never
disposed to deny that occasionally some
good might come out of the Nazareth of
the benches opposite. Able, courteous,
unobtrusive, with far-reaching business
experience, he through a long Parlia-

general csteem. He was the kind of
man who forms the backbone of a
Parliament as yet unwaged.

TOUJOURS A LA RUSSE.
| CoronATION guests may come and
go, but the new Russian Ballet is here
to stay. It made its daring début at
Covent Garden on the very eve of the
Great Day, when all good loyalists
were warned to be in their beds be-
times, so as to rise at 3 o'clock and
wait ten hours in the places which
most of those who were not frightened
away by press and police could have
reached with ease at the last moment.
Russian dancers at the Palace
Theatre and elsewhere have made us
familiar with figures of eight or so, but
here with increased numbers there was
scope for greater intricacy of design.
Yet it was all done with the same
art, an admirable article in The Times
of June 24. There you will learn
what makes the difference between
English and Russian methods. I am
half afraid that in this matter of the
ballet we Britons never, never, never
will be Slavs. In Le Carnaval, and
in Prince Igor, the achievement of
individual dancers was merged in the
effect of the ensemble, but the piquan',
and wayward charm of Madame ELSA
WILL as Columbine remains clear in
my memory. And I was glad to
notice that she seemed to be enjoying
everything quite as much as I did.
Perhaps the most sensational moments
came in the famous war-dance from
BoroDIN's opera of Prince Igor. I
had never previously assisted at one
In this “tableau " Mme. KARSAVINA
came very near indeed to the perfection
of Madame PAvLova, but missed some-
thing of her effortless grace and the
lovely motions of her dainty head.
We have been told to admire the
severity of the background in Le
Carnaval. Let me say at once that
it is not comparable, as we are asked to
believe, with the scenery of Sumurun,
which was always beautiful when most
severe. I accept the simplicity of
the blue-purple hangings of the lower
wall; but I frankly revolt at the vast
beflowered frieze above it, which was
unreasonably gross in design and
coarse in execution. And surely this
ante-chamber of the ball-room might
have had a little more accommodation
apparently un-
| studied and spon-
taneous ease con-
cealing the art of it.
If Madame PAV-
Lova's dances —
the Butterfly, the
Swan, the Dying
Rose and even the
Bacchanale — are
the embodiment of
a single idea for
which the music
seems to serve as
a cursive commen-
tary, here, in Le
| Carnaval of ScHU-
MANN, the dance is
rather an interpre-
tatic n of the music
itself. And its fas-
cination lies in the
perfect accord of
the dancers not
only with the time,
but with the inten-
tion, of the music.

I ought perhaps
to add that, at the
* | second perfor-
mance, I did not
care very much for
the intervals be-
tween the ballets;
they lacked that
brevity which
should be the very
soul of this part of
the entertainment.

WHY CAN'T You Look
This, perhaps,
demanded more of technique than of
imagination, for the music was Carnival-
music, and the dancers had only to
assume the dress and manner of the
middle of the 19th cºntury in order
to become the very models from which
the fancy of SchuylANN had worked.
Greater imaginaticn was asked of the
Moscow dancers who were recently
interpreting the Peer Gynt suite; for,
apart from the Anitra Mazurka, the
music had first to be translated into
the terms of ano.her art.

shown in the use of those symbolic
and artifical gestures which worry me

MILTON BEFORE THE DIWORGE COMMISSION.
[Mrs. Miltos's flight from her husband during their honeymoon,
and the inspiring effect of that incident on the Poets views with regard
to Marriage and Divorce, are matters of history. By request of the
President (“Milton : . . England hath need of ther,” was the form
which his invitation took) the venerable Poet at considerable personal
inconvenience attended the 793rd sitting of the Commission (whose
Report f still awaited), and contributed the following testimony and
advice. -
Twice, Sirs, hath England called me in her need;
The former summons seemed an empty sound—
Mere murmuring of a pantheistic reed
In undrained corners of the Sonnet's ground.
But near my heart the present business lies;
And lest confusion on your counsels wait,
Or Truth go beggared from this blind assize
Of wrangling tongues, my views I here re-state.
Nay, Sirs, I will not sit. My Record stands;
And shall its Author meaner pose assume 2
But throw the casements wide—my voice demands
An ampler circuit than this frowsy room. -
My Record stands. Four tractates on Divorce,
On Wedlock proved a vain and tottering boon;
I wrote them, Sirs, with full Miltonic force
In the grey month miscalled my honeymoon.
And here, Sirs, I dispel the common bruit
Too long has vilified my stately name;
My wife (not I) first jarred the marriage-lute;
On her must fall the perdurable blame.
I paid her, Sirs, a presbyter's respect;
Rarely embraced her in the public street;
Sate where she sate, and when she strode erect
Pronounced approval of her sterling feet;
Incisive interest in her parents showed,
Her sepia drawings, womanly concerns;
And, exercising till my temper glowed,
Much wood I hewed and brimmed the water-urns.
A consort faithful, though in rule supreme;
My last infirmity, ambrosial food;
My first offence, to build the epic theme
And guide a lovelier Eve through solitude.
She thought me, Sirs, a little touched—yes, mad
And, so opining, turned elsewhere her charms;
On a green youth (with ample verdure clad)
Bestowed her lips, her strange, ambiguous arms.
But Truth hath open aspect, free report,
And plain response to every earnest call;
Challenged, its punctual thunders soon retort;
Woo'd, its benignant whispers breathe through all.
I marvel, Sirs, you miss its instant sign
And cloak transparency with scrannel art.
Let contest cease, and silence weigh this line—
“My soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart.”
Apart; as Stars, as husbands still mºst dwell
When wives and fellow-stars exhale from sight.
Marriage l—nay, render it dissoluble,
And grant Divorce full charter and free right.
But frame exceptions, Sirs. The common herd,
The verseless, vast, immeditative throng
(Who read Me not) are scarcely yet prepared
For th’ linkéd sweetness Life should then prolong—
Lost Paradise at moderate cost Regained;
Benevolent wives displacing the acerb;
Bliss multiplied; variety maintained;
And Love free-branching as a Latin verb.
THE WALKING TOUR.
“‘THE lowing herd,’” began Joseph. He and Herbert
were walking in a country lane and had just passed some
COWS.
“They weren't lowing,” said Herbert.
“Not a low was heard, not a funeral note,’” said Joseph.
“That's simply silly,” said Herbert. “You began by
saying the cows were lowing, and when I pointed out that
they weren't you just go and admit it; cave in like—like a
stupid old cockchafer. Why can't you stand up for your
opinions like a man and argue things out 2 ... I hate a chap
who chucks up the sponge as soon as he's touched.”
“I was only quoting,” said Joseph. * -
“There you go again,” laughed Herbert bitterly. “Quot-
ing ! Why, I'll bet anything you don't know where it
comes from.” -
“Where what comes from ?”
“Your blessed quotation.”
“There were two,” said Joseph.
“Well, let's take the first— the lowing herd' which
wasn't lowing. Who wrote that ?"
“KEATs,” said Joseph patiently.
“Never heard of him. Don't believe there ever was
such a person.” • . . . - -
“KEATs,” said Joseph, “is not Mrs. Harris.”
“Who said he was 2.” - -
“You implied it. But I suppose you'll tell me next you
never read Nicholas Nickleby.”
“I’ll tell it you now, and you can do what you like
about it.” -
“Well, well,” said Joseph, “we won't worry about
Nicholas Nickleby just at present. But I'm going to
tell you about KEATs.”
“You’re not.”
“Yes, I am.” -**
“Well, I shan't listen.”
“As you please. KEATs was a poet. He died young.
SHELLEY wrote an ode to him. No, stop—I think it was
BYRON. And the man who doesn't know about KEATs is
more or less of a barbarian.”
“Very well,” said Herbert, “I'm a barbarian—more,
mind you, not less, and I'm proud of it. But I know about
your infernal lowing herd. It's the one bit of poetry I do
know. “The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea.’ There!”
“‘Plods,’” said Joseph, “not ‘winds.’”
“No,” said Herbert firmly, “‘plods' comes in the next
line. “The ploughman swiftly plods his homeward way.”
Yah! Get out with you. You don't know your own silly
quotations. Besides, it wasn't KEATs who wrote that.”
“Who was it, then 2"
“It was a chap called Pope.”
“Ha, ha,” laughed Joseph. “Pope, indeed! I tell you
what it is : I didn't come on this walking tour in order to
have you thrusting your superior airs down my throat all
the time.”
“And I," said Joseph, “don’t mean to stick it any
longer, either. Twenty miles a day seem like fifty when a
fellow 's throwing mouldy old quotations at you from
morning to night—and throwing them all wrong, too. It
isn't good enough. Besides,” he added, “my heel's as sore
as it can be, and my throat's as dry as a lime-burner's

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Marriage of Barbara (CoNSTABLE) was one of those
| rather unfortunate and worrying little a 'fairs that seem to
have been no infrequent in the days of the historical
novel. Barbara was besieged with other royalists in a
castle, to which a spy of the Parliamentarians gained
access by her bedroom window. So when Barbara's uncle,
who had a nice sense of the proprieties, found this out he
| insisted that the spy should first marry her, and then be
shot. Which would have happened but for the fact that,
as soon as the ceremony was finished, a surprise attack
allowed Barbara's bridegroom to escape; with the result
that she finds herself for the rest of the book married to a
gentleman whom she hardly even knows by sight. This,
however, has happened so often in fiction that not all the
skill of Mr. FRANKFort Moore could give me anything
like astonishment when Barbara subsequently falls in love
with one IRodman, and when, torn between sentiment and
duty, she discovers at the critical moment that her husband
and lover are really—what there was obviously not the
remotest chance, in a book of this kind, of their not being
—the same person. True, the author endeavours to give
an unexpected turn to his plot in the final chapters by
introducing yet another character, exactly like Barbara's
husband suitor in appearance, who seems to have been
using this similarity for his own private ends. But the
only result was to plunge me into a state of mental
chaos as to which of the love-scenes had been with whom ;
and this hardly added to my enjoyment of the book,
though it naturally increased my sympathy with Barbara
when she had to sort them out at the end.
Let the critics, lamenting the decadence of everything,
remark dolefully, if they must, upon the lack nowadays of
literary genius; at any rate it must be admitted that there
is a consoling number of clever novelists left and that
Mr. MARMADUKE PICKTHALL is one of them. Pot au Feu
(MURRAY) is a collection of short stories, of which the first
three alone are negligible. These are, as it were, sighting
shots, and by the end of them the author has got his eye in
and hardly misses the bull again. His scenes are laid in three
countries. At home in England he is comfortably amusing:
in Switzerland he is very intelligent and naïvely delightful:
in the East he is at his best, and his is a very engaging
and humorous best. If you have seen Mr. OscaR Asch E in
Kismet and desire further exposition of that peculiarly easy,
almost lazy, humour of the Orient, you may find what you
are wanting in the last nine of Mr. PICKTHALL's stories,
which are grouped under the general and characteristic
heading of “In the Heat of the Sun.” At the beginning of
each of them it is impossible to foresee whether the climax
will be one of tragedy or sudden laughter; and life, after
all, is very much like that. The general impression left
behind is that it does not much matter in the East whether
the final event is happy or catastrophic, provided that
some amusement is to be got out of the affair while it is
happening. And if life, by any chance, is not like that in
the East then it ought to be.
In Mrs. Elmsley (CoNSTABLE) Mr. Hector Musho

crude enough, but his
shots out of them are
culty to the single instance of the mother-in-law, but there
are also in real life fathers and brothers, and particularly
sisters, to be considered. When the bridegroom is already
up against his family, who, being English and “County,” and
therefore, according to Miss MAUD DIVER, Philistines, have
no use for his artistic leanings and his philanderings with
sticky paints and mystical canvases, the difficulty is likely
to be very present and not to be minimized by the fact
that the bride is a Hindoo with a strong racial and family
pride of her own. In Lilamani : A Study in Possibilities
(HUTchINSON) there are so many forces opposed to the
marriage of Nevil Sinclair and his Jewel of Delight as to
make the practical onlooker question at the start whether
all the love in the world can make it worth while. But he
will content himself with the thought that, if they persist,
the trouble of it is for them, while for him is the pleasure
of studying the development of a remarkable situation in
which no point of view is omitted to be considered and from
which a very reasonable, probable and happy conclusion
is reached. He may get a little tired of the artists and
their art, and may wish that Miss Diver had not spoilt her
adequate style with so many affectations after the manner
of “understanded" for “understood.” Meanwhile, he is
effectiveness of an expert.
Whether readers of The School of Love (WERNER LAURIE)
will like it or not depends largely upon their feelings
towards the reformed rake, but I am convinced that my
only chance to take a degree in such a school as this of
Miss PRISCILLA CRAven's would be by means of an aegrotat.
I sympathise with Verity Marlowe, the little American girl
who married Sir Burford Rees, and never more keenly than
when “they galloped off in full cry after the hounds.” As
Sir Burford was an M.F.H. this little incident may possibly
have not passed without comment, but although he had
been seeking trouble for some forty years he did not really
find it until—on his wedding-day—he was cited as co-
respondent in a petition for divorce. Then Verity told
him that he had acted “like any beast of the field,” and he
was called upon to perform prodigies of self-control and
courage before he was forgiven. An aviating nobleman
(who was killed) and a suffragette (who was mobbed) have
been introduced to bring this sad old theme completely
up to date; but I refuse to accept Sir Burford as a fair
specimen of his class, and I am tantalised that the author
should waste her considerable talent upon such a profitless
subject.

THE BUTLER'S £5.
(A True Story.)
WE had been staying—the three of
us—for a fortnight in Ireland, fishing,
at Regan's. To-morrow was the last
day and we were driving over to
Rushtown to see the races when
Captain O'Driscoll overtook us in his
American buggy. - -
“Going to the races?” he asked as
he slowed down for a moment. “So 'm
I. See you there.” He clicked on,
and then, stopping again, turned round
to call out—“Don’t forget Blackadder
for the College Stakes. Dead cert.
Put your shirts on,” and was again
off. -
“All very well,” said Glenister
thoughtfully, “but where are our shirts?
Speaking personally, my shirt is a
return ticket to London and about
eighteen shillings, which I shall need.”
“Yes,” said Bradley. “And I'm no
better off, confound it!” -
“You forget,” said I, “that I have
a five-pound note in my pocket in-
tended as our joint tip to old Rice.
Lucky we decided to put it aside.”
“Yes,” said Glenister, “but that's
the butler's.” - -
“Not till to-morrow,” said I.
“No," said Bradley, “not till to-
morrow."
“But hang it all,” said Glenister,
“where are we if we put it on this
horse and the beggar loses? I know
these dead certs. It won't be Rice's
| to-morrow, then, will it? To my mind
it's his now, and we ought to respect
his ownership. It was to make sure
of his having it that we gave it to the
Goat to keep.” (I am the Goat.)
“Perfectly logical,” I said. “But
all the same here's a straight tip, and
it's a sin not to use it. One doesn't
often get them, and to start a whole
menagerie of sophistries in return is
the kind of ingratitude that providence
doesn't soon forgive.” --"
“Of course,” said Bradley. “The
Goat's right. And, after all, there's
no sense in being so infernally con-
scientious. A gamble's a gamble, and
old Rice would be almost as pleased
to hear that we had put his fiver on a
horse as to have it shoved into his
hand.” *
Glenister laughed. “I say no more,”
he said. “You do what you like with
Personally, I shall have
ten shillings on Blackadder to win,
although why qn, earth we all swallow
that soldier man's advice so unquestion-
| ingly I shall never understand.”
“If the Goat will lend me two
- pounds," said Bradley, “I will back
Blackadder for a pound both ways.”
“The Goat won't,” said I. “All that
the Goat proposes to do is to put the
butler's fiver on to win.”
This, later, I did, having found a
bookmaker who was giving 10 to 1;
and, true to Captain O'Driscoll's word,
Blackadder romped in an easy winner.
I collected the eleven rustling five-
pound notes and stowed them carefully
away inside my coat, and in the late
afternoon we drove back. Naturally
we had a good deal to say about the
racing, our fortunate meeting with
O'Driscoll, and so forth. And then
suddenly Glenister remarked, “I won-
der what the old boy will do with it?
Set up as a small tobacconist in Dublin,
do you think?"
“What old boy?” I asked.
“Why, Rice, of course.”
“You can't set up as a small
tobacconist on five pounds,” said
Bradley. “At least, if you did, you'd
be so small a tobacconist that your
customers would want a microscope.”
“Don’t be an idiot,” said Glenister.
“He'll have fifty-five pounds, won't
he 2 "
Bradley and I were silent. This was
a proposition that needed thought.
“I don't see why he should have
more than the fiver,” I said at last.
“It was all we were going to give him,
wasn't it 2 You will admit that ?”
“Certainly,” said Glenister. “It was
his, and you were keeping it for him,
weren't you?” -
“In a way I was,” I said.
“Oh law!” groaned Bradley. “What
a hair-splitter!”
“Very well, then,” said Glenister.
“You had Rice's five pounds and you
gambled with it—in itself a jolly un-
principled thing to do, as it wasn't
yours—poor devils are doing time all
over the place for much less—and now,
when your flutter turns up trumps, you
deny him—who might have been your
victim—the benefit ! I call it down-
right mean—squalid, in fact."
- “You make it sound all right,” I
said; “but there's a fallacy somewhere.
To begin with, as I said before, it isn't
the butler's own money till to-morrow.
He hadn't earned it till the end of our
visit. If it wasn't his it is ours, and
we might do as we liked with it. We
did, and the result is we have now
enough to divide up into £16 13s. 4d.
each, which I shall be pleased to give
you directly we get back, while Rice
has his fiver intact." .
“Not for me," said Glenister. “I
won five pounds with my own ten bob,
and that's all I make out of Black-
adder. I can't take your sixteen pounds
odd, because it wasn't made on my
money.”
“Oh lawl" groaned Bradley again.
“My dear Glenister, you're talking like
a Herbert Spencer sort of fellow.
Then the Goat and I will have to take
£25 each 2"
“No,” said Glenister, “you can't do
that; because a third, at any rate, of
the original fiver was mine, or, as I
hold, the butler's, and he must have
what that share made. You and the
Goat can take the sixteen pounds odd
each, but the butler must have the
third and the original fiver besides.
But I don't envy you your explana-
tion to him.” - -
“No,” I said after a while, “either
the butler must have all or none. I
can see that.” r . .
“Dash the whole stupid business' "
exclaimed Bradley. “Let him have it
all. We'll be generous.”
“It belongs to him,” said Glenister.
“There's no generosity in the matter.
There's nothing but justice or in-
justice.”
“Very well,” Bradley snapped out.
“I'm tired of it. Next time I go to a
race meeting I'll take care it's not
with a blooming Socrates.” ". . . .
“Then that's settled,” I said as cheer-
fully as I could. “Rice has the lot."
“The lot, said Glenister. "I'll admit
it's enough,but there's no other course.”
We rode the rest of the way in dis-
contented silence. . . . . .
Regan's gróðm met us at the stable
yard and took the mare's head. He
seemed to be unusually excited, and I
wondered if he had learned that he too
had backed a winner. . . . . .
“I'm afraid you'll find the house a
bit upset,” he said to Glenister. “But
the fact is there's been a little trouble
while you were away. The butler's
bolted. It seems he's been dishonest
for a long time, and to-day he thought
the game was up and ran.”
We looked at each other and then a
threefold sigh rent the air. -
Bradley suddenly began to roll with
laughter. - -
“I’ll trouble you,” said Glenister to
me, “for sixteen pounds, thirteen and
fourpence, and the third of a five-pound
note.” *
Heroic deeds of self-sacrifice are
being done every hour, unknown to the
great mass of the people. But an echo
occasionally reaches one's ears. For
instance, a catalogue tells of L ;
“French Model Christening Robes, trimmed
hand embroidery and real lace. Reduced re-
gardless of cost from 59/6 to 9% guineas." ; :
“A settlement of Mughs on the northern
coast of the Bay of Bengal find shark catching
profitable.”—commercial Intelligence.
On the other hand, in the City there is
a settlement of sharks which find mug-
catching profitable. - - - - -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“PoMANDER WALK.”
For the Londoner, jaded with the
rush and glare of a Coronation Season,
there is an almost cloistral benediction
in the atmosphere of Pomander Walk.
Here the noise of the Great World
(less noisy a hundred years ago)
penetrates only in faint echoes, as
when Madame Lachesnais returns from
“Pomander Walk—where is it ! Close at
hand,
Down Chiswick way—half-way to Fairy-
land.”—Extract from Prologue.
On the left is seen a dem-me fairy.
Sir Peter Autrobus ...
Lord '9tford ...
Mr. CY Rii, MAUDE.
Mr. Nolt MAN Forbes.
matching a skein of silk, or Jerome
Brooke-Hoskyn, Esquire, ex-butler, dis-
courses in heroic vein of his asso-
ciation with “H.R.H. the P. of W.”
and Mr. Richard BRINSLEY SHERIDAN,
with whom he has come into contact
in his unsuspected function of City
Toastmaster. A prettier and fresher
scene than this little secluded crescent
of Georgian cottages, bordering the
Thames at Chiswick, with their doors
and windows and garden gates all prac-
ticable, could scarce be imagined.
But, if “the play's the thing” º
the tastes of present-day audiences lead
one to doubt this), there is little enough
in Pomander Walk to set one thinking.
The plot is recognisable a mile away,
and the thinness of some of the fun is
confessed in the excessive use of oaths
and nautical expletives. I understand
that in the States, where it was taken
in a lighter key, this little idyll went
uproariously, but then any sort of
British antiquity goes well over there;
and, besides, they still harbour illusions
in that most sentimental of countries.
Still, for I hear that it went much
better on the second night at the
Playhouse, I shall believe that its
charming scene and its pleasant affecta-
tion of old-world airs and graces will
bring it popularity even here if it can
only hold the town till the arrival
of our country cousins.
Mr. CYRIL MAUDE was, of course,
in his native element as a retired
Admiral, and worked at top pressure
on the first night to make the fun go
round. Miss WINIFRED EMERY was
perhaps overmuch obsessed by her
painful memories of the past and might
well have assumed a gayer note if only
for the sake of her daughter's prospects.
Miss MARGERY MAUDE, who played
that daughter as to the manner born,
was very sweet and natural, though
her French accent was a little desultory.
And I think Mr. Louis PARKER erred
in allowing her to lapse into the poetry
of introspection. Speaking of her first
affair of the heart she is made to say
to her mother—
“I seemed suddenly to step out of childhood.”
No young girl that I have ever met,
“Standing with reluctant feet
Where the brook and river meet
Womanhood and childhood fleet,”
would have ever thought of expressing
her feelings with such precocious self-
analysis. Other characters, outside the
family, were well played by Mr.REGINALD
Owen, who was an excellent boy-lover,
with just the right amount (whether
natural or assumed) of angular
gaucherie ; by Miss MAIDIE HoFE,
who was quite funny as a designing
widow; and by Mr. FREDERick Wolpe,
a figure clean out of DICKENs, with his
pompous assumption of social import-
ance. It was greatly to the merit o'
the author that he refused the obvious
chance of exposing before the neigh-
bourhood the menial origin and
humble occupation of this impostor.
Mr. Norman For BEs, fresh from his
beauty sleep as one of the sentinels in
The Critic, played the never very
grateful part of a male match-maker
and took himself rather too seriously.
It was not easy for us to believe that
he had ever actually loved and ridden
away.
Little Miss Dixon recited a pleasant
prologue very charmingly, and then
retired into obscurity as Jane, maid-
of-all-work.
For the rest, there were several
interesting characters who were both
speechless and invisible. Such was
Sempromius, the cat, of whom I only
saw the effigy, before and after im-
mersion in the Thames. Such, too,
was Dr. Johnson, the speaking parrot,
who, as the well-coached mouthpiece
of her passion, contributed so much
toward bringing Miss Pennymint's lover
up to the scratch. Such, finally, was
Selina Brooke-Hoskyn, who, though
hampered by an accouchement, was still
of service (if we might judge from
some one-sided dialogue) as a querulous
critic of her husband's activities.
I must not conclude without a tribute
to the Union Jack that hung from a
flagstaff outside the Admiral's quarters.
Even when the stage draught failed,
this loyal emblem still flaunted in the
breeze, thanks to a wire attached
to its ſolds that lent it a fictitious air
of animation. I wish I could say that,
like Sempromius and the others, this
attachment was invisible, but I cannot
truthfully do so.

anything French in it except the usual
heavy catalogue of perplexing names
and the usual travesty of justice
familiar enough to the student of
Gallic methods on or off the stage.
As a rule in such plays there is at
least a French maid who is a passable
imitation of the real thing. But I
never saw anything less French than
the Denise of Miss AMY LAMBorn.
The clever mechanism of the Third
Act, by which the criminal was trapped
into self-exposure, appealed sharply to
the intelligence but left the heart ab-
solutely cold; for no one cared parti-
cularly about anybody's fate. Why
should one be closely interested in the
acquittal of an innocent man on whom
one has never set eyes, who happens
to be guiltless of the crime in question
but is in another connection quite
worth getting rid of 2
We should have done poorly indeed
without Mr. C. AUBREY SMITH, as
President of the Court (with a private
house conveniently attached to it). His
appearance always brings an atmo-
sphere of confidence. Mr. FRANCE
made an attractive criminal. His
sombre strength lay largely in the
things he didn't say. Mr. CHARLEs
MAUDE, though he always took off and
put on his cap at the right moment
according to military etiquette, never
quite persuaded me that he was a
soldier; nor was I ever thoroughly
harrowed by the embarrassments
of Miss ALExANDRACARLISLE as the wiſe
whose virtue only remained “above
suspicion” through an accident.
There was not much saving humour
in the play. Mr. LYALL Sweet E,
as a juryman, had to sustain what
there was of it; but his labours were
strangely ineffective.
I look forward with curiosity to the
next item in Mr. TRENCH's scheme
for the redemption of British Drama.

THE HOUSE WARMING.
I.—WoRK FoR ALL.
“WELL,” said Dahlia, “what do you
think of it 2"
I knocked the ashes out of my after-
breakfast pipe, arranged the cushions
of my deck chair, and let my eyes
wander lazily over the house and its
surroundings. After a year of hotels
and other people's houses, Dahlia and
Archie had come into their own.
“I've no complaints,” I said happily.
A vision of white-and-gold appeared
in the doorway and glided over the
lawn toward us—Myra with a jug.
“None at all,” said Simpson, sitting
up eagerly.
“But Thomas isn't quite satisfied
with one of the bathrooms, I'm afraid.
I heard him saying something in the
passage about it this morning when I
was inside.” -
“I asked if you'd gone to sleep in
the bath,” explained Thomas.
“I hadn't. It is practically impossi-
ble, Thomas, to go to sleep in a cold
bath.” -
“Except, perhaps, for a Civil Ser-
vant,” said Blair. -
... “Exactly. Of the practice in the
Admiralty Thomas can tell us later on.
For myself I was at the window looking
at the beautiful view.”
“Why can't you look at it from your
own window instead of keeping people
out of the bathroom?” grunted Thomas.
“Because the view from my room
is an entirely different one.”
“There is no stint in this house,”
Dahlia pointed out.
“No,” said Simpson, jumping up
excitedly.
Myra put the jug of cider down in
front of us.
“There !” she said. “Please count
it, and see that I haven't drunk any on
the way.”
“This is awfully nice of you, Myra.
And a complete surprise to all of us
except Simpson. Will you be out here
again to-morrow about this time?”
There was a long silence, broken only
by the extremely jolly sound of liquid
falling from a height.
Just as it was coming to an end
Archie appeared suddenly among us
and dropped on the grass by the side
of Dahlia. Simpson looked guiltily at
the empty jug, and then leant down
to his host.
“To-morrow !” he said in a stage
whisper. “About the same time.”
“I doubt it,” said Archie.
“I know it for a fact,” protested
Simpson.
“I'm afraid Myra and Samuel made
an assignation for this morning,” said
Dahlia.
“There's nothing in it, really,” said
Myra. “He’s only trifling with me.
He doesn't mean anything.”
Simpson buried his confused head in
his glass, and proceeded to change the
subject.
“We all like your house, Archie,”
he said. -
“We do,” I agreed, “and we think
it's very nice of you to ask us down to
open it.”
“It is rather,” said Archie.
“We are determined, therefore, to do
all we can to give the house a homey
appearance. I did what I could for
the bathroom this morning. I flatter
myself that the taint of newness has
now been dispelled.”
“I was sure it was you,” said Myra.
“How do you get the water right up
the walls 2 ”
“Easily. Further, Archie, if you
want any suggestions as to how to
improve the place our ideas are at your
disposal.”
“For instance,” said Thomas," where
do we play cricket?”
“By the way, you fellows,” an-
nounced Simpson, “I’ve given up
playing cricket.”
We all looked at him in consternation.
“Do you mean you've given up bowl-
ing 2 ” said Dahlia with wide-open eyes.
“Aren't you ever going to walk to the
wickets again 2 ” asked Blair.
“Aren't you ever going to walk back
to the pavilion again?” asked Archie.
“What will Montgomeryshire say?”
wondered Myra in tones of awe.
“May I have your belt and your
sand-shoes?” I begged.
“It's the cider,” said Thomas.
knew he was overdoing it.”
Simpson fixed his glasses firmly
on his nose and looked round at us
benignly.
“I've given it up for golf,” he
observed.
“Traitor,” said everyone.
“And the Triangular Tournament
next year,” added Myra.
“You could make a jolly little course
round here,” went on the infatuated
victim. “If you like, Archie, I'll——”
Archie stood up and made a speech.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said,
“at 11.30 to-morrow precisely I invite
you to the paddock beyond the kitchen
garden.”
“Myra and I have an appointment,”
put in Simpson hastily.
“A net will be erected,”
“I
Archie
went on, ignoring him, “and Mr. |
Simpson will take his stand therein,
while we all bowl at him—or, if any ||
prefer it, at the wicket—for , five
minutes. He will then bowl at us for
an hour, after which he will have
another hour's smart fielding practice.
If he is still alive and still talks about
golf, why then I won't say but what
he mightn't be allowed to plan out a
little course—or, at any rate, to do a
little preliminary weeding.”
“Good man,” said Simpson.
“And if anybody else thinks he has
given up cricket for ludo or croquet or
oranges and lemons, then he can devote
himself to planning out a little course
for that too—or anyhow to removing a
few plantains in preparation for it. In
fact, ladies and gentlemen, all I want is
for you to make yourselves as happy
and as useful as you can.”
“It's what you're here for,” said
Dahlia. A. A. M.
THE ART OF SOCIAL
ADVERTISEMENT.,
[Suggested by a recent announcement in the
“Court and Society” column of The Times.]
SIR PAUL BURNSMITH and Sir Peter
and Lady Wragge gave an evening
party on Friday at 141, Arlington
Street, which was wittily described on
the cards of invitation as a “Wragge-
time.” The description was apt, for
everything connected with the enter-
tainment was replete with Bohemian
jocosity. The studio had been con-
verted for the nonce into a café
chantant, where a troup of vivacious
Greek virtuosi from Greek. Street,
Soho, discoursed appropriate music,
while the area was charmingly
illuminated with moderator. lamps.
During the evening there was a mock
Russian ballet in which an exquisitely
ridiculous burlesque of the Muscovite
artists was given, Sir Paul Burnsmith
impersonating the Premier Buffoon with
extraordinary verve and agility. The
entertainment concluded with a dance,
in which all the guests took part, great
hilarity being evoked by an “Angel
Cake-walk,” in which the angels, “after
Sir Joshua REYNoLDs,” were imperson-
ated by Lady Wragge's three charming
daughters, Trixie, Topsy, and Turvey.
Among those present were the Cabinet
and the Opposition Front Bench;
Lady Betty Corker; Wiscount and
Wiscountess Cashley St. Vitus; Baron
Medulla; Lady Florence Owbridge;
Sir Hector and Lady Condy; Lady
Cara Cass; Mr. and Mrs. Eno Salter;

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extract Ed Frox 111E DIARY of Tony, M.P.)
House of Lords, Monday July 3.−
In an assembly somewhat enervated
by irresolution, where opposition is
hampered by tendency to let I dare
not wait upon I would, there is
something refreshingly breezy about
W.L.Lou GHBY DE BROKE. He is the
Minstrel Boy of the House of Lords.
To-night, as usual, he to the war is
gone; in the ranks of death you'll
find him. The ancestral sword fleshed
on Bosworth Field he has girded on,
and his wild harp (in the form of
absolutely hopeless amendment of Veto
Bill) he has slung behind him. Let
others frame Amendments, move them
with reckless audacity almost amount-
ing to bluster and run away when
time comes for division. DE BROKE
has no sympathy with such tactics.
Moved amendment stipulating that
no Bill twice rejected by the Peers
shall receive Royal assent until it has
been submitted to electors either at a
general election or by referendum.
“This, my Lords,” he proudly said,
“is a root amendment.”
“A ROOT AMENDMENT ..."

irresponsible truculency of WILLough BY DE
BRokE.
Artlessly put forward as a recom-
mendation, this phrase proved to be a
fatal offence.
“A root amendment l” exclaimed
LANSDown E with hands uplifted in
horror. “We have passed the Second
Reading of the Bill and cannot support
changes that may be fairly described
as going to its root.”
DE BROKE, most loyal of privates
in the Unionist army, incapable of
understanding nuances of that kind.
Not only insisted on taking division
but vowed that if Amendment were
rejected he would move to throw out
Bill on Third Reading.
“...] moi!” he cried, waving his
sword toward back benches of Opposi-
tion camp.
Time was (before Budget Bill of 1909
was thrown out). when the appeal
would have been answered by a couple
of hundred lusty backwoods-men.
A great deal has happened since then.
To-night only seventeen responded to
the battle-cry, the majority of ninety
being swelled by BROKE's own camp
friends and companions dear.
Business done.—Commons spent
sitting in discussing Second Reading
Naval Prize Bill, which proposes to
enact principle of Declaration of
London. Weighty debate followed on
Amendment by BUTchER, deferring
passing of Bill until question be reported
on by Commission of experts. Rumour
of dissension in Ministerial ranks lent
interest to division. In full House of
532 Members Amendment rejected by
majority of 70. Bill forthwith read
second time without division.

House of Commons, Thursday.—At
Question-time series of conundrums
put to CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER
with respect to Insurance Bill. Scene
watched from distinguished Strangers'
Gallery by swarthy visitor ſrom the
East, whose spotless white burnouse
was through the sultry afternoon
refreshing to the sight, a thing of
envy to the heart.
With assistance of copy of Orders of
the Day his Highness closely followed
process of cross-examination. Par-
ticularly struck by question addressed
by LocKER-LAMPson, who wanted to
know “whether any calculations have
been made to show that the reserve
values of spinsters on marriage will,
after accumulation during marriage,
suffice for the re-insurance at original
rates of widows who subsequently
become employed persons 2"
“Ha,” murmured the visitor, the
light of pleased recognition beaming
in his lustrous brown eyes. “Have often
heard of custom among this strange
people of selling their wives at Smif
Field, whither they conduct them with
a rope round their neck. Been denied;
but here is the principle proposed to
be embodied in Act of Parliament.
Spinsters evidently put up for sale in
marriage market with reserve values
privily fixed, as is custom in ordinary
auction-room. Accumulation during
| marriage probably refers to family
prospects. Not quite certain whether
the children are also to be sold, the
| proceeds added to reserve value of
their mothers whilst yet spinsters.
But it is clear that, by far-seeing
wisdom of Parliament, widows are to
be provided for by process of re-in-
surance, which, prejudice apart, is better
than Suttee. A little complicated per-
haps for a foreigner. But illuminative
as illustrating the minute, far-reaching
care of British Parliament for daily
needs in humblest domestic circles.”

WE understand that a suggestion
has been recently made that a Central
Bureau be established with a view to
providing likely titles to distracted
novelists. Not to be outdone in a
cause—the encouragement of literature
—which we have always made our own,
we beg to announce our intention of
going one better. It is not, we believe,
so much the lack of titles that has de-
prived the public of that great wealth
of unwritten novels which might even
now have been upon our bookstalls, as
the difficulty which the writer experi-
ences of getting under way—the icy
and forbidding aspect of the blank

Wiscount MoRLEY reflects on the question
whether a life-long adherence to the principle
of “Government of the People, for the People,
by the People” is compatible with a blank
refusal even to consider the proposal to consult
them at every important juncture.
For AN HISTORICAL Novel.
I am a plain, blunt man; and John
my name. " I have no trick of words.
For I am ever more at home, as you
shall see—else is my task ill done—
with halberd and with musketoon and ,
score of stout fellows at my back than
cramped and cabined at the toil of the
scrivener. But as it hath so happened
that false rumour is abroad and the
memory of my dear lord is like to
suffer for it, and none lemains but I
to tell the truth of this my tale, I needs
must make the best on 't. For I have
played my part, albeit but an humble
one, in great affairs; and yet plain
John am I, and blunt at that.
It fell out, then, on a fair June
morning that my lord rode forth
For A MID-VICTORIAN RomanCE.
That night in the cellars of the gentry
through bin and bottle froze the ruddy
wine; and on the humble doorstep of
the poor the morning's milk was solid
in the can. For such a frost struck at
the heart of this old England as even
old Bill Widdicombe, who has lived
below the Dell these fifty years, could
not call to mind the match of.
And the first I heard of it—
For A FEUILLETON.
Lady Martha Stanley curled herself
up on the sofa, impatiently flicking the
ash off her cigarette with the point
of her scarlet slipper.
“There is not a word of truth in it,”
she said coldly. “I didn't.”
The Wicomte Cordon do Val smiled
indulgently.
“Oh, yes, you did,” he observed.
“I tell you I didn't.”
“Yes, you did.”
“I never did."
“You did.”
“Didn't.”
“Did.”
There was a long pause. The room
resounded to the snap of his steel-grey
eyes as he gazed intently at her.
“And what if I did?” she said at last.
He had conquered.
For A Story, To BE ENTITLED “FROM
KAILYARD To CABINET."
The whaups (see Glossary) were call-
ing far and wide across the purple moor
as Davie reached the brig (bridge) at the
foot of the Lang Brae (long hill). There
he paused and cast a last, sad, hungry
look at the little clachan (see Glossary)
ſar above, where—well he knew—a
frail old woman in a doorway was
watching, through her tears, the fast-
retreating form of “her ain laddie.”
The whaups continued calling.
As he shook the drops from his
plaidie (shawl), Davie then and there,
in his own dour, stubborn way, regis-
tered a solemn vow that he would never
cross that brig ºg lin, upon his home-
ward journey, till he could do so as a
Cabinet Minister, in a private motor-
car. Far other were the thoughts of
his old mither (mother), who was trying
to calculate, with her native thrift, the
postage on his weekly washing. It is
the way of the world. And still the
whaups were calling. ..
The purpose of this tale is to show
how Davie kept his vow; but through
all the stirring scenes of his career he
will not be allowed—if we can help it—
to lose sight of the homely background
of the little clachan, the mither at the
wash-tub—and the calling of the
whaups.

THE TRIALS OF A WOMAN
OF GENIUS,
Tuesday.—Last night I finished my
novel, Beauty's Ensign. I remember
reading somewhere that GEORGE SAND,
if she finished a novel at 2 A.M., would
begin another before she went to bed.
I did not begin another novel, but I
wrote a sonnet to Selene. The first
line runs, “Eternal arbitress of Death
and Life.” I read it to Peter at
breakfast. He said, “Very fine and
large,” and in the same breath went
on to ask whether he mightn't have
some marmalade which didn't taste of
cocaine. Then he went off to the train
humming a deplorable tune—I think
from The Caramel Girl—and observing
“that men must work and housemaids
must sweep.” This form of humour (?)
is to me most repulsive—almost as
repulsive as the need of interviewing
the cook. From 10 to 11 I gave
Lilith her lesson in English. I find
that Peter habitually alludes to her
as “my unfortunate daughter.” When
I asked him why, he said, “Because
in deference to your wishes I allowed
her to be christened Lilith Sieglinde.
If she marries she will have to change
her surname, Brandon, which is a jolly
good name, and she will have to stick
to her Christian names, which are
Pagan and absurd.” Could anything
be more horribly borné than such a view!
Between 11 and 12.45 I wrote three
sonnets on the Young Turks. The
but the third was wonderful. I am
sending them to THoMAS HARDY for his
candid opinion.
Lunched off curried walnuts and a
violet omelette. In the afternoon
motored for two hours. Swift motion
always excites my poetic impulse, and
I improvised the greater part of a
short ode to Mr. LANCHESTER, to the tune
and metre of “Farewell, Manchester.”
Peter came home to dinner in a good
temper because he had “made a scoop,”
whatever that awful expression may
mean. I read him my sonnets, and he
said, “What's wrong with the Young
Turks is that they want to spend too
much money on Turkish Delight.”
Discouraged but persevering, I then
read him my ode. His comment,
“There's money in that,” is the
highest compliment he is capable of
paying. Sang Lilith to sleep with a
lullaby in the whole-tone scale. The
dear child seemed feverish. Dictated
to my secretary, Miss Pedder, from
10 till 12.
Wednesday.—Up with the lark and
dictated to my Secretary from 6 to 8.
Some lovely thoughts bubbled up in
my brain. But I am strangely per-
plexed whether the following stanza is
really my own, or whether I have read
it somewhere :—
“Nature asks not whence or how,
Nature cares not why ;
'Tis enough that Thou art Thou
And that I am I."
Alas! Peter struck a jarring note at
first was passable, the second moderate, breakfast, when he complained of the
bacon.
I observed that the remedy
was very simple, and, breaking into
verse, continued:—
“He who begins the day on flesh of swine
Is no true votary of the Muses Nine.”
On which Peter retorted with this
dreadful couplet:—
“She who abstains from the nutritious pig
Is certain to become a first-class prig.’
I gave Peter a glance before which
he visibly wilted and left the room.
Can there be a greater tragedy than
when a woman of genius links her life
to that of an ordinary man? This has
been a sad day. Peter, vulgar; Lilith,
wilful and almost deserving chastise-
ment for asserting that “putrid” was
a better word than “unlovely"; Miss
Pedder more than usually stupid.
Thus she spelled amaranth with two
“m’s.” But what can you expect
of a girl cruelly burdened with the
name of Amelia Pedder 2 I have
decided to call her Miss Peveril during
the rest of her engagement, and the
determination has already raised my
spirits.

“A HOME FROM HOME.”
THE Booking Clerk was losing his
temper—all the more quickly because
Algernon, on the safe side of the wire
grating, remained in an exasperating
state of calm. -
“I think I make myself clear,” said
Algernon. “You are advertising these
towns, not I. I want two tickets for
that place where a large red sun sets
immediately behind two tall black pine
trees. You must know where I mean.
Such a symmetrical landscape ' " .
The Booking Clerk was silent.
“Come now,” said Algernon. “I
won't be hard on you. If you can't
manage that, I don't mind going to
the place with the bright yellow sea
and blue fishing smacks.”
The Booking Clerk handed him two
tickets in desperation.
“Southsands-on-Sea,” read Algernon.
I didn't know the spot myself.
Algernon remembered he had been
there, though never before by the
Overland Route. On arrival I placed
myself entirely in his hands. He
showed me round the town with an
almost proprietary air. In a place
like this, he explained, it was possible,
while working on a most economical
plan, to have a holiday full of exciting
and novel experiences. For instance,
he said, here we should buy our dinner
ourselves direct from the manufacturer
to avoid the middleman's profit.
I called his attention to a “Family"
Butcher's.
“Rupert,” he said sorrowfully, “you
mean well, but you are unreflective.
This man is candid at the expense of
his commercial instincts. He avows
that he is a family man. Can we, in
whom he has no domestic interest, expect
to be treated as liberally by a man who
admittedly has to support a number
of little prospective butchers as by one
who hasn't a care upon him 2 Why,
every oddment of bone or alien piece of
fat he can weigh with his customer's
purchase means so much towards a
provision for his family. I don't blame
him, Rupert. Charity begins at home, of
course. Butlet us also remember that.”
I felt the weight of his words and
we passed on.
I lost Algernon later in the day, but
at nightfall we met again and he led
me with an air of mystery to a dingy
little hostelry which he had selected.
I arose early the next morning, but
Algernon was late for breakfast. He
came at last with a face full of
misgiving. I ate my lukewarm bacon
in resignation and silence and waited
for his confidences. At last he spoke.
“Rupert,” he said in an awed whisper,
“have you ever met a Cyclist 2"
I reflected a moment, then answered,
“Yes—when I was young.”
“What was he like, Rupert 2"
“Normal, average—when away from
his bicycle you wouldn't have known
him from the rest of his kind. -
“Extraordinary 1 Did he devote his
life to good works, self-denial and so
On 2 ''
“Never, in my experience of him.”
“Did he try to convert people to his
cult—his way of thinking 2" w
“Not to my knowledge.” -
“Anyhow, I'm glad I'm not a
cyclist. I haven't the right stuff
in me. Their hardships, their patient
endurance and all that appal me.”
I waited for enlightenment. It came.
“Rupert,” he breathed, “this—
this—is ‘Good Accommodation for
Cyclists." Oh, Rupert,” he said, his
eyes filling with tears, “do you think
a Cyclist ever meets accommodation
that he considers really bad?”
I took him by the hand and led him
out into the fresh air. He revived
presently and spoke again.
“I see it all,” he said, and pointed
to a board which I had failed to notice
the previous evening. I read the
legend, “A Home from Home.”
“‘A Home from Home,’” Algernon
went on. “Think of that. What
pathos' A home—yes—but strayed
far, we can never know how far, from
its abiding-place. And we in our
thoughtless ignorance have been abus-
ing it. This home has a past, perhaps
in Brixton or Bayswater. Can't you
think of its owner years ago saying to
his wife, ‘My love, the home is looking
a bit run down ; let us send it to some
health-resort and see what that will do
for it ’2 And they sent it here. It was
wrong, Rupert, very wrong. Possibly
they sinned in ignorance. This home,
I feel convinced, wanted a more bracing
atmosphere. Here it settled down and
became what it is. The chairs, miles
from their accustomed haunts, became
depressed and the very mattress on my
bed was thin and emaciated. You
could feel every bone in it, Rupert.
How was yours? There is one of life's
tragedies here. Think of the owner
visiting his home full of hope—and
seeing it as it is. He didn't persevere.
He deserted it cruelly and shamefully.
Things went from bad to worse—no
longer a home worthy of the name,
merely"—he cast about in his mind for
a suitable appellation—“merely a ‘Good
Accommodation for Cyclists.'”
Then I also understood, and for a
time we were too moved for speech.
Algernon broke the silence.
“I don't think I really care for
the bright yellow sea and the blue
fishing-smacks—in a place so full of
Sad associations,” he said. “I don't
think the strangest colours would move
me to enthusiasm after what I've
suffered.”
There was a pause.
“I should like to meet that Booking
Clerk again,” said Algernon thought.
fully.
“I believe he's ‘At Home' every
day from about 6 a.m. till midnight at
Liverpool Street Station,” I answered.
“Let us go and see,” said Algernon.
INLAND GOLF.
I HATE the dreadful hollow, in the
shade of the little wood,
Its lips in the grass above are
bearded with flame-gold whin;
I have tried to forget the past, to play
the shot as I should, -
But echo there, however I put it,
answers me, “In l’’
For there in that ghastly pit long
years ago I was found,
Playing the sad three-more, interring
the sphere where it fell;
Mangled and flattened and hacked and
dinted deep in the ground,
My ball had the look that is joy to
the loafer with balls to sell.
Down at the foot of the cliff, whose
shadow makes dusk of the dawn,
Maddened I stood and muttered,
making a friend of despair;
Then out I climbed while the wind
that had tricked me began to
fawn,
Politely removing the sand that had
made a mat of my hair.
Why do they prate of the blessings of
golf on an inland course
Where the “pretty” is but the plain,
the “rough,” prehensile hay,
That yields up the ball (if at all) to a
reckless tour de force,
And mocks with rippling mirth your
search in it day by day.
And the lost-ball madness flushes up in
the 12-man's head,
When the breeze brings down the
impatient, contemptuous “Fore!”
Till he gives it up at last and, dropping
another instead,
Envies those fortunate folk, the
dead, who need golf no more.

asperity in Penelope's voice which
betrayed her sensitiveness on the sub-
She is still some
Inonths short of twenty-one.
We went into the library, which had
been converted for the afternoon into
a kind of silversmith's show-room.
To me it is always rather a repellent
spectacle, this profuse and barbaric
display of gleaming spoil, representing,
as it were, the “takings” of the per-
formance. One seems to picture the
bride and bridegroom saying: “We’ve
not done so badly out of it, have we?"
l'enelope, however, appeared to be in
her element among the loaded tables,
for she examined each article, and the
curd attached thereto, with a laborious
thoroughness and a critical, calculating
expression, for all the world as if she
were a dealer called in to give an
estimate for the lot.
In front of her own present she came
to a rather obvious halt. It was a
silver inkpot, with a little clock inserted
in the underneath side of the lid.
I should never have guessed about the
little clock if she hadn't lifted the lid
to show me; and I noticed that when
she passed on she left it open.
“But won't they find it disturbing,”
I asked her, “when they're writing
an important letter to have the flight
of time continually thrown in their
| faces? It would put me off my game
entirely.”. . .
“This,” replied Penelope, pointing
dramatically, to the bauble, “is a
significant product of the Age of Bustle.
People are apt to spend far more time
than they can afford over useless
correspondence. It ought to do a lot
of good.” -
- “Truth,” I said in my best epigram-
matic vein, “resides at the bottom of a
well, Time at the top of an inkwell.”
Not discouraged by the reception of this
jeu d'esprit, I continued rhetorically.
“But where,” I said, “is this passion
for clocks to end? Are we always to be
admonished of the fleeting minutes?
Soon we shall be finding the hour
|ºring at us from the bottom of our
teacups' " -
“What did you give?”
I saw that it was useless to pursue
the subject further, so I indicated the
most imposing article on the table—
a huge silver lamp that made the rest
of the presents look insignificant.
Penelope was suspicious enough, how-
ever, to examine the card, which effect-
ually disposed of my pretensions.
Meekly I led her to a tiny sweet-dish.
“Very pretty,” she said, as her nose
assumed its most scornful angle.
“What's it for ?”
“Ostensibly,” I explained, “it’s a
coal-scuttle, but by pressing a secret
spring you can convert it into a spare-
bed. But it has no clock,” I added
cynically. !--- -
When I came upon Penelope again,
she was standing once more in front of
her inkpot, and once more lifting the
lid, which some unfeeling person had
closed down. A sombre individual in
a semi-white waistcoat was regarding
her with a carelessly watchful eye.
I drew her aside. , -
“Do you see that man over there?”
I whispered. “He’s a detective, and
he suspects you of designs on your own
inkpot.”
“Oh, how thrilling!” exclaimed
Penelope. “Do steal something, just
to liven him up a bit.” -
“Doesn't he play his part splendidly?
See how interested he appears to be in
the presents; and all the while he's
wondering whether you'll go quietly or
whether he'll have to call for assistance.
And he's got quite ordinary boots on.”
“Then how do you know he's a
detective?”
“I've been to five weddings in the
last fortnight, and he's appeared at
every one of them ; that's why his
waistcoat is only semi-white now.
We're quite old friends. He never stirs
away from the presents, and I've asked
him to keep a special eye on mine to-
day, because it would be so awkward
if anybody picked it up and accidentally
pressed the secret spring. A spare bed
would look a little out of place among
all these things.”
“Well, it's been a horridly dull
afternoon,” said Penelope, “and I do
think you might be a sportsman and
pinch something for me, if it's only an
ice or some of those little pink cakes.”
“But you've already had Oh
well, you may as well get something
for your money,” I murmured, as I
convoyed her back to the refreshments.
“But I should have been very ill
indeed if I'd tried to get my money's
worth during the last fortnight.”
“I doubt it,” said Penelope.

DEDUCTIONS ON THE LINKS.
To my mind nothing is more mentally
stimulating than playing golf with a
perfect stranger. From the somewhat
inconsequent dialogues which are
apt to occur on such occasions, one
has considerable opportunity for
making deductions as to the char-
acter and career of one's opponent.
Moreover, it is perfectly immaterial
whether the deductions so made are
correct or not. Only the other day
fate offered me facilities for exercising
my reasoning powers on the person of
an unknown gentleman with whom I
fixed up a match. The results are
appended. I should mention that the
said gentleman was of a corpulent
middle age.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.,
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
There is only one page of Flaws (HUTCHINSoN) to which
I find myself taking any objection, and that is the title-
page, because on this Miss JANE BARLow adds to the name
of her latest book the very inaccurate description “a novel.”
Whatever else Flaws may be—and it is many things at
once unusual and charming—a novel it certainly is not.
At first I thought that it was going to be one, when
Frances, the superfluous and neglected daughter of the
Lathams, having married to “disoblige” her family and
been very decidedly cast off, returned to her childhood's
home as a widow much richer than anyone in the neigh-
bourhood had any idea of. The situation thus created
appeared full of pleasant
would suggest, though the reader must be prepared for :
some technical matter by way of introduction. It is always
entertaining and often droll, and the occasional verses are
none the worse for being written (as I imagine) in the
duller moments of Assize. It is eminently sane and
corrective of the wild nonsense that is written about the
law, and many a reader will suffer the agonies of disillusion |
with regard to the reputed innocence of criminals or even
the romantic and heroic nature of their crimes. At the
least the public may herein appreciate the sportsmanship
of the Circuiteers, and, by way of recognition, will recover,
it is hoped, from its present state of depression and return
to the habit of litigation with something of its old vigour.
I could forgive or, at any rate, excuse Mr. Horace
NEwTE for unlawfully wounding and conspiring to subvert
promise, and I was more
than a little disappointed
when all this turned out
to be merely introductory
to the use which Frances,
deceased, ordered to be
made of the wealth she left
behind her. What was done
with it was to build a kind
of home, or rather collec-
tion of homes, called “The
Half-Square,” for reduced
gentility. It is out of this
foundation and the charac-
ters of its inmates that Miss
BARLow makes the chief
part of her book; and the
theme is one that suits her | #2

If ever there was an English institution determined to
survive the hostile attacks of its critics, that institution is
Circuit. Members of Parliament, private individuals, and
even the judges themselves, have tried from time to time to
kill it, but still it flourishes, if a little subdued, nevertheless
beloved of the Common Law Bar, marvelled at and possibly
envied by the Chancery Bar, and treated with respect by a
trustful public. That this last attitude is not more
intelligent is due only to the fact that the institution has
never attempted to justify or even explain itself to the lay
mind, and it has remained for “A Western Circuit Tramp”
(whose anonymity has not entirely defied the penetration
of the Profession) to reveal its raison d'étre, its practical
use, and, more especially, its social constitution and
humorous experiences. Pie Powder (MURRAY), being dust
from the Law Courts, is by no means as dry as its title
interior, and the conversation and manners of its inhabitants,
the author has shown himself clever enough, but the only
lesson I am able to draw in the end from what is apparently
a polemical novel is that East is East, and West West, and
that the two are incapable of meeting, except, I suppose, at

THE HOUSE WARMING.
II.-A GALA PERFORMAN E.
THE sun came into my room early
next morning and woke me up. it
was followed immediately by a large
blue-bottle which settled down to play
with me. We adopted the usual for-
mation, the blue-bottle keeping rºcstly
to the back of the court whilst I waited
at the net for a kill. After two sets
I decided to change my tactics. I
looked up at the ceiling and pretended
I wasn't playing. The blue - bottle
settled on my nose and walked up my
forehead. “Heavens !” I cried, clasp-
ing my hand suddenly to Iny brow,
“I've forgotten my tooth - brush ' "
This took it completely by surprise,
and I removed its corpse into the
candlestick.
Then Simpson came in with a golf
club in his hand.
“Great Scott,” he shouted, “you re
not still in bed ”’’
“I am not. This is telepathic sug-
gestion. You think I'm in bed; I
appear to be in bed; in reality there
is no bed here. Do go away—I
haven't had a wink of sleep yet."
“But, man, look at the lovely
morning !”
“Simpson,” I said sternly, rolling
up the sleeves of my pyjamas with
great deliberation, “I have had one
visitor already to-day. His corpse is
now in the candlestick. It is an omen,
Simpson.”
“I thought you'd like to come out-
side with me, and I'd show you my
swing.”
“Yes, yes, I shall like to see that,
but after breakfast, Simpson. I sup-
pose one of the gardeners put it up for
rou? You must show me your box
of soldiers and your tricycle horse, too.
But run away now, there's a good boy."
“My golf-swing, idiot.”
I sat up in bed and stared at him
in sheer amazement. For a long time
words wouldn't come to me. Simpson
backed nervously to the door.
“I saw the Coronation,” I said at
last, and I dropped back on my pillow
and went to sleep.

“I feel very important,” said Archie,
coming on to the lawn where Myra
and I were playing a quiet game of
bowls with the croquet balls. “I’ve
been paying the wages.”
“Archie and I do hate it so,” said
Dahlia. “I’m luckier, because I only
pay mine once a month.”
“It would be much nicer if they
did it for love,” said Archie, “and just
accepted a tie-pin occasionally. I
never know what to say when I hand
a man eighteen-and-six."
“Here's eighteen-and-six,” I sug-
gested, “and don't bite the half-
sovereign, because it may be bad.”
“You should shake his hand,” said
Myra, “and say, ‘Thank you very much
for the azaleas.’”
“Or you might wrap the money up
in paper and leave it for him in one
of the beds.”
“And then you'd know whether he
had made it properly.”
“Well, you're all very helpful,” said
Archie. “Thank you extremely. Where
are the others? It's a pity that they
should be left out of this.”
“Simpson disappeared after break-
fast with his golf clubs. He is in high
dudgeon—which is the surname of a
small fish—because no one wanted to
see his swing.” * -->
“Oh, but I do,” said Dahlia eagerly.
“Where is he ”'' :
“We will track him down,” an-
nounced Archie. “I will go to the
stables, unchain the truffle - hounds,
and show them one of his reversible
cuffs.”
We found Simpson in the pig-sty. I
regret to say it—in the pig-sty. The
third hole, as he was planning it out
for Archie, necessitated the carrying of
the farm buildings, which he described
as a natural hazard. Unfortunately,
his ball had fallen into a casual pig-
sty. It had not yet been decided
whether the ball could be picked out
without penalty—the more pressing
need being to find the blessed thing.
So Simpson was in the pig - sty,
searching. -
“If you're looking for the old sow,”
I said, “there she is, just behind you.”
“What's the local rule about loose
pigs blown on to the course 2" asked
Archie. -
“Oh, you fellows, there you are,”
said Simpson rapidly. “I’m getting
on first-rate. This is the third hole,
Archie. It will be rather good, I
think; the green is just the other
side of the pond. I can make a very
sporting little course.”
“We’ve come to see your swing,
Samuel,” said Myra. “Can you do it
in there, or is it too crowded ?”
“I’ll come out. This ball's lost,
I'm afraid.”
“One of the little pigs will eat it,”
complained Archie, “and we shall have
india-rubber crackling.”
Simpson came out and proceeded to
give his display. Fortunately the
weather kept fine, the conditions indeed
being all that could be desired. The
sun shone brightly, and there was a
slight breeze from the south which
tempered the heat and in no way
militated against the general enjoyment.
The performance was divided into two
parts. The first part consisted of
Mr. Simpson's swing without the ball,
the second part being devoted to Mr.
Simpson's swing with the ball.
“This is my swing,” said Simpson.
He settled himself ostentatiously into
his stance and placed his club - head
stiffly on the ground three feet away
from him.
“Middle,” said Archie.
Simpson frowned and began to
waggle his club. He waggled it care-
fully a dozen times.
“It's a very nice swing,” said Myra
at the end of the ninth movement,
“but isn't it rather short?”
Simpson said nothing, but drew his
club slowly and jerkily back, twisting
his body and keeping his eye fixed on
an imaginary ball until the back of his
neck hid it from sight.
“You can see it better round this
side now,” suggested Archie.
“He'll split if he goes on,” said
Thomas anxiously.
“He's going to pick something up
with his teeth in a moment,” I warned
Myra.
Then Simpson let himself go, finish-
ing up in a very creditable knot
indecd.
“That's quite good,” said Dahlia.
“Does it do as well when there's a
ball 2’’
“Well, I miss it sometimes, of
course.”
“We all do that,” said Thomas.
Thus encouraged, Simpson put down
a ball and began to address it. It was
apparent at once that the last address
had been only his telegraphic one; this
was the genuine affair. After what
seemed to be four or five minutes there
was a general feeling that some apology
was necessary. Simpson recognised
this himself.
“I’m a little nervous,” he said.
“Not so nervous as the pigs are,”
said Archie.
Simpson finished his address and got
on to his swing. He swung. He hit
the ball. The ball, which seemed to
have too much left-hand side on it,
whizzed off and disappeared into the
pond. It sank . . . .
Luckily the weather had held up
till the last.
“Well, well,” said Archie, “it’s time
for lunch. We have had a riotous
morning. Let's all take it easy this
aſternoon.” A. A. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE GIRL, WHO CouldN'T LIE.”
SHE was not born that way. It
came upon her quite abruptly after
reading a passage of WoRDsworth over-
night. The seer of Rydal cannot
however be held responsible for the
interpretation which she put upon his
sentiments. Her sudden
inability to tell lies — in
itself a meritorious defect
if strictly confined to
negative application—was
extended to include features
undreamed of in the philo-
sophy of the Lake District.
Not content with avoiding
falsehood, this miserable
girl must go out of her way
to tell, to their faces, the
uninvited truth about her
own family, and even
wantonly report, to one of
her mother's guests, the
gossip about her which she
has overheard from the lips
of other guests. This, I
take it, was no part of the
WoRDsworth scheme. Of
Mr. KEBLE HowARD's own
intentions I can speak with
less certainty. If his ob-
ject was to expose the
insincerity of our social life (not
a very fresh theme), then the girl
should not have failed, as she does fail
in the end, and with bitter humilia-
, tion. If, on the other hand, he wanted
to show that the naked truth is often
an unworkable indecency, he was only
telling us what we knew already from
The Palace of Truth, even if it had not
occurred to our unaided intelligence.
The fact is, Mr. HowARD does not
seem to have taken the feelings of his
audience into consideration at all. He
treated us as if we could have em-
ployed the same remedies which were
available for readers of the novel (by
himself) on which his play was founded.
But, if a book bores you, you can skip,
or you can throw it aside. With a
play you are at the author's mercy.
Anyhow, I could not bring myself, on
the third night, to be uncivil enough
to walk out. In so sparse an audience,
where every occupant of the stalls
was a marked man (or woman), my
withdrawal must have been the object
of general notice.
Mr. HowARD's novel (which I have
not had the pleasure of reading) may
have exhibited that familiarity with a
middle-class atmosphere upon which
his reputation has been built. But
whatever realism the play con-
tained was badly damaged by the
heroine's improbability and also by the

Mr. GwenN introduced a touch of his
own full-blooded humour.
The attractions offered by the
Criterion Theatre are curiously unequal,
and this, I am afraid, is one of its
bad patches. It may even have
been supplanted by the time this
rather superfluous criticism gets into
print.
“ARIADNE IN NAxos.”
In those works of classical
mythology which, in the
opinion of all good peda-
gogues, afford the soundest

British schoolboy's prehen-

given to understand that
Theseus, growing weary of
his Ariadne, left her ma-
rooned on Naxos ; and that
Dionysus, chancing to drift
that way, made her the
object of his wandering
fancy and undertook to
console her irregular
widowhood. Mr. MAURICE
HEwleTT has embroidered
this legend. In his view,
Dionysus, finding Theseus
in the way, got him out of it
by inspiring him with such
a passion for military am-
bition that he took the
first boat for Athens, so as to get
to work at once, Naxos being rather
insular and affording inadequate
scope for martial valour. But these
were surely not the methods of
the real Dionysus. The frenzy he
inspired was a sudden unreasoning
frenzy, which made for immediate
hooliganism and not for an heroic
career. I doubt, too, whether, in his
desire to illustrate the loneliness and
futility of godhead—how it could
compel the bodies of mortal women,
but never their hearts—Mr. HEwleTT
was very happy in his selection of
so animal a type as this god of
the wine - vat. His spiritualizing
processes would have been better
applied to some other Olympian—
Hermes, say, for choice. He seemed
almost to ignore the bibulous tem-
perament of Dionysus. The Russian
Bacchanale, though possibly less Greek
in its motive than the dance of Mr.
HEWLETT's chorus, did at least show
us the symbol of Bacchus in the
vine-grapes. But here the ecstasy of
the Cretan maidens (hardly perhaps the
best subjects for his inspiration, seeing
that they were not of the hysteric class
of which maenads are made, but the
virginal, if rather sentimental, com-
panions of Ariadne, votary of the chaste
Artemis) was not created by the fumes
! of wine, but by a sort of amorous

exhalation in which no alcoholic ele-
ment was apparent.
There was strangeness, too, in cer-
tain signs of Biblical influence, shown
both in the phraseology—“O perjured,
that could not watch one hour!” “I have
no crown, but reproach for garment"—
and also in the un-Greek recognition of
moral sin and the need of repentance.
However, all this is mere criticism of
the book. The putting on of the play
at the Little Theatre was an extremely
interesting experiment, though for more
than one reason it is not likely to find
its way into the bill of any house,
little or large. Among the men, per-
haps the finest single performance in
declamation was Mr. BUNston's narra-
tive of the fate of AEgeus. Mr. GoDFREY
TEARLE was unrecognisable as the Greek
Dionysus, but he was Mr. HEwlFTT's,
and his closing speech upon the limita-
tions of the gods was given with great
sense of beauty. Miss GRACE LANE,
though a little noisy at times, was a
sensitive Ariadne, and conveyed very
perfectly, both in attitude and facial
expression, her alternating absorption
in the two loves, sacred and profane.
Theseus, in the hands of Mr. CLAUDE
KING (and not Lord HowARD DE
WALDEN, as I thought at one time),
was the least satisfactory, until he
warmed to his work. Finally, the
movements of the Chorus in their
Parabasis were taken straight off
Greek vases.
The only real failure was in the
suggestion of rhythmic cadence.
Everybody seemed content to make
the author's meaning intelligible and
leave the music of his verse to take care
of itself. It was pardonable that some
of his rather cryptic measures should
reach us in the shape of poetic prose,
but there was no excuse for ignoring
the beat of the anapaest. Our modern
elocutionists have still to learn that
there may be rhythmic design even in
blank verse (Mr. HEwlETT, by the way,
seems to prefer the iambic dimeter),
and that its division into lines of a
certain length is not a mere arbitrary
arrangement for permitting us to dis-
tinguish between prose and poetry; and
meanwhile there seems little hope for
their rendering of the lovelier and more
intricate measures of the Greeks. Their
failure in this matter was the one
disappointment in a very attractive
performance, in regard to which I will
be Greek enough not to play the part
of Mrs. Grundy and raise any questi n
of the proprieties. O. S.

DEAR MADAM, We beg to acknow-

of the 13th inst., enclosing type-written
manuscript of your novel, entitled
Beauty's Ensign, on which you wish
us to express a “candid opinion.” This,
we may inform you, is a request that
in the whole course of the history of
our firm has never been made to us
yet, but in view of the long and
generous patronage we have enjoyed
for so many years from your husband
and his family we have decided to
accede to it with the best of our ability,
and accordingly entrusted the MS. to
our Mr. Jellicoe, who is a gentleman
of pronounced literary tastes and a
great reader. We enclose herewith
Mr. Jellicoe's report, which we trust
will meet with your satisfaction; and
awaiting your further esteemed orders
we are, Yours obediently,

“Whether we consider the length of
this novel or the breadth of its charac-
terisation, it must be pronounced a
remarkably piquant and lovely produc-
tion. In the voluptuousness of its
imagery it reminds one more of Miss
MARIE CoreLLI than any other writer
with whom I am acquainted, and the
language of the characters is extremely
recherch3. It must be admitted, how-
ever, that readers who are partial to
happy endings will be pained by the
distressing events of the last chapter,
and I would humbly venture to suggest
whether the conclusion could not be
revised so as to reunite Lord Peto and
Blandine. A special feature of the
book are the all too brief gems of poetry
with which the narrative is so richly
interlarded. These strike me as being
of remarkable if not unique ability.
HERBERT JELLICoE.”
Why should Mr.Thomas HARDY write
in the first person plural, as if he were
a king, and speak of his firm; and what
on earth does he mean by the patronage
he has enjoyed from Peter and Peter's
family? And why, oh why should he
hand over the MS. of my novel to
“our Mr. Jellicoe" and send me Mr.
Jellicoe's extraordinary report, compar-
ing me to MARIE CoRELLI? Unluckily,
as I had a headache this morning and
did not come down to breakfast, I shall
have to wait till the evening for such
light as Peter can throw on the situa-
tion. The more I think of it the more
puzzled I become. And in this racking
suspense I have to order dinner and
give Lilith her lesson. The child lends
herself remarkably to decorative treat-
ment, but I fear there is an ineradicable
vein of banality in her nature. When
I asked her the other day what she
liked most in the world she replied,
without a moment's hesitation, “Bacon
juice,” a remark worthy of Peter at his
worst. Her great ambition is to be a
circus rider, and she picks up all the
worst tunes with astonishing ease.
However, much may be done by en-
vironment and persuasion. Still, I
admit that an unfaltering observance
of the golden rule of Mrs. Goole,
“Never correct, contradict or chastise
a child,” is at times difficult. Peter
holds quite different views and, when
I repeated this to him, said, “You’ll
change your mind some day. The
golden rule of Peter Brandon is much
better:
“To cure a naughty little nipper
Correct him freely with a slipper."
However, I am bound to say he has
never attempted to carry out this cruel
precept at Lilith's expense, though
there are moments when I almost
wish—— *.
In the afternoon I dictated aphorisms
to Miss Peveril as an antidote to
my impatience. One struck me as
peculiarily happy : “The possession
of a conscience is the worst infirmity
of genius.” -
It is years since I so longed to see
Peter as I did this afternoon. As soon
as he had arrived I showed him the
letter and demanded an explanation.
I recalled the circumstances; how I
had asked him if he knew Mr. Thomas
HARDy's address and how he said, “Of
course I do,” and undertook to fill it in
and post the letter and package to him.
Imagine my disgust when, instead of
giving me a sensible answer, he went
into fits of horrid, loud, snorting
laughter. At last, when he had re-
covered himself sufficiently, he said in
a faint voice: “Thomas Hardy is my
saddler. I had just been sending him
an order myself, and you never told me
what you wanted to write to him about,
or of course I should have never sent
off the letter. But anyhow, the old
man and “our Mr. Jellicoe' have played
up splendidly. You'll never get a
better report from the real Simon
Pure.”
“The Prime Minister has appointed Mr.
Maurice Bonham Carter to be his Private

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtractED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, July 10.
—Reorganisation of Unionist Party
been watched with keen interest from
both political camps. One result has
been to place STEEL-MAITLAND in
charge of electoral affairs outside House.
Expected of him that he shall rival
the triumphs of CARNOT, Organiser of
Victory in stormy days of French Revo-
lution. Assurance on this head clinched
by little incident in to-day's proceed-
ings. What our young CARNOT (from
Birmingham) has to face is the incon-
siderate stability of Ministerial major-
ity. Whilst—certainly as long as Veto
Bill tarries on its way to the Statute-
book—its phalanx remains unbroken
in Commons, by-elections, whether in
borough or county, fail to reduce it.
This the more provoking as in accord-
ance with regular custom a sweeping
majority gained at a general election is
invariably forthwith subjected to pro-
cess of frittering away at by-elections.
Recognising this difficulty, our CAR-
Not in a flash of genius saw way of, at
least apparently, redressing the balance.
Though plural voting is for the nonce
permitted at Parliamentary elections it
is not possible to return two Members
to represent a one-man constituency.
But there is no rule against bringing
in as a member of the minority a man
who, alike in height and weight, shall
be equal to any couple (bar one) on
Ministerial side. A student of parlia-
mentary history, CARNOT remembers
how to House elected in 1874 came
MAJoR O'GoFMAN, a man of elephantine
girth and pyramidal height, who,
whilst holding only one seat in Ireland,
occupied two below the Gangway in
the House of Commons. As hapless
Members on either side of him dis-
covered, howsoever crowded the bench
might be, the MAJOR always had his
way. When he sat down he cleared
space for two.
This House of Commons legend may
have given CARNOT a tip. On the
contrary the brilliant idea may have
been entirely his own. However it be
the result surpassed expectation. A
vacancy occurring in the St. Augustine's
division, owing to AKERs-Douglas going
to the Lords to keep up ACLAND-Hood's
drooping spirits, CARNOT searched
Home Counties for their biggest man
to stand as candidate for a safe seat.
Found him in RoNALD McNEILL.
Profound sensation when new Mem-
ber, escorted by WALTER LoNG and Lord
BALCARREs, walked up floor of House
to take the oath. There was in this
emotion something akin to the keen
delight a small boy feels on casually

encountering a giant crossing the vill-
age green, and being permitted to gaze
upon him without preliminary payment
of a penny at gateway of the show.
Avoiding unnecessary tendency to con-
tradiction, one may say that WALTER
LoNG is not short. The still svelt
figure of BALCARREs rises to the full
height of average man. Nevertheless,
as they walked up the floor on either
side of the new Member they re-
called memories of Gulliver in Lilli-
put standing between His Majesty
the Emperor and the Lord High
Treasurer, watching the military man-
oeuvres outside the imperial capital.
The couple barred in an earlier
sentence are, of course, the Bounding
Brothers of Clackmannan and Orkney
—EUGENE and CATHCART WASON. It
is remarkable testimony to their con-
sideration of others less favoured by
generous nature that when they first
entered the House they arranged to
sit on opposite sides, CATHCART as
a Liberal Unionist, EUGENE a Glad-
stonian Liberal. After cautiously
making experiments and finding that
their united weight disposed on one
side of the Chamber did not affect its
stability, CATHCART crossed over and
permanently ranged himself-under the
Liberal flag. In view of possible con-
sequences to a structure however firmly
fashioned, they never occupy the same
bench at the same time.
This afternoon, at the moment when
the new Kentish Member slowly but
surely, like a P. and O. liner in process
of docking, surged towards the table,
the Brethren were discovered seated
one below the other at corner seats
above the Gangway. No word
passed between them. But it was
pretty to see CATHCART turn round
and gaze sadly in his brother's face, an
eloquent glance responded to by a
sickly smile.
So, as SARK puts it, does a prima
donna of yesteryear look on from her
box when a débutante of unquestion-
able supremacy steps on to the stage.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. W. L. CourTNEY is a writer of such varied activities
that I have long ceased to be astonished at his appearance
in any new aspect. His latest mood is that of the analyst
of sentiment, and the book which it has produced is called
In Search of Egeria (CHAPMAN AND HALL), to which the
author adds as a sub-title, Episodes in the Life of Maurice
Westerton. This explains the nature of the work in a few
words better than I could do it for you in many. Maurice
—whom his creator calls “a baffled and disconsolate Numa
in perpetual search for his Egeria”—is really something of
Terai chased by a wild elephant,” “The Prince's ele-
phant charged by a tiger,” and so on through every.
chapter. It is a record that the most sporting and daring
Englishman would be proud to equal. In 1896, when
Persimmon won the Derby, the St. Leger, and the Jockey
Club Stakes at Newmarket, and Thaïs the One hºusanā:
Guineas, the stakes earned by his horses totalled over:
£26,000; and in 1900, when Diamond Jubilee carried off:
the Two Thousand Guineas, the Newmarket Stakes, the
Derby, the Eclipse Stakes and the St. Leger, about Hº
£5,000 more—two very pretty dishes to set before a king;;
yet he was not of the kind to sit in his counting-house
counting out his money. It was the sport that he cared;
for, and, though uneasy lies the head that owns a possible;
an English Anatol, an emo-
tional philanderer. The book §|
is a record of the various |
heart-adventures into which
his temperament leads the |
hero, this same temperament
being itself very skilfully ex-
posed for the reader in the
process. The episodes are
not short stories, any more
than the whole book is a
novel in the accepted sense
of the term ; slight sketches,
rather, of Maurice in his
relations with his different
loves, done in a manner
which is really far more
attractive than the matter of
which they treat. A heavy-
handed chronicler would cer-
tainly have made Maurice
an unmitigated bore; it is
no small tribute to the art
of Mr. CourTNEY that one
can follow the gentleman
from fair to fair, the opera-
singer, the rector's daughter,
the poetess and the rest of
them, with undiminished
enjoyment. Finally, with a
touch almost of malice, the
author shows us Maurice,
that epicure of emotions,

think of nothing that is not good to say. It is a fine record
of a fine series of achievements on moor and forest, on the
sea, in the covert, in the jungle, and on the turf. Hardy,
brave, unselfish, keen to excel and win, but generous-minded
and philosophic in defeat, KING GEORGE's father had all the
qualities of temperament without which the skill of hand
and eye, which were also his, are of little account.
If you have forgotten how completely he made himself
one with the favourite national pursuits of his people,
glance at the titles under the hundred-and-one plates
and photographs in Mr. A. E. T. WATson's welcome book
—“Persimmon winning the Derby,” “Ambush II. over
the last fence in the Grand National,” “Britannia
racing at Cowes,” “The Prince of Wales in the Nepal
—' New York. “‘Can you write,
shorthand?' they said. 'No,' said the boy in homespun,
‘ but I can try.’” And how Whangus McWhinus waited
for Shamus McShamus in the hollow of the Glen road and
shot him through the bagpipes. At its best the delightful
spontaneity of the humour of Mr. LEAcock (who is a'
Professor of Political Economy at McGill University) gives'
one the impression that he dashes off this sort of thing
in a moment of exuberance between his lectures. This
impression is increased by the obvious fact that the author
is not very critical of himself. There is genuine gold here
on every page, but I do not feel quite sure that Mr.
LEAcock knows when he has come to it. But genius has
suffered from this weakness before now. There was the
case of Wordsworth, for example.
“Rosmead was perfectly happy... He loved this woman with a great
and growling love.”—People's Friend.
How many wives know this sort of love.

Punch, or THE London CHARuvAR1, July 19, 1911.
I 841 – 185 o.
R. PUNCH, as all the world knows, was born on
July 17, 1841. Like all clever babies he began to sit
up and take notice at once, and he has been taking
notice ever since, and now that his years number seventy
and find him still younger than ever, it amuses him to
celebrate his attainment of the allotted span of man (but
not of jesters) by reviewing his career as a noticer, particu-
larly of the modes, manners and social movements of his
long and merry life.
His foresight developed rapidly. In 1843, when he was
only a two-year-old, he had prevision enough to perceive
the flying machine of the next century. But that is not all.
Four years later, when he was an infant phenomenon of
six, we find him pourtraying a taxi-cab–the “Patent Mile
Index”—and reporting, or preporting, accurately a dialogue
destined to be a common occurrence of the streets in his 7oth
year. These are flashes of inspiration.
Among the purely historical records of his first decade
Mr. Punch shows us ladies in turbans and gentlemen
in strapped trousers; he shows us that affairs of honour
still came off in the suburbs of London just as they do to-day
under the Eiffel Tower; he marks the introduction of the
polka (in 1844) and illustrates the beginnings of the expan-
sion of woman's life in his suggestion for their participation
in farming and sport, and (in 1849) in tobacco, for it would
probably be hard to find an earlier cheroot between female
fingers than the one in Leech's drawing of that year.
Among the relics of the past now wholly gone but pre-
served in his signally anti-septic pages we find the Jack-in-
the-Green of the 1st of May, the old hood to the bathing-
machines, the high pews of the coffee-houses, and the high
hats of the cricketers at Lord's.
Lastly, let it be noted that Mr. Punch's illustrious knight,
Sir John Tenniel, still happily hale although twenty and
more years older than his master, made his first drawing
for the paper in the number dated November 30, 1850.

Punch, or THE London CHARIvarr, July 19, 1911.
1851 — 1860.
ITH 1851 we find all the world flocking to the Great
Exhibition, and the establishment of those cookery
schools which were to revolutionise the British chop
but have not too conspicuously done so. Gold, so recently
attracting all the adventurers to California, had now glit-
tered also in Australia, and a few bold ladies had gone into
a bifurcated garment called the Bloomer (after the American
innovator) just as, nearly sixty years later, their more
intrepid granddaughters were to go into the Harem
skirt—for not the least of the instructive lessons which Mr.
Punch's seventieth birthday number inculcates is this, that
there is nothing new under the sun and the rule of life is
rhythm. Crinolines, however, which were flourishing in the
fifties, have not yet returned, except on the stage.
In 1853 table-turning was imported from America and there
arose also a fashion for baby-shows. The middle years
were shadowed by the Crimean War, followed by the Indian
Mutiny, but the trivial life goes on side by side with the
tragic, and while the near and far East were under a cloud
London was cultivating the famous Dundreary whiskers,
named after a character in a play by one of Mr. Punch's
later editors, Tom Taylor. These have not since sprouted
again to embellish or conceal the male cheek, but the
moustache, which was beginning to be worn as rival to the
Dundreary adornment, is still in its reign.
Contemporary with the moustache movement was the
birth of a controversy that still has power to divide friends—
the great Shakspeare and Bacon problem, and in 1860 the
world was as much interested in the fight between Sayers
and Heenan as last year in that between Johnson and
Jeffries. For nothing essential alters: the drama is the
same; merely the actors drop away and are replaced by
others.
In this decade came two more giants to Mr. Punch's side :
Charles Keene in 1851 and George Du Maurier in 1860.

Puxch, or The Loxbox Chakrvarr, July 19, 10tt.
ºlº N 1861 we find that gallant fellow the Volunteer,
º 3. always a butt of the wits but bravely disregarding
- their playfulness, in full force; Blondin at the
Crystal Palace, and Paul Du Chaillu's gorilla leading to a
thousand jokes. Paul Du Chaillu is forgotten now, but
only a Nottingham voter would dare to say that jokes about
men and monkeys are extinct. In the following year
croquet began to try the patience and temper of English
men and maidens, as it still does; and in 1863 breech-loaders
are noted as having recently come in, in consequence of
which a larger number of pheasants and partridges went out.
That year also Speke and Grant discovered the source of
the Nile.
On the day before Christmas one of Mr. Punch's greatest
stalwarts, W. M. Thackeray, died, and in 1864 Mr. Punch
kost John Leech, who had been a tower of strength ever
since his fourth number.
In 1865 women began to add medicine to their
other industries and, according to Du Maurier, to smoke the
recently imported cigarette, which as an amelioration of
English life is little more than fifty years old; while in 1866
roller skating, which has been making periodical revisits
ever since, always accompanied by symptoms of fever, had
broken out in the streets—where it still remains in spite of
foolish appeals to the Home Secretary to stop it. That
year also saw the first sewing-machine.
In 1867 another first is recorded—the first joke on the
tendency of lady novelists to be a little too frank—an
exuberance which the forty and more intervening years
have done little to curb. It was also in 1867 that Linley
Sambourne, Mr. Punch’s famous “Sammy,” who died a
little less than a year ago, in harness almost to the last,
contributed his first drawing.
The greatest boon of the sixties, and one which has since
brightened the lives of millions of persons, was the bicycle.
It is true it was not the bicycle we know to-day—it was
awkward and noisy and snattering to the system—but it
was the forerunner of the real thing, and by 1869 Mr. Punch
was sufficiently interested in it to recommend ladies to try
side-saddles.

Punck, or rise London CHARivari, July 19, 1911.
1871 — 188o.
E|HE most remarkable events in English life in Mr.
Punch's fourth decade were probably the popularisa-
tion of the bicycle, the invention of lawn tennis,
and the introduction of the telephone. The bicycle was
steadily gaining ground throughout the ten years, but lawn
tennis was not played until 1874, and that questionable boon,
the telephone, appeared in 1878, although it was long, of
course, before every other house had passed under its
tyranny, as now, when only those who have none or
remember to leave the receiver off the rest know any peace
of mind. As for lawn tennis, since 1874 it has reached its
zenith and declined again.
In 1871 we first find the adjective “awful" entering
upon an existence which it has not yet quitted, in spite
of many successful rivals; in 1874 “quite ” joined
it as an indispensable part of smart speech; in 1876
the right people were expressing their thanks in the
phrase, “Ta, awfully ta,” while at the end of the period, in
1880, “utter” and “too too" began their brief but hectic
reign.
In dress, crinolines had long gone, and the reaction
was towards so tight a skirt that in 1876 sitting down was
found to be as much an impossibility as running was in the
hobble skirts of this and yester year.
Trade was now becoming a sanctioned resort for impover-
ished aristocrats, as it still is; and in 1877 a tendency to
manliness in woman's dress that has steadily increased was
noticed again, as it had been noticed in the forties by the
keen eye of Leech, and has been noticed since; for all fads
move in circles.
And so we reach 1880, when that famous movement began
which gave Mr. Punch more opportunities for sustained
ridicule than any other in his long life—the rise of the
aesthetes, with their sunflowers and lilies, their languid
enthusiasms and affected disdains.

were still strong in the opening years of Mr. Punch's
fifth decade; but their doom had sounded, and they
never recovered from the fashion of athletics for women
which, though it has ceased to be a craze, has never lost
popularity. In addition to their interest in feats of strength
we find women, after refusing, in 1883, to ride on 'buses,
refusing, in 1886, when garden seats came in, to ride any-
where else.
#". aesthetes—with Du Maurier hot on their trail—
In 1883 we also have a foretaste of the Suffragette move-
ment, which, however, was to wait for Mr. Punch's seventh
decade to develop into the real crusade that all of us now
know and many dread.
The changes of dress, always faithfully reflected in Mr.
Punch’s pages, ranged from the tight jerseys of 1880–1 to
the high sleeves of 1890 by way of the egregious bustle, which
alone of all the extravagances of fashion has yet shown no
tendency to revisit the scenes of its old horrible triumph.
Large fans and parasols came in in 1882, and a renewed
approximation to men's dress was a by-product of the
period. As for men, we find them giving up carrying latch-
keys for fear of spoiling their figures.
The foreign instrumental and hairy genius, the American
sifieuse, prize fighters, cowboys, and the infant musical
prodigy divided the attention of smart hostesses, while
among the crazes of the idle rich (who have always been
Mr. Punch’s best material) we find slumming, banjo-playing,
palmistry, pet dogs, and “Pigs in Clover" and kindred
puzzles (to be revived in the next century in the form of a
jigsaw). Falstaff's remark on his countrymen (which Mr.
Punch might have made his motto, had he needed one)
—“It was always yet the trick of our English nation, if
they have a good thing, to make it too common "-is
exemplified in the years between 1881 and 1890 as richly as
in any of the periods.
The last year of the decade saw Charles Keene's final
drawing in Punch, for which he had been working for forty
years.

Purch, on the Londox CHARIvakh July 19, 191z.
1891 — I 9oo.
HE legacy of the nineties is still being enjoyed by
us. The decade brought the cult of motoring,
bridge and golf to full flower; and all these things
delight us yet.
At the beginning of this period the wordless play was
delighting London; at the end extravagantly ample hatsworn
at matinées were blotting out the stage, as periodically they
have done since and will probably ever do. Tight skirts
were still in fashion, to which huger sleeves than before were
added, and in 1893 a happily futile effort to bring back
the crinoline was made, leading Du Maurier to an amusing
inversion of one of Leech's drawings in 1857, both of which
are given in this number. In the same year Mr. Punch
printed the first drawing by one of his most delightful and
gifted hands—poor Phil May.
In 1894 Society's romps of both sexes went mad over the
Barn dance, and in 1895 our playwrights had begun to
employ the drama as a vehicle for exhibiting problems in
social ethics, thus providing nuts for conversationalists and
critics to crack—not always with good humour and rarely
with any profit.
In 1896, the motor-bus first began to shake our houses,
and Herr Röntgen discovered his wonderful rays; while it
was in the same year, in the number for September 26, that
Du Maurier's last drawing appeared and Mr. Punch lost his
most searching social, satirist after Thackeray.
In 1897 electric cabs came and went; Society discovered
Battersea Park as a cycling course, and jockeys, imitating
the Americans, began to perch upon their horses' necks,
where they still are. In the summer of the following year
the introduction of the Continental custom of mixed bathing
into English watering-places had all the country by the ears;
and in the argument for and against it a heat was engen-
dered at which now we can all—as Mr. Punch did then—
only laugh.

ºù ND so we are come to the last decade of the seven,
A. when Mr. Punch and the world began the New
Century. If the ten years had to be described
swiftly they might be called, for England as a whole, the
era of universal golf, of bridge and motoring, of suffra-
gettes and flying. Golf, of course, had long been a
fashion, but it was only now that not to play it put one
outside the pale. -
The period produced no inventions to benefit the world
on the scale of the telephone, the bicycle and the camera;
and giants were few in the land. London, however, owes
to the ingenuity of these years her many tubes and more
taxis.
The dawn of 1901 found England pulsating with ping-
pong; while 1910 closed amid chatter as to the merits and
demerits of the harem skirt. In 1901 the devastating rule
of the imported nouveau art was powerful; in 191o life-long
intimacies were being shattered over the claims of Gauguin
and Matisse to be considered masters.
Japan, the conquering, gave us Jiu-Jitsu in the early years
of the century, and about the same time “rotten " and
“ripping ” became daily flowers of speech. Throughout
the decade attempts by a swimmers on the Channel were
being made, but no one could equal Captain Webb's feat of
1875. tº
The crowded tubes led to the precarious necessity of strap-
hanging, and by 1907 (as foreseen by Mr. Punch in the
forties) the taxi was with us and the knell of the cab-horse
had sounded, although a few hansoms and growlers still
struggle on.
Ping-pong's fierce short vogue in the beginning of the
decade was hardly shorter or fiercer than that of diabolo in
the middle, when there also set in that admirable fashion for
pageants which fostered so much local patriotism and taught
so much history.
And so Mr. Punch enters his eighth decade on July 27,
1911, and what that will bring forth, who knows? We can
but wait and see.

To Mr. PUNCH
On His Three-Score-and-Tenth Birthday
July 17, 1911.
As high Athene, helmed and speared,
From Zeus's cranium sprang to birth,
So on a sudden you appeared,
A finished masterpiece of mirth;
Prodigious from your infant stages,
Mature in wisdom as in art,
At once you joined the roll of sages,
A child in nothing but your heart.
You held a mirror up to life
In whose reflection, clear and clean,
The world and (what was more) his wife
Might see themselves as they were seen;
Gently you mocked the vogues and crazes --
By which the freaks of F.ashion swore,
And showed her newest-ſangled phases
Foolish as any gone before.
And not alone the instant hour
You captured ere its spell was fled;
You had the seer's peculiar dower,
The gift of seeing on ahead; '.
Through virgin woods untouched of axes
You gazed as o'er an open plain:
You saw that men would ride in taxis
And voyage through the vast inane.
And, lest the moment's passing show
Make us forget how Folly's game
Moves with the wheeling cycle's flow
And, changing still, is still the same,
We sample here your tomes that slumber
In light repose upon the shelf,
And in his special Birthday number,
Like history, Punch repeats himself,
And we, whom love and honour bind
To keep the old traditions bright,
Mediums of your informing mind,
Fain to interpret you aright—
This résumé of modes and manners
Our hands have ordered, Mr. P.,
And set it up, a string of banners,
To mark your Radium Jubileel
For now your years, three-score-and-ten,
Fulfil (to take the Psalmist's view)
The span assigned to common men,
Though no such limits hamper you;
So may you fare through countless ages
As one on whom the stars have smiled, .
Still carrying high your head, a sage's,
Your heart, the heart of just a child.
O. S.

54 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 26, 1911.
A RUN ON THE ELIBANK.
[From the Post-bag of the Chief Ministerial Whip.]
DEAR MAstºr of ELIBANK, Nobody who calls himself
a lºadical and a gentleman would for one moment think
of pressing his own claim to a place among the 500; and
naturally I have no desire for any reward but that of
a good conscience. It is permissible, however, to call
| your attention to the overwhelming claims of Robert
Bilton, who ſought so strenuously, though without suc-
cess, for the good cause in Birchester, East. My own
hard-fought contest in a neighbouring division gave me
the opportunity of observing his loyalty, his disinterested-
ness and his considerable wealth. He has, of course, no
idea that I am writing to you on his behalf.
Yours faithfully, Joseph BULPER.
DEAR MASTER OF ELIBANK, I hope I am too true a
Liberal to be suspected of any desire to advance my own
claim to a place among the 500. But I have it on my heart
to call your attention to the exceptional merits of Joseph
Bulper, who fought so well, though without good fortune, to
capture the Tory stronghold in Birchester, West. My own
similar contest in a neighbouring constituency afforded me
a chance of recognising his high character and generous
temperament. Loyal, disinterested, and extremely affluent,
he is the very type that you need for the purification
of the House of Peers. I may add that I am writing
without his knowledge.
Yours faithfully, Rob ERT BILTON.
DEAR MASTER of ELIBANK, Though at one time it
seemed almost too absurdly good to be true, it looks, after
all, as if your list of prospective Peers, among whom I
have the honour of being included, may not have been
made in vain. Most of the Unionist organs are playing
magnificently into our hands. But I confess that I had a
moment's disquietude on being shown by a Tory friend a
letter that he had received from another Tory. It is so
exceptionally intelligent that I quote it to you:—
“If the Peers,” it says, “take the advice of the more
hysterical Tory prints, they will be falling straight into
the trap which the Radicals have laid for them, just as
they fell when they threw out the Budget. “No surren-
der Be true to yourselves! Noblesse oblige l'— you know
the silly jargon. They are inciting the Peers to bring
permanent dishonour and ridicule on their Order, just for
the sake of enjoying the credit of a little cheap courage.
The House of Lords would never recover from the
contempt into which it would be brought by this influx
of 500 climbers from heaven knows where. And what
will become of the reforms faintly adumbrated in the
Preamble 2 Why should a Liberal Government trouble
about the reconstruction of a House in which they would
then have a majority 2 The Tories didn't when they had
the chance.
“I am sick of all this slush about fighting in the last
ditch. If you know that you have to bow to the inevitable,
what is there so heroic about a last ditch 2 Why not
do your bowing with a good grace in the last ditch but
one 2 -
“So far the Peers have been scrupulously reasonable in
their amendments, and history will so judge them. But I
give nothing for their position in history or anywhere else
if, for the sake of a tawdry exhibition of what is known as
British grit, but would actually be nothing better than a
childishly impotent act of bravado, they brought eternal
ridicule on their House and Order."
This letter, as I say, gave me a moment's disquietude,
but I tell myself that it is only a rare case of wisdom
crying out among a multitude of fools. You will, I am
sure, do your best to encourage the noisy jingoism of the
Tory Press.
Yours, in the sanguine hope that the Peers will once
more fall into our trap, THEoPHILUs GoLDBERG.
DEAR MASTER of ELIBANK, It has been pointed out in
the Tory Press that the list of new Peers to be created for
the express purpose of passing the Parliament Bill through
an unreformed Second Chamber will be greeted throughout
the country with a howl of derision. I am prepared to
face that music. The spirit of patriotism which animates
me can perhaps best be expressed in the form of poetry;
and I have pleasure in appending the following lines:—
There was a time when Liberal seers
Clamoured aloud for this agendum—
To take the hopeless House of Peers
And (as they put it) end or mend 'em;
Our stalwarts took a solemn oath
Thus to conclude a tedious matter,
To excavate the cankerous growth
And cure or kill—for choice, the latter.
But now we know a better way,
A milder, more polite solution;
“Let us beware, dear friends,” we say,
“Of tampering with the Constitution;
The thing is really sound enough ;
All this hereditary rot 'll
De stopped if we but pour new stuff
Into the ancient vintage bottle.”
There may be risks we can't escape;
Wines from the backwood, old and crusted,
May ill combine with last year's grape,
The bottles may be rudely busted;
Yet count on me for this high end;
An altruist, devout and hearty,
My very blood, a fruity blend,
I'd sacrifice to serve my Party.
It is not for me to say whether there are signs of humour
in the above; but, if you trace any, I trust that it will not
be a bar to my inclusion in a list which must have caused
you much merriment in the making.
Yours very truly, GRAHAM GRIMSHAw.
DEAR SIR,--I thank you for your letter of even date in
which you acknowledge my offer of £5,000 for a peerage.
I note your suggestion that some guarantee should be given
of my intention to vote straight on the Parliament Bill and
so fulfil the purpose of my creation. I shall be happy to
deposit with you certificates of stock to the value of £2,500
as security for my good faith.
Yours obediently, MADINGLEY GRILLSON.
DEAR SIR,-You have no doubt taken measures to secure
that your new Peers shall vote straight on the Parliament
Bill. But have you taken similar measures with regard to
the Home Rule Bill, which is the real object of the present
Constitutional changes? Have you ever sounded your
prospective creations on this subject? Have you sub-
mitted your list for the approval of Mr. John REDMOND 2
If not, there will be trouble. I write without any ulterior
motive, being solely concerned that your list should be as
perfect as possible (humanly speaking).
Yours faithfully, EBENEzer Hobbs.
P.S.–In my constituency, which by the way has always
returned a Liberal by an overwhelming majority, my own
soundness on Home Rule is a matter of universal remark.
Mr. Joshua Jabbercrombie presents compliments to the
MASTER of ELIBANK, and must say that in the present

DEAR MURRAY,+As you know, I have not the faintest

the object of ridicule among your friends. But my wife,

man of me that"I cannot bear to have her disappointed. I
appeal therefore to your well-known gallantry.
Yours sincerely, BERTRAM PETER-Jones.

Upon your task with conscientious bliss,

Full sweet, though somewhat nebulous perhaps,
Hung on your lips: whom would you grant the bays
Amongst these painter chaps?
And thus you spake:– “Oh, that's sweet, isn't it?”
“There's a sweet thing!” And still you would repeat—
“Look, this is rather, rather a sweet bit;
- And that one, that's just sweet!”
And so with scores—pathetic, tragic, droll;
I did my loyal best to deem you right,
But that fond notion of a sister-soul
Somehow, alas! took flight.
And now, though still you pour the once-loved meed
To cheer my Muse, in the old generous streams,
I feel as one whom Fate condemns to feed
Solely on chocolate-creams.

THE HOUSE WARMING.
III.-UNExPECTED GUESTs.
SoMETIMEs I do a little work in the
morning. Doctors are agreed now that
an occasional spell of work in the
mornings doesn't do me any harm.
My announcement at breakfast that
this was one of the mornings was
greeted with a surprised enthusiasm
which was most flattering. Archie
* offered me his own room where he
does his thinking; Simpson offered me
a nib; and Dahlia promised me a quiet
time till lunch. I thanked them all
and settled down to work.
. But Dahlia didn't keep her promise.
My first hour was peaceful, but after
that I had enquiries by every post.
Blair looked in to know where Myra
was; Archie asked if I'd seen Dahlia
anywhere; and when finally Thomas's
head appeared in the doorway I
decided that I had had enough of it.
“Oh, I say,” began Thomas, “will
you come and— but I suppose you're
busy.”
“Not too busy,” I said, “to spare a
word or two for an old friend,” and I
picked up the dictionary to throw at
him. But he was gone before I could
take aim.
“This is the end,” I said to myself,
and after five minutes more decided to
give up work and seek refreshment and
congenial conversation. To my surprise
I found neither. Every room seemed to
be empty, the tennis lawn was deserted,
and Archie's cricket-bag and Simpson's
golf-clubs rested peacefully in the hall.
Something was going on. I went back
to my work and decided to have the
secret out at lunch. -
“Now then,” I said, when that
blessed hour arrived, “tell me about it.
You've deserted me all morning, but
I'm not going to be left out.”
“It's your fault for shutting your-
self up.”
“Duty,” I said, slapping my chest—
“duty,” and I knocked my glass over
with an elbow. “Oh, Dahlia, I'm
horribly sorry. May I go and stand
in the corner 2''
“Let's talk very fast and pretend we
didn't notice it,” said Myra, helping
me to mop. “Go on, Archie.”
“Well, it's like this,” said Archie.
“A little while ago the Vicar called
here.”
“I don't see that that's any reason
for keeping me in the background. I
have met clergymen before and I know
what to say to them.”
“When I say a little while ago I
mean about three weeks. We'd have
asked you down for the night if we'd
known you were so keen on clergymen.
Well, as the result of that unfortunate

visit, the school treat takes place here
this afternoon, and lorblessme if I
hadn't forgotten all about it till this
morning.”
“You’ll have to help, please,” said
Dahlia.
“Only don't spill anything,” said
Thomas.
They have a poor sense of humour
in the Admiralty.
I took a baby in each hand and
wandered off to look for bees. Their
idea, not mine.
“The best bees are round here,” I
said, and I led them along to the front
of the house. On the lawn was Myra,
surrounded by about eight babies.
“Two more for your collection,” I
announced. “Wery fine specimens.
The word with them is bees.”
“Aren't they darlings? Sit down,
babies, and the pretty gentleman will
tell us all a story.”
“Meaning me?” I asked in surprise.
Myra looked beseechingly at me as she
arranged the children all round her. I
sat down near them and tried to think.
“Once upon a time,” I said, “there
was a+a—there was a was a a bee.”
Myra nodded approvingly. She
seemed to like the story so far. I didn't.
The great dearth of adventures that
could happen to a bee was revealed to
me in a flash. I saw that I had been
hasty.
“At least,” I went on, “he thought
he was a bee, but as he grew up his
friends felt that he was not really a bee
at all, but a dear little rabbit. His fur
was too long for a bee.”
Myra shook her head at me and
frowned. My story was getting too
subtle for the infant mind. I deter-
mined to straighten it out finally.
“However,” I added, “the old name
stuck to him, and they all called him a
bee. Now then I can get on. Where
was I ?”
But at this moment my story was
interrupted.
“Come here,” shouted Archie from
“You’re wanted.”
“I'm sorry,” I said, getting up
quickly. “Will you finish the story
for me 2 You'd better leave out the
part where he stings the Shah of
PERSIA. That's too exciting. Good-
bye.” And I hurried after Archie.
“Help Simpson with some of these
races,” said Archie. “He’s getting
himself into the dickens of a mess.”
Simpson had started two races
simultaneously : hence the trouble.
In one of them the bigger boys had
to race to a sack containing their
boots, rescue their own pair, put them
on, and race back to the starting-point.
Good. In the other the smaller boys,
each armed with a paper containing a
problem in arithmetic, had to run to
their sisters, wait for the problem to be
solved, and then run back with the
answer. Excellent. Simpson at his most
inventive. Unfortunately, when the
bootless boys arrived at the turning
post, they found nothing but a small
problem in arithmetic awaiting them,
while on the adjoining stretch of grass
young mathematicians were trying,
with the help of their sisters, to get
into two pairs of boots at once.
“Hallo, there you are,” said Simpson.
“Do help me ; I shall be mobbed in
a moment. It's the mothers. They
think the whole thing is a scheme for
stealing their children's boots.
you start a race for them 2"
“You never ought to go about with-
out somebody. Where's Thomas?”
“He’s playing rounders. He scored
a rounder by himself just now from an
overthrow. But we shall hear about
it at dinner. Look here, there's a game
called ‘Twos and Threes.” Couldn't you
start the mothers at that ? You stand
in-twos, and whenever anyone stands in
front of the two then the person behind
the two runs away.”
“Are you sure?”
“What do you mean?” said Simpson.
“It sounds too exciting like that. I
can't believe it.”
“Go on, there's a good chap. They'll
know how to play all right.”
“Oh, very well. Shall I ask them to
take their boots off first or not ?”
Twos and Threes was a great
Success.
I found that I had quite a flair for
the game. I seemed to take to it
naturally.
By the time our match was finished
Simpson's little foot-wear trouble was
over and he was organising a grand
three-legged race.
“I think they are all enjoying it,”
said Dahlia.
“They love it,” I said; “Thomas is
perfectly happy making rounders.” .
“But I meant the children. Don't
you think they love it too? The babies
seem so happy with Myra.” .
“They're sweet,” I agreed. “It was
as much as I could do to tear myself
away from them.”
“I hope they all had enough to eat
at tea.”
“Allowing for a little natural shy-
ness I think they did well. And I
didn't spill anything. Altogether it
has been rather a success.”
Dahlia stood looking down at the
children, young and old, playing in the
field beneath her, and gave a sigh of
happiness.
“Now,” she said, “I feel the house
is really warm.” A. A. M.

ON THE AERopLANE RouTE BETWEEN HENDoN AND BRookila NDs.
BEFORE THEIR TIME.
THE discovery by a modern oculist
that the life-long eye trouble of Mr.
PEPYs not only could have easily been
put right by proper glasses but was the
cause of serious obliquity of observa-
tion has already given historians
profoundly to think. PEPYs's myopia
made him inaccurate all through.
In other words, it was not CHARLEs II.
and his Court that were wrong, but
the diarist. His inability to see straight
has brought lasting infamy on one of
the purest periods of English history.
NELL Gwyn NE was really a devout
Orange woman,all her sympathies being
in Holland. Louise DE KERouai LLE
was a réligeuse of unusual attainments.
CHARLEs himself, although no doubt
fond of female society, sought it
entirely for moral and intellectual
stimulus. PEPYs, however, having
come upon the scene too early to be
fitted with such spectacles as are now
within the reach of every German
clerk, saw wrong, and wrote wrong,
and the gravest injustice has resulted.
Hard on this staggering revelation
comes another, even more remarkable.
HENRY VIII.'s idiosyncrasies, it has
been ascertained, were due not to any
depravity or self - will of his own
encouragement, but wholly to sup-
pressed chilblains, which, had they
been taken in time by modern medical
skill, would have quickly succumbed
to treatment. HENRY WIII.'s musical
accomplishments are well known and
have been illustrated at his lectures by
Sir FREDERICK BRIDGE. That dis-
tinguished antiquary has,it is rumoured,
made this discovery, which will revolu-
tionise the view, hitherto taken by
most historians, of the character of
that much-canvassed monarch. From a
fragment of a diary kept by the King
when a boy of fifteen,and now deciphered
for the first time, it appears that his
lessons on the spinet were a source of
great discomfort to him during the
winter months owing to the severe
chilblains from which he suffered.
Further discoveries point to the fact
that, owing to the drastic treatment
then in vogue, the chilblains were
driven into his system, and in this
suppressed or cryptic form continued
to torment him at intervals throughout
his life, the accesses of the complaint
exactly coinciding with those harsh
and homicidal acts for which he has
been so generally condemned. In fact,
adapting the much-quoted couplet of
Mr. KIPLING, we may say:-
“Never the stings of chilblains in his finger
joints awake,
But a wife is beheaded by Harry or a prisoner
sent to the stake.”
Had only the resources of modern
medicine been available KING HENRY
VIII., so the eminent musical antiquary
persuasively argues, would not only have
dispensed with repeated divorces, but
would probably have been the first
royal Mormon and hexagamist, and a
very charming one to boot, affable and
considerate to all manner of folk.
Again, the American savant, Dr.
Cyrus Earwaker, fired by the PEPys
revelations, has been making a study
of SUETONIUs, and has discovered that
that biographer, hitherto so respected,
was suffering all his life, unknown to the
rudimentary medical profession then
available for Roman disorders, from
chronic dyspepsia, which had the effect,
unobserved in that dark age, but now
known to be a common accompani-
ment, of so distorting his brain that
no verity could emerge from it. The
far-reaching consequences of such a
malady will at once spring to the
mind. It is, for example, chiefly upon
the testimony of SUEToNIUs that the
world has based its low opinion of
NERO. But, since SUEton IUs was
doomed by his weakness to a life
which may be described as one long
terminological inexactitude, it follows
that everything that he says about
NERO is wrong. NERO, for instance
(to take but one case), so far from
fiddling while Rome burned, was so
much of a virtuoso that he burned
with impatience and irritation when-
ever Rome fiddled. Had SUETONIUS,
Dr. Earwaker now tells us, merely taken
a dose of Rügen salts every other morn-
ing, his dyspepsia would have vanished
and his writings be authentic. But
Rügen salts were then unknown; Dr.
Earwaker was unknown; and the world
has been misled.

THE TRIALS OF A WOMAN
OF GENIUS.
III.
Friday.—Amongst my letters this
morning was one which I confess gave
me a thrill of satisfaction. It ran
thus:—
DEAR MADAM, As a profound ad-
mirer of your poems, I should regard
it as a sacred privilege to be allowed to
make your acquaintance during my
stay in the old country. Should you
be visiting London during the next
fortnight, I should be inexpressibly
proud to call upon you then; otherwise
I venture to suggest that I should run
down by train to pay my respects to
the most inspired British poetess.
Yours reverently,
MiRIAM STOOKER,
President of the Semiramis Club,
Chicago.
The letter was dated from an address
in Jermyn Street and written in a
picturesque handwriting. I have had
many appreciative notices of my poems
in the Press; but until to-day no one
has crossed the Atlantic to see me.
It was therefore with a certain amount
of pride that I read the letter to Peter.
To my amazement he abstained from
any jocular or disparaging remarks, and
simply said, “You can't let Miriam
come all the way from London for an
aſternoon call. You must ask her to
stop the night; then I can take a day
off and give her a game of golf at
Huntercombe.” This was quite nice
of Peter, but I couldn't help asking:
“How can you possibly tell whether
she can play golf, or would care to
play with you?” “Play golf?
should just think——” Here Peter
broke off unaccountably and then went
on, “A girl with a name like that is
sure to be able to hit a saucy bang
from the tee. Anyhow, you send her
a wire at once and say I'm dying to
meet her : “The thought of you, dear
Miriam, excites me to delirium.’” So
I wrote the telegram. Peter went off
in high spirits, and I settled down to a
studious morning, exhilarated by the
anticipation of Miss Stooker's visit.
This was my morning for musical
composition. Until lately I had
thought of taking lessons in the tech-
nique of composition, but WAGNER's
example, as recorded in his Auto-
biography, has proved them to be un-
necessary. Teaching, text-books and
exercises filled him with repulsion and
disgust. For him “music was a
spirit " : for me, too, it shall be the
same. My plan is very simple. I in-
provise at the pianoforte; the phono-
graph takes down my inspirations;
I manners.
Miss Peveril subsequently reduces
them to musical notation, and the
composition is then sent to Mr. Basil
Urquhart, Mus. Bac., to revise the MS.
and prepare it for the printer. Just
now I am engaged on six Miniatures
entitled “Ecstasy,” “Exaltation,”
“Equanimity, “Resignation,” “De-
jection,” and “Despair.” Mr. Urquhart
tells me he thinks that M. Pommeloff
would play them at one of his recitals
if I paid him a hundred guineas; but
Peter will not hear of it. As he put it,
“I am still an agile old antelope, but
I can't spring to that.” . . .
Just before lunch received a telegram
from Miss Stooker: “Charmed to come
to-morrow.” In the afternoon prac-
tised cosmic gymnastics, ethical deep
breathing, and gave Lilith her first
lesson in esoteric arithmetic. On his
return Peter immensely pleased to hear
Miss Stooker is coming, and drank her
health at dinner. - w
Saturday.—Too unsettled by the
prospect of my visitor to do any great
work this morning. Practised attitudes
suitable to the reception of a dis-
tinguished stranger and composed a
few deprecatory remarks. Had my
hair done by Bateson in the Greek
style with a pink fillet, and dressed
Lilith in her white satin frock with
Afghan sandals. I write this on the
lawn where I am awaiting Miss
Stooker.
7 P.M. This has indeed been a
strange and perturbing experience.
Our guest arrived in the motor, which
fetched her from the station in time
for lunch. She is a tall and striking-
looking young woman with a rich
contralto speaking voice and charming
Her mode of greeting me
was quite original. Advancing across
the lawn, she knelt down by my chair,
seized my hand and kissed it, saying,
“And this is the hand that wrote
Spindrift and Gossamer. Oh joy un-
speakable! To think that I should
be allowed to gaze on the English
Corinna.” Her emotion drove all my
rehearsed remarks out of my head and
I could only utter some commonplace
civilities. At that moment Lilith came
running out, and Miss Stooker broke
into a fresh outburst of admiration.
“Angelic cherub Doth not her brow
bespeak intellect!” Then she quoted
something that sounded like Greek, and
I had to pretend that I understood it.
To relieve the strain I suggested a turn
round the garden before lunch. But her
eulogies never ceased. It was a perfect
carnival of panegyric, and more than
once I found myself blushing at the
exuberance of her praise. At lunch,
however, I induced her to tell me some-
thing about herself, and my moral
temperature was at once lowered. She
is a professional musician and has been
studying at Vienna. She has been a
pupil of Max Reger and of Ravel. She
speaks French, German and Italian
perfectly. She has composed an opera,
to a libretto of her own, which has
been accepted at Weimar. After lumch
she wished to hear some of my music,
but a wise instinct impelled me to
decline, and I got her to play me her
opera instead. The result was at once
delightful and humiliating. She plays
and sings divinely; her music is extra-
ordinarily interesting; and the whole
º inspired me with a horrid mis-
giving. Am I a genius, or a perfect
fraud? This astonishing creature
knows ten times as much as I do, and,
what is worse, she can do the things
splendidly that I have to get other
people to help me to do indifferently.

—Looking over volume of Parlia-
mentary report a century old, read
that on 10th April, 1811, “Lord Folk-
ston E [sic] called the attention of the
House to the scarcity of small change.”
If his Lordship were still with us, as
happily the holder of his name (with
an “e” added midway) is, he would find
no ground for repetition of his com-
plaint. Small change abounds. There
are eighty-eight pieces, chiefly three-
penny bits, represented in the questions
addressed to-day to Ministers and
painstakingly answered. With few ex-
ceptions a look in at the office of the
Department concerned, and a couple of
minutes' conversation with the Secre-
tary or Head Clerk, would satisfy in
full measure genuine desire for infor.
mation. But if that course were
adopted where would be the opportunity
of getting for nothing the bold ad.

For Ministers who personally stand
the racket or others who have the work
delegated to them, thing to do is
to rattle out reply in quickest fashion,
regardless of rhyme or reason or
the absolute impossibility of audience
following sequence of sentences. In
this competition CHIEF SECRETARY FOR
IRELAND and FINANCIAL SECRETARY To
TREASURY triumphantly hold their place
in the first flight. SEELY makes a
promising third. But his practice is
less extensive. Since NAPOLEoN B.

HOT WEATHER DELICACIES.
A NICE CUP.-Dissolve an acid drop
(or bull's-eye) in three or four gallons
of drinking water. Add ice until the
water is quite cold; then serve.
This simple cup is a capital thing for
children's parties, and is a great
favourite with the little ones.
FRozEN RAREBIT.-MakesomeWelsh
rarebits in the usual manner with toast
and cheese. When nicely done, remove
from oven, and place in refrigerator till

for bachelor parties and informal
gatherings where reporters are not
present.
PotAGE Polaire. — Prepare some
soup with stock, vegetables and
seasoning. When ready, place in
freezing machine until the thermometer,
when immersed in the preparation,
marks 32° (Fahrenheit), or there-
abouts. Sprinkle with Chili pepper,
and serve.
RED MULLET A LA Boxx E FEMME.—
Place a red mullet on a gridiron; hang
it in a cool draughty place, and fan,
until the fish has lost its unwholesome
ruddy glow. It is then ready. The
congratulations of the assembled gour-
mets will repay the housewife for the
trouble involved in preparing this
delicious plat.
JACKET. Potatoes.—Cut some pieces
of felt to fit each potato; sew up, and
place under shower-bath until dinner-
bell rings. Serve with cold chisel and
salt to taste. This little known method
of preparing the savoury tuber has only
to be tried to be appreciated.
BATH OLIVERs CHAPPED.—Soak some

THE WALKING TOUR.
“WHERE shall we finish to-day 2” said Joseph as he
inspected the customary dish of eggs and bacon.
“Well, we haven't even begun breakfast yet,” said
Herbert. “There's no hurry. Let's breakfast and smoke
and think about it. And isn't this the worst bacon you
ever put a fork into ? When I think of the ripping bacon
I get at home, all thin and streaky and delicious, it makes
me want to cry.”
“‘A sorrow's crown of sorrow,’” said Joseph.
“Oh, bother your crowns of sorrow,” said Herbert.
“That's no excuse for time bacon.”
“‘A sorrow's crown of sorrow,'”
remembering happier bacon.”
: “Of all the futile remarks,” protested Herbert, “that's
about the most futile. However I don't want to start
quarrelling. You'll do all that's wanted in that line before
the day's done. Shove over the tea-pot, there's a good
chap.”
“It says that The Green Man at Oxtable is ‘a hostelry
noted for its good cheer '"—Joseph was reading from a
guide-book.
“Yes, but it is also said that the rotten place we're
breakfasting at was celebrated for its old-fashioned comfort.
Think of the supper we had last night. Think of the beds.
Think of this breakfast."
“Oh, eat your breakfast,” said Joseph, “and don't talk
so much about it. You seem to expect to find a Ritz or a
Carlton in every village.”
“Now that just shows how little you know about me.
I've never been in the Ritz or the Carlton. The smart
set's too smart for me. I daresay you like it; I don't.
All I want is a decent bed and good food plainly cooked.”
“This man,” said Joseph, looking at the ceiling, “wants
his beds plainly cooked.”
“Yes,” said Herbert, “ and if you were plainly cooked
too it might knock some of the nonsense out of you.”
There was an interval of silent munching. Then Joseph
began again – -
“I’ve been thinking about you,” he said, “and I've
been wondering how we ever came to start on this walking
tour together.”
“You’ve been wondering, have you ?” said Herbert.
“I'm simply lost in amazement. What in the world
induced me to be such a consummate fool I can't make out.”
“Induced ' " said Joseph. “There was no inducement
about it. Nature did it for you. Of course you may have
helped a bit, but * *
continued Joseph, “is
doing. You're calling me a consummate fool.”
“That's what you called yourself. I'm only agreeing
with you; but it's difficult to satisfy some people.”
“I don't want any of your agreements, and I can do
without your satisfactions. If I am a fool, at any rate I
don't try to pose as a genius. Some people like that kind of
thing. I don't. A plain Englishman's good enough for me.”
“Quite the contrary,” said Joseph. “You were a grubby
little boy, of course, but you're rather a handsome man.
There's something about your forehead and eyes * >
“Now that,” said Herbert, “is quite the silliest old joke
in the world. And if I was a grubby little boy, what were
you? A dandified little jackanapes with his hair parted in
the middle. It's all parting now.”
“Come, come,” said Joseph, “we’ll leave our hideous
pasts and our disreputable presents alone. If we squabble
like this we shall never get on with the tour, and then
what would our friends say? Where shall we finish our
walk to-day ?”
“I suppose,” said Herbert, “you know what you're ||
“Oh, anywhere you like,” said Herbert, “so long as we
get away from this place.”
Joseph dipped into the guide-book again.
“I vote for Oxtable,” he said; “it’s only fifteen miles,
and we ought to have a light day to-day. “Lightly come,
and lightly go,' you know.” -
“Is that another rubbishy quotation ?” said Herbert.
“Because if it is I want you to understand that I'm not
the man to knuckle under to a quotation. My boots are all
right; my feet are in splendid condition, and I'm out to do
twenty miles to-day. It's absurd to do anything less than .
twenty miles a day on a walking tour. Fifteen miles! Pooh!"
“You were keen enough to stop five miles short of this
yesterday, anyhow,” said Joseph viciously.
“Only because you kept on complaining about your big
toe. I should be ashamed to have a toe like that.”
“Don’t you fling my toe in my face,” said Joseph. “It's
a better toe than any of yours even when it's got a blister
on it.” -
“That's a mere gratuitous insult,” said Herbert. “I’ll
back my toes against yours any day of the week, one down
t'other come on. I'm going to walk twenty miles to-day.”
“Why not start now 2 Walk two and a half miles out
and two and a half back here. I'll wait for you, and then
we can really start and do the fifteen to Oxtable.”
“A nice genial companion I've got,” said Herbert. “No,
we'll start together, and, as you're feeling so feeble to-day,
we'll finish at Oxtable. But that's the last concession
I'll make.”
ON A SUPERABUNDANCE OF HAIRPINS.
When little wintering birds do scour the woods
And cannot find the sweet accustomed grub,
Nor any veg. nor yet fruitarian foods
Where with to loose their note,
So then my pipe oft chokes within its stub
For lack of pins to prick the diphtheritic throat.
But now the months of plenty bring their store
To swell the song that speaks a grateful crop,
And I can smoke a pipe of purer bore,
With wreaths of fragrance crowned ;
For lo! where buds and stricken vestas drop,
There do these handy little bifurcates abound.
In some, the lustier virtues make a show;
Others of dainty, sylph-like wriggles boast,
And all with daffodils and daisies grow
From earth's most secret fire;
Desired of girls, they grace the smoker most,
Whether he puffs a clay or sucks a juicy briar.
I often find them by a rustie seat,
Peeping from out the adjacent dust and stones,
Just where at dusk of evening lovers meet
And tenderly embrace;
Neaera, turning home for supper, moans
Her disarrayéd locks and pats them into place.
So from the surplus stock of Summer's gift
I hope to keep unsullied one or two
For future use, and thus by dint of thrift
Tide o'er the time of dearth
When ceremonious winter lays taboo
On all the frolic rites that tend the hairpin's birth.

It should be understood that this holiday does not apply to drapery

As I always endeavour to point out
in this column, it is not manners
which maketh man, as old WILLIAM of
WYKEHAM so ungrammatically insisted,

instant. Take the most perfect-man-
nered man you can think of—the very
Bayard of daily life—strip him naked
and put him in Society, and where is
he 2. Of what use are his wonderful
man-making manners then? None.
No, manners are all very well, all
very necessary and charming, no doubt;
but there are two things against them.
One is that they are no use until you
are dressed; and the other is that they
are gratuitous and therefore do not lead
(as clothes do) to healthy competition.
+ + + + +
One of the strangest things about
men's clothes is that your little tailor
can sometimes cut better than your
swagger one. There is a curious and
capricious chance in these matters. It
is like genius in, let us say, literature
or art. It often flowers in the least
expected places, and its practitioners
are not invariably important-looking or
even clean. I do not for a moment
wish to suggest that Mr. Thomas
Snipling, of 2,001, High Holborn, is in
so small a way of business as to be
despicable. Far from it. But at the
first blush one would hardly expect that
behind his modest shop-window lurked
a sartorial artist of extraordinary gifts.
Yet so it is. Mr. Snipling's three-
guinea suits of Cheviot, Angora or Gamp
tweeds are a marvel. My advice to
every one of my readers this week—is
to give Mr. Snipling a trial.

To some extent these remarks may
be applied also to footwear. It is not
always the dearest and classiest boots
that are the best or that look the best.
It is perfectly possible to find here
and there a small but conscientious
boot-maker whose results are equal to
those of Bond Street, say, at a third of
the cost. I have been asked—that is
to say, I should like purely out of a
passion for the good and the true—to
recommend Mr. Arthur Bailey of 49*,
Cheapside, whose boots are not only
dressy and attractive, but fit like any-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
INEVER read a story I agreed with less and enjoyed more
than The Glory of Clementina Wing (John LANE). I
could not bring myself to love the unkempt artist who
smoked cheap cigarettes and wore a smudge of paint on her
cheek, notwithstanding all the magnificent qualities of
which Mr. W. J. Locke informed me she was undoubtedly
possessed. Still less could I believe that this Clementina
could on occasion burst out of ugliness and disarray into
instant beauty and fine feathers of the latest mode, thereby
defeating in the struggle for a man's soul an expert, almost
professional, seductress. For myself, I was completely
charmed with the latter and lent her all my sympathy from
the first : and so would the author himself have done but for
his set purpose of glorifying Miss Wing. Thus much for our
disagreement. As to the joy of it, I have only to say that
the book is in the author's easiest and most brilliant vein,
and that he has ex-
the other introduces us to a most dashing amateur detective
(feminine). It must, perhaps, be pardoned to such an
enthusiastic motorist as Mr. PEMBERTON that on page 22
Dr. Seagrove drove to the Manor Gardens in a dog-cart,
and that on the following page we read, “Seagrove sprang
out of his car anyhow.” -
I think we may fairly assume that Mr. RANDAL
CHARLTON, the author of The Bewildered Bride (EvelEIGH
NAsh), knows and admires his MEREDITH. Certainly there
is internal evidence to this effect. “In the High Court of
Life the action brought by Bosoms against Business makes
the most vivacious suit in a dull cause list" was what
Mr. Hillary St. Ann (note the name!) scribbled in his
common-place book d propos of the love affairs of his
cousin Harry and Amy Meadows. For further proof, we
have the pair eloping, with Hillary's assistance, and de-
tained at a wayside inn, where they are mothered by the
sentimentally-minded proprietress, one Mrs. Blunt—surely

the deathless Berry. To
tell what further hap-
pens at this same inn
would be to give away
the secret of the book;
but it may safely be
said that it is suffi-
ciently startling to ex-
plain the title. As a
matter of ſact, Amy was
perhaps not so much
bewildered as angry,
and I can't say I blame
her. Mr. CHARLToN,
in his preface, wants
me to believe that the
story is one of actual
happenings; which in-
deed it very well may
be. What is much more
important is that it is
brightly and dramatic-
ally told, despite the
timist can speak with
a sharp tongue from the clearest insight.
I discovered (and I think it was rather clever of me
because the acknowledgment is in small print and at the
bottom of a page) that Mr. MAx PEMBERTON is grateful to
various journals for permission to reproduce the stories
which are collected in The Summer Book; and I wish to
add my gratitude not only to the editors but also to the
author. Presumably this book gets its title because it is
suitable for consumption in hot weather; at any rate I
read it from cover to cover (excluding Messrs. MILLs AND
Boon's copious advertisements) under a broiling sun and
did not even stop for so little as a tea-interval. Mr.
PEMBERTON is not a master of the short-story, but never-
theless he is sufficiently inventive and original to give his
readers an attractive run for their money. I beg those
who begin with the first tale, and fail to like it, to believe

might have succeeded in the difficult task of making fun
out of drunkenness, but in Mr. PEMBERTON's hands “The
Trip to Jerusalem” is an absurdity and a vulgar one.
“Joie-de-Loup” and “The Nigger” are, however, specimens
of the author's skill when he is at the very top of his game.
The one shows an intimate knowledge of a child's mind, and
somewhat sententious
aphorisms of Hillary. A graver defect of taste is the
obviously deliberate gusto with which the author ac-
centuates the more Elizabethan episodes in his not
always quite pleasant plot. As the parent wrote to the
Board-School teacher on the subject of anatomy, “It isn't
necessary—and besides it's rude!”

[AUGUST 2, 1911.
HOW I GOT THERE.
[The following lines, which betray a mood of confident assurance not
justified by the subsequent course of events, are alleged to have been
picked up in the neighbourhood of The Pall Mall Gazette, and would
seem to have been composed on behalf of one of the prospective Peers on
the day after the HALSBURY banquet.]
Though Virtue's record, by itself,
Should have ensured a rich requital
Even without the ready pelf
That oils the entrée to a title;
Yet not to me alone the credit's due,
No, nor to Asquith, on whose soul it grated,
Being Prime Minister, to work a coup
That One Above dictated.
Nor he, by whose permissive nod
We live—an awful obligation—
Not REDMOND (J.), that puissant god,
Could have accomplished this creation;
'Tis not to him that (under Heaven) we owe
This largesse of hereditary lustres,
It is to Messrs. F. E. SMITH & Co.,
Those very useful thrusters!
The help of HALSBURY, too, I hymn;
No praise that I can here express 'll
Convey the valour, calm and grim,
That earned a dinner at the Cecil;
Where, having boomed his high old Tory pride,
They utilized that honorific function
To drench their chiefs (the same that he'd defied)
With streams of loyal unction.
I cannot, having missed the meal,
Judge if the roisterers showed a fair case
For thus protesting love and zeal
While kicking leaders down the staircase;
But this is sure—that, as I lightly go
To join the new creation's noble musters,
I raise my coronet to SMITH & Co.,
Those very perfect thrusters. O. S.
MOTOR AND SUPER-MOTOR.
[We are informed that motor-cars, after undergoing a slight modifica.
tion, are now being used as the propelling power in house-boats.]
A HEROIC rescue was effected yesterday at John-o'-
Groats. While signals were being sent to a ship in
distress a hundred miles away the wireless telegraph broke
down. A passing motorist with rare presence of mind
hitched the band of the apparatus to the wheel of his car,
re-started it, and a lifeboat was instantly communicated
with. He declined to give his name or receive any thanks,
stating that he had so often caused the death of innocent
people that he owed some reparation.
In the smartest circles Spring-cleaning will be done next
season by the help of the stud of motor-cars, moored out
on the lawn, to drive the vacuum cleaners.
The omni-motor is regarded as the greatest triumph of
the age. By touching different levers—to learn the names
of which demands a long apprenticeship—the operator can
make it cut hair, boil water, work a pianola, mangle shirts,
turn a cinematograph, clean the chimneys, beat eggs or
mow and roll a tennis lawn. In case of invasion it can be
sunk and form a useful submarine, or have its tyres fully
inflated and serve as a capable military airship.

baby.'"—Natal Witness.
Far better use the fire-escape.
CATCHING HER EYE.
WE had come to an end of dinner quite naturally at our
end of the table. It had been a fearfully long one. The
strain of keeping up an animated conversation for two
solid hours was beginning to tell on my host, and his eyes
brightened as he glanced at his wife at the other end of
the table. She would get up in a minute, and he would be
able to re-tell the story of how his sherry had been
smuggled from the Imperial cellars at St. Petersburg–
probably to more grateful listeners. Meanwhile, very light
small-talk was what was wanted.
“When I was in Spain,” he began, and then remembered
the anecdote was too long.
“I must tell you an amusing story of how I tried to buy
a blouse at the sales the other day,” I said, seeing his
difficulty, and half-way through bungled the point through
over-curtailing it. Stories were no good. We must restrict
ourselves to remarks.
“Are you going to Cowes?” I said recklessly, and
caught my vis-á-vis looking at me curiously. Since the
savoury she had confined herself to a sympathetic smile.
and now affected mild amusement at the absurdity of
chatter after her half-hour's earnest discussion on the
Insurance Bill. But something had to be done.
“N-n-no, that is to say, yes,” he replied quickly,
“though I confess racing does not attract me. But I have
a collection of model yachts. Dear me, yes. I must show
it you. I-I rather want to see if––– " He looked
frowningly at his wife. He mustn't begin on any of his
collections. The chief points of a hobby can't be run
through between the picking up of gloves and the opening
of a door. As far as I could make out, she was discussing
the successful lighting of reception rooms, illustrated by
diagrams on the back of her menu. A little sigh of dis-
appointment escaped him, and in despair he began to offer
me more grapes. “No, really,” I said very firmly, and
nearly added, “I never eat fruit at breakfast.” Was it
yesterday or a week ago that we had sat down to dine 2.
There was a growing restlessness on his part after this,
but pushing his chair back suddenly and creaking it—his
eyes fixed on his wife with what would have been to me
mesmeric force—had no effect whatever. Then he played
a strong card. “My wife always says,” he remarked very
loudly and deliberately—“my wife always says—I was
telling them, my dear, you always say that * >
It failed to reach her. He creaked again, this time
almost ostentatiously, and even gave an extra flourish of
his pocket-handkerchief in the unnecessary process of not
blowing his nose. I felt sorry for him. She appeared to
be short-sighted as well as deaf. My neighbour on the
other side turned to me.
“Tell me some more of your experiences,” he said. “I
liked the story of your dancing with a waiter by mistake.
I am much interested in sociology.”
An idea came to me.
“I was bathing once,” I said in my clearest and most
bell-like tones—“it was in Devonshire and we were a large
mixed party—and I had just got a new bathing-dress. It
was a very pretty one, but I had never worn it before,
and y -
I was aware of an eye flashing at me from the bottom of
the table.
“Shall we leave them to smoke 2" my hostess said
sweetly as we all rose.
“A delightfully cool breeze was blowing . . . Several ladies, both
Indian and European, were among the gusts."—Said Gazette.
It sounds more like a hurricane.

HAs it ever struck you, gentle reader,
When the summer nights are warm

What a boon it means to golden fancies,

How (conversely) trade in true romances

Near the rhododendron clumps;
Odorous is the earth, the heaven's starlit,
I am wearing evening pumps;

Sweet young things; but, gracious! if the weather
Hadn't been so fine this year,
Could they have been thrown so oft together?
No, it would have failed, I fear.
That's what does it: moonlight and the murmur
Made by sympathetic trees;
Nothing can compare for binding firmer
Amatory knots with these:
Comes a kind offeyness after dinner
When Selene lords the night
(I remember, I proposed at Pinner,
Years ago, on such a night).
Nay, and even now, I am not certain;
In this atmosphere of balm,
Ringed about by night's bejewelled curtain,
Listening to the streamlet's psalm,
Possibly I too might come out stronger,
Feel again love's passion-swirl,
If the fine spell lasts a little longer,
If I meet some lovely girl. Evoe.

IV.-A Word IN SEAsoN.
“ARCHIE,” said Blair, “what 's that

“That,” said Archie, “is where we
hide the corpses of our guests. I
sleep with the key under my pillow.”
“This is rather sudden,” said
Simpson. “I’m not at all sure that I
‘l should have come if I had known
that.”
“Don’t frighten them, dear; tell
them the truth.”
“Well, the truth is,” said Archie,
| “that there was some idea of a little
play-acting there occasionally. Hence
the curtain-rod, the emergency exit
and other devices.”
“Then why haven't we done any ?
We came down here to open your house
for you, and then you go and lock up
the most important room of all, and
sleep with the key under your pillow.”
“It’s too hot. But we'll do a little
charade to-night if you like—just to aii
the place.”
“Hooray,” said Myra, “I know a
lovely word.”
Myra's little word was in two
syllables and required three performers.
Archie and I were kindly included in
her company. Simpson threatened to
follow with something immense and
archaic, and Thomas also had some-
thing rather good up his sleeve, but I
am not going to bother you with these.
One word will be enough for you.
First Scene.
“Oh, good morning,” said Myra.
She had added a hat and a sunshade to
her evening frock, and was supported
by me in a gentlemen's lounge coat
and boater for Henley wear.
“Good morning, Mum,” said Archie,
hitching up his apron and spreading
his hands on the table in front of him.

“Show the lady what you have got,”
I said sternly.
“Well Mum, I'm right out of

more of an ironmonger really. The

road. You wouldn't like a garden
roller now 2 I can do you a nice
garden-roller for two pound five, and
that's simply giving it away.”
“Oh, shall we have a nice roller?”
said Myra eagerly.
“I’m not going to carry it home,” I
said.
“That's all right, Sir. My little lad
will take it up on his bicycle. Two
pounds five, mum, and sixpence for
the mouse-trap the gentleman's been
sitting on. Say three pounds.”
Myra took out her purse.
Second Scene.
We were back in our ordinary clothes.
“I wonder if they guessed that.'
said Archie.
“It was very easy,” said Myra. “I
should have thought they'd have seen
it at once.”
“But of course they're not a very
clever lot,” I explained. “That fellow
with the spectacles—”
“Sumpson, his name is,” said Archie.
“I know him well. He 's a wonderful
golfer.”
“Well, he looks learned enough. I
expect he knows all right. But the

“Don’t you think perhaps we'd
better do it over again to make sure ?”
“Oh, no, it was perfectly obvious.
Let's get on to the final scene.”
“I'm afraid that will give it away
rather,” said Myra.
“I'm afraid so,” agreed Archie.
“It always seems to me rather silly
to do the whole word—it makes it so
easy. But I suppose we'd better.”
Third Scene.
We sat on camp-stools and looked up
at the ceiling with our mouths open.
“’E's late,” said Archie.
“I don't believe 'e's coming, and
I don't mind 'oo 'ears me sye so,” said
Myra. “So there.”

There was silence for a little, and

pocket.
“Wunner wot they'll invent next,”
he said, and munched stolidly.

“Well done,” said Dahlia.
“Thomas and I have been trying to

is terrific. My first idea was “codfish,

‘silkworm' or ‘wardrobe.’ Thomas's
suggestions have been ‘submarine,’

says he never saw anybody who had so
much the whole air of a wurzel as
Archie. The indefinable elam of the
wurzel was there.”
“Can't you really guess?” said
Myra eagerly. “I don't know whether
I want you to or not. Oh no, I don't

“Then I withdraw mangel-wurzel,”
said Simpson gallantly.

Sunday.—Another perturbing day.
Peter was detained in town on Saturday
and only got home just before dinner.
It was a curious meal. Miss Stooker,
after talking and playing music all the
afternoon with me, suddenly developed
into a full-blown Philistine, and the
conversation at dinner took the form of
a duologue between her and Peter on
golf and county cricket, on both of
which subjects she seems to be an
enthusiast and an expert. If it had
been base-ball, which I believe is the
American game, I could have understood
it better, but whenever I tried to get
her to talk about her native country she
was uncommunicative and evasive. At
last I couldn't help saying, “I’m aſraid
you're not a very loyal American,” on
which Peter calmly said, “No wonder,
considering she's never been in the
States.” “Oh, Peter,” exclaimed Miss
Stooker, “you needn't have given me
away so soon.”
Then of course it all had to come
out. Miss Miriam Stooker is the alias

[AUGUST 2, 1911.
of Peter's cousin, Margaret Vivian, the
female Admirable Crichton, of whom I
had heard so much in former years,
but had never seen her. She played
cricket better than her brothers, went
up to Girton with a scholarship, took a
first in History, and then went off to
Germany to study music. But why
was it necessary to introduce her to me
in the guise of an American authoress
and under an assumed name 2
practical jokes, and. this seems to me
one of the most unnecessary hoaxes I
ever heard of. However, Peter made
a clean breast of it after his cousin had
gone to bed. He is trying in many
ways, but at least no one can accuse
him of a lack of candour, an i on this
occasion he quite surpassed himself.
“My dear Delicia,” he began, “you
are an attractive and engaging young
erson, and I don't in the least repent
'having married you. You have good
looks, style and inte ligence. But since
the fatal day when that blithering
fellow in The Magnet told you that you
had creative genius and that it was
your duty to cultivate the divine im-
pulse you have threatened to develop
into a prig and a bore. Your verses
are passable, but I have calculated
that they cost me exactly 5s, a line.”
I reminded Peter with dignity that
MILTON only received £5 for Paradºse
Lost, but he was ungenerous enough to
retort that at least MILTON was not out
of pocket on the transaction. He then
went on to disparage my music and to
criticise my theories of education, and
wound up by saying: “The fact is
you're not a woman of genius, other-
wise I should never have dared to
marry you. You're something much
better, if you only would leave your
mind alone. And the only way I could
devise of converting you to my mode of
.hinking was to bring you up against
the genuine article and let you see the
difference. If I had asked Margaret
here in the ordinary way you would
have paid no attention to her. So I
induced her to come as an admirer
of your poetry, and just let things
work themselves out. The result, so
far as I can gather, has been excellent.
You admit that you can't compete
with Margaret, and the admission
does credit to your sanity, as she is
an invincible person.”
Thus ended the longest speech I
ever heard Peter make. I was in-
expressibly wounded by his tone, but
the worst of all was that most of what
he said was true. So with an immense
effort of self-restraint I said nothing.
Visions of the dénouement of The Doll's
House floated through my brain in the
night, but next day it was Margaret

My music I had already abandoned,
but there remained my poetry. Yet

I snatched them up one aſter
the other, and hastily scanned their
pages, fearing I knew not what.

length, “unless it's these portraits of

“Don’t you see, you ass?” he said.
“Read the writing. ‘The Hon.

what makes me so wild. Why must I

But I've got them this time,” he went
on, cooling down a little. “When I

At that moment his man came in
with the new Twaddler, hot from the

I looked over Reginald's shoulder as
he turned the pages with trembling

Plainly enough to me, that is ; for the
photographer had unfortunately failed
to interpret it correctly, and below was
the legend :
“Evidently a backer of Bracted.”
Reginald flung down the paper and
kicked a footstool savagely, and I
decided it would be more tactful to
leave him with his trouble.
At the door curiosity overcame dis-
cretion, however.
“Did you back Braxted 2 " I asked.

lintel a quarter of an inch above my
head, and I closed the door hastily.
Evidently he had not.

“ANOTHER prodigious success was

Circassian dancers at Covent Garden.
Nothing more beautiful—nothing so
beautiful, one may boldly assert—can
ever have been seen on any stage since
the world began. “Mirza Schaffy' is
the name of this soul-shaking ballet, in
which all the splendours of the Georgian
imagination are condensed in one short
hour of delirious ecstasy. The scene,
which is laid in the palace of
Semangellina, the Empress of Tiflis,
is a stupendous harmony of opalescent
hues, and the action passes on the roof
garden of a Caucasian Temple, honey-
combed with oubliettes. Semangellina,
who is in love with her Prime Minister,
Prince Mirza Schaffy, resolves to test
his devotion by ordering all the members
of his family to immolate themselves by orchestration.

and an appalling scene of carnage and
horror ensues. Gigantic soldiers with
enormous scimitars slay right and left,
heads are mown off by scores, and the
shrieks of the decapitated victims are
echoed in the highest registers of the
piccolos and oboes. The enormous
effect of the scene proves to absolute
demonstration that the ballet is to be
ranked with the highest emanations
of any other art, glyptic, pictorial or
dramatic. But the chief aesthetic
significance of the spectacle is to be
found in the marvellous persuasive-
ness of the orchestra. An ancient poet
taught us that music has power to
soothe the savage breast. It has been
reserved for the genius of Bobolinsky-
Kluchnikoff to prove that the most

HINTS TO TRAVELLERS.
If you must be a traveller, be a
bond-fide traveller. It will come in
useful, you will find, on thirsty Sun-
days.
All roads lead to Rome. This, how-
ever, does not apply to railroads.
Margate, therefore, is still open for
consideration as a possible holiday
resort.
Margate is not the only Queen of
Watering Places. There are two hun-
dred and thirty-one other queens. If
you cannot make up your mind as to
which you prefer, leave it to the Book-
ing Clerk. He w ll submit a list of
names and, while you are thinking the
matter out, the people behind you will
keep up the flow of conversation.
Having sufficiently stirred the Book-
ing Clerk from his state of apathy,
turn your attention to the porters.
But wariness is essential with these, as
they are not kept in cages.
When you have selected your car-
riage and sat in it, no one else has a
right to get in without your permission.
Let your expression of greeting to in-
truders leave no doubt as to this.
It is your prerogative to have a
carriage to yourself, Though you can-
not sit in ten seats at once, the fact of
other people sitting in them is an
insult to you and to be resented as
such.
The safest place in the carriage, in
case of accidents, is on the rack. This
is provided primarily for light articles.
You may be light, but cannot, unless I
am mistaken in you, be an article.
For the convenience of the Company
and your own comfort, it is advisable
only to resort to the rack when there
is going to be an accident.
lf a fellow-passenger starts offering
you papers, you might as well accept
the first and save yourself trouble. He
will make you read something before
he has done with you.
Avoid friendships with guards. They
cost a shilling a time. Also, any com-
munications you desire to make to the
driver should not be made by cord.
This is even more expensive.
| Do not throw bottles out on to the
line. Keep them, during your journey,
in the pockets in which you habitually
carry them. -
I once had the privilege of travelling
in the same carriage with a honeymoon
couple of the working class. With his
let hand the bridegroom held the right
hand of the bride. With his right he
held the humorous paper he was
reading at the time. His idea was, I
think, to combine business and
pleasure.
When you go on your honeymoon,
you will have not only to travel first-
class, but also to buy two first-class
tickets for the purpose. Knowing you
as I do, I shall be heartily amused if
a third-class ticket-holder insists on
travelling in your carriage.
The worst part of quarrelling with
a railway company is the feeling that
the Company is never upset about it.
I have written to my own pet company
no fewer than five times to tell it that
I am surprised at it, and still it goes on.
Return tickets are available for six
months, a fact to be pointed out, with
significant emphasis, to your hostess
on arrival.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Exth Acted FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, July 24.
—Since the free fight on floor of House
that disgraced the Session of 1893,
equalled the tumult
that filled the Chamber this after-
noon. Nearest approach was when
Liberals expected PRINCE ARTHUR,
then Premier, personally to define his
views on current stage of Tariff Reform
question and with modesty habitually
predominant in connection with this
question he put up ALFRED LYTTELTON
in his place. A mere squib compared
with to-night's explosion.
That the outbreak was organised
was obvious, is indeed not denied.
Questions disposed of, Clerk read out
First Order of Day. “Parliament Bill:
, Consideration of Lords' Amendments.”
PREMIER rose amid storm of cheering
from his supporters. Taking up sheet
of manuscript, placed on brass-bound
box as he entered, he smoothed it out
and, the cheers subsiding, began his
speech. Instantly uprose from group
behind Front Opposition Bench, on
which PRINCE ARTHUR lolled with
languorous air, cries of “Traitor

benches below Gangway. Cousin
HUGH in corner seat, pale to the lips,
with blazing eyes and frail form shaken
by tempestuous passion, led the rally.

one. At last, with angry gesture, the
PREMIER rolled up his manuscript and,
facing round to his supporters, protested,
“I am not going to degrade myself by
further endeavouring to press argu-
ments on people who are evidently
resolved not to listen.”
A fresh burst of cheering followed,
Ministerialists leaping to their feet and
waving hats and handkerchiefs.
“The question is,” said the SPEAKER,
“that the Lords' Amendments be now
considered.”
Promptly PRINCE ARTHUR rose,
greeted by hearty cheers from excited
throng to leſt of Chair. In ordinary
familiar course of events now would
have been the turn of the Ministerialists.
Their chieftain had been howled down.
In accordance with old practice they
would give LEADER OF OPPosition a
turn.
There came into operation pretty
little action illustrative of the chivalry
native to the House in its maddest
moments. The PREMIER, foreseeing
what would happen when PRINCE
ARTHUR took the floor, had privily
despatched the MASTER of ELIBANK
with injunction to his men to refrain
from reprisals. For some minutes
ELIBANK was seen fluttering round,
dove-like, with olive leaf in his beak.
Effect marvellous. PRINCE ARTHUR
was listened to in silence, an unex-
pected reception he gratefully acknow-
ledged.
But there were limits to fo bearance.
When F. E. SMITH proposed to follow,
storm broke forth again, not subsiding
till, at the end of five minutes, he
gave in and resumed his seat, having
uttered no other audible phrase than
“Mr. Speaker—”
Proceedings brought to abrupt end.
The SPEAKER, acting under new
Standing Order provided to meet
cases of grave disorder, adjourned the
House without Question put.
“Familiar with the petition, ‘Save
me from my friends,’” said SARR as
we walked off together, “one might
be inclined in cases such as this to
cry aloud, ‘Commend me to my
enemies.' If the young lions in the
Opposition den had been suborned by
Asquith to get up this afternoon's
performance they could not have more
effectively earned their wage. It will
not only strengthen the bonds between
himself and his followers in the House
and through the country, it w ll
grievously damage the already stricken
cause of the Peers. If these be the
champions of that venerable institution,
these the exponents of the principle
of Law and Order, that shrewd person
the Man in the Street will be inclined
to say he is not taking any."
opposite.
Business done.—None.
Tuesday.—Seemed when SPEAKER
took Chair this afternoon that House,
naturally shamefaced in remembrance
of yesterday's proceedings, had relapsed
into old humdrum manner. Benches
only half filled. Questions on paper
devoid of interest. Appearances how-
ever not for first time illusory. BIRRELL,
rattling through answer of one of string
of Irish questions, was suddenly inter-
ruptel by ringing cheer that rose and
swelled with gathering force. Turning
sharply round he perceived PREMIER
entering from behind the SPEAKER's
Chair.
---
DoN'T KE11: HARDIE and the latest Socialist
modes for Merthyr Tydfil.
Possibly Ministerialists might have
been satisfied with this significant
welcome had it not been for Cousin
Hugh. PRIME MINISTER sharply re-
torted to enquiry of RUPERT Gwyn NE,
“I refuse to answer insolent questions.”
This naturally shocked Cousin Hugh's
severe idea of dºcencies of debate.
Rising to call the SPEAKER's attention
to the bad language he was greeted
by howl of execration from benches
For some minutes he stood
facing the music. When he attempted
to speak there broke forth the cry
which he himself yesterday employed
to discomfiture of PRIME MINISTER.
“May I ask ” he shouted.
“"Wide, 'vide, 'videl ” roared the
Ministerialists.
In a rough-and-tumble scrimmage
Cousin Hugh does not seem to promise
much. But his courage is indomitable.
Thrice , he interposed, calling down
upon his head a fresh storm of angry
interruption. Incidentally BIRRELL
continued to read out answers to the
questions addressed to him on the
paper. Cousin HUGH rising to give
voice to a fresh thought personal to
the PREMIER, uproar broke out again
and the CHIEF SECRETARY was fain to
stand silent at the Table.
A more genial episode was appear-
ance on scene of Don't KEIR HARDIE.
Either by happy accident or by acute
prevision he had for this occasion
possessed himself of a reach-me-down
uit of white flannels, a touch of many
colours being added by a gorgeous
cummerbund. Whilst the row was
in progress he, after manner of limited
supply of supers on transpontine stage,
trotted in and out. However high
angry passion might have risen, as
soon as Members caught sight of the
white suit and the coy cummerbund,
they burst into hilarious shout of
laughter and ironical cheering.
Then Cousin HUGH took another
turn. A wild roar greeted him. It
seemed as if we were coming to fisti-
cuffs as in 1893, when from under the
glass door leading from the Lobby there
flashed a gleam of white with indication
of a streak of rainbow. It was DoN'T
KEIR HARDIE and his cummerbund
buck again. Once more angry passion
changed to burst of genuine merriment.
In the end the SPEAKER put down
Cousin HUGH with sharp reproof and,
the House getting into Committee of
Supply, the excited multitude broke up
and disappeared.

A GLOSSARY OF POLITICAL TERMS.
- (For Use in a Crisis.)
LAST DITCH.-A receptacle for poor thinking and high
falutin. Favourite death-place for advanced politicians
who do not intend to die—at least, not there—and who, as
a matter of fact, always survive misfortunes which have
made strange ditch-fellows.
No SURRENDER.—An expression much used by those who
attempt to disguise a defeat by congratulating one another on
their indomitable courage and to reveal their love for their
leader by disregarding his advice and attempting to shatter
his authority. After which they surrender with the rest.
CECIL-(1) A place where Dukes and Smiths combine
to banquet a former creator of judges who is not to be
satisfied without a creation of Peers.
(2) A gentleman from Oxford University, noted for the
amenity of his manners and the suavity of his language.
An expert in the organisation of impromptu anger. Hold-
ing that silence is golden, he has shrieked down a Prime
Minister and reduced a Speaker to impotence. Conscious,
as he is, of his merits, he esteems lightly and denounces
shrilly those who fail to share his exalted estimate of his
own immaculate perfection.
CAD.—Term supposed by those who bravely use it under
cover of uproar to be vividly descriptive of an English
gentleman who happens to be Prime Minister.
TRAITOR.—A genial word conveying political disagree-
ment. Has been howled out by many whose language (like
the raven's .."). little meaning, little relevancy, bore.”
... The House of LoRDs.—(1) The last rampart of British
liberty. (2) An effete assembly of arrogant people-crushers
combined together for the destruction of freedom and
capable of being checked and cured only by the duplication
of their number.
“It was a red herring,” said the Borough Councillor,
“and now it has come home to roost.”
ANOTHER BOOK THAT HAS HELPED.
WHEN editors my proffered poems scorn
(Always, of course, regretfully polite),
And lack of luck is moving me to mourn
The homing instincts of the things I write,
'Tis then that in my agony I look
For consolation to my favourite book.
KEATs cannot cure my tendency to mope,
Nor SHELLEY dissipate my anxious frown;
I cannot find resuscitated hope
In either of the Swans of Stratford town;

Of ballads (with the H's “not at home").
No! It is lettered in a golden tint
“The Works of Self,” and folio number one
Displays my verses which appeared in print
Last summer in The Little Sapleigh Sun.

Embodied in that jocund little fytte.

Once more I feel assured that now and then

With snappy pars about the Upper Ten;
And so return the volume to its shelf
With renovated confidence in Self.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BLANCHE'S LETTERS,
A BACKward GLANCE.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-Among the tra-
gediettas of the season now in extremis
has been the social suicide of Mrs.
Jimmy Sharpe. She's been in a long
time, but she's out again now, and
may knock and ring for the rest of her
life without finding anyone to open the
door.
She was a good bit of an outsider
when the Flummerys first mether some-
where abroad, conceived a violent fancy
for her, after their fashion, and took her
up. Once taken up, she did the rest
herself, and in a short time one met
her everywhere that was anywhere.
She got a big reputation as a funny
woman and teller of risqué stories, and
was in great request at dinners and
suppers and country-house parties. I
never thought her particularly witty—
and Ray Rimington, who's by way of
being a bel esprit himself, says in his
opinion a woman has no more business
to be a wit than to have a beard or a
deep voice / However that may be,
Mrs. Jimmy, finding lately that her
wit was petering out and her stock of
risqué stories was running low (Norty
says they generally did run low !), has
taken to practical joking (the dernière
ressource of a played-out wit), and has
now made her last joke, practical or
otherwise, in our world.
This was how it happened. This
summer the Dunstables have had a
series of week-end parties at their place
near Richmond, Riverside Court. I
never could stand the Dunstables. The
two old people are awful, the girls
are tombstones, and young Luton is a
prig of the first magnitude. They
belong to the set dubbed by nous autres
The Deadly-Dulls—fearful creatures,
among whom are current such phrases
as “the duties of our station "-" the
proper bringing-up of children”—“the
pleasures of domestic life,” and so on—
and the week-end parties at Riverside
Court have been of the hopelessly
stodgy sort described by that wonderful
old mid-Victorian word, respectable.
To one of these week-end parties,
however, in order, I suppose, to leaven
the lump of respectability a little, they
invited Mrs. Jimmy Sharpe, it being
understood, of course, that no risqué
stories would be tolerated, that she was
to be, as SHAKSPEARE says, as amusing
as the serpent but as harmless as the
dove. A few days before going she was
at a little supper at the Gardenia Club
and had a wager with Giddy Tremayne
(he's a relative of the Dunstables and
a shaking of the head among them),
that she would disappoint the old
Duchess of six of her expected guests
(whom she, Mrs. Jimmy, happened to
have heard of as being in the same week-
end party), six female leaders of the
Deadly-Dulls—six pillars of propriety
—six monuments of all the domestic
virtues—and would do it by means of
the following anonymous letter, drawn
up at the supper table amid yells of
laughter:—“A Friend counsels you not
to go to Riverside Court this week-end.
He will be there, and danger is in the
air.”
The wager was for a cool thousand—
evens. The six letters were sent. On
Saturday Mrs. Jimmy went to Riverside
Court, and Giddy, with the privi-
lege of relationship, went uninvited “to
see fair.” Three of the six leaders of
the Deadly-Dulls and pillars of pro-
priety weighed in all right and seemed
to have nothing on their minds, but at
dinner the old Duchess said, “Influenza
seems to be coming out of its season.
Poor dear So-and-so and So-and-so "
(naming two of the absent leaders of
the D-D.’s) “write to excuse themselves
on the score of terrible colds, and dear
So-and-so" (naming the third absentee
—I don't write their names, leaving
you to guess them, my dearest) “has
been suddenly summoned to Scotland
by the illness of an aunt.” Mrs.
Jimmy and Giddy, no doubt, exchanged
eloquent looks across the table, and
next day they were stupid enough to
have a dispute about how the wager
should be settled, on the lawn—a dis-
pute overheard by someone in an
arbour they hadn't noticed—and, hey
presto! the fat was in the fire in no
time, and now Mrs. Jimmy's outside
for ever. She quite deserves it. A
snake in the grass, hitting below the
belt in that way, is a danger to us all.
All the maharajahs who came over to
coronate were darlings (they made such
lovely bits of colour at one's parties!),
but the darlingest of them all was the
Ghezam of Pondypore, who has become
a great friend of mine. I simply love
his grave, gentle, graceful way, with
just a teeny-weeny soupçon of the
Bengal tiger somewhere in the offing.
I talked to him about TAMERLANE, and
the Rig Vedas, and the Koran, and
Buddhism and Brahmanism and all
that sort of thing, and I'm sure he was
immensely astonished at my knowledge
of his country. Josiah was as rude to
him as he dared to be, and always
spoke of him to me as “that darkie ' "
When the dear Ghezam left London
he sent me a red rose, and a card to

the first time I wore it (as a corsage

Pondypore as his guest for the Durbar,
and of course I'm going. “You’re not
going,” said Josiah yesterday. “I
certainly am going,” I replied. “I’ve
promised Balaji.” “Who's Balaji,
pray?” he demanded, quite glaring
at me. “Well, the Ghezam, then,”
I said. “Now look here, Blanche,”
he said, “I don't often put my foot
down, but I put it down now. ... I
won't have you cavorting about India
with this darkie that you call the
Ghezam. Mind I won't l” “Your
point of view is just as narrow and as
wrong as it can be,” I told him calmly.
“Why don't you try to think imperially?
Can't you see what profound policy it
is, how good for our Indian Empire,
that we Englishwomen should have
an influence for good over the native
princes?” “Stuffannonsense!” he
cried. (That's an expression I’ve never
been able to break him of, and he pro-
nounces it as spelt above.) “If you
want to see the Durbar, you shall see
it, but without any Ghezams. We'll
go together.”
We shall see. I've not the least
intention of disappointing the Ghezam.
Beryl Clarges has set a new fashion
in head ornaments, which she says
she'll make even more popular than
ospreys. She has imported a lot of
live humming-birds to match different
gowns. A slender gold chain attaches
them by one leg to a jewelled head-
band, and they flutter about over the
head in a simply sweet manner. Of
course they don't live more than a few
hours, but she has a fresh set for the
next night. Those dreadful people of
the Society for Interfering with Every-
body are always after her, threatening
proceedings, but Beryl's only answer to
them is to add more humming-birds to
her coiffure!

Oh, my dearest, just a little story
about Sir Croesus Lucre. He came of
age, you know, a year or two ago, and
has undergone absolute torments, poor
boy, from being the parti of the moment.
Lately he's sold off all his horses, his
motors, and even his yacht, and has
gone in entirely for flying, which he has
taken up avec fureur. “You seem
awfully stuck on 'planing, old boy,”
Norty said to him the other day. “I
ain't stuck on it,” was the rueful answer.
“I loathe it—and it's spoilin’ my
digestion—but it's the only way of
escape from—from-them, you know!”
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
THE DESERT OPTIMIST.
AN exile, I would fain forget
That circumstance hath put me down |
Quite close to places like Tibet,
But very far from London town.
And though the outlook's rather drear
I sometimes fancy I detect
A sort of Cockney atmosphere,
A Metropolitan effect.
Behind my chair in solemn state
The bearer and khansama stand,
Swart replicas of those who wait
In Piccadilly or the Strand.
My punkah brings a grateful wind
To cheeks climatically brown'd,
A fitful gust that calls to mind
The draughts about the Underground.
And though they spoil my morning rest
I like to lie awake and hark
To parrakeets whose notes suggest
Their captive kin in Regent's Park.
About my house the pigeons roost,
They perch upon the compoundwalls,
Own brothers to the friends who used.
To flap me greeting from St. Paul's.
In yellow waves the dawn-mist drives
Across the paddy-field and jogs
The memory of one who strives
To reconstruct his London fogs.
And when H hear a bullock-cart
Go rumbling 'neath its harvest truss
The echo wakens in my heart
The music of the omnibus.
And thus it is I’ve learned to find
A remedy for things that irk;
My desert fades and with a kind
Of cinematographic jerk—
“Urbs errat ante oculos; ”
Then, Fortune, send me where you list,
I care not, London holds me close,
An exile, yet an optimist.

I MET him in the Tube. The move-

and his bag of tools hit me. He
damned the line, apologised to me, and
we began to talk.
In response to my question he said
he was full of work. Couldn't com-
plain.
“Yes,” he amplified, “we’re wonder-
ful busy this year. It's a record, that's
what it is. First the Coronation; then
the heat; and now all these strengthen-
ing jobs—fortifying, or whatever you
call it.”
“Fortifying?” I inquired.
“Yes,” he replied. “Buttressing
walls and all that sort of thing. We're
being sent for all over the place to do
that. Sometimes it's a ceiling that's
given way; sometimes a floor with a
hole in it; but often enough it 's the
very house. In Kensington chiefly,
and Bayswater; but other parts, too.
We're at it all the time. It's a nepi-
demic, that's what it is.”
“But,” I said, “surely this is very
odd. I can understand measles and
influenza and things like that being
epidemic; but how can houses in
different parts of London all begin
suddenly to go wrong at the same time 2
That's surely very puzzling. What is
our theory 2"
“Well,” he said, “I don't know much
about these things, but they tell me
it's Nijinsky.”
“Nijinsky?"
“Yes, the Russian Dancer at Coving
Garden. He's that nippy, they tell me,
there was never anything like it. He
jumps into the air, they tell me, and
doesn't come down for a couple of
blooming minutes. And all these
Kensington and Bayswater people are
trying to do the same. That's what I
understand it is. I'm told that on
still nights you can hear 'em crashing
about in all directions. Dessay he
comes down a bit lighter. But of course
I haven't seen this Nijinsky myself.
It's not in my line exactly. The
O'Gorman Brothers is what I fancy—
good step-dancers with double heels.
All the same, “Long life to Nijinsky' is
what I says. It's good enough for
me to mend the damage he causes.
That's where me and my mates come

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ON the outside wrapper of The Gift of the Gods (HEINE-
MANN) the publishers have been at pains to inform me in
large print that it is a NEw novel by the author of On the
Face of the Waters. Well, speaking personally, and as a
reader to whom the previous work and the literary repu-
tation of Mrs. FLORA ANNIE STEEL are things of moment,
I should call the present volume not only a new novel, but
a new and disconcerting experiment in style on the part of
a writer from whom something very different is justly
expected. I may be to blame, but certainly I myself could
find in this ordinary and not very interesting tale of some
dull people in the Outer Hebrides no trace of that dis-
tinction and charm for which Mrs. STEEL has before this
made me her very grateful debtor. When, moreover, what I
English country life is provided by his cousin, a flashy
beauty from West Kensington, whose hard eyes had
marked him as her legitimate prey. Both she and her
fat and flabby mother are drawn with particular skill. I
cannot say that the story grips me so much, for instance,
as Peter's Mother. My pulse did not gallop nor my
heart throb as I read it. But I liked it because the
people in it are real and talk the language of life and not
of fiction.
What gave for me some added interest to The Sovereign
Power (MACMILLAN) was the thought that, a few years ago,
it would have been regarded as a romance of the fantastically
impossible type.
for boys to delight in ; or, a little later and with rather
more finesse, our own H. G. WELLs might have imagined
the concluding chapters. Briefly, it is a novel of avia-
tion that Mr. MARK LEE LUTHER has composed, in a

ordinary decencies of proof
reading, I felt that some
expostulation was called
for. The story itself is
of one Margaret Mac-
donald, a widow whose
husband, the laird of
Westray, in the Islands,
meets his death early in
the book after a mysteri-
ous fashion that is never
properly cleared up.
Macdonald went over the
cliff, one foggy night, to

supposed wreck, and was
never seen again; while

helpers pulled up at the

confessed, are anything
but original. The Ameri-

ever, flight in an aero-

and nothing could well
be more thrilling, or, to
become Margaret's lover
and the hero of as much
tale as the book contains.
Its only real attraction
lies in its portrayal of village life in these unfamiliar parts;
there is atmosphere here, but not enough else to save
Mrs. STEEL's admirers from a sad disappointment.
Master Christopher (SMITH, ELDER)—you can see the
old nurse in the background—is what lady society-
journalists would call a “boy and girl” party. The too-
old-at-forty characters in it count about as much as they
do in an up-to-date newspaper office or a fashionable ball-
room... And, as I always love Mrs. HENRY DE LA PASTURE's
mother-heroines, I feel a little aggrieved that in this book
she kills off the one really charming specimen before the
story proper begins. But the young people play quite a pretty
comedy of love (with, in one case, a pathetic ending) in the
fine old house which Christopher's plebeian father had bought
with trade-won gold from its ancestral owner when he joined
the other pigeons that flutter round the Stock Exchange.
Christopher himself you will find a bit of a boor, but a good
sort for all that; and his young sister, in a dove-like kind
of way, is as lovable as I imagine their dead mother must
have been. The exciting element in this little drama of

THE “GRAND GARDEN FéTE ".
THE Parish began it and the Vicar was very active in it.
The Parish had decided that it couldn't do without a
Church-Room. Other Parishes had Church-Rooms where
the Parishioners could be improved by lectures, addresses,
concerts, parish meetings, debates and so forth, and it
was obviously absurd that our own Parish should continue
in a position of inferiority through not having a Room. A
Room was therefore built, and a very handsome convenient
Room it was, but—there was a debt on it. Indeed, no
self-respecting Church-Room has ever started in life with-
out a debt; and this particular debt, though it troubled the
Vicar, was not a very heavy one. Church-Rooms must
have debts; debts must be paid off; and a “Grand Garden
Fête" must be held in order that the debt may be, at
least, diminished. So it came about that a Grand Garden
Fête was actually organised and held.
I cannot offer to describe it in every detail. It was too
varied, too vivid, and too exciting for that. The ladies of
the neighbourhood turned themselves into saleswomen. A
stern business determination gleamed out of their eyes;
you could see by the way in which their lips moved that
they knew exactly how many pennies there were in a half-
crown or a pound, and that they were not to be deceived
in a question of small change. The greengrocery stall
glittered with tomatoes tastefully arranged in punnets by a
Justice of the Peace. Peaches and nectarines languished
delicately against a background of dark and glowing grapes,
the direct descendants of those that came as specimens
from the land of milk and honey. Gigantic melons,
bloated with self-importance and succulence, lay about like
ammunition designed for a Dreadnought. Nor was the
humble potato absent, and the lowly lettuce, the beet and
the carrot. It was a gorgeous stall, fruitful in more senses
than one.
Cheek by jowl, or, rather, trestle by plank, with the fruit-
stall was the sweet-and-chocolate stall. Sweets more
brilliantly parti-coloured I never saw, nor have I ever
tasted better chocolates. The little silk bags alone were
worth the money. Here swarms of children became bank-
rupt and sticky, shading their innocent chins heavily with
chocolate. In the morning lollipops in thousands lay
below. We forgot to count them at break of day; and
when the sun set where were they 2 Then there was a
needlework stall bedizened with embroidery wrung from
the leisure of the wives and mothers and daughters of the
district. Over the sacred and appreciated mysteries of
this show it does not beseem me to linger, for it was built
up on a foundation of useful articles not suited to the mind
or person of a male. It did a roaring trade. Finally, there
was a stall for cakes and jams, which was swept clean, as
it were in a moment. No jam-desirer on that great day
denied himself his favourite preserve. Gooseberry was
mine. To me the translucent skins are irresistible.
“Walk up ! Walk up ! Walk up! 'Ere.'s yer fine
cocoanuts, juicy cocoanuts! Roll, bowl or pitch | Cocoa-
nuts all juicy!” Where had I heard that raucous, resonant,
East-end voice before ? It came from a gentleman in dark
corduroys and a heavy sweater broadly striped in black
and yellow, a dark-visaged sort of hornet of a man who
was luring spectators to a cocoanoclastic revelry. His sister
was beside him, a splendid lady who bade defiance to the
Sun in a tight thick black velvet bodice and a flaring silk
skirt splendid to behold. Her earrings were in size and
splendour like the verilla of a Roman legion; her hat was

was their gnome in pearlies, and their arms and faces were
brown as the sun or some more artificial agent could tan
them. I rolled, I bowled, I pitched. Cocoanuts shivered
into fragments under my erratic skill. Then in a flash of
recollection I realised that this talented family had laid
aside the glories of its birth and state in the shape of a
cool summer frock and seasonable flannels, and had, for
charity and one afternoon, put on the accent, the earrings,
the velvet, the corduroys, and the colours of the immemorial
East.
.
In the meantime Aunt Sally, too, was bearing up under
a succession of shattering blows, while the general com-
pany were absorbing ices with a wild abandon or indulging
madly in lemonade. The sun was blazing down, but it did
| not daunt the “Anglo-Roman Band” who, with their
stringed instruments, made cool and pleasant music in a
shady nook. They came from a neighbouring town and
were certainly imperially Anglo in faces, voices and trousers.
No doubt their scarlet tunics provided the Roman element
and justified their name.
Suddenly a voice announced that the children would now
dance some old English dances, and the chairs under the
walnut-tree and the chestnuts became filled with spectators.
On the platform, where the Pierrots were afterwards to
sing, the fiddle and the piano struck a chord, and, lo,
through an archway of roses, there came dashing the
merriest prettiest little company of small Englishmen and
Englishwomen that anyone ever set eyes on. Sixteen of
them there were, divided into two sets: the big little ones
ranging from ten to twelve years, and the little little ones
from five to eight years. No pen can describe the neatness,
the daintiness, the concinnity and the gaiety of their dances.
Every little foot was duly pointed, every little head was
thrown back, every little roguish face looked archly at its
neighbour. The girls in print dresses and bonnets, the
boys in smocks and felt hats, outvied one another in the
tuneable swaying of their bodies and the swift movement
of their twinkling feet. It was a jolly sight that made
you want to cheer for very delight, while the simplicity and

94 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[AUGUST 9, 1911.
A CRICKET SWEEP.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-You will be doing
me a great service if you will kindly
print my personal explanation and plain
statement of a regrettable incident that
occurred in one of my recent club
matches. If you do so (as in common
humanity you ought), you may perhaps
have the satisfaction of knowing that
you have helped to reinstate me in the
good opinions of those who now wish
me to resign from my cricket club.
The matter is this. We are in the
habit of having a sweep on all the
matches we play. Each member of the
team pays half-a-crown, and there are
two prizes of one pound and seven and-
six for those who draw the first and
second top scorers respectively. The
practice has always provided a little
harmless amusement, and nothing un-
pleasant has ever occurred until the
time of which I speak.
On this occasion, Mr. Punch, I had
done rather well by picking Roger—
who was once reserve man for a
Glamorgan second team. Percy, a
player of about my own calibre, had
picked me, and was rude enough to
express his dissatisfacticn with his luck.
Well, having had a good score
knocked up against us, we somehow
or other went all to pieces. Roger, to
my delight, was the only man to reach
double figures, and he managed to get
twenty before being bowled. I went
in eighth wicket down (my average
position), when we had absolutely no
look in, an I found Percy already in
charge of affairs.
“Now for a sporting effort,” he said,
as I passed him on my way to the
farther wicket. .
eeing there were about fifty runs
to get, I looked on his remark as
sheer rot. Percy, as I've said, is just
about as good as me, and I've hardly
ever been known to make twenty runs
—not all at once, that is. In fact, I
considered the match as good as over
and the yellow piece (thanks to Roger)
as good as mine. The last man in
hardly counted.
You know how it is when you don't
much care if you do get out. As often
as not you stay in. At the end of two
overs Percy and I were still at the
wickets, and I, scoring at double his
rate, had made two runs. It didn't
end there; I only wish it had. We
went on and on, having the most extra-
ordinary luck, till the fatal moment
arrived when I scored my nineteenth
run, and Percy had the bowling.
If I say that by this time, in the
excitement of the match, I'd forgotten
all about the sweep, you won't believe
me, I suppose. Nobody will. Percy
won't, though, as I tell him, I try hard
to believe is of him. Percy had the
bowling, and the next ball went, as 1
supposed, for a bye. I called and ran
down the pitch. Percy also ran, but
looked round (he'd no business to) and
saw first slip get to the ball.
“Go back ' " he cried, as first slip
prepared to throw at the nearest wicket.
It was clear that one of us would be
out, and in that swift moment I realized
that the mistake was mine and that it
was up to me, not Percy, to pay the
penalty. I rushed past Percy just as
the wicket was thrown down—so that
I was the batsman who retired dis-
consolately to the pavilion. Now isn't
that in accordance with the best spirit
of the game, Mr. Punch 2
And what is the upshot? They
declare that I threw away my wicket
in order to obtain first prize in the
sweep; and at the same time cheated
Percy out of it. For, of course, it would
have fallen to him if I had beaten
Roger's score. I have pointed out (1)
that I had forgotten all about the
sweep; (2) that if I had remembered
I hope I should never let private
interest come before public benefit;
(3) that, anyway, my batting average
being what it is (never mind what),
the chances of my getting out increased
horribly with every run I made, from
nought upwards, and (4) that they
pass over the fact that Percy showed
suspicious self-denial in offering him-
self as a sacrifice, so to speak, for my
mistake. . .
But there it is. Percy, I may say,
made twenty-one (the last man keep-
ing up his end), and then, when we
were within five runs of victory, got
bowled. “Anyway,” I heard him say,
“I didn't mean him to get first prize,
even if it meant losing the second
myself.”
Well, what do you think of that?
They are so full of my supposed infamy
that they don't notice his. And so,
Mr. Punch, they are on the point of
compelling me to resign my member-
ship of a club which I have served
faithfully since the days when, as
chairman of the luncheon committee,
I effected the introduction of goose-
berry tart into the weekly luncheon as
a permanent stand-by.
Yours, etc.,
“MISUNDERSTOOD.”

SOCIETY AT THE SEASIDE.
BRIGHTGATE is very full just now.
Several well-known people from Toot-
well and Camberham were out and
about on the front yesterday enjoying
the sunshine and sea breezes. Among
those promenading, Mr. “Herb.” Smith
was prominent in a lounge suit of irre-
proachable cut and a straw hat with
the colours of the Household Brigade,
to which he is temporarily attached for
vacation duties. With him were Miss
Gertie Brown and Miss Mabel Fulley-
love, both well known in the smart set
of Streatling. Miss Brown was attired
in an effective semi-hobble costume
with accessories to match, and Miss
Fulleylove was exquisitely trousered in
brown Harris tweed. It is rumoured—
with I know not what truth—that at
the end of his leave Mr. Herbert Smith
intends to retire from the 2nd Life
Guards and to enter City life.
EASTCLIFF has seldom known such
a gay season, so many of the smartest
folk from Houndschapel and White-
ditch having run down from town
to take advantage of the health-giving
properties of the mud for which South-
cliff is famous, and which is now in
full bearing. The many smart toilettes
on the front give a kaleidoscopic effect,
rivalling that of the automatic ma-
chines, which are again a feature of
the place this year. The winkle stalls
are as well patronised as ever by those
gourmets who know a good whelk or
winkle when they see one;- in fact
there has been such a run on these
favoured comestibles that Mr. Alf.
Pearlies, who is a regular visitor at
this time of the year, and whom I met
on the pier enjoying a very fragrant
morning cigar, informed me that there
is almost a pin famine in the place.
BLACKPoRT.—The many attractions
here have, as usual, drawn enormous
crowds from the towns of the Rival
Roses for a brief holiday blow by the
briny. The shore is the fashionable
morning parade, and in a casual stroll
along the yellow sands one is sure to
meet many well-known faces from
Wigham, Oldburn, Haliford and Brad-
ſax. In the evenings the strains of
the Pink Rochdalian Band have been
drawing everyone to the beautiful
dancing pavilion on the front.
SKEGTHoRFE. — A large scet on of
Society seems to have found its way to
this resort of fashion, from the number
of times that one hears the latest
shibboleth. The phrase most in vogue
with the smartest people just now
is “Bow-wow,” and I heard it most
appropriately used no fewer than 14
times during a short half-hour on the
parade.

AUTHORITIES.
TheRE are only two ways of dealing
with Income Tax authorities—the right
way and the wrong way.
A.—THE WRONG WAY.
(1)
Lilac Lodge, Beechgrove, Hants,
April 5th, 1911.
To Mr. W. P. Smith,
Deputy-Assistant Surveyor of Taxes,
Inland Revenue,
(City 54th A District)
Room 92, Fifth Floor,
Budget Buildings,
13-16 Stamp Street,
London, E.C.
SIR,--I have this morning received
the enclosed demand for Income Tax
£300s. 9d., signed by you, and if it is
not taking up too much of your, no
doubt, valuable (!) time should very
much like to know how such a sum is
arrived at. I may say at once that I
do not intend to pay it; but it would be
interesting to know exactly how far the
incompetence of public officials carries
them in their extortionate and un-
justifiable demands on the public.
Yours truly, A. J. BRowN.
(2)
Lilac Lodge, etc., April 12th, 1911.
To Mr. W. P. Smith, etc., etc.
(H.J. K. 596.)
SIR,-With reference to your letter
of 11th inst., in which you state that I
have apparently misunderstood instruc-
tions as to making a return, I beg to
state that I am as capable of under-
standing plain English as you are,
and I would add that in a matter of
arithmetic I am more capable, as far as
can be judged from your so-called ex-
planation. My return of £699 19s. 11d.,
by the law of the land, entitles me to
the relief for those whose incomes do
not reach £700, and I defy you to deny
it to me. The deductions I have made
to bring it within that figure I say I
have a right to make, and no Mr.
W. P. Smith (!) in the world can
deprive me of that right. It is true
that I have deducted the rent I pay for
my house from my return, as I also use
it for an office, directing circulars, etc.,
for the various societies of which I am a
well-known supporter. And inasmuch
as the income I enjoy comes from
investments made by my late father,
in his capacity as leather trunk manu-
facturer, I have a perfect right to treat
the whole of it as earned income. It
was earned—by my father, a man known
and respected in the City of London,
which, if you take the trouble, you can
find out.
tor, and you will be dealt with as you
deserve.
In conclusion, I would recommend
you to attend evening classes at one
of the various institutions founded to
assist those who suffer from a defective
education. Plain addition and sub-
traction can be learnt even by the most
ignorant, if they set their minds to it.
Yours truly, A. J. B.RowN.
(3)
Lilac Lodge, etc., April 18th, 1911.
To Mr. W. P. Smith, etc., etc.
(H.J.K. 596.)
SIR,-Certainly I have made my re-
turns in the way indicated in my letter
of 12th inst. for the past several years,
and they have never been questioned.
Perhaps you will now kindly send me
in a correct demand note, and I will
forward cheque in accordance there-
with. I cannot spend further valuable
time in corresponding with those who
are patently incompetent to do any
business at all, let alone that of a
public office.
Yours truly,
(4)
Lilac Lodge, etc., April 24th, 1911.
To Mr. W. P. Smith, etc., etc.
(H.J.K. 596.)
SIR,--The impudence of your demand
is positively staggering in its colossal in-
eptitude. Do you really think you are
entitled—a mere “Jack-in-office "—to
deal in that way with a member of the
public, and a well-known and respected
one, such as I humbly claim to be 2 I
enclose cheque for £300s. 9d., which
was your original demand. I have no
patience to go on with the matter, and
would sooner be swindled in this way
than suffer the annoyance of further
correspondence with one so absurdly
unfitted for a position of trust as your-
self. As for your cool demand for
£372 3s. 2d., for arrears of tax, fines
for making false returns, and what not,
I warn you that you are not permitted,
under your office, to insult the taxpayers
by whom you are paid, and I doubt not
grossly over-paid, for the work you are
not capable of doing. If I suffer any
more annoyance from you I shall put
the matter into the hands of my solici-
A. J. B.Rown.
Yours truly, A. J. B.RowN.
(5)
Lilac Lodge, etc., May 15th, 1911.
To Mr. W. P. Smith, etc., etc.
SIR,-Ienclose cheque for £3723s. 2d.
as I am advised by my solicitor that
under the present state of the law I
cannot expect to win a case against the
powerful and oppressive public body
under whose shelter you pursue your
wicked and nefarious career. If it had
been otherwise I should have taken the
case to the House of Lords sooner than
sit down under such barefaced and
dishonest robbery. But you need not
think that I have done with you. I
have requested my wife's relative, Mr.
F. E. Jones, M.P., to ask a question in
the House of Commons relative to
your fitness for the post you occupy,
and it is my earnest hope that as the
result of enquiry you will be dismissed
from that office, as you deserve to be.
Yours truly, A. J. BRowN.
Correspondence ended. Mr. F. E.
Jones, M.P., is not reported to have
asked any question in the House of .
Commons, and Mr. W. P. Smith, still
earns the emoluments of his office and
the confidence of his superiors.

POSE CULTURB.
PROFEssoR SANDHILL begs to inform
the readers of Punch that his salon for
pose-culture is now open at 947A, New
Bond Street.
In these days of illustrated papers
and vest-pocket cameras, pose-culture
is necessary to the peace of mind and
good reputation of not only Society
people, but litigants, criminals, pro-
fessional boxers, actresses, heroes in
humble life, politicians, and all who
attain notoriety by romantic and un-
usual means. -
The picture of the Duchess of X.
climbing on to her drag at Lord's,
which went the rounds a short time
ago, showed at a glance the imperative
need for pose-culture. Good people
cannot learn too soon that, after all, it
matters less what you are than how
wou look. -
One of the most deplorable results of
the photographic illustrations of our
daily Press is the injury done to the
favourite pastimes of Society. Already
the impromptu gymkhana has become
a daring enterprise in the most secluded
of country houses, while those charming
little chimney-pot parties that have
béen so popular this season are threat-
ened with extinction because of the
grotesque pictorial results that have
attended them.
Professor Sandhill's teaching is
this: “So pose from moment to
tuition, whether it be participating in
a tug-of-war or attending your own
marriage ceremony, it will be impossible
for you to do it in a manner unfit to
moment that you need not fear the print in any paper in the land.

from which may be uttered the proud
defiance: “They print 2 What print
they? Let them print' "
Professor Sandhill's staff includes
some of the most cruel operators and
cameras that were ever engaged in
the service of the London Press.
Within five minutes of your entrance
into his salon you will be shown a
picture of yourself paying the taxi-
driver that will make you ask to begin
his fifty-guinea course of pose-culture
at once. But after the course you
will be able to defy the whole staff and
equipment at their worst, emerging
graceful and picturesque from their
most malevolent endeavours. What-
ever you may do after the Professor's
In view of the approach of the
Twelfth, Professor Sandhill invites
immediate enquiries. No case is
hopeless.
Reuter states that Herr SILVESTER,
President of the Lower House of the
Austrian Reichsrath, has proposed that
“Austria-Hungary, Italy and France
should unite in breaking the power of
Great Britain, who was constantly
interfering in matters all over the
world. He was convinced that this
new theory would not be welcome in
Great Britain.”
On the contrary, Mr. Punch, at any
rate, always extends a hearty welcome
to the best examples of Continental
humour.

HEAT WAVE INTERVIEWS.
WE are, thanks to the courtesy of
the Editor of The Review of Reviews,
in a position to place before our readels
some interesting extracts from an in-
terview with Lord Kitch ENER which
will appear in the next number of that
veracious publication. The interview, it
appears, took place in the Paddington
Swimming Baths on July 22nd, the
hottest day of the year, where the
Editor happened to occupy a box next
to that of Lord IX1tchen ER.
“Other soldiers,” began Lord
KITCHENER, “have based their claim
to remembrance on carnage. I wish
my name to be associated with gentle-
ness, urbanity and suavity. Hence my
first action on landing in Egypt will
be to disband the Egyptian army,
to dismiss all British officials, and
in a word to govern Egypt by the
people for the people. Some persons
for some unaccountable reason have
chosen to identify me with a policy
of blood and iron. They will, I
hope, soon learn to recognise their
blunder and see that my great
aim is to inaugurate a régime of
milk and golden syrup. . You
ask what I propose to do with the
Canal? In the first place I propose
to entrust its control entirely and
absolutely to the Nationalist Egyp-
tians, to whom of course the shares
purchased by Lord BEACONSFIELD
will be surrendered. The name Tel-
el-Kebir is to be removed from the
map, and any Englishman mentioning
it in public will be fined £5 the first
and £50 the second time. The English
tongue and the British flag will
both disappear from Egypt. The
Copts will be decopitated. There will
be a municipal circus at which the
Mameluke's Leap will be repeated twice
daily. I have already got the consent
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals to the necessary
expenditure of horseflesh. Then there
is the question of costume, to which I
attach the greatest possible importance.
With the assistance of Dr. BUDGE and
other eminent Egyptologists I have
designed a uniform for myself which
is simply pyramidal in its antique
grandeur. It involves a bºard d la
RAMESEs II., which CLARK soN has
executed, and it may be rather trying in
this hot weather, but still the sacrifice
is worth making; and, entre mous, I
can tell you that it suits me very well.
Next we come to finance, which, as
you know, has always been my strong
point. I have discovered that the sudd
in the Nile, if subjected to strong com-
pression, makes an excellent substitute
for soap, and I propose to establish
Government factories at suitable spots,
the profits from which will be devoted
to supplying the ſellaheen with the
amenities of life. One fellah, one
camel, shall be my minimum. Another
scheme of mine is to restore Cleopatra's
Needle to Egypt and erect it on the
summit of the Great Pyramid.
Lastly, there is the question of
nomenclature. Learning that my
Christian name, Horatio, from its
association with the hero of the Battle
of the Nile, might awaken painful
memories in the hearts of the Young
Egyptians, I have decided to take in its
place that of “Shashank Amenhotep.”
All these and many other remark-
able details were conveyed by Lord
KITCHENER in an interview lasting
exactly two minutes. It was sub-
sequently dictated by the editor to an
astral typist, and despatched by wire-
less telegraphy to Lhasa to be verified
by the Teshu Lama. In the circum-
stances the absolute authenticity of
the interview can be unhesitatingly
guaranteed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, July 31.
—MARK LockwooD, Colonel, Chairman
of Kitchen Committee, Ruler of our
Roast, neatly enclosed PoinTER in
paper bag and placed him on the grill.
This of course in a Parliamentary
sense. What actually happened was
that Labour Member for Attercliffe
Division of Sheffield is in habit of
keeping himself in the mind of his
to the front of his merry men. We
should have had over again the tragi-
comedy of suspension of twenty-five
Irish Members which enlivened the
Session of 1882. Passion would have
risen to white-heat, whose scorching
effect would have been felt through rest
of the week. SPEAKER contented him-
self with giving Cousin HUGH what
the Curate in The Private Secretary
described as “a good hard knock,” and
when it became evident that the Hugh-
ligans were out for the night he invoked
libel on Mr. Speaker and a gross breach
of the privileges of the House.” Com-
plaining that he had received only five
minutes' notice of the Colonel's intended
attack, he added, “I have not had much
time to think what my action would be
in the event of such a motion being
brought forward.” After a few more
preliminary remarks he unblushingly
produced from breast pocket foolscap
sheet of paper and read carefully pre-
pared statement embodying circum-
scribed apology not quite free from
constituents by writing a
weekly letter published in local
paper. Discoursing on out-
break in Commons last week
he indicted the SPEAKER on
gravest charge that could be
levied against occupant of the
Chair. After describing the
scene he wrote: “Where was
the Speaker? He was there
all right, but to his shame be
it said he utterly failed to curb
the wild spirits of the neurotic
Tories responsible for the
uproar. To fail, of course,
does not necessarily mean dis-
grace; but in this case it does,
because his failure was the
outcome of a violent party
leaning. . . . It was a pitiable
fall. . . . I am sorry to have
to say this of the genial
Speaker, but truth and fairness
demand I should say so.”
The MEMBER For SARK
thinks this outbreak of petulant
unreason, in its way equally
deplorable with the rowdy-
ism it rebuked, might just as
well, even better, have been
left in the obscurity whence it
was dragged. Mr. LowTHER
is one of the few left of the
ancient, honourable political
body who, scorning inodern
modifications, proudly wrote
themselves down Tories.
Nevertheless Members who
have sat through the three

PRIMROSE and representatives
of affronted Liberal constitu-
encies may be thirsting for his

which he appropriately pre-
sides he is increasingly
honoured. Since John MoRLEY
was privileged to sign himself
“Morley of B.” (observe the
ineradicable Radicalism under-
lying the curtailment of full
title in habitual signature)
he was never so much struck
with the topsyturviness of the
world as when to-day his duty
as leader of House of Lords
imposed on him the task of
introducing his old friend
“BOB " REID of House of
Commons days as a belted

of his advance in Peerage
Parliaments over which he has pre-

absolutely free from political feel-

last Monday he behaved with ac-

ness of judgment.
It is quite true that, in stable phrase,
he gave the Hughligans their 'eads.

Captain MoRRIsoN-BELL, late of the
Scots Guards, his helmet now a hire
for bees, has turned his attention to a
problem, settlement of which has long
baffled the skill of man. It is what
HENRY KIMBER, earlier leader of the
Reform crusade, calls “the misrepre-
sentation of the people” consequent
on the unscientific distribution of
parliamentary votes.
By way of bringing out the anomaly
in most striking form the gallant
Captain has constructed a model which,
by the varied height of upright pencil
sticks, shows at a glance the relative
proportion of voters in various constitu-
encies. Looks at first sight like a game
wherein you are expected, standing at
appointed distance, to drop a ring on
a particular stick. Nothing so frivolous.
It is a serious object-lesson in the
almost incredible eccentricities of dis-
tribution of voting power.
Here Romford “lifts its tall head
and like a bully” boasts its electorate
numbering 55,951, while not far off are
Winchester with 3,319 voters, Salisbury
with 3,412, and on the other side of the
Irish Channel Kilkenny with (exclud-
ing the cats) 1,690 electors empowered
to return equally with Romford one
Member to the House of Commons.
To sum up, of our 670 M.P.s one-
half represent 5,414,357 electors, the
other half 2,489,418. The average of
one-half is 16,162 electors per Member,
of the other 7,431. To put it in another
way, of the total electorate of 7,904,465,
one-half send 458 Members to Parlia-
ment, the other 212. And yet, in eyes
of the SPEAKER in the Chair and the
Clerks in the Division Lobby, one
Member is as good as another.
The story is an old one.” MoRRIson-
BELL's ingenious illustration of its
bearings should do something to hasten
reform. . If he would only hire a
waggon, and go about the country

SPINNING OUT THE ICE.
I want to know if any of Mr.
Punch's readers can help me. We
have already learnt the valuable lesson
of preserving foodstuffs by the use of
ice. But how keep the ice? It is a
question of preserving the preserver, so
to speak. I hate waste, and I don't
like to have a thing about the house
that keeps disappearing while you are
not using it. . . . . . .
We live in the country, and at first we
tried getting it by post." That really
was a rotten plan. It was not only
that it, never, arrived, but we had all
sorts of trouble about the other parcels
that came in contact with it, and our
postman got sciatica. Now we get it
from the fishmonger in the village;
but he only lets us have a limited
supply and he insists on delivering it
early-in the day. It wants a good deal
of washing too—there are always a few
scales and things on the outside—and
that still further reduces it.
Now I come to the point. It is
magnificent at lunch, but we cannot
keep it till dinner-time. The trouble
is that the cooling drinks we have at
lunch simply whet our appetite for it
and we both feel that dinner is a mere
farce without it.
I was convinced that I had read
somewhere that it ought to be hung in
a bag, a flannel bag. Things like flan-
nel, that sound hot and frowsy, are
nearly always the coolest, I find,
according to the scientific papers. So
we hung the first lot up in the shade
behind the coal-house and went away
and tried not to think about it. But
when I came back in the evening I
found nothing but a limp flannel rag
with a puddle below it. The sun must
have shifted round, I suppose. Some-
how I hadn't thought of that.
My wife took it over the second day.
She is very ingenious, but, as I tell her,
she has not a really logical mind.
What she did was to pack it all round
the thermometer in the garden. Well,
it brought the temperature down from
over eighty to under forty, and “There
you are ' " she said. But that didn't
stop it from melting. She seemed to
have an erroneous notion that the
thermometer would react on the ice,
which of course it didn't.
The next day, without a word to any-
one, I sought out the coldest room in the
house, which happened to be the nur-
sery bathroom, pulled down the blind,
shut the shutters, and stowed the ice in
the bath. I still think that might have
worked, if Nurse hadn't turned on the
hot tap, for some ridiculous purpose
of her own. I spoke very severely
to Nurse, and I am sorry to say she
denied that there was any ice there.
She said she had found nothing in the
bath but a little floating sawdust.
Then I dug a hole. Allowing for the
state of the weather I consider that it
was a pretty deep hole. Mother Earth,
I told myself, is little affected by
changes of temperature. There I put
the ice, spread out on the bottom with
a cloth over it. I blame the dog for
having spoiled this experiment. He
has a shaggy coat and has been suffer-
|ing a good deal from heat prostration,
and he spent a very happy afternoon
in the hole.
We have got round the difficulty in
a way, but I hope that some of your
readers can tell me a better method.
As it is we are just contriving to catch
up the last retreating fragments by
dining two hours before the usual time.

[AUGUST 9, 1911.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
INKSLINGING PEERS.
GREAT MEETING OF PROTEST.
IN consequence of the correspond-
ence columns of The Times having been
given over to members of the House
of Lords, in which to make their posi-
tions clear, a number of what might
be called the serial letter-writers of the
paper have been crowded out, and,
smarting under this slight, they con-
vened a meeting of protest, under the
chairmanship of Sir HENRY Howorth.
Among those present were Sir HARRY
Pol, AND, K.C., Mr. A. KIPLING CoMMON,
“Senex,” “Justitia,” “Historicus,” Mr.
G. B. SHAw and Sir FREDERICKPOLLOCK.
Sir HENRY Howorth, who was
received with frenzied apathy, said
that he had great respect for peers,
and always should have, provided they
were not of too recent manufacture.
At the same time he could not view
with composure this poaching on his
preserves which had just set in so
acutely. He was accustomed to oc-
cupy every year as nearly as possible
eighty-four columns of The Times—not,
he regretted to say, the largest type,
but of a good readable size none the
less. But since most of the paper had
been set aside for the ventilation of
the opinions, protests and propaganda
of the peers, he, although it is true he
had done a little bit, had had largely
to refrain, with the result that his
figures for 1911 were in danger of
falling from eighty-four columns to
about fifty. (“Shame.") Was this fair
to him? (Cries of “No.") Was this
fair to the readers of The Times 2
(Silence.)
The next speaker was Mr. A.
KIPLING CoMMON, who said that he
was a born letter-writer, his second
name determining his literary career
and his last name giving him an
interest in waste spaces, such as the
Times Co. respondence Columns (“Oh!
Oh!") There were few subjects, he
added, on which he was not ready, at
a moment's notice, to dash off an
epistolary comment; but during the
past few weeks he had had to contend
with so much unlicensed competition,
as he would term it—(Cheers)—that he
had quite lost heart, and a number of
topics on which he would naturally
have had something pertinent to
say had escaped scot free. (Cries of
“Shame!") However, a time would
come. (Shudders.)
At this point a sensational interrup-
tion was caused by the arrival of
“Senex,” who was wheeled up in a
bath-chair. The venerable gentleman,
whose age might be anything from
eighty to a hundred, after being with
some difficulty assisted to his feet by
a valet and a nurse, was understood
to register his protest against the
usurpation of the Correspondence
Columns of The Times by aristocrats
who ought to know better than put
pen to paper; but he was so very
imperfectly heard at the Press table
that it is quite possible, as Sir HARRY
Poſ, AND suggested, that he was merely
applying for his old age pension.
“Paterfamilias” begged to add his
oratorical mite to the meeting. He
had, he said, written during the past
three weeks well-reasoned and necessary
letters to The Times on the following
topics: the lateness of the trains on
one of the principal southern lines; the
overcrowding of omnibuses; the price
of sleeping berths on the P. L. M.; the
inadequacy of the gum on the new
stamps; and the importance of aviators
carrying not only lamps but hooters;
and not one had been inserted, wholly
on account of the capture of the paper
by the articulate nobility. Hitherto he
had voted against Mr. Asquith and his
detestable attack on the Constitution;
but really he could not say what this
new provocation might not lead him to
do. (Applause and cries of “The next
Prime Minister.”)
The entry of Mr. ALGERNoN Ashton
was the signal for the whole concourse
to rise to its feet and sing the “Dead
March in Saul.” Silence having been
restored, the champion epistolarist
explained that nothing but such viola-
tion of the sacred pages of The Times
as was now in progress could have
brought him from his retirement.
(Cheers.) He thought he had long ago
written his last public letter; but when
peers of the realm, who had no call to
enter the lists of correspondence at all,
took to bombarding The Times with
their dreary egotistical screeds—(loud
º felt that he must once
again fill his fountain-pen and show
the world what a letter to the Press
really was. (Cheers, and “For he's
a jolly good fellow !") -
Sir FREDERICK Pollock observed in
plaintive tones that there was no more
pernicious form of the cacoethes
scribendi than that of which they were
the victims. The mixture of blue blood
and black ink was more venomous than
any other fluid. Pens were always
dangerous tools, but in the hands of
peers they became positively murderous.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw observed that
his first impulse had been to join in the
protest, but on second thoughts he
found himself in complete sympathy
with the peers. For one thing nobody
could tell nowadays whether he might
not go to bed a commoner and wake up
a peer of the realm. It was impossible
not to side with an Order to which you
might belong at any moment. Besides,
some of the peers, as always happened
with people who come fresh to a thing,
wrote extraordinarily well and in a most
racy fashion, reminding him of himself
before he was demoralised by the adula-
tion of smart society women and half-
baked socialist undergraduates. With
Lord WILLough BY DE BROKE as Editor
of The Times and Lord NEwton as
chief leader-writer, there might still be
a chance for a threepenny daily.
Sir HARRY Poland said that Mr.
SHAw's fulsome defence of the ink-
slinging peers had filled him with
disgust. For more years than he cared
to remember the words, “I will write
to The Times,” had involved the unex:
pressed corollary, “and The Times will
insert what I write.”. But now the
phrase had lost its virtue. It no
longer held good of the professional ||
letter-writer; it applied only to the
aristocratic amateur.
Times reverted to its old usage, he
was prepared in future to transfer all
his communications to The Daily
Telegraph. (Sensation.) . "
It was ultimately decided, on the
motion of “Scrutator,” seconded by
“An Indignant Parent,” that a depu-
tation should wait on the Editor of
The Times with the view of extracting ||
from him guarantees against any un- |
fair competition on the part of noble
correspondents. The meeting then
broke up singing a new song set to
music by Mr. ALGERNoN ASHTON, of
which the refrain is :
Silence befits but slaves in savage climes;
We ne'er shall cease from writing to
-- The Times. . -
The Allusive Touch.

IN THE PILLORY.
THE Duke of Belvedere sat in his
library. No, he was not ordering the
eviction of a highly respectable tenant
who had been on the estate fifty-nine
years because he had ridden in a Liberal
car to the polling-booth. You see he
was not a Daily News duke. Nor, on
the other hand, was he putting on the
armour of his ancestors (the first Bel-
vedere was a haberdasher and therefore
wore an habergeon) to ride forth and
strike one last brave blow for England,
Empire, Glory and F. E. SMITH. Now
you see that he was not an Observer
duke.
He was sitting reading a newspaper.
We could name the newspaper, only
these editors get so confoundedly arro-
gant. He was not bothering about
the Crisis. He was looking at the
weather forecast and wondering when
there would be a good downfall to
improve his trout-stream.
The butler entered with a telegram.
(To avoid misapprehension one must
state that the butler was not an ancient
family retainer. He had been in the
Duke's service precisely three months
and was under notice to leave for
drunkenness.)
“Another of 'em 2" said the Duke,
without troubling to open it. “If it's
reply paid, Smithers, wire ‘No’ to
whatever they ask. These fellows seem
to think that I've nothing to do but
answer their beastly wires.”
“Yes, your Grace,” replied Smithers.
“And if any more of 'em come answer
what you like, but don't worry me with
the beastly things.”
Now the telegram in question was
from Lord WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE, and
ran: “Will you pledge yourself not to
go into Government Lobby on Veto
Bill?”—and the Duke, who had not the
least intention of going near London
during the hot weather, had replied
“NO.”
Two days later the Duke came down
cheerfully to breakfast. All was well
in the world. There had been rain in
that she was going to stay at Min-
neapolis for another month.
Smithers awaited him with anxious
face. He had folded the newspaper so
that the Duke could see the cricket
scores at the first glance. (In some
respects the Duke was just an ordinary
human being.)
“If you will excuse me, your Grace,”
began Smithers, “there's some very
bad news in the paper. Pardon me if
I break it to your Grace.”
“If those infernal poachers have
been poisoning my trout stream,” began
the Duke.
“Pardon me, your Grace, there is
the paragraph.”
| The Duke took up the paper and
the night and the Duchess had cabled
read: “On receipt of the news that
the Duke of Belvedere would not pledge
himself not to vote with the Govern-
ment a special meeting of the Chow
Bent Constitutional Club was held.
On the motion of Councillor Tonks it
was resolved that the name of the
Duke, surrounded by a deep black
border, should be hung up in both the
bar and the billiard-room.”
The butler waited eagerly. He read
The Observer regularly and wondered
whether the Duke would fall in an
apoplectic fit or strive to cut his throat
with a table-knife.
The Duke cracked his first egg—for
the benefit of lady readers one must
state that the Duke always has two,
lightly boiled. “Smithers,” he said,
“where the dooce is Chow Bent 2"
That night Smithers, weary of
serving a shameless aristocrat, left
his post, taking all portable plate with
him.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is a little difficult to know what to write about
Robert HUGH BENsoN's latest production, The Dawn of All
(HUTCHINsoN), because for one thing it is not a book that
can be classed in any exact category. In his preface
FATHER BENSON himself says that his purpose in writing
it was to provide a kind of antidote to “the exceedingly
depressing and discouraging effect” of his former work,
Lord of the World; and, as that showed the future de-
velopment of what is called modern thought, so the present
book treats of an exactly opposite condition, and of a world
in which revealed religion and the authority of Rome have
become the dominant factors in human and international
life. No one now will need to be told with what skill the
author does this. There is some quality about all FATHER
BENsoN's writing which (for want of a better word) I must
call compulsion. With his matter one may be in the most
violent disagreement, and irritated, even a little alarmed,
Years afterwards Sir Paul Chadwick turns up again
unimpaired by South Pacific appetites, and indeed in a fine
state of preservation, and falls in love with Cecilia, Cecily's
daughter. There is a situation that would have provided
mazes of psychological incident for some of our American
novelists, but KATHARINE TYNAN calmly unravels the diffi-
culty by making Sir Paul transfer his affections to some-
body else, helped by a ridiculously artificial series of mis-
takes and the overworked tide of the Atlantic. There are
some pleasant people in St. Cecilia, as there are always in
this writer's books; but I think they travel too much in
Irish jolting cars to get their emotions properly settled
down.
I question which of the three of us, Mr. WILLIAM CAINF,
who wrote The Devil in Solution (GREENING), Mr. GEORGE
MoRRow, who illustrated it, or I, who read it, enjoyed
himself with the greatest abandonment. It is without
doubt the most absurd book I have ever read. The mere
idea of alleging the cocoa-drinking habit as the last and
most vicious form of self-stimulation, and not only so,
- but further hanging the
at his conclusions, but
it is certain that one
cannot help listening to
whatever he chooses to
say. These columns are
obviously not the place
in which either to attack
or defend a book which
is partly a polemical
treatise and partly a
kind of religious fantasy.
I will content myself
with the promise that
everyone, of whatever
conviction, will find it in-
tensely interesting. The
central figure, Master-
man, who eventually be-
comes Cardinal Arch-
bishop of England, is
well drawn; and the con-
cluding scene, in which

[August 16, 1911.
“VENUS.”
I PRopose in this article to say a few words in favour
both of cats in general and of a particular cat whose
friendship I have recently gained. I think it right to say
this at the very outset in order that those who nourish an
ineradicable prejudice against cats may have due warning.
Such people actually exist. Have we not all heard of a
gallant field-marshal whose mind and limbs, indomitable in
the face of human enemies, surprise him by giving way if
a cat should happen to be in the same room with him 2
I have myself known a man not otherwise cowardly
who feared and detested cats to the point of fanaticism.
They revenged themselves upon him by pursuing him
with a perfect passion of misplaced affection. In vain
did he shut and bolt his bedroom door after a careful
investigation had assured him that no cats had gained
admittance. They grew by some magic in the watches
of the night, and towards 2 A.M. a number of them would
issue, purring and triumphant and sportive, from beneath
the bed. Over the futile cat-hunt that ensued it is best to
draw a veil. - -* * *
This unreasoning and immutable affection for men,
women and children is, indeed, the strongest characteristic
of cats. Where a dog would retire, disconcerted or angry,
from a man's blows or a child's uncouth caresses, a cat
will, after perhaps a momentary flurry, resume her
imperishable adoration. And there is about all cats
a dignity that persists even under the most depressing
circumstances. Couched on a ricketty chair, in some
miserable apology for a room, a cat lends to the scene
an air of long descent and aristocratic comfort. To
look at a king is a privilege we may all share with a cat,
but is there one of us who can do it with the cat's serene
assurance of being the protecting power 2. Because cats
are nearly always dignified and are usually serene, and
because they thus rise above their surroundings, unthinking
persons have set them down as being merely selfish lovers
of comfort. I repudiate the charge with all the energy of
which, in this sultry season, I am capable.
So much for cats in general. I do not pretend to
have made anything like an exhaustive list of their
superlative merits, but for the present it must suffice.
Let me now describe the particular cat I have in
mind. One morning, some weeks ago, as I was walking
in the garden my attention was arrested by a series of
pitiful mewings. For some time I failed to see the mewer,
but at last, in answer to an encouraging call, there issued
from a clump of bushes a tortoiseshell cat. So woe-
begone a figure I never beheld. Her coat was patchy and
untidy, she was wretchedly thin, her ears were as those of
a bat, and her tail was so long, so attenuated, and was so
stiftly held at an awkward angle that it seemed to have no
proper connection with the poor body from which it pro-
jected. . There was no disguising the painful fact: she was
unquestionably void of all external charms. Indeed, she
was, and is, an ugly cat. - - - - - - -
When she saw me she stopped with one paw poised in the
air. “I have had many disappointments,” she seemed to be
thinking, “and this is, perhaps, not the man I'm looking
for, the beloved companion, the milk-provider. Let me not
commit myself, for a kick is easy for him and painful to
me." I called her again, and then she made up her mind.
With a cry of “pr-r-roo,” which is a cat's fullest expression
of confidence and a desire for closer intimacy, she bounded
at me and made intricate arches of friendship round and
round my legs, gazing up into my face with a look of rapt
devotion in her emerald eyes. “I have sought you,” she
purred, “for a thousand years, and now at last I have found
you, oh worshipful one. Is there any milk about the place
for your slave to lap 2" Need I say that the milk was
provided in a bowl? It was drunk up to the last drop.
Whence this cat came—we have named her Venus—I
have been unable to discover. Nobody in the village is
willing to claim her or confess to having seen her before.
One of the gardeners, indeed, thinks he saw her “among
the beans” a day or two before. He alleges that she
sprang, violently out at him and gave him something
which he describes as “quite a turn”; but the testimony
of gardeners is not always to be trusted. Nor do I know
where she sleeps. On every morning since our first inter-
view she has turned up, seemingly from nowhere, in the
same sudden manner. She has had her rations, has
performed her toilet, and has followed me about the garden
like a dog. Then she has vanished to re-appear again
in the afternoon. Her demonstrations of affection have
been conducted on a crescendo principle. She is the
embodiment of self-forgetting adoration. Had I not seen
her defending herself against the inquisitive approach of a
Pekinese spaniel I should have conceived her to be abso-
lutely clawless. Sometimes she honours the library sofa
with her presence, but when I leave the room she tries to
follow me. If she fails in consequence of a misjudgment
about the door she waits for my return and welcomes me
with a transport of joy. But, wherever she may be, she
vanishes at about 8 P.M. into some mysterious nocturnal
home outside, and is seen no more until the following morn-
ing. She is now sleek and plump, and she may, therefore,
have abandoned her intention to turn into a princess more
beautiful than the day. Frankly, I like her better as a
plain cat. : - . .

The suggestion is made that the new postage-stamps
might be made more acceptable if the taste of the gum
were improved. Why not have half-a-dozen popular
flavours—say, peppermint, aniseed, white rose, heliotrope,
peardrop, and special toffee? With a really nice gum the
stamps would be sure to catch on.

MICROBE STUDIES FOR
MUSICIANS.
[With acknowledgments to the Analytical
Concert-Programme.]
I.
“LITTLE Bo-PEEP.”
IN this “Pastorale of the Crèche,” as
Schmidt has poetically described the
fragrant episode, the leading theme is
at once vigorously attacked, a note
being struck three times in quick suc-
cession. This note is no other than
the basic generative germ-cell itself,
and a fourth repetition of the note, by
completing the thematic cadence, con-
cludes the first statement of the full
germinal theme which we have been
eagerly expecting. It will be noticed
as the theme develops that bacilli are
conspicuous by their scarcity, and it is
to this absence of organic cells that the
beatific serenity of the cadence is attri-
butable, and, what is much more
important, it gives us the rare oppor-
tunity of using the word “Cancrizans”
(although in a somewhat strained
sense) to describe the backward retro-
cession of the rhythmic impulse to its
source.
II.
“Pop Goes THE WEASEL.”
The main theme at once introduces
us to the central germ motive (motif)
or bacteriological core. The introduc-
tion being effected we have leisure to
observe that the well-established rule
in music that one note shall follow
another is here well sustained. The
life-pulse or “arterial exuberance" of
the leading theme is conspicuous and
may serve to introduce a sappy inci-
dent in the life of Besenstielmeister,
the eminent conductor, who transcribed
the air for piccolo and bassoons in
unison. It appears from the Musical
Life of Vanderpoop that Frau Besen-
stielmeister was greatly attached to a
gardener whom the famous impresario
dismissed from his service on a proved
charge of eating an early lettuce. Sub-
sequently the unhappy lady spent many
hours daily in the deserted potting-
shed, where, it is said, the seedlings
were often watered with her tears.
Her husband, as well known, met his
end while experimenting with a diver's
outfit which had been delivered at his
house in error.
III.
“SIR Roger DE CoverLEY.”
We cannot do better than give a
translation of Dr. Eselkopf's lucid dis.
section of this air. “The piece de-
scribes,” says the Doctor, “an episode
in the adventurous life of a courageous
leucocyte. The first two and a half
THE LAST WORD.
“GARN | Got The Pip 'cos YEIt wasN'T MADE A PUPPY PEER, I s'rcse !”
*
bars are descriptive of the elation of
the mature and vigorous corpuscle
as he perambulates the warm blood-
stream until, suddenly, he observes the
approach of a valiant bacterium. The
fourth bar opens with the cry of battle
and prepares us for the attack. In the
fifth the combatants come to grips, in
the sixth they break away and prepare
for renewed onslaught, and in the
seventh and eighth the pallid corpuscle
vanquishes his adversary and devours
him.” The victorious leucocyte, in a
state of exaltation, then resumes his
adventures one octave higher, and
finally, in the coda, retires to a lym-
phatic gland.
IV.
“ORANGES AND LEMONS.”
The melodic skeleton which forms
the foundation of this enthralling
musical entity is of so fragile a char-
acter that exact articulation becomes
a matter of great difficulty, and any
dissection of its organic cells and
classification of its germic system an
affair of deep complexity. In these
circumstances it has seemed desirable
to obtain an authoritative opinion on
the subject, and accordingly Professor
Bouveril, Mus. Bac. Oxon, was asked
to supply a microbic analysis, a copy
of the score being enclosed with the
letter making the request. By an
accident the envelope was addressed
to Professor Condy, the eminent
bacteriologist, who has made a report
which will be read with avidity by
all true music-lovers. After describing
precautions to eliminate germs which
might have become attached to the
surface of the paper and therefore
could not be considered as inherent in
the music itself, the learned Doctor
states that, under conditions of perfect
sterility, cultures were procured from
the score, being incubated in prepared
bouillon at a temperature of 95° F.
Musicians will be gratified by the
Professor's endorsement of modern
methods of analysis, for he states that
a serum derived from these cultures
injected subcutaneously killed a cart-
horse.
WIELAND, the Swiss aviator, has
just had a remarkable escape. He
fell on a flock of sheep, of which five
were killed, but the animals broke his
fall. It is now proposed to instal at
Brooklands and elsewhere sheep in
groups of not fewer than five. Arising
out of this incident we learn that
French aviators have adopted as argot
for landing the phrase, “Revenoms d
mos moutons.”

METHODS OF IDENTIFICATION.
THE Twins were at the wickets,
delighting everyone except the fielding
side with a brilliant display of batting.
"oh, well hit, {{...,
Peters and Priddy simultaneously.
Dick, ;
Bob,
they continued, turning to
exclaimed
“You ass!—that wasn't t
Bob,”
Dick,”
address each other.
A voice floated out from the scorer's
box. “Did Mr. Robert 'it that, or
was it Mr. Richard 2 " There was a
patient weariness in the voice, as if
the question had become a formula to
| the speaker.
When the matter had been satis-
factorily settled, Mrs. Parry turned to
the New Member.
“Don't you find it very hard to
distinguish Dick and Bob?” she asked.
“I suppose it is rather,” replied the
New Member. “But I'm surprised
that the scorer can't. After all, most
batsmen are fairly undistinguishable
when they're at the wickets. Isn't it
the scorer's business to keep count as
to who is at which end ?”
“You are fresh from your bloodish
Metropolitan club, my lad,” said Henry
—Mrs. Parry's husband. “You don't
know our scorers yet. Wait till
you've striven half the season to
make double figures, and then, on re-
tiring to the pavilion filled with holy
joy because you've got 11 to your credit,
find it telegraphed as 9. Wait till half
the county writes to congratulate you
on a pair of specs, having seen the score
in the local rag, when really you got a
duck and 1.”
“Why doesn't one of the Twins wear
some hing as a distinguishing mark,
then 2'' asked the New Member.
“Dick wears a cap,” said Henry.
“But he always gives it to the umpire as
soon as he goes in,” he added foolishly.
“And the same with intent to
deceive,” chipped in Peters, “because
Bob always makes more runs than he
does. Old George, our scorer, says to
the visiting scorer, ‘Mr. Richard, 'e
wears a cap, 'e do," and then he hauls
out a jar of cider and proceeds to divide
a pasty with the alien, and in the mean-
while Dick takes off his cap. So the
next time old George condescends to
notice what's going on, he finds he's
all mixed up.”
“There's no doubt, of course, that
the Twins are extraordinarily alike,”
said the New Member, “but don't you
think Dick has a slightly more humor-
ous turn of the mouth than his brother?”
“I go by the nose,” chipped in
Henry. “There's a bit of a crook in
WaS |
old Bob's, thoughtfully created by Dick
in a youthful fracas to serve as a dis-
tinguishing mark.”
“That's no good,” grumbled Priddy,
still sore at having assigned the last
boundary to the wrong twin. “If you
really want to make sure, you have to
keep a tomato in your pocket, and
produce it every time you address one
of them. Dick hates tomatoes, and if
it's him, you'll see him squirm."
“Personally, I've no difficulty,” said
Peters. “Bob has owed me half-a-crown
for years (I let the debt run on for the
sake of the convenience), and the guilty
remembrance of it is always with him.
He can't face me without blinking.”
“Not many people can.” (This from
Priddy.)
“Ever since Bob's been married,"
said Mrs. Parry, “he's begun to brush
his hair a little. Not much, of course,
but enough for the scientific eye to dis-
tinguish him from Dick, whose hair is
virgin forest, so to speak. . . ."
“Now who hit that ?" asked the
New Member, and the patient voice
from the scorer's box was heard again:
“Did Mr. Robert 'it that, or was it
Mr. Richard 2 ''
“Bob,
“Dick,
Mrs. Parry.
“It's so absurd,” said Mrs. Parry a
moment later. “At all this distance...”
“They've only got the Twins' word
for it too,” put in Peters gallantly.
“I'm surprised,” he continued, “that
old George troubles to ask who made
the hit. If it was any other pair, he'd
just put it down to the one he'd got
the least grievance against at the time.”
“But he always tries to act fairly by
the Twins,” said Henry. You see, he
dandled them on his knee—knees, I
should say—when they were babes.”
“The only time you can act fairly by
them is when they're fielding,” remarked
Priddy. “Dick envelopes himself in
pads and gloves, and keeps wicket,
purely in order to be recognised—at
least, no one ever discovered any other
reason for his being behind the sticks.
And everything he misses goes to the
boundary, unless (as occasionally hap-
pens) it is prevented by the strenuous
efforts of Bob at courtesy fine-slip—
that position which a less squeamish
and more honest generation was wont
to call long-stop."
“Hush,” said Henry on a low note.
“Here's Mrs. Bob.” Then aloud—
“How awfully well Bob did against
Westmoreland last week Eighty-
seven in his second knock, wasn't it 2"
Mrs. Bob bubbled over.
“It wasn't Bob,” she said; “it was
Dick. Bob had a cold, so I made Dick
go in his name. It was really to the
}of course,” said Mr. and
county's advantage, you know, because
the Westmoreland bowlers played up
to all Bob's weak points—which aren't
Dick's.”
We “heard the silence for a little
space.” -
“Why do they both wear silk shirts?”
asked Mrs. Parry. “If only one of
them did—”
“That's Dick's fault,” interrupted
Mrs. Bob. “I gave Bob half-a-dozen
on his last birthday, but Dick thieves
them with the utmost serenity. . . Oh,
Bob's out ! That ball was much too
far up to hook.”
“You’re sure it is Bob, I suppose?”
said Mrs. Parry; and the voice from
the scoring box inquired, “Was that
Mr. Robert wot was out 2."
“Of course it's Bob,” said Mrs. Bob.
“Why, he's got a better figure, and is
so much handsomer than poor old
Dick. Hard lines, dear,” she observed
to the advancing figure. “Dick's
having all the luck.”
The advancing figure grinned, and
there was no need of Priddy's tomato
or Peters' half-crown to tell us that
Mrs. Bob had made a howler.
“All right,” said he. “Tell old
George that Bob's out. It'll improve
my average. . . ."
“Of course, at such a distance—and
in flannels,” said Mrs. Bob.

ABOUT THE LONG. HOLE.
STRAIGHT in front of him, and as far
as his eye can reach, the traveller who
stands on the teeing-ground of our
tenth hole, observes the illimitable
undulating scenery of the veldt. Per-
haps a solitary vulture wheels over-
head in the heavens, and along the
central track may be discerned a few
bleaching bones of caddies and the
broken shafts and skulls of drivers
and brassies. Far away to the left is
a strip of woodland, and beyond that
the sluggish inexorable river. What
secrets it bears in its massive bosom or
in the murky ooze of its heart! A bad
pull (to be more explicit) will take you
nicely over the edge, and many a stout
golfer has gone home at evenfall with
an empty creel owing to his rash
| refusal to carry a landing net and play
with amphibious balls. To the right-
hand may be seen a series of wicked-
mouthed bunkers, each with its little
colony of human toil. Bogey for the
long hole is six, and it is believed to
have been done in four. There is no
doubt at all that it has been done in
twenty-five, but then that was the day
when I hit the ladies' sand-box with
my drive, and (after my caddy had re-
placed the divot with a couple of tin-
tacks and some glue) had to play my
second (with a mashie) from twenty
yards behind the tee. Now you shall
hear about the time when I did the long
hole in five. I started with a magnifi-
cent shot, though I say it who
shouldn't (as a matter of fact it is
very difficult to get James to talk
about this round at all, and when he
does he uses language which would
make you suppose he was colour-blind)
—but my second seemed to think there
was danger afoot, and ran into the
wood for cover. The wood is not out
of bounds, so I waved farewell to James
and followed. My third started shinning
very swiftly up the trunk of a tree, and
then remembering, I suppose, that the
birds were all hatched out and that it
would look rather silly to be seen in
a nest at this time of year, leaped
violently out of the wood and across
the course. It was foolish of the small
stout man whom it hit, and who
appeared to have lost his way badly
in approaching the seventeenth green,
to get annoyed : the grievance was
really mine, for he had no business to
be making unauthorised pot-bunkers of
himself all over the links. However, as
my ball fell in a very nice place, I didn't
much mind, and playing a beautiful
fourth got to within about a hundred-
and-twenty yards of the green. I heard
a faint “Coo-ee" up in the hills far away
&o the right, and shouted “Hello!”
A GRATEFUL IMPULSE.

“A PENNY stamp, PLEASE –AND, by-the-way, HAvex't I sees You BEFore?"
“YEs, MADAM.
I HAD THE good Fortus E to save Your LIFE LAST week."
“To BE suite—to BE sure—ER—Two PENNY stamps, PLEASE."
“On in five," yelled James.
“Good for you,” I answered, and
took my iron. (I always like taking
my iron; it has such a bracing effect
on the nerves.) It was plain from
the beginning that my fifth stroke was
a good one, though just a trifle off the
line of the pin. James and his caddy
arriving travel-stained and warm from
the north-east watched it eagerly as it
fell and bounded on towards the green.
James's ball lay about five yards to the
right of the flag, in a sunny spot to the
south-east, and as soon as mine saw
this a brilliant idea came into its head.
Running lightly up to its adversary it
gave the fellow a smart biff on the side
of the face, and dodging away nimbly
before he could retaliate, made straight
for the hole. Pausing for a moment
at the edge to see if it was pursued, it
ran round the brink of the tin and fell
in with a little sigh of relief. “Five' "
I said calmly, but James did not appear
to be listening. He was looking up
the sky and seemed vexed about some-
thing.
“An ordinary half-ball losing
hazard,” I went on. “I was afraid I
had hit it too fine at first and thrown
away the hole.” But James had
walked on in silence to the next tee.

Deputy-Assistant Surveyor of Taxes,
Inland Revenue -
(City 54th A District),
Room 92, Fifth Floor,
Budget Buildings,
13-16, Stamp Street,
London, E.C.
MY DEAR SIR,--I am not quite clear
about one or two points in the income-
tax demand received from you this
morning, and I thought I would just
have a little chat with you about it
before sending my small contribution.
Of course, I know you wouldn't make
me pay more than I ought, but per-
haps I didn't fill in that yellow paper
quite properly, and I want to explain
to you. You see £18 2s. 2d. is a lot
for a fellow like me to find all in one
lump. Sometimes I make a good deal,
when the magazines take my stories,
and sometimes I'm precious hard up.
I am hard up now, and if I have to
pay you £18 2s. 2d., well, it simply
means that I can't pay Bull the
butcher, and he's pressing me, and
I promised to. I daresay you're a
family man yourself and understand
these little matters.
Well, it's like this. Bobby Burt, an
old Cambridge pal, lent me a tenner
just before CTIristmas, and I paid him
back when I got a bit for my novel,
Kisses Kind, on Feb. 7th. (I'm send-
ing you a copy of the book, and hope
you will enjoy it.) Now, I put that in,
as I keep very careful accounts, and it
came on the left side of the book
where I get the totals from. But you
won't charge me on it, will you ?
Bobby ought toepay, if anybody, and I
daresay he has. You don't want it
twice, do you ?
Then there is my wife's little income.
Well, she's very good about it, and
often lends a hand when things are a
bit tight; but a hundred pounds a
year from an uncle isn't much, is
it? and it does seem rather hard
to knock spots out of that, when
it's all she 's got to dress herself
and the two youngsters on, and pay a
nurse; because that 's what she does
with it, and nobody could make it go
further than she does. I put it in
because the form told me to, and I
didn't want to be fined and pay
double and all that sort of thing. But
grateful.
you see it comes from an investment
in Mexican Jumbo Tintos, and they
take off something before she gets it,
which I believe goes to you (you can
look it up), and if you could do without
it, well I should really be awfully
You see I’ve got to have a
bigger house than I should want if I
didn't simply have to have a room to
myself to write in, because, although
the youngsters are kept as quiet as
possible, still they are very tiny and
the baby's only five weeks old, and
I couldn't do any work if I had to
write where they were. -
I don't want to take up too much
of your time, letter-writing. I expect
you have enough of it. If you would
care to run down for a week end to
talk it over, we should be awfully
pleased to see you. There's a decent
golf course here, and I've got a few
bottles of “Bubbly " that a rich uncle
of my wife's—not the one that left
her the Jumbo Tintos—he's dead—
sent us at Christmas. We might buzz
one or two together; and I'm sure we
could give you a good time.
I'm sure you will do what you can
for me, like a good chap. I'm ready
to pay my whack all right, but I don't
want to pay more than I can help, and
if you could spin out the correspondence
a bit, so as to let me off paying till I get
a few more royalties at the end of June,
I should feel jolly grateful to you.
Yours ever, T. C. Robinson.

To Mr. W. P. Smith, etc., etc.
DEAR MR. SMITH,-Thanks awfully
for your kind letter, and for knocking
off Bobby Burt's tenner, and the
missus's hundred. That brings it
down to £13 19s. 8d., which is ripping,
and really I'm most awfully grateful
to you for telling me that I can take off
something more for my study. I pay
£45 a year for this little box, which
isn't really worth it, but, as I say, I
had to have a room, and that's why
we moved from Laburnum Cottage,
where we only paid £28. Do you really
mean I can take off the difference?
That would make it £13 6s. 10d. I
don't quite understand what you mean
about averaging, but it's awfully good
of you to help me. I went in for the
Classical Tripos at Cambridge—only
allowed a pass degree, worse luck—
but I was never much good at mathe-
matics, and I don't think I got up to
averages. I give you the figures that
you ask for on the other side. Of
course, I'm making more every year,
but it's slow work. Still, there are
signs that Kisses Kind is going to
make a hit, and if it does well, I shall
be sending you a bit more next year.
If you can get it down further still this
year, which has been rather a teaser,
owing to the baby coming and the
other kiddy having mumps, and our
having to pay off instalments of a loan
I had to raise three years ago, I needn't
say that I shall be jolly glad. . But I
know I can safely leave myself in your
hands, as you've shown yourself a
thorough sportsman. By-the-by, are
you any relation to W. M. Smith, who
bowled for the 'Varsity while I was up? |
He was a jolly good sportsman too. I
thought the name and one of the initials
being the same you might be. I wish
you could have come down, but perhaps
you'll be able to later on.
I must dry up and go and put in a
bit of work. So, with many thanks,
Yours ever, T. C. Robinson.

DEAR OLD CHAP.-What a ripper you
are I quite catch the point about
the averaging now, and it's top hole
and what I never expected, to get
another fiver taken off. That only
leaves £8.6s. 10d. I say, we are getting
it down, aren't we ? I send you the
particulars about the loan and the
papers you asked for. Do you think
you can get a bit off for that, too? Do
try. And don't I get something off
for bringing the whole outfit down
below a certain figure ? I don't know
what it comes to now, but you've got
such a head for figurcº Ghat, I bet you
do, without having to put pen to
paper. I wish I'd made better use of
my time when they were trying to
teach me things. Of courgo I can
scribble a bit, and 'll be glad to
hear that Kisses Kind has gone into
a third edition, but I shouldn't keep
your job for long. It wants a few
brains for that sort of thing. I say,
we must meet some time or other. I
feel as if I'd known you for years.
Now do fix a week-end and come and

don't.

A BULLY PROPOSITION.
[According to a recent dictum of Dr.
RENDALI, of Charterhouse, “bullying has been
replaced in public schools by a tendency to
effeminacy, which is almost worse.”]
TELL us not in tones that quaver
That the bully is extinct,
That no more the Prefects favour
Cults at which their fathers winked
Surely, then, they cannot fully
Realise what vim and tone
Radiated from a bully
On the weakling and the drone !
Where is all the grit we boasted
In the days of bold Tom Brown 2
Are our sons no longer roasted,
Held, discreetly, upside down 2
Know they not the queer sensations
Born of being briskly “tossed"?
Then our place among the nations
Is inevitably lost!
Up, High Priests of Education
Up, ye zealous pedagogues!
Shall complete emasculation
Send your country to the dogs?
Since the grand old strain of Brute is
Moribund in youthful hearts,
Make it first of all your duties
To revive the bully's arts |
Lest you see Young England pampered
Up to its unblackened eyes—
Even as its health is “hampered”
By excessive food supplies.
Remedies however drastic
Must be found the case to meet;
And they lie in your scholastic
Hands—and, when it's needful, feet!
Come, bestow the frequent licking !
Not with futile birch or cane,
But, with fisticuffs and kicking,
Be superbly inhumane!
Academic methods scorning,
Follow those of MACE and SAYERs:
Punch a dozen heads each morning
Regularly after Prayers'
When your charges' scalps are tender,
Crowned with many a wholesome
bump,
And their supple limbs you render
Piebald with a cricket stump,
Then their souls shall gain in merit
Through the pluck that pain inspires
Till our hardened cubs inherit
All the glory of their sires!

THE ABDICATION.
AH, no! I do not tremble as I did
Before the keeper of the Petrol Tank;
The haughty optic and the drooping lid,
The air of having billions at the bank—
These things afflight me not; a sun
Has risen above the reigning one;
Another king we now anoint
Who puts the noses out of joint
Of such as Perkins. (Penalty for swank.)
IIow of en have I sat beside his wheel,
And sought to gain his pity at the least,
As the long dusty miles were laid to heel,
And hedge and wood went by, and startled beast;
Have praised his prowess and his skill,
And asked about his latest kill,
And where he hung his hoarded scalps,
And on what speed he'd climbed the Alps,
And felt with every word his scorn increased.
And, if at moments out of ruth he stirred
To tell me little tales of sparking plugs
And centre-bits (no, that is not the word
But something like it), as belated slugs,
Uncrushed by travellers, upturn
Their eyes towards the heavens, and yearn
To kiss the boot that spared them, so
I felt within my heart the glow
Of gratitude, more warm than many rugs.
But that was all too seldom. Mostly blind
To mere humanity whose mental plant
Was geared so slackly, he was wont to wind
His Gallic horn, and up the highway slant
Speed on, inscrutable, unreined,
Although his mistress oft complained
That some day he would see us dead
(I do not think that I have said
That Perkins is the chauffeur of my aunt).
But now I have him. I have learned the dodge
To melt the icy manners of our Jove;
An airman passed us just outside the lodge
That guards the gateway of Laburnum Grove.
I saw at once the salient fact
That, since the day when birds were whacked,
Unknown to us, unguessed, a qualm
Had shaken that Olympian calm;
Perkins no longer was a super-cove. ©
He trembled, and his brow was overcast;
He paled beneath his tan, he grew polite;
I saw at once his empery was past;
Since then one only has to speak of flight
If Perkins seems a trifle rude,
And what a change of attitude!
One hint of BEAUMoNT and VEDRINEs
O'errides his majesty of mien.
Great Lucifer has fallen. Serve him right!
Evor.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Exth ACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, 7th
August.—ELLIs GRIFFITH, too little
heard in debate, has to-day
established reputation for
shrewd, witty speech that will
long be cherished. House
brought together on Bank
Holiday on dolorous errand.
Some of PRINCE ARTHUR's
faithless followers, among them
one or two directly indebted
to his generous patronage for
their prominence in affairs,
have turned and rent him.
Impatient of Actaeon in his
capacity of the hunter, they
would transform him into the
stag. Distraught by personal
abuse in public speech and in
section of Party Press, he has
been driven to adoption of
grievous error in tactics. The
malcontents who have egged
on HALSBURY to assume posi-
tion of saver of his country
shout from the house-top their
intention in due time to come
down (by the lift) and at least
muddy their coats in the last
ditch in resistance to the Veto
Bill.
This sort of heroics always
taking. Seems to imply that,
though the commissioned
Leaders of the party are poltroons,
there are still left a deathless body
of heroes who are not to be de-
terred from striking a last blow in
defence of a hapless State by prospect
of soiling their garments in manner
indicºtcd by noble Lord quoted by
LANSI:owNE. PRINCE ARTHUR and
LANGDown E, finding themselves thus
out-shouted, resolved to have a little
game of their own. Gave notice of
vote of censure to be moved in both
Houses. So here we are to-day, when
we might have been healthfully engaged
riding donkeys on Hampstead Heath
or rolling down the grassy slopes of
Greenwich Hill.
PRINCE ARTHUR, having delivered his
attack, had satisfaction of seeing PRIME
MINISTER greeted with ovation by his
followers when he arose to “tender to
the Right Honourable Gentlemen on
behalf of HIS MAJESTY's Government,
and of those who support them, our
most grateful acknowledgment for this
opportune though unexpected motion.”
Nothing bores the House more than a
sham fight. Members listened intently
to the PREMIER, who, with skill of Old
Parliamentary Hand, made the most
of opportunity of detailing and vindi-
cating action of Cabinet in its com-
munications with the
SoverEIGN. retired. Filled up as news went round
After that there descended dulness that Member for Anglesey was “up”
not to be lightened by F. E. SMITH's and in his best form. Soon there was
fireworks.
Thus it came to pass that a crowded audience seizing with delight
when ELLIs GRIFFITH interposed the the points flashed forth with effect
“SHREWD, WITTY SPEECH.”
“Heightened by the almost funereal aspect of the commentator.”
(Mr. Ellis GRIFFITH.)
benches were nearly empty, ALFRED
LYTTELTON being sole occupant of that
whence PRINCE ARTHUR had dejectedly
“Had he been born in the spacious Tudor
times . . . he would certainly have been burned
at the stake.”
[Indeed, his normal attitude in the House
is strangely suggestive of that objectionable
operation.] (Lord Hugh CECIL.)
heightened by almost funeretl
aspect of the commentator.
Nothing nearer the “gay
wisdom" of WILFRID LAwson
in his prime has been heard
in House since there was a
vacancy in representation of
Cockermouth. Even better
than the best from the original
mint, since it was free from
those obvious evidences of
preparation that occasionally
marred effect of WILFRID
LAwson's jocundity.
Business done. — Vote of
Censure negatived by 365
votes against 246.
Tuesday. — “What I like
about Cousin HUGH,” said the
Member for Sark, “is his
aggressive courage. Had he
been born in the spacious
Tudor times his great ancestor
partly bestrode he would, in
corresponding circumstances,
certainly have been burned at
the stake. Not yet knowing
Asquith, he would have sug-
gested, had he lived under
QUEEN MARY, that HER
MAJESTY ‘should be punished
by the criminal law; ' or,
coming to the front in ELIZABETH's
reign, his aesthetic taste offended, he
would have found a short cut to
Smithfield by ridiculing WALTER
RALEIGH’s feigned worship of HER
MAJESTY's personal charms.
“Made fatal mistake a fortnight ago
by rowdyism which prevented PRIME
MINISTER from delivering important
statement at grave constitutional crisis,
After that, and in view of universal
condemnation on grounds of good taste
and manners, an ordinary man would
have withdrawn himself to Southend-
on-Sea, or other convenient locality,
and buried himself in the sands till the
storm blew over. That not Cousin
HUGH’s way. Old question turning up
again in form of Resolution to disagree
with Lords' Amendments to Veto Bill,
here he is boldly coming to the front
with motion to adjourn debate for
three months. Nor was this all. So
far from shirking the shouting-down
match, he took occasion blandly to
remark that he ‘looked back to the
event of fourteen days ago with
satisfaction.’”
The House, which admires courage,
gave Cousin HUGH a moderately quiet
hearing. His speech scornful, occa-
sionally truculent, was addressed

fight between the Classes and the

upon them, delighted in opportunity of
addressing Member for Oxford Univer-
sity as “CECIL” tout court, just as in
court Louis XVI. heard him-
self denounced as “CAPET.”
Now and then good-
humoured chaff merged in
angry remonstrance, as when
Cousin Hugh expressed, what
the SPEAKER recognised as
“a pious opinion,” that the
PREMIER had been guilty of
high treason. When the storm
rose and raged he dropped

THE IDEAL HOLIDAY.
THE example of our contemporary,
The Evening News, in appealing to
various well-known people to state
what in their opinion constitutes the
ideal holiday, has induced Mr. Punch
to supplement the investigation, with
the following exhilarating results:—
SIR GEORGE ALEXANDER.
In London I dress more or less im-
maculately. Here—at a tiny village
on the East Coast—I don garments
snatched, at the last moment, from
their appropriate ragbag, and do all I
can to emulate the sartorial non-
chalance of the tramp.
SIR Edward ELGAR.
In my holiday time, if the truth
must be told, I love, like Apollo, to
unbend my bow and indulge in
frivolous compositions. Thus in the
last fortnight my output includes a
Rag-time Rhapsody, a Burlesque of
BRAHMs, and a Symphonic Cake-walk
Polka which I have dedicated to
Messrs. BUszARD.
THE EDItoR of The English Review.
My ideal holiday consists in ex-
changing for my normal editorial duties
the charge of a magazine for children
of tender years. I go down to Totland
Bay, and there, as I watch the infant
holiday makers disporting themselves
on the shore, I improvise with extra-
ordinary facility cautionary tales, fables,
and allegories of the most blameless
character. I also take great care to
attune my diet to my mental processes,
and live exclusively on rice puddings,
rusks, barley-water and milk. If I
read anything it is the novels of
Miss Yonge or the articles of Lord
Court.NEY of PEN WITH.
MR. ANDREw CARNEGIE.
My ideal holiday is to live on six-

neither literary nor courageous.

[AUGUST 16, 1911.
THE TEAM FOR AUSTRALIA.
(An exercise in the judicial and courtly
manner of Mr. P. F. Warner.)
THE authorities of the M.C.C. are
still engaged in the delicate and mo-
mentous task of team-building, and it
may not be inopportune while waiting
for that great batsman, Mr. C. B. FRY,
to come to a decision as to whether he
will or will not visit the Antipodes as
the Captain, to pass under review the
various ingredients of the English side.
Mr. C. B. FRY, of course, is a tower
of strength, and was never more superb
and classical than this season. I re-
member Mr. C. B. FRY's first match
only too well, for a straight drive from
those broad shoulders split one of my
infinitives. -
In default of Mr. C.B. FRY, we ought,
I think, to take THOMAS HAY ward. It is
necessary that a root-striking batsman
should go, and next to Mr. C. B. FRY,
if not before him, is certainly Thomas
HAyward. The first time I played
against Thomas HAY waRD was in the
Middlesex and Surrey match of 1889,
and I can still see THOMAS HAYWARD,
younger then and perhaps quicker in
the field (as indeed we all were), as he
hit four after four. The Hon. Robert
GRIMston, always a shrewd judge of
the game, remarked to me, “That
young man, given no decrease in form,
will do well"—prophetic words indeed.
From Surrey are to come two of
THoMAs HAYw ARD's colleagues—John
B. Hobbs, and HERBERT STRUDwick,
whom, I regret to say, the crowd are
too apt to call “Struddy,” thus letting
into the game an element of familiarity
against which I have always set my
face. JoHN B. Hobbs is undoubtedly a
sterling batsman, and I find that in my
book, The Cricketing Circumnavigator,
published in 1909, I refer to him as
“a sterling batsman with a large num-
ber of strokes, of whom we shall hear
more.” The choice of John B. HoBBs
to be a member of this team must there-
fore be considered sound. Nor is there
any exception to be taken to HERBERT
STRUdwick, who for capable wicket-
keeping has acquired a reputation
second to none. -
In the Australian tour of 1905, which
I had the honour to captain, HERBERT
STRUDwick was not called upon in
any of the test matches, ARTHUR A.
LILLEY being all-sufficient. This time
HERBERT STRUdwick will himself be
the ARTHUR A. LILLEY and Edwin J.
SMITH of Warwickshire will be the
HERBERT STRUDwick of the team. Lord
HAwkE, who knew the game through
and through, even in the cradle, predicted
a great future for HERBERT STRUDwick
when he saw him in 1897. “That little
man,” he said (and I hope HERBERT
STRUDwick, for whom I have very real
esteem and would not on any account
wound, will not object to the ..".
—“that little man will nip the bails off
a lot of good wickets before he's done.”
Time has proved how inspired were
his Lordship's words. -
To return to Warwickshire, it seems
on the way of sending no fewer than
three men, for in addition to Edwin J.
SMITH, who can bat as well as stump,
it is to provide Mr. F. R. Foster and
SAMUEL P. KINNEIR. Mr. F. R. Foster
is, of course, the marvel of 1911, as not
only is he a most dangerous bowler but
a batsman who always makes his fifty.
I have fielded against him many times
and never without wishing I was com-
fortably at home with my Westminster
Gazette in my hands. I remember his
first match as if it were yesterday—as
indeed it almost was. I was sitting
by the Hon. Robert Lyttelton,
a keen watcher of the cricket fir-
mament, and he said, “Mark my
words, that youngster's a cricketer.”
Could anything have been more true?
SAMUEL P. KINNEIR is a left-hander,
and of left-handers we cannot have too
many. The success of Mr. CLEMENT
HILL, Mr. VERNoN RANSFORD and Mr.
WALTER BARDswell, among the Aus-
tralians, should prove this. SAMUEL
P. KINNEIR-

BOOK CHAT.
LoRD RosebERY has no new book
on the stocks.
The enormous success that has been
achieved by Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEux's
masterpiece, The Indiscretions of a
Lady's Maid, has naturally prompted
him to further explorations of this
attractive field of psychology. He
has, we understand, already com-
pleted the manuscript of a thrilling
romance entitled The Futilities of a
Fourth Footman, and is now engaged
on The Tragedy of a Still-Room Maid.
There is, however, no foundation for
the report that he is the author of the
anonymously published novel, The Soul
of a Scavenger.
Mrs. Connie Crimm has nearly
finished a new story, to which she gives
the title The Same Old Game. Accord-
ing to private information concerning
the plot, it deals with a marquis, his
sister-in-law, who is heiress to a crip-
pled half-brother, and the dowager
marchioness, who is the marquis's step-
mother. The crippled half-brother is
unaware of the existence of his sister
until he meets her at a sacred concert
at Adelboden. The story, it will be seen,
is of deeply religious significance, with
an admirable description of a fatal.
toboggan accident, and can be safely
recommended to all country congrega-
tions.
The exact sum netted by Miss
Pauline Pryor for her realistic study
of smart life, entitled At the Keyhole,
is, to date, £35,000. -
Kentucky, the home of the famous
Mammoth Caves, has always shown a
lively appreciation of the work of the
veteran historian of that formidable
but unhappily extinct mammal. Our
readers will, we are sure, be deeply
interested to learn that the University
of Kentucky is publishing a collected
edition, with illustrations, portraits,
notes, excursuses and an index of Sir
HENRY Howorth's letters to The
Times. Four volumes, each of about
750 pages, have already issued from
the University Press, and it is hoped
that the collection will be completed
by the year 1940.
Mrs. Hodley Beddoes has finished a
charming volume of essays, daintily
entitled Tripe and Onions. Since the
publication of the same author's de-
licious Veal and Ham Patties, nothing
so genial, so redolent of the true
democratic unction, has emanated from
the press. SAMUEL WARREN, the gifted
author of Ten Thousand a Year, alone
of classic writers may be said to have
come within a measurable distance
of the adorable oleaginosity of Mrs.
Beddoes' pen, but the rest is silence.
Beside her THACKERAY is a prig and
DickeNs a boor.
Mr. Roland Pougher's new mediae-
val romance will be published next
Thursday, and is confidently expected
to stagger the meticulous pedants who
demur to the stark simplicities of
modern realism. Compared with its
superbly adult imagery, the timid
puerilities of Ivanhoe suffer an igno-
minious eclipse. It is interesting to
learn that the ex-Sultan ABDUL
HAMID and KING THEEBAw, the deposed
King of Burmah, have both been
graciously pleased to accept a present-
ation advance copy of Mr. Pougher's
romance, which rejoices in the engaging
title of The Swanking Times.
A new poet is about to swim into
our ken in the person of Boaz Bobb, a
son of the Arkansas soil, who has long
been resident in London studying Ice-
landic literature for the purposes of a
new saga of the Wild West. Those
persons who have been privileged to
see Mr. Bobb's lyrics in MS. say that
they can remember nothing like them
for their simplicity and candour. Mr.
Bobb, with the delightful lack of re-
straint and false shame that is so
marked a characteristic of the age,
takes the reader into his confidence

ONE MORE STRIKE,
THESE are times of general upset
and unrest, and everyone seems to be
going on strike. The latest economic
disturbance to be threatened is among
the Dentists' Deadheads. These ladies
are dissatisfied with the current rate of
pay. This, it appears, is ten shillings
remuneration for the duty of sitting
from ten till six on alternate days in
the waiting-room of a young dentist
who wishes to give the impression of
a rising practice.
*We must confess that some of their
requirements are not unreasonable.
Among their stipulations, for instance,
are the following:—
A clean sweep of all the tattered
back numbers—some more than two
years old—of the ladies' newspapers
which decorate the waiting-room table.
A fresh supply of the morning and
evening dailies and the current femi-
nine magazines.
A more generous and realistic re-
cognition of their status as “decoys.”
by an occasional summons to the
dentist's room, not, of course, for an
operation, but for the purpose of a
friendlºr chat.
A claim on the dentist's services
gratis, if required, with unlimited
laughing gas and restoratives.
A relaxation of the rule requiring
them to appear apprehensive and
miserable.
An extension of the turn-and-turn-
about system of attendance, on the
dog-watch principle, in order to visit
sales or other urgent attractions.
A release from the necessity of
simulating swollen faces by putting
monkey-nuts in their cheeks.
An increase of pay, to be settled by
the arbitration of Mr. AskwitH, in view
of the general enhancement of prices
consequent on all the other strikes.
Unless these demands are speedily
assented to, we fear there will be a
vacuum in the reception-room of many
a commencing L.D.S. We hear that
pickets are already selected for the pur-
pose of peacefully dissuading prospec-
tive patients, and, in fact, the strikers
are showing a most determined front.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ONE of the most delightful American books that has
come my way for sonne time is While Caroline was Growing
(MACMILLAN), by Josephine DASKAM BAcon. I gather from
the advertisement pages that this lady has already written
several other stories about children; she certainly does it
very well, with, moreover, the rare gift of being able to
present the child's point of view. But because of this
I am the more inclined to grumble at her for yielding to the
temptation to make her children do far too much. Bring-
ing together lovers, I mean, or convincing Society ladies of
their errors, and the like. Caroline's adolescence would
appear to have been spent in a continual round of this
fellow on etiquette, mind about spelling?—but when the
writer took me to the Palace of Leopards in the Chumbra
Valley, to wrest the real ape from the guardian priestess,
the mixture of magazine comedy with Eastern ferocity and
horror became too unnatural to please. The humonr of the
adventure wore thin, and he never settled down in earnest
to the magical, hair-raising business. Things brisked up
a bit, I confess, towards the end, where Humiman gave a
fine exhibition of his powers for wreaking vengeance on
the sacrilegious; but still, when I remember Fleet and
Strickland and those raw chops, I feel that Mr. DoRRINGTON
would have done better to stick to the farcical vein
throughout. -

Of course Miss (or

if so, I reply that

short, is a wholly charming and lovable little person, to
whose creator I tender my grateful thanks; with just this
reservation that she is a little too hard-worked for her years.
I don't think Mr. ALBERT DoRRINGTON had quite made
up his mind before he began to write Our Lady of the
Leopards (MILLs AND Boon) whether he was going to spin
a yarn of humorous filibustering adventure, or let us into
the uncanny secrets of Hindoo temples, and their strange
Lgeds. Perhaps he found a precedent for combining the
two themes in such a story as The Incarnation of Krishna
Mulvaney, to which his opening chapters seem considerably
indebted. But then Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING is Mr. RUDYARD
KIPLING, and a short story is quite a different pair of shoes
from a novel. I got on very well at first with Captain
Hayes, a gentleman with all the aes triplex of our old
friend Kettle, and with Larry Delaney, the Irishman who
impersonates Huniman—shall it be Huniman, by the way,
or Hanuman, or doesn't the Monkey-God, rather a touchy

developed by ELDRID REYNoLDs (for whose sex I hesitate
to plump), of the sea calling one of its lost sons back from
the humdrum prosperity of the methodical city, and plant-
ing him, at first much against his will, in the wild Cornish
cove in No Man's Land. The book, however, is not to
be recommended to August visitors at popular watering-
places, for the author explains, with a frankness that might
depress them and spoil their holiday, that what is popularly
called the Seaside is all side and no sea.

. WANLEY ON WIT AND WISDOM.
“THE vein of wit doth not always answer a man's desire,
but at some times, while we are writing or speaking, some-
thing doth casually offer itself unto our thoughts, which,
perhaps, hath more of worth in it than we are able to
compass with the utmost vehemence of our meditation and
study. Facetious men have many such fortunate hits,
lighting on the sudden upon that which is more graceful
and pleasant to the hearer, than their more elaborate
endeavours would be.”
With the above paragraph the Rev. NATHANIEL WANLEY
begins the antepenultimate chapter of his famous and stu-
pendous book, entitled “The Wonders of the Little World;
or, A General History of Man. In Six Books.” My edition is
a fat quarto of 752 pages, including plates and an index, and
was published in 1788. The first edition was, I believe,
a folio published in 1678—two years, that is to say, before
Mr. WANLEY died at the unripe age of forty-six. It is an
amazing thought that in that comparatively short space of
time he should have found leisure for the compilation of
this monumental work, for he was also Vicar of Trinity
Parish, Coventry, and must have misspent some hours at
least in every week in attending to his parochial labours.
Even while he preached or expounded or visited he cannot
but have sighed to be back at “The General History
of Man.”
Certainly he had no mean design. The title-page sets
out that he proposes to display “The Various Faculties,
Capacities, Powers and Defects of the Human Body and
Mind, in several thousand most interesting Relations of
Persons remarkable for Bodily Perfections or Defects . .
or for extraordinary Virtues or Vices of the Mind . . . or
for uncommon Powers or Weakness of the Senses and
Affections,” together with an account of all sorts of
“other matters equally curious,” but too long to be
mentioned here. The whole was to form “A Complete
System of the Mental and Corporeal Powers and Defects
of Human Nature; and intended to increase Knowledge,
to promote Virtue, to discourage Vice, and to furnish
topics for innocent and ingenious Conversation.” A most
excellent clerical ambition.
My edition, published, as I say, more than a hundred
years after Mr. WANLEY's death, is commended to the
public by the editor in a preſace. Mr. WANLEY, it is here
stated, “ransacked the History of all Times and Nations,
and, at an expence of labour and learning which renders
him as great an instance of Human Industry as is to be
found even in his own Book, he has gleaned together several
thousand Historical Facts.” Mr. WANLEY, however, has
been expurgated, for “Notwithstanding our author's merit,
it must be acknowledged that he is not everywhere equally
happy in the choice of his stories, and that some immaterial
and disagreeable relations might be exchanged for such as
are more pertinent, interesting and entertaining.”
My editor adds that those who undertake the informa-
tion of men have a difficult task. “For the subject,” he
says, “is so obnoxious to error, the track so rough and
uneven, and readers so prepossessed with prejudices,
jealousies and censoriousness, that the diligent collectors of
such examples oftener meet with reproaches than testi-
monies of gratitude; this is probably occasioned by vanity
and fondness of philosophizing upon matters of fact, and
being more curious to find cut the reason of things than
the truth of them. But though it is an argument of
ingenuity to search into the reason and cause of things,
yet it is absurdity and folly to be invincible opiniators
against manifest convictions, or to think Omnipotency
cannot do what he pleases, because some men are resolved
to be blind, and will not believe what they see.” I would
rather face a blow from the fist of the world's heavy-weight
champion than get in the way of that last massive and
majestic sentence. Who, after reading it, would dare to be
an invincible opiniator against manifest convictions?
Mr. WANLEY's antepenultimate chapter, from which I
have already given an extract, treats “of the witty Speeches
or Replies suddenly made by some Persons.” Here is one
of his examples:—“One asked a noble sea-captain, ‘Why,
having means sufficient to live upon the land, he would yet
endanger his person upon the ocean 2'. He told him ‘That
he had a natural inclination to it, and therefore nothing
could divert him.’ “I pray,' said the other, “where died
your father?’ ‘At sea,' said the Captain. “And where
your grandfather?’ ‘At sea also,' said he. “And," said
the other, “are you not for that cause afraid to go to sea 2 '
‘Before I answer you,' said the Captain, ‘I pray tell me
where died your father ?’ ‘In bed,” said he. “And where
your grandfather?’ ‘In his bed,” said he, ‘also." And said
the Captain, ‘Are you not afraid for that cause to go to
bed ”’ ” It was a hit—a palpable hit, but it may be urged
that the noble sea-captain was not very sudden about it. He
took his time to lay his train and apply the match, and
the landsman must have known what was coming some
moments before the charge exploded.
Here is another told in Mr. WANLEY's most characteristic
style: “The Spaniards sided with the Duke of Mayenne
and the rest of those rebels in France who called themselves
the Holy League; and a French gentleman being asked the
causes of their civil broils, with an excellent allusion he
replied, ‘They were Spania and Mania,' seeming by this
answer to signify they were Xravia penury, and Mavia
fury, which are indeed the causes of all intestine tumults,
but slily therein implying the King of Spain and the Duke
of Mayenne.” Could there be a more benevolent amenity
than that with which our collector makes the witty reply
clear to the most pedestrian intelligence 2
My third and final story comes from the chapter “Of the
wise Speeches, Sayings and Replies of several Persons.”
It shows, I am afraid, that Mr. WANLEY was a non-resist-
ance and passive-obedience man;– When Theopompus
was King of Sparta, one was saying in his presence that
‘it now went well with their City because their Kings had
learned how to govern.' The King prudently replied, that
‘it rather came to pass because their people had learned
how to obey:’ shewing thereby, that populous Cities are
most injurious to themselves by their factious disobedience;
which, while they are addicted to, they are not easily well
governed by the best of magistrates.”
“To B1:1(; HTEN THE EY Es.— Milk, 1 oz. : hot water, 1 oz. Mix and
bathe the eyes while the mixture is still warm.”— Iſomon's Life.
And if you should get the eyes badly mixed and put the
right one back in the left socket, so much the better.
A little change brightens them up wonderfully.
“One can watch the huntsman and almost read his thoughts while
cantering ever so easily ºn a carpet ºf a thousand springs, with a proud
neck arching gently to the rein.”—Jſ cat Somerset Free Press.
The writer must be very careful how he archés his neck.
It soon grows into a habit.

THE HOUSE WARMING.
W.—UNINVITED GUESTs.
“NINE,” said Archie, separating his
latest victim from the marmalade spoon
and dropping it into the hot water.
“This is going to be a sanguinary day.
With a pretty late cut into the peach
jelly Mr. A. Mannering reached double
figures. Ten. Battles are being won
while Thomas still sleeps. Any advance
on ten ?”
“Does that include my wasp?” asked
Myra.
“There are only ten here,” said
Archie, looking into the basin, “and
they're all mine. I remember them
perfectly. What was yours like?"
“Well, I didn't exactly kill him.
I smacked him with a teaspoon and
told him to go away. And he went on
to your marmalade, so I expect you
thought he was yours. . But it was
really mine, and I don't think it's very
nice of you to kill another person's
wasp.”
“Have one of mine,” I said, pushing
my plate across. “Have Bernard—
he's sitting on the greengage."
“I don't really want to kill anything.
I killed a rabbit once and I wished I
hadn't.”
“I nearly killed a rabbit once, and I
wished I had.”
“Great sportsmen at a glance,” said
Archie. “Tell us about it before it
goes into your reminiscences.”
“It was a fierce affair while it lasted.
The rabbit was sitting down and I was
standing up, so that I rather had the
advantage of him at the start. I waited
till he seemed to be asleep and then
fired.”
“And missed him 2 ''
“Y-yes. He heard the report, though.
I mean, you mustn't think he ignored
me altogether. I moved him. He got
up and went away all right."
“A very lucky escape for you," said
Archie. “I once knew a man who
was gored to death by an angry rabbit.”
He slashed in the air with his napkin.
“Fifteen. Dahlia, let's have breakfast
indoors to-morrow. This is very jolly
but it's just as hot, and it doesn't get
Thomas up any earlier, as we hoped."
All that day we grilled in the heat.
Myra and I started a game of croquet
in the morning, but after one shot each
it was agreed to abandon it as a draw
—slightly in my favour, because I had
given her the chipped mallet. And in the
afternoon, Thomas and Simpson made
a great effort to get up enthusiasm for
lawn tennis. Each of them returned
the other's service into the net until
the score stood at eight all, at which
point they suddenly realised that no-
thing but the violent death of one of
the competitors would ever end the
match. They went on to ten all to make
sure, and then retired to the lemonade
and wasp jug, Simpson missing a
couple of dead bodies by inches only.
And after dinner it was hotter than
ever.
“The heat in my room,” announced
Archie, “breaks all records. The
thermometer says a hundred and fifty,
the barometer says very dry, we've
had twenty-five hours' sunshine, and
there's not a drop of rain recorded in
the soap-dish. Are we going to take
this lying down?”
“No,” said Thomas, “let’s sleep out
to-night.”
“What do you say, Dahlia?”
“It's a good idea. You can all
sleep on the croquet lawn, and Myra
and I will take the tennis lawn.”
“Hadn't you better have the croquet
lawn 2 Thomas walks in his sleep, and
we don't want to have him going
through hoops all night.”
“You'll have to bring down your
own mattresses,” went on Dahlia, “and
you've not got to walk about the garden
in the early morning, at least not until
Myra and I are up, and if you're going
to fall over croquet hoops you mustn't
make a noise. That's all the rules, I
think.”
“I’m glad we've got the tennis
lawn,” said Myra; “it’s much smoother.
Do you prefer the right-hand court,
dear, or the left-hand 2 ”
“We shall be very close to nature
to-night,” said Archie. “Now we shall
know whether it really is the nightjar,
or Simpson gargling.”
We were very close to nature that
night, but in the early morning still
closer. I was awakened by the noise
of Simpson talking, as I hoped, in his
sleep. However, it appeared that he
was awake and quite conscious of the
things he was saying.
“I can't help it,” he explained to
Archie, who had given expression to
the general opinion about it; “these
bally wasps are all over me.”
“It's your own fault,” said Archie.
“Why do you egg them on ? I don't
have wasps all over me.”
“Conf There! I've been stung.”
“You’ve been what ?”
“Stung.”
“Stung. Where?”
“In the neck.”
“In the neck.” Archie turned over
to me. “Simpson,” he said, “has been
stung in the neck. Tell Thomas.”
I woke up Thomas. “Simpson,” I
said, “has been stung in the neck.”
“Good,” said Thomas, and went to
sleep again.
“We’ve told Thomas,” said Archie.
“Now are you satisfied ?”
“Get away, you brute," shouted
Simpson suddenly, and dived under
the sheet.
Archie and I lay back and shouted
with laughter. -
“It's really very silly of him,” said
Archie, “because—go away—because
everybody knows that—get away, you
ass – that wasps aren't dangerous
unless—confound you—unless I
say, isn't it time we got up?'"
I came up from under my sheet and
looked at my watch. “Four-thirty,’
I said, dodged a wasp, and went back
again.
“We must wait till five-thirty,” said
Archie. “Simpson was quite right; he
was stung, after all. I'll tell him so."
He leant out of bed to tell him so, and
then thought better of it and retired
beneath the sheets.
At five-thirty a gallant little party
made its way to the house, its mat-
tresses over its shoulders.
“Gently,” said Archie, as we came
in sight of the tennis-lawn.
We went very gently. There were
only wasps on the tennis-lawn, but one
does not want to disturb the little
fellows. A. A. M.
THE CUSTOM HOUSE.
THE Custom House in Billingsgate
Is very large and very great,
All summer its electrics swish
To dissipate the smell of fish.
Outside the streets are glaring, grim,
Inside it's cool and wide and dim,
And all its rooms have swinging doors,
And disinfectants on the floors.
From its front windows one may see
The Thames as muddy as can be;
Its clerks are very cross and sour,
And keep you waiting half-an-hour.
But you may watch the tramps go by
For Christiansund or Uruguay,
Or read, what most my fancy stirs,
The “Notices to Mariners.”
These tell of buoys and lights and quays,
For those in “peril of the seas,"
They caution captains, and convict
The sunken shoal or derelict.
And as you read them you may reach
A Greenland floe, a coral beach,
The breeze that stirs the tamarinds,
Or rushing, grey Atlantic winds.
And so the Custom House, you see,
Seems quite a pleasant place to me;
I won't mind waiting—no, not I,
An hour beneath an August sky.

INFANT PRODIGIES.
THE July number of the American
Magazine contains an interesting ac-
count by Professor WIENER of the
exceptionally early mental development
When he was
one day amused herself by making
| letters in the sand of the seashore.
She noticed that he was watching her
attentively, and in fun began to teach
him the alphabet. Two days after-
wards she told me in great surprise
that he knew it perfectly. Thinking
that this was an indication that it
! would not be hard to interest him in
! reading, I started teaching him how to
i spell at the age of three. In a very few
weeks he was reading quite fluently,
† and by six was acquainted with a num-
ber of excellent books, including works
by DARwiN, RIBoT, and other scientists,
which I put into his hands in order to
| instil in him something of the scien-
tific spirit.”
Private inquiries, conducted at great
expense by one of Mr. Punch's most
trusted representatives, have resulted
in the gratifying discovery that this
precocity is by no means confined to
denizens of the Great Republic, but has
been displayed by several of England's
greatest living luminaries.
At the tender age of fourteen months
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE electrified his nurse
by enunciating in a clear treble voice
the startling sentiment, “A hereditary
aristocracy is a contradiction in terms
and is doomed to speedy extinction.”
With these words he seized his toy
spade—the incident occurred on the
sands at Llandudno—and demolished
an elaborate sand castle which he had
erected by his unaided exertions.
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, at the age
of two, petrified his tutor by com-
mitting to memory the whole of
GIBBoN's monumental history, and tak-
ing the Emperor JULIAN as his hero
and model. In his third year, however,
he developed strong pietistic tendencies,
and during a summer holiday spent on
Dartmoor immersed himself in Pastoral
Theology, and translated the Septuagint
into the Devonshire dialect. At the
age of five he was admitted into an
Orange Lodge, but quitted it after a few
weeks and declared himself a supporter
of Mr. PARNELL. While serving as a
volunteer in the Expeditionary Force
to Egypt in 1882, he was converted to
Unionism and remained rooted in this
heresy until 1905.
Mr. LULU HARCOURT's pronounced
democratic tendencies manifested them-
selves at an unusually early age. Thus
in the choice of playmates he evinced
a marked preference for children of
“Would YoU REcogxISE THE BAND THIS MORNING, SII: ' "

humble origin, and in moments of
expansion would even go so far as to
allow them to play with his superb
diamond-hilted gold rattle. It is under-
stood that his parents' decision to send
him to Eton caused him deep grief, as
it was his dearest desire to go to a
board-school, and his antipathy to
aristocratic surroundings found vent
in the expression of opinions which
shocked his tutor inexpressibly. Always
a convinced believer in the simple life,
he adopted a Spartan rigour in his diet,
seldom indulging in more than five ices
at a time and only partaking of caviare
twice or at most three times a week.
Another distinguished Etonian, Sir
HUBERT PARRY, was noted for his
musical precocity. The first time he
ever heard a donkey bray he was in his
bath, being then only eight months
old, and he immediately sang the
interval of the subm-rged tenth—that
given out by the quadruped — with
startling fidelity. Three months later he
was able to play all BACH's Forty-eight
Preludes and Fugues on a mouth-organ.
He mastered the penny whistle in a
single afternoon, and after that never
looked back. Taking his Mus. Bac.
degree before he went into knicker-
bockers he immortalized himself at
Eton, where he was captain of the
Wall team, by inventing a new method
of kicking the ball backwards, to which
he gave the name of the contra-punt.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. August 23, 1911.
AN OLD BALL.
A GoLF IDYLL.
WELL, you shall have the story of the ball.
It seems a curious trophy, does it not,
To keep among my treasures of the past
In yonder cabinet 2 Scarred, battered, gashcl,
Spoiled with ignoble usage of the club,
Old-fashioned, too—ah me, I had almost
Forgotten it was there. But you shall hear.
I was not ever scratch, as I am now.
Far from it. Through a long novitiate
My golf was vile; and gods, how I could slice'
That was at once my shame and my despair;
Shame for the dangers that I cast abroad,
Despair of that eternal “rough,” the time
I spent in looking for the balls I lost,
The money that I lost in losing them,
Not to say, temper. .
One wild afternoon
Into a crosswise wind I drave. The ball
Leapt from the tee and swung, like one possessed,
In mad abandonment towards the off,
Where, on a green impossibly remote,
(Or so it seemed) in awkward stance there stood
A maiden putting. Round that fairy form
The strange thing, hissing like a Catherine wheel,
In lessening spiral rushed—against that form
Rudely impinged, and so accosted earth.
And thither, to retrieve that cursed ball,
I, with disarming smile and cap in hand,
A mincing shape of crushed apology,
Approached, and made expressions of remorse
Such as a maid might swallow. Her three friends
Darkly opposed me with a hostile glare;
But not so she. She heard me to the end;
Then raised her eyes—eyes of a most deep blue—
And said it didn't matter, and forgave.
So for the nonce I left her. All that round,
I could not keep my mind upon the game,
Or eye upon the ball. Of her I thought,
Her voice, her smile, her pardon, and I played
On with the ball that smote her, hewed and hacked,
And, at the close, 'twas as you see it now.
But when the round had ended in defeat
At the club house I met her, and I learned,
She, too, was a beginner. I proposed
A match, the first of many. Day by day
In pleasing concord of inferior golf
We, being equal in our lack of skill,
Together ploughed the ineffectual sand,
Harried the sod, and laboured through the rough,
While each in healing sympathy consoled
The other's failures with “Oh, crushing luck,”
“Hard lines,” and “Ah, th’ abominable lie,”
And all such kindly flatteries, till, at last,
(Both being bunkered at the fourteenth hole)
I told her that I loved her. She was kind.
And in that bunker we became engaged.
So for a pleasant season all was well.
But, of a sudden—how I know not—I
Regan to get the better of my ball;
Put off the novice; and, of my success,
Was born the baffling magic of the game.
I grew impatient at the loss of time
Spent in retrieving balls from that vile rough
Wherein she sliced them—slicing was her fault,
It was ridiculous—and I began
To pine for foes more worthy of my skill,
To teel some ire at being thus kept back
By an inferior player. I proposed
To give her lessons. She resented that.
Indeed, it bred a coolness; and, at last,
(She being bunkered at the fourteenth hole)
We had some words, and parted, not in peace.
She sent me back my presents. They were few.
I had not known her long enough for more.
A ring, a dressing-case, a set of clubs,
Some cunning treatises upon the game,
“Golf for Beginners,” “Illustrated Faults.”
And others that I gave her for her good;
And, with the rest, a gashed and battered ball,
My earliest gift, the scarred and sacred thing
Through whose wild office we were introduced.

SAUCE OF THE SEA.
(To almost any Maritime Landlady.)
Ou, not the virtues of the air,
Though that, of course, is extra bracing,
Have charmed us most, my lady fair,
In these apartments rich and rare
The briny sea-front facing.
And greatly as we loved the golf,
And cared not though that hearty drunkard
The high Nor'-Easter put us off,
And placed us in the hopeless trough
Where all bad drives are bunkered:
Not these—nor yet the sheer delight
Of floating where the sea-mew flickers,
Of tussling with the breaker's might
(The town forgotten)—wearing tight
Vermilion-coloured knickers:
Not these, I say, though all were grand,
Enraptured so a brace of quiet
Young gentlemen at Slush-on-Strand
As this—the savour of the sand,
You mingled with our diet.
At first we did not care for it:
Unused to so sublime a relish,
We grumbled, when we came to grit
Our grinders on a hefty bit
Of foreshore, saying “Hellish.”
But by-and-by we came to see
Its tonic worth ; we ceased to cavil;
We took two spoonfuls with our tea,
We crunched it in our cake with glee,
We gloated on the gravel.
Our faces blossomed like the peach,
We've told your tiny daughter Elsie
To put us up a pint for each
Of Slush-on-Strand's salubrious beach
To carry home to Chelsea.
But still, O lady of the fads
And somewhat statuesque proportions,
Have mercy on a pair of lads
What time your artless fancy adds
The total of extortions.
Temember, though we had our fill,
Whate'er the usual price per plate is,
I'... costs you absolutely nil.
So do not charge it in the bill,
But put down “Sea-shore gratis.”

ODE TO A MOUTHFUL OF SEA-WATER TAKEN
INVOLUNTARILY.
Thou sloppy spilth of bitter Stygian floods!
Thou—thou—just wait until I've ceased to splutter,
Just wait a bit, I say, and I will stutter
Those terse, tremendous words which strong men
mutter -
(E.g., what time they strive with dress-shirt studs),
And I will think those things one does not utter
But simply chews as cows their juicy cuds,
And keeps in close-locked lips like canker-worms in buds.
Some moments since I think you would not find
A happier than I: the sun was beaming,
The sea and my strong cleaving arms were gleaming,
The gulls (and all the lady bathers) screaming,
The air was warm and Nature seemed most kind.
And then—then as I wallowed, idly dreaming,
A little wave came unawares behind
And slopped Thee down my throat, superlatively brined.
O sudden sorry sickening effect!
O cruelly unkind iconoclasm
What grievous gulp, what nauseating spasm,
What tainted void, and oh! how sour a chasm
Hast Thou enforced ' What pleasure hast Thou checkt
Such are my feelings now, and whoso has 'em
Feels that his joie de vivre is wholly wreckt:

ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M. P.
House of Commons, Monday, ºn
14th August.—In Committee of
Supply CHANCELLOR moves vote
for mere trifle over a quarter
of a million for payment of
Members' salaries. Exception
taken with respect to form of
procedure. Urged that proposal
should be presented as a Bill,
not a Resolution. TIM HEALY
agrees, but explains that if that
course had been adopted the
Bill would have gone on to
Lords, who in pre ent temper
might have thrown it out.
A Resolution passed through
Committee of Supply would not
come before them.
CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER
blushed. Hoped that perhaps
nobody would have thought of
that.
In able speech delivered last
Thursday, when question first
came before House, ARTHUR
LEE gave illuminating particu-
lars of how in Australia appetite
in this matter grows with what
it feeds upon. The Member for
Sark, supporting Wol,MER's motion to
reduce vote by £100,000, showed how
in France development is even more
advanced. To begin with, French
Deputés voted themselves annual wage
of 9,000 francs, equal to £350 English.
Four years ago proposal was suddenly
sprung upon the Chamber to increase
the amount to 15,000 francs (£600).
On what Deputés lament as a snap
division the motion was carried and
remains in force to this day.
“Here comes along Booth with conundrum.”
(Mr. F. HANDEI, Booth.)
LLOYD GEORGE c. ANI, B. HEALY.
“Chancellor of Exchequer blushed.”
Members of the Right and Right
Centre find double satisfaction in the
episode. From their place in the
Chamber they hotly denounced spolia-
tion of National Purse; privily they
pocket the extra 6,000 francs. The
Parisians, who, otherwise helpless, are
ever ready to avenge themselves by
launching a mot, scornfully call the
Deputés “les Quinze Milles.”
Business done.—House of 369 Mem-
bers resolve by majority 113 to pay

Tuesday. — Already payment of
Members turns up with controversial
point. Resolution adopted yesterday
authorised allotment “to Members not
in receipt of salaries as Ministers or
officers of the House.” Here comes
along Booth with conundrum sub-
mitted to Chair. When is a Minister
not a Minister? Are the PATRONAGE
SECRETARY and the FINANCIAL SECRE-
TARY TO THE TREASURY, together with
whole batch of Under-Secretaries,
Ministers within meaning of Resolu-
tion ? If not, will they, in addition to
receipt of salary, pocket £400 a year?
For once SPEAKER baffled.
“They certainly are not Ministers of
the Crown,” he said. “Whether they
are Ministers or not I should not like
to say. I must take legal advice on
that matter.”
Pretty to see row of Under-
Secretaries crowding Treasury Bench
bending forward to catch SPEAKER's
ruling. Not for them to move
in the matter. Nobody hints
at such a thing as their having
put up Booth to raise questicn.
They don't ask for more than
their, possibly in adequate,
salaries paid quarterly. But
they feel it behoves them to
set the example of discipline
and obedience to authority. If
their more-than-ever esteemed
colleagues, the ATTo RNEY-
GENERAL and the SoLICITOR-
GENERAL, would be so good
as to advise the SPEAKER that,
not being Ministers of the
Crown, they shall be subjected
to indignity of having forced
upon them an additional wage
of £400 a year—well, all they
can say is that they are not the
men to add to embarrassment
of their beloved chief, especially
heavy at the moment, by raising
difficulties.

PERSONALITIES OF THE LAW.
(From the Layman's Point of View.)
THE JUDGEs.
These are neither born nor made.
They are a class apart, not subject to
the ordinary rule of human existence.
| The first remark that Mr. JUSTICE
SWINFEN EADY made, upon assuming
1 the outward form of a common male
baby, was “Bring me an Equity of
Redemption, please,” and someone
immediately did so in fear and
trembling. What is admired in
Counsel who dares to withstand a
Judge of the High Court is just that
touch of bravado which King CANUTE
lacked. As for the inseparable and
infallible trio, Lords Justices WAUGHAN
WILLIAMs, FLETCHER MoULTON and
| BUCKLEY, breath cannot be sufficiently
bated to speak of them at all. One
dare only feel a secret pity for men
who can have never known the pleasure
of doing, saying, thinking or feeling
anything wrong.
THE JURY
also is neither born nor made. It is
one of those unfortunate and inex-
plicable things which have happened
and cannot be helped. Its entire com-
petence is limited to the one extra-
ordinary capacity for believing im-
plicitly any old lie.
THE BAR: KING's Counsel.
There are only two King's Counsel.
Their names are Sir EDwARD CARson
and F. E. SMITH. There was once,
indeed, a man whose name was RUFUs
ISAACs. He showed promise, but be-
came Attorney-General.
THE JUNIor BAR.
This consists of a number of men
from twenty-five to twenty-eight years
of age, all destined for the Woolsack.
One by one they despair of success
and are just about to give in altogether,
when their great opportunity comes.
A beautiful wife murders an ugly hus-
band, who richly deserved all he got.
The briefless junior, next on the rota
for promotion, is briefed by an intelli-
gent solicitor for the defence. Amidst
a tense silence the junior rises to
address a jury, already determined to
convict. The first word of the junior
makes them waver: the second turns
them round, and the third leaves them
clamouring for an acquittal. The face
in the dock gets paler and paler: the
hush gets tenser and tenser: somebody
faints: the junior is made a K.C. on
the spot and it is forgotten, in the
general excitement, that the lady did
murder the man. That, however, is
not important. Considering the regu-
larity of this occurrence, it is odd how
persistently the number of K.C.s sticks
at two.
THE SoDICITors.
All solicitors are rascals. The fact
that they work from 9.30 A.M. to 6 P.M.
on three hundred days of the year
makes one suspect something of this
sort. The fact that they expect to be
paid for it leaves no room for doubt.
I have it on the authority of a company
promoter, who makes eight thousand a
year without ever going near his office
in the City, that all solicitors are
rascals.
THE PLAINTIFF.
This is the man who appears to be
palpably too good to live, until it comes
to his cross-examination. During that,
it is clear to everyone, including him-
self, that he were better dead.
THE DEFENDANT.
During the first part of the case, this
man is fully occupied in marvelling how
people can bring themselves to tell such
gross and wicked lies with such obvious
ease. During the second half of the
case, he is generally occupied in dis-
covering that the telling of lies is not
such an easy matter as he supposed.
THE WITNESS.
To be a witness is to discover for the
first time what a blackguard you have
been in the past, without knowing it.
It is also to discover that very few
people love you, and no one trusts you.
If the witness happens to be yourself,
however, you have the permanent
satisfaction of knowing that you scored
off everybody, and particularly off the
unscrupulous fool who cross-examined
you and was one too few for you.
THE USHER.
The point of view of the Usher is
entirely detached and pessimistic. He
has no illusions and no faith in
humanity. He spends his life in
saying “Hush, hush ' " and expecting
no result. There was once an usher
who smiled, but he was very young and
only just beginning.
THE MAN IN THE Dock
is always innocent, and
THE PolicE CoNSTABLE
is never telling the truth.
MARINE METAMORPHOSIS.
A MoDERN maid of high degree
One day went bathing in the sea.
Her toilette (g'acé with insertion)
Seemed too expensive for submersion.
But first with rounded cheeks and care
She filled her water-wings with air.
And slipping same beneath each shoulder
Allowed the surges to enfold her.
Till, well beyond the shining strand,
She swam (with one foot on the sand).
Now, as the maiden was arriving
Close to a springboard meant for diving,
A young Greek god in bathing kit
With easy grace climbed on to it.
His curls were clustring gold and shiny,
His eyes were azure as the briny.
His build was clean, his skin was tanned,
He looked accustomed to command.
The maiden, swimming by, as stated,
Was absolutely captivated.
And, struck by this and other things,
She promptly lost her water wings.
At first it seemed a real disaster,
They floated seaward, fast and faster,
Until with trudgeon stroke astute
The Greek god started in pursuit.
How anxiously she watched his dear
head
Go bobbing almost to the pier head.
He brought them back, and quite pooh-
oolhed
Her shy but heartfelt gratitude.
She was enraptured that she'd seen a
Delightful Deus ex machind.
She felt in fact she'd met her fate,
He, only, was her bosom's mate.
To meet again, her soul was maddened,
But when they did, she wished they
hadn't,
For down her rainbow castle fell—
He was the “Boots" at her hotel.

I was wandering idly in Greenwich
Park, late in the afternoon of one of
these hot days, when I came upon him.
He was seated in the shade of the
Observatory, and was noticeable not
only for his long, white beard, which
would have drawn attention to him
anywhere, but for a certain anger in
his mien, unusual in so aged a man.
In one hand he held a halfpenny even-
ing paper, which a boy had just sold
him, and beside him was a scythe, left,
as I conjectured, by one of the park
Inen.
I was strolling quietly by when he
called to me. “You, Sir, you know
London, perhaps ? Tell me this, Sir,”
and he shook the paper fiercely at me
as though I was its editor.
I stopped and listened for more.
“This, Sir,” he said, pointing his
thumb at a lozenge in the top right-
hand corner of the first page. “What
does it say? Your eyes are stronger
than mine.”
“It says,” I replied, “6.30 edition.’”
“There ! ” he exclaimed, with the
first suggestion of satisfaction in his
tone. “Then I'm not going blind.
‘6.30'2 Very well, Sir. And now
will you kindly add to your courtesy
by telling me what your watch says?”
I pulled out my watch and found
that it was twenty to seven.
He grunted. “Now one farther
question,” he said. “How far is the
printing office of this paper from the
place where we are now talking 2"
I hazarded eight miles.
He grunted again. “That is to say,”
he remarked, “that half an hour at
least would be required to get the paper
to Greenwich purchasers?”
“Quite,” I said.
He raged again. “And I bought it,”
he said, “a quarter of an hour ago!”
He was furious. His old eyes blazed,
his old cheeks crimsoned, his old beard
crisped and curled. “So it's a lie,” he
shouted, “this ‘6.30’—a lie l’’
“I'm afraid it's a little misleading,”
I said.
“A lie, I call it,” he continued.
“Don’t mince words, Sir. No doubt
you who live in London are prepared
for these swindles. You have no
objection to false pretences. You are
not offended by being asked a half-
penny for news up to 6.30 and getting
it only up to 5.45. But I am, and for
a very good reason. It's an attack on
me, Sir. It hurts me personally. It
undermines my reputation. It ruins
my credit. I—I won't stand it, Sir.
Something must be done.”

him making it such a personal matter.
“Do you hear me, Sir 2" he roared.
“Yes,” I said, “I do. But it's
nothing to do with me. I'm not the
responsible person.”
“Yes, you are, Sir,” he answered.
“So long as you buy these untruths
and do not revolt, you are responsible,
and don't you forget it. It's gone too

And he rose muttering, flung the

[AUGUST 23, 1911.
THE STRIPED PERI[..
The recent outbreak of wasp-activity has at last roused
popular opinion. Looking ahead we anticipate some such
extracts as the following from an issue of The Daily
Telegraph in the near future:–
GoverNMENT AND THE WASPs.
Mr. Chose (U.) asked the PRIME MINISTER whether his
attention had been called to the case of an elderly
gentleman in South Warwickshire, who was wantonly
attacked by wasps when breakfasting al fresco in his own
grounds, and whether, in view of this event, he proposed
to take any steps to safeguard the lives and property of
private citizens. (Opposition cheers.)
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, who replied, said that the whole
matter was at present engaging the earnest attention of
His Majesty's Government.
Mr. WEdgwood (R.): Will the right hon. gentleman
see that in any arrangements come to the right of the
British wasp to sting remains untouched 2
Mr. KEIR HARDIE asked the Home Secretary whether it
was the fact that on the occasion in question marmalade
was employed by the breakfasters, and whether, having
regard to the notoriously inflammatory influence of this
practice on wasps, he wou'd take measures to render it
penal, and to confiscate all stores of the compound at
present in the hands of private owners? (Labour and
Ministerial cheers.)
Mr. CHURCHILL : I trust that no special steps, of this or
any other kind, will now be necessary.
Mr. J. R. MAcDoNALD (Labour): Has the right hon.
gentleman any information as to how the incident com-
menced, and will he, in view of the unanimous opinion, on
one side of the House, that the wasps are being unfairly
treated (cries of “Oh ' ') have the Warwickshire gentleman
arrested at once, and a special inquiry made into the conduct
of the local police 2
Mr. CHURCHILL : No, Sir. , (Opposition cheers.)
From the leading Article.
“The deplorable and indeed scandalous facts which we
publish to-day, together with the discussion in the House
of Commons, as reported in another column, may well give
reasonable men, of whatever political complexion, pause.
Far indeed be it from us to create party capital out of a
situation as menacing as any in which this country has
found itself during centuries; but the stern fact remains
that history will know what interpretation to place upon
the extraordinary and lamentable supineness of the present
so-called Administration. Enough The Veto Bill has
come and gone, but the wasps remain, and their presence
provides at once a problem and a trumpet-call to the leaders
and press of the great Conservative party, of which we
shall be surprised indeed if they prove unworthy. Let
Mr. BALFour once declare himself as the unwavering
champion of open-air tea drinkers, and we are convinced
that the battle is already in our hands. . . . .”
Correspox DENCE.
THE VICARAGE, BUzzINGTON.
DEAR SIR,- In view of the unprotected state of the
country-side at the present moment, it may interest your
readers to know that my wife and I have been obliged to
take the law into our own hands, and procure the assist-
ance of two highly-trained and powerful hornets. These
intrepid and intelligent little die-hards, whom we have
named respectively Garvin and Effie, have for the past
week kept our breakfast room entirely free from intruders.
I am, Sir, Yours faithfully,
(REv.) R. SPALDING.
DEAR SIR,-Much as I was interested in your recent
correspondent's account of his method of wasp extermina-
tion, I still think my own at once the more sporting and
deadly. Having filled several shallow jars with a mixture
in equal parts of curacoa, raspberry jam, and Ono's fruit
salt, I place these in an exposed position on my lawn, at a
calculated distance from a 9-7 gun which was presented to
me, as their commander, by the local yeomanry at the
conclusion of the Boer War. Having thus baited the
ground I have but to wait until the enemy has assembled
in sufficiently dense formation, load my weapon with small
duck-shot, and bang into the yellow.
Yours, etc.,
“READY, AYE READY.”
DEAR SIR,-My personal way with wasps, which I have
found invariably successful, is to hit at them with a tea-
spoon and scream loudly. Somebody is then almost certain
to come, and either drive them away or at least distract
their attention. I have no doubt there must be many
women who will be glad to learn of this simple and effective
expedient.
Yours very sincerely,
“WHY SHOULD Wom EN WAIT 2 ''
TO AN UNJUST JUDGE.
TIE sun was shining brightly o'er the lea,
And pretty little songbirds flew about,
And everything was happy as could be
Till I received a ball upon the knee,
And you were umpire, and you gave me out.
'O stonyhearted, have you never caught
Your first delivery a frightful blow,
A splendid boundary, perhaps, and thought,
“Now they shall see me scoring as I ought,”
And then been suddenly compelled to go?
If you have taken one upon the knee,
And lost the verdict, as I hope you havo,
With your Maria watching, you'll agree
That it was very, very hard on me
With mine, my Helen, sitting in the pav.
You know how poisonous my luck has been,
What with the googly and the latest lob,
You know that, though particularly keen,
Whenever Helen is upon the scene,
I'm out for four—or two—or simply blob.
This was the day to fill her heart with pride,
And then you do a silly thing like that,
I\nowing the ball was simply yards outside,
(Myself, I should have given it a wide),
And, anyhow, I hit it with the bat.
Yet in my heart I thank you for the deed,
The ball which followed had a nasty twist;
It shot past Bunnie at a fearſul speed,
Laying his wicket prone upon the mead,
And I should certainly have been dismiss'd.
T}ut, having told her what I think of you
And your decision, I shall feel consoled,
When Helen murmurs, taking up the cue,
“Oh, how unfair, dear!"—which she couldn't do
If I had been just obviously bowled.
“There is no doubt that the King of Spain is devoted to yachting,
and it was noticed that his hands are quite blistered from holding the
rudder of the Hispania."—1)uily Mail.
Clinging to the rudder under water must be very cool and
jolly.

Now when the street-pent airs blow

Then let the rover's call prevail

That bids us spread the silken sail
For bays o'er which the seabirds soar,

It had all happened in five minutes.
And now, the line in the local paper
that had turned the hearts of Hortensia's
friends into incubators of envy, and
filled with exaltation Hortensia's own,
came home to roost and rankle—
“The happy couple will proceed for their
honeymoon to the Italian Lakes–fit setting
for a poet and his bride.”
There was nothing wrong with the
Italian Lakes. They had been heaven
—until five minutes ago. The poet
could be seen in a boat at the foot of
the olive-clad hill even now, awaiting
the signal of her coming.
And yet Hortensia gazed out over the
waters beyond him, with the despair of
disillusionment in her drear dramatic
eyes.
She turned over again the rustling
papers on her lap. Yes, there was no
doubt of it. This was a draft of the
letter he had written her the day before
the wedding. That, of the one he had
sent on her birthday. They were all
there. She had come across them as,

desk to seek a missing pen. She had

“shy mouse,” a “timid sparrow,” and
heaven knows what, before he had hit
upon the “hawk-affrighted dove.”"
Oh, it was horrible. She had been
tricked—entrapped. The “poet" was
just an industrious man.

bundled the papers into the waste-paper

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Frobisher Thaile was a self-absorbed and super-cultered
gentleman who collected rare things and talked about them
unendingly, to the martyrdom of his wife and daughter,
especially daughter. So when Patience went on a visit to
a German garrison town, and was there fallen in love with
by a jocund and entirely unartistic officer, she found the
change so fascinating that she decided to marry him.
That is the first half of Her Husband's Country (HEINE-
MANN); the disillusionment of Patience (who by the way is
very ill-named) makes up the rest of an amusing and
brightly written story. SYBIL SPOTTIswooDE, as you will
probably remember, has told us one or two of these Anglo-
German tales before; but none better than this. The life
of poor Patience as Frau Leutnant von Rabenstedt, and the
society of Stelnitz in general, is most entertainingly drawn;
ment of the most vindictive reader.
catastrophe was broken to her should fulfil every require- |
Though I should
perhaps hardly regard The Real Mrs. Holyer as a realistic
presentment of contemporary life, it is at least excellently
entertaining as fiction.
I've always thought the '45,
The year which brought the YoUNG PRETENDER,
Was understood to be alive
With battle-cries of “no surrender ’’;
Yet, if you take it day by day,
As SUTCLIFFE, in The Lone Adventure
(From UNwiN), I regret to say
You'll note a flaw in the indenture.
I looked for hourly thrills, and found,
While CHARLIE marched with GEORGE pursuing,
For quite three-quarters of the ground
Much high-flown talk, but little doing;
perhaps of all the scenes
Indeed, if nothing else
the one I liked most was
that in which the young
couple are welcomed home
from the honeymoon to
the little flat so lovingly
prepared and furnished
for them by kind old Frau
Treuberg. Stuffiness, and
the general horror of hope-
lessly uncongenial sur-
roundings, could hardly
be better conveyed. Of
course, through it all I
have an uneasy feeling
that I should like to read
a real German story giving
the other side; but that
is another matter. Per-
haps indeed (though I
suspect not) it was the
author's sense of fairness
which led her, in intro-
ducing two English people
occurred -
More lively than is here
related,
I give it as my final word
The '45 is overrated.
When I arrived, after
careful perusal, at page
317 of A Sereshan (MILLs
AND Boon) and there
read: “What with Görgey
advancing on Komorn,
while Raab is in their
hands again, old Every-
where-and-Nowhere Bem
smashing us in Transyl-
vania, and Perczel mak-
ing hay of our Serbs in
the south, we're in a
pretty bad way,” I be-
came suddenly aware that
I had no idea who or
what Görgey, Komorn,
at a critical moment in
Patience's affairs, to make
them talk like impossible
THE WORLD'S WORKERS.
IW.—AN ENTHUSIASTIC MEMBER OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOC:ETY TESTING
THE PROPERTIES OF A NEW BRAIN FOOD.
Raab, Bem, Perczel and
the Serbs might be. No
doubt I am a very ignor-
prigs. Still it remains
a thoroughly jolly book, which will find lots of friends.
It seems probable that the fascination of the Cinderella
story will never be exhausted. Apparently Mrs. FRANCIS
CHANNoN shares this view, since in The Real Mrs. Holyer
(Hutchinson), she allows us a double dose of the Cinderella
joy—the joy, that is, of watching the good person trampled
upon, with a comfortable certainty of her ultimate resilience.
Margery Lennard gave me this pleasing emotion twice, both
as the persecuted governess in the horrid Croome household,
when I knew that Denzil Holyer was really in love with her
and not with haughty Flora Croom”; and when, consider-
ably later, as Denzil's poor and snubbed widow, she turned
out to be a real ladyship and mother of a lord. Another
reason that should rightly make for the popularity of an
entertaining story is the melodramatic completeness with
which the ugly sisters (so to speak) are routed at the end—
a detail in which I have sometimes found such tales
disappointing. Flora was still sustaining this character,
as she had meantime married the gentleman who sup-
posed himself to have inherited the title actually belonging
to Margery's little son. The way in which this final
ant fellow, and careful
reference to an atlas and an encyclopædia from time to time
would have kept me informed as to what the military part of
the story was all about; but, what with the heat and innate
laziness, I looked to Mr. M. HARTLEY to tell me himself.
Nor can I understand his point of view. If he supposed
I did not know all about German, Hungarian, Austrian and
Croatian back-history, why did he not give me some con-
nected account of such of it as was relevant? If he
supposed I did know all about it, why did he fill two-
thirds of his book with the merest and least graphic précis
of casual and inconsequent incidents of it? The remaining
one-third made pleasant reading; indeed, the romance of
Mirko and Persida, of Lambert and Juliana and of
Jellachich and ambitious patriotism, might have been
quite engaging had it not been interrupted so continually
by the rest.

12UNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[August 30, 1911.
LOVE AND AGE.
“LovE is not like anything else, it is quite diffrant. It
is better than lessons or dancing or swimming but it is not
quite as good as stroberries or riding or jam. When you
want to keep other girls away from a boy then you are in
love with him but you must not kiss him. You must run
away from him but he generly catches you becaus boys
can run faster than girls. I have been in love three times
but I dont care much about it its such a truble. When
boys are in love they dont talk much but they stand and
look at you, then they send you a present sometimes its a
prarebook or about pirates and desert ilands. I think they
are silly.”
These words are taken from the unfinished MS. of The
Adventures of Isabel, a novel obviously designed on the
grand old deliberate plan by a young lady of nine. There
are only three pages of it, but beyond the opening state-
ment that “Isabel was formelly the dauter of a poor widow,
she was in love with Algernon,” there is no reference to the
heroine or her adventures. The rest consists of moralisings
and philosophical disquisitions. There can be no doubt as
to the essential truth and insight of the passage I have
ventured to quote. It shows an almost deadly com-
prehension of the essentials of the tender passion as dis-
played, not merely by boys and girls, but also by those
who either “run away" or “stand and look at you" at a
more advanced stage of life.
It might be interesting to enquire what is the earliest age
at which love can show itself. Boys, I believe, are more
| precocious than girls in this insanity. The little novelist
| already quoted evidently despised the whole silly business,
| and assigned to it its proper place, above dancing, but
below “stroberries.” At the age of nine a boy might well
be in love. DANTE was only nine when he saw BEATRICE
| and fell in love with her, and CANova used to say that he
| perfectly well remembered having been in love when but
| five years old. I draw these historical examples from a
| note to MooRE's Life of Byron.
| BYRON himself was, at the age of seven, madly in love
| with MARY DUFF. In a journal kept by him at the age of
twenty-five he writes: “I have been thinking lately a good
deal of Mary Duff. How very odd that I should have been
so utterly, devotedly fond of that girl at an age when I
could neither feel passion nor know the meaning of the
word. And the effect ' My mother used always to rally
me about this childish amour; and at last, many years
after, when I was sixteen, she told me one day, ‘Oh, Byron,
I have had a letter from Edinburgh, from Miss Abercromby,
and your old sweetheart Mary Duff is married to a Mr.
Coe.' And what was my answer 2 I really cannot explain
or account for my feelings at that moment; but they nearly
threw me into convulsions, and alarmed my mother so
much that after I grew better she generally avoided the
subject—to me—and contented herself with telling it to all
her acquaintances.”
“I had and have been attached,” he continues, “fifty
times since that period "-pretty good this, by the way, for
a youngster of twenty-five—“yet I recollect all we said to
each other, all our caresses, her features, my restlessness,
sleep'essness, my tormenting my mother's maid to write for
me to her, which she at last did to quiet me. My misery,
my love for that girl were so violent that I sometimes
doubt if I have ever been really attached since. Be that as
it may, hearing of her marriage several years after was like
a thunderstroke—it nearly choked me—to the horror of my
mother and the astonishment and aimost incredulity of
everybody”
I have never, I own, come across anyone else quite so
precocious and passionate as ByRoN, but there are plenty of
cases of love at the age of fourteen or fifteen in boys.
Take the writer of the following letter, for example. He
addresses his affection discreetly and indirectly to the
beloved object (aged 11) through her French governess and
in the French language, of which he is not a complete
master. On a previous occasion I published in these
columns a letter from the same hand describing a fight at
his school. The present letter also comes from the school:—
Ma CHERE MADAMoiselle, :
“Jespère que vous vous portez bien. Wous navez pas
didée comment je membete ici mais ne dites à personne.
Papa ma dit que je vais aux affaires en Septembre et je suis
content, car on n'est pas embeter après 5 heures et le
Samedi après midi aussi le Dimanche, caricion est embeter
toute la semaine méme les Dimanches Dites; je prends
la libertée décrire à Madamoiselle Maude car jai trouver 3
plumes comme elle aime et comme elle ma demander de lui
en donner, et comme c'est au monsieurs de faire ce qu'une
demoiselle vous demande je vais les envoyer par la poste.
Veuillez la faire me repondre car jaimerais savoire comment
elle va car je sais si vous ne le rapellez pas elle ne me
repondra pas car nous sommes tous jeunes et des enfants. |
Il y a un des eleves qui ma dit que Madamoiselle Maude
etait Hot Stuff voulant dire quelle etait gentille et ma
blaguer. Excusez monecriture sil vous plait. Au revoire.”
Somehow I can't help feeling sure that no proper
acknowledgment of the three pens was ever sent to the
giver.
THE POOR MAN's PARTRIDGE.
To marksmanship of any sort my hobby is not spurred,
I scarcely know a gun from a repeater, . . . . .
And more than that, I'll own that, far from bringing down
a bird - - - -
I doubt if I could even shoot a beater.
But the first day of September grants an often blighted
wish ;
While other gourmands gloat upon a partridge,
I welcome thee, my fancy, that art neither flesh nor fish,
Nor owest thy quietus to a cartridge.
The loss of thee my summer invariably mars;
Each rosy dawn, for me, breaks grey and chilling
The while the barren months that lack those necessary “r's"
Their dilatory moments are fulfilling.
Until one radiant morning I wake by slow degrees
From torpid slumber's unrefreshing coma,
To snuff with satisfaction the below-stairs breakfast breeze
And hail the Glorious 1st, and thy aroma.
Compact and brown and savoury, and fragrant as of yore,
Supine on toast thou burstest on my vision,
A gratifying sight for me and many million more
(Though publicly they hold thee in derision).
But I–like grousing baby who, when toosipegs appear,
Emerges gay and tricksy from the cross age—
Salute with cordiality and open-hearted cheer
The end of the “close season " of the sausage.
“The German Autumn Naval Manoeuvres will be confined to the
Baltic Main Colliery, near Sheffield.”—Bath Herald. -
This is rather a blow to our prestige. Can we allow it 2

THE HOUSE WARM ING.
VI.-A FINAL ARRANGEMENT.
“SEEING that this is our last day to-
gether,” began Archie
“Oh, don't,” said Myra. “I can't
bear it.” -
“Seeing that this is our first day
together, we might have a little tourna,
ment of some kind, followed by a small
distribution of prizes. What do you
think, Dahlia 2" -
“Well, I daresay I can find some-
thing.” * * -
“Any old thing that we don't want
will do; nothing showy or expensive.
Victory is its own reward.”
“Yes, but if there is a pot of home-
made marmalade going with it,” I said,
“so much the better.”
“Dahlia, earmark the marmalade for
this gentleman. Now what's it going
to be 2 Golf, Simpson 2"
“Why, of course,” said Myra.
“Hasn't he been getting it ready for
days?" . . - -
* That will give him an unfair
advantage,” I pointed out. “He knows
every single dandelion on the greens."
“Oh, I say, there aren't any greens
yet,” protested Simpson. “That'll take
a year or two. But I've marked out
white circles and you have to get inside
them.” * . -
“I saw him doing that,” said Archie.
“I was afraid he expected us to play
prisoners' base with him.”
The game fixed upon, we proceeded
to draw for partners. . - -
“You'll have to play with me,
Archie,” said Dahlia, “because I'm no
good at all.” -
“I shall have to play with Myra,” I
said, “because I'm no good at all." '
“Oh, I'm very good,” said Myra.
“That looks as though I should have
to play with | ...' said Thomas
and Simpson together.
“You're all giving me a lot of
treuble,” said Archie, putting his pencil
back in his pocket. “I’ve just written
your names out neatly on little bits of
paper, and now they're all wasted.
You'll have to stick them on your-
selves so that the spectators will know
who you are as you whizz past.” He
handed his bits of paper round and
went in for his golf-clubs.
It was a stroke competition, and cach
couple went round by itself. Myra and
I started last.
“Now we've got to win this,” she
said, “because we shan't play together
again for a long time.”
“That's a nice cheery thing to say
to a person just when he's driving.
Now I shall have to address the ball all
over again."
“Oh, no 1 ''
I addressed and despatched the ball.
It struck a wall about eighty yards
away and dropped. When we got there
we found to our disgust that it was nest-
ling at the very foot. Myra looked at
it doubtfully.
“Can't you make it climb the wall?”
I asked.
“We shall have to go back, I'm
afraid. We can pretend we left our
pocket-handkerchiefs behind.”
She chipped it back about twenty
yards, and I sent it on again about a
hundred. Unfortunately it landed in
a rut. However Myra got it out with
great resource, and I was lucky enough
with my next to place it inside the
magic circle.
“Five,” I said. “You know, I don't
think you're helping me much. All
you did that hole was to go twenty-one
yards in the wrong direction.”
Myra smiled cheerfully at me and
did the next hole in one. “Well
played, partner,” she said, as he put
her club back in its bag. - .
“Oh, at the short holes I don't deny
that you're useful. Where do we go
now 2 " -
“Over the barn. This is the long
hole.”
I got in an excellent drive, but
unfortunately it didn't aviate quick
enough. While the intrepid spectators
were still holding their breath, there
was an ominous crash.
“Did you say in the barn or over the
barn ?” I asked, as we hurried on to
find the damage.
“We do play an exciting game,
don't we?” said Myra.
We got into the barn and found the
ball and a little glass on the floor.
“What a very small hole it made,”
said Myra pointing to the broken pane.
“What shall I do 2" -
“You’ll have to go back through the
hole. It 's an awkward little shot.”
“I don't think I could.”
“No, it is rather a difficult stroke.
You want to stand well behind the
ball, and — however, there may be a
local rule about it.”
“I don't think there is or I should
have heard it. Samuel's been telling
me everything lately.”
“Then there's only one thing for it.”
I pointed to the window at the other
end of the barn. “Go straight on.”
Myra gave a little gurgle of delight.
“But we shall have to save up our
pocket money,” she said.
Her ball hit the wood in between
two panes and bounded back. My next
shot was just above the glass. Myra took
a niblick and got the ball back into the
middle of the floor.
“It's simply sickening that we
can't break a window when we're really
trying to. I should have thought that
anyone could have broken a window.
Now then.” .
“Oh, good shot l” cried Myra above
the crash. We hurried out and did the
hole in nine.
At lunch, having completed eighteen
holes out of the thirty-six, we were
seven strokes behind the leaders,
Simpson and Thomas. Simpson, ac-
cording to Thomas, had been playing
like a book. Golf Faults Analysed—
that book, I should think.
“But I expect he'll go to pieces in
the aſterncon,” said Thomas. He
turned to a servant and added, “Mr.
Simpson won't have anything more."
We started our second round brilli-
antly; continued (after an unusual inci-
dent on the fifth tee) brilliantly; and
ended up brilliantly. At the last tee
we had played a hundred and thirty-
seven. Myra got in a beautiful drive
to within fifty yards of the circle.
“How many ?” said the others,
coming up excitedly. -
“This is terrible,” said Myra putting
her hand to her heart. “A hundred
and—shall I tell them 2 —a—a—
Oh dear—a-hundredandthirtyeight.'
“Golly,” said Thomas, “you've got
one for it. We did a hundred and forty."
“We did a hundred and forty-two,"
said Archie. “Close play at the Oval.”
“Oh,” said Myra to me, “do be care-
ful. Oh, but no,” she went on quickly,
“I don't mind a bit really if we lose.
It's only a game. Besides, we n >
“You forget the little pot of home-
made marmalade,” I said reproachfully.
“Dahlia, what are the prizes? Because
it's just possible that Myra and I might
like the second ones better than the
first. In that case I should miss this."
“Go on,” whispered Myra.
I went on. There was a moment's
silence—and then a deep sigh from
Myra.
“How about it?” I said calmly.
Loud applause.
“Well,” said Dahlia, “you and Myra
make a very good couple. I suppose I
must find a prize for you.”
“It doesn't really matter,” said Myra
breathlessly, “because on the fifth tee
we-we arranged about the prizes.”
“We arranged to give each other
one,” I said, smiling at Dahlia.
Dahlia looked very hard at us.
“You don't mean 2 ”
Myra laughed happily.
“Oh,” she said, “but that 's just
what we do.”

Get you from my room, begone:
Sweet as the cicala's drone is
My mellifluous slumber, John :
Take away your hulking cronies;
I shall rise from dreams anon.
There are some heroic figures,
Following not the foolish herd,
Careless of convention's rigours—
Like some mountain-eyried bird,
Like some tawny lion whom niggers
Seek to rouse—who stay unstirred,
Unembarrassed by the giber,
Deaf to the invading scold,
Men of superhuman fibre,
Splendid, strong, serenely bold:
Such an one is the subscriber,
And I say the sea is cold.
You, of course, you abject browsers
On the grass of custom—sheep—
Set of hopeless body-sousers,
Clothed in your bravado cheap
(Not to mention bathing-trousers),
Pine to wallow in the deep.
Why? because you deem it proper:
You have heard that Saxons true,
Vikings with the threefold copper
Round their bosoms (Vikings you !),
Love to take the sounding flopper
Every morn into the blue.
So before the earliest winkle
From his spiral couch has crept,
While the gleaming dew-stars twinkle
On the lawn that all night wept,
Out you go—but what d'you think 'll
Happen? Will your food be kept 2
No, while in the waves you flounder,
From his amaranthine cot - -
One shall rise, of strength profounder,
One who thinks, where you do not
(Put that sponge down, John, you
bounder),
One who gets his breakfast hot.
When you come back, cold and snappy,
From the frigid breakers' gripe,
You shall find your bacon scrappy,
You shall greet the conquering type,
Me the hero, filled and happy,
Smoking my ambrosial pipe.

my reputation as a beauty 2 (Simpers.)
He (the thought striking him sud-
denly). Yes, of course — everything
counts. But tell me—I must know—

income 2
She (shrinks again). Sir, I hardly
know how to answer you. Er—(an
original idea occurs to her)—ask Papa.
He. Your sire? Tschah The craven
is a financier—I dare not trust his
word. But you, Angelina—you are
different; I can verify what you tell
me from the books—my heart tells me
that you will not deceive me. Speak
but the word, only one word will suffice,
provided it is big enough.
She. Spare my feelings, Lord Softe.
I dare not speak or in the perturbation
of the moment my tongue might out-
strip the truth.
He. Nay, tell it me without reserve,
that, and one other word I long to hear
from you. What is your age 2
She (starts). Ah! That too? Your
lordship must give me time to think.
A maidenly reticence forbids me to dis-
close all I feel upon the subject. What

He. Ha! You think me unworthy 2
You scorn my paltry five thousand a
year from my revered father, my hum-

your capital I can embezzle—I mean,
I can make millions.
She. Ah, it is not these I cravel I |
have no doubts as to your lordship's
wisdom and experience in these matters,
but I would ask, I long to know—have
you not been married before ?
He. Married ? Tschall ! The thought
has never crossed my mind. No for-
tune—no woman's loveliness, I should
say—has ever thrilled me before; until
now—Angelina / : -
She (briskly). I meant not that, your
lordship. I would rather that your
lordship had been married at least
once, for then the fortune that you
would bring me would be the larger.
(His face drops a little.)
He (stung). Ha! So this is the end ?
But stay, one course is still left. I could
marry a rich widow and then get a
divorce in the States. I would do all
that may become a man for my Ange-
lina's sake
She. Nay, it was but a passing fancy,
and who knows by that time what
changes might have come—what Bud-
gets, what unearned increments, what
alterations in the House of Lords. Our
marriage might be impossible.
He (ardently). Impossible! There is
no such word in the dictionary of
finance. (With hauteur) Perish the
thought ! The course of business never
did run smooth.
She. And I too—could not I also
marry some one—anyone, as long as
he is rich enough 2 Capt. Oofinstein,
for instance—he would be sure to kill
himself in the hunting-field before long?
He. Ha! Perhaps that would be
better. He is rich, Oofenstein, rich and
debilitated with alcohol. And I will
wait for you—I swear it on this cheque-
book—I will be faithful to my troth !
She. Nay, I was but jesting to try
your constancy. Let us marry at once.
I have but twenty-five thousand a year,

love conquers all.

PUNCH, OR
THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
| THE NEW DEATH AND GLORY
BOYS.
THE formation of the Die-Hard
Association of Unionists so eloquently
advocated by Mr. PAxton in The Pall
Mall Gazette, is, we understand, already
a fait accompli. The essence of the
movement, as defined by the originator,
is to drop recriminations and endeavour
to infuse all Conservative and Unionist
associations with the Die-Hard spirit.
In pursuance of this laudable aim
some of the leading members of the
Association have adopted the methods
of peaceful persuasion at the Carlton
Club with most salutary results.
On Friday last, one of the most
notorious of the Black-Listers was
approached by a group of Die-Harders
and asked to explain his turpitude in
voting for the Parliament Bill. The
unfortunate peer, who was drinking
barley-water in the smoking-room,
stammered out some futile explana-
tion, but entirely failed to satisfy his
inquisitors. They accordingly deter-
mined, in accordance with their plan
of campaign, to inoculate the dry
bones of his pseudo-Conservatism with
the virus of Die-Hardihood. The opera-
tion was protracted and painful—
indeed, the groans of the victim were

distinctly audible in St. James's Square
—but completely successful, and the
patient gave speedy proof of his re-
generation by hurling an inkstand at
a portrait of Lord LANsdown E and
uttering the most terrific maledictions
against the Archbishop of CANTER-
BURY. -
On the same day, at a meeting of the
council of the Association, Miss Di
Hardy (of Alnwick) was unanimously
elected Lady Patroness.
It was also decided to secure the
services, at whatever cost, of the baby
donkey which recently won fame and
favour at Southend as the most success-
ful collector at the Life-Boat Demon-
stration and Hospital Carnival.
The council also approved the draft
programme of a Die-Hard Concert to
be held shortly in the Albert Hall.
The principal items are as follows:–
“Let me like a Soldier fall”

LATEST STRIKE NEWS.
MR. AskwitH OUT. .
National Comsternation.
CoMMERCIAL England was thrilled
this morning by the announcement
that Mr. AskwitH, the famous arbi-
trator, the keystone of the business
arch, had himself come out on strike.
The Government decided at once that
every effort must be made to induce
him to return to his duties. A regi-
ment of cavalry was wired for from
| Aldershot and the CHANCELLOR of THE
Exchequer motored round to his resi-
dence. Mr. AskwitH sternly declined
the employers' terms—£20,000 a year
plus time and a half for overtime and
double time for Bank Holidays and
Sundays. He made no objection to
the pecuniary terms, but he insisted on
a maximum of sixteen arbitrations and
two thousand miles railway travelling
per week, and that no working day
should exceed eighteen hours. The
CHANCELLOR was compelled to refuse
the terms as the Board of Trade has
already 124 arbitrations in hand and
fresh ones are coming in at the rate of
three a day. -
Later.
A Cabinet Meeting has been called
to consider the crisis. It is felt by

8 GENERAL STRIKE of PEERs.
As a protest against the Parliament
Bill Lord HALSBURY has decided that no
peer must attend any social function
or fulfil any engagement till the Bill is
repealed. Not a foundation stone is to
be laid, not a cattle show opened, not a
Gaiety girl married, till the peers of
England have full powers restored to
them. Thrilling scenes were witnessed
in London last evening. When Lord
CAMPERDown, under the protection
of fifty mounted police, left his house
to go to the annual meeting of the
Indigent Lodging House Keepers'
Benevolent Society, Lord MILNER shook
his fist in his face and shouted, “Get
back, or the consequences.” The
Archbishop of CANTERBURY, on his way
to the dinner of the Successful Scotch-
men's Society, was loudly hooted by a
crowd of peers and a few sympathetic
commoners. Conspicuous amongst the
throng were the Duke of Northumben-
LAND, Lord HALIFAx, and Lord HUGH
CECIL. - -
fifty constables and a hundred infantry
with fixed bayonets, sallied forth to
fulfil an engagement at the Royal Hor-
ticultural Society. , Lord WILLoughBY
DE BROKE broke his windows as a pro-
test, and shouted, “Kill the blackleg"
On appeal to the police inspector in
charge, Lord HENEAGE was informed
that it was impossible to interfere with
peaceful picketing. “You see, your
lordship, if your House had thrown
out that Bill, things would be different.”
GREAT EDUCATIONAL STRIKE.
The schoolboys of South London en-
tered on a sympathetic strike with the
Liverpool dockers this morning. They
decline to return to work till absolute
peace reigns at Liverpool. In addition
they formulate their own demands
—three whole holidays a week, the

GENERAL STRIKE of EDITORs.
As we go to press the alarming news
reaches us that the editors of England
are coming out in a body to-morrow.
They will decline to reject a single
manuscript till their demands are
granted. The telegraph department is
choked with wires from contributors
promising their warmest support.

running as on every day, and the only variation
was that several trains on the City line had been

AN ARTISTIC EFFORT GONE WRONG.
As the Labour Party have attempted to paint Mr. WINstoN CHURCHILL
The impression left on the minds of fair-minded people
—half-tyrant, half-Caliban.
—a champion of the rights of the country at large.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, August
22.-Recess arranged for last Friday.
Members made their plans accord-
ingly. At last moment PREMIER
decided further to adjourn sittings
till to-day. Secretly conscious of
conviction that in interest of all con-
cerned, especially of genuine working
man fighting for more butter on his
bread, the sooner the talking-shop is
shut up the better. In perilous circum-
stances that dominated end of last week,
what was wanted was acts not words.
However, for upright man the very
consciousness of tendency to narrow
opportunity for intemperate talk,
dangerous at critical period of delicate
negotiations, induced him to sacrifice
advantage secured l. J earliest possible
adjournment. Accordingly provided
another day for the turning on of tap
of turgid talk.
When DoN'T KEIR HARDIE learned
the change of plans he smiled grimly.
In spite of novel advertisement obtained
through agency of reach-me-down white
suit, not been doing very well of late.
His colleagues in Labour Party, for the
most part shrewd men, have taken his
measure and find it does not fit position
of administrative importance. Whilst
comparative new comers to Parliamen-
tary vineyard, like RAMSAY MAcDoNALD
and others, have been prominent in
assisting Government to bring strike
to close, he has been left out in the
cold. Royal Commission appointed to
investigate working of Conciliation Act
of 1907 includes two representatives of
Labour. He is not one.
To-day, thanks to honourable scru-
ples of PREMIER, he found unexpected
opening upon the most effective self-
advertisement booth in the world, with
additional recommendation of being the
cheapest. Made the best of it in his
way, running amuck at the Ministers
instrumental in delivering the nation
from the claws of famine and the jaws
of death.
“The men who have been shot down
have,” he said with absence of passion
that made the accusation more terrible,
“been murdered by the Government in
the interests of the capitalist.”
LLoyd GEORGE replied in speech of
burning indignation that would have
shrivelled up an ordinary man. DoN'T
KEIR HARDIE momentarily perturbed
when the CHANCELLOR quoted his
statement, addressed on Monday to
mob of men hesitating whether they
would persist in strike: “The PRIME
MINISTER has said that if there
was to be a strike the Government
would have the railways kept open
even if they had to shoot down every
striker.” “Contemptible!” cried LLoyd
GEORGE, turning round to face the
slanderer attempting to wriggle out
of the hole without retractation or
apology.
That a momentary weakness. DoN'T
KEIR HARDIE, in spite of studied
unconventionality, is a shrewd man of
business. Comforted himself with re-
flection that, on the whole, dealing
with a class of men in whose presence
it was safe to tell the palpable lie about
the PREMIER nailed to the counter by
LLOYD GEORGE, he had, from personal
point of view, done a profitable after-
noon's work.
Business done.—) {ouse adjourned till
Tuesday, October 24th.
“More than twenty collies in the Manchester
district have been idle one day this week.”

He forbade them to get up before eight

A GARDEN IN SLUMLAND.
SEEDs garnered in an envelope
That sumptuously foretold the flower,
In brave but far from certain hope
We buried in our twelve foot bower,
Then waited through the winter

And just when hope was on the wing,
A plucky British marigold
On half a chance laid sturdy hold
And sprouted in the spring !
We dimly felt the world go by—
Of big deeds faintly caught the
sound.
The airmen conquered worlds on high,
But all our gaze was for the ground.
Somewhere quite near the KING
was crowned,
So those who went to see it say;
For us at that momentous time,
The pale petunia reached its prime
And blossomed for a day !
While men their daily papers scanned
For news of I've forgotten what,
We faced a crisis in our land
Serenely with the watering-pot;
Dim threats of war we heeded not,
But midst a patriotic “boom”
Our Union Jack was duly flown
To voice a rapture all our own—
Sweet William was in bloom |
So, seated in my twelve-foot bower,
A mental equipoise is mine
Whereby to evils of the hour
Their true proportion I assign.
Thus, ere I had denounced the line
Adopted by the Veto Bill,
On London smuts unkindly fed,
My sick verbena drooped its head
And swamped the lesser ill!
From Bad to Worse.

NotEs of THE WEEK.
It is now time to review the Session

THE PRIME MINISTER.
The PRIME MINISTER is the hero not
merely of the day but of the century.
We are not hagiolaters, but—if such a
metaphor may be permitted in our
columns—his name will go down to
posterity enshrined in an imperishable
aureole of triumph. For many months
he has been coasting on perilous shores,
but at last he has smitten the Philistines
hip and thigh. The business was irri.
tating and long - drawn - out—like a
human hair in the mouth. But the
victory was all the more overwhelming
in the end, and his followers can now
wallow to their hearts' content in the
voluptuous joys of spiritual superiority.

nitely more respectable—than JULIUs

Asquith steps unquestioned into the

than his past.
LoRD LANsdown E.
To Lord LANsdown E, that icy aris-
tocrat, as to Lord CURzoN, that gilded
popinjay, we owe no thanks and no
respect. Lord LANSDow NE does not
indulge in the hideous and criminal
extravagance of language shown by
some of his followers, but he is none
the less a cruel and savage hater of the
people. He speaks with a cold insolence
which sets every nerve of a true demo-
crat tingling with homicidal frenzy.
Under the ice of his manner fierce fires
of resentment are perpetually burning,
and we recognize him as a deadly and
implacable enemy of religion, piety,
and the People. The utmost that can
be said in his favour is that he is not
an Archbishop.
MR. LLOYD GEORGE.
The CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER
by his firm and sagacious handling of
the Railway strike has added imperish-
able laurels to those which are already
entwined with the leek amid his Celtic
fringe. We yield to none in our ad-
miration for Mr. Asquit H ; but there
is no doubt that, urbane and masterly
as he is in his control of his party,
when it comes to negotiating with
recalcitrant working men he pales
before the irresistible élan of the vivid
CHANCELLOR. High as he stood before
in the estimation of all sound critics,
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE now stands im-
measurably higher.
THE REv. Dr. Corker AT WINNIPEG.
Nothing is more touching than the
abrupt contrasts of modern civilisation.
Recently, on the very day when
Liverpool was in the hands of the
military and the lower quarters of that
city were convulsed with revolutionary
fury, Dr. Corker was delighting the
members of the Cobalt Club, Winnipeg,
with a fascinating discourse on “The
Releegious Significance of the Songs of
RoHERT BURNs.” The lecture was
attended by Professor Hosea Boffin,
Miss Fatima Pogson, and Dr. Taylor
Swish, all of whom emigrated to
Winnipeg within the last ten years.
Deplorable as it is that our people
should be driven from their sweet hill-
sides for the pleasure or emolument
of greedy and unpatriotic plutocrats,
still it is well that the distant provinces
of the I’mpire should be enriched with
fresh clean blood.

One of my friends who is touring Nor-

is a long white building with a pleasant
garden in front. We wished to linger
in the grounds, but our guide kept
hurrying us on. ‘Ce n'est pas permis,'
was his stock phrase. Isn't it strange
that so sympathetic and understanding
a man should refuse to allow English
admirers to roam everywhere just as
they will 2 That he failed to show
himself to us struck me as another

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A Portentous History (HEINEMANN) is in the nature of a
jest, a half-bitter and half-whimsical jibe at life, sometimes
philosophically discursive, sometimes graphically descriptive
and always closely observant of human conduct. It is the
story of a Scottish rustic, born out of all physical proportion;
it marks with no little skill the mental agonies of a village
giant and provides his ultimate compensation in an entirely
unexpected apotheosis, which it would be an outrage on my
part to reveal. At the start, Mr. ALFRED TENNYSON, as
authors sometimes will who intend to laugh for 349 pages,
lets his cleverness get the better of him. One feels, in
reading, that his natural originality of idea stood in need
of no such affectation of style for setting. That the hero
should save the lady from the onslaught of a bull is, per-
haps, no new thing in
much reason. Apparently he acted in this drastre manner
because he feared that a certain wooer was allured more by |
Celia's prospective fortune than by her herself, but whatever
his motive may have been I am not holding him up as a
pattern grandfather. It must, however, be admitted that ||
his declaration was successful; but had Celia not been
endowed with many charms and more virtues I think that
she would have kicked over the traces, and additionally I
consider that it would have served Grandfather Cope right
if she had. As it was she made herself extremely useful in
her new environment, and the swains of Great Marlton |
adored her as strenuously as some of the ladies snubbed
her. That Mr. J. E. BUCKRose knows the social policies
of small places is abundantly proved by Love in a Little
Town (MILLS AND BooN), and he has also firmly con-
vinced me that admirable place as Great Marlton is to
write about, it would be perſectly detestable to live in.
fiction; but that his
nett profits of the
transaction should
be the implacable
hatred of the lady
and trouble with the
owner of the bull for
damages done to it, ,
is surely a little out
of the way. It was,
I think, the inevit-
able logic of that
affair which set the
author on his legs;
at any rate, from
this point he gets
and keeps the better
of his cleverness and
the history proceeds
brightly, yet natur-
ally, to its climax.
For myself, I found
wanting in the con-
clusion of it a touch
of matrimony, or, at
least, romance; but I

life of a stage-dancer
as supposed to be

It is an idea which
has certainly the
merit of originality.
We all know that
theatrical memoirs
contain frequently a
good proportion of
fiction; but a con-
fessed work of imagi-
nation in this form
is another matter.
The pity is (I am
forced to say it) that
the author has not
been able to avoid
the danger of dul-
ness. “Such and
such a piece was

We find described the trader's life,
So slow that he can scarce endure it,
Until a semi-native wife
Drops casually in to cure it;
The tale, unskipped, I must confess
Is dullish, though it might be duller
But for the novel vividness
Of Mr. VAHEY's local colour.
When Mr. Cope of Cope's Complete Cleanser, after
bringing up his grand-daughter, Celia Bassingdale, in
luxury, suddenly banished her to live with poor connexions,
I think that he was declaring her innings closed without
ran for twenty-seven weeks”—the interest of such records,
even were they true, would not be very great except to
the specialist. But theatrical happenings that haven't
happened—! The really clever achievement of the book—
what would indeed repay a reader who had a good deal
of spare time—is the character of Rose, as revealed by her-
self; but even here I had the feeling that the thing could
have been done more sharply and better with less expendi-
ture of words. As for her social history and the divorce-
court vicissitudes of the chief characters, the less said the
soonest mended. I could appreciate their value as local-
colour, but as episodes in the life of a heroine they entirely
failed to awake my sympathy.

This round at least a peerless hole embraces,
Make merry with the bard.
I shall be down in two, and James is lying
(I'm sorry, James, of course, I truly am)
Deep in the dreadful trough where balls undying
Suffer the tortures of the niblick's slam :
But mine, she rests beside the flag-crowned portal,
The goal of all desires, the easeful end,
§. who so many times has seemed immortal), -
orgive me, James, if I exude a chortle:
Better pick up, my friend.
Just one wild wallop in the old Sahara,
And then come on with me and hark how swee;
She lies in death, how tranquil, mia cara,
The grave she sought for at her silvery feet.
Strew on her roses, roses; spare to utter
One word of sorrow for the wild thing free,
But just a reverent motion with the putter
And down she goes, like Bass or melted butter,
Making “one up" for me. EvoB.
“Without going into technical details, it may be mentioned that
for the purpose of actuating the device, the clutch shaft itself is cut
in two, the part that carries the clutch being keyed to a boss that
has dogs which engage with a companion, series on a ring. When
the spring is jº, it is retained in that condition by a pawl and
ratchet. To start the motor a pedal slides the ratchet ring until it
engages with the pawl and also causes the dogs, to disengage, when
the spring is free to unwind and rotate the clutch shaft through the
medium of the ratchet and the pawl."—Observer.

THE DRAGON OF WINTER HILL.
PART I.
THIs is the tale the old men tell, the tale that was told
to me, -
Of the blue-green dragon,
The dreadful dragon,
The dragon who flew so free,
The last of his horrible scaly race
Who settled and made his nesting place
Some hundreds of thousands of years ago.
One day, as the light was falling low
And the turbulent wind was still,
In a stony hollow,
Where none dared follow,
Beyond the ridge on the gorse-clad summit, the summit of
Winter Hill |
The news went round in the camp that night; it was
Dickon who brought it first
How the wonderful dragon,
The fiery dragon,
On his terrified eyes had burst.
“I was out,” he said, “for a fat young buck,
But never a touch I had of luck;
And still I wandered and wandered on
Till all the best of the day was gone;
When, suddenly, lo, in a flash of flame
Full over the ridge a green head came,
A green head flapped with a snarling lip,
And a long tongue set with an arrow's tip.
I own I didn't stand long at bay,
But I cast my arrows and bow away,
And I cast my coat, and I changed my plan,
And forgot the buck, and away Iran–
And, oh, but my heart was chill:
For still as I ran I heard the bellow
Of the terrible slaughtering fierce-eyed fellow
Who has made his lair on the gorse-clad summit, the summit
of Winter Hill.”
Then the women talked, as the women will, and the men-
folk they talked too
Of the raging dragon,
The hungry dragon,
The dragon of green and blue.
And the Bards with their long beards flowing down,
They sat apart and were seen to frown.
But at last the Chief Bard up and spoke,
“Now I swear by beech and I swear by oak,
º the grass and the streams I swear,” said he,
“This dragon of Dickon's puzzles me.
For the record stands, as well ye know,
How a hundred years and a year ago
We dealt the dragons a smashing blow
By issuing from our magic tree
A carefully-framed complete decree,
Which ordered dragons to cease to be.
Still, since our Dickon is passing sure
That he saw a regular Simon pure,
Some dragon's egg, as it seems, contrived
To elude our curses, and so survived
On an inaccessible rocky shelf,
Where at last it managed to hatch itself.
Whatever the cause, the result is plain:
We're in for a dragon-fuss again.
We haven't the time, and, what is worse,
We haven't the means to frame a curse.
So what is there left for us to say
Save this, that our men at break of day
Must gather and go to kill
The monstrous savage
Whose fire-blasts ravage
The flocks and herds on the gorse-clad summit, the summit
of Winter Hill 2 ”
BY-LAWS FOR PARKS.
[A few rules to supplement the usual seventy or eighty that menace
harmless pedestrians at the park gates.]
1. No person or persons shall take a photograph of the
park or bandstand, or any portion or portions thereof, all
available sunshine being required for the flower-beds.
2. All children must be manacled, and have chain-balls
affixed to their ankles. Those in arms, perambulators,
or mail-carts must be provided with gags or respirators;
this to prevent them crying out and startling the fish, or
stunting the growth of the hollyhocks and young trees.
3. All loose change must be left at the entrance lodge
in charge of the park-keeper, as the jingling of it excites the
gardeners and takes their attention from their work.
4. No man shall take in more than fourteen, no woman
more than sixteen, and no child more than eighteen full
breaths during one minute, as the atmosphere of this park
is the property of the Town and Corporation and must not
be wantonly depleted.
5. No person or persons, male or female, infant or adult,
shall be permitted within the boundaries of the park wear-
ing colours that do not harmonise with the seasons' bloom.
A list of sympathetic shades may be inspected at the park
lodge.
6. No visitor shall continue to smell at a flower or to
gaze at a swan for more than two consecutive minutes; or
subject exotic and delicate plants to a draught by walking
quickly past them.
7. On breezy days all male headgear must be attached
to wearer by a strong cord, a straw or silk hat being liable
to plough up the gravel paths, and the chase of it to dis-
turb the decorous atmosphere of the park.
8. No one other than an officer of the Corporation, or
specially authorised person, shall at any time inspect the
carpet bedding without first wiping his boots.
9. No dogs shall be admitted to the park unless conveyed
in their kennels, the doors of which must be opened only
sufficiently for ventilation and not for egress.
10. On Empire Day children are allowed to sail small
boats on the lake. Boats made of newspaper must first
undergo inspection by the park-keeper, who is authorised
to reject all craft not manufactured from the more reput-
able of the dailies or weeklies.
11. It is not permitted that parents shall bring more
than three of their family into the park at any one time,
several faces of one or a similar cast destroying the
charm of variety in the crowd.
12. Any person caught in the act of sneezing will im-
mediately be evicted from the park, as these convulsions
seriously disturb the air waves. Where a person is
observed to be struggling in the incipient stages of a
sneeze, and the distance between the prospective sneezer
and the exit gate justifies such a procedure, the officials
have authority to rush the said prospective sneezer off the
premises before the explosion.
Penalties for infringement of any of the above by-laws:—
For the first offence, the offender shall be required to
commit to memory the whole of the thousand and one
(or more, as the case may be) rules exhibited on this
board.
For the second offence: Death. BY ORDER.

PATRIOTIC VENTURE. -
A sliM, pale litle man—in looks

DARLING—reticent, modest, but plumb
on the spot all the time, such is Mr.

the magnificent opera house which

It only remains to be added that Mr.

PUNCH, OR
(SEPTEMBER 6, 1911.
THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SEAsoN's suMMARY.
The County Championship being now
finished, we have leisure to consider the
results of the past season. True, the
Cross Arrows have yet to begin their
campaign, and the South of England
(including Essex) -is still waiting to
meet XXIX of Carshalton and Dis-
trict; but to the general public cricket
may be said to be over. The rise of
Warwickshire to the premier position
has already been commented on in the
cohumns of our contemporaries (we
believe); and numerous writers have
rightly pointed out that, if the method
of scoring points in the championship
had only been different (as, for
instance, if the losses had been sub-
tracted from the umpires, and the
lunches ignored—or the drawn games
divided among the wicket-keepers, and
the heavy roller insured) in these cir-
cumstances some other county might
have obtained the laurels. It is un-
doubtedly true also that the fact of
Warwickshire not having arranged
matches with Kent, Somerset, Corn-
wall, Co. Cork and Herzegovina, has
done much to rob the competition of
its interest; while the fact that the
wickets have suited the county's bowl-
ing, and that its batsmen have been in
form, has certainly given an unfair
advantage to the Midland shire. None
the less, all good sportsmen—having
called attention to these points and to
any others which occurred to them—
will hasten to congratulate Mr. FostER's
team on its success.
The M.C.C. team, which is about to
leave these shores in order to tour the
country of our Australian kinsmen be-
yond the seas, has now been definitely
made up; indeed, it has been published
in more than one of our contemporaries.
It is an excellent team, if a little on
the slow side in batting. However, we
have much to learn from our Colonial
cousins in more things than cricket,
and it is to be hoped that when Mr.
Doug LAs and VINE are in together the
rest of the eleven will seize the oppor-
tunity to see something of the country.
Indeed, it is considered likely that, if
VINE and KINNEIR go in first for
England, with Mr. Do U GLA's first
wicket, Mr. WARNER and Hobbs may
even find it possible to pay a flying
visit to the Motherland for the Christ-
mas festivities. . -
In any case we earnestly hope that
the team will return victorious to this
country (if possible, in 1912) and that,
a few days after their landing at
Tilbury, we may have the pleasure of
reading Mr. WARNER's book (on which
we trust he is already at work), How
for the second Time of Asking we
pinched the Mythical Ashes. -
. . . . . . . . . . ---
But it is time we turned our attention
to the doings of humbler individuals,
whose season, no less than that of the
great ones, is now coming to an end.
England, it has often been said, is a
nation of sportsmen. This does not
simply mean that England can turn out
eleven good cricketers or fifteen good
footballers, but that at heart every man
of us has a passion for some kind of
sport: Mr. Stanley Nibbs, of The
Towers, Paddockhurst, is a fine example
of this kind of Englishman, Mr. Nibbs'
score for the season is as follows:–
Wasps killed . . . . . 2,136
Injured ... " 497
Left in marmalade 8,562
Most in a day . 140
*Average . 53-4
Times stung 7
* Irrespective of one day when Mr. Nibbs wa
confined to his bed. - *
Mr. Nibbs uses an ordinary wooden
wasp-killer with a cane-handle, and,
except for an occasional course of mas-
sage during the summer, undergoes no
special training. -
Another gentleman who has had a
very good season is Mr. John B. Bel:
lows, of Upper Croydon and Leadenhall
Street. Mr. Bellows' record at the
moment of writing, for his season is
not yet finished, shows the following
remarkable figures:–
Letters to the press denounc-
ing the Radical-Socialist
Government . . . . . 586
Letters in which the words
“perjured traitor” occurred 586
Letters in which the words
“contemptible time-server”
occurred . . . . . . . . 586
Letters in which the words
“toeing the line” occurred 586
Letters published. . 27
Most in a day. . . . . 3
Percentage of “perjured
traitors’ to letters pub-
lished . . 94-6
Mr. Bellows hopes to improve his
record materially during the silly sea-
son, but already he is considered to be,
next to Mr. LEO MAXSE, the most
thoughtful writer before the public.
We have left consideration of the
most important record of the season
till the last. Need we say we refer to
the weather? (No.) That the weather
has contributed largely to all the
calamities of the season — strikes,
wasps, droughts, Warwickshire's vic-
tory and the extreme fruitiness of
Parliamentary language, cannot now

have been compensations. It is with
these compensations that our last Table

AT THE PLAY.
The Follies.
PERHAPs it is a mistake to see
The Follies on a first night. Perhaps,
anyhow, it is a mistake to write, about
them while their jokes are still fresh
in the memory. It may be that in a
year's time I shall be saying, “How
splendid Kismet and the Coronation
Scena were !” just as I say now,
“How excellent in the old days
were A Voice Trial and Everybody's
Benefit 1" -
It is true, of course, that The Follies
have lost in Miss Gw ENNIE MARs their
brightest planet. Miss FAY CoMPtoN
has made a promising beginning,
but it will be some time before she
can take Miss MARs' place in our
hearts. The rest of the company
remains the same. Custom has
not staled the variety of any of
them; in most cases time has wrought
an improvement in their art; and
yet — and yet I find myself still
saying, “How glorious was Everybody's
Benefit.” -
I seemed to get at the secret of
this during the performance of The
Fourth Wall—a sort of potted Shavian
play. It was very funny in places,
without doubt; but it could have
raised just as much laughter in the
hands of any other company of
actors that one liked to select. In
as far as it was a success it was
a success of costume and book, not,
as in the old Folly shows, a success
of personality. The Follies should
never have burlesques written for
them, they should create their own;
their jokes must not be ordered, they
must emerge. ,
But, of course, there is still plenty of
fun going about at the Apollo. The

A final word to Mr. LEwis SYDNEY,
whose temporary absences from the
stage are still the tragedies of the
evening. If he read Punch as diligently

“The regeneration.”
“Ah! ” said the man with the red
tie, blankly.
“The railways will have to go first,”
continued the man with the long hair;

showed interest in the conversation.

“ALL THE LATEST HAVES.”
SUCH was the legend on a card in
the window that not only caught but
for a moment bewildered my eye, and
in I went to investigate. For who is
not interested in “haves' 2 Moreover,
I had never before seen the word
used in print as a substantive, and in
the plural too. That unsuspecting
people could be had, I knew : the
irreverent had had me often. But
that there were on sale a variety of
no other
articles laboriously made for
purpose than to have -
with—that was a new
idea. For beyond a
contrivance which lifted
plates mysteriously, and
a cotton-wool peach too
like the real article, I
had seen none.
I asked to be shown
the best things in haves.
“This is the best,” said
the young lady behind
the counter, displaying
an empty ink-pot and a
ſat blue-black exuda-
tion made of some soft
material at its side. She
placed the horrid sub-
stance in my hand. “It’s
very amusing,” she said.
“You wait till the room
is empty and then you
lay the blot on something
nice or valuable — the
table-cloth or a book or
a piece of embroidery—
overturn the ink-pot by
it, and there you are.
When your wife comes
in, for example, she has
a fit. See 2 We sell
thousands of them.”
“But how if one is
unmarried ?” I asked.
“Oh, then you try it
on your hostess or a
lady friend,” she said. –
“But it's no use if they know it?”

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A GLUT IN THE MARKET :
Being a Romance of the New Peerage
that might have been.
[A complete operetta in Two Parts, which,
having been hawked about during the Peerage
menace among the Directors of our Musical
Comedy and rejected by them in the fear of
giving offence to Peers and so producing unrest
among their ladies of the Chorus, is now sold
o!! as waste gºods.] - -
PART I. -
The Scene is laid in the boudoir of
Phyllis, regardless of time and occasion.
It is a sumptuous room with some twenty
entrances to it, a remarkable number of
lights and only three walls. As, how-
ever, it is only owing to the absence of
the fourth wall that you are able to hear
and see what is going on, this is no
matter for complaint. At the rise of the
curtain the stage is found to be filled to
overflowing with young ladies in pink
pyjamas, their raison d'être being
| rather to please the fancy, than to
|ºsis: the plot. They do their level
| best to make themselves heard, in spite
of the determined opposition of the
| orchestra. -

"Our exuberance is such
That nothing ever checks it:
But when we think you've had as much
As you can stand, we exit.

action, and Phyllis enters.

And women are astonishing . . . But

I think I'd better tell them all about it.
(To the Conductor of the Orchestra)
I say, I think I'll tell them all about it.
[At that the conductor, having re-
mained singularly apathetic during
the recital, becomes suddenly ant-
mated, taps everything he can reach
with his bâton, rests his left hand
lovingly on the bald head of the
first violinist beneath him, smiles
inclusively and with a “One—two
—three—Go" starts the music.
SoNG—Phyllis.
That lips so red and cheeks so pink
And such expressive eyes
Should be admired is not, I think,
A matter for surprise.
And when you see my dainty nails,
Then you will understand
Why no observant gallant fails
To ask me for my hand.
Though every lass has got her lad,
And some have two or three,
Yet these be men who never had
The chance of seeing me. *
I merely state the dismal fact

I crave for aristocracy,
Being something of a snob;
And though the forty-four display
Inestimable worth,
For me that cannot wipe away
The fact of common birth.

They tell me I shall lose
The lot of them, unless I will
Make up my mind and choose.

sizes, but all immacu'ately and
identically clad. From time to
time they remove their hats and
replace them on their heads, change
their sticks from one hand to the
other, and generally gambol. The
audience will be too much engrossed
in observing the unanimity of their
movements to wonder why they
trouble to wear hats and sticks at
all in a lady's boudoir.

recent troubles, have lost her famous

The trials of our naval air-ship have
been postponed once more, as important
alterations are to be made. This is
good news, for the longer her trials are
postponed the longer we shall have
her with us, we suspect.
The KAISER insists that his Germans
shall have “a place in the sun.” As a
matter of fact many Englishmen and
Frenchmen have consigned them at
times to a yet hotter place.
The American Consul at Swatow,
South China, reports that native cloth
made from bana: a fibre wears well,
and is thin and cool. It should also
have the advantage of being an admir-
able emergency ration. -
Among the latest additions to the
Zoological Garders is a swarm of
small black bees from Jamaica called
Angelitos. Although provided with a
stinging apparatus they do not sting.
An illite: ate native bee was heard ex-
plaining to a friend the other day that
“Angelito” is foreign for “Lunatic.”
A correspondent mentions in The
Times that he recently saw a butterfly
in the Piccadilly Tube Station. It
seems incredible that no one should
have shot it. : :
The celebration of the settlement of
the recent Labour troubles, which was
held at the Crystal Palace the other
day, went off admirably. It was not
even marred by a strike of pageant
workers. : :

A beauty expert recently declared
that our women are becoming less
good-looking. Now, as a somewhat
pathetic sequel to this assertion, and
by way of confirmation, comes the
announcement that next season ladies
are to wear veils.
“Women,” says The Graphic, “are
showing vast improvement in the
matter of not losing their heads.”
This is all the more creditable because
it must be most difficult sometimes to
find them in those huge hats.
“THIRTY YEARS FOR ONE PLAY"
is the title given by a contemporary to
an announcement of a forthcoming
drama by Mr. HALL CAINE. The
sentence strikes us as excessive even
for Mr. HALL CAINE.
A witness called in a case at West
Ham described himself as a “Spotter,”
and explained that the occupation was
“the taking out of spots at a laundry.”
What, then, we would ask, is the
designation of the individual who puts
the spots on at the laundry.
E.
“During the strike, a picket visited a
station on a branch of the North Eastern
Railway to induce the employés to cease work.
The station-master's wife, guessing the object
of the man's visit, ran out with a bucket of
whitewash and chased him from the station.”
Duily Paper.
We should have thought the pickets
would have heartily welcomed white-
washing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Anthea's Guest (METHUEN) was pretty, and her prettiness
was such that women distrusted it and men could not
lesist it. She was a minx, and might have been more so
but for her businesslike sense of the social value of a
limit. Meanwhile she was very poor, and destined, it
would seem, to carn her own living among the middle
middle class, rather than to revel, as she yearned to do,
among the best people, luxuriously and “regardless.”
Anthea, cn the other hand, was by no means unattractive,
but of a virtue sound and sturdy (a shade too sound and
sturdy, perhaps) and of a character so scrupulous, that
she could not appreciate till too late the lack of scruple
in others, and even then could not stoop to competition
with it. Born to the possession of all those things which
the minx most coveted, she had her life amongst real
for a wealthy uncle, a kind
county people, and kept house
and easily tractable
bachelor. And the minx,
partly by accident but
mostly by design, be-
came the guest of An-
thea. The situation is
full, you may suppose,
of possibilities, includ-
ing the intervention of
the neutral Mr. Popple-

anxious to have you like
and admire her favour-
ites; but her insight is
almost infallible and –– -
her descriptive touch masterly. Her name, and I need say
no more, is Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick.
If I were considering the question of a country residence,
I do not think that I should consult Mr. ALGERNoN GISSING,
except perhaps as to neighbourhoods to be avoided. I
never met any author so consistently unfortunate in his
experiences of rural life. Take his latest book for example.
One Ash (F. W. WHITE) was the name of a lone farm, the
master of which marries twice, both times unhappily, ill-
treats his animals, suspects his second wife of infidelity,
and finally goes mad and hangs himself, leaving the farm
and his infant son to perish together in flames in the last
chapter. Well, though it is all told with a skill that
increases with everything Mr. GissiNg writes, I should
simply hate to think that this sort of thing was in any
sense typical. Was it not the great Sherlock Holmes who
declared that a smiling countryside sheltered worse horror
than any town 2 Mr. GissiNg certainly seems of this
opinion; but I wish just for once he would turn his
attention to its brighter aspect. In any case, however,
there are passages in One Ash upon which, as literature,
I offer him my respectful congratulations. The episode
of Linda's care for the poor tormented old horse is one

of them (only cruelty to animals is such a physically
sickening thing that I wish, at any sacrifice, it could be
excluded from the domain of art), and the growth of
Kemche's insanity another, unpleasant but movingly
powerful. On the whole, the tale is one that will
deservedly add to Mr. Gissing's reputation; but which
readers who are holiday-making in lonely farms would do
well to postpone till their return to town.
When you tackle (as you should) Mr. HUEFFER's ellipti-
cally titled Ladies Whose Bright Eyes (CoNSTABLE) and
find William Sorrell, a particularly modein type of hustling
publisher, taking such a tonk on the head in the Salisbury
boat-train accident as lands him incontinently back in the
fourteenth century, you'll as like as not say, “This sort of
thing's been done so oftºn before that there's nothing left
in it"—and you'll be much more than three parts wrong.
It is an exceedingly entertaining fantasy, not at all a bad
yarn, an admirable extension lecture “without tears.” It
easy capital out of
incongruities between
broadcloth and plate-
armour habits and
situations. It restores
with an astonishing
wealth of allusive detail
and faithful scholarship
a vanished atmosphere.
Over-sedulous indeed to
strip the whole gilt from
the mediaeval gºnger-
bread, the author is
less impressed with,
say, the splendour of
pageantry of the age
of chivalry than the
absence of dustbins,
and goes on to attri-
bute a parallel squalor
of motive to his Knights
and Ladies and of
course, pre-eminently,
to his Churchmen and
Churchwomen. Natu-
rally your FROISSARTs or even your SHAKSPEAREs were
not far enough away from the event rightly to interpret
action and intention as can our acute modernists. But a
charming and much less cynical envoi, dexterously
managed, wins forgiveness. Of course you'll suspect some-
thing of the kind, but not quite this. And verily the Lady
Dionissia de Morant of Ecclesford is an attractively
eccentric heroine, whether tilting with her truculent rival
Blanche d'Enguerrand de Coucy or making the pace in
courtship in her own unembarrassed and engaging manner.

THE DRAGON OF WINTER HILL.
IPART II.
So the men, when they heard the Chief Bard utter the
order that bade them try
For the awful dragon,
* * The dauntless dragon,
They all of them shouted “Aye!”
For everyone felt assured that he,
Whatever the fate of the rest might be,
However few of them might survive,
Was:certainly safe to stay alive,
And was probably bound to deal the blow
That would shatter the beast and lay him low,
And end the days of their dragon-foe.
And all the women-folk egged them on :
It was “Up with your heart, and at him, John' "
Or “Gurth, you'll bring me his ugly head,”
Or “Lance, my man, when you've struck him dead,
When he hasn't a wag in his fearful tail,
Carve off and bring me a blue-green scale.”
Then they set to work at their swords and spears—
Such a polishing hadn't been seen for years.
They made the tips of their arrows sharp,
Re-strung and burnished the Chief Bard's harp,
Dragged out the traditional dragon-bag,
Sewed up the rents in the tribal flag;
And all in the midst of the talk and racket
Each wife was making her man a packet –
A hunch of bread and a wedge of cheese
And a nubble of beef, and, to moisten these,
A flask of her home-brewed, not too thin,
As a driving force for his javelin
When the moment arrived to spill
. The blood of the terror
Hatched out in error
Who had perched his length on the gorse-clad summit, the
summit of Winter Hill, -
|
The night had taken her feast of stars, and the sun shot up
in flame,
When “Now for the dragon'
Who hunts the dragon 2"
The call from the watchers came ;
And, shaking the mists of sleep away,
The men stepped into the light of day,
Twice two hundred in loose array;
With a good round dozen of bards to lead them
And their wives all waving their hands to speed them,
While the Chief Bard, fixed in his chair of state,
With his harp and his wreath looked most sedate.
It wasn't his place to fight or tramp :
When the warriors went he stayed in camp;
But still from his chair he harped them on
Till the very last of the host had gone;
Then he yawned and solemnly shook his head
And, leaving his seat, returned to bed,
To sleep, as a good man will
Who, braving malice and tittle-tattle,
Has checked his natural lust for battle,
And sent the rest to the gorse-clad summit, the summit of
Winter Hill,
PART III.
Marching at ease in the cheerful air, on duty and daring bent,
In quest of the dragon,
The fateful dragon,
The fierce four hundred went :
Over the hills and through the plain,
And up the slopes of the hills again.
The sleek rooks, washed in the morning's dew,
Rose at their coming and ſlapped and flew
In a black procession athwart the blue;
And the plovers circled about on high
With many a querulous piping cry.
And the cropping ewes and the old bell-wether
Looked up in terror and pushed together;
And still with a grim unbroken pace - - -
The men moved on to their battle-place.
Softly, silently, all tip-toeing, *
With their lips drawn tight and their eyes all glowing,
With gleaming teeth and straining ears
And the sunshine laughing on swords and spears,
Softly, silently on they go -
To the hidden lair of the fearful foe.
They have neared the stream, they have crossed the
bridge,
And they stop in sight of the rugged ridge,
And it ’s “Flankers back | " and “Skirmishers in ' "
And the summit is theirs to lose or win–
To win with honour or lose with shame;
And so to the place itself they came, .
And gazed with an awful thrill
At the ridge of omen, -
Beset by foemen, -
At the arduous summit, the gorse-clad summit, the summit
of Winter Hill.
But where was the dragon, the scale-clad dragon, the dragon
that Dickon saw, ** = . -
The genuine dragon,
The pitiless dragon,
The dragon that knew no law 2 . .
Lo, just as the word to charge rang out,
And before they could give their battle shout,
On a stony ledge . -
Of the ridge's edge,
With its lips curled back and its teeth laid bare,
And a hiss that ripped the morning air,
With its backbone arched
And its tail well starched,
With bristling hair and flattened ears,
What shape of courage and wrath appears?
A cat, a tortoiseshell mother-catl
And a very diminutive cat at that
And below her, nesting upon the ground,
A litter of tiny kits they found:
Tortoiseshell kittens, one, two, three,
Lying as snug as snug could be.
And they took the kittens with shouts of laughter
And turned for home, and the cat came after.
And when in the camp they told their tale,
The women—but stop ! I draw a veil.
The cat had tent-life forced upon her
And was kept in comfort and fed with honour;

A HEALTH to bold BURGEss! All honour to him,
And a full meed of fame to his marvellous swim
He had strength, skill and stoutness, endurance and pluck,
And a varied assortment of good and bad luck.
The waves couldn't stop or the currents defeat him, -
Though they all did their utmost to baffle and beat him,
While the tides to-and-fro-ed him and led him a dance
From the white cliffs of Kent to the Grey Nose of France;
And there, when at last they could flout him no more,
They retired in disgust and he paddled ashore.

DORMANT PORTRAITURE.
WE have it on the indisputable authority of The Daily
Mirror, that a new photographic fashion is on the
way from America, and that people are not only to be
taken while they wait, but while they sleep—or snore.
This may be all right for those of us who are sleeping
beauties or postcard divinities, who would like to have
forty winks (at the photographer), but we can't all sleep
to order, and some people jib at an anaesthetist. Still, we
have been so familiarised lately with bedroom scenes on
the stage, that we shall no doubt collect unblenchingly
the portraits of our pyjama-clad or curl-papered friends,
taken recumbent and unawares. . We shall, at any rate,
know what they look like, minus the studio grin or the
Society mask, and read their characters accordingly.
Every well-equipped camera-artist will now receive his
victims in his own private dormitory or doss-house, accord-
ing to circumstances. Refractory patients will, of course,
have to be dealt with by a skilled hypnotist, or put to sleep
with an upper cut on the point of the jaw by a tactful
pugilist. Customers who need less drastic treatment may
be soothed into slumber by a selection of the Hundred
Worst Sermons or the recital, say, of “Curfew shall not ring
to-night !” adequately droned. For really desperate cases
of insomnia the lethal chamber will be the ultimate resort.
It is to be hoped, all the same, that there will be no
further developments of this kind of portraiture. We don't
look our best, for instance, when shaving or having a hair-
cut, and not every lady is a heroine to her lady's-maid.
Sleep-walkers also are apt to wear a worried expression,
and should not be chased by the snap-shotter. We think,
too, it would not be quite fair to bring the newly-invented
cinephonograph into play, and record the chance remarks
of talkative slumberers. Persons engaged with a nightmare
should be allowed to work it off before being operated upon.
With these few precautions, we look forward to a re-
freshing variety in the portrait-studies of our private
acquaintances and public favourites in the shop-windows.
“Fast is East and West is East.”
“The morning sun was shining full upon the beautiful west front of
Lichfield Cathedral.”— Yorkshire Pest. --
We had always meant to begin our novel like this, but,
alas ! we have been forestalled.
“The Indian Civil Examinations last many days, and the maximum
number of marks is 6,000, of which some of the candidates will be
rewarded by not one, the system ºf marking being peculiar, all candidates
scoring 20, and fewer are credited with nothing."—Glasgow News.
It is only fair to intending competitors in Glasgow to point
out that in practice this rule is less harsh than it seems.
It is very rarely indeed that a candidate fails to secure an
appointment simply because he has scored only 19 marks
out of 6,000, instead of 20. -- - - - -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOW THEY BEGAN.
The Daily Chronicle of last Thurs-
day contained an interesting account
given by Lord KITCHENER's cousin,
Mr. F. E. KITCHENER, Chairman of the
Staffordshire Education Committee, at
a prize-giving at Stone, of the early
youth of the great Field-Marshal. Mr.
KITCHENER said he had something to
do with his cousin's early education.
“Lord Kitchener was then a tall,
overgrown lad, nearly 6ft. 1 in. in
height. He managed to scramble into
Woolwich; he was not high in the lists,
and no one thought anything about
him. After leaving Woolwich he got
his commission in the Royal Engi-
neers, and still no one thought much
about him. He got his first move up
in the world when he was appointed
on the Palestine Survey, and here he
learnt how to manage native soldiers,
and acquired a great deal of that com-
mand over men which to-day dis-
tinguished him. He got that, his first
appointment, because some one was
wanted to go to Palestine and take
photographs, and it was this knowledge
that gave Lord Kitchener the lift up.”
We gather from the above affecting
recital that Mr. KITCHENER instructed
his cousin in the use of the camera.
But this is not an isolated case of the
assistance afforded to budding genius
by distant members of the same family,
as the following examples culled from
the provincial press will sufficiently
establish.
The Rev. Septimus Hawthorne Tree,
on the occasion of the prize distri-
bution at an Agricultural Show at
Flampton Parva on Thursday, en-
tranced his hearers with some striking
reminiscences of his famous relative,
Sir HERBERT. “HERBERT,” said Mr.
Tree, “when I first remember him,
was a child of a curiously bucolic
temperament, deeply interested in rural
affairs—poultry, pigs and suchlike, but
with no intellectual interests. Being
slightly his senior, I was able to exer-
cise some influence over him, and lent
him books to read. I had recently
been spending my holidays in Switzer-
land, where I had learned the art of
jodelling from the peasants of that
picturesque country—an art that I
have not yet forgotten.” Mr. TREE
here uttered the familiar “Tra-la-liety”
with a gusto and precision that electri-
fied his audience. After the applause
had died down, Mr. Tree continued :
“One day, when I was indulging in
my new accomplishment, HERBERT
begged me to impart it to him. I
complied, with such good results that
at a penny reading held shortly after-
wards he performed the Ramz des
Vaches with such success as to win the
commendation of a theatrical manager
who chanced to be present, and im-
mediately offered him an engagement
in his company. Thus it was through
me that HERBERT acquired the rudi-
ments of dramatic elocution that gave
him his first leg up on the ladder of
histrionic fame.”
Mr. Orlando P. Maxse, third cousin
once removed of the Editor of The
National Review, gave some interesting
details as to the early years of his
distinguished relative, at a meeting of
the Bacup branch of the Halsbury
Guild on Saturday last. He said that
when he first met his cousin he was a
reserved, quiet lad of gentle demeanour
and strong Teutonic proclivities. “No
one thought much of him,” continued
Mr. Orlando Maxse, “until I took his
education in hand and, in particular,
addressed myself to the task of ‘bring-
ing up his patriotism, which was
latent, if not non-existent. Thanks,
however, to my instruction, he made
rapid progress and soon attained a
mastery of forcible epithets which
would not discredit the fo'c's'le of a
whaler. In particular, I taught him the
true use of the phrases, ‘Mandarin,'
‘Iscariot,’ ‘poisonous politician,' and
'slimy arch-scuttler.' From that mo-
ment he has never looked back, and
now has no superior in the gentle art of
ornamental objurgation.”
At a picnic held last Friday at
Moreton-in-the-Marsh by the local
Brass Band, Mr. Harold Dubberley,
the honorary conductor, gave some
interesting particulars about the early
youth of his relative by marriage, the
PoET LAUREATE. Mr. Dubberley ad-
mitted that the relationship was re-
mote, his great-grand-uncle having
married the step-daughter of Mr.
AUSTIN's great-grandfather, but they
had been at the same school and were
in the same class. Strange to say,
Mr. AUSTIN's tastes in those days were
strongly military, and he had decided
to enter the Guards when Mr. Dubberley
begged him to reconsider his verdict on
the strength of a satiric stanza which
he had composed about the French
master. It ran as follows:—
“Why should we, honest English boys,
Learn French, a base barbaric noise :
Sooner than grovel to a Frog
I'd change my nature with a dog.”
Letters not arms was clearly the career
designed for the author of so brilliant
a pasquinado. After some hesitation
Mr. AUSTIN wrote to the War Office
announcing his change of plans, and
devoted himself thenceforth exclusively
to the Muses.
Mr. GEORGE GREEN wood, M.P., it
is not generally known, was bent on
becoming an acrobat. But he was
rescued from this deplorable sacrifice
of his great literary talents by the
timely intervention of his relation, Sir
H. Greenwood Tree, who instructed
him in the true cult of the Stratford-
on-Avon play actor and in the crypto-
grammatic art, with results which
have so greatly conduced to the satis-
faction of Sir SIDNEY LEE and Canon
BEECHING.
At the annual Wayzgoose of the
Golder's Green Temperance Bicycle
Polo Club, held last Saturday at
Yarmouth, Mr. A. Kipling Common
regaled the company with some choice
anecdotes of the early days of his
illustrious relation, Mr. RUDYARD
KIPLING. “In those days,” observed
the narrator, “RUDYARD was thought
nothing of by his friends. But the
sight of one of my letters in The Morn-
ing Post so fired his emulation that he
decided to give up the Church, for
which he was studying, and take to
journalism. The impetus given by my
example thus gave him the first lift on
the upward course which carried him to
the citadel of fame.”

THERE could certainly be no two
opinions about his extreme good-looks.
Even the nicest girl (and the first point
I wish to emphasise is that She was a
thoroughly nice girl) had to think that.
It was practically impossible to avoid
some kind of thought on the subject,
seeing that they met twice, three times,
and sometimes more often still, every
day. She was staying with her aunt
at the far—or quiet–end of the Marine
Parade; He, it appears, must have been
staying somewhere in the town. The
important result was that they both
approached the pier, the band-stand,
and the bathing-machines by the same
route. Hence, meetings. At the end of
three days She had got to know his
light flannel suit quite well; at the end
of a week She could detect and recog-
mise his hat-ribbon on the far side of
a crowd.

much stronger than her aunt, having
treacherously attacked that lady from

and her own attention was temporarily
attracted towards the shore, the result
was that her aunt disappeared from

three minutes and a half. Then

About this time She began, naturally
enough, to wonder a good deal who He
was. Her aunt spent most of every
year at Cheltenham, and it takes a lot
to baffle the curiosity of an inhabitant
of Cheltenham, yet it was noteworthy |
that one or two questions adroitly
worked by the elder lady into the
thread of conversation had produced
practically no result, . Whether from
intention or not (and his manner was
unconsciousness itself) He remained a
mystery.
Their final conversation deserves to
be recorded. Her aunt was within
doors, packing, for they were returning
to town on the following morning. It
was nine o'clock, and moonlight. She
had run out for a moment, to post a |
letter, She said, and the pillar-box that
She chose to patronize (though there
were others nearer) was just beyond
the band-stand. He was there. She
passed, with her usual A1 quality

usual, posted her letter, passed again,
and then, acting on an uncontrollable
impulse, turned and held out her hand.
“This is good-bye,” She said.
are off to-morrow. My aunt told me
if I met you to be sure and make her
farewells.” This was a gratuitous lie;
her aunt had said nothing of the kind,
would, indeed, have been very properly
horrified had she known of the con-
versation. “We shall neither of us
ever forget what you did,” She said.
“Oh I it wasn't anything,” He said.
Which was quite true; it wasn't—
—except in its consequences.
There was a little pause. “It’s been
awfully jolly,” She continued, looking
away over the sea, and the place where
the moonlight turned the tops of the
bathing machines to silver, “ hasn't
it? I’m awfully sorry it's all over !”
By “it’” She meant “you.” . . .
“So am I,’” He said; and He meant
“you” too, and She knew it. .
There was another pause. “Well,
good-bye,” She said, giving him her
hand for the second time. “Perhaps
we shall meet again in town. . We
live in Kensington, and one's always
running up against people, isn't one 2"
“Yes,” He said, “I hope so. Good-
bye.”
So they parted. All the way back
to the lodgings she was cursing her-
'self for a conventional fool; but the
fact remains that amongst the things
a thoroughly nice girl cannot do is to
give her card to a strange young man
and ask him to call. If only her aunt
had been there to do it for her

when She mentioned Kensington.

we approach the climax, and there can
be no climax without the presence of
both hero and heroine. It happened
like this. Her aunt, who was stay-
ing on with them in Kensington,
because Cheltenham is still too warm
in September, wanted to buy some
black suède gloves, six and a quarter,
with four buttons. It is notorious that
the place where you get your suède
gloves freshest in Kensington is Plum-
leigh's, at the corner of the Brompton
Road. Plumleigh's is a large and
excellent shop, at which her people,
for reasons that need not concern us,
had never dealt. The result was that
the assistants there were personally
unknown to her; also the geography
of the place, so that, when they entered
it, they stood for an instant, her aunt

of the Glove department. And then.

they stood thus, a voice was heard, a

emotion, and saw . . . No. He was

dreamed of. There are many lovely

Just
The journalist came next. “To me,”
he said, “there is nothing prettier than
the pigeons at the Museum soaring
round and embarrassing a little girl with
a bag of corn—especially if you see
them as you go in, with the darkness of
the portico for a background. That is
pretty, if you like. And then someone
will startle them, and they will fly up
to the roof, blue grey and white grey
against blackness, and beauty is
achieved. The distinction is illustrated
there in perfection, I think."
“If it comes to bids,” said his
neighbour, “surely the gulls at Black-
friars Bridge are even more beautiful.
Their movements are freer, their
wings are broader; they suggest the
open sea. And yet here they are in
London in their hundreds waiting to
be fed, just as if they were sparrows on
a frozen lawn in winter.”
“Oh, but what about the little red
cottage among the rushes at the Horse
Guards' end of St. James's Park?” said
the lady in the black hat. “It is like a
toy, and the ducks and moorhens and
coots and terns swim about in the
water beneath it, while the guinea-fowls
and pelicans and storks promenade on
the banks. That's most awfully pretty
always.”
The lady in the purple hat, who
sat next to her, murmured approval.
“Yes," she said, “I have often watched
them. But my vote for the prettiest
sight would, I think, go for the little
mothers in the parks — Kensington
Gardens, say—all so busy with their
families—so grubby and so slangy
and yet so responsible and masterful.
I see them every fine day, and they
always delight me. It is funny that
little girls should so naturally suggest
mothers, while little boys never suggest
fathers. Yet so it is.”
There was some talk as to whether
the lady in the purple hat had described
prettiness so much as an interesting
spectacle; but, after all, it depends (as
she said) very much on how you use
words.
“Well,” said her neighbour, “I
believe I can beat that. You vote for
the little girls; my vote shall go to the
little boys. Do you know that this
summer, on a hot week-day afternoon,
I went all the way to Victoria Park in
the East End just to see the bathers
there. It's a shallow lake, a hundred
yards long, and I swear to you that
there were a thousand little East End
boys in it at once—all naked and
glowing in the sun, and all so jolly.
I never saw so many naked boys before.
It was “the colour of life' in intensest
movement. I thought of BLARE's line
‘thousands of little boys and girls
waving their innocent hands'; but
these were flashing their innocent
limbs. It is not only my prettiest
London sight but the most cheerful."
This contribution completing the
list, we waited for the author of the
discussion to name his choice and
end it. “Well,” we asked, “and what
is the prettiest sight in London?”
“The pony-carts,” he answered.
“The little pony-carts that crop up
mysteriously among the wagons and
taxis and motor-'buses in Piccadilly and
the Strand, even in Cheapside, and trot
along so bravely and undismayed, and
take their place so naturally in these
untoward surroundings, and disappear
as suddenly as they came. I always
stand to watch them—the plucky little
things, with their absurd little four
brisk legs, and their four merry little
hooſs, and their two ridiculous wheels.
They are to me the prettiest sight in
London."
Personally I think the Victoria Park
bathers won it.
A TEA FIGHT.
WE came upon Dorothy, my brother
John and I, in a large tent hung round
with pink and white calico, selling tea
to a number of men, and smiling beau-
tifully from under a most enormous hat
at another girl, not quite so pretty as
herself, who was jointly in charge.
We sat down near the door and waited,
and after a little she caught sight of
us and brought us some tea. And
while we were drinking it she stood

the little table next to ours in the way

over, and said: “I want you to do ne
a favour, will you? And we said we
would, and waited to hear what it was
before deciding which of us should do
it ; because we had both of us done
favours for Dorothy before.
She looked round a moment and
went on : “I want you to go out, and
send anyone you can find to have tea.
You know a lot of people here, I expect,
and each one helps. You remember
what Mr. Harberry said last Sunday.”
Mr. Harberry is the young, bachelor
Rector, but we did not remember what
he said last Sunday. Then she added,
as she turned away : “Be sure you
send them to me, won't you ? I've sold
fourteen so far, and she's sold twelve.”
So we went out into the bazaar,
through the stalls where they sold
needlework, to where the men were
gathered together waiting till it was
time to go, and to'd them that they
gave you a capital tea for a shilling in
a tent we pointed out, and that there
was a very decent-looking girl there in
a big hat with red flowers in it.
At about six o'clock we came back to
see how things were going on. There
were still one or two people in the big
tent, and the other girl and Dorothy
were standing together in the middle
talking and smiling at each other.
Dorothy came down to us after a time,
to see what we wanted, and we asked
her, what the score was ; , and she
smiled rather queerly, and said, “She's
one ahead. Did you send anyone as
I asked you, or have you been asleep?"
We told her what we had done, and
how we had described her hat so that
there should be no mistake, and
Dorothy at once threw out her hands
in a way she has to signify that one
is an utter imbecile, and exclaimed :
“Red flowers in it ! Why, hers has
got a lot of great flaring poppies * *
And she stopped short and looked at
us exactly as a jockey might look at
two tailors. “Oh, but if that isn't
just too exactly like a man!” she said.
We both felt rather foolish, because,
of course, we had not noticed what
the other girl was wearing in her hat.
Only John, who is very careless some-
times in what he says, blurted out:
“But we said there was an awfully
pretty girl —— ” But I kicked him
on the ankle so hard that he stopped
with a little gasp. Dorothy flushed,
and then, for she is very good-natured
really, she began to laugh, and said it
didn't matter at all really, only we
must go away now, as they Were just
closing.
But quite suddenly I had an idea. I
pushed John into a chair and sat down
beside him. “No,” I said very master-
fully, “we want tea—two teas, please.”
Dorothy stared at me with her
lips apart. “You can't,” she said.
“You’ve had one. It wouldn't be
fair. It would be cheating—at least,
wouldn't it 2 " Then she looked from
one of us to the other, and smiled like
a big, beautiful flower. “You dears!”
she said. “I should like to kiss you.”
But she did not mean that really, of
COllrSe.
IIowever, she promised us that we
should drive her home; and then, while
we were drinking our tea, who should
come in but the Rector himself. Both
Dorothy and the other girl went to talk
to him, and we heard him ask how they
had been getting on, and Dorothy
answered for them both that she had
sold thirty-seven teas, and the other
girl thirty-six. And he said it was a
very close finish.
But Dorothy never appeared for us
to take her home, and on the way we
passed her walking with the Rector, and
so much interested in what he was
saying that she did not see us at all.

AT THE PLAY.
“MACBETH.”
THE barren (or, if you will, blasted)
heath was in darkness, save for a fitful
flash of lightning which, to those who
knew, revealed the fact that the scene
was Scotland. The thunder growled
itself into the distance, and there came
that sudden terrible pause which
heralds Nature's most awful effects.
High on a lonely rock in the west
appeared the grim figures of Banquo
and the Thane of Glamis, huge in the
darkness. Then the fury of the ele-
ments burst forth again, and, as Heaven
willed, a terrible flash of lightning
missed Banquo and rested long upon
the face of Macbeth, long enough indeed
for everyone to make sure that it was
really Sir HERBERT. The thunder of
our applause followed; for myself, I
think I shouted, “Speech, speech l’’
And as soon as silence was re-
stored, Sir HERBERT responded.
He looked round the lonely
heath and said impressively,
“So foul and fair a day I have
not seen.” It was certainly a
horrid day, but it was a magnifi-
cent entry.
In a note circulated to the
audience the producer says that
there has been much discussion
whether Macbeth was a brave
soldier or a black-hearted villain.
Sir HERBERT, I fancy, is on
the side of the black-hearted
and neurotic villain.
I saw of Macbeth the less I
regarded him as a brave, if
ruthless, soldier. The idea of
his unseaming anybody from the nave
to the chaps, as mentioned in the
second scene, seemed more absurd
with each following scene; so that, in
the end, those two fine lines, which
seem so nearly to excuse all the
villainies of brave men—
“Ring the alarum bell–Blow wind Come
wrack
At least we'll die with harness on our back."
—could only be interpreted as the last
pose of a neurotic. “Praise for Sir
HERBERT"—he was a magnificent
neurotic.
Yet I have never before been so much
impressed with the extraordinary un-
reality of acting. There were only
three or four moments in the whole
evening when it was possible quite to
forget that one was in a theatre; and
I am afraid that those moments were
due chiefly to the extraordinary reality
of the scenery. “The Courtyard of
the castle” (HARKER) was so real, the
little staircase in the corner where
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth sheltered
gave such a natural, almost homely,
touch to their plottings that one could
not help but believe—even though
Macbeth would talk about “me hand ''
and Lady Macbeth about “me father.”
Similarly the “Room in Macbeth's
castle” (CRAven) seemed so entirely to
suit Lady Macbeth that a wave of
naturalness went over the stage for a
moment. Indeed Miss Vanbrugh, in-
distinct as her delivery was in this her
opening scene, never seemed to me to be
quite so good again—with the possible
exception of the sleep-walking scene,
where she was excellent, and where
again the simple staging helped her.
It is a tribute to the greatness of
the play—and, perhaps, also of the
players—that none of the representa-
tions of the many other talented actors
and actresses impresses itself upon the
memory. The poetry absorbs them;
the drama moves on, however inter-
preted. At His Majesty's it moves

then 'twere well it were done quickly,
for it starts at 8, and one must get

Sir HERBERT does it, with Macbeth

it loses anything by being long drawn

SHARSPEARE for your money. M.
ABOUT AN EAR.
IT is a terrible admission for a
mother to have to make, but I am
compelled to own that my son is dis-
appointed in me. I had had moment-
ary qualms lest he should despise my
plastic and unresisting little brain all
those pet theories of mine that my con-
temporaries would have none of. But
he, unmistakably bored with me as a
tutor, asked only that I should uncom-
plainingly act the part of Mountain
Range and allow him to satisfy his
desire to ascend to the summit.
Since he is a child of single purpose,
not lightly to be turned aside from a
determination, I realised, before I had
decided on my course of action, that he
was comfortably seated astride my arm
engaged in exploring the intricacies of
my ear.
On discovering that I, his own
mother, possessed that wonderful and
complicated thing (the mystery of
which is lost on adults)—a human
ear, he exhibited an almost excessive
elation. He pinched it to make sure
that he was awake, he tickled it to see
if it could move, he covered it with
hair until completely hidden for
the scle pleasure of finding it
again.
But, since the day was hot,
it was not long before he be-
came aware of the fact that has
struck every child since the
world began—that parents are
incurably selfish. His harmless
sport was denied him, and for a
moment or two he lay prostrate
on the sand aghast at his first
glimpse of the Injustice of Life.

have told me that, whereas his
round his wrists, about which
he permitted me to grow en-
thusiastic, were to him the most
prosaic things on earth, an adult ear,
on the contrary, was one of the wonders
of the world. But since the language
of the Splutter and the Gurgle does not
permit of argument he ignored my
commands and struggled up again to
the point of vantage.
It was then that the disillusionment
began. My ear, he discovered, was not
all he had thought it. He poked his
finger into it once or twice, but drew it
out again, disheartened. He tried to
undo it and flatten it out so as to be
able to mould it to his own satisfaction.
It was, he decided, too maze-like. No

intellect, detest my disposition or fail enthusiasm of discovery, had appeared

merely for his amusement. “For what,

unfeigned astonishment. No, it was
no good my making excuses. My ear
was not the perfect ear. He felt he
would have liked his mother to own a
simple, direct kind of ear—not one full
of pitfalls and sudden turns. Of his
own accord he slid down on to the

appointment.
It was a terrible experience for me.

this coldness arose between us which
we can neither of us shake off.

people's ears. Time after time he has
been cast back into gloom again. But
I try to cheer him, filling him with
hope that the Next Ear will be the one
for which we are searching.
I never thought I should be capable
of duplicity in my dealings with my
own son. I can only hope that when
he grows to manhood he will believe
that I acted solely from a motherly
desire to accustom him early to the
disappointments of life. But, while
outwardly sympathetic, I am deliber-
ately causing him pain and shattering
his illusions because, out of a pitiable
vanity, I want him to see that other
ears are as far from his ideal as mine.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MEDICAL science has done wonders for romance, and it
was a glad day for novelists when it was discovered that if
you hit a man hard over the head, or gave him a sudden
shock, he might lose his memory completely, with the
chance of regaining it many years later when the ethics of
justice or sensation demanded. This handy little device has
been well used in Nigel Ferrard (MILLS AND Boon), where
Mrs. BAILLIE REYNoLDs has made a small girl of fourteen,
wandering in her sleep, the chance witness of a dreadful
midnight crime. Two surgeons are conducting an opera-
tion, and one of them deliberately poisons his patient, sub-
sequently inducing his friend, the nephew and heir of the
dead man and the actual operator, to believe that he has
bungled with the knife, and for his own sake had better
hush up the affair. Nigel Ferrard therefore adopts the
unknown and inopportune child, who is found to have lost
all knowledge of her past life. When she grows up, he
given me with no stinting hand. I wish I could say that
the tales—for, as is the custom with magazine-characters,
each chapter in Stranleigh's life was complete in itself—
were as admirable otherwise, but the truth is I found them
just a little bit disappointing. In each—the adventure
with the Russian Prince, or with the railway king, or the
bank manager, or what not—there was a host of admirable
preparation, to which the climax seemed always a trifle
inadequate. But I have admitted that I enjoyed reading
the book; and I believe others will do the same. It is
very well illustrated.
Before ALLEN ARNOT forges her next novel she will be
well advised to re-read The Dempsey Diamonds (LANE) with
the view of noting how many mystifications she weaves
and leaves unravelled, and on how many and what slight
occasions she employs coincidence to make her story march.
A tithe of the coincidence and a quarter of the mystification
would have carried her well over a fairly steep tale of
adventure, and after all The Dempsey Diamonds is a

Marchmont, the other
doctor, falls under the
suspicion of his wife,
who had been originally
engaged to the mur-
dered man: and thus
everything is ripe for
the thunderbolt to fall.

a scene of terror or
some state of mental,

ment Mrs. BAILLIE
REYNCLDs writes ex-
ceedingly well, but she
seems to underest mate
the value of conversa-

gave me the impres-
sion that she would
have found a less in-
effectual way of getting
her wealth into her
granddaughter's hands;
neither do I think she
would have been so
tragically dismayed at
the possibility of her
secret being discovered.
Not Jane or William

the consecrated and
always-to-be-forgotten
so that I found myself
not so much stirred as I should have liked to be by the
final catastrophe and revelation of guilt. But there is
no doubt that the pathological situation is one for which
the old tragedians would have given pounds and pounds.
My theory is that Lord Stranleigh, Philanthropist
(WARD, Lock), started its literary life in the form of
monthly contributions to a fourpence-halfpenny magazine.
If this is not the fact, the supposition serves at least to
show you the kind of person Stranleigh was, and how
Mr. Robert BARR has treated him. He had, to begin
with, so much money that he simply didn't know how on
earth to get rid of it; and the worst was, that often, when
he thought he was chucking the wretched stuff away, in
charity or to oblige a friend, a turn of events would bring
it all back to him increased sevenfold. So that he went
on becoming more and more a multi-millionaire, and not
being able to help it. To me, nowadays, there is some-
thing very simple and beautiful in a story like that. I
have enough of the Triplet in me to love that my hero
should be able to write a cheque after lunch for a hundred-
and-fifty thousand pounds, and not remember it at tea-
time; and this pleasure Mr. Robert BARR has certainly
phrases of a pocr tradi-
tion. Crying hoarsely, bristling the eyebrows, grinding the
teeth and laughing sardonically are simply not done. I
suppose one does occasionally meet immaculate evening
dress, but it is best not to notice it. And astonishingly
few of one's men friends ever refer to a woman, however
frail, as a “wicked wretch.”
I am still straining my eyes towards the literary horizon
for another good volume of short stories. It may be unkind
to suggest that In Different Keys (MILLs AND Boon) would
have been better called Indifferent Tales, but the fact is
that I. A. R. WYLIE has not risen here above the usual
short story of commerce—the kind that is written in June,
and served up, to an aroma of printer's ink and highly-
glazed paper, in a “Christmas No.” towards the end of
October. In their season, and a little at a time, I like
these well enough ; but a whole volume of them makes for
indigestion. The best of the tales seemed to me to be the
one that ends the book, called appropriately The Last
Turn, about a circus acrobat who found his wife carrying
on with another member of the troupe, and almost let him
fall in their somersault act, but didn't quite. There was a
genuine thrill here, and some human behaviour.

PARROTS’ LAST WORDS.
IT has been left to Professor Wragge,
now on a visit to London from the
Wisconsin Laboratory of Biology and
Research, to explore what is, even at
this late date in the world's history, an
entirely new subject of investigation.
Many persons have interested them-
selves in the powers of speech of
parrots; but the Professor specialises
wholly in their dying remarks; and he
is in England at this moment to collect
at first hand data from parrot-owners

As Mr. Punch's representa-
tive, I found him at an hotel
conveniently near Leadenhall
Market, whither he goes every
morning in the hope of con-
versing with sailors and others
who bring their birds to that
place to be sold.
“Yes,” he said, “it is a pro-
foundly absorbing study. The
parrot in ordinary life, full of
health and vigour, is something
of a problem: he seems to come
in his intelligence and critical
acumen midway betwixt man
and bird. There is something
uncanny about him, but there
is nothing that moves the feel-
ings. One contemplates him
with admiration and perplexity,
even wonder, but never with
sympathy. One's emotions are
untouched. Is it not so?”
“Quite,” I said.
“But,” continued the Pro-
fessor, “later, when his faculties
are dimming, when he nears
the moment of dissolution, the
parrot can strike a deeper note.
Ah, my dear Sir, I assure you
some of the things said by
parrots then would bring a lump

“There are several more,”
said the Professor; but I had
to cut him short.
“It is profoundly interesting,”
I said, “but I really must run.”
And I really ran.
“The ‘London Gazette’ last night
contained the formal notification that
His Majesty had ordered A. Conge

University, to elect a Bishop to the

“Do the birds always know they are
going to die?” I asked.
“Not always,” he replied. “Sudden
death may come to a parrot as to any
of us. A choking fit. A cat overturning
the cage. Last words in such a case
would have less value. They might be
expressive merely of rage or alarm.
But when the end comes slowly—when
they have had time to realise what it
means—the loss of everything held dear,
the cage, the perch, the parrot food, the
master's or mistress's stroking fingers,
the opportunities for free and caustic
comment—it is then that they say their
best things. Let me read you a few.”
He drew from his pocket a bundle of
letters and selected half-a-dozen.

“A lady at Bournemouth writes to
me: “Our parrot for years had been in
the habit of saying “Good night” as I
placed the cover on its cage before
going to bed. Then latterly, strangely
enough, it substituted another phrase,
and instead of “Good night,” always
said “Pretty Poll,” although my name is
Clara. But last week, when it died, just
before it closed its eyes for the last time,
it shook itself for a moment on its perch,
and once again, after an interruption of
three years at least, said, very slowly,
“Good night,” and then fell over.' Her
letter ends thus. Is not the finality of
this very touching?”
I said that it was.

FAREwell. To summer.
SUMMER, if now at length your time is through,
And, as occurs with lovers, we must part,
My poor return for all the debt, your due,
Is just to say that you may keep my heart;
Still warm with heat-waves rolling up the sky,
Its melting tablets mark in mid-September
Their record of the best three months that I
Ever remember.
I had almost forgotten how it felt
Not to awake at dawn to sweltering mirth,
And hourly modify my ambient belt
To cope with my emaciated girth ;
It seems that always I have had to stay
My forehead's moisture with the frequent mopper,
And found my cheek assume from day to day
A richer copper.
Strange spells you wrought with your transforming glow!
O London drabness bathed in lucent heat'
O Mansions of the late Queen Anne, and O
Buckingham Palace (also Wimpole Street)!
O laughing skies traditionally sad'
O barometric forecasts never “rainy "l
O balmy days, and noctes, let me add,
Ambrosiana” "
And if your weather brought the strikers out
And turned to desert-brown the verdant plot;
Iſ civic fathers, who aro often stout,
Murmured at times, “This is a bit too hot | "
If the slow blood of rural swains has stirred
When stating what their views about the crops is,
Or jammy lips have flung some bitter word
At this year's wopses;–
What then 2 You may have missed the happy mean,
But by excess of virtue's ample store,
Proving your lavish heart was over-keen,
And for that fault I love you yet the more;
Nay, had you been more temperate in your zeal,
I should have lacked the best of all your giving—
The thirst, the lovely thirst, that made me feel
Life worth the living. O. S.
WHERE TO GO NEXT HolidAY.
BRADFord.
Now that the holiday season is nearly over it seems
proper to remind serious and responsible people that there
are other places one can go to besides Badgastein, Nether
Achnaharacle, and Margate. Bradford is a most interesting
place for an autumn holiday. It is never crowded with
trippers, either monthly or week-endly. It is possible at
Bradford to get away from the Band; and there are never
any pierrots to disturb one's afternoon siesta on the banks
of the Aire. However, the purpose of this article is not
to boom Bradford as a health-resort ; the idea is rather
to be didactic and informative, to lift the mind of the
reader to a higher plane of thought than that on which
it moves when he is considering the music-hall value of
BURGEss, or what he would have done with the money if
he had had a thousand on Prince Palatine for the Leger.
The chief industry of Bradſord is WoolcoxibiNG, and
there are few more picturesque sights in any part of the
world than the convergence upon the main highways
leading to Bradford of hundreds of thousands of sheep
which arrive, twice a year, from all parts of the sur-
rounding country, and even from Scotland and Wales, to
have their wool combed. This process used to be per-
formed locally; and in remote places small holders may
still be seen combing their own sheep. But the progressive
owner realises now that it is cheaper to send his flock into
Bradford twice a year for this operation, which not only
gives the sheep a much tidier appearance, but stimulates
the growth of its wool and improves its general health and
spirits. Unfortunately for the purposes of the journalists,
woolcombing is a secret process; and my attempt to get
into the comberies, disguised as an elderly ram, was
frustrated. But I was fortunate in meeting many sheep,
both Before and After, and was much struck with the
improvement in their appearance. Many had evidently
indulged in a singe and shampoo also.
Next to Wool.com BING, in the respect of the Bradford
man, comes the MoHAIR TRADE. As the name indicates,
this staple depends upon a comparatively little-known
animal, the Mo, which is fortunately plentiful in Asia
Minor, South Africa and the Argentine. The Asian or
African Mo must not be confused with the commoner
British variety, distinguished, for trade purposes, by the
prefix Ikey. It is curious to think that there are dozens of
Bradford men, each with two motor cars and a grouse
moor in Cumberland, who have never set eyes on their
benefactor, the Mo. Thousands of miles away, on the
High Veldt, the Mo moves day after day in his orbit
round a peg, to which he is attached by a long strand of
his own hair. His one object in life is to feel it growing.
At night he is corralled by his keeper, dexterously and
painlessly shaved with a 1620 h.p. safety razor, and
turned loose to accumulate next night's crop. The hair is
then packed in bales, and shipped to Bradford, whose
motto is, “The Mo the Merrier.”
From Mohair we turn to Bradford's third industry—
OIL-PRESS BAGGING. This is a profession, as its name
suggests, which calls for considerable resource and even
daring. Anyone who has ever seen an oil-press will under-
stand that it is almost as hard to purloin, without exciting
immediate suspicion and pursuit, as the Albert Memorial.
The successful Oil-Press Bagger must be wary and astute.
He must know where there are Oil-Presses worth his
attention, and to what extent they are guarded. Then he
has to consult with his Head Bagger (an official who is
paid a huge salary, and who is well worth it) as to the
plan of campaign. I was fortunate in gaining the
confidence of several Head Baggers, during my visit to
Bradford : but it would be unfair, and might even be
dangerous, to give more than the barest outline of their
method. But I may be permitted to say this, that
gelignite and a Pickford van play a not unimportant part
in the business. A team of Oil-Press Baggers, brawny men
from the Dales, has been known to break into a Baggery
and remove a full-sized Oil-Press in 2 min. 35; sec. The
next time that you feed your pigs with oil-cake —if you
keep pigs, and if pigs eat oilcake—the next time you feel
the clammy caress of a linseed poultice, I hope you will
spare a moment's grateful thought for the Oil-Press
Baggers of Bradford.
Two extracts from The Melbourne Age:–
“I) UN KEI.D. — From 420 merino eves, Mr. Paul Hendrick, of
Warrayure, obtained 375 lambs, or 99 per cent.”

This is where the Colonial has the advantage of us.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE OGRE.”
For weeks I had been living the
animal life, chasing the grouse-bird
over heart-breaking peat-hags; plough-
ing, with steady alternation, the blue
seas and the white bunkers of Brittany;
and now my stagnant mind was to
have an intellectual treat. Returned
to London, the headquarters of the
hierarchy of Dramatic Culture, I was,
on my first night, to sit at the feet of
Mr. HENRY ARTHUR Jones, its anointed
high-priest.
At once I saw that things had been
moving on while I was away. New
types, undreamed of in my experience
of actual humanity, had sprung into
being. Here was a flapper (with pig-
tail) talking the glib rhetoric of Female
Emancipation with the aplomb of a
PANKHURST. Here was her elder sister,
a picture of virginal simplicity, sud-
denly become notorious as the author of
a shady novel about shop-girls, censored
by the libraries. Here was her callow
brother, educated at Harrow, Cam-
bridge and the Music Halls, addressing
his young step-mother, with wearying
insistence, as “pretty belle-mêre.” Here
was that lady conspiring with her hus-
band's children to flout the authority of
their father. Here was that father,
mildest-mannered of City merchants,
lending his preposterous nickname of
Ogre to the latest of Mr. Jon Es's mas-
terpieces. I pass over the young man's
best girl, the most incredible charmer
that ever disturbed the realms of pure
imagination with the tootle of her car,
and content myself with saying that
Art, that tireless inventor, had truly
not been idle in my absence.
It looks as if Mr. HENRY ARTHUR
JoNES had meant to give us a refined
modern version of The Taming of the
Shrew. But the brutality of Petruchio
is everything. Take that from him and
his occupation's gone. Mr. JoNEs's Ogre
is satisfied to assert his manhood by
nailing over his mantelpiece a pair of
riding breeches (not an exclusively
masculine garment) and eating a soli-
tary chop in the presence of his starv-
ing family. (Let me here say that Sir
GEORGE ALEXANDER ate his chop just
about as well as it could be eaten.
It was a delightful little interval of
comedy in a very desert of trivial
iteration.) And at the end I could not
find that we were much better off than
when we started, or that the Ogre had
really done so very much taming. It
is true that his elder daughter (no
thanks to him) was off his hands and
that his ne'er-do-weel boy had gone to
swell the ranks of his kind in Canada,
but no one supposed for a moment that
his shrew of a wife had undergone any
sort of reform. Of course I shouldn't
think of worrying about the aimless
futility of it all if only it hadn't been
the work of Mr. HENRY ARTHUR Jon Es.
For he has always recognised himself
as an authority on the right methods of
making plays, and, generously enough,
has made no pretence of concealing his
views from the public.
Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER was in rather
attractive vein. I couldn't wish to
meet an ogre more gentle, more re-
served, more passively persuasive. He
must have taken fifty or sixty bites to
his simple mutton-chop, and he washed
it down with homely ale instead of
human blood. Miss KATE CUTLER had
harder work to win our sympathy in a
character compact of the elements of
shrew and minx. But she cannot help
playing well. Mr. VALENTINE, as a
gardener who had “corpsed” a shrew
of his own and knew full well how the
type should be handled, had an eye
that was more eloquent than any
language, though he could be vocal
to good purpose when he chose. Mr.
MATTHEws, heavily handicapped by
the lady of his choice, scarcely had
his usual chance. But he was always
good to watch even if he had little
to say that was worth while.
REYNoLDs and Mr. NAREs performed
their slight tasks very naturally. Finally
Mr. HALLARD, though he did great
execution with rolling eyes and flashing
teeth, never seemed a very probable
breaker-up of the domestic menage.
The dialogue, studded with simple
pleasantries, was seldom brilliant. It
seems a little late in the day to sug-
gest, as a bon mot, that the censoring
of a book is a good advertisement for
it; and when you recur to your chop
after an interval for conversation you
should always think of some better
remark than “Let us return to our
mutton.”
Altogether the play, though it had
its spasms of quiet humour, cannot, I
fear, be long for this world. Still, one
never knows. O. S.
“THE PERPLExED HUSBAND.”
Thomas Pelling may well have been
perplexed. He came back from Russia
expecting to find the happy loving little
wife that he had left six weeks ago and
was greeted coldly by a strange woman
—the same in appearance but with
how different a manner towards him.
In his absence she had discovered (with
the help of Dulcie Elstead and Clar-
ence Woodhouse, those champions of
Women's Rights) that he had been
treating her as a doll, that she was
only—this surprised Thomas—“the
principal woman in his harem.” She
Mr.
knew now that she must “live her own
life; ” and until Thomas showed that
he understood and sympathised she
would only be a stranger to him. Now
Thomas was no fool, though he was a
Philistine. As an earnest of his com-
plete understanding he announced his
intention of kicking Dulcie and Clarence
out of the house. Sophie said that if
he did this she would leave the house
with them—for ever. Whereupon the
poor husband was indeed perplexed.
Luckily Mrs. Margell had a plan.
In real life people never have plans, or
if they do they take weeks and weeks
to think of them. Obviously we
couldn't sit and watch Thomas for
weeks and weeks while he thought of a
plan; the thing had to be announced
at once, even while we looked and
waited. It was quite a simple plan–
the dear old one, in fact, which
gets another woman into the house
in order to make the wife jealous.
Mrs. Margell was, no doubt, a great
playgoer, and had seen this plan work-
ing successfully on the stage hundreds
of times; so she had confidence in
recommending it to Thomas.
Well, it worked again. Not quite in
the way Thomas expected, but none
the less to the happiness of himself
and his wife, and to the great glory of
Mr. ALFRED SUTRO. For Mr. SUTRO has
written a capital play, artificial perhaps
in places, but always interesting. And
I shall not be so silly as to accuse him
of trying to solve the Woman Suffrage
question.
Mr. GERALD DU MAURIER was a
perfect Thomas Pelling, and he may be
congratulated not only on his own fine
performance but also on his company.
Miss ATHENE SEYLER (who made such
a delightful first appearance in The
Truants) showed quite another side of
her art as the earnest little wife, and
was equally successful in it. As the
emancipated Dulcie (why Dulcie 2)
Miss HENRIETTA WATson was as
effective as ever in an unsympathetic
part ; as the philosopher Clarence (why
Clarence?) Mr. LYALL SweTE was com-
pletely in the picture. Miss MAUDE
MILLETT looked and spoke just like
the matter-of-fact Mrs. Margell, and
Miss ENID BELL showed something
more than the beauty that is always
necessary in the “other woman.” Both
Thomas and I thought at first that to
look beautiful would be all she would
have to do; but, as it turned out, there
was much more in it than that. M.

[SEPTEMBER 20, 1911.
WHEN I am not feeling very well I
go to Beatrice for sympathy and
advice. Anyhow, I get the advice.
“I think,” I said carelessly, wishing
to break it to her as gently as possible,
“I think I have hay-ſever.”
“Nonsense,” said Beatrice.
That annoyed me. Why shouldn't
I have hay-fever if I wanted to ?
“If you're going to begrudge me
every little thing,” I began.
“You haven't even got a cold.”
As luck would have it a sneeze chose
that moment for its arrival.
“There !” I said triumphantly.
“Why, my dear boy, if you had hay-
ſever you'd be sneezing all day.”
“That was only a sample. There
are lots more where that came from.”
“Don’t be so silly. Fancy starting
hay-fever in September.”
“I’m not starting it. I am, I
earnestly hope, just finishing it. If you
want to know, I've had a cold all the
summer.”
“Well, I haven't noticed it.”
“That's because I'm such a good
actor. I've been playing the part of
a man who hasn't had a cold all the
summer. In short, I've been wearing
the mask.”
Beatrice disdained to answer, and
by-and-by I sneazed again.
“You certainly have a cold,” she
said, putting down her work.
“Come, this is something.”
“You must be careful.
you catch it?”
“I didn't catch it.
“Last week-end ?”
“No, last May.”
Beatrice picked up her work again
impatiently. I sneezed a third time.
“Is this more the sort of thing you
want 2 " I said.
“What I say is that you couldn't
have had hay-fever all the summer
without people knowing.”
“But, my dear Beatrice, people do
know. In this quiet little suburb you
are rather out of the way of the busy
world. Rumours of war, depressions
on the Stock Exchange, my hay-fever
—these things pass you by. But the
clubs are full of it. I assure you that,
all over the country, England's stately
homes have been plunged into mourn-
ing by the news of my sufferings,
historic piles have bowed their heads
and wept.”
“I suppose you mean that in every
house you 've been to this summer
you've told them that you had it, and
they 've been foolish enough to believe
you.”
| “That's putting it a little crudely.
* x
How did
It caught me.”
| What happens is
“Well, all I can say is, you know a
very silly lot of people.”
“What happens is that when the
mahogany has been cleared of its
polished silver and choice napery, and
wine of a rare old vintage is circulating
from hand to hand * >
“If they wanted to take any notice
of you at all, they could have given you
a bread poultice and sent you to bed.”
“Then, as we impatiently bite the
ends off our priceless Havanas x -
“They might know that you couldn't
possibly have hay-ſever.”
I sat up suddenly and spoke to
Beatrice.
“Why on earth shouldn't I have hay-
fever?” I demanded. “Have you any
idea what hay-fever is 2 I suppose you
think I ought to be running about
wildly, trying to eat hay? or showing
an unaccountable aversion from dried
grass? I take it that there are grades
of hay-ſever, as there are of everything
else. I have it at present in a mild
form. Instead of being thankful that
it is no worse, you * x , -
“My dear boy, hay-ſever is a thing
people have all their lives, and it
comes on every summer. You've never
even pretended to have it before this
year.”
“Yes, but you must start some time.
I'm a little backward, perhaps. Just
because there are a few infant prodigies
about, don't despise me. In a year or
two I shall be as regular as the rest of
them.” And I sneezed again.
Beatrice got up with an air of
decision and left the room. For a
moment I thought she was angry and
had gone for a policeman, but as the
minutes went by and she didn't return
I began to fear that she might have
left the house for good. I was wonder-
ing how I should break the news to
her family when, to my relief, she came
in again.
“You may be right,” she said,
putting down a small package and
unpinning her hat. “Try this. The
chemist says it's the best hay-ſever
cure there is.”
“It's in a lot of languages,” I said
as I took the wrapper off. “I suppose
German hay is the same as any other
sort of hay? Oh, here it is in English.
I say, this is a what-d'-you-call-it cure.”
“So the man said.”
“Homoeopathic. It's made from the
pollen that causes hay-ſever. Yes.
Ah, yes.” I coughed slightly and
looked at Beatrice out of the corner of
my eye. “I suppose,” I said carelessly,
“if anybody took this who hadn't got
hay-fever, the results might be rather—
I mean that he might then find that
he -in fact, er—had got it.”
“Sure to,” said Beatrice.
“Yes. That makes us a little
thoughtful; we don't want to over-do
this thing.” I went on reading the
instructions. “You know, it's rather
odd about my hay-fever—it's generally
worse in town than in the country.”
“But then you started so late, dear.
You haven't really got into the swing
of it yet.” - i
“Yes, but still—you know, I have
my doubts about the gentleman who
invented this. We don't see eye to eye
in this matter. Beatrice, you may be
right—perhaps I haven't got hay-
fever.”
“Oh, don't give up.”
“But all the same I know I've got
something. It's a funny thing about
my being worse in town than in the
country. That looks rather as if
By Jove, I know what it is—I've gºt
just the opposite of hay-ſever.”
“What is the opposite of hay?”
“Why, bricks and things.”
I gave a last sneeze and began to
wrap up the cure.
“Take this pollen stuff back,” I said
to Beatrice, “and ask the man if he 's
got anything homoeopathic made from
paving-stores. Because, you know,
that 's what I really want.”
“You have got a cold,” said Beatrice.
A. A. M.
STARS IN COLLISION.
READERs of our esteemed contem-
porary, The British Weekly, can hardly
have failed to notice the striking item
of literary news which appears in the
last issue over the signature “A Man
of Kent ’’:—
“The American papers tell us that what
came near being a serious accident occurred
recently at Kennebunkport, Me., where Mar-
garet Deland and George Barr McCutcheon
have summer cottages. Both writers own
automobiles, and one day were taking an
outing in them. They met so suddenly in a
narrow road that a crash was inevitable,
and Mr. McCutcheon's machine struck Mrs.
Deland's, dashing it over an embankment eight
or nine feet high. By a miracle it was not
overturned, and no serious damage resulted
from the encounter.”
It is reassuring to the national
amour propre to know that these ex-
hilarating encounters are not the
monopoly of the New World.
Thus an accident that might have
been attended with consequences
calculated to eclipse the gaiety of
two hemispheres is reported from
Ryde (I. of W.) . It seems that Mr.
HENRY JAMEs, who has recently pur-
chased a hydroplane, was cruising in
the Solent when he collided with a
motor boat driven by Mr. Joseph
CoNRAD. As both craft were travel-
ling at a high speed they became so
inextricably entangled that it was

impossible to separate them. The
illustrious pilots were both hurled into
the sea, and the shock was so great
that Professor MILNE's seismograph at
Shide Hill was violently agitated and a
flock of solan geese which were cross-
ing the island fell to the ground in a
state of hopeless inanition. Fortunately
the two famous novelists were picked
up by a submarine and conveyed to
Ryde. According to the latest advices
Mr. HENRY JAMEs has nearly completed
the scenario of his apology to Mr.
CoNRAD, which is expected to run to
about 140,000 words. It will shortly
be published in two volumes by Mr.
HEINEMANN, under the title of “A
Marine Entanglement.” -
The charming village of Ripley was
recently the scene of an extraordinary
encounter between Mr. G. K. CHES-
TERTON and Mr. SILAs K. HockING.
Mr. CHESTERTON, who was mounted
on a 10-h.p. “Giant" motor bicycle,
swept round a corner into the High
Street at a high rate of speed and
dashed into a Cornish Riviera landau-
lette, in which Mr. HockING was sitting
! . ſ before the door of a temperance hotel.
To avoid the inevitable collision, Mr.
HockING threw himself out of his car,
| while Mr. CHESTERTON, by an extra-
over the roof of the hotel, and clung to a
telegraph pole until he was brought
down by the captain of the local fire-
brigade. Happily, neither of the
authors was hurt, Mr. HockING being
a man of iron constitution, while Mr.
CHESTERTON's buoyancy completely
neutralised the sudden impact with
the telegraph pole, on which a suitable
tablet has already been placed by the
Parish Council.
Mrs. ELINor GLYN, amongst her
other accomplishments, is a fearless
aeroplanist, and has already crossed
the Channel several times. During
her last transit, however, she narrowly
escaped destruction. When only about
a mile from the French coast an
explosion of petrol set the aeroplane
on fire, and she dropped like a stone
through the void. By an extraordinary
piece of good fortune Mr. WILLIAM
LE QUEUx, who was returning to
France in his magnificent steam yacht
Gloriana, happened to be exactly
beneath her, and when the burning
aeroplane dropped on the deck, several
of his footmen promptly extinguished
the flames. Mrs. GLYN, who was clad
in a suit of asbestos overalls, escaped
without any injury, but the buttons on
the livery of the footmen were melte
by the terrific heat. -
Lastly, we have to chronicle a
momentous remcontre which occurred
lately in Hertfordshire. Mrs. SARAH
ToolEy, who is in the habit of riding
across country on a small African
elephant of extraordinary agility, leapt
her steed over a hedge into a road
just as Mr. MAURICE HEwleTT was
passing by in his 16-cylinder Senhouse
Limousine, crashing through the roof
with a noise that was distinctly audible
at Lord Rothschild's stately home at
Tring, seven miles away. The remark-
able feature of the accident, however,
was that while neither Mrs. ToolEY
nor Mr. MAURICE HEwleTT received a
scratch, the elephant was smashed to
smithereens and was never seen again,
though Major RICHARDSON and his
bloodhounds were on the scene of
action within twenty-four hours. ,

“Good heavens! fellow,” said I,
“what do I know about such things?
Mary says I must have a new bowler.
Give me therefore a new bowler.”
The man gave a cursory glance at
my head, as if it were so much solid
matter to be covered up and got rid of
as soon as possible, and selected his
idea of a new bowler.
“It suits you, Sir,” he said, as I put
it on, “if I may say so, admirably.”
“You have said so,” I retorted, “but
nevertheless my idea of a hat is some-
thing one can wear and yet see out of.
Mind you, I have never gone into the
matter before, as you have no doubt
done, but yet I have the instinct that
a hat is less a thing for one to get
inside than a thing to be placed outside
one. Once there, mcrepver, it should
stay there, till removel. With the
first gust of wind I should be blown
right out of this.”
He produced a smaller one, stated
that it suited me, if he might say so,
admirably, compelled me to buy it, and
sent me out of the shop. Mary, upon
observing me later, said, “When are
you going to buy a respectable
bowler?" I explained that I had
done so already. She said she was
glad to hear of it, but would be
ºl. still to see it. I called her
attention to the top of my head.
“That l” she said merely, and so it
came about that later I found myself
again in the shop, this time personally
conducted.
Now, the indignity of this mere
return was sufficiently uncomfortable,
and I do think that, considering the

men give at shops in our single days,
the shopmen ought at least to stand

man in particular should have caught
the look of suffering in my eye, and
have used all the weight of his autho-
rity and demeanour to crush Mary's
opinions and, though I say it as
should not, to crush Mary herself.
Instead, he agreed frankly, and with
a contemptuous look at me, that the
hat was too small.

“Absurd, Madam,” he agreed again;

that I was referred to as “he.” Indeed,
I was ever regarded as “it.” For,
when exhausted as a subject for adverse
criticism, I was treated as an object
for resting hats on at various angles.
I had nothing to do with the choice of
either: if I evinced any interest in the
matter and paused before a mirror, I
was ordered sharply to go and stand by
the door. I obeyed orders, and was
told even more sharply to go and stand
by the other door. To the people in
the shop I seemed an idiot; to the
other people, who wanted to come into
the shop, I seemed to be a tiresome
idiot, and for every hat that did not
please the critics I got all the blame.
My head and the shape and size of it
were an insult to Mary and an injury
to the man behind the counter. In
short, that poet, if he knew what he
was talking about when he mentioned
trouble, spoke with great moderation morning, as she saw me off to the

and restraint.
Everything must end, and a con-
clusion (of the most uncomfortable shape
conceivable) was eventually arrived at.
Within a month, however, Mary had
taken a dislike to it. I called her
attention to the fact that it was her
own selection. That might be, but
Mary could not go on loving me unless
I got another. I said, with regret, that
I should have then to dispense with her
love. That might be also, but I could
not, I was reminded, live with comfort
in the same house as her disapproval.
I reminded her again that the hat
complained of was her choice. She
had changed her mind, she said, and
I must change my hat. . . . The
process was much the same as before,
only if possible more offensive.
That was four months ago. This
City, she called me back. Oblivious of
the past and optimistic of the present,
I returned and kissed her again. That
was not what she wanted. “Stand a
little way away from me,” she said,
“I want to look at you.” She did
look, and the look was at the top of
my head, and not affectionate.
If this matures into a fourth bowler
hat, I shall ask with some confidence
for a divorce. -

GARDENING NOTES.
[With the usual acknowledgments.]
SEPTEMBER, so called because it is
the ninth month of the year, occupies
a unique position in the calendar, from
the fact that it stands midway, so to
speak, between genial August and the
more boisterous October.
New bedding operations must now
be put in hand, so as to be ready for
the activities of autumn. Every
amateur gardener has his own method
of procedure in this respect, to which
his neighbours will, perhaps rightly,
attach no exaggerated value, remember-
ing the old saw, “As you make your
bed, so shall you lie about it.” For
myself I am inclined to recommend a
mixture of caviare, brick-dust, and
finely chopped leaf-mould as being
best for all practical purposes. Many
amateurs, however, stick to clay; and
vice-versd.
The long drought having come
to a welcome termination, artificial
moistening need no longer be resorted
to, save in the case of plants in pots,
and jobbing-gardeners. Both these
latter will require constant attention,
if the best results are to be obtained.

TANNED.
SIR, the rich colour that you rightly praise
On cheek and brow was dyed by sunny days;
Yet, as I draw my trouser up, you see -
The milk-white tint that marks my shapely knee;
No kilt, in fact, as sure as eggs are eggs,
Has flapped and swayed about my Southern legs.
No, nor in knickerbockers have I strayed
From hill to hill, from purple glade to glade.
For me no Sandy, short in speech and dour,
Has sent the setters ranging o'er the moor;
I did not drain the mountain-dew or turn
Aside to dabble in the tinkling burn,
Blending in mixture due, as wise men will,
The fiery spirit with the icy rill.
No grouse, arriving from the deuce knows where,
Has fanned for me the ambient upper air
And passed unscathed and doomed me to despair–
No joys like these to me the Fates decreed,
To me who have not crossed or neared the Tweed.
Nor have I crouched, with every nerve on edge,
Alert behind some bristling Norfolk hedge;
While far in front the drivers' call rang clear,
A note of warning to my straining ear,
And, rising from the roots, the covey came
Adown the wind like streaks of living flame.
Often escaping from the line of wrath
The flaring birds pursued their shot-chased path,
Though some were left who had not wished to stay,
Inert in death—but I was far away.
No, Sir, this colour that bedecks my face
Was spread by Nature in a simpler place.
Where the fair Solent laps upon the sands
In Totland Bay her airy paint-box stands,
There by sheer indolence an earnest man
May win at ease his favourite coat of tan:
Upon his back he lies and dreams his best,
And, while he dreams, the sun achieves the rest;
Then, waking up, he plunges in the tide,
And cleaves the wavelets on his breast or side,
And, still intent on brownness to the last,
Darkens the tint and makes the colour fast. R. C. L.
SPECIAL POSTS.
Active rehearsals are, we understand, already in progress
for the inauguration of the Special Submarine Post between
Orkney and Shetland which is to begin operations on
the 17th of next month, and will thereafter maintain a
regular daily service. This first submarine post has been
established by some prominent members of the Navy
League to mark the year of the signing of the Declaration
of London. Letters, which must bear a special stamp,
may be posted in any public-house in the City. They
will be conveyed by the usual channels to Lerwick,
thence by submarine to Kirkwall, after which they will
return to the London General Post-Office for despatch
to their ultimate destination. It is hoped that these
special facilities will appeal to business men. Any profits
that may accrue are to be devoted to charities selected by
the First Lord of THE ADMIRALTY.
We have been asked to clear up some misapprehensions
which have arisen with regard to the new Underground
Post between Widnes and Paisley. The delay which has
occurred in some cases in the delivery of letters is due, we
understand, to the long drought, which has rendered the
ground so hard that burrowing has been conducted under

most disheartening circumstances. Letters, which must
bear a special stamp, may be posted in the official boxes
which will be found in the leading suburban boot-shops.
The address must be type-written in red ink on both sides.
It may not be generally known that this first under-
ground post has been inaugurated to celebrate the year
of the passing of the Veto Bill. The proceeds are to be
devoted to charities selected by the CHANCELLoR of THE
ExchEQUER. - -
Much interest has been aroused by the announcement
of a New Water Post, from Dover to Calais, which will
be opened in the course of a few weeks, by way of cele-
brating the magnificent performance of BURGESs in swim-
ming the Channel. BURGEss, himself, Holbein, Wolffe
and other prominent swimmers have already been engaged
to undertake the duty of conveying the letters, which
must be posted in the Albert Memorial. Any profit that
may result will, we understand, be devoted to chârities
selected by the President of the French Republic. As
only one letter can be conveyed at a time—in the mouth
—the cost of the special stamps for this service will be
one hundred guineas. These stamps, which are made
of a preparation of rubber and asbestos, must be firmly
affixed by a safety-pin. Only letters contained in the
official aquascutum envelopes will be accepted for trans-
mission. The envelopes will be on sale next week at the
Eustace Miles Restaurant.
BLESSING THEIR BUTTONS.
[" According to the Autumn nodes, the front fastening is to be
applied to gowns and blouses.”—Fashion Column.]
FROM the radiant South to the niggardly North,
The fiat of fashion is heralded forth,
In language imperious, rigid and blunt:—

Do you hear it, poor damsel, with nerves on the rack,
As you struggle to button your blouse at the back 2
No more need you writhe and make faces and grunt,
Since frocks for the future will fasten in front.
Do you hear it, meek man, as with conjugal zest
You fasten the gown of your spouse, by request ?
No more for those hooks need you fumble and hunt,
Since frocks for the future will fasten in front.
Do you hear it, blue-stocking, whose absence of mind
Results in a gap in your bodice behind 2
No more of sly jests you'll be bearing the brunt,
Since frocks for the future will fasten in front.
Like the musical breath of a breeze passing by
Sounds the sibilant sough of the satisfied sigh
Of the portly, the slender, the tall and the stunt
Now their frocks for the future will fasten in front.

MEMOIRS OF A MILLIONAIRE.
The announcement that a biography
of Mr. J. PIERPONT MoRGAN, the re-
doubtable American financier, is shortly
about to appear has given rise to
pleasurable anticipations on both sides
of the Atlantic. Without wishing to
discount the joys of perusal Mr. Punch
is in the fortunate position of being
able to give a brief synopsis of the early
chapters of what promises to be the
most thrilling product of the autumn
publishing season.
ORIGIN AND PEDIGREE.
Mr. MoRGAN, it is as well to state at
once, comes of an ancient and historic
line, being descended from the famous
hero Morgante Maggiore celebrated in
PULCI's romantic poem. This illustrious
giant who, it will be remembered, was
converted to Christianity by Orlando
and acquired great renown for his
generosity, died suddenly of the bite
of a crab “as if "-in the words of
WHEELER—“to show on what trivial
chances depends the life of the
strongest.” To this day crab is taboo
at the table of the MoRGAN family.

r
famous financier was Fata Morgana,
alias Morgan le Fay, who laid the
foundations of the fortunes of the
house and inhabited a splendid mansion
at the bottom of a lake crowded with
art treasures, many of which are now
in the possession of her descendant,
who claims kinship with RAPHAEL
MoRGHEN, the engraver; HENRY
MoRGAN, the King of Buccaneers;
and AUGUSTU's DE MoRGAN, the famous
mathematician, from whom Mr. J. P.
MoRGAN learned his first lessons in the
multiplication table.
His father, JULIUS MoRGAN, traced his
descent on the maternal side from the
conqueror of Gaul, whose Commentaries
form the favourite reading of his son.
The latter's Caesarian lineaments have
often been noticed by expert physiogno-
mists.
EARLY LIFE AND STRUGGLEs.
Mr. PIERPONT MoRGAN, who was
born at the Golden Gate in 1837,
started life under most unfavourable
auspices. Most millionaires have begun
with half-a-crown, but he had several.
Others have begun by splitting rails,
but he devoted his energies to the much
more arduous task of amalgamating
- *
tº
* = º
them. Prosperity is generally associated
with an avoidance of the “demnition
bow-wows,” but Mr. MoRGAN is an
inveterate dog-fancier. And, lastly,
undeterred by the warning enshrined
in a famous poem, he completed his
education at the University of Göttingen.
Yet, in spite of all these handicaps, he
made his way rapidly to the front and
now possesses two houses in Englan
and one in New York.
We may close this imperfect sketch
of the opening chapters of this fascin-
ating volume with an answer recently
inscribed in an album of “Pet Aver-
sions” by Mr. MoRGAN —

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM is a writer to whom I owe
a great and cheerfully-acknowleged debt of gratitude for
much past merriment; but I hope he will not mind my
saying that there are parts of his latest story, Lalage's
Lovers (METHUEN), which I consider to have written off
some at least of my obligation. Perhaps I was not in
the mood; perhaps I was disappointed at finding that,
though the scene of the tale is laid in Ireland, the village
folk who have so often delighted me before were absent.
Whatever the reason, something did disappoint me woe-
fully, and that, too, despite all the charms of Lalage
herself, a sufficiently attractive though scatter-brained
young person. I liked her best, I think, as a hoydenish
flapper, founder of the great “Anti-Tommy-Rot-Society”
character except his courage and gaucherie, alike indomit-
able, the story is here told with an unadorned sincerity
which makes amends for the absence of many more cheaply
attractive qualities. To literary graces Mr. HARRIson
makes no pretence, and what plot he employs is only
designed perfunctorily for the better illustration of his
hero's strength of character. Thus, the identification of .
his villainous parent in the harmless pedagogue who
shared his boarding-house can be foreseen whole leagues
away. It is in the author's fidelity to detail that the
attraction of his book is found. True, one might doubt
whether a man like Queed, so ignorant of his fellow-
creatures, could ever have been fitted to control a great
newspaper. But things may be different in Richmond
(Va.); and, anyhow, no link in the chain of argument
is shirked.
A certain note of provincialism in the writer gives reality
to his treatment of a

reminiscent in many
ways of my old friend
the heroine of The
Major's Niece. Both at
this stage and in the un-

scene that ends the
book, La lage was
wholly delightful; but
her companions seemed
to me mostly puppets
whose vagaries lacked
the vitality with which
Mr. BIRMINGHAM can
generally infuse his
most farcical antics.
There are one or two
evidences, however,
that make me think a
great part of Lalage's
history may be founded
on actual events, which

for instance, clearly un-
conscious of the rather
second-rate quality of
his women-folk when
he shows them dressed

repellent material out
of which he develops
his admirable hero in-
vites comparison with
Miss MAY SINCLAIR's
masterpiece, The Divine
Fire; but the compari-
son must be unfavour-
able to Mr. HARRIsoN,
whose book lacks the
colour of high romance
and imagination. But,
as a faithful study of
the not very picturesque
milieu which he sets out
to portray, it has quali-

Just why Mr. S. R.
CRoCKETT named his

Queed, by Mr. HENRY SYDNoF HARRISON (CoNSTABLE), is
not a poisonous herb, but the surname of a sort of a man.
In choosing so relentless a title it would seem that the
author wanted to make it clear from the first that it was
no part of his design to woo your senses with the charm of
sweet sounds. The anomalous idea of a savant absorbed
in a magnum opus on Altruism without ever having done
an unselfish action in his life is perhaps not so very novel.
But Queed is no ordinary prig. Brought up without other
human ties than those which bound him to a foster-parent
in the person of a New York policeman of Hibernian
extraction; without education save of his own getting;
frankly unconcerned about the necessity of paying his
way—we find him in the early stages of manhood already
halfway through his monumental work, composed in the
congenial atmosphere of a middle-class Virginian boarding-
house.
Of his gradual evolution—physical, social and spiritual—
to a point where nothing recognisable is left of his former
novel The Lady of the
Hundred Dresses (NASH) I cannot imagine, for the real
heroine of the story had a very limited wardrobe. At first
I thought (and hoped) that the author was going to thrill
me with robberies and deeds of violence. But, although a
rather dashing jewel-thief turned up at various opportune
moments and killed a few people, both he-and all the
other characters—were gradually pushed to the back of
the stage by Miss Allison (from Dunfermline), who is
described with recognisable accuracy as a “perfectly
adequate young female.” On the penultimate page of
the book we read, “And if her adventures and daring
speech be as much tasted by the public as by the present
chronicler, he will set them forth more at length.”
So those who have a liking for “perfectly adequate young
females” may live in the hope of hearing more of Miss
Allison. For my own part, however, I am prepared to
wish her a solemn farewell; indeed, I think that Mr.
CRoCKETT would have written an infinitely more intriguing
book if he had allowed the murderous jewel-thief to
dispose of this lassie before she had got thoroughly set
and going.

[Mr. T. W. Buſ RGEss, who recently swam for six hours in a tank at

your thoughts busy."] -
WHAT did you think of, WILLIAM BURGEss,
When you dared the drift of the Channel tide,
When you broke the billows and boshed the surges
With arms flung wide?

And the raven crest and the monkish crosses,

And ask if they wear the skirt called hobble
In realms like those 2

THE LAST WOPSE OF SUMMER.
TAKING usual morning buzz round village with Charles
Algernon, it suddenly occurs to me that he and I are the
sole survivors of our race. When Providence sees fit to
call us to itself, there won't be a single wopse left in
entire neighbourhood |
Linger with Charles Algernon outside Grocer's.
Depressed by sight of corpses, all relations or dear
friends, piled a foot deep inside window panes. “And to
think,” says Charles Algernon, “that, with only a little
more self-restraint, every one of those fine fellows might
be with us yet!" . -- - -
True enough—but Charles Algernon hardly the insect
to say so, never having been exposed to real temptation.
If he'd ever come across it—say in the form of a beer.
or treacle jar—would have fallen in to a dead certainty.
Well-meaning wopse, in his way, but weak. Have sent
him on to scout.
He returns with report of excellent opening at house
down next street. Accompany him to window, and find'
I've been there before. Occupier a peevish old person,
who flaps about him with napkin. Doesn't do much
execution with that—but rather nippy with butterknife.
I know, because only a fortnight since he chopped a
favourite uncle and two second cousins in halves before
my very eyes. . . . Stop on sill, and let Charles Algernon
go in first. . . . According to him, everything as it
should be; table laid for breakfast, nice fire, nobody
about. . . . Think I may venture in. Any strawberry
jam going? No jam, according to Charles Algernon, only
marmalade. Tut-tut! how can people be so inconsiderate?
Factory marmalade never does agree with me. Of course,
if it's home-made. Charles Algernon, already inside cut-
glass bowl, declares it is home-made—and most luscious."
Not sure that I'm in the mood for marmalade this morn-
ing. Shall sit on edge of bowl and see how Charles
Algernon gets on. Surface strikes me as looking a trifle
tricky. “Safe enough,” he assures me, “so long as you
keep on the peel.” Perhaps, after all, just a taste. Few
things more wholesome than genuine home-made marma-
lade—always provided you don't over-eat yourself. Afraid
that's just what Charles Algernon's doing—his face is a
perfect mask of marmalade already I Feel it my duty to
warn him against excess. He seems offended ; says I
needn't be afraid for him, as he knows perfectly well where
to stop. He may—but the syrup is hardly the safest part
to stop in. He tells me it's far the sweetest, and I've no
idea how delicious it is, and goes on wallowing. Won't
look at him—can't bear to see any wopse making such a
beast of himself. . . . This peel is certainly a little too
acid. , Syrup might act as a corrector. Anyway, one sip
can't hurt me. . . . Charles Algernon right about its being
sweet. Quite excellent Luckily, unlike some wopses,
I know when I've had enough. . . . Remind Charles
Algernon that we'd better be going. He begs me to wait
for just another minute—he'll be out directly. Will give
him a little longer—may as well have one more go at the
Syrup. . . . That last mouthful not so good—cloying, some-
how. If Charles Algernon won't come out, I shall simply
go without him, that 's all!
He assures me he would be only too glad to get out, if he
could, but he can't. There ! I told him how it would be
but he wouldn't listen—and now, oh, Charles Algernon
that you should have come to such an end as this . . .
Wºl. I can do nothing for him, except leave him to his
ate. . . .
Very odd–but I find it's more of an effort to get away
than I expected. Can't feel my feet in this confounded

THE COMPLETE NOVICE.
[AUTHok's Not E. –This monograph is in-
tended primarily for the young golfer who is
desirous of reducing his handicap from 36 to 24,
and is written in the inspiring manner of the
recognised text-books on the game. At the
same time, it will be found . helpful, it
is expected, to the young billiard player, to the
lawn tennis tyro, and to all those who are just
taking up badminton. Chapters I. to XIII.,
dealing with such technical points, as . The
Origin of the Jigger, The }} in Macbeth's
Time, Championships I Have Won, etc., etc.;
are omitted here as being rather too advanced
for the ordinary novice.]
CHAPTER XIV.--THE DRIVE.
IN considering the importance of the
drive it must be remembered that this
is the first stroke to engage the player's
(and caddie's) attention, all games com:
mencing from the tee. The novice will
therefore naturally wish to master this
stroke, and it is to help him in this
laudable endeavour that I propose to
enlarge for a moment upon the proper
method of striking—or rather, as will
be seen in a moment, sweeping away—
the ball when teed up upon sand. It
is obvious that it is easier to strike—or
rather, sweep away—a ball teed up
than one in a cuppy lie (as will be
shown when I come to deal with cuppy
lies in a later chapter); but at the same
time the young golfer generally finds
in the initial stages of the game that
the drive is the most difficult stroke
with which he is called upon to deal.
Why this is so I cannot say.
THE GRIP.
The first essential for a true and
proper stroke, such as will despatch
the ball some two hundred yards or so
upon its course, is a proper grip. It is
difficult to lay down any hard-and-fast
rule about the grip, as some go'fers
adopt one method and some another.
A photograph of my own grip appears
on page 31, and I may say roughly
that I wrap the little finger of the right
hand twice round the thumb of the left
hand before interlocking it with the
middle finger, a sectional view taken
from above showing that only the top
joint of the fourth finger of the right
hand is visible at Greenwich. This
grip, however, is not recommended to
the novice as it demands exceptional
strength in the digital muscles, and
generally speaking it must be re-
membered that a grip which suits
one man may not necessarily suit
another. At the same time it may
be laid down as an essential to the
proper guidance of a club that the grip
should be firm, and yet not unduly
firm, and that the left hand should
hold the club rather more tightly than
the right, although, of course, the right
hand will always maintain a strong
and even pressure upon the leather.
THE STANCE.
Having obtained a happily modulated
grip, as explained above, the novice will
now have to consider the question of
his stance. The stance is one of the
most important essentials for the
proper despatching of the ball, and it
will frequently be found that a foozled
stroke may be traced directly to the
fact that the player was standing too
This appears to be a delightfully
easy proceeding, but too much pains
cannot be taken over doing exactly
what I have described. The faults into
which the tyro most commonly allows
himself to slip are—
1. The locking of the wrists.
2. The involuntary stiffening of the
upper vertebrae.
. The lack of abandon in the action
close to, or, on the other hand, too far of the deltoid muscles.
away from the ball. Again, the
question of the square as opposed to
the open stance is one that has exer-
cised the minds of golfers for genera-
tions. For myself, as will be seen on
page 82, I adopt the open stance, but I
am far from insisting that my readers
should do likewise. Quot homines,
tot sententia. Similarly the dis-
tance at which one should stand
from the ball is one that will vary
according to the physical peculiarities
of the player, and it is impossible to
lay down any golden rule upon the
subject. Generally speaking, however,
it is better to be too near the ball than
too far away from it, if by adopting
the latter position there is any pos-
sibility of being out of reach of it
altogether.
THE Sw1NG.
Having obtained a nicely graduated
stance, as explained in the last section,
the business of the swing will now
commence. Upon a proper swing the
whole success, or otherwise, of the
drive will turn, and I shall therefore
endeavour to analyse it with some
particularity.
Having placed the club head behind
the ball the player must then take it
away with a sweeping movement along
the turf, trending around the legs as
far as is allowed by a circular move-
ment of the arms. The right elbow
must be bent closely into the side, this
action coming into operation before
the club is allowed to describe the
segment of a circle in an upward
direction. The spine meanwhile has
been held rigid, the upper vertebrae
being, if anything, slightly more tense
than the lower, and as the club ascends
the wrists are drawn inwards and
towards the right side, while the
shoulders swing easily round the
central vertebrae, the neck being kept
taut. When the player has gone far
enough upwards, he commences the
downward swing, reversing the process
described above in every detail until the
club head again reaches the ball, where-
upon he will continue the swing in an
upward direction again, only this time
from right to left, the vertebrae, how-
ever, remaining north and south as
before.
|Unless the novice can cure himself
of these faults he can never hope to be
a golfer.
Apart from this, however, there are
certain accidents which happen even to
the best intentioned drive, and it may
be helpful to give the reasons for them
in a brief and comprehensive form.
Slicing. Hands not kept out properly
at the finish.
Sclaffing. Right knee too much bent.
Bulging. Spine not sufficiently taut.
Boosting. Neck a little over-braced.
Glumphing. Vertebrae insufficiently
alert.
Sometimes, however, the player may
find it necessary to bulge on purpose,
as for instance if he wishes to carry
the ladies' tee in a stiff nor'-easter.
To do this he must revolve subtly
round the hips before commencing the
circular movement with the wrists—
the spine, however, remaining calm.
[Several more chapters like this
omitted.
CHAPTER XXX.—ConcLUsion.
I have now come to the end of my
task, and it only remains to express a
hope that the reader who has followed
me intelligently throughout has learnt
sufficient to put him in the way of
becoming at some future date a first-
class player. At the same time it
must be emphasised again that in golf,
as in every other game, the old dictum.
“Practice makes perfect,” holds true.
The novice whose heart is in the game,
and who can spare the time and the
money to devote himself to it exclu-
sively, should, if he have considerable
natural aptitude for athletics, be able
in time, with sufficient practice, to
hold his own with any player of his
own calibre. And if I could feel that
I have in any way helped him towards
this consummation I shall not have
written in vain. A. A. M.
“Though I have not had the hairs of my head
numbered I have had one weighed. It equalled
some trifle in millimetres which I could not
translate into the necessary fragments of a
British ounce.”— Weekly Dispatch.
Oh, but why not ? Have a dash at it.
Reduce them to rupees first of all, and
then by way of hogsheads and cubic
feet to ounces.

THE MUSICAL UNREST.
The Royal Musical Commission held
its fifteenth sitting last Saturday, the
Commissioners present being Sir
FREDERICK BRIDGE (Chairman), Mr.
STEPHEN ADAMs, Mr. ALGERNoN
Ashton and Sir HENRY Wood.
Mr. Popoloffsky, the first witness
called, who is the Honorary Secretary
of the Amalgamated Society of Instru-
mental Musicians, stated that his
baptismal name was Jeremiah Bolster,
but that he had taken the name of
Popoloffsky in self-defence, owing to
the enormous demand for Muscovite
music and musicians.
In reply to Mr. STEPHEN ADAMs, the
witness said that his sympathies were
entirely with native musicians, and
that he hoped under happier circum-
stances to resume his patronymic, but
to do so now would be suicidal. He
had never been in Russia, and could
not say whether it was north or south
of the Equator. He had not been to
see MoRDKIN or PAvLovA.
Sir HENRY Wood : Can you give any
specific instance of intimidation b
foreigners? The witness replied that
on his refusing to eat some sauerkraut
offered him by a German horn-player at
a Viennese bakery the alien threatened
to horsewhip him with a sausage.
Answering further questions by the
President he said that he was not a
Syndicalist. He played the tuba, and
found it hard to make both ends meet.
Mr. ALGERNoN Ashton : A case of
the twopenny tuba, I fear. (Laughter.)
Proceeding, the witness said he
thought it a crying shame that the
Cor Anglais was not called the English
Horn. He was not aware what event
took place in the year 1812, but he
believed it was the battle of Waterloo,
or perhaps the death of NELSON.
Miss Jemima Owbridge, the next
witness, said that, after singing with
marked acceptance in the provinces,
she came up to London to seek engage-
ments. She accordingly sang before
the Manager of the Empress Hall, who
admired her voice, but said he could
not give her an engagement unless she
took finishing lessons in singing from
a Polish master and studied deportment
under M. NIJINSKY. He also wanted
her to change her name. She refused
the offer, and had in consequence been
reduced to earning her living as
a Masked Pierrette. In her opinion
England was being devastated by
Dagos, and it was high time for
Parliament to intervene. She had no
confidence in Conciliation Boards unless
Russians and Prussians were excluded,
especially Russians. Her motto as a
patriotic musician was “Britons never
should be Slavs.”

Diwan-i-khas at
Delhi, of the sale-

of the weighing-room

Unfortunately the
two aims are some-
times found in col-
lision. Clearly the
movement of the plot
cannot be allowed to
be checked while the
eye is being instructed.
By consequence we
have the most poig-

against backgrounds
where in real life the
methods of the higher
drama are almost
habitually neglected.
Thus I have nothing
but praise for the
scenery and costumes
designed for the
Viceroy's Ball in the
Diwan-i-khas, but,
speaking from limited experience (for I
have supped only once in this room of
the PeacockThrone, and danced but once
in the Diwan-i-am, on the floor below),
I cannot easily imagine circumstances
in which the Viceregal festivities would
be suddenly arrested while an English
female tourist, occupying the centre of
the floor, denounced, in clear and bell-
like tones, the alleged infidelity of her
lover, before a curious circle of soldiers,
officials, and native princes.
Again, I admit that I have only
assisted at one blood-stock sale at
Newmarket, but on that occasion
I saw no probability that Messrs.

the comic relief—basso-rilievo, as the
hall-porter of the Umberto might have
called it, for it was never very profound,
but just slightly raised above the flat.
In conclusion, to all who are about
to book accommodation for the Delhi
Durbar at £8 per diem, my advice is to
go and see Mr. Collins's Second Act
at Drury Lane instead. If Hope, in
a general way, is the "expectation of
things not seen, The Hope of Drury
Lane shows you them while you wait.
True, you will miss the elephants and
the ViceRoy, but you will get a lot of
drama thrown in that never occurs in
quite the same shape out there; and
the cost is comparatively trifling. I
grant that you will have to do without
your photograph in The Sketch as one
of that remarkable and intrepid band
of voyagers, but perhaps some day the
Editor will find a still more compelling
reason for its insertion.
If, however, the play is, after all, the
thing, I would appeal to every patriot
to attend, if only for a few hours, and
note what sort of drama it is that comes
home so straight to the bosoms of the
British public. They will find that its
heart is in the right place; that it can
appreciate Poetic Justice when it sees it.
So let us hear no more talk of our
national decadence. O. S.
E.
HOW IT'S DONE.
[“The naval airship at Barrow is now much
lighter than it was, having been relieved of
much of its weight.”—Erening News.]
Now that that is satisfactorily
settled, let me confess that I was
worried about it. I had reasoned out,
with the assistance of my brother
Henry, that there were two separate
and distinct ways of lightening a naval
airship. My brother Henry and myself
had discussed it at breakfast; and
although our conversation had to be
carried on when the waiter was out of
the room. I pride myself that we
handled the discussion with masterful
directness. (You see, we, my brother
and myself, live in a boarding estab-
lishment where they have a German
waiter; and of course you follow me
when I say that matters of grave
national importance cannot be men-
tioned before aliens.)
Well, I pointed out to Henry that
the logical way of lightening a naval
airship was to pump (I believe they
pump) more gas into it, and so make
it lighter in effect, so to speak. I was
rather particular about that “so to
speak,” because it really wouldn't be
any lighter, you know; but, of course,
I did not let my brother Henry know
that, and so the subtlety of my reser-
vation was lost on him. But he had

Doctor (acidly). “When I TREAT A MAN For Liven Trouble HE DIEs of Liv Eil Trot BLE.”
his own view of the question, and said dition that he should recognise the
that, in his opinion, if you wanted to
lighten an airship, all you had to do
was to take some of the heavy parts
away, and that the parts so removed
could follow the airship about in an
Army Service wagon. Poor dear

THE RE-UNION.
I suppose it is because we have been
parted so long that we met again to-
day with—on my part—such sincere
and hearty delight. Never, I think, do
I remember so long a break in our
companionship. Other years, even at
times when we were not living in
actual daily association, there were
sure to be odd occasions (evenings
mostly) when he would turn up un-
expectedly, and we would enjoy a quiet
hour or so together. But this year it
has been different. I had almost for-
gotten what he was like.
Judge then of my emotion this
evening when I entered my study,
all unprepared, and found him there
in his old place, as though the inter-
minable months since we parted had
never been. I protest the whole room
looked different. With a cry of wel-
come I ran forward and held out both
my hands to him. On his side, too,
the greeting was as warm as ever; his
cheery face positively glowed in a way
that did one good to witness.
“This is glorious!" I said. I pulled
my chair forward close beside him,
quite in the old intimate fashion, and
prepared the first really enjoyable pipe
for many months. He gave me a
light, though it is but seldom that he
smokes himself, and we settled down
together for a jolly evening.
It was so restful having him there,
hearing now and again that quiet,
appreciative chuckle of his, which is
for me infinitely preferable to the
epigrams of the most brilliant talker
that ever silenced a dinner-table, that,
little by little, I fancy I must have
slipped into a reverie, not far removed
from slumber. I was thinking drowsily
of all the scenes in my life that this
friend has shared with me, when I
roused myself with a start and a chill
of desolation. He had gone out while
I slept. So great a while is it since
we were together that I had forgotten
his little fancies, the occasional caress,
the offer of refreshment, failing which
he will often, as now, steal from one
unobserved.
It is possible, however, that even yet
he is not wholly gone. He may be
hiding in some obscure corner, and in
that case fortunately I shall know
what to do. A little coaxing and the
proffer of the moining newspaper make
an unfailing lure. I thought so; he
is creeping back. Already behind the
outstretched paper I can hear wel-
come sounds of his return. I must be
more careful in future. Not willingly,
after a whole summer spent in contem-
plating an empty hearth, will I forego
the companionship of My Study Fire.

REMARKABLE DISCOVERY AT THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IN THE OFF-SEASON.
Having exposed certain purely hallucinatory and unflattering resemblances to public men, we need hardly apologise if we turn for a
moment to a genuine and really astonishing case of what we may call geographical persistence of feature.

deportment.)

REVELATIONS.
(Being Platform Essays in the Unexpected.)
THE Rt. Hon. A. J. BALFour, M.P., was the chief
speaker at a great Unionist demonstration held at the
Albert Hall. The LEADER OF THE OPPosition, speaking
with even more than his usual verve and lucidity, devoted
the introductory portion of his speech to an elaborate
disquisition on the True and the Beautiful as exemplified
in Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's financial system, and particularly
in that Rt. Hon. gentleman's celebrated Limehouse oration.
Mr. BALFour continued as follows:–
“If, however, I am asked whether I place the present
CHANCELLoR of THE ExchEQUER first in my list of the great
benefactors of humanity, I must answer unhesitatingly
that there is one whom I am forced to rank above him.
Need I say that I refer to a former colleague and loyal
supporter of my own, that brilliant and inspiring states-
man, Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN. But for his superb and
indefatigable genius we might not now be living in the
anticipated enjoyment of a strong protective tariff. . For
me, indeed, the cause of Protection pure and simple is
something more precious than life itself. To that cause
SECRETARY, “must be sought in the arrogant and brutal
methods of the German Government. It is useless to dis-
guise the fact that every effort at a settlement has been
frustrated by the Germans. What would have been said of
us if we had acted as the Germans have, if we had first sent
a warship to a place where she had no business to be and
had then refused to recall her unless we were heavily paid

grant of special privileges 2 Every indication of a con-
ciliatory disposition on the part of the French has been

The French have throughout behaved with the greatest

have been going the breaking point will soon be reached.
Great Britain is prepared to support France with all
her military, naval and pecuniary resources. That being
the case, you will, I am sure, not misjudge me if I
say emphatically that I do not care twopence for the
GERMAN EMPEROR, for Herr KIDERLEN WAECHTER, or the
whole boiling of them. Let 'em all come, and the more

Speaking at the
annual meeting of the

the Earl of HALs BURY
called on all present to
sink their differences
and rally in support
of their great and

ful to have to notice
the obloquy with which
Mr. BALFour had been
assailed by those who
ought to know better.

eulogy of Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, and resumed his seat in himself, Lord HALSBURY added, had been accused of
dead silence after speaking for an hour and a quarter.
Mr. KEIR HARDIE, M.P., addressing a crowded gathering
of working men at Tonypandy, dealt incisively with the
recent strikes and the riots that followed them. “I have
come to the deliberate conclusion," he said, “that in the
long and turbulent history of industrial disturbances there
has never been a strike so senseless or so devoid of justi-
fication as this. The men were wrong from beginning to
end, and their leaders were, if possible, more foolish and
criminal than the poor fools who followed their advice.
Faced with this unexampled disturbance to the comfort of
the public the Government could only take one course, and
to their everlasting credit they did not hesitate to take it.
As guardians of civilisation it was their plain duty to call
out the military to protect the Railway Companies and
shoot down the wicked and wanton disturbers of the peace.
These are my opinions, and it is just as well that the
public should know them.” The hon. gentleman, aſter
finishing his speech, was accompanied to his lodgings by a
mixed force of infantry, cavalry, artillery and engineers.
Sir Edward GREY, M.P., yesterday made an important
pronouncement in regard to the Morocco crisis at the
dinner of the Stock Exchange Liberal Association. “The
true cause of all our present anxieties,” said the Foreigs
nepotism, but he had scorned to defend himself against
so preposterous a charge. As for the House of Lords,
the sooner they reconciled themselves to their new con-
ditions the better for all concerned. At the subsequent
business meeting of the society, Mr. BALFour and Lord
LANSDown E were, on the motion of Lord HALSBURY, elected
Vice-Presidents for the ensuing year.
The Right Hon. F. E. SMITH, K.C., M.P., who has been
cruising in his silver-gilt 1,000-ton yacht Imperentia (his
diamond-crusted motor-car is at present being repaired),
has arrived at Liverpool and has confided to a gathering of |
his supporters his opinion on the condition of political
parties in the country. Mr. SMITH declared that he was
growing more and more deeply impressed with the fact
that the Liberals had been in office nearly six years. They
had great qualities, which none appreciated more highly
than he. He desired to warn his fellow Conservatives
against the employment of flippancy and frivolity in place
of solid argument. Mere badinage was never likely to
carry a politician far.
We understand that, if the WELLs-Johnson fight takes
place, the Earl's Court Exhibition will be known as the
Black-and-White City.

THE FACE ON THE WALL.
WE were talking of the supernatural
—that endlessly alluring theme—
and most of us had related our pet
instance, without, however, producing
much effect. The little man with the
anxious white face had been silent,
until someone said to him—“And
you, Sir, have you no story for us?”
He thought a moment. “Well,”
he said, “not a story in the ordinary
sense of the word—nothing, that is,
from hearsay, like most of your
examples. Truth I always hold is
not only vastly stranger than fiction
but also vastly more interesting. I
could tell you an occurrence which
happened to me personally, and which,
oddly enough, completed itself only
this morning.”
We begged him to begin.
“A year or so ago,” he said, “I was
in rooms in Great Ormond Street—an
old house on the Holborn side. The
bedroom walls had been distempered
by a previous tenant, but the place
was damp and grea', patches of dis-
colouration had broken out. One of
these-as indeed often happens—was
exactly like a human face, but more
faithfully and startlingly like than is
customary. Lying in bed in the
morning and putting off getting up,
I used to watch it and watch it, and
gradually I came to think of it as real
—as my fellow-lodger, in fact. The
odd thing was that, while the other
patches on the walls grew larger and
changed their contours, this one never
did. It remained identically the same.
“While there I had a very bad
attack of influenza, with complications,
and all day long I had nothing to do
but read or meditate; and it was then
that this face began to get firmer hold
of me. It grew more and more real
and remarkable. It dominated my
thoughts day and night. There was a
curious turn to the nose, and the slant
of the forehead was unique. It was,
in fact, full of individuality—the face
of a man apart, a man in a thousand.
“Well, I got better, but the face
still controlled me. I found myself
searching the streets for one like it.
Somewhere, I was convinced, the real
man must exist, and he and I must
meet. Why, I had no notion; I only
knew that we two were in some way
linked by fate. I frequented places
where men congregate in large num-
bers — political meetings, football
matches, the railway stations where
the suburban trains pour forth their
legions on the City in the morning
and receive them again in the evening,
But all in vain. I had never before
realized, as I then did, how many
different faces of man there are, and
how few. For all differ, and yet,
classified, they belong only to as
many types as you can count on your
hands.
“The search became a mania with
me. I neglected everything else. I
stood at busy corners watching the
crowd until people thought me crazy
and the police began to know me and
be suspicious. Women I never glanced
at ; men, men, men, all the time.”
He passed his hand wearily over
his brow. * * -
“And then,” he continued, “at last
I saw him. He was in a taxi, driving
East along Piccadilly. I turned and
ran beside it for a little way, and then
saw an empty one coming. ‘Follow
that taxi,' I gasped, and leaped in.
The driver managed to keep it in sight,
and it took us to Charing Cross. I
rushed on to the platform and found
my man with two ladies and a little
girl. They were going to France by
the 2.20. I hung about to try to get
a word with him, but in vain. Other
friends had joined the party, and they
moved to the train in a solid body.
“I hastily purchased a ticket to
Folkestone, hoping that I should catch
him before he sailed ; but at Folkestone
he got on board before me, with his
friends, and they disappeared into a
large private saloon, several cabins
thrown into one. Evidently he was a
man of wealth. :
“Again I was foiled ; but I deter-
mined to cross too, feeling certain that
when the voyage had begun he would
leave the ladies and come out for a
stroll on the deck. I had only just
enough for a single fare to Boulogne,
but nothing could shake me now.
I took up my position opposite the
saloon door and waited. After half-
an-hour the door opened and he came
out, but with the little girl. My heart
beat so that it seemed to shake the
boat more than the propeller. There
was no mistaking the face—every line
was the same. He glanced at me and
moved towards the companion-way
for the upper deck. It was now or
never, I felt. ‘Excuse me, Sir,' I
stammered, “but do you mind giving
:me your card. I have a very important
reason for wishing to communicate
with you.' He seemed to be aston-
ished, as indeed well he might; but he
complied. With extreme deliberation
ile took out his card and hurried on
with the little girl. It was clear that
he thought me a lunatic, and considered
it wiser to humour me than not.
“Clutching the card, I hurried to a
deserted corner of the ship and read it.
My eyes dimmed: my head swam : for
on it were the words “Mr. Ormond

Wall,” with an address at Pittsburg,
U.S.A.
“I remember no more until I found
myself in a hospital in Boulogne. There
I lay in a broken condition for weeks,
and only a month ago did I return.”
He was silent. We looked at him
and at one another and waited.
“I went back,” he resumed after a
moment or so, “to Great Ormond Street
and set to work to discover all I could
about this American in whose life I had
so mysteriously intervened. I wrote
to Pittsburg; I wrote to American
editors; I cultivated the society of
Americans in London; but all that I
could find out was that he was a mil-
lionaire, with English parents who had
resided in London. But where 2 To
that question I received no answer.
“And so the time went on until
yesterday morning. I had gone to bed
more than usually tired and slept till
late. When I awoke the sun was
streaming into the room. As I always
do, I looked at once at the wall on
which the face is to be seen. I rubbed
my eyes and sprang up in alarm. It
was only partly visible. Last night it
had been as clear as ever; almost I
could hear it speak. And now it was
but a ghost of itself.
“I got up, dazed and dejected, and
went out. The early editions of the
evening papers were already out, and
on the contents bill I saw ‘American
Millionaire's Motor Accident.' I bought
a copy and read at once what I knew I
should read. Mr. Ormond Wall, the
Pittsburg millionaire, and party, motor-
ing from Spezzia to Pisa, had come
into collision with a waggon and were
overturned. Mr. Wall's condition was
critical. I went back to my room,
still dazed, and sat on the bed looking
at the face on the wall. And, even as
I looked, suddenly it disappeared.
“This morning I found that Mr. Wall
had succumbed to his injuries at what
I take to be that very moment.”
Again he was silent.
“Most remarkable !” we all said.
“Most extraordinary !” and so forth.
And we meant it too.
“Yes,” said the man at last, “there
are three extraordinary, three most
remarkable, things about my story.
One is that it should be possible for
discolouration in a lodging-house in
London not only to form the features
of a gentleman in America, but to
have this intimate association with
his existence. It will take science
some time to explain that. Another
is that that gentleman's name should
bear any relation to the spot on which
his features were being so curiously
reproduced by some mysterious agency.
Is it not so 2 ''
We agreed with him, and our original
discussion on supernatural manifest-
ations set in again with increased
excitement, during which the narrator
of this amazing experience rose and
said “Good-night.” Just as he was at
the door one of the company recalled
us to the cause of our excited debate
by asking him before he left what he
considered to be the third extraordinary
thing in connection with his deeply
interesting story. “You said three
things, you know."
“Oh, the third thing,” he said, as
he opened the door; “I was forgetting
that. The third extraordinary thing
about the story is that I made it up
an hour ago. Good-night again.”

A MAN OF PEACE.
[The General Manager of the North-Eastern,
giving evidence before the Railway Commission,
expressed a wish that they could have a revised

I saw his savage teeth;
I also noticed on his head
A simple olive wreath.

“How comes it, then, you have an air
So warlike? Tell me why.”
“I has my orders straight,” said he,
“To teach this blackleg lot

Or else they gets it hot.”

And, ten to one, all loyal men,

For terror of their lives.” -

(After “Tay Pay.”) -
Of all the stately houses a which it
has been my lot to be an honoured
guest none has impressed me so
strongly with its hospitable culture as
Skibo Castle. From the first notice at
the entry to the domain, “This watu
the goff linx,” the keynote of culture
is struck.
But when I entered the stately
dining hall, a little while ago, and beheld
twelve stalwart pipers playing beneath
a motto, “Peas and Good Will,” whilst
my host and the kilted CHANCELLOR
danced a gay reel before dinner I felt
that this was one of the greatest days
of my life.
I can but Boswellise such fragments
of conversation as I caught during the
meal at the moments when the pipers
stopped from exhaustion.
“Although, of course, of pure Welsh
blood, I was actually born in Man-
chester,"said the CHANCELLOR. (“Order
Manchester five Free Libraries,” said
Mr. CARNEGIE to the Library Secretary,
who always stands behind him at a
meal.) “But I owe everything to the
inspiration of the wonderful Welsh
hills near Criccieth.” (“See if Criccieth
has had a Library. If not, why not 2"
murmured the Laird.) “Had it not
been for Criccieth there might have
been no Limehouse.” (“Limehouse,
one. Make a note of it,” said Mr.
CARNEGIE). “From a child the tyranny
of the landed proprietors sank deeply
into my soul; now they talk about my
tyranny - -
“Just their lack of culture,” inter-
rupted Mr. CARNEGIE. “If they'd had
a Library in the neighbourhood they'd
have been reading my “Triumphant
Democracy, a work without which no
Library is complete.”
“Now if you could use your in-
fluence to introduce phonetic spelling
into Wales—" … --> -
“My dear Sir," exclaimed the
CHANCELLOR with sparkling eyes,
“Welsh is the only language which
is spelt precisely as it is pronounced."
“Make a note,” said Mr. CARNEGIE
to his secretary, “to provide a National
Welsh Library at Aberystwith.”
“My idea about the settlement of
Labour disputes is the intervention of
a man of supreme tact at the critical
moment."
“No, Sir," said the millionaire, “you
should take a hint from Pittsburg,
where I made my pile. Surround your
works with barbed wire fencing; charter
an armed force of PINKERTON's de-
“They'd better
tectives; put up a notice, ‘We shall
shute if yu kum,' so that the strikers
will readily comprehend it; provide a
Free Library for the defenders, and there
you are.”
“But, my dear Laird, what about
the votes ?"
“You see,” said the CHANCELLor,
“you pay fourpence a week and get nine
pennyworth of benefit. The sick get
attention, the unemployed relief, the
doctors get more pay, the employers get
better labour.” -
“Why, your Bill is almost as great a
blessing as a Protective Tariff.”
“And yet,” sighed the CHANCELLOR,
“people are discontented with it."
“Just the same with a Protective
Tariff. . But dear rails in the States
mean cheap Libraries here.”
-- -, * - ** k . - :-
“The bravest deed I ever heard of !”
said the CHANCELLOR meditatively. “It
was during the recent strike. We felt
strongly that the ordinary routine of
civilization must go on. Unless the
Post-Office could be kept in operation
there would be serious difficulty and
delay in the collection of the taxes.
So with calm courage my colleague,
SAMUEL, faced the Dictator and de-
manded passes for the mails.”
“Splendid!" cried the Laird. “Make
a note of the PostMASTER-GENERAL's
name for the Hero Fund.”
“Hurroo !" I shouted, carried away
by this prompt tribute to bravery. The
Laird's genial eye settled upon me.
“And two Free Libraries for the Scot-

SOLDIERS ALL.
| Being an extract from that popular music-hall sketch “The Fighting
Carson.”]
[The scene is an open place before one of the walled cities
on the way to Cork. The new Ulster Constituion
is in being, the salaried positions have been dis-
tributed, and the Great March from Belfast to
Cork has begun. Enter President Carson followed
by Field-Marshal J. B. Lonsdale, Archbishop
Craig, Lord Chief Justice Moore, and the rest of
the indomitable Orange Army.
Field-Marshal Lonsdale (to his troops). Now then, fall in
there, please. Knickerbockers one pace to the front.
Trousers one pace back. That looks much better. Private
Tomkins, I don't think you will want your macintosh ; the
weather seems to be holding up. Gentlemen, the President
will now address you on the eve of battle.
President Carson. Gentlemen of the jury—

President Carson. My error; what I meant to say was
this:

As (say) a tidy practice at the Bar—
Confusing issues, making black look white,
And bullying a witness in the box;
But when the blast of war blows in our ears
Then imitate the action of the orange,
Puff out the cheeks with apoplectic rage
Well paragraphed and nicely advertised.
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect—
Like this; and let the overhanging brow
Bulging with brains (as noticed by The Post)
Give it an air of deadly resolution. ,
And now, ye noblest of the Irish race,
Whose blood is come from fathers proved in words,
Fathers that like so many Edward Carsons
Have in these parts from morn till even talked
Nor ever failed for lack of argument

Who but a fool could put such words together ?

I fight his Navy, yes—but not the King;
I take up arms against his Government,
But that is not to fight against the King ; º
When have I hurt the person of the King, i
I who have taken oath to serve the King? |
Lord Chief Justice Moore. I will make a note of your
point, President. Believe me, I quite appreciate it. Of
course the position is really this, Ulster will not submit to
the Irish Parliament, therefore it cannot be governed by
the Irish Parliament. But it must be governed somehow.
therefore it is the duty of every loyal and patriotic Irish-
man to establish an Ulster Parliament. Now a Parliament
formed by loyal and patriotic Irishmen must be a loyal
and patriotic Parliament, from which it follows that any
Government which differs from it is ipso facto disloyal and
unpatriotic. Hence the King's Government at West-
minster is disloyal and unpatriotic, and thereſore in
resisting it by force we are only doing our duty as loyal
and patriotic Irishmen. That, I take it, is the situation
in brief ? º

THE ROYAL MUSICAL
COMMISSION.
STARTLING EVIDENCE.
THE Royal Musical Commission held
its thirty-first sitting on Saturday last.
The Commissicners present were Sir
FREDERick BRIDGE (Chairman), Mr.
THOMAS BEECHAM, the LoRD CHIEF
JUSTICE, Madame CLARA BUTT and
Mr. ALGERNoN Ash ox.
Mr. HENRY BIRD, the first witness,
declared that he had no animus against
foreigners, or indeed against anyone.
He had accompanied songs written by
composers of every European national-
ity with equal zeal, and he might be
allowed to add that he was very
partial to Gharlotte Russe, Neapolitan
ices and French beans. But he could
not help feeling gravely disquieted by
the announcement that forty geese
were to be employed in the forthcoming
production of HUMPERDINck's Königs-
kinder, in view of the widely-current
belief that they were to be imported
from Strasbourg. Gastronomically con-
sidered, he was quite prepared to admit
the excellence of Strasbourg geese, but
he was convinced that the English ||
variety was fully equal to the needs
of the situation alike in histrionic
aptitude, stage presence and intensity
of sibilation.
Signor Annibale Spaghetti, the
President of the Amalgamated Society
of Savoyard Piano-organists, described
the circumstances which had led to
the sympathetic strike declared by
his union during the recent railway
troubles. It was due, he said, to the
friendly attitude of Sir Edward GREY
to the Young Turks, which, in view of
the troubles in Tripoli, constituted a
deliberate challenge to the important
community settled in Saffron Hill.
The music-famine in the East-end had,
he admitted, been attended with pain-
ful results, and street-dancing had
almost come to a stand-still; but they
had no option in the matter. During
the strike his men had subsisted
almost entirely on the flesh of their
monkeys. (Sensation.) - -
Mr. Max Bamberger, who wore a
kilt and was attended by his wife and
his two twin sons, Wolfgang Bartholdy
and Johann Sebastian Bamberger, said
that his Scotch nationality had won for
him respect in all quarters of the globe.
When he was kidnapped by terrorists
at Odessa, a few words in Gaelic and
the slogan of the Clan Bamberger had
reduced his savage captors to coma.
Personally he was strengly in favour of
free trade in music, and he knew that
his father-in-law, Sir Pompey Boldero,
shared his views. If Russians were

and elsewhere with the same freedom

from the point of view of the Press,
would be little short of a national

approval in a spirited unisonal fantasia

Sir Pompey Boldero, who next
appeared, said that he was the father
of Mrs. Bamberger and the father-in-
law of Mr. Bamberger. It was also
true that he was the grandfather of the
privilege, and the consciousness of it
had supported him during the recent
unrest. At this point Sir Pompey was
overcome by emotion and was assisted
from the room by the LoRD CHIEF
JUSTICE and Madame CLARA DUTT.
The Commission adjourned for a fort-

fully before continuing his evidence on
the subject of the recognition of inter-
national musical unions.

THE BREAKING PoinT.
I AM not of the tribe of those
Who maim the solemn rites of golf
By publishing abroad their woes
When things do not, as they suppose,
Come rightly off; -
Who, careless what the cause may be,
Give every care an instant voice
With terms suspiciously like D--,
Or, if there's something still more free,
Use that, for choice.
For me, whate'er of sorrows come,
I seldom seem to care a fig :
The blows whereat they make things
hum -
I bear with placid otium,
And equal dig.
If I should leave the narrow “line,”
Or foozle wheresoe'er I go,
I think, no doubt, the fault was mine,
(A soothing thing) and I decline
To care a blow.
And, when some fair and dazzling shot
Lands in a hazard's horrid grip,
Misfortune is the common lot,
I recollect, and I do not
Let myself rip.
And thus, secure from verbal lapse,
I hold in check my secret bile,
And wear upon my frosty chaps
A smile—it is not much, perhaps,
But still, a smile.
But, when at length I reach the goal
And, wearing still my stoic mask,
Have nought before me but to roll
The ball into a yawning hole
(An infant's task),
And when, for some unfathomed cause,
That callous ball disdains the tin,
Goes here, goes there, or dares to pause
(Ah piteous !) on its very jaws,
But won't go in,
There comes upon me such a sense
Of being doomed—a thing accurst—
Of mystery, of impotence,
That I, in very self-defence,
Must speak, or burst.
Ah yes. The harmless “pool," or “tut”
Suffice me, nine times out of ten,
Through evil chance or error—but
If once I'm fairly off my putt,
You hear me then.
DUM-DUM.
“ Ealing is to have another All-British Shop-

Why did no one think of this before?
It seems so simple.
THE SUK-SUK.
“Moi RA,” I said, “the Garden Suburb
is full of young wives; it is full of
sweetly pretty Edward-VII.-style bijou
cottage maisonettes; it is full of hus-
bands as affectionate as I am ; but I
decline to believe that the ladies whom
I encounter drifting about in djibbas
ever touch a brush or a dust-pan, or
that their abodes are so uninhabitably
speckless as ours. Therefore T pro-
pose —”
“I know what you propose.” Moira
put down the dust-pan and sat on the
landing stairs.
- “You propose that we
should keep a second servant. Well,
it is a peculiarity of Garden Suburb
bijou Edwardian maisonettes that the
kitchen premises accommodate one ser-
vant only. If we had two, they would
have to stand on each other's shoulders:
the lower one to cook, the upper one to
polish the silver. When you can find
a pair of unimpeachably respectable
female acrobats anxious to abandon the
glamour of the stage—”
“My dear, you are too hasty' " I
sat down beside her, upsetting the dust-
pan through the banisters into the
lobby. -
“Impulsiveness has always been my
failing, hasn't it 2." She peered mourn-
fully after the dust-pan. “Yes, thanks,
Mary” (to the servant below), “you'd
better sweep up the pieces of that
electric-light bulb. A caller might
tread on them. Yes, dear?" (to me).
“You were proposing that 2 ”
“That we should introduce some
science into our house instead of this
wearisome and umpractical hand-work.
As SHAw says, “The human hand is a
clumsy tool.” No doubt some manual
cleansing is unavoidable; but surely
this meticulous attention to the carpets
and the stairs might be done away
with if we employed a Suk-Suk.”
“A what 2 ”
“A Suk-Suk. It 's a new kind of
vacuum cleaner.”
“Too expensive for us.”
“IHasty again!” I reproved her. “Its
price is one guinea.”
“Then it 's no use.”
“That remains to be discovered. I
have bought a Suk-Suk. The errand-
boy is at this moment delivering our
Suk-Suk at the door. I knew that
unless I forced labour-saving methods
on you it would be futile to plead for
them. Yes, here it is. (Thank you,
Mary. Yes, you can put the parcel
down there.) Now we shall see
whether science cannot lighten your
tasks.” I proceeded to unwrap the
Suk-Suk.
It emerged from its swathings, a
spidery instrument with a long metal
neck sprouting from a frog-like pair of
bellows actuated by a sort of winch.
“Charming, isn't it?” I said. “It is
a French invention, and just as good as
our most costly English things. The
French housewife is so practical. Here
are the directions.” . -
The leaflet of polyglot instructions
for the use of the Suk-Suk was adorned
by a coloured picture of an aproned
houri propelling the machine, with
languid grace, across a vast interior.
The carpet was black, except in the
wake of the Suk-Suk. Amazing Suk-
kuk Wherever it had browsed it re-
vealed that the carpet (you'd never
have guessed it) was, beneath its grime,
a gorgeous cross between Axminster
and Persian, with a dash of croquet-
lawn as groundwork.
“That,” I said, pointing to the pic-
|ture, “is how the Suk-Suk works. That
is what our carpets will look like in
future.”
“Let us hope not.”
dubious.
“Ten minutes' run round the house
of a morning with the Suk-Suk, and
you'll be able to go a drifting in djibbas
with the best of 'em,” I added proudly.
“Let us try it,” said Moira.
I placed the Suk-Suk in position,
ground the winch, and directed the
mouth (it had a curious uncanny mouth
—a sort of grin of a mouth—rather a
sardonic grin, from certain aspects) at
the carpet . . .
The carpet didn't, somehow, look so
very different. No pattern emerged in
the path of the sardonic grin. How-
ever, to expect anything else was
absurd, unless the Suk-Suk nibbled
off the whole pile and uncovered the
foundation below ; for the carpet was
a plain felt.
“Is it really gathering up the dust?”
asked Moira. “I don't see much alter-
ation.” -
“Microscopic particles are whirling
down its rapacious maw in millions,”
I explained; “It Gulps Grime,' the
advertisement says.”

“You cannot see the vanishing dust,
of course. But when we open this
box at the bottom we shall find how
'searching is the vacuum method of
cleaning.”
I worked for a while. “Now we
shall see what we shall see.” I opened
the box.
But the box was empty. No swathes
of dust lay within, no nauseating mats
of cobwebs. -

I took a letter from my pocket, tore
it into small fragments, and scattered
them on the floor. “Now watch !”
Madly I ground the winch and
pushed the sardonic grin across, the
floor over the papers.
Queer; they didn't budge.
I ground harder and harder, and
pressed the sardonic grin tightly down.
“Mustn't let the air run in from the

themselves more obstinately to the floor.

Moira, “for flattening carpets. Ours

“Dear old boy, do you think that
when a guinea vacuum cleaner was
advertised, I missed it? I positively
ran to the ironmonger's, and made a
perfect fright of myself, testing every
Suk-Suk in the place, in the frantic
hope of finding one that would work.
The whole shop was full of women
(djibba women, too!) eager to try them.
We fought with each other for them—
and then, having tried every single one,
returned home sadly to our brooms
and dust-pans. Last time I was in the
shop I was told that the whole stock
of Suk-Suks had been returned to the
makers. ‘A French toy,' the shopman

called them. “We've returned all but
one, which was shop-soiled,’ he said.
‘How we'll get rid of it, I don't know.’”
I looked at Moira. Then I looked
at the Suk-Suk. “Yes,” said Moira,
“that's the one. You've bought it.
I recognise it.”
“They'll have to take it back ' "
I frowned fiercely.
“Oh, they'll take it back, if I ask
them very nicely. They know me; and

“DEAREST Ivy, The two sons of
King M'Bhumpo arrived to-day. It is
awkward, especially as Mamma has
always thought such a lot of birth and
position, but they pay extravagantly,
and Papa has been nearly ruined by
the last Budget. They are coal-black,
with wide staring eyes and large lips
and feet. -
They are called Sloko and Shanti.
Their manners at dinner were quite
foreign. Sloko threw chicken bones
over his head and hit Benson behind
|-
him, and Shanti asked Papa how many
wives he had. They thought the
mutton was bulldog. fe
The use of the bathroom was ex-
plained to them, and they each had a
bath in the morning, and screamed all
the time. They declare they cannot
sleep another night under a roof, and
have built a wigwam in the garden and
lit a fire beside it. The dogs were
frantic, and the gardener has given
notice. In the evening the vicarage
people dined with us; Mamma thought
it would be a good influence for heathen
boys. Shanti played the tomtom very
loud, and Sloko explained to Miss
Montgomery, the Vicar's daughter, that
he had a complete history of his
country tattooed on his back, and
would be very pleased to show it to us.
Next day—hunting. Sloko killed
the carriage dog, and Shanti speared a
swan and two of the ducks. We were
not in time to stop them, as they shout
very loud when excited, and cannot
hear. After lunch they offered to per-
form their war dance and song in
the drawing-room, but, as Mamma is
dreadfully particular about the furni-
ture, Papa told : them we could not
think of trespassing on their generosity.
Sloko is a captain in his father's army;
he says he had to take an oath to kill
two white men before he is twenty-one.
He hasn't killed anybody yet.

stayed for hours in their bedrooms and

Benson with a Church Catechism, but
they took no notice. At last Papa gave
them enough opium to poison several

morning. ‘º
Sloko very ill. Refused to see a
doctor—he says he wants an African
medicine man. Shanti beat a tom-tom
in his room and closed the windows
and chimney to keep out devils. Papa
feared the sleeping sickness, but Benson
says it is only the effects of having
taken a bath. Sloko recovered by dinner-
time, and proposed to me afterwards,
also to Miss Montgomery. Papa feels
depressed about his efforts to train them
in the customs of English gentlemen.
Sloko showed signs of insanity next
day; Shanti says it is hereditary in
their tribe. Papa cabled to King
M'Bhumpo to remove them.
Shanti has caught insanity. He has
turned so pale that we are afraid Sloko
may mistake him for a white man and
kill him. -
Papa thought it better not to wait
for the King's reply, and has had them
removed. We feel more comfortable
now. We shall not be taking any more
African princes just at present.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE MARIO.NETTES.”
I wrote a fortnight ago of a per-
plexed husband at Wyndham's. His
wife, you may remember, had threat-
ened to leave him, but his sister, Mrs.
Margell, thought of a plan. “It was,”
I explained, “quite a simple plan—the
dear old one, in fact, which gets
another woman into the house in order
to make the wife jealous. Mrs. Margell
was, no doubt, a great playgoer, and
had seen this plan working success-
fully on the stage hundreds of times;
so she had confidence in recommending
it.”
That was only a fortnight ago. To
have seen the same plan working
again at The Comedy would have
been too much ; I don't know how
one could have dealt with it. Luckily
M. PIERRE Wolff has hit upon an
entirely different plot. In The Mari-
onettes it is the woman who flirts
with another man in order to make the
somewhat unkind by showing, another week, the effect of a Turkish occupation of Italy.)
|F TURKEY BECAME ITALIAN 1
(Our artist is perfectly capable of persuading himself that he can soothe the feelings of anyone who feels the above drawing to be
husband jealous ! You would never
have thought of this.
Well, that finishes it. I don't see
what variations are left to the play-
wright now, unless of course he per-
suades the children to kiss the nurse
in order to make the mother jealous.
Yes, I have been hasty; there is still
that to come. In the meanwhile we
must content ourselves with what we
can get at The Comedy. Anyhow we
get Sir John HARE and Miss MARIE
LöHR. It is Miss LöHR who makes
her husband (Mr. ARTHUR Wontner)
jealous; but you mustn't think that
Sir John is left out in the cold. As a
young man he had written a love-
letter to himself in order to make his
wife jealous—with, I need hardly say,
the usual success.
His niece is stimulated by the rela-
tion of this episode, but I fancy she
must also have been a little piqued to
find that, after all, her plan was not an
original one. By the way, this uncle,
M. de Ferney, is a very old man. It
is just possible that in him we have
discovered the first and only begetter
of the Great Idea, seeing that he was
working it fifty years ago.
The acting was excellent. It was
delightful to have Sir John HARE back
again and in a character so perfectly
suited to him. Miss LöHR, as charming
as ever, had to play something more
emotional than the light comedy parts
to which she has been accustomed
lately, but she was fully equal to it.
Mr. ARTHUR Wontner was a little
angular but very much in earnest as
the husband, and Mr. C. M. LowNE
helped the play along enormously with
much happy conversation. It was al-
ways a pleasure to see his head come in
at the door; if he had only looked in
for his music he could still be relied
upon for a chat. M.

field in the dark (1810), his native
wife being in attendance. Subsequently |
(present day) the great-grandson of this
officer, and the great-granddaughter of
the officer's wife (why this invidious
distinction is made in their parent-
age it is not for me to conjecture)
meet in exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional, because it is contrary to
habit for the heir to an English title
to run over to Portugal for the purpose
of un-arthing a possible claimant to
that title. However, I do not quarrel
with this design, nor with his arrival
at a little Portuguese fish-
ing village in full military
uniform, accompanied by
part of a squadron of British
troopers, and a slight Ameri-
can accent. These things
happen in comic opera, or,
rather in musical comedy.
What I do complain of, and
bitterly, is that he and his
Lancers should be dressed in
the c. udest vermilion, to the
great detriment of a very
charming colour-scheme.
For I could not desire a
more attractive scene than
this of the sunny village by
the quay, with its climbing "
street (practicable through-
out), its garrulous folk in |
their picturesque dresses (the
women swaying nicely from
the hips), and its pleasant
harmonies of local colour.
And then came the vermilion
Lancers, terribly British, and
made everything silly and
banal. Up to this point the
play had gone gaily and with
the right air of - whimsical
frivolity. Even the settled

singing, with a touch of the Portuguese
method in his enunciation—
“She is fair
Beyond-a compare"—
was a source of general merriment; but
the arrival of the vermilion Lancers
changed everything. If only the tenor-
hero (Mr. WHEATLEy) could have
worked himself into the spirit of the
scene I might have forgiven him his
uniform. But with his stout figure and
his stodgy personality he might have
stepped clean out of second-class
“Grand "Opera. He gave the atmo-
sphere no chance. How Bonita pre-
ferred him to the slim and agile gentle-
man who played the soi-disant villain
I cannot imagine. It is true that, on
the first appearance of the hero, she
Mannerton ...
sang what I understood to be a song of
farewell; but this must have been a
mistake on her part, for she really
loved him at sight with all the fervour
of a life-long devotion.
Over the second scene—laid in a
cloister, very formal in the regularity
of its ruins—the shadow of the Lancer
still lay, though he troubled the stage
very little with his actual presence.
It was vain to hope that the ordeal
of St. Antony would ſail to consign
Bonita to the arms of that unsympa-
thetic lover. Indeed, the interest rather
lay with the minor characters, of whom

Miss CLARA EveLYN, in the title

perilous slope of the stage, and the
necessity (so restricted was the area
of the quay-side) of including the top

operations. I could tell at once that
the Portuguese style of dancing is not
seen at its best on the top of a sea-wall.

moments, though the sneezing-fit that
crowned them did not perhaps offer
the very freshest material. Finally, if
sinuous gestures and a most intelli-
gent energy could have done it, Mr.
MACKINDER as Frederico would have
snatched a triumph for the piece.
Mr. FRASER-SIMson's music was
pleasantly fluent, and Mr. WADHAM
PEAcock's lyrics, of which from time
to time I caught a phrase or two,
seemed passable, if not up to the
standard of Mr. ADRIAN Ross. The
house, on the second night, was friendly
in patches, one very loyal patch being
contingent to my own stall.
I should be sorry to predict
failure for an opera that
shows at least some novelty
of idea in a very pretty
setting. Besides, it takes a
lot to make any comic opera
fail. But I do not think it
will set either the Thames or
the Tagus on fire.
Yet there must be some-
thing more in it than catches
the eye, or why, you may well
ask, should Mr. GRANville
BARKER have done it the
compliment of “producing"
it? At present the mystery
lies unsolved. Can he con-
ceivably have an interest in

spots of Portugal and the

The worst of modifying an
old theme on the stage is
that it lets loose the pedantry
of the critics. Personally I
think that, while he was about
it, Mr. AUSTIN STRONG might
* have seized the chance of a
satire on modern developments in
England. But, if he has succeeded in
transmuting baser metal into gold of
even ten carats only, it is a graceless
task to remind him that he has been
tampering with the original.
Like many other playwrights he has
made the mistake of spreading himself
at the start as if he had all eternity
before him; lavishing on his First
Act a wealth of detail out of all
relation to its value as a contribu-
tion to the main issue. For result, by
the time he reaches his climax he runs
the risk of exhausting himself, or his
audience, or both. Certainly I was a
little disappointed over the reunion

Rip and Minna. Miss WINIFRED EMERY

in her passage of reminiscence; but
somehow—well, perhaps Mr. CYRIL
MAUDE's make-up was too repulsively
venerable (after all, he need only have
been about seventy), and one felt that
the fact of his not having had a bath
for fifty years must have mitigated the
loyalty of the most devoted of lovers.
For the rest, one's intercst, on the
ethical side, was perhaps not too
closely arrested, but one's ordinary
senses, like Rip's, were kept on the
alert. He had all five of them on the
stage at once dancing gracefully in
gauzy draperies to the designs of Miss
INA PELLY, and one never, knew but
what at any moment the most appalling
of bogies might emerge from behind a
Kaatskill rock.
The episode of the copper-bowl,
whose furbishing was to be the test of
Ičip's reformation, was a pleasant piece
of symbolism; but I confess that, apart
from the moral significance of his
effort, I wish that he had let the thing
alone, for I greatly preferred the look
of it in its original state.
Mr. MAUDE, both in youth and eld,
was admirable, and proved once more
that, like SHAKSPEARE, he is not for
any particular age, but for the whole
gamut of them. The minor charac-
ters were all efficient, and the children
charming, especially one pert little
prodigy. Perhaps they had been a little
over-drilled; for their movements were
rather too uniform for spontaneity.
Mr. John HARwooD, as the two
Dobbses, grandson and grandfather,
both patrons of the gentle art, played
with great naturalness. Following so
close upon a similar attraction in
Pomander Walk, it looks as if this
item—a fisherman, always on the
stage and never getting a bite—was
to be a permanent feature at . The
Playhouse. I hope so, for indeed it is
always a moving spectacle.
I must not conclude without men-
tioning the dog Schneider. The meet-
ing between him and the young Rip
was among the most pathetic incidents
of the play. It was for this beloved
sheepdog that Rip's first enquiries
were made on returning from prison.
Yet Schneider received the news of his
master's home-coming with something
worse than indifference. His nose
recoiled with apparent repugnance
from Rip's embraces, and he scooted
off at top speed the very moment he
was released.
Subsequently we were given to
understand that Rip had mislaid
Schneider in the course of his pilgrim-
age into the hills; but the cold fact
is that the dog couldn't be induced
even to start with him. O. S.

Shunned all the products of TRUMAN
AND HANBURY,
Keeping my appetite under control.
Spite of this very curtailed commis-
sariat,
Hateful alike to my palate and eyes,
Wainly I struggled to keep Little Mary
at
Even a fairly respectable size.
Wholly defiant of anti-ſats (various),
Ever my girth grew the greater, until
Someone commended a tonic sol-ſa-
rious,
And I proceeded to bawl with a will.
Now I give rein to my native voracity
And, as I dine off the fat of the land,
Joy that a kindly adviser's sagacity
Showed me how simply my bulk
could be banned.
Slender I am and so graceful and
willowy
That, down at Margate, when gazing
upon
My fairy form as it bathed in the
billowy,
People remarked, “What a beautiful
swan.”
“The latter vessel reports having a hole forty
feet long across the bows—due to the impact of
stopping the engines. She was badly out by
the starboard propeller.”—The Statesman.
“The latter vessel reports having encountered
a whale, forty feet long, across her bows. The
impact stopped the engines. The whale was
fearfully cut by the ºri propeller.”
The Englishman.
Anyhow it was forty feet long. That's
the point.

248 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. ſocronel 4, 1911.
CRAGWELL END.
PART I.
TheRE's nothing I know of to make you spen l
A day of your life at Cragwell End.
It's a village quiet and grey and old,
A little village tucked into a fold
(A sort of valley, not over wide)
Of the hills that flank it on either side.
There's a large grey church with a square stone t
And a clock to mark you the passing hour
In a chime that shivers the village calm
With a few odd bits of the 100th psalm.
A red-brick Vicarage stands thereby,
Breathing comfort and lapped in ease,
With a row of elms thick-trunked and high,
And a bevy of rooks to caw in these.
'Tis there that the Revd. Salvyn Bent
(No tie could be neater or whiter than his tie)
Maintains the struggle against dissent,
An Oxford scholar er Æde Christi ;
And there in his twenty-minute sermons
He makes mince-meat of the modern Germans
Defying their apparatus criticus
Like a brave old Vicar,
A famous sticker
To Genesis, Exodus and Leviticus.
He enjoys himself like a hearty boy
Who finds his life for his needs the aptest :
But the poisoned drop in his cup of joy -
Is the Revd. Joshua Fall, the Baptist,
An earnest man with a tongue that stings—
The Vicar calls him a child of schism–
Who has dared to utter some dreadful things
On the vices of sacerdotalism,
And the ruination
Of education
By the Church of England Catechism.
Set in a circle of oak and beech,
North of the village lies Cragwell Hall;
And stretching far as the eye can reach,
Over the slopes and beyond the fall
Of the hills so keeping their guard about it
That the north wind never may chill or flout i,
Through forests as dense as that of Arden,
With orchard and park and trim-kept garden,
And farms for pasture and farms for tillage,
The Hall maintains its rule of the village.
And in the Hall
Lived the lord of all,
Girt round with all that our hearts desire
Of leisure and wealth, the ancient Squire.
. He was the purplest-faced old man
Since ever the Darville race began,
Pompous and purple-faced and proud;
With a portly girth and a voice so loud
You might have heard it a mile away
O V C''',
When he cheered the hounds on a hunting day.
He was hard on dissenters and such encroachers,
He was hard on sinners and hard on poachers;
... He talked of his rights as one who knew
That the pick of the earth to him was due :
The right to this and the right to that,
To the humble look and the lifted hat;
The right to scold or evict a peasant,
The right to partridge and hare and pheasant;
The right to encourage discontent
By raising a hard-worked farmer's rent;
| none says the right things and all demand pronunciations by
The manifest right to ride to hounds
Through his own or anyone else's grounds;
The right to eat of the best by day
And to snore the whole of the night away;
For his motto, as often he explained,
Was “A Darville holds what a Darville gainc i.”
He tried to be just, but that may be
Small merit in one who has most things free;
And his neighbours averred,
When they heard the word,
“Old Darville's a just man, is he 2 Bust his
Gills, we could do without his justice' "
A NEW WAY WITH FOREIGNERS.
The world is full of phrase-books in foreign tongues; but
the owner. What is wanted is a swift and efficient means
of communication between traveller and waiter without the
humiliation of distorting one's honest English mouth and
debasing one's good English accent. After much thought
we have invented a new medium, superseding both speech
and the clumsiness of the phrase-book, namely, a series of
inexpensive cardboard discs, which can be carried easily in
the pocket or reticule, and may on occasion be reclaimed by
the prudent and economical (or might indeed be thrown
back at them with lightning speed), on which will be printed
the controlling sentences of a foreign tour.
To print the whole series would be too considerable a task
and would involve loss of profit to the inventors; but a few
specimens may be given.
For ticket-inspectors on Continental trains :
I know I am in a first-class compartment with a second-
class ticket, but there are no seats in the second-class and
this compartment was empty. Still, if you will only stop
talking and gesticulating and looking like the man who runs
the guillotine, I will move quietly into the corridor and stand
for the rest of the 500 miles.
Please hold up as many fingers as there are minutes to
wait at this station.
I'or porters : -
I want one porter, and one only, to carry these two small
bags. To that porter I will give 50 centimes for each bag;
and no more. Howsoever many men you allow to help you
I shall pay only one.
For hotel managers :
I know that your hotel is absolutely free from mosquitoes:
but please have mosquito curtains fixed to my bed.
For waiters : º
We are very hungry and tired. Bring the wine at once,
and some butter. We should like other things too ; but
bring the wine, even if the order strikes you as insane.
For a guide :
I do not want a guide. -
For the same guide, two minutes later:
I still do not want a guide.
For the same guide, at intervals : ...,
I do not want a guide.
For a barber:
I want almost nothing taken off; just the merest trim.
For the same barber at the end of the sitting :
I said I wanted only a mere trim. You have made me
look like a billiard ball. You are an incapable.
From the specimens given it will be gathered that the
traveller will not only simplify his daily life abroad but
endear himself to all he meets.

My seeming harmless early cup,
Science reminds me I've enjoyed
A highly poisonous alkaloid
Which slays the nerves with its abuses
And plays the deuce with all one's
Juices. -
The breakfast coffee I adore so
Is just as fatal, only more so.
The glass of lager, icy cool—
Pray, who would touch it but a fool
When in its amber depths one sees
Gout, rheumatism, Bright's disease ?

For in thy dark recess reposes
Grim liver trouble and cyrrhosis;
In alcohol, whate'er its form,
A million million perils swarm.
But deadlier yet the rain-cloud's

The much-belauded fatal water;
The monstrous regiment of germs

And start all kinds of kidney trouble.

You fall at once an easy prey.

Immense the perils of the bath.

As like as not your heart will stop ;
While if, again, you fill the room
With clouds of steam, you seal your

You undermine your circulation
And slowly die of enervation.
If, to keep fit and well and strong,
And if your toil you never shirk,
Then you will die of overwork;
While if, in fear of breaking down,
You take a fortnight out of town,
Who knows what consequences may
Result from such a holiday ?
To dry oneself with careful rub,
To dress, still dripping from the tub,
To aim at cheerful wit, to brood
In pensive, melancholy mood,
To bar tobacco, and to smoke
Whene'er the spirit moves a bloke,
To laugh, to weep, to yawn, to
sneeze,"
To wake, to slumber—each of these
Means life, while also each of these is
The cause of all our worst diseases.
In short, a man can scarce be said
To live in safety till he's dead.

The difficulty is to find
the man. As somebody
in the book says, “She

ton Brind, Mrs. D'Aber-
non of D'Abernon Mon-
achorum, or—yes, easily
enough, if she gave her
mind to it for a week—the
Honourable Mrs. Eustace
Bere ! ” Of the other
permutations and com-
binations in this pleasant
comedy-idyll of courtship
and marriage I have,
even after a second read-
ing, rather a hazy idea.
There are, I think, some
eight engagements in the
story, which, even though
two of them are broken
off, is a fair allowance
the book is worth read-'—
ing is greatly to understate my own personal estimate of
it; its minute and laborious analysis of one character
must give Hilda Lessways a high place in the list of
Mr. BENNETT's already amazing achievements.
Winnie Maron's quarrel was with the world. The world
says that if a man is neither unfaithful nor cruel to his
wife it is the duty of the wife to stay with him. Mrs.
Macon protested against this theory. Aſter a few years of
married liſe she could stand that deadly prig, Cyril
Maron, no longer; so she left him. The story of her
search for a real mate is told by Mr. ANTHoNY HoPE in
Mrs. Maron Protests (METHUEN). Given his central
character and his situations, Mr. HoPE can be trusted
to get the most out of them—to tell his story, that
is, in the best way. Where he fails in this book is in
his inability to make real for us his central character. It
for a community of half-a-dozen families. And all in six
months too. Still, the picture of the somewhat purpose-
less life which better-class people with fair incomes are apt
to live in the depths of the country is well drawn, and the
characters are distinct and lifelike. And, after all, Devon-
shire lanes were made for courting.

said merely.
It was a telegram—a telegram from Eva. Philip opened
it and read.
“Well, I'm blest ' " he said.
THE END.
(Printed by the One and Only Press, London and
Edinburgh.)
CHAPTER W.—LATE AFTERNoon,
It was a passionate and tear-stained Eva that sat down
|al her escritoire to write the fatal letter, the letter which
Even that did
“Come in,” he
should terminate for ever her betrothal to Philip Stanmore.
The tense silence of the room was unbroken save by
the scratching of her pen. Twice only she paused in her
writing. Did she waver in her purpose? No. Her diffi-
culty was purely technical. When one is breaking off an
engagement, can one address the other party as “Dear,”
if only “Sir” ” When one has broken off one's engage-
ment, can one then sign oneself “Yours,” if only “truly " ?
Then a naughty devil in her whispered a tempting and easy
way out. She picked up a telegraph form.
CHAPTER IV.-EARLY AFTERNoon.
The sister and the fiancée stood face to face. To each,
the face of the other appeared repulsive—repulsive in itself,
and repulsive because it belonged to its owner. Eva had
called Jane Stanmore “My dear,” and had meant the
worst that could be said. Jane had called Eva “Darling,”
and had meant the worst that could be thought. So now
they stood face to face, Eva alleging regrets that she must
go, Jane pressing her to stay yet awhile. In such words
as these the most violent passions and the most burning
animosities of the drawing-room are expressed.
No sooner was the door closed behind the departing Eva
than “Yellow !” shrieked Jane hysterically, raising her
hands to heaven in scorn. “Yellow ! and she knows my
complexion can't stand it. Deliberate spite I call it.
Yellow ! The cat!" Bursting into tears, she almost
wished she were dead. She quite wished Eva were dead.
Death, however, being out of the question, she determined
to make life unbearable to Philip, Philip her inoffensive,
you might have even supposed irrelevant, brother.
Meanwhile Eva was being driven, furious in heart, she
knew not where. “Blue!” she was crying to herself, “my
goodness, blue ! The commonest, most out of fashion colour
she can think off. Blue ! The cat'."
CHAPTER III.-LATE MoRNING.
As the two girls were rapidly passing from the utmost
affection to the merest politeness, Philip entered. The
situation was explained to him. He smiled confidently.
“Eva says yellow, Jane says blue,” said he. “Why
not split the difference and have green 2"
“Green 2'' asked Eva, with scorn.
“Green " " cried Jane, with derision. For a moment it
seemed as if the two were to be driven into alliance.
But no. -
“At any rate, it is better than blue, my dear,” said Eva.
“And yet,” said Jane, “I believe I'd sooner have even
green than yellow, darling.”
CHAPTER II.-EARLY MoRNING.
The two girls rushed into each other's arms between
every sentence. The history of the proposal finished,
they came to business. “I refuse to be married to Philip
unless you will be my chief bridesmaid,” said Eva.
“Oh, but I should love it!” answered Jane, and they
kissed with renewed fervour. “And what about the colour
of the bridesmaids' dresses? What do you think of blue,
for instance 2''
“Blue would be simply sweet,” said Eva, a little firmly.
“But do you know, I almost think I prefer yellow 2 "
“Yellow !” said Jane.
CHAPTER I.-OverNIGHT.
Philip kissed Eva for the last time but one before part-
ing for the evening. “And whatever happens, through
thick and thin and right till the very end, you will stick
to me, my darling 2" he whispered.
“Sweetest,” said Eva, looking into his eyes with her
own fearless and undoubting gaze, “nothing shall ever
part us.”

WHAT OUR ARTIST HAS TO PUT UP WITH.
Parson. “WERY NICE verty Exce; LENT, INDEED ! AND where Is It?”
THE £400 LOOK.
WE are to-day able to publish the
exclusive information that certain of
our Members of Parliament are not
quite satisfied, all things considered,
that they should receive payment for
their services. This noble little band
of amateur politicians has adopted the
plan, we understand, of quietly slipping
the first quarterly cheque in at the
back of the fire without a word to any
one. But we doubt if they will be quite
able to retain their former status. Our
representative interviewed the Editor
of The Sportsman last night, who con-
firmed our view that any amateur,
wittingly competing against a pro-
fessional, thereby became ipso facto
a professional.
Yet it can hardly be that these little
acts of unostentatious self-sacrifice
should be in vain. Already it is leak-
ing out. Despite all efforts at conceal-
ment, rumours of the New Altruism
are abroad. Among secretaries of
charitable institutions—who are quite
as wide-awake as you and I– the
present is considered a good moment
for appeals. Those who are asking
definitely for the sum of £400 (“to
clear off the remaining debt ") are now
admitted to have made the stupid
blunder of forgetting the Income Tax.
The popular figure (“urgently needed
to meet an unexpected emergency") is
£385. We do not know how far this
movement is meeting with success, but
we may say, as a mere straw to show
the direction of the wind, that we have
heard to-day of a projected cottage
hospital in one of the Northern coun-
ties whose site has suddenly been
removed without explanation from a
Liberal constituency into a Unionist one.
We have every reason to hope that
the New Altruism, as yet in its infancy,
will have a profound and far-reaching
effect upon our national life. If
Members of Parliament in any great
numbers take up the position that
they will not be paid for their services
because they like doing that sort of
thing, depend upon it they will not be
allowed to stand alone. Others will
follow. We believe that the moment
is a good one and that public spirit is
ripe. People are beginning to recog-
nise, for instance, that the whole of
the agitation which resulted in the sup-
pression of the WELLs-Johnson fight
would have fallen to the ground had the
two combatants come forward at the
beginning and frankly announced that
they had no desire to be paid for their
services, for boxing was its own reward.
We learn in the same connection
that there is no little searching of
heart among the paid officials of the
Amalgamated Society of Railway
Servants. We should not be at all
surprised at the announcement that
they also had decided to accept no
further remuneration for their labours
on the ground that they do it for the
sheer love of the thing.
Other significant information reaches
us from Scotland. There is a growing
restlessness, it seems, among the old-
age pensioners in the poorer parts of
Glasgow. They do not wish to be
regarded as professionals and they very
strongly object to have their age and
poverty flung in their faces. There is
some talk of forming a Society of
Passively Resisting Septuagenarians,
whose members will bind themselves
to abstain.

yards into the rough.”—Glasgow Herald.
“Never up, never in,” but this is over-
doing it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HOTEL CHILD.
I was in the lounge when I made
her acquaintance, enjoying a pipe after
tea, and perhaps—I don't know–
closing my eyes now and then.
“Would you like to see my shells?"
she asked suddenly.
I woke up and looked at her. She
was about seven years old, pretty, dark,
and very much at ease.
“I should love it,” I said.
She produced a large paper bag from
somewhere, and poured the contents
in front of me.
“I've got two hundred and fifty-
eight,” she announced.
“So I see,” I said. I wasn't going
to count them.
“I think they're very pretty. I'll
give you one if you like. Which one
will you choose?”
I sat up and examined them care-
fully. Seeing how short a time we
had known each other I didn't feel
that I could take one of the good ones.
After a little thought I chose quite a
plain one which had belonged to a
winkle some weeks ago.
“Thank you very much,” I said.
“I don't think you choose shells at
all well,” she said scornfully. “That's
one of the ugly ones.” -
“It will grow on me,” I explained.
“In a year or two I shall think it
beautiful.”
“I’ll let you have this one too,” she
said, picking out the best. “Now
shall we play at something?”
I had been playing at something all
day. A little thinking in front of the
fire was my present programme.
“Let's talk instead,” I suggested.
“What's your name?”
“Betty.” -
“I knew it was Betty.
just like Betty.”
“What's yours?”
Somehow I hadn't expected that.
After all, though, it was only fair.
“Orlando,” I said.
“What a funny name.
like it.”
“You should have said so before.
It's too late now. What have you
been doing all day ?”
“Playing on the sands.
you been doing 2"
“I’ve been playing in the sand too.
I suppose, Betty, you know nearly
everybody in the hotel?"
“Oh, I play with them all sometimes.”
“Yes; then tell me, Betty, do you ever
get asked what time you go to bed?"
“They all ask me that,” said Betty
promptly.
“I think I should like to ask you
too,” I said, “just to be in the move-
ment. When is it 2."
You look
I don't
What have
“Half-past six.” She looked at the
clock. “So we’ve got half-an-hour.
I'll get my ball.”
Before I had time to do anything
about it, the ball came bouncing in,
hit me on the side of the head, and
hurried off to hide itself under an old
lady dozing in the corner. Betty fol-
lowed more sedately.
“Where's my ball?” she asked.
“Has it come in 2 " I said in sur-
prise. “Then it must have gone out
again. It noticed you weren't here."
“I believe you've got it.”
“I swear I haven't, Betty. I think
the lady in the corner knows some-
thing about it.”
Betty rushed across to her and began
to crawl under her chair. I nervously
rehearsed a few sentences to myself.
“It is not my child, madam. I
found it here. Surely you can see that
there is no likeness between us? If
we keep quite still perhaps she will go
away.”
“I’ve got it,” cried Betty, and the
old lady woke up with a jerk.
“What are you doing, child 2 " she
said crossly.
“Your little girl, madam,” I began
—but Betty's ball hit me on the
head again before I could develop my
theme.
“Your little girl, Sir,” began the old
lady at the same moment. -
“I said it first,” I murmured.
“Betty,” I went on aloud, “what is
your name, my child?”
“You’ve just said it.”
“I mean,” I corrected myself quickly,
“where do you live 2" -
“Kensington.”
I looked triumphantly at the old
lady. Surely a father wouldn't need to
ask his own child where she lived 2
IIowever, the old lady was asleep again.
I turned to Betty.
“We shall have to play this game
more quietly,” I said. “In fact, we had
better make some new rules. Instead
of hitting me on the head each time,
you can roll the ball gently along the
floor to me, and I shall roll it gently
back to you. And the one who misses
it first goes to bed.”
I gave her an easy one to start with,
wishing to work up naturally to the
dénouement, and she gave me a very
difficult one back, not quite understand-
ing the object of the game.
“You’ve got to go to bed,” she cried,
clapping her hands. “You’ve got-
to go—to bed. You've got—to go—
to bed. You've—"
“All right,” I said coldly.
make a song about it.”
It was ten minutes past six. I
generally go to bed at eleven-thirty. It
would be the longest night I had had
“Don’t
for years. I sighed and prepared
to go.
“You needn't go till half-past,” said
Betty kindly.
“No, no,” I said firmly. “Rules are
rules.” I had just remembered that
there was nothing in the rules about
not getting up again.
“Then I'll come with you and see
your room.”
“No, you mustn't do that; you'd fall
out of the window. It's a very tricky
window. I'm always falling out of it
myself.”
“Then let's go on playing here, and
we won't go to bed if we miss.”
“Very well,” I agreed. Really there
was nothing else for it.
Robbed of its chief interest the game
proved, after ten minutes or so, to be
one of the duller ones. Whatever
people say, I don't think it compares
with cricket, for instance. It is cer-
tainly not so subtle as golf.
“I like playing this game,” said
Betty. “Don’t you?”
“I think I shall get to love it,” I
said, looking at the clock. "There were
still five minutes, and I rolled down a
very fast googly which beat her en-
tirely and went straight for the door.
Under the old rules she would have
gone to bed at once. Alas, that
“Look out,” I said as she went after
it, “there's somebody coming in.”
Somebody came in. She smile i
ruefully at us and then took Betty's
hand.
“I'm afraid my little girl has been
worrying you,” she said prettily.
“I knew you'd say that,” said Betty.

THE ABSENTEES.
A DUOLOGUE.
[While Lord AberdeeN and Mr. Birkell.
have been acting on the principle that “Ireland
is a grand country to live out of,” Mr. JIM
LARKiN, the protégé of the Castle officials, has
apparently not allowed the sacred rights of
illegality and disorder to suffer from undue
discouragement.]
B. FAR from the Castle and the stream,
Whose odours hem the Phoenix
Park in,
Say, ABERDEEN, what fitter theme
Could we discuss than JIMMY
LARKIN ?
A. Agreed, dear BIRRELL, for I find
That care has lost the power of
carkin'
Since I resolved to leave behind
As acting-Viceroy, JIMMY
LARKIN.
. Why should I sacrifice my ease
And slave at dull laborious
clerkin'
(I, too, can clip my final g’s),
When I can count on JIMMY
LARKIN ?
. Old HERod's was an iron rule—
He made a hobby of tetrarchin'—
But HERod was a perfect fool
Compared to Mr. JIMMY LARKIN.
. If Dublin's babies cry for bread,
Let Yorkshire send them lots of
parkin,
And Banbury its cakes, instead;
But do not bother JIMMY LARKIN.
A. I think as little of my foes
As of a plug that fails in sparkin';
Lapped in majestical repose
I leave it all to JIMMY LARKIN.
. Superb was NELsoN at the Nile,
Superb was the notorious
TARQUIN
(The rhyme, I own, is simply vile),
But more superb is JIMMY
LARKIN.
A. Me Scotland draws with ancient ties,
I claim, you know, with Lochin-
var kin.
B. Me Wales enchants with brassy
lies—
Both. Ireland we leave to JIMMY
LARKIN.
“A thin, slender figure of middle height, the
face which surmounted it, with its thin, greyish-
white beard and much-bitten moustache, so
trimmed as to make the upper part of his face

and the wrinkled chin around his eyes increased
the look of age.”—Morning Post.

LATEST WAR NEWS
(From all sources).
CoRFU. Tuesday. — The DUKE of
ABRUzzi has threatened to bombard
Preveza unless the two small motor
canoes at present in the harbour are
surrendered.
RoME. Wednesday.—It is officially
denied that any attempt will be made
by Italy to bombard Preveza. It is
known, however, that there are two
small motor canoes hiding in the
harbour, and the DUKE of ABRUzzi
has ordered a strong squadron of the
Italian fleet to intercept them should
they attempt to escape.
MALTA.—Heavy firing has been heard
at sea, and it is surmised that Tripoli
is being bombarded.
Later.—A heavy thunderstorm is also
reported, so it may be this.
PEKIN.—A wireless message from
Tunis states that the Italian fleet is
bombarding the Metripolitan Railway.
The Italian Embassy has issued an
official denial of the above, and states
that the Metripolitan Railway is still
running an efficient though restricted
service. This statement is borne out
by the Special Correspondent of The
Sporting Radical News, who had a
capital view of the bombardment
through opera-glasses from 85 miles
away, and can vouch for the fact that
not a single private Tripolitan was
injured.
The massing of Turkish ti oops
on the Albanian coast has begun.
Fourteen men, under the command
of an officer, have concentrated at
Elassona.
The above message was telegraphed
from Bergen vid Ristovac in conse-
quence of the censorship.
The Daily Mail special correspondent
at Lucerne says that the Secolo's Rome
correspondent telegraphs that the
Tribuna states that a special edition
of The New York Herald gives credence
to a rumour in the Matin that the
KAISER has despatched a lengthy tele-
gram to the SULTAN.
It is now thought, says the Paris
Journal, that the second pair of Turkish
motor punts supposed to have been sunk
by the Italian fleet is probably only
the first pair over again under assumed
names. In Milan this theory is re-
garded with suspicion.
WAR ITEMs.
“Trips to Tripoli" will be the subject
next Sunday at St. Mary-at-Hill,
Monument.
Two Italians appeared at Bow Street
yesterday charged with assaulting a
total stranger who was entering a
Turkish Bath.
The Rev. F. B. MEYER denies that he
is determined to stop the fight or that
he has offered to go over to Rome in
any sense whatever.
JAMES BRAID considers the Tripoli
Golf course one of the finest that he
has ever laid out.
In 1862 Mr. Gladstone said, “Turkey's
adversity is Europe's opportunity.”
It is not generally known that MARK
ANTONY once fought and lost a naval
battle at Actium in B. c. 31.
SHAKSPEARE alludes to “Tripolis "
three times in The Merchant of Venice
and once in The Taming of the Shrew.

new song at the Tooting Hippodrome
with the haunting refrain, “Take, take,

A lion, so to put it, fully fledged;
Or as a modest man who dashes
To stop a horse that runs amuck,
Arrests it, so that nothing smashes,
And gets applauded for his pluck,
The crowd, who watched and thought
to see him dead,
Collecting round to cheer and pat his
head;
So Glory came, when least expected
To shine upon my humble way;
So Fame her sudden beam directed
Upon my head the other day;
Though I had made no verses worth a
toss,
Nor rushed along the street to stop a
hoss.
I had done nothing, yet 'twas pleasant
To feel that I was really great,
To know that all and sundry present
Were envious of my lofty state,
To catch the sidelong glances thrown
at me,
And hear the youngsters whisper, “Look

How oddly Fate bestows her bounty
For this is how it came about :—

Their International half-back, McCRARE,
Nodded at me in passing (by mistake).

ARE GRANDPARENTS JEALOUS 2
INTERESTING SYMposium.
The statement recently made in
court by Lord Justice Starling, that
a sinister feature of modern life was
the bitter jealousy of their juniors
exhibited by grandparents, has elicited
a number of remarkable pronounce-
ments from leading luminaries of the
Church, the Stage and other prominent
callings, from which we cull the
following representative utterances:—
MADAME SARAH BERNHARDT.
My opinion, take it for all in all, as
your divine SHAkspeaRE has it, is
simply this, that a well-regulated (bien
rangée) grandmother, or even a great-
grandmother, should be incapable of
jealousy of any of her descendants.
But then she must possess genius, mag-
netism and the gift of eternal youth.
FATHER BERNARD WAUGHAN.
Nothing is more painful than the
artificial apotheosis of old age due to
modern aids to longevity. In Mayfair
it is the commonest thing to see
bejewelled and painted grandmothers
entering into unfair competition with
their granddaughters, dancing all
night and bridging all day, while the
young people sadly accept the rôle of
wallflower or find solace in slumming.
No, grandparents are not jealous; but
grandchildren are envious.
MR. LEMUEL TALLMARSH.
When I was an undergraduate at
Balliol the question of the relation of
the young and the very old once
cropped up at a dinner-party given by
Jowett to CARLYLE, the BrowNINGs,
FROUDE and my grandfather. My
grandfather, whose Greek iambics
excited the envy of GAISFord, hazarded
the view that the lack of respect and
affection which characterised the rising
generation would, if not checked, tend
to civil war. CARLYLE, who was in,
for him, a most playful mood, turned
to me and said, “Has the unending ass
tried to teach you to suck eggs yet?”
I was torn in two between loyalty to
my grandfather and a natural respect
for the renowned Sage of Chelsea, and
maintained an embarrassed silence.
The tension was, however, happily
relieved by a genial sally from FROUDE,
who observed that a civil war was
better than an uncivil peace, — a
felicitous paraphrase of Thucydides'
<novaos ivoroxº, which immensely tickled
Jowett. I remember, and I may be
pardoned for quoting from my Oxford
Memories (Fourth Series, vol. iii.,
pp. 243-4), my notes on the conversa-
|tion that ensued:—

Manageress. “THAT Is THE Dook of the NEXT Room, SIR.”
Customer. “THEN what's iT DoING IN HERE * ''
“BRow NING, who curiously enough was the
only person present who wore a black tie, noted
the strange fact that while we always spoke of
grandparents, grandfather and grandmother, it
was optional whether we used the phrase grand-
uncle or great-uncle. Frovide thought this
illustrated the flexibility of our vocabulary; but
my grandfather demurred and also expressed
the view that the word “grandchildren' was a
misnomer, observing that the French, with their
greater lucidity and logic, employ the form
‘petit-fils.’” -
The jealousy of grandparents, it will
be observed, did not directly engage
the conversationalists on this occasion,
and neither CARLYLE nor Jowett were
capable of discussing the point from
personal experience. But I remember
distinctly that CARLYLE smoked a clay
pipe after dinner, to the obvious dis-
satisfaction of my grandfather, who
held that the introduction of tobacco
by RALEIGH was the starting-point of
England's decadence. Jowett, so far
as I remember, never smoked, but in
later years I have seen him toying with
an unlighted cigarette in order to
countenance his guests.

That grandfathers are growing jealous

I answer them serenely, “Pooh 1”

as Nita brought in my tea I looked
once at a very cloudy sky, and in a
flash the difficulty was solved. Nita
asked how long I should be dressing.
I said, why did she ask? Breakfast
wasn't till nine. She said it would
take a quarter of an hour to walk
down. I expressed bewilderment, and
she was forced to open the attack.
But that was the limit of my success.
I said, “Not to-day, my dear. I have
no—” She said, “How lovely . I've
brought you one for a birthday present.”
If I had not swallowed some tea the
wrong way, I think I could still have
retrieved the position, but when I
stopped coughing she was gone, and
called out from the passage, “Put a
coat over it and come down.” I real-
ised, after a little, that she referred to
the costume, not to the tea on the
pillow, and when I had got the thing
on—it was made for an under-sized
man with loud tastes—I was glad to
take her advice. On the way down,
however, she insisted several times on
partial unveilings, and though her re-
peated assertions that it was lovely

a passing milkman its shortcomings,
when I removed my coat on the beach,
were so obvious that I sought the

was disastrous to my birthday present,

266 PUNCH, OR THE
LONDON CHARIVARI. [October 11, 1911.
CRAGWELL END.
PART II.
THE village itself runs, more or less,
On the sinuous line of a letter S,
Twining its little houses through
The twists of the street, as our hamlets do,
For no good reason, so far as I know,
Save that chance has arranged it so.
It's a quaint old ramshackle moss-grown place,
Keeping its staid accustomed pace;
Not moved at all by the rush and flurry,
The mad tempestuous windy hurry
Of the big world tossing in rage and riot,
While the village holds to its old-world quiet.
There's a family grocer, a family baker,
A family butcher and sausage-maker—
A butcher, proud of his craft and willing
To admit that his business in life is killing,
Who parades a heart as soft as his meat's
tough—
There's a little shop for the sale of sweet stuff;
There's a maker and mender of boots and shoes
Of the sort that the country people use,
Studded with iron and clamped with steel,
And stout as a ship from toe to heel,
Who announces himself above his entry
As “patronised by the leading gentry.”
i There's an inn, “The George";
There's a blacksmith's forge,
And in the neat little inn's trim garden
The old men, each with his own churchwarden,
Bent and grey, but gossipy fellows,
Sip their innocent pints of beer,
While the anvil-notes ring high and clear
To the rushing bass of the mighty bellows.
And thence they look on a cheerful scene
As the little ones play on the Village Green,
Skipping about
With laugh and shout
As if no Darville could ever squire them,
And nothing on earth could tame or tire them.
On the central point of the pleasant Green
The famous stone-walled well is seen
Which has never stinted its ice-cold waters
To generations of Cragwell's daughters.
No matter how long the rain might fail
There was always enough for can and pail—
Enough for them and enough to lend
To the dried-out rivals of Cragwell End.
An army might have been sent to raise
Enough for a thousand washing days
Crowded and crammed together in one day,
One vast soap-sudded and wash-tubbed Monday,
And, however fast they might wind the winch,
The water wouldn't have sunk an inch.
For the legend runs that Crag the Saint,
At the high noon-tide of a summer's day,
Thirsty, spent with his toil and faint,
To the site of the well once made his way,
And there he saw a delightful rill
And sat beside it and drank his fill,
Drank of the rill and found it good,
Sitting at ease on a block of wood,
And blessed the place, and thenceforth never
The waters have ceased but they run for ever.
They burnt St. Crag, so the stories say,
And his ashes cast on the winds away,
But the well survives, and the block of wood
Stands—nay, stood where it always stood,
And still was the village's pride and glory
On the day of which I shall tell my story.
Gnarled and knotty and weather-stained,
Battered and cracked, it still remained ;
And thither came,
Footsore and lame,
On an autumn evening a year ago
The wandering pedlar, Gipsy Joe.
Beside the block he stood and set
His table out on the well-stones wet.
“Who'll buy? Who'll buy?" was the call he cried
As the folk came flocking from every side;
For they knew their Gipsy Joe of old,
His free wild words and his laughter bold:
So high and low all gathered together
By the village well in the autumn weather,
Lured by the gipsy's bargain-chatter -
And the reckless lilt of his hare-brained patter.
And there the Revd. Salvyn Bent,
The parish church's ornament,
Stood, as it chanced, in discontent,
And eyed with a look that was almost sinister
The Revd. Joshua Fall, the minister.
And the Squire, it happened, was riding by,
With an angry look in his bloodshot eye,
Growling, as was his wont, and grunting
At the wasted toil of a bad day's hunting;
And he stopped his horse on its homeward way
To hear what the gipsy had to say.
FICTION AND FASHTON.
WE observe with interest that in a note to a short
story in the current issue of a popular sixpenny magazine
the editor writes: “Lady readers of the following may be
glad to learn that the illustrations have been executed by
a dress expert, and represent the latest models for the forth-
coming autumn.” This seems to us to open up new
prospects for our neglected novelists. May we not look
to find something like the following in the literary Press
before long?
DRESS AT THE LIBRARIES.
Ultra-smartness, combined with a suspicion of diablerie,
will be found to be the note of the gowns worn by the
heroine of Mrs. GLYN's new novel, A Ducal Divorce.
The publishers are proud to call attention to the fact that
Chapters VI. and VII., dealing respectively, with the
Foreign Office reception and the ball at Chiffon Castle,
have been supervised by the talented author in conjunction
with a well-known Paris modiste, thus ensuring that every
costume depicted shall be a masterpiece of creative art. The
reputations alike of author and costumière are a sufficient
guarantee that a romance of special interest should result.
Mr. J. M. BARRIE writes: “When I described the heroine
of one of my novels as wearing a dress of some soft
clinging material' I meant the new washable foulardette
at three eleven three-farthings, and no other.” Invaluable
for all emotional work.
To gentlemen-authors commencing : If you feel inclined
to dress your characters in “crash and bombazine,
trimmed with revers of eau-de-nil passementerie,” avoid
solecisms so fatal to real popularity by consulting the
Literary Dress Agency. Every MS. has personal attention.
Send your female characters to us, and we undertake to
turn them out worthy of the best publisher in London.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Jim Davis (WELLs AND DARTON) is a book that would
have delighted STEvenson. You remember how, in one of
the letters, he describes the way a story ought to begin—
about the strange craft that must ha' dropped into the bay
a little afore dawn, or words to that effect 2 Well, this is
very much the kind of thing you get in Mr. John MASE-
FIELD's latest, a tale of Devon and the sea, of night-riders
and preventive men. A capital tale too, and well told.
Young Jim Davis himself (apart from his one great adven-
ture) does nothing especially heroic, being for most of the
time in a condition of very natural and human funk. But
there is an excellent person, a smuggler called Marah, who
makes full amends for this. And from the moment when
the lad Jim stumbles upon the secret of the cave, and is
forced by the fearful smugglers to become one of their
band, adventures and fights and escapes follow each other
in quite the right breathless fashion. With it all there is
a distinction and an atmosphere, such as you would now
naturally look for in Mr. MASEFIELD's work, which raise
the whole far above the countless tales in which the same
incidents have been employed. There was one passage in
particular, of a boat being pushed at night out of a cave,
which I had to read five or six times for sheer joy of its
beauty, before I could get on with the page. Once or twice,
however, I was puzzled. For example, it was a little shock
to me, archaeologically, to find persons at the beginning of
the last century described as sitting down to lunch in the
middle of the day. Of course this may be all right; but
it sounded strangely modern.
There is a great deal to be said for Mr. PETT RIDGE, and
I intend to say some of it now in respect of his Thanks to
Sanderson (METHUEN). It is not to be accepted as an
axiom that if a railway servant, having risen by his own
effort and merit to an inspectorship, educates his children
to a higher standard of culture than his own, the children
will inevitably become ashamed of him and cut themselves
off from the family or the family from them. But it is
more than probable that when such a lamentable develop-
ment occurs it must be on the lines sketched in the hard
case of the Sandersons, the bad tendency getting the better
of the children only by slow degrees and the ingrates
themselves showing in the process that they are not alto-
gether without redeeming points. For Mr. PETT RIDGE is
a most competent optimist—optimist, because he can find
a good side to everybody; competent, because he sees a
bright side which exists and does not invent one which, if
he had the ordering of the universe, might be incorporated
in human nature. And, if he does not deal in the subtleties
of souls and the clash of intellects, he gives you a truer and
more delightful account of the elemental humours of the
lower middle class than any man I know. The opportune
appearance of the book is an additional point in its favour.
The careful study of the personality of a railway employee
is at the moment valuable, and happy, moreover, since it
confirms the favourable opinion derived from one's own
experience. Certainly it suggests a doubt whether his

Miss STEVENs's book, but by way of warning to people of

The story, however, which
gains my unqualified admir-
ation, is called “The Silly

piece of imaginative work.
For a volume of short stories,
a rare feature in this book is
the fact that its contents are
now on view for the first time;

see a book whose title suggests the Middle Ages I grow
instantly censorious, and adopt what is probably an alto-
gether unfairly critical attitude. In this spirit I began
to read For Henri and Navarre (HUTchinson), by Miss
DoRo THEA CoNYERs, and for just a few pages at the opening
I expected to be able to take full marks for intuition. But,
thank heaven, the greatest of us make mistakes at times.
It is one of the finest stories of the kind I have met for
years, and I don't blame Miss CoNYERs a bit for telling the
publisher it is the best thing she has ever written. There
is nothing in trying to describe what it is about. The
ingredients of this sort of tale—love, intrigue and desperate
straits—are all much the same. Everything depends cn
how you mix them, and how much life you can get inside
the fancy dresses. I really think Miss CoNYERs has done
both about as well as they can be done.
The eight tales contained in The Earthen Drum
(MILLS AND Boon) deal principally with love in the eternal
all ends well. The minor characters, for the most part
mildly unpleasant, are well and definitely drawn; but Diana
Todd, the husband-huntress, and Lionel, the bad young man
who marries the housemaid, are perhaps not quite con-
vincingly realised. And, to be frank, there were few traces
of the “humorous pen" which the publishers promised me
in a kindly summary upon the cover.
An Unfair Division.
“Mr. J. Buchanan on Saturday, on the football ground, beat Mr. J.
R. Mackridge in a run of 100 yards. Buchanan had five yards start
and Mackridge had muscular trouble.”
Mr. BuchâNAN presumably won the toss and chose the five
yards start.

Perhaps they were merely better at subtraction in “another

Shall pour you her nectar that winks and that swirls;
She 's brown and she 's smiling, she's plump, she's

Perhaps not the goddess, but one of her girls!

THE GREAT WAGER.
[“M. Maurice Maeterlinck, the Belgian writer,
has wagered £80 that he will succeed in landing
at New York and reaching Boston, Massachusetts,
without being interviewed by American re-
porters.”—Daily Press.]
M. MAETERLINCK is a man of ideas,
as those who have read his books and
seen his plays need not be told, but
even he is not above taking counsel,
and in order to help him carry out
this great enterprise — for £80 is a
sum worth winning—he has permitted
inquiries to be made of a number of
persons likely to be of assistance.
Some of the replies are subjoined.
Sir ARTHUR CoNAN Doyle: Any
assistance that I can give is at the
service of my confrère. Literary artists
should stick together. One of the best
disguises is that of the one-legged man.
This is painful, as it means bending
the calf of the other leg backwards
against the part above the knee and
pushing the result into a truncated
trouser; but it can be done. No one
would expect M. MAETERLINck to have
but one leg. The twisted lip is useful
too, but one must remember that
American interviewers have sharp eyes.
Sir GILBERT PARKER: I can offer
no advice as to how to enter America
without being interviewed, because
I have never tried it and never
intend to.
Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT : I have given
much thought to this subject and I
think I have hit on a good working
plan. Let M. MAETERLINCK go just
as he is. But let him, when he lands,
take with him a body-companion dis-
guised as a desperate character, carrying
a square brown-paper parcel under his
arm. This parcel must contain a
well-painted copy of the “Monna Lisa,”
and the paper must be just enough
torn to permit a sight of her face
through it. In the ensuing riot M.
MAETERLINck will have no difficulty in
escaping.
Mr. W. CLARKsox : Leave it to WILLY.
Meanwhile extraordinary prepar-
ations are being made by the New
York press to cause the dramatist to
lose his money. One manoeuvre that
is recommended is to interview every
one on the ship, down to the meanest
scullion, and to open every conversation
—even to ladies—with the words,
“Good morning, M, MAETERLINCR, I
hope you have had a good passage.”
This plan, however, cannot be carried
out owing to the time it would occupy
and the dislocation—beyond that now
permitted—of the business of landing
and emerging alive from the Custom
House.
An amendment suggests that an
enormous megaphone should be placed
on the statue of Liberty, and should
address every steamer entering the
harbour from England with the words,
“Good morning, M. MAETERLINCK, I
see you are there. I hope you have
had a good passage. Anything that
you do not tell me about the impression
America is making on you will be taken
down in writing and used as evidence
against you.” This device, it is held,
will be so comprehensive as to embrace
M. MAETERLINCK sooner or later, and
it has been held by a first-class United
States lawyer that even if he did not
hear the words the address and threats
would be tantamount to an interview.
On the other hand there is considerable
objection to the proposal on the ground
not so much that it is perhaps not
altogether sporting as that it leaves
too little opportunity for papers to
exercise that rivalry which is the breath
of their life.
Meanwhile a strong feeling exists
among the New York interviewers that
the author of The Blue Bird is not
quite playing the game. He says
nothing of when he intends to cross.
It is held that dates should be given in
order that the great contest may be fair
to both sides.

ingham, a young Bud.”

CRAGWELL END.
PART III.
THEN the pedlar called to the crowd to hear,
And his voice rang loud and his voice rang clear;
And he lifted his head and began to troll
The whimsical words of his rigmarole:–
“Since last I talked to you here I've hurled
My lone way over the wide, wide world.
South and North and West and East
I've fought with man and I've fought with beas: :
And I've opened the gates and cleared the bar
That blocks the road to the morning star !
“I’ve seen King Pharaoh sitting down
On his golden throne in his jewelled crown,
With wizards fanning like anything
To cool the face of the mighty King :
But the King said, “Wizards are off,' said he
‘Let Joseph the gipsy talk to me.’
“So I sat by the King and began to spout
As the day drew in and the sun went out ;
And I sat by the King and spun my tale
Till the light returned and the night grew pale ;
And none of the Wizards blinked or stirred
While the King sat drinking it word by word.
“Then he gave me rubies and diamonds clºl ;
He gave me masses of minted gold.
He gave me all that a King can give :
The right to live and to cease to live
Whenever—and that 'll be soon, I know–
The days are numbered of Gipsy Joe.
“Then I went and I wandered on and on
Till I came to the kingdom of Prester John ;
And there I stood on a crystal stool
And sang the song of ‘The First Wise Fool':
Oh, I sang it low and I sang it high
Till John he whimpered and piped his cye.
“Then I drew a tooth from the lively jaw
Of the Prester's ebony Aunt-in-law ;
And he bubbled and laughed so long, d'you see,
That his wife looked glum and I had to flee.
So I fled to the place where the IRajahs grow,
A place where they wanted Gipsy Joe.
“The Rajahs summoned the turbaned hordes
And gave me sheaves of their inlaid swords;
And the Shah of Persia nert I saw,
Who's brother and friend to the Big Bashaw ;
And he sent me a rope of turquoise stones
The size of a giant's knuckle-bones.
“But a little brown Pygmie took my hand
And rattled me fast to a silver strand,
Where the little brown Pygmie boys and girls
Are cradled and rocked to sleep in pearls.
And the Pygmies flattered me soft and low,
‘You are tall; be King of us, Gipsy Joe.'
“I governed them well for half-a-year,
But it came to an end, and now I'm here.
Oh, I've opened the gates and cleared the bar,
And I've come, I've come to my friends from fºr.
I'm old and broken, I'm lame and tired,
But I've come to the friends my soul desired.
So it's watches and lockets, and who will buy 2
It's ribbon and lace, and they're not priced high.
If you're out for a ring or a golden chain
You can't look over my tray in vain :
And here is a balsam made of drops
From a tree that 's grown by the AEthiops t
“I've a chip of the tooth of a mastodont
That's sure to give you the girl you want.
I've a packet of spells to make men sigh
For the lustrous glance of your liquid eye—
But it's much too dark for such wondrous wares,
So back, stand back, while I light my flares 1"
Then he lit a match, but his ſingers fumbled,
And, striking his foot on a stone, he stumbled;
And the match, released by the sudden shock,
Fell in flame on the old wood-block,
And burnt there very quietly
But before you could have countcd three,
Hardly giving you time to shout,
A red-blue column of fire shot out,
Up and up and ever higher,
A marvellous burst of raging fire,
Lighting the crowd that shrank from its flashes,
And so decreasing,
And suddenly ceasing
As the seat of St. Crag was burnt to ashes!
But in the smoke that drifted on the Green
Queer freaks of vision weirdly wrought were seen:
For on that shifting background each one saw
His own reflection and recoiled in awe;
Saw himself there, a bright light shining through him,
Not as he thought himself, but as men knew him.
Before this sudden and revealing sense
Iºach rag of sham, each tatter of pretence
Withered and vanished, as dissolved in air,
And left the shuddering human creature bare.
But when they turned and looked upon a fricnd
They saw a sight that all but made amend:
For they beheld him as a radiant spirit
Indued with virtue and surpassing melit,
Not vain or dull or mean or keen for pelf,
But splendid—as he mostly saw himself.
Darville and Fall were drawn to one another,
And both to Bent as to their heart's own brother;
And a strange feeling grew in every breast,
A self-defeating altruistic zest.
But when they sought the Gipsy, him they found,
His dark eyes staring, dead upon the ground.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAR
THE CORNER IN STAMPS.
Now that some months have elapsed
and the national resentment at the
new issue of stamps shows no sign of
abating, those of us who had sufficient
foresight to hoard our old stocks are
apparently to meet with our reward.
It is common knowledge that the
buying of “King Edwards,” as they
are conveniently called, has been going
quietly on for several weeks, and now
that the large towns have been
practically depleted much business is
being done in the smaller and more
remote country post-offices. Already
a small premium has had to be offered
in some few cases, but by far the
greater proportion of these parcels,
varying from two or three to several
dozen, have been acquired at their
face value. It is indeed the story of
the old furniture over again. The
country districts are being ruthlessly
pillaged before they have discovered
the true importance of their goods.
Before the year is out it is probable
that nine-tenths of the remaining stock
will be held by the various members of
thering, who are looking confidently for
a smart advance in prices in the spring.
It is not considered likely by the
prime movers in this speculation that
“King Edwards” will continue to be
used by business firms in the course of
their ordinary correspondence. These
have already been forced to bow to the
inevitable and accept the new stamp,
though many of them insist upon
having the improved variety sold at a
premium of two per cent. by the
National Re-gumming Co., Ltd., which
is doing a fine body of business. The
demand from philatelists is also quite
negligible. But they are firmly con-
vinced that they may count upon
sufficient support among the cultured
classes, for private correspondence,
to secure a steady and progressive
market. In artistic circles there are
many who feel so strongly upon the
point that they are quite willing to
deliver their letters entirely by hand
rather than disfigure the envelope with
the current penny stamp.
Fashion also has her say in the
matter. It is already laid down in
the most exclusive circles that “King
Georges” may not be used for a dinner
invitation, and no guest's bedroom in
any smart country house is regarded as
properly furnished without its little
box of “ King Edwards,” while a large
cheque to a fashionable charity calls
inevitably for a receipt stamp of the
old issue. The campaign cannot, it is
true, be carried on for long on this lavish
scale. But even when the scarcity is

ances are certain to bear the stamp
of the last reign. Nor will it matter,
according to the experts, what the
denomination of the stamp may be.
When the pennies and halfpennies are
exhausted users will be forced to go
slowly up the scale till the really
smart wedding of ten years hence will
probably be heralded by envelopes
bearing the shilling “King Edward.”
Should the venture be floated (as it
may be) as a limited liability company
we should like to offer one word of
warning to intending shareholders.
Over the whole undertaking, so rosy
in its aspect at first sight, hangs a
dark cloud of uncertainty—the danger
of a new issue.
“There are 44 musicians, of whom 27 are
stringed instruments.”—Erening News.

Of you I deemed unkind,
And clamoured for Protection

Not having understood
Your aim was really kindly—
To foster hardihood.
When next you chill the bard, he
Will look no longer glum,
But whisper, “Kiss me, hardy
I'm anxious to become."

she said. “She'd think it so silly.”

THE MIEETING OF TWIN SOULS.
John is twenty-seven years of age
and describes himself, in his income-
tax returns, as following the trade,
vocation, employment or profession of
a musical critic. The profits do not,
he tells me, look imposing on paper,
but his compensation is his reputation
among the dear philistines. Mrs.
Wodehouse, for instance, asked him to
dinner on the strength of it alone,
adding, in a personal postscript, that
“my young friend Gladys Pethick, an
amateur pianist of great talent, with
whom I am sure you will have much in
common,” was coming also. Thinking
more of the dinner than of the guest,
he accepted, and in due course met, held
converse with, and became engaged to
this Gladys. It is at their joint re-
quest that I publish this true account
of the discovery of their affinity.
“Gladys," said Mrs. Wodehouse,
introducing them, “this is Mr. John
Bantock. There, now you know each
other, and I am sure you will have
a lot to say to each other about your
beloved music.”
A little later, Mr. Wodehouse had a
communication to make to John, which
required to be stated apart, in a whisper.
“Bantock, will you take Miss Pethick
in to dinner 2 She 's very keen on
music and all that sort of thing, and
my missus thought you ought to meet
and exchange views.”
“What do you think of Puccini 2"

“It is very good salmon,” said John,
more happily, “and I don't know of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE HONEYMOON."
“Man's love is of man's life a thing apart;
'Tis woman's whole existence."
This is what the fascinating widow,
Flora Lloyd, discovered one hour after
her marriage to Cedric Haslam—and
a hundred years after BYRON.
She might have found it out earlier
seeing that the late Mr. Lloyd had
been a successful stockbroker “in the
Kaffir Circus,” where love does not
commonly intrude, but perhaps her
marriage to him was never meant for
anything but a business arrangement.
Anyhow, when Cedric, the leading
English airman, proposed to cut the
honeymoon short in order to forestall
a German in the first flight over
Snowdon, Flora was deeply hurt. No
good for Cedric to say that it was for
the honour of England; he didn't
really love her, if he put his aeroplane
• ‘irst, -
ºn in America one could hardly
ask for a separation at tea-time on the
day of one's marriage, and yet the
difference between husband and wife
was not a mere lover's quarrel to be
patched up with kisses and tears. A
deus er machiná was wanted here, and
Mr. BENNETT cleverly produced him in
the shape of a Bishop, who had just
made the discovery that the curate
who married them was a bogus one.
Whereupon Flora (twice a widow now)
thinks that, after all, she won't get
married again. But meanwhile Cedric
hears privately that the German
airman has broken his leg. There
being now no need to cut short
the honeymoon, he hastens to con-
fess that he was wrong and that
love is much more important than
aeroplanes. “Has anythin ; happened
to make you change your mind 2" asks
Flora, who has also heard privately
about the leg. “Nothing,” swears
Cedric. “Liar,” says Flora in effect,
“and I love you for it.” For though
the position of aeroplanes in Cedric's
scheme of life may still be doubtful, it
is at least plain that honeymoons take
precedence of honour. Which is one
up for honeymoons.
Mr. BENNETT's play is extraordin-
arily ingenious ; but the dialogue is so
fresh and the characters for the most
part so natural that his artifices do
not intrude themselves unduly. He
has, too, a disarming way with him.
Just as you are going to point out that
the bogus curate is more like a novel
than real life, one of his characters
makes that very observation; and at a
family council upon the broken engage-
ment Flora herself comments on the
staginess of it with the remark, “As
I said to Cedric-in-the First Act.” But
| there is no one to prevent me from
lodging an objection against the Bishop.
I have only once been within three
yards, of a Bishop, but I am sure they
don't really pat women's hands, and
call them “my dear lady.” I object
also to the Swiss waiter's comments
on English life; Mr. SHAw does both
comments and waiters so much better.
The opening of the First Act, brilli-
antly played by Miss MARIE TEMPEST
and Mr. GRAHAM BRowNE, is the
most delightful thing I have ever
seen on the stage. Miss TEMPEST

continued to be delightful all through,

MJDUS OPERANDI.
“DEAR,” said Olive, “will you just
run out and post this letter for me?”
And this at half-past nine in the
evening, when I supposed I had settled
in comfortably for good!
Our flat is up four flights of stairs
and the pillar-box is just round the
corner to the right, but to reach it
it is necessary first to go down the
four flights of stairs. Life is very hard.
“I will go down-stairs,” I said,
forcing myself to be cheerful, “I will
go round the corner to the right, and I
will slip the letter into the slit provided
for the purpose.” I illustrated this by
a gesture. “But first I will put on my
hat.”
“Goodness gracious,” said Olive,
there being no such thing as gratitude,
“whatever do you want to put on a
hat for 2 " -
“And also,” I said, forgiving her,
“I will put on an overcoat.” -
Olive, to be sure of making her
coming sarcasm heard, followed me
out into the hall. As she was there, I
thought she might as well be used, so
[ compelled her to put the letter down
on the hat-stand and to help me on with
the coat. “Will you not also take a
packet of sandwiches,” she asked, “in
case ?” With that she hurried back
into the drawing-room to avoid a
possible back answer, and slammed
the door. -
“To show that I am undefeated,”
I said to myself, “I also will slam a
door,” and I was glad to hear that a
front door can express even more
indignation than a drawing-room door.
“And now,” I added jocosely, “I will
take steps.” -
At the bottom of the first flight, “I
will run down the next to keep my
legs warm,” I said; at the bottom of
the second flight, “I will put my
hands in my pockets to keep them
warm "; at the bottom of the third,
“I will turn up my collar to keep m
neck warm "; at the bottom of the
fourth, “I will now cease running so
as to avoid the suspicion of the police-
man at the corner.”
At the corner the policeman said
“Good night, Sir,” and I still felt warm
all over. “This is splendid,” I said:
“I will now go direct to the pillar-box."
Arrived there, I contemplated the
important slit and a last bright idea
occurred to me. “And now,” I
said, “I will go back and fetch the
letter.” - -
“Serious fire on the Manchester
Ship Canal,” said the posters last
week. What Lancashire does to-day,
the Thames may do to-morrow.

THE FINISH.
MoRNING had broken upon a chill
white fog, eloquent of the fact that
already November was within mea-
surable distance. As the day advanced,
however, this vanished before a mild
but persevering sunshine, which to-
wards three in the afternoon contrived
to make the exuberance of indoor fires
somewhat oppressive. About then the
Hostess began to do mysterious things
in the garden with a thermometer.
She brought back the result triumph-
antly. “I really don't know why we
shouldn't,” she said, “just for the last
time.” The girl who was staying there,
appealed to, also saw no reason why
they shouldn't. The master of the
house was naturally ignored. Thus it
happened that basket-chairs and a tea-
table were carried out, and that the
Constant Guest, dropping in about four
o'clock for his weekly refreshment,
found them all seated, a little with the
demeanour of adventurers, under the
familiar tree at the far corner of the
tennis-lawn.
The lawn itself was not yellow-
brown, as it had been lately, but of
a vivid green, unkempt and pitted with
tiny earthworks of black soil. Faintly
through this could be traced the chalk
lincs of the courts. Decaying leaves
were everywhere, and the whole thing
was undeniably damp. But the guest
ignored this.
“Tout comme autrefois 1" he ex-
claimed reminiscently.
“Isn't it?” said the Hostess. “Don’t
you feel that you present what the
sea-side column of The Telegraph calls
an animated and summer-like appear-
ance? We do.”
“Glorious !” murmured the Guest,
accepting his cup from the Girl (who
had been staying there so long that
she didn't even need to ask him how
many lumps); “I never thought to sit
under this jolly old tree again for
months. What a year; and what times
we have had, we four, in this garden' "
“Yes,” said the Girl. The Master,
who had that very morning been
dunned for payment of a lost bet,
looked up sharply.
“Well,” the Hostess observed, “this
must be the end of it, anyhow. A
little final P.P.C. call, and then definitely
good-bye.”
“‘What are we waiting for, you and
I?’” murmured the Guest dreamily.
“Personally, for a match. Thanks!”
The Host put down his cup and rose.
“This St. Luke's summer business may
be romantic but it is also rheumatic.

THE latest news about the war is to
the effect that the Turks and the Arabs
in the vicinity of Tripoli are looking
forward with keen pleasure to the
arrival of the eight monoplanes and
two biplanes which the Italians are
bringing over, aviation displays being
comparatively rare in that part of the
world.
“What,” enquires “Observator” in
The Observer, “is the principle on which
a war acquires its name 2 Why is the
Tripolitan conflict called the Turco-
Italian war rather than the Italo-
Turkish war 2" A Turkish gentleman
informs us that the war is so called
because the Turks are ultimately going
to come out on top.
A Tripolitan Arab, hearing some
Italians in a Paris café congratulat-
ing one another on the capture of
Tripoli, seized one of them by the
legs and hurled him through a plate-
It is thought that
the Tripolitan Arab must have lost
his temper. - -
The Dreadnought belonging to the
Portuguese Royalists which figured in
our newspaper columns has not yet
been discovered. No doubt she is
lurking somewhere in shallow waters
disguised as an outrigger.

The Marquis DE SoverAL, inter-
viewed by a representative of The Daily
Chronicle, informed him that KING
MANUEL was greatly interested in the
Royalist rising in Portugal. Those who
were fighting there for His Majesty will,
we are sure, be glad to hear this.
The Admiralty has accepted an offer
from the Liverpool Navy League to
present an aeroplane to the Navy.
The War Office would like it to be
known that it also is open to consider
charitable gifts. Horses in small or
large quantities would be especially
acceptable, it being desired to form as
large a force as possible of Mounted
Cavalry.

A burglar who broke into a house at
Hamburg was, The Erpress tells us, so
busy trying on a flowered waistcoat in
front of a looking-glass that he did not
notice the entrance of the owner ac-
companied by a policeman. We trust
that this moral story, showing the
danger of vanity, may be copied into
Messrs. WILLIAMS AND NorgaTE are
about to issue a book of the IKING's
Speeches. We understand that it will
be published on the royalty system,
but its price will not be a sovereign.
“A new type of Music Hall song,”
we read, “will be heard this winter.
It is “the surprise song.’” Dare we
hope that the surprise will consist in
its being a song with some sense
in it 2
In an article entitled “Why Peers
Marry Actresses,” which appears in
the current number of The London
Magazine, the writer asks, “Against
their well-turned weapons, what chance
has a mere peer, all unlearned in the
arts of war 2 " This is, of course,
peculiarly true when the Peer is an
officer in the Guards.
We are always glad to see attempts
to brighten up our English watering-
places. Among the attractions of a
cinematograph theatre at Folkestone,
we saw announced the other day, were
“Animated Pictures” of the funeral of
local celebrity.
The children at an Erith school were
taken, the other day, to a travelling
menagerie and circus in order to give
them a practical lesson in natural
history. Later on, we understand,
they are to be taken to see a classical
dancer in order to learn anatomy.
Fire broke out in a small wild beast
show in the Nottingham Goose Fair
last week, but the roaring of the lions
gave the alarm in time to prevent
serious damage. We consider that, as
a mark of appreciation, the intelligent
beasties should now have pretty ribbons
tied round their necks and be given
their freedom.
At a show held at Dereham, Norfolk,
horses and ponies aged 29, 28, and 26,
secured awards. The old fellows, we
understand, met afterwards and had an
interesting chat about the days when
there were no motor-cars.
The police dog Mylord has been sent
away in disgrace from the Louvre owing
to his irrepressible terror of an Egyptian
sphinx. He has been succeeded by a
dog named Max. The incident has
caused a good deal of quiet satisfaction
in Berlin.

A feature of the annual display of
fashions in the Longchamps enclosure
on the occasion of the Autumn Grand
Prix was a number of complete costumes
of fur. Rough-coated dogs are claiming
that the idea originated with them.
Smart women, we are told, are now
expected to carry coloured umbrellas
which harmonise with their costumes.
This reminds us of the lady who walked
into a Circulating Library the other
day, and, when asked what book she
required, said, “Oh, one to match my
dress, please.”
Gowns with bodices designed like the
knights' armour of mediaeval days are
one of the latest fashions in Paris. We
are not surprised at this, for suits of
armour always had one point in com-
mon with modern dress. They had no
pockets, and the problem as to where
the knights of old placed their hand-
kerchiefs has never been satisfactorily
solved.
A new crown worth £65,000 is to be
made for the KING to be used during
the Delhi Durbar. One hears much
about the extravagance of women now-
a-days, but we doubt whether a member
of that sex has ever given so much for
her head-gear.

Up to the year 1842, we are told,
there was no organ in the church at
Elmton, Derbyshire, and the parish
clerk used to whistle the tunes facing
the congregation. Here, perhaps, we
have a hint as to how church services
might be brightened up to-day.

Mr. Punch begs to acknowledge the
receipt of 1,259 letters pointing out
that Corsica is not part of the Italian
Kingdom, as alleged in last week's
number. Mr. Punch, however, has a
reputation as a prophet to keep up:
as a student of human nature he
knows how the passion for annexa-

FAIR Mystery, and here at last thou art.
Much have I sighed for thee in this high den
Wherein at intervals I sit apart
Driving a hard but fairly rhythmic pen.
O thou that with thy soft and whispering tone
Bringst me the commune of my fellow-men
When I am bored and weary of my own,
I give thee cheer, glad cheer, my Telephone.
Yes, I have sighed for thee. In that dull mood
That breaks upon the stubborn quest of rhyme,
Oft I have yearned for someone to intrude
Upon my loneliness—not waste my time,
But cheer me with sweet converse, and begone,
Leaving me my Parnassian heights to climb;
Not like the well-beloved but tactless John,
Who ruins all because he will stay on.
But now henceforth that genial soul may be
Mine in a moment (and cut off at will);
I summon George; a voice responds; 'tis he

Their holiest privacy, but not so, I;
Only the green, methinks, need thus complain.
Me, it shall be a privilege most rare
To learn thy “call,” and one that few shall gain;
Others may search the book, for all I care;
They will not find it; it will not be there.
And there is she. Henceforth for ever near,
Maiden, all coyly on this wavering line
I will breathe nothings in your shell-like ear,
You will, no doubt, breathe nothings into mine.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE world at large and Italy in particular are indebted
to Mr. GEORGE TREveLYAN for his record of the career of
GARIBALDI. Already he has written of what is perhaps the
least-known episode—GARIBALDI's defence of the Roman
Republic. He has told the fascinating story of the descent
upon Sicily, and now completes the trilogy in a volume,
published by LoNGMANs, entitled Garibaldi and the Making
of Italy: It is possible exigeant readers may complain that
for immediate effect the book is, more especially in the
battle scenes, overladen with detail. It is certainly water-
logged with footnotes reciting authorities that might well be
taken for granted. Except to the man of leisure on a desert
island, footnotes are tiresomely superfluous. Admitting
ecstasy of the chase, is a fine study, but the conversational
gifts of Mrs. FitzSymons and the buccaneering tricks of
the Widow Delanly are our chief delight in this exhilarating
entertainment. By the gash of war—to quote from the
book itself—it beats bees in the making of wax |
Fearful that in these days it may not be taken altogether
as a compliment, I hazard the opinion that Madame
ALBANESI's work is instinct with womanliness. One does
not expect from her anything strikingly original in the
form of plot, but she can be trusted to provide a clean
entertainment, and this is to be found in Poppies in the
Corn (HUTCHINsoN). The author's forte is rather to pro-
duce atmosphere than to draw character, and the description
of the farm where the heroine lived with an old servant is
given with a fragrance and pathos delightful to remember.
the exception, here comes
in one of the little ironies
of life, for the man of leisure
so circumstanced has not
access to one of Mr. CAR-
NEGIE’s Libraries where he
might verify the references.
Ignoring the footnotes and
discreetly skipping some of
the topographical details of
the battles, one has a moving
story of the making of Italy
and of the men who accom-
plished the task. We see
Victor EMMANUEL, genuinely
touched by GARIBALDI's
marvellous achievement,
ready to hold him in fra-
ternal embrace, after a cer-
tain point abruptly drawn
off by the subtle statesman
whose policy it was that
the monarchy should profit
by GARIBALDI's chivalry, and
that when he had made
possible the unification of
Italy under the Savoy
vº
&
-or-tº-e J
On the other hand, Madame
ALBANESI's bad people are
too saturated with sinfulness,
and her good people unnatu-
rally near to saintliness.
Both the perfidious Leila
Arundale and the perfect
Katherine Fenemore would
have been more human if
the one had possessed a
saving virtue and the other
even a minor fault. Fiction
teaches me that hereditary
quarrels end in lovers' meet-
ings, a benign arrangement
which I devoutly hope is as
usual as novelists would have
us believe. Anyhow, Madame
ALBANESI has persuaded me
that such a result is possible,
and for this and also for an
excellently-written book I
tender her my thanks.
It was all the fault of The
Little Green Gate (Con-
TABLE), through which Peter
dynasty, he should be more
or less rudely thrust aside.
Through the tangled drama
shines the steadfast presence
of GARIBALD, simple in manner, dauntless in courage, were young and they loved;
consumed by the one desire to free Italy. “What a noble
human being !” TENNyson exclaimed, after making his
acquaintance during his visit to England.
SHERIDAN, it was said, was deterred from writing more
plays because he was afraid of the author of The School for
Scandal. So it might be said that his gifted compatriots,
Miss SoMERVILLE and “MARTIN Ross,” have of late years
been afraid of the authors of Some Experiences of an
Irish R.M. : Well, after reading Dan Russel the Fox
(METHUEN) we can assure them that they need labour
under this apprehension no longer. Their new novel is as
good as anything they have done: indeed in sheer virtuosity
of expression it eclipses their previous efforts. In wealth of
humour it ranks with the R.M.; in penetrating insight it is
on a par with The Real Charlotte. They have, in short, not
only equalled their best, but they have achieved the well-nigh
impossible feat of writing a sporting novel which will give
thrills to a tailor. And the characters, such is the pro-
digality of their invention, are all new. Katharine Rowan,

came from the beechwoods
into the garden and the life
of the woman of the brown
earth and the flowers. They,
| and for four sweet June days
and through the midsummer madness of the thunder-
storm sent to them by fate on their last evening together,
before the fiercer storm of life burst upon them, they shut
out the world; and the garden and the woods were for
them twain the Garden of Eden. But outside its sanctuary
there were other people. Most of all there was the girl
to whom Peter had given his word before he blundered
through the little green gate into the other woman's heart.
So they were up against the old problem of the conflict
between love and duty, which, I have an idea, can only be
solved rightly by those who, like Peter and the lady of the
garden, are wise and strong enough to see that they are one
and the same thing. Let me advise you to lift the latch
of The Little Green Gate and learn for yourself the rest
of the story, which STELLA CALLAGHAN tells with so much
understanding of the beauty and sadness and humour of life.

It was an autumn evening,
Old Die-hard's work was done,
He had, in fact, attained the age
Of seven-score years and one;
And with him chatted at his knee
His great-great-grandchild, Willoughby.
Upon the floor the latter's twin,
Young Effie, sat and played
With something sharp and smooth and
fine
And lettered on the blade;
And asked if it was used in war,
And what the B.M.G. was for.
“That is the trowel,” he replied,
“With which I was to pat
The Die-hard Club's foundation-brick,
Only the scheme fell flat;
'Tis a memento dear to me
Of the great age of loyalty.”
“But tell us what the letters mean,”
She asked with eager shout.
“BALFour Must Go,” said he, “but why
I could not well make out;
But this at least for sure I know
That anyhow he didn't go.”
“And who was BALFour, tell us that?”
“Our noble chief,” he said.
“And was there anyone who wished
To be the chief instead 2 ''
“No. Things like that aren't done,”
said he,
“By men of simple loyalty.”
“Dear great-great-grandpa,” said the
boy,
“Didn't you think it strange,
If they were all such loyal men,
That they should want a change?”
“You are too small to grasp,” said he,
“The rules of party loyalty.
“They loved him, oh so well, but
thought
He sadly wanted grit;
They felt that if they kicked him hard
He might improve a bit.”
Said Effie : “Well, it seems to me
A funny sort of loyalty.”
“I am an old man,” Die-hard said,
“But I was younger then,
And possibly was flattered by
These loyal gentlemen.”
Said Effie : “Still it seems to mo
A funny sort of loyalty.”
“Kind words the Duke of MARLBorough
spoke,
And our good SELBCRNE too.”
“But wasn't it,” said Willoughby,
A rotten thing to do 2"
“I grant that it was not,” said he,
“The usual kind of loyalty.
But none the less the Chief sat tight
And never turned a hair.”
“And did he thank you,” asked the boy,
For all your loving care?”
“One doesn't want reward,” said he,
For acts of simple loyalty.” O. S.
HOME RULE FOR SGH00LBOYS.
“North Close,” Oct. 22, 1911.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I think it would
be a ripping idea if you would let me
contribute my views on the Home Rule
question to your paper. There's so
much rot written about schoolboys
only thinking of games and grub, that
I want to show people we've got views
about the Empire a jolly sight more
sensible than most of the putrid rot
the rotters stick in the papers. There's
a fellow in The Observer—of course we
take in all the best papers—who's
allowed three long columns every week
and sometimes four, to say just what
he likes in. That's what I should like,
but as it would take up about five
pages in Punch, I suppose you would
consider it a bit too hefty for a start.
I'm writing this during English hour
with the Head. Of course I wouldn't
dream of doing it under Old Beefy's
nose—that's Mr. Calthrop, our house-
master. He 's got an eye like a gimlet
and can spot you through a brick wall,
though now he's married he 's not
quite the man he was. I always think
marriage is a mistake for any ush. It
makes him soft.
This Home Rule matter is a bigger
thing than most people think—you can
take that from me. It's not going to
stop with Ireland. When I. was a
house prefect — I got reduced, you
know, over that row with the Head—
I could see quite clearly what a ripping
idea it is to let men govern the men
whose tricks they understand. Do
you think there was any ragging or
slacking in my preps. ? You bet not—
I'd done most of the tricks myself, so
I knew Let REDMOND take prep. in
an Irish Parliament, and he 'll know
how to keep them in order and make
the beggars behave like good little boys.
I said Home Rule's not going to
stop with Ireland. Home Rule's what
we want. Of course we've got a little
of it already in the prefect system, but
not enough by a hundred miles. You
read an awful lot of rot in the papers
about the defects of a public school
education, but there 's some truth in
it, and it's all due to the rotten idea
that middle-aged fossils know what's
best for boys. Let the middle-aged
footlers make rules for the other
middle-aged footlers, say I, and let
boys-I mean of course the sensible
fellows with a real knowledge of the
world—make rules for boys.
Don't you imagine that we'd cut
out work altogether, or any rot like
that. Work is jolly good discipline
for kids, who want their little noses
held down to the bally grindstone.
But the older fellows – men of the
world, you know–ought to be allowed
to choose how much time they'll give
to work and what subjects they'll go
in for. Take my case. My pater
wants me to go into Parliament some
day, and as he's got the cash we can
take that as settled. Now what use
is Latin and Greek to me when I get
into Parliament? Nowadays they only
jeer at you if you try and quote Latin
and Greek in the House, like BURRE
and MACAULAY and ADDIsoN and those
sort of fellows used to do.
If I had my choice I'd swot at
something a jolly sight more useful.
I'd have an ush specially to teach us
repartee and polite slanging—I mean
like knowing how to call a man a bally
liar without his being able to object.
Of course we know something about
repartee already, considering we spend
most of our spare time trying to score
off one another; but when a grown-up
hears it he calls it “rude" or
“vulgar." Men's repartee is just the
same thing, but it's put in polite
language, and I admit ours isn't. For
instance, when that sarcastic little
Scug Ironsides said to me the other
day, “I hear Mrs. Beefy is trying to
improve your dear little minds at North
Close with Sunday readings from
DANTE,” which is quite true, I replied,
“You ought to. Your ears are big
enough. When you flap them in
chapel you send a draught down our
necks like the Piccadilly Tube.”
Now I wonder how you'd construe
that in parliamentary English 2
I hope you'll be able to print this
letter, because, for another reason, I
could do with a little cash. I've
promised to dine my uncle at the Troc.
on term-holiday, and I want to do the
thing in style. Yours truly,
P. H. Rogers.

Now, we ask—is that the act of a real

raised the drawbridge directly they
were in sight or challenged them and
told them that they couldn't come any
further, we should have said nothing.
But this is treachery.

PorteNToUs PREPARATIONS.
A FEw further particulars of the
dinner to Mr. GEORGE EdwardEs
which is being arranged for next month
in honour of his completion of twenty-
five years' management of the Gaiety
Theatre have reached us. We can now
definitely assert that the chair will not
be taken by Mr. JAY Gould, as was at
one time feared. Who was to be chair-
man was naturally a question of the
gravest importance, and Lord LANs-
DowNE, as the head of the majority of
the House of Lords (for which Mr.
EdwardEs has done so much) was
naturally first invited. Circumstances
preventing Lord LANSDow NE, the in-
vitation was passed on to Lord Rose-
BERY, who is, it was felt, the one peer
with enough eloquence to do justice
to the great merits of the genial
entrepreneur. Lord RoseBERY also
failing, Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE
has consented to officiate and say pretty
things about the sacred lamp and all
the rest of it.
The other tables will be presided
over by Lord Esher, Herr LEHAR,
Herr OSCAR STRAUss, Mr. IIIon EL
MoNCRTON, Mr. J. L. TANNER, Mr.
ADRIAN Ross, and Mr. EDMUND PAYNE,
who has undertaken to keep his “in
a roar.” Among the old allies of Mr.
EDWARDEs who have already promised
to attend we may mention the Duchess
of Southease, formerly Miss Ruby Twist;
the Countess of Strewth, formerly Miss
Lucie Rogue; the Marchioness of
|Findon, formerly Miss Gladys Hopp;
and Lady Bridgeparty, formerly Miss
Zena Wunce. It is also hoped to
obtain acceptances from such old
Gaiety favourites—familiar among the
Chorus to all who rented pews in the
'nineties, even if their voices were
never heard except more or less in
unison—as Miss Lardy de Mar, now
the Hon. Mrs. Burtty; Miss Carrie
Quince, now Lady Stowett; Miss
Alumette Bryant, now Mrs. John W.
Rosenheimer, of New York; and Miss
Rosie Cheeke, now Mrs. Cyrus K.
Poodler, of Chicago.
To every guest a souvenir will be
given in the shape of a miniature silver
statuette of Miss GERTIE MILLAR.
Lord LONSDALE, it is believed, will
read a message in Portuguese from
KING MANoFL, and the Marquis DE
Sover AL will recite a comic sonnet,
of his own composition, in which
Mr. EdwardEs is compared to PRINCE
HENRY the Navigator.
Various addresses, we understand,
will be presented to the hero of the
evening. Amongst these special in-
-
Rose Society, in which stress is laid on
the fact that Mr. GEORGE EdwarDEs
is the greatest peeress-maker since
CHARLEs II.
The Amalgamated Society of Minor
Poets have prepared an Ode of Gratitude
to Mr. EdwardEs, composed by sixteen
writers, and emphasizing the services
he has rendered to their cause by the
practice of encouraging literary co-
partnership.
Another gratifying tribute will be the
address presented by a deputation from
Brighton, headed by the MAyor and
Corporation, expressing their indebted-
ness to Mr. EdwardEs for encouraging
his companies to recruit their energies
at that favourite resort, and thus
assisting to revive the splendours of
the Regency epoch.

Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--There's quite a
little rage this autumn for needlework
and womanliness, and it's not incorrect
to mention home now and then. Some-
one that you know has re-discovered
the needle as a feminine weapon with
immense possibilities, and toutes celles-
ld have followed suit. It's usual now
at calling time to be ſound with a bit of
stitchery in your hands, the plainer the
better, the harmless, necessary hem-
ming is as piquant as anything. In a
téte-à-téte (and here the real value of the
revival comes in) with anyone you're
particularly interested in, my dear, a bit
of needlework, pro-º-º:
a secret that his country was going to
war. Of course I told everybody, so
no one was surprised when it happened.
Stella Clackmannan, next to your
own Blanche, has made the greatest
success with the cult of the needle.
I must own the dear thing looks simply
too sweet for words with her sewing-
frock on, her hair parted, and her neck
gently bent, as she looks demurely
down at her great, fearful stitches.
Ray Rymington, who's been devoted
to her for ages, has committed some
verses that begin like this:—
Lady of Mine, Lady of Mine,
Meekly stitching, with wondrous art
(“with wondrous art” is quite lovely,
considering how she works!),
means to set to work looking out old
diaries and letters, and getting her
Memoirs under way. The people who
don't care say Do ' And the people
who do care say Don't Upon which
the Dowager tells these latter: “Well,
you must make it worth my while to
don't.” After a lot of haggling they
come to terms, and she goes on for
another year or so, when it's da capo
with the whole performance. And so
it comes to pass that the Dowager
Necdmore lives by not writing her
Memoirs

by not writing? That is how the

will deliver himself a captive into your that she forgets things but that she
hands ! It's usual to frame the little remembers 'em. When she finds her-
bit of work one was doing when some
particularly momentous confidence was
given. For instance, I've framed the
bit of hemming I was engaged on when
Giovanni Allegretto, of the Italian
Staff, a nice boy whose mind I’ve
self very stony, she gives out that the
publishers have made her a big offer
for her Memoirs, if she'll call every-
body by their right names, “extenuating
nothing and setting down everything in
malice,” as Hamlet says. She says
– “I was only wonder-
ſing whether we oughtn't to wait till
there was a sufficient party, or anything
like that.”
He considered me, in the reflective
way that guides have, when they
happen to be rather less than six years
old. “You do say funny things, don't
you?” he observed; “I laugh ever so,
sometimes.”
Then we proceeded. The mansion,
over which I was to be conducted,
occupied a commanding situation on
one corner of the nursery table—what
auctioneers would call a well-built
family residence, brick faced, standing
in its own grounds of bright green,
which must have extended fully two
inches beyond the walls on every side.

as we came in sight of it. “That's—

property (I had, indeed, in my capa-
city of honorary uncle, arranged the
present lease, through the agency of
the Army and Navy Stores, only last
birthday), I flatter myself that the sur-
prise and enthusiasm were fairly credit-
able. Peter, at least, seemed satisfied.
“There !” he said. “Now we go
inside.” As a matter of fact it was
less our going in than the house
coming out, by means of a detachable
front arrangement that permitted us a
generous and comprehensive view of
the interior. The guide—or Peter, as
you like—was watching me closely for
appreciation.
“They won't mind us?” I whispered,
indicating the Family, who were ob-
viously in residence at the moment;
the noble owner in the dining-room
(stretched, I regret to add, under the
dining-room table); his lady in the
salon above stairs; the infant heir
enjoying a bath, to which he appeared
permanently attached, in the bedroom;
and a very large domestic (who pre-
sumably slept out) dominating the
kitchen. They seemed an unsociable
lot. “What I mean is,” I added, “it
must be such a nuisance having

tourists going all over one's place when
one 's there oneself.”
“They won't mind,” said Peter;
which, to do them justice, they didn't
appear to; their high-bred indifference
to our proceedings could hardly have
been surpassed in the most aristocratic
circles. Peter restored the master of
the establishment (who was dressed in
a sailor suit and looked young for his
responsibilities) to an upright position.
“He’s got 'digestion,” he explained
charitably, “like you.”
“I can well believe it,” I said with
an involuntary shudder. I was looking
at the kitchen, on the table of which
stood a made-dish of repellent aspect
and at least twice the size of the
unhappy sufferer. Something else in
the kitchen also struck me. I sniffed
once or twice; in a more complex
establishment one would have said that
the drains wanted looking to. Peter
explained. “It used to be such a dear
little crab when it ran about on the
sands,” he said reminiscently, “and I
brought it home all the way in the train
in my pocket, and now it isn't well.”
Peter has (I think) the softest and
most wonderful eyes in the world.
Mrs. B. “WELL, The RE's No AccoustiN' For TASTEs.”
They were regarding me now so wist-
fully that I hastened to replace my
handkerchief with what was almost an
air of guilt. Not for so small a matter
must the popularity of an uncle be
jeopardised; and somebody in authority
was bound to find out about it before
long anyhow. -
“But it is a nice house, isn't it?”
demanded Peter, suddenly forgetting
(to my relief) the deceased crustacean
and clasping one of my hands in the
estatic manner peculiar to him at
emotional moments.
“It's perfect,” I said, and meant it.
“One doesn't know which is the nicest,
the kitchen, or the dining-room, or the
drawing-room, or the bedroom. Which
do you like best ?”
Peter considered. “I know which
they like best,” he said decisively,
indicating sailor-suit and his spouse.
“Which 2" I asked.
“The nursery,” he answered with
entire confidence. He was already
arranging the couple, still to all outward
appearance apathetic, about the tin
bath. “They must do,” he explained,
“'cos their little boy lives thcre.”
I apologised. -

[October 25, 1911.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DIARY OF A CINEMA
ACTOR.
Sunday. I had hoped to stick to the
“legitimate” all my life, but now that
that has failed me there seems to be
only one thing left for me to do, for
I have always been told that I have
not enough personality for the halls.
To-morrow I start my engagement
with the Grand Auto-Bio-Cinemato-
graph Company. It is not quite what
I looked forward to when I first went
on the boards, but one must earn an
honest penny somehow. To-morrow
we do “When Father Paid the Rent.”
Action, of course, is what is wanted in
a Cinema play, and there should be
plenty of action in this.
Monday. A terrible day. I must
really go into training.
I called at Mr. Brown's house for
the rent at ten o'clock in the morn-
ing. Mr. Brown, who has a keen sense
of humour, had tied a string across the
bottom of the door, and I came in
quickly (the essence of the Cinema
drama is quick movement) without
noticing it—until, that is to say, it
forced itself on my attention. Then I
picked myself up and turned back to
the door in surprise, Jane seizing that
moment to come in with the breakfast
things. (Very late the Browns break-
fast.) Again I failed to notice her
until it was too late, and my simulation
of anger at receiving the contents of the
coffee-jug down my neck was excellent
—even without the words, which in a
Cinema play are, of course, unnecessary.
Hearing the noise Mrs. Brown came in
from the kitchen, where she was making
the pastry (extraordinary hours the
Browns keep) and poured a basin of
flour over me—I can only suppose
under the mistaken idea that flour re-
moves coffee-stains.
My one thought now was to escape,
for I saw by this time that the Browns
had no serious intention of paying the
rent. The only available exit was the
chimney, one of those large old-
fashioned ones often seen in country
houses. I accordingly made for it,
discovered at once that it had not been
swept for years, and had got quite half
way up before Brown came down from
the top and met me. We finished on
the hearth-rug together, myself on the
underneath berth. As I rose to my
feet some instinct seemed to warn me
that Brown had chosen this day for
having the painters in. My instinct
did not play me false; I met them at
the window. But it was certainly a
surprise to me that he was having his
house done with blue paint. The taste
for blue paint is an acquired one; even
half the large helping I had off the
brush would have convinced me of
this.
I am very tired to-night and can only
hope to-morrow will not be so strenuous.
To-morrow we do “An Interrupted
Proposal.” It sounds pretty and senti-
mental, but—well, we shall see.
Tuesday. I shall go to bed early
to-night—as soon as ever I have
written up my diary.
Being told by the maid that Miss
Hilda Brown was at home, I followed
her into the drawing-room, taking my
silk hat with me in case I might be
wanted to sit down on it. In a little
while Hilda and I were seated side by
side on the sofa, holding each other's
hands and gazing into each other's eyes.
I could have gone on like this for a long
time, but, as the manager says, what
is wanted is action. Brown came in
furiously and stood over us, angrily wav-
ing his arms. I implied with a slight
gesticulation that my intentions were
serious, that I had an income of £500
a year, and that Hilda and I loved one
another. Brown answered in dumb
show that he was going out to loose
the bull-dog. At this Hilda fainted on
my top-hat, and I hurried out after
Brown with the idea of trying to
make the bull-dog think that we had
both loosed him, and that the right
gentleman was still in the drawing-
room. In less than a minute the
chase in the garden had begun. In
my youth I had been a noted runner,
and as the bull-dog was now in his
prime the spectators were assured of a
good race. At the end of the third
lap I was still leading, and by just
enough to allow me to jump at an
overhanging branch and swing myself
out of danger. For a moment I feared
a protest from the manager that the
new situation—myself sitting on the
branch, the bull-dog sitting below—
lacked action, but I soon saw that I
had no reason for alarm on this point.
There was an ominous snapping noise
above me, a still more ominous snap-
ping noise below me, and then we were
all on the ground together. In the
dramatic scene which ensued my
representation of The Dying Lion-tamer
was, the manager tells me, remarkable.
Fortunately at the moment when I
seemed to him to be overdoing the
part the camera stopped clicking.
To-morrow we do a moving drama,
entitled, “Love Laughs at Locksmiths.”
I am getting a little nervous now about
anything connected with love ; still
more about anything connected with
laughs. But I hope for the best.
Wednesday. The drama was differ-
ent from what I expected. My own
part in it was small; I had to under-
study the heroine in the scene where
she falls into the lake and the hero
rescues her. For some reason the
heroine didn't think she could make
this “go" properly. Dressed in a coat
and skirt similar to the one she had
been wearing throughout the play, and
with my face hidden by a thick veil,
I fell into the part at once; but
the hero's idea of towing me out
again was immature to a degree.
He is the worst rescuer I have ever
met. As we came up for the third
time, I said, “Unless you do some-
thing quickly, I shall have to tow you
out. It isn't even as if the water were
filtered.” Thus spurred on, he man-
aged to pull me to shore safely.
The manager says he will write and
let me know when he wants me again,
but, anyhow, it won't be to-morrow.
So I have one day off.
Thursday. Spent the morning in
bed, and in the afternoon wandered
into a picture palace and saw some
cinema photographs of growing flowers.
Delightful. I spoke to the manager of
this palace afterwards and asked if he
could give me a job. I fancy myself
particularly as a growing lily, though I
daresay I should get a good “house"
as a crocus unfolding or a laburnum
tree bursting into bud. The truth is I
am really too old for my other work, and
since Fate has turned me into a cinema
actor I ought to be looking about for
something quiet; this flower business
would just suit me. The manager,
however, was rather curt about it.
Returned home a little disappointed
and went to bed.
Friday. Got up to find a letter from
my own manager asking me to come
round at once and play an important
part in the new sensational melodrama
“Gored by Wild Bisons.” It’s very
nice of him, but I can't quite bring
myself to take advantage of his kind-
ness. Of course I might be the
Wild Bison and do the goring, but I
think it is more likely that I should be
the gentleman who has the goring done ||
to him. Telegraphed my refusal, there- |
fore, and returned to bed.
Saturday. Permanently in bed.

“ARE THERE DRAGONs, MoTHER }”
“OII, No, DEAR.”
“WHY NOT #"
THE INDOMITABLES.
A melancholy exercise in the manner of
the admirable and persevering “Truth.”
I TAKE this opportunity of warning
my readers against Mr. Lazarus Moss,
of 493, Jermyn Street Chambers, who
is ostensibly a reasonable lender of
money to young gentlemen in monetary
difficulties, but is really a blood-sucking
spider into whose toils it is dangerous
to be drawn. Mr. Moss is, I need hardly
say, the most philanthropic of men, and
is prepared to advance sums up to any
amount on note of hand only. Having
my suspicions aroused, I have been to
the congenial trouble of inquiring into
Lazarus's past, and I find that he is
none other than our old friend, Samuel
Harris, who was, if you remember,
unmasked in the issue of this paper for
March 8, 1878, and was there shown to
be a recrudescence of the notorious
Haman Levi, whose ingenious practices
for fleecing young aristocrats were de-
tailed in our issue of September 4, 1872.
This man's real name is Henry Biggs,
who, for some years before he took
to money-lending, was the champion
begging-letter writer of the Midlands.-
February 9, 1884.
The blood-sucking scoundrel, Lazarus
Moss, of whom I had something to say
in the issue of February 9, 1884, is still
at his old game, and the gilt-edged
youth who wish to raise the needful
quickly at several hundred per cent.
have no occasion to go further afield
than 40A, Curzon Street Mansions,
where he sits in a handsome office
dictating letters on note-paper an-
nouncing that he has no connection
with any firm of the same name. Let
no one, however, be deceived, for this
Lazarus Moss is the identical Lazarus
Moss (whose real name is Biggs), against
whom I have already frequently warned
my readers.-June 10, 1887.
A correspondent writes to me com-
plaining of the money-lending circulars
which he has received from many
firms, the chief offenders being Messrs.
Chetwynd and Co., 189, Piccadilly Court.
He asks me what he should do. There
are only three things to do. One is to
ask for an injunction against Chetwynd
and Co. to restrain them from pestering
you ; which would be a very expensive
luxury. Another is to return the letter
in an envelope without a stamp; and
the third is to tear it up and forget it.
A few inquiries which I have caused to
be made have established the fact that
Chetwynd and Co. are no other than
the irrepressible Lazarus Moss, alias
Haman Levi, alias Samuel Harris
(who was once Biggs, the begging-
letter writer of Edgbaston), against
whom I have already done my best to
warn readers.-October 23, 1891.
Once again it is my duty to call
attention to the case of those usurious
Shylocks, Chetwynd and Co. (alias
Lazarus Moss, alias Haman Levi, alias
Samuel Harris), whom I last pilloried
in the number for October 23, 1891.
In spite of all I said then and formerly,
they continued their malpractices and
are now as flourishing as ever; but a
recent transaction, of which I have all
the facts, should be their last. Suffice
it to say that they have been dealing
upon incredible terms with a minor
who has, for them, the unfortunate
merit of being nearly related to a Judge.
What the sequel will be time alone
can show; but I feel fairly confident
that Chetwynd and Co., under what-
ever name they may assume, will have
to choose either another line of business
or another country to pursue it in.-
December 8, 1895.

I drew attention to a singularly
audacious financial transaction on the
part of a firm of money-lenders calling
themselves Chetwynd and Co., whom
I had proved to be no other than
Lazarus Moss, Samuel Harris, and
Haman Levi, all previously attacked in
this paper, and all pseudonyms of the
infamous Biggs. Nemesis, I thought
then, had a rod in pickle; but I seem
to have been mistaken, for I have dis-
covered that Mr. Vandyck Sturmer, of
241, Duke Street, St. James's, who is
so freely papering London and the
provinces with his offers for instant
accommodation on the easiest terms,
comprises in himself all these old
friends of ours. Well, I can do no
more than issue my warning, and once
again I caution my readers against
having any dealings with this audacious
swindler, who would extract blood from
a stone with more ease and success
than any apparatus ever invented by
Mr. EDISON.—January 14, 1901.
A correspondent in Rugby has sent
me an account of his son's dealings
with a London money-lender that are
so extraordinary in character as to
cause even me—accustomed as I am
to revelations of this kind—to blush for
my fellow-creatures. It appears that
the young man, as young men will,
became involved and had recourse to
a financier whose circulars he had often
received, a certain Marcus Swithin, of
301, Sackville Street Chambers, who
turns out to be none other than the
usurer whom from time to time I have
exposed in this paper under various
aliases, the last of which was Vandyck
Sturmer. The rate of interest de-
manded was no less than 400 per cent.,
of which a large portion has been paid.
I have strongly advised the boy's father
to see that no more is paid, and to call
in the aid of the law to insist upon the
refunding of what has already passed
into Swithin's hands.-April 20, 1908.

varied character,
LORD HARTINGTON.
(REMINIscENCE ExtRACTED FROM THE
DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
MR. BERNARD Holi,AND properly
gives to his monumental work pub-
lished by LoNGMANs the title “Life of
the Duke of Devonshire.” It was,
however, as Lord HARTINGTON that
one of the chief pillars of the State
during the latter half of QUEEN
Victoria's reign was known to the
people, a title that comes more readily
to tongue and pen. Mr. Holland
brought to the accomplishment of his
task a personal knowledge of its
subject, with whom he was during two
important years associated as Private
Secretary. He has made profound
study of the historic times in which
Lord HARTINGTON played a leading part.
The result appears in the most valuable
addition to English biographical litera-
ture made since the appearance of
Lord MoRLEY’s “Life of Gladstone,”
of which it is in large measure the
complement. On page 407 of the first
volume there is a slip of pen or printer's
stick so obvious as to be immaterial.
But to old Parliament men it is de-
lightfully incongruous. It credits “Mr.
CALDwell,” with the system of Army
Reform established between the 'sixties
and the 'eighties of last century. Of
course, for CALDwell, we read CARD-
well, and pass on.
Towards the close of his life, when
he had come into the dukedom, Lord
HARTINGTON, taking the undergraduates
at Cambridge University into his con-
fidence, made a striking remark.
through life,” he said, “I have had to
work with men who thought three
times as quick as I do, and I have
found this a great disadvantage.” It
may be true, but his slow process of
thought invariably led him to the right
conclusion. Through a long series of
crises, of common importance but of
Lord HARTINGTON
without exception came to what proved
to be a sound conclusion.
Some of the colleagues with whom
he worked were men of brilliant parts,
eloquent in ordered speech, sparkling
in conversation, equally capable of
moving the masses and charming the
social circle. Lacking possession of
these gifts, Lord HARTINGTON was a
man of supremely sound judgment, one
to whom his audience closely listened,
whose advice they pondered over. As a
public speaker he did not create immedi-
ate effect. He had not a pleasant voice
and scorned approach to elocutionary
art. He belonged to the class whose
speeches are more effective when read
than when spoken. Reading the many
extracts Mr. Holland gleans from
“All.
speeches delivered in the House of
Commons (most of which I heard) one
is struck by their lucidity and force.
These qualities shine throughout the
correspondence largely quoted.
The great - perplexity of Lord
HARTINGTON's public career was Mr.
GLADSTONE. “I can never understand
him in conversation” he forlornly wrote
to Lord GRANVILLE on the eve of final
separation. Admiring his Titanic genius,
distrustful of his own capacity, he was
instinctively inclined to followhisleader,
and was constantly pulled up by finding
himself among the breakers. The con-
sequence was that he fell into the habit
of what is known in domestic service
LORD HARTINGTON.
“Patiently trudged along.”
as “giving notice.” The letters written
to his chief, in which he either threatens
resignation or tenders it, are models of
well-reasoned perspicacity.
Lord HARTINGTON was a Minister of
the Crown malgré lui. Constitutionally
indolent, he hankered after the leisure
and the pleasures of a country gentle-
man's life, with Newmarket thrown in.
But the supremely dominant force with
him was a sense of duty. As he was
more than once reminded when the
strain of Ministerial life seemed too
heavy to bear, the CAVENDISHEs have al-
ways taken a leading part in affairs of
State, and it did not become their latest
descendant, heir to their name and
estate, to walk apart. Lord HARTINGTON
accordingly bent his sturdy shoulders un-
der the yoke and patiently trudged along,
hauling his burden with a groaning of
the spirit hidden from the looker-on
but revealed in some pathetic passages
of his correspondence and conversation.
His greatest sacrifice was made when
he reluctantly undertook the thank-
less post of Leader of a distraught
Opposition left in a hopeless minority.
A condition of their servitude, more
strictly enforced in those old-fashioned
days than is now the case, was that
the Leader on either side of the Table
was expected to be in constant attend-
ance from the time the SPEAKER took
the Chair till the welcome cry, “Who
goes home?” rang through the Lobby.
That was a discipline hateful to Lord
HARTINGTON's nature. Like CHARLEs
LAMB at the India Office, he was
sorely tempted to make up for arriving
late by going away early. He never
over-mastered the passion for un-
punctuality. It was characteristic of
him that, when still a young Member
lately appointed to the War Office and
having in hand the task of introducing
a departmental Bill, he arrived so late
that, the Order of the Day being called
on, one of his colleagues was hurriedly
put up to talk against time till the
dallying Minister strolled in.
Habitually arriving late, he never
attempted to hide his delinquency by
furtive entry from behind the SPEAKER's
Chair. With right hand in his pocket,
swinging his hat in his left, he walked the
full length of the floor, to be seen of all
men. Once arrived and condemned to
a long, frequently a tedious, sitting, he
remained at his post with head thrown
back, hat tilted over his nose, both
hands in his pockets, a monument of
silent uncomplaining martyrdom. Thus
he sat on the historic night when Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN, rising from the Radical
camp below the Gangway, hailed him,
amid raucous cheering, as “Late the
Leader of the Liberal Party.” Had the
taunt been addressed to a stone image
it would not have led to less perceptible
change of countenance.
A tower of strength to any Adminis-
tration in which he served, Lord
HARTINGTON's value as an asset was
—if paradox be permitted—lessened
by his implacable honesty. Not a
party man, he was unselfishly loyal
to his Party. But there was a limit
beyond which neither personal friend-
ship nor political advantage could drag
his foot. It was marked by conviction
that the proposed step was lacking
in honourable purpose or that it was
hostile to the truest interest of the
country. No British statesman of
modern or ancient times had a purer
record than Lord HARTINGTON. His
life was twice blessed. In action he
did the State high service. At rest he
leaves behind a memory inspiring to
his successors.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SUSPiCIOUS CASE.
I HAD read every article in The
Outsider (and my own contribution
twice) and yet I felt that I could not
leave it and go to bed. I had not
enough energy to stop reading; I was
too lazy to give up the habit of going
on. So I went very methodically
through all the advertisements and in
particular learnt all the best that could
be said for Blank & Co.'s Bond Street
Cigarettes. Then I put the paper down
and leant back in my chair. Then I
leant forward again and resumed my
reading. You have often felt exactly
like that, haven't you?
Eventually I found myself going
stolidly through the same old advertise-
ment. “All right,” said I, in an irritable
and offended voice, “I’ll smoke the
darned things, if I’ve got to,” and I
noted the address.
I have lied frequently and without
scruple in the columns of the press, but
I assure you that what follows is the
solemn truth.
“Would you not like one to smoke
now, Sir 2 " said the man behind
Blank and Co.'s counter, as he tied the
parcel up.
“Look here,” I answered, “ you've
made me buy this box of cigarettes;
I do think you might let me smoke
them when I like.”
“One out of our box, Sir,” and he
proffered the tin and lit a match, and
was very careful that the fumes of the
sulphur should not incommode me.
“Come,” said I, helping myself,
“this is real handsome. I shall come
here again.”
“If you are going to be a regular
customer,” he whispered seductively,
“won't you avail yourself of our
splendid offer?” Meanwhile he toyed
with a little cigarette case.
“Old man,” I retorted sharply,
“don’t you think that, just because
you have got on my soft side once, I
am as simple as I look. You don't do
me like that.”
I believe that if I had called him
an oppressor of the poor and robber of
the unalert to his face he would only
have shaken his head and smiled
firmly. He explained that I had only
got to order and pay for five hundred
cigarettes, and I should get the silver
(he called it silver) case thrown in.
I thought hard. “I spot it,” I cried
triumphantly; “I shall have to buy
cigarettes. You will slip behind a
screen and put five hundred of the
same cigarettes in another box, with
purple ribbon on it. Five half-crowns

I understand,” I said, “though I can-
not quite see how, that when I produce
the case to a friend it will burst out
in coloured lights and flash the legend
‘Smoke and Enjoy Blank and Co.'s
Bond Street Cigarettes.’”
But no : it was not even that.
When one gets as far as I had got
in an argument with a shopman, one
has of course lost. In the end I left
with the first hundred cigarettes in my
hand, and in my ear his ringing promise
to have the case ready, duly mono-
gramed. “We shall see you again in
the morning, then, Sir?” he concluded
blithely.
“Get along with you,” said I. “You
know quite well that you will have

“Good evening, Sir,” he laughed.

tainty that you have been done by the
Company, and the impossibility of
finding out how, and what with the
wild hope (which you know to be
desperate even as you hope it) that you
have done the Company, you would get
so irritable that even the five hundred
excellent cigarettes, smoked on end,
would not calm you.
I did make one more attempt to get
at the truth. “Friend,” I said, calling
on him at his shop, “it is now your
turn to avail yourself of my splendid
offer. Here is another thirty bob.
It is yours on one small condition.
I have smoked the last cigarette of the
last row of each box, and they were all
up to sample. The thirty bob is yours

“IN any case the cat is a stray,”
remarked Reginald, “and a hideous
stray at that.”
“Yes, dearest,” replied his wife,
“but it's a cat, and as such appealed
to both of us when it crept into the
scullery door that snowy night last
February.” -
“Kindly remember, Mabel, I was
against your letting it in,” returned
Reginald.
“You may have been,” she replied;
“I also remember you were the one to
warm the bread and milk for it and

“Good-bye,” I answered bitterly.
However, there he was next morn-
ing, with the case ready for me.
“And the other four hundred cigar-
ettes we will send you from time to
time, as you order them 2"
“I will take them all now,” I de-
clared suddenly, and watched his face
narrowly. No ghastly pallor on his
cheeks, no blue at the lips, no sign of
the villain foiled, not even a wince
“It is no good,” I said; “I see that
I have got to be done. Probably you
have been sitting up all night doing
something to my four hundred; taking
the tobacco out of the paper, or putting
cheap paper round the tobacco.” And
with that we parted.
I do not give you the address, though
you could easily find it for yourself by
trying every shop in Bond Street, for
one reason because we do not advertise
in this part of the paper, and for the
other because, if I did and you went
and did likewise, it would only make
me where the catch is. For that there
is a catch in it somewhere you know
as well as I.”
The man said there was no eatch in
it, smiled happily, refused the thirty bob
and offered me another cigarette out of
the Company's box.

for the ugly little brute; but now, as you
can't find a home for it, our only possible
course is to have it destroyed before the
place is swarming with kittens, all
resembling their mother, only more
so."
“We could drown them,” said
Mabel; “at least, you could.”
“Thanks,” said Reginald coldly.
“Well, the greengrocer's boy would
do it for threepence.”
“No doubt; but you know, when it
came to it, you'd never let him.”
Mabel did not reply, but scratched
the scraggy back of the object under
discussion with the point of her slipper
instead. It was an ugly cat, with a
large pink nose, no chin to speak of,
a crafty pair of eyes, and a coat that
had probably seen better days.
“The best thing to do,” said Reginald,
“is to tell the chemist to give it a dose
of prussic acid.”
“I wouldn't for worlds,” replied
Mabel; “prussic acid hurts awfully.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
No, the only kind thing to do is to
send it to a lethal chamber, and let the
poor thing sleep out of one world into
another. But in either case it's sheer
murder.”
“Well, do that,” said Reginald; “I’ll
risk being hanged.”
“I think you are frightfully callous
and selfish,” said his wife. “Although
you claim a future existence for your-
self and deny it to animals, you
destroy their one little life without any
compunction, but set a ridiculous value
on your own, although you have got
another to follow.”
“Well, take your choice of the two
methods,” he said indifferently, “but I
handier.”
“No, it isn't, as a matter of fact,”
replied Mabel, “because Dunham the
Vet. has a lethal chamber for cats, and
all you have to do is to send him a
postcard asking him to fetch them
away.”
“Then do that,” said her husband,
as he prepared to start for the City,
“only remember,” he added authori-
tatively over his shoulder, “I wish it
dome.”
“Very well, diar,” said Mabel, and
set to work to write the postcard, but
found the drawing-up of the death-
warrant no easy matter, for she had
not the heart to say she wanted the cat
destroyed in so many words. In the
end she compromised by addressing it
to Mr. Dunham, The Lethal Chamber,
High Street (Local), and asking him
to fetch the cat away that aſternoon.
Then, leaving half-a-crown with the
maid to defray the charge, she went
up to town, hoping that a matinée
might divert her mind from the
tragedy.
“The boy fetched it this afternoon,”
she said reproachfully to Reginald
later in the day; “I was out, but he
took it in a basket, and said there was
no charge. I think Mr. Dunham is a
humane man and a credit to his sex.”
“So do I,” said Reginald with heart-
less gaiety; but he missed the cat, all
the same, and it was quite a week
before Mabel recovered her usual spirits.
Still, lots of things happened that
summer—two weddings in the family,
then the Coronation, and after that
their summer holiday, which was really
like a second honeymoon, until onc
morning a letter arrived bearing a
half-penny stamp and with the flap
folded inside.
“I told them not to forward circulars,”
grumbled Reginald.
“I don't think it's a circular,” said
his wife, “it looks like a bill.”

“I don't know,” said his wife, push-
ing it back, “unless,” she added
thoughtfully, “he didn't put our poor
pussy in the lethal chamber after all.”
“But you wrote and told him to ?”
“Well, as far as I remember, I told
him in my postcard to fetch the cat
away, and addressed it to the lethal
chamber. I didn't say “destroy it,'
in black and white, because I hadn't
the heart to, but I thought he'd under-
stand what I meant. Now I see why
there was no charge.”
“No chargel" howled Reginald. “Is

your soft-heartedness is going to cost
me. Do you know I've been keeping

“I think we have been done,” said
Mabel calmly. “He probably did kill
the cat and he's trying to swindle
you. I shouldn't pay.”
“I won't!” thundered Reginald,
“I’ll fight it!” and he wrote to Mr.
Dunham to that effect. Mr. Dunham
however replied that he had now de-
stroyed all the animals, was sorry the
mistake had occurred, but must insist
on payment, and was always prepared
for litigation.
In the end a compromise was effected.
The Wet. took three guineas and Mabel
went without another new (and un-
necessary) muslin frock. Reginald said
he thought it would be a lesson to her.
She quite agreed, and got the frock a
fortnight later.

THE TWO HOUSES.
“HILLVIEw" is my villa (or “Woodside,”
I always forget which is mine);
They stand in Dene Road, on the good side,
The first of their line.
The rest of the road is a huddle
Of masons and mortar and muddle;
The opposite path is a puddle,
But ours is quite firm, when it's fine.
I can go up to town by the G.C.,
Which runs at the top of the road;
But it also is equally easy
To leave my abode
And walk in the other direction
To catch the Great Western connection ;
There is nothing to sway my selection,
And that is the cause of this ode.
On returning at night from the City
(A thing I invariably do)
I behold, with a pang of self-pity,
“Woodside " and “Hillview.”
I am hungry, and henco my emotion;
They're as like as two drops in the ocean,
And I haven't the foggiest notion
As to which is my own of the two.
If the route up to town were not double,
My house would be second, or first,
From the Station, thus stopping the trouble
With which I am oursed;
But my memory's really so rotten
That I've always completely forgotten
If I caught the 6.12 to Hill Wotten,
Or the 6.17 to Wood Hurst.
And to me all such names as “Fernhollow,'
“Fairhazel,” “Poldune,” or “Tremunse"
Seem alike; I suppose it must follow
That I am a dunce,
That my mind what it meets barely skims on:
But I'll get my house painted bright crimson,
And I'll give it my own name, “James Simson,”
And then I shall know it at once.

IN A FIT.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. HYNDMAN's Record of an Adventurous Life (MAc-
MILLAN) is handicapped by three false starts. In a preface
accounting for the appearance of the book he calls in aid
the venerable excuse of the “pressure of friends” inducing
him to write it. In his opening sentence we find a cheap
jocosity: “There is every reason to believe I was born at
7, Hyde Park Square, on the 7th of March, 1842; though
birth, being the most important incident in the life of men,
is precisely that which none of them can remember, and I
am of course no exception to the rule.” Referring to “my
dear old friend Michael Davitt,” he turns aside to inquire,
“What would the Hyndmans of old time have said of such
friendship !”. Well, noblesse oblige. Mr. HYNDMAN tells us
his grandfather was a slave-running planter in the West
Indies, and might have been fastidious in respect of the
choice of his grandson's companions. Having known
DAVITT publicly and privately I should say the grandson
was honoured by the acquaintance of a gentleman of
chivalrous nature and charming manners. These banalities
apart, and his political views not taken too seriously, Mr.
HYNDMAN has written a book of considerable human interest.
Like Ulysses, he has travelled much. Many cities has he
seen, and his range of acquaintance with men of the last
half-century is wide and various. Of his politics it may
suffice to say that he speaks of the occupation of Egypt as
“a monstrous conquest"; of the action of a Government
confronted by the conspiracy of the Land League and the
episode of the murder of Lord FREDERICK CAvendish as
“intolerable tyranny"; and of the admininistration that

has brought India to its present state of unparalleled
prosperity as “ruinous misrule.” Preaching these and
similar doctrines as he went his way he found himself
occasionally misunderstood. A published commentary
upon the drift of things in the United States brought upon
him caustic rejoinder. “England,” wrote a New York
paper, discussing his screed, “sends many fool-travellers
to the United States, but never before such a fool as
this.” Perhaps the most delightful chapter in the book
contains his account of a morning call upon DISRAELI,
whom he desired to convert in his old age to Socialistic
principles. The interview lasted three hours. “Lord
Beaconsfield,” writes Mr. HYNDMAN, with the maiveté that
endears him to the reader, “had an attack of illness
shortly afterwards and died within a few weeks.”
One trivial objection I have to make against Lucas
MALET's long-expected new novel, Adrian Savage
(HUTCHINsoN), and then I can get on with the more
congenial task of praising it whole-heartedly. Since, to
one who knows anything whatever of the neighbourhood,
the identity of her “Stourmouth " (with its undercliff
drives, its pine forest and its consumptives) positively leaps
to the eye, I was constantly irritated at the superfluous
and unconvincing disguise. Why on earth not say
Bournemouth, and have done with it? Still, this is a
tiny blemish on a very remarkable achievement—the best
thing, I incline to think, that Mrs. HARRISON has yet given
us. There are two sets of characters in the book, only
united so far as they touch the fortunes of Adrian Savage
—the charming society of upper - class, artistic Paris,
amongst which he moves as journalist and man of affairs;

and the provincial circle of Branksome Park (to discard
pseudonyms) into which his duties as a trustee take
Adrian, and where he meets Joanna, who falls in love with
him. Joanna, the warped, unlovable heiress of a bullying
father, not only imagines herself engaged (on wholly
inadequate grounds) to her wonderful young cousin, but
incidentally in doing so simply swamps every other
character in the book. It is no disparagement to the
author's skill to say that beside the tragedy of this one
figure the rest seem puppets. Joanna, with her luxurious
empty life and her delusions, is almost terribly alive; she
dominates author and reader alike. Her story could hardly

“Anything is worth what people can be got to give for it,”

as I say, a very good story, and for two things especially
I thank him : he has made me sympathise with a hero
who was an absolute scoundrel from beginning to end—
always a grateful sensation ; and he has described so
intimately the life of certain citizens of Ford, and especially
be no two opinions. A
book that lingers in the
memory.
WILLIAM of ORANGE was
not a romantic prince, as
Miss MARJoRIE Bowen is
the first to admit. His
political and military
genius is a matter of his-
torical record; but the man
himself had not the
dramatic touch, the gift
of appreciating and living
up to the sentiments
which his deeds might be
expected to arouse in his
audience and indeed in
himself. It is certain that
he displayed no emotions;
it is doubtful if he felt
any; in the result, he could
not inspire popularity.
Categorically insisting on
this fact, Miss Bow EN
has yet contrived to weave
a most rom antic and
dramatic tale from the
incidents of his career.
Louis, JAMEs, MARY and
ANNE and all the protago-
nists of the time appear,
but the central figure is
always WILLIAM's : and,

one point that Mr. ARNoLD

to avoid suggesting certain

sails very close to the wind

Tommy : a Tale of the

by Mr. CHARLEs GLEIG
(late Lieut. R.N.), I find
this bald statement: “The

Just that. Neither inside
the book nor out can I find
the known facts, you are
compelled to follow his story as you would follow that of
the most popular hero imaginable. The truth is that he is
stated to be one thing and portrayed as another; for, if you
take the trouble to refer back, when your first excitement
has abated, you will find that he says and does no single
thing that is not intensely attractive and, in the better
sense, theatrical. For your own enjoyment, however, you
will do well to leave that objection, together with a split
infinitive or two, to the pedants, and read God and the King
(METHUEN) for a magnificent story quite magnificently told.
I can remember a very good short story by Mr. OLIVER
ONIONs about a highwayman, and in Good Boy Seldom
(METHUEn) he has told us another, a long one this time,
with the Strand for the highway and flash-light advertise-
ments for the pistols of his hero. Good Boy Seldom, whose
other name was James Enderby Wace, came from Yorkshire,
and to the Yorkshireman's hardness of body and head he
added a dreamy metaphysical bent, which made him averse
a word about the offer or
the competition or the conditions. And that means that
there are things going on which even the most alert of us
miss. Still, I am afraid a young friend of mine, who would
certainly have had a cut at it because he badly wants a
new bicycle, would not have won even if I had given him
the tip. Mr. GLEIG has earned the money. Personally I
am not altogether sure that I approve of a young rascal
of a ship's boy who “pinches” a middy's uniform, joins
his ship in his name, saves the Commander's life from the
fury of King Wanga Wanga of Tabonga, gets mentioned
in dispatches, and eventually wins from the Admiralty his
gunroom rating. But he'll go down right enough among |
the youngsters who are destined to make his acquaititance,

At the mere thought of their proposed cremation

Is it for merit, first or second class,
Or just because it calls itself a Book 2

Yet, as a savage contemplates his totem,

Curtains and carpets fade and leave me cold;

And bid the relics to the scrapper go,
But on my precious books if Time the spoiler
Should lay his hand they stick in statu quo.
New ones may come and want a vacant site,
But they sit tight.

TRIPOLI TRIALS.
“Why not find an Italian 2" said Mabel, as we discussed
the dearth of British female labour. “She would keep
us on thrushes and Chianti, and we could imagine we
were living in Rome.”
Mabel, I need hardly explain, is as yet young in house-
keeping. That is why I watched the fog settling amongst
the chimneys of Victoria Street, and made no audible
reply.
Rosa Rosmunda came the next week.
Rosa Rosmunda is a dark, deep-voiced woman of forty-
n1ne. --
Even so early as the first day, Rosa Rosmunda sang a
little. She affected the ultra-passionate mode. But Mabel's
comprehension of Italian is not really nimble, and she
seemed to think that the “amore ” and “belle donne ''
brought a breath of the South into the flat.
Thus things were just possible until THE WAR broke out.
We were awakened one morning by the deep voice of
Rosa Rosmunda chanting in tones of menacing resolution :
“Se Um-ber-to mi da la spa-da,
Quel-la spa-da
Quel-la spa-a-da,
Se Um-ber-to mi da la spa-da,
Quel-la spa-da por-ter-o."
The fact that her threatened assumption of the sword was
made conditional upon its presentation to her by the hands
of a King of Italy long ago dead, seemed to reduce a little
the risks of the undertaking.
When the “spada" was quite finished with, the “fucile"
was taken and exercised. After that, in turn, every
known weapon in the arsenals of war, and after that—
da capo. It was awful. There was a sentimental refrain
which should have had its place in the chant; but in the
ardour of patriotism this was generally forgotten. Battle
was the business.
It went on for days. We did not know what to do.
Mabel maintained that no human being should be denied
the gift of song—that it was to twist the neck of a lark to
interfere. But I watched her colour fading daily, and my
work had been at a standstill for a week, when we told
Rosa Rosmunda that we feared she would not suit us.
Oh, the bliss that then reigned in our little home! The
woman seemed to know her voice had been her ruin, and
went about her tasks mouse-quiet.
It was all so pleasant that Mabel actually began to
veer round towards her again. She came to the conclusion
indeed that no loyal Italian could have acted otherwise.
But she was sure that “silly old Tripoli" could interest
nobody now. She argued, moreover, that the woman had
had a lesson, and naturally would not sing again, and that
it would be the height of foolishness to part with a good
servant.
The end of it was, of course, that we told Rosa Rosmunda
that, on reconsidering the matter, we found she would
suit us very well.

Rosa Rosmunda's voice has gained in strength and
volume during her recent period of depression. But after
all, as Mabel said, even if we had a Chinaman it would
be the same just now.

[Mlle. FELICIA, a Hungarian dancer, has been
appearing at the Hippodrome. In her principal
dance she obtains, it is said, “one of the most
extraordinary effects by a curious movement of
the nape of the neck upwards."]
AT the Crematorium the chief attrac-
tion is Frl. Rollmops, whose dancing is
full of the most singular suggestiveness.
In one of her measures, appropriately
entitled Liebelei, she does some in-
credible things with her calves, which
are made to express a wide variety of
emotions—now of coaxing tenderness,
now of burning passion, and in the end
of contemptuous rejection. Frl. Roll-
mops' performance is a stupefying
revelation to those unacquainted with
the more recent development of the
terpsichorean art.
M. Djujitsovitch, who is to be seen
at the Pandemonium, has introduced
to London a dance which nightly
holds an over-crowded house in an
unparalleled grip. Attention is first
riveted by a spasmodic twitching of
the knee-cap; the movement then
gradually spreads to other sections of
the body, the dance finishing with a
tremendous tour de force in the form
of a concerted jerk of the Adam's apple
and the Achilles tendon.
The new Sardinian dancer at the
Empyrean, Signora Rigli, created an
immense furore at her first appearance
the other evening. In the chief item
of her repertoire she achieves an
amazing sensation by a deft manipu-
lation of her collar-bone, which is
seen to move in a sinuous wave,
culminating in a shudder that leaves
the spectator clammy with a nameless
terror.
It has been left to Miss Truly
Allwright, who comes here with a big
reputation from the States, to demon-
strate to a British audience the subtle,
yet staggering effect that can be
produced in a dance by bringing into
play the muscles of the ears. In a
wonderful “Wag-time” number she
employs these organs with irresistible
charm, and the final flap invariably
brings down the house.
We are asked to state that, owing to
a slight dislocation sustained at re-
hearsal, Mlle. Cuibofio, the “Venezuelan
Venus,” will be unable to give her
famous spinal-cord dance at the Capi-
tolium this week.

THE LUCKLESS PALACE.
IN addition to the public meetings
to discuss the future of the Crystal
Palace, other gatherings have met with
the same purpose, but rather to arrange
for private than public proprietorship
or tenancy. We report the proceed-
ings at the most influential of these.

Avebury, fresh from a sparkling
evening with the Poetry of Action

addition to many shareholders, were

hoped there would be no violence
during the proceedings. They
must remember that those who
live in glass houses should not

were met to consider the future
of the famous building. It would
grieve him very much to see it
go. He hoped that some practical
proposition for saving it would be
brought forward that afternoon, a
Life was real, life was earnest.
The Right Hon. F. E. SMITH,
K.C., M.P., asked for the use of
the building as a club-house for
the Halsbury Club. . .His only
fear, he said, was that it might
not be large enough, but they
were prepared to put up with a
little inconvenience. The place,
he said, peculiarly appealed to
them and their revered leader by
reason of the transparency of its
walls, for they had nothing to
hide and welcomed publicity. In
fact, it was the attraction of
publicity that had brought many
of them together. Declined.
Mr. IMRF. KIRALFY offered to
purchase the palace and grounds en bloc

there, to be devoted to the various
important countries of the world. The
first would be a German Exhibition, as
that was calculated to be popular and
would have the support of the Editor of
The Nation and a number of leading
Radicals. The next would be devoted
to San Marino. The next to Abyssinia,
and so on. Fortunately it had been
proved by ethnologists that all these
nations shared a common passion for
great wheels, flip-flaps, scenic railways,
and witching waves, so that the public
might be assured of fun while imbibing
instruction. Declined.

Crystal Palace as a permanent school
for the instruction of Russian dancers
in sufficient numbers to meet the
requirements of the thousand-and-one

programme. Declined.

thanks. -
Finally, a letter was read from a
syndicate of cinematoscope managers,
offering a substantial rent for the
Palace as the scene for their varied
operations—battles, pursuits, tragedies
and farces. After a long discussion it
was decided that, for the present, this
was the most reasonable offer, and
that to accept it would be to increase
the happiness and well-being of the
country, which has so taken the cinema
to its heart that it cannot be happy
without it even in the smallest towns.
A recommendation to open negotiations
with the syndicate was therefore made
and the meeting broke up.

life as he passes over the office thres-

until my partner came into my room
to speak to me an hour or so later.

other people whose remarks intervene
from time to time do not matter.
They talk, not because they have any-
thing of importance to say, but simply
because they cannot refrain from talk-
ing. It is their idea of pleasure. I,
however, have a duty to perform. I
was to remember to telephone to you.
You see: I have remembered. Won't
your sister be pleased, and aren't you
going to congratulate me?"
Olive remarked upon the improve-
ment in me, and Exchange, being of
opinion that, when a thing is done,
it is done and there is no use in talk-
ing about it, asked if we had finished.
“Yes,” said I.
“No,” said Olive.
“Of course,” I said, “you want to
remind me not to forget to tell my wife
that I did telephone to you. Rest
assured, my dear Olive. That is the
sort of thing a man does not forget.
You can rely on me. Good-bye.”
“But what about the message?”
cried Olive's voice, and my receiver
did its best to reproduce her agitation.
“My dear girl,” I remonstrated, “I
am not perfect. When one has suc-
ceeded in performing a difficult duty, it
is depressing to be called upon at once
to perform yet another. Surely a man
may be allowed to forget something?
And the ingratitude of it and the greed
of you!”
“Idiot!” said the voice briefly.
“And now you vituperate. Observe
the reward of virtue. If I had omitted
to telephone to you, you would not
have said one cross word to me.”
“You’ll get it when you go home,”
said the voice with joy.
“And, yet again, you are spiteful.

shall answer truthfully, ‘Yes.' I shall
then get good marks and immediate

Listen, and I will tell you how it's done.
Do not imagine that the bard is born,
Nor think the bay-leaf on his skull is
Worn
Because it grows there—like a bison's

Not much. Nor yet by thought or
studious care.
This is no intellectual affair;
It isn't in the head; it 's in the hair /
Yon man of song, whose overflowing
mat
Floats down his neck and clusters
round his hat—
Why do you think he goes about like
that ?
From force of habit? Bless your silly
heart,
This is the very sinews of his art;
Give him a hair-cut and he's in the
cart.
Yet, though some help is patently
required
By those whose locks leave much to be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DOCTOR.
“MAY I look at my watch?” I asked
my partner, breaking a silence which
had lasted from the beginning of the
waltz.
“Oh, have you got a watch 2" she
drawled. “How exciting !”
“I wasn't going to show it to you,”
I said. “But I always think it looks
so bad for a man to remove his arm
from a lady's waist in order to look
at his watch—I mean without some
sort of apology or explanation. As
though he were wondering if he could
possibly stick another five minutes of
it.”
“Let me know when the apology is
beginning,” said Miss White. Perhaps,
after all, her name wasn't White, but,
anyhow, she was dressed in white, and
it's her own fault if wrong impressions
arise.
“It begins at once. I’ve got to
catch a train home. There's one at
12.45, I believe. If I started now I
could just miss it.” -
“You don't live in these Northern
Heights then 2"
“No. Do you?”
“Yes.”
I looked at my watch again.
“I should love to discuss with you
the relative advantages of London and
Greater London,” I said; “the flats
and cats of one and the big gardens of
the other. But just at the moment
the only thing I can think of is whether
I shall like the walk home. Are there
any dangerous passes to cross?”
“It’s a nice wet night for a walk,”
said Miss White reflectively.
“If only I had brought my bicycle.”
“A watch and a bicycle ! You are
lucky 1’’ r
“Look here, it may be a joke to you,
but I don't fancy myself coming down
the mountains at night.”
“The last train goes at one o'clock,
if that 's any good to you.”
“All the good in the world,” I said
joyfully. “Then I needn't walk.” I
looked at my watch. “That gives us
five minutes more. I could almost tell
you all about myself in the time.”
“It generally takes longer than
that,” said Miss White. “At least
it seems to.” She sighed and added,
“My partners have been very auto-
biographical to-night.”
I looked at her severely.
“I'm afraid you're a Suffragette,”
I said.
As soon as the next dance began I
hurried off to find my hostess. I had
just caught sight of her, when—
“Our dance, isn't it 2 ” said a voice.
I turned and recognised a girl in
blue.
“Ah,” I said, coldly cheerful, “I was
just looking for you. Come along.”
We broke into a gay and happy
step, suggestive of twin hearts utterly
free from care.
“Why do you look so thoughtful ?”
asked the girl in blue after ten minutes
of it.
“I’ve just heard some good news,”
I said.
“Oh, do tell me!”
“I don't know if it would really
interest you.”
“I’m sure it would.”
“Well, several miles from here there
may be a tram, if one can find it, which
goes nobody quite knows where up till
one-thirty in the morning probably. It
is now,” I added, looking at my watch
(I was getting quite good at this),
“just on one o'clock and raining hard.
All is well.”
The dance over, I searched in vain
for my hostess. Every minute I took
out my watch and seemed to feel that
another tram was just starting off to
some unknown destination. At last I
could bear it no longer and, deciding to
write a letter of explanation on the
morrow, I dashed off.
My
with regard to the habitat of trams
(thrown in by her at the last moment
in case the train failed me) were vague.
Five minutes' walk convinced me that
I had completely lost any good that
they might ever have been to me.
Instinct and common sense were the
only guides left. I must settle down
to some heavy detective work.
The steady rain had washed out any
footprints that might have been of
assistance, and I was unable to follow
up the slot of a tram conductor of
which I had discovered traces in
Two-hundred-and-fifty-first Street. In
Three - thousand - eight - hundred - and
ninety-seventh Street I lay with my
ear to the ground and listened in-
tently, for I seemed to hear the ting-
ting of the electric car, but nothing
came of it; and in Four-millionth
Street I made a new resolution. I
decided to give up looking for trams
and to search instead for London—
the London that I knew.
I felt pretty certain that I was still
in one of the Home Counties, and I
did not seem to remember having
crossed the Thames, so that if only I
could find a star which pointed to the
south I was in a fair way to get home.
I set out to look for a star; with the
natural result that, having abandoned
all hope of finding a man, I immedi-
ately ran into him.
“Now then,” he said good-naturedly.
“Could you tell me the way to—”
I tried to think of some place
instructions from Miss White |
near my London—“to Westminster
Abbey?”
He looked at me in astonishment.
His feeling seemed to be that I was too
late for the Coronation and too early
for the morning service. -
“Or-or anywhere,” I said hurriedly.
“Trams, for instance.”
He pointed nervously to the right
and disappeared.
Imagine my joy; there were tram-
lines, and better still a tram approach-
ing. I tumbled in, gave the conductor
a penny, and got a workman's ticket
in exchange. Ten minutes later we
reached the terminus.
I had wondered where we should
arrive, whether Gray's Inn Road or ;
Southampton Row, but didn't much
mind so long as I was again within
reach of a cab. However, as soon as I
stepped out of the tram, I knew at
once where I was.
“Tell me,” I said to the conductor;
“do you now go back again 2" -
“In ten minutes. There's a tram
from here every half-hour.”
“When is the last 2 ''
“There's no last. Backwards and
forwards all night.”
I should have liked to stop and
sympathise, but it was getting late. I
walked a hundred yards up the hill
and turned to the right. . . . As I
entered the gates I could hear the
sound of music.
“Isn't this our dance 2 " I said to
Miss White, who was taking a breather
at the hall door. “One moment,” I
added, and I got out of my coat and
umbrella.
“Is it? I thought you'd gone.”
“Oh, no, I decided to stay after
all. I found out that the trams go all
night.”
We walked in together.
“I won't be more autobiographical |
than I can help,” I said, “but I must
say it's a hard life, a doctor's. One is
called away in the middle of a dance
to a difficult case of of mumps or
something, and—well, there you are.
A delightful evening spoilt. If one
is lucky one may get back in time for a
waltz or two at the end.
“Indeed,” I said, as we began to
dance; “at one time to-night I quite
thought I wasn't going to get back
here at all.” A. A. M.
From a book catalogue: -
“HALL CAINE, Two LETTElts, both on note-
paper stamped ‘Greeba Castle, Isle of Man . ;
one is typewritten to a builder asking him to do
some repairs and bears Hall Caine's signature;
the other is written by Hall Caine to the same
builder saying he encloses his cheque."
No offers from us. But we would gladly
have bought the builder's letter if Mr.
CAINE hadn't enclosed the cheque.

And all the dells are bare and bonfires smoke,
The bard (by rights) should be extremely worried,
He ought not to evolve a single joke,

And I (of old) have felt the chestnuts patter
Like sound of nails upon my coffin-lid;

“The flowers,” I said, “are gone; once more Proserpina

And she said nothing, but removed the breakfast-plates.
But now (I know not why) I feel quite jolly;
The ways are thick with mire, the woods are sere;
The rain is falling, I have lost my brolly,
Yet still my aptitude for song and cheer
Seems unaffected by the damp. It's deuced queer.
And when I wander by the leafless spinneys
I notice as a mere phenomenon
The way they've moulted; I would give two guineas
To feel the good old thrill, but ah, it's gone :
I neither weep nor tear my hair; I just move on.
I quite enjoy my meals (it seems like treason);
Far other was the case in days of yore,
When every mood of mine subserved the season—
Mirth for the flowery days, and mirth no more
When Summer ended and her garlands choked the floor.
You bid me take my fill of joy, dear reader,
And hang repining ! but I dread my bliss;
If I can prove myself a hearty feeder,
Saying to tea-shop fairs, “Two crumpets, Miss,"
What time Demeter's daughter feels that icy kiss,
Shall I be some day cold to Nature's laughter?
Shall I no longer leap and shout and sing
And shake with vernal odes the echoing rafter,
When at the first warm flush of amorous Spring
The woodlands shine again? That would be *.s.

House of Commons, Tuesday, October
24.—Considering inconvenience of Au-
tumn sessions, the strain on Ministers,
the upsetting of business and domestic
arrangements among private Mennbers,
attendance surprisingly large. Among
notable absentees were WINSTON and
McKENNA, who on eve of re-opening
Parliament have, to general surprise
and some mystification, exchanged
offices. It's what HALSBURY, if his
mind were not engrossed by lcºtier
themes, would call “a sort of "thimble-
rigging business. You lift a thimble
labelled Admiralty expecting to find
McKENNA, and behold WINSTON en-
deavouring to master one of the things
that baffled the Prophet AGUR, to wit,
the way of a ship on the sea. Another
thimble labelled Home Office. Pick it
up looking for WINSTON attempting to
square Labour Members, and lo! the
dome-like head of McKENNA.

afresh how misleading is a little

session for Government business.
When he concluded, having indicated,
in addition to Insurance Bill, catalogue
of measures sufficient, according to
old-fashioned notions, for length of
ordinary session, a still small voice was
heard enquiring, “Does the Right Hon.

Health (Acquisition of Water) Bill?”
It was LEIFJoNEs, on whose shoulders
has fallen the cloak of champion of
water-drinkers dropped from the genial
hands of WILFRID LAwson. Roar of
laughter that followed put House in
good humour for next half-hour.
PRINCE ARTHUR, rising to reply to

cheers from Opposition benches, hilari-
ously echoed in Ministerial camp.

its dignity is higher, its responsibility

pithy sentence ARCHER-SHEE summed
up present position of the measure,
“Even the Stygian eloquence of the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER him-
self,” he said, “has not been able to
whitewash the white elephant entirely.”
House cordially recognised in this way
of putting it the stitch in time that
hits the right nail on the head.

Friday.—Quite pretty to see PRINCE
ARTHUR and ColoneL CARson, K.C.,

ably conversing just as if there had
never been such a thing as the Halsbury
Club. SARK tells me it was of that
they talked, though which of the two
communicated to him the text of the
conversation is one of those things I
may never learn.
PRINCE ARTHUR, according to this
authority, displayed liveliest interest
in the new institution.
“It's nothing like a Murder-Club,
is it?” he asked. “They meet, you
know, at odd times in secret places,
discuss the latest crime, speculate
on trail of murderer if not yet
discovered, and occasionally plot the
removal of a common acquaintance
who in some respects fails to come up
to the high level of their standard of
excellence. I am a child in these
matters. But I have been told that
the Halsbury Club is based on revival
of good old-fashioned English manners.
At their social meetings they live the
simple life. Have no tablecloth on
their deal supper-table; drink English
beer out of tankards; smoke clay pipes
(the President being distinguished by
use of a churchwarden); feed mostly
on bread and cheese, with an occasional
dish of tripe, it being stipulated that
the wrinkles, which I understand are
peculiar to that form of cutlet, shall
not have been smoothed out by use of
foreign machinery.”
“You are altogether wrong,” said the
CoLoREL, fingering imaginary epaulet
on his left shoulder. “There is pos-
sibly a scintillation of actuality in
the idea of, in certain circumstances,
putting someone out of the way. The
rest is idle tattle. I confess there is
something pictures lue in idea of HALS-
BURY with stem of a churchwarden in
his mouth and a tankard of beer at his
elbow, but we have not realized it yet.
“Fact is the Halsbury Club is
composed exclusively of statesmen
who feel they are capable of directing
affairs of the Unionist Party better
than—well, let us say better than LANs-
Downe. You know the sort of men
they are. There is HALSBURY, whose
claims upon the gratitude of the State
for service done are equalled only by
those established in the domestic circle;
Northumberland, one of the most in-
telligent of our Dukes; and, above all,
WILLough BY DE BROKE.
“Now there's an all-round states-
man if you like. I know more about
military affairs and forced marching
across country than of politics. But I
confess that when I hear WILLough BY
speak in the Lords, or read reports of
his addresses in the country, I recognise
a rare amalgam combining the over-
whelming oratorical force of GLADSTONE
with the subtlety and statesmanship
of Dizzy. WILLough BY, you know, is
the founder of the club and personally
conducts it. That of itself suffices to
ensure success and the accomplishment
of its patriotic desire.”
“Dear me,” said PRINCE ARTHUR,
“you interest me strangely. I suppose
the list of membership is not closed ?
If you think I'm in any way eligible
I should esteem it a privilege to be
favoured by your undertaking to pro-
pose me.”
“I’ll ask WILLough BY,” said CARson,
rising rather hurriedly and making for
the door.
“Do,” said PRINCE ARTHUR. “Per-
haps he'll second the nomination.”

THE ANTIQUE CLOCK.
I HAVE a deep-rooted horror of
auctioneers, at least in their public
capacity. Of their private life I cannot
speak with any authority, but I have a
confirmed belief that when the head of
the family returns from the heat of the
day and prepares to ladle out the soup
his face will suddenly brighten, and in
a great voice, flourishing the spoon the
while, he will remark, “Ladies and
gents, what offers?” only to subside
at a glance from his wife into a gloomy
Bilence. -
Sometimes I have fluttered for a few
brief moments on the fringe of the
bidders, but never without instantly
catching the auctioneer's eye. Possibly
he mistakes my careworn expression
for genuine concern regarding the price
less article in his hand. “George,” he
invariably bawls to his assistant, “show
the fish-forks and knives complete to
the stout party in the top 'at.” I hope
for the best, but can see no other top
hats in my proximity. George pushes
his way through the interested spec-
tators, and I extract a fork without
enthusiasm. There is an awkward
all Se.
“Well, Sir 2" cries the auctioneer
with husky expectation.
“Two shillings,” I murmur with
sullen despair, and a cold shiver passes
over me in case I am within reasonable
reach of that alarming armoury.
The auctioneer leans forward, as-
suming a temporary deafness.
“Did I 'ear the gentleman aright,
George 2" he inquires, adding irony
to righteous indignation. “Did I 'ear
'im say “two bob’ for that 'andsome
set of cutlery, hall 'all-marked 2 Not
two bob, George 2" He has the look
of a man prepared for a strong denial.
I nod feverishly. The auctioneer
shakes his head with profound emotion
and looks about for sympathy. I
begin to feel an unscrupulous fellow.
The spectators survey me with mild
curiosity.
“George,” continues the auctioneer
firmly, “bring the case back. I was
mistaken, George. The gent thinks,
because he sports a top 'at, 'e can 'ave
'is little joke. Bit of a wag, George—
comes in to waste our time and the

He says much else, but I have
reached the door by that time and
gained the sanctuary of the street.
It was after dinner Evelyn broached
the subject. There is an absence of
fair play in feminine tactics.
“He’s such a nice man,” she said
musingly.
“Nice?—an auctioneer? Oh, come,
my dear! you're facetious.” I smiled
in a superior fashion.
“But his clocks are outrageously
cheap,” she added, warming to the
subject. “Of course one does not like
taking advantage of the man, but it's
a chance in a thousand. Such beauti-
ful clocks with carved doodle-dabbles
on the face and * >
“But we have a clock—lots of clocks.
Why create a greater disturbance and
rivalry than at present 2"
Evelyn sighed. “Don’t be silly,
dear. We'll just run down to-morrow,
and if we're first when the shop opens
at nine we'll pick up the bargain of
our lives.”
It is hopeless arguing with her when
she talks like that.
It was striking nine when we entered
the shop. The auctioneer seemed a
little surprised as we bustled in.
After a few moments' pause, however,
he stepped behind his table and coughed
politely just to put us at our ease and
to indicate that the arena was cleared.
“I think you said the antique clock,
Madam?” he remarked briskly. “The
very last—a treasure—a remarkably
fine timepiece, eighteenth-century style
with double gongs, three strikes, alarm
and bevelled fingers.”
He recited the full category of its
features and accomplishments with rare
fluency.
“Bevelled fingers are out of date,” I
said brightly, in case he thought we
were impressed, which we were.
Even Evelyn looked at me with pity.
“So is the clock, Sir," responded the
auctioneer with gentle courtesy.
There are moments when a retort
seems beyond the range of reason. I
wished I had been less ambitious and
asked where the cuckoo was. That
would have taken the wind out of his
sai's. He couldn't have known we
already have two clocks which with
varying strikes deliver some twenty
triumphant cuckoos every midnight.
We turned again to business.
“Now, Madam,” resumed the auc-
tioneer, “as there appears to be no
competition * > -
“I beg your pardon,” broke in a
voice from a wardrobe, “but I want
that clock.” - -
“It is no real use to a wardrobe,” I
said firmly. . .
But at that moment a stout, dis-
tinguished lady appeared round the
corner and eyed us in a melancholy
fashion. -
Evelyn started.
“Be calm,” I whispered, fearing
she would fell her with the family
umbrella.
“Come, come, Madam,” said the
auctioneer with polite remonstrance
addressed to the new-comer; “there is
a selection of other articles very ser-
viceable and inexpensive. This lady
particularly desires the clock; it is the
very last.” His conclusion was a fine
touch of pathos, but hardly diplomatic.
“I want the clock,” repeated the
distinguished lady with heavy deter- |
mination.
The auctioneer shrugged his shoul-
ders. There was evidently nothing
more to be said. But the glance he
cast in our direction clearly showed
where his sympathy lay.
“In that case,” he continued, “it
must go to the highest bidder. What
shall we say for a start? I’m sure I
need not tell you of the exceptional
quality of the article * x
“Spare us that,” I cried. He looked
at me sourly and waited.
There was a ghastly silence ; I
mopped my brow.
“Five shillings,” said Evelyn sud-
denly.
“Ten," from the stout lady.
“Twelve,” snapped Evelyn, the light
of battle in her eye.
“Fourteen,” added the other com-
petitor monotonously.
Evelyn was startled. She glanced
nervously at me. I stared fixedly at
the auctioneer's preposterous cravat.
I noted that his foxhead pin had lost
an eye.
“Sixteen,” cried Evelyn, trembling
with suppressed fury.
“Pound ! ” thundered the stout dis-
tinguished lady, like a gale.
“Thirty shillings with the key,” I
roared, flushed with the evil ardour of
competition.
“Forty,” from the stout lady.
I nudged Evelyn casually to indicate
the psychological moment had arrived.
“There's something somewhere by
somebody about a tide in the affairs of
men,” I began helpfully, but was cut
short, for Evelyn, with an heroic effort
to appear unconcerned and in accents
simulating passionless determination,
broke silence. “Forty-five,” she said,
like a person with a cold, and clutched
my arm in a fevered grasp.
There was a painful pause.
The auctioneer wore a smile indica-
tive of nothing at all.
The stranger had succumbed.
We tried to look sympathetic as we
retired with the antique clock concealed
in brown paper, and the accompanying
cannon-ball (which during business
hours careered in mid-air on a piece of
string) in my pocket.
Evelyn, dear child, even went up to
the stout lady and murmured she was
so sorry, but she wanted it so badly to
match the tea-set or something else
quite improbable, while the stout lady

We had a little dinner and theatre
just to celebrate the event. I reckoned
out the total cost of the transaction

ANSWERS TO ENQUIRERS.
CoNJUGAL FELICITY — To REGAIN.
(“Anacious.”) Yours,"Anxious,” is indeed
a knotty problem. You ask us “If a
husband, A., discovers that his wife, B.,
is inclined to flirtation with C., a third
party, what should A. do? Despairing
of finding the correct answer ourselves,
we have called in the assistance of
several expert dramatists (those unerr-
ing judges of the human heart) and
now give you a selection from their
replies.
. . “A. should simulate a passion for a
fourth party, D., when B. will at
once come round, and C. and D. can
pair off together.” (Received from
Comedy & Wyndham's.)
“A. should lure B. and C. into the
middle of an earthquake, when B. will
confess her real love for A., and can
then be rescued, leaving C. to perish.”
(A. ºl.)
“A. should shoot C., with the observa-
tion, “You cur, how many men have
served their time for conduct less
infamous than yours!’” (Shoreditch.)

own choice.

Strictly speaking, there is no correct

rarer varieties we fear you are now too

R THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
P. L.
My clerk opened the door quietly and
murmured, “Gentleman tº see you, Sir.
Private business. Looks respectable.
Gave me this, Sir.”
“This '' was a card, rather larger than
seemed necessary, with a broad edging
of black. It said, in the middle :
“ALBERT PURDIE, P.L.”
There was an address, in Conduit
Street, in the left-hand corner; in the
right were the words “Privacy and
Satisfaction Guaranteed.”
Speculation as to the meaning of P.L.
was cut short by the entry of Mr. Purdie,
uninvited. He was a youngish, san-
guine-looking person, with a manner
that suggested greased silk.
“Pardon what may seem like an
intrusion,” he said gently. “But I
knew you would be puzzling over my
card. I would not venture to take up
your time, Sir, if I were not certain
that I could be of service to you.”
“In what way?" I asked.
“In a strictly confidential way,” he
answered, with a glance in the direction
of the clerk.
“You need not wait, William,” I said.
He disappeared.
“Well,” I asked, “what is it you
want, Mr. Purdie 2 "
“I would rather say, what do you
want, Sir 2 But in the first place you
probably want to know what ‘P.L.'
stands for.”
“If it won't take you too long to
explain,” I said guardedly. He looked
like a person with a slack jaw.
“Three minutes, Sir,” Mr. Purdie
said easily. “You know what a private
detective is. Part of his business, per-
haps the least unpleasant part, is to
find people who are lost. Well, my
firm's business is just the converse.
We deal with people whom our clients
are anxious to lose.”
“I'm afraid I don't quite follow you,
Mr. Purdie—and I'm rather busy this
morning.”
“P.L.,” said Mr. Purdie, disregarding
my hint, “stands for Professional Loser.
Possibly you have relatives in the United
States. Let us assume that you have a
widowed aunt in New York with per-
haps a highly unpresentable son. They
write that they are coming to London
(England) to look you up, and hope you
will be so vurry kind as to show them
your metropolis. You would not be
particularly joyful when you received
this letter.”
“Probably not.”
“Well, would it be worth your while
to send us a note of your aunt's name
and description, the ship she would
come by, and a cheque for £5 for pre-
liminary expenses, if we undertook to
lose her and her son, so far as you were
concerned 2 "
“It would be cheap at the price.”
I admitted warmly. “But how would
you manage it 2 I could not be a party
to the use of violence—at least, not
against my aunt.”
Mr. Purdie smiled.
“There is nothing so crude about our
methods. Our agent, travelling up with
her in the boat train, would talk her into
an extended Continental tour.
he would see her safely to Paris, and
lose her there.”
“But supposing she tired of Paris?”
“Did you ever hear of an American
who tired of Parrus 2 " Mr. Purdie
asked in a surprised tone. “Even
then there are Rome, Venice, Vienna,
St. Petersburg.”
“I see.”
“Much depends, of course, upon
the personal charm of our agents. I
always undertake the most stubborn
cases myself.”
“But I don't understand how you
could do all this for £5, especially if
you went yourself, Mr. Purdie.”
“You forget, my dear Sir, that there
are thousands of people in London,
every season, who are anxious to lose
American relatives and willing to pay
for the privilege. Our agent can
waylay and deal with six parties at
once, personally conducting them into
the less accessible German spas, and
detaining them there till their time is
up and their money exhausted. Then
there is our export trade also. No
doubt you have a nephew who declines
either to work or to emigrate 2"
“Two,” I admitted ruefully.
“We might make a reduction for
two,” Mr. Purdie said cheerfully, “if
we could plant them out on the same
orange farm in Florida. Say eight
pounds and travelling expenses.”
“I would run to that certainly.
But how would you keep them from
coming back?”
“Our agent in Florida would attend
to that,” Mr. Purdie said importantly.
“He has had no failures yet. It is a
matter of will-power, entirely. Then
there is our Club connection. It is
increasing every week. Would you
think it worth an extra guinea a year
to obtain complete protection from
your Club bore ?”
“You mean Colonel Demmytol 2"
“Precisely. That would be worth
something, I am sure. Now, Sir, will
you put our system to the test ? A free
sample of our method is quite at your
disposal."
“Thank you,” I said. “I accept your
offer. By way of a start, will you
please show me how quickly you can
lose yourself?”
In fact,
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF ANTHRO-
POPHAGY.
(An Exercise in the manner of one of
the new “Times " middle-men.)
ON no subject has public opinion
gone more hopelessly astray than that
of anthropophagy, the true psycho-
logical inwardness of which, it cannot
be too often reiterated, can only be
appreciated by those who, like the
present writer, have made practical
trial of it themselves. The first
occasion was in the Solomon Islands
at a grand corroboree, at which I was
the principal guest. The second time
was in the heart of New Guinea, where
I narrowly escaped forming the piece
de résistance at a banquet given in
celebration of the introduction of the
gramophone. I confess that at the
outset it was impossible to overcome
a certain repugnance; but this speedily
passed away under the influence of the
moral tessitura of the scene, the kindly
welcome and weird ululations of my
hosts, and the hypnotising magic of the
tropical surroundings. Hostile critics
of the institution make a profound
mistake in imagining that it implies
any personal animosity on the part of
the anthropophagist. Such a feeling
never enters into his head. His
emotions are purely impersonal and
are compatible with a perfect regard
for the greatest happiness of the
greatest number.
Anthropophagy may be fairly called
the chess of gastronomy. It not only
enlarges the horizons of dietetic enter-
prise, but it exerts an emancipating
influence on the subliminal conscious-
ness. It is in keeping, moreover, with
the highest dictates of pragmatism,
and in a hundred subtle and delicate
ways is allied to the philosophy of
M. BERGson. My experiences in New
Guinea, I may add, convinced me of
the fact that this practice, so far from
engendering any resentment on the
part of those who are its subjects,
positively inflames them with a sense
of overwhelming gratitude. I can only
say in conclusion that the physical
inconvenience involved is as nothing
to the mental anguish and reiterated
irritation of the beginner at golf.
Besides, as Professor Embruck has
pointed out, it saves funeral expenses.

“John's Neverland had a lagoon with flamingoes flying
over it, at which John was shooting, while Michael, who
was very small, had a flamingo with fº. flying over it.”
How well J. M. BARRIE understands the magic of words. And
how well he understands what is in a child's mind—“Caves
through which a river runs, and gnomes who are mostly
tailors, and a hut fast going to decay.” Ah, even now
that we are grown up, how magically these things sound
through a London fog. Peter and Wendy (HopDER AND
Stoughton) is not merely the play of Peter Pan with
“observed he ” and “remarked she "stuck in all through
to make it look like a book; it is packed with island lore
that is new to us. We learn for the first time now how
the lost boys tell the time: they find the crocodile and
listen outside him until the clock strikes. When Peter
escaped in the Never bird's nest, having first carefully put
the eggs in Starkey's hat, we did not foresee that this
would set the fashion among really smart birds, all future
nests being built in the conical shape with a circular brim
on which the young chicks take an airing. Now, too, the
*
methods of Indian warfare are explained to us fully; how
at night they imitate the lonely call of the coyote—doing
it, in fact, “even better than the coyotes, who are not very
good at it.” Of the terrible Hook we learn a great deal that
we had only guessed before. He had been at a famous pub-
lic school, and even now the revelation of his true name
would set the country in a blaze. In his last moments
his thoughts flew back to his happy days at school,
when “his shoes were right and his waistcoat was
right and his tie was right and his socks were right.”
He went content to the crocodile; for ere his last jump
overboard he had stood long enough on the bulwarks
to give Peter an opportunity of helping him over with a
foot, and Peter had availed himself of that opportunity.
Now that was distinctly “bad form "-and so Hook had
the laugh of poor Peter after all. Peter had never been to
the great public school. . . . Hundreds of thousands will be
grateful to Mr. BARRIE for this book. It is the whole play,
and yet so much more than the play; and yet again, you
might read it and think that there had never been a play.
So it will appeal both to the annual pilgrims and to the
others. My own feelings after reading it can best be
given in Michael's words: “I’m glad of "Mr. BARRIE.

Under Western Eyes (METHUEN) is as remarkable as any
work by Mr. Joseph CoNRAD must needs be; but at the
same time my impression of it, after turning the final
page, is that as a story it is not without some unnecessary
and irritating tricks of style, which may wear the
patience of a reader who is less than a disciple. In
the first place, the plan of telling it partly in the first
person and partly indirectly is made more confusing by the
fact that the end of the tale is reached before the middle.
Thus, after Razumov's betrayal of the bomb-thrower
Haldin, you have to take on faith his own appearance
body else's.) He expects of men and gods that they should
bow to his fiat, and makes furious protest against their
behaviour when they fail to comply with the schemes of
his personal vanity. Lothmar is a creation of which Mr.
and Mrs. CASTLE may be justifiably proud ; and the romance
which he dominates must, for freshness of theme, breadth
of treatment and sincerity of detail, rank among the best
achievements of this accomplished couple. I say so with
the greater pleasure because I thought that their last
novel, Panther's Cub, was below their standard of ex-
cellence. Perhaps they were just working off some of the
as an exiled revolutionary
and the comrade of Haldin's
sister long before you are
permitted to learn the se-
quence of events which led
to this result. On the out-
side of the cover the pub-
lishers say that this novel
reminds them of the work
of Torge.NEv. Perhaps,
apart from its Russian
milieu, this is because Mr.
CoNRAD has written it in
a rather broken and uneasy
style which suggests adap-
tation from some foreign
language. Whether this
was deliberate or not, I
regretted it as tending to
mar the effect of what is an
unusually strong and mov-
ing study of (to quote the
author) the “sustained psy-
chology of a mood.” The

escape from the tragedy of
her stage career into the
shelter of an existence
scarcely less tragic in its
isolation, offer too glaring
a contrast to the seduction
of hero-worship in the
world of Art. And if the
authors had shown him as

THE BITTER PLAINT OF THE ELEPHANT.
[It is understood that horses will be substituted for elephants in
the State Entry that opens the coming Durbar celebrations. The writer
of these lines, in deference to the judgment of authority, refrains from
expressing his own opinion on this change, and merely attempts to voice
the inarticulate views of the supplanted pachyderm.]
WE wish to know what we have done,
What wrong unwittingly have wrought
(At present I can think of none,
Whether in deed or word or thought)
That we whose royal functions trace
Their rise to prehistoric sources
Should sacrific our pride of place
To things like horses.
What was the feature, Sir, that most
Embellished CURzoN's great Durbar,
Gave tone to our Imperial boast
And staggered trippers from afar 2
What made the stranger cry, “Gee-whiz
That's bully; we can't claim to beat your
Circus out West ?”—the answer is:
|We were that feature.
In panoply of gold brocade
With frescoes, in the best of taste,
On trunk and pensive brow displayed,
Along the pageant's lines we paced;
Rolling serenely like a sea
That bears a fleet of treasure-galleys,
We scorned the tricks that seem to me
More fit for ballets.
Suavely, in single file, we swung
Beneath the howdah's gemmy hood,
Aware that India's future hung
On our behaviour, bad or good;
We might with ease (but we did not)
Have run amok and caused a melly,
Doing I dare not picture what
Damage to Delhi.
Yes, with a dignity of style
As monumental as the Taj,
We strode sedately, mile on mile,
Obedient to the British Raj;
You, Sir, were represented there,
And so will kindly bear me witness
What cool decorum marked our air,
What sense of fitness.
They call us pachyderms, and yet,
Trust me, our skins are not so tough
But what we feel it when we get
A horrid puncture in the buff;
And so with our interior parts:
When crossed in love, our vitals languish,
And to be humbled melts our hearts
With moral anguish.
Had the usurper been a beast
That once had roamed the jungle through—
A tiger, say, or else at least
Something suggestive of a Zoo-
We might have lost, with tearless eye,
Our claim to bear the EMPEROR's lieges,
But O, to be supplanted by
Domestic gee-gees'

THE DESCRIBER.
I MET him in a railway carriage on a Great Western
express. I had been reading some proofs, and I had
noticed that, as I pulled them out of my despatch case,
his eyes had gleamed as though recognising something
familiar. He was a pasty-faced, rotund little man with
very long dusty hair. There was a velvet collar to his coat
and a diamond ring to one of his fingers. His watch-chain
was heavy and golden. Evidently a prosperous little man.
After a good deal of fidgetting he addressed me: “An
author, Sir 2"
“Well, yes,” I said, “I do a little in that way: an occa-
sional article here and there, and—er—that sort of thing.”
“I see,” he said. “Now isn't it an extraordinary thing
you and me coming together like this? You might have
been a farmer, or a soap-maker, or a confectioner, or a
jeweller, but you're an author, and here we are, both of us
together.”
“Are you, may I ask——"
“Oh, yes, I'm an author all right. And I'll tell you
what,” he added, in a burst of enthusiasm, “I wouldn't
change authorship for anything else, not if you were to
make me a partner of Rothschild's. Not but what I
make my little bit of money too.” -
“Poetry?” I asked.
He laughed very scornfully. “Poetry ! not much. You
don't catch me chopping and changing words about to
make 'em fit into lines. It's a mug's game. And then
think of the rhymes, dawn—morn, home—bone, and all the
rest of them. No, I'm not a poet. KIPLING does all I
want in that line. When he's said a thing it's said and
there's an end of it. As long as he's about there's no
need for me to try poetry.”
“Well,” I said, “what is your line, then?”
“I'm a describer,” he said simply.
“A What 2 ” -
“A describer.” He dropped his voice and looked round
the compartment suspiciously, as though he feared that ||
somebody might he lurking under the cushions or in the
rack. “Of course,” he continued, “I don't want it known
everywhere.
asking for autographs and that sort of thing, like they did
to TENNyson, and I shouldn't care for that. But I don't
mind telling you on the q. t. I do the descriptive bits under
the photographs of the celebrities in the picture papers.
You see it's bound to be done with a snap or it won't go
down with the public ; and you've got to put a bit of
fancy-work into it, a sort of delicate touch here and there,
or the originals of the photographs won't order hundreds
of copies to be sent out to their friends all over the place.
Oh, don't you make any mistake about it, it takes a lot of
doing.”
I assured him I was making no mistake about it and was
ready to believe every word he said.
“I’m just coming back from my holiday,” he went on.
“Six days twice a year is all I get, and even that drops
all their circulations to nothing, so I have to come rushing
back with any new lines I've been able to think of. Now
this is a pretty little thing. I fancy it'll knock 'em.
Here's the photograph, you see. Girl in a big hat; two
rows of teeth; Pom dog in her lap. Doesn't sound much,
does it 2 But there 's inspiration in it if you take it the
right way. Listen: ‘Lady Iverna Blushrose, who is to
marry Captain Strakes to-morrow, is the second best

Ireland's most celebrated Earls. Known to her friends as

DEAR SIR,--I note with gratitude the humane decision
of the North Stafford Railway to abolish second-class

second-class travelling on this Company's line, and I trust
that so progressive a policy will soon be extended to the
other classes. As further innovations likely to stimulate
public patronage of their lines I venture to urge on railway
companies:—
(1) The throwing open of refreshment rooms and
buffets twice a week, free of cost.
(2) “Recognition ” of the claims of passengers to tea-
baskets, lunch-hampers, gratis.
(3) Issue of free magazines at the bookstalls to all
bond-fide travellers.
(4) “Right to strike" ticket-collectors, whenever a
passenger is so inclined.
(5) Return tickets at half single rates.
Trusting that you, Sir, will have the courage to make a
firm stand and inaugurate a Press campaign in your valued
columns on these broad lines,
I am, Yours hopefully,

THE BITTEN BITES.
A FAMoUs lady novelist who shall
for once be nameless has hit upon
what cannot but be considered a very
ingenious and effective way of getting
even with certain papers that have
expressed not too high an opinion of
her work; Punch, we regret to say,
among them. At the beginning of the
new edition of her latest novel, where it
is customary to place extracts from the
favourable notices which herother books
have received from the Press, the author
has instead placed notices by herself of
a few of the more influential journals.
Mr. Punch, who has been favoured with
an advance view of these morceau.r,
would hesitate to print such very
candid and hostile censures were he
not a naturalist, and as such pro-
foundly interested in watching a worm
having one good turn after another,
Moreover he himself comes under the
lady's lash.
“A copy of The Daily Telegraph,
published this day, lies before us. The
paper is damp, the ink darkens the
hands. The type is sometimes pain-
fully small and advertisements occupy
a ridiculously large proportion of the
reading matter. For the rest, it is
verbose and indiscriminating in its use
of detail, and has the vice of considering
everything that has happened of equal
importance. A little study of the
much-cried-up contes of GUY DE MAU-
PAssant would do it good.”
“Among the most recent publica-
tions is The Daily Chronicle. We
have read this work from cover to
cover without edification. It is true
that the price is low, but we are not
persuaded that that is any real excuse.
The book reviews might be in better
hands; the headings are in gross taste,
as when the account of a prisoner who
committed suicide is entitled, ‘Cheated
the Gallows'; and the paragraphs under
‘The Office Window' have a jauntiness
that affects the sensitive reader like
loud check trousers.”
“A laborious study of The Spectator,
a periodical issued from Wellington
Street, convinces us that weekly jour-
nalism in England is in a parlous state.
Kindness to animals is all very well,
but to be maudlin about them for
pages week after week strikes us as an
insult to human intelligence. We notice
also that a large portion of the corres-
pondence columns is merely a vehicle
for advertising the editor's rectitude.
And who, we should like to be told, is
M. BERGsoN to have so much space
given to him 2 Since when was it

spread revolt, among our more serious sisters,
against the reckless extravagance of the last
two years.”—Fashion Notes.

necessary to go to France for spiritual
thinkers? Are there none here 2"
“A paper called The Nation has
been sent for review. We suggest that
Stag-Nation would be a better title.
A more cantankerous, dismal sixpenny-
worth we never perused.”
“If we might be allowed to make a
suggestion it is that The Morning 1°ost
should spell the first word of its name
with a u. Anything more funereally
dismal than the tone of its leading
articles it would be impossible to
conceive. We always thought that
this journal gave an exhaustive and
impartial account of the doings of
the aristocracy, but to judge from
recent issues there are only two peers
in Great Britain, Lord HALsbury and
Lord WILLough BY DE BROKE.” .
“After carefully perusing every page
of The Times, which reaches us this
morning, including two dreary supple-
ments, we laid it aside in annoyance
that any one could have the effrontery
to demand the sum of threepence for
it. For there is not a joke in the
whole swollen production; not one
gleam of humour. We admit that one
or two announcements in the death
column interested us, and there was an
article, not badly done, on the recent
gale; but we cannot conceal our
disappointment with this expensive
miscellany as a whole.”
“If The Times is dear at threepence
as reading matter, what shall we say
of Punch, which has not the same
excuse of generously providing material
for lighting fires? This paper is called
the leading comic, but, so far as we can
observe, its only humour consists in the
fact that it keeps on coming out every
week, and charges threepence every
time.” [The rest of this notice of “Punch "
is not fit to print—not here, anyhow.}

“Good morning, Sir," he replied; “you

responded that that was the case.
“Have you seen much service abroad,
Sir 2" he continued. “Oh, a fair
amount, Sir,” I answered. “I went
out to Bermuda ten years ago, then
on to Ceylon, and have been for the
last five years with a Heavy Battery in
India.” “I’ve seen a bit of foreign
service myself, Sir," said the Colonel.
“It must be quite twelve years ago
since I went to Halifax.” I was not
surprised to hear this, as one can
seldom escape going abroad when one
reaches the senior ranks.
“I think you will like this place, Sir,”
he went on. “You have a splendid
battery, a fine lot of men, good at sport,
and 80 per cent. 1st class shots.” I
replied that I was delighted to hear
it; and then an idea struck me. Could
the Colonel be taking me for some one
else, owing to my baldness and other
indications of approaching senility? I
must put him right at once. -
“You are calling ma Sir, Sir, and
am still only a subaltern.” “Well, I'm

THE LITERARY ART.
MARGERY has a passion for writing
just now. I can see nothing in it
myself, but if people will write I
suppose you can't stop them.
“Will you just lend me your pencil”
she asked.
“Remind me to give you a hundred
pencils some time,” I said as I took it
out, “and then you'll always have
one. You simply eat pencils.”
“Oo, I gave it you back last time.”
“Only just. You inveigle me down
here x -
“What do I do 2 ”
“I’m not going to say that again
for anybody.”
“Well, may I have the pencil 2"
I gave her the pencil and a sheet of
paper, and settled her in a chair.
“B-a-b-y,” said Margery to herself,
planning out her weekly article for
the Reviews. “B-a-b-y, baby.” She
squared her elbows and began to
write . . .
“There!” she said, after five minutes'
composition.
The manuscript was brought over to
the critic, and the author stood proudly
by to point out subtleties that might
have been overlooked at a first reading.
“B-a-b-y,” explained the author.
“Baby.” -
“Yes, that's very good; very neatly
expressed. ‘Baby'—I like that.”
“Shall I write some more?” said
Margery eagerly.
“Yes, do write some more. This is
good, but it's not long enough.”
The author retired again, and in five
minutes produced this:–
A B Y
“That’s “baby,'” explained Margery.
“Yes, I like that baby better than
the other one. It's more spread out.
And it's bigger—it's one of the biggest
babies I've seen.”
“Shall I write some more ?”
“Don’t you write anything else
ever ?”
“I like writing “baby,’” said Mar-
gery carelessly. “B-a-b-y.”
“Yes, but you can't do much with
just that one word. Suppose you
wanted to write to a man at a shop—
‘Dear Sir, You never sent me my
boots. Please send them at once as I
want to go out this afternoon. I am,
yours faithfully, Margery –it would
be no good simply putting 'B-a-b-y,’
because he wouldn't know what you
meant.”
“Well,
putting 2"
“Ah, that 's the whole art of writing
—to know what it would be any
good putting. You want to learn lots
and lots of new words, so as to be
what would it be good
ready. Now here's a jolly little one
that you ought to meet.” I took the
pencil and wrote G O T. “Got.
G-o-t, got.”
Margery, her elbows on my knee
and her chin resting on her hands,
studied the position.
“Yes, that 's old “got,’” she said.
“He’s always coming in. When you
want to say ‘I’ve got a bad pain, so I
can't accept your kind invitation;' or
when you want to say, ‘Excuse more,
as I've got to go to bed now ; or quite
simply, ‘You’ve got my pencil.’”
“G-o-t, got,” said Margery. “G-o-t,
got. G-o-t, got.”
“With appropriate action it makes
a very nice recitation.”
“Is that a ‘g '2" said Margery, busy
with the pencil, which she had snatched
from me.
“The gentleman with the tail. You
haven't made his tail quite long enough
. . . That's better.”
Margery retired to her study charged
with an entirely new inspiration, and
wrote her second manifesto. It was
this:—
G O T.
“Got,” she pointed out.
I inspected it carefully. Coming
fresh to the idea Margery had treated
it more spontaneously than the other.
But it was distinctly a “got.” One of
the gots. - -
“Have you any more words?” she
asked, holding tight to the pencil.
“You’ve about exhausted me, Mar-
gery.”
“What was that one you said just
now 2 The one you said you wouldn't
say again 2" - -
“Oh, you mean ‘inveigle'?” I said,
pronouncing it differently this time.
“Yes; write that for me.”
“It hardly ever comes in. Only when
you are writing to your solicitor.”
“What's ‘Solicitor’?”
“He 's the gentleman who takes the
money. He's always coming in.”
“Then write “solicitor.’”
I took the pencil (it was my turn for
it) and wrote solicitor. Then I read
it out slowly to Margery, spelt it to her
three times very carefully, and wrote
solicitor again. Then I said it
thoughtfully to myself half-a-dozen
times—“Solicitor.” Then I looked at
it wonderingly.
“I am not sure now,” I said, “that
there is such a word.”
“Why?”
“I thought there was when I began,
but now I don't think there can be.
“Solicitor’—it seems so silly.”
“Let me write it,” said Margery,
eagerly taking the paper and pencil,
“and see if it looks silly.”
She retired, and—as well as she
could for her excitement—copied the
word down underneath. The combined
effort then read as follows:–
SoLICITOR
SoLIcitor
SolotoR
“Yes, you've done it a lot of good,”
I said. “You’ve taken some of the
creases out. I like that much better.”
“Do you think there is such a word
now 2 ”
“I’m beginning to feel more easy
about it. I'm not certain, but I hope.”
“So do I,” said Margery. With the
pencil in one hand and the various
scraps of paper in the other, she
climbed on to the writing desk and
gave herself up to literature. . . .
And it seems to me that she is well
equipped for the task. For besides
having my pencil still (of which I say
nothing for the moment) she has now
three separate themes upon which to
ring the changes—a range wide enough
for any writer. These are, “Baby got
solicitor” (supposing that there is such
a word), “Solicitor got baby,” and
“Got baby solicitor.” Indeed, there
are really four themes here, for the
last one can have two interpretations.
It might mean that you had obtained
an ordinary solicitor for Baby or it
might mean that you had got a
specially small one for yourself. It
lacks, therefore, the lucidity of the best
authors, but in a woman writer this
may be forgiven. A. A. M.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FroM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Tuesday, 31 Oct.—
Since it last met the House is poorer by
the loss of two Members. For many
years JAMEs of HEREFoRD seemed as
if he were benefitting by the acquisi-
tion of the secret of the elixir of life.
Handsome, debonair, witty, he was
accustomed through dull sittings to
flit about the Chamber like a butterfly,
alighting for a moment by one or other
of many friends and brightly chatting.
It was characteristic of his urbanity
and absence of prejudice that he found
his friends in both political camps.
No earthquake submerging a Party to
which it was once his pride to belong
interfered with his almost lifelong
friendship with Sir WILLIAM HARcourt.
That for conscience' sake, at a criti-
cal turn in his career, he refused the
coveted prize of the Woolsack is a
matter of common knowledge. It is
less generally known how constantly
he fulfilled in political life the function
of amicus curiae. Differences of opinion
arising between personal friends or
sections of Party were frequently re-
ferred to him. His proposed terms
of settlement were rarely challenged.
This good work was carried out on a
broader scale when, usually at the
request of the working men, he under-
took arbitration upon Labour questions.
Within the last twelve months he began
to show the effect of growing years, a
large proportion devoted to strenuous
labour. Almost to the last coming upon
a friend he pulled himself together,
talking with much of his old vivacity
and pointed wit.
Lord ONSLow, much his junior,
seemed, a year ago, to have the promise
of equally long life. Brisk, almost
bustling in manner, he went about
his daily work with contagious light-
heartedness. His strong common
sense, fair-mindedness and business
capacity won for him a high place
in the estimation of his peers. This
was testified to when, six years ago,
he was by acclamation elected Lord
Chairman of Committees. He had
great sympathy with work, not the
least arduous part carried out in his
private room during portions of the day
when the House was sitting. Towards
the end of the Summer Session he
wrote a cheery letter to an old friend
reporting marked improvement in his
health, and speaking hopefully of the
prospects of his presently being re-
moved from Clandon to his son's
house at Hampstead. It was there he
died.

has joined the HALSBURY Club, tells me
of a pretty little incident that marked
ear isst weeks of its captivating career.
At special meeting of Club held last
night, the noble President was the re-
cipient of a handsome weapon, bearing
on the silver plate the inscription “The
Halsbury Club." ColoSELCARscN, K.C.,
placed at disposal of the sub-committee
who arranged the presentation his
almost unique collection of shillelaghs.
Each one has seen service on one side
or other of the national cause in
Ireland. Owing to habit of shift-
ing of politics and persons, with which
TIM HEALY and WILLIAM O'Briex are
familiar, several have at various stages
of the conflict been alternately used on
both sides. From this interesting
store a club has been fashioned which
leaves nothing to be desired either in
respect of elegance or utility.
In addition to name of the Halsbury
Club the silver plate carries an inspiring
couplet of verse. Seems to have been
some difficulty in this matter. What
was naturally desired was a personal
reference to the prowess of the Presi-
dent, with some indication of the story
of recent events which have brought
him so splendidly to the fore. DUKE
of North UMBERLAND, who naturally is
acquainted with the Percy Reliques,
suggested the lines from Chery Chase:
“For when his leg s were smitten off
He ſought upon his stumpes."
As the stalwart descendant of
Border Earls pointed out, these lines
to the seeing eye picturesquely indicate
the situation. Beaten in the Lords
on Veto question, HALSBURY, from
lowered altitude, resumed the fight
under flag of the Club.
Whilst admitting all this, MILNER,
in his pitilessly logical fashion, pointed
out the effect on the mind of the
classical illustration.
“If,” he said, “we (in a parlia-
mentary sense, of course) cut off the
legs of our noble friend, where is what
is left of him, so to speak 2 "
“Exactly,” said GEoRGE WYNDHAM.
“If it were WINTERTON now it would
be different. Shortening by a lineal foot
would still leave him of average height.”
Lord WINTERTON said he had not
been very we'l lately (murmurs of
sympathy). If experiments were to be
tried there was his gallant friend,
CARson, K.C., who was within an incli
or so of his (WINTERTON's) height.
SELBorn E, who has hereditary poetic
instinct, suggested as an alternative
the lines from WALTER Scott's “Coro-
nach": -
“Fleet foot on the correi,
Sage counsel in cumber.”
This brought up WILLou GHBY ºn. DUKE
I3RoKE.
“I don't know what a correi is,”
he said, “but will bet odds that the

THE ORDEAL BY FIREWORKS.
ONE sees, with not unnatural fears,
How plain in other men appears
The ravage of advancing years.
Thus, in the case of What's-his-name,
One has occasion to exclaim
At his absurdly bulky frame.
And one remarks on So-and-So's
Increasing fondness for repose,
Or notes his calmer taste in hose.
But with oneself it's hard to spot
The dreaded symptoms, is it not ?
One often is deceived a lot. ,
One looks into the mirror, say,
To find one's hair is no more gray,
So it appears, than yesterday;
Or, maybe, casting off all cares,
One frolics through the hall and tears
With wild abandon up the stairs;
And in such moments, highly-strung,
One murmurs with exultant tongue
“Hooray! Hooray! I still am young!"
Sush tests are most unsound, and so
I publish, free of charge, below
The only certain one I know.
If Rockets roaring through the sky
In scorn of GUIDO FAw KEs (or GUY)
Provoke no sparkle in his eye,
If Wheels and Crackers ſail to thrill,
If Squibs and Bombs fall flatter still,
And Roman Candles leave him chill,
That man thereby is plainly told
To bow his head and say “Behold !
I know that I am growing old !”

this narrowing of the franchise are we to

deserves high praise. It is as enlivening as

All the more credit to him for taking
advantage of these rare occasions.

TOBACCO v. OSCUILATION.
At a meeting held in Manchester a
few days ago, a campaign against the
spread of tobacco-smoking was ad-
vocated, a suggestion being put forward
that no one who smoked should be
allowed to kiss. If this advice is
followed, it will be rather trying for
good and earnest young men, in
these days when the modern girl is
growing more and more addicted to
her cigarette. Thus:—
To LUCASTA, ON GoING INTO THE
FRESH AIR.
Tell me not, Sweete, I am unkinde
That from the snuggerie
Of thy chaste smoakinge-roome I finde
That I must straightway flee.
To light a weede I did essay
But once, when I was rawe;
I had not nypped the ende away
And soe it would not drawe.
Since them, Cigarres I have forsworn,
Nor doe I love to licke
A Pipe, and fierie Snuffe I scorn—
In sooth, they make me sicke.
So a new mistresse now I chase
If one there can be seene
Whose lippes doe not display a trace
Of pungent nicotine.
For O my queasinesse is such
As sends me through the door;
Had I not loved fresh aire so much,
I could have loved thee more.
A CALENDAR CURIOSITY.
IT was next Saturday, the second
Saturday of November. The ballcock
had gone wrong again, and Montague,
after spending a grimy hour in the
'cistern loft (while Millicent mopped up
the flood below in the hope of saving
the ceilings), sat down to write a
stinger to the plumber. Hardly, how-
ever, had he seized his pen with savage
enthusiasm, when he threw back his
head, exclaiming—
“Heavens above us!”
“Is it coming through after all?”
cried Millicent, who was sitting on the
hearthrug to dry. -
“Not that I can see,” said Montague,
“but have you noticed anything peculiar
about to-day, as a day ?”
“No,” replied Millicent, wearily,
“only that I'm a bit fed up with it.”
“Fed up with it, indeed! Why, my
good woman, to-day is an eccentric,
almost unprecedented phenomenon.
Are you conscious of anything extra-
ordinary in the air 2"
“No,” she replied thoughtfully,
“except perhaps it's been a bit damp
for a start.”

“No, no l’’ said Montague, “can't
you detect anything unusual about the
passing hours?”
“Is it a catch 2" inquired Millicent
guardedly.
“A catch—no To-day is unique;
a Phoenix, a chimera, a wonder, a
prodigy among days. Coronations,
cataclysms, battles, assassinations and
earthquakes may make deep records
on the surface of the years, but not so
deep as this day. Only genuine cen-
tenarians have seen its like, and merely
a handful of babes will assist at its
recurrence. My dear Millicent, the
twenty-four hours through which we
are now passing constitute such an
extraordinary occasion that I really
think we must have a bottle of
champagne for dinner.”
“By all manner of means,” assented
Millicent, suddenly brisking up, “now
if you like. I'm quite convinced the
occasion is worthy, whatever it may
be, and, if you mean it is unique
because of what happened upstairs, all
I can say is, I'm glad to hear it.”
“No,” said Montague, “I’m alluding
to a more momentous matter than the
ballcock business, though I admit it
was dating my letter to that rascally
plumber made me think of it. Now
do use your head for once. What is
the date 2 ”
“Oh, don't ask me,” Millicent pro-
tested. “You know I never worry
about that sort of thing. You guess' "
“Eleven, eleven, eleven,” replied
Montague. -

she said.

O OYSTERs, are ye swarming in,
Remembering ancient quarrels,
Now that a man of medicine
Is crowned with civic laurels?
For oft you've had but little thanks
And many a hard word from us,
And chiefly from those learned ranks
Adornel by brave Sir Thomas;
They've blamed you in ungrateful terms
For “good" enteric cases,
They've seen us send you drainy germs,
Then flung them in your faces.
So, have ye, lying in your beds,
Or roused perhaps to sitting,
Conceived some scheme within your
heads
Dramatically fitting? .
Wagging your beards, maybe you've
sworn
To mark my lord's election
By steady efforts, night and morn,
To reach a plump perfection;
That when our doctor sits to dine,
His aldermen around him,
Your native worth so clear may shine,
Its brightness shall confound him.
Maligned, you curb your righteous ire
In moral triumph o'er them,
You heap their heads with coals of fire,
And cast your pearls before them.

THE CO-OPERATORS.
I woke up suddenly in the middle
of the night, in a cold perspiration.
Many of us have done that before,
especially when we happened to be
the heroes of melodramatic novels, and
have always known instinctively that
something was wrong. It is the cold
perspirat on that puts us on to it.
Perspiration alone would mean that
we had too many clothes on the bed;
cold alone, that we had not enough.
But, when you get the two combined,
a more subtle explanation is called for.
So I lay awake and listened. I could
hear the creaking of the stairs and
could detect sounds of windows being
forced open, locks being filed, bolts
being stealthily withdrawn, and silver
goods being abstracted from safes, but
I could hear nothing out of the common,
nor had reason to suppose that there
were more than the customary number
of burglars and murderers below stairs.
“Same old sounds and same old
ghosts,” I said to myself; “it must be
something on my mind.”
A little flattered to discover that I
had a mind, I went into the matter
carefully, but came to no conclusion.
There was nothing for it but to go back
to sleep, so “One, two, three, four,
five,” I said out loud, to attain that
object, “six, seven, eight . . . Ah!
that is it, of course. It is Aspodestera's
birthday on the eighth and to-morrow
is the seventh. I shall have to buy
that present to-morrow. Yes,” I said
to myself, before we parted company
for the rest of the night, “I was quite
right to perspire coldly.”
Aspodestera does not mind reading
books, but resolutely refuses to own
them, and, outside books, there is no
form of present with which I can grap-
ple. When we are married I shall
give her pipes for her birthday presents;
but when one is only engaged one has
to be altruistic in these matters. The
only presents that please her are things
to wear, and it is quite certain that she
will not wear them unless they do
please her. It is very important that
Aspodestera should be pleased.
: I put the matter to Thompson at
breakfast, who got into conversation
with Draycott during the morning, and
rang me up at noon to tell me that the
brother of the man who works with
Draycott had been in the same difficulty
and had found that there was a shop
in Oxford Street, known as Peter Dick-
inson's. So I went there at once, and
was greeted by an engaging gentleman
in a frock coat and a number of smiles.
“Mornin', Peter,” said I; “I am
quite sure that I don't know what I
want, but,” I added, catching sight
of a competent person behind the
counter, “I’ve no doubt your daughter
does."
Peter explained that the young
person was not his daughter, but it
was obvious from the contempt with
which they treated each other before
strangers that they were relations of
some sort. Peter, however, was gone
before I could question him further.
“Show me some things, please,” I
said to the lady.
She showed me a lot of things, but
I am afraid I did not understand any
of them and always said the wrong
word about them. Moreover, I didn't
much care for them; they did not
appear to me to be strong enough, and
one never seemed to be offered good
weight for one's money. The only
strictly between you and me.
I said, to explain what the trouble was,
“I am engaged.”
“All right,” she replied, being a little
riled by this time, “you needn't take
on about it. I'm engaged too.”
I held my hand out to her across the
table. “Shake,” I said; “that 's the
best bit of news I've heard for many a
long day. In the first place it lends
an air of solemnity and respectability
to the situation, and in the second it
helps us out of it. Does Peter ever
have birthdays?"
“Who's Peter?” she asked, and, to
satisfy her, I pretended that I didn't
know that Peter was her man.
“Do you have difficulty in getting
his birthday presents 2 " . .
This time she held out her hand.
“Shake again,” she murmured; “you
and I are fellow-sufferers.” We shook
again. - - .
“We need not shake a third time,”
said I, “but I think we might perhaps
trust each other. What price do you
generally run to on those occasions?”
“Seven-and-six,” she confessed, “if
you must know.”
“Good. Next time Peter—I mean
he—has a birthday, send a postal order
for that amount to Mr. Hampton, Pipe
Manufacturer, Petty Cury, Cambridge,
and tell him to send a straight-grain
briar ‘as supplied by you to Mr. Lane.'
I am Mr. Lane, and he and I may be
pretty useless in a ladies' outfitting
shop, but we do know a good pipe when
we see it. Not at all,” I said, as
she began to thank me. “And now for
the quid pro quo,” I added, producing
a sovereign.
She laughed pleasantly, partly be-
cause she saw me laughing and knew
there was an old jest somewhere and
partly to conceal her lack of classical
education.
“Now select me something that the
future Mrs. Lane cannot help liking
and wrap it up in a nice parcel. You
need not trouble to show it to me."
There was some mention of the
word “Ninon,” but whether in refer-
ence to the lady or the goods I could
not say. Beyond that I have no idea
what was the present I sent to Aspo-
destera, nor why it gave so much
satisfaction. But, above all, I beg of

When I had finished writing it my
wife asked me if I were going to the
office that morning, a question rendered
ridiculous by my regular habits of the
past fifteen years. I told her so.
“I’m sorry, Albert,” she said, “but
I thought, instead of earning fifty
pounds in spare time, we might manage
a couple of hundred in whole time.”
“Look here, Belinda,” said I, “apart
from the self-evident folly of your
remark (for we cannot possibly get the
S. C. Album until the day after to-
morrow), it shows that you evidently
don't think we shall make anything
out of these Eldorado people.”
“Do you ?” she queried.
“Certainly,” I replied coldly.
“Well, darling, I'm sorry, and I do
believe we shall if you say so.”
“I’m glad of that,” said I, some-
what mollified; “but I don't like your
invariably hostile attitude to adver-
tisements. And you have a reprehen-
sible distrust of anything with which
you are not personally familiar. It-
it isn't quite womanly.”
“N-no, Albert.”
“I don't mean to say that I want to
see you foolishly credulous, ready to
accept anything as genuine that sounds
well. But I do like a woman to be
confiding, unsuspicious.”
“Ye-es, of course it is nice. I'm
glad we're going to get the S. C.
cards; and, Albert, darling—-”
“Yes, love,” said I, complacently.
“Could you let me have my first
week's three pound ten in advance?”
THE OBJECT-LESSON.
FLUKEs -
Well, the thing came to such a pass
when Hughes was here the other
night that I went straight off to the
cabinet-maker in the morning.
“Look here,” I said, “do you think
you could make me a scoring-board
for billiards 2 ”
“Nothing easier,” he answered.
That was absurd, of course, because
any one without thinking could name
a hundred easier things to make ; but
it showed that he had a willing heart.
“It must be ready by next Tuesday
week,” I said, “because I have a
friend" (friend is good) “coming to
p'ay me. He comes every other Tues-
day.”
“Is the old one broken, then?” he
asked.
“Broken " I replied. “No, al-
though it's a wonder it isn't, with the
appalling luck the man has, No, it's
not broken. The trouble is, it doesn't
say enough. The time has come for a
scoring-board in a gentleman's billiard-

room to be something more than astroke. My ball just touched it on the
scoring-board: it has got to be a critic,
too, a censor, an instructor in decency.”
The cabinet-maker whistled. “Has
it 2" he said. “Lumme! what price
the scoring - board at the “King's
Arms' then, when we play snooker
and old Ricketts loses his 'air 2" He
laughed. “But just explain, Sir.”
So I explained. I took out of my
pocket the design I had already made;
and we worked it out together. First
of all we took the ordinary row of
figures—1 to 20–and the hundreds, for
spot and plain. “Under these,” I said,
“I want a series of similar rows for
both spot and plain—the first to be
entitled “Flukes,' where we will mark
everything that either player obtains
by undue luck.” -
“Yes,” said the cabinet-maker; “but
how are you going to decide what's
luck and what isn't 2"
“There's never any doubt,” I replied,
“in the case of the man I'm having
this little object-lesson prepared for.
The next row,” I said, “shall be en-
titled “Good strokes, and the third,
“Really good strokes.’”
“There'll be some argufying there,"
said the cabinet-maker.
“Perhaps,” I replied; “but we shall
manage it somehow. After this,” I
said, “I want a final row to be entitled
“Rotten.’”
“More argufying over that,” said the
cabinet-maker.
“Now in the game as I intend it
shall be played in my house,” I con-
tinued, “everything shall be recorded,
as now, on the top rows; while the
strokes shall also receive their points
under the classification below. Then
at the end of the game, when the 100
has been reached, deductions for flukes
and rotten strokes and additions for
strokes of particular merit, will be
made; and it is exceedingly likely,” I
added, “ that the fable of the hare and
the tortoise will be exemplified and the
apparent loser really be the winner.
Thus justice will be done and true
ability rewarded.”
“M'yes,” said the cabinet - maker,
thinking no doubt of the bad temper of
the King's Arms' crowd.
The new board arrived punctually on
the Tuesday afternoon, and in the
evening Hughes came round for our
regular game. I drew his attention to
the board and explained its purpose.
“Very ingenious and interesting,”
he said. “It's your turn to begin.”
“Right,” I said, addressing myself
to my ball. “I'm tired of giving a
miss; I'll bring the balls back into
baulk.”
Taking my usual careful aim for a
half-ball shot at the red, I made the
right side and cut it into the top left-
hand pocket, while my own ball return-
ing from the top cushion ran straight
as a train into the right-hand bottom
pocket.
After a while Hughes spoke. “I
suppose you didn't burn the old scoring
board when you had this one made 2"
he inquired.
There is something peculiarly dis-
gusting about a confirmed fluker's
magnanimity.
THE EPIDEMIC.
A STRIKE for increased wages and
shorter hours broke out yesterday
among the Private Members employed
at Westminster, and at the time of
writing no prospect of settlement
between the men and the Government
is apparent. The demands include
overtime for all-night sittings and the
abolition of Autumn sessions. The
attitude of the public towards the re-
volting wage-earners is one of apathy.
Later.—A deputation waited on
the PRIME MINISTER to-day with the
minimum demands of the men. The
Government's reply was a firm refusal
of recognition.
A number of defeated Candidates
paraded Whitehall to-night demanding
the right to work. They were quickly
dispersed.
Several speakers, who, before the
strike, had been observed in the libraries
of the National Liberal and the Consti-
tutional, working up facts, decided to-
night that they could not endure to
remain out with their speeches un-
delivered, and attempted to re-enter t
House. Successfully intimidated, on
the lower jaw, by peaceful picketers,
they were induced to destroy the notes
of their speeches and to return.
Speaking at Torquay last night, the
HoME SECRETARY stated that the Gov-
ernment was determined to carry on
the business of the country and would
make arrangements enabling it to
enrol members of debating societies,
suburban “parliaments,” etc., in order
to provide the respective front benches
with suitable supporters. The new
Volunteer Constables (including many
strikers) would, if necessary, be called
out to enforce these arrangements.
Only in the last resort would the mili-
tary be employed.
Some light upon the matter of the
further intentions of the Government
is perhaps cast by the fact that the
PRIME MINISTER and the LEADER of
THE OPPosition have each placed an
order for 200 gramophones capable of
reproducing loud and prolonged cheers.
No settlement has yet taken place.
In order to excite public sympathy
with their complaint about all-night
sittings, three Members who had pur-
posely refrained from going to bed for
two nights this morning paced slowly
up Whitehall, attracting a wide atten-
tion by their haggard appearance.
Latest.—A settlement was reached
quite suddenly this afternoon. By its
terms each Private Member will receive
ninepence an hour for all time worked
after suspension of Standing Orders,
this sum to be increased to one shilling
per hour during such time as the
Member cannot remain in the Lobby
and is compelled to hear speeches in
order to maintain a quorum.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE is no resisting Mr. MAURICE HEwleTT. Like a
gray, swirling river running underneath one of his own
many - turreted castles, he carries me away, catching
vainly at poor straws of criticism, as, for instance, whether
it is necessary to say certain things so plainly as he does
at times, and whether blind fiddlers really talked like that
in the “dim days when King Marimilian III. ruled over
Jadis.” And then the names' In The Song of Renny
(MACMILLAN) they are a listed tournament in themselves:
Germulf de Salas, Stephen of Havilot, Joyeul, Saber,
Marvilion, Campflors, the Countess of Gru. And Mr.
HEwleTT has all their history and all their heraldry at his
fingers' end, so that you blush for shame that you did not
know about them before. My principal complaint con-
cerning The Song of Renny is that the Red Earl of
Pikpointz, who had a playful habit of killing retainers
with a blow of his fist, and carried off one of the Rennys,
after murdering her kinsfolk, and married another at the
sword's point—that this nice fellow, who had got to be a
sort of favourite with me, in spite of his villainy, because
of his strength and his courage, was not provided with a
more sterling exit. I had hoped for a scene like the death
of Hereward the Wake, or a duel like that between John
Ridd and Carver Doome, but I was disappointed. The love
scenes, however, between Mabilla Renny, wife of the Red
Earl, and her tame poet, Lanceilhot Paulet, the Campflors
lutanist, are in Mr. HEWLETT's own unapproachable
manner, and it will not surprise anyone acquainted with
his works to hear that they escaped from the castle of
Speir, and wandered together for a night and a day in the
snow; nor that their love triumphed in the end. But it
may easily surprise anyone that this same Lanceilhot
Paulet should be called Cerbet on page 371, line 22.
Dormant, even though it is from the pen of E. NESBIT
and from the house of METHUEN, does not give satisfaction.
If heroes must practise the unusual profession of corpse-
reviving, they must either proceed in so plausible a manner
that they convince for the moment, or must achieve such
remarkable results that the impossibility is forgiven for the
sake of the moral or the laugh. When, after two hundred
and ten pages of palaver, Anthony Drelincourt brings his
Eugenia to life, he leaves his reader cold. He gives no
hint of his methods, and no engrossing issues or deductions
follow his miracle. The sub-plot of thwarted love might
have aroused sympathy but for the fact that Rose, the girl
who had been alive, all the time but was thrown over for
the resuscitated beauty, is one of those brusquely efficient
young persons whom authoresses wrongly suppose to be
the ideal of their sex, and men intent on falling in love
especially avoid. The youth and the joie de vivre and the
bohemianism of her and her friends were forced and unreal,
and one reads without regret of her being jilted even for a
lady who had been dead these fifty years. The mystery of
it all, though carefully sustained in the telling of the story,
cannot have been intended as an attraction to possible
readers, since it is deliberately given away in great par-
ticularity by a summary of the novel which appears on
its outside paper cover. Lastly, I have too genuine a
respect for the spontaneous and light-hearted genius of the
real E. NESBIT to urge in favour of this book what is
literally true, that great pains have obviously been taken
over it.

overdone the dose. However, I
suppose she knows what people
like; certainly the fact that the
publishers announce the book
as a companion story to Rebecca
of Sunnybrook Farm would seem
to show that it is expected to
meet a popular demand. I am
sorry, because the effect produced
upon me was that of real talent
debased. As for the story itself,
it is about a perfect mother, who,
being left a young widow with
several perfect children, retires to
economise in a kind of barley-
sugar cottage, whose landlord
declines to take any rent beyond
a tribute of wild flowers, and
eventually marries his son to the
eldest daughter. What aston-
ished me was that nobody mar-

that came later. I cannot help
thinking that, if rural life in
America is really like that, I
have been strangely misinformed.

He is less happy in a derived and
tentative manner of treating his
Minehead as if it were The Five
Towns; yet clearly he has studied
his portraits with sympathy, and
believes in their originals as hand-
some, wholesome folk, courageous
against the currents of evil in
a refreshingly old-fashioned way.
He gives you a theme of tragic
interest: a young fisherman mar-
ried to a dipsomaniac, with a ter-
tium quid in shape of the gentle,
second-sighted Mary Milroy,
friend to both and (saving her
loyalty) steadily growing more
than friend to Derreck, the
husband. She is a mystic and
a writer of honest, negligible
verses; a charming if somewhat
shadowy heroine. The story
moves with cross currents and
vexing storms to the haven of a
satisfactory ending. A compla-
cent “reader” has evidently
abetted the author in some odd
experiments in spelling, punctu-
ation and word-coinage.
The heroine, aged twelve, of
Pollyooly (MILLs AND Boon)

career with no parents, twenty-

this infant with the ponderous
name from drifting into the work-
house was her problem, and how
she solved it is most entertain-
-
heroes in plenty, before Peter,
who, in the moment of succeeding to a great estate, find
themselves confronted with the existence of an unsuspected
elder brother. And the letter-writer who falls dead in the
middle of the very sentence that would have explained all
has done so, to my certain knowledge, many times pre-
viously. But this is of no great consequence if the result is
sufficiently entertaining. And Peter and Jane certainly is
that. The early part, in which the characters just live about
in nice houses and talk pleasantly, showed, not for the first
time, that the author has a gift for natural comedy. Later,
when the action shifts into the Argentine and melodrama,
I simply couldn't put the book down till I had finished it.
Throughout its course you will find many excellent bits of
character-drawing. My favourite by a long way (and I
fancy Miss MACNAUGHTEN's also) was Canon Wrottesley, an
engaging poseur with a trick of dramatising himself to suit
his circumstances. There is one glaring improbability,
ingly told by Mr. EDGAR JEPson.
Children with angel faces—and Pollyooly was a “genuine
angel child”—are dangerous material for novelists to deal
with, but apart from her countenance and her scrupulous
honesty there was nothing genuinely angelic about
Pollyooly—whatever Mr. JEPsoN may say. Indeed some
of her contrivances to add to her £1 2s. and the ardour
with which she smacked the heads of rude boys convinced
me that she was born with her fair share of original sin. But
lest I should give too robust an impression of her character
I must in justice add that although she belaboured rude
boys she was quite ready to kiss a nice one when occasion
offered. Of Pollyooly's history I beg all child-lovers to read,
for although Mr. JEPson once or twice leans rather heavily
upon the arm of coincidence, he has never allowed his
fertile imagination really to go out of bounds. Numerous
other character-sketches, slight but clever, help to give
distinction to a delightful story.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NIBLICK CLUB.
I HAVE always contended that golf
would be an ideal game for middle age
if it were not for golfers. The only
possible arrangement, if you are to
have your game and at the same time
escape contact with this deplorable
type, is to have a house of your own
adjoining the tenth tee and so avoid the
atmosphere of the club-house. There
may still be two or more intolerable
people in front of you to keep you back,
and two or more in your rear to press
you forward, but apart from distant
exchanges of abuse there is no need to
hold any intercourse with your fellow-
members.
I am not, either congenitally or by
acquired taste, a misanthrope, yet the
moment I enter a golf club-house I
detest my brother man. So offensive
is the air of breeziness and brutal
health and general self-satisfaction
that radiates from the typical golfer.
You will, perhaps, challenge this
charge of self-satisfaction : you will
contend that the golfer never admits
that he has done himself justice;
always a conspiracy of evil chances
has ruined the fine score of which
he alleges himself to be capable. I
answer that this is the worst form of
self-satisfaction, because it has not the
excuse of actual achievement. In any
case I suffer an equal boredom whether
he tells me that he lay dead (would
that this were not a mere figure of
speech) at the seventh hole in two, or
that a mole-cast on the fourteenth
green robbed him of a “par ’’ four. I
don't want to know anything about
him or his game. I think I would
actually sooner listen to a hunting-
man's shop.
But even when a golfer is silent
about his game there is still the offence
of his aspect. For most other outdoor
games you need a figure suggestive of
strength or agility or courage or en-
durance. But for golf you can be any
shape you like, or even merely amor-
phous. So long as you have your
lower limbs under control and can wave
a stick there need be no limit to your
girth or flabbiness or senility.
Nor is there any established costume
for the game, now that the old red
coat, which at least took the eye like a
pillar-box, has been discarded, save on
rare commons where it is still retained
as a danger signal to nursemaids.
And even in the days of the red coat
there were, as now, the trouserists and
the knickerbockerites, and none could
say which were the more correct.
One would have thought that one's
opportunities of communion with this
strange medley of humanity were
already more than adequate. Yet there
lies before me at this moment the pro-
spectus of The Niblick Club, forwarded
with an invitation to me to join its
membership. I view with suspicion any
club that invites me to join it, except
under conditions of peculiar privilege
extended as a tribute to my personality;
but let that pass. The Niblick Club is
not an ordinary golf-club, it is in the
heart of the Metropolis and attached to
no links; it has been established for
the purpose of offering to golfers a
further scope for social intercourse.
I hope I have already shown with
sufficient clarity that I regard the
ordinary golf club-house as a necessary
evil. It shelters your weapons; it
provides a cuisine of a limited order;
it affords a convenient point for assig-
nations with those particular friends
(selected for their reticence) with whom
you propose to play; but you enter it
always at the risk of overhearing the
conversation of other golfers. But
why anyone should deliberately join
a club which exists for the express
design of throwing golfers together
without the chance of a game is an
enigma that leaves my imagination
hopelessly insolvent.
You will tell me that golf, like the
suffrage, is becoming so vulgarised (in
the beautiful sense) that to say that
Y| you are a golfer is scarce more than
to admit that you are a human being;
The Niblick Club might therefore, you
say, as well be called The Breathers'
Club. But think of its purpose. The
tie that binds together all those who
draw mortal breath might appeal to
one's common humanity; and shop-talk
at a Breathers' Club, unless overdone
with allusions to patent lung-expanders
and physical developers, would be in-
offensive. But The Niblick Club,
having for its avowed object the de-
velopment of social intercourse between
golfers, encourages the dreariest foible
of our universal brotherhood.
No, I shall not join The Niblick Club.

THE MARK OF THE EAST.
WHEN Gertrude sails for India
She bids her kin and kith
Inspect the bales of tropic veils,
The helmets made of pith :
The net to spread above her bed
Is viewed with anxious mien,
And eyes dilate to see the crate
Of camphor and quinine.
When Gertrude sails for India,
Her mother's feeling queer,
The Rector blows an anxious nose
And wipes away a tear:
Shall Ruth or Grace usurp the place
'Tis Gertrude's pride to hold
At Little-Budleigh-in-the-Mud-
cum-Worple-on-the-Wold 2
When Gertrude sails for India,
The local “Dorcas” sighs
For one whose zest last autumn dress'd
A score of pagan thighs;
In stricken tones a curate drones
The lessons for the day,
Nor dares to view his Rector's pew
For fear of giving way.
When Gertrude comes from India,
She 's Indian to the core,
Her gown and hair, her manners bear
The stamp of Barrackpore;
She sits and prates of maiden plates,
Of revels at the “Gym,”
Of leading parts and doubled hearts,
The regiment and him.
When Gertrude comes from India,
She's found an Eastern twang,
And bores her friends with odds and
ends
Of Anglo-Indian slang;
The roof-tree shakes, the housemaid
quakes
Before that torrid flow
Of “idhar ao " and “jaldi jao,”
And “asti bit karo.”
When Gertrude comes from India,
The Rector's habits pall,
The startled guest is gently press'd

Her parents quail before the gale

The schemes I'd lately plann'd,
They fade and die, and that is why

To keep an atlas red;
Which dared to claim my only flame
And send me this instead.

Good Mister PEASE, whom Asquith, that facetious super-
Soul, -- -
The Board of Education has selected to control,
Pray let a total stranger express his mild surprise
That your well-deserved appointment should awaken hostile
cr12S. -
.---
That you're not a Senior Wrangler is indisputably true,
But at Cambridge, thirty years ago, you won a Football Blue;
And, judging by the practice which has now become a rule,
You might have been an usher at a fashionable school.
Unversed in the laborious works of FREEMAN or of STUBBs,
You are at least a member of a dozen sporting clubs;
Your cricket still is passable; you motor and you hunt; 2
And are quite as good as RUNCIMAN in managing a punt.
You haven't wasted precious hours perusing pond'rous tomes;
You haven't studied FROEBEL or the works of Mr. Holmes;
In short, the tablets of your mind resemble, up to date—
Where education is concerned—a brand-new virgin slate.
Though your name is not in any of the Cambridge Tripos
lists,
You have kept a pack of beagles and are supple in the wrists;
Your handicap at golf is low : it isn't scratch, I grant;
But you play a great deal better than Asquith or MoRANT.
Besides, you've been a Party Whip, and whipping's at the
base— - - - -
Despite humanitarians—of the schooling of the race;
And there's something rather spirited, romantic and sub-
lime - -
In a member of the Turf Club who's a Quaker all the time.
A modern Departmental Chief should own a rhino's skin
Or else his equanimity will speedily wear thin ;
But the following reflections may serve to mitigate
The annoyance certain comments may have given you of late.
No matter how profoundly from your staff you disagree,
No matter how acutely you offend the N.U.T.,
This single consolation no disaster can efface—
You'll never disimprove upon the chief whom you replace.
Now looking at the Nations on the edge of the Abyss,
If we are sure of anything, at least we're sure of this:
That after Armageddon, if a single State remains
Unshattered, it will be a State pre-eminent in brains.
So at this all-decisive stage of England's long career
0 letsus thank our lucky stars and suitably revere,
As moulder of the Nation's mind, as Dominie Supreme,
A man who gained his colours for the Cambridge Polo team!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE YOUNGEST MEMBER.
I HAD not seen the youngest member before, though I had
heard others speak of him. It was therefore with some
satisfaction that I observed him enter the club smoking-
room where I was having a cup of tea. He came in
quietly and unostentatiously—I might almost say furtively,
but, once in, he developed a sudden and surprising aplomb.
He was not daunted by the massive and comfortable fur-
niture, or by the thick, noise-quelling carpet, or by the
copy of the frieze of the Parthenon that runs round the
top of our wall, or by the serried rows of books, or by
Dumbleton sleeping the sleep of the plethoric by the fire.
He was evidently one whom no splendour appalled.
Perhaps he owed his equanimity to his magnificent apparel,
for he was nobly clad in a shining black fur coat, yet there
was no lack of geniality in his air or his conduct. I ven-
tured to smile at him, and he returned the smile. Thus en-
couraged I beckoned
him to my sofa, and
he at once sat down
beside me with a high-
bred dignity and ease
of manner that
stamped him as one
of the truly great. I
own I was much
attracted by him, and
at once began a con-
versation.
“No, thank you,”
he said, “no tea. It
doesn't agree with me,
and a fellow must look
after his health. Milk?
Well, just the tiniest
drop—thank you so
much . . . Yes, that's
good milk, and I
ought to know. But
you're not drinking
your tea. Pray, pray
don't let me disturb
you.”
Ireassured him, and
he gave me a most

laugh at you, and even the hall-porter would begin to doubt
your courage. Now with you it's different. You under-
stand a chap.”
I said I hoped I did, and he rubbed his head confidentially
and almost absent-mindedly against my elbow. It was so
amiably done that I didn't even feel surprised.
“Yes,” he went on, “it’s a good club. Everything's
kept in apple-pie order—chairs comfortable, fires bright
and warm, carpets simply topping. You could lie down on
them and go to sleep any time, they're so soft. And the
food's A1. They don't stint you. Their fish can't be
beaten, and their Souris au Naturel is simply perfect—
there's no other word for it, it's perfect. I've only one
fault to find: they don't keep a proper supply of Volaille
on the premises. One has to go outside for it, and that's
not right. However, the steward's promised to see to it,
and when he says anything it's as good as done.”
I asked him which of the rooms he preferred.
“To tell you the
truth,” he said, “I
| like 'em all, but the
kitchen's my favour-
ite.” -
“The kitchen 2'' I
said. “Members
don't go into the
kitchen.”
| “One member does,”
he laughed, “and I'm
that member. I’ve
got no end of friends
amongst the cooks.
| Then there's the
housekeeper. I spend
hours and hours with
the housekeeper.
|Really you can't say
you've lived if you
don't know the house-
keeper. But there, I
mustn't talk any more.

“Really,” he said, “you're very good. One never knows,
you see. Some take things one way, some take 'em another.
Personally, I'm all for ease and comfort. I hate your
stuck-up chaps—not many of 'em here, I'm thankful to
say, but I did meet one last week in the gallery. Tried to
kick me, and, begad, Sir, if I hadn't been pretty nippy on
my pins he'd have done it too.”
I expressed my opinion of this monstrous act in appro-
priate terms.
“No,” he continued, “I didn't report him to the Com-
mittee. I daresay I ought to have done so, but I didn't
want to be hard on the beggar. They'd have had him out
in two-twos, you know, and then what would have become
of him 2 He's got a wife, they tell me, with a voice like a
motor-horn; sees as little of her as he can manage and
spends all his days in the club. Suppose I'd got him fired
out 2 No, I'm not one of that sort. But if it ever happens
again I'll set about him in a way that 'll surprise him.”
I warmly commended him.
“Of course I'm only a young member,” he said. “Haven't
been in the club more than six months, but one can't take
a thing like that twice lying down. All the waiters would
- — me.” With this he
sprang lightly into a large waste-paper basket half-full of
paper. There he curled himself round flush with the rim,
like a black ammonite, and was asleep in a moment.
“Yes, Sir,” said the waiter who took away my tea, “he's
a fine cat. Only ten months old, but knows his way about
everywhere. Just to look at him walking through the
rooms you'd think the whole place belonged to him. Seems
to know all the members, too, he's so friendly with them.
Yes, he 's a rare mouser.”
“One can hardly believe that, in this century, a boy of eleven could
enjoy the successful performance, at an exclusive European opera house,
of an elaborate instrumental pantomime of his own composition. Yet
such was the privilege of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, no later than
October of last year.” - -
So says an advertisement, and adds airily, “The youthful
composer is now a lad of fourteen.”
From a circular:-
“The materials for Stetson hats are brought from all parts of the
world, but the manufactured hats go to a greater number of countries."
Vaulting ambition o'erleaps itself when it lays it on like this.

THE HOOK.
It was wholly my own fault. My
presence was not imperatively necessary
in the scullery—indeed, I had no busi-
ness there at all. It has been explained
to me since by my wife, very patiently
and kindly, that my second best mashie
was not in the scullery, that it could
not possibly have been there, and I
have come to realize that she is per-
fectly right. When a man loses his
spare mashie he should hunt for it in
his golf-bag—where I eventually found
mine—rather than in the scullery.” He
is so apt to lose himself as well in the
unexplored regions of the back kitchen.
Wandering home to my study, I passed
the open back door, and there was first
greeted by the large, benevolent-looking
gentleman. - ---
“Good morning to you, Sir,”, he
said, in an amazingly important and
reverberant voice. -
I acknowledged the salutation with
reserve. The man was certainly six
feet tall, broad slightly out of pro-
portion, and “thick through,” as
anglers and fishmongers say. He
was a pronouncedly cubic person.
Drawing something glittering from his

“Andrew ?” I ventured to en-
quire.
“Farriery, Sir. The celebrated
sword-maker of Italy, and, I may
I nodded.
“But it is not the Hook itself which
mind, Sir,” the man ran on, “but the
manifold uses to which it can be put.

Hook, Sir, the world would cease to

found at the end of any ordinary
leather arm. And once there, Sir, it
stays there. No slipping loose—no
wearing out of the machined thread.
It is there, Sir, as though it had taken
root there. You will find, Sir, that the
leather of the arm will wear out long
before the Hook, and the wooden
socket will perish before you have
worn away the millionth part of an
inch of the steel. - -
“Again, Sir, think of the balance of
a good hook. No more unsightly
creases in the leather of the arm, no
able swing from the shoulder straps—
wholly due to balance, Sir, obtained, I
may add, by a secret and stringently
protected device of weighting invented
by Sir HIRAM MAXIM. I wish par-
ticularly to point out to you, Sir, that
the Hooks manufactured by the Com-
pany which I represent are completely
insulated. Lightning cannot strike
them, nor will they deflect compasses.
An infant could wear one in a thunder-
storm without peril, a mariner could
sail his barque from sea to sea without
risk, wearing one of these Hooks. The
more bagging at the elbow, no more
unnecessary play upon the working
parts. Just an easy natural comfort-

trivance, the crook, and come to close

our Hooks. At night one can screw it
into the door and hang one's arm, or
clothes, upon it, and at dawn, I may
add, you can attach your developer to
it and do your exercises without let
or hindrance. These Hooks, Sir, have
been used as motor tyre levers, as
anchors, as shark hooks, and as fire
escapes—with bed-clothes attached.
They halve one's glove bill, Sir, and
are guaranteed to sustain a dead weight
of ten tons.” -
He wiped the beads of perspiration
from his brow and continued strenu-
ously, a slightly wild look in his eye.
“These Hooks, Sir, are a boon to the
amateur gardener when pruning his
rose-trees, a source of never-ending
satisfaction to the photographer, who
can carry a camera all day without
getting stiff muscles!”
He io9ked anxiously at me, realized
that I was neither a gardener nor a
photographer, and tried afresh.
“To the mountain climber they are a
necessity. He need not fear the deepest
precipice, the profoundest abyss nor
the Bottomless Pit itself, once he has
got a grip with his Hook ; and when
mountaineering among savage folk he
needs only to give the Hook a tap with
a hammer to straighten it into a
dangerous and a reliable dagger. I

uses to which the Hook can be put,

I took both my hands from behind
my back and the benevolent man
stopped short, staring at them in a
fascinated sort of way. He made a
swallowing noise with his throat.
Then he pulled himself together and
uttered a palpably forced laugh. -
“Hardly fair—hardly fair,” he said,
with a sort of indulgent and playful
reproof, and carelessly jerking the
Hook across the kitchen garden he
turned to go.
“I suppose you wouldn't care to
lend me a couple of sovereigns 2 " he
said over his shoulder. “No 2 Well,
give us a bob, then. I may be a tramp,
but I'm human, after all. It took me
half-an-hour to clean the thing.”
I gave it, and he went away without
thanks.
He infused into his gait a slight
increase of alacrity as he turned the
corner of the house. I wondered why,
| until I perceived Hobson, our one-
armed odd-job man, hurry past him
towards me.
“Well, Hobson, what is it 2 " I
enquired benignly, as befits a man who
by sheer firmness of character has
just avoided extravagance.
“It 's me new hook, Sir,” said
Hobson, agitatedly unscrewing the
spud with which he replaces the hook
when gardening or about to garden.
“It's gone, Sir–turned me back and
it was went away most astonishing.
It was raining this morning, Sir, and it
got wet coming to work. I screwed in
the spud for to get up the plantains,
and while the hook was laid aside
tempory it got astonishing rusty. I
hung it on the railings out in the front,
meaning to clean it up when I'd done
with the spud, Sir. Happening to look
up be chance I seen it was vanished
and completely went away. Me new
hook, Sir, only been wore twice before
and that on Sundays, Sir. I been
hunting for it this sour or more.”
I pointed across the garden to the
bed of curly kale which is Hobson's
choice in the cabbage department of
our kitchen garden. -
“It is there,” I said, “there, my
Hobson, that you will find your new
hook. No longer rusty but speckless
and chaste, glittering, a thing of joy.
Between the fourth and fifth curly kale
in the third row from the western edge
of the bed, as nearly as I can judge.
And—Hobson 2 ”
“Yessir,” said Hobson.
“A word in your ear, Hobson. Never
again leave your hook upon the railings
when there is a man of cubical appear-
ance and with an important and
reverberant voice in the neighbour-
hood.”
“Nosir,” said Hobson dully, and
without in the least understanding or
attempting to. He seemed to think
that in some momentary madness I
had cast his hook to the cabbages.
He hesitated for a second, then, with a
look of silent and dignified reproach in
his eyes he proceeded reflectively to
take his hook unto himself again.

THOUGHTS ON THE NINTH.
THE least bored person in London on
Lord Mayor's Day last week was a
small boy who rode in the Show with
one of the Aldermen. That he was
having the time of his life was apparent;
but what were the thoughts under that
roomy topper and behind those quick
eyes 2
Our own thought-reader, who hap-
pened to be wedged in at the top of
Chancery Lane, declares that the follow-
ing were the boy's thoughts:
“Chancery Lane—good | Shall be at
the Law Courts in a jiff. Only hope
those blighters in front have left a few
sandwiches and things. Won't old
Blinkers and the rest begreen when they
hear I've ridden in the Show? Must get
Granddad to put it in writing for me,
or they'll think me a putrid liar. Oh,
hang it! why can't they push on 2
Wish those beastly church bells
wouldn't spoil the band. Ripping
band—better than all that historical
tosh in front. I expect old what 's-his-
name in the coach there is getting
peckish. The fat old boy on the box
gets all the cheers, and the LoRD MAYor
has to do the bowing. Rotten life, I
call it—for the LoRD MAYor, I mean.
Oh, why can't they move on ? Pretty
dirty crowd in this street. Beastly
place, Fleet Street. I bet there won't
be a single crumb left if Hooray!
we're off ”
Before accepting this version, how-
ever, we consulted one of the leading
writers cf the day, who makes a
speciality of maiden aunts. He has a
million clients who present his works
to their nephews as suitable reading,
and his emphatic opinion was that the
boy's thoughts were as follows:–
“This is indeed an auspicious occa-
sion. The ringing cheers of the
assembled populace, the riot of the
bells, the stately cavalcade—what do
they denote 2 The Lord MAYor is dead
—long live the Lord MAYor' There in
that stately coach rides a good man
and true whose merit has brought him
at last to the highest position in muni-
cipal service that this fair England of
ours has to offer. The day shall come
—here and now I resolve it—when the
occupant of that gilded receptacle
shall be none other than myself. I am
determined not to rest either by day
or night until this ambition is fulfilled.”
FIRE-EATERS A LA FRANÇAISE.
THE habit of going to the French for
drama is so strong that our histrions
almost naturally adopt French dramatic
manners too, and the recent threatened
duel between M. LE BARGY and M.
ALEXANDRE, of the Comédie Française,
has, although it was averted, led to
several similar engagements among
London actors.
Early on Sunday morning Sir
HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE met Mr.
EDMUND PAYNE in the Court of Honour
at Shepherd's Bush. The seconds
were Mr. MAX BEERBoHM (by proxy)
and Mr. GEORGE EdwardEs. The quar-
rel arose from a remark made to Sir
HERBERT by the famous Gaiety come-
dian at the Garrick Club during a game
of billiards. Mr. EDMUND PAYNE, it
seems, potted his adversary's ball when,
according to Sir HERBERT, the gentle-
manly course was to go for the red. In
a case like this bloodshed is, of course,
imperative and the affray was short and
fierce but decisive, Mr. EDMUND PAYNE
sinking under a heavy epigram. While

GEORGE ALEXANDER fought with a
nickel-plated trousers-stretcher, while
Mr. LoRAINE used an eel-skin sand-bag
stuffed with red pepper. For a while
Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER made a splendid
defence with his formidable weapon,
some of his American reverse undercuts
being extremely fine; but unfortunately,
while parrying a ferocious massé stroke
from his antagonist, he had the ill-luck
to receive the sand-bag on the edge of
the trousers-stretcher, which, cutting
through the skin, exposed Sir GEORGE to
the deadly influence of the contents. He
was removed in a state of acute sternu-
tation to the nearest pond, and the fight
was awarded on points to his antagonist.
The two gentlemen are now so friendly
that an early trip in Mr. LoRAINE's
bi-plane has been arranged for Sir
GEORGE.

strength, although he was stated to be only
twenty-four years old.”—Daily Mail.

THE PRINCIPAL FEATURE.
(A hymeneal rhapsody.)
IT would not give me much surprise
(So misted o'er with vapours
Were all those trembling maidens' eyes,
So mute concerning manly guise
Were all the local papers)
If hearts were never deeply stirred
(Without my aid) to reck where
The glory of the rite occurred,
So I propose to say a word
About the bridegroom's neck-wear.
I chose the thing; and by the Powers!
I ween my work was double
The labour of the cabs, the flowers,
The presents, the police; it towers
Above the parsons' trouble.
Grey was the hue; but not as when
(His Western wheels grown rosier)
The Sungod dwindles from our ken
And twilight shrouds the haunts of men;
In speaking to my hosier
I made this very clear: I said,
“I want some throat-apparel
Suited to gentlemen who wed,
With streaks of day-break in the thread,
And hints of song-birds' carol;
“Neat but not gaudy; not the kind
Your loud suburban dresser
About his nape is sure to bind
For nuptials—something more refined.”
The young man answered, “Yes, Sir.”
Box after piléd box we burst,
Shelf after shelf we looted ;
I was not satisfied at first,
No, we were hours in silks immersed
Before he got me suited.
But when he did—ah never band
So bravely streaked and spotted
Was ever tied by quivering hand
For any bridals in the land
Beneath a swain's carotid
And so I want the credit ; hats
With careless ease one chooses;
Trousers and overcoats and spats
Are trifling things; but chic cravats
Demand the heavenly Muses.
And, when I think upon him now
For whom all days are golden,
A wrinkle comes across my brow;
Whatever boons the gods allow,
That light will be withholden.
The years, I say, before him lie
With happiness full mellow;
But such is woman's taste (ah why?)
That this may be the last good tie
He ever wears, poor fellow.

“Why, it means I must think more

“But, weren't you thinking of the

“Now go away forrad and don't ask
awkward questions.”
Natural result of episode is that
everyone is talking of the book. If it
were issued just now MARIE CoRELLI
wouldn't be in the running in the
matter of sale. Effect will remain
when, if ever, it is published. Curious
to note in Lobby this afternoon muster
of leading publishers. Never saw so
many foregathered at same time in one

thing or two about advertising forth-
coming books. Confess they are proud
to sit at feet of a retired admiral.

ments, Clause 36 added to Insurance
Bill.
Wednesday.—On Monday chanced to
write about PRINCE ARTHUR, his rela-
tions with his party and his momentary
position. As indicating state of affairs

tion of personal affronts, the end has
come. PRINCE ARTHUR, the strength,

Thursday.—KINLOCH-CookE, assum-
ing cloak of lamented HENNIKER-
HEATON, pioneer and champion of

opportunity of making personal state-
ment. Owing to trouble with pince-nez,
inability at once to recapture the line

some difficulty in following the story.

to repel the charge, pleads that if the

as small type they will go for a half-
penny.

Distinction is subtle. Its existence
not generally known among correspon-
dents of Jack at sea, . Useful to have
it openly stated, surely as prelude to
immediate revision of rules which make
possible so absurd an anomaly.
SARK tells me of two other instances
incredible save on such authority. If,
in a telegram, he is addressed as M.P.
the abbreviation is treated as two
words and is charged one penny.
Reverse the letters and in another
connection telegraph P.M. and they go
for a halfpenny. Also, if you telegraph
to a friend who lives at Herne Bay the
address is charged as one word. If
your correspondent lives at Herne Hill
it is two words, and bang goes a penny.
In spite of tender years-the INFANT
SAMUEL, as shown by successful ad-
ministration of Post Office, is a man
of business. It would be worth his
while to get in from the Head Office a
full list of these absurdities—there are
scores of them equally grotesque—and
remove them with stroke of pen. An
hour would suffice for the work.
Business done.—Clause 46 of Insur-
ance Bill.
Friday.—Among legacies WINSTON
found left behind by his predecessor at
the Admiralty was a submarine in
whose design and building are dis-
played all the latest resources of
science. The only thing necessary for
complete-equipment is a name. Cus-
tom hitherto is to call submarines
A1, A2, A3, and so on. In addition
to sad associations connected with
two of these craft, adhesion to the nu-
merical-cum-alphabetical nomenclature
has about it poverty-stricken look.
WINston, nothing if not original, has
resolved to strike out new line.
“I shall call the new submarine
The Whale,” he said.
“Why Whale 2 " I asked.
“My good Toby, do you forget that
the first submarine of which the world
has knowledge was a whale? It had
economical advantages over our modern
craft, such as I cruised in on Monday,
because it was single-handed. Also it
could sink lower, forge ahead faster, and
when its voyage was over it had a way of
discharging its crew with equal efficacy
and expedition. So the new boat shall
be The Whale; and I hope you will
come down to the christening, bringing
your cup with you.”
Business done.—Passed three more
clauses of Insurance Bill.
“Lady Paul was then called, and, attired in
an old gold costume with furs, and wearing a
bunch of lilies of the valley, entered the witness-
box. Whereupon the court adjourned until this
morning.”—Daily Mail.

AT THE PLAY.
“DAD.”
IN Lestithian, on the so-called Cornish
Riviera, lives one Richard Beaufort,
yeoman farmer, very knowledgable on
rural matters, and much respected by
an unsophisticated community. They
sage. Also he has a secret: he knows
himself to be the natural son of some-
body, but has not yet identified his
father. Into his tranquil existence
suddenly bursts the Lothario who
begot him—to wit, Sir Joseph
Lorrimer, Bart., late of the
diplomatic service. This brave
gentleman, recently aroused to
a sense of approaching age by
the ridicule cast on his first grey
hairs by the latest object of his
wandering fancy, has resolved to
forswear the sex, to range him-
self, and to spend his declining
years in the companionship of
his hitherto neglected offspring.
So the youth is brought to
town to be taught the urbanities.
His parent's programme is
generous: to his own tailor
shall be entrusted the reforma-
tion of his boy's grotesque
exterior; he shall assume the
family name; a woman of the
world shall be found who will
put him through his paces; he
shall join the service of his
country as a Territorial (why
this proposal was received by
the audience with a snigger I
cannot say); and altogether, he
shall be made worthy of his
father's new-found affection.
The son, who meanwhile has
invited a village-neighbour
(addicted to cycling at the back
of the stage) to marry him,
receives his father's schemes
with stolid, inarticulate indiffer-
ence: but when objection is
taken to the girl on the ground that her
late father was a scamp he abruptly
girl arrives and penetrates within the
parent's apartment. Into ears of large
tearful tale of amorous attentions paid
to her in another quarter. She fears
that she may have innocently been com-
promised and so made unworthy of wed-
lock with Richard. Still susceptible to
the charms of woman (in or out of
distress), and already convinced that his
son is ill-adapted to be an ornament of
| London society, Sir Joseph determines
consult him freely, and his advice is
experience in this kind she pours a
to readjust his plans and find his own
happiness in securing that of the young
couple. In the issue, so well does he
play his altruistic part in making him-
self agreeable to the girl that she be-
comes fascinated by his incorrigible gift
of gallantry; and the son, observing
this development, resigns her to his
father and consoles himself with the
affection of a rustic maiden more suited
to his own tastes and limitations.
So, in crude brevity, runs the tale.
The First Act, which sets forth the
character and condition of young

SoTHERN). “Are you my father ?”

suming residence in the Cornish Riviera. Second Act abounds in piquant con-
Hardly has he shaken the dust of
the Knightsbridge flat from his feet
(leaving the front-door open) when the
trasts, but a slight note of insincerity is
struck in the heroine's sudden excur-
sion to London with the design of
exposing to a perfect stranger the
embarrassments which apparently she
had not thought it worth while to
confide to her lover on the spot.
The Third Act is a little weakened
by an excess of trivial exits and en-
trances, and by the fact that the
threads which it gathers up have been
woven not so much in the play itself as
in the interval between the Second
and Third Acts. But the quality of
freshness is there to the end.
If there might seem to be a certain
air of effrontery in a scheme by
which almost the first act of amends
done by a father to his neglected
natural son was to rob him of his
sweetheart, this was largely dissipated
by the charm and persuasiveness of
Mr. Cyril, MAUDE in a part that fitted
him to the finger-tips. There was, of
course, nothing strange in this, for all
characters seem to come alike to this
Protean actor; but the performance
of Mr. KENNETH. Dougi, As as Richard
was most unusual. An audience familiar
with the easy casual humour
which he commonly affects on
the stage could only marvel at
the tour de force by which he
assumed a bucolic reticance, so
alien to his habit. It was not
, his fault if the character of
Richard seemed to lack con-
sistency. Even allowing for the
change of air, there was perhaps
too crying a contrast between
his quiet resourcefuln’ss and
capability in the country and
his gauche angularity in London.
And when he returned to his
proper place, he never recovered
those practical qualities which,
as we were shown in the First
Act, had made him adviser-in-
chief to the locality. Perhaps,
however, this may be explained
by the activities of his evergreen
parent, which may well have
discouraged him.
As the heroine Miss Alex-
ANDRA CARLISLE acted very
naturally, and was particularly
good in the unfolding of her
tale of woe. Mr. BEveRIDGE
played the sympathetic parson
as only he can play that sort of
part, and Miss MARIE HEMING-
wAY was really excellent in
demeanour as the rustic maid,
full of love's intelligence, who
came by her own in the end.
Mr. SAM SoTHERN was well suited as
the Baronet's faithful attaché, never
diverted from his devotion, save by
a chronic tendency to somnolence.
Minor parts sketched by Miss CobURN
and Mr. HARwood were admirably in
the picture.
Captain JoHN KENDALL has done his
work of adaptation with nice judg-
ment. He has revolted against the
stupid habit of retaining French names
and naturalizing the rest. He has
painted his characters in English colours
throughout, and put them in an
English setting familiar to himself,
with local customs and allusions com-
plete. One of the customs was new to
me. I gather that in Cornwall, after a
lady has drunk cider out of a jug, you

“THE WAR GOD.”
On Wednesday aſternoon Sir HER-
BERT TREE presented, on his usual
lavish scale, a blank verse play by Mr.
IsrAEL ZANG will; Sir HERBERT TREE
himself and Mr. BourchIER playing the
parts of This will never do. Let
me begin another paragraph, and try
to write in ordinary prose.
If I had gone to His Majesty's in
innocence, not knowing what was
coming, I should have enjoyed myself
more. But I had previously read an
interview with Mr. ZANGWILL, in the
course of which he had made two
confessions; the first being that the
play was written in blank verse, and
the second that it contained a scene so
funny that the actors could hardly get
through with it. My afternoon, as a
result of this information, was spoilt. I
spent it looking out for, and recognising,
the blank verse, and looking out for,
and not recognising, the funny bit. I
don't know which I found more trying.
In every speech it was the rhythm, not
the meaning, which held my attention;
in every action, not the meaning but
the possible developments of humour.
It was galling to think that but for the
interview I need never have suspected
the blank verse; any more than you sus-
pected it in my first paragraph above.
And as for the humour I only felt its
absence because I thought it was to be
there. The drama did not call for it.
The War God is a melodramatic
pamphlet in four Acts. In Act I. we
see Torgrim, the Chancellor of Gothia,
weaving his webs. Torgrim, looking
something like Mr. ARTHUR BourcHIER
and something like BISMARCK, dreams
of a world empire won by battle, but
such details of his schemes as he lets
fall hardly bring home to us the idea of
a master-mind at work. Perhaps it is
difficult to order cruisers convincingly
in blank verse. The Chancellor, how-
ever, has troubles nearer home, for
the Socialists of Gothia are in open
revolt against the heavy armament
taxes. An attack on the palace,
indicated in Act II., is stopped
just in time by Count Frithiof, a
prophet of the gospel of peace, who
condemns not only the war policy of
Gothia but also the armed revolt of the
Gothians against it. Frithiof, who
reminded one equally of Sir HERBERT
TREE and ToI.stoy, must have had
considerable influence over the re-
volutionaries to have stayed them,
but this influence was not enough
to prevent them from shooting him
afterwards for interfering. Why they
could not have shot him in the first
place, I do not know ; perhaps because
it would have prevented Act III., a
beautiful scene entitled “The Revolu-
tionary Camp in the Mountains.” This
was much the best Act of the play, and
for the first time one could forget the
blank verse and listen to Sir HERBERT,
who played and died with great dignity
and sincerity. The fatal shot was fired
by the Lady Norma, a revolutionary
with whom Tcrgrim's son Osric was in
love. Unfortunately, Osric's other
object of devotion was Frithiof himself,
and his horror at this murder leads him
to suicide. At the same time Torgrim is
deposed by the King of Gothia, and
the double loss of son and office breaks
the Chancellor's spirit. Indeed, one is
left to gather that he goes as far as to
accept the peace gospel of Frithiof.
I am afraid that The War God will
not advance public opinion much. War

in modern times is a preposterous thing,
and the more people realise this the
less likely war becomes. But I doubt
if Mr. ZANG will helps with this melo-
drama. It is not active enough to
carry conviction. World politics on
the stage are always unreal, for the
reason that the men who make
history are so much bigger than
the author and the actors. But
The War God is an interesting
attempt. At the least it is splendidly
acted, Mr. BourchIER being an ex-
cellent Torgrim, and Miss LILLAH
McCARTHY an ideal Lady Norma. Sir
HERBERT I have already mentioned,
and to the many other clever players
in the cast I could only do justice in
blank verse. I must not drop into
blank verse again. M.
THE SILVER LINING.
HE came into the club and flung
himself into an arm-chair with an
expression of delight.
“Ah!” he said, “that was good. I
feel young again.”
“What was good?" we asked.
“An experience I have just had.
Something I hadn't done for years and
thought never to do again. They say
indeed you can never repeat a first ex-
citement, but I believe I have done it.”
“Of course you can't,” said the
psychologist. “You can enjoy the
second as much as the first, but you
can't repeat the first. You have a
different pleasure: you compare, co-
ordinate, ratify."
“But how about it if a very long
interval occurs?” asked the K.C. “They
say, you know, that a man changes
completely every seven years. A total
re-growth of tissue. A man, then, on
his twenty-ninth birthday has nothing
the same as when he was twenty-one.
Very well then, he can have a new
first experience every seven years.”
“Order!” we cried. “That's against
the rules. That's the most infernal
hair-splitting.”
“Well, and what is a K.C. for 2 ” he
inquired sweetly.
“Besides,” said the psychologist,
“it’s rot too, because a man of thirty
can remember what he did when he
was a boy, and if your theory were true
his memory would be only seven years
old.”
“Ah, yes,” echoed the man in the
arm-chair, dreamily, “he can remember
what he did when he was a boy; indeed
he can "
“Talking of boyish firsts and their
thrills,” said the author, “what do you
call the best ? What, for example, was
yours ?" he asked of the K.C.
“Mine? Oh, mine was my first
salmon. No doubt of that at all. It
was when I was fourteen, in Scotland.
Just under twenty pounds, and the
best part of an hour playing him.
Nothing will ever come up to that.
I lived weeks in the time—all pure
joy and agony, which are just alike
under such conditions.”
“But suppose you went out for
tarpon now, wouldn't you have a
similar feeling?”
“Never. No, not even landing a
whale would do it now. I'm too old."
The man in the arm-chair smiled
beatifically. “Never too old,” he mur-
mured. -
“What was yours?” the K.C. asked
the author.
“The twenty minutes before my first
pantomime, I think,” he said. “Getting
there much too early, waiting for the
fiddlers to come in, seeing them come
in, hearing them tune up, watching
the stalls fill, then the turning up
of the footlights, the overture, and,
at last, but, if anything, too
soon, the rise of the curtain. After
that it is mechanical : so much that is
strange and wonderful is happening
that one is rapt and bemused. But in
the twenty minutes before, seated in
the sacred building, one is so intensely,
vividly conscious of everything that
happens and everything is a rapture.
That joy certainly one can never regain.'
“And now you?” said the psycho-
logist to the man who was sunk in his
arm-chair in such ecstasy. “You
started all this talk. What was your
greatest thrill as a boy?"
“Oh, me!” he said. “My greatest
thrill as a boy was my first hansom
ride. That's why I'm so happy;
because after four years of taxis I've
just had another.”

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Cecily Chalmers, a pretty little grass-widow, who had
taken a bungalow near Camberley while her solemn prig of
a soldier-husband was fighting (I regret to say with success)
the climate of West Africa, is called by Mrs. H. H. PENRose
A Sheltered Woman (ALSTON Rivers). Her mother, as she
confided to her friend the Boy-Poet, had never allowed her
to know anything about wickedness. In the bungalow she
was safely guarded by a nice old dragon of a maid-servant;
andsome austerein-laws, the Major's aunts, lived near enough
to keep on her and her doings what I make bold to call a
backbiting eye. But you can't mother wickedness out of
existence, as if it were a cold in the head, and one Sunday
night it crept through Cecily's garden into her drawing-
room, long after she and the Dragon were safely tucked up
in their beds, in the shape of a bold bad captain come to
make love to her married sister-in-law who was paying her
a visit ad hoc. Inside the house the Dragon was sleeping
with one eye open; outside, the Boy-Poet, whose suspicions,
I am bound to say, had been very easily roused, was on
guard in a ditch; the guilty pair were observed, and Cecily
was duly told what had happened. But so also were the
aunts, to whom a passing bicyclist reported voices, soprano
and baritone, heard at an unseemly hour in a house “where
nae man should be." Joy of the aunts (for, of course, they
jumped to the conclusion that Cecily was the soprano) and
hasty despatch of the scandalous news to the West Coast.
Return of the unco' guid Major . . . and, I am glad to say,
improvement of the story, up to this point not very good
stuff, and even at that not at all improved by the freakish
intrusion of the French motif into its decorous British
respectability. But it ends well, like KING CHARLEs, and the
Major gets what he deserves. And you do get to know the
people.
The title of Mr. IAN HAY's latest story, A Safety Match
(BLACKwooD), is a little obscure, but I fancy it refers to
the fact that Daphne, its heroine, proves herself the sort
of person who—so to speak—strikes only on the box.
Certainly her one attempt to fall in love with a man who
was not her lawful husband turned out an ignominious
failure. Hers is an entertaining if not too original history,
which begins very pleasantly with an account of the
delightful rectory family of whom Daphne is the eldest;
and of the astonishment of them all (not shared, it must
be confessed, by the experienced novel-reader) when stern-
looking Sir John Carr, a man old enough to be her father,
proposes to make her his wife. So Daphne leaves her
country economies to become an ornament of the smart
set and the mistress of many mansions. The tale has been
told already, you observe, by others, from SHERIDAN down-
wards. It is only fair to add, however, that this Lady
Teazle, though she soon falls out with her husband, finds
no Joseph Surface to abet her; indeed it is her entire
failure in this respect that sends her back, humbled and
wiser, to the strong, silent man who has, of course, loved
her throughout. In spite of a rather thrilling description
of a mining strike and the consequent disaster, I myself
liked this part of the book least; it seemed to suffer from
some uncertainty of purpose. But the “handsome rectory
children" of the early chapters, their vague father, and
their muddled but affectionate home-life, are things of
pure joy.
Personally, I have never spent Saturday night in the
bar of a public-house at Barking Town, but this does not

prevent my being sure that the persons and talk I should
find there are precisely as Mr. Robert HALIFAx represents
them in A Whistling Woman (CoNSTABLE). Those who
know what is what in fiction have for some time now had
their eyes expectantly upon Mr. HALIFAx; and the present
book will certainly confirm their belief in him. The point
which strikes me most about the story is its obvious sincerity.
The courtship of Arthur as conducted by Lydia, who has
to whistle so long and desperately for him, is told with a
good deal of quiet humour; but humour is by no means
its dominant note. I have the idea, indeed, that Mr.
HALIFAx is half afraid of his own sense of fun, as of some-
thing that might interfere with the absolute truth of what
he writes. The result is a study in the unflinching realism
that is as far removed from sensationalism as from flippancy.
I will not deny that, now and again, the effect of this
method is a certain feeling of oppression; but always,
when this threatens, the real humanity of the tale asserts
itself, and takes the reader captive again. Arthur, the
newly married couple. The Times, I have discovered for
myself, briefly contemns those same diversions and diffi-
culties as mere “squabbles.” I anticipate that the weekly
Reviews, each in its own degree, will adopt the latter line,
that the Ladies' Journals will follow the former. It is
impossible to say that either side is, from its own point of
view, wrong. Mr. HowARD appears to me to be beyond
criticism, above it or below it, as you care to look at him.
He is not at his merriest and brightest in this instance,
but he is at least, as always, merry and bright. He is
no subtle observer of the inner workings of the human
soul, nor is , he the inventor of startling and original
themes; but he has a humorous way with him and an eye
for the suburban manner. Clearly, Celia and Austin Grain
were very lucky to have him for their intermediary in
courtship days, the best man at their wedding, their
guide, philosopher, friend and scapegoat during the pre-
liminary stages of the matrimonial struggle, and, at the
latter end, their genial and tolerant historian.

myself instantaneously —
and markedly amazed, for I had hitherto suspected Grania
O'Hara of no startling prettiness, wittiness or other modish
distinction. In short, I found her story, with its fairy uncle,
its sudden access of bequeathed wealth and its proudly
obstinate lover, a little trite and unconvincing, though the
telling of it by Mr. J. HUNTLY McCARTHY was a thing of
delight. From his peremptory manner of hustling it to a
sudden conclusion, I suspect that the author himself had no
great opinion of his theme, but had felt the overwhelming
need of writing about any old thing in a bright and buoyant
spirit; and, if no better plot was to hand, I hold him fully
excused, for his felicity of description and his digressive
humour are things to be aired at all costs. In Ireland he
is at home and quite pleasing, but in London of 1815 A.D.
he is more than happy with his portrayal of contemporary
men and manners. His chronicling of the riots in the
Rotunda Theatre, I do, in the language of the time, protest,
is in the most comic and whimsical vein conceivable.

tisement, describes One of the Family (WARD, Lock) as an

about all this to the mere town-dweller, but one cannot
avoid the feeling that such mysteries are easy to invent
but very hard to encounter in actual fact. Apart from
this (which is the thing that does not quite hit me) there is
good stuff in the hero's stormy courtship, and the compli-
cations resulting from the conditions of his father's last
will and testament. I liked that, and I also liked the
author's whimsical trick of playing in parenthesis the part
of showman to his puppets:– “A pretty heroine, this,
who in five minutes has given evidence of ingratitude and
impudence both.”

A VICTIM OF INTRIGUE.
THE Tax-cart had returned from the Station laden with
a crate, from which, when deposited and opened in the
Poultry-yard, a stout white goose waddled with languid
dignity. “Why, gobbles my soul!" cried the Turkey, “it’s
Emmeline!” “No end glad to see you!” said the Bantam
Cock, as he strutted up. “What with you leavin' just
before Michaelmas and that, had an idea you'd gone for
good / " “Where have you been all this time, dear?”
inquired the Orpington Hen. Emmeline replied, with a
slightly overdone carelessness, that she had been at Covent
Garden. “Covent Garden 2" repeated an Aylesbury Duck.
“Sure you don't mean Leadenhall Market 2" -
“I was not at the Market,” explained Emmeline im-
portantly. “I was at the Opera House. I had a special
engagement to appear in HUMPERDINCK's Chaldren of the
King.” “You’ve put on flesh, Emmeline !” said the
Turkey a little irrelevantly, “ lot o' flesh you've put
on, by gad ' " “They tell me,” said Emmeline, “German
Opera is apt to produce that effect. Though, in my case,
my figure is generally considered to have improved.”
“Well,” said the Bantam, “and now let's hear what
you've been doing up there?"—and Emmeline was by
no means reluctant to oblige. “Before obtaining an
engagement,” she began, “one has to go through a course
of training for the stage; but they soon found there was
very little they could teach me ! I mean my technique was
so perfect already. And, when rehearsals began and Itrod
the boards for the first time, I felt I was at last in my true
element—which is more than can be said for the other
birds in the company. Hopeless they were ! No idea of
ensemble—never seemed able to remember where to stand,
or when to make a ‘cross' As I said more than once to
the Stage-Manager, “The fact of the matter is,' I said,
‘they're not Artists at all—they're simply Walkers-on tº
However, between us we managed to get them into some
sort of shape for the First Night. I was a little nervous
beforehand and afraid of breaking down—but, curiously
enough, the moment the curtain went up I felt I'd never
been in better voice. As for the music—well, I don't call
it music—harsh and discordant, if you ask me ! And the
plot—I never could make head or tail of it myself. I
remember saying to the Tenor once at rehearsal, “Tell
me,' I said, ‘ can this thing possibly succeed 2' I forget
his reply. .
“But fortunately, the moment I made my first entrance
with the young person who was engaged as my Goose-girl,
I could see I had the whole house with me, and that made
me more hopeful about the piece.
“All my scenes with her went tremendously, and the
First Act ended with rapturous applause, in which I was
too happy and excited to resist joining. Well, strictly
speaking, my contract did not require me to appear in the
subsequent Acts, and I had not intended to do so. But, as
I stood looking on from the wings, I had a sense of some-
thing lacking—a want which perhaps I alone could supply.
“The roar of delighted welcome that greeted me as I
tripped gracefully on removed any misgivings I might have
had. It proved that my instinct had not misled me! And,
after that, I stood by the Hero and Heroine to the close.
It gave them confidence, especially as I was able to sustain
their voices by throwing in a note or two every now and
then. Not often—but whenever it struck me they were
getting out of tune.
“The theatre-staff officiously attempted to interfere, but I
took no notice of them—it was enough for me that my
efforts were understood and appreciated in front of the
house. I don't mind telling you that I, and I alone, pulled
that Opera through The curtain fell on the Last Act
amidst the wildest enthusiasm, and a unanimous call,
which I knew could only be meant for Me! Still, I would
not allow it to turn my head. My little Goose-girl had
really sung quite prettily; it is true that, perhaps unin-
tentionally, she had spoilt some of my best effects—but
then I had the proud satisfaction of knowing I had played
her off the stage! So I said to her, ‘My dear,' I said, ‘I
couldn't think of going on to take my call without you.’
So we went on together.
“Only those who have been through it can imagine the
sensations of an Artist on realising that she has gone
straight to the great heart of the Public, so it would be
useless to describe my feelings as I stood there, my eyes
dim, my bosom heaving with pride and joy . . . And then
an incident happened on which I do not care to dwell. An
immense floral trophy had been passed up to me across the
footlights, and, if you'll believe me, that unprincipled
Tenor, handed it to the Goose-girl, under my very beak" ||
And she actually took the trophy, too ! I might have made |
a scene, of course, if I had chosen to forget myself so fa"
As it was, I resolved to behave with tact and savoir faire:
I just gave the audience a glance—half humorous, ha'ſ
appealing, you know—like this "-(and here Emmeline gave ||
an illustration of the sort of thing) “as much as to say,
“It's all right, I don't mind. Don't undeceive the poor
child ! Let her keep her illusions—and her floral tribute!
And the audience understood me—they behaved quite
beautifully I don't believe she knows the truth even yet
But when she had driven off in her car with my flowers
own to being slightly hysterical. And the next morning–
that was yesterday—I had an interview with the Directors.
‘Gentlemen,' I said, ‘I'm most sorry to cause you any
embarrassment—but,' I said, “but I have my feelings as an
Artist. And, after what occurred last night, all. I can say is
this: Either that Goose-girl leaves the Company, or I do.
It's for you to choose between us!' I told them . And
so here I am. I fully expect the Management will move
Heaven and Earth to persuade me to return to the Cast.
But the insight all this has given me into the intrigues and
jealousies that undermine the Profession has thoroughly
disgusted me with the Stage. I shall never go back. At
least I don't think I shall.”
The general opinion of the Poultry-yard was that Em-
meline had shown a very proper spirit. - .
“They didn' hev no use for that goose up at Covent
Garden,” the Farmer was remarking. “But I will say
they've fattened her up proper.” “Ah,” said the Farmer's
Wife, “we shall soon have Christmas on us now !”—rather
as though that festival were some sort of leopard. “Christ-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVA
THE INVADER.
I ActUALLY saw him for the first
time on Wednesday evening; but he
had given me warning of his approach
on the previous Monday. On that night
I was awakened suddenly by the noise
of somebody eating wood. The sound
seemed to come from underneath the far
corner of the room, and it might have
been the man in the flat below stand-
ing on his bed and biting a pen-holder.
I did what everybody does when he
hears a strange noise in his bedroom at
night; I leant out and felt for a boot,
ſlung it in the direction of the noise,
and in the subsequent quiet went to
sleep. -
But at three o'clock I was awake
again. Whoever it was was very
hungry indeed. He ate wood steadily,
from three to four, my one remaining
boot quite failing to put him off his
food. Recognising him now for a
mouse I tried the blandishments one
tries with animals. I said, “Did ums
then,” “Woa-ho there! steady 1" and
then, very firmly, “Down, Sir!”
And on Wednesday evening I saw
him. I had been reading late, and as
I looked up suddenly there was a flash
of brown across the sofa. I rubbed
my eyes, fixed them on the electric light
and saw flashes of pink, green and
purple. “This is the end,” I said to
myself. “My sight is going.” Wishing
to take a last farewell of London, I
walked across the room and shot the
blind up. There was another flash of
brown. . . . .
So the invader had arrived Well, I
was ready for him. I got my niblick,
rolled up my sleeves, and took cover
behind the revolving bookcase. Sud-
denly he appeared. I lashed out at him
with a whoop, and for five seconds
there was a glorious mix-up—five
seconds of the best. Then I limped to
the sofa and examined my foot care-
fully. Only two toes broken, luckily.
The invader camped for the night on
the top of the pianola, having supped
lightly on a pianola roll. I suppose he
thought at first it was an ordinary roll,
and looked around for the butter. Au
clair de la lume was the piece, Op. 347,
no less, of C. BöHM ; or, as they say in
German, Komm' wir wandern im Mon-
denschein. One had hardly suspected
such a taste for music in the lower
classes. He had stopped, however, at
the fifth note; a black one, I fancy.
This decided me ; I went out and
bought a trap. Now it was none of
your common traps; something worthy
of a disciple of BöHM. I feel, therefore,
that I should describe it carefully.
You went in by the front drive in
the ordinary way, and as soon as you
|
began to wipe your feet on the hall mat
the door slammed behind you. In alarm
you turned round suddenly. Trapped
Was there no way of escape? None.
Stay, what is that passage in front ?
Does that lead anywhere? It does.
It leads by a flight of stairs to a com-
modious apartment on the first floor.
And now that you are in the commodious
apartment, what can you do? Another
door in the passage has magically
closed behind you. Are you ambushed
again 2 Yes—no Look there—a little
turret-hole ! • .
You peer through ; there is a spacious
ball-room on the other side of that hole,
replete with every modern convenience,
including a swing floor. You jump
happily on to it. Free—hooray!
And then the floor begins to swing.
It swings and sways, and sways and
swings, and just as you are saying to
your partner, “Very jolly floor and all
that, don't you think, but a bit too
slippery—what?” it tips up altogether.
Help !
Down you go, down, down . . .
suddenly—splash !
Now I must tell you of something
particularly ingenious. When your
mouse falls through the floor into the
tin of water he automatically opens the
front-door of the trap for the next
person; and so you can go on until the
whole family has perished at sea. Isn't
that jolly?
Let us resume the narratory style.
I put this trap in the middle of the
room, opened. its door, and sat down
and played Magic Bells—also by BöHM
(Op. 21—when he was quite a lad).
Nothing happened. I examined the
trap carefully, oiled it, and played the
piece again. Still no mouse. Finally,
about midnight, I went to bed, leaving
the roll at the mouth of the trap. And in
the morning an utter absence of mouse.
and
Of course I was mystified at first,
but I soon began to understand. My
mouse had never seen a trap like this
before, and he didn't know how to work
it. What he wanted was a decoy mouse
who would show him the way it was
done; or a list of simple instructions
printed outside the front door. Some-
thing of this sort —
Please wipe your feet on the mat.
If the lift is not in working order try
the emergency stairs.
In the morning ring the bell once for
the chambermaid, twice for the boots, and
THREE TIMES FOR THE BATH.
If the bell is not in working order the
bath-room will be found neart to the bed-
room. There is always plenty of cold
water, but guests who require hot water
should order it overnight.
Please consider the convenience of the
other guests whom the management may
wish to entertain, and leave everything
in the condition in which you found it.
But unfortunately my mouse, though
a lover of music, did not understand
the written word.
Alas, this story draws to a tragic
close. You must understand that,
though I and my mouse had this faste
for harmonies in common, yet I have
no real affection for his race. So one
morning I said to the housekeeper as
she was clearing away breakfast–
“By the way, when you've nothing
else to do, I've a mouse I should rather
like you to catch.”
“Why, Sir, I caught him a week
ago,” she said reproachfully.
“Did you really 2” I said.
however 2 ”
“Just one of those penny traps and a
bit of cold bacon fat. They're much
better than those new-fangled ideas; ”
and she looked contemptuously at my
hotel, which was now standing on the
top of the bookcase.
“Then he's—he's dead 2 " I asked
nervously.
“Yessir.” - -
“Was he brave to the last 2 Did he
partake of a hearty breakfast? You
gave him something, I hope 2"
“Yessir, I gave him something right

So he's gone ! Well, I shall miss
him. He was a sportsman, and he had
a love for the arts. I like to think of
him brave to the last, dying with a
song in his heart. Almost I could

[“. It must be regarded as certain that the
Norsemen discovered the continent of North
America, besides Greenland, about 500 years
before Cabot (and Columbus). . . . There
seemed to be little doubt that there was a
close connexion between Irish legends and the
Icelandic tales of voyages to Wineland and the
other lands in the West. In the old Irish
legends there was a whole world of such for-
tunate islands in the Western ocean, which had
names very similar to that of Wineland.”
Dr. Nansen.]
A PoliticAL meeting has recently
been held, comparable only to the famous
Carlton Club gathering, to discuss the
important bearings of Dr. NANSEN's
statements about the discovery of
Wineland upon the forthcoming Home
Rule Bill. Mr. TIM HEALY presided,
and amongst those present were Mr.
WILLIAM. O'Brien, Mr. BERNARD
SHAw, Mr. GEORGE CADBURY, Lord
IVEAGH, Mr. John JAMEsoN, Mr. GEORGE
MooRE, and Mr. T. P. O'CoNNor in
disguise.
Mr. HEALY, in opening the proceed-
ings, observed that Dr. NANSEN had
admitted that Wineland, which was
universally accepted as an established
fact to be part of America, was iden-
tical with the Fortunate Islands which
were discovered by Irish navigators
about 500 years before CABOT and
CoLUMBUs. The Norwegians put in
a claim to the discovery, but the hardi-
hood of the Norsemen was prover-
bial. In his opinion no scheme of
Home Rule could be tolerated for a
moment which did not include as an
integral part of Ireland the territories
discovered by their fearless forefathers.
Mr. WILLIAM O'BRIEN said that he
endorsed every syllable that had fallen
from the lips of his intrepid colleague.
But while they were all agreed in
principle, divergence of opinion in
details was possible. For example, any
proposition that emanated from the
tortuous brain of JoHN REDMoNd they
were bound to reject with contumely
even before they knew what it was.
Another point was this: ought the new
territories to be merged in the name
of Greater Ireland, or ought Ireland to
yield to the claims of Wineland? . .
Lord IVEAGH said that with great
respect he thought that Wineland as a
name must go. It was no doubt a
picturesque name and rhymed with
Rhineland. But it was not in corre-
spondence with fact. If they were to
change the name of Ireland to any
name connected with drink, he ventured
to suggest Stoutland or Porterland as
the obviously appropriate designation.
Mr. JoHN JAMEsoN strongly demurred
to this suggestion. Stout was unknown
in Ireland in the days of ST. BREN-
DAN, BRIAN BoRoIMHE or Owen Roe
Attºr Norrø.,,,
Country Cousin. “Do N'T You FIND IT very TRYING To HAVE EveryoSE TURNING Itou Nd
AND STARING !”
Town Lady (with a sigh). “ONE HAs to HARDEN ox Eself To It."
O'NEILL, whereas the fame of usque-
baugh was established in the days
of the earliest Milesians. He would
propose that Wineland be called either
Whiskeyland or, as a compromise,
Punchland.
Mr. GEORGE MooRE said that he
had already several times shaken the
dust of Ireland from his feet for ever,
but Dr. NANSEN's discovery was of
such interest and importance that it
had re-established a connexion between
himself and his native country. But
any desire on the part of those present
to re-name Wineland after himself was
doomed to failure, however much
they might press it, as Mooreland had
a Scottish ring, which is what he could
not tolerate.
Mr. GEORGE CADBURY drew attention
to the Cocos Islands, first discovered by
that intrepid circumnavigator, Captain
CoE ; but he was instantaneously re-
moved by two teetotal members of the
Society of Friends, who insisted that
even to be in a room where a country
named Wineland was being discussed
was contra bomos mores.
Mr. T. P. O'Connor was understood
to say that never in the whole course
of his picturesque and adventurous
career had he been at a meeting more
remarkable for the genius and beauty
of those present.
Mr. BERNARD SHAw said that he
was a Eustace Milesian and a tee-
totaler, but he was no bigot. Names
never corresponded with realities, and
so long as they sounded well that was
all that mattered. Wineland was as
good a name for John Bull's Other
Island as Ireland; but he must say
that he objected to be referred to as
the most brillant of living Winishmen,
which would, of course, be his fate if
the change were made.
The meeting was then broken up
with shillelaghs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[Nov EMEER 22, 1911.
NEveR in any opera-house at home
or abroad have I seen a crowd so
strange and exotic as that which paced
the luxurious foyers of Mr. OSCAR
HAMMERSTEIN's new building in the
intervals of the first performance.
Among the New Yorkers, conspicuously
responsive to the loud welcome of their
illustrious compatriot, there were types
to which the epithets of BRowNING's
Lippo Lippi might well be applied: they
were indeed a “bowery flowery” com-
pany. A sprinkling of the Old Guard
from the headquarters of Grand Opera,
with whose names we are so painfully
familiar in the columns of the social
press, had come to sample the new
enterprise and lent to this remarkable
gathering an atmosphere of hallowed
tradition.
Talking of atmosphere, I learn from
my programme that “the air-heater is
capable of raising the temperature 40
degrees.” I can quite believe that on
the opening night the capacities of the
Americo-Turkish Bath system had
been tried to the full, for I was well
on towards the shampoo stage by the
time I reached my place in the Pit.
No such name, of course, was given to
the locality where my comfortable stall
was situated, but it lay far back under
the depressing weight of the first tier
of boxes, and I had to be content with
such waves of sound as chanced to
penetrate its remote recesses.
The decoration of the interior seemed
to lack severity. The unavoidable ugli-
ness of the bulging box-fronts was not
improved by the restless relief-work
which adorned them, or by the super-
fluity of statues on attached pedestals
which choked the intervals.
Before speaking of the performance
let me say at once that Mr. HAMMER-
stEIN was pleased with his audience.
At the end of the Third Act he came
before the curtain and made a speech
to the following effect: “I thank you
for your flattering reception. [Here it
seemed that the speaker referred to his
notes.j All I wish is to deserve your
respect, your friendship and your ad-
miration.”
question of money at all. And this
bears out the statement of my pro-
gramme which refers to Mr. HAMMER-
stEIN's “abstinence from connecting
art with commercialism " as one of the
“factors which are bound to bring
success to such an undertaking.”
The opera itself—Quo Vadis?—was
frankly spectacular. Except in the
First Act, where nothing particular
occurred, the music, both vocal and
orchestral, was dominated by the scene
and the action, and left an impression
So, you see, there is no
that was largely negative. Very little
chance was given for star-work in a
scheme where no one was of exceptional
importance, unless perhaps it was St.
Peter (Mr. FRANcis CoMBE), who for
the best part of a whole scene had his
audience, both on and off the stage, all
to himself. The honours of the evening
went to the stage-manager, M. JACQUES
CoINI, and the scene-painter, M. PAUL
PAQUEREAU. Nothing more clever could
be devised than the scene on the banks
of the Tiber, with its bridge going away
in very difficult perspective; and the
representation of the interior of the
Coliseum was of an amazing brilliancy.
The crowd, too, was more intelligent
and versatile than any I have ever met
outside the walls of His Majesty's
Milk. OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN.
“It's your admiration I want.”
Theatre, and should be a lesson to the
stuffy and stereotyped supers of Covent
Garden. The attitudes as well as the
singing of the Christians in the scene
where St. Peter enters their prison to
console and inspire them showed extra-
ordinary sympathy and understanding.
And in the Coliseum, where the spec-
tators rush on to attack Nero and are
met by the armed Praetorian Guard,
the rough-and-tumble which ensued
was absolutely terrifying in its realism.
SIENKIEwicz's novel, which I have
not had the advantage of reading, is of
course too long and intricate for con-
nected reproduction in operatic form.
Even so, a more logical sequence might
have been achieved in these detached
scenes. Thus, the affair of Eunice
and Petronius, to which a lot of un-
necessary attention is drawn in the
First Act, was completely suspended
through the three succeeding Acts (to
say nothing of an hour or so of interval)
and only resumed about 11.30, after I
had withdrawn from the various seats,
in box and stall, placed at my disposal
by hospitable friends. The argument
supplied in the programme was also of
the spasmodic kind. Thus:—“Poppaea,
wife of Nero, taxes Petronius with
having brought another woman to the
side of Nero [this was the first we had
heard of this episode]. He protests.
Nero's guests enter and hail Poppaea.
Winicius and Lygie are left alone in the
garden.”
The chief thread that held together
the looseness of the plot was the minor
part played, and very well played, by
“Mr.” FIGARELLA, as Chilo, a sorcerer
who described himself correctly enough
as “un philosophe incompris.” He
does the dirty work of the play and
gets killed in the arena for his pains.
I would sooner have seen the killing
of Croton by Ursus, for they were both
heavy-weights, whereas the feather-
weight Chilo was no match for a couple
of large Praetorians. But this was done
off. So, too, was the episode in which
Ursus breaks the neck of the bull, the
latter hampered by having Lygie bound
to his horns. You might naturally
wonder how a turn like this, performed
in the open arena, could escape the
eyes of the audience. But Mr. HAMMER-
stEIN's Coliseum, noble and practicable
though it may be, is not the thing that
we all know so well in Rome. It
was shaped more like the Metropolitan
Inner Circle, with spectators on both
platforms. The killing of Chilo was
done before our eyes at High Street,
Kensington, as it were; but the bull's
neck was fractured round the corner at
Gloucester Road, so to speak. Another
improvement on tradition occurred in
the scene of the burning of Rome (a
very subtly-contrived effect to which
I venture to invite the attention of Mr.
ARTHUR Collins). The schoolboy is
always given to understand that NERO
marked this historic occasion by a solo
on the fiddle. Mr. HAMMERSTEIN has
corrected that error. His Nero did not
fiddle; he lyred.
It is futile to prophesy about the
ultimate success of the London Opera
House. One is, of course, predisposed
to welcome any competition that
threatens to arouse the Syndicate at
Covent Garden from the contented
indifference of the monopolist; but un-
less we are to have a State-subsidised
Opera at reasonable prices (and Mr.
HAMMERSTEIN's intervention does not
encourage that prospect) there would
not seem to be room in London for two
enterprises devoted to “Grand "Opera

BEECHAM has shown that there is a
sufficient demand for Light Opera, but

To shoot the pheasant is my intent.
When most of the leaves are off it's pleasant—
You know it yourself—to shoot the pheasant;
So imagine me setting out from here
With all my luggage and shooting gear.
I've packed (and so has my man) with care,
And all I can ever want is there;
All the manifold apparatus
That makes the porters at stations hate us:
Parcels, boxes and bags and cases
To bring the sweat to their purple faces.
And yet I know when the train has glided
Out of the station with me inside it;
When I run through my list of things again
There will come a panic, a shock, a pai
To strike me awake and so remind me
Of the things I need, but have left behind me.
But still I'm off by the 3.18
With my cartridge-bags and my magazine
(A servant-daunter, a true man-fagger
That'll make the most muscular footman stagger),
And a pair of guns of a tidy kind,
And a shooting stick, and a hopeful mind.
Now, whatever the noble pheasant is,
He isn't a fool; he knows his biz.
If you or I were as good as he
They'd pay us to go to Tripoli
To teach the fellows who man the works
To dodge the lead of the fighting Turks.
He sometimes tries, as I try in rhyme,
To strike the stars with his head sublime;
And, lo, when you meet him next, he swelves,
Like a mathematician describing curves;
And whenever he does you may be sure
His curves have a double curvature.
And next, to harass your mind with doubt,
He takes to his wings and he flies straight out;
For the top of your head he seems to go
In the line of a bee when a bee flies low.
You give it him twice to save your head,
And you come to yourself—but he isn't dead.
So far I have mentioned the bird as “him ";
But everyone knows that the hen's as slim.
She isn't so shot with green and blue, -
And she seems to refuse to be shot by you.
You may shoot with all that you most prefer
In powder and shot, but you can't hit her.
But sometimes—oh, it's a blessed day!—
Your heart is light and your spirits gay;
There isn't a brow that's less in frown,
For the birds get up and you pull them down.
Rich (and rare) is the bliss you win
When your eye, which nobody wipes, is in.
So my traps are packed and I'm off to Kent;
To shoot the pheasant is my intent.
You'll stick to your desk, like a mortared brick,
While I am stuck to my shooting stick;
But, whatever my luck with the birds may be,
I venture to hope that you'll miss me.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Exth ACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Novem-
ber 13.—It is not solely on the race-
course that an outsider wins. Case of
BoNAR LAw elected to Leadership of
Opposition brings parallel with singu-
lar closeness home to Westminster.
There were three probable starters,
BonAR LAw with characteristic modesty
standing last in the betting. A few
close students of Parliamentary form re-
cognised his supremacy, but were not
bold enough to anticipate that it would
triumph over certain disabilities. For
eleven years he has sat in Parliament
commanding attention of House when-
ever he took part in debate. Had he
been nephew of a Duke or cousin once
removed of a Viscount he would at
least have been made Chancellor of the
Exchequer when the post fell vacant
on break-up cf PRINCE ARTHUR's first
Administration consequent on explo-
sion of DoN José's Protection bomb.
As it was, being something in the iron
business in Glasgow, he had an Under-
Secretaryship tossed him, a concession
extorted by sheer capacity.
That for the last six years he ranked
on the Front Opposition Bench
second only to Prince ARTHUR, is a
circumstance that has upon more than
one occasion been insisted upon by
that impartial, impeccable judge, the
MEMBER For SARK. For himself he
made no moan, patiently looking on,
probably hoping for better things some
day; certainly not dreaming of the
prize which by strange chance has
fallen into his hands. Meanwhile, to
his added credit, be it remembered that
He remained faithful to the Chief to
whom he was indebted for opportunity
to place his foot howsoever iow down
on the ladder of fortune.
To the country at large he is a dark
horse. In the House of Commons he
is recognised as one of its most power-
ſul debaters. Speaking chiefly on
questions relating to Tariff Reform he
has occasionally fallen into the
acerbity of manner and acrimony of

These are not habits indigenous to his

to call him.
He may not be expected to climb

raised) by permanent officials in the
Scottish Office, it is well to have in House
of Commons a retired warrior of the
breadth of view of Colon EL YATE. Like
Ben Battle, who, having “lost his legs
in Badajos' breaches,” completed dislo-
cation by “laying down his arms,”
the gallant Colonel is on retired list.

eye on Foreign Office and keeping

questions on the paper. True, they were
numbered only five. But by strategic
use of “and whether ” he was able to
double them. Also it must be ad-
mitted he actually had in hand only
two subjects, to wit the insecurity of
roads in Persia and the safety of
Maltese British subjects at Banghazi.
But the Colonel did not march to
IKhandahar for nothing, nor was he at
the bottom of the Pendjeh Incident
without bringing home experience valu-
able when bombarding Treasury Iłench.
Instead of packing his questions in
two parcels and handing them in at
door of Foreign Office, he takes por-
tions of his allegations, makes them

to the Foreign SECRETARY. When,
having answered Question 15 on
the paper, that hapless Minister thinks
he has finished with the Maltese
residents at Banghazi, the wily warrior
comes up on his flank with Question
16, repeating the enquiry with the
added information that “eight were
killed and several wounded during the
bombardment; and whether he can
give any information on the subject.”
As for the roads in Southern Persia,
they, extending over hundreds of miles,
afford the ColoneL full scope for “and
whether.” A lesser man really anxious
for information would have put his
query in a sentence of twenty words.
The Colonel appropriates Numbers 6,
7 and 8 on the Question paper requir-
ing three separate answers from the
Minister.

His Parliamentary fame was made by
a chance, irrelevant yet eloquent,
allusion to BoADICEA, whose statue had
recently been erected on Westminster
Bridge. Actually he has much more
important claim to distinction. All
very well for the Die-Hards and their
offspring, the Halsbury Club, to boast
that they got rid of PRINCE ARTHUR.
It was Rowland HUNT who first raised
the standard of revolt, soundly lectur-
ing his esteemed Leader in hearing of
amused House.
PRINCE ARTHUR, at the time not
acclimatized to that sort of thing,
regarded the episode rather angrily.
Consequence was the Party whip was
withheld from Rowland, who, in re-
sponse, gave them an Oliver in the
assertion that he thought he could live
without it. As a matter of fact the
disagreement was patched up and he
received his whip as before.
Nothing can deprive him of the
distinction of being pioneer in the
movement which last year WILLoughby
DE BROKE took in hand. And now,
when there arises necessity of filling
up the gap, no one even mentioned
Rowland HUNT's name in the list
of candidates.
“Always remember what BoADICEA
remarked in analogous circumstances,”

“Sic vos non volis mellificatis apes;

“Never mind, old man,” said SARK,

THE VERY DICKENS IN
FRANCE.
THE sudden passion displayed by
Paris playgoers for dramatised versions
of DICKENs' novels would be more
gratifying to us if the dramatists had
left well alone. But when a version of
David Copperfield turns Mr. Micawber
into a schoolmaster of , the type of
Squeers and introduces Fagin's thieves'-
kitchen we are divided between ad-
miration of such ingenuity and grief
that the real thing should be avoided.
Forthcoming productions on similar
, lines will be devoted to Oliver Twist
and Martin Chuzzlewit.
In the French version of Oliver
Twist, Mr. Bumble is not only a
workhouse official, but in his spare
time the affable and humorous
driver of a stage coach, with a
rooted dislike of widows. Fagin
remains, but a scene has been
written in for him from the
Merchant of Venice, the French
translator 'apparently believing
that DICKENs also wrote Shak-
speare, and he asks in eloquent .
tones: “Hath not a Jew eyes?" /
to which Bill Sykes replies, in /
thieves' argot, “Ay, and hooks.".
Nancy takes a prominent part, but
spends a great deal of time in the
company of Mr. Brownlow, who
has become a confirmed gambler,
and together they wander from fair
to fair. As for Oliver Twist, he
has not been tampered with, except
that he is very ſat and is always
going to sleep.
In Martin Chuzzlew it, Mr.
Pecksniff is the principal character,
but to increase the interest of the
part he is not only an architect
but a miser with a late partner
named Marley, who appears to
him as a ghost whenever he has
done anything peculiarly base. Mrs.
Gamp, the other prominent figure, not
only sues him for breach of promise
but forces his architectural pupils to
eat brimstone - and - treacle. Peck-
sniff's two daughters wear harem
skirts and are both engaged in Mr.
Mantalini's dressmaking business,
where they meet not only Jonas
Chuzzlewit and John Westwood, but
Sir Mulberry Hawk, Barnaby Rudge
and Sydney Carton. The comic scenes
are provided by young Bailey, as in the
book, but he is always accompanied
by the Marchioness. The adaptation
otherwise, we are glad to say, takes no
liberties with the original.

The Glad Eye is undeniably funny.
When Gaston Bocard, hiding from his

peers down to see what is going on

particularly as Gaston is played by Mr.

prepared to ascend to the gallery to
fetch a certain book, and Gaston,

had snatched the book from its shelf
and dropped it into the room. Per-

could have remained undiscovered.
|He hardly had time to wonder himself,
for to his great surprise Galipaua re-
garded the falling of the book as a
psychic manifestation, and stood there
willing more books to come down.
Undeniably funny, then, and un-
deniably ingenious is The Glad Eye;
and also undeniably vulgar. The
stuffy atmosphere of the French farce

want a few nights in Paris away from
their wives, and wives who can be

PROBLEMS FOR PLAYWRIGHTS.
Now that an academy for dramatists
has again been mooted, and in view of
the many volumes of instruction
in the art that are published, we
have pleasure in anticipating the
following examination paper:-
A.—For the Classical Side only.
1. What is a “curtain"; and
how should it be led up to?
2. What is the legal position of
the hero of a melodrama who is
discovered kneeling beside the
corpse of a total stranger? What
facts would justify the governor of
the convict prison in subsequently
permitting him unlimited emo-
tional interviews with the heroine?
3. What (also in melodrama) is
the meterological influence of a
financial reverse for the good
characters? Illustrate by the con-
duct of snow-storms.
4. Explain “A Cup and Saucer
Comedy,” “A Bedroom Drama,”
“An artistic rather than a financial
success” (one wold only).
5. What do you understand by
“the sketch limit” 2 If a one-act
play at a music-hall can rightly
be described as “the limit,” does
this ipso facto make it illegal?
6. (For musical-comedy candi-
dates.) Into any serious scene intro-
duce, with not more than three lines
of dialogue as warning, an extra lyric
beginning “Mary married a motor-man.”
B.—For the Modern Side only.
1. What is a “curtain"; and how
can it be avoided ?
2. Discuss, with reference to recent
dramatic history, the maxim “Words
were given us to obscure our plots.”
3. Why should realism only concern
itself with the lower middle-class 2
4. What (if anything) do you under-
stand by “the fourth wall"? Consider
a proposal that the proscenium arch
should be permanently bricked in.
5. Sketch the scenario of a four-act
play on the Insurance Bill.
6. “A Repertory play is one that is
never likely to be repeated.” Why not?

THE SERVANT STAMP.
A MISTREss of NINE.
DEAR SIR,--I send you particulars of
my own case, not because I crave
publicity—I abhor it—but because I
believe it to be typical of tens of
thousands of middle-class households
throughout the land. Our means are
moderate, and I can assure Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE that every penny, nay every
halfpenny, of my weekly house-keeping
allowance is carefully allotted in ad-
vance to its respective purpose. Well,
how in the world is it possible for me
to meet this new and exorbitant tax 2
2s. 3d. may not seem a very large
amount—we keep nine servants, I
should explain—but it simply means
that we must go without some of the
necessities of life.
I am, Yours, etc., DISTRACTED.
ONE WAY OUT.
DEAR SIR,--It means ceaseless irr-
tation and weekly conflict within the
home. It can't mean anything
else. It means bitter hostility, by
the very fire-side, between mistresses
and servants who have lived together
on terms of closest intimacy and even
friendship. Cannot anyone with the
slightest imagination foresee the Satur-
day morning scene when Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE's precious insurance card is
being bandied back and forth from
kitchen to drawing-room, accompanied
by the defiant message, “’Stick 'em on
yourself!” It is intolerable, and I for
one have already arranged to escape
from the impost by going to live in
Tripoli.
I am, Yours, etc., INDIGNANT.
SERVILE AND UNwhoLEsoME.
DEAR SIR,--The thing may be neces-
sary, but need it be made degrading?
If it were only a question of dropping
pennies into a slot, I for one would
raise no objection. But this servile
and unwholesome business of licking
stamps—and gum never did agree
with me—will unquestionably cause a
revolt among the maids and mistresses
of Britain. I keep four servants, and I
may as well admit to you that I live in
daily terror of them. I find it quite
bad enough to have to ask them to
perform the ordinary duties of the
house. But I can't ask them to do
this. I simply can't.
I am, Yours, etc., PANIC-STRICKEN.

find it hard enough to afford postage.

“fatigued.” Perhaps “Veritas” thinks
that the words mean the same. If so
I am sorry for him, as his education or
his mental equipment must be sadly
lacking. If “Veritas” will come to
Ballyslaughter I will prove my con-

will find that the “flat '' taste he
complains of, and difficulty in making
the water boil, will disappear if he takes
my advice, as I always get excellent
results, viz.: a large brew of tea of the
finest flavour. First, then, he must
empty the Radiator. It stands to
reason that water which has perhaps
been circulating round the engine for
weeks cannot be relied on to produce
tea of really good flavour. When
emptied it is a good plan to run a
gallon or two of clean water through
the radiator and then fill up with fresh
well or, preferably, spring water. Open
the throttle full, shut off the air,
disconnect the fan, put the spark back
to its farthest, start the engine and boil
up. This takes me with my 40 H.P.
“Mogul" exactly seventeen seconds.
When the water boils put the tea into
the radiator enclosed in a sausage-
shaped muslin bag with string attached
so that it may be withdrawn when
infusion is completed. This is a much
better plan than allowing the loose tea
leaves to circulate, as they are apt to
clog the draw-off cock and have then
to be picked out with a hat-pin or,
better, a crochet-hook, a tedious business
at best. I may mention that while
tea-making is in progress excellent
buttered toast may be made against
the exhaust, which is, of course, red-
hot, or a cutlet grilled to perfection.

[letter No. 85,611] that all roads where
they enter and leave villages should
have notices slung across from house
to house stating the name of the place,
quite takes the banana. The arrange-
ment might be improved, however, by
making the letters two feet high, as
a twelve-inch letter is sometimes un-
readable at high speeds. The name,
too, should be printed in luminous
paint (except where electric illumina-
tions is possible), and on both sides of
the board, as one frequently forgets the
name of a place while buying petrol,
&c., and likes to be reminded on leaving
it. As proof how necessary some such
device has become I may say that only
last week I ran through York under
the impression it was Selby, which
place I had not noticed on the road at
all; and a pal of mine lately mistook
Blackburn for Rochdale, Rochdale for

INJURED GUILT.
HE had been a good groom, as he
will tell you himself, and had been
dismissed from his groomship without,
as he argues, adequate reason. The
unfortunate dispute which led to his
dismissal was at the most a difference
of opinion. His view was that a
groom is entitled, by way of perquisite.
to take from the corn bin and carry
home with him so much corn as a
groom's hens require. His master held
the opposite opinion ; “but even if he
was right,” thought the groom, “surely
a master ought not to sack his servant
every time they disagree in an ethical
argument 2 And, if he must dismiss
me, it was adding insult to injury to
accuse me of theft.”
He gave the matter some thought
during the following weeks, and a
further consideration occurred to him :
“When a man has been called a thief
and has suffered for the alleged theft,
surely he is entitled to some proceeds?”
So, having promised an orgie to his
depressed poultry and having bided
his time, he resorted quietly one even-
ing, about a week after the termination
of his service, to the stables of his old
master, in search of vengeance and a
last basket of corn. In his day the
stable key had been religiously kept in
a niche in the wall, close to the stable
door, so concealed by the ivy that it
could hardly be discovered, except by
those who knew of its exact where-
abouts. To a man so far removed
from being wholly bad as to have an
extremely high opinion of his wronged
virtue, it was the last straw to discover
that the door was locked and that the
key was no longer lodged in that niche.
A moment's consideration showed him
that the reason of this change must
be connected with himself.
“Well, I do think,” he murmured
bitterly—“I do think that they might
have trusted me that far.”

our BookING-office.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I shall, never understand why some writers are taken
up by the public and others are ignored. Miss ANNE
Douglas SEDGwick has been writing now for some years.
Her books are looked forward to eagerly by the elect; each
new story as it comes out is praised by the critics in the
warmest terms. She must have been told a hundred times
(and told with perfect truth) that she is “in the very front
rank of modern novelists.” And yet I doubt if one person
in six has ever heard her name. Well, the loss is the
public's, not Miss SEDGwick's; and the public shall be
given one more chance. Tante (ARNOLD) is the book this
time. It tells the story of that colossal egoist, Madame
Okraska, the famous pianist; of Karen, her adopted
daughter, blind and devoted worshipper at the shrine of
genius; of Gregory Jardine, who married Karen and saw
through Okraska; of Okraska's bitter enmity towards
him ; and so, finally, of the choice between mother and
husband which Karen had to make. Perhaps I should
not have told you that Okraska was a fraud. Miss SEDG-
wick herself is never in a hurry to describe her characters;
she lets them impress their own personalities upon you.
They act and talk without comment from the author, and
in the end one knows them all the better for her restraint.
Tante is a finely-told story, which will live with you for a
long time after you have read it. And for the sake of the
elect, who alone will appreciate what it means, I will add
that it shows Miss SEDGwick at her very best.
Other great novelists might descend with a certain loss
of dignity from the cloudier heights of romance to the
realms of the purely topical; but not so Mr. HENRY JAMEs,
In The Outcry (METHUEN) he has touched upon a no less
burning newspaper theme than the sale of a masterpiece (a
supposed Moretto) by a great English nobleman to an
American millionaire of the hustling variety. Additional
interest is provided by the discovery on the part of a young
and aspiring connoisseur that the picture is no Moretto after
all, but the eighth Mantovano of the world, and on the
strength of his enthusiasm this “detrimental" gains the
heart of its aristocratic owner's daughter, who is about to
resign herself to a marriage of convenience in order to
square her sister's gambling debts. But, however soiled the
subject may be with the mud of so recent a controversy,
there is no alteration in the delightful methods of the author;
hardly any character receives an answer, even to the lightest
of remarks, until Mr. JAMEs has put up a pretty little fence
of psychological subtleties in front of it; and when the
answer does come it is most commonly of that tentative,
allusive kind (redeemed from complete improbability by a
touch of slang or even an oath) with which we have grown
familiar; and certainly as much as that of any of his previous
books the style of The Outcry marks the apotheosis of the
adverb. “He had his effect, and Lord Theign's answer,
addressed to Lady Grace, made indifference very com-
prehensive. “You may do whatever you dreadfully like ''''
This is but one of a score of instances. May I respectfully
suggest to the publisher that in future he should print
below Mr. JAMEs's titles on the front page, “By (quite
charmingly) HENRY JAMEs.”

WHART.on's latest novel,
there unconsciously moves
through his story the figure
of a sunny-natured, kind-
hearted, earnest-souled man
whom it is an impulse to-
wards good to know, even
through the medium of his
book. PHILIP JAMES BAILEY,
in his Festus, spoke scath-
ingly of Bishops. Many
years after he wrote to ex-
press his regret. “It was
knowing the Bishop of
Ripon,” he says, “that made
me consider the lives of other
Bishops, and finding such
good men makes me wish
to alter the passage.” On
laying down this delightful
book the reader will under-
stand the influence that led
to this significant change of
front.
It is easy enough to
imagine a man of Dr. NAN-
sEN's calibre and industry
sitting down to write a
popular book of Arctic ad-
Ethan Frome (MACMILLAN);
undeniably powerful little
tale, I am bound to confess
that personally I would
sooner keep the money.
Really, the book is an elong-
ated short-story, of that
rather depressing kind that
starts by introducing its
central character as a bat-
tered wreck, and then goes
back to explain how this
came about. It came about
for Ethan Frome because he
was so unfortunate as to fall
in love with pretty Mattie
Silver, soon after she arrived
to help his invalid wife at
their lonely farm—the scene
of all this is, of course, laid
in America. The growth of
their unconfessed passion is
certainly very well de-
scribed ;
guilty joy they take in
their apparent domesticity
when supping alone during
venture, and being irresis-
tibly drawn from his original
purpose. In Northern Mists
is long, possibly it may - -
be overlong for those who like to acquire knowledge at
top-speed, but its facts are simply stated and its ideas
clearly set forth. At the end of these two most engrossing
volumes Dr. NANSEN has not reached the history of Arctic
voyages proper. As he began to be immersed in his subject
he found that much that had been written was not to be
depended upon. So, as he says, “what had to be done
was to confine oneself to the actual sources, and as far
as possible to build up independently the best possible
structure from the very foundation.” And “from the very
foundation " he has started. His first chapter is called
“Antiquity, before Pytheas,” and afterwards he takes us
down the ages with a fine scrupulousness for chronology.
If from the extraordinary amount of information here given
I had to select the matter of most enthralling interest to
myself, it would be that which relates to the question
whether the Greenlanders are to be considered the first
Europeans to discover América. Dr. NANSEN answers it
with an unqualified affirmative. That sent one's thoughts

the temporary absence of
the wife. There is beauty
in this that would have
-- - - better graced a better book.
Eventually the lovers, unable to bear the prospect of
separation, agree to die together; their idea (to which
I cannot help suspecting they were urged less by their
own convenience than by a wish to give Mrs. WHARtoN a
dramatic climax) being to go full speed down a toboggan
run, and smash into a tree. It was not a very happy
scheme, as Ethan indeed acknowledged when he awoke
to find himself permanently disfigured, and Mattie a hope-
less cripple. So, for the rest of their long lives, there
the three of them lived, in the lonely farm, invalid wife and
maimed lovers, chained together, and nagging. Jolly, isn't it?

THoMAs, I count it your affair, not mine;
Yet on my heart 'tis laid
To let you have a note, a privy line,
Touching your parlour-maid :
I wish, as one whose friendship, firm and fast,
Has never shrunk from moral duty,
To say that I have heard reflections passed
Upon her striking beauty.
I see no blame in this ; I fail to see
Why this same Mary Ann
Should ask for anybody's leave to be
As lovely as she can ;
I3ut there are men more curious in surmise,
Eager to trace the sort of scandal
To which a bachelor's ménage supplies
An oh so obvious handle.
To such as these, when gossip grows too gay,
I always answer, “Pish
Thomas, I say, is cold; he has, I say,
The nature of a fish ;
Incurious of the dansel's dainty air
Who serves his soup and meat and pastics,
He couldn't tell the colour of her hair
Nor whereabouts her waist is.”
Thus I defend you. Yet I have my fears;
For in my head there rings
This thought:—Proximity in time endears
The most unlikely things;
Some Saturday he'll come with sudden whirl—
The Wingéd Boy that laughs at sages,
And have you through the heart just when the girl
Is being paid her wages.
For then, in your dim study, 'neath the lamp's
Softened and shy regard,
You two will be engaged in sticking stamps
On her Insurance Card;
And GEORGE's scheme (whatever else its use),
Demanding this concerted action,
May bring your heads together and induce
Ancillary attraction.
Yet take no shame, my Thomas, should it come
That lips which thus unite
To damp the same intoxicating gum
A dearer bond should plight;
That those two tongues which started out to curse
The loathéd rôle of mere stamp-licker
Should pledge their vows for better or for worse,
For healthier or for sicker.
So may your virtue follow that advice
Of HoracE (see above),
Who urged his young friend not to be too nice

CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
THE LAST COMER.
A CHRISTMAs (NUMBER) TALE.
It was midnight, the Ghost's High
Noon, and in an upper chamber of an
old house near Fleet Street the season-
able spectres had met for their annual
re-union. Though the year was yet
in early autumn, the Ghosts, as usual,
had brought their own weather. Holly
and mistletoe festooned the walls, and
a mighty fire roared in the wide chim-
ney, despite the fact that, outside the
elaborately frosted windows, October
was departing with her customary
blusterous warmth and a crop of press-
paragraphed primroses.
Within the room, however, winter of
| the kind that is called old-fashioned
reigned supreme. The scent of printer's
ink and glazed paper was calculated to
strike terror into the boldest nostrils;
it was the distinctive scent that pro-
claimed the advent of the phantoms to
the haunts of men—the dread perfume
of the Christmas Number.
Already there were not wanting signs
that the grip of these Ghosts upon the
shilling public was loosening—but of
this they themselves seemed still to be
in ignorance. Anyhow they were all
there. At the head of the long table sat
that elderly spectre, clad in a winding-
sheet somewhat threadbare with long
use, whose custom it had been, years out
of count, to denounce on Christmas Eve
its unsuspected murderer. Opposite,
the family Skeleton rattled its familiar
bones with gusto, the Missing Will
still clasped, from simple force of
habit, within its fleshless fingers. It
was glancing, with the ghost of a wink,
towards the Blue Lady, a female now
of mature years, who, for her part,
seemed to respond to such advances
with every sign of amiability. This,
however, astonished none of the
spectral company, since it was well
known that an old understanding
existed between the two, who had,
indeed, worked together too often,
Christmas by Christmas, to retain any
formality towards each other.
Absence of ceremony was, however,
a pleasant feature of the whole ghostly
| gathering. Mere vulgar spooks, such
as the Headless Horseman or the
Driver of the Phantom Mail, were
obviously regarded as on an equal
social footing with spectres of the very
bluest transparency. A sense of tasks
accomplished seemed to pervade the
company, so that one and all, conscious
of another twelve months' well-earned
leisure ahead, abandoned themselves
with zest to the exhilaration of the
moment. It was, in short, a party of
high old spirits.
Then suddenly, while the revel was

at its gayest, at the precise moment
when the venerable chair-ghost had
risen for the time-honoured proposal of
“Our First Editor,” a strange footstep
became audible upon the stair without.
With slow and unaccustomed step it
climbed, and the very sound of it, elo-
quent of dull weariness and resigned
despair, sent a chill of horror down
the marrowless spines of the startled
listeners. Huddled together, the smiles
frozen upon their jaw-bones, the phan-
toms turned with one accord towards
the door, where, upon the threshold,
stood now a figure far more sinister
than any that the imagination of Yule-
tide artist could conceive.
Consternation had fallen upon the
room. The spectre at the head of
the board drew its inadequate sheet
closer about limbs that rattled in their
sockets. Thrice it essayed to speak
and could not. At last, “What form is
this,” it faltered, “that thus intrudes
upon the revelry of the immortals? We
here are they who have conquered time
itself, the Christmas-Number Ghosts,
the always-same, who know not change.
By what right dare any stranger claim
place amongst us? Speak, we charge
thee! Whose ghost art thou?"
Then the Figure spoke, and the sound

THE GREAT GUM QUESTION.
“ARE you a pro-Gum or, an anti-
Gum?” said Jeremy. “I forgot to
ask you when we got engaged. Your
mother only told me that you had a
sweet disposition.”
“If you mean what do I think of
this ridiculous servant-tax—”
“Anti-Gum,” said Jeremy.
thought so.” -
“I say nothing about the stanip:
sticking. You'll have to do that part."
“I was going to put up Baby.
She'd simply love it.” -
“What I complain of," went on
Mrs. Jeremy, “is that it will alter the
whole friendly relationship between
mistress and servant.” - -
“Oh, do you think it will? ... I can
see it bringing you and Cook even
closer together. Nothing brings peo-
ple together like a common grievance.
Every Saturday, as you each drag out
your threepences, you will tell each
other what you think of LLoyd GEORGE,
and by the time you have finished you
will be awfully friendly. A link to
bind where circumstances part.”
“Don’t be so silly.”
“My love, when you have a new
idea presented to you, you mustn't leap
to the conclusion that it is a foolish
one. It is a fact that all over the
country just now mistresses and ser-
vants are writing letters together to
the papers, and asking each other how
to spell ‘scandalous.' By the time the
Bill is at work an intimacy between
upstairs and downstairs will have been
established that nothing but death can
break. As for Baby and me, we love
Cook anyhow, and I think she loves
us. Gum cannot come between us.”
Mrs. Jeremy went over to her hus-
band and sat on his knee.
“Jeremy,” she said, pulling his hair,
“you're always kind and generous to
me, aren't you?”
“Always. I've noticed it myself. I
say, you are heavy."
“Well, if LLoyd GEORGE brought in
a Bill compelling you to be kind to me,
wouldn't you be indignant 2"
Jeremy frowned and gave himself up
to thought.
“Upon my word, I don't know," he
said at last.
gr evance out of the word “compel’;
but it doesn't mean much, really. You
may say that I'm compelled to pay
income-tax — the alternative being
prison. But it's just as true that the
clerk is compelled to go to the City
every day and slave from nine to six—
the alternative being the workhouse.
The only difference between the two
cases is that prison is said to be the
more comtortable. After all, there is a

law compelling me not to beat you, but
I simply can't get indignant about it.
I don't strike my chest and say,
‘Scandalous! As though any decent
man would beat his wife " '''
“Oh, I can't argue with you,” said
Mrs. Jeremy, “but I know I'm right.”
“I’m not arguing ; I'm just throw-
ing out ideas. Something will emerge
presently. I sort of vaguely agree with
you, you know, and I'm trying to find
out why. I think it must be the gum,
after all.”
“Well, you saw what The Lancet
said—that all sorts of contagious
diseases will get spread.”
“Did it really say that?” cried
Jeremy excitedly. “But that makes
it all right, dear. Cook is bound to
catch something, and then we begin
to get our money back at once! We
insure her for sixpence a week against
illness, and LLOYD GEORGE lets her
have measles on the very first Satur-
day! It's too good to be true.”
“And you said you loved Cook!”
“I hope I can approach this matter
in an impartial spirit,” said Jeremy with
dignity. “Why, of course,” he went on
eagerly; “now I know what I objected
to in the scheme. It was the fact that
it was an insurance.”
“You did know it was called the
Insurance Bill, dear?” said his wife
meekly.
“I am insured,” said Jeremy, dis-
regarding her, “against death, fire,
accident, workmen's compensation,
burglary and hail. We have been
married three years and nothing—
absolutely nothing has happened. Un-
known to myself there has evidently
been growing up within me a deep dis-
trust of insurance. I must have told
myself that the thing was a fraud.
And that was why I had this vague
dislike of the Servant Tax.”
“It's the silly bother of it all that I
mind.”
“No, no,” said Jeremy eagerly.
“You can't put me off now. The
thought of Cook coming into the
presence of a licked stamp for the first
time in her life and catching mumps
has made a new man of me. Bother 2
Nonsense! Now I'll just show you.”
He took out his watch, looked at it for
a second, and said, “Go !” Then he
dashed out of the room for his bicycle.
In five minutes he was back again.
“Your stamp,” he said, producing a
sixpenny one. “Four minutes, forty-
nine seconds. In a month or two I
should probably do it quicker. Of course
we shall want more than one, but the
postmistress tells me that you can buy
three or four in arow with equal rapidity.
Now we want a card to stick it on.
Sticking it on will be rather a solemn

business; we must allow plenty of time
for it.”
“Oh, Jeremy, you are a silly '"
“If this is to be a proper rehearsal I
suppose we'd better have the servants
in. No 2 Perhaps you're right. Cook
mustn't catch anything until the in-
surance people are ready for her. Now
then. I shall lick this first one myselſ,
and afterwards you and Baby can take
alternate Saturdays. I know which
side to lick because I asked at the post-
office. In fact, the difficulties simply
melt away when once one begins to
attack them.” He rolled back his
sleeves, moistened the stamp and
approached the card stealthily. “Ob-
serve ' " he whispered. -
There was a sudden movement, and
then Jeremy withdrew his hand.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said
with a slight bow, “I thank you for
your kind applause.”
“Jeremy, you baby,” laughed his
wife.
“Every Saturday,” said Jeremy,
summing up the position, “you will
place four adhesive stamps on in the
manner indicated. It will take you
about five or six seconds. I shall
ride into the village to purchase the
stamps, and the little outing will do
me good. You and the staff will run
down LLoyd GEORGE together for
coming between mistress and maid,
and your common hatred will be yet
another bond between you. And,
finally, Cook, after her first bout of
whooping cough, will be completely
reconciled to the small payment of
threepence a week. If these are not
rare and refreshing fruits I'm blessed
if I know what are.”
“You’ve forgotten one thing,” said
Mrs. Jeremy obstinately.
“Probably, dear. What is it?”
“That I know I'm right.”
A. A. M.
“Sir William paused, breathing hard. The
subject was wont to excite him more than any
other. Then he added : "A man or woman who
allowed a man or woman to marry his or her
daughter or son without telling him or her that
there was insanity in the family I would send to

There is a sparkle about Sir William's
conversation which is very rare now-a-
days. All the same, if there wasn't
insanity in the family, his condemnation
of the parents for not saying that there
was might be considered rather severe.

WILLIAM.
(A rather unfortunate Episode.)
“HE pecks the gilded confines of his cage,
He eats enormously but gets no fatter,
He answers nothing to our persiflage,
He who was warranted to chirp and chatter;
My father thinks that he is off his head,
So we have mewed him in our topmost garret,_”
That was (in substance) what Miss Thompson said
About her parrot. -
And I, in part from friendliness with her,
In part from anguish for the poor brute's sorrow,
Said, “I will do my best that voice to stir;
Have him sent round to me some time to-morrow.”
So William came. Most anxiously I thought -
What authors he would like, what honeyed words heed,
And in the intervals went out and bought
Sugar and bird-seed.
At last I cried, “The Muse!” and every morn
Sat down beside the bars and read him pieces
Of the high poets' pages, thumbed and worn,
Battles and old romance and kings' deceases;
I read him “Thyrsis" and I read him “Maud,”
BRowNING and KEATs, and every favourite writer,
But still he stuffed and still his cage he clawed,
The dashed old blighter.
But on the ninth day, as I droned aloud
Some song of Swinburne's full of flowery riot,
There seemed a lifting of oblivion's cloud;
He closed his dexter eye; he grew more quiet;
Some change in that wild savage heart occurred;
--
HUNT.-No. 4.
He seemed to say, “This dumbness was dissembling";
Almost I seemed to catch the golden word;
His mouth was trembling.
But, ere he spoke, Miss Thompson took him back,
And I, in good hopes that the bird was better
And sure to find again the long lost knack,
Expected hour by hour some thankful letter;
And then I met Miss Thompson in the street,
And unsuspectingly took off my bowler,-
I think I never saw a face so sweet
Look quite so Polar.
Worried with apprehensions, faint and weak
I sought her brother James, a rare good fellow,
And said to him at once, “Did William speak?
Was it from 'Atalanta' or ‘Sordello'?”
And James replied to me: “Some British tar,
One of the kind whose breasts are bronzed and oaken,
Must have taught William first in days afar;
William has spoken.” Evoe.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted From The DIARY or Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Novem-
ber 20. Whatever flood of conviction
may swell the breast of an honourable
Member regarding another on the
opposite benches it is a gross breach
of order to tell him that he lies. Johs
DILLON,
brusquely broke the rule, with conse-
quence that he was suspended from
service of House and enjoyed quite a
little holiday. There are, however,
ways familiar to old Parliamentary
Hands of safely getting out of the
difficulty. To-night LLoyd GEORGE,
in one of frequent protests against
perversions of the principles and pro-
posals of National Insurance Bill, deftly
scored. Denounced particular state-
ment as a gross patent misrepresenta-
tion. “There is,” he added, “a shorter
word one might use and it would be
more accurate.”
The other night TIM HEALY proudly
alluded to CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER
as “My boy,” meaning that LLoyd
GEORGE had studied Parliamentary
style in his private school. Whilst
the pupil may be promising the master
retains pre-eminence.
Eighties, when Parnellism was in full
bloom and TIM one of its choicest
petals, C.-B., at the time an Under
Secretary not dreaming of the Premier-
ship, happened to drop an observation
which to a strictly logical mind, consti-
tutionally opposed to dereliction from
exactitude, called for rebuke.
“I know very well, Mr. SPEAKER,”
said TIM, turning to the Chair and
recognising its majesty by a friendly
nod, “you will not allow me to
call the honourable gentleman
a liar. So I refrain from doing
so.”
House was aghast. Angry
cries of “Order " '' rose from
shocked Ministerialists. But
TIM had measured his ground
carefully. SPEAKER was not
able to call him to order, and
he proceeded to end of dis-
COurse.
Business done.—In Com-
mittee on Insurance Bill.
Tuesday.—Insurance Bill at
last out of Committee. Mem-
bers salute the happy hour
with sigh of relief, Ministerial-
ists breaking into a cheer.
Been a terrible time, the heat
and burden of it borne by

tion with charming frankness.

duty, to improve the Bill by moving
amendments.
That involved close study of a
document bristling with alleged facts
and confusing figures. They created an
atmosphere in which PRINCE ARTHUR
was not habitually what you may call
at home. Accordingly he deputed task
of watching Bill from Front Opposition
Bench to HARRY ForstER, who has
accomplished task in manner that adds
greatly to budding Parliamentary
reputation. As for PRINCE ARTHUR, as
soon as House got into Committee on
the Bill he strolled out, in manner
reminiscent of the famed strategist
“who fled full soon on the first of June
And bade the ret keep fighting.”
Example followed by majority of
Members from both sides, some two
score, occasionally three, remaining to
carry on work of the sitting.
| Marvel of prolonged episode is
"CHANCELLOR or Exchequer. Not
physically robust, he has not shirked
an hour's attendance through the long
i tedious wrangle. True, when it re-
commenced to-day he showed some
sign of being beaten at last. It was
our old friend ALPHEUS CLEoPHAs, of
whom not much is seen or heard in
these dull times, who did it. It is not
only in Committee that burden of
the Bill rests on shoulders of CHAN-
CELLOR. At Question-time Gentlemen
on both sides submit conundrums care-
fully drafted in solitude of their chamber,
which they expect him to answer off-
hand. This afternoon ALPHEUs CLEo-
PHAs wanted to know “whether, in
Clause 14, sub-section (5)(a), page 14
of the National Insurance Bill as re-
printed, the term persons, firms, and
bodies corporate will include
grocersholding patent medicine
licences and at present selling
medicines and invalid foods
recommended by doctors?”
When the lists were re-
opened and the tourney recom-
menced, the CHANCEL LoR,
temporarily knocked over by
ALPHEUS, bucked up again.
To this end WILLIE PEEL
contributed a personal attack,
to which he replied with vigour
that might have suggested to
the uninformed that it was
his first and only speech for a
fortnight. This effort turned
out to be prelude to long
masterly defence of the clause
which brings domestic servants
within operation of proposed
Act. Rewarded by seeing
Ministerial majority run up to
146 in a House of 336.

having been prepared in the Irish Office

P.&INCE ARTHUR's claim to renown
gained at Westminster might rest on
reforms in Parliamentary procedure
introduced and carried by him when
in office. None other has done so
much in direction of making House
of Commons a business-like organisa-
tion. There was one new departure
taken in the bloom of comparative
youth which did not prove a success.
It should be added that it did not take
the form of a new or amended Standing
Order, being simply a personal habit
which he attempted to graft upon
Parliamentary work of Irish Secretary.
When PRINCE ARTHUR held that
office the Nationalist Members, or such
as happened to be out of prison at the
moment, worried him with intricate,
incessant questions. Process of inter-
rogation and answer rarely occupied less
than half an hour. Midway through the

of undertaking the job of deputy, he

nellites roared deprecation when the

cried, as if CHIEF SECRETARY were a

they could not endure half-an-hour's
unnecessary separation. So CHIEF

of departments turn on their juniors to

As on average only one in ten of

not perhaps greatly matter. It may
be well to make a note of it for the

BEAUTY ADORNEI).
THERE is many a true word spoken
in jest. There is many an untrue word
spoken in love. Aspodestera had
spoken the former, when she said
lightly that she should not be surprised
to hear that I was going to a really
good tailor for my next suit and that
right soon. She had, I feared, spoken
the latter when she called me “her
dearest and best.” No woman's dearest
and best could be clothed in the kind of
clothes which she said that I was then
wearing, -
“Pshaw ' " said I (of course I never
really used a word like that), as I con-
templated the window of the Bondiest
of Bond Street tailors, THE tailor, in
fact. I marked the solitary and price-
less trouser length, casually draped over
a lonely pedestal therein. “Pshaw I
will not be an aesthete; I will be a
man. I will go inside and tell him so."
I went inside, but I did not tell him
SO.
In the course of my legal career I
have told many a bigger and more im-
posing man than myself that he was,
practically, a liar. I have rebuked a
Judge of the High Court to his face, and
I have made my way undaunted into
the very House of Lords and there
yawned while my learned leader ex-
pounded the Law, yawned in the very
presence of the Woolsack and without
troubling to put my hand in front of my
mouth. I have done even more than
that ; I have kissed Aspodestera when
she was not only unwilling but passion-
ately prohibitive. But in the presence
of the Tailor I was overcome.
“I have come,” I said meekly, “to
be measured for a suit," and thereupon
I was measured and dismissed. I do
not suggest that I was approved of. I
admit that I was not very willingly
tolerated. But I think, on the whole,
that I was forgiven. The gentleman
who measured me, the aristocrat who
made a note of the dimensions, and the

I referred to the painful subject, and
told her that she might, if she liked,

“But I love you,” she declared, “for

Even so, I doubt if I ought to allow
the worst woman, let alone the best, to
attach herself for life to so loathsome a

to him, I venture to think, a labour of

TALIKS WITH VISIONARIES.
THE THEATRE ARCHITECT.
I MET him first years ago; and I
remember his enthusiasm and fine
ardour as he outlined his intentions;
remember almost his exact words, so
much in earnest was he.
“Yes,” he said, “I am going to
revolutionise all that discomfort. It's
so simple a matter—once you can
get the owner of the theatre to
agree. There's the matinée hat, for
example. Women won't take them off
unless they are made to, that's certain.
The idea that people behind either can-
not see or want to see is equally foreign
to their mind, even although they sit
behind an impenetrable barrier them-
selves. Women in swagger ha's are
like that, bless them | But why should
they take their hats off 2 If architects
did their duty they would never have
to ; because a large part of the
architect's task is to enable one row of
people to see over another row's heads.
That 's what architects are for, and
that's what I shall do. It merely
means giving the floor of the stalls and
pit a steep slope.”
“Then why isn't it done?” I asked.
“Ah, why?" he echoed. “Because
no one has the pluck to stay away
from theatres until it is, chiefly,” he
replied. “Because no English people
out for entertainment have the sense or
courage to combine, having the terrible
fear that while they are combining they
will lose their twopenny - halfpenny
amusement. And then the gallery,”
he continued. “That is not so easy
because it is so high up. The stage
being above the pit stalls you can
guarantee everybody a view; but to
do so in the gallery you must reduce
the number of seats. Do you know,”
he said, “there is not a gallery in
London from which everyone who has
paid for a seat can see without stand-
ing, and many cannot see even then.
Yet the stupid sheep go on buy-
ing seats. No combination, again.
In order that everyone may see,
sitting, the number of rows must be
reduced by half at least, or the same
rows as at present, with alternate seats
and blanks. Then no one would be
immediately behind anyone else. I am
interested in this because I have been
to so many galleries myself and have
suffered enough. Nothing like personal
knowledge. Have you ever watched the
difference in the way that a barmaid
and a barman open a bottle of Bass 2
The barmaid, who does not drink Bass,
or, if she does, has never thought
whether or not it was clear, shakes
the bottle and empties it. The barman,
who knows the nature of beer in-
stinctively, is careful with it and does
not pour out the lees. It is the same
with our profession. Those of us who
have lived in uncomfortable houses can
design comfortable ones; those who
have visited theatres where the cheaper
public cannot see will try to improve
their conditions.
“Then, again,” he continued, “I shall
arrange that people can enter and leave
the stalls without putting everyone
near them to inconvenience and even
pain. It merely means a little less
profit for the manager, that is all.”
“Yes," I echoed, gloomily as a 1)ean,
“that is all.”
“But you don't think so poorly of
managers as that 2 They'll do very
well, especially when it is known that
the theatre is so comfortable.”
“And yet,” I said, “thre uncomfortable
theatres are crowded to-day.”
His face fell a little, but he soon
recovered; and so he went on, touching
on various other points connected with
theatre construction—safety under fire,
and so forth—all proving how curiously
this branch of building has remained
stationary while all kinds of enterprise
have been shown in others.
Well, as I say, that was many years
ago, and I lost sight of him completely,
although I remembered his words.
Last week I saw him again. Curiously
enough, he had been in my thoughts
very recently, for I had been in a five-
shilling seat at Covent Garden to see
the Russian dancers, and being at the
side and everyone else in the same rows
having to stand I had to stand too.
It was the next day that I saw him.
I had to visit the St. Pancras Work-
house on business, and I noticed a
familiar face. It was my visionary
among the inmates.
“The fineman in charge took the small party
round, and one of the figures to which the guide
called special attention was the wax effigy of
I)r. Sun Yat-sen himself. “That,’ said the fire-
man, ‘is the chief of the Chinese insurgents,’
never thinking he was talking to the original of
the figure.”

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
| THE chief reason why I found myself (with the best will
in the world) unable to enjoy Mr. WILLIAM Dr. MoRGAN's
latest novel, A Likely Story (HEINEMANN), is that, while
the characters are as lifelike as ever, the story in which
they figure is too wildly unlike anything even remotely
possible. You know what Mr. DE MoRGAN's people are
by this time, and their engaging practice of using just
the inconsequent, ungrammatical speech of real human
beings. That, and their author's quaint trick of reporting
them phonetically, have endeared them to countless readers.
But to find all these jolly and companionable folk mixed up
in a stupid story about a picture that talks is, for me at
least, simply exasperating. Not content indeed with the
loquacity of the original painting, Mr. DE MoRGAN wants
us to suppose that even amateur photographs of it become
| endowed with the same power of speech. Well, as I say,
I'm sorry, but I really can't quite stomach it. Of course
I appreciate the fact that the whole thing is only a kind of
joke on the author's part at the expense of his critics.
They blamed him, he says (in a personal epilogue, which is
far the most entertaining chapter in the book), for deserting
Victorianism in favour of historical romance: very well,
then, in the present work he will combine the two methods
by means of a mediaeval picture that enters into the life of
a modern household. The drawback to this pleasantry is
that, intended to confound the critics, it will inevitably
confound the unoffending public a vast deal more... But
now that Mr. DE MoRGAN has had his retort we may hope,
in the name of all those to whom his peculiar gifts are very
dear, that “it never can happen again.”
When I say that Penny Monypenny (SMITH, ELDER) is
a novel of Scotch character, you will possibly exclaim,
with my very cordial agreement, that both the theatre and
the libraries have lately had more than a sufficiency of
Scotland. But be reassured. Penny is Scotch with a
certain difference; and MARY and JANE FINDLATER's-book
about her contains scarcely a dozen lines of what could be
called dialect. I am very sorry after this to have to add
that its humour is pawky; but really this is the only word
for the peculiar sparkling dryness that informs all the
Misses FINDLATER's writing, and invests even their most
commonplace characters with individuality and charm.
(Perhaps one should write it charrrm') So many of these
characters are introduced during the ample and leisurely
course of the tale that it is quite impossible to mention all
of them, or to retell their story in any detail. One figure
however stands out in my memory: Lorin, the frail, whim-
sical boy whom Pen loves throughout, whose long hair and
outlandish ways are such a perplexity to his Scotch
relatives, and who eventually migrates to Paris, and ends
up as a journalist in Australia. When I tell you that his
other name was Weir, and that at one time he speaks of

the memory of his native land “haunting him like a pas-
sion,” you will perhaps agree with me that the authors
might have called him, Robert Louis without making the
likeness to a great original much more obvious. In any
case his is a figure new to fiction, and one that gives
distinction to an interesting and capitally written book.
A fortunate reader, happening upon The Centaur (MAC-

recommend it to his friends. His hesitation would be due

relieved by so little of strong love interests or comic situa-
all blemishes of form, not of matter; that one is judging
not by one's real but by one's confounded literary standards;
that the whole thing gains in significance by the very
crudeness of the workmanship. There is here no touch of
the genius of a MARIE CLAIRE, but a rather clumsy record
of a pathetically groping aspiration and of a very fine and
splendid courage in the face of overwhelming odds. There
is in particular a detailed description of the way in which
under an inequitable system the middleman exploits the
handicraftsman; while the paralysing effect of the con-
stant fear, and the not infrequent fact, of being out of work
is grimly realised. No one who cares to un erstand realities

Not literature, but something
no reservations, I insist upon
the splendour of the history and
the beauty of the idea of this
book. It is the story of one
man's soul; not that big, white,

much more important.
Mr. St. John LucAs is an
author whose work I have
long watched with interest.
Amongst other things, he has
over which the modern de-
cadent does so much and so
tiresomely concern himself, but
the universal spirit of youth and
Spring, Earth and beauty, which
is born in all men, prematurely
dies or is deliberately crushed
in most, and remains vital
and dominant only in such sim-
ple “mad” fellows as Terence
O'Malley. It is, I say, a dream :
it is a thesis, an argument a
protest, almost a sermon on
the simple life; yet above all it
is a tale, a tale of adventure,
, and a very good tale, too, most
delicately and dramatically told.
How The Centaur comes into it
is Mr. BLAckwood's secret; he
will divulge it at exactly the

that rarest and most difficult
literary form, the really good
short story. Not of course that
the twelve tales in this volume
are all of the same high level
of achievement. They aren't.
But several of them, notably
“Expeditus” (the story of a

book so intrigued me as One of
the Multitude by GEORGE Acorn (HEINEMANN). It describes
the progress of a slum-child, by incredibly hard and squalid
ways, to the comparative haven of a self-respecting and
self-supporting manhood, shadowed with all the anxieties
of irregular employment and increasing responsibilities.
For a while I could not bring myself to believe in the
authenticity of it all, and even thought that the susceptible
Sage of the College Window, who writes an introduction,
was himself by way of hedging when he wrote: “I have
reason to believe, indeed to know, that the record is literally
and exactly true.” Anyway, a higher critic could readily
prove the thing a crude and stupid forgery, with its trivial
inexactitudes, its palpable improbabilities, the obvious sug-
gestions of derived as against direct observation, and such
profoundly false “literary” touches as “The way my
mother divided the loaves and fishes has left me a devout
believer in the miracle of the Galilean Sea.”—this of a
mother's capable distribution of a daily dole from the
Guardians of two loaves of bread added to the “occasional
kipper or haddock and touch of butter” bought by the

literature; while for the reader to whom pure literature
is rather an uncomfortable and alarming thing to handle
there is “The Statue of the Commander" to make him
smile, and “The Gorgon's Head” to make his flesh creep.
It is no use my trying to tell you the plot of any one of
these, because (except, perhaps, in the last, which is frankly
sensational, and works up to a climax that you had better
not read just before going to bed) the matter of Mr. Lucas's
tales is of far less importance than their manner. They
are always quite obviously the work of a poet who is also a
scholar; which is just what gives them their peculiar
quality and distinction. It will be interesting to see
whether the urade tradition that short stories never sell

OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[DECEMBER 6, 1911.
THERE is something on my mind, of
which I must relieve myself. If I am
ever to face the world again with a
smile I must share my trouble with
others. I cannot bear my burden alone.
Friends, I have lost my hat. Will
the gentleman who took it by mistake,
and forgot to leave his own in its place,
kindly return my hat to me at once 2
I am very miserable without my hat.
It was one of those nice soft ones with
a dent down the middle to collect the
rain; one of those soft hats which
wrap themselves so lovingly round the
cranium that they ultimately absorb
the personality of the wearer under-
neath, responding to his every emotion.
When people said nice things about
me my hat would swell in sympathy;
when they said nasty things, or when
I had had my hair cut, it would adapt
itself automatically to my lesser re-
quirements. In a word, it fitted-and
that is more than can be said for your
hard unyielding bowler. -
My hat and I dropped into a hall of
music one night last week. I placed
it under the seat, put a coat on it to
keep it warm, and settled down to
enjoy myself. My hat could see
nothing, but it knew that it would
hear all about the entertainment on
the way home. When the last moving
picture had moved away, my hat and I
prepared to depart together. I drew
out the coat and felt around for my
— Where on earth . . .
, I was calm it first.
“IXcuse me,” I said politely to the
man next to me, “but have you got
two hats 2'" " .
“Several,” he replied, mistaking my
meaning.
I dived under the seat again, and
came up with some more dust.
“Someone," I said to a programme
girl, “has taken my hat.”
, “Have you looked under the seat for
it 2 " she asked. -
It was such a sound suggestion that
I went under the seat for the third
time. -
“It may have been kicked further
along," suggested another attendant.
She walked up and down the row
looking for it and, in case somebody
had kicked it into the row above,
walked up and down that one too; and,
in case somebody had found touch with
it on the other side of the house, many
other girls spread themselves in pursuit;
and soon we had the whole pack
hunting for it.
Then the fireman came up, suspecting
the worst. I told him it was even
worse than that—my hat had been
stolen.
He had a flash of inspiration.
“Are you sure you brought it with
you?" he asked.
The programme girls seemed to think
that it would solve the whole mystery
if I hadn't brought it with me.
“Are you sure you are the fireman?”
I said coldly.
He thought for a moment, and then
unburdened himself of another idea.
“Perhaps it's just been kicked under
the seat," he said.
I left him under the seat and went
downstairs with a heavy heart. At the
door I said to the hall porter, “Have
you seen anybody going out with two
hats by mistake 2 "
“What's the matter 2"
“Lost your hat?”
“It has been stolen.”
“Have you looked under the seats?
It may have been kicked along a bit.”
“Perhaps I'd better see the manager,”
I said. “Is it any good looking under
the seats for him * '' º -
“I expect it's just been kicked along
a bit,” the hall porter repeated con-
fidently. “I’ll come up with you and
look for it.” -
“If there's any more talk about
being kicked along a bit,” I said
bitterly, “somebody will be. I want the
manager.”
I was led to the manager's room,
and there I explained the matter to
him. He was very pleasant about it.
“I expect you haven't looked for it
properly,” he said, with a charming
smile. “Just take this gentleman up,”
he added to the hall porter, “and find
his hat for him. It has probably been
kicked under one of the other seats."
We were smiled irresistibly out, and
I was dragged up to the grand circle
again. The seats by this time were
laid out in white draperies; the house
looked very desolate; I knew that my
poor hat was dead.
With an air of cheery confidence the
hall porter turned into the first row of
seats. . . . -
“It may have been kicked on to the
stage,” I said, as he began to slow
down. “It may have jumped into one
of the boxes. It may have turned into
a rabbit. You know, I expect you
aren't looking for it properly.”
The manager was extremely sym-
pathetic when we came back to him.
He said, “Oh, I'm sorry.” Just like
that—“Oh, I'm sorry.”
“My hat,” I said firmly, “has been
stolen.”
“I'm sorry,” he repeated with a
bored smile, and turned to look at him-
self in the glass.
Then I became angry with him and
his attendants and his whole blessed
theatre.
lie said.
“My hat,” I said bitingly, “has been
stolen from me—while I slept.”
… -- + -- --
You must have seen me wearing it
in the dear old days. Greeny brown it
was in colour; but it wasn't the colour
that drew your eyes to it—no, nor yet
the shape, nor the angle at which it sat.
It was just the essential rightness of it.
If you have ever seen a bat which you
felt instinctively was a clever hat, an
alive hat, a profound hat, then that was
my hat—and that was myself under-
neath it. A. A. M.

John Stone had never made a bet in

UNCH, OR THE LONDON
CIIARIVARI.
THE SONGS OF PANTOMIME.
Now that the days are growing
short, while, on the other hand, the
nights lengthen, it is time to turn
our thoughts to the Pantomime Song.
In what mellifluous words will the
Principal Boy woo the favours of the
high gods? With what surging chorus
will the Wicked Uncle set the gallery
in a roar 2 By what insidious strain
will the Princess extract salt tears from
the upper circle? And so on.
All these questions, and many others,
can be answered to-day.
The Principal Boy will this year
have a wide choice of Ballads of
Passionate Devotion, but we venture
to prophesy that none will prove more
justly popular than the refined and
haunting composition entitled “Love
Only,” of which the following is the
refrain :-
Only I ask to love you,
Only I long for you :
As the stars that shine above you
In the trustful heavens are true,
Thus is my heart so faithful,
So tender and so fond,
Yea, as the stars on high make bright
the sky
In the infinite vast Beyond.
As the discriminating reader will
observe from the extract given above,
this song is worded with such skilful
judgment that no sense of incongruity
in the matter of sex is aroused in the
mind of the auditor, since the senti-
ments here so beautifully expressed
quantity of
may be regarded as appropriate to
either of the two great divisions of
humanity. -
How different to these sentiments
are those contained in the rollicking
catch, “Me and My Old Pal,” which is
certain to have a deservedly enormous
vogue. We have little sympathy with
those superior persons who may be
expected to raise the parrot-cry of
“Vulgarity' " or to complain that the
words of the chorus quoted below
form an incentive to intemperance.
We would point out that legitimate
tastes must be catered for, and that
at the Festive Season there are certain
National Traditions which must be
respected, even in an age when exces-
sive drinking is happily démodé. May
not the Pantomime, we would ask,
foster a true patriotism in this respect
by awakening among the people a spirit
of historical continuity? Thus are Em-
pires built up. It is a great thought.
I stood my Old Pal a drink,
And he stood one to me,
And we kept on standing each other drinks
All night so merrily ;
I stood one and he stood one,
Till we scarcely could drink for yawning,
And we sat there boozing when we ought
to be snoozing
Till the milkman came in the morning.
“The Dream ” is the title given to
an exquisite song which will moisten
the cheeks of many a Pit. It may
interest our readers to know that the
outbreak of hostilities between Turkey
and Italy was directly responsible for
its composition. The author was
walking in East London during the
early days of the war when he saw a
boy being furiously bombarded by an
indignant organ-grinder, who employed,
among other missiles, a small monkey.
It transpired later that the youth had
offended the patriotic susceptibilities
of his assailant by consuming a
Turkish Delight with
deliberate offensiveness under the very
nose of the exasperated Italian. Despite
the violent mature of the onslaught,
however, the boy's countenance wore
an amused smile. This incident made
a deep impression upon the observer,
and the idea thus planted germinated
to such purpose that within a few days
“The Dream ” was completed.
We have space to print the opening
stanza only, but it will serve to indicate
the profound passion and tenderness of
the whole —
I dreamed that I saw him standing
In the furious battle-place,
While shells were bursting about him
And swords were grazing his face;
But a smile was on his features—
A smile that was sweet to see,
For I knew as he stood in that River of Blood
He was thinking only of me.
The Topical Song, always so fas-
cinating to pantomime audiences, pre-
sents at this stage a rather curious
appearance in print. Reflection, how-

“I HAVE come shopping,” said I.
“One cannot shop in a post-office,”
said the official. -
“Think again,” I answered.
“We have here,” he confessed, “some

I purchased a stamp.
“We have here,”
“some postal orders.”
“There ! ” I exclaimed, “I knew one
could really shop in a post office, if
one tried hard enough. How much
are the telegraph forms?”
He admitted, with reluctance, that
they were free.
“I will take a dozen gross,” said I.
“And now,” I continued, “I will tell
you what I really came for. I want
the Greenwich mean time, please.” I
happened to know that a consignment
of this is sent every day to every post-
office in the kingdom.
He leant over the counter and spoke
very distinctly.
“You want,” said he, “the Green-
wich mean time 2''
“Yes,” I said, “the best and the
meanest Greenwich.”
“There it is,” he said, pointing to the
clock.
“Quite so,” I agreed. “I want it.”
He had the appearance of a man
who did not know what to do next.
“Moreover,” I added, “if you will
assure me that it is the genuine
article, and not a cheap London imi-
tation, I am prepared to pay any price
for it.”
To occupy myself pleasantly while
he debated what course he should
adopt, I examined my own watch.
“But look you here,” I exclaimed,
with just anger, “your precious Green-
wich mean is no better than Wimbledon

He could not dispute it.
“In that case,” I told him
dignantly, “you can keep it.”

THE AWAKENING OF ENGLAND.
Squire (who has dropped in on a heated argument as to the chances of war ºrith Germany). “THAT Is ALL very well, BUT surrosi No.

Spokesman. “NAY, THAT BAINT PossiblE, SQUIRE, BECAUSE WHAT we says Is—'Ow ARE THEY GoING To GET PAST GIBERALTEI: "
ADVICE TO THE ADMIRALS.
DEAR MR. EDITor, As a wife—
and, may I add, a mother?—I am so
glad that that dear Mr. CHURCHILL has
made some new Admirals to look after
the Navy that we all love so well. I
must say that I was not at all satisfied
with the other Admirals. I do hope
the new ones will introduce some
much needed reforms.
I do not think the Committee was
at all kind to my dear Hubert, after he
had been quite a long time at Osborne,
too, and never been seasick once, and
such a clever boy at managing a boat.
My dear Hubert is full of true British
pluck, and looked so well in his
uniform, and I do not think the last
lot of Admirals need have insisted so
much on examinations. How much
trignometry did the great Lord NELSON
know, I should like to ask.
Then I think the Committee (am I
right in calling it a Committee’?) has
not remembered as it ought that it
carries a vast load of responsibility in
regard to the young lives entrusted to
its care. Many of the sailors—brave
fellows –on our battleships are really
little more than boys, and, as I know
from experience, some of their chests
are not at all strong; and I do not
think this going out to sea in all
weathers is at all good for them. I
mean that when the Germans do come
we shall want all our sailors nice and
strong to be able to fight them, shan't
we ? Well, nothing is so weakening
as a nasty cold.
I shock my dear husband sometimes
by saying that I really feel inclined to
become a Militant Suffragette. Of
course I would never dream of doing
that really, but I do think that women
could help in some ways in governing
our grand old England, and I certainly
think that, admirable as Mr. CHURCHILL
has shown himself to be, he would have
won even more approval if he had
appointed at least one woman to advise
the new Admirals, not so much about
how to fire the guns and send the ships
straight and that kind of thing, but
about the brave sailors' food and
clothes, and the little comforts that
mean so much to them when they are
far away from home joys. Perhaps, Mr.
Editor, if you would put my sugges-
tion in your very readable paper, which
my dear husband and I always borrow
whenever we can, it might do some good.
Yours, very sincerely,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRAcTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Novem-
ber 27.-One does not remember a time
when simple-manner speech unadorned
enjoyed such triumph as was achieved
to-night by Edward GREY. Occasion
one of the great epochs in career of
a statesman. There was for audience
not only crowded House and ex-
pectant British public. In Gallery
over Clock were gathered Ambassadors
of all the Great Powers, with con-
spicuous exception of France and
Germany. These being the countries
most directly concerned in question at
issue, their Representatives agreed, upon
point of etiquette, to abstain from at-
tendance. But in company with the
other nations of the earth France and
Germany were listening at the door,
eager to catch the words falling from
lips of British Minister.
It was, in brief, a rare occasion, to
which ordinary Minister would have
risen elate. Easy to imagine the sonor-
ous phrases with which GLADSTONE
would have embroidered the story and
the glowing peroration that would have
closed it. Edward GREY had evidently
carefully prepared his statement setting
forth Foreign Policy of this country in
connection with the Moroccan Ques-
tion; but it was equally devoid of orna-
mentation and peroration. He was
there to tell a plain story, and he did not
halt by the way to pluck flowers or to

felt as he proceeded how completely
he carried with him the conviction of
his audience that he was concealing
nothing.
To a Ministry at a crisis such as that
gone through in the last three months
the price of a colleague such as Edward
GREY is above rubies. When he re-
sumed his seat there was no disposi-
tion shown in any part of House to
question, even to discuss, his statement
or the policy of the Government he
represented. The late GEongE WASH-
INGTON, U.S.A., was not more ac-
customed by long habit to compel
absolute acceptance of the truth of his
assertions.
MEMBER For SARK in his pragmatical
way takes narrow view of situation. It
suggests to him how much time would
be saved and to what extent life would
be lengthened if all business, from
diplomacy to drapery, were conducted
on basis of veracity. In diplomatic
conversation and correspondence the
parties in turn exhaust themselves in
effort at guessing how much truth may
be contained in a particular declaration.
Till he was found out BISMARCK was
accustomed to get the better of his
adversary by, upon occasion, telling the
simple truth. That being wholly un-
expected the other fellow was tem-
porarily led astray. Now here is
EDWARD GREY talking for an hour and
twenty minutes on a delicate intricate
international question and everyone
instinctively knows that he is simply
telling the truth.

than may be categorically stated.

THE NIEWEST PORTRAITURE.
PhotoGRAPHY having led the way
with the recent movement in favour of
Spot-on-the-landscape pictures (where-
in the figure of the sitter is treated only
as a detail in the composition), it is
rumoured that portrait-painting is now
to go one better. We gather that a
forthcoming exhibition of the First-
past-the-post-impressionists will con-
tain several examples of the new
method, whose object is said to be
to suggest the personality rather than
present the actual person of the
subject.
Thus, in No. 46 “Miss Daisy Denti-
frice of the Frivolity Theatre,” though
the features of this popular and talented
young actress do not themselves appear
upon the canvas, her presence is con-
veyed to the spectator with remarkable
subtlety and force in the aspect of the
first three rows of the Frivolity stalls,
as it has been caught by the artist.
The ecstatic gaze of the occupants,
their fixed smiles and eager hands, all
combine to produce an effect of actu-
ality far greater than anything that
could be attained by mere conventional
portraiture. The spectator is left with
the impression that if he has not
actually seen Miss Dentifrice herself,
he has at least had a very narrow
escape of doing so.
No. 47, a companion work to this,
by the same artist, is an equally
striking study of The Rev. Longwind
Spalding—a presentation work, which
has, we understand, been subscribed
for by the congregation and church-
wardens of St. Somnolent's, Chelsea.
Here the rather cold treatment of the
architectural setting is finely contrasted
with the pew-full of semi-recumbent
figures in the foreground. The-whole
effect is a realization of the rev. gentlo-
man's tireless and impressive per-
sonality such as for once deserves the
often misplaced epithet of a “speaking
likeness. By a regrettable blunder the
picture was originally catalogued as
“Tired Nature's Sweet Restorer”; but
we are glad to see that the error has
been timely perceived, and that this very
striking example of the New Portraiture
is now given its correct title, as
above.
Yet another exceedingly happy
achievement is No. 111, Sir Jacob
Bumpus, Bart. The sensation of a just-
finished interview with the distinguished
City magnate and financier could indeed
hardly be better conveyed than it is
here, by what is at first sight a simple
study in still life. Gradually, however,
the subtle treatment of the closed
door, marked Private and obviously
still quivering from its recent banging
behind the master, produces its effect
upon the observer. Silence, the palpable
silence that follows the last word of
authority, is in every line of the picture.
So masterly is the handling of this
that the eye scarcely needs such con-
tributory details as the torn ledger—
some error in which has obviously but
a moment before raised Sir Jacob's
justly-famous indignation—or the en-
larged tail of the office cat protruding
from beneath an overturned desk in
the foreground. The man, one feels,
has been there—and of what ordinary
portrait could the same be truthfully
said 2 As a remarkable study of a
forceful and impetuo.3 personality,
No. 111 well deserves the attention
that it will certainly receive.
Perhaps, however, the gem of the
whole collection is to be found in
No. 396, Henrietta, wife of John
Smallweed, Esq. By an interesting
converse of the method followed in
the previous example, the artist has
here found his conception of his sub-
ject in the opening door that heralds
her arrival. The movement of this,

THE GOOSE OPERA.
WE had heard so much of them,
their intelligence, their operatic in-
stinct, their adaptability to the condi-
tions of bird-life as understood on the
Covent Garden stage. They represented
the chief motive, so we gathered, of
HUMPERDINck's new opera; his heroine
was a goose-girl; he had written his
work round them. And they practically
did nothing. In the Second Act they
appeared in the background beyond the
town gates, lingered for a few moments,
but took no intelligent interest in the
action of the drama (except that one
stood on his toes and flapped his
wings), and then stampeded into the
right wing. According to the stage
directions they were to be a marked
feature of the opening of the First Act.
“Twelve wild geese,” so I read, “are
scattered about. Some are splashing
in the pond [there was no pond except
a painted one where you couldn't
splash] ; others are plucking at the
grass, and others are smoothing down
their feathers with their bills.” If they
did all this, it must have been behind
the Witch's house or the pump, for they
were barely noticeable from my stall.
One, a grey goose, had been selected
for special duty. He was to receive
the King's Son's crown on his neck
and secrete it till required. None of
the highly trained corps was found
equal to the task, and a dummy had to
be substituted. Altogether, as an
exhibition of animate poultry, the show
was very disappointing.
As for the other birds, I cannot
write about them without an emotion
of pain. Such instructions as “A
turtle-dove flies out of the hole in the
trunk of the linden-tree and pecks at the
window of the hut,” or “more doves fly
round the Fiddler,” were totally ignored.
A strong effort, it is true, was made by
one dummy to simulate the “gobbling
up” of millet-seed, but it took the form
of saltatory spasms, during which his
beak never came within practicable
distance of the ground. Their subse-
quent flight was executed on the well-
known wire-system, the effect being
prolonged in one case by a desolating
hitch in mid-air. When will Signor
MARCONI invent a wireless bird for
operatic use?
Before passing from the subject of
stage-properties, I must mention the
Witch's poisoned “loaf" (or “cake” or
“pasty”), which directly caused the
death of the starving Königskinder. In
the First Act, having been cooked in
cold water at an incredible pace, it had
the semblance of a large white chalk-
stone. By the Third Act it had
matured in colour, and looked like a
colossal railway-station bun. Nothing
short of the claims of deadly hunger
could have given the Königskinder the
frenzied strength required for the
breaking and chewing of it. In such
cases I prefer a doctored beverage as
being more in the spirit of romance.
How should we have felt if Tristan
and Isolde, instead of drinking together
from what they took to be a poisoned
cup, had shared a physicked railway-
station bun ? . - -
The plot of Königskinder is of the most
unsatisfactory. The impossibilities of
fairyland magic I accept with proper
resignation; but on the human side
I like a fair show of reasonableness.
Here I never could make out how the
Goose-girl came to be of royal blood
if her parentage on both sides was

connected with the hangman's trade.
The Fiddler's cryptic statement (which
I translate literally) leaves me still won-
dering. “The hangman's daughter,”
says he, “and the hangman's assistant
were genuinely royal (königsecht) in
their loves and sorrows.” However,
her pedigree did not matter much,
though, since the opera has the name
Königskinder, it would be pleasant to
know what right she really had to be
one of them. But, what was far worse,
I could not discover why the King's
Son ever left his home to wander about
in rags; nor why nobody could re-
cognise him from his portraits in one
of his own towns; nor why he couldn't
find his way home again when he tried
to; nor why, if his father was dead some
months ago, as the Argument asserts,
he is worried because he cannot get
back to hold his hand (zur Waterhand).
When one is asked to weep over a
tragedy, one likes to know where one is
in regard to the material facts that lead
up to it. Here the whole scheme is
wantonly obscure and arbitrary; and
the best music in the world cannot
compel emotions from which the
reasoning powers of a rabbit would
revolt. -
HUMPERDINCK's music, fresh and
sincere, was duly mixed of sweetness
and strength, and was always faithfully
interpreting the action without de-
laying it. But it spent itself wastefully
on an artificial theme. The most
appealing feature of the opera was the
pathetic loyalty of one child (played
with a charming docility by little Miss
BECKLEY) who, when all others save
the Fiddler were incredulous, had the
instinct to recognise the royalty of
the King's Son, and held staunchly
by him to the end.
As the Goose-girl, Frau GURA-
HUMMEL sang cleanly and sympatheti-
cally; but the text stipulated that she
should be fourteen (I speak of years, not
stone-weight), and she looked more than
that. In the First Act, where youth and
irresponsibility were demanded, Herr
OTTo Wolf, in the part of the King's
Som, took himself too Wagneresquely.
My suspicions of him, as a sportsman,
were aroused by the length of his hair,
and confirmed by the careless way in
which he threw his cross-bow down on
the hard boards. His interlude with
the little girl who invited him to dance
a Rosenringel with her was very at-
tractive. But I had more joy of the
voice and personality of Herr HoFBAUER
as the Fiddler, though his air of noisy
good-nature in the First Act gave no
promise of the poetic feeling which he
subsequently developed. Herr FöNss
and Herr BECHSTEIN provided a subsi-
diary touch or two of humour in the
Teutonic vein.
The scenery was excellent—in par-
ticular the wintry landscape of the
last Act. Here the effect of the
temperature upon the performers was
spasmodic. At one time they could
think of nothing but their cold hands; at
another they behaved as if it were jolly
boating weather with the glass at 70
degrees Fahrenheit. The falling snow,
too, was very desultory and partial.
I sometimes wonder why makers of
opera never have the courage to invent
weather that is out of accord with the
sentiment of their dramatic situations.
Of course I know that, if your people
have to starve, winter is the best season
for a lack of food-supplies; and if you
must cover their corpses with snow you
have practically very little choice of
seasons. Yet I cannot help feeling
that a bright crisp autumn day would
have been more effective, giving a
pleasant note of irony to the funeral
proceedings. O. S.

A FOREIGN LEADER.
I can't help it: I must write a leading article on foreign
affairs. My head is so full of noble phrases; I see in my
mind's eye so many Chancellors, Prime Ministers, Foreign
Ministers, Naval Ministers and Chancellors of the Ex-
chequer, and they are all shouting and changing and writing
and orating at so great a length and in such resonant,
nation-shaking voices that, unless I get them out of my
head, I shall certainly go mad and be prosecuted for running
about the December landscape clothed only in loose sheets
of The Times, the Journal des Débats and the Frankfurter
Zeitung. I am compelled, therefore, to write a strong,
patriotic, calm, stimulating and perfectly impartial leading
article.
I shall not write this article for any particular paper, for
I am not, I am proud to say, connected with any particular
paper. Nor shall I send it to any paper on approval after
it 's done. I have no ambitions of that kind, and I don't
want any of their money. What I shall write I shall write
for its own sake and for mine.
One thing troubles me a little, and that is that I don't
know anything about foreign affairs, except what I've read
casually. I'm not behind the scenes. I've never met
even the third cousin of an attaché or the great-uncle of a
First Secretary. I only know what the man-in-the-street
knows. However, I don't think that matters much. If I
can manage to be at the same time pompous, scornful,
deprecating, sagacious, uplifted and omniscient, I know I
shall get on all right. All I have got to do is to wipe out
Germany in a sentence and to support France by three
strong and well-rounded paragraphs. There's another
special point: if I want to refer broadly to the German
Government I mustn't call them the German Government;
I must say “the Wilhelmstrasse is again attempting to put
us off with the usual pitiful plea." Doesn't it sound
gorgeous? I feel much better already. -
Similarly if I wish to refer to Austria—I don't quite see
where she comes in, but still I might want to refer to her;
you never know where these experts in foreign affairs are
going to take you to next—if, as I say, I wish to speak about
Austria I have a choice of two alternatives. I can call her
“the Dual Monarchy,” or I can get a snub in by speaking
of her as “the Ballplatz." It sounds like a sneezing game,
but it isn't. It's just another name for Austria-Hungary—
until this moment I had forgotten all about Hungary, which
shows how careful one has to be.
Then there's France. It sounds rather impudent just
to call her France. If there's anything that's clearly
required by the entente cordiale it is this : that France,
when foreign affairs are sur le tapis—how insensibly one
slips into that beautiful language—must be referred to as
the Quai d'Orsay.
As to Italy, of course we don't need to bother about her.
If she hadn't gone to Tripoli to teach dead Arabs at the
point of the bayonet how to become good and humane and
civilised Italian subjects, we might have had to speak of her
as “the Quirinal,” or “ the third and not least illustrious
member of the Triple Alliance: ” but now she's in Tripoli
with about 50,000 of her best Generals and she really
doesn't count.
As to Russia, I know exactly what to say about her.
She 's “the Colossus of the North '' whom it would be
stark, staring lunacy for the Germans to arouse. She may
move slowly, but think of the masses she can bring into
line—“hordes of fierce riders from the Ukraine” and all
that sort of thing. -
Then there 's Britain. She 's got no special pet name
like the others, but she 's all there none the less. The
thing to say is that Germans (wilfully and blindly, poor
beggars!) misunderstand us:—“The Wilhelmstrasse may
know much, but the nature of the British people is a
sealed book to the distorted vision of the IMPERIAL
CHANCELLOR. Those who mistake our calm for careless-
ness and see in the stern resolution of our attitude only
an intention to abandon our friendships are preparing
for themselves a rude awakening. The Ballplatz is too
wise to be deceived by the clumsy attempts of those who
have reckoned without the lucid explanations which have
lately emanated " (hurrah for “emanated"—it's a topping
word || “from the Quai d'Orsay. No one knows better
than the politicians of the Dual Monarchy what it means
when once the Colossus of the North begins to move.
Even FREDERICK THE GREAt ” But there, I've got
them all in already. I shall finish the article to-night.
SIGNS OF WEAR.
[“When anyone finds himself worrying as to what clothes he shall put
on, or what hat he shall wear, or which stick he shall carry . . . , he may
be pretty certain that for some reason or another his nervous energy has
become exhausted."—Merres and the Nerrors.] -
BELLA, when yester-morning's post
Brought me your charming invitation,
My manly breast became the host
Of an unusual sensation.
You bade me come that afternoon to tea; -
So I resolved to knock off work at three.
I3ut so unsettled was my brain
And so demoralised my mind's tone,
I could not, for my life, constrain
My nasal organ to the grindstone;
All day, revolving in my office chair,
I found myself debating what to wear.
First came a trying choice of suits
In re My Person v. The Weather,
And then the claims of glacé boots
As against shoes of patent leather:
An hour or so elapsed ere I could fix
On one of half-a-dozen walking-sticks.
And when, abominably late,
I burst on you in all my glory,
And you appeared disposed to rate,
I spun a most unblushing story:
My love, I swore, had urged me look my best :
And you believed, and hugged my fancy vest.
But, dearest, since I cannot slay
My conscience, with extreme compunction
I must request you not to lay
To your sweet soul that flattering unction:
I own 'tis no affection of the heart
Of which these curious symptoms are a part:
Nor yet a craving to compete
With those who fix the fashion's season;
Flsewhere my trouble has its seat:
If you would learn the actual reason
Of any change in me your eye observes,
Refer, my love, to Thingumbob on Nerves.
“Vile Plays at Cambridge,” is the heading of a foot-
ball article in The Western Mail. The matter is all right,
for Mr. WILE did undoubtedly play for Newport against
the University, but the form of it is in questionable taste
at this moment when so much attention is being paid to
the new Censor of Plays.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM tempted to describe CAROLINE GRosvexor's new
novel, Laura (HEINEMANN), as a good, sound story, medium
dry, with a fine nutty flavour, and a pleasant after-taste.
It is about persons who are most of them alive, if perhaps
not very agreeably so. Laura herself, the best drawn and
most attractive figure, is a young person who starts life
with several unromantic and practical theories as to the
relative values of sentiment and a bank balance. But in
fiction, when you find a heroine so emphatic at the start in her
preference for Paris frocks and a reliable cook, you may still
assume with safety that the last chapter will see her plump-
ing for love in a cottage. Which, of course, is what happens
to Laura ; though just how I will leave you to discover for
yourself. There is decided cleverness in the way in which
the impecunious girl, who sighed for an income and power
—as represented by a marriage with the rising politician
Lord Westown—is made to give up both, refusing Westown
and renouncing the fortune left her by old David Cumming,
at the bidding of the better nature whose existence she has
all along studiously denied. One can't help caring a little
for Laura ; but the rest seem to me, as I say, rather a
shabby lot. By the way, I was amused to discover a very
subordinate character named Charlotte Verrinder—a lady
whom I last met enjoying devilled oysters in The
Magistrate: Probably the name is an instance of uncon-
scious cerebration on Mrs. Grosvenor's part; certainly
the combination is one unlikely to have been invented by
two writers independently. -
How Zuleika Dobson (HEINEMANN), of the music-hall
stage, came to Oxford and, on the last night of the Eights,'
proved herself, like Helen of Troy, “a hell to ships and
men,” is told by Mr. MAX BEERBoHM with a daring cynicism
all his own. The other protagonist is the Duke of Dorset,
in statu pupillari. Peerless both, they have hitherto gone
through the world conquering and to conquer; yet ever
have remained “passionless 'mid their passionate votaries."
Humiliated by the emotions which Zuleika , excites —
cmotions that he has never before permitted himself to
experience—he declines to give any sign of his subjugation.
But her frank confession that she is uniquely enamoured
of him as being the sole man who has ever ignored her
charms, leads to an admission, on his part, of the true state
of his feelings. The spell is broken : he has become a
common thing in her eyes. But he can still undertake
to die for her, a tribute of affection which she gladly
accepts with the determination to keep him to his
promise. The Duke is the glass of fashion and his
intentions, rapidly bruited abroad, find an infatuate
echo in the universal dark-blue breast, all Oxford vowing to
follow his example and die for love of Zuleika. But the
Duke's ancestral motto is Pas si béte, and his pride, stung
by the lady's callous brutality, revolts against a pledge
that would cut him off in the flower of his beautiful man-
hood. Resolved, after all, to disappoint Zuleika and

receipt of the following telegram from his family butler:
“Deeply regret inform your grace last night two black owls

presage of the death of the owner of the title. The

reply-paid form : “Prepare vault for funeral Monday
DoRSET.”
I have one or two complaints to make of this fascinating
book. I think it was a mistake to attempt to develop a
purely farcical idea on the lines of a full-sized novel. The
charm of MAx's literary caprices endures to the last, but the
story as a story falls off before the finish. I am doubtful too
whether he was justified in introducing magic (in the matter of
. . . . Theocritus has spread for us above the stone-pines
on the hills of Greece.” May I be permitted to remind
Mr. Arnold Leveson that THEocRITUs was born at Syracuse,
and that his songs are songs of Sicily 2 Nor am I at all
certain that a really scholarly work on THEocritus would be
likely to capture the affections of a charming English girl,
who should certainly have married her cousin Walter, even
if a steam-roller had to be requisitioned in the last chapter
to help her. And that, of course, would have made
Juggernaut such a splendid title for the book.
As the title of Mr. JUSTIN McCARTHY's latest book, Irish
Recollections (Hodder AND STOUGHToN), indicates, the area
of his review is limited to his native country. Consequently
there are lacking those personal touches of life in London
which he was in peculiar degree qualified to give. One of
the most interesting chapters is that dealing with the

absenteelandlord, to whose neg-
farcical, of human interest, and
modern at that. But his worst
fault is to have played to the
bitter end his practical joke of
suicide. It seems rather cheap
and easy to employ your humour
on a theme which by common
consent forbids the trespass of
frivolity. It is a little like
the school-boy trick of letting
out a rabbit in church. But
MAx's manner, if any manner
could, almost palliates this
breach of propriety. It is ru-
moured that Zuleika is the
carefully revised work of earlier
years; and certainly, both in
this matter of taste and in the
archaistic methods which from
time to time he affects (for

consent, in a condition of pros-
perity unequalled in its history.
To this happy conclusion Mr.
McCARTHY has the satisfaction
When Mr. E. F. BENSON
wrote Juggernaut in serial form
for The Queen he finished it off with a felicitous fall
of masonry at Athens, which wiped out the principal male
figure in the story. Whether Mr. HEINEMANN, his pub-
lisher, cons dered this catastrophe too crude for book-form
I cannot say, but anyhow it has been omitted, and the novel
ends tamely enough; the disillusioned wife, who has found
her husband's passion for scholarship greater than his love
for her, deciding that she must make up for this deficiency
by an access of devotion on her own side. Personally I
am sorry for the change of ending, because, with a con-
siderable experience of objectionable characters in romance,
I am inclined to award the palm, or oleaster-wreath, if he
prefers it, to Mr. Arnold Leveson ; and why on earth a nice
girl like Marjory (one of the nicest Mr. BENsoN has ever
given us) should have fallen in love with this cold and con-
ceited egotist, goodness alone knows. So heartily indeed
do I dislike him that I am disposed to cavil even at his
literary reputation. At the beginning of Juggernaut
he is writing a beautiful book about THEockitus, passages
from which complete his conquest of Marjory's heart; yet
in one place he speaks of “the shepherd-boys minding their
flocks upon Attic hills,” and in another of “the vault which

of knowing that by his public
life and parliamentary career he
sensibly contributed. The sombre picture of Ireland prior to
legislation commenced in 1868 is relieved by the flashing of
many good stories illustrative of native character.
Mrs. Wilson Fox contrives to make Sir Thoxi.As MoRE
and his numerous family live again in The Baron's Heir
(MACMILLAN), where she lays the earlier scenes of her story
at Gobions, which belonged to the MoRE family from 1397
to 1530. Faithfully she has reproduced the language and
atmosphere of the period, and the contrast between the life of
such enlightened people as the MoREs and that of the rude
barons is admirably shown. We have also a pleasing sketch
of HENRY VIII., which will astonish those who have come
to regard him merely as a monarch with an eclectic taste
in the matter of queens; and above all there is a well-kept
secret. Possibly Mrs. Fox insists overmuch upon the
lessons she wishes to teach; but this is a small blemish in a
sound book. Sensible girls will, I am sure, be glad to add
it to their stock of Christmas presents, for although it
contains a love-story in the bud there is no sentimental
twaddle, and the author rightly thinks that nothing but the
best she can give is good enough for children.

A DEAN TO HIS TWEENY.
(Not necessarily the Dean of St. Paul's.)
THE trivial accident of birth
Which, in our fleeting lives on earth,
Tends to outweigh intrinsic worth
Has severed you and me by quite a distance;
Not often, save at family prayer,
Where all may breathe a common air,
Have I been sensibly aware
Of your obscure and underground existence.
On such occasions, if your mind,
Mostly to menial tasks resigned,
Has for a moment left behind
The duties incident to daily dinners,
It may have very well occurred
That your arrested ears have heard
Some Scriptural passage which referred
In the same breath to “publicans and sinners.”
Whene'er the phrase your fancy caught,
I blame you little if your thought
(Of ancient parlance recking naught)
Pictured a publican as one who waxes
Fat on the sale of stout and beer,
A man of alcoholic cheer
Due to a bibulous career,
And not a person given to gathering taxes.
But whether you conceived that he,
Mixing with men of low degree,
No better than they ought to be,
Issued demand-notes or purveyed strong liquor,
The bare idea that such a name
Could be applied to me (for shame!)
Would flush your brow with honest flame
And cause your weltering heart to creak like wicker.
Yet that reproach I soon must win'
'Tis true I shall not keep an inn
Where men consort for joy of sin,
Where for a Bacchic rout the barman caters;
But still, for so the horror gripes,
If I could choose from these two types,
I'd almost sooner deal in swipes
Than stoop to tax-collecting (O my gaiters!).
To think that I should so demean
The gifts on which my clergy lean'
That I, a scholar and a dean,
To whose instructive guidance (under Heaven) you
Owe all you have of inward light,
Should be reduced to this low plight,
And have to spend my sermon-night
2xtracting threepenny-bits from out your revenue !
So runs the Bill that now is sent

A CHINESE LEADER.
To-DAY I am going to write a leading article on Chinese
affairs. When events so tremendous are happening, and
when they are so intimately connected with gorgeous and
high-sounding names it would be a coward s part to refuse
to deal with them. One thing I must observe by way of
preliminary: I do not guarantce the spelling of any single
name that I shall use, whether it be the name of a district,
a town, or a man. All I am certain of is that my names
will be just as good and instructive as the most accurate
names that the most learned Chinese scholar could devise.
My own impression is that these Chinese name. have no
real existence in humanity or geography, but that cor-
respondents and leader-writers invent them as they go
along to fill up gaps and give verisimilitude to an other-
wise bald and unconvincing narrative. At that game I
am ready to meet them on their own ground. Forward,
then, my trusty pen and my well-filled ink-bottle, and le!
us get to work:-
“Affairs in the Celestial Empire seem to be going from
bad to worse. Yesterday we published in elligence that
the sacred City of Kunchau, long renowned as the seat of
Chinese Imperial culture, has been four times recaptured by
the revolutionaries after having been twice sacked and twice
burnt by the loyalists under the command of the veteran
Min-Choo-IXio. To-day comes the grave news that Pin-
Tong has fallen for the seventh time aſter an heroic re-
sistance of five hours. It is true that British and American
missionaries are reported to be marching in overwhelming
force to the relief of Foo-Loo, but the movement is tardy,
and, in any case, the destruction of the bridges over the
Yangtse-Kiang must throw insuperable obstacles in the
way of this column. The whole of the fertile province of
Lun-Chon has thus fallen into the power of the Republicans,
and recruits, some wearing the purple button, are said to
be flocking to their standard.
Under these disastrous conditions no course but
immediate ſlight would seem to be open to the Tsung-
Li-Yamen. The Regent is in tears, while the Child-
Emperor has issued his nineteenth cdict pleading for
forgiveness on the ground of his tender age, and promising,
if the Revolutionaries will retire, to see that their demands
are immediately incorporated in the Chinese constitution.
It is not likely that the fierce and exultant warriors, who
have seen the hosts of the green-and-yellow jackets flying
in confusion from Hy-Son and Oo-Long, will be satisfied
with verbal promises. Indeed, Pi-Jon-Pi, their leader, has
intimated his intention of inflicting the punishment of the
Thousand Slices on the Emperor, the Regent, and their
General, Yuan-Shi-Ki. The struggle has thus become one
of life and death, and those who wish well to China can
only hope that the Ming dynasty will be allowed to have a
fall as bloodless as the circumstances will allow. Some
punishment there must be, but those who know SUN-
YAT-SEN best are confident that he will not disgrace
the triumph of his cause by inflicting unnecessary
pain on those who have not hitherto seen eye to eye with
him. One thing alone is certain : China is crumbling to
pieces, and no hand seems strong enough to arrest the
process of decay. With the republicans in undisputed
possession of Man-Hang, Woon-Ki-Bong and Pol-Kang it
is hopeless for the Court to resist with effect any longer.
By taking refuge in Jehol they may postpone the evil
moment, but they cannot possibly avert it.”
How does that strike you? For my part, I am amazed
at my close acquaintance with Chinese customs and Chinese
nomenclature. But the fact is, nobody can know, until he
tries, how easy it is to write a Chinese leader.

COMING HOME TO GET
MARRIED.
(With acknowledgments to the author
of “Going Out to get Married,” in “The
Daily Chronicle” of December 5th.)
MARRIAGE is at best a lottery. But
marriage of which the preliminary
period is robbed by distance of its
opportunities for mutual knowledge is
beset with terrific perils. An Anglo-
Indian or Anglo-Burmese engagement
means usually two or three years of
love-making by letter only; and though
the pen may be mightier than the
sword it is no less dangerous a weapon.
Hong Kong, British Columbia, or Aust-
ralia often sever betrothed couples for
four or five years, when it would be far
better for them never to meet again.
But a tragic sense of loyalty too often
impels the lover to come and fetch his
lady. For a long time the nervous, shy
and blushing bridegroom has been out-
of-date. Fashion nowadays decrees
self-possession, and the needs of the
Empire have evolved an heroic type.
Men who ultimately come home to get
married have to be brave indeed. Now .
and then, however, well-substantiated
reports will reach the returning bride-
groom and the match is broken off.
Even at the eleventh hour rumour has
saved the victim from taking the fatal
step.
Thus a man coming home to get
married in Manchester overheard a great
deal of strange talk regarding a certain
Miss B. Before reaching Aden incon-
trovertible proofs were forthcoming
that this was his Miss B., and that she
was not the sort of girl he could
possibly wed. With heroic prompti-
tude he disembarked, ceased his home-
ward journey and returned to India,
where he married a wealthy Begum.
Miss B., who never returned his pre-
sents, though she was already engaged
to another man, cabled her grateful
congratulations, and is now a happy
matron at Chowbent.
In another authentic example the
instinct of the returning bridegroom
served him well. Four years earlier
he had plighted his troth to a slim
young girl, winsome, svelte, and deeply
religious. He landed—every arrange-
ment had been made for the wedding on
the following day—and a mountainous
creature weighing fourteen stone hurled
herself into his arms. Disengaging
himself from her embrace he looked at
her straight. “Mabel,” he said in
fearless tones, “I’m sorry, but I can-
not commit bigamy, for you're twice
the woman you were when I promised
to marry you. I shall book my passage
by the next steamer to India.” Most
men would have quailed before such a
task, but this man—he was an indigo
planter with an iron constitution—was
as good as his word. Mabel was
shortly afterwards registered to a stock-
broker, and ultimately died in extreme
affluence.
Truly the bridegroom coming home
has need to be of the stuff of heroes.
The Glasgow Herald, describing the
KING-EMPEROR's reception at Bombay,
says:—“Over the dais was a canopy
of royal blue silk surmounted by the
crowd." Is Delhi behind Bombay ?
We do not hear of any grand-stand
enjoying so exceptional a point of
vantage at the Durbar.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LOOKED IN THE MOUTH.
WITH a view to see not only what I
might give to other people for Christ-
mas, but if there should be anything
that they might give me, I have been
loafing in Bond Street and Regent
Street; and the harvest of this quiet
eye is curiously barren, But, when it
comes to the thing that one wishes
neither to distribute nor receive, how
profuse a crop !
The peculiar feature of “Xmas
presents” seems to be a perverse and
dainty superfluousness. Every man,
woman and child, for example, was
provided at birth by a thoughtful
Providence with a stamp-licking ap-
paratus at once neat and efficacious.
Yet half Bond Street is devoted to
silver and gold mechanisms for reliev-
ing the tongue of this trifling burden.
Possibly the activities of
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE have
led to the increase in
these machines, although
few persons keep enough
servants to be caused any
Serious InCOn Wenlence.
Supposing anyone were
to give me a stamp-
damper, what should I
do with it 2. It would
go at once into the limbo
of inoperative gifts; and
this being so am I likely
to give it to anyone?
The assistant next
showed me a number of
beautifully made articles
in precious metal, all of
which I have spent
valuable years of my life
in learning to do without so completely
that were any of them to be given to me
now they would not only utterly dis-
arrange my scheme of pockets but
dislocate my very existence. Cigar-
cutters, for example, of gold, in the
shape of the guillotine—a pretty
thought. My own cigar-cutter is
either a very shabby knife or, like my
stamp-damper, a device of nature's
own invention : two rows of teeth,
imperſect, I admit, but adequate, since
they are still able (bless them () to meet
on the tip of the cigar and tear it from
the body quite well enough for the pur-
pose required. What should I do with
the golden guillotine 2
Again, silver-mounted safety-razors
are useless to me since I use one of the
old razors. On informing the shopman
of this regrettable piece of obscurantism
on my part, he atonceproduced a charm-
ing case of leather and silk, which would
be no disgrace to a beauty's boudoir,
containing no fewer than seven razors,
each lettered with the day of the week.
TENNIs BAI.I.s.”
This, as - a desirable addition to my
toilet table, after twenty years of fidelity
to one black-handled hollow-ground.
“But supposing,” I said, “that by
mischance I should shave myself with
Tuesday's razor on Wednesday, what
then 2'' It didn't matter, the shopman
assured me. “Ah, yes,” I said ; “but
have you no superstitions, man?'. Sup-
pose that on Wednesday it was Friday's
razor I used by mistake? That would
give me two unlucky days in one week.”
This seemed to impress him, and he
switched me hastily on to an egg-
decapitator. There are men, it seems,
youthful residents in chambers for the
most part, who want egg-decapitators.
Well, let them direct their generous
relatives to Bond Street, for I saw a
shopful; but if anybody were to send
me one I should emigrate. These
things are made of silver—naturally—
DURING A story. IN INDIA THE HAIL-STONES WERE SAID TO BE “As Big As
VERY cox FU's ING ! -
and they cost quite a lot. Heaven
knows how you use them, but they
are to bring radiance into many a heart
this Christmas, if the shopman is to
be believed. “Quite the rage,” he
assured me. “Wonderful what a
trouble some gentlemen's eggs are to
them ; but now—” His silence
plainly said that here was the oval
millennium.
He next held up a choice golden box,
which turned out to be a sovereign
case, with compartments in it not only
for sovereigns but for half-sovereigns.
“There,” I said, “that is really some-
thing likel Anyone who wishes may
give me that—so long as he endows it.
Surely you have blank endowment-
deeds to go with every case?” But
this kind of humour is useless in the
West-End, where the basic under-
standing is that everyone who enters
a shop not only has too much money
but has a car waiting outside. “Shall
I send it, or is your car waiting?”
is a question heard on every side.
What else did I see—all labelled
“useful,” of course? I saw in one
window off Piccadilly briar pipes of
immense age—older than the choicest
brandy, almost, and dearer — pipes
dating from 1810 and 1820, which you
may possess and smoke for a trifle of
five pounds apiece. These are called
“Gifts for Gentlemen.” I hope that
no one will think me gentleman enough
to own one, for it would be a ceaseless
responsibility. I should either have to
fix a chain to it or forget it and enjoy
my tobacco.
One thing, however, I did see which
at once I realised would make a good
present, not for me but for my nephew
Robert. A pocket electric lamp. For
what a godsend it would have been to
us, in my day, I thought. How we
would have read under the clothes half
the night through by the light of things
—I like that, instead of
perilous lumps of phos-
phorus in a bottle! The
Ballantyne or Kingston
or Stevenson that had
to be laid aside so regret-
fully at bedtime could
have gone on delighting
for another hour or so.
But I didn't buy it.
I thought of Robert's
eyesight and the dis-
cipline of the school.
Not mine the rôle of
encourager of forbidden
practices.
And so I left this
district of stamp-dam-
pers and egg-openers and
cigar-cutters and Brad-
shaw cases and walking-
sticks with cigarettes in them, and
umbrellas like Malacca canes, and
chestnut-roasters and all the other
pretty superfluities which are ranged so
alluringly under tickets describing them
as “Yule Tide Gifts,” realising that
presents are for the young. The
middle-aged and the old wait for no
anniversaries: they buy what they wish
when they want it.

Have I committed that thou huggest

434 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[DECEMBER 13, 1911.
An INForMAL EVENING. º.º.
DINNER was a very quiet affair.
Nobody drew my chair away from
under me as I sat down, and during
the meal nobody threw bread about.
We talked gently of art and politics
and things; and when the ladies left
there was no booby trap waiting for
them at the door. In a word, nothing
to prepare me for what was to
follow.
We strolled leisurely into the draw-
ing-room. A glance told me the worst.
The ladies were in a cluster round Miss
Power, and Miss Power was on the
floor. She got up quickly as we came
111. -
“We were trying to go underneath
the poker,” she explained. “Can you
do it 2 ”
I waved the poker back.
“Let me see you do it again,” I
said. “I missed the first part.”
“Oh, I can never do it. Bob, you
show us.”
Bob is an active young fellow. He
took the poker, rested the end on the
floor, and then twisted himself under-
neath his right arm. I expected to see
him come up inside out, but he seemed
to be much the same after it. How-
ever, no doubt his organs are all on the
wrong side now.
“Yes, that's how I should do it,”
I said hastily.
But Miss Power was firm. She
gave me the poker. I pressed it hard
on the floor, said good-bye to them all,
and dived.- I got half-way round, and
was supporting myself upside down by
one toe and the slippery end of the
poker, when it suddenly occurred to
me that the earth was revolving at an
incredible speed on its own axis, and
that, in addition, we were hurtling
at thousands of miles a minute round
the sun. It seemed impossible in
these circumstances that I should keep
my balance any longer; and as soon
as I realised this the poker began to
slip. I was in no sort of position to
do anything about it, and we came
down heavily together.
“Oh, what a pity!” said Miss Power.
“I quite thought you'd done it.”
“Being actually on the spot,” I said,
“I knew that I hadn't.”
“Do try again.”
“Not till the ground 's a little softer.”
“Let's do the jam-pot trick,” said
another girl.
“I’m not going under a jam-pot for
anybody,” I murmured to myself.
However, it turned out that this trick
was quite different. You place a book
(MACAULAY's Essays or what not) on
the jam-pot and sit on the book, one
heel only touching the ground. In the
The jam-pot, of
course, is on its side, so that it can
roll beneath you. Then you light the
candle . . . and hand it to anybody
who wants to go to bed.
I was ready to give way to the
ladies here, but even while I was
bowing and saying, “Not at all,” I
found myself on one of the jam pots
with Bob next to me on another. To
balance with the arms outstretched was
not so difficult ; but as the matches
were then about six feet from the
candle and there seemed no way of
getting them nearer together the
solution of the problem was as remote
as ever. Three times I brought my
hands together, and three times the
jam-pot left me.
“Well played, Bob,” said somebody.
The bounder had done it.
I looked at his jam pot.
“There you are,” I said, “Raspberry
—1909." Mine’s ‘Gooseberry—1911,”
a rotten vintage. And look at my book,
Alone on the Prairie; and you've got
The Mormon's Wedding. No wonder I
couldn't do it.”
I refused to try it again as I didn't
think I was being treated fairly; and
after Bob and Miss Power had had a
race at it, which Bob won, we got on
to something else.
“Of course you can pick a pin out
of a chair with your teeth 2" said Miss
Power.
“Not properly,” I said.
swallow the pin.”
“I suppose it doesn't count if you
swallow the pin,” said Miss Power
thoughtfully.
“I don't know. I've never really
thought about that side of it much.
Anyhow, unless you've got a whole
lot of pins you don't want, don't ask
me to do it to-night.”
Accordingly we passed on to the
water-trick. I refused at this, but
Miss Power went full length on the
floor with a glass of water balanced
on her forehead and came up again
without spilling a single drop. Per-
sonally I shouldn't have minded spilling
a single drop; it was the thought of
spilling the whole glass that kept me
back. Anyway it is a useless trick,
the need for which never arises in an
ordinary career. Picking up The Times
with the teeth, while clasping the left
ankle with the right hand, is another
matter. That might come in useful on
occasions: as, for instance, if having
lost your left arm on the field and
having to staunch with the right hand
the flow of blood from a bullet wound
in the opposite ankle, you desired to
glance through the paper while waiting
for the ambulance.
“I always
“Here's a nice little trick,” broke in
Bob, as I was preparing myself in this
way for the German invasion.
He had put two chairs together,
front to front, and was standing over
them—a foot on the floor on each side
of them, if that conveys it to you.
Then he jumped up, turned round in
the air, and came down facing the
other way.
“Can you do it?” I said to Miss
Power.
- “Come and try,” said Bob to me.
“It's not really difficult.”
I went and stood over the chairs.
Then I moved them apart and walked
over to my hostess.
“Good-bye,” I said; “I’m afraid I
must go now.”
“Coward ' " said somebody, who
knew me rather better than the others.
“It's much easier than you think,”
said Bob.
“I don't think it's easy at all,” I
protested. “I think it's impossible.”
I went back and stood over the
chairs again. For some time I waited
there in deep thought. Then I bent
my knees preparatory to the spring,
straightened them up, and said,
“What happens if you just miss it?”
“I suppose you bark your shins a bit.”
“Yes, that's what I thought.”
I bent my knees again, worked my
arms up and down, and then stopped
suddenly and said,
“What happens if you miss it pretty
easily 2”
“Oh, you can do it, if Bob can,” said
Miss Power kindly.
“He’s practised. I expect he started
with two hassocks and worked up to
this. I'm not afraid, but I want to
know the possibilities. If it's only a
broken leg or two, I don't mind. . If
it's permanent disfigurement I think I
ought to consult my family first.”
I jumped up and came down again
the same way for practice.
“Very well,” I said. “Now I'm
going to try. I haven't the faintest
hope of doing it, but you all seem to
want to see an accident, and, anyhow,
I'm not going to be called a coward.
One, two, three . . . .”
“Well done,” cried everybody.
“Did I do it?” I whispered, as I
sat on the floor and pressed a cushion
against my shins.
“Rather l''
“Then,” I said, massaging my
ankles, “next time I shall try to miss.”

PUNCH, OR
JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE FLASH-LIGHT PIIOTOGRAPH IS BEING TAKEN.
MUSICAL NOTES.
IN his recently published work on
Musical Composition, Sir CHARLEs
STANFORD offers a vigorous plea for the
retention of Italian as the universal
language for marks of expression. This
deplorable adhesion to the old-fashioned
Italianate school has, we rejoice to see,
found a doughty opponent in Mr. PERCY
GRAINGER, the distinguished pianist and
composer, who has recently brought
out a piece of chamber music which he
describes as a “foursome for strings,”
while the expression marks are all given
in English. Thus crescendo molto
becomes “louden lots” or “louden
hugely,” and all the other nuances of
expression are rendered into equally
nervous English.
We understand, however, that Mr.
GRAINGER is not content—and why
should he be?—with the importation
of the golf terms “foursome” and
“sixsome" as titles of pieces. It is his
intention to re-name all the instruments
of the orchestra after the implements
employed in the Royal and Ancient
Game.
the “driver,” the violoncello the
“bulger,” the trombone the “brassy,”
and the tuba, the “niblick.” The
piccolo, because of its high register, is
happily re-christened the “loſter,” and
the bassoon the “baffy.”
Mr. GRAINGER, we gather, proposes to
call changes of key “hazards,” and to
replace the cumbrous phrase “double-
bar” by the simple monosyllable
“tee.” The word “dormy” is applied
to passages of a languorous character,
and instead of “coda” he proposes to
employ an infinitely more suggestive
term—the “putting green.” The inno-
vation has been, on the whole, well
received, but it is only right to say
that ANDREW KIRKALDY, on learning
of the new use to which it is proposed
to turn the terminology of his beloved
game, expressed himself with some

asperity. “Hoots, man,” he observed
in his broadest Doric, “it 's eneuch to

A more curious outcome of Mr.
PERCY GRAINGER's epoch-making de-
parture is the extraordinary coinci-
dence which has been revealed by his
choice of the phrase “louden lots.”
For it appears that there is a dis-
tinguished singer, Mr. Loudoun Lott,
who is strongly opposed to the
employment of his name in a purely
instrumental connection. We under-
stand, however, that the matter has
been referred to Sir GEORGE ASKWITH
for arbitration, and it is confidently
expected that some modus vicemdi will
be discovered by that irresistible
diplomatist.

THE JOY OF BATTLE,
LIFE, from my standpoint, can't be too exciting;
I love a fight (when others do the fighting).
It's sweet to watch a boxer showering blows
Upon his adversary's shattered nose.
It's good to hear two disputatious neighbours
Slanging away with tongues that cut like sabres.
And in political affairs it's fine
When rows are seething all along the line.
The languid lure of silence may enamour
More timid souls; for me, I like a clamour.
And that is why the storms of recent years
Permeate me with bliss too deep for tears.
The Servant Tax, which breeds so much resentment,
Produces in my breast a rich contentment,
When the whole nation seeks opposing camps,
And all the countryside resounds with stamps.
It's fine, again, when mingled stones and threats
Pour in a flood from shrieking Suffragettes.

Lends a propriety to my complacence,
Because these rumpuses impending fill

of which the Londoner is left in complete ignorance. What
reader of The Times or Morning Post, for instance, knows
the true story of the Husband's Bag 2 It has been left to
The Devon and Exeter Gazette to give the full particulars
to the public for the first time. Listen:— . -
“The recent experience of a Devonian was singular. He left home
for a few days on a visit to a seaside resort, leaving his wife in a rather
disconsolate mood because she missed a much-valued ring, which she
wore constantly. On the morning of the day of his return, the
Devonian ſound the lost ring in his bag, in which it must have fallen
when his good wife was packing things in readiness for her husband's
departure. Not only did he restore the ring to his wife, but he also
displayed to her admiring gaze a prize (the first) he had won in a whist
drive, being his initial participation in such a game.”
“Mr. Samuel added that the number of new overhead wires would
be comparatively small, and placed underground.”—Daily Graphic.
This looks bad for our heads.
“A lady recommends her Parlourmaid; leaving because butler being
engaged.”—Advt. in “Morning Post.”
It is, of course, useless staying if the butler is already
affianced.

HUNT, arming the charwoman out,
presently returned accompanied by a
foreign waiter and another poser for
McKINNON Wood. Now wanted to
know “whether, in view of the fact
that many foreign waiters work here
for their food and lodging, without
wages, relying on gratuities from cus-
tomers, they will pay anything under
the National Insurance Bill, and what
will their employers pay ?”
McKINNoN WooD worked out sum
showing that the employer in , such
cases will certainly pay 7d. a week and
may (Heaven helping him) recover 4d.
from the wageless waiter.
Reply had remarkable effect upon
PIKE PEASE. Not what you would
call an emotional man by nature. Sits
by the hour ruminating at Gangway
end of Front Opposition Bench. Has
never got over the shock of finding
BROTHER JACK seated on Treasury
Bench immediately opposite. Admits
that, advancing from post of Whip to
Presidency of Education Board with
seat in Cabinet, JACK has done pretty
well. PIKE himself, going over to
Unionists, never rose above grade of
Whip, a post he resigned last year.

ously pausing for a moment before he

by his versatility. No sign of weari-

after his tourney yesterday on behalf
of the supertaxed charwoman and the

times this afternoon to ply Ministers
with questions.
In the main his attention is directed
to foreign affairs. Is concerned for
proper shaping of Arbitration Treaty

the mind's eye, Horatio.) Two months'
debate on subject full of details, arith-
metical or technical, has in the main
been slackly attended, usually dull. To-
night, in expectation of the end, benches
fill up and interest quickens. To this
end LLOYD GEORGE contributes rousing
speech. HARRY FoRSTER, official spokes-
man for the Bill from Front Opposition
Bench, concludes conspicuous service by
moderate, reasoned speech in support of
an amendment indefinitely postponing

Farmer. “”As the R BiN ANY GREAt Noos IN THE PAPEI, Sir, This LAST FEw DAY's
- - -
sEEN MY “COURIER.
EUPHEMISMS FOR SKINNERS.
OUR readers will be relieved to learn
that, after no less than two years spent
in deliberation by a Special Committee,
the Great Fur Question has been solved.
In future—if we take the precaution
of keeping by us the published list of
“permissible” descriptions—we shall
know what we are buying. The list
itself makes the most delightful read-
ing; indeed, we find we can hardly lay
it down. There we learn that Dyed
Rabbit may not be sold as Sable or
French Seal. That designation is
“publicly denounced" by our Com-
mittee as incorrect. But what do you
think is the correct and permissible
designation ? Why, Sable Coney.
Next we come to “Rabbit, Sheared
and Dyed.” This is a little puzzling.
The mere layman might be pardoned
for supposing that a Sheared Rabbit
would be more adapted to the manu-
facture of leather than to that of furs.
But it is not so. It seems that it may
be converted (by the dishonest) into
Seal, Electric Seal, Red River Seal,
Hudson Seal, or Musquash. All these
misleading designations are barred by
the new restrictions. It must be called
Seal Coney or Coney Musquash—and
then you know where you are.
Leaving, however, the question of
Rabbits—which we do with real regret
—we go on to find (which does not
surprise us) that Dyed Goat may not
be sold as Bear. But it does surprise
us exceedingly to learn that it may be
sold as Bear Goat. That disposes of
the Goat. But the Kid is much more
adaptable. He has played many parts
in his day, according to our list. There
we read of him masquerading as a Lama
or a Broadtail Mink, while
“For those who preferred a more forcible word
He had different names for these—” . . .
Skunk, to wit, or Russian Sable. But
all this is over. In future he must
appear as Caracal Kid, and is in no
small danger—one would say—of being
pushed out to the glove department.
After all this sort of thing it is a
mere anti-climax to learn that Wallaby
Dyed Skunk must be sold as Skunk
Wallaby. One might almost have
guessed that, But we cannot leave
this fascinating subject without one
or two humble suggestions of our own.
For we observe that neither Cow nor
Dog is dealt with. It surely cannot be
right to go on selling these as Persian
Lamb or Japanese Black Fox 2 May
we not suggest, as a “permissible "
solution for the latter, Belvoir Pup,
and for the former, quite simply,
Lamb Cow 2
I BIN Away IN LUNNoN, so I 'AVEN'T
For although we feel bound heartily
to commend the list as a whole,
regarding it as an important step in
the direction of Commercial Candour,
we cannot but think that it will press
heavily upon dealers in what we may
call our native furs. The Kitten, the
Ferret and the Weasel cannot hope
to attain success, any more than an
operatic singer can, without the cachet
of a foreign name and reputation. While
freely admitting that these must not
continue to be sold as Genuine Russian
Sable or Silver Fox, we should be sorry
nevertheless to see them excluded al-
together. We therefore hope that the
following additions will yet be made
before the list comes into operation –
Plucked Kitten—“permissible" de-
signation, Swansdown Tabby.
Weasel, Pulled and Scorched —
“permissible” designation, Scotch
Skunk.
Ferret, Boiled and Crimped—“per-
missible” designation, Astrakhan
Stoat.

THE CHARWOMAN PROBLEM.
[It is understood (or misunderstood) that the

have to be paid by the person that employs
her earliest in the week.]
Miss Laetitia Chaddock, “Sunnyside,”
Lane.
Owing to an alteration in herdomestic
arrangements, in future Miss Chaddock
will expect Mrs. Gibbs to come and
wash on Tuesday, and to clean on
Thursday and Saturday, instead of on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday, as at
present. The new régime will com-

at the Lawrells. Not being wishful
to make trubble will you speke to her
yourself?
Yours respectful ANN GIBBs.
Miss Chaddock to Mrs. Brunt, “The
Laurels.” -
MY DEAR MRs. BRUNT, Looking out
of my window this morning at your
dear little ones disporting themselves
on the lawn I was impressed by the
number of clean garments they must
need in a week. It struck me forcibly
that it would be a great help to you if
you had your washday on Monday, so
that your maid would have the week
before her for the ironing. I must
apologise for my apparent unneigh-
bo urliness in not suggesting this before,
b it you know how my frequent head.
aches often prevent me from thinking
connectedly for days together. I now
feel it to be my duty to propose an
exchange of days. Mrs. Gibbs is eager
for this, and I think that we should
both benefit by having a contented
charwoman. Kiss the dear children
for me. Yours affectionately,
LETITIA CHADDock.
Mrs. Brunt to Miss Chaddock.
MY DEAR Miss CHADDock,--I should
be delighted to agree to your most
kindly and thoughtful arrangement, but
unfortunately my husband has taken a
most prominent part in opposing the
new Servant Tax. Publicly—in The
Daily Mail—he has pledged himself to
pay nothing to the Welsh myrmidons—
as he cuttingly described Mr. Lloyd
George's underlings. This new tax,
which applies to charwomen, has doubt-
less escaped your notice, I am so much
obligel to you for your kind offer,
which only Mr. Brunt's prominence
as a political leader hinders me from
accepting. Yours affectionately,
MABEL BRUNT.
Burwash, to Mrs. Gibbs, No. 1, Love'
Miss Chaddock to Mrs. Gibbs.
As your other employer has dis-
courteously declined the alteration in
days which was suggested solely for
her benefit, Miss Chaddock begs to
inform Mrs. Gibbs that, as she has
conscientious objections to paying the
iniquitous tax imposed by the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer, the pay-
ment for washing on Monday will be
reduced from 2s. 6d. to 2s. 3d. Miss
Chaddock does this with the greatest
reluctance, but she feels it her duty to
bring home to the democracy the abyss
down which Great Britain is being pro-
pelled by a Welsh solicitor.
Mrs. Gibbs to Miss Chaddock.
MADAM, My husband says he to has
scrupe's against paying any tackses so
plese take notise that for Monday's
wash I shall want two and nine.
Trusting this will suit you,
Yours respectful ANN GIBBs.
Miss Chaddock to Mrs. Gibbs.
After your impertinent letter, which
shows the lack of gratitude in the
human heart, it is scarcely necessary
for Miss Chaddock to say that she will
not require your services again. Miss
Chaddock strongly recommends you
not to give her name as reference.
Miss Chaddock to the Manager, Labour
Earchange, Burwash.
Miss Chaddock desires to say that, as
she is overwhelmed with taxes from
which she derives no personal benefit,
she proposes to make use of a govern-
ment institution instead of paying fees
at a registry office. If this should ruin
the proprietors of registry offices Miss
Chaddock can only express her regret.
Will you please send her at once a
charwoman for Mondays (washing),
Wednesdays and Fridays? Persons
applying must be honest, sober, Church
of England, respectable, truthful, hard-
working, civil and good-tempered. Miss
Chaddock will pay 2s. 3d. (per diem)
for washing, and 2s. for cleaning, to a
suitably qualified person.
The Manager, Burwash Labour
Erchange, to Miss Chaddock.
MADAM, The only charwoman on
our list with Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays vacant is Mrs. Gibbs, of
No. 1, Love Lane. We are instructing
her to call on you, and trust she will
prove suitable. Her present employer
is Mrs. Brunt, “The Laurels.”
Yours truly, S. SMITH (Manager).

THE BAUM-RABBIT.
A Lullaby.
[“Baum-Rabbit: a phantom rabbit which
haunts the Manchester cloughs.”—Dialect
Dictionary.]
OH, hush thee, my child ! in the twilight
The bedroom looks eerie and queer,
And I know from that shape on the
sky-light -
That the little baum-rabbit is near;
As a rule she's in hiding till midnight,
But to-day she is early astir,
The little baum-rabbit who hunts for
her habit,
Her trim little babit of fur.
She lurks in the daytime in garrets,
In darksome and desolate ways,
And dreams of the turnips and carrots
She nibbled in happier days,
Or ever he caught her and skinned her,
That soul-less and dissolute rough,
And the little baum-rabbit developed
the habit
Of haunting a Manchester clough.
At night 'tis her custom to wander
Through factories silent and vast,
To patter through workrooms and
ponder
O'er tippets that tell of a past,
And when, 'mid her labours, the morning
Breaks grey on a vista of furs,
With a queer little stab it comes home
to the rabbit
That none of these relics are hers.
She grinds her diminutive molars
As she searches in vain for her pelt
On a mountain of skeleton bowlers
Or a pile of Mancestrian felt,
Till a watchman comes soft round the
corner,
Gives chase to a shadow and falls
In his effort to grab it—this little
baum-rabbit
That glides through the factory
walls.
But to-night 'tis the gladdest of
creatures
That squats on the nursery tiles,
'I is a rodent whose raw little features
Are lit by the sweetest of smiles,
Who knows that her troubles are over,
That her ghostly manoeuvres may
cease,
For the little baum-rabbit discovers her
habit
Adorning my baby's pelisse.
More Sweated Labour.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARI
CRACKERS FOR 19 ||.
IN view of the near approach of Christ-
mas the manufacturers of crackers have
been working day and night for some
weeks past in the endeavour to cope
with the rush of orders; and our
readers will doubtless be interested to
learn of some of the many striking
novelties that are being put on the
market this season.
It will be found that the 1911 cracker
has not escaped the wave of Orientalism
by which Society has lately been over-
taken. In place of the usual panto-
mimic caps will be provided turbans
and yashmaks of genuine design, while
the presence of frankincense in the
explosive portion will waft at least one
of the perfumes of the East across the
British dinner-table.
In the “Miniature " cracker (the
tiniest on the market) will be found a
complete music-hall dancer's costume.
Those who suffer from the disturbing
effects of Christmas fare will be par-
ticularly pleased with the “Antidote”
series, containing dainty little boxes
of pills, digestive tablets and other
prophylactics. There should also be a
considerable demand for the “Lloyd
George” brand, with which is presented
a Sickness Insurance coupon.
Millionaires are adequately catered
for by the enterprising firm of De
Luxe & Co., who are selling a special
line of crackers in which is secreted an
80 h.-p. motor-car. No really expensive
dinner-party during the festive season
will be complete without these little
gifts, and it is surprising how much
the pleasure of the guests is increased
thereby.
Labour circles will be interested
in a clock which only goes for eight
hours a day and strikes at unexpected
moments.
A determined effort is being made to
substitute something of a higher order
for the insipid verses and mottoes
which are generally included in the
contents of the old-fashioned cracker.
For this purpose a selection has been
made of the most up-to-date obiter
dicta of statesmen, police-court magis-
trates, popular preachers and other
famous people, of which we are privi-
leged to quote a few examples:—
“When a husband insists on beating
his wife with a poker every Saturday
night, domestic relations are almost
bound to become strained.”—MR.
PLow DEN.
“No land can avoid destruction
whose history is one of strong begin-
nings but of week-ends.”—FATHER
VAUGHAN.
“The Arab of the desert is my
brother.”—GENERAL CANEvA.
“Under Socialism a man will not be
able to call even his false teeth his
own.”—MR. G. K. CHESTERTON.
“It will be a happy day for England
when our public men court the rays of
the searchlight rather than of the lime-
light.”—MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL.
“In the concert of Europe I am
content to play the harmonium."—THE
CRow N PRINCE OF GERMANY.
“Since we have a Government of
grandmothers, it is clearly woman's
business to teach them what every
grandmother ought to know.”—Miss
CHRISTABEL PANKHURST.
“I have never been censored in my
life, and if I can help it I never shall
be.”—MR. CHARLEs BrookFIELD.
“Domestic servants have already
sufficient assurance of their own; they
require no State assistance."—EARL
WINTERTON.
“It is incompatible with the wise
governance of a mighty Empire that
its ruler should invariably have to go
to bed at six."—THE EMPEROR OF
CHINA.
“The world is going to the dogs,
and the dogs have my sincerest sym-
pathy.”—DR. INGE.
“In the name of sanity, let us have
a little less talk.”—MR. G. BERNARD
SHAw.
Certainly the youngsters are being
well provided for this Christmas.
THE TOWN COUSIN.
My wife and I live in London; my
wife's cousin does not. And yet, as
the result of having the latter to stay
with us for a week at our flat, I
have very deliberately described her as
appears in the title of this—call it
narrative or protest, as you like.
“We will give her,” said I to my
wife, before the guest arrived, “the
time of her life. What to you and me
is the daily round, the commonplace
of metropolitan life, shall be to her
a perpetual marvel. We will, in fact,
show her round. We will educate her
in shops, teach her the fashionable
routes, instruct her in the subtle art of
eating food at the right place, show
her the resorts of the elect, acquaint
her with the best theatres and, if there
is time, take her to the Tower, Madame
Tussaud's, the Zoo and other places
of historical and traditional interest."
“I shouldn't worry about the last
lot,” said my wife.
“Nothing will be too much for me;
and, besides, I am not proud.”
“I was thinking of my cousin,” said
she. And her thoughts, as far as they
went, were right.

The cousin,

Disillusion began at tea.
newly arrived, announced her intention
of buying a new hat for herself on the
morrow. My wife offered to guide her
to Bond Street for the purpose.
“Oh, but I want the very latest
thing,” said the cousin.
“And what later than Bond Street?”
I asked.
“Cursitor Street,” the cousin in-
formed us, naming, as I may not, the
actual shop. Perhaps she was right;
perhaps she was wrong. Anyhow, my
wife and I could not dispute it. We
were at the disadvantage of not knowing
exactly where Cursitor Street is.
Disillusion continued at dinner. “For
to-morrow night I have stalls for
Kismet,” I announced.
“Kismet 2'' said the cousin. She
had the trick of repeating one's last
word with a query attached to it.
Anyone can do that, but it takes a
town cousin to attach a sneer to the
query. I wish I had called her the
Suburban Cousin.
“Yes, Kismet,” I said with perti-
nacious joy, “It’s none the worse for
having run a little. Besides, it is
OscAR Asche and LILIAN BRAITHwaite,
you know.”
“LILY BRAYTON, you mean,” said
the cousin airily.
My wife undertook the burden of
her next morning. What had been
intended for an exciting education for
the cousin, turned out to be a series
of depressing corrections for my wife.
The cousin, I am credibly informed.
only asked one question and dispute:
the answer to that. In the afternoon
I took my turn on. There was a
delightful little place in the West,
where we would take tea. Not many
people, I explained, knew of it. The
cousin was not in the least impressed.
She did not state, but let me gather,
that everybody knew of my tea-place
a long time ago, but all the best people
had since forgotten. After that it got
steadily from bad to worse and ended
in the cousin taking us out to lunch
and pointing out to us Miss PAULINE
CHAse, sitting at the next table but one.
-- +3. + :- --
Have you ever been shown round
your own home by a stranger? If
you have, you will find my summing
up a just, if a rude one. :
“Well, good-bye," she said, as she
parted, with some of the most mis-
placed jollity I have ever been up
against; “I have thoroughly enjoyed
staying here and shaking you both up
a bit. I don't know what would have
happened if I had let you show me
round. I do believe you think I
ought to have gone to the Tower, for
instance.”
“For good,” I corrected.

LONDON CHARIVARI. --&
THE
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I NEVER met a spy yet but what he came to wish, before
his story was half told, that he was not a spy. An inop-
portune tendency to virtue seems common to the trade. As
soon as VIoI.ET JAcoB informed me that Flemington (John
MURRAY) had gone into it, I guessed that he was a noble
fellow at heart and foresaw an early repentance. “The
first woman with a pretty face and a melancholy tale to
tell will,” I said, going into detail, “get the better of him.”
If I had not gone into detail, I should not have been so far
out. Like all the other spies of fiction, he developed
scruples at the important stage. As has happened in the
case of no other spy I ever heard of, it was a man that
converted him to better ways. Indeed, in everything but
the one essential, he is an original, being neither an un-
exceptionally admirable hero nor a wholly base villain, but
just an ordinary human creature, with rather more than his
share of brains and quiet humour and a proper proportion
of merits and demerits. His story and the other people in
it are as out of the way and as well done as himself; the
whole book, none the worse for its foundation of fact in
Jacobite history and its innocence of pink cheeks and bright
eyes, is, in the language of its own country, “unco' guid"
(Scotch).
Thanks to the feeble good-nature and incipient senility
| of its house-master, who by the terms of his appointment
was an irremovable fixture, I&ussell's had become a blot on
the good name of Bradminster. Two things in particular
were points of honour in the esprit de corps of this house—
to be slack at games and to make the life of the house-
tutor (or “mug") intolerable. How John Scott, a Cambridge
Blue, entering almost straight from the University on this
invidious office, set himself to the task of reform, and stuck
to it till he had seen his team win the House Cricket Cup,
is told by Mr. CHARLEs TURLEY in The New Broom (NELsoN)
with that sympathetic insight into the hearts of boys
and masters which is his unique and inalienable possession.
It is matter for marvel with what freshness of eye and
firmness of hand, after the many stories of school life with
which he has delighted us, he can still observe and re-
produce the very nicest distinctions of character. There
are here at least a dozen clear-cut portraits of boys with
hardly anything in common but their boyhood. In Mansell,
the self-constituted terror-in-chief of mugs, a nature
strangely mixed of good and evil, Mr. TURLEY has justified

didn't “seem to be half excited enough,” makes an admirable
finish to a book that sparkles with fun on almost every
page. Never obvious or trite (except perhaps in the case
of Mr. Russell's sister-in-law, Miss Mellersh, the virago who
runs the house for him—a type so conventionally improbable
that I almost suspect her of having been drawn straight from
life) the story's chief novelty lies in the fact that it takes the
stand-point of a schoolmaster who is himself little more
than a boy. As one who, in his time, has been both boy
and master, I thank Mr. TURLEY very sincerely for the joy
he has given me, and hope that it will be shared this Christ-
mas season by all, of any age, who are still young of heart.
Everyone knows the famous definition of American novels
as “dry goods;” but, if things ſ−
continue as they are at pre-
sent, “sweet-stuff" will
become a more appropriate
term. The work that has
started me upon these re-
flecticns is Mothers to Men
(MACMILLAN). Warned by
previous experience that
readers in the U.S.A. now
take their fiction with, so to
speak, more molasses to it
than I can easily digest, I
am bound to confess that
the perusal of Miss ZANA
GALE's native press-notices
led me to approach her
present story with a certain
amount of distrust. Only
fair to admit, however, that
before the end of the book
the charm and humour of her
manner had to a large extent,
if not quite wholly, won me
over. Of course the thing
is sentimental; every incident
in the history of Friendship
depressed as the heart of novelist could desire. There you
have at once the strength of Miss SKRINE's book and its
drawbacks. For my own part, I cling, perhaps a little
desperately, to the belief that village life is not quite the
gloomy thing that realistic writers would have us suppose.
Old Patience Barfield, with her deafness, her poverty and
her jealous care for the idiot son (whom she must shield
from the dread notice of the “believing º is a central
figure both touching and heroic ; but, as the lady remarks
in Engaged, she is “not a cheerful object, and that's a
fact.” The same is generally true about most of the other
characters, so that I couldn't be altogether sorry when
Patience died in the house of her prosperous son (shamed
at last into declaring his identity), and poor bemused Crack
- - was left to burn himself and
the cottage in an effort to
settle the problem of exist-
ence. Perhaps I am doing
less than justice to the au-
thor's treatment of Crack; it
is, I willingly admit, both
tender and sympathetic; but
oh, how dismall -
I have a sort of idea of
what was in Mr. HAMILTON
FYFE's mind when he went
out to the Cape to see the
Duke of CoNNAUght open
the first Union Parliament,
and to write a book on the
country. I seem to hear him
telling himself that he was
in for some of the most
marvellous sights he had
ever seen, that he was going
to inspect a land with a
future, and find in embryo all
the factors of that future.
His book, South Africa To-
Day (NASH), proves that his

Village and its mothering by
the women of the community
is so turned to favour and to
prettiness that the total effect
is rather cloying; but there
is plenty of common-sense

them) were right, but it also
proves that he was perhaps
a little too ready to be

PUNCH, OR
THE
AN INDIAN LEADER.
To-DAY, I, too, shall write a leading article on India.
Everybody has been doing it, and I may be told, therefore,
that my own article lags superfluous. I disagree. My
point is that hitherto nothing has been written in this line
that can be laid up for ever and referred to in future as
Great and brilliant efforts have been made, but the results
have not been quite commensurate with the anticipations
of the writers or the loyal feelings of the readers. There
will be other Durbars as the years revolve and, when these
come round, Fleet Street and the surrounding journalistic
district will want a working model. That is exactly what
I intend to provide, and I shall do it not for any profit of my
own, but out of a feeling of altruistic benevolence towards
my fellow-writers—in fact, out of that spirit of unselfish
devotion which has made Englishmen what they are.
First of all let me see what I've got to get in if there is
to be the real Indian flavour about the article. Here is a
short list:— * =
(1) The GREAT WHITE RAI.
(2) The KING-EMPEROR and his gracious CossoRT.
(3) The spectacle of unparalleled splendour.
(4) The dusky, feudatories.
(5) Their haughty and be-jewelled retinue.
(6) The scarred veterans of our innumerable wars.

(15). There was a time when, to use an expressive phrase
now become obsolete, Englishmen thought only of shaking
the pagoda tree. That time has gone for ever.

beneath the palms and minarets–– -
(17) Hindus and Mohammedans have vied with

(18) A shout that drowned even the crash of the guns
thundering out the Imperial salute. -

mentalists and visionaries rid themselves —

Having thus set down the essentials it seems to me, on
second thoughts, quite useless to fill in the trivial gaps.
Those who study my list and employ it will be able to
write an Indian leader of the very highest quality. But if
anyone still hesitates let him drop me a line and I will
send him the thing complete down to the very smallest
detail. I will even tell him the value of a lakh of rupees
in English money.

[DECEMBER 20, 1911.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
: A MoDERN CINDERELLA.
ONce upon a time there was a
beautiful girl who lived in a mansion
in Park Lane with her mother and
her two sisters and a crowd of servants.
Cinderella, for that was her name.
would have dearly loved to , have
employed herself about the house
sometimes; but whenever she did
anything useful, like arranging the
flowers or giving the pug a bath, her
mother used to say, “Cinderella! What
do you think I engage servants for 2
Please don't make yourself so common."
Cinderella's two sisters were much
their mother had almost given up hope
about them, but she used to drag
Cinderella to balls and dances night
after night, taking care that only the
right sort of person was introduced to
her. There were many nights when
Cinderella would have preferred a book
at home in front of the fire, for she
soon found that her partners' ideas of
waltzing were as catholic as their con-
versation was linited. It was, indeed,
this fondness for the inglenook that
had earned her the name of Cinderella.
One day, when she was in the middle
of a delightful story, her mother came
in suddenly and cried :
“Cinderella Why aren't you rest-
ing, as I told you? You know we are
going to the Hogbins' to-night.”
“Oh, mother,” pleaded Cinderella,
“need I go to the dance?”
“Don’t be so absurd |
you're going!”
“But I've got nothing to wear.”
“I’ve told Jennings what you're to
wear. Now go and lie down. I want
| you to look your best to-night, because
| I hear that young Mr. Hogbin is back
: again from Australia.” Young Mr.
| Hogbin was not the King's son; he
was the son of a wealthy gelatine
manufacturer. ..
“Then may I come away at twelve?”
begged Cinderella.
“You'll come away when I tell you.”
Cinderella made a face and went
upstairs. “Oh, dear,” she thought to
herself, “I wish I were as old as my
two sisters, and could do what I liked.
! I'm sure if my godmother were here
she would get me off going.” But, alas !
her godmother lived at Leamington, and
Cinderella, after a week at Leamington,
had left her there only yesterday.
Cinderella indeed looked beautiful
as they started for the ball; but her
mother, who held a review of her in the
drawing-room, was not quite satisfied.
“Cinderella!” she said. “You know
! I said you were to wear the silver
º "
Of course
“Oh, mother, they are so tight,”
older and plainer than herself, and
pleaded Cinderella. “Don't you re-
member I told you at the time they
were much too small for me?”
“Nonsense. Go and put them on
at once.”
The dance was in full swing when
Cinderella arrived. Although her lovely
appearance caused several of the guests
to look at her, they did not ask each |
other eagerly who she was, for most
of them knew her already as Miss
Partington-Smith. A brewer's son led
her off to dance.
The night wore on slowly. One
young man after another trod on
Cinderella's toes, trotted in circles round
her, an her violently backwards into
some other man, or swooped with her
into the fireplace. Cinderella, whose feet
seemed mechanically to adapt them-
selves to the interpretation of the
Boston that was forming in
as long as she could ; and then led the
way to a quiet corner, where she
confessed frankly that she had not
bought all her Christmas presents yet,
and that she was going to Switzerland
for the winter.
The gelatine manufacturer's son
took her in to supper. It was noticed
that Cinderella looked much happier as
soon as they had sat down, and indeed
throughout the meal she was in the
highest spirits. For some reason or
other she seemed to find even Mr. Hogbin
endurable. But just as they were
about to return to the ball-room an
expression of absolute dismay came
over her face.
“Anything the matter 2" said her
partner.
“N-no,” said Cinderella; but she
made no effort to move.
“Well, shall we come 2''
“Y-yes.”
She waited a moment longer, dropped
her fan under the table, picked it up lunch next day, as she looked up from
slowly, and followed him out.
her
partner's brain, bore it from each one
and softly to herself.
I'll tell you all about it in the carriage,
mother.”
“Is my little girl going to be happy?”
“I don't know,” said Cinderella
anxiously. “There's just a chance.”
The chance must have come off, for,
once in the carriage, Cinderella gave a
deep sigh of happiness. * *
“Well, dear?” said her mother again.
“You’ll never guess, mother,” laughed
Cinderella. “Try.”
“I guess that my little daughter
thinks of running away from me,” said
her mother archly. “Am I right?”
“Oh, how lovely ' Why, running
away is simply the last thing I could
do. Look!” She stretched out her foot
—clothed only in a pale-blue stocking.
“Cinderella " ''
“I told you they were too tight,” she
explained rapidly, “and I was trodden
on by every man in the place, and I
simply had to kick them off at supper,
and—and I only got one back. I don't
know what happened to the other; I
suppose it got pushed along somewhere,
but anyhow, I wasn't going under the
table after it.” She laughed suddenly
“I wonder what
they’ll do when they find the slipper?”
she said. - -
Of course the King's son (or anyhow,
Mr. Hogbin) ought to have sent it
round to all the ladies in Mayfair,
taking knightly oath to marry her
whom it fitted. But what actually
happened was that a footman found it,
and, being very sentimental and know-
ing that nobody would ever dare to
claim it, carried it about with him ever
afterwards—thereby gaining a great
reputation with his cronies as a nut.
Oh, and by the way—I ought to put
in a good word for the godmother. She
did her best.
“Cinderella ' " said her mother at
her letters. “Why didn't you tell me
"Let's sit down here,” she said in the your godmother was ill?”
hall; “not upstairs.”
They sat in silence;
exhausted his stock of questions at the
end of their first dance, and had told
her all about Australia during supper:
while she apparently had no desire for
conversation of any kind, being wrapped
up in her thoughts.
“I’ll wait here,” she said, as a dance
began. “If you see mother, I wish
you'd send her to me.”
Her mother came up eagerly.
“Well, dear?” she said.
“Mother,” said Cinderella, “do take
me home at once. Something extra-
ordinary has happened.”
“It's young Mr. Hogbin'

“Who 2

“She wasn't very well when I left
her, but I didn't think it was anything
much. Is she bad? I am sorry.”
“She writes that she has obtained
measles. I suppose that means you're
infectious. Really, it's very incon-
venient. Well, I'm glad we didn't
know yesterday or you couldn't have
gone to the dance.”
“Dear fairy godmother!” said
Cinderella to herself. “She was a day
too late, but how sweet of her to think
of it at all !” A. A. M.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, Decem-
ber 12.-For sudden dramatic turn of
events House of Commons still holds its
own against the theatres of the world.
Through first hour of to-day's sitting
proceedings touched lowest level of
the inane. Question Paper crowded.
Supplementaries in great force. End
of session in sight. Now or never
Members must get the cheap advertise-
ment which testifies to watchful
constituents that, like Freedom, harped
in Tara's halls, “still they live.”
At a quarter to four, the long
list unfinished, process automatically
stopped. Resources of the self-adver-
tiser not exhausted. According to
Standing Orders, notice of intended
question must be given in time suffi-
cient to have it printed and circulated
with Orders of the day. Furthermore
it is ordained that the question may
not be read, the Minister's attention
being called to it by reference to its
number on the Paper.
That seems nice and orderly, calcu-
lated to push through business in
shortest possible time. In depending
upon Standing Orders, House forgets
the advertiser. Instead of putting his
question on the Paper, as others do, this
gentleman rises to ask a question of
which he has “given the right hon.
gentleman private notice.” Thereupon,
having fastened on himself the atten-
tion of the House, he reads aloud his
precious sentences, and the Minister
replies.
It was aſter this farce, equally trans-
parent and dreary, had been gone
through, that PREMIER advanced to
Table. Thought he was about to make
ordinary statement about course of
business. In low voice, with crafty
assumption of having nothing particu-
lar to say, he announced momentous
news of the despoiling of Calcutta of
the long-worn robe of Viceregal Court,
and the re-creation of Delhi as the
capital of India's Emperor - King.
Mentioned as mere detail that, by
abrupt modification of policy estab-
lished by Lord CURzoN, Bengal is to
undergo a fresh partition.
Form in which communication was
made added to effect. When great
stroke of State is projected, usual for
Parliament to be notified of Ministerial
intention, and arrangements made for
discussion of the necessary Bill or
Resolution designed to carry intention
into effect with consent of both Houses.
Here was a Royal Message flashed
from distant Delhi over land and under
sea declaring that “We are pleased to
announce to Our People that We have
decided upon the transfer of the seat of
the Government of India from Calcutta
to the ancient capital, Delhi.”
The crowd of silent unresponsive
Members felt they were back in Plan-
tagenet times, listening to a message
from Coeur DE Lios journeying in
Palestine, or from the Fifth HENRY
triumphant at Agincourt decreeing,
absolutely enacting, a new departure in
State affairs.
This aspect, of course, illusory. New
departure has been taken in ordinary
way after discussion in Cabinet Coun-
cil. Nevertheless the effect, possibly
“THE CAP’EN” RESUSCITATUS,

danse de triomphe over the rejection of the
Naval Prize Bill by the House of Lords.
artfully designed, remained. It was
that the KING - EMI’ERoR, clothed in
regal state, throned in Durbar held in
the city of the ancient Moguls, hold-
ing out his sceptre, had of his own free
will, on his personal initiation, recast
the framework of the Government of
India.
In its secrecy, its swiftness, its com-
pleteness and its irrevocability it is a
coup d'état as striking as that which,
sixty years ago in this very month of
December, transformed the Govern-
ment of France.
Business done.—Lords throw out
Naval Prize Bill. Commons sit up
till morning dealing with Report stage
of Budget.
Thursday.—When Members decided
to vote themselves salaries of £400 a
year, the MEMBER For SARK (who, by
the way, has invested his annual salary
in annuities for his cousins once re-
moved) pointed out the inevitable de-
terioration of tone and style that would
follow on the revolution. Curious
example of what was sure to happen
just now manifests itself. Rumour got
about that there is vacancy in ancient
and honourable post of Officer of the
Pipe. No one knows exactly what are
its duties and emoluments or who is its
present incumbent.
KEIR HARDIE, who has travelled in
the East and brought back with him
a suit of white drill reach-me-downs,
says that when he comported with
Princes of high estate in India—or
was it in China 2–he observed an
officer of state in close attendance
upon the Personage. He carried and
kept alight a hookah, the stem of which
from time to time at convenient mo-
ment, he placed in mouth of his princely
master, who took a puff or two. Then
the officer withdrew it and kept it
going till his Highness was ready for
another puff. Might that be the job
of the Officer of the Pipe?
Compendious and indispensable
Who's Who is silent on the subject.
It seems just the sort of thing devised
in earlier, happier times as a comfort-
able berth for favoured person not
otherwise capable of earning a living.
Presume that, being a paid State office,
it would necessitate application for
that other ancient, honourable, but
unhappily unpaid post, Stewardship
of Chiltern Hundreds.
Jowett, not knowing why John
BURNs should have monopoly of loaves
and fishes, volunteered to question
FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO TREASURY on
the subject. This the more generous
since he does not seek place of profit
for himself. Is simply moved by con-
sideration of desire burning around
him.
Result rather chilling. A Mrs. Harris
among paid State officers, there is to-
day “no such person" as the Officer
of the Pipe. Seventy-six years ago he
drew his last whiff or swallowed his last
draught, as the case may be. Anyhow,
in 1835 office became extinct. There
lingered round it halo of perpetual
pension. Five years ago this was
commuted for cash paid down, and
the Officer of the Pipe, his post and his
pension, have disappeared from the
earthly scene.
Business done.--Debate on Foreign
Affairs.
Friday.—Curious how some men
getting a certain lift up the ladder
of life spring at a bound to topmost
rung. There, for example, is BonAR
LAw—beg his pardon, BosNER. For

years he sat, whether on the Treasury
Bench or on the Front Opposition, his
exceptional merit overlooked. . On one
he ranked as Under-Secretary, seeing
others picked out for promotion when
opportunity presented itself; on the
other, he was relegated to second or
third place when the Party sorely
needed help in crucial debate. By un-
expected turn of fortune's wheel he,
after fashion not unfamiliar at the Vati-
can in recent years when rival claims
of candidates for Pontificate threatened
embarrassment, found himself Leader
of Opposition in House of Commons.
And now a place has been assigned
to him at Madame Tussaud's 1
Interesting to know in what attitude
he is presented. At Table of Commons
he impresses by absence of pose.
Characteristic of BonneR that, with
instinctive impulse to make as little of
himself as possible, he hides right hand
in trouser-pocket. Only other instance
of this habit I remember was case of
TIM HEALY. When, thirty years ago, he
found opportunity of catching SPEAKER's
eye, he habitually thrust two hands in
trouser-pockets and scowled at Mace.
Differing from BoxNER's, the little
mannerism was not indicative of desire
to efface himself. It was his artless
way of indicating his patriotic con-
tempt for an Assembly of which he
once declared that he didn't care two
pins whether he was in it or in prison.
TIMOTHY HEALY, Esquire, K.C.,
Bencher of Gray's Inn, keeps his hands
out of his pockets when addressing the
Chair. The LEADER of THE OPPositiox
might do well to follow his example.
Contrary habit, innocently, doubtless
unconsciously adopted, not either
graceful or dignified. Hope Madame
Tussaud has not stereotyped it.
Business dome.—LoRD CHANCELLOR

magistrates. PREMIER gallantly de-

time for it. With brief interval have

Worn-out Members resolved that in
no circumstances will they consent to
autumn session next year. At least,
if insisted upon by indomitable PRE-
MIER, they will strike for increased
wages. When they signed on at £400
a year it was understood that a
session should run, as in old times,
from first week in February to second
week in August at worst. If they work
overtime it must be paid for at due rate.

OH days of cumulative sorrow
When everything goes wrong !
To-day was such a day; to-morrow
I shall be stern and strong;
To-day the razor's edge dripped blood,
|Far caracoled the fallen stud,
My hat blew off and found some mud,
My eggs were boiled too long.
And when I sought my railway ticket
A monstrous female stood
(Her hat was like a flowery thicket
When April stars the wood)
Conversing with the poor young clerk
About the way to Regent's Park
(Most probably she'd missed the Ark);
She should be slapped, she should.
I lost my train—I lost a person
I simply had to meet;
All day my anguish seemed to worsen,
Misfortunes dogged my feet;
Red was the glowering sun at noon,
The heavenly lyre was out of tune,
And both the laces of my shoon
Came down in Fenchurch Street.
I thought I never saw a city
So stained with vice and sin ;
Hopeless, I went to call on Kitty,
And found she was not in ;
The people passed me, senseless clods,
Unheedingly, it made no odds
To them that I blasphemed the gods,
None of 'em cared a pin.
Wearied at last I sought the river
To ease me of my woe ;
I watched the glamorous lights that
quiver
Athwart its turbid flow ;
They seemed to cry, “Pop in forget !”
I leaned across the parapet;
It looked abominably wet,
And “No,” I murmured, “No.
“I shall not perpetrate self-slaughter;
That is a coward's deed ;
Better to pull the lyre-strings tauter
And have a rare old feed,
And then go homewards and complain
In sad wild numbers.” Hence this
strain.
I suffered, but I share my pain
With you (poor souls') that read.

SERVICE INTELLIGENCE.
(Answers to Correspondents.)
ADJUTANT of TERRItoRIALs.-Your
speech referring to the distinguished
War Service of your Brigadier-General,
at the Annual Dinner, was a little
unfortunate. The miniatures he was
wearing were: “Jubilee, 1887"; “Dia-
mond Jubilee, 1897 ''; “Coronation,
1902”; “Indian Durbar, 1903”; “Coro-
nation, 1911”; and the “M.V.O.” He
has no War Service.
SUBALTERN (ALDERShot).--We can-
not tell you why a “Staff Ride” should
be called by that name. Doubtless,
originally, the Ride was intended for
the Staff. Nowadays these gentlemen
have far too much work to do at home,
so the regimental officer plays at being
on the “Staff.” It should be con-
sidered a great privilege. -
IMPRESSED (MARGATE). — Guns are
painted “funny colours" to deceive
the enemy. You have no idea what º
92 gun looks like from the sea, through
a powerful telescope. We are told that
it closely resembles, in one light, a zebra
feeding, and, in another light, a carrot.
DESTRoy ER (PortsMoUTH).-We are
delighted to hear that the new “First
Lord ' is so universally popular. Want
of space alone prevents us from print-
ing your appreciation. Testimonials
are, we believe, forbidden by King's
Regulations.
ForgotteN. (TUNBRIDGE WELLs)—
We are sorry we cannot tell you the
meaning of the “Grand old Constitu-
tional Force.” You may be able to
find out on inquiry at the British
Museum, or perhaps one of the waiters at
a Service Club may be able to tell you.
CoMMANDER (Porti,AND).--Please see
answer to “Destroyer (Portsmouth).”
HopeLEss (Dover). — Really you
seem very impatient. The War Office,
only two years ago, promised that
something would be done shortly for
the more antiquated fossils among the
R.G.A. Subalterns, and they are sure to
keep their word sooner or later. It is
only a question of time.
FLAG-RANK (PLYMoUTH).--Please see
answers to “Destroyer (Plymouth)"
and “Commander (Portland).”
PERPLExED (SYDENHAM). – No, we
do not know the answer to the riddle,
“What is the difference between a

AT THE PLAY. ~.
“DELLA DoNNA.”
For what it sets out to be—a sort of
superior melodrama—Bella Donna, is
all that the British heart could desire.
It would be idle to pretend that it
raises any moral problem, apart from
the old doubts as to the recuperative
powers of damaged womanhood; or
any social problem, unless Dr. Isaac-
son's assault upon medical etiquette
can be credited with this intention."
Idle too to claim that the play attempts
to grapple with the highest task of the
dramatist—to develop character rather
than exhibit it ready-made. The chief
persons of the play remain at the end
pretty much what they were at the
start, except that Armine has probably
learned to modify his chivalrous ideas
of the sex, and that Bella Domna
has gone a stage further on the
primrose path than was originally
dreamed of in her philosophy of
hedonism. But in her case, at any
rate, the processes—and they are every-
thing—have been largely omitted. At
one moment we see her about to be
married to the best of fellows, and
with at least an off-chance of social
regeneration ; at the next—presto!—
she is the well-established mistress of
a coloured financier. What in the
meantime she has had to overcome in
the shape of physical hesitancy or cal-
culating worldly wisdom, is left to our
vivid imaginations.
But if an acquaintance with the
original book is necessary for the nego-
tiation of this yawning gulf, still, as a
series of episodes and situations, the
play is sufficiently lucid and logical.
I cannot indeed see how the adapter,
Mr. FAGAN, in the conditions of time
and space that were imposed upon
him, could have done his work better.
Except, perhaps, in the interview with
a patient at the opening of the first
Act (and something negligible had to
be done while the audience was getting
noisily into its seats, a process which
unfortunately overlapped the delivery
of some much more important dialogue
that follows), there is scarcely a word
wasted in the whole play. And, if
he did not altogether succeed in re-
producing the atmosphere which Mr.
1 Mr. RAYMoND BLAThwAYT, in what a con-
temporary describes as his chatty brochure"
(entitled “Bella Donna: The Authors, the
Play and the Players,” and given away with the
programme), has a lot, to say on this subject.
I quote his own words, lest their literary quality
should be sacrificed in paraphrase: “It must
occur,” he says, “quite frequently in every-day
life that a medical man . . . is hung upon the
horns of the dilemma, on the one hand, of pro-
ſessional etiquette, and on the other of a human
life endangered by a professional desire not to
interfere.”
HICHENs” achieves by force of word-
colouring and an inveterate gift of
insistence, well, that was in the nature
of things. To say nothing of the
necessary brevity of its effects, the
direct visual appeal of the stage is apt
to discourage the art of suggestion.
It was unſortunate that several scenes
in the novel, very vital to the sequence
of things, had unavoidably to be omitted,
the scenes in particular where Bella
Donna comes in contact with one of
the native women of Baroudi’s ménage.
The loss of the final scene on The
Loulia, where he dismisses the English-
woman with contempt in the presence
Dr. Isaacson (Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER) to
Bella Donna (Mrs. PAT1:Ick CAMPBELL). “On
the floor is a poisoned cup which has hitherto
escaped my notice. In another moment I shall
detect it, and then where will you be "
of the other, was greatly to be deplored.
The parting with Baroudi outside the
villa made a very tame and inadequate
substitute for this terrible scene. At
the same time the cutting-out of these
and other episodes in the relations be-
tween the white woman and the black
man helped to mitigate the repulsive-
ness of the theme.
Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER, as Dr. Meyer
Isaacson, had the sort of part which
shows him at his best-but-one. Self-
contained, unimpassioned, resourceful
—as befits a corrective Providence—
he was excellent throughout. But, even
*Mr. Hich ENs will appreciate the intention,
if not the idiomatic style, of the following eulogy
by Mr. RAYMoND BLATHwa YT: “His mists-
en-scène are invariably photographic : . . . he
never writes of places, persons or phases in life
concerning which he has not first troubled
himself to become fully acquainted.”
in a black wig and moustache (the
latter concealing the smile so fatal in
moments of crisis), and though he de-
canted the poisoned coffee as if born
to the manipulation of test-tubes, I
will not say that I ever quite mistook
him for a specialist in toxicology,
though I cannot tell you off-hand
exactly how a specialist in toxicology
ought to behave. It was not his fault
if I went through an awful time of
apprehension while the poisoned coffee
stood in its little egg-cup on the floor,
right under his nose, and it seemed as
if he would never notice it. Even
then, when he did, I was disappointed
that he omitted to dip his finger in and
try the taste of it, but waited till he
could analyse" it “off.” - -
As Bella Donna, Mrs. PATRICK
CAMPBELL was wonderful always, but
in the First Act simply adorable. At
the cost of one more proof of her
incomparable versatility I could have
wished that she might have remained
ever thus in a delightful mood where
cynicism was mixed with the almost
childlike desire to make the best of a
bad life."
In the part of Nigel Armine, Mr.
CHARLES MAUDE failed to persuade
me of his quixotic ideals, but for the
rest, and within his natural limitations,
he played a difficult part very soundly.
Mr. ATHoL STEwART was something
more than passable in the thankless
rôle of the American doctor; and Miss
MARY GREY, as Mrs. Marchmont, gave
me, in the London scene, the sense of
confidence which I rarely feel (except in
the case of dowagers) when a Society
woman is presented on the stage. Mr.
SHIEL BARRY was a very attractive
Ibrahim ; but Mr. CHARLEs BRYANT
had too much the air of a clean-built
Englishman to impose upon me as an
Oriental scamp. Still, by help of paint
and a fez and an accent, he contrived to
import a manner very tolerably sugges-
tive of an exotic origin; and if he could
not help modifying the natural offen-
siveness of Baroudi perhaps that was
all to the good.
The play, as I saw it on the third
night, ran perfectly, and everyone, from
* The results of that analysis are not revealed
to the invalid till he is in a state of advanced
convalescence in the last Act. “It is a moment,"
says Mr. RAYMoNI BLAthwayT, “such as this
which culminates in a burst of passionate horror
that brings to a play of this kind its measure of
human interest on an absolute top note of
emotion.”
“It is of this phase rather than of her sub-
sequent career as a poisoner that Mr. RAYMoNI)
BLATIiwayT is thinking when he hints of his
own wide experience of this type. “In many
respects,” he says, “Mrs. Armine is a typical
specimen of the modern fashionable woman
one encounters so frequently in the London
drawing-room.”

THE GoLDEN LAND of FAIRY TALEs.
There are no music-hall comedians at
the Aldwych, no diversions of perform-
ing seals and handcuff kings to interrupt
the six fairy stories to which we have
come to listen; and you may surmise
that the evening, however artistically
correct, is in danger of being dull. This,
let me confess, was what I feared at the
end of Little Red Riding Hood. It is
not a good story for literal presentation
on the stage; any story, in fact, in
which two of the principal characters
are eaten by the third makes a bad play,
for the reason that realism, hampered
by modern convention, breaks down at
the one great dramatic moment. There
was a compromise at the Aldwych—
Granny and Red Riding Hood being
eaten off the stage, but emerging whole
from the decapitated wolf. It was then
that I feared that the evening might
be too crudely simple for any but the
youngest of us.
But Puss in Boots revived me. The
Ogre was more like an ogre than any
I have ever met, and Puss herself was
superb. The debonair abandon, the
élan, in plain English the “side" of
this cat was everything that the story

had led me to hope. However, there
were even better things to come ; and
it is the Second Act, showing Cinderella,
Snowdrop and The Sleeping Beauty,
which will draw both children and
grown-ups in thousands to the Ald-
wych.
Miss MARY GLYNNE is the little girl
who plays Cinderella, and anything
more sweetly pretty than that Cinder-
ella has never been seen on the stage.
Of the two triumphs of the evening
hers was the first. When her little play
was over I would gladly have said a
“Nunc dimittis" and have left the
theatre; but fortunately duty kept me,
and in Snowdrop I had my second thrill.
This was from another child, Miss
ELISE CRAVEN, whose dancing left me
simply breathless with happiness. I
hand all other dancers over to anybody
who wants them. CRAVEN for me.
There are other players who should
be noticed—particularly Mr. ALFRED
LATELL, who took all the animal parts.
I have spoken of his Puss in Boots, but
he was also a captivating bull-dog in
Cinderella. I cannot begin to mention
all the people to whom we are indebted
for the costumes, scenery, armour, stage
paintings, &c., but in Snowdrop and The
Sleeping Beauty they excelled them-
selves.
Altogether a delightful evening. M.

CHARIVARI.
THE CHRISTMAS SCHEDULE.
“I HATE Christmas!" said Maisie
suddenly at the breakfast-table, d propos
of nothing at all.
Edward, who was reading an article
in The Times on “Recent Advances in
Actuarial Methods Considered from the
Autochthonous Standpoint,” murmured
a vague “Yes” and continued down
the column.
“I wish you wouldn't say ‘Yes'
when you don't mean it!”
...," Very well, my dear, just as you
|
like.”
“You’re too aggravating for words!
I hate Christmas because there's the
horrible worry of choosing the right
presents for the right people. It
doesn't affect you; you only pay for
them—that's the easy part.” -
Edward showed signs of interest.
“Why don't you work it by schedule?”
he suggested briskly.
“Don’t be shoppy!”
(Edward, it may be explained, is in
the Schedules at Somerset Hôuse. He
has a natural talent for the work.)
“I’m quite serious. It's always the
best way. It will save you no end of
trouble. Get me a pen and paper,
dear, and I'll show you. And a ruler.”
“But I haven't got a ruler. I hate
rulers.”
“Then I'll use the back of a knife,
but a ruler would make a better job of
it.”
It was certainly a very neat piece
of work when Edward had finished it,
though it hardly satisfied his critical
taste because of a slight slip in double-
ruling where the ink had spread from
one twin line to another. He pro-
ceeded to expound it to his wife :-
“The first column is leaded ‘Name,’
and under this, of course, you write
down the names of all the people to
whom you wish to give presents; then
come columns for ‘Age' and ‘Occupa-
tion,' the latter being a valuable aid
and requiring care in filling in the
correct designations: the next column,
headed “Married, Single, Widowed or
Divorced, should be self-evident with-
out further explanation on my part:
then come columns for “Hobbies and
Preſerences,’ ‘Dislikes and Prejudices,’
and ‘Former Presents'; and finally a
wide column for ‘Remarks.’ This last
will give you opportunity to insert any
relevant particulars which may not fall
conveniently under any of the other
headings, and also the suggestion for
this year's present. Is that all clear?”
, “Yes . . . I think so . . . But what
am I to do with it 2 ''
“Fill it in at your leisure to-day,
carefully and thoroughly, and then
| to-night we'll go over it together.”
It was a very scribbly, scrawly, ink-
blotty production which Maisie showed
to her husband in the evening. He
frowned involuntarily. Had it been
the work of one of his clerks, that clerk
would have received a severe wigging.
Work badly done cut him to the quick,
but, as it was Maisie's, he tried to say a
few encouraging words:—
“Of course it's the first time for you.
. . It's certainly promising. . . .
Next time it will come easier. It's a
matter of practice. . . . Yes, I think
we'll manage all right with this.”
Maisie pouted, but said nothing, and
Edward proceeded to adjust his glasses
and read out from the schedule:–
“‘Aunt Maria—Age: 58, I think, but
of course she never will acknowledge
it, so we had better put it down at 50
and please her?' . . . My dear, it's
scarcely necessary to insert all that; it
would be quite sufficient to put down
58, and in brackets next to it a note of
interrogation.”
“I thought you wanted me to fill it
in carefully.” -- ----
“Yes, of course; but I didn't mean
all that. However, let us proceed :
‘Occupation: An old cat . . .” Maisie,
how can that help us 2"
“That's just what I say, but you
told me to fill it all in.” •
Edward proceeded with a pained
expression :-" ‘Married, etc. : You
know she has been a widow for a long
time, long before we were married.
She wanted to divorce her husband, I
believe, but she could never catch him
—at least that's what Mama says.
Hobbies and Preferences: Parrots and
funerals. Dislikes and Prejudices:
You and I, but she mostly dislikes
everything and she is horribly pre-
judiced. Former presents: Last year
we sent her a set of poker patience.
She sent this back without putting a
stamp on the parcel, with a note saying
that she strongly disapproved of low
American gambling games. Remarks:
I'm sure I don't know what to
suggest. . . .’ My dear Maisie, what is
the use of all this rubbish 2
“I don't mean to be unkind, but look
at this matter seriously. How can it
help us? What on earth 's the use of
writing down that “Uncle John dislikes
any highly-seasoned dish and has a
particular prejudice against barrel-
organs' 2 Or that ‘Reggie is single
but it is high time he got married and
settled down, because he is getting too
selfish for words' 2 Or that ‘..Mrs.
Harringay likes to stay in bed until
lunch-time and sometimes does not get
up until three or four in the afternoon,
and that her husband ought to give her
a thoroughly good shaking' 2 My dear
Maisie, how can it help us 2"
It was at this point that Maisie
retired from the unequal contest.
Edward gazed blankly at the
slammed door. “It takes a man to
understand schedules,” he said.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MoDERATELY safe to assume that, if a book called The
French Revolution had not been written by THOMAs
CARLYLE, I should not now just have finished the perusal
of another, by Sir JAMES Yoxall, called The Courtier Stoops
(SMITH, ICLDER). It bears, by no means unpleasantly, the
influence of the Sage in every chapter. “A grating noise
had begun to be audible; the south gate was scraping
open. Out of spaces of distance and time the foot had
come to the sill”—you see, very obviously, whose is the
inspiration for such passages as this. The foot was that
of Captain Machoum, posting, a discredited and ridiculed
monitor, throughout Europe in 1790, with his warning of the
change that was to break up old systems and governments.
The man who heard and half believed his message is the
central figure of the tale, Councillor of the tiny, sleeping
German state of Ilmenar—a figure famous enough, and but
thinly disguised by the author under the abbreviated name
of Johann von Wolfgang. It is of his life, mental rather
than bodily, and of the influence upon it of the troubled
times, that the story treats; incidentally giving a clever and
impressive picture of the little toy-kingdom, one of so many
presently to vanish before the news that came rushing out
of France. All this is excellently done, up to the final
catastrophe of Valmy, which shows the hero, GoFTHE
confessed, riding into the dance of the cannon-balls, and
making his famous experiment in “cannon-fever"; last of
all, amid the crash and roar of these same cannon, wedding
the peasant girl Christiane, whom the ruin of the old caste-
ideals has rendered possible as a wife for a well-born. An
unusual and scholarly story, well worth reading.
“Seems so" is what you say in Devonshire if you have
made a particularly positive statement and yet are moved
by politeness to concede that the other fellow may have
some right on his side. In Seems So (MACMILLAN) the
other fellow is described as “The Likes o' They "–that is
to say, gentle reader, the Likes of Us; and the joint authors
of the book, STEPHEN REYNolds, the scribe who would
a-fishing go, and his mates Bob and ToM Woolley, tell us
quite plainly just what the working-man thinks of us and
our politics. If I were a hand-working instead of a brain-
working man I should probably be with them heart and
soul in their condemnation of the fussy benevolence of the
law. I should hate—I know I should—to have my life
and my home and my children and my public-house con-
stantly interfered with and inspected by a pack of prying
officials. Life must be pretty intolerable when you can't
call your kitchen-sink your own. And it is because of that
sort of thing that the likes of us—Tories, Radicals, Tariff
Reformers, Free Traders, Lloyd Georges, Bonar Laws,
Sidney Webbs, Bishops, Temperance and Educational
Reformers, Sanitary Inspectors, Officers for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, Magistrates and Policemen—seem

to the working-man to run the country and make or execute
its laws to suit our private ends. They think that we do
not properly understand their needs, their rights, their
feelings and their pride. And, apparently, there is a great
deal to be said for their point of view. I counsel you to
read the REYNoLDs-Woolley manifesto and see if it doesn't
“seem so.”
Trippers who come back from the Durbar with the notion
that Viceroys of India are just picturesque figure-heads
whose business in life is to organise pomps and pageantry
for the demands of Oriental imaginations, had better correct
this error by a study of Mr. LovaT FRASER's India under
Curzon and After (HEINEMANN). It is a record of Herculean
toil. The bitterest of Lord CURzoN's opponents could not,
after reading these pages, call in question the sacrificial
devotion with which he laboured, unsparing of his health,
for the bettering of the condition of the native races and
for the strengthening of all branches of the finest of the
Empire's services. Mr. LovaT FRASER's long experience
of India and his freedom from official influence have
enabled him to speak at once with authority and detach-
ment. His style is the easy and fluent style of a writer
Three months later John was chased along a country road
by a fearful Thing, which ended by treeing him and break-
ing his neck. Mr. Karswell, a man who had a short way
with critics, had “cast the runes” on him. Now, it may
be that Dr. M. R. JAMEs, in whose More Ghost Stories
(ARNOLD) this awful example occurs, cannot cast runes,
and would not if he could; but I am taking no risks.
I wish to place myself on record as unreservedly recom-
mending More Ghost Stories. Fortunately, in this case, as
it happens, honesty need not be sacrificed to prudence.
That delightful blend of antiquarianism, quiet humour and
ingenious creepiness which characterised the earlier stories,
has suffered no falling off. It is Dr. JAMEs' method that
makes his tales so fascinating. As he puts it in his
preface, a ghost story ought to be told in such a way that
the reader shall say to himself, “If I'm not very careful
something of this kind may happen to me.” That is Dr.
JAMEs' secret. A spectre in a ruined castle leaves us cold,
or, rather, does not leave us cold, because we seldom pass
an evening in a ruined castle. But in one's bedroom ?
Aha! The thought chills the marrow. In a Dr. JAMEs
bedroom practically anything may happen. A sheet starts

upon this or any other policy of Lord CURzoN's, every chapter
of the book is an eloquent justification of his tireless efforts
to realise those ideals which are summed up in the noble and
moving speech that he delivered on the eve of his final
departure from India:—“To fight for the right . . . to
care nothing for flattery or applause or odium or abuse—it
is so easy to have any of these in India . . . to remember
that the Almighty has placed your hand on the greatest of
his ploughs, in whose furrow the nations of the future are
germinating and taking shape, to drive the blade a little
forward in your time, and to feel that somewhere among
these millions you have left a little justice or happiness
or prosperity, a sense of manliness or moral dignity, a
spring of patriotism, a dawn of intellectual enlightenment,
or a stirring of duty, where it did not before exist—that is
enough, that is the Englishman's justification in India. It
is good enough for his watchword while he is here, for his
epitaph when he is gone. I have worked for no other
aim.” “So,” says Mr. FRASER, “he passed from India
with head high and courage unfaltering, having shed fresh
lustre upon the name of Englishman, and done no
single thing to stain it.”

with their brethren of Spitalfields and the Commercial Road;
while the Sisters of the Hospital degli Innocenti are by
another method more efficient than the most active of Care
Committees, and ever so much more picturesque. It is a
pleasant note of these sketches that their author has in

A RESOLUTE CHRISTMAS.
W E made up our minds some time ago we were going
to enjoy Christmas, every little bit of it, and when you make
up your minds like that, of course you go and do it all right.
It was Peggy, aged eight, who began it. She said she
knew who Santa Claus was ; she had seen dad's nose quite
plainly—it wasn't a bit of use making it so red—and she
knew his voice; nobody could take her in any more—in
fact it was years ago since she had believed in Santa Claus;
but she was going to believe like mad this year because it
was such ſun believing. The plum-pudding tasted better
if you believed, and
“But it's a real plum-pudding,” said Helen, who is apt
to be sarcastic from the height of her twelve years. “It
isn't an old pretender, like Santa Claus. Anybody can
believe in plum-pudding.”
“Well,” said Peggy, “I shall believe in plum-pudding,
too, and turkey and stuffing and sausages. I'm going to
believe in everything.”
Rosie, who is ten, thought this was silly. “I shall
believe in some things,” she said. “I shall believe in
presents and being allowed to come to supper and putting
ribbons round the necks of the dogs and standing under
the mistletoe: but poor old Santa Claus, you know, you
can't believe in him. Dad just goes and puts on his old
dressing-gown and a red cap, and chalks his big boots, and
then he comes dancing in and laughs ‘Ha-Ha -but it
was good fun years ago.”
“I don't care,” said Peg; “I think we ought to help him.
He'd be very sorry if he thought we knew him.”
“You didn't know him last year. You shivered with
fright when he came near you,” said Rosie.
“I pretended to shiver—did it on purpose to please Dad,
and I'm going to shiver all over this year—you see if I
don't.”
At this moment John came in, and the sisters said
“Hush.” John believes implicitly in Santa Claus, and his
belief must not be disturbed, for he is only four and a half.
“John dear,” said Helen coaxingly,” do you think you're
going to see Santa Claus?”
“I seed him last year,” said John. “He’s tall's a ephelant,
and got a long beard. I seed him this morning.”
“This morning 2" came in a horrified chorus from his
sisters. “You didn't. He'll only come next week.”
“Well, I seed him,” said John. “He’s asleep in one
of Dad's drawers where the stockings are. I think he's
nearly dead, 'cos he's got no eyes.”
“He 's opened the drawer and seen the mask,” said
Helen in a stage-whisper. “Never mind, John, he'll be
here to-morrow all right, and he'll have eyes then.”
“No, he won't,” said John; “I put a button-hook in
them.”
The result of all this was that the three ladies, having
scolded John for his cruelty, agreed to believe firmly (for
John's sake, of course) in Santa Claus. Then the mysteries
began to spread darkly over the whole house. Helen was
embroidering a handkerchief case—HANDRERCHIEF in violet
silk, with sprigs of roses in pink and green—an elaborate
and careful piece of work which was hustled away when-
ever I came within a mile of her. Rosie was at work on a
pocket-book, also an object of terrific secrecy. Peggy was
laboriously hemming a doll's shirt. John alone was guilt-
less of any preparation for presenting anything to anyone.
He was an acceptor, not a giver. On Christmas Eve they all
went quivering to bed, the one believer and the three who
had forcel their faith. The four stockings were duly in
place; and on Christmas morning there were yells of
delight in the passage. Santa Claus arrived after breakfast,
--- -
-
and never had a more whole-hearted success. John said,
º He's got his eyes back; " and the old gentleman gave a
howl of laughter.
“Don’t make him angry,” said Peggy firmly.
“Saints don't get angry,” said Rosie.
“This Saint sometimes does,” said Mother.
But Helen said, “No, never.” She was believing hard.
We enjoyed the whole day—every bit of it.

THE PASSING OF NEW YEAR'S EVE.
To Thomas, hone ski-ing.
How oſt, O friend of early troth,
're yet the Hours had taken toll
Of that superbly tufted growth
That crowns the adolescent poll,
I'ar back in days still full of fine illusions,
Still flushed with boyhood's lingering glow,
Together we compared our hearts' contusions,
Watching the Old Year go.
Time then could never move too fast,
Too soon renew its annual pledge;
No memory of a barren past
Had dulled ambition's eager edge:
Still freshly painted in a crude vermilion
The future, with its fame to win,
Smiled on us as we heard the clashed carillon
Pealing the New Year in.
For three full decades, off and on,
We kept the ancient custom up,
And talked of times to be, or gone,
Over the temperate wassail-cup ;
Hand locked in hand, serenely raised the question,
“Should auld acquaintancé be forgot?”
And poured contempt upon the vile suggestion,
Saying that it should not.
And, since to songs of good Auld Syne
Some local weight the scene supplies,
Now by your hearth we met, now mine,
But ever under home-grown skies;
Here by the climate's help that so enhances
The loyal patriot's private cheer,
Next to ourselves we thought of England's chances
In the ensuing year.
T}ut all is changed ' And this our own
Tight little island, where we two
So long had greeted, now has grown
Too little and too tight for you;
Spurning your country's claims at such a season,
Yearly you go to risk your scalp,
With what, I think, amounts almost to treason,
Upon an alien Alp.
There New Year's Eve shall see you trip
To strains of some exotic band ;
As midnight strikes, you'll take and grip
Two perfect strangers by the hand;
And hint that naught (for Auld Syne's sake) shall
Sever
The bond that twines you with the twain
Whom you have never met before, and never
Desire to meet again

THE ALMANAC SCOURGE.
Boxing - DAY was dragging out its
weary length.
“Will it ever stop being Sunday 2”
asked Ursula.
“My dear girl,” I observed, with the
note of pleasant severity that I some-
times adopt towards my wife, “you
should not begrudge the overworked
shop-assistant his or her trifling vaca-
tion. For my own part I find the
enforced leisure of this festive season
not only restſul but stimulating.”
“You would,” said Ursula. “Be-
sides, tobacconists are always open.
You've been out to one already this
morning.”
“Whilst you have been By the
way, what on earth hare you been
doing?” I glanced towards Ursula's
writing-table, now hidden beneath a
driſt of small parcels and envelopes.
“Yes,” said Ursula, the bitterness I
had already noticed in her adorable
voice becoming more pronounced, “you
may well ask. I've been trying to sort
the calendars, and see who sent them.
That's work enough. Do you know
that between us we've been saddled
with fifty-three. And that's only
counting big ones that tear off.”
“Ah,” I said, “ that 's three and a half
for every room in the house, and four
over. We might put those in the
garden.”
“It's perſectly idiotic. Why can't
LLoyd GEORGE or somebody invent a
tax on superfluous almanacs 2 There
would be some sense in that ' "
“Yes,” I said, “it is indeed the
dickens.”
“About half of them are,” corrected
Ursula. “That big pile in the corner.
If anything could make me tired of his
books, having little disjointed texts
thrown at me every day would be it.
Then there 's SHAKsp EARE, of course—
he's one of the worst. There are six
from Macbeth alone this year.”
“Those 'll be all right for the spare
bedrooms. Fancy the effect of “And
when goes hence 2' on a disagreeable
guest.”
“I know who you 're thinking of.
But we'd have to give her Daily
Helpings,’ because she sent that her-
self.” Ursula pointed resentſully at
the work in question. Viewing it, I
took a sudden resolution.
“Ursula,” I said, “can you swear
to me that you do homestly object to
ordering your life according to the
suggestions of these haphazard antho-
logists? Seriously swear, I mean,
so that you can't blame me after-
wards 2 ”
“Of course, darling.
But why?”
“You'll see.
Are there any of these
contrivances that lestrict themselves to
telling the day of the week, with
possibly some item of cheerful or
interesting information, such as ‘Royal
Exchange Burnt, or “Quinine First
Ammoniated ' ' '
Ursula indicated a heap of about a
dozen. “Then,” I said, “here goes
for the rest ' " and 1 gathered them into
my arms. The study fireplace is
fortunately large, and the fire was
burning well at the time. Ursula
watched the destruction, half fright-
ened, half fascinated. “Oh, but,” she
said when it was already too late for
the protest to have any effect, “ you
shouldn't do that. They're presents' "
“They were,” I said; “they're pasts
now !” -
THE REALISTS.
* One of the chief incidents in the pºning
days of 1912 will be the staging of Sophocles'
drama of (Edºpus 1'.'... . . . The floor of
Covent (arden is to be specially built up in
order to convey to the spectator the feeling
that he is really participating in the scene
before him. The great feature of the play is the
enormous crowd who will surge upon the stage
through the opening which is now the well-
known central entrance to the stalls."—Tho
Sºhº re.
Won DERFUL effects are promised by
| Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE in his
revival of The Tempest. The whole
interior of His Majesty's is to be lined
with tarpaulin and decorated with
barnacles and jetsam. Sir HERBERT,
always considerate for the comfort of
his public, will rescind the riqueur of
evening dress, and allow mackintoshes,
cork swimming belts and other protec-
tions against the wrath of the elements.
| He has also engaged the famous Deal
lifeboat to stand by for rescues. In
the scene of the wreck a veritable
cyclone will rage, not only on the
stage, but in the auditorium. Real
forked lightning leaps across the house
from hidden batteries of tremendous
voltage; tons of water descend from
above; a tornado of winds howls from
Titanic steam-driven bellows at the
back of the stalls. The audience will
be battered by hailstones (pure ice,
Messrs. GATTI), and buffeted by driving
salt spray (Messrs. TIDMAN). The
veries", Philistine will realise that,
terrible as Nature is in her fury, Sir
HERBERT BEERHoHM TREE is yet more
cataclysmic. -
Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER is also
enthusiastic for a closer rapp ochement
between stage and audience. In the
Second Act of his proposed adaptation
of Sartor's grim drama, The Wrong Suit,
is an amazingly powerful drawing-
room tea-party, which will be allowed
to spread all over the stalls. To add to
, the poignant realism of this beautiful
picture, real scandal concerning well-
known people, exclusively obtained and
changed each week, will be discussed
by the characters. During this scene
a limited number of ladies of the
audience will be permitted to take tea
with the company. Teas 9d., with
cucumber sandwiches 1s. ; with sotto-
roce remark about the weather from
Sir G. A. l. guinea.
Mr. LEwis WALLER has revived
King 11enry V. with incredible realism.
Robust though his interpretations have
always been of the heroic king, he has
long chaſed at his inability, owing to the
pusillanimity of supers, to suit action
to his words. If even Mr. WALLER's
audiences feel a fever to fly at each
other's throats when Henry shouts like
a clarion, what restraint must the actor
himself be putting upon his martial
ecstasy 2 But restraint in the present
revival is unnecessary—the fighting is
real. In Act. III. the walls of Harfleur
frown over the footlights and dominate
the house. The English attackers are
a picked force of League footballers,
Army reservists, peaceful pickets, and
Bashi-Bazouks, with a stiffening of
militant suffragists. The defenders,
equally resolute and reckless of life,
have a
to
excite the English to rage.
Mr. LEwis WALLER has ransacked
the armouries of Europe for contem-
porary weapons. Harfleur, last night,
was a volcano of mediaeval missiles,
and flights of arrows and javelins
darkened the auditorium. The final
assault—from the rear of the pit—
was led by Mr. WALLER in a trans-
port of elocution. The audience, mad-
dened by their losses from front and
rear, joined in the fray. Those who
hesitated were trampled by pike-men ;
cravens who sought the bar or exits
were driven to the front by Mr. Oscar
Asch E as I'lucllen. The scene culmin-
ated in a triumph of actuality. Boil-
ing lead was hurled from embrasures,
masonry toppled on the besiegers, the
very theatre rocked with the fall
of Harſleur, and the groans of the
wounded and expostulations of the
orchestra made a terrible finale.
Owing to slight wounds Mr. WALL, R
was unable to conclude the play. Next
week he hopes to be in the field again,
and requests that such of his audience
as survive Harfleur will resume their
seats and await yet more startling
realism at Agincourt.

it is next to impossible for a woman to

the facts.

got a chance, “I am prepared to
wonder just once, to please you.
Isn't it very sticky inside the cells?”
“It is,” he informed me.
“Well, this is what I wonder. How
do the little fellows, as you call them,

honey, manage to get out again 2"
He took a deep breath, arranged
with precision his knives, forks and
plates, and slightly raising his voice,

“Oh,” I said wearily, “I thought
you knew. I gathered from your
conversation that you had once upon a
time been a bee yourself. Pass the
marmalade, please.”
He passed it as one who acted against
his better judgment. “Clearly,” he said,
with the contempt of superior know-

is made, or you would not eat it. I

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STRAIN OF AL-FRESCO
ACTIN
TALK witH MR. ARTHUR BouxCER.
(By our Unscrupulous Reporter.)
PURSUING Mr. A. Bouncer to the
interior of the charming little theatrette
where he was passionately rehearsing
the astounding sketch which he is
about to produce to-day, I asked him
where, in his opinion, exuberance told
most—on the variety stage or in the
al-fresco drama.
**
Without removing the bird-call from
his mouth the gifted actor at once
replied in a high falsetto on the fourth
lºdger line, “Here, of course. The
variety stage has too long suffered from
the banefully repressive influence of the
legitimate drama—the theory of reserve
force. In the Punch and Judy show,
per contra, a man must exuberate or he
is lost. The open-air audience is the
supreme test of a man's vitality and
resiliency. An actor in the theatre can
muddle through a play without being
found out. But there is no room for
mediocrity in the Punch and Judy
sho-º. Here he has, as it were, to cut
his part out of a piece of agate with a
glittering diamond. It must be cut as
clear and sharp as the Pyramids cut
themselves against ALEXANDER's crim-
son Egyptian skies.”
“I suppose you mean ALEXANDER
THE GREAT 2 ''
“Yes,” replied Mr. Bouncer with a
stentorian shriek, “the great actor-
manager. But even he, with all his
gifts, is not exiberant enough for the
role of the eosmic villain, Punch. For
it is not given to everyone to realize
the elemental passion of Punch's world-
squeal.”
“I suppose it is rather severe on the
lungs 2"
“Tremendous. I have studiedlaryn-
gology, so I know what I am talking
about. But it is worth the effort.
Think of the human voice reinforced by
the timbre of the cockatoo, the peacock,
and the piccolo! “Eternal passion,
eternal pain,’ as MATTHEw ARNOLD
says.”
“Are the audiences more apprecia-
tive than the ordinary theatre audi-
ence 2''
“Rather ' You see they don't pay
in advance; they pay if and when they
feel inclined to. And their payment is
monumental in its bulk, being mostly
in bronze: aere perennius, as old HoRACE
says. And that reminds me what a
stand-by HoRAcE is to the actor! Give
me HoRACE, a bird-call and Punch's
baton and I will face all the buffets of
outrageous fortune with equanimity.”
“Do you think exuberance is identical
with personality 2 ''
“Of course I do. It is sheer lonely
personality and individuality that tell
most with the al-fresco audience.
Lonely because the actor is concealed
behind the curtain and cannot see the
effect that he is making on his audience.
He can hear it and sometimes he can
feel it.” - ~ *
“I suppose you mean in
tributes ?”
“Yes; but the curtain breaks the
force of the impact somewhat. For,
mind you, a Punch and Judy audience
is more homely than a stiff theatre
audience. People bring their refresh-
ments with them — bottled porter,
cucumbers, tomatoes and baked
potatoes. That is what makes this
form of entertainment a microcosm of
life. But what is so tremendous in
the Punch and Judy show is the fact
that the individual performer's per-
sonality is always confronted by the
personality. of the audience. You
remember what Mr. BourcHIER said
about it in The Chronicle to dear old
RAYMoSD BLATH wayt 2"
“No, I am afraid I don't.”
“Well then, listen to it attentively,
for it is one of the most poignant and
compelling passages in modern prose.
‘It is an awful thing—that giant per-
sonality of the audience. A man steps
before the footlights with his own
poor weak personality, and there before
him is this giant, made up of men and
women, young and old, rich and poor,
cultivated and ignorant, and he has
to get hold of that personality and
dominate and reconcile it with his own.
It is no chimera of the imagination,
this that I am telling you. It is real, it
is true, it is life itself.' That goes to
the rootitoo of the matter, doesn't
it 2 ''
“It does. I wonder how he gets it
off his chest like that.”
“Personality again. Or rather the
clash of two giant personalities—
Bou RCHIER's and BLATHwa YT's — re-
sulting in an epoch-shaking explosion.
All the same, Punch and Judy is the
greatest thing in drama. It contains
all the eternal verities, and you are
trying it on the dog all the time.”

Weeds of the dead day's comedy,
The while I pray
Your part may be alway
So simple and so good to play,
And do desire
Your life may still respire
Such sweetness as your cast attire.

1 APPROACHED the pessimist with
the slightly self-conscious air of one
who anticipates a greeting effusive,
even overwhelming.
The pessimist regarded me with a
sombre eye.
“Awfully glad, old chap,” I began,
“that I was able to give you the
straight tip about those ‘Rainbow
Mines.’”
“Why?” inquired the pessimist.
I shook my head, intending to con-
vey the melancholy experienced by
one whose infallible advice has been
ignored.
“So you didn't buy any, then 2"
“I bought five hundred,” returned
the pessimist without enthusiasm.
“By Jove . Then you've made a
clear thousand Splendid ' " I tried
to look as if I were not his benefactor.
“Made a clear thousand 2" repeated
the pessimist drearily ; “what an ex-
traordinary idea! Do you seriously
believe that anyone has ever made
money without sweating for it 2."
“I shan't give you a good tip again,”
I said, aggrieved.
“Thanks,” said the pessimist with
some feeling.
“Most people would be glad enough
to get a thousand pounds for nothing,”
I added.
“Get it—yes; but who can 2 The
great charm of unearned money is its
elusiveness. It is like a beautiful
woman ; you can never know that it
is really yours—it never is. If you
have stolen it the great bony hand
of the law reaches out blunderingly,
clumsily, yet surely, till it wrests the
treasure from you. If you have made
it on the Stock Exchange, the race-
course or the roulette table, no bank is
strong enough to hold it, no army
strong enough to guard it.”
“Have a cigarette, old man 2" |
said soothingly.
He ignored me. “Back, back, back
it must go to the earth or the turf or
the green cloth that conceived it,”
intoned the pessimist. “No man can
ever say that he has made money by
gambling: it is not his, it belongs to
the great god of Chance who is jealous
of his own.”
“Look here,” I interrupted, “if you
put your thousand into Consols it will
be yours all right.”
“Never,” returned the pessimist pas-
sionately. “Who can rob me of the
knowledge that the money is still the
child of chance, inheritor of all that
such parentage implies 2 How can I
clude the fact that it is crying aloud
to go back to its true environment 2

“J know a man,” I said, “who made

“Afterwards,” said the pessimist
with concentrated melancholy, “he
persuaded her to put it all into “a
good thing,' and lo! it was gone l’’
“Well, that 's curious,” said I. “I
had no idea that you knew the Robin-
sons.”
“I don't,” returned the pessimist.
“You guessed 2’’
The pessimist shrugged his shoulders.
“You may call it guessing,” he re-
turned with gloomy significance.
“Well then, there 's another man,” I
urged, “who, to my certain knowledge,
made fifty thousand in rubber.”
“Is he dead?” asked the pessimist
with a gleam of interest.
“Of course not.”
“No one has ever made money by
gambling until he is dead,” replied
the pessimist drearily, “and then, by
the law of God and man, he has lost
fifty pounds and handed it straight it.”
His voice sank to a murmur and his
sombre contemplative eyes rested on
me. “What are you doing with your
‘Rainbow ’ shares?” he asked.
“Oh, I? I've taken my profit, and
I'm just looking round for something
safe to put it into.” I tried to keep
out of my voice the sense of triumph
and virtue that I experienced.
The pessimist nodded, silent and
thoughtful. “Let us walk on to-
gether,” he said. “Where are you
bound 2 ”
“I was going to look in at Cook's
office,” I said. “My wife and I
thought of taking a little trip this
winter to Mont—er—to the South of
France.”
The pessimist's reply, which termi-
mated our conversation, was so utterly
inconsequent that it need not be re-
corded.

THERE is a pious name, all unrecorded
By the biographers of this proud isle,
A soul whose poignant gifts were not rewarded
By popular applause or noble style,
Yet, 'mongst the lords of Science and Invention,
Oh, more enduring than the basic rocks
Should be the fame of him I'm proud to mention,
The unassuming genius, Mr. Cox.
He lived unknown, as far as one can gather;
We know him only by his labour's fruits;
Who's Who did not expend a lot of blather
Upon his wife, his clubs and his pursuits;
This, to one smaller, might have been depressing,
Not so to him ; alone he chose to live,
Triumphed alone, and won that tardy blessing
Which it is now my privilege to give.
We may not learn what patience he expended
On the life-labours that enrich us now,
How greatly he contrived, how much amended,
What pensive weight oppressed that kingly brow.
Beauty he added to internal sweetness;
Colour with form he tenderly conjoined;
And, having wrought the whole to full completeness,
Probably found the profits were purloined.
For did he win to wealth 2 I gravely doubt it.
I trow he had no patent for his wares.
Those were around who made no bones about it
But filched his secret, and the gain was theirs.
They learned his lore; they packed in crates and boxes
His golden spoil, to swell their ill-won gains;
One thing alone he had—the name of “Cox's "
Clung like a label, and to-day remains.
And now, when all old bonds are being broken,
Sweet Cox, in thee we find a common tie.
Our systems quarrel; angry words are spoken;
Mean politics have set the land awry;
Wealth is at war with envy, church with chapel;
But this one touch of kinship heals our ranks—
That every true-born Briton loves an apple,
And, for his “Cox's Orange,” gives thee thanks.
DUM-DUM.
“After killing a foxhound in Hampton Moss, hounds failed to
account for a good traveller ousted from Maesfen, and lost at Bickley,
with Cholmondeley as his point. Morgan then took hounds to the
Wyches, and in that trappy country a ripping fox was pushed out from
the Cae Dae cover, which gave hounds plenty to do as he flapped around
the surrounding covers before taking a line for Iseoed. Reaching
there a desperately hard-fought fight ensued right away to within a
mile of Fenn's Bank Station, where hounds snaffled him in the back-
yard of a cottage after a spanking run of some sixty minutes."
In his spare time (when he is not killing foxhounds)
the writer should try his hand at a translation of the
Iliad. It would give more scope for the exercise of his
special gift.
“But the particular ball which bowled Woolley very likely pitched
just outside his leg stump, and Woolley, thinking that the ball was
going to break, pats his legs.”—Erening News.
If Woolley does this every time he thinks the ball is going
to break, it is a mannerism of which he would be very well rid.

(By Mr. Punch Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF it is excitement you are after, you will find what you
want and more also in Mr. ARTHUR APPLIN's latest, most
appropriately entitled No Limit (F. W. WHITE). Here
are horse whips, cigars, champagne, poisonous drugs,
any amount of racehorses and love, and every modern
convenience of melodrama. Paul Venables is the musical
comedy king, and holds all the money; Itobert is the
incomparable manservant and blackguard, who executes
infallibly all the cavesdropping; Marie O'Malley is the
spotless heroine who undergoes all the misunderstanding,
and Jim Smith is the disreputable husband, inopportunely
appearing and reluctantly dying, who does most of the
drinking. Marie has only to appear on the boards of the
Ingénue Theatre to take all London by storm; she has only
to appear in this book to become at once the victim of all
its perverse circumstances and complications, the object of
all the naughty machinations of its people. It is true that
these last refer to attempted murders, forgeries, abductions,
turf swindles, and bogus funerals as “their little games,”

must necessarily be sneaking, but few will start reading it

N a vast building (so old that its walls were grumbling to pieces) were gathered together a number of persons in
the throes of bad temper and dismay. They were typical English men and English women, all as gloomy as
deans, whose one bond was that they hated the Insurance Bill; and they were met in the Hall of Discontent (for such
it was) to protest against it.
All of them, it must be understood, approved of national insurance, and thought there was nothing better than
that provision should be made by the State for the sick and infirm, and that some burden of personal obligation
should fall upon the participants in such a scheme, and upon their employers; but all were agreed that nothing
could be more inept than the actual scheme which had been devised. Being thus agreed, they had assembled in this
famous and much over-worked building in the best of bad tempers and were exchanging their grievances with
every variety of animation tinged with fury and disgust.
Here were doctors who saw their time so occupied in attending to the poor at a ruinous rate of pay that they
would have no leisure to make both ends meet by securing adequate remuneration from the rich. Here were butlers
who had each been for many years with some wealthy family, and, having themselves had every attention during that
service whenever they were ill, were wholly unable to see why any servant should be so suspicious of his employer as
to wish for any other guarantee against illness or old age than that employer's affluence or good nature. Here were
servant-girls whose one thought was the privation that would be caused to them by forfeiting threepence a week
when in good health for any benefits that might accrue in the extremely problematical contingency of their being ill.
Here were mistresses whose tongues clicked and ached in anticipation of the tedium and weariness of licking two or
three stamps a week, and who keenly resented the motion of any State control of their domestic affairs.
Here, too, were Members of Parliament, worn out with the exacting task of supporting the Bill at the
beginning, attacking it in the middle, and voting for it at the end; and other Members of Parliament, whose
abstinence from voting caused them equal misery. Here were patriots, up in arms against the introduction of
an Inquisition made in Germany; Individualists who loathed the idea of being dragooned into the discharge of
the common duties of humanity; and Statisticians who had satisfied themselves that the foundations of our national
credit were irretrievably undermined by Georgian finance. And here, finally, were stalwart men of England
whose arms were suffering from writer's cramp induced by signing petitions against the Bill.
Such were some of the numerous company assembled in the Hall of Discontent, all brought thither by
the enormities of the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER. But as a matter of fact, although their objections to the
Bill were certainly as stated, these were by no means all. That there was an Insurance Bill at all was, it is true, a
great offence; but as all men, save Mr. BERNARD SHAw, are illogical animals, there was still an even deeper cause of

complaint in the fact that, since it called itself a National Insurance Bill, it did not complete the programme and
insure the nation against everything, and, in particular, against discontent.
“For after all,” as one of the more brainy of the company said—probably a member of the staff of The Daily
Mail, which had gone further than the other enemies of the Bill by collecting money to fight it—“for after all there
is sickness of the mind as well as sickness of the body, and why doesn't the CHANCELLOR, if he is so jolly clever
and embracive and benevolent, protect us also from that ?” ... --
“Exactly,” replied another; “if it did that I would support it—as I have always supported the spirit at the
back of it.” • “ , ” .
“Of course,” said a third; “what I want is provision against low spirits.”
“Depression,” said a fourth. . . . . -
“That tired feeling,” said a fifth.
“Want of interest in life,” said a sixth.
“Joylessness,” said a seventh.' .
“Pessimism in the pulpit,” said an eighth.
“Melancholia from loss of form at golf,” said a ninth.
“Grief at the departure of the Russian dancers,” said a tenth.
How much longer this dismal chorus would have continued cannot be said, for at that moment the door
opened, and through the Hall of Discontent ran a quickening impulse as though sunshine had burst through a
bank of clouds. Everyone looked up to see who had brought about this change, and behold there was Mr. Punch
with his face irradiated by smiles, and beside him his faithful Toby, harnessed to a toy waggon which bore a con-
siderable load. - -- -
“Good day to you all,” said the genial new-comer; “I am here, I fancy, just in time, judging by the remarks I
caught as I was entering. So you want,” said he, “not less insurance, but more. You can tolerate being looked after
when you are ill, only if you are also looked after when you are in the dumps? Well, it is perfectly simple. Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE did not put it in his Bill because he left the matter to me. “I’ll see to the sickness of the body," he said, “if
you, Mr. Punch, will see to the sickness of the mind.’ And we struck the bargain. He has given you his half, and
you don't like it. Now take mine,” and so saying he turned to Toby's waggon and liſted from it its burden.
“You ask,” he went on, “for insurance against melancholy. I have it here in the mass. You can also
have it in weekly instalments. . It is not free; the deadly threepence again makes his horrid appearance; but it is
