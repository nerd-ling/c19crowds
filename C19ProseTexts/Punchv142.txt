REST AFTER TOIL.
(1 Welcome on its Eve to 1912, being
Leap Year.)
OUR labour hath its ending,
The lute at last is dumb;
On trouser-knees past mending
No more you'll catch me bending;
Ladies, your turn has come.
Boneath what open casements
Have I not sung my suits;
With what profound abasements,
What tactful self-effacements
Avoided parents' boots
To hearts how prone to harden
For three long years I've put
What pleas for grace or pardon
In many a twilit garden,
How dampish underfoot |
Ay, more, when out to dinner
How oft I've murmured “Stoop,
Sweet angel, to this sinner,”
And tried all arts to win her
Before we'd touched the soup.
And when I found no favour,
Of one fond hope bereft,

(In case her heart might waver)
Who simpered on my left,
And said, “Shall we get married ?”
And when she answered “Pish ' "
Beheld my future arid,
My day-dreams twice miscarried,
Not halfway through the fish.
On country walks, at dances,
Well have I waged the strife;
Hang it! with all these chances
Anyone's fond advances
Ought to have bagged a wife.
But no! without compunction
(Or stay, there was that touch
Of pity's mellowing unction
IFrom Maud, at Blisworth Junction)
You've all replied, “Not much.”
And now the tourney's closing
Has left me limp and done;
'Tis time for dreams and dozing,
Three years of hard proposing
Do take it out of one.
But if my field of vision
Has overlooked some few
Who might without derision
Have watched the dart's incision
Where Love had pinked me
through—
Some maids or fair or clever
Who did not mean to flout
My amorous endeavour,
(But by some fluke I never
Happened to find them out)—
Behold, Convention's ſetters
Have vanished like a ghost;
Ye must be Love's abettors,
Girls, and I'd like your letters,
Please, by an early post.

LONDON'S CRYING NEED.
(Interview with Mr. Greirs, Cramer.)
“THE trouble with London, as I view
it," said the great entrepreneur, “is
its poverty of entertainment. I am
astonished at it. I go out for long
walks and frequently find myself in a
street with no picture-palace in it. I
understand that there actually are still
suburbs that have not given their name
to a local Empire. In the whole length
of Harley Street there is no play-house.
This means,” he continued, " that quite
a host of people are forced, owing to
the disproportion between the number
of Londoners and the number of seats,
still to spend their evenings at home.
It is this evil that I have set out to
remedy. My campaign is clear. I can-
not quite manage one theatre for every
Londoner, but I am pledged to find
every Londoner a seat at some perform-
ance or other on every night of the year.

“That is your life work?” I said.
“Precisely. It is the task I have set
myself, and I am busy acquiring sites
for music-halls, theatres, picture-palaces
everywhere in this city, north, south,

Forty-eight dogs which have been
trained for war have just reached the
Italians in Tripoli. They are intended
to supplement the ordinary dogs of war
which were let slip several months ago.

The Daily Mail informs us that on
Christmas Eve a set of twins, Mr.
HENRY Jollie and Mr. D'Avid Joi. LIE,
who were born at Leslie in Fifeshire,
celebrated their 87th birthday. Frankly,
we must decline to be interested in
them. In our opinion twins ought
never to be allowed to exceed the age
of seven. After that they become an
absurdity. Picture these two old
gentlemen both dressed in Fauntleroy
suits and walking about hand-in-hand.
The Christmas Number of The
Strand Magazine publishes a collection
of Spoonerisms. But we miss our
favourite. Here it is. Mr. Spooner,

out with a lady, in the conservatory.
“Ah, Williamson,” cried the genial
don, “you've got a nosey little cook
there !” : '.
A strange tale comes from Chicago.
A sect of Sun-worshippers have been
bringing up a little boy as the Sun's
Earthly God, and, in order to increase
his divinity, he was fed on white grapes
and beer. This beverage—if we may
judge from our experience of devoted
beer-drinkers–ought certainly to give
him the right colouring for a Sun-God.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOME RECENT DECISIONS.
By the Rules of Golf Committee.
WILLESDEN BEC GoLF CLUB.—In
a match-play competition B, a be-
ginner, has a six-foot put for a half.
As he is about to make his stroke his
opponent. A points to some dead leaves
in the line of the put, and saying,
“You’re allowed to move these,
you know,” brushes them aside for
him. B thanks him and holes out.
What is the ruling in the two follow-
ing cases 2 (1) B claims the hole on
the ground that A interfered with the
line of his put. (2) B does not claim
the hole, whereupon A claims it on the
ground that B did not enforce the
penalty against him. * -
ANswer.--(1) The hole is B's. He
has acted like a golfer and a sportsman.
(2) The hole is A's. B's conduct in not
enforcing the penalty may be “cricket,”
but it is distinctly “not golf.”
MIDDLESEX WALLEY GoLF CLUB.—
Our course is a very wet one in winter.
During the recent rains A (24) and
B (18) played a match. At the third
tee, only one spot on the teeing ground
was above water. A accordingly teed
up there and attempted to drive, but
was unfortunate enough to miss the
sphere altogether. The only available
place on the tee was now occupied by
A's ball, and B therefore directed his
caddie to build a pyramid of sand over
it, from the top of which he played
his ball successfully, leaving the sand
intact. A gets out with a niblick, and
B thereupon alleges that he has in-
curred a penalty stroke by grounding
his club while playing out of sand. Is
this right?
ANswer.—This is a very difficult
problem which does not seem to have
arisen before. It should be dealt with
by the club committee; the local rules,
if necessary, being altered to meet the
case.
NEw River GoLF CLUB.—A is play-
ing B a friendly game for half-crowns.
A, who fell into the river off the first
tee through over-swinging, sneezes
violently just as B is driving at the
seventeenth, with the result that B
foozles badly. A is very apologetic
and says, “Have it again, old fellow,”
which B does. A does not sneeze this
time, but looks exactly as if he were
going to, and B, in his anxiety to get
his stroke over before the sneeze should
come, ſoozles even worse, sending his
ball into a pond. B now claims the
right to play the first ball, as being
the better of the two. Is this in accord-
ance with the rules 2
ANswer.—By Rule 297, Sub-sect. c
(Sneezing), if a player interſere with
village.
|sneezing, snoring, watering at the eyes,
inflating the chest or in any other way,
he shall lose the hole. A therefore lost
the hole. On the other hand, the
suggestion that the stroke should be
played again was contrary to the rules,
and B therefore also lost the hole for
adopting it. Perhaps they had better
have their match again, and be more
careful on the first tee.
GoLDER's GREEN GoLF CLUB. — A,
who is playing his ninth, gets into
casual water in a bunker. He says to
B, who is just short of the green,
“How many 2” and B says, “Seven,”
whereupon A picks up. A's caddie
then alleges that B had really played
eleven, and B admits this, and says
that his answer to A referred to the
number of his children, about whom
he thought A was talking. Is there
any rule to meet this case ?
ANswer.—Yes, B was evidently
lying when A was in casual water,
and he can be “dropped " without
penalty.
By the Rules of Billiwi ds Committee.
Little H EDINGHAM.—For the last
forty years there has been a com-
petition here at Christmas on the Fox
and Hounds table, open to all the
In the final this year, A, who
wanted 25 to win, was in the middle of
a break when he was accused by B of
playing with the red ball. A indig-
nantly denied this; but the landlord,
who knows the balls better than any-
one, was called in to identify them, and
supported B. What is the rule in this
case ? Ought not the balls to be
“spotted"?
ANswer.—They had much belter be
painted.
THE BLUE PIG.-A’s ball is in the
jaws of the pocket, with the red just
next to it. A announces that he is
going to do a massé shot, but misses
his own ball and drives his cue clean
through the pocket. May he have
another shot 2
ANswer.—Legally he may, but he
would probably be better in bed.
THE NEST, ASTON PARVA.—I was
playing B a hundred up this evening,
and in the middle of a break, when I
had already made two and had the
balls nicely together, B accidentally
(so he says) touched the spring of the
billiard table and it turned into a dining
table. What ought I to do?
ANswer.—Have dinner.
By the Rules of Chess Committee.
ERNEST ToxiKINson, B.A.—A and B
are playing a game of chess. Some of
the pieces are missing, and A has to use
a cigar-holder and a small china bull-
finch in the place of the King and one
happens to be standing on the King's
square, and B checks it with his Queen
three squares away. A promptly takes
the Queen with his bull-finch, and a
heated discussion ensues, B. alleging
that this china ornament is the King
and that it is the cigar-holder which is
the Rook. The fact that the bull-finch
was on the King's square is advanced
as an argument by him ; but, on the
other hand, A distinctly remembers
castling. Is there any rule about it?
ANSWER.—It is best to come to a
clear understanding at the beginning of
the game as to the values of the different
pieces; otherwise discussions are bound
to arise. . This is a case where Rule
139c (1911) comes into force: “If
either player is dissatisfied with the
position of the game he can knock the
board over accidentally while rising to
look for the matches.”
By the Rules of Dumb-Crambo
- Committee.
12NNERDALE GRANGE.-A, B, C and
D are playing dumb-crambo against
W, X, Y and Z. A, B, C and I) are
out, and the word to rhyme with is
“home.” They do “gnome,” “comb,”
“foam,” “dome” (with great diffi-
culty), “ loam ” (with even more
trouble), “roam '' and “tome,” but all
are hissed. After another ten minutes
in the cold they think of “chrome,”
and give what they allege to be a
representation of it. This also is hissed.
Finally they announce that they give it
up, and are informed that the word is
“bone " ' What is the rule on this
point? -
ANswer.—The rule is that W, X, Y
and Z now go out, and A, B, C and D
think of the word “bicycle.” Then
they call W, X, Y and Z in, and tell
them that it rhymes with “Spain.”
It will be found that there are nearly
fifty rhymes to “Spain.”

The Tube and the Pantomime.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Do you think it
would be any good for me to write to
the Traffic Manager of the Piccadilly
Tube and let him know that there is a
theatre in Drury Lane, within easy
reach of Covent Garden Station, and
that it might be convenient if he would
stop a few more of his trains there of
an evening during the Pantomime
season 2 It was all very well to
ignore the patrons of the Opera, but
the Pantomime is very dear to the
humble Tubist. And he doesn't care
about being shot through to Holborn,

A RED LETTER DAY.
JANUARY 1st, 1912.
THE clocks had all struck, the due
rites were performed, the last carriage
rolled away, the distant pealing of bells
ceased, and I seated myself before the
dying fire-as usual.
I did not hear them enter, I only knew
they would come, and then that they
were present. The same old crowd, the
same bedraggled shamefaced crew. I
recognised them well, for they had grown
old in my acquaintance—all save one
bright youth who, with hope and ambi-
tion glowing on his brow, was a stranger
to me, though I knew him at once for
“Clean-the-car-every-Saturday.”
First in age and mildewed neglect,
with dejected droop and downcast eyes,
was the ancient “Get-up-early,” a
creature nearly as old as myself, and
standing abashed at his side was his
partner in disgrace, “Work-before-
breakfast.” I had been wont to greet
the pair on this yearly occasion with a
burst of enthusiastic welcome which
warmed me to the bone and set me
tingling not merely with the glow of
resolution but with the exultation of
actual achievement, but now they did
not awaken cordiality: my rising pulse
faltered and sank.

and debilitated, so tousled and effete,
so dingy, disspirited and broken, that
anyone might have been ashamed to
greet them as old acquaintances. I
changed the salutation on my lips
adroitly into a cough and turned my
eyes to sort over the rest of the un-
happy shapes.
Each exhibited a more forlorn lassi-
tude and dejection than I could have
supposed possible of any concepts of
mine, and it occurred to me that this
was their miserable way of growing
old: a decay due to indifference, bore-
dom, indolence and equivocation.
“Dumb-bells-twice-a-day,” “Keep-priv-
ate-accounts,” “Avoid-coffee,” “Forego-
taxis,” “Wash-the-dog,” “Flannel-
waistcoats,” all wore an air which
might have passed for senility had I
not known each to be relatively young.
But among all the enervated wretches
before me none provoked a deeper
disgust than that degraded brute “Bed-
at-twelve.” As though his own presence
were not discreditable enough, the
creature was attended by a ghostly
shadow which I recognised only too
well as the detested spectre of “Bed-
at-eleven,” long since defunct. Another
haggard ruffian I would peremptorily
have ordered from my presence had I
not known that he would refuse to obey

fixed me steadily with a reproachful eye
and my impatience increased. Even
that glorious youth “Clean-the-car-
every-Saturday” found less favour in
my eyes the longer I contemplated
him. I perceived only too clearly that
he also was a bad egg. I rose from my
seat.
“Gentlemen " — I addressed my
New Year's Resolutions collectively—
“gentlemen, you have come here in
accordance with an honoured, im-
memorial custom ; you will therefore
understand that it is in no mood of
light commentary, but with deep con-
viction and grave purpose, that I now
inform you that you are, and have
always been, each one of you, Rotters.
“When I mean to do a thing I do it.
When I want an incentive to stiffen
a purpose, my conscience supplies it.
Your office has ever been to urge an
immaterial modification in the calendar
as a motive for reform. This is an
affront to my intelligence. Therefore I
say, ‘Git.’”
I uttered this direction with such
vehemence that the dingy crowd melted
away into the pattern of the wall
paper, and at the same moment a sturdy
beaming apparition seemed to condense
from the air and take shape before me.
I was in the presence of “Admit-no-

my old Aunt Sarah, who for some
reason sent me a Christmas card this
year, while I, for the eternal reason of
economy, had sent her none. “Never
mind, I'll get her a New Year card to-
day,” I said, and went to sleep. The
first seventeen years of the night I
spent in a taxi, trying to find a shop
where New Year cards were sold. I
went to London, Edinburgh, Paris and
Cirencester, but I was told everywhere
that such cards could only be obtained
to order, and that it would take three
weeks. It was a longish ride, and the
indicator showed £1,774 17s. 8d.

[JANUARY 3, 1912.
THE MERCURY.
WE were aboard ship—at least I couldn't help feeling
we were aboard ship, for we were surrounded by brisk,
fresh-faced, naked-footed sailor boys, all dressed in the
immortal habiliments of the British tar, and all calculated
to give an irresistibly nautical air to the most terrestrial
scene. Puffs of briny wind and stinging spray seemed to
blow from their loose blue trousers, and the whole place
appeared to rock on the waves as the boys tumbled up and
fell into line. And yet how came a moist gravel path—for
that was unquestionably what the naked feet were running
on—on board any ship however modern ? And what
meant these trees and bushes and these patches of damp
December grass? No, we were not actually on board ship,
luckily for us, since we were landsmen and the wind was
not without a suggestion of swayings and tossings that
might have driven the blood from our cheeks and forced us
to take refuge below. We were in the grounds belonging
to the Training Ship Mercury, and the jolly boys, who
were now smartly ranked in order on either side of us,
were the ship's company. - - -
“These boys,” said the Director—but where had we
seen that Director before? Memories of the Queen's Club,
of Lord's and the Oval, of brilliant centuries, of football
matches, of swift races, of leaps through the cleft air ending
(prophetically enough) in
A station like the herald Mercury
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill –
all these came thronging back into our minds, a resurrec-
|tion of youth and bloom and strength and ardour, as we
| Contemplated the Director's athletic figure and listened to his
| words—“these boys,” said the Director, “come to us from
| many parts of England, but mainly from the South. Some
t
are boys of working-class families that can manage to pay
the boys while they are here; some of them are from the
workhouses—many of our best boys come from there. We
take them at any age from 12% to 15, but we prefer to get
them at about 14. Just look at them well, remembering
where they come from, and tell me if you've ever seen a
better, smarter and likelier set of boys anywhere?”
I never have, and that's the plain truth. Not Eton or
Harrow or Rugby or any other public school, or even
Osborne, splendid as Osborne is, could show boys more
alert in mind and body, more eager to do all things
thoroughly, more joyous in their movements or with an
honester soul shining in their eyes than these boys of The
Mercury.
“The fact is,” went on the Director, “that we train
them to think for themselves and do things for themselves.
Character is what we aim at, and we get it in the fine old
public school fashion by giving the boys responsibility.
The section-leaders are boys; boys look after the mess;
boys keep the accounts; boys are to a large extent made
responsible for good order and discipline; and there's one
other great point—they are always occupied, never idle."
At this moment a bugle sounded, and away marched my
young friends to the great hall, where they were to give or
witness the entertainment preparatory to the prize-giving
that was to wind up their term. A little way off, in the
Hamble, lay the Mercury, the central point of their present
traditions and their aspirations, the central point, in the
future of bright and happy memories. Near her lay the
hospital ship, which we visited. There we found only one
poor little fellow kept away from the festivities by an
abscess, but doing his best to give us a smile of welcome.
“Mind you,” said the Director, “the Mercury, isn't a
Our boys are all boys of good character. What do they do
afterwards? Nearly all of them go into the Royal Navy, a
few into the merchant service, and a few into regimental
bands; but the Royal Navy takes the bulk of them; so we
feel that we're doing a national work. How do they get
on in the Navy 2 I'll tell you. Ninety per cent. of our
boys reach the higher ratings there; of “shore-boys” not
more than twenty per cent. reach them. That shows the
value of our work.”
Soon we found ourselves in the thick of the entertain-
ment. There were songs, and no songs ever went with a
greater go. There were hornpipes, and our legs seemed to
yearn to join the twinkling legs on the stage. There was
signalling, and England duly expected that every man
would do his duty; there were carols, and oh, how sweetly
they sounded as the little fellows trolled them out; there
was drill, the most animated drill I have ever seen; and
the boys' band, greatly and successfully daring, played brave
strains from Parsifal. Then came the prize-giving, and, as
each little tar took his book or his portfolio or his certificate,
he saluted the prize-giver, and then, turning smartly, saluted
the audience. There never was a more delightful occasion,
and the delight was of the kind that gives you now and then
a lump in the throat from mere excess of pleasure.
Now you would suppose that an institution doing this
splendid work would be rolling in wealth; but there you're
wrong. A certain amount it does get in fees, in Admiralty

Question 1. Who is the editor of
The Spectator 2
Nineteen recruits failed to answer
this question. One (presumably of
superior education) replied ADDISON.
Other replies were Mr. LLoyd GEORGE,
Mr. SIEvieR (which shows some
acquaintance with leading weekly
journals), and Mr. CADBURY. One
suspects the last answer of irony, as
it is well known that The Spectator
does not publish betting news.

Question 4. What is Free Trade?

with Free Beer and argued pointedly
in its favour.

All answered this question well (with

Another spoilt a highly satisfactory
answer by making two selections, The

the whole the replies were most dis-

least one recruit would have named

HoBBs and WILFRED RHoDEs were
frequently named. Amongst others

reply was evidently made under a
misapprehension), and DANNY MAHER.

beauty is more than maintained, but
it is wasted upon the humour of the
dialogue, or, if you like, the humour
of the dialogue is wasted upon it;
anyhow, they seemed incongruous.
You will, of course, tell me that
humour depends largely upon the ele-
ment of incongruity; but pure beauty
of form and colour, as distinguished
from that magnificence which is always
so near the borderland of the ridiculous,
seldom lends itself to the incongruity
which is of the essence of humour.
Instead of working together, they are
here nearly always in opposition; and
the fun, even if it had been much
better fun, was bound to suffer in the
struggle.
And a struggle it was, from the
very first scene where Orpheus (in
the person of Mr. CourticF. Pounds),
of orchestral instruments, to be funny
about his conjugal infelicity, received
no sort of assistance from an American
Eurydice (Miss PERRY), who was only
concerned to do justice to her big notes,
and left the humour of things (if any)
to whoever felt like it. Mr. Liosiſ,
MACKINDER felt like it, and he was a very
busy and agile and clever Pluto through-
out; but he never made me share his
own merriment. As for the humours
of Olympus (loosely referred to as
“Olympia"), I liked the quiet methods
of Mr. FRANK STANMoRE as Jupiter;
but I seem to remember, from twenty
years ago, a pantomime called Venus,
treating of the same High Life, that
afforded me (younger as I was, and
less captious, at that period) a vast deal
more amusement. The novelty of Mrs.
Grundy's intrusions gave Miss Lottie
WENNE a chance that she was not
likely to neglect. It did not matter
much what she had to say, because
she has her own way of saying almost
anything; and this was fortunate, for
she was not too well served with her
dialogue, and the best joke put into her
lips—“A fig-leaf for your mythology!"
—was itself nearly as ancient as the
first myth.
Time, however, if it makes the old
joke older still, will furnish fresh ones.
Only no more pantomime puns, I do
politics or social fashions. Nor will ||
it, I imagine, undermine the loyalty
of those who follow, for reasons best
known to themselves, the cult of
musical comedy. Nor, once again, is
it A Midsummer Night's Dream that it
should content the habitués of a house
long, known for the splendour of its
classical revivals. But all the same,
I cannot honestly advise anyone to go
out of his way to miss it.
“Hop O' MY THUMP.”
If I join the annual chorus of re-
viewers and hint that the Management
of Drury Lane has once more catered
for all tastes, this is not to imply that
everybody was pleased all the time.
There were things that certainly were
not to my poor liking. To begin with
the worst, there was a “patriotic" song
implore...Mrs. Grundy, in her Prologue
(excellently made and delivered), had
promised that we should have none of
these terrors; and her pledge was
badly broken.
Meanwhile, there was one feature in
the performance that could not easily
have been bettered, and that was the
gaiety, obviously sincere, of the choral
dances, carried out in the true spirit of
OFFENBACH's music. And I take away

In this part Mr. GEORGE GRAves was
at his very best. The scene of his

Mr. BARRY LUPINo employed other
methods and was in the knockabout
business, but he still preserved intact
the stolid gravity from which he took
his name. And there were two great
actors whose features we never saw, and
who preferred to remain anonymous—
so true is it that the greatest art con-
ceals itself. Between them they made
up the most superb steed I could wish
to meet. The angle at which I was per-
mitted to view the stage did not allow
me to catch sight of the vagaries of
this animal in his stall; but, when he
came out into the open and strenuously
resisted the combined efforts of Messrs.
WiLL EVANs and BARRY LUPINo to
harness him to their Thespian cart, I
found him a source of overwhelming
joy. Finally, there was the brave
figure of the diminutive Hop o' my

RENFE MEYER, who for all her con-
fidence and courage never wore the
objectionable air of a precocity, always
moved the audience to a running
murmur of very human sympathy.

the lyrics were rather indifferent. I
only detected one of any merit, a
topical song entitled “Ringdom Con-

Miss Violet LorAINE, who was far
happier here than in the heroic depart-

THE HOLIDAY JAUNT.
.WE discussed the matter this way and that for some
time, and eventually we decided that we would go to
London together and then split up into two separate
parties for theatrical purposes.
It came about in this way. Everybody knows that,
unless you go to London at least once and see a perform-
ance, holidays don't count. When school begins again
you must have something, even if it's only a circus, to put
up against Enid or Thelma or Bridget, when they tell
you about their excitements. The best thing is a real
theatre, so we settled that we would go to a real theatre
| on some convenient afternoon.
Mother suggested Peter Pam as being both old and
new; but Helen said, “No—nothing would induce her to
see Peter Pan again when there were so many other
things that she hadn't seen. Rosie, however, said that
Peter Pam fulfilled all her ideals, and she must see it
again. Then Peggy was called in to arbitrate. She at
once declared for something with swords and battles.
“But,” said Rosie, “you fight every day”—which is true,
for Peggy has a soldier's soul and a scout's uniform in
which she conducts crusades of extraordinary virulence
against a dusky and remote people called “Sasarens.”
They perish by millions every day in the more distant parts
of the garden, but are constantly renewed. Peggy, there-
fore, is all for swords—which, as everybody knows, are
sometimes called “skime-tars"—and for fights against
desperate odds. She declared immovably for a play of that
sort. Eventually, therefore, we settled that mother should
take Rosie and a friend to Peter Pam, while I, with Helen
and Peggy, affronted the full-blooded delights of The Three
Musketeers. Thus it happens that I can say nothing about
Peter Pan, but must confine myself to DUMAs.
In the train to London there were no great adventures.
Helen's toes touched the floor of the compartment: she is
growing up. Rosie's legs frankly dangled, and those of
Peggy, who is the shortest person in the world, projected
stumpily into the air beyond the edge of her seat. I own
I have a particular fancy for that sort of leg. It com-
bines plumpness with stiffness to the extreme point of
attractiveness. -
Well, we drove through London to our place of luncheon,
and on the way we counted soldiers and policemen on either
side of the taxi. Helen was ahead for a long time with
thirteen, but Peggy finally romped home near the Buck-
ingham Palace Road with a numerous detachment of
Guards. “Twenty thousand,” said Peggy—“I win"; and,
though Helen entered a protest, there was really no getting
out of it. Soldiers are soldiers, even when a lot of them
are marching together, and, besides, they had officers with
them, and it is one of the rules of the game that an officer on
foot counts two, while an officer on horseback counts three.
We lunched in a restaurant above a glorious and gigantic
shop where everything in the whole world can be bought.
There were ices. Need I say more to indicate the excellence
and luxury of the lunch 2. But it was noticed that lemonade
after ices tastes quite warm. This was considered regret-
table. The management should see to it.
: After lunch there was one false start. Peggy was swept
off obliviously under the maternal wing in a taxi bound for
Peter Pan, but was restored, flustered and indignant, after
| a minute or two, during which Helen and I, who had not
seen her departure, went from panic to panic through all
the vast and busy departments of the shop. With her,
thus recaptured, we reached the New Prince's Theatre, a
glittering palace of white and gold, only a quarter of an

overcoat and set it on a seat, and on its top we perched
Peggy, whose legs projected more plumply and stiffly
than ever. As the later arrivals brushed past them
on their way to their seats these legs sprang back again
like springs to their straight extension, and there, when
the row was filled, they finally remained, stumpy and
triumphant.
At last the music ceased and the curtain went up.
Heavens ! what a succession of emotions ! Before we knew
what had happened d'Artagnan, fresh from Gascony, had
three duels on his hands, and Anne of Austria had given
the Duke of Buckingham the fatal diamond buttons. The
scene changed, and the swords flew out, and d'Artagnan
was engaged with Athos, who with his left hand made a
gallant fight. Presto 1 the Cardinal's guards arrive—seven
of them—to arrest the duellists. "Tis a scurvy trick, and
d'Artagnan joins the three Musketeers in their resistance.
More swords flash out, and in a moment the four are
fighting the seven. It is a fearful tussle, but odds are
nothing to three Musketeers and a Gascon. Down go the
seven one after another like nine-pins, in every sort of
attitude, and the four remain standing, flushed and vic-
torious. But Peggy had observed one of the prostrate
Cardinalians. He, though a stout and sturdy man, had
been repeatedly thrust through, and was now extended
on his back. As the victors advanced to the footlights she
felt she must warn them: “Look out for that one,” she
and, indeed, the warrior's chest was rising and falling
with a vigour indicative of anything but death.
After this you might suppose that we had exhausted our
excitement. Not a bit of it. There were dreadful and
memorable fights yet to come, and Milady had yet to set
her snares, and the majestic shade of Bowdler was not
absent from the scene.
It was a grand afternoon, and we didn't fear to match
our Musketeers against their Peter when we all went home
in the train together.

and Welby, Squire and Sparkes. I felt
a glow within me to think that I made
one of such a company: all men of the
world, resourceful, cynical, rich, and
capable of mixing such excellent port
and such distinguished old brandy.

himself. “A bob,” he said. “Not The

Dan steadily poured out a glass of
the remarkable old brandy and sipped
it like the superb mondain he is.

last. The most capable man in Lon-

Our host beamed. He knew his Dan

Dan cried. “I want to propose the

THE ART OF THE THEATRE.
(With apologies to Mr. Gordon Craig.)
The Expert. Come, let us sit down
here, on the first page, and talk a while
of the Theatre and its art. Or rather I
will talk, and you will supply leading
and, if possible, intelligent interjections.
Tell me, do you know what is the art
of the Theatre 2
The Playgoer. Yes.
The Eapert. That is wrong; you
should have said No. I will therefore
tell you about it. First, then, it is
necessary that we should get out of
our minds all our preconceived notions
on this subject. You may, for example,
have heard of the art of the poet or
dramatist, or of the actor's art, or even
(in certain circles) of the great 'art of
the British Public. Now the art of the
Theatre is none of these things.
The Playgoer. What is it, then 2
The Earpert. That is better; I per-
ceive that we shall make something of
you yet. First and chiefly, the art of
the Theatre is the art of Pantomime—
an art that is unfortunately almost
extinct among us, save in the exhibi-
tions of Punch, or those more delicate
shows of fantoccioni which you have
The Playgoer. Pardon me, I found
them tiresome in the extr
The Earpert. And why was the plea-
sure you derived from them so much
keener than anything you would have
experienced in an ordinary theatre 2 I
will tell you. It was because, for the
first time, you were seeing the creation
of a single intelligence. The puppet
playhouse is as yet the only establish-
ment in the world where there can be
efficient stage direction, because only
there does the same master-hand in-
form not only the decor, the music, and
the dialogue, but even the gestures of
the mimes. The great aim of modern
theatrical reform therefore should be to
get rid of the bondage of independence.
The Playgoer. I like that
The Erpert. And correctly, of course.
Though all progress towards this ideal
must be gradual, one is glad to acknow-
ledge that in many places a certain
beginning has been made already. For
example the performances at the new
municipal theatre in Lollopopski (which
is, as you know, one of the most artistic
towns in central Poland) are of a signi-
ficance for the drama which should not
be overlooked. One of their greatest
recent successes had for its interpreters

run-down clock, and a smell of orange-
peel. The effect, I remember, was quite
extraordinary. Perhaps the wonderful
dramatic values in the smell of an orange
have never been studied by you ?
The Playgoer. I confess that is so.
The Earpert. Intelligent people who
have really studied the subject know, of
course, that the future development of
the drama will lie very largely in its
appeal to senses other than the aural
sense, and especially to that of smell.
Perfume is always actual and arresting,
whereas dialogue, as you may have
noticed, is often tedious. -
The Playgoer. I am noticing it now.
The Expert. Then again, you will
doubtless expect that I should say
something about the very helpful work
of Prof. Pappenschlaft, whose treatment
of Shakspearean tragedy (given in dumb-
show on an absolutely dark stage) has
been adopted with such success by the
directorate of the Arts Theatre at Cape
Shackleton. So much, therefore, for
what has actually been done. And
now shall I tell you what must be our
first consideration for the future ?

A SILLY ASS.
It is Chum's birthday to-morrow,
and I am going to buy him a little
whip for a present, with a whistle at
the end of it. When I next go into
the country to see him I shall take it
with me and explain it to him. Two
days' firmness would make him quite
a sensible dog. I have often threatened
to begin the treatment on my very
next visit, but somehow it has been
put off; the occasion of his birthday
offers a last opportunity.
It is rather absurd, though, to talk of
birthdays in connection with Chum,
for he has been no more than three
months old since we have had him.
He is a black spaniel who has never
grown up. He has a beautiful astra-
chan coat which gleams when the sun
is on it; but he stands so low in the
water that the front of it is always
getting dirty, and his ears and the ends
of his trousers trail in the mud. A
great authority has told us that he is a
Cocker of irreproachable birth. A still
greater authority has sworn that he is
a Sussex. The family is indifferent—it
only calls him a Silly Ass. Why he
was christened Chum I don't know ;
and as he never recognises the name it
doesn't matter.
When he first came to stay with us
I took him a walk round the village.
I wanted to show him the lie of the
land. He had never seen the country
before and was full of interest. He
trotted into a cottage garden and came
back with something to show me.
“You’ll never guess,” he said.
“Look!” and he dropped at my feet
a chick just out of the egg.
I smacked his head and took him
into the cottage to explain.
“My dog,” I said, “has eaten one of
your chickens.”
Chum nudged me in the ankle and
grinned.
“Two of your chickens,” I corrected
myself, looking at the fresh evidence
which he had just brought to light.
“You don't want me any more?”
said Chum, as the financial arrange-
ments proceeded. “Then I'll just go
and find somewhere for these two.”
And he picked them up and trotted
into the sun.
When I came out I was greeted
effusively.
“This is a wonderful day,” he panted
as he wriggled his body. “I didn't
know the country was like this. What
do we do now 2 ”
“We go home,” I said; but Chum
had made a bee line for a small dark
object in the middle of a field. All his
instinct told him it was something
there he had his first disappointment.
It was nothing but an old boot. How-
ever, he was not going to own him-
self in the wrong. He picked it up
and brought it back to me in state.
That was Chum's last day of freedom.
He keeps inside the front gate now.
But he is still a happy dog; there is
plenty doing in the garden. There
are beds to walk over, there are
blackbirds in the apple-tree to bark at.
The world is still full of wonderful
things. “Why, only last Wednes-
day,” he will tell you, “the fishmonger
left his basket in the drive. There was
a haddock in it, if you'll believe me, for
Master's breakfast, so of course I saved
it for him. I put it on the grass just
in front of his study window, where
he'd be sure to notice it. Bless you,
there's always something to do in this
house. One is never idle.”
Chum has found, however, that his
particular mission in life is to purge
his master's garden of all birds. This
keeps him busy. As soon as he sees a
blackbird on the lawn he is in full cry
after it. When he gets to the place
and finds the blackbird gone he pre-
tends that he was going there anyhow ;
he gallops round in circles, rolls over
once or twice, and then trots back
again. “You didn't really think I was
such a fool as to try to catch a black-
bird?” he says to us. “No, I was just
taking a little run—splendid thing for
the figure.”
And it is just Chum's little runs over
the beds which call aloud for firmness
—which, in fact, have inspired my
birthday present to him. But there is
this difficulty to overcome first. When
he came to live with us an arrangement
was entered into (so he says) by which
one bed was given to him as his own.
In that bed he could wander at will,
burying bones and biscuits, hunting
birds. This may have been so, but it is
a pity that nobody but Chum knows
definitely which is the bed.
“Chum, you bounder,” I shout as he
is about to wade through the herb-
aceous border.
He takes no notice ; he struggles
through to the other side. But a
sudden thought strikes him, and he
pushes his way back again.
“Did you call me?” he says.
“How dare you walk over the
flowers ?”
He comes up meekly.
“I suppose I've done something
wrong,” he says, “but I can't think
what.”
I smack his head for him. He waits
until he is quite sure I have finished
and then jumps up with a bark, wipes
his paws on my trousers and trots into
“Chum !” I cry.
He sits down in it and looks all round
him in amazement.
“My own bed!” he murmurs. “Given
to me!”
I don't know what it is in him which
so catches hold of you. His way of
sitting, a reproachful statue, motionless
outside the window of whomever he
wants to come out and play with him
—until you can bear it no longer, but
must either go into the garden or draw
down the blinds for the day; his habit,
when you are out, of sitting up on his
back legs and begging you with his
front paws to come and do something
—a trick entirely of his own invention,
for no one would think of teaching him
anything; his funny nautical roll when
he walks, which is nearly a swagger, and
gives him always the air of having just
come back from some rather dashing
adventure; beyond all this there is still
something. And whatever it is, it is
something which every now and then
compels you to bend down and catch
hold of his long silky ears, to look into
his honest eyes and say—
“You silly old ass! You dear old
silly old ass!” A. A. M.
THE SWISS HOTEL.
II.--Sox1F. HINTS FOR BEGINNERs.
THERE is one question above all others
which confronts the Englishman on
his first visit in the winter season to a
Swiss hotel. He cannot burke it, nor
is it possible for him to postpone for a
single day the moment when he faces it.
The success of his holiday will largely
depend upon the attitude which he takes
up and the policy which he adopts in
regard to his bed. He is confronted at
the outset by a large, limp, snow-white
structure that is practically a cross
between a bolster and a quilt, and
reposes serenely on the counterpane.
It is known, I believe, as a duvet. Its
capabilities are great. Every man
must solve for himself the subtle
ratio that should be established between
the heater, the bedclothes, and the
open window in the matter of their
contribution to the temperature; and
the conclusions that follow do not pre-
tend to be more than a rough guide.
But as for the duvet, my experience is
that it is best to make no terms with
it. Far wiser to dispose of it while
you can still do so with a dispassionate
mind, than to grapple with it in the
exasperation of the morning. By then
you may be capable of anything.
Many have been constrained to crush
the thing (for it is infinitely , com-
pressible) and jam it wholesale into a
ewer, and thus present it to the cham-
more for the bag, but when he got
bermaid. This is an extreme course,

PUNCH, Ol
for in the first place she is not to blame,
and in the second it cannot be released
without a breach of the ewer. But,
having disposed of it by some less
barbarous method and substituted a
travelling rug and an overcoat, you
must face the larger problem again.
To sleep with the heater on and the win-
dow shut is to suffer partial suffoca-
tion; with the heater off and the win-
dow open is to be frozen almost stiff;
with the heater off and the window
shut is to create a sort of cold frowst,
enormously provocative of thirst. 1
do not say, however, that a happy
medium may not be found by diligent
experiment, with the heater partly on
and the window partly open.
Then again you will find beneath the
pillow a singular little three-cornered
wedge, so insinuated as to tilt the
sleeper slightly with his head up-hill.
A good place for this is the top of the
wardrobe. But if you can manage to
convey it downstairs without discovery
it makes a capital seat for a bob-sleigh.
Always provided that you are not
more than six feet high, you may now
expect to sleep in peace.
It is well to have a hot bath on the
first evening, not entirely on account
of its own intrinsic propriety, but in
order that you may steal the towel.
Those provided in the bedrooms are
inadequate. But you will do well to
conceal it, if possible, under lock and
key, as the chambermaid has seen that
done before.
You will probably find that the chest-
of-drawers also does duty as a wash-
stand. For this reason it is a wise
precaution to put nothing in the top
drawer except your umbrella and mack-
intosh, as a good deal of water finds its
way through. - -
Your balcony is very apt to bend a
little beneath your weight, especially
when under snow. Do not on that
account be deterred from using it.
There is a lot of spring about then),
and they don't often give way.
So much for your bedroom; here
follow a few words of guidance in regard
to the public rooms. Do not imagine
that you can escape from the band.
Should it drive you to try another hotel
you will be no better off. You will
find there not the same band, but the
same tunes. They are endemic.
The blotting-paper should be avoided.
The table-cloth will generally be found
more absorbent.
Make every effort to keep on good
terms with the concierge and he may
sometimes allow you to open a window
in the lounge. This may prevent
asphyxiation. -

This makes them exceedingly difficult
to handle. It is not a bad plan to get
the liſt-boy to hold the paper in position
while you read it.
Your last and most painful duty, be-
fore leaving for your train, will be to
get back the deposit paid on arrival for
the use of your toboggan, which you
have never seen after the first day—for
it is customary for every one to help
himself indiscriminately out of the com-
mon stock. The process of recovering
your ten francs is not however so
troublesome as it seems. For if you
anticipate any difficulty in altering the
number on the receipt it is always
easy enough to alter the number on the
toboggan. -
If you have taken all the liberties
suggested above, and expect to return
the following year to the samo hotel,
it is well on your departure to be
generous in tips. Should this escape
your memory, there will always be
somebody about to remind you of the
omission.

MR. REDMoND is not the first public
man of eminence to be involved in a
carriage accident. It is recorded by
Livy that when HANNIBAL was crossing
the Alps he was twice overturned in a
chariot drawn by mules, while Lord
CLIVE was seriously injured as a child
owing to the upsetting of his peram-
bulator by a runaway horse. CLIVE
lived to conquer India. The happy
omen will not be lost on the many
admirers of the great Irish statesman.
The gift of a tame wallaby to Lord
DENMAN, the Governor-General of
Australia, is not the first occasion on
which such presents have been made
to distinguished administrators. Thus
it is recorded that when CICERo was
proconsul of Cilicia the natives of that
province testified their appreciation of
his services by presenting him with a
pair of panthers, which for many years
formed one of the chief attractions of
the famous orator's villa at Tusculum.

that Mr. Fre, EMAN-THOMAS was re-
cently created Lord WILLINGDON. It
is a curious coincidence that in a book
of confessions Lord WILLING DoN re-

were Alfred TENNYsoN and Thomas

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PERSONALITY.
OUR telephone number is two double-
six double-six mine Central.
Every morning, just after breakfast,
the little bell rings, and Craikes or I
take off the receiver and ask it if it is
there. Every morning, just after break-
fast, the receiver says that it is, and
asks us if we are two double-six double-
six five Central. Every morning, just
after breakfast, I say, or Craikes says,
“No,” and there the matter ends for the
moment.
I say “every morning, just after
breakfast,” because the intervals when
this does not happen are so few and
short as to be negligible.
We have formed a conclusion about
Two double-six double-six five. Some-
one is in love with him and means to
go on being in love with him, even
if they give him the wrong number
every time. We feel that we have
been taken into this someone's confi-
dence, and are entitled to know a little
more about a love which does not mind
being aired at this chilly hour of the
morning. Listening, however, more
closely, we have been compelled to
notice that the voice is not always the
same. We are forced to the regrettable
conclusion that more than one person
is in love with Two double-six double-
six five. The more profoundly are we
intrigued about a personality which can
inspire such love at such an hour in
a variety of hearts. In short, we want
to know, who this Two double-six
double-six five is.
“We will,” we said, “pick him out
from the List of Subscribers.” We
examined the first page of this volume.
On it there were a hundred and
sixty-eight numbers, and two double-
six double-six five Central was not one
of them. We also found, by looking
hurriedly forward, that there are seven
hundred and twenty-nine more pages,
each containing the same amount of
numbers. “We will not,” we said, “pick
him out from the List of Subscribers.”
Last week we got a little clue. A
voice asked us suddenly “if we made
plum puddings?” The voice did not
actually mention two double-six double-
six five, but it was a case of the same
old mistake, we had no doubt. Plum
puddings are not, we were bound to
admit, consistent with our theory of
passion, but a theory must go by the
board when it collides with cold fact.
Here note in passing that we, Two
double-six double-six nine, live at the
Embankment end of the Temple. Our
next-door neighbour is (remember the
plum puddings) H.M.S. Buzzard. Put
two and two together, and you will find

AT THE PLAY.
“THE MIRACLE.”
THE arena of Olympia makes an ad-
mirable stage for a Royal Horse Show
or the crowded interior of a cathedral,
but for a single actor it is perhaps
a little roomy. Thus, in The Miracle,
it needs a circle of limelight (thrown
upon her from a hanging platform in
the roof) to enable The Knight, stationed
outside the great West doors, to locate
the object of his passion; but how he
contrives to set a precise value on her
charms without the aid of field-glasses,
I cannot hope to guess. And when a
spasm of attraction draws him to her
side he has to cover something under
a furlong before he can fold her in his
steely arms. Nor was I surprised that
the effort of carrying her out along this
tedious track made him impotent to
mount his cliarger at the first attempt.
An equal distance, in the other half
of the cathedral, had to be negotiated
whenever the nuns were sent for to
witness any miracle that occurred in
the centre. I never remember to have
seen so strong a body of religieuses
executing so lengthy a movement at
the double. It was a little unfortunate
that they should all have been required
to recognise the miracle at the same
moment, the rear contingent taking
their time from the screams of the
vanguard.
A grave difficulty for the manage-
ment lay in the impossibility of
disturbing the original scene. Once a
cathedral, always a cathedral. The
strangest things had to go on inside it.
I have assisted at some remarkably
secular demonstrations in the church
of the Ara Coeli in Rome on the
occasion of the Festivity of the Santiss-
imo Bambino, but never anything like
the goings-on in this place of worship
at Addison Road. There were murders
and violent elopements (done in defiance
of the laws of sanctuary); there were
feasts, and a sort of Lady Godiva
entertainment, and returns from the
chase or the battle, and other episodes
most unusual in the interior of a sacred
edifice. From the simple expedient of
pushing three trees and a grass mound
through the cathedral doors and a few
yards up the nave (“Movable Mountain
by Rudolph Dworsky,” as my pro-
gramme, anxioz's to give credit where
credit is due, informs me) we were to
gather symbolically that the outdoor
life of the world at large was before us;
but this did not quite suit the case of
the nuptial couch, which was thus
exposed to all the winds of heaven, or
of the Inquisition chamber, where the
proceedings went on under hypaethral
It was less easy to accept in all cir-
cumstances the convention of dumb-
show. An uproarious banquet of
brigands, where there was no buzz of
conversation and no audible jests to
provoke the ribald laughter, was a
tough thing to swallow. Apart from
the reading of the service the only re-
marks uttered during the evening were
“Oh !” and “Witch ' " It would seem
that there is no recognised gesture to
express your feelings with perfect clarity
when you imagine yourself to be a
victim of the Black Art.
But, to do justice to a remarkable per-
formance, there was never any resort to
those traditional pantomimics which I
always regard with ignorant abhorrence.

The Nun, if they were sometimes need-
lessly iterated in order to give the
music time to catch up, always con-
veyed her meaning with a perfectly
natural and human directness; and the
sense of space which might well have
tempted her away from a right dramatic
restraint never seemed to give her any
trouble.
Many miracles were performed, but
the best marvel of all was the statuesque
beauty of Mme. MARIA CARMI as the
Botticelli Madonna, and the gracious
dignity of her movements when she
came to life. The third protagonist,
The Spielmann (Herr MAx PALLEN-
BERG), I cannot praise with equal
confidence. Why the Devil should
here be represented as a piper I do
not venture to say, though 1 assume
that the association (common in Ger-
with the crying of lost souls had some-
thing to do with it. But it does not
explain why it should have been
necessary for this Mephistopheles
Spielmann (no connection, by the way,
with another M. SPIELMANN, friend
and biographer of . Mr. Punch), to
adopt the grotesque motions of a
dwarf, and wriggle about with his legs
doubled up, or why these gymnastics
should have had any attraction for The
Nun. I should add that his satanic
pipe threw off an astounding variety of
noises, including the strains of a full
brass orchestra. . . . . . . . .
And this brings me to M. HUMPER-
DINCK's music. The largeness of the
cosmic theme was perhaps hardly suited
to his particular type of genius. One
obvious error of judgment was his
adaptation of a certain familiar hymn-
tune: Writing for an English audience
hé should have considered whether the
homely words which this air was bound
to suggest to us were appropriate for a
congregation thrilled by the spectacle
of the Madonna incarnate. . . . . . . .
*To speak of the pageant as a whole,
Professor REINHARDt's achievement
was a great triumph over difficulties
that must have broken the heart of a
less courageous impresario. His dis-
position of single figures, designed for
the broad effects that so vast a stage
demanded, was a thing to wonder at no
less than his marshalling of the huge
crowds. The cathedral scenes, where
silence was natural and proper, were
far the most appealing. As for the rest,
those who have made a previous study
of the argument will look in vain for
any very lurid episodes in the downward ||
career of The Nun. Her dancing on the
banquet-table was of the most perfunc-
tory, and must have been a sad blow for
the retainers of the marauding noble-
man. Even in the early stages of her
passionate progress she never gave me
the impression that she was having the
time of her life. I am certain that there
should have been, at the first, a stronger
note of joyousness in the new life of love
and freedom, to serve as a contrast
both to the cloistral restraint that went
before, and the bitter disillusionment
that was to follow. But the horrors
began from the very start. Her earthly
Paradise seemed all snake. O. S.

THE ADVANCE OF THE FOOT-

[“Last year, as indeed is proper for a Coro-
nation Year, was not one of violent events in
the Londoner's life.”—Provincial Paper.]
AND shall the fury pass unnoticed
That fledged the feet of democrats,
From Highgate's citadel remotest
To Kennington, the bourne of bats—
The wonder of last year, the wave
of spats?
All shyly, like the early primrose,
They started few and far between;
To-day the shops are full of trim rows,
The suburbs glory in the sheen
Of gaitered ankles; I have some-
times seen
A tube compartment fairly blossom
With buff and grey and brown and
fawn,
And tripped my anxious way across 'em,
And known that every eye was drawn
To my bare boot-tops, void of mush-
Have made their ankles twice as
stout
With ornamental sheaths, the sillies,
And men and maidens walk about
Looking like ptarmigans attacked by
gout.
And I who sing, O cruel fashion,
O charmer with the iron will,
I too have felt the flame, the passion;
I’ve worn them, and I wear them
still:
Look at these twain—I call them
Charles and Bill.
These are my most exotic couple,
There are no lovelier spats than these;
What art it takes to keep them supple
I know not, but they roost at ease
All night upon their own peculiar
trees,
Then say not that the year was quiet,
The poor dim year that lies at rest,
When fancy hock-wear held such riot
And every shoe was chicly dressed
In hoods (but Charles and William
were the best). Evoe.
A NEW CALENDAR.
The reason I have embarked upon
the business here described is this.
Twelve months ago a friend pre-
sented me with a “TENNYson " Calen-
dar for 1911, and, leaving the Insurance
Bill out of the question, few things
have been more thoroughly unsatis-
factory. You know, doubtless, the
kind of thing I mean. One tears off a
sheet each morning, and in addition to
being confronted by the date in large
type, the time of rising and setting of
the sun, and the state of the moon, one
is given a quotation from the works
of the late Laureate. It is the last-
named feature which has goaded me
into action. The diabolical perversity
of my Calendar in this particular has
been almost incredible.
It is not pleasant, for example, on
one of those mornings which some of
us know so well, when the mirror
points out with brutal emphasis that
you are fast becoming middle-aged, bald
and dyspeptic, to be told, “Lo! ever
thus thou growest beautiful.” It is
sarcasm in the worst possible taste.
How disheartening, too, to read on one's

ary human distress cannot fail to re-
act adversely upon the efficiency of the
nation. It must be abolished. The
only way is to revolutionise the system
of compiling Poetical Calendars, and
this is what I claim to have done.
Orders may be sent now. Write
plainly and state your occupation or
principal pursuit. The price will
naturally be a little higher than you
have been accustomed to pay, since
you are getting a better line of goods.
Let me describe my method to you.
In the first place I soon discovered
that the danger lies in what may be
termed Commonplace Days, days which
are not of general interest. On Saints'
Days, Festivals, Anniversaries, All
Fools' Day, and so on, the present
type of Calendar usually manages to
rise, though often in a very inadequate
way, to the occasion. Even the idiot
who produced my 1911 Calendar was
capable of admonishing wild bells to
ring on December 31st.
The problem I had to face with these
Commonplace Days was to find quota-
tions which under no conceivable cir-
cumstances could give offence to the
reader. Nay more, my ambition was
to set before him lines of a stimulating
and inspiring nature. After long
cogitation I decided upon two steps.
I discarded the absurd tradition of
seleeting excerpts from a single poet
and drew freely from all the best
writers, and I adopted a new scheme
of classification. Instead of the
“KEATs Calendar,” the “BURNs Cal-
endar,” the “SHAkspeaRE Calendar,”
etc.; I shall issue the “Dukes' Calen-
dar,” the “Cabmen's Calendar,” the
“Golfers' Calendar,” and so on. You
see the idea 2
nus, if you are a Militant Suffra-
gette, you will find examples of this
character:- -
! . “To him, brave lass'
scratch out his eyes, and on his blanchéd cheeks
Set the fierce print of thy ensanguin'd nails."
- Shakspeare.
“Then angry cries arose from all,
‘Cast out the woman from the hall !'
But though the henchmen toiled apace
They could not drag her from the place;
Full loud the chains which bound her creaked,
And louder yet the woman shrieked.”—Scott.
“I recall
The swift assault, the scramble and the screams,
And all the avalanche of hurtling stones."
Tennyson.
“O for the depths of some cool-shadowed cell!"
Acetts.
- “A harde stoon she cast
Upon a wyndow thikke, and in prisoun
She roamith to and fro and up and doun."
Chaucer.
Or you may be a Butcher. Very
well, then—
“The marvel and magic of mutton,
The lure and the lustre of lamb."
“Where have You BEEN, MY DEAIt l CALLED Yout some time. Ago."
“I was costiNg, MUMMY, only I MET A wor:M '"
“What's i' the sausage 2
Man in his sanguine youth nor in his cross age
Cannot discover. Yet we know it pleasant.”
, , , , Browning.
“Then, butcher, take thy chopper up,
And cleave the joint in twain.”
- Cowper.
“Puir, silly, unsuspecting beastie,
The heart that thrabs within thy breastie
Shall sune be taken fra' thy chestie,
And thrab nae mair.”
Jºurns.
“He drives like Jehu in his chariot fleet,
Urges his horse and speeds along the street.”
Pope.
I leave these few examples to speak
for themselves. They are more eloquent
than I.
If the public supports me, as I
anticipate, I hope next year to go a
step further and produce the “Private
Calendar.” In addition to the features
already described, this will contain suit-
able quotations for any dates of per-
cares to supply me. On the com-
pletion of another year of service at the
office, for instance, he might read:—
“I count it as no common day
The which, if Fortune wills it, may
Procure for service true and sage
A modest increment of wage."
Wordsmrorth.
On the day when he pays his Life
Insurance Premium :—
“O separation which is deplorable and most
unpleasant—the separation from money !.
The paying out of cash from a purse not too
well lined. Damnable nuisance
Allons, all is for the best.”— JP'alt JJThitman.
On the anniversary of his wedding:—
“This is my marriage day.”—Ben Jonson.
You are probably amazed at the
extraordinary aptness and propriety of
my quotations, and are wondering how
I have contrived to bring the work of
selection to such a fine art. That,
however, is my secret, which you can

TO THE NEXT TVELVE MONTHS.
Good Year, you have indeed your work cut out !
I cannot (at the moment) call to mind
A programme more exhausting; nay, I doubt
If any previous brace of years combined
Have had their sense of duty
Confronted by a task so strangely fruity.
There is the coal strike. As I understand,
Our miners claim an equal minim wage
Both for the honest and the idle hand,
And, by the bonds of brotherhood, engage
To starve their fellow-toilers
By cutting off the wherewithal of boilers.
Our cellars will be bare, our railways cease,
No gas will issue when we turn the tap.
The Teutons, when they note, in time of peace,
Our Dreadnoughts made equivalent to scrap,
Will come, with none to fight 'em,
And spoil our golf-links. That is one small item.
... Should we survive it, there are plenty more:
There is the Act of Union to be broke;
There's Ulster pleading for a taste of gore,
And Taffy's finger in his Church's poke;
And Manhood Suffrage showing
His hydra-head. These ought to keep you going.
"And there's the Women's Vote: on rival planks
*Tub-thumping Ministers will disagree;
And doctors, closing up their learned ranks,
Refuse to operate for housemaid's knee—
‘. .” ... (HLoyd GEORGE's little measure
Alone should occupy your autumn leisure).
In otherlands you'll find the same unrest.

* Down swoops the Christian on his vulture quest;
Or, should Reform be checked by long delays

Two Christian vultures join in this diversion.
The sombre East is out to sack and slay:
"Along the Libyan shore there lies the Turk,
“Butchered to make a Roman holiday,”
"And still Bellona asks for more red work;
Still half the world indulges
In more, and bigger, armamental bulges.
Then there is France, the gay and volatile,
Swapping her Cabinets in middle stream;
And Germany, that watches all the while,
Doping with jingo drugs her restive team;
And every sort of trouble
Waiting to burst inside the Balkan bubble.
Thus, if you've followed my remarks, you'll know
The gods would have you play a heavy part.
But take your time: don't you be pressed: go slow,
With smiling face to hide a serious heart;
Good! pull yourself together,
And you'll get through with luck—and decent weather.

Et-cetera, et-cetera—the early version is too long for quota-
MY IDEAL “UEBER-THEATER.”
I HAVE rather advanced views about the Stage. I
hold, with Mr. Gordon CRAIG, that the old “realistic"
ideals of production have quite broken up, and that “the
suggestion of environment" is all that is really necessary.
Also that all our dramatists “must go,” since “the written
play has no lasting value for the art of the theatre”; and all
our actors and actresses, because “the actor must always
bring a certain amount of his personal emotion to ‘spoil '
true art.” I am perfectly prepared to scrap both authors
and actors. I believe the Drama would get on a lot better
without them.
But I go a great deal farther than Mr. GoRDON CRAIG.
If I rightly understand him, his proposal is to replace living
actors by inanimate figures—“Ueber-Marionettes,” he calls
them—which are to perform on a stage set with simple but
artistically lighted scenery. I don't gather whether they
are to say or do anything in particular, but that, I presume,
would depend on the chance inspiration of the artists who
work the wires up in the flies, or the person who will act
as mouthpiece on the prompt side, and speak in at least
two distinct voices. Obviously there can be no written plot
and dialogue, or we shall have these pestilent playwright
fellows coming in again—which would never do.
Now my feeling is that, in the true interests of the Stage,
even sterner simpler methods are required. After all, are
not any artificial aids an insult to the intelligence of a
highly cultivated Super-audience? - º,
Why have Marionettes ? Why have any scenery, lighting,
or stage? Why not leave everything to the unassisted
imaginations of the audience? In the “Ueber-Theater." I
have in my mind every spectator will be left absolutely free
to evolve his or her own characters, surroundings, plot,
dialogue and incidents, in rapt and reverent silence. *
I shall need no stage—nothing but an enlarged cine-
matograph screen, and a second-hand magic-lantern capable
of projecting a sentence or two upon it from time to time.
I shall not require an orchestra, or even a piano. As soon
as the audience are all seated I should switch off the lights
in front, and begin by throwing on the screen the simple
words: “Title of the Play.” -
... This each playgoer would be given a minute to invent for
himself—and it will be strange indeed if everyone of them
does not hit upon something far happier than would ever
occur to the jaded and mechanical professional dramatists
of the present day.
I should then exhibit, “Act I. Scene 222 " allowing the
audience two minutes to visualise any environment they
may individually prefer. It might be anything—“A
Luxuriously Furnished Interior,” “A Romantic Glade by
Moonlight,” or “The Summit of a Himalayan Peak.” The
spectator could imagine a stage set to his or her liking,
and the result would necessarily surpass all the efforts of
the most realistic or idealistic producer.
When the two minutes were up I should bring on my
Dramatis Personae. A line or two on the screen would do it:
“A (a superlatively lorely troman) meets B (a magnificently
handsome man) . . .” Here I should give the spectators
one minute, in which each could picture his or her ideal
type. After which I should go on, “They instantly fall in
love and express their mutual passion.” (Fire minutes for
this, during which the audience would sit and imagine the
conversation, which would, of course, be characterised by a
fervour and brilliancy beyond the power of any of our puny
contemporary playwrights.) When they had finished
that I should proceed : “Enter C (a man of singular
fascination, but saturnine temperament)"—(half a minute

“You're very thoughtful,” said Miss
Middleton. “What's the matter 2"
“I am extremely unhappy,” I con-
fessed.
“Oh, but think of FostER and
HoBBs and HEARNE.”
I thought of FostER; I let my mind
dwell upon Hobbs. It was no good.
“I am still rather sad,” I said.
“Why? Doesn't anybody love you?”
“Millions adore me fiercely. It
isn't that at all. The fact is I've
just had a birthday.”
“Oh, I am sorry. Many happy—”
“Thank you.”
“I thought it was to-morrow,” Miss
Middleton went on eagerly. “And I'd
bought a cricketing set for you, but I
had to send it back to have the bails
sawn in two. Or would you rather
have had a bicycle?”
“I'd rather have had nothing. I
want to forget about my birthday alto-
gether.”
“Oh, are you as old as that 2"
“Yes,” I said sadly, “I am as old as
that. I have passed another landmark.
I'm what they call getting on.”
We gazed into the fire in silence for
some minutes.
“If it's any comfort to you,” said
Miss Middleton timidly, “to know that
you don't look any older than you did
last week * ,
“I’m not sure that I feel any older.”
“Then except for birthdays how do
you know you are older?”
I looked at her and saw that I could
trust her.
“May I confess to you?” I asked.
“But of course!” she cried eagerly.
“I love confessions.” She settled herself
comfortably in her chair. “Make it as
horrible as you can,” she begged.
I picked a coal out of the fire with
the tongs and lit my cigarette.
“I know that I'm getting old,” I said,
“I know that my innocent youth is
leaving me, because of the strange and
terrible things which I find myself
doing.”
“Oo-o-o-oh,” said Miss Middleton
happily to herself.
“Last Monday, about three o'clock
in the afternoon, I–– No, I can't tell
you this. It's too awful.”
“Is it very bad?” said Miss Middle-
ton wistfully.
“Very. I don't think you—Oh,

Last Monday I suddenly found myself

Miss Middleton looked at me quickly,
smiled suddenly and then became very
“I appeared,” I went on impressively,
“to be thinking of insuring my life.”
“Have you done it?”
“No, certainly not. I drew back in
time. But it was a warning—it was
the writing on the wall.”
“Tell me some more,” said Miss
Middleton, after she had allowed this
to sink in.
“Well, that was Monday afternoon.
I told myself that in the afternoon one
wasn't quiteresponsible, that sometimes
one was only half awake. But on Tues-

“That's the worst. But there have

“Can I go into the kitchen and

Miss Middleton sighed mournfully.

A record of personal experience
which blends with amazing force the

It is not often that Long Jane goes

In Miss Lyrer's book will be found
verse which surpasses in passion
(which is of course the only thing that
anyone wants in verse) the kindred
poetry of Miss Ella Wheeler Wilcox,
who cannot but be pleased with this

of such poems to-day displays a more
complete mastery of form, such glowing
colours, and such meteoric flashes of
the Orient. And perhaps not. It is
left for readers of Miss Lyrer to decide.

“THE MAN IN THE STALLS.”
(An Appreciation.)
THE row was front, the place was Pit,
And in the centre seat of it
It was my privilege to sit.
And, sitting there, I sat behind
A Stallite of the larger kind,
Who, having previously dined,
Arrived some twenty minutes late,
For reasons which he did not wait
A more convenient time to state.
He did not drop into his seat
At once, but stood upon his feet
And looked about for friends to greet.
And, when he settled down at last,
I caught the judgment which he passed
On every member of the cast,
And overheard his loud regret
That time had not arrived, as yet,
To go and smoke a cigarette.
When he could stand thestrain no more,
He made his preparations for
Departing by an early door.
Then, daring much but much afraid,
I tapped his restless shoulder-blade.
This is the little speech I made:–
“To you, whom theatres clearly pall,
The Pit is much obliged, O Stall,
|But, though to us it will be quite
“There is about your splendid back,
That now familiar stretch of black,
A movement which the others lack.
“Your comings in, your goings out
Were things to watch and think about,
Which we could ill have done without.
--------- -
“Your fluent talk, your frequent jest,
Your inner thoughts, so wellexpressed,
Have been of endless interest.
“We shall return to-morrow night;
A dismal thing to miss the sight
“And sound of you, we shan't complain,
So do not give yourself the pain
Of worrying to come again.
“For, please, to-morrow, if we may,
We'd like to see and hear the play.”
Discouraging Efficiency.
“A batch of Territorials were fined this after-
noon at Greenwich Police-court for failing to
attend camp and making themselves efficient.”

on this old hat (pins it on) and there I am. Come on.

He. We must take the two Great Danes.

She. It's no weather for a Pekinese. Still, I'd better have

He. Let's go and leave him. He never follows, anyhow.
She. Leave my little Chang? Never. Chang! Chang!!

He. Let him go. We're going that way.
She. Yes, and we shall have to go his way all the time.
Trot along and get the big ones. (He goes, and shortly
returns with two Great Danes, who prance up to Her and

She. Chang! Chang!! Chang!!!
He. There's the little fiend a hundred yards ahead.
Upon my word, you 've trained that dog well. You've
only got to call him and away he goes across country
a thousand miles an hour.
She. There's a motor. Rush for Chang. (He rushes :
so does Chang. The two Danes think it's a game and
prance after him. He pounces cºn Chang just as the motor-

Elmores' carriage. (The carriage passes, while He, stuffing
smile of recognition.) Oh, if you could only have seen how
funny you looked with all that mud. I wonder what the
Elmores thought.
He. Who cares what the Elmores think?
She. You're generally so particular about Maude Elmore,
dear. Never mind; I'll write and explain it was only mud.
He. You're quite capable of it; but—
She. There's a retriever coming, and you've let Chang

I LIKE the blooms that decked your wedding cake,
Now sheltered under glass secure from harm ;
I like the curtains, blue and crimson-lake;
The rubber-plant is not without its charm;
I recognise the worth as ornaments
Of song-birds nicely stuffed and dormice sleek;
The goldfish in his bowl my eye contents;
I count him cheap at two-pounds-ten a week.
I like “The Soul's Awakening” on the wall;
I catch the humour of the china pugs;
The chandelier offends me not at all,
Nor brackets made of plush nor fleecy rugs:
I merely raise my voice, a gentle one,
To hint that I from shelf and mantelpiece
Could spare perhaps the portraits of your son,
Your husband, sister, uncle, aunt, and niece.
For when, from out your not too easy chair,
I view these scions of a fruitful tree,
Who, all in Sunday raiment, smirk or glare,
A sense of vague discomfort troubles me:
Bidding me sigh, “O company unknown
Of men and maids and inſants not a few,
Pity a lodger living all alone,
And lonelier still, not being one of you!”

I HAD striven for years to write plays:
“Dum spiro,” my motto was, “spero; "
I had seen myself lifting the bays
From the glowering brows of PINElto;
The Managers read “with delight”
My work—or pretended to do so —
And at last one engaged me to write
The libretto for Robinson Crusoe.
With all innocent fun 'twas equipped
(Not a speech had so much as a “damn" in),
And they duly submitted my script
For the Censor of Plays to examine;
When I learned, after several days,
That my views on decorum and his met,
But he wished me to alter one phrase—
Then I folded my arms and said, “Kismet.”
As a subject of GEORGIU's REX,
Imperator, Fidei Defensor,
I should deem it disloyal to vex
His servant, the Chamberlain's Censor;
I was moody and sad, but resigned;
Dejected, but not with contrition,
Till a brain-wave revealed to my mind–
Then why should my spirits go down 2
How oft, in the years when I lay low,
Had I yearned to illumine my crown
With the genius-martyr's own halo;
I could enter the Temple of Fame,
And REDFord had shown me the doorway!
I was one with the Johnnies who claim
To be greater than HENRIK (of Norway) '
I have idolised BARKER and SHAw,
But no longer I think them above me;
Yes, I look not on GRAN VILLE with awe;
I am certain that BERNARD would love me !
So of HousMAN's unorthodox play
I have thought with a jealous abhorrence,
But if I were to meet him to-day
I should lightly address him as LAURENCE.
O REDFord, dear excellent man'
Your pencil has changed my life's story,
For the bards who come under its ban -
Reflect its caerulean glory !
Ungrateful and garrulous tribe -
Who yelp at its chastening slashes!
Be sure, Sir, one disciplined scribe



To be censored compels recognition.
Will mourn your retirement in ashes.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE always liked the characters of Mr. Thomas CoBB.
They are all such thoroughly nice people, who not in-
frequently reside in West Kensington, and are seldom
guilty of an act or an emotion such as would bring dis-
credit upon even that neighbourhood. Enter Bridget
(MILLS AND Boon) shows them worthily maintaining the
traditions of their race. I must confess that for about half
the book I thought that their, very proper aversion from
sensationalism was going to be carried to the extreme length
of giving us no story at all. Then however Carrissima,
who liked Mark Driver, came to call on Bridget, and
found Mank kissing her. She pretended not to have noticed
anything, and went home and was quite miserable about
it, in a ladylike Kensingtonian way. Mishandled, the
thing might have led to broken hearts and all sorts of
and valuable prints; and the stories, if mostly old, are
agreeably put together. Amongst those which he publishes,
as far as I know, for the first time, is one about the present
|Headmaster and the remarks which he addressed to the
Sixth Form, soon after his appointment, to allay their fears
as to the changes which he might introduce as the result
of his advanced views on hygiene and the gospel of Jaeger
underclothing. According to a variant, which I offer for
what it is worth, what Canon Lyttelton actually told
them was that he had no intention of making them wear
| Plasmon next their skin.
I suppose I must have an old-fashioned prejudice in
favour of beginning a story before the principal lady gets
married, and that in spite of such charming novels as Miss
ANNE SEDGwick's Valerie Upton. At any rate, in the case
of The Doll (STANLEY PAUL), which is the title of Miss
WIOLET HUNT's latest novel, I found myself getting less
bothers. But one of - — and less interested in

Mr. RALPH NEVILL's Floreat Etona (MACMILLAN), con-
ventionally bound in cloth of the colour proper to its
subject, is more lively than most blue books, and, I may
add, than most of the books about Eton on which it is
founded. I even find it more entertaining than the one
I wrote myself. He begins—like the rest of us whose
immortal works have been collected by Mr. “LULU ’’
HARcourt—with HENRY WI. and WILLIAM of WAYNFLETE
(and WINCHESTER) and the Maidenhead migration, and the
other heroes and heroic events of the early days. He sings
—as we all have done—of the horrors of Long Chamber,
of Pop and Tap, and Montem and Absence, and Furking
and Shirking, and Sense and Nonsense; of KEATs and his
birch, of Porso N and SHELLEY and J. K. S.; of the IRON
DUKE and the Playing Fields, and many other themes that
recall the warmed-up cabbage of the JUVENAL crib. But,
besides the anecdotes of which it is chiefly composed, the
falls in love with Isabel Agate, her grown-up daughter by
her first marriage. A large part of the book is devoted to
the wife's contention that in case of divorce the woman,
even if convicted of misconduct, should have custody of
her children. Mrs. Hawtayne herself happened to be
innocent, but that, as I understand her, does not affect
the plea. It is perhaps a sign of merit in a novel that the
reader should sympathise with the characters' emotions,
and certainly neither husband nor wife can have been
more wearied by their continual bickerings than I was.
For the rest, I can only say that the theme of The Doll
is well abreast of the times.

STORIES OF SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
[This series is designed to assist parents in

devoted considerable time to research among the
best authorities, and the results are now laid
before the public in the hope that they will bring

I.—THE SoLicitor's.
THE office was at its busiest, for it
was Friday afternoon. John Blunt
leant back in his comfortable chair and
toyed with the key of the safe, while
he tried to realise his new position.
He, John Blunt, was junior partner in
the great London firm of Macnaughton,
Macnaughton, Macnaughton, Mac-
naughton & Macnaughton |
He closed his eyes, and his thoughts
wandered back to the day when he had
first entered the doors of the firm as
one of two hundred and seventy-eight
applicants for the post of office-boy.
They had been interviewed in batches,
and old - Mr. Sanderson, the senior
partner, had taken the first batch.
“I like your face, my boy,” he had
said heartily to John. -
“And I like yours,” replied John,
not to be outdone in politeness.
“Now I wonder if you can spell
| mortgage’?”
“I think so,” John had replied, “but
| I am not sure.”
Mr. Sanderson was delighted with the
lad's caution, and engaged him at once.
For three years John had done his
- During this time he
had silved the firm more than once
by his readiness—particularly on one
occasion, when he had called old Mr.
Sanderson's attention to the fact that
he had signed a letter to a firm of
sºckbrokers, “Your loving husband
Macnaughton, Mac-
naughton, Macnaughton & Macnaugh-
ton.” Mr. Sanderson, always a little
absent-minded, corrected the error, and
promised the boy his articles. Five
years later John Blunt was a solicitor.
And now he was actually junior
partner in the firm—the firm of which
it was said in the City, “If a man
has Macnaughton, Macnaughton, Mac-
naughton, Macnaughton & Macnaughton
behind him he is all right.” The City is
always coining pithy little epigrams like
this. - - * ~ *
There was a knock at the door of the
enquiry office and a prosperous-looking
gentleman came in.
“Can I see Mr. Macnaughton 2" he
said politely to the office boy.
“There isn't no Mr. Macnaughton,”
replied the latter. “They all died
years ago.”
“Well, well, can I see one of the
partners?"
because he's havinghis lunch," said
the boy. “Mr. Thorpe hasn't come back
from lunch yet, Mr. Peters has just
gone out to lunch, Mr. Williams is
expected back from lunch every
minute, Mr. Gourlay went out to lunch
an hour ago, Mr. Beamish—"
“Tut, tut, isn't anybody in 2"
“Mr. Blunt is in,” said the boy, and
took up the telephone. “If you wait
a moment I'll see if he 's awake.”
Half an hour later Mr. Masters was
shown into John Blunt's room.
“I’m sorry I was engaged,” said
John. “A most important client. Now
what can I do for you, Mr. —er—
Masters ?”
“I wish to make my will.”
“By all means,” said John cordially.
“I have only one child, to whom I
intend to leave all my money.”
“Ha! ” said John, with a frown.
“This will be a lengthy and difficult
business.” -
“But you can do it?” asked Mr.
Masters anxiously. “They told me at
the hairdresser's that Macnaughton,
Macnaughton, Macnaughton, Mac-
naughton & Macnaughton was the
cleverest firm in London.” º
“We can do it,” said John simply:
“but it will require all our care, and I
think it would be best if I were to come
and stay with you for the week-end.
We could go into it properly then.”
“Thank you,” said Mr. Masters,
clasping the other's hand. “I was just
going to suggest it. My motor car is
outside. Let us go at once.” º
“I will follow you in a moment,”
said John, and pausing only to snatch a
handful of money from the safe for
incidental expenses and to tell the boy
that he would be back on Monday he
picked up the well-filled week-end bag
which he always kept ready, and
hurried after the other. -
Inside the car
confidential. -
“My daughter,” he said, “comes
of age to-morrow.”
“Oh, it's a daughter?” said John in
surprise. “Is she pretty 2"
“She is considered to be the
girl in the county.” -
“Really?" said John. He thought
a moment, and added, “Can we stop
at a post-office? I must send an im-
portant business telegram." He took
out a form and wrote “Macmacmac-
macmac, London. Shall not be back
till Wednesday.—BLUNT.”
The car stopped and then sped on
again.
“Amy has never been any trouble to
me," said Mr. Masters, “but I am
getting old now, and I would give a
thousand pounds to see her happily
Mr. Masters was
prettiest
“To whom would you give it?" asked |
John, whipping out his pocket-book.
“Tut, tut, a mere figure of speech.
But I would settle a hundred thousand
pounds on her on the wedding day.”
“Indeed?" said John thoughtfully.
“Can we stop at another post-office 2"
he added, bringing out his fountain pen
again. He took out a second telegraph
form and wrote : “ Macmacmacmac-
mac, London. Shall not be back till
Friday.—BLUNt.”
The car dashed on again, and an
hour later arrived at a commodious
mansion standing in its own well-
timbered grounds of upwards of several
acres. At the front-door a graceful
figure was standing. -
“My solicitor, dear, Mr. Blunt,”
said Mr. Masters. -
“It is very good of you to come all
this way on my father's business,” she
said shyly. -
“Not at all,” said John. “A week
or—or a fortnight—or—” he looked at
her again—“ or—three weeks, and the
thing is done.”
“Is making a will so very difficult 2."
“It's a very tricky and complicated
affair indeed. However, I think we
shall pull it off. Er—might I send an
important business telegräm 2"
“Macmacmacmacmac, London,”
wrote John. “Wery knotty case. Date
of return uncertain. Please send more
cash for incidental expenses.—BLUNT.”
Yes, you have guessed what happened.
It is an every-day experience in a
solicitor's life. John Blunt and Amy
Masters were married at St. George's,
Hanover Square, last May. The
wedding was a quiet one owing to
mourning in the bride's family—the
result of a too sudden perusal of Mac-
naughton, Macnaughton, Macnaughton,
Macnaughton & Macnaughton's bill
of costs. As Mr. Masters said with
his expiring breath — he didn't mind
paying for our Mr. Blunt's skill; nor
yet for our Mr. Blunt's valuable time
—even if most of it was spent in
courting Amy; nor, again, for our Mr.
Blunt's tips to the servants; but he did
object to being charged the first-class
railway fare both ways when our Mr.
Blunt had come down and gone up
again in the car. And perhaps I ought
to add that that is the drawback to
this fine profession. One is so often
misunderstood. A. A. M.

[“On the ground that it would “altogether
upset the routine of , business,’ and would
‘greatly interfere with the comfort and conveni-
ence of visitors,’ Sheringham District Council,
Norfolk, has declined a proposed visit, in August,
by 10,000 Territorials, with several thousand
horses and 70 guns, for a training camp.
The Finance Committee instructed the clerk
to ask two landowners not to afford the au.

To the General Commanding Army of
Invasion, Aug. 1, 1913.
SIR,-On behalf of the Sheringham
District Council I must make a formal
protest against the highly irregular and
illegal conduct of certain persons under
your command. The Council is credibly
informed that at 7 A.M. this morning
several thousand troops were disem-
barked on the portion of the shore
especially reserved for lady bathers—
a distinct violation of By-law No. 153.
The Council desires me to warn you
that all these persons are liable to a
penalty of 40s. and costs. In the second
place all the donkeys on the sands have
been illegally secured by one of your
officers, thus depriving the watering-
place of one of its chief attractions. In
the third place a missile (discharged in
direct violation of By-law 63 prohibiting
the use of air-guns, catapults and other
dangerous weapons within the area of
the Council's authority) has wrecked
the band-stand, causing damage which
can only be covered by a halfpenny
rate. Finally, the unexpected arrival
'of so many strangers—without the
to the Council—has created quite a
panic amongst the regular visitors.
The Council is of opinion that a con-
tinuation of this conduct will ruin the
summer season and greatly interfere
with the routine of business. The
Council therefore requests you to with-
draw your troops at once and re-land
them either at Lowestoft or Yarmouth.
At these places, which are the resort of
the vulgar excursionist class, the arrival
of foreign troops is less likely to cause
painful annoyance.
On behalf of the District Council,
J. S.Nooks, Clerk.
To the General Commanding Army of
Invasion, Aug. 2, 1913.
SIR,-The Council instructs me to say
that it is in receipt of your letter of to-
day and that it notes with deep regret
your threat to flog the members of the
Council (in distinct violation of By-law
No. 81 prohibiting all violence in public
places). The Council is of opinion
that this threat is not only unkind
but altogether uncalled for. The posi-
tion of the District Council has been
absolutely consistent on this subject.
In the interests of business and the
visitors it has always objected to the
arrival of English or foreign troops at
Sheringham as being a drawback to
trade, demoralising to maid-servants
and disturbing to visitors. We must
also point out that the amenities of

Half-a-dozen years

And now LABBY
has gone the way of

of other men who
for a while filled
large spaces in the
House of Commons.
And still the House
will unconcernedly
go its old familiar
way. The SPEAKER
will take the Chair at
the appointed hour;
the Orders of the Day
will be called on ; the
Division Lobbies will
fill and empty, and
at the close of the
day there will echo
through the House
the old cry, “Who

On a lower plane, but after the same
fashion, was the effect of LABBY's
withdrawal from the familiar scene.
Through a succession of Parliaments
his had been a prominent and popular
figure, few members more constant in
attendance. He loved the House of
Commons, and was never so happy as
when taking part in its inner or outer
life. His preference was, perhaps, for
the former condition. He was even
happier in his chair in the Smoking
Room, surrounded by a delighted
audience, than he was in his corner
seat below the Gangway, impartially
chaffing Ministers or right hon. gentle-
men on the Front Bench or on the other
side of the Table. He was at his
worst when delivering a sedulously
prepared speech in exposition of not
temperament LABBY was absolutely
free. He was animated solely by desire
to be behind the scenes of everything
that was going on—an impulse perhaps
born of tendency to sheer mischief.
A cynic in speech, he was at heart one
of the kindest, most genial men in the
world, preserving to the last his per-
sonal popularity with both sides and
all sections of Party in the House of
Commons.
A born strategist, master of the forms
of debate, he did substantial service to
the Liberal Party in Opposition in the
Parliament elected in 1886. When,
largely owing to his unremitting efforts,
the Unionist majority was whittled
away, the General Election of 1892
finally disposing of it, he had good rea-

PUNCH, OR
[JANUARY 24, 1912.
THE ALIEN LAUREL.
I.
(Ertract from the literary columns of “The Universe.”).
IN The Pan-English Review there are several contributions
of exceptional merit, but we venture to doubt if the editor
was well advised in printing “The Lure of Her Lips,”
a poem by Mr. Williamson Jelſe. It contains some power-
ful lines, but the subject is, to put it plainly, repulsive, and
Mr. Jelfe's treatment does not make it less so. We think
Mr. Jelfe would do better to confine himself to the geological
studies with which his name has hitherto been honourably
connected.
II.
(Ert, act from an article on “The Monthlies " in
“The Cross. Bow.") .
The poetry this month is not of a very high standard,
but from this judgment we must except “The Lure of Her
Lips,” by Mr. Williamson Jelſe, in The Pan-English
Review. This is undoubtedly the most remarkable poem
that has appeared for many a long year. It vibrates with
passion, and the writer's power of expression is adequate
to the strange beauty of his subject. We do not say that
it will please the nincompoops who direct English literary
judgment. It is not addressed to the jeune fille. But for
sheer splendid virility it would be difficult to match it in
the poetry of this or any age.
- III.
(From Mr. Williamson Jolfe to the Editor of “The Pan-
English Review.")
Sir, Words would not be equal to describing my
astonishment at finding in your issue of this month that
I am credited with the authorship of a poem entitled
“The Lure of Her Lips.” I can only say that I consider
it a most dreadful poem, and I cannot make out its metre.
If I understand the intention of the author it is to glorify
the most terrible things. I have never read anything worse
anywhere. What I want to say is that I did not write it.
I could never dream of doing such a thing, and I must
therefore ask you to insert an immediate apology in The
Times and all the other papers. It is true that I did
submit to you for insertion an article entitled “Palaeonto-
logical Aspects of a Neglected District,” but that is no
excuse for attributing such a poem to me. Kindly let me
hear from you at once.
- IV.
(The Editor of “The Pan-English lieciew" to Mr.
|Williamson Jelſe.)
SIR,--I own that your letter has surprised me. You
deny the authorship of “The Lure of Her Lips,” but you
will see that the MS. (which I enclose) bears your name—
though the address is different. You will remember that I
informed you that your contribution was only just in time
for insertion in this issue. I regret that in the hurry of the
moment no proof was sent to you. The Poem has, I may
tell you, created a great sensation and has materially
increased the sale of the Review. I enclose a cutting from
The Cross-Bow, which will show you how favourably it
is being noticed by those who are most competent to judge.
It gives me great pleasure to enclose for your acceptance a
cheque for £20 in payment for the poem. Kindly acknow-
ledge receipt on the accompanying form.
V.
(From Mr. Williamson Jelſe to the Editor of “The Pan-
English Review.”
SIR,--I am much obliged for your letter and cheque,
will perhaps be better for me to say nothing more about
this unfortunate business—though some of my friends may
find it hard to understand how I can reconcile the writing
of such a poem with the secretaryship of the Palaeonto-
logical Association. However, they must think what they
like. Do you propose to publish my article on “The Palae.
ontological Aspects of a Neglected District” 2
WI.
(From Miss Harrison Bale to her nephew, Williamson Jelſe.)
MY DEAR NEPHEw,-A little bird has whispered to me
that you have added the laurels of a poet to your other
distinctions, and I am dying to see the poem which has
brought you such fame. Hele in Wintervale we see no
magazines, but I have sent to my bookseller and have
ordered a copy of The Pan-English Review—what a strange
name for a paper It has always been my ambition that
my favourite nephew should shine as an author, for in these
days old-fashioned morality requires the defence of every-
body who has a heart and a conscience.
Your advice about my last investments has been wonder-
fully sound—and yet they say that poets cannot be business
men Your affectionate aunt, HARRISON.
VII.
(From Mr. Williamson Solfe to the Editor of “The Pan-
English Review.”)
SIR,--I see you have published my poem, “The Lure of
Her Lips.” Kindly send payment for it to the above
address, and be good enough to note that my name is
“Solfe,” not “Jelſe,” as you print it—a very annoying error.
A word to that effect in your next issue will oblige. I can-
not understand why no proof was sent to me. -
Yours faithfully, WILLIAMson Solfe.
(This correspondence is still continuing, but we can print
no more.)

TWO THAT PARTED.
I KNow not when the severance began,
Now plain, alas! for every eye to see,
And, though full many friends conferred, no man
Could place before the twain a remedy.
Themselves could never state the actual cause,
And neither owned an unforgiving heart,
Nor ever sinned against good-feeling's laws,
Yet day by day Time saw them draw apart;
Time that from infancy had watched their rise
Through blameless early years passed each by each;
Even I, close knit to them by natural ties,
Strove unavailingly to mend the breach.
And still our best endeavours prove in vain
To bring together that divided pair;
And now I know they will not meet again—
Those two sides of the parting in my hair.

THE LATEST EPIDEMIC.
GREAT and widespread unrest has
been caused by the devastating declar-
ation of Mr. HAMMERSTEIN to the
representatives of the Press, that, un-
less his Opera House met with more
effective support from the British public,
it would probably be impossible for him
and his daughter to continue their resi-
dence in London. Thescene on the Stock
Exchange on Wednesday baffled de-
scription; several stock-brokers were
seized with cerebral conjunctivitis and
Consols fell to 68. The Rubber Market
quivered like a jelly, and Hoffmann
Prefs. dropped to a fraction below
Zero.
Even more formidable, however, than
these seismic perturbations in the world
of finance has been the contagious in-
fluence of Mr. HAMMERSTEIN's example
in other quarters.
Consternation is still raging in Print-
ing House Square owing to the receipt
of an ultimatum from Sir HENRY Ho-
worth. In this remarkable document,
closely written script, the veteran his-
torian of the Mongols states that, unless
the Editor of The Times will pledge him-
selfin future to printhis communications
in large type and without excisions, he
will emigrate to Mongolia and stay
there indefinitely. According to latest
advices Mr. BUCKLE, who has summoned
Sir GEORGE AskwitH and Sir FRANCIS
Hopwood, is bearing up heroically and
taking mourishment, though naturally
much distressed by an announcement
which may seriously complicate our
relations with Russia and China.
A marconigram from New York,
delayed in transmission by contact with
an irrelevant iceberg, states that Lord
TANKERVILLE has informed the head-
master of the school at Boston where
he proposes to enter his son, that un-
less the game of baseball is played
on Socialist principles he will send
the boy back to Eton. A telegram from
Windsor states that Canon LYTTELTON
remains calm.

in Fleet Street by the rumour that the

pleasant story comes from a Cornish golf-course.
A visitor entered for a bogey competition with
another visitor to mark for him, but when his
card was duly sent in neither secretary nor

therefore cross-examined the player as to what
it meant.”—Glasgow Erening Citizen.
The idea here seems to be that, as it
takes a Scotchman a long time to see
a joke, it is just as well that the point
of it should be postponed for twenty-
four hours, during which interlude he
can be getting ready to laugh.

WHEN a Professor of Spectacular
Drama exploits an English version of a
Greek tragedy (under a Latin title) for
the benefit of the modern side, I must
suppose that some service is done to
the cause of popular education. But
I am pedant enough to doubt whether
such service is not greatly overrated.

Theatre of Dionysus. Any fifth-form
boy can tell you that Attic drama was
an act of religious worship; that the
horrors of a legend like this, that deals
with parricide and incest, had been
softened for the ancients by familiarity,
as happens with us in the case of many
of our Biblical episodes; that a Greek
audience was deeply concerned with
the workings of Destiny, which meant
so much to them and means so little
to us; and that, in respect to the
literary handling of the theme, they
were vastly more intrigued than we of
to-day by the “ironic" method.
Now, nobody imagines that Professor
REINHARDT selected (Edipus for the
sake of the opportunities it affords for a
display either of the workings of Destiny
or the ironic method of presenting them.
These features he might have found in
a dozen other Greek tragedies far less
harrowing and offensive to the modern
mind. Nor can it have been the life-
story of GEdipus that was the attrac-
tion, for his adventures are all over
| before the play begins, and most of his
| time on the stage is taken up with
retrospective enquiry touching the
possibility of his being his own step-
father. No, I must believe that, with
a single eye to his own peculiar art,
the Professor selected (Edipus for the
| sake of its final horrors.
And, to do him bare justice, he
rubbed them in. No one who saw it is
likely to forget the repulsive hideous-
ness of the scene where the King
rushes out with bloody eye-sockets,
flings himself against a pillar of the
palace and howls at the top of his
voice. We were spared nothing. No
suggestion was permitted of that
artistic reticence which is of the very
essence of Attic tragedy. If we except
the face and figure of Jocasta (and she
was far too young for a grandmother)
there was scarce a note of pure beauty
to serve for relief. Much might have
been made of the men-at-arms and the
handmaidens, but they were not a
great attraction.

Mr. MARTIN HARVEY (as (Edipus). “IHow's
that, Reinhardt’ ”
The fact is that Professor REINHARDT
has experimented brilliantly with an
Arabian Night and a mediaeval legend,
where the artist, let loose on virgin soil,
could be a law to himself; but here
there are sacred traditions, and, though
he may ignore them, they remain a
standard to judge him by.
In certain details he might well have
kept more closely to precedent without
damaging his scheme. Some of the

dresses were none too Greek; those,
for instance, of the torch-bearers and
female attendants suggested an Oriental
Hareem rather than a Theban Court.
And if there is one gesture more than
another about which we may be certain
that the Greeks would have insisted on
it, it is the gesture, traditionally sym-
bolic of grief, by which Jocasta should
have drawn the folds of her himation
over the back of her head and across
her face. But Miss McCARTHY wore
no himation, and in any case she
would have been fearful of deranging
her barbaric headgear.
And wha', was she doing with that
big vase held at arms' length over her
nice head—an attitude for which I
know no Greek authority ? - And a
steaming vase, too! Did the manage-
ment suppose that they served their
libations hot and hot ? Besides, the
whole proceeding was totally meaning-
less, since there was no visible altar or
tomb to account for it.
I cannot speak as highly as I should
like of the chorus of doddering elders,
though they were well led. Their
jerky entrance to slow music was
ludicrous, and the length of their
hoary beards hardly excused their lack
of intelligent emotion during a series of
most unusual announcements. I think,
too, that they should have been told
to chant their words. The convention
which allows a company of people to
express their views in identically the
same language at the same moment,
as though by collusion, is permissible
in song, but becomes absurd in spoken
speech. And it was unfortunate that
the greater part of the stalls could see
almost nothing of either the chorus or
the populace of the pestilence-stricken
city except their heads and lifted arms.
However, it is not for me to complain,
for at the Dress Rehearsal I sat in the
front row, and so was right in the
thick of things and had every chance
I wanted of catching the plague.
A curious feature of the production—
you find it also in The Miracle—was
its striking mixture of realism and con-
vention. On the one hand we were
invited to imagine the rich colour and
splendour of a Royal Palace by the aid
of an unadorned and purely conventional
façade, painted black, with rectangular
columns and a single copper entrance.
On the other hand our imaginations
were not trusted to develop a multitude
out of a few scattered figures. The
crowd had to be all there before our
eyes; just as in our ears we had to
suffer those devastating screams in all
their horrific realism. No symbols here,
if you please.
But, when once we had recognised
that no attempt was being made at

archaeological accuracy, there was little
offence in any realism so long as it
was not too ugly. I confess I heartily
enjoyed the activities of some of the
supers. Their free and natural move-
ments as they raced up and down the
steps in the panic that followed the
Queen's death were the most engaging
feature of the evening's novelty.
After seeing all three of Professor
REINHARDT's productions in London,
it is clear to me that his art is not so
well suited to spoken drama as to
dumb-show. To those who wish to
give their minds to the text, his search-
lights, especially when, as at Covent
Garden, they are operated in full view
of the audience, are almost as distract-
ing as the elaborate decoration of, say,
His Majesty's, from which he has come
to wean us. Nor could I find that his
illuminations were always in harmony
with the action. Thus the two garish
beams that played steadily on (Edipus
in all the glory of his unsoiled king-
ship still followed and blazed upon
him, with only a change in the angle
of their incidence, as he groped his
way out to the darkness, bodily and
spiritual, of lonely exile.
Admirable artist as he is, Professor
REINHARDT is suffering just now from
a good deal of indiscriminate flattery,
and for much that I have here said
I shall be called Philistine by his
devotees. Yet if MATTHEw ARNOLD,
that robust Philhellene, could have
assisted at this performance and made
an “essay in criticism " upon it, he
too, I doubt not (horrible irony!) would
have received the same opprobrious
epithet in that quarter. So we other
Philistines would have been in good
company.
Mr. MARTIN HARVEY as (Edipus
did some brave work. Physically, he
misses the imposing air desirable in a
first-class monarch, and a pair of stout
cothurni were called in to redress his
deficiency of stature. He indicated
well the slow dawn and reluctant
progress of self-suspicion. He was
justified, too, in these sudden flashes
of temper that recalled his inexcusable
conduct at the cross - roads, which
(under Providence) was the cause of
all the trouble. Perhaps he showed
too indecent a joy at the news of the
death of Polybus, his supposed father.
True, it seemed to rid him of one of the
oracle's haunting threats; but, after
all, in this good old Corinthian he had
lost a very amiable parent.
Miss LILLAH McCARTHY as Jocasta
was a splendid figure, and she played
with a very sincere intensity. A friend
protested to me that her manner was
too “temperamental.” But in a modern

cannot blame her for behaving (I don't

The enunciation of all the actors was
sound, with the notable exception of
Mr. Louis, CALVERT. His Creon from

And I have to complain of the pro-
nunciation of the name Tiresias. The
e in the middle of that word is by nature
one of the shortest I have ever met;
yet, on the appearance of the veteran
seer at the back of the stalls, the leader
of the chorus, as he hailed him, made
it long, and kept it long with a remorse-
less insistence—“Tireeeesias”!
Perhaps the single performance that
came most near to the Greek quality
of restraint was that of Mr. DYALL, as
the Messenger from the Palace. But

to attach too much importance to the
event, as in the pardonable exaltation
betrayed by Mr. HARVEY in his First

THE ROGUES.
ARTISTs in fraud are always with us,
but it is unusual to meet with three
good examples in one week. Yet I
have just done so. I had drifted into
a billiard saloon in the West Central
district, where there are many tables,
including French ones without pockets,
and I noticed two men playing. Their
game was indifferent, but they them-
selves were so difficult to place that I
was interested. Not bookmakers on
the one side, or dealers of any kind on
the other, but a type, distinctly Hebraic,
between. They were carefully dressed,
but very common, and they had both
time and money, for here they were
idling as early as half-past four.
They left before I did, and passing mischievous,
every great artist in Italy used to be,
but actually he was an amusing loafer.
He sat at his little vice, with a file in
his hand, and did nothing but talk.
He passed his fingers through his bushy
iron-grey locks, glanced at the re-
flection of his bright eyes and ruddy
cheeks in the mirror–there was always
a mirror—and talked. His pet illusion
was that he was Byronic. He had a
scorn for revealed religion that he
thought Byronic, although it was really
of the brand of FootB and TAxiſ, ; he
had a contempt for the moral code
which he thought Byronic, although it
was merely the most ordinary self-
indulgence. But By RoN having been
loose in such matters, he was looser
with a greater courage. He had a
sardonic view of the
out soon afterwards into a busy street world which he thought was Byronic,
I found myself looking into one of but which was quite genuine and be-
those shops from which the windows longed to his nature.
Nothing gave
and door have been removed in order him so much pleasure as to watch the
that sales by auction may be the more swindlers of his secondary profession
easily carried on in them. The auc-
tioneer was shouting in the rostrum,
and behold he was one of the billiard
players' Pictures, busts, watches,
jewellery and ornaments were the stock,
and a gaudy pair of vases was being
put up. There was hesitation in
bidding, and at last a voice offered
five shillings. After a few languid
bids the vases were knocked down to
this speculator, whom I could not see,
for a pound.
“Some people think these sales are
not genuine,” the auctioneer said, “but
I give you my word they are. Some
say that these bids are made by our
own friends, just to encourage the
others; but it is untrue. You, Sir,”
he added, turning to the successful
bidder, “you have never seen me before,
have you?”
We all looked towards the gentleman
in question and a displacement of heads
permitted me to see him clearly. It
was the other player in the game of
billiards.
“You 've never seen me before, have
you, Sir?" the auctioneer inquired
again.
“Never,” said the man.
That was on a Thursday. The next
day I met by chance an old acquaint-
ance, in whose curiosity shop in the
seaside town that I was now visiting
again I had, twenty and more years
ago, spent far too much time, drawn
thither partly by a natural leaning
towards pictures and books and pottery
and all the other odds and ends which
come from every corner of the earth
and all ages to make up the stock-in-
trade of such places, but more by the
#personality of the dealer. Nominally
at work. We used to discuss poetry
and painting, but above all the riddle
of life, and on his part always de-
structively. It was a very school for
cynicism, this little shop, where no-
thing, so far as I knew, was ever sold
and I was the only habitué. He had
an adopted niece, aged about seven—a
pert, pretty little creature whom he
spoiled utterly; he had a complaining
wife who had no patience with his
treatment of his niece, his Byronic
airs, his verbose sloth or his prevailing
gaiety, and affected none. He also had
a retinue of complacent servant-girls
whom his tropes and flashy theories
delighted.
Such was my Byronic friend in 1887
to about 1890; and I must confess not
often to have thought of him since;
and then last week, on this flying visit
to my old town, I saw him again. He
was bending over a portfolio, but I
knew his back at once. His hair had
become white and a little thinner; but
everything else was the same: the
ruddy cheek, the sparkling eye, always
lighting up at the originality of some
world-old denial or affirmation, the
Byronic open collar, the Byronic neck-
tie. He did not recognise me at first;
but instantly afterwards we resumed
the intercourse of twenty years before;
although now it was I who was the
older, not he. With him time had
stood still. The only change in his
talk was a tinge of embitterment, not
that he had failed financially, but that
his friends had left him. The com-
plaining wife was dead, nor did his
references to her dim his brilliant orbs;
but his adopted niece—it was her
hostility and her husband's to himself
burden, “After all I had done, too,”
rolled out once more, that phrase
which summarises so much of man's
dealings with man and perhaps more of
woman's dealings with woman.
He soon checked himself, however,
remembering my ancient tastes, and
clutched my arm. “What a world!”
he chuckled, “what a world ! I'll
show you something—something to
interest you. It's not far,” and he
pulled me along to the window of an
old picture shop. “Hush,” he said, “be
careful: walls have ears; but just look
at that painting there, that portrait.
What do you make of that 2"
It was a woman's face, obviously
eighteenth century, of the period, say,
of RAMsAY and REYNoLDs. She glim-
mered at us through layers of grime
and blister. “When do you think that
was painted 2" he asked.
“Oh, I don't know,” I said.
perhaps."
He doubled himself up with wicked
joy. “What a world!” he exclaimed.
“Three weeks ago! What a world!”
“Nonsense!” I replied.
“Truth,” he said. “I know the
painter.", -
He again pulled my sleeve and we
retired to a passage. He looked fear-
fully round and drew from his pocket
a creased page of a magazine. It was
an art magazine of recent date, and the
plate represented another eighteenth-
century lady. Underneath was printed
“Newly discovered Romney.”
He leaned against the wall and
squirmed. “Same man,” he gurgled
at last. “Same man. I watched him
paint it. What a world! Law, I
don't want to die yet!"

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM going to give myself a rare pleasure. I am going
to praise whole-heartedly a novel by an author whose work
was previously quite unknown to me. I see from the
advertisements, and indeed now remember to have heard,
that Mr. CoMPTON MACKENzIE has already written a story
that was very well received; but, as this had escaped me
personally, I approached Carnival (MARTIN SECKER) with
a mind wholly free from bias. After reading a couple of
pages I settled myself in my chair for a happy evening,
and thenceforward the fascination of the book held me like
a kind of enchantment. I despair, though, of being able
to convey any idea of it in a few lines of criticism. To say
that Carnival is the story of a modern dancing-girl is
nothing; there have been twenty such. But this book,
I give you my word, is different. Jenny Pearl herself, the
central figure, is so alive in all her tricks and mannerisms;
and two at least distinctly repellent; and she then pro-
ceeds to describe their efforts in the direction of romance.
These are hampered by the facts that both bachelors
| are poor, and that the two spinsters, who are cousins,
have been left a small fortune by an aunt upon the
condition that if either marries she must lose her share.
In Sarah, the vivacious and sympathetic heroine, the
authoress has, I think, drawn a really live and haunting
character: for the rest, I must find this further fault with
Maid's Money, that, though the scene is laid near the
Lizard, and though a considerable part of the book is
concerned with the dyspeptic troubles of Amy, the other
legatee, and the greediness of Dr. Bosanquet, her admirer,
there is no mention anywhere of Cornish cream.
Miss ELLEN ADA SMITH has a kind heart and a fluent pen,
some skill in handling a theme and a sense of romance.
Nevertheless I found The Last Stronghold (LoNG) little to ||
my liking. Of Lucy Kaye and all the other good people
her slang, her independ-
ence, and the strivings
of her small spirit are
all so real; and the
incidents of her short
life follow so naturally
and inevitably that
only in retrospect does
one appreciate the
tragedy of it. This
partly is why the book
impressed me with
such an effect of truth.
Actually Mr. MAC-
KENZIE has written one
of the grimmest trage-
dies that I remember
to have met with ; but
because he has never
once forced the note,
to let events and
characters speak for
themselves, it might
pass on a casual read-

who ran the gratuitous
asylum for impover-
ished workers at Lo-
ventor, Miss SMITH
writes with a single eye
to their good qualities
and from a loyal point
of view, which would
have been staunch and
admirable in a friend
of real life, but lacks
the criticism necessary
to an author of fiction.

not above backbiting;
we are out to learn the
defects, as well as the
merits, of the char-

ing for a record of trivial'
happiness. As for the style, I will only add that it gave me
the same blissful feeling of security that one has in listening
to a great musician—the knowledge that every tone will be
exquisitely right. This may seem extravagant praise, and
may turn out to be an entirely personal impression. We
shall see. In the meantime, having recorded my delight in
it, I shall put Carnival upon the small and by no means
crowded shelf holding those works of fiction that I reserve
“for keeps.”
Mrs. HENRY DUDENEY achieves a result which I am
forced to admire, but against her methods I find myself
in constant revolt. It is true that in Maid's Money
(HEINEMANN) her sentences are a little less abrupt and
Jingle-like than in A Large Room, but they still produce
a curious effect of looseness and haphazard arrangement.
She would reply, I suppose, that this is the way in which
her characters are looking at life, and that it is their story,
not hers. To pass on from manner to matter, the subject
of Maid's Money is one of such apparent barrenness that it
might well have given pause to the author of The Old
Wives' Tale; for Mrs. DUDENEY begins by introducing us
to four people—two men and two women—all past forty,
- hopeless to expect a
novelist's idea of crime to have anything in common with
the lawyer's, but even a moral fraud, if the story is going to
hinge on it and a term of imprisonment result from the con-
fession of it, ought not to be entirely honourable, altruistic,
even heroic. Yet, when Miss Kaye impersonated her brother
at his examination, her intentions were of the best, her
justification almost complete, and the effects very nearly
innocuous. Again, if only one of the people on whom she
lavished her subsequent legacy had shown a grasping nature,
the splendid conduct of the others would have carried more
conviction. I like contrast ; but there may be a section
of the public with a taste for unrelieved magnanimity and
undiluted worth, which will find the unfailing gentleness
of the dialogue an adequate substitute for the humour that
is wanting. Let me encourage that section to buy the
book, for Miss SMITH means very well by the world, and
her optimism, if it could be made a little less promiscuous,
should be encouraged. -
From a circular—
“Please send at the same time particulars of the First Sale of
Corsets now on.”
Perhaps it's better to wait till they're off before proposing

with no previous love-affairs, none of them good-looking,
to buy them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SORCERESS.
WE have received from Messrs.
Breitel and Herzkopf a copy of
Professor Quantock's remarkable exe-
getical monograph on his new orches-
tral work, “Circe's Swine.” After an
interesting preliminary chapter on the
pig in history, on pig-sticking as a fine
art practised by the Moghal Emperors,
on learned pigs, and on the range and
timbre of their voices, the Professor
expounds the psycho-philosophical
motives which led him to choose this
particular episode in the Odyssey for
orchestral treatment.
No one, as he points out, has ever yet
endeavoured fully to depict the emotions
of Odysseus' companions when they
were transformed by the sorceress. To
do so in words would be obviously
illogical, because they were deprived of
human speech. Now the resemblance
of the sound of the double bass to the
grunting of a pig has been noted by
BERLIoz, and Professor Quantock has
accordingly laid out his score for forty
double-basses—he is incapable, owing
to the development of his orchestral
sense, of writing in fewer than forty
parts—a solo violin (Circe) and a solo
saxophone (Odysseus). The symphonic
poem is in four movements: an Allegro
feroce; a Largo, Riposo del porcile ; a
Presto entitled Strillo del Diavolo :
and a Marcia Trionfalc—Salvezza di
Lardo, dedicated to Sir THOMAS LIPTON,
and referring to the re-humanization of
the captives.
The score of Professor Quantock's
great work is the most monumental
that has ever been published. It is
six feet high, four feet broad, and two
feet thick; it is appropriately bound in
pig-skin, and it involves the use of a
special desk patented and constructed
by Professor Quantock himself. A
point on which he lays peculiar stress
is the employment of an illuminated
bāton. That which he recommends is
made of Tibetan bamboo lit by acetylene
gas; but by an ingenious process the
colour can be varied on the principle of
railway signals; thus in easy passages
a green light is diffused, while danger
or difficulty is indicated by red. Purple
signifies mobilmente, while striking
effects are appropriately heralded by a
change to pink.
Another point on which Professor
Quantock lays great stress in his
masterly introductory monograph is
the costume of the conductor. As he
wisely observes it should be at once
hygienic, non-inflammable and pictur-
esque. Accordingly he strongly depre-
cates the use of flannelette or celluloid
collars. They are, he asserts, not
only dangerous but antagonistic to
She. “Just listEN To THE BIRDs "
He (fed up with the country). “Poor LITTLE BEGGARS
How, I suppose !”
MUST AMUSE THEMSELVEs some-
the exotic and Oriental mysticism'
which is the very life-blood of his work.
He therefore recommends a blue-green
himation of Esparto grass, with an
indigo-coloured fustanella, Afghan put-
tees with crocodile-skin spats, and
sandals made of compressed vegetable
marrow. “Such a garb,” observes the
Professor in an impressive passage,
“will not only enable a chef d'orchestre
to indulge freely in all the gesticulatory
bravura necessary to the interpretation
of the score, but it will harmonise with
the esoteric ethos—in short, the quint-
essential 8Aačepakirmats, on which I have
invariably relied in my appeal to the
culture-hunger of the million.”
The whole passage, which is redolent
of the joyous egotism of genius, is
deserving of citation, but we must
reluctantly content ourselves with this
brief but poignant excerpt. Nothing is
so typical of the tender-heartedness of
the Professor as his splendid resolve
to redress a crying grievance of the
animal creation—the exclusion of the
porcine genus from the domain of
romance. HoMER had dim gropings
after justice, but it has been reserved
for our greatest composer to achieve
this final triumph of humanitarianism.
In short, whether we regard Professor
Quantock's superb disregard for the
fetters of an effete classicism, his mag-
nificent protests against British insu-
larity—even to the length of his living
on sherbet and Turkish Delight when
composing his opera. Some Ezperiences
of a Turkish R.M.–or the glowing
paganism of his sacred music, we are
staggered alike by the dimensions of
his intellect and the touching fidelity
of those who regard him as our greatest
Comic, we mean Cosmic, Force.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [January 31, 1912.
WANTED: CARS FOR “MEN ONLY.”
[A contributor to The Daily Chronicle, commenting upon the reserva-
tion of certain L.C.C. tramcars for “ladies only,” remarks that
“unquestionably the fiercest tramcar hustlers are women."]
LAD1Es, your loyal servant ' I will suffer
None to allege that in the crowd's alarm
You need my generous body for a buffer,
Or want the stay of my protective arm;
What though your instincts may be soft and loving,
And feminine your nature to the bone,
I know for sure that when it comes to showing
You fairly hold your own.
If in the seething mob I've sought a carriage
Reserved for smokers on the District Rail,
Seldom have I had reason to disparage -
A prowess proven at the Great White Sale;
Competing with a sex that's learnt to wrestle
For faded chiffon or a half-soiled hat,
I've frankly owned myself the weaker vessel
At elbow-work like that.
And when, considerably hurt and heated,
With buckled ribs I penetrate the door,
I find a score of ladies firmly seated, º'
Leaving no site for me except the floor;
And there, like poor old (Edipus, my near eye
Gouged with a hat-pin in the recent scrap,
Riskily poised, a spectacle pour rire, I
Lurch with the lurching strap.
At last, aweary of the rough-and-tumble,
Acknowledging my manly spirit broke,
I stamp on my cigar and blindly stumble
Into the neighbouring place where none may smoke.
That chaste zenana, mostly meant for women,
Holds nothing but an agéd man or two,
And there I rest each sore and aching limb in
A wilderness of pew.
Such are the horrors we endure in Hades,
And, doubtless, 'tis the same in upper air;
We are no sort of match for you, sweet ladies,
In the ferocious art of “getting there ";
“What every woman knows” is known to BARR.E,
Yet even he has not explained the fact
That you prefer to rush our sanctuary
And leave your own intact.
So, while I praise the L.C.C.'s invention,
I still foresee its failure at a glance; -
No “Trams for Ladies" can relieve the tension,
Though well designed to give the men a chance;
Nor shall the unequal strife be else abated
Till companies adopt the needful checks
Dy having cars expressly consecrated
To us—the feebler sex.
THE INTERPRETATION.
CRICKET IN AUSTRALIA.
Thirteenth Match of the Tour.
THE M.C.C. Team to-day, against twenty-seven of
Kimbangeroo and District, had six wickets down for 59–
Woolley, Hobbs, Rhodes, Hearne and Douglas all being
caught in the slips. Foster and Barnes put on 91 before
the former was bowled off his pads by Tarvin. The innings
closed for 209. The home side scored 103 for twenty-two
for 60. The heat was oppressive. Gunn, Hitch and Mead
stood down.—All-Red Cricket Cable.
FLEET STREET CoMMENTs, BY our LoNG-DISTANCE ExPERT.
Cricketers are proverbially superstitious, and we may be
sure that the sinister fact that this was the thirteenth
match of the tour was seldom absent from the minds of
those who watched from the steps of the pretty little
Kimbangeroo pavilion the startling collapse of our early
batsmen. There is in reality no ground for surprise that
five out of the first six batsmen should all have been
caught in the slips, for if TARVIN opened the attack—as is
almost certain—we may be sure that he had at least nine-
teen of his fielders behind the wicket on the off side—a
number, if one comes to consider it, capable of forming
almost a solid phalanx. It should also be borne in mind
that TARVIN was bowling, without doubt, from the Oil
Tank end, so that he was swerving sharply with the
north-east wind (which prevails at this time of year in
that neighbourhood). WoollBY was the first to go–off a
bumping ball, we may be certain. That uppish stroke of
his to third man has all too often cut short a promising
innings. And after that—well, it became almost a proces-
sion. The brief cabled report does not, unfortunately, tell
us how SMITH got out, but it is pretty safe to surmise that
he got his leg in front of a straight one from TARVIN. I
wish him better luck next time ! -
Then came a fine stand by Foster and BARNES, which
put an entirely new complexion on the game, as before they
got together the first six wickets had fallen for 59, and by
sterling cricket they amassed no fewer than 91 in the
course of an hour and a half. (We may take that as a fair
average rate of ...; I think.) It is particularly inter-
esting to note, in the light of what I have said above, that
FostER was bowled at last—by TARVIN–off his pads. The
bowler had probably changed by this time to the Rope
Works' end. The total of 209 may be considered quite
satisfactory under the circumstances. I happened to
be speaking last week with a member of “W. G.'s" first
Australian Team, who assured me that the wicket at
Kimbangeroo was always soft on the top and surprisingly
hard underneath. I repeat his words for what they are
worth, merely adding the comment that they are not
worth much, as I learned afterwards that he was speaking
of another place of the same name, several thousand miles
distant. Still the observation was interesting.
Faced with the formidable total of 209 the home side
began batting in the full glare of an oppressively hot after-
noon. When TARVIN and his companion issued from the
pavilion the heat was indeed quite enervating, but heavy rain
cut short the day's play when 22 wickets had fallen for 103
runs. This astounding collapse had been brought about
by BARNEs. His figures—17 wickets for 60—speak for
themselves. But it is worthy of remark that this works out
at something very like 3! runs per wicket. The popular
little professional has seldom done anything finer.
To sum up—the home side are now 106 runs behind
with four wickets to fall. I think we have every reason
to be satisfied with the position. Nevertheless, in trying
to estimate what to-morrow will bring forth there are two
outstanding factors to be reckoned with. There is first
of all the weather. Should the home side have to bat upon
a wet wicket, the visitors will in all probability have
to field with a wet ball. That must not be forgotten.
Finally, there is the question that springs at once to
the mind, and as yet we have no means of answering it
—Is TARVIN out 2
I have only to add that GUNN, Hitch and MEAD stood
wickets before rain stopped play. Barnes had 17 wickets
down.

STORIES OF SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
II.--THE PAINTER's.
MR. PAUL SAMWAY's was in a mood
of deep depression. The artistic tem-
perament is peculiarly subject to these
moods, but in Paul's case there was
reason, why he should take a gloomy
view of things. His masterpiece, “The
Shot Tower from Battersea Bridge,”
together with the companion picture
“Battersea Bridge from the Shot
Tower," had been purchased by a
dealer for seventeen and sixpence. His
sepia monochrome, “Night,” had
brought him an I.O.U. for five shil-
lings. These were his sole earnings
for the last six weeks, and starvation
stared him in the face.
“If only I had a little capital' " he
cried aloud in despair. “Enough to
support me until my Academy picture
is finished.” . His Academy picture
was a masterly study entitled, “Roll
on, thout deep and dark blue ocean, roll,”
and he had been compelled to stop
half-way, across the Channel through
sheer lack of ultramarine.
The clock struck two, reminding
him that he had not lunched. He
rose wearily and went to the little
cupboard which served as a larder.
There was but little there to make
a satisfying meal—half a loaf of bread,
a corner of cheese, and a small tube of
Chinese-white. Mechanically he set
the things out. . . .
He had finished and was clearing
away when there came a knock at the
door. His charwoman, whose duty it
was to clean his brushes every week,
came in with a card.
“A lady to see you, Sir,” she said.
Paul read the card in astonishment.
“The Duchess of Winchester,” he ex-
claimed. “What on earth Show
her in, please.” Hastily picking up a
brush and the first tube which came to
hand, he placed himself in a dramatic
position before his easel and set to
work.
“How do you do, Mr. Samways?”
said the Duchess.
“G–good afternoon,” said Paul,
embarrassed both by the presence of
a duchess in his studio and by his
sudden discovery that he was touching
up a Stinset with a tube of carbolic
tooth paste.
“Our mutual friend, Lord Ernest
Topwood, recommended me to come to
ſou.”
Paul, who had never met Lord
Ernest, but had once seen his name
in a ha'penny paper beneath a photo-
graph of Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT, bowed
silently.
“As you probably guess, I want you
|
Paul opened his mouth to say that
he was only a landscape painter, and
then closed it again. After all, it was
hardly fair to bother her Grace with
technicalities.
“I hope you can undertake this
commission,” she said pleadingly.
“I shall be delighted,” said Paul.
“I am rather busy just now, but I
could begin at two o'clock on Monday.”
“Excellent,” said the Duchess.
“Till Monday, then.” And Paul, still
clutching the tooth paste, conducted
her to her carriage.
Punctually at 3.15 on Monday Lady
Hermione appeared. Paul drew a
deep breath of astonishment when he
saw her, for she was lovely beyond
compare. All his skill as a landscape
painter would be needed if he were to
do justice to her beauty. As quickly as
possible he placed her in position and
set to work. . . . .
“May I let my face go for a
moment 2" said Lady Hermione after
three hours of it.
“Yes, let us stop,” said Paul. He
had outlined her in charcoal and
burnt cork, and it would be too dark to
do any more that evening.
“Tell me where you first met Lord
Ernest ?” she asked as she came down
to the fire.
“At the Savoy in June,” said Paul
boldly.
Lady Hermione laughed merrily.
Paul, who had not regarded his last
remark as one of his best things, looked
at her in surprise.
“But your portrait of him was in
the Academy in May!” she smiled.
Paul made up his mind quickly.
“Lady Hermione,” he said with
gravity, “do not speak to me of Lord
Ernest again. Nor,” he added hur-
riedly, “to Lord Ernest of me. When
your picture is finished I will tell you
why. Now it is time you went.” He
woke the Duchess up, and made a
few commonplace remarks about the
weather. “Remember,” he whispered
to Lady Hermione as he saw them to
their car. She nodded and smiled.
The sittings went on daily. Some-
times Paul would paint rapidly with
great sweeps of the brush; sometimes
he would spend an hour trying to get
on his palette the exact shade of
green bice for the famous Winchester
emeralds; sometimes in despair he
would take a sponge and wipe the
whole picture out, and then start
madly again. And sometimes he
would stop work altogether and tell
Lady Hermione about his home-life.
But always, when he woke the Duchess
up at the end of the sitting, he would
say, “Remember!” and Lady Hermione
It was a spring-like day in March
when the picture was finished, and
nothing remained to do but to paint in
the signature.
“It is beautiful!” said Lady Her-
mione, with enthusiasm. “Beautiful!
Is it at all like me 2'' -
Paul looked from her to the picture,
and back to her again.
“No,” he said. “Not a bit. You
know, I am really a landscape painter.”
“What do you mean?” she cried.
“You are Peter Samways, A.R.A., the
famous portrait painter | "
“No,” he said sadly. “That was
my secret. I am Paul Samways. A
member of the Amateur Rowing Asso-
ciation, it is true, but only an unknown
landscape painter. Peter Samways lives
in the next studio, and he is not even
a relation.”
“Then you have deceived me! You
have brought me here under false pre-
tences !” She stamped her foot angrily.
“My father will not buy that picture,
and I forbid you to exhibit it as a por-
trait of myself.”
“My dear Lady Hermione,” said Paul,
“you need not be alarmed. I propose
to exhibit the picture as “When the
Heart is Young.' Nobody will re-
cognise a likeness to you in it. And if
the Duke does not buy it I have no
doubt that some other purchaser will
come along.”
Lady Hermione looked at him
thoughtfully. “Why did you do it?”
she asked gently.
“Because I fell in love with you.”
She dropped her eyes, and then
raised them gaily to his. “Mother is
still asleep,” she whispered.
“Hermione!” he cried, dropping his
palette and putting his brush behind
his ear. -
She held out her arms to him.
As everybody remembers, “When
the Heart is Young,” by Paul Sam-
ways, was the feature of the Exhi-
bition. It was bought for £10,000 by
a retired bottle-manufacturer, whom
it reminded a little of his late wife.
Paul woke to find himself famous. But
the success which began for him from
this day did not spoil his simple and
generous nature. He never forgot his
brother artists, whose feet were not yet
on the top of the ladder. Indeed one
of his first acts after he was married
was to give a commission to Peter
Samways, A.R.A.—nothing less than
the painting of his wife's portrait.
And Lady Hermione was delighted
with the result. A. A. M.

Knowing not who we are.

Was it the Jungfrau ?—well, so much for Harry;
Now let us turn to Bill.
He shall be full of rickshaws and chupatties,
And saises and Pathans and native chiefs,
The purdah, too (I never know what that is),
And immemorial gods and quaint beliefs;
He shall go on perpetually rippling
On whether East is East and West is West —
All the good stuff we learned at school from

No. When the weary catalogue is finished,
Waking a little from our stertorous nap,
We shall explain to them how we diminished
By one, this winter-tide, our handicap;
As who should calm a madman or a drunkard,
We shall describe that memorable scene
When we got out, though absolutely bunkered,
Dead on the eighteenth green.
Deaf to their stories of the tramp of legions,
The lightening of their luges, we shall tell

IN THE CART.
THE street was full. The noonday traffic swelled
Into full current down its twofold course;
And, in the midst, I suddenly beheld
An aged and shaggy horse.
Also a cart. A thing by no means strange,
I know, no novelty to warm the heart
To an awed rapture; but, by way of change,
He was inside the cart.
Oſt, doubtless, as his daily ways he took
He must have longed to know what 'twas to ride;
And, now the time had come, he wore the look
Of one well satisfied.
His eye was calm. Immovably serene
He watched the hurrying throng without alarm;
The freshness of the whole unblinkered scene
Possessed him with its charm.
The shrilling taxi-hoot did not upset
His marble gravity. Without a pang
He saw the blundering bus's rearward threat
And did not give a hang.
So rapt his gaze, he hardly seemed to hear,
Till, when some stormy Jehu, waxing wild,
Called on his gods, he pricked a conscious ear
And, for a moment, smiled.
But he grew grave, remembering ancient woes;
And once again a look of bland content
Softened the rigour of his Roman nose,
One felt that in his heart he blessed his lord,
Who, having seen him well and truly strive
So long, had hit upon the apt reward
Of giving him a drive.
And I, too, being moved beyond control,
Spake out aloud to an astonished street,
“That horse's lord,” I said, “is just the soul
That one would like to meet.”
Dut even as the words were on my tongue
The chariot turned—his amiable regard
Was on me—then behind a great gate swung:
It was a knacker's yard. DUM-DUM.

HE was a gentleman of pious mien,
And we were playing for the Captain's Bowl;
We stood all square upon the eighteenth green,
Eight inches from the hole.
I played the odd–a gentle tipping shot,
Tipping so tenderly that nothing stirred;
Then, in my agony, I quite forgot
And said the usual word.
My parson was the very best of men—
No sombre prude, though clerically draped ;
He only smiled—smiled like a seraph when
Nor was that all : he also boshed his stroke;
His rutted “remake "lipped the gaping can;
There was a hushful moment—then he spoke,
Spoke like a fellow-man.
Hub Notes.
“London, being the hub of the universe, revolves the
quickest,” says “A South African Woman" in The Daily
Mail. Since reading this we have spent an hour in Fleet
Street watching hubs, and have arrived regretfully at the
conclusion that they revolve the slowest.
“I hear the pattering feet of the nuns as they fly like a frock of
frightened birds.”—Daily Mail.

This is the very latest fashion in “nun's veiling.”

I’UNCH,
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TRIUMPH OF VICTORINE.
This morning I discovered that most
of my time for the last twenty years
seems to have been spent in agreeing
with people about the weather, and it
annoyed me. -
Then I happened to meet Victorine.
“Yes,” she smiled ; “shopping and
things. Do come; then you can hold
Nibs when I get to the purse part.
Isn't the sun scrumptious?”
I couldn't help sighing.
“Et tu, Brute 2 " I said sadly.
Victorine gazed inquiringly at me
through the mauveness of her veil.
“What do you suppose,” I said,
“that quite half the people of England
are talking about at this moment 2"
“Oh, I don't know,” she said.
“Stamps or Ulster or Germany or
something, I suppose.”
I shook my head.
“I think I'll let him walk a little
now,” she said thoughtfully. “And if
a motor comes you must pick him up.
What is it, then 2"
I was used to Victorine.
“It doesn't matter,” I went on
determinedly, “whether it's the milk-
man as he goes along handing people
milk, or your Aunt when she pays her
afternoon calls or watches her partner's
first deal at bridge—they all discuss the
same thing. Even you just now x -
“Jack!” she cried. “Quick; I can
hear a motor 1 ''
I grabbed Nibs by the scruff of his
neck and dropped my walking-stick,
then waited triumphantly for the
motor. It went the other way.
“Let him down,” ordered Victorine;
“you're hurting him. What were
you saying just now about Auntie and
the milkman 2"
Of course I had to tell her all over
again.
“If you mean the weather,” she
said, “I think you're quite wrong.
Besides, I only said that the sun was
nice.”
“I will bet you,” I said firmly, “that
the first four people that you speak to
this morning will all have some rotten
remark to make about it.”
Victorine laughed. “Right you are,”
she said, “I just love betting. A pair
of gloves against a new tie 2 If one of
the first four people I speak to doesn't
mention the weather, I win. One—
two—three—off Library first.”
“A lovely morning,” said the
Librarian, as I took charge of DE
MoRGAN's latest novel.
Victorine's smile was angelic.
“Lovely,” she agreed.
“Of course I know they'll talk about
the weather here,” she said a few
They did, -
After five minutes of it Victorine was
a little ruffled. -
“Two up,” I said, stopping for a
moment at a neckwear window. “Do
you think that green one would go
with this suit 2."
But Victorine was examining a small
piece of paper and we went on in silence.
“Stores next,” she said presently.
“Do not wriggle so, Nibs' " -
Outside the stores we were stopped
by a tall lady with an immense hat.
“My dear,” said the tall lady, “you're
just the person' And what a darling!
Will it bite? All that hair, you know,
hides the expression of its eyes. And
have you heard that dear Miss Ray
has fallen into a gas-stove? Simply
charred all over, my dear. So tiresome
and careless of her. And she says she
can't sing at my ‘Atrocities' concert
to-morrow. And what I'll do I'm sure
I don't know, unless you could per-
haps— ”
The worst of Victorine is that she is
so frightfully good-natured to people
that really don't matter.
“But of course I will,” she said.
The tall lady burst into a paean of joy.
“So kind and delightful of you, my
dear,” she ended up. “Yes, four songs,
if you don't mind. Do look at that
poor man sitting in the gutter with
the tram-conductor's hat and the boot-
laces ! And gutters are so damp. This
weather too! So cold. Three pipes
burst this morning. Simply oceans of
water " ''
“It would probably save time,” I
remarked as soon as the tall lady had
quite gone, “if you choose as your last
despairing hope the man that keeps the
tie department.”
Victorine smiled sweetly.
“One minute,” she said, “I want
some boot-laces — wild ones. Hold
Nibs while I get my purse.”
She darted away, and by the time
that I had sorted Nibs to our mutual
satisfaction she was purchasing large
and sticky-looking boot-laces from the
man in the gutter.
“I’ve won my bet,” she said as I
came up; “I’ve said heaps of things
to him and he hasn't mentioned the
weather once. And I'll want some
long white gloves for to-morrow night.
Let's get them now.”
I managed to drop the boot-laces
when she wasn't looking, and followed
her meekly to the department where
they sold gloves.
Ten minutes later, as we left the
stores, the man with the boot-laces
was still there, and I saw something
that I hadn't noticed before.
It was a dirty card, with the inscrip-

on the idea of the romance entitled “Thais.”
The composer of the Thais Waltz, which is
dedicated to Miss Constance Collier, is Miss

A NEw translation has been prepared,
and will shortly be published, of LEo-
PARDI's poems; while an eccentric
two-step founded on this work, to be
called “The Pessimists' Tangle,” has
been written by Miss Dinky Huss for
simultaneous publication. We need
hardly remind our readers that Miss
Huss is a lineal descendant of John
HUss. The dedication is to Mrs.
I'LINor GLYN.
Now that Mr. FRANK HARRIs's forth-
coming work on the Women of DICKENs
(“O my friends, what a book is here!"
to quote the judicious BLATCHFord)
is so far advanced, there is perhaps no
reason why we should suppress the
fact that the great aunt of England's
premier critic was none other than
Mrs. Gamp's famous friend and con-
fidante.
The publishers of Sir SIDNEY Colvin's
new edition of the Letters of Robert
Louis Stevenson wish us to state that
the impression which is gaining ground
in Methodist circles that Sir SIDNEY is
a descendant of the great CALVIN is
erroneous.
An entirely new comic opera, called
The Dromedary and the Darning Needle,
has been written by Mr. ARTHUR

Miss WESTA TULLY. Additional interest
is lent to the collaboration by the fact
that Miss TULLY is a lineal descendant
of MARCUs TULLIU's CICERO. The great

be the finest solo ever written since

I gave him the required information,
keeping nothing back. That was not
what I was afraid of.
“And how are your people?” he
continued. Never was such a thirst
for information; but I went through

zone of danger.
“You can see the whole of me now,”
I quibbled, “if you look carefully.”
He looked me up and down with a
dreadful air of proprietorship. “That's

“You must come and dine with me
one of these evenings,” he declared,
getting right on to it.
“Why?” I asked in self-defence.
“What about Wednesday?” he con-
tinued. Why I disliked the idea of
dining with him was that he always
does continue.
“What about it?” I asked again,
but without any real hope of escape.
“Can you dine with me next Wed-
nesday?”
“Let me see,” I said, meaning “in-
vent.” “Next Wednesday I am dining
with the Robertses.”
There are no Robertses, but he be-
lieved me implicitly.
“What about Thursday?” he asked.
“Thursday I have a seat for His
Majesty's.”
He believed that, too.
“Friday?"
“I am going away for the week-end.”
He believed that.
“Monday ?”
“I shall have gone away for the
week-end.”
“Tuesday?”
“The same argument applies.”
“Wednesday?"
“My week-ends,” I said confidenti-
ally, “are all week and no end.”
He believed all these, but he jumped
a period. “What about Thursday fort-
night?” he asked, with unflinching
optimism. I saw that the old line
of resistance was not worth pursuing,
and resolved on a desperate course.
“To tell you the truth—"I began.
He became suspicious at once.
“You are going to dine with me on
Thursday fortnight,” he said firmly.
“No,” said I, smiling with equal
firmness.
“Why?" he asked.
“Because I don't want to.”
At the exact moment when his
credulity ought to have begun, it ended.
“Right O !” he said, laughing (a bad
habit). “Thursday fortnight, at eight
o'clock sharp.”

A PhysiologiCAL expert has recently

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT is not often that I see eye to eye with the writers of
the potted eulogies that figure in the “announcements" of
publishers, but the case of Mr. H. DE WERE STACPoolE's
new novel, The Order of Release (HUTCHNson), forms
a notable exception to this rule. “A story,” says the
announcer, “sparkling with brilliant dialogue and crowded
with extraordinary, dramatic and humorous situations”;
and I am prepared to let that stand as my own verdict.
It is a tale of the Paris of 1770, and its strength of plot,
swiftness of movement, and deftness of character-drawing
place it well apart from the mass-
doom make the warp of Mrs. Ritchie's story; for woof you
have the ineffable manoeuvres of Eva. But for all the
weaver's skill something's amiss with the finished pattern.
You only see the charm of Violet indirectly through its alleged
effect on Mossmore; certainly not enough to account for
that effect. More real is the presentment of the girl's self-
torturing scruples. As for Tremayne it is possible that in
such a fit of absent-minded fervour as sometimes bemuses
the simple male, he should have fallen in love with Eva,
but that he should have lived with her fourteen years
without sounding the shallows of her brain and discovering
the range of her suburban malignities is quite inconceivable.
Eva, in simple fact, is overdone. Mossmore is described
- by his publisher as a “brilliant
of machine-made historical
novels. I am no amateur in
this kind; no plain, unlettered
chronicle of the adventures of
“John Blunt and his dear lord"
can hope to separate me from
four shillings and sixpence. But
I raced through The Order of
Release at a sitting. I followed
the Comte de Lussac in and out
of the Bastille like a lamb. The
duel of wits between the ad-
mirably drawn Baronne Linden
and M. de Sartimes, the Minister
of Police, never ceased to hold
me till it finished dramatically
on the last page. It is a fault
in most historical novels that,
while they almost invariably
have to do with the quest of
“the papers,” there is often a
doubt in the readers' mind as to
why these papers are so valu-
able. Mr. STACPoole scorns |
vagueness. M. de Sartines has
been cornering wheat, and has
a perfectly natural desire to
conceal the fact from a quick-
tempered populace on the brink
of starvation. Consequently,
when he has refused to release
the Baronme's lover from the
Bastille, and she, drawing him

one looks for in a climbing
cross-bencher—or a good story-
teller. Still, the book has
humour, observation, feeling,
incident—good stuff worthy of
a better design. And I must
solemnly protest against a
shocking libel, obiter aictum, on
Devonshire cream—enough to
prejudice any reviewer.
My feeling about The Lure
(MILLS AND Boon) is that it
really contains two quite separ-
ate plots, neither of which Miss
|E.S. STEvºss found to be quite
sufficient alone for a novel of
the length dictated by com-
merce; so that she has been
forced to hang them both
upon the same heroine. This
certainly is the impression pro-
|duced upon me by the very
abrupt change of setting and
motive in what is called Part
|Two. Plot the first revolves
about a now almost forgotten
venture of journalistic snobbery,

not to be wondered at that he

written and edited entirely by
persons of title. Here Anne
Moorhouse takes an appointment
as one of the unmentioned com-
starts back “as if she had struck him.” Mr. STACPoolE
has an unfortunate habit of not following up a success in
any given line of fiction. His motto appears to be “one
atmosphere, one novel.” But I remember M. de Sartines
as the hero of some short stories of his, so that there is a
reasonable hope that we shall meet this polished sleuth-
hound again some day. He will be welcome.
The Human Cry (METHUEN) begins on a note of interest
that is not quite sustained. You have a Sussex squire,
Tremayne (M.F.H., plain, just, dull); Eva, his wife, an
ignobly pushful, incredibly resilient “political woman,”
and fad-hunter; their niece, Violet, whose life is clouded
by the looming shadow of an hereditary taint; Aubrey
Mossmore, an astutely rising political luminary, drawn
somewhat from the orbit of his calculating worldliness by
this shy, prevailing star. His resistance, his surrender, her
moners who are to do the real work of running the gilded
toy; and the whole fantastic business, part bluff, part
fraud, is excellently told. The guiding spirit of the affair
is one Huntly Goss, a charlatan of compelling personality,
who at once makes love to Anne ; unavailingly, however,
since, with the instinct of the true heroine, she quite
rightly mistrusts him and marries somebody else. This, of
course, is the end of the story; but, as we are still only
halfway through the book, Miss STEvens starts again with
a married Anne, a far more melodramatic Goss for villain,
and the scenery (very well done) of the Upper Nile. This
last part is thrilling enough, but I fancied somehow
that the air of Egypt had an injurious effect upon Goss,
causing him to lose in reality, and to take on a generally
transpontine manner, for which the fascinating editor
of The Orb had not prepared me. Still, both stories
are good of their kind, even if they are obviously a little

renunciation, and then the tragedy of her predestinate
less than kin.

THE Tsar of RUSSIA, our news-
papers tell us, made a joke about the
weather on meeting a deputation of the
British visitors. It should soon be
possible to publish an Anthology of
the Jokes of Continental Royalties. It
will be remembered that the KAISER
made one in 1903. -
At the Labour Party Conference, Mr.
BRACE, M.P., declared that the sentences
passed by Mr. Justice LAWRENCE on
the men concerned in the Llanelly riots
“reached to the highest standard of
savagery.” This is a literary way of
saying that the punishment fitted the
crime.
Mr. CHURCHILL is to speak at Belfast
from a boxing platform. This is not
altogether inappropriate for one who
has, politically, boxed the compass.
They are proudly boasting in Carme-
lite Street that, while The Daily Mail
is with us, Miracles will never cease.
The Cologne Gazette is pleased to con-
firm the allegation that English women
cannot manage figures. Anyhow, the
figure of the average English woman
compares favourably with that of the
average German Frau.
A contemporary published, the other
day, an article entitled “Iſealth and
the Nose.” Which reminds us that
one meets not infrequently, especially
in cold weather, a nose which, to judge
by its complexion, is obviously enjoying
ruder health than the face to which it
is attached.
The Rev. LEON LINDEN, of Aurora,
Illinois, suggests that, as soon as a
man is married, a small hole should be
punched in the lobe of his left ear as a
token of his matrimonial status. It is
felt that this would be less humiliating
than the black eye which is the vogue
in certain circles.
No subject would appear to be too
gruesome to be treated of in a modern
book. A volume entitled Our Weather
has just appeared.
An ostrich which recently passed
away at a private Zoo in Bedfordshire
was found to have eaten seven pounds
of stones and a bicycle puncture outfit.
It is thought that the intelligent creature
had tried to cure an internal cut caused
by the sharp edge of one of the stones.

base employés reside, is causing some
anxiety. According to one account the
epidemic is German measles, and the
microbes have been deliberately let
loose by an emissary of the German
Government.
The latest rumour about the Censor
is that there is trouble in regard to two
artistes now appearing at the Hippo-
drome. It has been suggested that
Max and Moritz in the course of their
performance make remarks absolutely
unfit for publication, but there is some
difficulty in the matter owing (1) to
the fact that there is no one in the
Censor's office, or even on the Advisory
Committee, who has a knowledge of
the language of monkeys; (2) to the
in the further fact that their remarks are
“MONTE C.A.RLO PIGEON SHOOTING.

a very shabby prize.
From the Annual Report of the
Hibernian C.M.S.:-
“We sent out sixty dresses to Miss Forsythe

A word of explanation should have ac-
companied the dresses, and the mistake
would have been avoided.

THE New Bailey was crowded with
a gay and ſashionable throng. It was a
remarkable case of shop-lifting. Aurora
Delaine, 19, was charged with felon-
iously stealing and conveying certain
articles the property of the Universal
Stores, to wit thirty-five yards of
book muslin, ten pairs of gloves, a
spongé, two gimlets, five jars of cold
cream, a copy of the Clergy List, three
hat-guards, a mariner's compass, a box
of drawing-pins, an egg-breaker, six
blouses, and a cabman's whistle. The
theft had been proved by Albert Jobson,
a shopwalker, who gave evidence to
the effect that he followed her through
the different departments and saw her
take the things mentioned in the
indictment.

citement. The poor girl had no counsel!
What if her—yes, he would seize the
chance He stood up boldly. “I am,
my lord,” he said.
| Rupert Carleton was still in the
twenties, but he had been a briefless
barrister for some years. . Yet, though
briefs would not come, he had been very
far from idle. He had stood for Parlia-
ment in both the Conservative and
Liberal interests (not to mention his
own), he had written half-a-dozen un-
produced plays, and he was engaged to
be married. But success in his own
profession had been delayed. Now at
last was his opportunity.
He pulled his wig down firmly over
his ears, took out a pair of pince-nez
and rose to cross-examine. It was the
cross-examination which was to make
him famous, and is now given as a
model in every legal text-book.
“Mr. Jobson,” he began suavely,
“you say that you saw the accused
steal these various articles, and that
they were afterwards found upon her?”
“ Yos.” -
“I put it to you,” said Rupert, and
waited intently for the answer, “that
that is a pure invention on your part?”
“ No.” - - -
With a superhuman effort Rupert
hid his disappointment. Unexpected
as the answer was, he preserved his
impassivity.
“I suggest,” he tried again, “that
you followed her about and concealed
this collection of things in her cloak with
a view to advertising your winter sale?”
“No, I saw her steal them."
impervious to the simplest suggestion.
With masterly decision he tapped his
pince-nez and fell back upon his third
line of defence. “You saw her steal
them 2 What you mean is that you
saw her take them from the different
counters and put them in her bag?”
“Yes,” t
“With the intention of paying for
them in the ordinary way?”
4 * No.” .
“Please be very careful. You said
in your evidence that prisoner, when
told she would be charged, cried, “To
think that I should have come to this
Will no one save me 2' I suggest
that she went up to you with her col-
lection of purchases, pulled out her
purse, and said, ‘What does all this
come to ? I can't get anyone to serve
me.'" -
“No." -
The obstinacy of some people !
Rupert put back his pince-nez in his
pocket-and brought out another pair.
The historic cross-examination con-
tinued. -
“We will let that pass for the
moment,” he said. He consulted a
sheet of paper and then looked sternly
at Mr. Jobson. “Mr. Jobson, how
many times have you been married?”
“Once.” - • *
“Quite so.” He hesitated and then
decided to risk it. “I suggest that your
wife left you?”
“Yes.” -
It was a long shot, but once again
the bold course had paid. Rupert
heaved a sigh of relief.
“Will you tell the gentlemen of the
jury,” he said with deadly politeness,
“why she left you?”
“She died.”
A lesser man might have been em-
barrassed, but Rupert's iron nerve did
not fail him.
“Exactly!" he said. “And was that
or was that not on the night when
you were turned out of the Hampstead
Parliament for intoxication ?”
“I never was.”
“Indeed? Will you cast your mind
back to the night of April 24th, 1897?
What were you doing on that night?”
“I have no idea,” said Jobson, after
casting his mind back and waiting in
vain for some result.
“In that case you cannot swear that
you were not being turned out of the
Hampstead Parliament—”
“But I never belonged to it.”
Rupert leaped at the damaging ad-
mission.
“What? You told the Court that
you lived at Hampstead, and yet you
say that you never belonged to the
Hampstead Parliament? Is that your
“I said I lived at Hackney.”
“To the Hackney Parliament, I
should say. I am suggesting that you

ment for * >
“I don't belong to that either.”
“Exactly " said Rupert triumph-
antly. “Having been turned out
for intoxication?”
“And never did belong.”
“Indeed? May I take it then that you
prefer to spend your evenings in the
public-house?”
“If you want to know,” said Jobson
angrily, “I belong to the Hackney
Chess Circle, and that takes up most
of my evenings.”
Rupert gave a sigh of satisfaction and
turned to the jury.
“At last, gentlemen, we have got it.
I thought we should arrive at the truth
in the end, in spite of Mr. Jobson's
prevarications.” He turned to the wit-
ness. “Now, Sir,” he said sternly, “you
have already told the Court that you
have no idea what you were doing on
the night of April 24th, 1897. I put it
to you once more that this blankness
of memory is due to the fact that you
were in a state of intoxication on the
premises of the Hackney Chess Circle.
Can you swear on your oath that this
is not so 2 ''
A murmur of admiration for the
relentless way in which the truth had
been tracked down ran through the
court. Rupert drew himself up and
put on both pairs of pince-nez at once.
“Come, Sir!” he said, “the jury
| is waiting.” -
But it was not Albert Jobson who
answered. It was the counsel for the
prosecution. “My lord,” he said, getting
up slowly, “this has come as a com-
plete surprise to me. In the circum-
stances I must advise my clients to
withdraw from the case.”
“A very proper decision,” said his
lordship. “The prisoner is discharged
without a stain on her character.”
Briefs poured in upon Rupert next
day, and he was engaged for all the
big Chancery cases. Within a week
his six plays were accepted, and within
a fortnight he had entered Parliament
as the miners' Member for Coalville.
His marriage took place at the end of
a month. The wedding presents were
even more numerous and costly than
usual, and included thirty-five yards
of book muslin, ten pairs of gloves, a
sponge, two gimlets, five jars of cold
cream, a copy of the Clergy List, three
hat guards, a mariner's compass, a
box of drawing pins, an egg-breaker,
six blouses, and a cabman's whistle.
They were marked quite simply, “From

A highly decorative crew,
Distinguished by their “mighty pens”
From common barndoor cocks and hens.

through the living-room to a room

of miscellaneous articles. Others were

A MATTER OF BLAZONRY.
WHILst moodily contemplating the
walls of my new office and brooding
upon the dearth of clients, I conceived
the idea of putting up the shields of
my University and my College.
Their presence would suggest an
air of unremitting application to toil
and honour. Nothinking beholder, I
reflected, could gaze on those triumphs
of the heraldic painter's art without
being seized with an instant resolve
to throw his legal affairs unreservedly
into my hands and leave them there
indefinitely.
It was within the scope of a trifling
outlay to inspire these just and noble
sentiments.
went out.
“In the first place,” I said to the
young woman in the Fancy Goods
department, “ I want gules, on a cross
ermine, between four lions passant
guardant, or, a Bible lying fessways of
the field, clasped and garnished of the
third, the clasps in base. I might
mention,” I added, observing an uneasy
look upon her face, “that though they
are really lions they don't look like it
except for their manes and long wavy
tails.”
She appeared relieved.
“Yes, Sir-if you'll kindly step into
the next department.”
In stepping there I must have lost
my way. I was just moving off in
despair to a neighbouring glass to
compile an accurate description for
the Lost Property Office, when a relief
party organised itself at my elbow.
“I beg your pardon,” I inquired of
her with bitter irony, “but do you
happen to have a map about you?”
“Maps, Sir? Yes, Sir, fourth floor,
third department on the right.”
There you are; that shows how
miserably I am misunderstood.
I wandered about a bit until I way-
laid another young person, to whom I
formulated my wishes. She behaved
splendidly. I expect one of her an-
cestors had been something in the
lion-taming line. We traversed many
departments, chatting pleasantly during
the journey. After twenty minutes or
so we arrived at some kind of a desti-
nation.
“Miss Jenkins, forward!" called my
fellow-traveller.
Looking dispassionately at Miss
Jenkins, I shouldn't have thought it of
her, but it was none of my business,
and I proceeded to acquaint her with
the nature of my requirements.
“Yes, Sir. Four, I think you said.

THE WITCH-PLANT.
(Thoughts on trying a certain cigar.)
THou dreadful weed, Corona y Dolores,
Thou weed from whom all sins and sorrows bud,
Thou weed that makst me wonder where the door is,
Thou weed that I should trample in the mud,
Only I want thee—twisted by the Furies
And sealed with blood.
I shall not smoke thee longer, but, by Pluto,
I have some work for thee, strange herb, at whom
All lips are pursed with horror to a mute “Oh "
All nostrils sickened—I shall re-illume
(Banging it out just now against my boot-toe)
Thy baleful bloom.
Deep in some hollow was the poison-thicket
That reared thy spotted leaf in alien climes;
The vulture flew above and could not stick it,
But croaked repentant of his various crimes;
Yes, I shall keep thee—thou art just the ticket
For certain times:
Times when in some small restaurant I dally
Over the Munich beer, and bid the cloud
Of fragrant incense from my pipe-bowl sally,
And some dashed waiter hurries through the crowd
To say that pipes (good ghost of WALTER RALEIGH!)
Are not allowed.
Then I shall take thee forth and light thee slowly,
And stir the puissance of thy sleeping heart,
Thou stronger much than wolf's-bane or than moly,
Thou deadlier than nightshade; then shall start
One good green whiff, and they shall learn the holy
Horror thou art.
And straightway in that Stygian wave's immersion
There shall be cries of women dolorous,
And going to and fro and loud excursion,
And pouring forth of prayers and fearful fuss
(Very much like the Covent Garden version
Of GEdipus);
And crawling to me now, no more indignant,
The manager shall say, “Our sins are ripe;
We never dreamed of odours so malignant;
Release us, gentle stranger, from their gripe;
Descendant of the Borgias, be benignant
And smoke your pipe.” EvoB
AUTHER AND ALFRED.
AT half-past five a stillness so perfect as to be startling
brooded over the library. At this hour it is not unusual
for three girls (to say nothing of a boy) to be let loose on
the world, which means that they gravitate irresistibly to
the library and to me. To-day, however, they were else-
where, and the consequent peace was so inviting and
pleasant that the sordid idea of devoting it to purposes of
work was excluded. An armchair before the fire, an easy
book—that, obviously, was the way to use this heaven-sent
opportunity. I sank luxuriously into the one and took
up the other, and made the situation complete with a
cigarette.
At this moment there came a sound of plump and slippered
after a preliminary struggle with the handle, was gently
opened, and John's curly head peeped round it.
“Halloa, l’’ said I.
“I’m a messager,” said he.
“Oh, you're a messenger, are you?
message?”
“To cut this pencil. Peggy broke it.”
I began to cut it and continued the conversation.
“Whose messenger are you?”
“The girlses messager. They're writin’.”
“What's Helen writing?”
“A diry.”
“What's Rosie writing?”
“Poitry.”
“And what's Peggy writing 2 ”
“A theeter.” -
“Oho,” said I, “literature and the drama. That's what's
keeping them away, is it? But don't you let them order
you about too much. We must stand together, you know,
we men.”
“I’m not “we men' to-day,” said John, thus indicating
that our alliance was at an end. “I’m the girlses messager,”
and, the pencil being now duly cut and pointed, he departed
on his tip-toes noiselessly and with great deliberation,
having evidently persuaded himself that mystery was the
chief characteristic of the perfect messenger.
There was another half-hour of quiet, and then with a
rush the whole party of blue-stockings, headed by their
excited Mercury, burst in upon me. -
“Helen,” I said, “is your diary finished 2"
“Yes, every word of it; but you mustn't read it, because
diaries are secret.” - -
“Then,” said I, “Rosie will show me her poetry. Poetry's
meant to be read.” - -
But Rosie excused herself. Her metre, she said, had
bothered her; some of the lines had got too long, and others
seemed to be too short. Besides, there were one or two
rhymes that she must think over again. In the meantime
the poem must also be treated as secret.
“But,” she added, “Peggy's finished her play, and we all
want you to read it. We're going to act it in the nursery
to-morrow.”
Thereupon Peggy, with all the nonchalance of a hardened
dramatist, pressed a sheet of foolscap into my hands and
retired to the sofa. The rest grouped themselves about her;
and this is what I read to the gathering. I merely pre-
mise that in transcribing I have separated the speeches,

My friend Kerslake has a case in
King's Bench, Court C.I., to-morrow,
and he thinks he will probably win.
What is more, he will tell you why.
“It is all about selling rubber planta-

might expect, there is not too much
honesty on either side. My man is the
defendant and a knave, but, the plaintiff
is a worse knave, so my man ought to
pull it off. It is really for the judge
and jury to make up their minds,
between them, which is the better of
a bad two. My man has, at any rate,
been actually caught stealing rubber
off one of the plantations he had sold.
Therefore, I think he ought to get home
all right.” - *
“Oh, indeed!” I said non-commit-

“therefore.” But Kerslake explained.
“It shows,” he said, in his forensic
manner, “that my man did anyhow sell
one plantation with some rubber on it.”

THE SLEUTH STALK.
THE Sleuth Stalk is a dance, or
rather a terpsichorean gymnastic.
I am the Sleuth Stalker.
I am the Pet of the Ball-room.

When I enter the dancing-room,
all the ladies' eyes turn on me. Blue
eyes, grey eyes, brown eyes, wicked
black eyes and heather mixture eyes,
all look to me appealingly. I do not
ask the pleasure of a dance. I confer
the honour of a Sleuth Stalk.
I am It.
When I dance, my back bends, my
arms protrude, my eyes glaze and my
cheek, rubbing against that of my
partner, produces a sound as of sand-
paper. Sometimes my feet are in a
hurry, sometimes they are uncompro-
misingly still. I do not look where I
am going because I do not know.
the beat of the music; I openly defy
them. My dancing is audacious, un-
orthodox, ineffable and wholly unscru-
pulous. And so it succeeds. It is
strange, grotesque, weird, terrific, awe-
inspiring and monstrous.
But it is not new.
They all think it is new, but it is not.
I have been dancing it for years and
years and years, unnoticed or, if noticed,
avoided. It was only when I called it
the Sleuth Stalk, to give it an air of
novelty, that it caught on. To achieve
in the ball-room of to-day, your per-
formance must not only be hideous, it
must also be novel. I have achieved,
not by novelty but by an undetected
revival.

Do you remember an old, old dance

No? Think again. Yes? It all comes
back to you from the dim, forgotten,
dully respectable past.
You remember the Waltz, but you
do not remember my Waltz. If you
were ever unlucky enough to get in the
away from it. If, in spite of your
efforts, you got mixed up with it, you
insisted on forgetting it as soon as you
could. It was the best I could do, but
it was neither successful nor popular.
My Waltz was a bad Waltz. I was
credibly informed that it was a very
bad Waltz.
But it is a startling success as a
Sleuth Stalk.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE PIGEON.”
UP to the end of the Second Act I
couldn't tell whether it was more the
fault of the actors or of the author that
I was enjoying myself so immensely.
But in the Third Act there was no
question about the chief responsibility;
for the actors kept going on as well as
ever, yet the play came rather tamely
to an end that was no conclusion, since
it left things pretty much as they were
at the start. With the memory of
Mr. GALsworthy's Justice still weighing
heavily upon us we had sat there
through two delightful scenes in-
credulously happy over our luck in
finding him in a mood of gaiety;
touched, it is true, with pathos, but still
gaiety. We had seen that charitable
artist, Wellwyn, the Pigeon of the soft
and downy breast, being plucked to
heart's content (his and theirs alike) by
three ne'er-do-weels—a drunken cab-
man, a flower-girl of no repute, and a
fascinatingalien vagabond with leanings
(The unusual arrange-
ment—very embarrassing for sitting
models—by which the large studio
window, bare of blinds, gave to the
passer-by an unchecked vision of the
interior, was, of course, a constant en-
couragement to these intrusions.) But
as we watched their easy manoeuvres
we kept wondering, from moment to
moment, how soon we should have to
pay for our fun by a serious homily on
the evils of indiscriminate charity.
When in the Second Act Mr. GALs-
worthy brought together a Professor
of Economics and a Justice of the
Peace, known to have violently anta-
gonistic views on social problems, we
clenched our teeth grimly to face the
terrors of a full-dress debate on the
Minority Report of the Poor Law
Commission; and when they were
posted into a side room (of), and the
play went on without them, we could
hardly believe our good fortune.
But we were not to escape in the
end ; and the Third Act realised our
worst fears. Curiously enough the
threatened diatribe against our present
social system was put into the mouth
of the most light-hearted impostor of
them all—the alien vagabond. De-
livered with a foreign accent and
incredible swiftness (for Mr. DENNis
EADIE was just as anxious as we were
to get it over), it left me a little be-
wildered. But I vaguely gathered that
the machinery of our reformatory in-
stitutions was lacking in the human
element; that it attempted to coop wild
creatures in a common cage, and
generally made no allowance for the
But since the whole play had been an
illustration of the other method, and
the Pigeon's milk of human kindness,
a beverage freely imbibed by this elo-
quent vagabond, had been proved to
contain no sort of recuperative qualities,
it was clear that the problem, as usual
with Mr. GALsworthy, was left with-
out solution. Certainly the epithet
“hopeless,” so freely conferred upon
the Pigeon by his commonsense
daughter, and obviously applicable also
to his protégés, seemed to serve equally
well for Mr.GALsworthy's own outlook.
Indeed, if his seriousness had not been
already firmly established, we might
have judged him, from the humour of
this play, to be just a gentle-hearted

cynic. The most irresponsible satirist
of human nature could hardly have
tickled us more effectively than Mr.
GALsworthy does with his portrait of
the irredeemable cabman, or given a
more piquant turn to a familiar phrase
than that which came so glibly from
the vagabond's lips when, after telling
how the flower-girl had adopted the
life “ of joy,” he goes on to say that in
the house where they had tried to
reform her by placing her in domestic
service she had “got the footman into
trouble.”
It would be difficult to praise too
highly the remarkable performances of
the whole cast. The most difficult
parts fell to Mr. EADIE and Miss MAR-
GARET MoRRis. As the French vaga-
bond the former was extraordinarily
subtle in his suggestions both of race
and temperament. The latter, as the
relieved from time to time by a slow
smile of sinister intelligence or a sudden
burst of passion, gave a fearless in-
terpretation of a character whose
brooding savagery was presented by
the author with an unsparing fidelity.
A Constant Lover made a most
attractive curtain-raiser, in which Mr.
EADIE and Miss GLADys Cooper played
with a very natural ease. It contained
several happy phrases that fell nicely
into their right places—in particular,
a definition of genius as an “infinite
capacity for making other people take
pains.” Many of those who listened
to this pleasant flow of dialogue must
have reflected sadly how good a friend
the theatre has lost by the too-early
fate of St. John HANKIN. O. S.
THE DIARY OF A TWIN SOUL.
“M.P.K.” and I have a very great
deal in common. I believe we are
twin souls, which is a very beautiful
and comforting thought. I have never
met “M.P.K.” and there is no earthly
reason to suppose I ever shall; but I
have found his diary for last year, and,
as I have said, he and I have a very
great deal in common. I am going to
think of him as Monty—dear old Monty,
my twin soul.
The place in which I found dear old
Monty's diary proved at the outset the
affinity between us. I caught sight of
it on the top of a pillar at the end of
some railings (shoved back where the
beginning of a wall made a little recess)
as I was getting off a motor-'bus, and
I went over and reached up and got it.
(Monty and I are about the same
height.). A funny place to put a diary,
you will say. True. But it proved
that dear old Monty, like me, h d
suffered the difficulty of getting rid of
diaries. Monty had been through it,
so to speak. Monty had wrestled with
the problem year after year. Monty
had realised that nobody wants an old
diary, spotless though it be; that you
cannot sell an old diary to the man
who swindles you over your review
copies of new books; and it is a pleasant
feature of our character (Monty's and
mine) that we cannot bring ourselves
to burn a diary.
Personally, I have given up the
problem. I keep my diaries. I have
got a complete, unbroken set dating
from 1887. One of these days I dare-
say they will be quite valuable—they
will be advertised as “almost new,”
“each copy autographed by the author.”
Monty, however, is not such a keen
book-collector as I am. At the close
of every year my dear old chum creeps

speak a great mind firmly taking over
It is a glorious thing to discover a
twin soul quite unexpectedly. From
that starting-point of finding that
Monty had infinite pains in settling
what to do with his old diary—thence
onwards, as I turned the pages, I think
I have never had a more moving ex-
perience.
It might have been my own book,
so exactly does Monty's character run
with mine. All the early pages, the
absorbing pages before you come to
the diary proper, the Preamble to the
Bill, were filled in with the scrupulous
care and attention to detail that be-
the responsibilities. of a new duty.
Watch No. —, Stores ticket No. —, Sea-
son ticket No. —, they were all there.
Weight, height, size in gloves, collar,
hat—not an item was left blank. Bills
to be paid—I really don't think Monty
could have omitted a single one. I
hope not, for Monty's sake.
I tell you I was positively trembling
in an ecstasy of friendship at its highest
level as I finished these exquisitely
compiled catalogues and turned to
“Jan. 1.”
“Jan. 1. Dull, but fairer about lunch-
time, and then rainy again. Cold
evening with some fog. Arose 7.59%.
This year I am not going to put down
any wild and stupid protestations of
my determinations to keep a diary. I
think I have done with that kind of
thing. I think I realise at last my own
shortcomings. No, quite simply I here
state my resolve to keep a daily
check, however trifling, on my life
throughout the year. I shall try my
best to make the record a full one; but
I am not going to aim too high. I do
not wish, at the close of the year, to be
mocked by any great resolutions that I
have written here. No, just a brief
note each day is all I shall aim at-
Nulla dies sine linea. Of to-day's
doings I shall say nothing. I have
made a good start, that is all. This,
the first entry, shall be solely devoted to
the little hope and resolve it bears.
Midnight is striking; when next I
spring out of bed my first action
will be to record that I was up at
6.45.”
I must confess that for a moment
I had doubts of Monty as I finished
that. It was just what I had written
yearly since 1887; but it had a quiet
depth of confidence and determination
that was a little quieter and a little
deeper than anything I had reached.
The unmanly thought arose that I had
made a mistake in Monty—that he was
going to pull it off—that we were not
twin souls after all.

say about it, Monty did not appear to
spring out of bed until June 23rd. No
mark, no blemish appears on the pages
between Jan. 1st and that date; and
further, far from springing out of bed,
he then appears to be just getting in
again. TRe entry reads with the faint
scratchiness that belongs to nothing
on earth but a ball-room programme
pencil, and reads:—
“A topping, topping dance. Eleven
with A. She wouldn't have let me keep
her glove if she didn’t. Good night!”
The inexperienced diarist would have
paused here in shame to go on. Honour
would have prevented his probing fur-
ther into the romance that burst into
those pages on June 23rd. I knew
Monty better. Passages very similar
are to be found in my own diaries of
'88, '90, "92-3-4 and 1900. They are
invariably followed, moreover, by what
I looked with confidence to find on
June 24th—and found.
“Met A at lunch at the D's. I have
been wasting my life up to now. But
a long talk about self-discipline. She
thinks, as I have long thought, that

spoke about the assistance to self-
discipline of writing down in your
diary the conquests over self that one
has made. I shall do so henceſorth.
I am going to turn over a new leaf.”
Dear old Monty did better than that.
He turned over about 150 and left
them all new and unstained. The next,

MAKING HAY BY MOONSHINE.
THE previous day I had taken stock
of my age. I manfully faced the facts,
which were as follows. In nine years'
time I should be exactly the same age
as Joseph Williams' Was it possible?
But there was worse. In five years
only (and what was five years?)
I should be as old as Williams was
scarcely four years ago / Worse still,
in barely two years I should actually
be as old as Williams had been about
I could scarcely credit it. I discarded
Williams and worked out how long it
would take me to reach seventy-three,
which, for some reason that I do not
understand, always seems to me a
particularly difficult age to face. When
I made the same calculation for
Williams, however, I was somewhat
inspirited, and I composed myself by
recalling that OLIVER CROMWELL was
forty before he was ever heard of, and
that Lord Roberts took up the South
African command in his seventieth
eat. *
Thus fortified, I had forgotten all
about my birthday by the next morning
when I opened my Aunt Angela's
letter and the money-order fell out on
the floor and frightened me. The last
commission from my aunt had been to
choose prizes for the Village Coronation
Sports. On this occasion, however,
it was only a present.
“Well,” said my wife promptly,
“there is no excuse for not having
your hair cut now.”
This remark was most unjust. The
facts were that I was going to have my
hair cut five days before, but Valerie
herself rang me up just as I was leaving
the office and put it out of my head.
I now explained this in detail.
My position was embarrassing. With
the intention of securing to me a happy
anniversary my aunt had fastened on
me an obligation to solve the following
problem:-I had to buy myself some-
thing I really wanted which was to
cost exactly two sovereigns, and which
I should not in the ordinary course
allow myself. I don't say the task
was impossible, I merely say that after
contemplating it for half a minute I
gave up the problem. I put the money-
order into my pocket-book and went
about my affairs with a sense of exalted
affluence—a vague impression of having
more money than I knew how to spend.
That money-order became a talisman.
I was the owner of the inexhaustible
purse; the hero of the miraculous dibs.
I was released from all predicaments
of economy. I spent those wretched
coins three times a week for months;
it became a habit. First, they sprang
a new stair-carpet on us. I do not
say that I regret that stair-carpet, but
I do regret the pedigree Airedale pup
which yielded to the same charm the
very next day, for I understand that it
was due to his special purity of race
that he died soon afterwards. And
I cannot to this day imagine what
persuaded me to take an interest in big-
game trophies. It was, of course, an
extraordinary bargain, but I had no
idea, until I got it into the cab, that
the head of a hippopotamus is such
so terrify the children. I have proved
since, what I did not know then, that
the principle of trying to wipe out the
memory of a faux pas in the auction-
room by other enterprises in the same
field of action is a wrong one. Know-
ledge of this kind is only attained '.
actual experience, but I may remar
that it is most undesirable that the
acquisition of such experience should
be matter for emulation in a household.
On the contrary, it should be confined
strictly to the head of the family. I
had to speak to this effect quite clearly
to Valerie on the subject of the antique
copper warming-pans. Even when
used in a scheme of decoration with
ribbons on them and their bows changed
once a month, it is easy to have too
many warming-pans in a small house.
However, this matter of the warming-
pans rescued me, for it gave me an
idea, and I began to search my pocket-
book. I spread the contents out upon
the table and sorted them through.

A NARROW ESCAPE.
[It has been pointed out in the daily Press
that, whereas painters as a rule reach a ripe old
age, music usually brings an early death to its
devotees.]
PAINTER who serenely painted
Just outside this door of mine,
Till the atmosphere was tainted
With the stench of turpentine,
Little dreamed you of the venomed
Thoughts arising in my chest,
As you whistled, sang and then hummed
“All the latest and the best.”
Little dreamed you your melodious
Perseverance oftentimes
Proved particularly odious
To a bard in search of rhymes,
Till his ultimate intention
Was to merit murder's dues—
Ancient Bailey, swift suspension
And his portrait in the News.
For I felt your paint portended
You would live three score and ten
Ere at last your music ended,
And I could not wait till then ;
So I seized a handy hatchet
And prepared your noise to check;
You, in short, were going to catch it
Violently in the neck,-
When the sudden recollection,
“Music's hold on life is faint,”
Stayed my hand; in your affection
Song so plainly ousted paint;
Swiftly did I lay that burly .
Axe aside, appeased to see
That to reach the graveyard early
seven years before It was horrible.

THE PACKING. |
“CERTAINLY not,” said Alfred, in
reply to various well-meant offers of
assistance from the family; “I much
prefer to do it myself. Packing is one
of those things that are perfectly easy
if you work them on a proper system.”
Alfred had been asked to a “Cinder-
ella and stay the week-end" at the
Willmotts'. He has only recently put
his hair up—or whatever it is men do
to show that they can be invited to
grown-up dances—and this was really
his first invitation to go unchaperoned
by the rest of us, and therefore some-
thing of an event.
“The proper system,” he explained,
about a week before the date of de-
parture, “is to rehearse an imaginary
day, and put out everything you are
likely to want, as you think of it.”
After several of these imaginary days,
when Alfred's room had assumed an
appearance suggestive of something
between a rummage sale and an
eviction, it was asked him whether the
system also included imaginary luggage,
hold more than half of these things, let
alone your one presentable suit-case!”
So the last forty-eight hours were
spent by Alfred in a severe sub-editing
of the system. Even here, however, he
showed himself intolerant of advice.
“Five dress-shirts for a week-end may
appear absurd to girls,” he said wither-
ingly, “because you don't understand.
Besides, they prevent the hair-wash
from getting broken.”
One is bound to admit that when
completed the result really did look
rather nice. Alfred's pyjamas, in which
he has a remarkably neat taste, im-
parted a chic and elegance to the top
layer, which, it was generally felt,
could not fail favourably to impress the
eye of a valet. Nothing appeared to
have been forgotten, even to two pairs
of white gloves and a tin of superfluous
shaving-cream. The fact that he was
obliged to carry his sponge and tooth-
brush in his overcoat pocket was ex-|
plained by the inventor as a foreseen
result of the rehearsal system, which
could easily be remedied by keeping
duplicates of these articles. -
our congratulations with a very be-
coming modesty. “It's just system,”
he said, as he locked the perfected
evidence of success. “I don't suppose
I should be any better at it than any-
one else if I hadn't taken the trouble to
think the matter out.”
The actual departure was thus some-
thing of a small triumph. As we waved
our hands to Alfred's retreating figure
there was a general impression that
the cadet of the family had proved
himself worthy of its best traditions.
The journey before him was a longish
one, and Alfred's mother had exacted
a promise that he would wire news of
his safe arrival. Under ordinary cir-
cumstances she might have suggested
a knotted handkerchief as an aid to
memory, but in face of the system any
such proposal was felt to be not only
unneeded but impertinent. “He'll do
it without that,” we said.
He did. The wire reached his family
just as it was sitting down to dinner,
and about half-an-hour after the de-
parture of our last post. It was very
brief. “All well,” it said; “please

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE to thank Mr. Joseph CoNRAD for taking me so
intimately into his confidence, for the confidence was more
than worth while and the taking was very pleasantly done.
Some Reminiscences (NASH), if it defies analysis, makes
capital reading. I feel now as a listener might feel who,
having been silent by choice during an hour or two's yarn-
ing, is suddenly called upon to express an opinion. Bless
my soul! I have no opinion, except that I was vastly
intrigued and quite oblivious of the passage of time during
the recital. The sensations, experiences and observations
of a much-troubled Pole, a beloved author and a certified
master of the British Mercantile Marine were casually
uttered as they cropped up. There was, I remember, some
talk of NAPoleoN and the Russian Empire, and a vivid
account of how a novel comes into being. Beyond that,
I can only say that I spent a delightful evening in the

weak enough to turn to the last page of the book. I wanted
to know the best or the worst at once, before the regiment
and the Major and the Gunner moved on to South Africa
and the risks of the Boer War. I must not, of course, give
away what I found out, especially as Major PEAcock has
more than one anxious moment in store for his readers.
But I can assure them that the war-pictures are excellent,
and do not strike one in the least as being belated, and that
the naïve style of the soldier-author adds much to the
naturalness of his pleasant story.
To the small number of those authors who can write a
readable school-story must now be added the name of Mr.
E. W. HoRNUNG, whose Fathers of Men (SMITH, ELDER)
strikes me as a more than creditable attempt at a notoriously
difficult task. One of the most obvious difficulties is the
evolution of a new

PAIN always had a genius for stripping pretenders bare of

His latest volume, Stories in Grey (WERNER LAURIE), does

the magazine story; but it contains characteristic touches
of observation and humour which make it acceptable.
There are included one or two tales of the supernatural;

I could read the other Mr. PAIN's diagnosis of him. He could

uncouthness, his mingling of diverse hereditary instincts,

all a little too obviously done from the outside. I do not
feel that the personages of the tale reveal themselves, as,
for example, the boys of Mr. DESMOND CoRE do. Mr.

WHY do I love to ply my rude goloshes
When the warm rain in February comes 2
Is it that my emotions gush
For joy of slithering through the slush,
Sprayed, heel to head, by horse-hoof sploshes,
Or that I think my feet look well in gums?
Why do I rather like those showers that soak us,
This hint of April which the damp winds waft 2
Is it that in my surging blood
.The very smell of vernal mud
Reminds me how the rising crocus
Gets through the ground much quicker when it's

Topics for which young Spring should set the tune?

Nay, none of these. Not mud nor buds nor women
Urge me to ope so rathe my joyous lung; -
It is that he whose limbs have lost -
Touch with the Ice Age loathes a frost,
Preferring puddles he can swim in
As usefully as when his heart was young.
Fast in its limbo lies my ancient “Acme,”
The steel on which my doughtiest work was done,
… When I would carve no common rings,
But curious arabesques and things—
And now my best friend wouldn't back me
To execute the homely numeral 1.
Nor would I for a moment make excursion ~.
On such an enterprise. There might occur,
Due to a rush of ribald boys,
Some outrage to my equipoise,
Possibly followed by immersion,
To dash the record of the days that were.
So, lest another cold-snap find me craven,
Too cowed to bear the happier time's recall
- !" Nessun maggior dolore"—what ?),
go to seek a guarded spot
Safe in the South, an azure haven
Where no one ever dreams of ice at all.
Thither I journey where a genial Sol lives
In permanence and not by casual spells—
An Eden through whose blesséd gates
No serpent enters in on skates,
A Paradise of pines and olives
And sea-blown airs among the Esterels. r

£10,000.
My friend the stock-broker took up the conversation:—
“It's a queer thing,” he said, “how differently different
people look at money, and what funny ways they have
for getting rid of it. Now if any one left me £10,000 I
should know what to do with it. It would run to a yacht
or a shoot or a stud of motor-cars or a new wing to the
house; or, on the other hand, I might put it into a good
thing or two, and double it or treble it, or, for the matter
of that, lose it all. It sometimes happens that way.
make something out of it. I shouldn't despise it and just
chuck it away. - *
— , ºf
“Old Joe Moggridge, however, thought differently. I
daresay some of you remember him : he used to do his bit of
stone-breaking or road-mending round about our village.
Sometimes you'd see him clipping hedges or trimming
banks or doing any sort of odd job—nothing came amiss to
him. . A rum old fellow he was—looked as if he'd been
carved out of mahogany and had never been properly
jointed. He had a pair of old-fashioned whiskers to his
cheeks and a wisp of beard sticking out from his throat,
but his chin was clean-shaved. I always wondered why he
took the trouble. It was a hard gnarled kind of face, but
the eyes were wonderful. A steely blue-grey they were,
and, I tell you, they used to shine like the head-lights of a
motor. It always gave me a queer feeling when he faced
me, just as if he were looking right through me at something
very fine and pleasant far out on the other side of my back.
“The old chap and I got to be quite friendly. I'd often
stop and have a chat with him, and sometimes I'd have a
go with him about politics; but he bested me there. He
didn't have any good to say of Conservatives or Liberals.
He thought they were both alike and all for themselves,
and there was going to be something much better some day
that was going to wipe 'em out and give the poor a chance;
and then his old eyes would begin to light up, and I'd
change the subject, not wanting to worry him.
“Well, one day he asked me if he might come and see
me at home, because he wanted to consult me about some-
thing that was troubling him. He'd got some papers, he said,
and as he wasn't a ‘scholard' he'd take it kindly if I
wouldn't mind helping him. So that evening at six o'clock
in he stepped. He wouldn't sit down—said he found it
easier standing, because his legs had got tied into knots
over the stone-breaking. ... Then he pulled out his papers.
One was a letter from a firm of solicitors in Montreal telling
him that Henry Moggridge, his brother, had recently died,
leaving all his money, amounting to something over £10,000,
to his dear brother Joseph, of Lavender Cottage, Great
Shakerley, Bucks. They added that it was all investcd in
good securities and easily realisable, and they would be glad
to do anything in their power for the fortunate legatee.
They enclosed a copy of the will, and, as far as I could see,
it was all in good order.
“‘Well,' said I, ‘you’re a lucky man, Moggridge, and
I congratulate you.' But he wouldn't have any congratu-
lations: ‘It’ll be a peck o' trouble,' he said. “What's a
man like me to do with £10,000?' If it had come forty
year ago there might 'a' bin some sense in it; but now it's
no manner o' use to me. I don't know what poor old
Harry was arter leaving me the money. He might ha'
found something better to do with it—but I suppose he
meant it kindly by me. However, there it is, Sir, and if
you'll help me to get the money we'll settle what to do
with it arterwards. I ain't goin' to keep it, that's all I
know. The old woman's dead; Tom, he got killed in South
Africa, and Jim went down with the Salamanca in the Bay
of Biscay. There's nobody else left, except me, and £10,000
is a bit of foolishness for a man o' my age.'
“To cut a long story short, I took the business in hand,
and eventually the thing was wound up and a draft for the
money came over. When I told old Joe that it was safe in
the bank and that he'd got £10,106 to his credit he didn't
But, anyhow, I should try to get something with it or
turn a hair:-Thankee, Sir," he said, as I showed him his

THE CONSOLATIONS OF AN
EX-LEADER.
THE late but brilliant incursion of
Mr. BALFour into the arena of athletics
has been the event of the winter season
at Cannes. Histriumphsasalawn tennis
player have already been chronicled by
our contemporaries, but in pastime as
in politics the Ex-Premier is nothing if
not versatile, and the following succinct
account of his further exploits will be
read with deep interest by all who
delight in the spectacle of genius at
play.
MR. BALFour BECOMEs SNAP
CHAMPION.
From our own Correspondent.
I hasten again to put the electric
current in motion to inform you that
Mr. BALFOUR last evening astonished
the English colony here by his skill and
address at Snap. In the Snap Drive
instituted in honour of Mr. BonAR LAw
Mr. BALFour was the winner, and
immediately gave a supper party to
celebrate the victory. The Rt. Hon.
gentleman has a style of play peculiar
to himself, and utters the fateful word
“Snap" with extraordinary force and
decision, in avoice totally free from every
trace of doubt, philosophic or other.
It was noticed by the other players that
Mr. BALFour's right arm, which was
bared for the struggle, bore a tattooed
design representing the historic en-
counters of RoberT BRUCE with the
Spider, surmounted by the Royal Arms
of Scotland and a portrait of BEET-
HOVEN.
MR. BALFour's SUCCESS AT Polo.
From our own Correspondent.
Mr. BALFOUR, who has become in-
defatigable in his pursuit of athletics,
to-day won golden opinions of his
dexterity as a polo player. The match
was Cambridge Quidnuncs versus Prag-
matistic Pundits, and Mr. BALFour
played for the Quidnuncs. At first the
Rt. Hon. gentleman had some difficulty
in retaining his pony between his legs,
but a taller one was quickly procured for
him. Thenceforth his career was one
steady triumph. Mr. BALFour has his
own way of playing polo, as of doing
everything else, and severe classicists
might object to his habit of striking
the other players over the head and
shoulders with his niblick, which he
prefers to the usual weapon, in his
eagerness to get possession of the ball;
but the end justifies the means, and
at the close of the game Mr. BALFour
was the only player left on the field.
A lunch party in his honour is
being given by the local Ambulance
MR. BALFour wins THE SPILLIKINs
TROPHY.
From our own Correspondent.
The famous Spillikins Trophy, the
struggle for which every February is the
very crise of the Cannes season, was
won last night by the Right Hon. A. J.
BALFour, amid scenes of unparalleled
enthusiasm. Mr. BALFOUR was at once
seen to be wearing the very latest
Spillikins rig, one of the outstanding
features of which is celluloid spats, and
his hand was of the steadiness of a
rock. It was an intensely thrilling
moment when the little fragile ivory
sticks were dropped on the table by the
judge, and Mr. BALFOUR, grasping his
ook in a manner wholly his own, with
his left leg twisted round his neck
for increased steadiness, began to pick
them out one by one. In recognition of
his success Mr. BALFOUR ordered the
Trophy, which is a magnificent gold
loving-cup, to be filled with the finest
vim ordinaire for the benefit of the
fashionable company.
MR. BALFour Los Es AT BILLIARDs.
From our own Correspondent.
Excitement at Cannes reached fever
point to-day when Mr. BALFour nearly
carried off the Billiard Handicap or-
ganised by the Grand Duke Boleslas
of Podolia. The game was 100 up,
Mr. BALFour starting from 85. At
first everything went the scratch
player's way, nice runs of 14, 11, 21,
12 and 23 resulting. Mr. BALFour,
whose style is remarkably finished and
who never uses a rest, then found his
touch, and after two brilliant misses
opened with a fine three all off the
red. This he followed with a well-
aimed shot at his opponent's ball, which
placed him hors de combat and paved
the way for a double baulk. The
scratch man failing to negotiate this,
Mr. BALFOUR compiled a clever five
(three off the red) before he broke down.
It was noticed with interest that it is
upon safety play and red losers that the
right hon. gentleman chiefly relied.
The scores were now—scratch 83; Mr.
BALFour 96; the latter, in fact, need-
ing but four to win; but to the intense
grief of the whole Colony the scratch
man ran out, and the supper party
organised in honour of the Ex-Premier
by Mrs. Massy Stroker was postponed
sine die.
MR. BALFour WINS THE EGG AND
Spoon RACE.
From our own Correspondent.
The Cannes Gymkhana, always a
popular event, attracted an enormous
crowd to-day—including visitors from
Dimbovitza, owing to the fact that Mr.
BALFOUR had entered for the egg and
spoon race. The number of entrants
was 63, and, needless to say, the Con-
servative statesman was greatly en-
couraged by the happy coincidence with
his own age. Most of the competitors
wore flannels, but Mr. BALFour ap-
peared in a suit of Harris tweed of a
yellowish tinge, chosen to harmonise
with the contents of the egg in case
they should escape his control. Of
this, however, there never was any
danger at any time, as Mr. BALFour
succeeded in giving such an undercut
to the egg with the magnificent apostle
spoon which he used that its equi.
librium was maintained throughout.
His mode of progress, again, was
thoroughly individual, being a sort of
ambling side-step, recalling that of a
famous Rugby three-quarters, which
distracted the attention of his rivals
while never impairing his own concen-
tration. On reaching the winning.
post Mr. BALFOUR was carried shoulder
high to the pavilion, and a grand
banquet was held that evening in his
honour by the Mayor and Corporation
of Nice, at which his manipulation
of the egg was favourably contrasted
with that of Columbus.

Who used to share the Master's tea
Beside the settle,

Who followed when she pinned a-row
Her flapping gowns of indigo,
And watched the apple-petals blow
With stealthy rapture,
Rehearsing in a mimic show
Some mouse's capture.

What tidings have the old wife led
Hither where oak and hazel shed
Their shadow deeper?

PUNCH, . OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CRITICISM MADE EASY.
MR. GERALD DU MAURIER has been
asking the world at large, through the
columns of The Daily Mail, wha',
qualifications a man must possess to
entitle him to become a paid critic of
art, music, literature and the drama.
As the inquiry arising out of this
boid question may lead to unhappy
disclosures regarding the lack of training
and appreciative sensitiveness among
hardened critics, let us hasten to make
known the virtues of the new CRITICis-
MogRAPH, with phonotint attachment.
It may be said at once that Mr. Edison
has had nothing whatever to do with
this.
The apparatus, neatly packed in a
morocco case, which can be easily
slipped into the tail pocket of the dress
coat, consists of the following ingenious
parts, all calculated to save enormous
expense and time in the training and
education of young critics:—
The DRAMATICRITOPHoNE, readings
from which immediately inform the
user whether the piece in progress is
drama, melodrama, comedy, light com-
edy, play-with music, musical play or
comic opera. Should no indication be
given, it may be concluded that the
piece is grand opera or farce, the dis-
tinction between these being easily
ascertained by keeping an eye upon the
orchestra.
MR. A. B. WALKLEY writes:—“I
consider this the most marvellous part
of the mechanism. When in doubt at
the Tivoli, I always pull out my little
Dramaticritophone. It has enabled
me on several occasions to separate the
serious from the gay elements in the
songs of Mr. GEORGE Robey and Miss
MARIE LLoyd.” -
The HyGRodrAMoMETER, for use only
in pathetic drama. The extraordinary
sensitiveness of this instrument to the
slightest trace of tearfulness on the
part of the house must be experienced
to be credited. Entirely unaffected by
orange-vapour or influenza.
Mr. J. BINNs, editor, printer and
publisher of The Slumpton-under-Nidd
Clarion writes:--"The Hygrodramo-
meter thoroughly justified me in the
unconventional attitude I adopted
towards the local Amateur Dramatic
Society's performance of that rollicking
farce, ‘When did Billy go Home?’”
The KINEToDRAME gives an exact
estimate of the foot-pounds of energy
employed by the artiste when speaking
or singing. Top-scores have been
registered by Mr. LEwis WALLER and
Miss CLARA BUtt.
The GALLoPHoNE enables the critic
to ascertain at a glance how far, if at
French. Quite unmoved by respectable
British situations, it responds with
startling rapidity to any symptom of
Parisian atmosphere by shooting out
the exact adjective required for purposes
of description.
Mr. W. L. CourTNEY writes: “Had
it not been for this admirable device, I
should not have dreamt of characteris-
ing Macbeth as risqué.”
The CRITARTOMobiLE is an invaluable
adjunct to the diffident art critic in the
performance of his duties. On exposing
the sensitive surface to the picture the
work of a cubist is at once indicated
by the ringing of a bell. Should the
work be fairly unintelligible, the bell
continues ringing until a lever is
pressed. If, however, the painting is
sufficiently unintelligible to be con-
sidered a masterpiece, the machine
immediately explodes.
Mr. Lewis HIND writes: “I have
burst some scores of your clever engines
already.”
The MusicRito METER is primarily
intended for the appreciation of the
modern schools of music. In the
presence of traces of BEETHoveN or
BACH a green light appears on the dial;
a red light immediately denotes the
manner of RAver, or DEBUssy, this
being followed by a general phos-
phorescence, and, on the sensitised
gramophone disc being wound up,
alternative reports from the old and
new points of view are spun out on
the tape machine attachment. This
attachment may also be used as a
mangle.
Mr. LANDoN Ron ALD writes:–“I
have sent one of your machines as a
present to Sir HENRY J. Wood.”
A combined use of the various
devices makes the complete summing
up of any work of art, from a water-
colour sketch to a pantomime, a matter
of extreme simplicity. Thus, Mr.
WINston CHURCHILL writes:– “Fascin-
ated by the variety and charm of the
invention, I set a Criticismograph
going at Belfast during my famous
oration. The result was instantaneous
and surprising. I shall never speak
without one again—anyhow, not in a
damp marquee.”
“Edgbastox RESERVoIR
SkATING THIs DAY.
To admit one person (including bathing)
7s. 6d.”—Advt. in “Birmingham Daily Post."
The bathing would, of course, be
optional. -

Saturday afternoon, when P.c. Scott ran him in.

HOW TO BUY THINGS.
(With other relevant advice.)
GoLDFISH.
When you go to buy goldfish be sure
to take some water with you. They
are delicate creatures, and seldom thrive
in brown - paper, however carefully
packed, or the trousers pocket. Gold-
fish have never been known to attack
a human being, and they make capital
pets. To the up-to-date conjurer they
are indir pensable. Never buy goldfish
at an immature age; the simple life of
an aquarium is not suited to the jeunesse
dorée.
fish is to put some acid on it; if it
turns black, don't buy it. It is pro-
bably a Birmingham fish. At the
present rate of exchange, goldfish cost
about threepence each, but a big
European war would inevitably send
the price up. The cost of breadcrumbs
must also be considered by the careful
buyer. Never buy goldfish before they
have learnt to swim, or you will be
greatly disappointed. It is quite easy
to distinguish the non-swimmers, be-
cause they float on their backs on the
surface of the water, and open and
shut their mouths. A tin of sardines
would give more pleasure than a
bowlſul of these incompetent wasters.
Remember that goldfish require amuse-
ment. If your purchases show signs
of boredom, cheer them up by placing
a pebble or two in the bowl; this will
give them something to think about.
There is nothing like a pebble to
brighten things up. At the present time
the Metropolitan Water Board make
no extra charge where goldfish are
kept, though how long this generous
policy will continue the writer is un-
able to say.
A FountAIN-PEN.
No one need be without a fountain-
pen. They are as common as coal
circulars and wrestling champions. The
guinea kinds are sold at ninepence, and
so on in proportion. To test pen, fill
it with ink and jerk it violently in
direction of shop-walker's waistcoat.
Any kind of ink will do. If he con-
tinues to solicit your custom you may
conclude that the pen is a good one.
The great advantage of fountain-pens
over other pens is that you can carry
them about with you in your waistcoat
pocket, or indeed anywhere about your
person. You can take them to bed with
you. At the dentist's you can say to
yourself, “I am all right this time!
I have my fountain-pen with me!”
Nothing matters to the man who has
a pen. And they are so handy. All
you want is a case for the pen, a box,
A very good way to test the
all, a piece has been adapted from the
a dip, a squirt thing, a pair of pliers,
Christmas time.

These will do to go on with, but a
complete outfit should include blotting-
paper, ink-eraser, and some salts of
lemon. Our grandfathers did not have
fountain-pens, poor things. But then
they were so terribly behind the times.
A SIDEBOARD.
A very good way to buy a sideboard
is to get it on the hire-purchase system.
You pay the first instalment on it, and
then the man writes to you for the
others. If he does not write, he calls.
If he forgets to write or call for six
years, the sideboard is yours. Many
young couples start in this way. The
best-known styles of sideboards are
Byzantine, Perpendicular, Fumed Oak
and Tottenham Court Road–Buses
and Tubes to all parts. Then there
are the sales, which are always worth
attending. They are generally con-
ducted by Scotchmen, and take place
in noblemen's mansions. All you have
to do is to nod your head, pay over the
money, and the sideboard is yours.
When you get it home and examine it
at your leisure, it will be the surprise
of your life. There are some sideboards
that you can only open in dry weather;
have a handy article of furniture and a
weather guide all in one. It is very
convenient. When buying a sideboard,
be careful to live in a flat that is big
enough to hold it. The writer knew a
man who had to change his flat twice
before he could get the marmalade out
of the sideboard cupboard. That sort of
thing makes marmalade unnecessarily
expensive, and the intelligent reader
of these hints is not likely to be so
improvident.
A PICTURE.
The picture buyer has an almost
unlimited range of subjects and sizes
to pick from, and they are all good.
The important point is to avoid any-
thing painted by a modern artist.
They are such rotters. Choice works
can be picked up in old cathedral towns
frequented by tourists (Americans for
choice); also Strand auction rooms.
The name is everything in the picture
world, and you cannot go wrong if

THE OTHER SIDE.
It is not a theory. It is a fact. I
have waited for trains on every plat-
form on the “Inner Circle.” The same
thing invariably happens. Two trains
arrive at and depart from the other
platform, going the other way, before
any train puts in an appearance on my
own side. I have tried it on both
sides, though not at once, of course,
and the result is always the same.
I will admit that I was in a bad
temper that day. As I purchased my
ticket I heard the brakes of a train
lulling it to rest. I missed it, of course.
Half the population of London seemed
to get out of that train and come up-
stairs at the precise moment I desired were on that side and I was on this,
to go down.
I watched two trains arrive at and
depart from the opposite platform.
I sent for the station-master.
“I desire,” I said, “to make a com-
plaint.”
He looked at me sympathetically.

“There will be no collision,” I re-

take them in the wrong direction.”
“That's all right, Sir," he said
soothingly. :
“It is not all right. It happens
every time. As sure as I wait for a
train on one side, I see two come in

| THE WATER-HAZARD.
(A tragedy of lost opportunity.)
THERE is a pond, a little pond,
Which (driving to the fourteenth pin)
DUNCAN wou'd put his ball beyond,
But Binks and I are far too fond
Of falling in.
As when the land-blown gulls rejoice
Returning to their home the sea,
So do our balls go there for choice,
And down the wind there drifts a voice
That says “Dear me.”
But lately, when the earth was bound
Under the Ice-King's iron rule,
I wandered forth in grief profound
Playing a visionary round,
And marked that pool.
No golfers circumscribed the links;
The club-house windows desolate,
Like the calm features of the Sphinx,
Gloomed o'er the void. Yes, even Binks
Had gone to skate.
All, all was pitiful and drear,
Yet, as I stood beside the trough
I wondered, “Why is no one here 2"
This is the day of all the year
For dashed good golf.

Over the earth a shining screen

THE OVERLORD.
My friend, Charles Danks, has come
into a fortune. It appears to be the
casiest thing in the world to do. All
that is necessary is to have an uncle, to
have no cousins and to sit tight. The
rest is done by the solicitor. Charles'
fortune is one of four thousand, forty
thousand, four hundred thousand or
four million pounds; I cannot say
which. All I know is that there is a
four in it somewhere; but I am told
that the noughts are more important.
Be that as it may, the pounds are
sterling, and they have produced, inter
alia, a motor car.
After a week of it, Charles came to see
me. “A friend in need,” he said, “is a
“My dear plutocrat,” I answered,
“we have been through the thin of
poverty, we will go through the thick
of wealth together. You may begin
counting now, and go on till I tell you
to stop.”
“Do you know anything about motor
cars 2" he asked.
“Do you want me to be your
chauffeur 2 " * .
“No. I want to introduce you to
him. I am going to ask you to talk to
him.” . -
I shook my head. “I know that I
have an unusually strong and dominant
character,” I said, “but I do not hold
myself out as competent to deal with a
chauffeur. I would sooner reprimand
Royalty.”
“I don't ask you to do that,” ex-
plained Charles; “I only want you to
try to win his respect. Talk to him
in his own high language; show or
pretend that you understand him ;
ask an intelligent question or two. I
have failed; but I feel that if you could
only manage to impress him a little he
might take an interest in you. Then,
when you have enlisted his confi-
dence, I want you to tell him that I am
a friend of yours, and it is just possible
that so he might be induced to put up
with me, instead of merely despising
me. He might even consult me now
and then ; and there are such a lot of
things I should like to do with the car,
if only I was allowed to.”
“Dash it all,” I expostulated, “it’s
your car.”
Charles groaned. “I am not so sure
about that.”
I was duly presented to Mr. Fitz-
gerald (we are sure that must be the
chauffeur's real name; at any rate he
deserves it); I talked to Mr. Fitzgerald;
I passed on to him all the curious
information about the Otto Cycle
which I had that very morning gleaned
from a sample of the New Dictionary
of Omniscience, very timely sent me by
way of advertisement. More especially
I listened to him intelligently, and as
a result . . . I won't say, I told Mr.
Fitzgerald, but Mr. Fitzgerald and I
agreed, to run the car to Virginia Water.
Charles was astounded at my success.
Arrived at our destination, he actually
conceived the bold idea of not going
back at once. To obtain Mr. Fitz-
gerald's further acquiescence it was
necessary for me to do some more
listening.
“My engines," he said egotistically,
“are six cylinder; my horse power 35
to 40. I reckon I could get sixty miles
an hour out of my car as easy as no
matter, and the stroke of my piston
is . . .” but I cannot repeat it. We
by detail, and in an access of enthusiasm.
I insisted upon going inside. -
“And that is an excellent rug,” I
concluded. “What about that ?”
“It is Mr. Danks' rug,” he replied,
losing interest. Nevertheless we were
allowed to stay to lunch.
After lunch, Mr. Fitzgerald was
almost affable, and Charles conceived
the impudent plan of going on further
for tea. It was left to me again to
obtain accommodation, and for this
purpose I led Mr. Fitzgerald into a
comparison of his present car with
others of his experience. I might have
succeeded but for my mistake in letting
Charles, the mere owner, be present at
the interview.
“Yes," Mr. Fitzgerald was saying,
“I prefer my good old Stepney wheel
to those detachable things. I once had
occasion to use one of them, and it
very nearly came off as we were
travelling.”
“And what matter if it had 2 " asked
Charles, expanding inopportunely into
frivolity, “there would still have been
three wheels, enough for any reason-
able man, to proceed upon.”
Mr. Fitzgerald packed us inside the
limousine, wound up the engine
hurriedly, and shot us back towards
London in disgust.
+ 7: +: :- º:
Just past Shepherd's Bush Mr. Fitz-
gerald met an equal. The cqual was
bold even for a policeman. He stood
in the middle of the Ioad and stopped
Mr. Fitzgerald in the midst of his angry
flight. He was almost at once joined
by a gentleman in a bowler hat, who
claimed to have no intimate knowledge
of the inwards of a car, but professed
to know all about speed. On this
occasion he appeared to be particularly
well informed. He opened the door
and proceeded to discuss the matte
with us. -
“Pardon me, Sir," he said, address-
ing me, “but your car has been timed
over a measured half-mile, and has
achieved the distance in forty-five
seconds. Forty miles an hour, I think,
Sir.' ..
“Very possibly you are right,” I
replied; “I am no mathematician. I
am also ashamed to confess that I am
not a motor-car owner.”
He turned to Charles. “Pardon me,
Sir, but your car has been timed
over a measured half-mile, and has
achieved. . . .”
Charles held up his hand, depre-
cating. “It is a sad story,” he said,
“but one that hardly bears repetition.

to Mr. Fitzgerald, “I think that he has
a right to hear it. I am credibly in-
friend indeed, May I count on you?”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I suspect that Mrs. Hugh FRASER is responsible for the
plot of The Satanist (Hutchinson), Mr. J. I. STAHLMANN
for the curious information, and Providence for the very
happy combination of the two. Yolanda Schiavone had
dabbled, with excuse, in the Black Mass in her past, and
was not by any means quit of that heresy when her Paolo
took her to wife. I am so lost in admiration for the
constructive ingenuity which made Paolo's (and so the
reader's) gradual introduction to the existence of Satanism
an essential to the ensuing nemesis that, with one qualm,
I forgive the slight improbability common to most stories
which hinge on a guilty secret persistently kept. The
virtue of candour might not be enough, but common pru-
dence should have been more than enough to induce
Yolanda to make a clean, early and spontaneous breast of
what she knew must come out sooner or later. This fault.
noted, I thank her for not doing so, and thereby providing
for us a most thrilling melodrama of the better and more
reasonable class. Non constat that this is a book for
promiscuous reading; there may be among the weaker
brethren some who will imbibe too voraciously the curious
information and fail to appreciate the deadly criticism
levelled at the vile thing. But for that the joint authors
cannot be blamed; their logic is as irresistible as their
demonstration is complete. In postscript, it is to be re-
marked that the gentleman who first invented “electric
torches” has conferred a boon upon the writers of modern
I suppose the Essay is the easiest thing in literature to do
badly. Like the celebrated infant, when they are good they
are very, very good, and when they are bad they are—slush.
That is why my heart goes out in admiring sympathy to
any author who has nowadays the courage to adventure a
volume of such. Mr. H. B. MARRIoTT WATson is the latest
stout-heart, with a book called, for some reason that I
can't quite fathom, Couch Fires and Primrose Ways
(KEGAN PAUL). It contains a heterogeneous collection of
papers, ranging in topic from “Death " to “The American
Woman,” and from “Stevenson” to “Midwinter," upon all
of which Mr. MARRIoTT WATson has something pleasant,
if not always very original or illuminating, to say. The
book talks, in short, as any agreeable and well-educated
companion might talk to one over the evening fire. Which
really is just what such a volume should do. The only
drawback to the interview is that it must necessarily be
one-sided. Thus I should certainly have interrupted Mr.
WATson's rambling monologue on the memorable person-
ages of R. L. S. with a reminder about Michael Finsbury,
who, in my own taste, should always head such a list.
The author appears to have forgotten him. Still, I enjoyed
listening. And his remarks upon “The Native English
Drama" contain a protest against the modern worship of
the unities, a thing that has been waiting for some time to
be said, and he has said it well.-
Tradition dies hard. Americans have a fixed idea that
all Englishmen mismanage their aitches. I have seen, in
a New York comic paper, a picture supposed to represent
t

adventure, for which they should be eternally grateful.

Upon the day when Cupid's darts
Are timed, by old and hallowed custom,
To perforate the rockiest hearts
And to his gentler ends adjust 'em ;-
Upon the day of Valentine's rotation
They met together and the row began
For which the various brawlers charge the nation
£400 per ann.
And now henceforth till crops are ripe
The Press will give them full recital
And relegate to smaller type
Topics that count as far more vital—
Things that we want to know particularly :
As, How will Mr. BROOKFIELD cut the knot 2
Will dear old CHARLIE buck at Dear Old Charlie,
Or find it harmless rot?
To kindly luck our thanks we owe
That some events which really matter
Occurred in time to get their show
Before the House began to chatter:—
Thank Heaven we'd heard of Douglas and the ashes;
We'd read the rout of HoRDERN's googly lobs;
And now no editor's blue pencil-slashes
Can prune the praise of HoBBs.
But those who deal in Culture's news
No more are free to go and spill pots
Of precious ink on authors’ views
Touching the art of EDEN PHILLPoTTs;
Even the best Society divorces
Must not usurp the acre (such it seems)
Reserved for what each Parliamentary bore says—
Reams of it, reams and reams.
What have we done, I wish to ask,
What sin that calls for castigating,
That we must read, for daily task,
These sorry bouts of shrill debating 2
Not that I do it; surely no sane creature
Within that waste of dismal verbiage delves;
Those only take it for a newsy feature
Who spoke the stuff themselves.
I may be wrong; I often fear
My country's vein is not convivial;
That she derives a curious cheer
From what is deadly dull and trivial;
If so, I also, like the politician,
May hope to please her taste from time to time;
Let others make her laws; give me permission
To build her doggrel rhyme. O. S.
“We venture to believe that we have lighted upon a possible answer,

this before much more water has passed under the bridges.”—Financier.
The position of The Financier seems fairly safe.
The Cork Constitution of the 13th inst., in its report
of Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's speech, has the following interest-
ing passage:–
“He had been trying to explain to Lord Robert Cecil that if one
got so much for four pence, one would get more than double for
ninepence. At first he thought such misrepresentation was wilful.
Not at all. (Laughter.) It was not misrepresentation. It was not

PERVERTED PUPILS.
The astonishing discovery made by Mr. Guy Livingstone,
Secretary to the Chelsea Golf School, that it is not necessary
to keep one's eye on the ball, has thrown the golfing world
into the wildest commotion, and, like most of his contem-
poraries, Mr. Punch is being inundated with correspondence
on the subject. From a perfect cataract of interesting
communications we strain off the following:—
DEAR SIR,--I am a hearty supporter of Mr. Guy Living-
STONE's scientific theory, so far as tee-shots and long play
generally are concerned. Since it is the object of the
player to get the ball away with the greatest possible speed
and with the best trajectory, it is obvious that any down-
ward external pressure upon it at the time of starting is
deleterious. The aerial vibrations set up by the retina
when glued on the sphere naturally retard its speed at the
moment of impact, and largely counteract the top spin
so essential to a good drive. Yours faithfully,
P. A. VAILE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am neither a long nor a straight
driver, but I feel obliged to enter my humble protest
against Mr. Livingston E's revolutionary tenets, so far at
least as our jolly little course at Foozleby is concerned.
What with the amazing intricacy of the “rough " on both
sides of our fairway, the high price of rubber, and the dis-
honesty of the caddies, I find that to keep my eye on the
ball the whole time, so far as is possible, is the only way to
save myself from financial ruin. Yours faithfully,
• MINUs THIRTY.
DEAR SIR,--I have always found that to keep my eye on
the ball entailed, by a natural association of ideas, getting
a hook on it as well. Yours truly, C. Leitch (Miss).
DEAR SIR,-Which eye 2 : -
Yours, etc., S. K. WINT, Westward Ho.
DEAR SIR,-Which ball 2 - ,
Yours, etc., HEAVY LUNCHER, Stoke Poges.
MY DEAR SIR,-There is not the smallest doubt that in
addressing the golf ball, the head should be held firmly as
if in a vice, and the tip of the nose pointed at an imaginary
spot on the hinder part of the globe's circumference, suitable
allowances of course being made in cases where the nasal
organ is of a retroussé or Aramaic character. The eyes do
not matter a bit. In support of my principle I am prepared
to play any ten-handicap man over thirty-six holes for
half-a-crown, rolling up my eye-balls before each stroke
until only the whites are visible, after the manner of a man
possessed by evil spirits. Yours ever,

THE GUARDING OF EDEN.
MR. EDEN PHILLPotts, having
written a play which that popular
functionary, the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN,
refused to pass in its entirety, a number
of Mr. PHILLPoTTs's fellow authors have
written to the papers expressing their
intention of performing it free, so that
the public may judge for themselves of
the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN's wisdom. An
excellent idea; and it is
to be hoped that the
passages which caused
the refusal of the licence
will be underlined in
some way, to make the
public understanding of
the situation the more
complete. They might
perhaps be prefaced by
an orchestral crash of
warning. Meanwhile,
when next a body of dis-
tinguished authors sends |
a letter to the press,
perhaps they will write
it in piquant individual
sentences rather than
with the composite pen

Then Mr. BARRIE :-
Clearly the man has no mother or he
could not be so heedless; but, be that
as it may, this puir Devonshire body

Mr. HEWLETT :—
As to the plot, a murrain on it.
That's nought. The crux is this:
Should men of genius—or approxi-
mately so—be censored by a jack-in-
office 2 There's the rub. Dramatic
man from Devonshire, who so beau-
tifully, in repeated romances, has
depicted, with admirable reiteration,
the unending misery of mankind, should
be subject, at this stage of his pros-
perous career, to the illiterate regulation
of official pedantry, this is a point on
which, with all the involutions and
commas at my disposal, I cannot insist
too clamorously.
Mr. GALsworthy :—
But it must be understood that we
have no quarrel with the Lord CHAM-
|arrogation of power that we object
to. Similarly, if in the night, any
one of us—vastly inferior to, or, at any
rate, different as we may be from, Mr.
PHILLPOTTs—should chance to throw a
boot at a cat, it would not be the cat
that we wished to criticise, but the
scheme of things which had provided
cats with a genius for nocturnal dis-
cord. Nor would the cat have reason
for resentment.
— Mr.JERONE. K. Jerome:
| So this s what we're
going to do, we other au-
thors. We're going to
give free performances of
PHILLPOTTs's stuff and
issue an invite to the
world at large.
Mr. John MASEFIELD:

Mr. ALFRED Noyes:—
As a noise annoys an
oyster and his placid
calm alloys,
So the CENson in his

fied by Noyes. -
Lastly, Mr. SHAw:—
The pleasure of defend-
ing Mr. EDEN PHILL-
Potts is a pure luxury
to me, because I am
entirely out of sympathy
with his choice of sub-
jects, his scenery and
his treatment of women.
I dislike country folk, I
hate Dartmoor, which is
one of the worst places
for motoring that I know
of, Devonshire cream
always disagrees with
me, and Devonshire was
the home of those buccaneering male-
factors who invented Imperialism,
despoiled the courteous Spaniards,
and were the spiritual progenitors of
RHoDEs and KIPLING. Then PHILL-
Potts's women are strong, masculine,
meat-eating viragoes. But all these
grounds of antipathy are as nothing
compared with the fact that his play
has been banned and therefore must be
moral, instructive and salutary. If Mr.

STORIES OF SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
IV.- THE CIVIL SERVANT's.
It was three o'clock, and the
afternoon sun reddened the western
windows of one of the busiest of
Government offices. In an airy room on
the third floor Richard 1)ale was
batting. Standing in front of the coal-
box with the fire-shovel in his hands
he was a model of the strenuous young
Englishman; and as for the third time
he turned the Government india-rubber
meatly in the direction of square-leg
and so completed his fifty the bowler
could hardly repress a sigh of en-
vious admiration. Even the reserved
Matthews, who was too old for cricket,
looked up a moment from his putting
and said, “Well played, Dick 1 " .
The fourth occupant of the room was
busy at his desk, as if to give the lie
to the thoughtless accusation that the
Civil Service cultivates the body at the
expense of the mind. The eager shouts
of the players seemed to annoy him,
for he frowned and bit his pen, or else
passed his fingers restlessly through
his hair.
“How the dickens you expect any-
one to think in this confounded moise,”
he cried suddenly. -
“What's the matter, Ashby ?”
“You're the matter. How am I going
to get these verses done for The Evening
Surprise if you make such a row 2
Why don't you go out to tea 2" -
“Good idea. Come on, Dale. You
coming, Matthews?” They went out,
leaving the room to Ashby.
In his youth Harold Ashby had
often been told by his relations that
he had a literary bent. His letters
home from school were generally pro-
nounced to be good enough for Punch,
and some of them; together with a
certificate of character from his Vicar,
were aetually sent to that paper. But
as he grew up he realised that his
genius was better fitted for work of a
more solid character. --His post in the
Civil Service gave him full leisure for
his Adam: A Fragment, his History of
| the Microscope, and his Studies in Rural
Campanology, and yet left him ample
time in which to contribute to the
journalism of the day.
The poem he was now finishing for
The Evening Surprise was his first
contribution to that paper, but he had
little doubt that it would be accepted. |
It was called quite simply, “Love and
Death,” and it began like this:
Love'
O lovel
(All other things above).-
Why,
O why,
There were six more lines which I
have forgotten, but I suppose they
gave the reason for this absurd
diffidence.
Having written the poem out neatly,
Harold put it in an envelope and took
it round to The Evening Surprise. The
strain of composition, had left him
rather weak, and he decided to give
his brain a rest for the next few days.
So it happened that he was at the
wickets on the following Wednesday
afternoon when the commissionaire
brought him in the historic letter. He
opened it hastily, the shovel under his
arm. . . .
“Dear Sir," wrote the editor of The
Surprise, “will you come round and
see me as soon as convenient 2 ''
Harold lost no time. Explaining
that he would finish his innings later,
he put his coat on, took his hat and
stick, and dashed out. -
“How do you do?” said the editor.
“I wanted to talk to you about your
work. We all liked your little poem
very much. It will be coming out
to-morrow.”
“Thursday,” said Harold helpfully.
“I was wondering whether we
couldn't get you to join our staff.
Does the idea of doing Aunt Miriam's
Cosy Corner in our afternoon edition
appeal to you at all?”
“No,” said Harold. “Not a bit.”
“Ah, that's a pity.” He tapped
his desk thoughtfully. “Well then,
how would you like to be a war
correspondent? -
“Very much,” said Harold. “I was
considered to write rather good letters
home from school.” -
“Splendid There's this little war
in Mexico. When can you start 2 All
expenses and fifty pounds a week.
You're not very busy at the office, I
suppose, just now?”
“I could get sick leave easily
enough,” said Harold, “if it wasn't for
more than eight or nine months.”
“Do; that will be excellent. Here's
a blank cheque for your outfit. Can
you get off to-morrow? But I suppose
you'll have one or two things to finish
up at the office first?”
“Well,” said Harold cautiously, “I
was in, and I'd made ninety-six. But
if I go back and finish my innings now,
and then have to-morrow for buying
things, I could get off on Friday.”
“Good,” said the editor. “Well,
here's luck. Come back alive if you
can, and if you do we shan't forget you.”
Harold spent the next day buying
a war correspondent's outfit –the
camel, the travelling bath, the putties,
the pith helmet, the quinine, the sleep-
ing-bag, and the thousand-and-one
the Friday his colleagues at the office
came down in a body to Southampton to
see him off. Little did they think that
nearly a year would elapse before he
again set foot upon England.
I shall not describe all his famous
coups in Mexico. Sufficient to say that
experience taught him quickly all that
he had need to learn; and that whereas
he was more than a week late with his
cabled account of the first engagement
of the war he was frequently more than
a week early afterwards. Indeed the
battle of Parson's Nose, so realistically
described in his last telegram, is still
waiting to be fought. It is to be hoped
that it will be in time for his aptly-
named book, With the Mericans in
Merico, which is coming out next
month. " …
On his return to England Harold
found that time had wrought many
changes. To begin with, the Editor of
The Evening Surprise had passed on ,
to The Morning Ecclamation. -
“You had better take his place,” said
the ducal proprietor to Harold. º
“Right,” said Harold.
I shall have to resign my post at the
office?” *
“Just as you like. I don't see why
you should.” i
“I should miss the cricket,” said
Harold wistfully, “and the salary.
I'll go round and see what I can
arrange.” i
But there were also changes at the
Harold had been rising steadily
office.
in salary and seniority during his
absence, and he found to his delight
that he was now a Principal Clerk.
He found too that he had acquired
quite a reputation in the office for
quickness and efficiency in his new
work. .
The first thing to arrange about was
his holiday. He had had no holiday
for more than a year, and there were
some eight weeks owing to him. º
“ Hullo,” said the Assistant Secre-
tary as Harold came in, “you're looking
well. I suppose you manage to get
away for the week-ends?” :
“I’ve been away on sick leave for
some time,” said Harold pathetically.
"Have you? You've kept it very
secret. Come out and have lunch with
me, and we'll do a matinée afterwards.”
Harold went out with him happily.
It would be pleasant to accept the
editorship of The Evening Surprise
without giving up the Governmental
work which was so dear to him, and
the Assistant Secretary's words made
this possible, for a year or so anyhow.
Then, when his absence from the office
first began to be noticed, it would be
time to think of retiring on an adequate

HOW TO BUY THINGS.
A RAILwAY TICKET.
Railway tickets can be purchased at
all prices and, like CLEOPATRA, they are
of infinite variety. Each to his taste,
therefore. Those coloured white cost
most. Keen buyers used to favour
Weston-super-Mare (4/6), Brighton
(half-a-dollar), and Southend (purely
nominal sum); these prices are now
out-of-date, to be sure, but there is no
harm in mentioning them. Persons of
leisure have been known to buy tickets
to Folkestone and Herne Bay. It all
depends on your class of life. The
worst of buying railway tickets is, you
have to pay cash for them. Booking-
clerks are not a bit like tailors in this
respect: they book nothing. On the
contrary, they take a sour view of life.
The compiler of these hints once offered
a booking-clerk an electric lamp and a
recipe for catching rats in exchange for
a shilling ticket. Just a twelve-mile
He refused to part, and he couched his
refusal in terms which were the reverse
of affable. And the writer walked
home—twelve miles. On the other
hand, it sometimes happens that you
can get a twopenny ticket for a penny
out of an automatic machine. True,
this does not happen often ; but the
mere possibility of its occurring adds a
fresh zest to life.
A HAT.
This is obviously a very important
subject for the shopper's consideration,
for nearly all of us have to buy a hat
at some time or other. The people
who don't wear hats are people who
never buy anything—except nuts, and
fret-saws, and things like that.
ing a hat, therefore, is not a labour of
love; it is one of the elemental obliga-
tions of our human existence.
Hatters are notoriously mad, so go
armed, and stand no nonsense. If he
shows you, a green velvet thing with a
bow at the back, draw on him at once;
you will have rendered a public service.
If possible, get a hat that fits. It is
true that Nature, foreseeing and bounti-
ful, has provided us with ears in order
to keep our hats at a suitable elevation;
but it is better, in the long run, to get
a hat that will keep up of its own
accord. It is quite easy, after all. If
the hat makes your nose bleed it is too
small; if it makes your ears ache it is
too large. Bear this formula in mind,
and you cannot go far wrong. Then
there are women's hats. The right way
to buy a hat, if you are a woman, is to
take a friend with you, have a simple
lunch, talk it over in the Silence Room,

tea, complete purchase of hat, and send
it back next day if it does not suit.
Some very Smart Women keep hats
that they can't wear two or three
weeks before sending them back. That
is what makes female hatters mad.
A SUIT of CLOTHEs.
Next to a wedding ring, a suit of
clothes is the most important purchase
a man can make. You should exercise
great care, therefore, before taking the
final plunge, and it is worth while
to consult some reliable authority.
CARLYLE has written a book on the sub-
ject which every Man. About Town
should study. The Sunday papers, too,
publish articles on Sartorial matters,
and should be carefully filed by dressy
men. If money is no object, go to a
him either, so you will both be satis-
fied—for a time, at any rate. Another
way to dress economically is to send a
postal order to some man who sells
clothes on the instalment plan. After
one postal order you can go and kive
in South America. The effect to aim
at, in matters of dress, is the happy
medium between untidiness and undue
brilliance. Trousers should always have
a crease down the front, though it is only
fair to say that many well-known men
(JULIUS CAESAR and WILLIAM TELI, are
two names that occur to one) have been
notoriously careless in this respect:

House of Commons, Valentine's Day.
—So much obliged to Mr. HoggE, just
returned for East Edinburgh. One
of our youngest Members, he has
established precedent which, to certain
extent, cheers BoSNER LAW in his

tion. Some men would have been
upset by embarrassment accompany-

In Mr. Hogg|E's case what

It was LYELL “began it,” as

WHAT MR. ROGERS THINKS.
[A Mr. Rogers (U.S.A.) proposes that, as an assistance to the other
sex, every bachelor should be compelled to wear a badge.]
ATTEND to the words of the eminent Rogers,
The fruit of whose wonderful brain
Would doom the most artful of masculine dodgers
To ply his devices in vain.
How often a maiden's affairs have miscarried
And come to a desperate hitch
For want of a line between single and married,
Distinguishing t'other from which.
She may have been wooing with earnest intentions
A youth of most promising sort,
When, just at the crisis, the gadabout mentions
A wife who's his only support.
Moreover, the swain she's been ardently plying
Can always escape from the lure
By saying he's married—he's probably lying,
But how can the lady be sure?
It's hard to be wasting her time on a quarry
That proves in the end but a rat;
It's all very well to explain that he's sorry,
But what does she get out of that?
And Rogers, aghast at this sad situation,
Would stamp on each unmarried man
Some brand, or a means of identification—
But, oh, Mr. Rogers (I take it you're wedded),
Whatever your daughters may say,
Beware, I implore you, of getting light-headed,
And don't you be carried away.
f
Those ladies, no doubt, with their excellent mother,
Combine to consider alone
The sex that they honour; but is there no other ?
O traitor, reflect on your own.
The man who is not by profession a rover,
Whose views on the holier state
Are limited mainly to thinking it over,
Has done pretty well up to date.
But though, given care and attention, he's able
To order his ways with success,
To stick the man up in the mart with a label
Is asking for trouble, no less.
Your scheme may be subtle; but, once you begin it,
As sure as he's known by his marks,
A bachelor 'd never be safe for a minute
(Apart from occasional larks). DUM-DUM.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE FIRE SCREEN."
MR. SUTRo must have been asleep for
twenty years; so only can I account
for his beautiful innocence. Much has
happened to the drama in the last two
decades, but it has missed Mr. SUTRo.
He is still ingenuous enough to be
pleased with the play of intrigue; he
still thinks that no woman can set foot
in a bachelor's flat without being com-
promised for ever. Innocent Mr. SUTRo!
How shocked he will be when he hears
of the suffragettes |
Oliver Hadden was innocent too;
but then he was a stage scientist and
man of genius, and such men are always
innocent. He was so innocent that he
failed to see through his wife's cousin,
Angela, notoriously wicked woman as
she was, when she set herself to make
love to him. Martha Hadden had no
| illusions, of course; and she thought of
| an elaborate plan (the dear!) for making
everything come right in the Fourth
She asked Horace Travers down,
no, not herself this time ; no, there are
limits even to the naïveté of the eighties
| —she persuaded him to make love to
| Angela. She hoped to keep Angela
away from her husband by this means;
but alas, the plan miscarried. A second
| plan had hastily to be formed. Horace
would ask Angela to his rooms, and
! Martha would see to it that Oliver dis-
covercd them together.

“THE EASIEST WAY.”
I don't know if American ideas of
honour differ from ours, or whether it
is just that, like other things, they lose
all sense of consistency when they find
themselves on the stage. Here, for
instance, is Brockton, a patron of the
drama, whose method it is to induce
managers to dispense with the service
of an actress in order that she may be
forced to come under his protection.
In this way he has secured Laura
Murdock for his mistress. But, before
the play starts, she has, like the lady in
He Who I’assed, met with a man
(Madison) who wants to marry her; but
with this difference, that he is con-
versant with the lurid character of
her career. She begs Brockton to let
her off. He consents, but warns
Madison that, while waiting for him
to become eligible, she will miss the
luxuries to which she has become
habituated, and, as a struggling actress,
may easily relapse. In that con-
tingency he promises to keep the
hero au courant with the facts. So
Laura takes up her work in New York,
loses her part, and is reduced to the
extremities of poverty. At this point
Brockton, who no doubt has been assist-
ing his own prophecies to verify them-
selves, intervenes and offers to relieve
her on the old terms. She reluctantly
consents. Instead of writing to tell
Madison of the restoration of the entente,
he prefers a more improbable course
of action and makes Laura take
down from dictation a letter to
her lover, informing him that
she has no further use for him.
In a spasm of reaction she burns
the letter. Meanwhile Madison
has struck metal in Colorado,
and comes to claim her.
Brockton, on discovering that
the letter was never posted, is
furious at the outrage done to
his reputation as a gentleman of
his word. He has been made
a liar in the eyes of Madison.
He will therefore expose her.
Such, it would seem, are the
niceties of American honour–
on the stage.
Madison, I need hardly say,
proposes to shoot him at sight;
but Laura objects to this. She
will commit suicide instead.
“Commit it, then,” says he,
and calls in a coloured slavey
to witness the discharge of the
pistol, so that nobody can say
that he has done it. Laura
gives the matter her full con-
sideration, and then thinks
better of it ; and Madison
leaves her for ever, after a brief

habit of always choosing “the easiest
way.”
The other Acts had been received
surprisingly well, but this gloomy
solution seemed to offend the gods.
Possibly the ending may have to be
made happier. This would only neces-
sitate a slight modification of the title,
which might be changed to “The
Easiest Way Out.”
Miss SARAH BRookE as Laura had a
very heavy part, being always there or
in the next room; and she played with
unsparing energy. She has, of course,
a charm of her own, but it is not
perhaps quite the peculiar charm that
was needed to give the right attraction
to this character. If she had not from
time to time shown an unconscious
staginess and a good deal of stocking,
I might never have recognised her pro-
ſession. Mr. GUY STANDING (Brockton)
acted with an easy aplomb. It was
not his fault that, having started out as
a fairly reasonable type of rascal, he
should have had to serve the purpose
of the author (Mr. WALTER) by
developing into an unspeakable brute,
on a plea of punctilio. Try as he
would, he could not convince us that
his honour was capable of sustaining
any severe damage.
As for Mr.GoDFREY TEARLE(Madison)
he was away most of the time in Col-
orado, and I imagine that the unre-
strained life of a mining-camp suited
him best. He had good moments, but
he is really meant for a gallery-hero.
He should never be allowed to be
anything but the soul of chivalrous
generosity. Mr. O. B. CLARENCE played
pleasantly in a part that didn't matter.
| The clow of the evening was the de-
lightful performance of Miss NELsoN
HALL in the character of Elfie St. Clair,
a child of freedom and a friend of Laura's
in the old days, who comes to cheer her
poverty and to weaken the resolutions
of virtue with an object-lesson on the
advantages of the looser life.
One naturally wishes success to Miss
SARAH BRookE in her first trial of
management. But when Londoners
hear that a play has had a wide suc-
cess in America they have their mis-
givings. The States are so easily
pleased. This time it can hardly have
been the humour of the piece that did
it, for the things at which our first
night's audience laughed loudest were
those exotic phrases which would
escape the notice of anybody familiar
with the American language. O. S.

DID SHAKSPEARE PLAY
FOOTBALL }
OR, TO PLEASE ALL PARTIES,
WAS BACON A SPORT 2
ALThough SHAKSPEARE only makes
one direct reference to the football
player, a close study of his plays has
convinced us that he himself followed
the game. -
His one allusion to a footballer is in
itself strong evidence of this. “Base
football player” are the words he uses
in King Lear, Act I., Scene 4. The
reference is probably to foul play–on
the other side.
But if this example fails to carry
conviction, we can find confirmatory
evidence everywhere throughout the
plays. In Hamlet, Act III., Scene 3,
for instance, occur the words “trip
lim,” which, to have their full value,
should be read in conjunction with
Twelfth Night, Act I., Scene 3, where
we find the frank confession, “I have
the back trick.”
This confession brings us to the
consideration of SHAKSPEARE as a
player. When he talks of “the virtue
of a good wing" (All's Well that Ends

learned the back trick against forwards
of merit; and we know him at once as
a back of the robust, stick-at-nothing
school (“not nice but full of charge":
Iłomeo and Juliet, Act V., Scene 2),
when in the first part of Henry IV.,
Act V., Scene 1, we read that “nothing
can seem foul to those that win.”
Of the team for which he played
all we know with any certainty is
that it was famous for its striking one which issued from the spout of the
and artistic colours. For SHAKSPEARE
was too good a partisan to intend the
phrase “Heavenly harnessed team ” in
Henry IV., Part I., Act III., Scene 1,
to refer to any opposing eleven.
It would almost seem that on one
occasion at least the poet was to be
found keeping goal, but that was prob-
ably only in a friendly match not taken
too seriously. Perhaps it was at a stage
fête. At any rate, “the net has fallen
upon me.” (Henry VIII., Act I., Scene
1) suggests a practical joke or faulty
materials such as would never be
tolerated in a League contest.

When two people fall in love, and one of them is a
Catholic and the other is not, the safer and more prudent
plan is, I am told, for each to start again and fall in love
with somebody else. But in the case of Evodia Essex
and Felix Scaife inquiries had elicited that both were of
the same Protestant faith, and it was considered right to
proceed. I do not think those inquiries can have been
very searching, or it would have transpired that the belief
of Felic was very wobbly. Certainly, it was easily reversed
in less than a week, and reversed to such good purpose
that he deserted his love for a whole fortnight in order to
become better acquainted with his new religion, and that
without warning or explanation almost on the eve of their
wedding-day. The call being assumed to be a right call

The story is once more a very pleasant love-tale, with an
element of mystery not too terribly dark for the reader's
intelligence to unravel; but I could have wished that the
promise of rivalry between the two extremely eligible suitors
for the hand of Clarice had been maintained. As it is, the

And neither knew that the other.
Had died of a broken heart.

A Fascinating. Pastime for the Winter
Evenings.
Try it to-night.
“Numenes” (i.e. New Meanings) is the
title given to a game which is exciting
the greatest enthusiasm in intellectual
circles. It can perhaps best be de-
scribed by means of example. Take
the letters N, E, S, W, which are
always to be seen on wind vanes. They
indicate the four points of the compass
(North, East, South and West), but
with a little ingenuity one can easily
apply “Numenes” to them. Thus one
might say:— - -
Never Employ Sultry Words.
Or, again, keeping the letters in the
same order, but commencing with E:—
Eat Sparingly When Ninety.
Other “Numenes,” beginning respec-
tively with the letters S and W are:—
Sow Wurzels Near Easter.
Warble Nicely Every Sabbath.
The game can also be played in
French. The letters S. V. P. can thus
be made to represent the exhortation
“Soyez Vraiment Poli.” It could
doubtless be done in German but for
the fact that the only member of the
staff acquainted with that language is
on his holidays.

counted for by the rotation of the earth

THE final test match opened to-day
in fine weather. An interesting novelty
was introduced into the game, each
batsman being compelled to use, to
defend his wicket, some article from his
travelling bag, in accordance with the
claim put forward by several admirers
of WARNER's XI. that it is not necessary
for an England player to use a bat
in order to keep the ball off the
wicket. RHoDEs, who compiled a neat
59 with his hairbrush, was loudly
cheered, as was HoBBs, who, using his
Thermos flask, gave a perfect display,
including all his best strokes. It is some
evidence of his activity that, on his
arrival at the pavilion, the milk, which
flask, had become cheese. Foster, who,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
STORIES OF SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
V.—THE Actor's.
MR. LEviNski, the famous actor-
manager, dragged himself from beneath
the car, took the snow out of his mouth,
and swore heartily. Mortal men are
liable to motor accidents; even kings'
cars have backfired; but it seems
strange that actor-managers are not
specially exempt from these occurrences.
Mr. Levinski was not only angry; he
was also a little shocked. When an
actor-manager has to walk two miles
to the nearest town on a winter
evening one may be pardoned a doubt
as to whether all is quite right with
the world.
But the completest tragedy has its
compensations for someone. The piti-
able arrival of Mr. Levinski at “The
Bull's Head,” unrecognised and with
his fur coat slightly ruffled, might make
a sceptic of the most devout optimist,
and yet Eustace Merrowby can never
look back upon that evening without
a sigh of thankfulness; for to him it
was the beginning of his career. The
story has often been told since—in
about a dozen weekly papers, half-a-
dozen daily papers and three dozen
provincial papers—but it will always
bear telling again.
There was no train to London that
night and Mr. Levinski had been com-
pelled to put up at “The Duke's Head.”
However, he had dined and was feel-
ing slightly better. He summoned the
manager of the hotel.
“What does one do in this dam
place?” he asked with a yawn.
The manager, instantly recognising
that he was speaking to a member of
the governing classes, made haste to
reply. “Othello” was being played at
the town theatre. His daughter, who
had already been three times, told him
that it was very fascinating. He was
sure his lordship. . . .
Mr. Levinski dismissed him, and con-
sidered the point. He had to amuse
himself with something that evening,
and the choice apparently lay between
“Othello” and the local Directory.
He picked up the Directory. By a
lucky chance for Eustace Merrowby it
was three years old. Mr. Levinski put
on his fur coat and went to see
“Othello.”
For some time he was as bored as he
had expected to be, but halfway through
the Third Act he began to wake up.
There was something in the playing of
the principal actor which moved him
strangely. He looked at his programme.
“Othello–MR. EUSTACE MEI, Row BY.”
Mr. Levinski frowned thoughtfully,
“Merrowby ?” he said to himself. “I
I want.” He took out the gold pencil
presented to him by the Emperor—
(the station-master had had a tie-pin)
—and wrote a note.
He was finishing breakfast next
morning when Mr. Merrowby was
announced. -
“Ah, good morning,” said Mr. Levin-
ski, “good morning. You find me
very busy,” and here he began to turn
the pages of the Directory backwards
and forwards, “but I can give you a
moment. What is it you want?”
“You asked me to call on you,” said
Eustace.
“Did I, did I ?” He passed his hand
across his brow with a noble gesture.
“I am so busy, I forget. Ah, now I
remember. I saw you play Othello last
night. You are the man I want. I
am producing ‘Oom Baas,' the great
South African drama, next April, at my
theatre. Perhaps you know?”
“I have read about it in the papers,”
said Eustace. In all the papers (he
might have added) every day, for the
last six months.
“Good. Then you may have heard
that one of the scenes is an ostrich
farm. I want you to play ‘Tommy.’”
“One of the ostriches 2" asked
Eustace.
“I do not offer the part of an ostrich
to a man who has played Othello.
Tommy is the Kaffir boy who looks
after the farm. It is a black part,
like your present one, but not so long.
In London you cannot expect to take
the leading parts just yet.”
“This is very kind of you,” said
Eustace, gratefully. “I have always
longed to get to London. And to start
in your theatre l—it's a wonderful
chance.”
“Good,” said Mr. Levinski. “Then
that 's settled.” He waved Eustace
away and took up the Directory again
with a business-like air.
And so Eustace Merrowby came to
London. It is a great thing for a
young actor to come to London. As
Mr. Levinski had warned him, his new
part was not so big as that of Othello;
he had to say “Hofo tsetse !”—which
was alleged to be Kaffir for “Down,
Sir!”—to the big ostrich. But to be at
the St. George's Theatre at all was an
honour which most men would envy
him, and his association with a real
ostrich was bound to bring him before
the public in the pages of the illus-
trated papers.
Eustace, curiously enough, was not
very nervous on the first night. He
was fairly certain that he was word-
perfect; and if only the ostrich didn't
kick him in the back of the neck—as it
had tried to once at rehearsal—the
for him. And so it was with a feeling
of pleasurable anticipation that, on the
morning after, he gathered the papers
round him at breakfast, and prepared
to read what the critics had to say.
He had a remarkable Press. I give
a few examples of the notices he ob-
tained from the leading papers:—
“Mr. Eustace Merrowby was
Tommy.”—Daily Telegraph.
“The cast included Mr. Eustace
Merrowby.”—Times.
“. . . Mr. Eustace Merrowby . . .”
Daily Chronicle.
“We have no space in which to
mention all the other performers.”—
Morning Leader.
“This criticism only concerns the
two actors we have mentioned, and
does not apply to the rest of the cast.”
—Sportsman.
“Where all were so good it would
be invidious to single out anybody for
special praise.”—Daily Mail.
“The acting deserved a better play.”
—Daily News.
“. . . Tommy . . .”—Morning Post.
As Eustace read the papers he felt
that his future was secure. True, The
Era, careful never to miss a single per-
former, had yet to say, “Mr. Eustace
Merrowby was capital as Tommy,”
and The Stage, “Tommy was capitally
played by Mr. Eustace Merrowby”;
but even without this he had become
one of the Men who Count—one whose
private life was of more interest to the
public than that of any scientist,
general or diplomat in the country.
Into Eustace Merrowby's subsequent
career I cannot go at full length. It
is perhaps as a member of the Garrick
Club that he has attained his fullest
development. All the good things of
the Garrick which were not previously
said by SYDNEY SMITH may safely be
put down to Eustace; and there is no
doubt that he is the ringleader in all
the subtler practical jokes which have
made the club famous. It was he who
pinned to the back of an unpopular
member of the committee a sheet of
paper bearing the words
K I C K M E
—and the occasion on which he drew
the chair from beneath a certain
eminent author as the latter was about
to sit down is still referred to hilariously
by the older members.
Finally, as a convincing proof of his
greatness, let it be said that everybody
has at least heard the name “Eustace
Merrowby.”—even though some may
be under the impression that it is the
trade-mark of a sauce; and that half
the young ladies of Wandsworth
Common and Winchmore Hill are in
love with him. If this be not success,
don't know the name, but he's the man

A PRELIMINARY PRATTLE
WITH
LADY PRECIOSA PIPKIN.
(In the fearless manner of “The Daily
Chronicle.”) -
To enter the library in Arlington
Street where Lady Preciosa Pipkin
writes and reads is indeed a privilege
which an ordinary journalist can hardly
taste without fainting from sheer
ecstasy. One is reminded alternately
of CoRINNA and MARIE CoRELLI, of
Madame DE STAïr, and Madame SARAH
GRAND. The atmosphere of the room is
| charged with pastoral serenity, and
Lady Preciosa's voice, the ethereal tones
of which remind one of harp harmonics,
helps to enhance the illusion.
When I commented on this she
smiled an exquisite smile and observed :
“People think I live out of the º
and often tell me so; yet, all the same,
life, I think, is a terrible rush. Even
some of our bishops have recently
rushed to Russia and back again. . .
But I fear that I am in a minority,
having always been a very unrushful
person. Rapid locomotion is always
distasteful to me, and I would infinitely
rather be a tortoise than a hare.
Indeed, I think that in a previous
existence I must have been a tree, for
I have roots and move them with great
difficulty.” -
Lady Preciosa would have made an
ideally lovely Hamadryad, and I
longed to tell her so, but, after all, the
object of my visit was not to discuss
her previous existence but her forth-
coming book, The Silver Satchel.
“How did The Silver Satchel come
to be written ? Well, on the principle
that silence is golden, I hit upon the
epithet “silver' as appropriate to the
outpourings of my pen. “Satchel,' you
sce, 'Yegins, like “silver,' with an ‘S.'
It is simply a commonplace book
filled with extracts culle ºf om variºus
sources and supplemented with a few
pieces of my own.”
The Satchel which Lady Preciosa
Pipkin so modestly describes as a
commonplace book contains many rare
and radiant effusions from her own
gifted pen. Extracts of which the
source is unknown are marked by one
:star, as distinguished from two stars
which indicate anonymity, three stars
which are affixed to pieces of a spirited
and convivial type, and forty-two stars
which indicate an American origin.
But Lady Preciosa, though so
generous in admitting other writers to
her Silver Satchel, is nothing if not
original, as the following intensely
interesting obiter dicta clearly show:—

LIFE AND ROMANCE.
THE function of the novelist is less to
invent a new and non-existent life than
to collect actual incidents of life as it is
lived, to place these in a juxtaposition
which they did not previously enjoy,
and to draw the deduction. For the
several incidents of actual life as it is,
one turns instinctively to the several
columns of The Daily Mail; to achieve
the juxtaposition, one has only to take
a pair of scissors, to cut out and up the
columns, to mix judiciously the frag-
ments, and there you are. Avoid, of
course, such side issues as Coal Crises
and political happenings, and confine
yourself to the more important chit-
chat about Leap Year and the Telephone
Trouble. If you had done this this
week, this would have been the correct
result :-

House of Commons, Monday, Feb-

same college at Oxford, in succession

day, Dizzy thanked Heaven, since it
separated him from GLADSTONE in one
of his fits of oratorical fury.
It was F. E.'s first speech delivered
with advantage of accessories of Front

ance there recalls a story not generally
known, which redounds to his credit,
and rebukes familiar sneer at the
moral and intellectual adaptability of
the barrister working his way in
House of Commons. Two sessions
ago, at personal invitation of PRINCE
ARTHUR, F. E. quitted his accus-
tomed place behind his Leaders and,
using the phrase in the Parliamentary
sense, “took silk” and a seat on Front
Bench. After a while it was observed
that he had returned to his former
quarters. Much inquiry into the why
and wherefore, but no explanation
Fact is F. E. differing from his

from dying in the last ditch in opposi-

WINsoME WINston since he genially
backed up the WAR MINISTER’s mission
of peace to Berlin by describing the
German Fleet as a luxury, a sort of extra
glass of beer or a superfluous pipe.
Whilst on his own part he lays low and
says comparatively nuffin' he finds him-
self to-day in both Houses dragged into
what BonneR describes as the “lime-
light.” In the Lords, CAMPERDow N
moves for return of military and civil
forces specially detached to Belfast in
connection with his recent visit and the
cost thereby incurred. '
CAMPERDown expressed regret at
absence, through illness, of Lord PIRRIE,
chairman of WINstoN's meeting. He
would therefore, he said, abstain from
making certain remarks. Amid buzz
of approval of this generous conduct
he continued: “Any one who knows
Belfast as Lord PIRRIE knows it, and
who allowed his name to be used as
Chairman of the Ulster Liberal Associa-
tion, incurred a very culpable, indeed an
almost criminal responsibility.”
Pondering over this remark, made
under restraining circumstances deli-
cately alluded to, noble Lords wondered
what CAMPDERDown would have said
had PIRRIE been present in his habitual
state of bounding health. -
In the Commons shower of Questions
on same subject rained on Treasury
Brench. SEELY boldly asserted that
the right of free speech must be safe-
guarded at any cost. This sentiment
visibly affected WINTERTON, whom
everyone is glad to see back from his
trip to South Africa in fully restored
health. - -
“Bayonets' bayonets!” the Noble
Earl shouted, waving his right arm as
if he were charging at head of his
regiment.
As far as relevancy is concerned
might as well have shouted, “Pickles!
Pickles' "
That other man of war, MooRE of
orth Armagh, took more practical view
of situation. When SEELY, repeating
statement made in other House by
HALDANE, said cost of the entertainment
amounted to £2,700, to be borne on the
Army Estimates, North ARMAGH rapidly
scribbled some notes on his copy of
Orders of the Day. Seizing opportunity
for interposing, he asked if UNDER
SECRETARY was aware that the estimate
worked out at about 15/- a word of
WINstoN's speech 2
Purists might say this was taking
Minister and the House at unfair
disadvantage. North ARMAGH had
worked out his sum. No one had op-
portunity of testing accuracy of his
statement of result. Would have been
just the same had he put cost down at
seemed a lot of money. ... If speech ran
into silver at this rate silence certainly
would be golden. SEELY sheered off
with lame excuse to effect that if, when
GENERAL CARson, K.C., visited Dublin
it had been necessary to make similar
effort to ensure him the right of free
speech, equal cost would have been
met. Everyone felt that North
ARMAGH had the best of it.

of all additional appointments made in

AT THE PLAY.
“THE • MIND THE PAINT’ Girl.”
HAviNG missed the first night per-
formance, when the occupants of the
gallery appear to have misbehaved
themselves, I can only vaguely guess
what it was in the play that disturbed
their Olympian calm. It may pos-
sibly have pained them to find Sir
ARTHUR PINERo trying to disillusionize
their innocence as to the vie intime
of the musical comedy ladies from
the “Pandora.” The very name “Pan-
dora.” may have been an offence,
reminding them, as it would, of the
mythical female who had all gifts
bestowed on her for the express pur-
pose of bringing ruin on the human
race. -
Personally, I could not discover that
the author had any particular object,
sinister or elevative, in writing his play.
Sir WING is, of course, too old a bird to
be snared into pointing a moral or
allowing his tale to be adorned with
the salt of a serious purpose. . With a
nicely balanced detachment he per-
mitted his persona, according to their
respective tastes and experience, to
abuse or defend the character of these
girls. One said that they were design-
ing minxes, another that they performed
a useful part in the social order by in-
troducing fresh blood into the pallid
veins of an effete aristocracy. The
author tried to portray the type dis-
passionately, neither making it too
sordidly vulgar nor presenting it in
that atmosphere of glamour which is
the despair of dowagers. Yet he
showed himself a moralist malgré lui,
for dulness is the most damning vice
of all, and the ladies were, frankly, a
rather dull lot.
I have read so much of the marvel
of Sir ARTHUR's stagecraft that I was
rightly shocked at the crude arrange-
ment by which, in a scene which
would naturally have been crowded
during the dance intervals, a solitary
couple would enter, do its little turn,
and go out, to give place to another in
strict rotation. Even when the stage-
craft was good, one was often conscious
of the medium. Nobody supposed for
a moment that a man like young Lord
Farncomle, so hesitant about his
own claims, and so sacrificial in
his homage of the “Mind the Paint”
girl, would have chosen the hour of
4 A.M., and a situation that offered
every sort of embarrassment, to offer
her his heart and prospective coronet;
nor could anybody suppose that a
girl like Lily, thoroughly hardened to
flattery, would be melted to wax for
love of a man on the strength of a
everyone could appreciate that, as we
were getting to the end of the Third
Act, it was essential, for stage purposes,
that something definite should be done,
and done at once, if matters were to be
got ripe in time for the final Act.
It was unfortunate too that one
of the leading characters, Captain
Nicholas Jeyes, was a figure straight
out of stageland; and that Mr. ALLAN
AYNEsworth's interpretation of the
part, clever as it was, seemed to con-
tribute to its staginess. The most
effective Act—the Third—was spoiled
by the unbelievableness of this man's
conduct. It was incredible that “an
officer and a gentleman" should throw
ON WITH THE OLD LOVE, BEFORE BEING OFF
WITH THE NEW.

off, for the better enlightenment of
his rival, that long and pitiless tirade
against the girl they both loved, before
her very face. Something like the same
error of judgment was shown when
another officer and gentleman, who had
married a Pandora star in the old days
and had led a dog's life of it, seized the
occasion of a dance to which he had
brought his wife to warn Farm.combe
against the peril of making a similar
ass of himself.
But my chief complaint is still that
the author was not nearly so funny
as he might have been. True, the
humour of Miss CLARE GREET as Mrs.
Upjohn was always delightful, and Mr.
NigFL PDAYFAIR as a Semitic patron of
musical comedy was most attractive;
and Miss NINA SEVENING as one of
the Pandora Girls was admirable in
tion; but the rest of the gaiety was
rather effervescent than exhilarating.
As for Miss MARIE Löhr, the trouble
is that she has a particular charm so
personal to herself that, when she is
playing any º but the very nicest,
either she fails to convince me, or else
I resent the fact that she of all people
should have been asked to play it. I
am conscious here of both these effects.
When Lily is required in a fit of anger
to throw off her carefully adjusted
veneer and expose her inherent vul-
garity, I am not persuaded that any-
thing of the kind really occurs, and
yet I am annoyed that Miss MARIE
LöHR should have been called on to
make the attempt. Her vivacity, her
warm-heartedness, her generous re-
morse, sudden as the outbursts for
which it makes amends—all these
were a delight; but there are things
which by the very sweetness of her
nature she was never meant to be and
should never be asked to pretend to be.
On the last occasion when I had
the pleasure of attending one of Sir
ARTHUR PINERO's plays, I said that
“I was sorry that Miss Löhr was made.
gratuitously to appear in a scratch
costume, minus gown and stockings,
because it looks as if this kind of
episode, coming so soon after her
pyjamas scene in Tantalising Tommy,
might grow into a habit with the people
who write for her or manage her.”
Well, my fears have been realised. It
has grown into a habit, at any rate
with Sir ARTHUR. This time, in one
Act, he gets somebody to unlace her
bodice on the stage, and in the next,

Apart from its many obvious merits

From The Daily Watchman —
The Government has at last re-
sponded to the insistent demand of
The Watchman, and has intervened in
the threatened strike of Dustmen. The
| scheme of conciliation outlined in these
columns a few days ago has been
adopted in its entirety, and it is con-
fidently expected that the trouble will
soon be at an end.
From The Evening Reflector:-
The Reflector has at length aroused
the Government to a sense of its duty
in regard to the Dustmen danger.
Negotiations are now in progress, and
will follow the lines laid down in these
columns the day before yesterday.
From The Morning Megaphone:—
The grave danger of a universal
Dustmen's strike has been considerably
lessened by the action of The Mega-
phone. In accordance with the direc-
tions clearly laid down in these columns,
the Government has intervened in the
crisis, and a settlement is anticipated
on the lines of The Megaphone's article
of Monday last.
From The Daily Lantern:-
The efforts of The Lantern to bring
about Government intervention in the
Dustmen's trouble have met with
success, and, as Mr. Asquith has de-
cided to adopt The Lantern's attitude,
peace will in all probability be quickly
restored. -
From The Crier:—
Our readers will be grateful to The
Crier for bringing about Government
intervention in the threatened Dust-
men's strike. There is no doubt that,
thanks to The Crier's agency, the crisis
will soon be over.

I tried a two-step. I trod upon her

it was only to be expected that she
would not remove her feet at the right

indignantly.

THE THINGS THAT ARE
; WORTH ITALICISING.
(With thanks to “The P. M. G.")
There is no doubt that we buy too
few evening papers. Talking recently
to a brilliant woman at a dinner-party
she confessed to me that she never bought
an evening paper at all, and her husband
bought only one. They are both probably
typical of this fatuous country. ... I
naturally told her what she ought to do,
with my usual directness and acumen.
“It is the duty of everyone,” I said,
“to stick to one paper and to buy every
edition of it. I will not name the best
paper: there is no need; I will content
myself with repeating this counsel.”
In reply she asked me if the paper
differed very materially in each edition,
and I told her that in so far as news
went it did.
“But," she said, “your own delightful
little articles, so same and shrewd and,
in spite of the great provocation which
you must continually suffer from so
stupid a world, so good-tempered—do
they not change in each edition ?”
I had to tell her, of course, that they did
not. They were crystallised erquisitely
early in the morning and retained their
orrºs.

valuable ideas during the day which
could come in at intervals with the
winners and not be trasted. Couldn't
there be a new Stop Press Great
Thought in each issue 2 Then I would
willingly buy them all.” -
I quite saw her point, but I could not
undertake to gratify her very natural
wish.” But, of course, the fact re-
mains that we are not a wise people
and are greatly in need of admonition
and advice. On all sides I see it. Do
not then, I would say, spend so much
money on inferior books, inferior music,
inferior pictures, inferior food and in-

STORIES-0F SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
WI.--THE YouNGER SON's.
IT is a hard thing to be the younger
son of an ancient but impoverished
family. The fact that your brother
Thomas is taking most of the dibs
restricts your inheritance to a paltry
two thousand a year, while pride of
blood forbids you to supplement this
by following any of the common pro-
fessions. Impossible for a St. Verax
to be a doctor, a policeman or an
architect. He must £nd some nobler
means of existence.
For three years Roger St. Verax
had lived precariously by betting.
To be a St. Verax was always to be
a sportsman. Roger's father had
created a record in
the sporting world by
winning the Derby
and the Waterloo
Cup with the same
animal — though, in
each case, it narrowly
escaped disqualifica-
tion. Roger himself
almost created an-
other record by mak-
ing betting pay. His
book, showing how to
do it, was actually in
the press when dis-
aster overtook him.
He began by drop-
ping (in sporting par-
lance) a cool thousand
on the Jack Joel Sel-
ling Plate at New-
market. On the next
race he dropped a
cool five hundred, and
later on in the after-
noon a cool seventy-
five pounds ten. The
following day found him at Lingfield,
where he dropped a cool monkey (to
persevere with the language of the
racing stable) on the Solly Joel Cup,
picked it up on the next race, dropped a
cool pony, dropped another cool mon-
key, dropped a cool wallaby, picked up
a cool hippopotamus, and finally, in
the last race of the day, dropped a
couple of luke-warm ferrets. In short,
he was (as they say at Tattersall's
Corner) entirely cleaned out.
When a younger son is cleaned out
there is only one thing for him to
do. Roger St. Verax knew instinc-
tively what it was. He bought a new
silk hat and a short black coat, and
went into the City.
What a wonderſul place, dear reader,
is the City 1 You, madam, who read
this in your daintily upholstered
boudoir, can know but little of the great

men having been located in these parts

moons you have covered your head with
the Financial Supplement of The Times
in mistake for the Literary Supple-
ment, and have thus had thrust upon
you the stirring news that Bango-
Bangos were going up. And I, dear
friends, am equally ignorant of the
secrets of the Stock Exchange. I know
that its members frequently walk to
Brighton, and still more frequently
stay there; that while finding a home
for all the good stories which have
been going the rounds for years, they

for themselves about the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER; and that they
sing the National Anthem very sternly
in unison when occasion demands it.
But there must be something more
in it than this, or why are Bango-
Bangos still going up?
I don't know. And I am sorry to
say that even Roger St. Verax, a direc-
tor of the Bango-Bango Development
Company, is not very clear about it all.
It was as a director of the Bango-
Bango Exploration Company that he
took up his life in the City. As its
name implies the Company was origi-
nally formed to explore Bango-Bango,
an impenetrable district in North
Australia; but when it came to the
point it was found much more profit-
able to explore Hampstead, Clapham
Common, Blackheath, Ealing and
the Company went ahead rapidly, and
in 1907 a new prospector was sent out
to replace the one who was assumed
to have been eaten.
In 1908, Roger first heard the magic
word “reconstruction,” and to his sur-
prise found himself in possession of
twenty thousand pounds and a direc-
torship of the new Bango-Bango Mining
Company.
In 1909 a piece of real gold was
identified, and the shares went up like
a rocket.
In 1910 the Stock Exchange suddenly
woke to the fact that rubber tyres were
made of rubber, and in a moment
the Great Boom was sprung upon
- - an amazed City. The
Bango - Bango
velopment Company
was immediately

prospector, if alive,

important) more land could doubtless
be acquired if the shareholders thought
fit. And even if you were certain that

St. Verax, the well-known financier,
was a director. . . . . and so on.
In short the Bango-Bango Develop-
ment Company was, in the language
of the City, a safe thing.
Let me hasten to the end of this
story. At the end of 1910 Roger was
a millionaire; and for quite a week
afterwards he used to wonder where
all the money had come from. In the
old days, when he won a cool thousand
by betting, he knew that somebody else
had lost a cool thousand by betting, but
it did not seem to be so in this case.
He had met hundreds of men who had
made fortunes through rubber; he had
met hundreds who bitterly regretted
that they had missed making a fortune;
but he had never met anyone who had
lost a fortune. This made him think
the City an even more wonderful place
than before. -
. But before he could be happy there
remained one thing for him to do; he
must find somebody to share his happi-
ness. He called on his old friend, Mary
Brown, one Sunday. -
“Mary,” he said, with the brisk con-
fidence of the City man, “I find I'm
disengaged next Tuesday. Will you
meet me at St. George's Church at 22
I should like to show you the curate
and the vestry and one or two things
like that.”
“Why, what's happened?"
“I am a millionaire,” said Roger
calmly. “So long as I only had my
beggarly pittance, I could not ask you
to marry me. There was nothing for
it but to wait in patience. It has been
a long weary wait, dear, but the sun
has broken through the clouds at last.
I am now in a position to support a
wife. Tuesday at 2," he went on, con-
sulting his pocket diary; “or I could
give you half-an-hour on Monday
morning." - - - - - - -
“But why this extraordinary hurry?
Why mayn't I be married properly,
with presents and things?"
“My dear,” said Roger reproachfully,
“you forget. I am a City man now,
and it is imperative that I should be
married at once. Only a married man,
with everything in his wife's name, can
face with confidence the give and take
of the bustling City.” A. A. M.

I cerTIFY that I have audited the books of The Forger Foiled, as produced at the Lyceum Theatre, and that
the foregoing fairly represents the state of affairs of the principal parties at the fall of the curtain. The accounts of the
Villain were in a mass of confusion and fraudulently kept, and the available assets represented by dishonoured bills,
bogus cheques and investments of a highly speculative nature. The Hero appears to have been of an unbusiness-like
type; his assets at the beginning of the play consisted solely of his savings as cabin-boy (16s. 2d.) and a silver watch,
his financial position being greatly strengthened by a sum of £152,496 3s. 4d. under a will accidentally discovered in
the Fourth Act, under which the Villain had previously benefited. He handicapped himself severely by his devotion
to the Heroine, a female of no available assets at the rise of the curtain, who might be written off as a bad debt.

My examination of the accounts has been largely impeded by most of the important documents having been
in wrecks under water, in pirates' secret caverns, and in hidden panels on the Villain's premises.

* CI:EATE ATMosphere' AT LADY DUMPERLEY's
BIDE A WEE.
MY DEAR Mr. Punch,--I write to you
with some heat to protest against a
gross injustice. They have taken to
closing our village post-office every
Wednesday at 2 o'clock—for a half-
holiday. -
This half-holiday resolves itself into
Maggie Hepburn—who is in charge
and never on principle goes out of the
house in winter—sitting before the fire
in the office, knitting socks and wearily
waiting—so she tells me—for her tea.
The only difference between Wednesday
afternoon and any other afternoon is
that you can't get in. The stamps are
there, the postal orders are there,
Maggie is there. But you can't get
at any of them.
I should not have minded so much
about it if it hadn't been for what
happened last week. That offended
my most sacred instincts of hospitality.
I had a friend staying with me who is
in a Government Office, and who went
out early on Wednesday afternoon with
a letter for his department. It was
velopes—you know: O.H.M.S.—which
looks so well on hall tables. Well, his
memorandum would not go into the
letter-box. He strode over to the door
and found it locked. I ask you to
picture it. Here in the ordinary course
of a working day is a Government
official with papers for his department
unable to enter a post-office. He
hammered. The only response was a
distant murmurous drone, which at
last became intelligible—when he got
his ear to the key-hole—as a sort of
running monologue from the self-in-
carcerated Maggie, who was practi-
cally asleep before the fire. “Closed
for telegrams, the sale of stamps,
postal orders, parcels and the savings'-
bank.” -
I ask you to picture it. Here

Mr. GLAzEBRook reached Plymouth
this (Thursday) evening and almost at

however, delayed for a few minutes

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
THE PATH TO REALITY.
(Hints for the representation of our everyday joys and
sorrows in the Greek form.)
III.--THE ELECTORs.
PERsons of THE PLAY.
A Candidate, a Chairman, an Interrupter; Chorus of
- Labourers. -
ScLNE—A hall arranged for a political meeting in an
agricultural village. Time, 8 P.M.
CHAIRMAN.
O thou who makest even voters fair,
Great Zeus, befriend me when I take the chair!
Skilled am I in the garnering of sheaves,
And highly skilled in muttons and in beeves.
In barley, oats and wheat I stand supreme;
My cows give milk that's passing rich in cream;
I know the due rotation of the crops;
My produce fills the market and the shops.
And I abhor the foreigner's devices,
The freaks of weather and the fall of prices,
Proposing still—a plan too oft rejected—
That British farming ought to be protected.
Therefore men came and added to my pride:
“To-night,” they said, “we want you to preside.
You'll make the village your eternal debtor,
. For none, be sure, could do the business better.”
Behold me, therefore, while I stand and wait
The longed-ſor coming of our Candidate.
Chorus.
We who work on the land, refreshing toil of the day by
, sleep at night,
Ploughing, pasturing, reaping, threshing, little we reck of
: the world's delight.
Winds may beat us and rain defeat us, yet we labour from
youth to age;
Small is the guerdon of all our burden, narrow the house
of our heritage. -
Nay, but they seek us now and speak us soft and pleasant
and fair enough : -
“Blue,” says one, “is the only colour”; “No,” says
another, “Vote for buff.”
Laws may offer us plots for tillage, but the House of the
Laws is far, we fear,
And the agent watches the quiet village, yea, and the lord
of the land is near.
To us, then, deeply pondering it appeareth better not to
utter words, for a word once spoken cannot be recalled,
and there are those that will use it against the speaker.
Therefore, we call upon the fair mistress of well-considered
thoughts to come to our aid. O Silence, on whose rocky
front impetuous rashness beats in vain, be thou with us
to-night. Lap us in thy kind embraces, so shall everyone
beholding our demeanour take pleasure in us, for thus
prudence ordains. But what is that double light in the
distance, rapidly approaching not without a swift pulse of
reiterated noise, oil-scented and with four wheels wildly
revolving 2 For us, indeed, it were wiser to sit down,
reserving our judgment. -
, [The Candidate arrives in a motor-car. He shakes
hands all round, and the meeting begins.
. CHAIRMAN.
All unused to public speaking let me say that there has come
Such a crisis to our country that no man can well be dumb.
We have got a very eloquent and learned Candidate:
|He will scorch our base opponents at the furnace of his .

And support a tax on many things, including one on corn.
We shall pass a vote declaring that we mean to get him in;
So I think I shall resume my seat and ask him to begin.

The one great object of my fond desires
Has been—ahem—to speak to you to-day.
Hither on eager wheels I made my way
From one large meeting, and I shall go hence
Even to a third—that ends my task to-night.

Will there not come disruption to the State

And when my speech is ended he shall stand

Rash, indeed, is the man who interrupts, but for us there
is wisdom in his words, and from the words of the Candi-

Candidate, Winged, in truth, is Chronos, but do thou
restrain thy words. -
Interrupter. Not so, for on my tongue no ox hath walked.
Candidate. Thou weavest speeches as one not responsible.
Interrupter. Responsibility is of many sorts, but the gods
punish the arrogant.
Candidate. Prate not of arrogance, being thyself a brawler.
Interrupter. No brawler am I, but a free speaker in a city
that is not enslaved.
CHAIRMAN.
Enough of this. I now propose a vote,
A resolution, call it what you will,
Pledging us all to back our Candidate.
I put it. It is carried. All is well.

New heart into my breast; and now I go. R. C. L.

Greek poet. It is the greatest poem on Husbandry ever written."
It is only fair to mention that HoMER, like a true Greek,

PUNCIL, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MARCH 6, 1912.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. G. K. CHESTERTON is a bowler of literary googlies
who is apt on occasion to lose his length. In Mamalive
(NELsoN) he has lost it very badly. Occasionally a stray
delivery pitches on the right spot and whips in smartly, but
for the most part it is very tame stuff that he sends down.
On page 264, “Mr. Moses Gould . . . was understood to
suggest that the reader should shorten the proceedings by
leaving out all the adjectives. Mrs. Duke, who had woken
up, observed that she was sure it was all very nice.”
Personally I belong to the Gould rather than the Duke
school of thought. Adjectives, like Worcester sauce,
are a condiment. Mr. CHES-
| certain touch of novelty in so doing ; but it is all the
novelty it possesses. For the rest there are the familiar
scenes of temptation: the motor rides at night, the boudoir
with its sofa. The author writes, as always, with direct-
mess and vigour and with considerable knowledge of sections,
at any rate, of the society which she describes; but the
circumstance that Joseph does not fall but becomes fonder
of his wife, is not sufficient to redeem the book as a whole
from a charge of commonness. Probably the best piece of
work in the novel is the portrait of this wife, though it
would be straining meaning to call her interesting.
When I saw that The Victories of Olivia (MACMILLAN)
was a volume of short stories by Miss EvelyN SHARP I
allowed myself some pleasant
TERTON uses them as a fluid.
To my mind he is unwise to
attempt the narrative form.
Digressions which amuse in
an essay irritate when they
stop the action of a novel.
Mamalive is simply an essay
masquerading as a novel.
All the characters talk at
great length and in exactly
the same way. There is
material for a good short
story in the central idea, of
an eccentric and energetic
man who resolves to be alive
and to make others live. To
this end he tramps round
the world in order to win
through to where he started;
he prevents married life be-
coming monotonous by ro-
mantically eloping with his
wife at frequent intervals,
and he carries a revolver
which he fires at pessimists

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SMOKE NUISANCE
ABATEMENT.
I.
As Charles has said, “It is an ill strike
that brings nobody any good,” and,
if we do run out of coal eventually,
life in London may be cooler, but it
will be a deal cleaner. It is tobacco
smoke, however, that we are engaged
in abating at this period. -
Charles and I share a room in pro-
fessional chambers. When he comes
in the morning, he brings his father's
Times with him, I my own Daily Mail.
When we have read our own papers we
change ; when we have read each
other's papers we have finished for the
morning. (You know now what the
majority of barristers mean when they
talk importantly of their “papers.")
It then becomes necessary to go out
and look for lunch. It was on the
Tuesday before Lent began that the
resolution was formed. I had had a
heavy morning's work (there had been
no fewer than three supplements to The
Times) and I went out to have a heavy
lunch, to even things up. Fortunately
for my purpose I discovered pancakes
on the menu. I ate them, and later on
in the afternoon they discovered me;
but I have forgiven them, because
they were very good pancakes, and,
moreover, the mention of them enabled
Charles to identify the day as Shrove
Tuesday, and to draw the deduction
that we were on the verge of the self-
denial period. -
“We will,” we said, coming at once
to the point, “give up smoking in
Lent,” and we shook each other's
hand proudly and congratulated each
other warmly. But Lent, of course,
did not begin till the next morning.
II.
The worst of life is that next morn-
ing always comes.
“I have an idea,” said Charles,
fingering his pouch affectionately.
“So have I,” I replied, “but it
would be hardly decent to broach it
thus early in the proceedings. Let us
hang on to our resolution for one day,
at any rate." -
“I was not going to suggest alto-
gether giving up the giving up, but
only to remark that we must not be
over-reaching even in our virtues. I
have been in communication with a
man who does this sort of thing every
year, and he tells me that No-Smoking-
before-Dinner is the more orthodox
practice. Let us be good, Lumpy”
(that's me), “but let us not be osten-
tatious in our goodness."
I wore the appearance of a man who
loved principle in order to oblige a
friend, as I replied, “Very well, if your
heart is set upon it. No Smoking
before Dinner.”
III.
Any legislator will tell you that the
really tricky part about his business is
getting the definitions right. For
instance, if a law is made forbidding
smoking before dinner, there will be
trouble for a certainty, unless it is very
particular to say exactly what it means
by “dinner." Of course, if it simply
does not attempt a definition at all,
it is bound to be evaded. I should
have been a poor lawyer if I could not
get round a law like that, even at two
o'clock in the afternoon, siesta time.
“Everybody knows," said Charles,
as a last protest against my learned
argument, “that dinner is the meal
you have about seven-thirty or eight.”
“You think only," I retorted, “of
the upper class. I prefer to think of
the ruling class, which dines at mid-
day. The mass is always right now-
a-days. Therefore, I have dined, and,
in accordance with the terms of my
contract, I will now smoke.”
Charles tried once more before
giving in. “You’ll be in a fix for
something to do when you get to
seven-thirty. Having dined now, what
will you do then 2" -
“I shall sup,” I said. -
“So shall I,” said Charles, pro-
ducing a pipe.
IV.
About a week later, “I hate break-
fast without the after-breakfast pipe,”
said Charles tentatively.
“Then give up breakfast,” I sug-
gested.
The idea did not appear to com-
mend itself to him at the time, but
later on it occurred to him that it was
at least an idea.
V.
Charles is conscientious, undoubtedly
conscientious. In coming to the re-
luctant conclusion that dinner, after
all, may be eaten at any time of the
day, in accordance with the tastes and
needs of the consumer, and that it
will still be dinner even at 9 A.M., he
has insisted on the restriction that it
cannot honestly consist of tea (or
coffee), poached eggs and marmalade.
So, dining first thing after getting up,
he insists on eating a chop and
drinking cold drinks. He buoys him-
self up with the prospect of his
rapidly approaching after-dinner pipe.
In adopting his line of argument,
I fancy I have materially improved
upon it. It occurred to me, while
I was lying in bed this morning and
bath, that something must be done
to mitigate the shock of this cold water
in the mornings.
“By the way, Morton,” I said, “I
will take some coffee after dinner in
future."
I went back to sleep and had
another idea.
“By the way, Morton,” I said,
“when you bring in the meal, you
might as well bring it all together.
It will save you journeys to and fro.
Bring it all in, and put it all on the
table at once—all, including the coffee
and the er—dessert.”
“The dessert, Sir? " -
“Yes, the preserved orange,” I
explained with, I fear, something
approaching a wink.
Lent is all right, if you treat it
properly . . . The chop I never
objected to. -

THE BELGIAN PINAFOR.E.
'Twas bought in Bruges, the shop was
poor,
One read “Au Bébé" flourished o'er
The ancient lintel; to that door
No English guinea -
Had ever come nor travelled gold
Gladdened her gaze, that woman old,
Who tottered from the gloom and sold
The Belgian “pinny.”
I mind me choosing in the place
A cap with frills of little lace;
“That too,” I said, “shall come to grace
My Small and Sweet." .
Prim in her pinafore arrayed
I pictured Betsey while I strayed
Where, all the time, the proud bells
played -
Above the street.
And now upon the roguish sprite
Who in the yard with such delight
Partakes the ancient sunning right
Of stable cats,
The Belgian “pinny” flaunts its hue,
Still the same stripe of white and blue
As, Betsey, when 'twas dyed for you
In Flemish vats. :
Still of its old lost life it tells
And alien provenance; there are spells
And glamour of the Town of Bells
About it shed,
And when my Belgian Betsey climbs
My knee I’ve heard a hundred times
The clash and ripple of the chimes
Around her head, -
As though the child herself did play
Without some white estaminet
Shuttered and silent where, all day
In sun and shower,
Two little lions with stone grins
Hold 'scutcheons under paws and chins
And their divine appellant dins
-

The honoured hour.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A PARIs.
It has suddenly become an accepted article of our family
policy that—with an exception which, since it is John,
may properly be described as puerile—we are all going to
Paris for Easter and are to stay there for a week or ten
days. How do these things happen? I give you my word
of honour that a week or so ago I had not the slightest
definite intention of going to Paris en père de famille or
even en garçon. Some vague and incautious words I may
have let slip pointing to a remote, nay, to an impossible,
future, in which it would be agreeable for me to re-visit
Paris and do a round of restaurants and theatres—for me
alone, mind you, not for me and three little girls, to say
nothing of their mother; but even if I said them I never
supposed the words would be used against me. The
terrible fact, however, remains. I had no intention of
going to Paris, and now it is settled that we are all to go
there.
I think it was Helen who began the insidious campaign.
She was sitting over an absorbing piece of embroidery and
had not spoken for some time. Suddenly she broke the
silence: “Have you fixed the day yet 2" she said.
“What day?” said I.
“The day for our going, you know."
“Going where 2 " I asked.
“Going to Paris.” * *
“Going to Paris / " I laughed. “Why, you funny little
person, what's put that into your head 2 We're not going
to Paris.” -
Thereupon, without a word, she gathered up her work,
stuck her needle carefully into it, rose from her chair, gave
a deep reproachful sigh and left the room.
During the rest of that evening the subject was not
referred to again; but on the following day Rosie, who is
plump and eleven and very candid for her age, developed
what I now perceive to have been another flank attack.
“Daddy!” she said.
“Halloa ” said I.
“Are there lots of hotels in Paris 2"
“Yes, any amount.”
“What are their names 2"
“Oh " said I, “there's the Bristol, and the Chatham,
and the Ritz, and Meurice's, and the Hôtel d'Iéna and
hundreds of others.”
“Which is the nicest ?”
“They're all pretty good, in one way or another.”
“I see. Which are we going to stay at 2 " .
“WE | We're not going to Paris.”
“Daddy!” -
“I don't know what you're all driving at with your
Paris.. I never dreamt of going to Paris.”
“Daddy!!”
And with that expression of amazement and pain she,
too, evaporated in a sigh out of the room.
On the next day Peggy took up the fighting. She
skirmished into the library and, finding me hard at work,
offered to dance or recite to me or to talk French to me.
I begged to be excused.
“I thought,” she insinuated, “you'd like some French.
We've been having a French lesson. Guess what we've
been doing " | -
“Grammar 2 " I said.
“Yes, and something else.”
“Reading?” - - -
“And something else.”
“Writing?” -
“Yes; but you must guess what kind of writing."
“How clever you are, Dad! I always say you can guess
anything. We've been writing letters to hotels in Paris.”
“What on earth about 2."
“Ordering rooms, you know. Here's my letter. Made-
moiselle hasn't corrected it, but if it's all right you can
send it off. We like to save you trouble, you know, Dad.”
She then produced a soiled scrap of paper and laid it
before me. “Mademoiselle said some of the things,” she
explained, “but I did the writing.” These were the mystic
words I read:—
“MossIER,-J'ai lintention de passe huit ou dixjour
a Paris et je vous pri de me vair connetre le tarife de
une chambre a couche a deux lit et une chambre et
une outre chambre a deux lit et une chambre pour la
famme de chambre de madam.
“Agrey Monsier mes sinsare salutation.”
“Yes,” I said, “it’s first-class; and if we were going to
Paris I'd send that letter and no other. But we're not—”
“Not going to Paris, Dad?" she interrupted.
“No, certainly not.”
“Dad!!! You're pretending;" and away she danced.
I need not linger over a description of the overwhelming
frontal attack carried out by the main body after these
three preliminaries had been thus feebly opposed. Every-
body will know how it went –“You really shouldn't have
put the idea into the children's heads. Well, if you didn't
I don't know how they got hold of it. If you meant to
disappoint them you shouldn't have spoken about it at all.
No, you're quite wrong: that isn't in the least illogical.
It's the plain truth. And after all it just does happen
that we can afford it, and the girls will remember it all
their lives, and you know you wouldn't enjoy it without
them, and they really want a change, and so do you and
I for the matter of that.” This will serve as an outline.
The upshot is that we are going to Paris. I suppose I
ought to have realised my fate from the very first, instead
of spending myself in a perfectly unavailing struggle.
TO A WACUUM CLEANER.
(On the Occasion of an Annual Visitation.)
ENGINE infernal, whom I would not greet
With other than the most opprobrious titles,
Rough men have just installed you in the street,
Nay, even now uncoil in countless feet
Your dust-extracting india-rubber vitals.
And so I fly, for were I to remain
Assailed all day by your continual clatter,
You must, ere nightly shades descend again,
Reduce my never too prolific brain
To the consistency of molten batter.
In other years, when Spring's benignant sway
Upon the waiting earth was gently stealing,
There came a van on some appointed day,
With men who bore the carpets far away
To have them beaten in remotest Ealing.
But now that times have changed, and things like you
Annihilate all chance of inspiration,
I'm off to roam fresh woods and pastures new,
To talk with Nature for a day or two
And tell her of this latest visitation.
She will not marvel if my mood be glum,
And when I make it clear to whom I owe i5,
She 'll listen, sympathetically dumb;
For Nature, too, abhors a vacuum

And will commiserate a pestered poet !

DRAWING THE LINE.
The Chalk Line—by FABIAN WARE
and NorMAN MACOwAN at the Queen's
—is a melodrama of the sort which
makes you want sometimes to laugh
and sometimes to sink out of sight
beneath your tip-up chair. It is all
about our Dear Old Country (Cheers
from the patriots) and Foreign Spies
(Groans from the patriots), and what
the War Office (Hisses from the patriots)
is going to do.
It is at this sort of drama that my
admiration for actors reaches its ex-
treme height; that they should be able
to play these unreal parts with such
a complete lack of self-consciousness
astonishes me. In their case you or I
would go through the play with a fixed
sheepish expression, stopping occasion-
ally to apologise to the audience for
having to do it at all.
Take Captain Grieg, for instance. He
is the gallant soldier who saved England
in the Boer War and is now going to
save her in the threatened war between
Fngland and X—. When he is off
the stage, he is spoken of continually
as a hero and the man to save the
Dear Old Country. “Trust the
Captain,” says everybody to everybody
else; “he'll pull Old England through.”
When he is on the stage he spends
his time clasping people by the hand
—not to say “How do you do?”
or “Good-bye," but to pledge them
to help him in his task of saving
England. Now, how impossible for
us to believe in ourselves when playing
Captain Grieg. How impossible not
to remember that we were quite
ordinary people, with a handicap of 24
or a waist of 36, who, in the absence
of any more remarkable “business”
than handshaking, simply couldn't be
taken seriously as Empire-savers. But
Mr. KENNETH Douglas plays it with
ease and conviction. It is wonderful.
There is no need to give the plot of
The Chalk Line; and, on my part, no
ability to explain why it is so called.
The “chalk line” was the line which one
of the characters walked along as a
test of his sobriety, but how that pro-
vides the motif of the play I do not
know. Most of the acting is quite
good. Best of all was the performance
of Mr. CHARLEs W. FRANCE; he was
the old laird who had invented a gas
which would slay an army, and when
he first came on the stage a sudden mist
of reality descended for a moment

THE QUESTION.
I'M in really a remarkable quandary,
A dilemma unexperienced before ;
It's a case in which I have to be particularly wary
Lest I do what I might afterwards deplore;
And, although the breach of confidence is much against the
grain,
With permission, I'll endeavour to explain.
There's a lady who has gloriously taken
The advantage that the present year conſers
By proposing, with a force that one can hardly read un-
shaken, -
To–excuse me if I blush—to make me hers.
As my own attempts at marriage have been very much
amiss, º - * *
I should like to ask you what you think of this.
She's a person of most excellent endowment,
If she's hardly the ideal of one's dream :
And, you'll understand, although I'm undecided for the
moment, -
She's a lady whom to know is to esteem.
I may add that, with a fervour one would hardly like to
damp, -
She encloses me an envelope and stamp.
To accept, decline, refer her to my mother,
Would of course provide an answer, ay or nay;
But an awkwardness arises from the fact that there 's
another,
And I’m troubled as to what I ought to say:
As a fact, the other lady hasn't made the least advance,
But I'd like to wait and give her every chance.
For I love her. With an ever-growing hunger
I have found her ever sweet, but often cold ;
It's undoubtedly the case that she's considerably younger
And may look on me as elderly or “old”! -
And, indeed, it's on the cards that, if acquainted with the
fact
Of my passion, she might think that I was cracked.
O my lady, I am hopeless, I am silly, oh,
I may be all that isn't to your taste,
But I love you, O my ladylove, I worship you like—billy-oh
Appeals to me as accurate and chaste;
But—to finish the apostrophe-the lady doesn't speak,
For she lacks the inclination, or the cheek.
So you see it. There's a claim, which seems the stronger,
From a lady whom there's much to recommend;
And perhaps it isn't prudent to be waiting any longer
With my youth and beauty drawing to an end;
While you can't postpone an answer to the distant by-
and-bye
When a lady sends a stamp for a reply.
Yet the Other who's away, if she were willing,
If that Other, whom just now I can't get at,
Were to love me—and she may—oh, that would simply be
too killing;
Oh, my readers, what a tragedy were that
Yet, suppose I found she didn't, it would mean a heavy loss;
To the gods I give the matter. I shall toss.

THE LAST RESORT.
Extract from “The Daily Boast,” March 5:-
At a specially summoned meeting of the Gooseage Rate-
payers' Association held at the Town Hall a few days ago,
it was unanimously decided to take the whole front page of
The Daily Boast for one day to advertise the attractions
of that delightful seaside resort.
This enterprise—entailing as it does the expenditure
of £500 (not 50s., as one of the speakers at the meeting
stated)—is sure to attract the greatest attention, and in
anticipation we give a few details of this beauty-spot.
Situated 'twixt moor and sea, the air is stated by the
Town's Publicity Dept. to be found in great profusion.
The temperature is kept uniformly between 60° and
70°, while a Bye-Law requires that all rain should fall
between the hours of 10 P.M. and sunrise. But perhaps
the greatest attraction of all is the bathing, the water
here possessing that degree of salinity which the upper
reaches of the Thames just miss and which the Dead Sea
so overdoes. Indeed, for some years the only drawback
to Gooseage has been the fact that The Daily Boast did not
appear at breakfast time; but this will now be remedied.
In view of the probable rush of visitors we have decided
to run a Daily Boast Special, which will bring The Daily
Boast into Gooseage in time for delivery with the morning
rasher.
Extract from “The Daily Boast,” March 6:—
The nation's interest in Gooseage is growing. All day
long yesterday we were kept busy answering enquiries.
A well-known Harley Street physician rang up to ask if
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE had ever lived at Gooseage; the answer
is in the negative. Another enquirer asks: What are the
apartments like 2 A gentleman who spent a week there
last year says they cannot be bettered. He changed his
rooms seven times, yet at the end was unable to say that
he was any more comfortable than he had been at first.
Yet another, a City man, asks: Is there a good telephone
connection with London 2 To test the matter, we rang up
during the busiest time of the day 3127 Blackpool, and
we got on to 4127 Gooseage (the number we required)
in less than ten minutes.
Gooseage is not without its mention in literature.
GEORGE Borrow says: “By making a détour we avoided
Gooseage; ” Sir A. CoNAN Doyle writes: “Ten miles
to the right, covered with an impenetrable fog, lay
Gooseage; ” while BRADSHAw, in his bright little monthly
magazine, remarks: “Gooseage, 1474 miles from Euston,
vid L. & N.W. Rly.”

I'M short You 'LL BE 'ighly AMUSED !”
THE WHITE ELEPHANT SALE.
MY DEAR ELAINE,--I wonder if you
| have heard of the latest device for the
alleviation of life—the White Elephant
Sale? Used with discretion, it is really
great. The idea is this. Every one
has one or two things that they don't
want—not exactly rubbish, but some
article or other which fights with one's
| own taste. Usually these are wedding
presents and are kept hidden away,
except when the persons who gave
them come to dinner. But after a
while, as time goes on and memories
become dim, it is safe to get rid of
them, and not very difficult either,
because what one person hates another
likes. For example, you yourself can-
not endure the sight of an épergne, and
you have a very handsome one. Mrs.
Mackinder at the Laurels thinks no
house complete without an épergne,
but the parlourmaid has just broken
hers (having had some bad news about
her married sister in Durban which
upset her nerves), and if your épergne
were sent to a White Elephant Sale
Mrs. Mackinder would most certainly
buy it; while it is on the cards that
she has something in her house that
Sheraton wine cooler, say—which you
would make every effort to acquire if
you saw it in a White Elephant Sale.
Now you understand what a White
Elephant Sale is; and, used with dis-
cretion, as I said, the institution can
be most valuable.
But you must exercise discretion. . .
Let me tell you what has just
happened here, where our first White
Elephant Sale has been held. Mrs.
Cawston, whom I fancy you once met,
a little fluffy expensive woman with
a titled aunt, sent an embroidered
hand-bag which that aunt gave her
last Christmas. It was one of those
costly things which no one could
possibly use and which are made for
exchange among friends at that terrible
season. Looking at it, ninety-nine
persons out of a hundred would say
that it came from Bond Street and
cost four guineas. The tragedy is that
it didn't, and that Mrs. Cawston's
titled aunt motored over unex-
pectedly — that's one of the awful
things about motors, that they do
things unexpectedly—a distance of
eighty-five miles, on the day of
the sale, and, arriving when Mrs.
Cawston was at the sale, went on
pened. The very first thing that the
titled aunt saw was her Christmas
present, with a half-guinea ticket on it,
and she knew it was hers because, so
far from coming from a Bond Street
shop, it was made under her own eyes

THERE won't be nothing for dinner,
For there ain't no meat to carve;
And the missus is looking thinner,
And soon we shall probably starve;
And it ain't any use proposing
As I ought to find some work,
For the factory doors are closing
And the skies are all pit-murk.
But we must have fun and laughter
So long as our breath is drawn,
And so long as beneath this rafter
There's anything left to pawn.
They say there's a rare sensation
At the old Frivolity Hall
That’s “elicitin' acclamation
Nightly” from one and all.
And I think, by putting the table

To go for a last good shout.

A slaver up there by the Peak,
And thrifty with every shiner

Till the strike came on that's dammin'
The stream of the nation's luck,
And has brought despair and famine,
And he was the first wot struck.
And they said to him, “Be an artist,”
And he wrote back, “Right you are”
(For the best jobs go to the smartest),
And now he's a blooming star.
By all accounts it's a grand turn,
He comes in his mining togs,
With a sort of a pick and a lantern
And dances a dance with clogs.
And he looks right up at the gallery
And tells in his feeling way
How he climbed to his present salary,
He is a regular piece of quality,
So as soon as we've pawned them

And now IT has deceived me.
For months IT has warned me against
the purchase of coal. IT showed me
the greed of middlemen and the im-
possibility of a strike. My neighbours
hurried to the coal-dealers, whilst I,
confident in IT, scoffed at them.
Brown has even his attics stocked with
coke. The coal sacks of Jones are to
be found even under his billiard-table.
Robinson has a mountainous pile of
cobbles in his back garden. Smith boasts
to me that his truck-load will last till
midsummer—by which time he predicts
we shall have Tariff Reform with higher
wages for miners and consequently
cheaper coal, or else red revolution,
when we shall be able to warm our-
selves by the embers of our neighbours'

IT. Brown, who reads The Daily
Express, warns me against the sensa-
tional press. Whilst Robinson, a weird
person who says he reads The Daily

whose proprietors pander to the
gambler.
And I, who trusted IT so confidently,
am left with an empty cellar. The
only illumination in my grate is the
flame of a burning Daily Mail. Am I
to burn a thousand copies per day so
that I may be able to defy the rigour of
an English spring? Has that been ITS
diabolical design all through 2
I am, I hope, a humane man; but if
it were feasible, I should like to roast
ITS staff over a slow coal fire.
Only I doubt whether any of my
selfish neighbours would lend me coal
even for such a laudable purpose.

Now, when the ties that lightly bind us
Slacken awhile at the call of Home,
Leaving ourlatter-day science behindus,
Leaving the love of ancient Rome–
Ere we depart to enjoy for a season
Freedom from regular work and rules,
Come let us all in rhyme and reason
Honour the best of schools.
Here's to our Founder, whose ancient
bounty
Freely bestowed with a pious care,
Fostered the youth of his native county,
Gave us a name we are proud to bear.
Here's to his followers, wise gift-
makers,
Friends who helped when our num-
bers were few,
Widened our walls and enlarged our
àCrCS,
Stablished the school anew.
Here 's to our Head, in whom all
centres,
Ruling his realm with a kindly sway;
Here's to the Masters, our guides and
mentors,
hº in work and comrades in
play;
Here's to the Old Boys, working their
way up
Out in the world on the ladder of
Fame;
Here's to the New Boys, learning to
play up,
Ay, and to play the game.
Time will bring us our seasons of trial,
Seasons of joy when our ship arrives,
Yet, whatever be writ on the dial,
Now is the golden hour of our lives;
Now is the feast spread fair before us—
None but slackers or knaves or fools
Ever shall fail to swell the chorus,
“Here's to the best of schools.”
From a ticket of the Concert-Goers'
Club:—
“EvKNING DREss.

Being now certain of the safety of our

who looked after them.”—Northern JWhig.

THE COLLABORATORS.
THE beauty of criticising a play in a
weekly paper is that you can read first
what the daily papers say about it and
then point out how ridiculously wrong
they are. This gives you—as Mr. Chester
Coote would have explained in French
to Kipps—a point d'appui. (“Oo!”
from Kipps). So I begin by recording
my objection to the criticism that
Kipps of the play is not the simple
lovable soul which Kipps of the book
was. I found him even more lovable.
As played by Mr. O. B. CLARENCE, he
kept my sympathy and affection
throughout the evening; indeed, there
were times when I could hardly keep
from crying out, “Oh, you dear!” For
Mr. CLARENCE brings laughter and
tears very close together. His Kipps is
never simply a figure of farce, as in the
hands of another actor it might easily
have become. And the technical skill
of the performance is amazing. I'very
gesture and movement is right; every
fleeting expression of the face is a con-
tribution to the complete character. Mr.
CLARENCE, in short, is the real Kipps,
and the play is therefore a success.

"But I doubt, somehow, if Mr. WELLs
and Mr. BESIER will collaborate again.
I think they have each made a discovery
by this time. Mr. BESIER has dis-
covered that of all the difficult authors
to dramatise, Mr. WELLs is the most
elusive: the explanatory and paren-
thetic author whose dialogue is im-
plied by dots and made lucid by a run-
ning comment of analysis. Delightful
for the library; but for the stage—oh,
no And Mr. WELLs has discovered
that a play isn't allowed to be a play
until it has submitted to a score
of absurd conventions; that there
are parasites of the theatre, named
“technique” and “stagecraft,” which
suck the blood out of a living situation,
and leave it what is called effective.
All right for the dramatist who is
inoculated; but for the poor novelist—
well!
I figure to myself the struggle be-
tween Mr. BESIER's dramatic instincts
and Mr. WELLs' literary and parental
instincts . . . and the triumph of Mr.
BESIER. In this way:-
THE Book: Kipps does not meet
the grown-up Ann until after he is
engaged to Helen Walshingham.
THE PLAY : He meets her just be-
fore he comes into his money.
[Mr. WELLs : Then he wouldn't have got
engaged to Helen.
Mr. BEsi Eit: You don't understand. We
must have Ann on in the First Act.]
THE Book: Mr. Coote was a house-
agent with no financial interest in
Kipps.
THE PLAY : He is the solicitor who
has charge of Kipps' money.
[Mr. WELLs : But why?
Mr. BEsi Elt: It gives him a reason for coming
into the shop in the First Act and introducing
himself to Kipps.]
THE Book: Kipps, sick of society,
comes into Ann's kitchen late at night
and makes her run away with him.
THE PLAY : Mr. Coote comes in a
little later on a different errand.
|Mr. WELLs: But he couldn't possibly come !
Mr. BESIER : Ah! but think what an effective
situation you get—Kipps defying Coote /
And so on. Yet, you know, Mr.
BESIER has really done his work quite
well (except for the final kitchen scene);
and I doubt if there could be a better
dramatic version of Kipps than this.
I have already spoken of Mr.
CLARENCE, who is indeed the making
of the play. Perhaps he might have
shown a little more development in
the six months between the Second
and Third Acts; surely he would have
learnt the limitations of brown boots
in that time ! On the other hand, I
may be wrong in supposing that six
months did elapse. I certainly thought
Ann said so; but as against this it
must be recorded that in both Acts it
played by Miss CHRISTINE SILVER,
with an accent rather too refined and
a manner which invited more sympathy
than Amn of the book would have
sought. Mr. RUDGE HARDING was
perfect as Mr. Chester Coote; he had
a good deal to do and did it uniformly
well. Of the small parts, a word
should be said for the excellent Pierce
of Mr. GILBERT Yorke, a capital
picture of a draper's assistant. These
players and others help Mr. CLARENCE
to give us a delightful evening's enter-
tainment, which no lover of Kipps
should fail to see. M.
HINTS ON THE CARE OF THE
PERSON.
A COLUMN FOR MEN.
THE HAIR.
WHEN the hat requires force to fix it
in position, it is time to consider the
question of getting the hair cut. If
desired, a professional may be employed,
but excellent results can be obtained
by grasping each hair between the first
finger and thumb of the left hand,
stretching it to its full extent, and
severing it by means of a fretsaw
manipulated by the right. This pro-
cess takes time. Do not be alarmed
by falling hair. The fall is brought
about by the normal action of gravity,
as a little quiet thought will show. A
good way to catch flies is to smear the
hair thickly with a mixture of honey
and treacle.
SHAVING.
Deep cuts inflicted while shaving
should be carefully filled up with rubber
solution.
THE ELBows.
Roughening of the skin at the elbows
can be treated by holding them in
boiling water for ten or fifteen minutes.
If the joints creak, the injection of a
little good cycle oil will form an amateur
surgical operation of great interest.
THE WAIST.
It is advisable on the whole to leave
this to nature, and to accept the result
with resignation.
THE COMPLEXION.
This is an important matter. The
cheeks should be scoured with good
sandpaper each evening for ten minutes
and afterwards rubbed with a hare's
foot. Hares require careful training
before they can be trusted to perform
this operation intelligently, and a really
capable animal cannot be too highly
prized. Before retiring to rest, cover
the pillow to a depth of one inch with
melted tallow. Sleep face downwards.
breathe through the ears, which requires
practice. Use only the best soap for
toilet purposes. Every kind of soap is
the best.
THE NAILs.
These should be trimmed from time
to time by means of scissors, knife,
clippers or an ordinary grindstone. It
is a pretty practice to have the nails of
the index fingers carved into silhouette
representations of one's fiancée.
THE EARs.
In cold weather these sensitive organs
should be protected by means of red
flannel coverings; in hot, a small piece
of ice should be inserted in each and
renewed when necessary. Earache
cannot be cured by extraction, and the
operation, though frequent in the Middle
Ages, is not now attempted. The ears
should not be used as pen-racks or
cigarette cases, nor is it in the best of
taste to gesticulate with them,
THE TEETH.
Grinding the teeth is not often re-
sorted to except upon the stage, where
the care bestowed on personal appear-
ance is sometimes carried to excess. It
is satisfactory to note that the need for
universal military training is becoming
recognised, and the drilling of teeth is,
according to dental statistics, largely on
the increase. Chewing coke was at one
time considered to promote a healthy
condition of the molars; but it should
be discontinued during times of Strike.
THE EYEBRows.
These should occasionally be singed.
The best way is to hold them over a gas
jet until a sizzling noise is heard.
ARE SECOND THOUGHTS BEST?
IN the course of a vivacious inter-
view with a representative of The
Standard, Signor MASCAGNI recounts
how the illustrious VERDI conceived a
strong repulsion to Cavalleria Rusti-
cana, but, on making a second trial, not
only modified his hostile verdict, but
was converted to admiration of its
melodic beauties. His remarkable ex-
perience has prompted a well-known
spiritualist, who for the present desires
to preserve his anonymity, to obtain
from a number of other old masters,
famous in the spheres of art and action,
estimates of the work and achievements
of their living successors. The results
we are now in a position to lay before
our readers.
His first experiment was with PALES-
TRINA, who thus delivered himself on
the subject of ELGAR's Gerontius.

maestro, “is a very brainy composer,

interest and satisfaction. At first I
own that some of his harmonies and
progressions struck me as rather odd,
but in the end I have got to think them
just lovely.” The talented composer
concluded his message with the in-
teresting suggestion that if any of his
works were performed at the Palace
Music Hall, it might be re-named the
Palestrina, or the Crystal Palestrina.
BEETHoveN's criticisms on the
poetry and compositions of the GER-
MAN EMPEROR were extremely vivid
and complimentary. Indeed, he
went so far as to place him above
DANTE and BACH, as he was a better
conductor than the first and a better
rhymer than the second. Very in-
teresting, too, were his comments on
STRAUss's Elektra. “On a first
perusal of this score I came to the con-
clusion that it was the most hoggish
(schweinisch) performance that had
ever been perpetrated. But further
study has induced me to revise my
judgment, and I now unhesitatingly
declare that it is at all points an
After all, how infinitely more stimulat-
ing is the spectacle of triumphant
revenge than that of insipid virtue!”
Lord MACAULAY was next invited to
give his views on the letters of Mr.
ALGERNoN Ashton, and with his usual
gusto complied. “At the first blush,”
he observed, “I own that I was
flabbergasted by what I considered to
be the monotonous futility of these
amazing documents. But a second
reading has brought home to me the
beauty of their lapidary style, the
subtleness of their humour, the nobility
of their philosophy. Happy editors,

ADDIson's acclamation of Mr. FILSON
YoUNG as the essayist par excellence of

vincing in its enthusiastic sincerity.
“To read “The Things that Matter,’”
he says, “in a modest sheet that creeps

is marked by the generosity which was
one of the most characteristic traits
of the famous Carthaginian. “I be-

I THINK that Miss UNA L. SILBERRAD ought to have

Women's Suffrage in general, and not because her latest
novel, Success, has anything to do with the subject, for it
hasn't; nor again, because it is published by CoNSTABLE. The
fact is, it deals mainly with engineering, and the authoress
discourses so learnedly on the technical details of this very
unfeminine science that she leaves a mere man aghast.

I have written one opinion of Mr. GILBERT CANNAN's

I did not consider that my praises were sufficiently explicit.
I compared it with Tristram Shandy, not unfavourably, and
remarked that Mr. CANNAN was obviously under the in-
fluence, but no mere imitator, of the great STERNE. There
may be those to whom my Uncle Toby and Mr. Shandy are

cult feat of evolving a heroine
not only plain but insigni-
ficant in appearance and yet
thoroughly attractive and in-
teresting. There are other good
characters in the book, and
considering how small a space
is given to them, the members
of the Annarly family in par-
ticular stand out with a wonder-
ful distinctness. I don't exactly
know why Miss SILBERRAD
called her story Success when
she wrote it, for it was only
by means of a chance legacy
that Michael was at last en-

personal resentment against

more diverting, his observation
or his deduction; he has the
intellectual woman, the eccen-
tric and the poseur to perſec-

“scene” is positively deadly.

again stoop to hypocrisy or

ment in crises. Lastly, the
reader must not be put off the

truth this is a most delightful book. It is the simple

His span of life was of five years only, but great natures

I FouxD myself in the same drawing-
room with Celia the other day, so
I offered her one of my favourite
sandwiches. (I hadn't seen her for
some time, and there were plenty in
the plate.) -
“If you are coming to talk to me,"
she said, “I think I had better warn
you that I am a Militant Suffragist."
“Then you won't want a sandwich,”
I said gladly, and I withdrew the plate.
“I suppose,” said Celia, “that what
I really want is a vote.”
“Have mine; I can never do any-
thing with it. The other man keeps
slipping in by about three thousand."
“But it isn't only that. I want to
see the whole position of women altered.
I want to see—" -
I looked round for her mother.
“Tell me,” I said gently; “when did
this come over you?”
“In the last few weeks,” said Celia.
“And I don't wonder.”

to listen. -

He was ready for her.
“This is a terrible disaster for the
country, this coal strike,” he said.
“Isn't it?"said Celia; and feeling that
that was inadequate, added, “Terrible!”
“I don't know what's happening to

reviewed a succession of possible replies

“I suppose so,” said Celia gloomily.
“Once stop the supplies of coal, you
see, and you drain the life-blood of the
country.” -
“Of course,” said Celia, and looked
very serious.
After lunch an extremely brisk little
man took her in hand. -
“Have you been studying this coal
strike question at all?” he began.
“I read the papers,” said Celia.
“Ah, but you don't get it there.
They don't tell you—they don't tell
you. Now I know a man who is
actually in it, and he says—and he
knows this for a fact—that from the
moment when the first man downed
tools—from the very moment when he
downed tools . . .”
Celia edged away from him nervously.
Her face had assumed an expression of
wild interest which she was certain
couldn't last much longer. **
“Now, take coal at the pit's mouth,”
he went on—“at the pit's mouth "→
he shook a forefinger at her—“at the
pit's mouth—and I know this for a fact
—the royalties, the royalties are --
“It's awful,” said Celia. “I know.”
Celia went home feeling a little dis-
turbed. There was something in her
mind, a dim sense of foreboding, which
kept casting its shadow across her plea-
santest thoughts; “Just as you feel,”
she said, “when you know you've got
to go to the dentist.” But they had a
big dinner-party that evening, and
Celia, full of the joy of life, was not
going to let anything stand in the way
of her enjoyment of it.
Her man began on the stairs.
“Well,” he said, “what about the
coal strike? When are you going to
start your coal parties 2 Fire, 10–2.'
They say that that's going to be the
new rage.” He smiled reassuringly at
her. He was giving the impression
that he could have been very, very seri-
ous over this terrible business, but that
for her sake he was wearing the mask.
In the presence of women a man must
make light of danger. -
Celia understood then what was
troubling her; and as, half-way through
dinner, the man on her other side turned
to talk to her, she shot an urgent ques-
tion at him. At any cost she must
know the worst. - - - - * *
“How long will the strike last 2" she
said earnestly. -
“That's just what I was going to
ask you,” he said. “I fear it may be
months.”
Celia sighed deeply.
I took the last sandwich and put
down the plate.
“And that,” said Celia, “was threo
“It has been the same ever since 2 " .
I asked, beginning on a new plate.
“Every day. I'm tired of it. I
shrink from every new man I meet. I
wait nervously for the word “coal,’ feel-
ing that I shall scream when it comes.

last half-hour?

THE SPRING TROUT.
Now that wintry clouds have liſted
To the joy of waiting herds,
And the March-scene has been shifted
Mid an orchestra of birds,
You may see me through the rushes
Lying “doggo" by the brink,
Popping up to scare the thrushes
Which are coming down to drink.
Though it's not for me to boast, I'm
Like no other fish I know,
For I find the yearly close-time
Most unconscionably slow,
While my brethren hold it treason
For the which I ought to die,
Just because I greet the Season
With a twinkle in my eye.
Though my parents hint of foemen
And the tricks that they devise—
How they tickle your abdomen,
How they tempt you with their flies;
Though the sadness of the platter
Dims the gladness of the pool,
Do the perils really matter
If I'm free to play the fool”
Should I see the portly Vicar
Silhouetted on the stream,
Oh! my scales begin to flicker
And my eyes begin to gleam,
For he'll track my merry gambols,
Never dreaming that he's mine
Till I've lured him to the brambles,
Till I've heard him foul his line.
But when summer brings an outlet
To the raptures of the burn,
And the fancy of the troutlet
Takes a sentimental turn,
Though the cast should ne'er deceive me,
Though the splash should damp my
zeal,
Love may land me, love may leave me

IT will always be one of my saddest

of a hibernated bluebottle, in a coma-

us say) is of best E.P. silver, stands
2 ft. 9 in. and is heavily illustrated
with what silversmiths call “golfing
scenes.” It would be on my F
sideboard now but for that
bluebottle.
It interfered on the sixteenth
green, when I was one up, in
the semi-final, against Major
Tarbut, who had never been in
a semi-final-before, and was
feeling his position very keenly
—all the more so as he had
played the odd from the edge of
the green and was not nearly
dead, whereas I had a twelve-
foot putt for the hole. While
I was looking at my putt from
the wrong end, because BRAID
always does that, and also
because I was funking it badly,
the bluebottle settled on my ball,
exactly where I ought to hit it.
I gave it time to find out that
a Magenta Dot Minor is not
edible; but it seemed to be
stupefied.
Major Tarbut twiddled his
putter and looked at me im-

the brute won't fly away, I'm
surely entitled to touch it, am
I not 2 ''
“No,” the Major answered,
with decision. “The bluebottle becomes
part of the ball for the time being. If
you touch it, you constructively touch
the ball, and I must claim the hole.”
“Rot, my dear chap!” I said. “This
beastly fly is an agency outside the
match, like a spectator—and I wish to
goodness it wouldn't watch my play
quite so closely.”
“Is a hair-pin an agency outside the
match 2" the Major asked coldly.
“Of course it is,” I said. “But we
are not talking about hairpins. This
is no time for sentimental reverie.”

PARENTHETICALLY (BY JOVE).
Most of us are old enough to remem-
ber the story of the sporting reporter,
unavoidably turned on to the fashionable
wedding, who appended to his other-
wise admirable account of the ceremony
a list of the fascinating bride's rejected
suitors, under the familiar heading,
“Also Ran.” No doubt a similar exi-
gency impelled the handing over of the
recent levee at Buckingham Palace to
a Parliamentary sub-editor of The
Times, who punctuated the description
of each lady's costume by putting in
the names of her dressmaker and
milliner, as they do the constituencies of
the Parliamentary debaters. The effect
of this parenthetical mixture of “art is
art” and “pizness is pizness” was so
pleasing that we understand the idea
is to be continued and extended. Thus
the Thunderer breaks the shackles of
that venerable superstition of Printing
House Square, which regarded any
allusion to feminine apparel as an
irrelevant indelicacy, and shows us the
Spirit of the Age in neat commercial
blinkers. We suggest the following as
a helpful guide for future reference
when describing fashionable functions
in the daily press:—

newcomer (Mangnall's Questions, and

smiling with evident charm (Nodont

elderly but still svelte and slender Lady

agreeable sallies (Punch).”
There can be no doubt that this
at present novel treatment of Court
and fashion news lends piquancy and
charm to an otherwise bald and un-
convincing narrative. It is certain to
become quite a feature of the up-to-
date journalism of the sweet By-and-

IV. —THE BAZAARIANS.
PERSONs of THE PLAY.
A Member of Parliament; his Wife; an Opposition
Candidate; a Messenger; Chorus of Stall-holders and
Buyers of both sexes.
ScENE—A large hall arranged for the purpose of a Bazaar.
MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT.
WHEN first I asked my countrymen to make me an M.P.
Full many were the great affairs that they discussed with me.
| Tariff Reform, the Pension Act, the Publican, the Peer,
Our Navy's wretched weakness and the proper strength of
beer,
On these and many other things they over-taxed my strength
With lists of cunning questions framed at formidable length.
To Cricket Clubs and Football Clubs they forced me to
subscribe -
(Which is a clumsy spelling of the obsolescent “bribe”);
They spoke their mind on corn and coal and candidates
and cars,
But never said a single word to indicate Bazaars.
Yet now, where once I lived at ease, I shudder and suspire;
My days are spent in purchasing the things I least desire.
I smile and pay, and pay and smile, and still I must prepare
To open every new Bazaar and make my pockets bare.
THE WIFE. -
But I, an M.P.'s wife, an M.P.'s daughter,
Take to Bazaaring as a duck to water.
Curbing my thrift, I join in every raffle,
And ride extravagance upon the snaffle.
Last week I bought a coverlet of green,
A kitchen dresser and a boudoir screen,
A picture of my husband done in full size,
A 10-lb. plum cake and a bag of bull's-eyes;
A book on Duels and the force of honour-laws,
Two ties—one new, and one of Mr. BonAR LAw's,
And (of such implements the prince and pith)
A hunting crop once cracked by F. E. SMITH,
HALF CHORUs of STALL-HoldFRs.
Lo, now the stalls are dressed with wares for the selling,
and all is prepared. And behold the crowd is trooping in,
ardent for the purchase. Whence have ye come, ye much-
desiring ones, and with what spoil shall ye return, deceived
and boasting of bargains? For to us last night as we slept
there came a dream, yea, to all of us alike it came and
Hera stood beside us bidding us duplicate the cost of all
things. And to us pondering the word of the goddess is a
wise word.
HALF CHORUs of BUYERs.
For us now the hour of the sacrifice approacheth; yet
are we not afraid, having enough of gold and silver in our
purses. Make ready your stalls, ye that are to sell, yea,
make them ready, for a wild desire of many things useless
is come upon us, and our hands hardly withhold themselves
from the purchase. But, lo, the many-voted, the beloved,
is drawing nigh, he who is all things to most men, but the
envy of the few pursueth him. Let us all, having shouted
loudly, be still and listen to his words of opening.
M.P. O Mr. Mayor, and ye thrice worthy folk,
My duty is to say that this Bazaar
Is, or, when I have finished will be, open—
Opposition Candidate (stepping forward and interrupting):
M.P. Story, forsooth ! Thou pratest foolish things.
O.C. Folly is meant for fools; no fool am I.
Chorus. Shall we not tear the interrupter down,
Who keeps us idle and defers the spoil?
Nay, let him speak, since such a course is best.
Friends, I disclose a dreadful tale of crime.
This man so honoured and so oft acclaimed
Did with fell purpose in his early youth
Maliciously destroy a cricket-batſ
[A general cry of horror arises.
Yea, with a clasp-knife he defaced the bat,
Wreaking his rage upon the willow wood.
Then, piling crime on crime, the bat he took
And thrust it on a burning rubbish-heap.
Nothing emerged save ashes. I have said.
Woe is us, woe, woel Dreadful things we are forced
to hear. Surely the gods were far when this
crime was completed. But now they will punish,
yet we know not how their vengeance will fall.
'Tis true that at the early age of eight—
Who knows what things at such an age betide 2–
'Tis true my father struck me with a bat.
That was his favourite form of punishment,
A good old man, but thoughtless in his wrath.
I being punished knew not what I did, -
And when my father went I took the bat - -
And cut and burnt it in a blazing fire.
[Cries of anger from the multitude.
I had forgotten it, but now I go,
Since there is no forgiveness for such sin.

SPRING AND THE MAN.
YoUNg man, I have news to depress you;
For years you have sat on your shelf,
But now is the time when, I guess, you
Will find that there falls to yourself,
However improperly fitted,
The rôle of the amorous dove
(A rhyme which is rarely omitted
When broaching the topic of love).
She cannot be kept at a distance
Unless you are happily dumb:
A fig for your powers of resistance,
For Spring has undoubtedly come!
And now is your time to be carried
Away by a slip of the tongue,
And find you are booked to be married.
(Young men are so painfully young.)
Ah, when it was snowing and raining,
You practised the arts of restraint,
Nay, dreamt of for ever maintaining
Your methods of tactics and feint.
And “Never,” you said, “will I do it!”
But this a thing which occurs;
The truth is, if only you knew it,
Your laugh, it is boastful and airy,
You venture a sceptical “Pooh!”
You say that you're worldly and wary,
Such things cannot happen to you.
The safety in which you are basking
Is, putting it vulgarly, rot.
My boy, she is yours for the asking,
Nay, whether you ask her or not.
A smile and a couple of kisses -
Will squash you for ever. But there!
So much I forgive you. Yet this is
The worst of the sordid affair :—
Where shame might be fairly expected,
You (such is the poison of Spring)
Will strut as a man who’s effected
A very remarkable thing!
THE SEPARATION.
IT seems only the other day that he
and I first became acquainted with
each other. He was so bright, so
polished, and presented so firm a front
to my gaze, that I took to him at once.
He has long been my bosom friend.
Many a happy social evening have I

thousand natural crushes that flesh
is heir to. He has, of course, occa-
sionally met with reverses; he has,
in fact, been so badly crushed himself
when fulfilling his public engagements
that I have felt sorry for him.
But no one can say that he has not
led a clean and spotless life, and I for
one have never liked “to take him
off" for any slight blemish that
may have appeared in him now and
then; the best of us have our faults,
but the only bad fault I ever found in
him was that at times, perhaps, he
was a trifle too stiff.
And now his day is done. I noticed
a short time back that he was looking
worn and thin. I felt that it was not
fair to compel him to undergo the
rigours of another London season. I
made him stay at home. Alas! he
looks like a rag. I think, in fact, I
shall use him as such.

PUNCH,

OR THE LONDON
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, March
11.-Ulster suddenly smitten with fit
of deep depression. More marked as
following upon burst of high spirits.
Last week PREMIER, questioned on
subject, announced that Welsh Dis-
establishment Bill would be introduced
before Easter, Home Rule Bill rele-
gated to the dark beyond.
Ha! Ha! Ulster saw it all. After
long wrestling with Irish Nationalists
who want everything, and influential
section of Ministerialists who draw a
line at fixed points (notably at control
of Customs), the Minister, all forlorn,
had in despair abandoned self-appointed
task. Introduction of Home Rule Bill
indefinitely postponed.
And here to-day is the PREMIER, in
matter-of-fact tone and manner suitable
to reference to Gas or Water Bill,
announcing that he will submit his
Home Rule scheme immediately on
resumption of brief adjournment for
Easter. -
“There has been no change of plan
by the Government in regard to this
matter,” he quietly added. “The date
I have mentioned is a date always
contemplated and intended by the
Government since the opening of the
session.”
“Imperturbable as ever,” said SARK.
“Reminds me of time when I lived in
the Quartier Latin of Paris, and how,
crossing the Place
du Trône, where
stood the statue of
PHILIP AUGUSTUs,
we used to sing in

Something, brought unwonted tear
to stony Saxon eyes in tribute inci-
dentally paid to native talent of his
countrymen.
Talking about varied form of rifle
trajectory, he said: “In Ireland they
are very good at throwing a stone to
hit a man on the point of his nose or
to break a lamp; but,” added CHARLIE,
drawing himself proudly up to full
height," that was all done with the eye.”
No trajectory needed for your true-
born Irishman when, half a brick in
hand, he desires to blunt the point of
a neighbour's nose.
In course of speech CHARLIE dropped
into charming reminiscence. Person-
ally, he said, he had considerable
experience with the rifle since, fifty-
three years ago, he joined the Service.
Beginning with a sling and a stone and
practising on all the lamps in his own
and adjoining parishes, he next took to
the bow and arrow. Thence passed on
to the old muzzle-loading rifle, the

Whilst regardless of hereditary rank,
caring naught whether one is a Duke's

That is, if he be equal in ability to a
competing commoner.
In NEHEMIAH's narrative of the re-

ing how the Fish Gate was builded,

nobles put not their necks to the work.”
We of this generation have heard

Democracy. “They toil not, neither

When in the Commons exception to

prompt, kindly encouragement. Thus
| TULLIBARDINE, heir to a dukedom
beyond the Tweed, has, more especially
activity at Question Hour. Enlightened
curiosity of late centred upon action
of Treasury in engaging lecturers to
explain intricacies of Insurance Act.
When opportunity presented itself,
TULLIBARDINE joined in chorus of
denunciation of the Act from Opposi-
tion Benches. Occurs to him that
perhaps if he were acquainted with its
provisions and their bearings he might
be in a position to exercise even more
intelligent criticism. Why should he
neglect provided opportunity ?
Accordingly, asks SECRETARY To
THE TREASURY “whether in order that
the public " — note modesty of

obtrude his own personality; it's the
public he's thinking of-" may take
full advantage of the lectures that are
delivered by the experts under the

THE LONG ARM OF COINCI-
DENCE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I feel it is only
fair to myself to tell you how much
more surprising my coincidences are
than The Daily Mail lady's, who is only
interested in sevens, because in my
case there are two remarkable things;
everything is first, and last, too. I am
the first and last child of a first and
last child who was also (probably) a
first and last child, for I believe in
heredity, but cannot trace my grand-
father. I was born for the first and
last time on the first day of the last
month in 1889, a year whose first and
last numbers are the first and last
numbers there can be. (After 9 you
have to begin again, don't you?) The
first and last letters of the alphabet
come in both my first and last names
—Zara Mackenzie—and are the first
and last letters of my first name, and
the first letter is the first and last letter
of my middle name—Ada. I live in
Baselby (pronounced Bazelby), and the
first and last letters of its name are
also the first (but one) and last (but
one) of the alphabet, in the first house
(of any importance), in the last street
(of any size) which Mother let me
change from Beau Site to Zaza Lodge.
In my own snuggery, which is the first
room on your right as you enter the
hall and the last on your left as you
leave it, everything fits into the coinci-
dence. I have pasted up a cunning
frieze of asses and zebras, and insisted
on an Azminster carpet. (X is so near
Z and so uncommon, I let it count.)
I left school (my first and last) when I
first put up my hair, and brushing it
is the first and last thing I do every
day. My first and last uncle (on my
mother's side) came to see us, and he
helped too, for he said it was the first
and last time he'd ever do it, and that
a brewer's house was the first place
you'd expect to find decent beer in
and the last place where you would.
Of course I could make a huge list
of things I've done for the first and
last time; for instance—
Had my twenty-first birthday.
Got a present from my god-parents.
Taten caviare.
Gone roller-skating.

THE BABY GOAT.
Four alders guard a bridge of planks
And waveless waters filmed with
brown,
A rugged lawn's uneven banks
Slope gently down,
And there, still chafing at the chain
That girds his slim pathetic throat,
They’ve picketed our friend again—
The baby goat.
Treading alone the watered vale,
Betsey and I, beside the marsh,
Often we linger to bewail
His durance harsh ;
What plaints allure my baby's feet,
What tethered struggles claim her
sighs,
What shrill protestant whinnies greet
Her long good-byes.
Once we repassed the lonely ground
Below the alders where he feeds
And spied his stunted horns girt round
With flow'ring weeds;
Two merry wenches and a child
And, lolling in the sedge, beguiled
The baby goat.
Now, for long days companionless,
His soft blunt nose, his agate eyes,
His raised remonstrant brows express
The sad surprise
Wherewith the desolate green waste
O'erloads his heart who, at the edge
Of stagnant waters, kneels to taste
The thankless sedge.
His mother is his chiefest lack,
Who in some heathy upland place,
Tidied his sturdy socks of black
And licked his face;
He turns to see us saunter by
The level highway hand-in-hand—
I think the baby goat knows why
We understand.

FRUGALITÉ Ā LA FALLIEREs.
The French journal Gil Blas is re-
sponsible for the announcement that
at the end of his term of office early
next year, President FALLIEREs will,
on leaving the Elysée, go to live in a
small flat of five rooms in the Boule-
vard St. Germain, a cook and a house-
maid sufficing as the staff of this
unimposing residence. - - -
In this the esteemed PRESIDENT is,
aſter all, only reflecting the spirit of
modesty of which our times are re-
dolent. On all hands there is evidence
that the blatant public life of the
twentieth century is telling upon its
victims. Several coal-mine owners
have already unwillingly contemplated
the advantages of the PRESIDENT's
scheme, but more revelative perhaps
are the enthusiastic avowals - that
follow, called from eager adherents to
the Fallières Frugal Fraternity, as the
movement is to be called. . ." -, -º
Mr. Asquith's recent purchase of a
maisonette at Golder's Green, for ex-
ample, is not without due significance.
The PREMIER wishes it to be distinctly
understood, however, that this does not
point to any immediate catastrophe
such as the more sanguine amongst us
might be led to expect.
Sir HERBERT TREE: “For me, quite a
minor blackamoorish palazzo in Venice
will suffice: or perhaps a small but
efficient blasted heath somewhere in
Caithness. I really haven't decided
yet: comé and see me again after the
Second Act.”
Mr. CLEMENT SHORTER: “Yes, I
give you full authority to make the
important announcement: a hut in
Bucks. Kindly add that the biggest,
fattest and brightest of illustrated
papers will, notwithstanding, go on
absorbing all others.”
Mr. BonAR LAw: “Not for a long
time yet. But, if and when, it will be
something unostentatious in the Golf
Pavilion style, with a spacious out-
house for the cold storage of Press
cuttings.”
Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON: “A small
flat? . . . . Yes, I like the paradox.”
Sir Joseph LYONs: “The buzz and
the brilliancy of the Trocadero certainly
pa)ls. Am going caravanning—strictly
ol. the table-d'hôte system through-
out.” - - -
Mr. H. HAMILTON FYFE: “Now that
the age of Miracles is past, have
decided to lie low for a considerable
period.”
Mr. John BURNs: “Fully agree with
you that we live too luxuriously. Am
retiring to a little place in Surrey;
cutting down staff of domestics to
poultry run and only a few motors.
Shall habitually wear only plain Court
dress in future.” - * - - -
… Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT : “I have only
sixteen plays and four hundred and
forty-five commissioned novels to dash
off–then hey for Potter's Bar and
a bed-sitting-room.” A
‘..Mr. WINstos CHURCHILL : “I want
to feel at home after the rush and
struggle of public life. A small shebeen
in the North of Ireland, or furnished
apartments at Brighton, with a good
view of our glorious shipping, will
content me." - -
• THE NEW MOTIVE.
If your country is involved in a
crisis, it is your duty to step round
to your local debating society and
speak out your mind like a man. There
is one of these in our street, and it
fulfilled its appointed share in the
great task of public discussion on
Friday last. One member moved “that
the prevalent unrest, dissatisfaction
and chaos are due to the class hatred
deliberately fomented by the political
aspirant." Another member opposed
this motion, and the rest of us sat
round and looked extremely grave.
We are a well-trained assembly, so
that a speaker had only to , wag his
finger and ask, “What is the cause of
it all, gentlemen?” for us to respond
in a solemn and pessimistic chorus,
“Class hatred ' "
The Suffragists, of course, came in
for some severe and damaging criticism.
One cannot smash thousands of pounds'
worth of windows without incurring
the displeasure and rebuke of the
Wimbledon and West Putney Intellec-
tuals. It was, we felt, our duty to
refer to their outrages, but beneath our
dignity to mention them at the inordi-
nate length which Johnson thought fit
to adopt. To show our disapproval of
him and his subject, we all ceased
looking extremely grave and went to
sleep.
We were woken up by a shouted
string of rhetorical questions, ending
with a general “What, gentlemen,
what, I ask you, is the cause of it?”
“Class hatred ''' we chorused auto-
matically.
“No, gentlemen, Glass hatred 1" and
he sat down not a little pleased with
himself.

WHEN I'm going to town of a morning
Every day I meet ---
Three little girls with grace adorning
The long, grey aisle of a London street
(The Saints be kind to their class-
- ward feet),
And I don't know what their names
- may be,
Never a one of all the three,
So we'll call them A and B and C.
And A's as slim as a willow,
And B's as nice as a bun,
And C's as pretty as sixpence,
And how shall the story run ?
They go in orchard, apple-green dresses
(Best of Pomona's hues),
They wear the sun in their pig-tailed
tresses,
They wear the wind in their walking
shoes;
You wouldn't know which of the
three to choose.
Each of them fresh as an April day,
Each of them bright as a roundelay,
Each of them, C and B and A.
And A's the grace of a princess,
- And B's as sweet as a rose,
• And C, she's pretty as sixpence,
And that's how the story goes
Now that's as far as our knowledge
reaches,
Fancy finds the end,
“Sugar and spice" for all and each is
Always there when it's “Let's
pretend;"
So 'tis settled that Fate 's to send
Sugar and spice to all the three
(Letting them know it comes from me),
Each of them, A and B and C.
And A shall marry a marquis,
And B shall marry a squire,
And C (who's pretty as sixpence)
Whomever her dreams desire!
DYNAMIC ART.
It is very gratifying to learn that the
Italian Futurists who are now flabber-
gasting London with the exhibition of
their works at the Sackville Gallery
will be succeeded during the coming
summer by some even more wildly
sensational Schools of Painting.
These consist of three groups (or
speeds), the Present, the Imperfect, and
the Pluperfect Subjunctivists, all
hailing from the banditti-infested
regions of Sicily, and they will give
their performance at Olympia just after
the horse show. They have thrown
over the obsolete and archaic traditions
of the Futurists, who “stand upon the
summit of the world and cast their
challenge to the stars.”
The Subjunctivists “sit upon the stars
fifteen at the outside; with small
and bite their thumbs at the moon."

MUSIC.
Mr. Punch has great pleasure in
making room for the following profes-
sional notices of eminent musicians.
But, as the subjoined announcements
will sufficiently indicate, the privilege
can be extended only to artists of
established position and widely re-
nowned accomplishments.
MR. Vosper Jowles (Basso), at
liberty for Oratorios, Opera, At Homes,
Bazaars, Cantillations, City Dinners,
Raffles, etc. Fees moderate.
Mr. Vosper Jowles is a sane and
reliable basso. The range of his voice
is colossal, extending from the low
B flat (below the bridge) to the high A
(above the St. Leger nut). His reper-
tory consists of German Lieder, French
Chansons, Italian Canzone and English
songs, ballads and chanties.
. Mr. Vosper Jowles was born in
Vancouver, but has studied in France,
Germany and Italy, as the followin
synopsis will explain :- -
| M. Bouhou HY (600 lessons), Voice
production. - *
M. CÉSAR BLUM (450 lessons), Laryn-
gology. - -
Signor SQUARcio NE (500 lessons), Bel
canto.
Signor ARRigo ProLi'l (200 lessons),
the shake.
Professor MARCU's 13LAss (100 les-
sons), breathing.
Hon. CHARLEs PARSONs, F.R.S.
(correspondence lessons), Hydroplane
song.
Sir JAMEs CRichton-BrowNE (150
lessons), Diet and dress.
Professor QUASIND (6 months), Gym-
nastics and weight-liſting.
Sir H. H. Howorth (3 weeks), the
ethics of controversy.
Professor BEppo DE TRUEFITT, Capil-
lary attraction.
Professor HoRUSAI, Ju-jitsu.
Mr. Vosper Jowles is 6 feet in height,
and his chest measurement, fully ex-
panded, is 45 inches.
SoME PRESS OPINIONs.
The vocalist of the evening was Mr.
Vosper Jowles, a thorough bass of the
first water. Mr. Jowles is fortunate in
possessing a voice of remarkably rare
quality, and he is a reliable expert in
all branches.—Stalybridge Sentinel.
Mr. Vosper Jowles is the happy
possessor of a voice of altogether ex-
ceptional timbre, which he employs
with the requisite verve and gusto.
His songs were “The Diver” (in
costume), which he gave with a volume
of tone that was quite encyclopaedic;
“My Love is a Borstal Girl" (Amy
the Bunny” (Dora Bibby), of which he
gave a magnificentrendition.—Western-
super-Mare Courant.
Mr. Jowles, who made his début last
night, achieved an immediate and
electrifying success. In an Italian
buffo song he displayed a humour that ||
was racy of the Eternal City and
evoked enthusiastic plaudits from the
audience, amongst whom we noticed
Lady Bagge and Miss Dorothy Bagge,
Sir Joshua Dodder, and the Rev. Dr.
Mallaby Stopes.—Chowbent Herald.
Mr. Vosper Jowles has a bass voice
of extraordinary power and penetration.
This is a type which is all the more
pleasing because it is only met with
once in a hundred times. . . . We went
home with his tones ringing in our
ears.-Dunton Green Sentinel.
NASMYTH Tonks, Pianist. Only sur-
viving favourite pupil of RUBINSTEIN.
SoME PREss OPINIONs.
Mr. NASMYTH Tonks's playing is a
boon to all who are hard of hearing.—
The Aurist.
The profile of Mr. NASMyth Tonks
strongly recalls that of Liszt. . . . His
pianistry has a stentorian glamour that
is quite unique.—Cuckfield Sentinel.
Mr. ToNKs's playing of CHOPIN's great
Polonaise in A flat is the richest in
dynamic contrasts that we have ever
heard. He is the JACK Johnson of the
keyboard.—Sidcup Journal.
A chevelure equal to that of PADER-
Ewski in the zenith of his hirsute
efflorescence.—Hairdresser's Gazette.
His butterfly tie is far larger than
Sir HENRY Wood's. . . . The best
dressed pianist since THALBERG.—

Pianist. Sole agents, Concert-direction

SIMPLE ALL AT SEA.
The child lay half asleep—the flames
flickered and kept the shadows dancing
on the wall. He had been ill, and the
days seemed interminable.
Suddenly, out of the twilight a
shadowy castle appeared, and from it
stepped a tiny grey man no bigger
than your hand.
“Boy,” said he, “my name is Simple,
and I have come to find out why you
are so weary. You seem to have kind
rich parents, a doctor to make you well,
and a warm bed to lie in—what more,
then, do you want?”
“I don't want any more,” said the
boy. “I am only tired.”
And as he spoke his mouth drooped
at the corners as if he were about to
“I should like to make you less
tired,” said Simple. “Look what I
can give you to play with ;" and he
went into the castle, and returned with
a small tin soldier, arms stiff and
musket shouldered. *
“What a ridiculous person 1" said
the boy. “He has no colour left on
his uniform and he cannot even move
his arms. Why, I have a complete
regiment of Life Guards in my toy
cupboard, another of Grenadiers, be-
sides about three hundred odd soldiers
of Infantry regiments.” . -
“Perhaps then,” said Simple, rather
sadly, “you would like to see a little
tinder box I have here, from which you
can make real sparks. Think of
that '''
But when the boy saw the tinder
box, he only sneered and said, “I
don't think much of that dirty
old thing. Why, I have a dry cell
battery from which I can work an
electric motor, and my sister's doll's
house has got electric light, besides an
electric lift 1"
“May I show you my boat, then 2"
said Simple. “I have made it of real
newspaper, with a wooden mast, and a
little painted flag at the top. It floats,
too." -
“Thank you for nothing,” said the
boy. “I’ve got a super-Dreadnought
more than two feet long, driven by
electricity—besides two model sub-
marines; and Father has promised me
a toy fire-engine big enough to ride on
for my next birthday, if I promise to
take my medicine without crying.”
“I can think of nothing, then, to
amuse you,” said Simple. “Yes, wait!
There is still Miss Tinsel Roze, whom
you have never seen—the most beauti-
ful dancer in the whole world.”
He opened the door of the castle, and
out tripped the daintiest lady imagin-
able, dressed in pink gauze with a rose
in her golden hair.
“Pooh 1” said the boy, “That! Why,
that is only a silly paper doll! We
have dolls called Kids, with composi-
tion faces, glass eyes with real eyelashes,
who speak and walk. And then we
have the Greedy Gobblers, who open
their mouths and eat—real food
Greedy Chuggy, and Festive Froggy,
and Bunkawala – don't you know
them 2"
“I fear not, my little friend,” said
Simple. “But you seem happier now
than when I came, so I shall leave
you. Good-bye!"
And as he slowly vanished, his
mouth drooped at . the corners as
though he would cry; but the boy
never noticed. He was smiling at the
thought of the ridiculous toys that

WERE it not that Mr. G. W. E. RUssel.L is one of those
distinguished folk indulged by prescriptive literary right in
the dangerous habit of gathering into a volume every now
and again his scattered obiter scripta, I should bring in a
verdict of “wilful bookmaking without extenuating circum-
nay, should add a rider that the circumstances aggra-
vated the guilt in that he has been disingenuous enough to
make occasional pretence of applying the name of chapter
to the quite discrete members of his pleasant, unblushing
miscellany of essays, appreciations, reviews, obituaries,
j'n'sais quois, reminiscential occasional articles and arti-
clettes, in a manner that wouldn't deceive even the elect.
It isn't necessary to say that on this so slender thread of a
title—After-Thoughts—are strung some goodly pearls.
G. W. E. R. has known and written about most of the
know-worthy people for many decades; you have glimpses
of the writer's large-souled enthusiasms and fugitive por-
traits of his friends and heroes and teachers. There is a
notably fine tribute to FREDERICR DENIson MAURICE ; and
of more modern studies there's a jolly sketch of one ToMMY,
three (or four) “chapters” more or less, and a pleasant
letter quoted from his morning budget: “SIR,-We are the

a further volume, One Look Back, announced (shortly) by
the same author, and in spirit I have a vision of him bend-
ing inexorably over the trunk labelled Paulo-Post Impres-
sions, and making no end of this kind of a book and a
little too much of an excellent thing.
I suspect The Woman Hunter (STANLEY PAUL) of being
two books. I fancy that Miss ARABELLA KENEALY, finding
that the story of Nerissa and the Rev. Alan Hartland only
panned out at a hundred-and-thirty printed pages, in-
troduced Clarence Bellairs with the laudable intention of
giving the public—in quantity, at any rate—their four-and-
sixpence worth. Of the two sections the first is the better.
I can swallow Hartland, the ascetic East-end vicar, who
ends his eccentric career in a Trappist monastery. I
do not say I do it easily, but I do it. Friend Clarence,
however, bold, bad, strong, sardonic, passionate Clarence,
straight from the three-volume novels where the Mag-
nificent Ugly Men come from, will not pass. Still, Nerissa
likes him. Of course, in a way he had a sort of claim
upon her. She cannot help remembering that in a previous
existence he had walled her up in an underground chamber
and left her to starve to death. It is these little trifling
acts of personal attention which win a woman's heart.
Clarence remembers the incident too, and has the decency

I was a little sorry. Why, I wonder, should the heroes of

universal that though both Luc and Louis carried it off
gracefully and with as much originality as possible, I

me to state that the authoress does not negotiate the

the substitution of one baby for another, is a trifle antique.
Also there is that little error, already noticed by Mr. Punch,
about Marcus Aurelius jumping into the chasm. But in
extenuation of this let me plead that Antony Doyle (who
was really Antony Moore and a cousin of Kathleen's) was
far too nice and modest a young man to be compared to a
conceited bounder like Mettus (or Mettius) Curtius.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHARADES.
(Communicated by a Charader.)
WE have had a good many “joyments and joicings”
lately. That's what John calls them, and he ought to
know, because he's generally in the middle of them all the
time. He's not very old yet, but he knows a good deal of the
alphabet, and he always makes more noise than all the rest
of us when he's excited. Dad calls him the steam-roller.
Well, first of all, Mr. Bennett came down. We thought
all Members of Parliament had grey hair or bald heads and
were rather fat, but Mr. Bennett has got nice, smooth, fair
hair and pink cheeks, and he's just like a boy. Before he
had been here an hour we made the Fire-fly League. I am
President, and Rosie is Secretary, and Peggy is the
Messenger. We've got lots of rules, and there's going to
be some Fire-fly note-paper, and all our meetings are to be
solemn and secret. John's an honorary member: he may
attend meetings, but he can't vote. Dad and Mum are not
members yet, but they have “the right to pay subscriptions
(one shilling) pending good behaviour.” That's Rule 24.
There was a lot of discussion about Dad and Mum. John
said Mum must be a member, and Peggy wanted Dad, but
Rosie and I voted against them, because, if they were
members, there wouldn't be anybody to keep secrets from.
If Dad talks about the League now, we all say “Hush ' "
and put our fingers on our lips; and the same with Mum.
That's half the fun of it. -
A little later on the same day Mr. and Mrs. Chalmers
came down to stay with us. He's Scotch, and takes salt
with his porridge. He did something for Cambridge a
good many years ago before we were born, but he's
married now, and his wife's name is Muriel. John calls
her Moorel. He's fallen in love with her because she reads
to him. We like her very much too. *~ ! .
After tea it was raining a little, but we hadn't got to
go out again because Dad had taken all the dogs out and
some of us had been sneezing, so Mum said we were to
stay indoors, and if we kept very quiet we could sit in the
Library and not disturb the grown-ups. We began by
being very quiet, but it didn't last long. Mr. Bennett and
Mr. Chalmers got talking about politics, and Mum put in
a word, and then Dad had to say something, and then some.
body said, “Bother politics; let's have some charades,”
and we all yelled for joy and danced about the room, because,
when we're by ourselves, charades are no fun at all, but
when the grown-ups join in they're splendid. Grown-ups
do all the nice silly things that children would like to do
but mustn't, and Dad's generally the worst of the lot.
The first word was “Champagne.” Mr. Chalmers and
Moorel and John and Mr. Bennett stayed to do the guessing,
and the rest of us went out. In the first syllable it was in
the morning, and I was the mother of the family, and Mum
was the old Nurse, and Rosie and Peggy were my daughters,
and Dad was my only son, and it was to be his first day at
school. He said, was he to creep like a snail unwillingly
to school, but Mum said, No, he was to pretend to have a
tooth-ache so as not to have to go to school. That was to
be the sham part of it; so we all went back into the room,
except Mum and Dad, and we began talking about what a
beautiful place school was, and how we hoped that Adolphus
(Dad) would be a good boy and learn his lessons, so that he
could support his mother (me) in my old age. Then Dad
came in leaning on the Nursé (Mum) and howling like any-
thing. He'd got a bath-towel wrapped round his head, and
both his cheeks were swollen out, and he said he'd just got
the most awful toothache. It was in two of his favourite
molars, he said, and he was afraid it was quite impossible
with such a tooth-ache. He said he couldn't do credit to
his dear mother (me) like that, and people would say, “This
boy has not been well brought up; what can his mother
have been thinking about?” So he was going to stay at
home. Then Nurse said that Master Adolphus was a tender
plant, and when tender plants had pain they had it worse
than anyone else. But I said, “Adolphus, why does the
swelling go down when you talk 2 Real swellings stay
there all the time;" and I tore the towel from his head, and
Dad put out his tongue at me and said, “Yah.” So I said,
“Sir, you are a sham;" and ordered him to be flogged by
the Nurse; and that was the end of the first syllable. Mr.
Chalmers said it brought back his young days very vividly,
and he had always thought school was a great mistake.
The second syllable was splendid. Dad was a shopkeeper
in Bond Street, and we were the shop-girls, and Mum was a
Suffragette. First we dressed out all kinds of things on the
sofa in front of the glass door, and Mum came along with a
hammer and smashed the glass. Of course she didn't really
smash it, but Dad seized her and rolled her over on the sofa,
and Peggy trundled a footstool at her, because she is very
much against Suffragettes. Then somebody told John what
it was all about, because he was looking anxious about Mum,
and John cried out, “Votes for cakes! Don't hit her, or only
a little hit, because I want her to read to me;" and Dad
said it was his best window-pane, and he was a ruined man.
* In the whole word we all dined in a restaurant, and Dad
was a French waiter and gave us all champagne. The

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN INLAND VOYAGE.
THOMAS took a day off last Monday
in order to play golf with me. For
that day the Admiralty had to get
along without Thomas. I tremble to
think what would have happened if
war had broken out on Monday. Could
a Thomasless Admiralty have coped
with it? I trow not. Even as it was,
battleships grounded, crews mutinied,
and several awkward questions in the
House of Commons had to be post-
poned till Tuesday.
Something—some premonition of
this, no doubt—seemed to be weighing
on him all day. **
“Rotten weather,” he growled, as he
came up the steps of the club.
“I’m very sorry,” I said. “I keep
on complaining to the secretary about
it. He does his best.”
“What's that ?”
“He taps the barometer every
morning, and says it will clear up in
the afternoon. Shall we go out now,
or shall we give it a chance to stop?”
Thomas looked at the rain and
decided to let it stop. I made him as
comfortable as I could. I gave him a
drink, a cigarette, and Mistakes with
the Mashie. On the table at his elbow
I had in reserve Faulty Play with the
Brassy and a West Middlesex Direc-
tory. For myself I wandered about rest-
lessly, pausing now and again to read
enviously a notice which said that C. D.
Topping's handicap was reduced from
24 to 22. Lucky man
At about half-past eleven the rain
stopped for a moment, and we hurried
out. -
“The course is a little wet,” I said
apologetically, as we stood on the first
tee, “but with your naval experience
you won't mind that. By-the-way, I
ought to warn you that this isn't all
casual water. Some of it is river.”
“How do you know which is which?”
“You’ll soon find out. The river is
so much deeper. Go on—your drive.”
Thomas won the first hole very
easily. We both took four to the green,
Thomas in addition having five splashes
of mud on his face while I only had
three. Unfortunately the immediate
neighbourhood of the hole was under
water. Thomas, the bounder, had a
small heavy ball which he managed to
sink in nine. My own, being lighter,
refused to go into the tin at all, and
floated above the hole in the most ex-
asperating way.
“I expect there's a rule about it,” I
said, “if we only knew, which gives
me the match. However, until we find
that out, I suppose you must call your-
self one up.”
“I shall want some dry socks for
lunch,” he muttered, as he sploshed off
to the tee.
“Anything you want for lunch you
can have, my dear Thomas. I promise
you that you shall not be stinted. The
next green is below sea level altogether,
I'm afraid. The first in the water
wins.” . .
Honours, it turned out, were divided.
I lost the hole, and Thomas lost his
ball. The third tee having disappeared
we moved on to the fourth.
“There's rather a nasty place along
here,” I said. “The secretary was
sucked in the other day, and only
rescued by the hair.” -
Thomas drove a good one. I topped
mine badly, and it settled down in the
mud fifty yards off. “Excuse me,” I
shouted as I ran quickly after it, and I
got my niblick on to it just as it was
disappearing. It was a very close
thing.
“Well,” said Thomas, as he reached
his ball, “that 's not what I call
brassy lie.” -
, “It's what we call a corkscrew lie
down here,” I explained. “If you
haven't got a corkscrew, you'd better
dig round it with something, and then
when the position is thoroughly under-
mined Oh, good shot!”
Thomas had got out of the fairway
in one, but he still seemed unhappy.
“My eye,” he said, bending down in
agony; “I’ve got about half Middlesex
in it.”
He walked round in circles saying
strange nautical things, and my sug-
gestions that he should (1) rub the other
eye and (2) blow his nose suddenly were
received ungenerously.
“Anything you'd like me to do with
my ears?” he asked bitterly. “If
you'd come and take some mud out
for me, instead of talking rot * >
I approached with my handkerchief
and examined the eye carefully.
“See anything?” asked Thomas.
“My dear Thomas, it's full of turf.
We mustn't forget to replace this if
we can get it out. What the secretary
would say There ! How 's that 2"
“Worse than ever.”
“Try not to think about it. Keep
the other eye on the ball as much as
possible. This is my hole, by the way.
Your ball is lost.”
“How do you know?”
“I saw it losing itself. It went into
the bad place I told you about. It's
gone to join the secretary. Oh, no,
we got him out, of course; I keep
forgetting. Anyhow, it's my hole.”
“I think I shall turn my trousers up
again,” said Thomas, bending down to
do so. “Is there a local rule about it 2"
“No; it is left entirely to the dis-
cretion and good taste of the members.
Naturally a little extra licence is
allowed on a very muddy day. Of
course, if Oh, I see. You meant
a local rule about losing your ball in
the mud 2 No, I don't know of one.
Be a sportsman, Thomas, and don't
begrudge me the hole.”
The game proceeded, and we reached
the twelfth tee without any further
contretemps; save that I accidentally
lost the sixth, ninth and tenth holes,
and that Thomas lost his mashie at the
eighth. He had carelessly laid it down
for a moment while he got out of a
hole with his miblick, and when he
turned round for it the thing was gone.
- At the twelfth tee it was raining
harder than ever. We pounded along
with our coat-collars up and reached
the green absolutely wet through.
“How about it 2 ” said Thomas.
“My hole, I think; and that makes
us all square.”
“I mean how about the rain 2 And
it's just one o'clock.” --
“Just as you like. Well, I suppose
it is rather wet. All right, let's have
lunch.”
We had lunch. Thomas had it in
the only dry things he had brought
with him—an ulster and a pair of
Wardon cuffs, and sat as near the
fire as possible. It was still raining in
torrents after lunch, and Thomas, who
is not what I call keen about golf, pre-
ferred to remain before the fire. Per-
haps he was right. I raked up an
old copy of Stumers with the Niblick
for him, and read bits of the Tele-
phone Directory out aloud.
After tea his proper clothes were dry
enough in places to put on, and as it
was still raining hard, and he seemed
disinclined to come out again, I
ordered a cab for us both.
“It's really rotten luck,” said
Thomas, as we prepared to leave,
“that on the one day when I take a
holiday, it should be so beastly.”
“Beastly, Thomas?” I said in amaze-
ment. “The one day ? I'm afraid you
don't play inland golf much 2"
“I hardly ever play round London.”
“I thought not. Then let me tell
you that to-day's was the best day's
golf I've had for three weeks.”
“Golly!” said Thomas. A. A. M.

stop, and refuse to dance unless we
may do any step we like. The band
leaves off playing—there's arbitration
and conciliation—and altogether it's
quite good fun; and finally we all
start off, doing whatever kind of dance
we please. The “Minimum,” first
danced at these “Strike” parties, is
now catching on everywhere.
One of the most-talked-of weddings,
when Lent is over, will be that of
Dickie Sandys, the Ramsgates' girl, to º
the great scientist, Sir Henry Blinker-
ton, the man, you know, who discovered
that water wasn't water, or some fright-
ful thing of that kind.
Dickie's first engagement, you re-
member, to Billy Foljambe was broken
off, and people said her grandmother,
Popsy, Lady Ramsgate, was to blame
—and, indeed, Popsy was engaged to
Billy afterwards for a time. Since
then Dickie's become a problem-
daughter for the old people. She took
to spelling Woman with a big W and
man with a small m; had digs of her
own, and went in for that popular
latter-day performance, living her own
life, in the course of which she's
sometimes been out with the Militants!
A Woman with a big W being an
almost impossible thing for even the
cleverest mother to get off her hands,
Lady Ramsgate is simply immensely
relieved at the prospect of the wedding.
But, dearest, doesn't it seem horribly
sad that a girl who began her career
with such success as Dickie, should
end by marrying a scientific man, and
one who owes everything to his talents
and nothing at all to family? (They
say Sir Henry began life quite at the
bottom of the ladder. Indeed, that he
was one of those fearful boys one gets
so sick of, who walk from somewhere
with bare feet.) Of course it won't be
an “Obey” wedding; and I hear that
quite a novel note will be introduced
by the bridesmaids, carrying dainty
little velvet and gilt hammers, which
they will hold above the bride's head to
form an arch as she goes out. Instead
of flowers, broken glass will be strewn
before her.
Talking of weddings, quite different
arrangements are made for an “Obey”
and a “Won't obey” marriage as to
gowns, decoration of the church, and
the music played. Olga tells me that
for an “Obey” wedding she designs
quiet gracious submissive gowns, while
for a “Won't obey” one she introduces
a note of defiance into the sleeve, and
the hang of the train means “I acknow-
ledge no master!” She was naturally
quite affligée at the Hepburn-Dallamont
marriage fiasco, just before Lent. It
was to have been a “Won't obey”

scription, Jane Hepburn being simply
enormously advanced, while Jimmy
Dallamont is one of the quiet ones
who wants nothing but peace with
honour ! Well, my dear, Olga sur-
passed herself in the bride's and her
maids’ “Won't obey” gowns; the
church was all done in mauve, green
and white, and the organist (Miss
Jones, Mus.Doc.) played them in with
her famous “Woman's March to
Freedom.” And then, my Daphne,
after all, thy bride positively and
actually promised to “love, honour
and OBEY!” An audible smile went
through the packed church, and Miss
Jones, Mus.Doc., left the organ-loft in
a fury and refused to play another
note! The explanation whispered
about afterwards, was that, the evening
she was welcome to leave out “obey,”
but in that case he would leave out
“with all my worldly goods I thee
endow"—and this amounts to some-
thing in Jimmy's case. These quiet
ones often have a bit up their sleeve,
haven't they? Ever thine, -

“The complaints lodged yesterday with the

so well grounded that they could not be ignored,

people who were yesterday left behind by the

what is up to now
comparatively brief
career WINSTON
has suffered a
marked sea change.
He entered politi-

he was welcomed

PRINCE ARTHUR,
not fully recognising possibilities that
have since blazed in the political
firmament, was perhaps a little short-
tempered with the assertive young
man. Some of the rank and file were
positively rude. However it came about,
WINSTON, smarting under crowning
insult when the Ministerialists of the
day greeted his rising by walking out
of the House, one day strolled over to
opposite camp and there remains.
When, after brief interval, his old
friends and companions dear found him
seated on Treasury Bench they deter-
mined to make it hot for him. Dis-
position took Parliamentary form of
pelting him with supplementary
questions and greeting passages of his
speeches with derisive noises. WINSTON
went his way apparently regardless.
He may have felt the arrow points;
be never flinched. Sympathised with in
the matter of annoyance at Question
time, he protested that he rather liked
it; found it useful practice in art of
readiness of fence.
His indifference being disappointing,
and little got out of him in the way of
self-committal, the practice gradually
fell off; it has now ceased. Nevertheless
there remains, as in analogous cases,
notably that of Don José, a spirit of
vexation among former comrades, the
sharper when tinged with regret at loss
of so brilliant a recruit.

WINSTON doesn't

are distasteful to a

can't please everybody. As for CHARLIE

speech, he made frequent reference to
Germany, WINSTON raised his eyebrows,
shrugged his shoulders and murmured,
“Et tu, Charlie?”
His plan of Naval defence summed
up in memorable sentence. “We

meet at our average moment anything
that any possible enemy might hurl
against us at his selected moment.”

to see how when Bonn ER was intent on
pursuing his argument, the hands, un-

Perhaps this little distraction ac-
counted for amazing maladroitness of

were said bogging LEADER OF OPPo-

of steadying notes? However it be,
Labour Members, quick to see oppor-

looked at him one could not but admire. So it was written on the charge-sheet,
the man. Standing there in the
splendour of his muscular prime, his
mighty veined hands clasped in a
quiescent- pose, his great strength
balanced in an attitude of dogged in-
difference, he forced upon the most
casual observer a profound train of
reflection—reflections on the grandeur
of intellect subdued to sinew, of mind
merged in mass.
This man, with the far-off look in
his vitreous eyes, cast upon me that
unspeakable glamour of the criminal
classes. I felt that he was a Power, a
Prime Cause. His presence in the
crowded room made other men appear
small. The personality of magistrate
and clerk faded before this son of
untamed Nature. I mused, as I felt
that all around me must be musing,
upon what this creature might have
been. The soul is the plaything of its
environment. And yet what petty
man-made charge was this brought
in all the narrowness of conventional
phrasing ! How pitifully inadequate
we felt the phrase to be What life-
forees yet unsounded lie behind each

had betrayed him by a sympathy too
restricted for the needs of this massive,
primal, tree-like being. And was no

[MARCH 27, 1912.
AT THE PLAY.
“MILESTONES.”
THE three Acts of Milestones are
dated 1860, 1885 and 1912. Of these
three periods I can only claim to know
the last intimately. I do not regret it;
for this play by Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT
and Mr. Edward KNobDAUCH leaves
me quite contected to belong to the
twentieth century. Superior as I think
the clothes, the hairdressing, the fur-
nishing, and other outward arts of
1912 to those of 1885 or 1860, my
evening at the Royalty convinced me
that the present day showed a still
greater superiority in the matter of
playwriting. Could anything so good
as Milestones have come out of 1885
or 1860? Whether it could or not, it
certainly didn't.
Of course, a dramatist writing in 1912
of events which happened in 1860 can
get considerable advantage from his
later knowledge. When John Rhead
and Samuel Sibley, partners in an iron
works, quarrel over John's vision of a
future in which iron ships take the
place of wooden, the scene is the more
effective from the fact that the audience
knows what the future holds. But this
knowledge must be used with care. It
would not be fair to hold up to mock-
ery every bit of old Toryism which has
gone wrong. The 1906 remarks of the
most progressive of us about aeroplanes
could be laughed at in a 1916 farce.
In this respect the authors show a
proper restraint, they do not work for
the cheap laugh. The lesson that they
are out to teach is not that times
change, but that human nature remains
much the same through it all.
One might almost call Milestones
another “lesson for fathers.” It shows
two families growing from youth to
old age; but the dominating figure
throughout is John Ikhead. I think
the middle-aged and old would do
well to study the development of
Rhead; it would help them to realise
that inasmuch as they are at odds
with the youth of to-day they are at
odds with their own youth of years ago.
The acting was masterly all through.
The players were put to an unusually
difficult test; they had to represent
two, or in some cases three different
people who were yet the same person.
Mr. DENNIs EADIE and Miss HAIDEE
WRIGHT in particular gave remarkable
performances. Miss EvelyN WEEDEN
only appeared in two Acts. She was
the image of a DU MAURIER girl in 1885,
! and quite the modern mother in 1912.
| In both scenes she acted finely. But,
indeed, all the acting was good; 1912
has nothing to learn from any other
My heartiest thanks to the authors
for writing and to Messrs. VEDRENNE
and EADIE for producing this play.
A new curtain-raiser at the Hay-
market gave wiser people than myself
an excuse for seeing Bunty Pulls the
Strings for the 300th time. I took the
opportunity of seeing it for the first
time. If there is anybody else in
London or the provinces as careless
of true art and humour as I had
shown myself to be up to last Tues-
day, then let him take warning from
this. I fear I have neglected Bunty
too long to have any right to praise
her now, but I should be very sorry not

her friends gave me the happiest
evening I have ever spent in a theatre.
THE SPRING PURVEYOR.
YoU may not have observed it, but
Spring has not come this year. I ig-
nore your boastings about your gardens.
I maintain that a glance at your daily
paper will show you that spring is not
here. Are the robins building in pillar-
boxes 2 Are the hop-shoots growing
at the rate of six inches per day?
Where is the tree-pipit? And the reed-
bunting? You surely have missed the
reed-bunting! What has become of
the barred umber moth ? Is the tooth-
wort in flower 2 Has the mole-cricket
churred 2
You must admit that you don't know.
Why? Because the coal-strike has
crowded me out. There is no room for
the purveyor of spring. For years I
have heralded to you the coming of the
hundreds of my bright little pars about
the reed-bunting as you whirled through
the Tube to business. How often have
you read in March, “Walking in my
garden this evening I was delighted to
hear the cheerful churring of the mole-
cricket—surest sign of the advent of
Spring.” You shared my uncertainty
as to whether the mole-cricket were
bird, beast or insect, but you must
admit that little par gave you a whiff
of the country and made you think
about buying a new straw hat.
And now the editors send back the
tree-pipit, the barred umber moth, and
even the reed-bunting (this is the
unkindest cut of all, for the reed-bunt-
ing has paid my rates for years), and
demand something topical. I am re-
duced to this lamentable style of nature
note:– -
THE STRIKE IN THE CountRY.
Residents in the Fen districts view
the prospect of a coal shortage with
comparative calm. Acres of dry reeds
—the choice resorts of the reed-bunt-
ing—are being cut, and, after being
stacked for a time, make an excellent
household fuel.
One is uncertain whether to attri-
bute to the prevalent labour unrest the
fact, vouched for by more than one
naturalist, that the neck of the wry-
neck is wryer than ever this season.
New varieties of fuel are in great
request, and more than one naturalist
has suggested that the oil-beetle (Cara-
bus), so common in country lanes at
this season, might be used for heating
purposes. Provided that a sufficient
uantity could be obtained there is no
doubt that the oil in this variety of
beetle would possess excellent burning
qualities.
The growth of the hop-shoots in my
garden—one increased 5'432 inches
yesterday—reminds one that refuse
hops treated with 3 per cent. of their
weight in petroleum make a very hot
fuel, suitable for bakers' ovens.
The churring of the mole-cricket as
it burrows in the ground—surest sign
of the advent of spring—makes one
hope that we shall soon hear the cheer-
ful song of the miner as he proceeds to
his underground burrowing. [Perhaps
a little far-fetched, but the mole-cricket
has been a faithful friend to me for so
long, and I will not desert him in his
hour of trial.] The destruction of a
large number of old pollard trees for
fuel in the country districts makes one
doubt whether the tree-pipits will find
sufficient building accommodation. It
would indeed be one of the saddest
results of the industrial unrest if it re-
sulted in the destruction of this most

THE GARDENER'S CAT.
THE gardener's cat's called Mignonette,
She hates the cold, she hates the wet,
She sits among the hothouse flowers
And sleeps for hours and hours and
hours.
She dreams she is a tiger fierce
With great majestic claws that pierce,
She sits by the hot-water pipes
And dreams about a coat of stripes;
And in her slumbers she will go
And stalk the sullen buffalo,
And when he roars across the brake
She does not wink, she does not wake.
It must be perfectly immense
To dream with such magnificence,
And pass the most inclement day
In this indeed stupendous way.
She dreams of India's sunny clime,
And only wakes at dinner-time,
And even then she does not stir
But waits till milk is brought to her.
How nice to be the gardener's cat,
She troubles not for mouse or rat,
But, when it's coming down in streams,
She sits among the flowers and dreams.
The gardener's cat would be the thing,
Her dreams are so encouraging;
She dreams that she's a tiger, yet
She's just a cat called Mignonette!

IT is interesting to note what will
cause a sensation to-day, by reason of
its novelty, in this country. A Labour
Member caused one in the House of
Commons last week by stating that
one's citizenship ought to be higher
than one's trade-unionship, and with
him it would be.
Mr. KING, who has been writing in

THE FAITH FUL TRUANT.
THERE are who love—I love them too—
The golden borders of the tideless sea,
The sudden glint of sapphire blue
Where the way winds by little hollowed coves;
And pine-woods folded in the lee
Of the red hills that laugh on Walescure,
And green of Menton's terraced olive-groves,
And all that Teuton-haunted Côte d'Azur.
And there are those—my taste is theirs
(In moderation)—who delight to mote
From Monte up to purer airs,
By Agel's beetling zigzag, full of tricks:
Or from Castillon's eyrie float
To far Sospello's watered vale—and all
To play their homely game of pills and sticks,
Which lacking, Paradise itself would pall.
Some praise Provence, and so do [.
Avignon likes me, that superb retreat
Of Holiness in exile, high
Over the flood-rent bridge whose ancient floor
Rang to the circling danse's beat; *
And Arles, whose women stole her conqueror's heart,
And Nimes where none but Vandals may ignore
The fierce mosquitos and the IRoman's art.
Give me the Languedoc vineland soil,
Russets and roans and browns and velvet greys,
Whose mirth already counts the spoil
Of Autumn's purple vats—you never guessed
The earth could smile so many ways;
And, at the road's end, as the dusk comes on,
Sudden and stark against a fiery west
The towers and bastioned walls of Carcassonne !
But best I love—or, if I don't,
I ought to—London at the first of Spring,
To-day less grimy than her wont -
Thanks to the mine-strike. Home from those fairlands
Which I have sought (above) to sing,
For London still must glow this patriot soul,
As yonder ash to which I stretch my hands,
Being my last lone lump of kitchen coal.

A KING IN EXILE.
. It was at the Zoo that I had the honour of meeting His
Majesty the King Penguin. When I first saw him, he
was standing, absorbed in meditation, by the margin of the
Sea-lions' Pool. He held his pinions slightly behind
him, and his general attitude, together with his pearl-grey
coat and somewhat protuberant white waistcoat, was, as
I suspect he was fully aware, quite strikingly suggestive
of the Emperor NApolfoN at St. Helena.
The larger Sea-lion was lying on an overhanging rock,
endeavouring by incessant barks to convey to its Keeper,
just then engaged in conversation with a fellow-official,
that the Public (represented by me on this occasion) would
be highly gratified by witnessing the agility with which it
could catch fish.
This behaviour evidently struck King Penguin, who
enjoys a fixed allowance from Government of twenty-four
restraint. He regarded the Sea-lion with a half-shut
supercilious eye. -
Presently the Keeper approached the enclosure, and the
unseemly haste with which both Sea-lions wallowed
through the water and flopped open-mouthed towards the
bars still further disgusted their royal fellow-captive. It
is true that King Penguin also made a forward movement,
but this was merely in gracious recognition of a favourite
retainer. He would rather have starved than sue to him
for fish ' -
Ignoring the Sea-lions' importunities, much to King
Penguin's satisfaction, the Official inquired if I would like
to be presented to His Majesty, an offer which I of course
accepted, though not without secret misgivings as to the
manner of my reception. So I was taken through a gate,
and instructed to remain at the end of a path until the
ex-Monarch was headed and turned in my direction. His
advance was leisurely, which gave me time to note the
brilliancy of his canary-yellow gills, the effective patch of
salmon-red on his under-i)eak, and the rich orange glow
that flushed his throat, and faded into warm ivory-white on
his imposing paunch. He turned his head from side to side
as he walked, with an interest in every other object but
myself that was perhaps intended to impress me with a
sense of my own utter insignificance. If so, I can only say
it succeeded. His gait would be even more majestic but
for a slight tendency on the part of the royal toes to turn
in, from which one might infer that he has spent a con-
siderable portion of his earlier life in the saddle.
As he drew nearer, I hastened to make way for him with
a deference that I trust escaped servility, and soon he stood
before me, every inch a king, in his commanding stature of
well over three feet. But he made no effort to put me at
my ease, and my embarrassment became still more painful
when his Custodian joined us, and, after instructing me to
remove my right glove, invited me to test the softness of
His Majesty's back. I did so—tentatively, because this is
a liberty one would hardly venture upon with even a fallen
potentate. Still I can testify that the royal back is
deliciously downy. I daresay I should have gone on strok-
ing it longer had I not received an intimation from the
ex-Monarch's beak—it was a long sharp beak—that he
desired these familiarities to cease. They ceased im-
mediately, and he remained aloof and impassive, while his
attendant gave me a few leading facts from the King's

I learnt that he was a widower, his consort having
passed away during the voyage from his Antarctic realm,
a bereavement which he is said to have felt acutely.
But, if I may judge from his expression, I should say that
Time's consoling hand has already healed the blow, and
that His Majesty would be fully prepared to offer his
pinion en secondes moces to any Penguin princess who was
at all eligible. Unfortunately, although there are several
other Penguins on the premises, they are all undersized
plebeian birds, so infinitely beneath his notice that he has
never yet betrayed the slightest consciousness of their
existence. They are democratic little beggars, however,
and do not seem to care a hang whether he knows them
or not. - -
At this stage of the interview there was a regrettable
misunderstanding which I feared at one time would bring
it to an untimely close. The King Penguin suddenly con-
ceived the idea that he had been grossly insulted by my
umbrella, an unassuming accessory who, I hope I need
hardly say, is absolutely incapable of any impropriety.
Hardly had I concluded my apologies before he showed an
equally unreasonable annoyance with my overcoat. It

seems he has a confirmed dislike to any object that flaps

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN 0PINION OF THE CRISIS.
CHARLEs looked up from his desk,
littered with papers, as Our Represent-
ative entered his chambers. “You
want, I take it,” he said, “a few words
from me upon the present dispute, to
lay before the readers of your great
paper?”
Our Representative explained that
items of news were for the moment
scarce, and that individual opinions
were needed to supplement them.
“And why,” asked Charles, seeking
flattery, “have you selected me?”
“We have come to the end of
the leading men. . . If I might
ask you to express a view, I
shall hope to reproduce it in
to-morrow's issue in a notice-
able paragraph. If you could
happen to hit on a felicitous
phrase, expressing in a short
form what our readers would
themselves like to think, I shall
put it in heavy type and mix it
up with the headlines.
“The darkest hour,” began
Charles, after a little thought,
“is that which precedes the
dawn.”
“Quite; but we have had
that already.”
“Well then, on the whole I
am of opinion that the proba-
bilities are ->
“If possible, kindly avoid
prophesying. So many have
tried it and have been shown
to be wrong, even before they
had time to be forgotten.”
“And first,” resumed Charles,
not to be defeated, “a little
about myself.”
Our Representative smiled.
“Is that inevitable 2"
“My dear Representative,”
Charles began.
“Our Representative,” I cor-
rected.
“Singularly enough,” said Charles,
“I have myself just been through a
crisis in my affairs which, though on
rather a larger scale and of further-
reaching results, is yet comparable to
the present struggle in the industrial
world. I tried every means of checking
the rise of the malcontents and reducing
the revolt, but in the end I was driven
to the very last resort. It started, in
quite a small way, with a pair of sleeve-
links—the unintelligible and never ex-
plained grievance of one link, in fact.
But it takes a little thing to cause a
complete chaos in the clothes world,
for the relations between the wearer
and the wearee are always strained.”
“You mean,” I said, “that you are

“The things that one wears are ready
always at a moment's notice to
combine against one, providing the
opportunity is favourable. At the
moment to which I refer I was dress-
ing for a dinner-party, and had allowed
rather too short a time for the purpose.
I was at the mercy of my clothes.
Now, I am not suggesting that there
was any conspiracy or premeditated
plan amongst them; indeed, I incline to
think that that link refused to go
through its proper hole out of pure
cussedness and idleness. Unwisely, I
tried to force it to do its work, and
my reach, and the other link almost
immediately joined it. The spare links,
of which I keep a supply, supported
the strikers by withdrawing secretly
from the receptacle in which they live
and being nowhere discoverable. I real-
ised then that a sectional strike was in
full swing, and I made my next mistake
by endeavouring to import foreign and
blackleg labour, instead of settling with
the section on terms. Merely to protect
my own interests Itied up my cuffs with
string, but one is not allowed to protect
one's own interests nowadays. That I
should even attempt to do so was the
signal for a sympathetic strike,
to the magnitude of which the

showed it that I was in some way
dependent on it. Thereupon the
matter at once became a grievance.
Metaphorically, that link threw down
its tools and left work; in actual fact,
it departed under the chest-o'-drawers,
not because it liked being there, but in
order to annoy me. Had I kept my
temper and ignored it, the matter

to your clothes and there was

optimistically.
“It was not confined to my

to the winds. For mark you,
it was a safety razor.”
“And what was the net result,

I asked, to bring the matter to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE THINGS THAT MATTER.
RoNALD, surveying the world from his
taxi-that pleasant corner of the world,
St. James's Park—gave a sigh of hap-
iness. The blue sky, the lawn of
daffodils, the mist of green upon the
trees were but a promise of the better
things which the country held for him.
Beautiful as he thought the daffodils,
he found for the moment an even greater
beauty in the Gladstone bags at his
feet. His eyes wandered from one to
the other, and his heart sang to him,
“I’m going away—I'm going away
—I'm going away.” * -
The train was advertised to go at
2.22, and at 2.20 Ronald joined the
Easter holiday crowd upon the platform.
A porter put down his luggage and was
then swallowed up in a sea of perambu-
lators and flustered parents. Ronald
never saw him again. At 2.40, amidst
some applause, the train came in.
Ronald seized a lost porter.
“Just put these in for me,” he said.
“A first smoker.”
“All this lot yours, Sir?”
“The three bags—not the milk-cans,”
said Ronald.
It had been a beautiful day before,
but when a family of sixteen which
joined Ronald in his carriage was
ruthlessly hauled out by the guard, the
sun seemed to shine with a warmth
more caressing than ever. Even when
the train moved out of the station, and
the children who had been mislaid
emerged from their hiding-places and
were bundled in anywhere by the
married porters, Ronald still remained
splendidly alone . . . and the sky took
on yet a deeper shade of blue.
He lay back in his corner, thinking.
For a time his mind was occupied with
the thoughts common to most of us
when we go away—thoughts of all the
things we have forgotten to pack. I
don't think you could fairly have
called Ronald over - anxious about
clothes. He recognised that it was the
inner virtues which counted ; that a
well-dressed exterior was nothing
without some graces of mind or body.
But at the same time he did feel
strongly that, if you are going to
stay at a house where you have
never visited before, and if you are
particularly anxious to make a good
impression, it is a pity that an accident
of packing should force you to appear.
at dinner in green knickerbockers and
somebody else's velvet smoking-jacket.
Ronald couldn't help feeling that he
had forgotten something. It wasn't
the spare sponge; it wasn't the extra
shaving-brush; it wasn't the second
pair of bedroom slippers. Just for a
as he wondered if he had included the
reserve razor-strop; but no, he distinctly
remembered packing that.
The reason for his vague feeling of
unrest was this. He had been inter-
rupted while getting ready that after-
noon; and as he left whatever he had
been doing in order to speak to his
housekeeper he had said to himself,
“If you're not careful, you'll forget
about that when you come back.” And
now he could not remember what it was
he had been doing, nor whether he had
in the end forgotten to go on with it.
Was he selecting his ties, or brushing
his hair, or i
The country was appearing field by
field; the trains rushed through cut-
tings gay with spring flowers; blue was
the sky between the baby clouds . .
but it all missed Ronald. What could
he have forgotten ? -
He went over the days that were
coming; he went through all the
changes of toilet that the hours might
bring. He had packed this and this
and this and this—he was all right for
the evening. Supposing they played
golf? . . . He was all right for golf.
He might want to ride. . . . He
would be able to ride. It was too
early for lawn tennis, but . . . well,
anyhow, he had put in flannels.
As he considered all the possible
clothes that he might want, it really
seemed that he had provided for every-
thing. If he liked he could go to church
on Friday morning; hunt otters from
twelve to one on Saturday; toboggan
or dig for badgers on Monday. He had
the different suits necessary for those
who attend a water-polo meeting, who
play chess, or who go out after moths
with a pot of treacle. And even, in
the last resort, he could go to bed.
Yes, he was all right. He had
packed everything; moreover, his hair
was brushed and he had no smut
upon his face. With a sigh of relief he
lowered the window and his soul drank
in the beautiful afternoon. “We are
going away—we are going away—we
are going away,” sang the train.
At the prettiest of wayside stations
the train stopped and Ronald got out.
There were horses to meet him.
“Better than a car,” thought Ronald,
“on an aſternoon like this.” The
luggage was collected—“Nothing left
out,” he chuckled to himself, and was
seized with an insane desire to tell the
coachman so ; and then they drove off
through the fresh green hedgerows,
Ronald trying hard not to cheer.
His host was at the door as they
arrived. Ronald, as happy as a child,
jumped out and shook him warmly by
the hand, and told him what a heavenly
pleasure the news in return that it was
almost like summer.
“You’re just in time for tea. Really,
we might have it in the garden.”
“By Jove, we might,” said Ronald,
beaming.
However, they had it in the hall,
with the doors wide open. Ronald,
sitting lazily with his legs stretched
out and a cup of tea in his hands, and
feeling already on the friendliest terms
with everybody, wondered again at the
difference which the weather could
make to one's happiness.
“You know,” he said to the girl on
his right, “on a day like this, nothing
seems to matter.”
And then suddenly he knew that
he was wrong; for he had discovered
. . what it was which he had told himself
not to forget . . . what it was which
he had indeed forgotten.
And suddenly the birds stopped
singing and there was a bitter chill
in the air.
And the sun went violently out.

fully depleted for the occasion by Sir
Alfred Bruno, the owner of Washing-
ton House. Lady Bruno, who looked
handsome in a flame-coloured dress
embroidered with fluorescent bascules,
presided over the Literature stall with
her wonted bonhomie, and disposed of a
vast number of her husband's leaflets,
“Why I cannot be a Syndicalist" and
“The Economics of Truth.”
Lady Budley, who wore a black
velvet coal-scuttle bonnet covered with
a priceless old lace mob cap, with a
trellis of diamonds crossing her gold-
brocaded skirt, worked indefatigably
in disposing of a gross of corduroy
waistcoats. Lady Nutley Custard pre-

the Marchioness Pengwyn took charge
of the Café Chantant, where she was
assisted by Captain Goggin, R.N., Miss

THE BOAT STRIKE.
(A foreboding for next year.)
MoRE DELAY.
GLooMY TURN To THE CRISIs.
IT is now three weeks since the men
“downed oars.” Is to-day to be
another wasted day in the long history
of the Boat Strike—the Selfish Strike
which is fast promising to be the Ruin
of the Race?
The outlook for settlement by agree-
ment is considered almost hopeless.
Cambridge definitely refuses to con-
cede the principle of the Minimum
Weight, and Oxford insists that “5”
and “2" should be included in their
boat.
CoNFERENCEs.
The members of the O.U.B.C. met
this morning at the Westminster Palace
Hotel to see if some agreement could
not be reached on the “narrowed
points of difference.” No statement
was issued to the Press. The repre-
sentatives of the C.U.B.C. met at the
same time, and the friendliest feeling
prevailed. To the man on the tow-
path a Minimum Weight of 10 stone
for an oarsman (on a sliding seat) does
not seem unreasonable, and there is
little doubt that year in year out the
majority do as a matter of fact weigh
more than the minimum.
Cambridge, however, is adamant on
the point of principle, and Oxford
equally so on the inclusion of “5” and
“2,” and so the deadlock goes on.

Mr. S. D. MUTTLEBURY (Old Cam-

UNDER-SECRETARY of WAR makes
timid answer to effect that Sergeant-
Instructor at this school has always
been a Catholic, and that suitable pro-
vision was elsewhere made for the
convert. CHARLEs CURtice obliged to
accept answer for moment; but more
will be heard of the matter.
Business done.—The Suffragette
though in prison yet speaketh. Last
year, Bill designed to bestow suffrage
upon women, read second time with
overwhelming majority of 167. To-day,
the House, having meanwhile had fresh
and fuller experience of what happens
when Lovely Woman stoops to politics,
throws out the same measure by
majority of 14. Thus are the shop
windows in the Strand and further
West avenged. Decision the more
significant since in exceptionally
crowded House division was taken
after unloosing of Party bonds.
Friday.—Curious how an incident
sent it on to the wakeful Lords.
Business done.—Coal Conference
finally broken down, Mines Bill read
a third time by 213 votes against 48.
Thursday.—CRAIG (not the gallant
| Captain, but CHARLEs CURTICE, Member
for South Antrim) has unearthed fresh
iniquity on part of a banal Government.
Appears that, a vacancy presenting it-
self in office of Sergeant-Instructor at
the Royal Hibernian Military School,
Dublin, Colour-Sergeant H. Moore
applied for and was appointed to the
post, being, CHARLEs CURTICE says, “at
the time a Roman Catholic."
Phrase seems to suggest avowedly
temporary condition of religious con-
viction. Odd on the face of it ; turns
out to be justified by result. According
to CHARLEs CURTICE’s interesting nar-
rative Colour-Sergeant MooRE entered
|
upon his duties on 25th May, 1910.
On the 1st November, 1911, “having
in the meantime become a Protestant,”
he received notice terminating his
engagement. “In the meantime,” in-
definite in point of date, subtly conveys

leads to grave issues. Take for example
the little affair of Isa AC NEwToN and
the apple. Had Is AAC not happened to
be under a certain tree at a particular
moment when the apple was ripe to
fall, we might to this day, ignorant of
bearings of Law of Gravitation, been
wondering how we can keep our feet
through space at reckless speed. In
| a way it's the same with LANE-Fox
and those thirteen pigs, late resident
on the farm of Mr. DoDSON of Sprot-
borough.
It was so far back as August that
these pigs with a weird history first
strayed within ken of Member for
Barkston Ash, West Riding. When-
ever, as not infrequently happens, LANE-
Fox trots them out—or, to be more
precise, invokes their wraiths—the
House, possibly discovered in moment
of lethargy, displays keenest interest.
Whether from cultured art or casual
oversight LANE-Fox is always distantly
allusive in his reference to details in
the career of the pigs. As Jeames's
birth was “wropped in a mistry,” so
the death of the Sprotborough pigs
—if indeed they be dead—is enveloped
in haze. LANE-Fox's most precise
reference is found in the phrase “re-
ported to have died or been destroyed
or buried.” Whether he knows more
and is desirous of sparing the House
a shock is a secret he will carry back
with him in brief Easter Recess to the
Barkston Ash Division, West Riding.

ELEGANTIAE ARBITRI.
THE weavers of France have been
earnestly appealing to the modistes and
élégantes of Paris to stop the rot in the
matter of skirts. It appears that the
continued success of the hobble and the
semi-hobble has so restricted the use
of textile material that the manu-
facturers are sighing for the old days
and the amplitude of the bustle. The
dressmakers show signs of giving in,
and other trades are taking advantage
of this example to carry out long con-
templated reforms.
Thus, a deputation of Genoese silk-
worm breeders have lost no time in
calling upon the Hon. Algernon
Chumley, whose revival of the cotton
neck-tie burst like a thunder-cloud
upon the beaux of Bond Street a few
weeks ago. The Hon. Algernon, who
received the deputation at his chambers,
took up a firm attitude, although the
interpreter made it quite clear that his
fiat had paralysed one arm of the silk-
trade and that several hundreds of the
more highly-educated silk-worms had
been prostrated with hemicrania since
receiving the news. On the under-
standing that the deputation, which
diffused a strong flavour of garlic
through the apartment, should at once
take its leave, the Hon. Algernon
agreed to a compromise. Silk neck-
ties are now correct on Tuesdays and
Saturdays, Saints' Days excepted.
Lady Lobelia Hogge, whose clever
inspiration has made the wearing of
brass earrings one of the crazes of 1912,
is, it is stated, largely responsible for
the serious depression in the gold pro-
duction of the last month. There is
no truth in the report that brass tiaras
are to be worn during the forthcoming
Opera season, but a prominent South
African financier has astutely sub-
mitted a sheaf of statistics and samples
of gold quartz in various stages of
trituration to Mr. LLoyd GEORGE for
consideration. It has not yet been
ascertained whether the CHANCELLOR
is partial to brass, though grave doubts
are entertained. -
The announcement, in last Thurs-
day's daily papers, that anchovy sand-
wiches are no longer de rigueur at
ecclesiastical tea-parties, roused trepid-
ation approaching panic among the
Our Boutºuler. “CoMIN(; To T11 E FootBALI

littoral. The popular Bishop who was
supposed to have started the fashion
has, however, set these fears at rest in an
interview. “The whole affair is quite
a misunderstanding,” he assured his
questioner. “A young curate passion-
ately devoted to anchovies came early
to my tea-party and consumed all the
available stock of sandwiches before
the more noteworthy and less greedy
guests arrived. Please reassure the
anchovy-growers. I have already
cabled to them my heart-felt regrets
that anything of the kind should have
occurred.” The denial of the veto has
been received with some mortification
in the bloater-paste suburbs of Yar-
mouth and among the cucumber-
framers of Kent.
The manufacturers of British boot-
uppers have joined forces with the
designers of sock-clocks in a strong
protest against the prevalence of the
spat. “These barbaric articles of
wear,” runs a paragraph in one of the
of a remote and savage fashion, and
their insane vogue is coming near to
ruining an industry of sterling worth
and an art of which the finest examples
are comparable only to the superb
decorative masterpieces of the great
screen-painters of China. We can only
await the return of the public mind to
a state of reason. Meantime we are
glad to announce, over 20,000 persons
have already signed the “I renounce
Spats' form which will be found
attached.”

CH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
PUNCH,
THE UNIVERSAL ARBITRATOR.
THE proposals of Mr. HALL CAINE
for terminating the hostilities between
Italy and Turkey, though they have
been courteously discussed by the
Italian press, have, as The Daily
Telegraph informs us, failed to com-
mend themselves to the authorities.
But we have good reason to believe
that Mr. HALI, CAINE has been im-
mensely encouraged by the moral
victory of his failure to negotiate peace
—a victory demonstrated by a pro-
fusion of interviews with and, above
all, portraits of the famous Manx
fictionist—and that he is continuing
his tour as Grand Pacific Plenipo-
tentiary with prodigious and resound-
ing results.
Thus, on his arrival at Palermo, he
at once despatched a peremptory sum-
mons to the famous bandit chief,
Signor Niccolo VEcchio, in which
he propounded the following scheme
for the voluntary winding up of brig-
andage in that beautiful island.
1. All brigands, on handing over their
arms, to be presented with a copy of
The Eternal City.
2. All brigands, on taking an oath
not to molest, waylay or rob travellers,
to be presented with a free pass en-
titling them to be shown over Greeba
Castle and grounds.
3. If the brigands should fail to
comply with these terms, Mr. HALL
CAINE is unable to guarantee that he
will ever visit Sicily again.
We regret to learn that, after a pro-
tracted conference, at which Mr. HALL
CAINE addressed the leading brigands
in a speech which lasted several hours,
his
proposals were enthusiastically
declined, and a resolution was passed
declaring that Mr. Robert Hich ENs,
the author of The Call of the Blood,
was the greatest British novelist.
Mr. CAINE was greatly prostrated on
hearing the decision, but by an heroic
effort recovered his strength sufficiently
to embark for Alexandria on the follow-
ing day.
On his arrival at the landing-stage
Mr. HALL CAINE at once despatched
a telegram to Lord KITCHENER, who,
by an extraordinary oversight, had
failed to meet him. The contents of
the telegram have not yet transpired,
but it is believed that it conveyed a
grave rebuke to the British Agent-
General. It is pleasant to learn, how-
ever, that the native population did all
in their power to remedy this official
neglect, and Alexandria was soon given
over to tamashas, fantasias, jamborees,
and other demonstrations of delight.
A deputation of Young Egyptian
Mr. HALL CAINE as their most fearless
and influential representative in Eng-
land, waited on the illustrious visitor,

despatched an ultimatum to Lord
Kitch ENER, which may be thus briefly
summarised :—
1. No new Pyramids to be erected

2. Cleopatra's Needle to be at once
returned to Egypt.
3. No donkey-boys in future to
receive permits unless or until they
can draw a map of the Isle of Man
indicating the exact whereabouts and
area of Mr. HALL CAINE’s estate.
4. In case of bad seasons the
Egyptian Government to guarantee the
gratuitous distribution of Mr. HALL
CAINE’s photographs to the distressed
fellaheen.
5. Mr. HALL CAINE to have priority
of access to the KHEDIVE's audience-
chamber over all officials.
Incredible as it may appear, Lord
KITCHENER—so we are informed—
returned a distinctly unsympathetic
reply, through Sir RUDOLF SLATIN, to
these singularly temperate proposals.
Mr. HALL CAINE, who was at first
desperately unhinged by the turn which
events had taken, soon rallied, and,
according to latest advices, had just
despatched a powerful cablegram to
the Board of Control in Australia,
threatening to join the team as umpire

HILL were promptly conceded.
A Canadian emigration official, writ-
ing in The Daily Erpress and referring

the sort I should have thought you
would be just crazy to keep in your

his devoted attendance on his invalid father does not bear
inspection. It may have been slavery, but it was un-
commonly luxurious slavery ; and, though Mr. MAxwell,
with infinite skill avoids giving his casting-vote one
way or the other, the reader is left with the impression
that, if filial devotion had not been supplemented by a large
allowance, snug quarters, and the worshipping admiration
of all Westchurch, Lenny might have been far less firmly
attached to the side of that bath-chair. And yet, super-
ficially, he is such a good fellow, the sort of man who might
well seem almost ideal to a not too close friend. His sins
are entirely negative. He has good, even noble, intentions,
but his soul is too flabby for the effort of carrying them out.
In fact, Mr. MAxwell, has put enough of the ordinary, well-
meaning man into him to make almost any reader start
perchance he himself may find that “within the packing of
cotton-wool all the best of the man has perished, and only
the husk of a man remains.”

enough little idyll, if a trifle over sentimentalised, about
a girl who consoles herself for a long and possibly fatal
illness by talking to a young man whom she only knows by
sight. The second is a sort of burlesque on the possibilities
of the idea, and represents the author himself as playing
the old part of Cyrano on behalf of a bashful young
cricketer. Myself, I think that Mr. Roberts's real forte is
the delineation of the flapper, several samples of which

a rather original Cockney house-breaker in the first story;
but in the last, which is entitled “A Drama in Venice,” the

rate, he entirely fails to convey to me that sense of a
powerful emotional situation which he presumably intended
to produce. By the way, to avoid all confusion, I ought
to say that the title of this book has no reference at all to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I am not sure that Mr. R. H. GRETToN hasn't made, in
Almayne of Mainfort (GRANT RICHARDs) the single mistake
of a little overestimating the objective interest of the
mystery of the Almayne-Warburton Estates. At any rate
it is by no means the significant thing in an exceedingly
attractive book. That significance lies rather in a rare
note of distinction in the style, a faculty of precise
observation, a reserve and economy of means in the
expression of it which carry a discerning reader (like
myself) most pleasantly along, free from distracting
excitement as to the issue of the sporting quest. The
story is almost too elusive for satisfactory outline, but the
women and the men are drawn with sure and quick-
ening touches. Constance Penn—Mrs. Almayne to be—
monplace for a byway that leads to the heart of mediaeval
romance. At Saint Jean de Verselet, to which he next travels
in obedience to envelope number two, Corely again meets the
lady of the train, and shares with her in a village tragedy
exactly suited to the genius of the Sicilian players. And
at Highcombe, the English home of the head of her family,
he brings to a fortunate but unusual ending as pretty a story
of the course of true love as I have read for some time.
That is all I must say about the plot for fear of spoiling
the reader's interest in this very original novel.
The latest addition to the Fat Boys is Mr. E. F. BENsoN,
with a volume of ghost stories called The Room in the
Tower (MILLS AND Boon), which he advertises in his preface
as being designed to make the
heroine, if there be one in so
modern a study, is presented
with a gracious and reverent
tenderness all but Meredithian.
But the sparkling many-
facetted complexity of the
dead master is no part of the
method of the living disciple.
Mr. GRETToN is a true though
selective realist, wisely declin-
ing to interpret realism as
necessarily involving over-
emphasis of the sordid. He
knows and loves his London
as well as his Londoner, and
gives you jolly little thumbnail
sketches in his margins, so
to speak. This is indeed a
book of masterly studies of
men and things finely observed

I admit, so imaginative as to be impossible. But if you will
look upon the Society for the Production of Queer Results,
described in the first chapter, as an allegorical picture of
Fate, you will hardly be troubled at all by the supernatural
element in Mr. HAMILTON DRUMMOND's excellent and most
human story. When young Corely, a prosperous London
coffee-broker, opens the first of the envelopes which
he bought at the Strand office of the S.P.Q.R., and in
obedience to its contents sets off for Solzheim, an out-of-
the-way town near Frankfort, you may think perhaps that
you are in for a commonplace sensational novel. At least,
I know I did. And the usual charming girl with whom he
makes friends in the boat-train from Victoria (there is
always a girl in the train) will only confirm the impression.

No method underlies the madness,
Could you not just for this one year
Omit the alternating tear
And let us take the thing as shed

Of any March so beastly wet;
And neither Eight will soon forget

Having secured at great expense
The “minimum ”—of satisfaction.
And hark' here comes a golden age
When gas, to save our well-earned shiners,
Down in the pits shall have its birth,
And miners (late the lords of earth)
No more shall strike for better wage,
Because there won't be any miners.

Then shall the lion and the lamb say
Sweet things together, smiling fair,
And family feuds shall melt in air,
Warmed by electric wires that hide

On this your opening (All Fools') day,
You've started hailing like the - O. S.
The older friends of Mr. Punch will learn with sorrow of
the recent death of Mrs. Bow ERs-Edwards, whose sketches,
signed with her maiden initials, G. B. (GEORGINA Bowers),
and treating of sporting subjects which she found for
| herself in the hunting-field, were a familiar feature of
| his pages from 1866–76. Among the women artists, too
modest in number, who have drawn for Punch, her contri-
DRAMATIC HISTORY.
[The latest development of intelligent educational methods is to be
found in the history class-room, where what is called “Dramatisation
of history" is trying to supersede the parrot-like repetition of facts
and dates.]
WHEN my report on the dramatic method of teaching
history appears, I very much fear Miss Honeyman will
cut me. I had received instructions from the Board to
report upon the new method, of which, I was told, she was
the most successful exponent. Of course I had heard a
great deal of Miss Honeyman. She was considered the
brightest and best of our younger school of teachers. Her
handbooks on The Psychology of Addition, The Psychology
of Subtraction and The Psychology of Dictation are pre-
scribed for the Diploma of Pedagogy of the University of
London; and her thesis for the D.Sc. degree, with its
remarkable series of curves showing in milligrammes the
precise amount of fatigue endured by 5,875 children (male
and female), varying in age from 6:329 to 7.215 years, in
committing to memory the complete poem of “Mary and the
Lamb," bade fair to revolutionise the whole science of
Experimental Psychology. Need I say that, when I heard
how brilliantly she was teaching history on the new
method, I looked forward to my visit with the greatest
of expectations? º
Miss Honeyman proved to be a young lady of a calm and
assured manner. Her confidence in her own powers was
amazing, and made one feel that in patronising an inspector
she was only acting in accordance with natural law. “
“History,” she remarked, while we were waiting for the
class to assemble—“history has never been properly taught.
Hitherto it has been nothing but a parrot-like recital of
meaningless names and dates. The Dramatic Method, on
the other hand, based upon a careful psychological analysis
of the childish intelligence, and appealing to the mimetic
and histrionic instincts of the youthful mind, enables the
pupil to understand that the great figures of history were
something more than names—that they really lived and
moved and had their being, just as the children themselves.
The effect is instantaneous and immeasurable. The past
at once becomes alive, and history the most enthralling
study.”
By this time the class, which was evidently under the
most rigid discipline, had filed almost noiselessly into
their places. –
Miss Honeyman turned to them, the embodiment of that
bright intelligence which is the ambition of all trained
educationalists. “Now, dears,” she said, “we will act the
story of ALFRED and the cakes. Who will be ALFRED 2"
Fifty hands were held up. • **
“We can't all be ALFRED,” said Miss Honeyman, brighter
and more intelligent than ever. “As ALFRED was a man,
we had better have a boy. Charlie Marshall, you shall be
ALFRED to-day.”
Forty-nine youngsters looked disappointed, while Charlie,
overwhelmed by the greatness thus suddenly thrust upon
him, shamefacedly shuffled to the front of the class, in
obedience to Miss Honeyman's gesture.
“Now we have got ALFRED,” she said brightly, “who will
be the neatherd's wife 2''
Forty-nine hands went up mechanically. Miss Honey-
man smiled at this fresh proof of the interest of the pupils.
“Janie West, you shall be the neatherd's wife. Come and
stand by Charlie. Good | Now, children, you know what
you have got to do. Charlie, you must forget that you are
Charlie. Who are you?” Charlie looked vague.
“Come, dear, who are you?” Charlie smiled vacantly.
Miss Honeyman turned to the class. “Poor Charlie has

All the hands went up. “Well, who is he?” “Charlie
Marshall,” came the reply from forty-eight young throats.
Miss Honeyman turned to me with a smile. “They
have not quite caught the idea yet, but you see how keen
they all are—how the method stimulates their interest.
No, dears,” she continued, looking at the class, “Charlie
is not Charlie Marshall now. He is ALFRED THE GREAT.”
Most of the class looked bewildered, and one so far
forgot himself as to whistle from pure incredulity. Miss
Honeyman—admirable disciplinarian—was down on him
in a moment. “Stand up, Johnnie Walker! One bad mark
for whistling in class. Now, dears, don't forget that Charlie
is ALFRED THE GREAT, and Janie is 9."
She looked at Janie.
foot to the other, and back again, nibbled her pinafore,
and at last suggested that she might be the cakes.
“No, dear, these are the cakes,” said Miss Honeyman,
as she produced some property buns from her desk.
“Janie is as bad as Charlie,” she added to the class.
“She doesn't know who she is. Who can tell her ?”
Again all the hands went up, and all the young voices
chorused, “Janie West l”

said. “Who is Janie 2"
“ALFRED THE GREAT!” “Charlie Marshall!”
At these two suggestions Miss Honeyman's brightness
became almost hysterical. “Nonsense, children! Janie is
the neatherd's wife.” Janie evidently did not believe it.
“Now, ALFRED–Charlie, you're ALFRED–you are
coming to the neatherd's hut, and you see the neatherd's
wife. You must say something. What will you say?"
“No, no,” she
Janie blushed, shifted from one
“Think, dear!” said Miss Honeyman. ALFRED thought.
“What do you say when you meet a friend, in the
street?” ALFRED smiled fatuously and shook his head.
“I dunno,” he said.
“Oh yes, you do. You would say “Good—good—"
“Good morning.”
“That's right. But ALFRED THE GREAT would not
say that. It would be an anachronism, and "-turning to
me—“I think it very important that the children should
learn to speak in the language of the period they are
representing. ALFRED would say, ‘Good morrow, good
dame!" Say it!”
ALFRED grinned all over and murmured, “To-morrow
to-day.”
( . Ra now, Janie, what does the neatherd's wife reply 2”
Janie's eyes filled with tears. “She is a little shy before
strangers,” Miss Honeyman explained. “You have no
idea what a dramatic genius that child has when we are
by ourselves. Come, Janie dear, what does the neatherd's
wife reply 2”
But Janie's dramatic genius gave no sign of life. Her
poor little purple face puckered itself up into an expression
of acute agony, and the tense silence was broken by a
piteous wail.
The situation was intolerable. Even Miss Honeyman
was upset. Feeling that something must be done to
relieve the tension and to prevent the whole class falling
into hysterics, I boldly came to the rescue. “Children,”
I said, “what was the date of the Battle of Hastings?”
Vacuity vanished; hope returned; Janie wiped her eyes;

THE HERALD OF SUMMER.
“My dear,” said Jeremy, as he folded
back his paper at the sporting page, “I
have some news for you.
upon us once again.”
“There's a nasty cold upon Baby
once again,” said Mrs. Jeremy. “I hope
it doesn't mean measles.”
“No child of mine would ever have
measles,”said Jeremy confidently. “It's
beneath us.” He cleared his throat and
read, “‘The coming season will be
rendered ever memorable by the fact
that for the first time in the history of
the game ' You'll never guess
what's coming.”
“Mr. Jeremy Smith is expected to
make double figures.”
Jeremy sat up indignantly.
“Well of all the wifely things to say!
Who was top of our averages last
year?”
“Plummer. Because you presented
the bat to him yourself.” -
“That proves nothing. I gave my-
self a bat too, as it happens; and a
better one than Plummer's. After all,
his average was only 25. Mine, if
the weather had allowed me to finish
my solitary innings, would probably
have been 26.” -
“As it was, the weather only allowed
you to give a chance to the wicket-
keeper off the one ball you had.”
“I was getting the pace of the
pitch,” said Jeremy. “Besides, it
wasn't really a chance, because our
umpire would never have given the
treasurer out first ball. There are
certain decencies which are bound to
be observed.”
“Then,” said his wife, “it’s a pity
you don't play more often.”
Jeremy got up and made a few
strokes with the poker.
“One of us is rather stiff,” he said.
“Perhaps it's the poker. If I play
regularly this season will you promise
to bring Baby to watch me?”
“Of course we shall both come.”
“And you won't let Baby jeer at
me if I’m bowled by a shooter.”
*.
Cricket is
“She won't know what a shooter is.”
“Then you can tell her that it's the
only ball that ever bowls father,” said
Jeremy. He put down the poker and
took up a ball of wool. “I shall pro-
bably field somewhere behind the
wicket-keeper, where the hottest drives
don't come; but if I should miss a
catch you must point out to her that
the sun was in father's eyes. I want
my child to understand the game as
soon as possible.”
“I’ll tell her all that she ought to
know,” said his wife. “And when
you've finished playing with my wool
Jeremy gave himself another catch,
threw the wool to his wife and drifted
out. He came back in ten minutes
with his bat under his arm.
“Really, it has wintered rather well,”
he said, “ considering that it has been
in the boot cupboard all the time. We
ought to have put some camphor in
with it; or— I know there's some-
thing you do to bats in the winter.
Anyhow, the splice is still there.”
“It looks very old,” said Mrs. Jeremy.
“Is that really your new one?”
“Yes, this is the one that played the
historic innings. It has only had one
ball in its whole life, and that was on
the edge. The part of the bat that I
propose to use this season will come
entirely fresh to the business.”
“You ought to have oiled it, Jeremy.”
“Oil—that was what I meant. I'll
do it now. We'll give it a good rub
down. I wonder if there's anything
else it would like 2 ” t
“I think, most of all, it would like a
little practice.”
“My dear, that's true. It said in
the paper that on the County grounds
practice was already in full swing.”
He made an imaginary drive. “I
don't think I shall take a full swing.
It's so much harder to time the ball.
I say, do you bowl 2"
“Very badly, Jeremy.”
“The worse you bowl the more
practice the bat will get. Or what
about Baby? Could she bowl to me
this afternoon, do you think, or is her
cold too bad?” -
“I think she'd better stay in to-day.”
“What a pity. Nurse tells me she's
left-handed, and I particularly want a
lot of that ; because Little Buxted has a
very hot left-hand bowler called 3 y
“You don't want your daughter to
be an athletic girl, do you?”
Jeremy looked at her in surprise and
then sat down on the arm of her chair.
“Surely, dear,” he said gravely, “we
decided that our child was going to
play for Kent 2 ”
“Not a girl!”
“Why not? There's nothing in the
rules about it. Rule 197 (b) says that
you needn't play if you don't like the
Manager, but there's nothing about
sex in it. I'm sure Baby would love
the Manager.”
Mrs. Jeremy smiled and ruffled his
hair.
“Well,” said Jeremy, “if nobody
will bowl to me, I can at least take
my bat out and let it see the grass.
After six months of boots it will be a
change for it.”
He went out into the garden, and
did not appear again until lunch.
During the meal he read extracts to
|Prospects,” and spoke cheerfully of
the runs he intended to make for the
village. After lunch he took her on
to the tennis lawn.
“There!” he said proudly, pointing
to a cricket pitch beautifully cut and
marked with a crease of dazzling white.
“Doesn't that look jolly?”
“Heavenly,” she said. “You must
ask some one up to-morrow. You can
get quite good practice here with these
deep banks all round.”
“Yes, I shall make a lot of runs
this season,” said Jeremy airily. “But,
apart from practice, don't you feel
how jolly and summery a cricket pitch
makes everything 2 ”
Mrs. Jeremy took a deep breath.
“Yes, there's nothing like a bucket
of whitening to make you think of
summer.”
“I’m glad you think so too,” said
Jeremy with an air of relief, “because
I upset the bucket on the way back to
the stables—just underneath the per-
gola. It ought to bring the roses on
like anything.” A. A. M.

LEXICOMANIA.
HE was a middle-aged man, who had
hitherto lived a blameless and immacu-
late life, save for an ode “To Belinda's
Toque,” which that lady subsequently
forgave as being a mere indiscretion of
youth. Beloved of his family, not
adversely criticised by his own children,
and much thought of by the dogs of
the neighbourhood, he is the last man
one would have expected to become the
victim of the lust of dictionary-writing.
But the cacoethes scribendi is a malig-
nant and inconsequent germ. It had
marked him down. I think it was his
unique knowledge of the exact meaning
of the word meticulous which ultimately
set him on his unspeakable career of
wickedness.
At the beginning of things, when he
was still on the fringe of the ababils, the
abacists and the adiaphorous, he con-
fined his low practices to the privacy
of his study and maintained abroad the
wholesome circle of his mercantile
acquaintance. But, as he proceeded
with his diabolical enterprise, he came
not only to tolerate but positively to
revel in the society of literary men.
The depth of his depravity was reached,
I am told, when he made me his
intimate. We met in discussion over
the Aye-aye, which I maintained to be
“an emphatic affirmative, principally
used in nautical circles,” and he pro-
tested was a Madagascan mammal.
I shall never forget the shameless
night we spent together with the
ayembites, azimuths, and azotites; nor
I've got something to do with it.”

the grey break of dawn, we landed
right in the middle of the baagmouk.
His passage through the “B's" was
of such ease as to leave no hope with
his relations of his ultimate salvation.
The ceraunoscope did not long deter
him, the chipmunk proved the merest
child's play, and he arrived at the
beginning of the “D's,” flushed with
indecent triumph—to be defeated by
a monosyllable. It was not damn.
He knew exactly how to deal with that
and enjoyed doing it. He even gave
instances. Not to care a damn, he ex-
plained for those to whom the phrase
conveyed nothing, means “not to mind
in the least,” and he passed on with a
light heart to the dandy-rolls and the
dangleberries, the darapskites and the
darges. But at the next word but
three he ceased suddenly.
I found him depressed to the verge
of suicide. I left him trembling with
guilty excitement. He acted on my
suggestion, in fact, and started opera-
tions at the other end, hoping for better
luck when he came to attack that
fatal word from the back, as it were.
After that, he dabbled for months
among the zalambdodonta, the voodoo,
the thussock, the slatch, the paracor-
olla, the moops, the flabbergullion, and
the eng. But arrived once more in the
“D’s,” his spirit left him, and it was
almost with a sigh that he wrote “dic-
tionary : this is a dictionary,” and
passed on. He even grew irritable,
and the offensive manner in which he
dismissed the harmless daubreelite as
“an amorphous, earthy, whitish, hy-
drated, bismuth, oxy-ehloride,” shows
that he knew he was rapidly getting
to the end of his tether. The darmoor
gave him some excuse to pause ; he
postponed the inevitable by means
of such subterfuges as “darkness :
see dark,” “darkful : full of dark,” and
“darken : to make dark.” He found an
unexpected but legitimate breathing-
space in the darkemon ; but at last
there was nothing for it but to plunge
hopelessly and inevitably into the
dark; and it was there that his vicious
career ended from sheer inability to
continue.
He did not give in without a struggle;
for a week he endeavoured to compile a
definition of the dark. He would have
been satisfied with an algebraical for-
mula, had there been one, but he could
not even say that it was ar, the unknown
quantity. The dark is universally
known and respected; it is, as every-
body knows, the dark. He could not
even deal with it negatively and say
it was not light. The same remark, he
told me bitterly, would apply to mutton
and Mister Ramsay Macdonald, and

mind of his malpractices. Light, it
had defined as “the form of radiant

end, “is that which you see in a room

that which, when you strike a match

Pull Mall Gazette.]
At the Pavoli I found that amazing
peasant-genius Billy Sawdust in several
new songs. They are not so good as
his best—not so good as “Not Guilty,”
and “I’ve never been the Same Man
since,” and “There's Room in my Heart
for a Million Girls,” that ecstatic
lyric of the joie de vivre—but they are
good none the less. And you have to
see Billy Sawdust to appreciate him.
He comes on at ten, and the knowing
ones dash in from the street at that
hour, full of good dinner. But they
make a mistake. The right preparation
for Sawdust's genius is to stand at the
early doors in the rain for an hour
and endure all the rest of the pro-
gramme on an empty stomach before
he comes on. Then Sawdust really
appeals to you. He is beyond words
great. :: :::

THE MUSIC OF
THE FUTURE.
I suppose most great
inventions are based
upon a fluke. At least
mine was. I stumbled
on to it quite by acci-
dent, and yet it is a
pretty far-reaching
thing. It ought to
mean—when I have
had time to work it up
a bit—an entirely new
method of musical
composition, eliminat-
ing all that tiresome
business about harmony
and counterpoint, and
dots and rests and
minims and semi-
quavers and staves and
clefs and so on. It is
so beautifully straight-
forward and direct.
This is the way it

But I will admit that
my final edition of the
score disappointed me.
It had become a hushed,
ſeeble, stuttering thing,
and I could not feel
that it faithfully con-
veyed theſullintentions
of the composer.
Still, I had the germ
of my invention, and I
have put a good lot of
solid work into it since
then. I went on to try
what I may call the
complementary pro-
cess to that of stopping
up the holes. I mean
opening other holes
with a pair of scissors.
And there you have it!
The composer of the
future will simply sit at
his pianolina with a pair
of scissors and a pot of
paste. He has only to
open up a hole here
and there and see if it
sounds right; if not, he
shuts them up and tries
again. I do not wish
to infer for a moment
that it will be an easy
or casual process, for I
calculate that no small
knowledge of mathe-
matics will be neces-
sary. But it must be
incomparably easier

happened. I was
wrestling with DEBUssy on the piano-" perforations, like the track of a rabbit
lina and I came to a passage—one out
of many — that wouldn't make sense.
That was not entirely DEBUssy's fault.
My instrument (not the most expensive
kind) has its limitations. It divides
the key-board sharply into two halves,
which can be operated separately. If
the melody is pretty high up in the
treble I can smother the bass all right
and squeeze it out with my feet. And
if the melody is deep down in the bass
I can still overhear it by harshly
shutting down the treble. But if the
melody is bang in the middle—where,
according to my ideas, it has no earthly
in the snow, and, when I got the
pressure on, it merely squealed louder
and louder. It was then that I struck
the Great Idea. I got up and collected
all the stamp-paper in the house, some
court plaster and a packet of adhesive
labels, and with these, cut into narrow
strips and gummed on to the roll, I
simply stamped it out. It was splendid.
The melody began to chip in at once
and made a very good fight for it with
the bass.
That was the thin end of the wedge.
As soon as I had admitted the principle
of covering up the notes I didn't want.
— quated methods. De-
sides being far more fun.
But my invention can also be used
as a Parlour Game. This is done by
setting to work to turn one score into
another. It takes a good long time,
but it is simply absorbing as a winter
sport. My own greatest success in this
direction was when I turned the finale
of STRAUss' Salome into Home, Sweet
Home.

Scene—The Platform of an important London Station.
Enter the Father hurriedly, followed by his family.
THE FATHER. -
Now, by almighty Zeus, this is too bad!
The train by which I had designed to go,
My tickets taken and my luggage packed,
That train is gone and I am left behind.
It has been filled and now it overflows,
The measure of this railway's wickedness;
For all their curséd clocks declare the hour
Was reached five minutes since, whereas my watch
A very careful British time-keeper,
Tells me that five more minutes have to go.
Oh, all ye grinning apes and motley fools,
Stand not about me with your fish-like eyes,
But stir yourselves and let some deed be done,
Lest I sit down and write my lengthy tale,
My tale of matchless sorrow, to The Times.
And thou, my spouse, and ye, my daughters twain,
Had ye not stayed above and spent the time
In endless titivation of yourselves,
This had not happened; but I called in vain,
Filling the house with clamour and complaint.
And now ye see the end : we've missed our train.
Chorus.
This, in truth, is a very violent and angry man, unduly
moved, as it appears to us, by such a calamity as happens
every day to someone, he himself not being the only
sufferer, but rather one among many similarly afflicted
and bearing themselves with greater humility under the
blow of the immortal gods.
But, no doubt, he intended to go
To Paris, the beautiful city, - -
Where the prices are high and the dresses are low,
And the ladies are graceful and witty.
For ourselves, we have not been to France;
Such a journey was never our whim, Sirs;
But we feel for this passenger's painful mischance—
Yea, we heartily sorrow for him, Sirs.
The Father. Offer sympathy unto those who need it; but
me only bloodshed will satisfy.
The Mother. Oh, dearest husband, moderate thine anger, for
there are many that smile, concealing their faces.
The Father. And ye two who were born to me as daughters
in my ancestral mansion, wherefore do ye stand
helpless, bewailing your misfortune?
First Daughter. Hard is my lot who was to be Parised and
am now un-Parised through no fault of my own.
Second Daughter. Yea, and to me the gain of a Parisian
accent is henceforth forbidden, unhappy that I am.
The Father. Let the Lord of the Station be summoned, for a
short word loudly spoken to him may calm my mind.
Chorus.
The Station-master will come, mayhap,
With the golden braid on his jaunty cap,
Mayhap he will graciously deign to come
And address this fellow, who is not dumb,
His violent voice and his fearful frown.
But perhaps he will stay away, and then
A deed will occur in the haunts of men,
A terrible, murderous, bloodstained deed,
Promoted and wrought by the bitter need
Of the man who has missed his train and ship,
And is robbed, in fact, of his Easter trip.
Now whether he'll come or stay away
Is very much more than we can say:
But, whatever he does, some great disaster
Is sure to befall our Station-master.
So we, like bees, will buzz along,
Cheerfully singing our honey-song,
And ready to creep into our hives
With a view to saving our well-loved lives.
But, misery, misery! Woe, woe, woe!
We knew the event must happen so |
For, lo, with a port devoid of fear
The Station-master is coming here !
THE STATION-MASTER.
What means this noise, and wherefore dost thou shout,
Thou black-browed man, who hast no business here?
The Father. No business here 2 I have four first-class
tickets;
And thou hast robbed me of my destined train.
St.-m. The train is gone and thou hadst better go;
We have no room for foolish brawlers here.
The Father. This is the limit ! Strip thy station-coat,
Put up thy dukes, and let us test and know
Which is the better man, thyself or I.
[They fight.
- Choitus.
Now the battle is joined and the blood is already flowing.
Whom shall we support loudly declaring that out of eleven
chances ten are in favour of one combatant or the other?
Now the Station-master strikes a blow fearful, indeed, but
not accurately delivered, and now the passenger rushes
forward roaring horribly like unto a bull maddened by the
sting of a gadfly. Surely the Station-master reels under
the impact. Yea, he is down, his glory is overshadowed
and his course is run.
THE STATION-MASTER.
Carry me hence, for I have had my fill.
[He dies. In spite of the shrieks of the wife and
daughters, the crowd seizes the passenger and is
about to tear him in pieces, when Hermes suddenly
alights on the platform.
HERMEs.
Now stay your hands, and let the man go free—
Him and his spouse and both his daughters too.
Since he has duly worshipped at my shrine
He has my favour and, besides, shall have
A special train to take him on his way.
As for the Station-master who is dead,
I will myself conduct him to the shades.
Chorus.
Great indeed is Hermes and worthy of all reverence.
But for ourselves we deem it best that we return to our
duties. R. C. L.
“There are not wanting signs of great political changes
in the not-far-distant future,” says The Whitby Gazette

THE OPTIMIST.
(Suggested ly the “Poets' Corner” of a
I’rovincial Journal.)
Though my brethren faint and falter,
Cowed by each successive scare,
I for one will never palter
With a mcod of dark despair.
Though the nation's pride is humbled,
Though her glory, sore bested,
From its pinnacle is tumbled,
I will never hang my head.
If we gaze upon the seasons
Rich in variegated bloom,
We shall find abundant reasons
For abandoning our gloom.
Dangers stalk in countless legions
Right throughout the torrid zone;
Dngland's more salubrious regions
Teem with raptures all their own.
What can be more deeply thrilling
Than the magic which is Spring's,
When the lark aloft is trilling
Like a piccolo on wings?
When the hedgerowsprays are shooting,
And the primrose decks the lane,
And the owl's nocturnal hooting
THE FINAL PUTT.
Go'ſ r (to partner). “Now Yog 'w E Got This to save The MATcil, so NoNE of You R sciexcE! JUST BUNG IT IN 1."
When the year is at its prime
And the bee, that busy hummer,
Buzzes gaily all the time;
When the buttercups and daisics
Decorate the verdant leas,
And in char-à-bancs and chaises
Jocund tourists take their ease.
Nor does Autumn ſail in voicing
Orisons of tempered glee,
Though the mood of her rejoicing
Strikes a sort of minor key;
But the foliage rich and ruddy
Is a feature of the scene,
And affords a better study
To the brush than when it's green.
Winter, too, in cot and castle—
Though accompanied by snow.—
Brings the joy of Yule and wassail,
Christmas cards and mistletoe,
When the long ancestral table
Groans with turkey and with beef,
And old Brandy, choice of label,
Ministers to our relief.
What then matters it if haply
In our ointment flies we find 2
Let us choose the creed of Tapley,
Life is short, but you can brighten
Ev'ry moment of its span;

Never leave the frying-pan.

how her thumb came to be on the off-

that Desmond Stressborn had
done something in the past which
would make you shudder. When
to take his name and the bride on whom he had not
set his eyes since their wedding day, and how the
cousin turned out to be the rightful owner of the title
and became as well her lawful husband, to the general
contentment of everybody concerned. All that is Baroness
ORczy's business, and she does it very well. It is as easy
for her to make it all seem possible as it would be for Mr.
FRED TERRY to charm a London audience in the character
of the heroic lover if the novel were adapted for the stage.
Her sentiments, as I know from experience, appeal to
the stalls as well as to the gallery, and though, as a story,
Fire in Stubble is not quite on the same level as The
Scarlet Pimpernel, it will, I think, give real pleasure to
a large number of readers.
I liked The Debtor (HUTCHINsoN), all except the theo-
logical part of it. My objection was partly that one parti-
cular form of Christian faith was given all the credit for a
miracle which, if legitimate in fiction, might equally well
have been associated with any form of Christian faith; but
more that justice was not done to the other creed which

it was—to me, at least—a disappointment to learn, pages
afterwards, that many years ago in a moment of boyish
carelessness he had forged a cheque. Apart from this
blemish and a tendency to be a great deal too leisurely—the
hero does not enter the story till page 135–The Adjustment
is a satisfactory novel, which will increase the writer's
reputation for natural dialogue and careful delineation of
character. In her treatment of the minor characters Miss
BRYANT is particularly happy. Indeed, the more insignifi-
cant the character, the more sharply does it stand out. On
pages 63 and 64 there flashes in and out of the story one
of the most vivid hedge-hogs I have ever encountered.
From a local paper:—
“The band gave two bright, sparkling selections, the lively strains
being delightful to the ear, and were rapturously received. Especially
was this the case with a contribution from “Mignon' (Thomas), the

MY RESEARCHES IN OCCULT SCIENCE.
FRIENDs have frequently counselled me to take up some
hobby, if only as an occupation for my declining years, but
it was not till quite lately that I adopted their advice.
I decided to go in for Natural Magic, a choice at which
I arrived by the merest chance. I happened to find on a
second-hand book-stall a volume entitled, “MAGUs: a Com-
plete System of Occult Philosophy. By FRANCIS BARRETT,
Professor of Chemistry, the Cabala, ſte.” It was slightly
out-of-date, having been published in 1801, but a cursory
glance at its pages convinced me that it was full of
| practical information, and I have since learnt that it is
still considered a standard authority on the subject. I
acquired it for a few shillings, thinking that the study
of Black Art would while away my solitary evenings
pleasantly and not unprofitably. My earlier experiments
were comparatively unambitious. I began on a toad.
“So great is the fear of the toad,” I was assured by Prof.
BARRETT, “that, if he is placed directly before thee,
and thou dost behold with an intentire furious look for a
| quarter of a hour, he dies; being fascinated by terror and
with complete success. I purchased a toad from a naturalist
for ninepence (which I suspect was over its market value),
and glared at it with concentrated fury (with and without
glasses) for at least fifty minutes. This, I admit, would
have been open to the charge of inhumanity had it
occasioned any acute suffering to the toad. But, as a
matter of fact, the creature did not turn a hair! Obviously,
it was not the right type of toad. However, the Pro-
fessor put me on the way of procuring others which
might be more suited for the purpose. “If,” he declares,
“a duck be baked in a pie and cut to pieces, and be
put in a moist place under ground, toads are generated.”
It seemed a simple process, and I instructed my house-
keeper to bake me a duck in a pie, which I duly cut in
pieces. Only, as I occupy a top flat, the only land I possess
is contained in my window-boxes, so I interred the portions
of the duck in them, the soil being as moist as could
possibly be desired. The result was in some respects dis-
appointing—I obtained no toads. I fancy my housekeeper ||
must have bought the wrong breed of duck.
There were one or two other experiments in “Magus"
which are well within the scope of a beginner, such as |
this:—“The ink of a cuttlefish, being put into a lamp, makes
blackamoors appear.” I had a lamp, of course, and I dare-
say I could have ordered a cuttlefish from the fishmonger,
but I didn't. Not that I have any prejudice whatever
against persons of colour, but I have never-gone out of my
way to cultivate their society. Again, according to Prof.
BARRETT, I might have “raised showers and lightning” by |
merely burning the liver of a chameleon on the house-top.
But from this, too, I abstained. In such a climate as ours
it struck me as superfluous, Or, if I had cared to burn the
bones in the upper part of the throat of a hart, I could
have “brought serpents together"—but unfortunately I
happen to have an antipathy for snakes. --
So I resolved to proceed to a more advanced grade, and
summon up an Evil Spirit. “Magus" contains several
authentic portraits of fiends, and I selected a demon of the
sinister name of “Abaddon.” He was by far the most
appalling in appearance, and it is as well to do the thing
thoroughly while you are about it. - - -
Prof. BARRETT gives elaborate directions for raising
every variety of Familiar by means of sacred pentacles,
the compilation of a book of Evil Spirits, and what not.
But they are a little difficult to follow, and I was relieved
to find that, after all, he has and ther and an easier method.
“If,” he says, “a smooth, shining piece of steel be smeared
over with the juice of mugwort, and be made to fume, it
causes invocated spirits to appear.” º
This ingredient, however, was not procurable without
some trouble. It seems that even Store Chemists do not
stock mugwort juice; indeed, some were almost rude about
it. But eventually I got some from a herbalist. A razor-
blade provided me with the “smooth shining piece of
steel,” and upon this I squeezed a sufficient quantity of
mugwort juice, while I invoked “Abaddon" repeatedly by
name. I do not like to think that the herbalist was dis-
honest, but his mugwort most certainly did not fume, which
is probably the reason why “Abaddon” never turned up.
On the whole, perhaps, it was just as well, for I really don't
know what on earth we should have found to say to one
another if he had.
I was somewhat tempted after this to try my luck with
the Philosopher's Stone, by the aid of which, as I gathered
from “Magus,” I might “transmute pints of impure metal
into good and perfect gold.” Prof. BARRETT, it appeared,
had often done this himself, but there is a tantalising
vagueness about his instructions. Not only should I

But that was not the worst problem. Before even a start
could be made, the Philosopher's Stone has to be found and
its “first matter" extracted, as to which all the Professor
says is this: “Endeavour to find out in what part of thy
composition is the ‘prima materia' of the ‘lapis philoso-
phorum.' . . . I say, thou shalt find it in thyself.” Here
the Author is mistaken. No one could have searched his
composition more carefully than I did—but I never found
my prima materia. It must have got mislaid somehow.
I was consoled, however, for this contretemps by dis-

THE REAL IRELAND.
(Or, Ireland From Within—the radius :
An example of what we may expect
during the next two years.)
[Our Special Correspondent who says he is
in Ireland sends us this extraordinarily interest-
ing account of an interview with a typical
Irish peasant. With the introduction of the
Home Rule Bill, English eyes are turned once
more upon the Distressful Country (as it has
been called). We can safely say that the true
spirit of Ireland breathes more vividly in every
line of our correspondent's sketch than in all
the pages of the Blue-books, and that any
Englishman who wishes to understand the
problem clearly will do well to read and ponder
this remarkable article.—EDITOR.]
BALLYBILGE, Friday. In my last
three articles I described to you of
England how I made the adventure
of the Irish Channel; how I planted
my foot for the first time on Erin's
Green Isle; and how finally I travelled,
in such primitive fashion as the country
offers, to this remote corner of John
Bull's Other Island. To-day I have to
record how-Italked heart to heart with
the spirit of Erin, and how the great
soul of the Celt has at last been laid
bare to me. -
It was a thirty-five-mile tramp over
bog and potato-fields to the tumble-
down hut of the Murphy O'Flahertys,
but I was rewarded by finding Mrs.
O'Flaherty at home. I produced my
card.
t" am,” I began, “the representative
O —”
“Come in, y'r Honour,” she cried,
with the boundless hospitality of the
Irishwoman all over the world. “The
| top uv the mhornin' to ye. An' it's
glad I am to see y'r Riverince so
hearty.”
I should here mention for the under-
standing of your readers that I am in
fact neither a judge of the County Court
nor yet a beneficed clergyman in holy
orders. The Irish, however, are prone
to picturesque exaggeration — a fact
which should never be forgotten by
those who seek to understand the Irish
| Problem.
“It is very kind of you,” I said, “to
welcome me so—” .
“Sure, it's where will ye be sittin',
glory be to goodness, and me with no
chair to offer y'r Riverincel" she cried
in dismay. “Bad cess to it, acushla,
acushlal''
“You have a cold 2 " I enquired
politely, in order to relieve herembarrass-
ment. “Allow me to offer you one of
these lozenges—they stop the sneezing
at once.” -
“Faith, it's jhust on the ould pig I'll
be puttin' ye, if y'r Honour will be
plased not to mind.” She brushed
some crumbs from the pig's back with
of the humblest Irish woman, and I
sat down. “It's used to ut is Biddy,
more power to her.”
“Well?” said I, wishing to show my
acquaintance with the realities of Irish
rural life. “And how are potatoes?”
“And it 's mesilf is wishin' I had a
dhrop of the crathur to offer y'r River-
ince,” she said wistfully.
The power of delicate suggestion
latent in the Celtic race is a factor
which will always have to be taken
into account in any consideration of
the Irish Problem. I drew out my
flask and we pledged each other and
Erin. - -
“Ghlory, hglory, hghlory,” she said
in the musical Irish brogue which I
have tried, I hope not unsuccessfully,
to reproduce.
I looked at my watch and realised
with a start that it was growing late;
the thought of the thirty-five-mile
tramp back weighed upon me. As yet
I had not broached the question which
I had come all this way to have
answered. , My difficulty had been to
lead up to it tactfully; for it is just
our Saxon lack of tact which has al-
ways prevented any real peace between
the two countries. You in England
can little realise the fine sensitiveness
of this. Irish nation; and, until you
understand, the Irish Problem will
never be solved.
But the psychological moment had
now come. I seized it eagerly.
“And what,” I said, “do you think
of the Home Rule Bill ?”
“Phwhat,” she said, “do I think of
ut?” There is a wonderful directness
about these Irish.
“Yes,” I said, “what do you think
of it, 2 '' -
It occurred to me suddenly that the
special edition of your paper containing
the full text of the Home Rule Bill,
the photograph of Mr. AsquitH, the
snapshot of Mr. REDMOND and the
history of previous Irish debates in
tabular form had not yet reached her
remote homestead. But this Ireland
has a curious pride of its own. It is
perhaps the keynote to the Irish
Problem. Mrs. Murphy O'Flaherty
was not going to expose her ignorance
of the details of the Bill.
“And is ut thinkin' of ut I am at
all, at all?” she asked cautiously.
What answer my Saxon mind would
have made to this Celtic subtlety I
cannot say, for at that moment a slight
accident occurred. Biddy (which, as I
have shown, was the cognomen of the
pig) rose with a suddenness which is
one of the most surprising features of
the Irish character in action, and pre-
cipitated me to the floor.
cried my disconcerted hostess; “phyhat
for wud ye be upsetting his good
Honour, ye black baste, and him wid
a bottle of the blessed crathur upon
him, the saints presarve him. Bad
cess to yel" -
“No, no, my dear Mrs. Murphy
O'Flaherty,” I protested, as I rose to
my feet. “I cannot have you calling
your good animal a spalpeen. I assure
you I am in no way hurt. I beg you
to forgive her.” -
Reassured as to my safety, my
hostess permitted the incident to sink
into oblivion. This habit of forgetting
is one of the most delightful character-
istics of the Irish people. It is onl
less noticeable than their habit of re-
membering. Until our statesmen learn
the simple fact that the Celt is a bundle
of contradictory and apparently irrecon-
cileable qualities they cannot begin to
settle the Irish Problem. . .
“Well, Mrs. O'Flaherty,” I said,
holding out my hand to her, for in
this remote country all social differ-
ences seem to be swept away by the
Atlantic breezes, a fact which those
who legislate for it would do well to
remember, “well,” I said, “I must
be going. … I have to get back to Bally-
bilge.” * ... "
“Ballybilge is ut, be jabers,” she
said in surprise. “Glory be 1 The
howly saints rhest yer sowl! Ut's
no day for Ballybilge at all, at all.”
Smiling at her obvious dismay, I
took my stick—I had almost written
shillelagh, so deeply does the Irish
atmosphere bite into the soul—and
made my way out.
And as I tramped the thirty-five
miles home, over bog and potato-field,
I marvelled at the blindness of you in
England, I wondered at the Saxon
stupidity which makes no effort to
understand the subtlety of the Celt.
And, knowing that for the first time in
my life I had seen deep down into the
throbbing heart of a country, I realised
that my long journey to Ireland had
not been in vain. Erin-go-bragh 1

The BRILLIANTINE CoMMITTEE OF A SMART WEST-END Toi LET CLUB DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF A NEW HAIR-WASH.
RAPPROCHEMENT.
I Live at Welbeck, Ladysmith
Avenue, Brickville, and Brown at
Chatsworth in the same road. The
two houses adjoin, and have each, as
their names imply, a back garden. I
think it was this fact which first
| caused our estrangement, for I keep a
few prize poultry, and Brown keeps
Scotch terriers, and the dividing hedge
is unequal to the strain. However
that may be, there is no doubt that a
coolness sprang up between us. I do
not mean that we were on openly
unfriendly terms. On the contrary,
when Chatsworth Charlie killed three
of my best bantams, I was the first
person to condole with Brown on the
sudden death of the pup that evening,
and in the same spirit he was good
enough to present me over the hedge
with all the plants that my hens
had eradicated from his flower beds,
together with a certain amount of
débris to which I had not even that
much claim. But we never really
fraternized, and the mornings when
either of us missed the train through
station gate at the last minute were
always followed by some loss of cordi-
ality in our relations.
The Brickville Poultry show is held
in November, and early in October my
wife suggested to me that a rapproche-
ment with Brown was, in these times
of peace and goodwill, my plain duty.
She mentioned that, as Brown would
be showing his terriers at Tunbridge
about the same time, the selfish
motives with which he is always
actuated would be sure to make him
welcome any overtures.
The situation was not without
delicacy, but tact can do much. I
advertised bantams for sale in The
Brickville Bulletin, and whilst asking
from enquirers a prohibitive price I
was careful to explain that I was
“declining poultry” in consequence of
the annoyance they caused to neigh-
bours. Three days later Thong the
saddler stopped me in the street, on
some transparently insufficient pretext,
for the obvious purpose of informing
me that Brown had called upon him
to inquire when leather would be fall-
ing in price, as, except for the large |
muzzle his three dogs. The next week
I started a newspaper correspondence
on the Duty of Courtesy to Fellow-
travellers on Suburban Lines, and was
pleased to see it continued by Brown
in the same strain.
The times were evidently now ripe
for our cook, acting upon instructions,
to invite Brown's nurse-maid to tea in
the kitchen. That apartment was
tastefully decorated with flypapers for
the occasion, shrimps were provided,
and the utmost goodfellowship pre-
vailed, the domestics being much
pleased with each other's genial man-
ners. Indeed, the only rift in the
evening's harmony which came to my
ears was the refusal of my knifeboy to
have “Chatsworth '' tattooed on his
forearm with a skewer and the mark-
ing ink.
The next morning Brown missed his
train through holding open the station-
gate for me a moment too long, and in
the compulsory wait thus thrust upon
us we finally made up our differences
and agreed to share the cost of a fence
between our premises.
I took a first prize and two seconds

Home Rule problem. Papers full of
subject in advance. Forecasts of the
measure, contradictions and corrections,
shouted in the streets. Belfast has had
preliminary boil-over on its own
account. GENERAL CARson, K.C., with
misty recollections of Sim Tappertit
swearing in the “United Bull-Dogs,”
solemnly administered oath to fifty-
thousand Ulster-men pledging them
not to accept Home Rule “under any
circumstances.” Great rush for seats
on floor of House and in Gallery
over the Clock, whence the United
States looked on in the person of its
popular Ambassador, one of several
plenipotentiaries from across the seas.
Peers' Gallery full, but no block at
head of stairway, as has sometimes
been observed. Among Members late-
comers, finding every seat appropriated,
flock into side galleries.
A full House truly, but not compar-
able with the one that gathered on the
same errand twenty-six years ago this
very week. Then was seen a spectacle
never visible before or since. Rows of
closely packed chairs were set on floor,
their occupants linking together and
making one crowd of the throng seated
on benches right and left of SPEAKER's
Chair.
There was a roar of cheers when
PREMIER entered, echoed from Opposi-
tion Benches when later BonneR
hurried in and found Asquith already
on his feet. Also Irish Nationalists
cheered arrival of their chief. PRINCE
ARTHUR entered unnoticed from behind
the SPEAKER's Chair, occupying a
modest place low down on Front
Opposition Bench. By instinct or
accident chose the very seat GLAD-
STONE was accustomed to drop into
when, after public renunciation of
political ambition and purposes, he
occasionally looked in during the
Session of 1875.
PREMIER occupied two hours in
delivery of speech, an exceptional ex-
tension of time. It was in the main
a plain business statement, without
aside disclosed the fact that we were
walking over thin encrustation cover-
ing molten mass of lava. It happened
when PREMIER quoted passage from
BosNER's speech at Belfast in which
he accused Government of selling the
Constitution in order to purchase a
few months' further hold on office.
“Will the Right Honourable Gentle-
man repeat that statement on the Floor
of the House of Commons 2 ”
Of course he would. Nothing de-
lights BosNER more than such oppor-
tunity. PREMIER momentarily taken
a back. Opposition frantically cheered.
“How the human back is capable of
expressing insufferable boredom.”
(Lord CASTLEREAGII strolls forth to the Lobby.)
Captain CRAIG performed series of
amazing gyrations. Storm fell as
abruptly as it had burst, and PREMIER
proceeded to peroration.
His style pellucid but not invigorat-
ing. Nor did GENERAL CARson or
John REDMoND, who followed in
succession, rouse to flights of enthu-
siasm an audience that dwindled as the
former's speech was prolonged.
This strange unexpected condition of
affairs due mainly to fact that each
address had been carefully prepared,
passages being read from visible sheets
of manuscript. Even on momentous
question you can't inflame the House
by such methods. Beyond this cir-
cumstance was consciousness that the
whole business was supererogatory. A
pearl of wisdom incidentally dropped
from lips of John REDMOND.
debates are more or less futile. One of
the earliest reforms of procedure ought
to be to abolish First Reading discus-
sion.” If that suggestion bear fruit, to-
night's proceedings will be worth time
spent upon them.
Business done.—PREMIER introduced
Home Rule Bill.
House of Commons, Friday.—GoD-
FREY SYREs, who designed the cover of
the Cornhill and achieved even more
important decorative work at South
Kensington and elsewhere, held the
theory that “people's backs are very
expressive, and should not be neglected
by the portrait painter.” Thought of
this just now when CASTLEREAGH,
after sitting moodily on Bench below
Gangway sacred to memory of GRAN-
Dolph and his merry men, liſted his
tall head and strolled forth into the
Lobby. Realised for first time how
the human back is capable of ex-
pressing insufferable boredom. There
were crinkles about the shoulder-
blades, excrescences by the coat collar,
a broad expanse of blank depression
moulded by the waist, that spoke more
eloquently than sighs or yawns or
even impatient anathemas.
Truth to tell, House of Commons
does not possess for Member for Maid-
stone the charm it weaves round some
others. Things may brighten up a bit
when we get into thick of fray round
Home Rule Bill. Meanwhile, whether
in the aggregate or in individual cases,
things are dolefully dull. Cousin HUGH
pleases him not, nor WINTERTON either.
HELMSLEY is occasionally chirpy; but
what is he among so many ? And
then the sort of topics that bring grist
to the mill of everlasting talk—Coal
Strikes, six millions stored away for
Naval contingencies, Conciliation Bills,
the iniquities of LLoyd GEORGE and
the shortcomings of the PREMIER—
what thrice-boiled colewort is this!
Sitting dejected a full hour by West-
minster clock, CASTLEREAGH suddenly
springs to his feet and makes for the
door. Spasm of activity exhausted by
first movement. When he gets into
stride motion becomes funereally slow.
The seeing eye reads in expression of
right shoulder-blade doubt whether he
will live to reach the glass door. He
does, and through it vanishes, grateful
to breathe more invigorating air.
Business done.—Defeat of Cottage
Homes for Aged Persons Bill.

Now upon the window sills
There are yellow daffodils,
There's tulip and there's hyacinth
each tasteful box adorning;
And our street, at times old-maidy,
Looks a gaily gowned young lady,
So dainty and so débutante all on an
April morning !
Blue-and-white is all the sky,
And the clouds are driving high
(Around each windy corner how the
whistling gusts go shrilly!)
And the square is full of cooing,
For the wood-pigeons are wooing,
And there's sunshine on the pavement
all the way to Piccadilly
See the sparrows wag their tails
On the newly painted rails,
Or they flutter at their nesting very
fussy, very ſaddy,
And there's taxi-cabs a-humming,
And there's fifeing and there's
- drumming
When the Guards go by to barracks to
the bouncing “Hielan' Laddie!”
On the plane-tree's budding bough
There 's the thrush who tells us how
He has found in spite of stucco that
the city sap is springing,
Tells us how to note the blisses
Of a morning, such as this is,
And how April means adventure, and
how youth must go a-flinging !
And he tells us that it is
Just the day for Odysseys,
That high magic waits the rover who'll

So to celebrate the season
It were surely no unreason
If we took the 'bus to Regent's Park

THE INSUFFERABLE.
It has been long admitted, with
grief, that the blot on billiards is luck.
By some inscrutable law luck never
visits both players at the same time;
by another, it never visits me at all
when I am playing with one whom
for purposes of concealment, not to
say humour, I will here call Smith.
Were all things equal (whatever that
| useful phrase means) I could give him
twenty in a hundred; most of the men
who beat him near the post I can beat
with ease; and yet when he and I play
together he runs out when I am about
sixty. I say runs out, but the phrase
is tame: gallops out.
The peculiarly annoying thing is that
my game is based on scientific prin-
ciples; his is a fortuitous assemblage of
haphazard but successful strokes. I

the balls will be after a cannon; he has
none. Yet when my cannon is made—
when playing with him—the balls have
so disposed themselves that nothing is
left for me, while the reckless strokes
of this horrid person leave him every-
thing. I am aware that this ex-
perience at odd times is not rare;
what is remarkable about it in my
case is its persistence. Other men I am
unlucky with and lucky with by fits;
with Smith (as I choose to call him, he
will know why) I am unlucky always.
I have a strong suspicion that he
actually shuts his eyes when he plays;
I am sure he breaks every law as to
where he should place his body and
his feet. My instructor (at several
shillings an hour) gave me minute
training in these matters, and I observe
his wise counsels; Smith has never
heard that a right and wrong exist.
He places his left hand casually on
the cloth; his cue shoots out, and
instantly the balls begin to rush into
pockets. Smith, in short, plays as if
the pockets constituted the remainder
of the table.
“It is useless to try that,” I say
sometimes, in the light of my expensive
training, “the angle is too narrow.”
“Is it?” says Smith, and does it. It is
quite a common experience for him to
put down all three balls. I have done
it once—I am not proud of it; it was
a fluke—but when I did it I got only 9
for it; Smith always gets 10. . . .
Last night we played again. I had
been in great form for some days'and
spent part of the afternoon in prac:
tising; then he came with his infernal
careless way and indifference to tactics
and won easily. As we were covering
the table he remarked pleasantly, “Do
tell me—what does it feel like to lose
at billiards?”

AT THE PLAY.
“OTHELLO.”
THE new and instructive method of
disarmament by which an actor-man-
ager replies to his critics before they
have spoken (as well as immediately
afterwards) relieves me of the obliga-
tion of defending the latest revival at
His Majesty's. Otherwise I should
have said that its scenic elaboration
offered little disturbance to my intelli-
gent interest in the play as a play.
The crude story, however finely em-
broidered with noble language, does
not give one to think—at least not
furiously; and the early action of the
plot moves anyhow so slowly that it
suffers nothing from the delay caused
by the set pageantry of the Court-
house scene or the ballet diversion at
the Cypriote watering-place. (This
was, of course, before the days of sea-
side Pierrots, a fact sharply recalled by
the presence of M. PELISSIER in one of
the stage-boxes on a mission from the
Potteries.) What delay occurred in
the subsequent stages, when the action
quickens, was due rather to the too-
deliberate diction of one or two of the
players than to the distractions of the
Scene.
On the night when I saw him, Sir
HERBERT TREE was suffering from a
sorry rheum which gravely affected his
voice, and gave to his early utterances
an air of remoteness and even boredom;
and it was only by the greatest courage
that he met the severe demands put
upon him in the heavier scenes that
followed. But, when every
allowance is made for a tem-
porary disability which must
have modified the martial
bearing of even the stoutest
warrior, one may still say
that it is a misfortune for
Sir HERBERT that so many of
the Shakspearean characters
which he assumes—Othello,
Macbeth, Antony—were sol-
diers to begin with before
they took to tragedy; and it
is the effect of circumstance
upon this permanent quality
of soldierliness that he finds
easier to portray than the
permanent quality itself. His
Moor, at first sight, struck
me as Messianic rather than
militant, and my thoughts,
neglecting his earrings and
soft apparel, flew to JoHN THE
BAPTIST. Yet, if Othello is
one thing more than another,
he is a man of war. “For
I have served him,” says

True, we know little of his heroism
except by report—and chiefly his own;
for in the play itself he performs no
feat of arms except suicide and the
killing of a woman with a pillow.
His well-boomed triumph over the
Turkish navy (always unseaworthy even
in those days) was due to the fact that

his ship weathered a terrific stage-
storm, while the “Ottomites” went
under. They never came into contact
with him. Still, he was a soldier for
all his drapery, and I doubt if I should
have gathered this without the assist-
ance of the words. I except one
inspired moment when, having no
lethal weapon of his own, Othello stole

Mr. LAURENCE IRVING, as Iago, always
arrested eye and ear with his least
word or action. He was never a stage
villain. But in avoiding the obvious
things of tradition he tended to be
impish rather than devilish; and,
though I give him credit for singeing
an invisible moth in a candle-flame
and spitting on his own ensign (inci-
dents not allowed for in the book), yet
the real venom of his inhumanity sel-
dom emerged except in his brutal
attitude to his wife. This part was
played by Miss ALICE CRAwford, who
spent a great deal of time on the stage
doing nothing in particular and doing
it well and unobtrusively. Her lovely
Venetian dress was in sharp contrast
to the dowdiness of the villainous
“ancient;" and altogether I can't
imagine why Emilia ever married him.
Miss NEILson-TERRY played Desde-
mona with a fine grace and sincerity,
but was apt to linger too long over the
simplest phrases and so , sometimes
missed their spontaneity. On the other
hand, in the last Act, she got off to sleep
with extraordinary smartness, when one
considers the trying time she had just
gone through, and the fact that the
limelight was playing right on her eyes.
“Put out the light,” says Othello a
little later; but the limelight-man was
deaf to his instructions.
Mr. THESIGER's Roderigo was a
pretty popinjay; and Mr. GEORGE was
thoroughly sound as Brabantio; but the
most satisfying figure of all
was the Cassio of Mr. PHILIP
MERIvaLE, who looked de-
lightful and played with a
very perfect intuition for sub-
tleties of gesture. The charm
of Miss LAURA Cow IE was,
of course, wasted on the

dear dogs and the cats at home, and they'll make up for a
lot of suffering. -
I don't mean to say anything about the journey except
that we had a frightful hurry at Calais, and we liked the
French railway carriages and the white houses with
creepers painted all over them ; and when we got to Paris
we had to wait a long time in an omnibus while Dad was
getting the luggage. But he came at last looking very
hot and excited ; he said he'd been in a street riot once
and it was nothing to the douane. We didn't mind much
because as soon as we got out of the station we saw a
cuirassier with a long trail of hair floating from his helmet,
and that was one of the things we'd all been looking out
for ever since we left England. The cuirassiers look per-
fectly splendid, and Peggy has made up her mind to marry
one and settle in Paris, only he must wear his uniform
always and he'll have to learn to talk English.
Well, we got to the hotel and saw our rooms and had
some supper, and after that I don't remember anything,
and Rosie and Peggy don't either, but I suppose we went
up in the lift, and Mum put us to bed because we were
there all right the next morning when the waiter came in
with the breakfast; but first we jumped out of bed and
rushed to the window and looked out and said, “Hurrah !
This is Paris,” and then the waiter said something in
French to us—but he 's a German, I'm afraid—and we
answered him in French, and he really understood us, so it
is useful having French lessons. French breakfasts are a
cup of coffee or chocolate and two rolls each, with butter.
One roll is curly and soft and crumbly, and the other is
straight and hard, and both are very good, but the soft
one is the best. Then, when you've had your breakfast, you
do your washing and dressing, and when you get down-
stairs you're ready to go out directly.
It was a beautiful day, and everything looked as if it had
been washed and brushed and made very tidy, and there
were great carts with six fat grey horses to draw them.
The horses had short ears, and every now and then one of
them put up his head and neighed just as if he felt very
jolly and wanted to say Good morning to everybody, and
the driver shouted out “IIue " and cracked his whip like a
pistol. And there were motor-cars and taxis and four-
wheeled cabs with very skinny horses, and the cabmen
had shiny top hats, some black, some white; and the
motor omnibuses came booming along at a tremendous
rate. They've got a thing like a huge eye on their radiator
and it looks as if it was glaring at you all the time. We
ran over all the crossings, and Dad and Mum ran too. It
was good fun after you had got over.
First of all we walked to the Champs Elysées where the
great arch is. It's twice the size of the Marble Arch and
much handsomer. Then we kept walking on till we got to
the Place de la Concorde and the real streets, and Dad kept
on showing us all the hotels he'd ever stopped at and the
restaurants where he'd had good dinners ever so many
years ago before we were born. He said it nearly made
him cry to remember it all, and what was he going to do
in Paris now he'd brought his family and couldn't go out
to dinners and theatres as he used to ? He said it all kept
must have a dash one night before he went home, and be a
happy bachelor once more. Peggy said she'd go with him.
We wandered about a good deal and saw some beautiful
shops, and we all gave one another imaginary presents.
I got a diamond tiara, and Rosie a pearl necklace, and
Peggy chose five rings (diamonds, rubies and emeralds),
and Mum had some bracelets and pendants worth about a
thousand pounds. It's almost as good as really getting
the things. Then at last we got to the Louvre (not the
shop but the Gallery) and went in.
Of course we saw the Venus of Milo, and we loved her,
though she hasn't got any arms, but her face is so kind and
beautiful that you don't want to talk at all but just to look
at her, and if you do say anything you say it in a whisper.
After that we went through miles and miles of picture
galleries, because we were looking for the picture of Mme.
Vigée Le Brun and her daughter. We've seen a photo-
graph of it, and that's one of the things we came to Paris
to see. After we'd asked a good many times we suddenly
saw it in the distance, and we all made a rush for it, and
Dad said, “There 's the darling,” and we all stopped and
gazed at her and her little girl, and then we tore ourselves
away, and then we came back again and had another gaze.
She died many years ago, but somehow you feel as if you
had met her and knew her quite well. Aunt Mary says
it's because of her mother-look, and that all good happy
mothers look like that. So that's why we thought we
recognised her. -" -
I must stop now, because there's no more paper, but
I want to say that we are enjoying ourselves, and the
French people we talk to all have such pleasant faces and
such jolly smiles that it's quite easy to get on with them,
and when you can't quite say anything in French they
always help you. And the cuirassiers keep on being splendid.

self-introspection of one particular character, the gentle-
man who gives his name to the book—has anyone really
ever been called “Twinkle,” I wonder?—whereas I would

and in the midst of this promiscuous crowd stands Mary,
unsuspecting and unspotted. The authors have given a
faithful picture of the life of Monte Carlo, of its glamour
and its shallowness. That Mary found a few friends to
protect her and a Prince (Italian) to marry, I cannot help
regarding as rather a bit of luck.

“How you can look at those perfect
legs and entertain the feelings you do
passes my comprehension."
Having delivered herself of this ut-
terance my wife sank into a chair and
became absorbed in a newspaper.
“My dear,” I ventured pacifically,
“legs are not everything in this world.”
“Of course,” rejoined my wife, “any-
one can take refuge in generalities, but
to people who really appreciate the
Chippendale point of view * -
“Nobody,” I interrupted with some
heat, “would venture to assert that I
don't possess the Chippendale point of
view ; but there are moments when art
must bow to utility.” - -
“And utility,” supplemented my wife,
“must of necessity, I suppose, take a
degraded form.” -
“I can't see anything degraded in a
nice sensible knee-hole writing table
with a lot of sensible drawers to put
your papers in,” I remonstrated. “That
little bureau was designed for a boudoir,
and you have always called this room
my 'study.’”
“Well, isn't it your study ?" de-
manded my wife sharply.
“Not if I mayn't have what I want
in it,” I returned firmly.
“When I think,” mused my wife, “of
the hours that I spent in choosing the
things for it ! Oh, how I hoped and
prayed it might please you.”
“Dearest,” I interposed hastily,"pray
believe that my appreciation, if not
adequately expressed, is none the less
absolutely—er—stupendous.”
My wife crossed to the little bureau
and, bending, stroked one of its taper-
ing legs with the air of a sentimental
groom.
“Were you the product of the
master's sudden inspiration ?” she
asked it in a low effective voice, “or
did you grow into perfection slowly—
laboriously, the faltering fingers that
fashioned you waiting breathless, ere
they added touch to touch, for the
divine guidance that has made you
what you are 2" -
“Fingers don't generally suffer from
breathlessness,” I objected without my
customary caution.
My wife turned and looked at me.
“You shall have your Victorian atro-
city,” she enunciated in a cold vibrant
voice. “This poor little outcast shall
seek an owner who can still find some
value, some beauty, in the finer issues
of life.”
I confess I was nettled. “A bureau
isn't a finer issue,” I said, “and your
remarks, to say the least of them, are
“Naturally,” returned my wife, “they
are obscure to you, to whom it makes
no difference whether the table on
which you work emits inspiration or
stands confessed a monument of gross
materialism.”
“I’m perfectly certain,” I protested,
“that Mr. CHIPPENDALE himself didn't
use a little ricket—er—a little delicate
thing like that for doing solid work and
drawing out his plans.”
“There can be no possible profit in
that kind of speculation,” returned my
wife coldly. “I let us close the subject.
I wanted to please you and I have
failed—lamentably, that is all.” She
turned and gazed out of the window,
and in the gathering twilight her face
looked very pale.
A sudden overwhelming conviction
seized me that never had husband
behaved with such brutality as I.
“I've quite changed my mind,” I
began lamely. “The significance of
having something really perfect as a
medium for work was never brought
home to me before.”
My wife turned and faced me.
you really mean that?”
“Oh, absolutely,” I lied.
She gave a little sigh : “I am so
glad—for your sake.”
It was just then that the servant
announced Dawkins. -
Dawkins is not a particularly in-
teresting or pleasant person, so I need
not dwell on his visit; but on this
occasion he was responsible for an
utterance that may be regarded as
almost momentous. He possesses the
indisputable merit of knowing more
about old furniture than anyone else
in London, and my wife regards him
as only second in importance to “the
master" himself.
“You are very cosy here,” he per-
mitted himself to say, “Madame's
boudoir, I presume?”
“Oh, no,” interrupted my wife
hastily, “this is Harold's study.”
“Really t”. He laughed. “I wonder
he uses a little kickshaw like that.”
I experienced a sense of unholy joy
as he indicated the bureau. -
“You don't care about it,” suggested
my wife meekly.
“Oh, it's quite pretty,” he returned
with contemptuous good nature, “but
it's such a little liar. Look! It begins
by pretending that it's Chippendale,
then suddenly develops a Hepplewhite
tendency at the toes, and finally it
flagrantly emulates Queen Anne in its
contours. It's an awful pity that
they don't get some decent models
before they start copying the old stuff.”

kitchen table and several cane-seated chairs. “Humpsti,”
being, I imagine, the elder brother, comes on first—a tall
well-set-up young fellow in evening costume, with black
satin knee-breeches and silk stockings. A pause—after
which “Bumpsti” drifts in aimlessly. “Bumpsti” is
small and pallid; there is a certain dreaminess in his
expression, partly due to the black line that traverses each
of his eyelids. His dress-coat does not fit him, and he
not only wears an unfashionably baggy pair of black silk
trousers, but is also guilty of the unpardonable solecism of a
plaid neck-tie, though he does not seem to have the slightest

stands, swaying on heels that overlap the edge of the table,
and not unnaturally loses his balance. Happily, a push |
from “ Humpsti's" ever-ready hand restores him to the
perpendicular, after which “Bumpsti” indicates that he
can do no more until he is provided with a few chairs. |
These are supplied, and he piles them up on the table in
an untidy pyramid, obviously with but the vaguest idea of
what he proposes to do next. All he is certain of is that
he wants one more chair. He lifts one from the stage;
the seat of the chair catches the edge of the table; he tugs
impatiently, and upsets table, chairs and himself, to his
unbounded astonishment.

on one of the chairs, but
quite incapable of making a
selection with so many to

problem by meandering off
with the garments, and
probably losing them in the
wings. -
On his return he is as-

“Bumpsti” that such a
phenomenon can only be due to some peculiarity in the
table itself which requires his close investigation, and,
sprawling across the top, he proceeds to examine it, head
downwards, from below, whereupon it promptly turns over
with him. He utters a plaintive little yelp, and “Humpsti,”
coming to the rescue, sets the table and its victim on their
respective legs again, whereupon “Bumpsti” retires to a
coiner and sits on the floor, evidently feeling that the nature
of tables is a mystery beyond his comprehension. An
mortification, however, is soon forgotten in the delight of
discovering that his plaid bow possesses the remarkable
property, as often as the elastic attaching it to his collar is
stretched, of emitting a long-drawn wail. This he elicits
repeatedly and it never fails to afford him joyous surprise.
But in time the sight of “Humpsti's" acrobatic per-

all, his expression seems to convey, he is “ Humpsti's"

the truest kindness.
I am all the sorrier to have to say this because there is
so much that is lovable in “Bumpsti.” With his child-
like capacity for being pleased and interested, his placid
endurance of mishaps and reverses, and his never-failing
hopefulness, he would be an ideal fellow-traveller on a
Continental tour. Except, perhaps, at table-d'hôte. There
—with so many chairs and tables about—it is just conceiv-
able, I admit, that one might find “Bumpsti" rather too
compromising a companion. F. A.
“BOOKS UNWRITTEN.”
(With acknowledgments to the weekly edition of
“The Westminster Gazette.")
THERE are, of course, the books that probably never will
be written, such as Mr. WILRIE BARD's rhymed rendering
of the Iliad and Odyssey, and Mr. SILAs IX. HockING's
monograph on “RABELAIs as a World Force.” But then
there are the books that could quite easily be written, and
that I would give much to see in print. Mr. BELLoc's
“Life and Teachings of Sir WILFRID LAwson,” and
J “Buddhism and its Modern Application: Being an Essay
in Quietism,” by Mr. CHESTERTON, both belong to this
class. And why should not Mr. MASEFIELD, leaving for the
moment his own excursions into poetry, find time to put
into the hands of his publisher a eulogy of “The Later

In the drama and matters appertaining thereto, I want
to see Mr. GoRDON CRAIG's “The Art of LITTLE TICH,” and
“The Curtain Raiser as a Medium for Dramatic Expres-
sion,” by Mr. Thomas HARDY. And in the way of belles-
lettres J should wish for nothing better than a volume of
“Lives of the Saints” from Mr. FRANCIS GRIBBLE; while
Mr. FRANK HARRIs might end the SHAKSPEARE-BAcon con-
troversy for us by adding “Shakspeare Day by Day, by
One who Knew Him” to the already extensive list of his
delightfully intimate associations with deceased literary
lions. Mr. FILsoN YoUNG, again, might delight me with
a collection of “The Things That Do Not Matter”—if,
indeed, any such exist for that keen soul. When one
approaches fiction, however, the choice becomes more un-
certain. Our novelists are their own splendid masters, and
it is not for me to suggest subjects to them with anything
but the extremest diffidence. But I should like to see the
result of a mutual exchange of plots for their next novels
on the part of selected pairs of our great fiction writers.
For instance, I would have given a great deal to have had
the opportunity of reading Mrs. FLORENCE BARCLAY's
“Three Weeks,” and “The Rosary" of Mrs. ELINor GLYN,
while I am sure Mr. BENNETT's “Bella Donna" would
have been just as enthralling as “The Old Wives' Tale" of

[APRIL 24, 1912.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN APOSTLE OF HONESTY.
RATHER precipitately judging him by
his clothes—as at first I did—I assumed
him to be a middle-aged antiquarian,
but, as he approached and each detail
of his neglige whiskers stood out more
clearly, I perceived that he was either
a tramp or a philosopher, or perhaps
both.
As though he had divined my thought
he stopped at the gate and proceeded
to introduce himself. He had the air
of a rather incompetent sort of person.
“Sir,” he said, “I am a spreader.”
“Indeed,” I replied mildly. “A
moderately strenuous profession, I
imagine.”
He looked at me rather sharply.
“On the contrary, Sir, I find it so
complex and colossal a task that for
some time past in my more poignant
moments of despair I have contem-
plated giving it up entirely. May I
lean against your railings?”
He leaned.
“You see, the idea is so new, so quaint,
that the average hard-headed citizen
does not readily grasp it. Briefly, I
spread the idea of honesty—plain,
simple honesty—just that, Sir. I go
about asking people to be honest. I
was the first to think of the idea, and
I believe I may say it was very fitting
that I should have been the one to
think of it. For my whole soul is
bound up in it. The Idea is Me—I
am the Idea. Honesty, Sir–simple
honesty. Honesty is the key which
unlocks the door to happiness—I am
the bearer of the key.
“Let us look at this question for a
moment, Sir, and see how it works
out. Let us assume that everyone in
the world is honest. What happens?”
He took off his little, pinched-up,
ex-brown soft hat and hung it on the
railings, and I was astonished at his
extraordinary resemblance to one of
our leading statesmen.
“Why, a few sweeps with a razor,”
I reflected, “and—”
“What happens, Sir 2 Take, for
instance, an ordinary occurrence—a
daily, hourly occurrence—one of the
commonest and yet, I think you will
agree with me, not the least noble and
beautiful of the customs of civilised
finance—the lending of money. Now,
Sir, assuming that everyone is honest,
let us suppose one Jackson wishes to
borrow five hundred pounds. He is
temporarily—er—without resources—a
position in which our greatest men
not infrequently have found themselves.
Jackson says, “I need five hundred
pounds; I will go to Parker. I like
Parker—he is a fine fellow in many
tainly Parker.' So he calls upon Parker.
He says, “My dear Parker, lend me
five hundred pounds.’
“Parker replies, “Why, certainly,
Jackson. For how long do you require
it 2' Jackson considers. Then he
answers, “I shall repay you on the 21st
of May next at eleven o'clock.’
“‘Excellent,’ says Parker. ‘Help
yourself from the crate in the hall as
you go out.'
“‘Thank you,' answers Jackson,
takes five hundred pounds from the
crate or hamper or basket or whatever
Parker keeps his money in, and goes
home.
“On the 21st of May he puts it back.
Merely that—puts it back. He happens
to be passing Parker's, the money's
due, Jackson is honest, and so he pops
into the hall and puts it back. Do you
see, Sir 2 It is only just the merest
honesty—nothing more. And what
could be simpler or less expensive 2 No
deeds, mortgages, I.O.U.s, promissory
notes, and all the complicated para-
phernalia of the law. No worry on
Jackson's part and less on Parker's.
No expensive safe to buy. Why buy
a safe? Everybody is honest, nobody
will steal the money. Parker knows
that and puts his savings in a crate or
in the wheelbarrow out in the potting-
shed—anywhere.”
The spreader looked into my face,
smiling.
“Isn't it simple?” he said.
I confessed that, while it was a little
confusing at first, it certainly sounded
very ingenuous.
He frowned.
“Ingenious, my dear Sir! How
can that be 2 Why, it is so simple
that the only ingenious part of it was
thinking out its simplicity. But per-
haps you don't understand quite
perfectly. Let us consider another
aspect of the question. For instance.”
—he produced a small booklet which
resembled a tract, folded it and pre-
sented it to me. I am always helpless
with these gentlemen, so I took it.
“For instance, let us imagine that you
have been playing a little croquet in
your garden, and while your opponent
is engaged in doing the full course in
one you come to the gate and lean
over it for a little recreation. I chance
to be passing, and, getting into con-
versation with you, I sell you a copy of
my book for threepence. By the way,
you—er—the threepence, please—to
illustrate my point—thanks"—for he
had collected the threepence off me.
“And naturally you say to yourself,
‘Now, have I been defrauded ? Is this
volume, for which I have paid three-
pence, honestly worth it?’
honest, you turn to me and say, ‘Friend,
is this book worth three-pence?” In-
stantly I answer, ‘Sir, it is not. Two-
pence represents its total value, and
therefore I return you one penny.’”
He gravely tendered me the penny,
which I took. “And so,” he concluded,
“you see the exquisite simplicity of it
all, my dear Sir, do you not ? You are
delighted—l am delighted. And all
wholly due to the most elementary
honesty.”
He took up his little hat, exactly as
a person takes a pinch of salt in some
of our lesser restaurants, and placed it
on his head, beaming at me.
“Remember — honesty, plain and
simple,” he said.
He took my hand and shook it about.
Then, with a last smile and a final
“Remember,” he went his way, and
I pinched myself to make absolutely
certain that I had not been dreaming.
Then I looked at the volume I had
purchased. It was an ordinary two-
page tract—quite ordinary, obviously
second-hand, and if I had purchased it
from any other person I should have
considered it very expensive.
Some two hours later my wife pro-
tested against the absent-mindedness
that had distinguished me throughout
luncheon.
“I have asked you to tell me the
time twice,” she said, and I felt for my
watch.
And then, as my fingers closed on
the air that hitherto had always been
displaced by the ancestral timepiece,
I solved the problem which had kept
me pondering half the morning. I had
wondered why the spreader had given
me back my penny. Now I knew.
He had done so because, on the whole,
he felt that he could afford it.
He was a remarkable and talented
man, and I have often wondered how
he dealt with the person who had given
him the tract. I had given him nothing
and was a gold watch and twopence to
the bad. He must have got a grand-
father's clock at least from the person
who had the hardihood to give him a
tract. -

THE COMING OF SPRING.
STUDY FOR A PROTEST AGAINST MODERN MATERIALISM.
DEBIT AND DUTY.
WE often wonder, I and Jane,
By conscience forced to be penurious,
How folk on our financial plane
Live in a manner so luxurious;
Their movements figure in The Times,
They wear expensive frocks and frills,
They gallivant to foreign climes—
We stay at home and pay our bills.
My sister Sarah's husband, Jack,
Is something hopeless in the City,
A man habitually slack
And greatly given to self-pity;
Yet ev'ry winter he and Sarah
Evade December's fogs and chills
By skipping to the Riviera— .
I stay at home and pay his bills.
Smith is an artist friend of mine,
A veritable prince of swankers,
Whose talent chiefly takes the line
Of overdrawing at his banker's;
Yet Christmas finds him recreating
Life in the Engadine at Sils,
Ski-ing, toboganning and skating—
And there is Jones—I know his screw
Is something under seven-fifty;
He's in the Inland Revenue -
And ought to be, but isn't, thrifty;
Yet Jones, instead of barley-water,
Champagne habitually swills,
And gives it to his wife and daughter ––
I stay at home and pay my bills.
Surprising too are the affairs
Of Hopkinson, another crony;
I never meet him but he swears
That he is “absolutely stony”;
And yet he's always playing “Ponte"
With gay and gilded Jacks and Jills;
Each year he spends a month at
Monte— .
I stay at home and pay my bills.
I trudge to work on Shanks's mare;
I haven't got a car or “shover";
The eggs that form my humble fare
Come from the hen and not the
plover;
My hair is sparse, my figure weedy,
I look unhealthy round the gills;
Jane's Sunday hat is getting seedy—
I know this long-continued strain,
Where virtue is its own requital,
Is telling very hard on Jane,
Whose happiness to me is vital;
And yet, unless I follow IRaffles
And take to rifling safes and tills,
I'm bound by duty's curbs and snaffles
To stay at home and pay my bills.
The Paths of Wise Men.
“No wise man walks on the extreme edge of
a parapet which may be rotten ; he walks in

If Mr. STRAcHEY will promise to give

would no doubt arrange a parapet for
him in some ruined Welsh castle.

AT THE PLAY.
“JELF's.”
I HAVE often thought that the
animals at a Zoo or the fish at an
aquarium are better placed than we are
for seeing strange creatures on the
other side of the cage bars or the
tank's glass façade, but I never felt
this so strongly as when I was privi-
leged the other night to see for the first
time the clientèle of a bank (Jelſ's by
name) from the cashiers' point of
view. I also got fresh views as to the
disposition of a bank's interior. . In
real bank life, beyond the cashiers'
counter (with its bars to keep you off
the cash) I had always noticed rows of
other counters, unprotected, where other
clerks noisily flapped
the leaves of ledgers,
containing the dossier
of your private life,
but weren't allowed to
handle money. But in
a stage bank it seems
that immediately be-
hind the cashiers'
counter is Jhe place
where the partners'
sanctuary comes, and
you get at it through
swing-doors that let out
a draught straight on
to the cashiers' backs.
Of course it is a great
convenience for the
Head of the House to
be able to burst through
his swing-doors and be
at once within arm's
length of his depositors
during a run on the
bank; but for me, who
had never seen a sanc-
tum so situated, the
little stage realism of
these vistas rather spoilt the air of
reality.
There was a like congestion of things
in the crowded hour or so before 11.15
on the morning presented in the first
Act. Within the limits of this brief
period, in addition to the usual
stream of clerks, plain or confidential,
there were introduced, singly and
severally, into Richard Jelf's pri-
vate room at the bank the following
characters :—(1) his old friend, the
Hon. Archibald Mull, light - hearted
hero, on his way to Ascot ; (2) his
old friend, Mr. James Palliser, seductive
villain, on his way to Ascot; (3) his late
uncle's friend, Sir Jonathan Dunne
(Chairman of the Amalgamated Associ-
ation of Bankers), on a mission of
homely commercial advice; (4) his
fiancée, the Lady Fenella Mull, on her
the Countess of Skene and Skye, on a
private mission connected with a
personal loan. By il.15 all these
characters (to say nothing of the head
clerk and the chief correspondence
clerk and the porter—the last, as you
may guess, a very heavily-worked
menial) had been succinctly delineated,
and the scheme for Act II. mapped
out ; and nobody need laugh any more
when bankers boast of the exacting
nature of their business.
After all this dramatic compression
of time and space, how Mr. VACHELL
must have sighed for the large freedom
of the printed page 1
I will not dwell on the plot, which
worked up to a happy climax where
sacrificial virtue was rewarded—if it's

really a reward to be accepted by a
girl for your virtue, when she loves
someone else for his polo. But I want
to say a word about the Harrovian
hero.
No one will suspect Mr. VACHELL of
wishing to underrate Harrow of all
schools; yet he paid it rather a poor
compliment when he made Richard
Jelf (its alumnus) so little a man of
the world. If, during a course of
ranching in California, he could pre-
serve the brave traditions of school-boy
honour learnt on “the Hill,” might he
not also have remembered how to put
on his clothes? And might not this
Old Harrovian have retained some
dim impression of the right way of
kissing a schoolfellow's sister, even if
he had only heard of the process by
report.
James Palliser, of Palliser's Bank (Mr. KEIGHTLEy); Adain
Winslow, Head Clerk of Jelf's (Mr. JULEs SHAw); Richard Jelf (Mr. DU MAURIER);
Lady Skene and Skye (Miss WANE FEATHERSTON); Lady Fenella Mull (Miss Rosa LIE
TolleR); Sir Jonathan Dunne, Chairman of the Amalgamated Association of Bankers
(Mr. ALFRED Bishop).
suspicion that Mr. VACHELL belongs to
that delightful class (rare and refresh-
ing as the visits of angels) which has
never grown up. And certainly if Lady
Fenella's dithyrambics on the theme
of Palliser's prowess in the chase and
on the polo-field were to be taken
seriously, the author of them betrayed
an attitude of unconquerable youth.
And Palliser's snobbery, too, was
curiously elementary. Does a grown-
up banker ever really tell another
grown-up banker who happens to be
his rival in love that he (the speaker)
has a better claim to the lady's hand
for the reason that he can provide her
with a superior social environment 2
But when all these little cavillings
are worked off, it remains to say that
Jelf's is a very fresh
and pleasant play, full
of quiet humour. And
it was excellently acted.
The angularity of
Richard suited Mr. DU |
MAURIER, and so did
his way of doing noble
things without insisting
on their nobility; but
a drier and less emo-
tional part would have
suited him still better.
The character of Lady
Fenella, a woman
apparently of serious
nature, who yet ad-
mitted an insatiable
desire for pretty
“things,” and con-
fes sºd to the part they
played in her affairs
of the heart, was very
well interpreted by
Miss Rosalie ToI.LER.
The Palliser of Mr.
CYRIL KEIGHTLEY was
one of those good-look-
ing, clean-limbed villains who with
a little more money of their own
might easily have been heroes. Mr.
ALFRED Bishop was happy in the un-
forced humour of his heavy-father part
as Sir Jonathan Dunne, and Mr. HARRY
CANE imparted a delightful quality to
the methods of his bank-porter—a
type that I have hitherto suspected of
being rather colourless. All the other
parts fell nicely into their places in a
very agreeable mosaic.
The rehearsal of the interview be-
tween Archie Mull (Mr. RENDEL) and
his potential father-in-law (under-
studied by Mr. DU MAURIER) was ad-
mirable fooling ; and the final curtain
fell upon a charming variation on the
usual finish. “Aren't you going to kiss
me?” says Fenella. “I was going to,”

TOSH ABOUT TITLES.
[“It is not generally known how Kipling
chose such a happy title as ‘The Light that
Failed for the book that helped to make hin
famous. He had almost decided to call the
novel ‘The Failure,” although he was some
what dissatisfied with this rather prosaic title.
One evening as he was sitting in his study
reading by lamplight the light went suddenly
down, almost failed in fact. In a second
Kipling jumped up and exclaimed, “By Jove'
I've got it.' Pointing to the lamp he said,
‘The Light that Failed.'"—The Tatler.]
IT is a curious fact that the felicitous
title, “Get on or Get out,” chosen by
Mr. PETER REARY for his soul-shaking
work, came to him by accident. As a
matter of fact he had practically de-
cided to call it “The Hustler's Bunyan,”
though he was not altogether satisfied
with the name. But one day, as he
was walking in Putney High Street, he
overheard a 'bus-conductor remark to
a vacillating passenger, “If you don't
get on, you'd better get out.” “Golly!”
remarked the famous littérateur in a
spasm of uncontrollable enthusiasm,
“I've got it,” and he handed the 'bus-
conductor a five-pound note for solving
the problem which had so long per-
plexed his massive and megalithic brain.
RoPERT BRowNING, it may interest
our readers to hear, was within an ace of
calling one of his most famous poems
by the banal and unconvincing title of
“An Italian Romance." In fact he
was just sending off the final revision
of his proofs to the printer, when a
motor-car—a very early and explosive
type—passed down the street, ejaculat-
ing at intervals, “Pip, Pip.” “Great
Caesar's Ghost l” exclaimed the de-
lighted poet, “the very thing I wanted;”
and in a voice trembling with emotion
he remarked, “Pippa Passes.”
Mr. HENRY JAMES is another case of
an author saved by mere chance from
appending an unimpressive designation
to a masterpiece. Some years ago he
was about to bring out a volume of
short stories over which he had spent
more than an ordinary amount of the
limac labor, and had resolved, not
without serious misgivings, to christen
the volume “Convolutions.” Dut as he
was strolling one evening on the beach
at Rye he heard a lady say to her
little boy and girl, “Come here, you two
mad chicks!” “...Sakes alive!” shouted
the illustrious novelist, “you've given
me—unconsciously — the title which
beautifully expresses the inner meaning
of my book.” Half-an-hour later Mr.
JAMEs had dispatched a telegram to
his publishers containing the words
“The Two Magics.”
CofERIDGE, as Mr. Snorter has con-
siderately reminded us in one of his
masterly paragraphs, originally in-
“The Assassination of the Albatross.”
WoRDswor:TH tried in vain to induce
him to reconsider the title, but
CoIERIDGE was as adamant. At last
he was converted by LAMI), who, in the
course of a visit to Highgate, tried to
divert the philosopher-poet, then suffer-
ing from a severe attack of mumps, by
asking him riddles and conundrums.
One of these was suggested by the
fact that the roof of Coleridge's
summer-house had been freshly tarred,
and was as follows:—“What is the
difference between Sir FRANCIs DRAKE
and the substance on the roof of your

be unable to give the answer, so

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DANDELION.
WHEN I came upon Mr. Macey this morning he was in
his favourite attitude. That is to say, he was bent double,
and he was carving viciously with a short curved blade at
the grass. Mr. Macey does me the honour to help in the
work of the garden. He is made, I think, out of an
old oak-log. His rough weather-beaten face has all the
honesty and much of the consistency of such a piece of
timber, and his whole figure is wooden, if I may employ
the term without any implication of disrespect. The
greater part of his life he devotes to the garden, but in his
off moments he repairs boots and shoes with admirable
skill and celerity. Give Mr. Macey a pair of wrecks which
were once shoes, and a day or two afterwards he will hand
them back restored to all their former soundness. I do
not doubt that, if his leisure sufficed, he could produce you
a new pair, his own manufacture, soles, heels and uppers
complete. He is, therefore, a snob in its best sense, that
is, a working shoemaker, and for a family of shoe-destroying
children he is quite invaluable. He has his recognised
dignity, too. Other gardeners may be Bob or Harry, but
he is always addressed and referred to as Mr. Macey.
This morning, as I say, he was working on the lawn,
and was carving beneath the surface of the turf at the
imbedded roots of dandelions, his hereditary enemies. This
year there is a tremendous crop of these gilded usurpers.
They have made the green of the lawn one yellow, and
from every square foot of it at least one of them flaunts his
banner and shouts defiance at you. The plantain, which
is also abhorred by Mr. Macey, has, at any rate, a certain
natural modesty. It lays itself out as flat as a perfectly
detrimental weed can well be laid, and, if it does not miti-
gate your murderous designs, at least it does not irritate
them by superfluous ostentation. But the vulgar dandelion
has no scruples of any kind. Ilike a tall bully it lifts its
head and ruins your fair expanse of lawn. This year it is
more numerous than ever before. Mr. Macey speaks darkly
of last year's drought as the cause of this unexampled
increase.
º Nice little lot of dandelions, Mr. Macey,” said I.
“Ah, Sir, they be that,” said Mr. Macey. “It's a turble
sight to see 'em like this on a gentleman's lawn. I cuts 'em
out all I can, but they'll come up again, never fear.
If I was to uproot 'em they'd take me from now to
kingdom-come, they're so deep-rooted and all; but I stops
their seed anyhow.”
“It'll take you a long time even to cut them out like
that, won't it?”
“That it will. It'll be a mortal long job, and when I’ve
done it it'll be to do over again. But I don't believe
OLIVER CRoMwFLI, no, nor Box YPARTY, could 'a' settled
a lot of dandelions.”
OLIVER CROMwFLI, and BoNAPARTE are Mr. Macey's
favourite heroes and world-forces. I have never dared to
question him about them, but I suspect he believes them
to be still in existence. What they cannot do even Mr.
Macey himself hardly aspires to accomplish.
I left Mr. Macey to his task and strolled into the house.
It had occurred to me that the ferocious and recurrent
dandelion might form a fit subject for verse. The former
greenness and smoothness of the lawn might be described,
and then would follow the hateful contrast of its present
garishness under the sway of the yellow intrusion. Mr.
Macey would be the hostile spirit of the grass, incessantly
warring but constantly baffled by the hideous vitality of
the foe. The night would descend on his labours and the
dawn would still find him plying the knife and tumbling
at first sight and without close investigation, to be a
promising word for rhymes. I rushed to my desk and
went at it.
My lawn, upon thy smooth extent

Ridiculous! What verse-writer could dare to drag in such
rhymes as these one after another?
I gave it up. The dandelion, it seems, is infamous in
horticulture and perfectly useless for poetry. Not even
OLIVER CROMwell, no, nor Box YPARTY, could manage to
versify properly about it. - -

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
In Defence of America (Swift), a volume further described
as being “for the enlightenment of John Bull,” is the work
of the BARON voN TAUBE. He has raked together and
arrayed in the fore-front of his book thirty charges which
he imagines Englishmen to be in the habit of making
against Americans. We are supposed to deride and abuse
the machinery, the business capacity, the education, the
politics, the public servants, the statesmen, the morality,
the manners, the women and children, the digestions, the
humour, the language, the patriotism and the hospitality
of our cousins. All these charges the BARON sets out and
solemnly discusses. If I had the honour to be an American
I should resent both the BARON's method, which is that of
confession and avoidance, and his manner, which is that of
a heavy and patronising father. Even though I am a
Briton I may be permitted to remark that these “indict-
ments” are a mere hash-up of the inane stupidities
occasionally flung about by the few who desire to be
accounted witty and who are, as a matter of fact, offensive.
Some of these superior persons are English, some
German, and the American specimens of the tribe are by
no means backward with their retaliations. No sensible
man troubles his head about such things. But where
who denied American hospitality or failed to admire

of his wooden-headedness and judge him by them. I
ought to add that his publishers announce on the paper
cover of his book that “the text is illuminated by a
number of more or less humorous anecdotes and dia-
logues.” I applaud the candour of these gentlemen.
The Bishop of Bedford was the most notorious gourmet
in Europe. It was unfortunate, then, that the day on
which he proposed to visit his cousin Molyneux in St. John's
Wood was the very one which the cook chose for leaving
without notice. Eva, the pretty parlour-maid, though she
knew a little cooking, was not to be trusted with a dinner
for a bishop. The only way out of the difficulty was for
Mrs. Molyneux to spend the evening in the kitchen, and for
Mr. Molyneux to make excuses for his wife's absence.
Unfortunately, the excuses were given with such an air of
guilt, and were so obviously untruthful, that the Bishop
began to suspect. There was nothing half-hearted about
his suspicions; he communicated to Scotland Yard his
fears that Molyneux (in reality the most modest little
man) had murdered his wife in order to pursue undis-
turbed his intrigue with the pretty parlourmaid. From
these premises Mr. STORER CLouston has constructed an
ingenious and diverting farce, His First Offence (MILLS AND

methods of conducting murder cases. The getting of
Molyneux in disguise upon the scene of the crime through-
out the investigations is the happiest idea of the book. He
had written, under tho name of “Felix Christie,” a lurid
detective novel, and the newspaper in charge of the case
offered “Felix Christie" an enormous fee to take up his
residence in the house and write weekly articles about the
murder. So our hero in false whiskers returns home and
writes about “the fiend Molyneux.” It was obviously the
CRIPPEN case which started Mr. CLouston on this adventure,
but, however sordid the source of inspiration, His First
Offence is both effective as satire and decidedly amusing as
a story.
The life of the heroine of Mrs. ARTHUR HENNIKER's new
novel, published by NASH, was made up of two great and
exhausting passions—one filial, the other conjugal; and
in each case she filled the title-róle of the book—Second
Fiddle. For the bachelor uncle who had been a father to

constrained, after he had tried to adopt one and had hope-
lessly quarrelled with him, to enter into the bonds of unholy
matrimony. He chose a wife, a girl whom he had never
seen before, exactly as he would have bought a mare for the
Home Stud Farm, and then proceeded to bully her out of
her life. But before she left it the gods took her part, and
wreaked on him a vengeance far more ingenious and subtle
than anything that I could have thought of. I only wanted
to smack his face and knock him down and tread on him.
The author knew a far, far better way than that. And she
knows a good many things which are hidden from the
bearers of some of the most distinguished literary names in
Who's Who; she knows, for example, exactly how people
talk and think; and I, for one, have greatly enjoyed read-
ing her excellent novel.
The scene of Annabel and Others (MURRAY) is laid in
“the sleepy old town" of Michenden, and Annabel is an

I gathered, incidentally, that she had lovable qualities if
only you could get at them. In choosing for her leading
character a type that can never make allowances or see
life with other people's eyes Mrs. HENNIKER has shown
courage; for it is one that is apt to be as dull in fiction as in
fact. The author's manner makes no pretence to subtlety,
but it is sincere; and if her story suffers from triviality
of detail there comes a moment (as late, I admit, as page

BONES OF CONTENTION.
No. II.
“IF,” said my wife with tearful as-
perity, “you wish to ruin the dog's
character and degrade his point of
view you are going the right way to
work.” - -
“My dear,” I returned with charac-
teristic moderation, “I am adopting a
method approved by reason and ex-
perience. Nothing else will teach
him.”
“And it simply means that I have to
take him straight up to the bath-room
and wash his nose!”
“If your conscience imposes that
obligation you are doubtless right to
perform it.” I tried to speak without
bitterness.
My wife took the dog on her lap.
“Poor darling,” she said, “you were
born to unhappiness, and I confirmed
that destiny when I christened you.”
This was distinctly a hit at me. The
dog is four months old and she called
him Hymen, picturesquely enough,
because he was born on our wedding
day. I assumed my wounded expres-
sion which, in days gone by, I have
known to prove exceedingly effective.
“There is no reason,” I said, “why
Hymen should not be the happiest of
dogs, but if, like the rest of the world,
he resents a little wholesome discipline
—or you do for him—he will naturally
become discontented.”
“I don't suppose,” returned my wife,
meditatively addressing the dog, “that
you will ever forget the beating he gave
you when you woke him up by barking
at the milkman.” . . .
Hymen looked up at her and de-
liberately blinked a tear from one of his
large yellow eyes on to his nose. I
have always deeply resented in him a
tendency to work the “poor dumb
animal” turn at inappropriate moments.
“If it is your desire that an innocent
milkman should be attacked,” I began
with some bitterness. -
My wife extended her thumb and
forefinger and held up Hymen by the
scruff of his neck. “Attacked l’” she
sniffed.
I decided to abandon that point for
the moment. “Of course I know,” I
pursued sarcastically, “that it is quite
unreasonable to indulge in feelings of
resentment when one finds one's hair-
brushes on the door-mat with half the
bristles chawed off.”
“As if,” retorted my wife, “I had
not solemnly warned you never to
leave a chair near your dressing-table.
Besides, he was more than adequately
punished for that ; he suffered tortures
while I pulled the bristles out of his
“Then if only he would confine him-
self to one pair of my boots,” I added,
“but he can't bear left-foot boots.”
“I suppose it would be too much to
suggest that you could use your boot
cupboard for the purpose for which it
was made and bought.”
“Then there's the garden,” I con-
tinued patiently. “Of course a dog
and a garden are mutually exclusive.”
“Isn't that a clever way of putting
it?" said my wife to Hymen.
Hymen curled his tongue slowly
round from one corner of his mouth
to the other with an air of judicious
impartiality and yawned.
“The other day,” I proceeded, “I
found that he had substituted a chicken
bone for six tulips. To begin with, he
oughtn't to have chicken bones * >
At this moment Hymen created a
diversion by jumping suddenly to his
feet, rushing wildly to the door, sniffing
at the crack, and letting off a series of
impassioned barks. -
It is very difficult to disbelieve a dog,
tradition having inspired one with an
almost imbecile credulity where the
species is concerned; accordingly I
hastened to the door, looked out,
listened in the hall, turned on all the
lights, unbolted the front door, and
took all the precautionary measures
usual in cases of emergency. The
servants were at supper, and no man
or beast stirred in the house. There
was no doubt about it, Hymen had
told a deliberate lie.
“It must have been a mouse,” ob-
served my wife nervously. “IIe 's a
wonderful mouser.” -
At that, Hymen resumed sniffing
with some confidence, then he looked
at me out of the corner of his eye to
note the effect, and just managed to
stop himself from repeating the barking
turn. Possibly he was wise, for I was in
a dangerous mood. At that moment I
was silently formulating a brief sum-
mary of his character and his conduct,
which culminated in the resolve that
he should thenceforth work out his
destiny in more sympathetic surround-
ings than I or my house were prepared
to offer. I don't suppose that in all
my life I have ever been so determined
about anything. I opened my lips to
speak.
“Of course,” said my wife suddenly,
“if you decide to get rid of Hymen I
could make no objection. His presence
in the house, his very name, must keep
you so constantly in mind of that dis-
tressing, that irrevocable moment of
your life when ” Her soft voice
broke and she bent her head to the
dog. “Hymen,” she whispered pitifully.
With a sudden impulsive gesture I
words of comfort and love, even of con-
trition, trembling on my lips.
Naturally I knelt on the dog.
Afterwards—some time afterwards—
we sat quite close together with Hymen
sleeping self-consciously at our feet.
“And so,” whispered my wife, “we
will always keep him with us—for
better for worse, to remind us of that
wonderful day that was blessed by
Hymen.”
“Amen,” I sighed.
MORE NANSENSE.
WE have read with interest the
stories relating to NANSEN in The
Westminster Gazette — that of Sir
HENRY IRVING, who referred to the
great explorer as “the chap who stood
the cold so well,” followed on the next
day by that of the late Duke of DEvoN-
SHIRE, whose first remark to NANSEN
on meeting him was, “I suppose you
found it pretty cold up there?"
May we, from our own uncertain
knowledge, add to these stories, so that
the subject may not be allowed to lapse
too soon ?
Dr. NANSEN was visiting Aberdeen
during his lecturing tour. It was
January and a blizzard was raging.
Outside the railway station he hap-
pened to run against his chairman of
the night before, who remarked
pleasantly, as he picked himself out of
the snow: “Chilly for so far south,
isn't, it 2 '' -
An amusing incident took place dur-
ing Dr. NANSEN's visit to one of our
well-known Marquises. The heir to
the marquisate, then a little boy of
seven summers, was told by his mother
to come and speak to the intrepid
voyager. “Is his nose frost-bitten,
Mummy dear?" asked the handsome
child, looking up for a moment from
his model gunboat. “Why no, darling,”
she said. “Then I think I'm rather
too busy to see him just now,” was the
reply.

There was a tremendous heap of letters for Dad, and we
all helped him to open them. Some of them were the sort
that come in long envelopes with half-penny stamps, and
we weren't going to be sea-sick, which we weren't ; but

Dad also said that most of his best letters had been kept at
home and only the stupid ones forwarded, and it was always
the same when he went away anywhere.
- We’d bought presents for all
that would be a bad sign. After
that we all rubbed our noses a
good deal to keep them from
going pale, and it was very
successful.
It was very jolly getting home.
John was standing on the door-
step, and he kissed us all in a
great hurry because he wanted
to see what presents we’d
brought him from Paris. He
never stopped asking about them
till we fished them all out of our
luggage, and then he was very
happy; but he didn't care a bit
about what we'd done in Paris.
We tried to tell him about the
Louvre and Versailles and the
Cuirassiers, but it wasn't any
good. He wouldn't listen to
us, and went on playing with
his toys and telling us how he'd
fallen down in the garden that
afternoon and cut his knee and
not cried. It was a good thing
we didn't take him to Paris,
because it wouldn't have in-
terested him. Mademoiselle
had taught him a little French
the servants, and when we’d
finished with the dogs we went
and saw them all and gave them
what we'd got. James the
butler's present was a fountain
pen, and the footman's was a
little leather purse, and the
cook's was a big necklace of
beads, pink and light blue. The
housemaids got a silk scarf each.
They all seemed very pleased
when we told them they were
real French things bought in
Paris—but cook gave us all a
hug and said she'd been dread-
fully dull without us, and the
best present she could have was
seeing us all back again, though
we were such mischievous
plagues she sometimes had to
turn us out, but we mustn't
mind because it was only her
way and she was too old to
change now. So we all hugged
her back, and told her that
getting-home was even jollier
than going away. Then she
gave us a jam-tart each.

did want to go, and it was so
comfortable, and the night was
about it. Mum says he's the ' -
most unsentimental boy she ever met.
Then there were the dogs and the cats. The dogs were
much more pleased to see us than John was. , Duke and
Lufra, the Great Danes, pranced round us and then began
pulling one another about, and then they dashed into the
house and slipped up on all the loose carpets and upset
everything, and then they dashed out again and raced round
and round the lawn in circles with their tails tucked in in
the funny way dogs do when they're excited; and Su-Ti,
the Pekinese, rushed after them as hard as his little legs
would carry him, barking like mad, and then most of us
got knocked down, and they licked our faces, which is a
great pleasure for dogs. I thought Su-Ti would never stop
screaming for joy when he first saw us. He's a very well-
bred dog—I mean his pedigree—and most of him is as black
as soot. That's how he got his name.
The cats were much quieter than the dogs. They didn't
look as if they had noticed we'd been away, but they sat
and blinked at us, and didn't even rub up against our legs.
They seemed to be saying they weren't going to make fools
'so quiet without the motor-
omnibuses and the taxi-cabs that we went off to sleep
directly. And the next morning there was fried sole and
bacon and eggs for breakfast. We never knew we liked
them so much.
The Bridge of Allan Gazette, in a complimentary paragraph
upon a gentleman who has apparently taken up some new
editorial labours, makes the following remarks:—
“He is a successful story writer himself, serials from his pen having
appeared in The People's Journal, The Weekly Record, The Liverpoºl
Post, and other popular º and on theJ. of F. tl
thief to catch a thief he should be able to enlist the services of capable
authors.”
These sweeping and, no doubt, baseless insinuations of
plagiarism are greatly to be deprecated.
“On more than one occasion he was within an ace of being boiled and
eaten by native chefs.”—Daily News.
In this country the chef has to confine his activities to the
kitchen; he never joins the guests in the dining-room.

THE BIGLEY PAPERS.
{With acknowledgments to Mr. G. W.
SMALLEY’s “Anglo-American Memories,” Second
Series (Duckworth)].
It is not necessary to introduce Mr.
Bigley to English readers, for he is as
well known on this as on the other side
of the Atlantic. A veritable Nestor of
journalists, he has known everybody
worth knowing, and as he is giſted with
an extraordinarily retentive memory it
goes without saying that his book is
packed with those racy, personalia
which are the very life-blood of
reminiscence.
Above all Mr. Bigley has the saving
grace of not being afraid to recount
anecdotes at his own expense.
for instance, could be more charming
than the instance which he gives of
the ready wit of the late ABRAHAM
HAYwaiti). HAyward was rallying
him on his social activities and Mr.
Bigley assured him that he was quite
mistaken—that the only form of enter-
tainment he really cared about was a
“small and early.” “Oh ' " replied
HAYwARD, “I thought it was ‘an Earl
and Bigley.” In this context one
may also note a characteristic anecdote
of Robert Browning. The famous
poet was challenged to find rhymes for
all the company at a country house
party given by the Duke of Doldrum,
and, when it came to the turn of the
narrator, improvised the following
couplet:—
Worms when they are most wriggly
Remind me of Mr. Bigley. -
Though partial to entertainments on
a restricted scale, Mr. Bigley admits
that on one occasion he dined out
eight times in one week. The eighth
dinner was accounted for in the follow-
ing interesting manner. It appears
that he went by mistake to Sir Parry
Gorwick's, but did not discover that he
had come to the wrong house until he
had reached the entrée. He then hurried
| off to Lord Primbury's, next door, in
time for the fish, as Lord Primbury's
| dinner had begun a quarter of an hour
later.
The famous saying, Cherchez la
femme, receives abundant illustration in
Mr. Bigley's chatty pages, and he ex-
presses the opinion that Mr. BALFour's
resignation of the leadership was solely
due to the remark of a lady, in a mixed
foursome at North Berwick, that a man
who talked psychology on the links
could never become a scratch player.
Mr. Bigley, we may add, confirms the
statement that even in the most trying
circumstances Mr. BALFour uses no
stronger expletive than “Blow !" The

Another of Mr. Bigley's heroes is
Senator SMITH, of whom he relates
several anecdotes, showing that his
desire for precise information was de-
veloped in early youth. Mr. Bigley
made the acquaintance of the Senator
when he was only ten years old. Even
at that age, we are told, he had the
same clear notion of what he wanted
and how to get it, which has dis-
tinguished him ever since.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[May 1, 1912.
MY SECRETARY.
WHEN, five years ago, I used to write
long letters to Margery, for some
reason or other she never wrote back.
To save her face I had to answer the
letters myself—a tedious business. Still,
I must admit that the warmth and
geniality of the replies gave me , a
certain standing with my friends, who
had not looked for me to be so popular.
After some months, however, pride
stepped in. One cannot pour out letter
after letter to a lady without any
acknowledgments save from oneself.
And when even my own acknowledg-
ments began to lose their first warmth–
when, for instance, I answered four
pages about my new pianola with the
curt reminder that I was learning to
walk and couldn't be bothered with
music, why, then at last I saw that a
correspondence so one-sided would have
to come to an end. I wrote a farewell
letter and replied to it with tears . . . .
But, bless you, that was nearly five
years ago. Each morning now, among
the usual pile of notes on my plate
from duchesses, publishers, money-
lenders, actor-managers and what-not,
I find, likely enough, an envelope in
Margery's own handwriting, Not only
is my address printed upon it legibly,
but there are also such extra directions
to the postman as “England” and
“Important" for its more speedy
arrival. And inside—well, I give you
the last but seven.
“MY DEAR UNCLE I thot you wher
coming to see me to night but you
didnt why didnt you baby has p to
| hurt her knee isnt that a pity I have
some new toys isnt that jolly we didnt
have our five minutes so will you krite
to me and tell me all about p to your
work from your loving little MARGIE.”
I always think that footnotes to a
letter are a mistake, but there are one
or two things I should like to explain.
(a) Just as some journalists feel
that without the word “economic” a
leading article lacks tone, so Margery
feels, and I agree with her, that a certain
cachet is lent to a letter by a p.t.o. at
the bottom of each page.
(b) There are lots of grown-up people
who think that “write" is spelt “rite.”
Margery knows that this is not so.
She knows that there is a silent letter
in front of the “r,” which doesn’t
do anything but likes to be there.
Obviously, if nobody is going to take
any notice of this extra letter, it doesn't
much matter what it is. Margery
happened to want to make a “k” just
then; at a pinch it could be as silent
as a “w.” You will please, therefore,
regard the “k” in “krite” as absolutely
(c) Both Margery and BERNARD
SHAw prefer to leave out the apos-
trophe in writing such words as “isn't"
and “don't.”
(d) Years ago I claimed the privilege
to monopolise, on the occasional even-
ings when I was there, Margery's last
ten minutes before she goes back to
some heaven of her own each night.
This privilege was granted ; it being
felt, no doubt, that she owed me some
compensation for my early secretarial
work on her behalf. We used to spend
the ten minutes in listening to my telling
a fairy story, always the same one. One
day the authorities stepped in and
announced that in future the ten
minutes would be reduced to five. The
procedure seemed to me absolutely
illegal (and I should like to bring an
action against somebody) but it cer-
tainly did put the lid on my fairy story,
of which I was getting more than a
little tited.
“Tell me about Beauty and the
Beast,” said Margery as usual, that
evening.
“There 's not time,” I said.
only five minutes to-night.”
“Oh Then tell me all the work
you've done to-day.”
(A little unkind, you'll agree, but you
know what relations are.)
And so now I have to cram the
record of my day's work into five
breathless minutes. You will under-
stand what bare justice I can do to it
in the time. -
I am sorry that these footnotes have
grown so big ; let us leave them and
return to the letter. There are many
ways of answering such a letter. One
might say, “My DEAR MARGERY,-It
was jolly to get a real letter from you
at last——” but the “at last ’’ would
seem rather tactless considering what
had passed years before. Or one might
say, “My DEAR MARGERY, Thank you
for your jolly letter. I am so sorry about
baby's knee and so glad about your
toys. Perhaps if you gave one of the
toys to baby, then her knee But
I feel sure that Margery would expect
me to do better than that.
In the particular case of this last
letter but seven I wrote:
“DEAREST MARGERY,-Thank you for
your sweet letter. I had a very busy
day at the office or I would have come
to see you. P.T.o.—I hope to be down
next week and then I will tell you all
about my work; but I have a lot more
to do now, and so I must say Good-
bye. Your loving UNCLE.”
There is perhaps nothing in that
which demands an immediate answer,
but with businesslike promptitude
Margery replied:
“We've
letter I am glad you are coming next
week baby is quite well now are you
p to coming on Thursday next week or
not say yes if you are I am p to
sorry you are working so hard from
your loving MARGIE.”
I said “Yes,” and that I was her
loving uncle. It seemed to be then too
late for a “P.T.o.,” but I got one in and
put on the back, “Love to Baby.” The
answer came by return of post :
“My DEAR UNCLE thank you for
your letter come erly on p to Thursday
come at half past nothing baby sends
her love and so do p to I myroking
horse has a sirrup broken isnt that a
pity say yes or no good-bye from your
loving MARGIE.”
Of course I thanked Baby for her
love and gave my decision that it was
a pity about the rocking-horse. I did
it in large capitals, which (as I ought
to have said before) is the means of
communication between Margery and
her friends. For some reason or other
I find printing capitals to be more
tiring than the ordinary method of
writing.
“My DEAR UNCLE,” wrote Margery—
But we need not go into that. What
I want to say is this: I love to get
letters, particularly these, but I hate
writing them, particularly in capitals.
Years ago I used to answer Margery's
letters for her. It is now her turn to
answer mine for me. A. A. M.
THE FESTIVE ASH-HUNTERS.
THE last complimentary dinner to the
various members of the English team
which recovered the ashes has now
been eaten just in time for the ill effects
of the banqueting season to vanish
before the cricket season begins in
earnest. They were remarkable affairs
in which the richness of the dishes and
excellence of the wines were equalled
only by the eloquence and fervour of
the company.
The public has already had some
opportunity of reading accounts of the
proceedings at certain of these feasts,
notably at that given at Cambridge to
JAck Hobbs, where a considerable por-
tion of the evening was occupied in
the reading of a letter from Mr. P. F.
WARNER, in which, having begun by
saying that he had praised Hobbs, so
consistently and for so many years that
he had no more to say, he went on to
praise HoRBs. But there are several
dinners still to be reported, and we are
lucky in being able to report one or two
of them.

been elected under Rule 2, which em-
powers the committee to add a few
distinguished globe-trotters to the list
of members every year. The chair was
taken by Dr. Sven HEDIN, who read a
number of letters from public men in
praise of IREMONGER's heroic voyage to
Australia and back for no other purpose
than sheer love of travel. The Rt.
Hon. Mr. JAMES BRycE sent a special
cablegram of felicitations, and there
were also a few choice words from Mr.
WARNER, who had hoped to be there - -

but was too busy correcting the proofs
of his history of the recent cricket tour
in the Antipodes. Mr. WARNER com-
mented gracefully upon the happy
chance for the recent English team in
having so sterling a fellow as IRE-
MongBR on the same boat and in the
same hotels. Mr. Douglas, who also
wrote, said something very similar, but
added that he wished that IREMONGER
had told him that he was a cricketer,
as he badly wanted an extra man when
playing Thirty-two of Dingamooloo.
As it was, however, he found another
Englishman named KINNEIR, a left-

remarks to the effect that travel to be
really enjoyable should be an end in
itself rather than a means to an end.
Australia is a delightful country to
anyone with plenty of time to look
about him. (Sensation).
DINING WINE.
The dinner to JoE WINE, the “Sussex
Whirlwind" as he has been aptly
called by Sir HoME GoRDON, the doyen
held at Brighton in the ijome, no other
building being large enough to hold his
numerous admirers. In the absence
of the Jam of NAwan AGAR, the chair
was taken by Mr. CHAPLIN, the Sussex
Captain.
Mr. WARNER, who was to have been
present, but was unavoidably detained
at his barber's, sent a telegram of
regret in which he said that, ready as
he was with his pen on most occasions,
words failed him when it came to the
brilliance of Joe VINE, the scorer's
friend par excellence. No matter what
time of day WINE went in, the scorers

cricket. He liked everything about it;
but most of all he liked the batting
crease. He liked it so much that he
hated to leave it. ... (Loud applause.)
If he had his way VINE should always
be the twelfth man in every eleven.
(Great enthusiasm during which VINE’s
health was drunk to slow music.)
Mr. J. W. H. T. Douglas also wrote
saying that VINE was by far the best
man Sussex had contributed to the
conquering team. Nothing but the
necessity of getting back to England
in 1913, in time for the Triangular Test
Matches, prevented him from going in
first with WINE every time. (Loud
cheers.) He had only one criticism
to make of WINE’s play, and that
was that he wanted more initials.

MARGINAL NOTES ON HISTORY.
Joy OF PEASANTS AT HEARING MAGNA CHARTA READ TO THEM IN THE ORIGINAL LATIN,
A FLY ON THE LINE.
I Don't think I observed the fly
before the train stopped for the third
time at Messington Junction. But as
soon as I did I perceived that there
was something unusual about him. He
was crawling steadily along the “six-
foot,” and above his head were hovering
two other flies. I have forgotten how
many hundred facets the eye of a fly
has, but I know that indomitable pur-
pose and iron resolution were written
upon every single facet of each of this
one's, and in a moment I realised what
he was doing. He was racing the train
for a wager, and the other two flies
were referees, to prevent him from
taking an unfair advantage by using
his wings.
Now I do not wish this little narra-
tive to be disbelieved, and so I frankly
admit that the train (although it was a
“through" train on the Great West
Central Railway during the fourth
stage of “strike” runnings) travelled
considerably faster between the stations
than the fly. But the train stopped
for a long time at every station, and it
also stopped three times at every station.
It was a very long train. It was almost
as long as one of Mr. MASEFIELD's
poems in The English Review. And
some of its carriages to the people
waiting on the platform, and then its
middle and then its tail. It reminded
me of the Chimaera. It reminded me of
all Gaul. It reminded me of essence
of wormwood. And of course during
these stoppages the fly had its chance
of making up lost ground. It was the
old story of the hare and the tortoise,
though any hare that had not been
jugged would have had the legs of my
train. It was while we lay at anchor
off Toadworthy that the fly first showed
signs of flagging. And, fortunately, it
was at Toadworthy also that the
man with the bag of biscuits and the
bottle of ginger-beer moved into the
last available space in my corridor.
As he had started the day before
from Palmerston, which is over eighty
miles distant, and there was no refresh-
ment car on the train, he was some-
what hungry; but all the same I begged
a few crumbs of biscuit and some drops
of ginger-beer from him, and baited
the fly out of the carriage window.
The gallant creature was evidently re-
invigorated and made a splendid spurt.
His legs were going about thirty-two to
the minute, but five was getting a trifle
late. By this time he was naturally an
object of considerable interest to all the
passengers on his side of the train, and
out of the windows and bets were
being laid on him. I still think he
would have won had it not been for
the down-slope which begins just after
Poppicombe and Mortleigh. In taking
a down-slope the Great West Central
Railway, even during a coal-strike, is
second to none in verve and sprightli-
ness, and whilst we were still some
twelve miles from Ditchwater, he threw
up the sponge. We all took off our hats
and gave him arousing cheer ashefaded
away slowly in the distance behind us.
It was a foolhardy but heroic effort,
and our English hearts went out to him.
The moral of this true anecdote is of
course that we are very glad that the
coal-strike is now over, and we hope
that the Great West Central Railway
will soon get to hear about it.
“‘What is the meaning of the X on the
brewer's barrel l'asked a curious questioner at
the lunch table. And the frivolous replier said
that it was the first syllable of “excellent.”

- (2) Units will proceed to elect a
General of Brigade who will appoint
not fewer than ten Section Com-
manders, each of whom will take
rank as “Officer in command of
Picks,” “Officer in command of
Mustards,” &c., &c.
(3) Units will then rally to their
respective commanders, who will as-
certain the highest price offered by
any unit in his section, and will
then give the word of command as
follows: “Pair salts, fourteen-and-
six, right about, fiſth floor," where-

after his first unit has gone to the
front, will agree for some other gift
after consultation with other Sec-
tional Commanders, and will give
the word to advance to the highest
remaining bidder, until every unit in
turn has been sent forward. If any
unit, through habit or other mental
infirmity, is unable to think of any
other gift than his original choice, or
one which has been already allotted,
that unit will receive the word of
command and will forthwith order
one of the articles listed above, or, if
the list has been exhausted, as many
gallons of petrol as his proffered
subscription will buy, and the per-
sonal taste exercised in that unit's
choice will be limited to the colour
of the tin. No fractions of a gallon
will be bought, but the balance, if
any, will be spent on cotton waste.
(5) No cases will be bought, except
for solid gold or jewelled goods. Any
unit attempting, for instance, to buy
a pair of plated saltspoons listed at
3s.6d. in a shagreen satin-lined case
costing seven-and-ninepence, will
have his invitation cancelled and his
name deleted from the confectioner's
list for wedding cake.

AT THE PLAY.
“IMPROPER PETER."
I AM not permitted to see into the
recesses of Mr. MoscRTON. HoFFE's
mind, and so I cannot say what it was
that induced him to believe (if he did
believe) that his farce at the Garrick
was a comedy. He started out, I
imagine, to make merry over the
embarrassments of a middle-aged
gentleman, into whose perfectly honest
hands—for the epithet “improper”
is only a catchword, applicable to a
period prior to the rise of the curtain
—has fallen the protection of a solitary
female in distress. He then, I further
imagine, discovered that the position
of this friendless girl, whom a feeble
creature had promised to
marry “in the sight of
Heaven” (Heaven in these
cases being treated as
slightly myopic), had in it
such an element of pitiful-
ness that it would never do
to describe the play as a
farce. Yet the situation
and most of the characters
remain farcical, and we are
left in doubt of the author's
tact in allowing a young
girl, in so painful a plight,
to be placed in an environ-
ment so ludicrous. The
stage has made one familiar
with this kind of situation,
but it is commonly reserved
for married women or
divorcées, or those, at any
rate, who are better able to
ness of men of the world and embroiders
its sins with a specious phraseology;
but during much of the First Act one
simply concluded that his voice and
manner were as wrong as they could
be. “You don't understand l’ he kept
saying—a phrase, by the way, that
occurred more than once on other lips.
And he was right: I didn't understand.
The scenery was happier than the
things that went on inside it. The
conversation on deck in the First Act
was rather second-rate, and made me
wonder whether the Royal Yacht
Squadron knew much about Peter's
friends when they elected him to their
fastidious corporation; and all the
business of the liqueurs and the fan-
tastic toast that went with them was
Walter Stancombe on his head; he
chose however to do it on his feet,
and was inimitable in that position.
Mr. BourchIER did not seem quite to
realize himself in this scene; at times
he was in deadly earnest, at others his
interest appeared to wander. But he
had had a good deal to go through.
He had been loath to forego his ancient
reputation as the pink of impropriety,
but was bound in honour to adopt
a parental attitude towards the girl
committed to his charge. He had
watched his emotions suffering a
sea-change into something more senti-
mental; and, while for the girl's sake
he had had to repudiate the base in-
sinuations of his wife, for his own he
had privily rejoiced at this excuse for a
divorce. In the result I am
not sure that his versatility
did itself full justice. Miss
JULIA JAMEs as Periwinkle
was rather wooden in her
gestures, but perhaps this
was right; anyhow she came
very well out of a difficult
task. Mrs. RALEIGH's nice
voice and other attractive
gifts were thrown away on
the invidious part of the
wife. The exchange of
national dress and manners,
as made between Elliot
Hay, U.S.A. (Mr. CAREw)
and George Plumley (Mr.
WEGUELIN), made a very
pleasant diversion in a play
which, though it has its
good qualities, is not likely
to immortalize its author,

price of harrowing emotions
aroused by a helpless girl's predicament.
Conscious, perhaps, of this defect in his
scheme, the author (assisted by Mr.
BourchIER in his most unbelievable
mood) sought to impart a high gravity
to Peter's defence of her and expected
us to take it quite seriously; but
this defence was almost as laughable
as anything in the play, thanks to the
absurdity of its milieu. The fact is,
it is easy enough to introduce comic
relief into a serious theme, but the
converse process is fraught with
appalling difficulties.
One's appreciation of the author's
motives, if any, was not greatly helped
by the performance of Mr. HERBERT
SLEATH in the part of the young man
whose elopement with Periwinkle was
frustrated by his father's intervention.
One gathered subsequently that he was
trying to satirize the attitude of an age
forced. The Second Act showed
us the saloon of The Nut with a
sectional view of the sea. One has of
course seen the river in Das Rheingold
so treated, but I never remember to
have had the sea presented to me in
this architectural aspect. There was
also a fat pinnace permanently fixed
and affording a very adroit cover for
the arrival and departure of The Nut’s
visitors. The extremely small dimen-
sions of the saloon, which at one time
was required to hold almost the entire
cast, had the bijou air which one
associates with private theatricals,
On the other hand the spacious
drawing-room of the Third Act offered
ample accommodation for the most
incredible Court of Enquiry that was
ever conducted, Royal Commissions not
excepted. Mr. FRED KERR, who took
a leading hand in its manipulation,

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT will, no doubt, be excellent news for the many admirers
of Incomparable Bellairs that her creators, AGNES and
EGERTON CASTLE, have now given to the world certain
further adventures of this fascinating lady, in a book called
Love Gilds the Scene (SMITH, ELDER). I protest 'tis a title
vastly well-suited to the matter of the tales, since all of
them turn upon some pretty affair of gallantry or tender
intrigue. As for the manner of them, because the great
quality of eighteenth-century fiction is atmosphere, and
this is far more difficult of attainment in a short story
than a long, you must not be surprised if they suffer a
little from their brevity. But for all that the adventures
are excellently entertaining; comedies, light and artificial
as the time itself, with scarcely a note graver than the
lamentation of some jilted exquisite or the half-serious
distress of a fair lady over the fickleness of her lord. And
through them the lovely Kitty Bellairs, now promoted to
Lady Kilcroney, takes her elegant and devastating way,
string-pulling with all the grace and skill imaginable. Of
her exploits, I think I best liked that in which she foiled
the plot of a jealous rival, who had purposed that the
country bride of Beau Stafford (another old friend) should
appear at Bath races a figure of fun in green and cherry-
colour. How Kitty Kilcroney detects this, re-dresses the
chit in record time, and winds up her triumph by presenting
a blushing beauty to H.R.H., can better be read than de-
than Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT has done for the Potteries. Mr.
BENNETT makes the Five Towns romantic; Mr. JEPson
makes Chiswick lurid. In the last book of his that I read,
Chiswick was enjoying a jolly bout of human sacrifices in
the back garden; in The House on the Mall (HUTCHINsoN)
it is suffering from a spasm of murders indoors. I have
always held that the only really readable novels of sensation
are those written, tongue in cheek, by men capable of better
things. The House on the Mall goes to strengthen this
theory. Even when the blood is pouring its thickest and
the thunder rolling its loudest, Mr. JEpson never loses his
distinction. His characters live, even when they are dying
violently. The Marquess of Drysdale, alias that simultaneous
criminal duo, Paul Mauleverer and Andrew Rawnsley (he is
both of them in turns), is a delightful character, who makes
Professor MoRIARTY, N.O.C. (Napoleon of Crime), seem like
a curate. For one moment, in Chapter XXIX., I was afraid
that he was about to forget himself and vulgarly murder a
guest with a knife; but I was swiftly reassured. Instead,
he let him down in a lift into an underground cell beneath
the Thames, shut him in and drowned him, like the fine old
English gentleman he was. Another acquaintance he dis-
posed of by dropping him into a cellar, the floor of which
was a sort of sinister Joy-Wheel, doing—like some South
American Republic—its 250 revolutions a minute. Finally,
I should like to add that the real EDGAR JEPsoN peeps
out at intervals throughout the story in some comedy
chapters full of excellent dialogue between the only three

A keen sense of humour, an intimate knowledge of
Dublin, and an X-ray-like insight into the souls of char-
women, policemen, labourers, labourers' wives, young Irish
patriots and children, are the qualities which enabled
Mr. JAMEs STEPHENs to make The Charwoman's Daughter

his psychological analysis of the policeman that Mr.

forgotten many another character in contemporary fiction.
Never after this, though I may not agree with Mary's
mother, the charwoman, who held that “their continual
pursuit of and intercourse with criminals tended to
deteriorate their moral tone,” can I feel quite the same
towards the Force. You see, this policeman of Mary's was
a snob. He courted
its series of short sharp paragraphs, reads too much like a
précis to be entirely satisfactory as a novel. Drinks should
not be over-watered, but too much spirits should not be
taken neat; which brings me back to the story, whose hero,
if he had not consumed so much neat brandy, would have
married Viola Wymondham quite early on and ceased to be
of interest. I do not remember having previously watched
the averting of an undesired marriage by the process of
deliberately intoxicating the lover in the presence of his
mistress, and I am not over-anxious to watch it again.
But in this instance the brutal thing is so well done and is
so much part and parcel of a fine study that it is not only
forgivable but legitimate. I advise those in search of a good
book to read this one in small doses, closing it from time to
time and pausing to deduce for themselves the moral which

stepped out of the back of beyond. He hurries around
doing good deeds and distributing money, then he loses

in the end love and justice are triumphant. This is a first

THE STRIKE OF TAILORS.
(Thoughts after a visit to the Itoyal Academy.)
TAILoRs! Your insurrection rives my heart!
I was to have a waistcoat made,
An evening waistcoat, proper to a smart
Occasion, fitting close as suéde,
With points depending halfway to the kneo,
And now—it cannot be!
Inside its virgin Samite as I sat,
The cynosure of eyes, the hub
Of incidental conversation at .
The Poets' Self-effacement Club,
I should have made my mark, I feel convinced,
Upon the 18th inst. - -
Strikes I have borne ere now, as Britons can,
With clicek unblenched, with head sublime;
When coal was off I faced it like a man
(Being out of England at the time);
But this comes nearer home ; this new unrest
Touches me on the chest.
The moment you select is too unfair–
Now, when our youth would fain rehearse
The change from vernal bloom to summer wear;
And yet you might have done far worse,
Might have declined, last season, to compose
Our Coronation clo's.
What we had lost if you had struck just then,
Burlington House is witness: here,
Figures from that high pageant live again,
Posing in full official gear -
(Notably I remark the very natty
- Suit of Sir A. Scott-GATTY).
Harder the blow, though this were hard enough,
Had you refused to ply your thread
For common portraits where the tailored stuff
Kindly eclipses face and head ; -
You would have ruined half the staple toil
Of such as work in oil.
So, when I think what havoc might have been
In Art's domain, I am resigned
To waive my waistcoat, and with soul serene,
'Walking the Park, to view my kind
Enforced, in Summer airs, to trail the Spring's
Belated trouserings. O. S.

“An item which was deservedly appreciated and encored was
Chopin's Pollonaise ‘Sea Miner.'"—Iſeºford Free Press.
“One diner at a City restaurant yesterday had just reached the
fish at 2.30, when his favourite waiter, with an apologetic cough, in-
gratiatingly remarked, ‘Shall you require anything more, sir? I have
to go to luncheon myself now, sir.’ This is compulsory under the
Act.”—Daily Mail. - * - - - - - *
There will be an outcry when the first waiter is sent to
prison for omitting the apologetic cough.
“An unattended perambulator, containing a baby, at Willesden

and dropped into the water. Walter Norwood, who witnessed the

baby, and handed it over to its mother.

THE SECOND CITY.
May, 1912.--The news that Glasgow is seeking parlia-
mentary powers to increase her boundaries and swallow
up Govan, Partick, and other suburbs, has been received
in Liverpool with no little consternation and dismay.
Despite the exceedingly disappointing results of the 1911
census, it must not be supposed that the enterprising
seaport on the Mersey ever lost hope. On the contrary,
it was full of confidence in its ability to make up the
necessary leeway before the close of the present decade.
It is now, however, estimated that Greater Glasgow will
contain over one million inhabitants, and Liverpool recog-
nises that unless effective action is taken at once there
will no longer be any room for doubt—even among its own
optimistic inhabitants—as to which is the Second City of
the Empire.
September, 1912–Our Special Correspondent learns that
the Liverpool Municipality now hopes to promote a Bill
in Parliament with a view to incorporate Birkenhead,
Wallasey, and—probably—Ormskirk. Doubt has been
expressed, however, in local circles as to whether this will
quite do it, some authorities declaring that the total will
still be a few thousands short. The figures for the last
census are being closely scanned, and it is probable that—
in order to make assurance double sure—Poulton-cum-
Seacombe may be thrown in at the last moment.
January, 1915.--Glasgow has annexed Paisley. A muni-
cipal medal has been struck to celebrate the event.
May, 1915.-It is understood that Liverpool—after the
recent appropriation of Hoylake and Lower Bebington–
presented an ultimatum to the Lord Provost of Glasgow.
Its actual terms have not transpired, but there can be
little doubt that it pointed out the hopelessness of con-
tinuing the struggle and drew attention to the vast
population of South Lancashire, all eagerly awaiting the
invitation to dub themselves citizens of the Second City.
January, 1931–The inclusion of Falkirk within the
area of Greater Glasgow, while not in itself of any
importance, has caused a growing feeling of uneasiness
on the banks of the Mersey. It has been noticed that
Glasgow's expansion in the last decade has all been in an
easterly direction; and this sinister fact is a source of
deep anxiety to her rival. -- ~
Later.—Liverpool has taken over Warrington.
; January, 1932–There is nothing at all startling in the
New Year Annexations, published to-day. It may be
assumed that London is quite prepared to move swiftly and
effectively, should any of the threatened combinations in
the North imperil her supremacy.
January, 1933.−The blow has fallen. Greater Glasgow
has to-day roped in Edinburgh, Leith, Portobello and Fish-
errow. Greater Liverpool's obvious counter-stroke has
unexpectedly failed, as Greater Manchester has escaped
from her clutches and grabbed Greater 13irmingham on her
own account. A frightful struggle is in prospect between
the two Lancashire cities for the possession of Greater
Widnes. . - , , ,
January, 1953.−Since the discovery of unlimited gold (in
enormous nuggets of great purity) in the immediate vicinity
of Ventnor no census has been taken in the Isle of Wight.
But experts are now convinced that Greater Ventnor is
already the Second City of the Empire.
“The water is less cold than has been felt two months later than
it was this year the first week in April."—Guernsey Jºeckly Press.

MORNING-POST-IMPRESSIONISM.
[Being a feeble attempt to rival the inimitable
literary methods and profound musical know-
ledge of the musical critic of The Morning Post,
who, in the issue of May 2, included Tristan und
Isolde in the Ring.]
To complete the present cycle of
Wagnerian music-dramas VERDI's Car-
men was performed last Saturday at
the Royal Opera. Originally composed
as a lever de rideau by the veteran
Italian maestro, under the title, Il
Barbiere di Siviglia, the opera is now
universally accepted as a typical work,
and its performances are greeted with
generous toleration by the opera-going
public, though it cannot be seriously
contended that the ethical significance
of the story conduces to the mainte-
nance of a decorous conception of civic
life.
The performance was for the most
part in such capable hands, or perhaps
we should say, throats, that the meri-
toriousness of the rendition appealed
with convincing force to the more
serious-minded section of the auditors.
Madame Fritzi Langerzahn has ap-
peared many hundred times in the part
of Carmen, but on this occasion, as
during the whole of her present engage-
redoubtable dimensions upon her previ-
ous efforts. She met every demand
on her resources with a determination
that evinced great physical energy re-
inforced by patient artistic study of the
most compelling verisimilitude, and her
handling of the castanets in the scene
when the infatuated dragoon violates
the dictates of discipline at the call of
amorous inclination elicited unstinted
panegyrics from all quarters of the
house.
Signor Tombolini, as Don José, sus-
tained his share in the representa-
tion with more than all his wonted
zest, though he did not invariably
succeed in furnishing the chaste quality
of timbre to which he has familiarised
his numerous admirers. One could not
help feeling that to an artist of his
sensitive temperament the somewhat
glaring scheme of colour embodied in
the integuments of his nether man
must have impaired the equanimity
which as a rule he is so fortunate in
being able to evolve from the recesses
But,
of his dramatic imagination.
with these reservations, his impersona-
tion was marked by a gallant and
soldierlike bearing such as one might
naturally expect in an officer, even
to a race renowned for their peninsular
dignity.
Herr Hugo Rumpelmayer remains
the best representative of the tauri-
cidal gladiator that has yet emerged
on the metropolitan boards. His
range of facial expression, indicative
of the whole gamut of emotion, is a
masterpiece of lineamental exposition.
The Micaela of the cast was Madame
Gemma d'Antichità, whose impeccable
demureness of demeanour invested the
rôle with an ingenuous archness wholly
germane to the situation. In Mlle.
Eugénie Pipette was found a Mercedes
of greater youthfulness than usual, but
her appearance supported her rich
vocal tone. The reception of the work
was marked by a cordiality which
testified how fully the audience ap-
preciated the meritorious efforts of the
artists concerned in a thoroughly con-
scientious rendition.
The Daily Chronicle denies the exist-
ence of “caves” among the Ministerial-
ists, and protests that the Government
Fº is “far from being the cause of
dry-rot.” But does this prove any-
thing? We ourselves have often noticed
the absence of dry-rot as a feature of

ment, she indicated an advance of

But it was a

“Samuel,” I said gravely, tapping
him on the shoulder, “I shall have to

He turned round with a start.
“Hallo!” he said eagerly. “How
splendid! But, my dear old chap, why
aren't you in costume?”
“I am,” I explained. “I’ve come
as an architect. Luckily the evening
clothes of an architect are similar to
my own. Excuse me, Sir, but do you
want a house built 2 ” -
“How do you like my dress? I am an
executioner. I left my axe in the cloak-
room.”
“So I observe. You know, in real life
one hardly ever meets an executioner
who wears spectacles. And yet, of
course, if one can't see the head

“By Jove,” said Simpson, “there she
is again.”
Columbine in a mask hurried past
us and mixed with the crowd. What
one could see of her face looked pretty;
it seemed to have upset Simpson alto-
gether.
“Ask her for a dance,” I suggested.
“Be a gay dog, Simpson. Wake London
up. At a masked ball one is allowed a
certain amount of licence.” * .
“Exactly,” said Simpson in some
excitement. “One naturally looks for
a little Continental abandon at these
dances.” (Portrait of Simpson showing
Continental abandon.) “And so I did
ask her for a dance just now.” . .
“She was cold, Samuel, I fear?”
“She said, “Sorry, I'm full up.’”
“A ruse, a mere subterfuge. Now,
look here, ask her again, and be more
debonair and dashing this time. What
you want is to endue her with the spirit
of revelry. Perhaps you'd better go to
the bar first and have a dry ginger-
ale, and then you'll feel more in the

“By Jove, I will,” said Simpson
with great decision.
I wandered into the ball-room and
looked round. Columbine was standing
in a corner alone; some bounder had
cut her dance. As I looked at her I
thought of Simpson letting himself go

edge of the smile and unconsciously
smiled back. Remembering the good
advice which I had just given another,

“In Lent,” I agreed, “one has to

Shall we just finish off this dance 2
And don't let's talk shop about

We finished the dance and retired to
the stairs. º -
“I want you to do something for me,”
I began cautiously.
“Anything except go into supper
again. I've just done that for some-
body else.” . . .
“No, it's not that. The fact is I have
a great friend called Simpson.”
“It sounds a case for help,” she
murmured.
“He is here to-night disguised as an
executioner in glasses. He is, in fact,
the only spectacled beheader present.
You can't miss him.” -
“All the same, I managed to just
now,” she gurgled.
“I know. He asked you for a dance
and you rebuffed him. Well, he is now
fortifying himself with a small dry
ginger, and he will then ask you again.
Do be kind this time; he's really a
delightful person when you get to
know him. For instance, both his
whiskers are false.”
“No doubt I should grow to love
him,” she agreed; “but I didn't much

“He is naturally as harmless as a
lamb,” I said; “but at a dance like
this he considers it his duty to throw
a little Continental abandon into his

Columbine looked at me thought-
fully, nodding her head, and slowly
began to smile.
“You see,” I said, “the possibilities.”
“He shall have his dance,” she said
decidedly. -
“Thank you very much. I should
like to ask for another dance for myself
later on, but I am afraid I should try
to get out of you what he said, and
that wouldn't be fair.” - -
“Of course I shouldn't tell you.”
“Well, anyhow, you'll have had
enough of us by then. Oh, by the
way,” I added, as we walked back, “I
think I ought to inform you that I'm

“Oh, I say, old chap,” he began
jauntily, “do you know—match,

“You’re too old to go to a circus
now, Simpson. Come and have a day

“Don’t be an ass; it's a place like
Oxford Circus. I suppose it's in the
City somewhere 2 I wonder,” he mur-
mured to himself, “what she would be
doing in the City at eleven o'clock in the
morning.”
“Perhaps her rich uncle is in a bank,
and she wants to shoot him. I wish
you'd tell me what you're talking
about.”
Simpson took off his mask and
spectacles and wiped his brow.
“Dear old chap,” he said in a solemn
voice, “in the case of a woman one
cannot tell even one's best friend. You
know how it is.”
“Well, if there's going to be a duel
you should have chosen some quieter
spot than Finsbury Circus. The motor-
'buses distract one's aim.”
Simpson was silent for a minute
or two. Then a foolish smile flitted
across his face, to be followed suddenly
by a look of alarm.
“Don’t do anything that your
mother wouldn't like,” I said warningly.
He frowned and put on his mask
again.
“Are chrysanthemums in season 2'
he asked casually. “Anyhow, I sup-
pose I could always get a yellow one 2"
“You could, Simpson. And you
could put it in your button-hole, so
that you can be recognised, and go to
Finsbury Circus to meet somebody at
eleven o'clock to-morrow morning.
Samuel, I'm ashamed of you. Er—

“At the Carlton. Old chap, I got
quite carried away. Things seemed to
be arranged before I knew where I was.”
“And what's she going to wear so
that you can recognise her?”
“Yes,” said Simpson, getting up,
“that's the worst of it. I told her it
was quite out of date, and that only
the suburbs wore fashions a year old,
but she insisted on it. I had no idea
she was that sort of girl. Well, I'm

went off for another ginger-ale.
I think that I must be at Finsbury
Circus to-morrow, for certainly no

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIAlty of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, April 29.
—The ways of the honourable Member
who desires to take opportunity pro-
vided by the Question-hour to obtain
cheap advertisement are not past find-
ing out. On the contrary, they are
almost childish in their ingenuousness.
Most common form is to nip in with
a supplementary question, if possible
conveying personal aspersion upon
Minister addressed or some of his col-
leagues. To-day, as it happened,
there has been outbreak in another
direction.
Standing Order
directs that at a quarter
to four catechism shall
be cut off and business
of Sitting entered upon.
But there is a proviso
that questions of an
urgent character, which
have not appeared on
notice-paper, may be
put, albeit the allotted
time is fulfilled. It is
here where opportunity
of gentleman with his
eye on the newspapers
comes in. Ordinary
Member who, in obedi-
ence to command, has
duly given notice of a
question, is not per-
mitted to recite its
terms. All he may do
is to refer to its number
on the printed paper.
His shrewder brother,
announcing a question
of which he says he
“has given the right
honourable gentleman
private notice,” is privi-
leged, amid silence of expectant
House, to read its terms, which, with
the Minister's reply, appear verbatim in
Parliamentary reports.
Object of the proviso apparent.
Occasion might easily arise where sud-
den occurrence of urgent moment would
justify LEADER of OPPosition or other
representative Member in asking for
instant information. The private notice
questions put to-day, of which there
were four or five, had no more claim to
urgency than had the average interro-
gations standing on the printed paper.
However, there they were. They

, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“LovE—AND what THEN ?"
It was bad luck for Mr. CYRII, MAUDE
that he should have missed the best
part of the play through coming in only
just in time to see the curtain fall on
the First Act. Up to the point of his
episcopal entrance, “signalised,” as the
cricket reporters say, by a clap of
thunder (as though he were a demon),
The Vicar's wife gets a short Pierrette skirt
as a preliminary to a high kick over the traces.
Rev. John Burden ... Mr. GAYER MACKAY.
Mrs. Burden ... ... Miss MA 1:GEity MAUDE.
we had been having some really excel-
lent and natural light-comedy; but for
the rest of the time, if one excepts a
delightful scene between the three
clerical types, the author was perhaps
a little inclined to press for his effects;
requiring, indeed, in the last resort, to
fall back upon a mislaid baby and a
squirted soda-siphon, always a confes-
sion of weakness.
His motive, too, became a little ob-
scure. We were constantly asked to
keep on being merry on the edge of a
rumbling volcano; and the ultimate
emergence of a mere mouse never satis-
fied us that the supply of lava was
exhausted. And may I respectfully beg
Mr. MACDONALD HASTINGs not to blend
his tears and laughter too light-heart-
edly; not to play about with the
emotions of his audience; not, for in-
stance, to make a wife say of her lover,
with a fine resolve, “I shall nover see
him again,” and then let us down
with the flippancy, “I shan't have the
opportunity " ? Mr. BARRIE, being
privileged, has the sole rights in this
kind. - -
The burlesque of the melodramatic
stage in the Second Act might have
been fairly amusing if it had not been
time. But worse was to follow in the
Third Act. There is nothing more
deadly than to announce beforehand
that an event is to happen at a certain
time and then put a clock on the stage
so that the audience may know exactly
how long their patience has to be tried
with stop-gap dialogue. It was all
timed to a nicety; but in the mean-
while some of us were in full sympathy
with the bishop, who frankly went to
sleep.
It was not Mr. MAUDE's fault that
his rôle was too easy for him, too
familiar; and that his bishop might
just as well have been an admiral or
a general officer or a country squire,
except that the liberality of his out-
look took on a certain piquancy from
the fact of his being a hierarch. -
As a young wife in revolt against her
husband's clerical discipline Miss MAR-
GERY MAUDP was always charming, and,
in the First Act, fairly understandable
also. Afterwards one became worried by
the thought that she didn't know what
she wanted, but wouldn't be happy till
she got it. The lady's simplicity was
a little too disingenuous, her naïveté a
little too complex. And I frankly sus-
pect that the innocent wife who wants
to be kissed hard by a man who is not
her husband in order to know what it
feels like, irrespectively of the lovable-
ness of the kisser, is a type of fledgling
not to be found under just any hedge.
The one really satisfactory perform-
ance was that of Mr. GAYER MACKAY
as the Rev. John Burden, her husband.
I have seldom seen a better or more
convincing deportment. One so rarely
finds a clergyman on the stage who is
neither heroic nor ludicrous, neither
angel nor ass. In a part that might
easily have been made laughable Mr.
MACRAY preserved a reasonable and
even sympathetic dignity and seemed
veritably born to the cloth. Mr. ERNEST
GRAHAM, as the Bishop's chaplain, was
extremely funny. Gauche and taciturn,
untouched by the diversions of musical-
chairs or hunt-the-slipper, he suddenly
found his humanity in a shattering out-
burst of enthusiasm over the fielding of
a certain Somersetshire cover-point.
Miss FRANCEs Ivor, as Mrs. Burden,
senior, was excellent with the good
things she was given to say in the
First Act, but they did not last out;
and aſter this mother of ten had told
us that she had never loved her late
husband, and that her babies would
have been no bar to her leaving him if
she had not run short of good nurses,
the sentimental note on which she
made her final exit left me rather cold.
Mr. MATURIN had a thankless and un-
heroic part as a philandering Sapper,
of manner. The Misses CELLI and
GREATwich were satisfactory flappers;
but they should be told that even flap-
pers may have the joie de vivre without
necessarily breaking into a delirious
gallop, when they go off the stage.
I will add that Mr. BRUCE SMITH's
drawing-room at the Vicarage was a
real room that must have been lived in.
Whatever I may have said to the
contrary notwithstanding, I enjoyed
the play very much and laughed loudly
and often. But in the retrospect my
logical mind rebels against its incon-
clusiveness. ' The question in the title,
Love—and What Then 3 remains un-
answered. It recalls to me a familiar
elegiac composition by a fourth-form
boy on the theme “Femina durfacti.”
This couplet, it will be remembered, took
the form of the following dialogue:–
“Femina dux facti." “‘Facti dux feminat'
Quid tum ?”
4 : º, ºr Tºm facti ſemina dux ſuit.”
The curtain-raiser, Before Breakfast,
by the author of Rutherford dº Son, was
a most attractive trifle. Here we have
a cadet of good family who has adopted
Socialistic views, professedly on their
abstract merits, but actually to provide
argument in support of his intended
marriage with a chorus-girl. But when
he finds that he has been deceived
about her origin, that she is, in point
of fact, sister to his mother's own
kitchenmaid, his emancipated theories
are proved inadequate to meet the new
conditions. The scene is freshly laid
in the library of a house at an hour
when the family is not yet down and
the servants are in occupation, the
butler (nicely played by Mr. HARwood)
being engaged in reading a report in
his “special” of his young master's
projected mésalliance. Mr. LAwRENce

considerable inward satisfaction, but to
me brings only a sense of haunting
disquiet and invariably throws me into
a cold perspiration. It is the game of
horrors, and begins with the ill-omened
word “supposing.” Usually my wife's

indulgence in this recreation is inspired
by the contemplation of a problem

merged into that shade of contempla-

the game of horrors. There is, I
suppose, some subtle thread which in-
extricably unites the frivolous and the
gruesome. I must ask a psychologist
about this.
Innocently I sat sipping my mild
whiskey-and-soda before retiring to
rest. -
“Supposing,” said my wiſe suddenly,
“that I was run over by a taxi and
terribly disfigured.”
“Why?" I asked mildly.
“Well, I want to know what you
would do.” -
“I should be dreadfully upset,” I
siggested after a moment's considera-
tion.
| My wife tapped her foot impatiently.
“What else?” she demanded.
“I should try to get damages out of
the company,” said I, with a flash of
inspiration. -
“And what of me?” demanded my
wife tragically, “with my scarred, dis-
torted face? You couldn't possibly
care for me any more.”
“Of course I should.” Practise this
as I may and honestly as I mean it, I
simply cannot say the words with the
smallest trace of sincerity or conviction.
“Or suppose,” mused my wife, “that
I just had my nose crushed and was
obliged to have it amputated.”
“‘Sing a song o' sixpence,’” said I
with forced, but relevant, jocularity.
“Could you care for anyone without
a nose ?” she insisted.
“I have never tried.”
“I know you couldn't," she returned
with bitter conviction, “not even in
the dark.”
“If it was you I shouldn't mind—
that is—at least—oh, you know, dear."
The cold perspiration began to set in
as, in response to a frantic summons to
my dignity, I grew conscious that my
voice and countenance were merely
becoming permeated with an expression
of sheepish apology.
my wiſe more cheerfully, “that I sus-
tained terrible internal injuries and had
to lie on my back all day. How would
you like being burdened with me?"
I finished my whiskey-and-soda at a
gulp. “I don't like this game at all,”
I said. - - - - - -
“The refuge of one who dare not make
a truthful answer. But you are right;
it would be far, far better for me to be
in my grave and you free to marry
someone else. Do you think you would
choose a fair or a dark one next time 2"
“Piebald,” said I.
“I had hardly thought,” returned
my wife with dignity, “that my sudden
death was a fit subject for jest.”
“It isn't a fit subject for conversa-
tion,” I objected.
“Of course you would marry again?”
she urged almost coaxingly.
“You can't imagine that after my
first lamentable experience—" I began
with elaborate facetiousness.
My wife checked me with a glance.
“Can you never be serious? Would
you tell her about me?” she proceeded.
“She'd be sure to want to know which
you liked best.” -
“I never gratify idle curiosity,” said I.
“So you would, then 2 " .
“What would 3 ''
“You would marry again?”
“I never said so.”
“You said that you wouldn't gratify
her idle curiosity.”
“Well, nor I would.” The cold per-

“There you are again.”
“Well, I mean if I did I wouldn't,”
said I with painful lucidity.
“So you think you would 2" insisted
my wife. -
“I'm perfectly certain I should not.”
Bemused as I was, I felt this to be
a brilliant effort and wondered vaguely
why I had not thought of it before.
“Oh, you just say that to satisfy
me,” accused my wife. -
It was the most astoundingly true
observation that she has ever made in
her life, and it fairly shook my mental
balance. For a moment I was speech-
less as I watched the wounded dis-
approval of her countenance. Then:
“I don't understand the rules,” I
pleaded, “and surely it is my turn to
do the supposing."
“Oh, very well,” she agreed un-
willingly.
“Supposing, then,” I launched out
desperately, “that I had been having
a little flutter in the oil market.
Supposing that catastrophe upon

you trimmed yourself. Supposing,”
I continued graphically, “that we were
obliged to knock off cream for tea; to
descend to bloaters for dinner, to dis-
miss the cook and promote the tweenie

But at this point I was stopped and
allowed to proceed no further. My
wife stood facing me, her burning eyes
gazing into mine. ' - -
“So that was your pressing business
in the City,” she said in a vibrating
voice. “Oh, Harold, you a gambler—
and a ruined one !” -
“You aren't playing properly,” I
objected. “I'm certain you oughtn't
to have said that, especially if I did it
all for your sake.”
She turned away. “I think you
have broken my heart,” she said.
“Wrong again,” said I, and then
suddenly I saw that her face was wet.

my wife that our capital, still unim-

she left me feeling like a remorseful

pleted my mental collapse.
“If people who have no imagination,”
she said decisively, “would only recog-
nize their limitations, much unhappi-
ness would be spared to those who are
obliged to associate with them."
I rose with a sigh and helped myself
to another whiskey-and-soda—a strong
one this time.

ONE way of being optimistic, of course, is to refuse to
look at the ugly facts of life and so to arrive at the belief
that they do not exist—a method which is perhaps more
practicable when applied to affairs other than one's own.
Maiden ladies of lordly lineage and old-time sweetness
may live by a road as destitute and disreputable as Hog
Lane and yet remain convinced that the world is happily
and entirely free of such evils as destitution and disrepute.
They need only keep down the blinds of those windows
which look out upon the Lane and they are left with the
view of their own garden and with no knowledge of any less
peaceful and proper existence on the other side of the house.
This the Misses Mauleverer did, and Mr. HoRACE ANNESLEY
VACHELL has caught them doing it. Furthermore he has
discovered the whole town of Charminster in gentle con-
spiracy to maintain the ladies in their illusion by keeping
sedulously from their eyes and ears all incidents, local or
world-wide, which might prove upsetting to their comfortable
beliefs. But Mr. WACHELL insists upon the facts being faced,
and ultimately Shame, not to be confined to Hog Lane, ap-
i. in the garden. Nor is It left there, for, when all the
linds are pulled down, It comes into the very house itself
and must at last be beheld. One error of taste or sign of
excess would have ruined this dainty story; mawkish senti-
mentality might well have resulted. With pleasure, there-
fore, I hereby certify that I have examined Blinds Down

I daresay you will be astonished to find that Mr. P. G.
Wodehouse is the latest exploiter of the imaginary king-
dom, in a story that he has called The Prince and Betty
(MILLs AND Boon). Somehow, though I don't know
exactly why, I had not expected this of Mr. Wodehouse.
But because he is an author with a reputation, highly
deserved, for whimsicality it was a relief to find that the
trappings of Ruritania are worn by him with a certain
difference. Though Prince John, the central figure, was a
young man of a type not unusual in fictional royalty,
the real power behind the tinsel throne of Mervo was
Mr. Scobel, the multi-millionaire financier, who was running
the kingdom as an attractive setting to his casino, and
wanted John's help as combined figure-head and advertise-
ment. It was with this idea that Mr. Scobel had turned
out the republic, and arranged a picturesque restoration for
the rightful heir, a Cambridge undergraduate who had
been brought up in ignorance of his own identity. So
John came to Mervo, and met Betty, and the story resulted.
It is quite an entertaining story of its improbable kind,
and Mr. Wodehouse makes his puppets dance, in sprightly
fashion enough, through a series of amusing adventures
till they reach the inevitable pairing off in the last chapter.
I cannot add that any one of them has more than a super-
ficial resemblance to humanity; but after all, in an affair
of this sort, that is no great matter; the author's invention
is the important point, and that is here as fertile and jovial
as ever, notably in his description of the new model casino,
which you must read and enjoy for yourself. -

It is feasible, of course, to make a thoroughly absorbing
novel out of the plain marrative of an uneventful life (what
would Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT say if I were to deny it?), but
it needs extraordinary cunning, a method of intricate detail,
and perhaps a more than usually attractive hero or heroine.
In The Family Living (MURRAY) Mr. E. H. LAcos WATson
has very doggedly set about the task of describing within
the ordinary limits of a book of romance a second-rate
character who does nothing in particular, and cannot even
perhaps be said, like the Elizabethan House of Lords, to do
it very well. Algernon Ridley, suffering from birth (in the
abbreviated form of his Christian name) under one of the
cruellest handicaps that can befall a young man, is brought
up in the expectation of succeeding to his father's cure of
souls at Gosport, and to that cure, after various ineffectual
revolts, he does eventually succeed. The author has
sketched his boyhood, his mediocre career at Cambridge,
his love-affairs, ending in his re-engagement to the girl for
whom he never apparently felt more than a mild affection,
and his excursions into pedagogy and business. I am sorry

Nora, who seems to have felt the inferiority of her husbands,
as she soon afterwards left them both and went on to the

I suppose she knew best. Anyway, I agree that her
natural gifts were wasted in private life.
I am quite unable to decide whether Daphne in the
work of an ingenuous anonymous and rather attractive
English girl who recently spent some time in Germany, or
only a carefully disguised imitation. There are plenty of

however, the prize un-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BONES OF CONTENTION.
NO. IV.
I was really pleased when my wife
decided to write a novel, not because
I had any reason to entertain a very
deep regard for her literary abilities,
but because it has always seemed to
me that the practice of novel-writing
should be reserved for the fair sex as
a safe and suitable outlet for the flights
of imagination to which they are un-
deniably prone.
I listened to the first two chapters
wearing an expression, practised before
the glass, of melancholy but affable
sobriety which I calculated would be
most acceptable to my wife; but as
she proceeded I began, to my great
astonishment, to experience a sense of
indefinable disquiet. It was not till
we were in the middle of chapter iii.
that enlightenment pierced through my
uneasy placidity and I understood. As
she read, in fact, a sudden picture
flashed across my mind of a little boy
in a sailor suit wrenching his hand
from his nurse and dashing across the
road to disport himself in the delicious
feathery spray of a passing water-cart.
To understand the true relevancy of
this it must first be explained that the
little boy was myself, and, secondly,
that this escapade was only one of
many which my nurse utilised as the
basis of 'romances: lurid and alarming
in character.” Thus almost every night
my nurse would tell me of the doings
of another little boy, of the awful
judgments. that befell him and of the
indescribably evil workings of his mind.
True, this i. boy bore a different
name from mine, he even wore kilts
instead of sailor suits; but I knew—
- - - - -
and, knowing, my tongue was tied. To
defend the actions or even the motives
of the kilted fellow was to let the cap
fit—to admit part-ownership of his de-
praved little mind. Never shall I forget
the sense of impotent misery with
which these romances inspired me, and
now gradually, in chapter iii., it was
being borne in upon me that those same
youthful sensations were reproducing
themselves in my manly breast.
My wife's novel, entitled, “Just a
Wife,” pivoted, as might be expected,
round a lady of that vocation, and
expanded upon the sufferings and trials
that she experienced at the hands of
a soulless husband. The husband was,
so the novelist was at pains to assure
the incredulous reader,
honest, kindly fellow, but lacking in all
the subtle and essential qualities which
would have enabled him to appreciate
the delicate machinery of (I quote) his
wife's finely-poised, sensitive mentality.
at heart an
that he had black curls and wore a red
tie; but, oh, in other respects, with
what savagery did the fellow pursue
his distorted mimicry of me! My wife
laid down chapter iii. with a sigh and
gave me a searching glance. - *
“Well, dear?” she said.
I cleared my throat.
“The psychology is remarkable,” I
suggested. . -
“Of the wife or the husband, do you
mean?" inquired my wife sweetly.
“The husband hasn't got any," I
said.
“Oh, yes, he has.” She gave a
peculiar little smile. “He’s very
human really, you know."
“Then perhaps you've exaggerated
him a little,” I ventured.
“I don't think so,” said my wife
sadly; “I'm afraid not. He was quite
a good fellow, you know, but he just
didn't understand.” - -
“Well, it was rather a tough job for
him to understand that, woman," I
observed aggressively. -
“He certainly found it so,” agree!
my wife; “that was just the trouble.”
“For instance,” I proceeded, “if she
had explained to Hector that she had
invited her mother and sister to stay
purely with the object of giving him
pleasure I don't believe that terrible
scene would ever have occurred.”
“When one does a thoughtful and
unselfish action,” returned my wife
reproachfully, “one doesn't want to go
and spoil it by explaining how thought-
ful and unselfish it was.”
That was rather a poser. “Well
then,” I pursued, “when she tidied
up his papers she never let him know
that she had stayed at home to do
it, instead of keeping a most delightful
engagement, solely because she thought
he would be too tired to do it himself
when he came home. Hector was
ratty about that because he simply
thought that she had been suffering
from a tidying-up mood and had been
officious.” -
My wife eyed me suspiciously.
“You plead his cause very well,”
she said coldly. -
I pulled myself together. Very
narrowly had I missed fitting on the
| cap!
“Of course I've no patience with
the fellow,” I protested. “Great cum-
bersome unimaginative lout ! but still
I think you have a little bit neglected
to give his point of view."
“I have tried to give the impression
that he was just a creature of instinct,”
explained my wife.
“So of course he hadn't got a point
of view 2" said I.
“Not exactly one that would lend
; Suddenly my wife rose to her feet.
“I’ve just had an idea for the out-
line of chapter iv.,” she said. “I
think I'll go and note it down.”
Left to myself, I drew up a chair to
the fire and lighted a cigarette. For
several moments I had been conscious
that right at the back of my mind lay
something—a vague recollection, an
experience, a pigeon-holed discovery,
I knew not what, that it was essential
I should straightway lay my hands
upon. Slowly, beautifully, the smoke
curled up and hung in a little haze
before my eyes. Somehow I must find
that elusive thing.
Ah! What was that little boy in
a sailor suit saying to his nurse 2 “If
you tell me a story, Nannie, I'm going
to tell you one, too.” And the story 2
It told of a nurse who spoke crossly to
little boys for no reason, who did up
buttons that were too tight for them,
who put soap in their eyes out of pure
cussedness, who scratched them with
needles that she wore in her apron.
These and a thousand other instances
of inhumanity went to furnish the
stories which that little boy had
eventually hit upon as the only pos-
sible device for self-defence and retalia-
tion. I had found what I wanted.
I crossed to “my writing-table and
drew a sheet of foolscap before me.

In his opening speech Mr. --→ - - - - -- His Lordship. For the pur-

provisions of the Act. It was
laid down in Clause xxv., which
was the operative clause, that
every British subject of full age
shall either (1) play in a cricket-
match at least once a week, or
(2), as an alternative, spend at
least three hours of every week-
day in conversing rationally
about the game of cricket. The
word “rationally ” might per-
haps in some cases be apt to
raise a difficulty, which would
have to be solved by the evi-
dence of experts. In this case,
however, that point did not
arise, as he should be able to
prove that the prisoner had
never conversed about cricket
at all; nor had he ever played
in any match, though he had
plenty of opportunities for so
| poses of the Act the length is
immaterial. The delivery is the
only thing that matters.
Several other witnesses gave
evidence that the prisoner con-
fined his conversation to scul-
ling and had never been heard
to say a word about cricket.
Mr. BourNE, for the defence,
said the prisoner's circumstances
must be taken into account. He
was a professional sculler, and
had lived during the greater
part of his life in close prox-
imity to a navigable river not
primarily adapted to the pur-
poses of cricket. Yet he had
on more than one occasion dis-

THE BEST TEST.
ONE of the papers has been printing
an analysis of the visits of distinguished
persons to that play in which a crafty
little Scotch body pulls strings. Ac-
cording to this, the PRIME MINISTER
has been five times, the FIRST Lord
of THE ADMIRALTY six times, Lord
CURzoN five times, the CHANCELLOR
of THE Exchequer four times, Mr.
BALFour four times and Mr. REDMond
(who is himself not wholly ignorant of
the art of string-pulling) twice. One
lady unnamed goes to the play once
a week, and a suburban clergyman has
been six- and - twenty times. These
figures speak well; but there are more
eloquent signs of popularity still. Let
me tell you.
A few weeks ago I was visiting a
house where pet animals are numer-
ous and choice. In the course of
breakfast I was suddenly aware of a
soft and comfortable weight on my
shoulders; and behold, a grey Persian
cat had leaped from the ground to
that position, and was already tickling
my cheek with her whiskers. I am
the last person on earth to resent such
a compliment; but my hostess had
fears that I might not be, for she was
full of apologies for Bunty's audacity
and begged me to put her down.
A few days later, having tea in a
Kensington house, I was most prettily
and coaxingly approached by another
cat, who wanted attention, and again
my hostess implored Bunty not to
be such a nuisance. And then this
morning it was my privilege to be in
practically at the birth of a litter of
kittens in the country, one of which was
at once appropriated by the youngest
daughter of the house and, regard-
less of sex, christened Bunty out of
hand.
And when you come to think of it,
you whose privilege it has been to
watch a kitten with a ball of wool or a
cotton reel, there could not be a better
name. What I am now wondering
is, how many Bunty cats England
boasts at this moment 2

FASHIONS FOR FIGHTERS.
“THE Home Rule Fight: Why Kid
Gloves?” asked the poster of The
Pall Mall Gazette last Friday. Not
a moment too soon has the question
of the correct fashions for the great
struggle been raised, and we hope our
contemporary will not be content with
the investigation of this single detail.
If the flower of our young men are
to be persuaded to join those who will
set sail from Liverpool sooner or later,
it is of the utmost importance that
they should be well informed on this
vital matter of fashions. If puttees
are the correct thing, no man wants to
wear pale-blue socks. The bravest of
us has his feelings; we do not wish to
appear ridiculous.
There are problems of the kind
already agitating the minds of intend-
ing combatants, to our personal
knowledge. Are black boots ever worn
purpose if there is no horse? Does a
horse serve any purpose if there are no
spurs? Would it be in order for the
bearer of a rifle to carry a sword also 2
How about spats 2 -
We do hope The Pall Mall will
gather all the information it can for us.
It is surely due to such as are about to
fling themselves into a sanguinary con-
flict that they should be well advised
beforehand of all the essentials of
correct appearance.

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HERALD OF SUMMER.
Miss MIDDLETON has a garden of
which she is very proud. Miss Middle-
ton's father says it belongs to him, and
this idea is fostered to the extent that
he is allowed to pay for the seeds and
cuttings and things. He is also en-
couraged to order the men about. But
I always think of it as Miss Middleton's
garden, particularly when the aſternoons
are hot and I see nothing but grimy
bricks out of my window. She knows
all the flowers by name, which seems
to me rather remarkable. -
“I have come,” I announced, feeling
that some excuse was necessary, “to
see the lobretias; don't say that they
are out. I mean, of course, do say that
they are out.”
“But I don't think we have any,”
she said in surprise. “I’ve never
heard of them. What are they like ’’’
“They're just the ordinary sort of
flower that people point to and say,
‘That's a nice lobretia.’ Dash it,
you've got a garden, you ought to
know.”
“I am afraid,” smiled Miss Middle-
ton, “that there isn't such a flower—
not yet. Perhaps somebody will invent
it now they've got the name.”
“Then I suppose I must go back to
London,” I said, getting up. “Bother.”
“Stay and inspect the meter,”
pleaded Miss Middleton. “Or ask
Father for a subscription for the band.
Surely you can think of some excuse
for being here.”
“I will stay,” I said, sitting down
again, “and talk to you. Between our-
selves, it is one of the reasons why I
came. I thought you might like to
hear all the latest news. Er—we've
started strawberries in London.”
Miss Middleton sighed and shook
her head.
“IBut not here,” she said.
“I was afraid not, but I thought I'd
remind you in case. Well, after all,
what are strawberries 2 Let's talk
about something else. Do you know
that this is going to be the greatest
season of history 2 I've got a free pass
to the Earl's Court Exhibition, so I
shall be right in the thick of it.”
“Oh, I thought last season was the
great one.”
“It was spoilt by the Coronation,
the papers say. You remember how
busy we were at the Abbey; we hadn't
time for anything else.”
“What else do the papers say ? I
seem to have missed them lately. I've
had a thousand things to do.”
“Well, the Sardine Defence League
has just been formed. I think of put-
ting up for it. I suppose you have to
every day. Let's both join, and then we
shall probably get a lot of invitations."
“Do they have a tent at the Eton and
Harrow match 2" asked Miss Middle-
ton anxiously.
“I will inquire. I wonder if there
is a vice-presidency vacant. I should
think a vice-president of the Sardine
Defence League could go anywhere.”
“V.P.S.D.L.,” said Miss Middleton
thoughtfully. “It would look splendid.
I must remember to send you a postcard
to-morrow.”
Tea came, and I put my deck-chair
one rung up to meet it. It is difficult
in a horizontal position to drink with-
out spilling anything, and it looks so
bad to go about covered with tea.
“This is very jolly,” I said. “Do
you know that my view during work-
ing hours consists of two broken win-
dows and fifty square feet of brick 2
It's not enough. It's not what I call
a vista. On fine days I have to go
outside to see whether the sun is
shining.”
“You oughtn't to want to look out
of the window when you're working.
You'll never be a Mayor.”
“Well, it all makes me appreciate
the country properly. I wish I knew
more about gardens. Tell me all
about yours. When are the raspberries
ripe?”
“Not till June.”
“I was afraid you'd say that. May
I come down and see your garden in
June–one day when I'm not at Earl's
Court 2 You can give all the gardeners
a holiday that day. I hate to be
watched when I'm looking at flowers
and things.” -
“Are you as fond of raspberries as
all that? Why didn't I know?”
“I’m not a bit mad about them,
really, but they're a symbol of Summer.
On a sloshy day in November, as I
grope my way through the fog, I say
to myself, ‘Courage, the raspberries
will soon be ripe.’”
“But that means that summer is
half over. The cuckoo is what I'm
listening for all through November. I
heard it in April this year.”
I looked round to see that nobody
was within earshot.
“I haven't heard it yet,” I confessed.
“It wasn't really so much to see the
lobretias as to hear the cuckoo that I
came to have tea with you. I feel just
the same about it; it's the beginning
of everything. And I said to myself,
“Miss Middleton may not have a first-
rate show of lobretias, because possibly
it is an unfavourable soil for them, or
they may not fit in with the colour
scheme; but she does know what is
essential to a proper garden, and she'll
“Yes, we do ourselves very well,”
said Miss Middleton confidently.
“Well, I didn't like to say anything
about it before, because I thought it
might make you nervous, and so I've
been talking of other things. But now
that the secret is out I may say that
I am quite ready.” I stopped and
listened intently with my head on one
side. -
There was an appalling silence.
“I don't seem to hear it,” I said at
last.
“But I haven't heard it here yet,”
Miss Middleton protested. “It was in
Hampshire. The cuckoos here are
always a bit late. You see, our garden
takes a little finding. It isn't so well
known in-in Africa, or wherever they
came from-as Hampshire.”
“Yes, but when I've come down
specially to hear it——”
“Cuck-oo,” said Miss Middleton
suddenly, and looked very innocent.
“There, that was the nightingale,
but it's the cuckoo I really want to
hear.” -
“I am sorry about it. If you like
I'll listen to you while you tell me who
you think ought to play for England.
I can't make it more summery for you
than that. Unless roses are any good 2"
“No, don't bother,” I said in some
disappointment; “you've done your
best. We can't all have cuckoos any
more than we can all have lobretias.
I must come again in August, when
one of the pioneers may have struggled
here. Of course in Hampshire——”
“Cuck-oo,” said somebody from the
apple-tree.
“There !” cried Miss Middleton.
“That's much better,” I said. “Now
make it come from the laburnum, Lieu-
tenant.”
“I’m not doing it, really' " she said.
“At least only the first time.”
“Cuck-oo,” said somebody from the
apple-tree again.
There was no doubt about it. I let
my deck-chair down a rung and pre-
pared to welcome the summer.
“Now,” I said, “we’re off.”

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday 6th May.
—For first time since PREMIER in
businesslike speech brought in Home
Rule Bill, debate has attained fiery
heat. It was CAMPBELL who worked
the spell–JAMES HENRY, colleague of
GENERAL CARSON, K.C., in representa-
tion of Dublin University. Name

they supply the strongest argument in as good as any other. Indeed better,

long-established, still existing system of answer in more convenient and reliable
governing Ireland is a failure.”
Another point that stirred moment-
arily crowded House to cheers and
counter - cheers was ATToRNEY - GEN-
ERAL's treatment of what he scornfully
described as conditional loyalty.
“Ulster,” RUFUs said, “assumes
monopoly of loyalty. Ulster Members
proclaim that they will remain loyal as
long as one-fifth of the representatives
of Ireland are allowed to coerce the
majority of Irishmen.”

drivers, but it is sufficiently attractive
to have already found its imitators in
our own country. An early derivative
is the “League of Courtesy,” just estab-
lished at Westminster, to which so
many members of the Liberal Party
belong, and which has Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE for its energetic president.
The League has decided to put upon
the market a Flor de Cuba of unusual
strength, length and seductiveness, to
be known as a Colombino. The band
will bear the words, “The Reward of
Mealiness,” and whenever an Opposi-
tion speaker interjects a conspicuously
gentle comment or delivers a speech
notable for its sweet reasonableness, a
Liberal Member will cross the floor of
the House and present him with one

Not to be outdone in altruistic zeal,
a section of young Conservatives, under
the banner of Mr. F. E. SMITH, have
formed themselves into a “League of
Pity" for the purpose of expressing
sympathy with the more pathetic and
broken-down Members of the Govern-
ment. Whenever any of these played-
out cynics makes a more than usually
fatuous defence of a corrupt policy or
a more than usually rash forecast of
poisonous legislation Mr. HAROLD
SMITH will cross the floor and offer
him a dainty charm in the form of
a tiny gold boot, artistically chased.
For the reception of these tokens of
good will Mr. Asquith, Mr. LLOYD

acquiring new watch-chains several
yards long.
Mr. St. Loß STRAch EY, the I
President of the “League for Pro-
moting Charity to Cats," has made
a luminous suggestion for the popu-
larising of the tenets of that body.
He proposes to raise a fund of £5,000
for the purpose of purchasing orna-
mental milk-jugs, each bearing the
legend, “Pity Poor Pussy,” to be
distributed to all persons who can
adduce documentary evidence of
their having done an act of kindness
to any member of the feline species.
Any person who possesses ten of
these milk-jugs will be entitled to

PUNCH, OR THE
- RAIN
(An article which our exhausted con-
temporaries are at liberty to use at
the end of the next great drought.)
RAIN at last ! Real wet rain, falling
in profusion on the thirsty earth ! At
9.15 yesterday morning the first drop
fell in Fleet Street and was immediately
surrounded by a cheering crowd, who
gazed at the wet spot on the pavement
—fascinated City men raised their
hats and a loud cheer. But there was
imore to follow. Other drops began to
fall, and soon the air was full of them.
Pit-pat they fell, and presently, the
gutters were running full bore with a
chuckle to the gratings, down which
the precious fluid fell with a merry
Splash, as if conscious that it was on
its way to Ocean And so it was.
: In Hyde Park the flowers began to
prick up their ears, scarcely daring as
yet to believe that the improbable had
happened. Worms came to the surface
and hastened back again to spread the
glad tidings annong their friends. Bash-
ful slugs and snails came out in their
thousands. I heard a gardener singing
near Kensington Palace, and assumed
that he was drunk. So he was. Drunk
with rain. Blind to the world. Blind
to everything except that, the blessed
rain had come at last. Blackbird and
thrush expressed the joy we all felt in
our hearts, only much better. Every-
one was sniffing the savour of the sweet
wet earth as if it were the perfume of
some rare box breathing all Arabia;
and those who were not near wet earth
at the time read about it in their Lunch
editions, which was almost as good.
Once again the wisdom of SHAKSPEARE
is proved where he said, “The property
of rain is to wet" (As You Like It,
III., 2).

It is a curious coincidence that the
longest droughts have always occurred
under a Liberal Government.
“An April without a shower is like
an egg without salt,” said the Rev.
BERNARD LITTLEwood in an address to
the Roehampton Boy Scouts. -
A humorist on the Underground has,
by scratching out one letter, made the
inscription on the door of a carriage
read: “Wait until the rain stops.”
His MAJESTY THE KING witnessed
the rain from a window in Buckingham
Palace. The arrangements were carried
out by the Office of Works. . -
When the first drop fell an umbrella
merchant in Cornhill suddenly re-
covered his reason.
A pair of sparrows which had built
their nest in a rain-water head at
Kilburn are on the look-out for an
“Ideal Home.”

MR. PUNCH AND THE GUARDS'
CLUB.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,--In The Pall Mall
Gazette of April 15th there appeared,
under the heading “London Dialogues,”
what purported to be a conversation
on Home Rule between two members
of the “New 'Varsity Club,” conducted
in a manner which can only be de-
scribed as one of extreme resilience.
In frank parody of the misrepre-
sentative methods of the writer in the
P.M.G. a dialogue on Welsh Dis-
establishment between two members of
the Guards' Club appeared in your
issue of April 24th, under the heading
“‘Pall Mall’ Palavers,” the title, it is
hardly necessary to add, having a
journalistic and not a geographical
application. The parodist never in-
tended for one moment to make his
dialogue representative of the manners
==
or intelligence of real Guardsmen. His
sole aim was to show how the pseudo-
realism of the P.M.G. writer, who,
while assuming the standpoint of a
man of the world, did not hesitate to
ascribe to University men the manners'
of bar-loafers, would work out if applied
to the officers of a crack corps. As,
however, the tone of the parody has
been resented by some members of the
Brigade of Guards who have misunder-
stood its motive and are possibly
unacquainted with the original on
which it was based, the foregoing
explanation is offered by
The WRITER of THE ARTICLE.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE NIEW SIN.”
I HAVE to thank Mr. B. MACDONALO
HASTINGs for a very entertaining even-
ing. Once we had done with the pro-
ſessed humour of the introduction there
was scarcely a dull moment in it. But
surely the title was a mistake. Ever
since the days of KING SoLoxtoN (who
lived a long while ago) it has been con-
sidered rash to ascribe novelty to any-
thing under the sun. And certainly
the sin of continuing to live when your
death would be a great convenience to
other people is not a new idea. Mr.
BARRIE in one of the delightful works
of his earlier days—Better Dead—intro-
duced us to a club which existed for
the sole purpose of correctifig this sin
by doing away with those whose
existence liad ceased to be desirable.
The real novelty of the present vari-
ation lies in the fantastic improbability
of its hypothesis. There are circum-
stances, fortunately rare yet readily
conceivable, in which a man might
regard it as a point of honour that he
should get out of other people's way by
taking his own life. Mr. HASTINGs has
discarded these in favour of the follow-
ing preposterous condition. The late
Mr. Cutts (one of the most unkindest I
have ever heard of) was a rich draper
who wanted to inflict posthumous pun-
ishment on his eldest son, Hilary, a
ne'er-do-weel, and so gave instructions
to his executors to let his property
accumulate during the lifetime of the
eldest son, or for twenty-one years,
whicheyer period should prove to be
the longer, and then be divided among
his other ten children. (The twenty-
one years' clause apparently revealed a
gratuitous desire on the part of . Cutts
père to punish the rest of his children
for no reason shown.) The father dies,
and the ne'er-do-weel develops into
the one decent representative of the
family.
living as an artist, while every single
one of the ten others is reduced to
penury, and has to beg of Hilary for
his daily beer.
Now I observe that Mr. HASTINGs is

preferred it if Hilary had taken the
advice of his friend, a Labour M.P.,
who thought that, if the hero was
determined to die, he might just as
well sell his life dearly and be hanged
for a holocaust of people whose blood
appeared to him, the Labour Member,
to want spilling. . Instead, he chose
suicide, but was diverted from this
purpose by the chance of assuming a
younger brother's guilt in the right
Sydney Carton manner. -
. I do not so much complain that the
subject of death should be treated
lightly. We Occidentals attach far
too much importance to it, and forget,
what the Japanese, for instance, never
forget, that life is the thing that really
matters. But I do complain that we

critics who saw it at the Royalty to
take all this as a profound treatment
of an elemental theme, when the author
himself must have recognised it as just
a smart piece of melodrama in the
“Grand Guignol" vein. There was no
analysis of the dark problem of suicide,
no probing of the question whether a
man's life is his own to throw away.
And the only character who showed
any really poignant emotion in the
conscious of the foibles of his brother matter of Hilary's dying was the
playwrights, and at one time attempts younger brother; and he was concerned
to disarm criticism by making Hilary' purely with its relation to his own

dence with the words: “Life bristles' death, regarded from a detached, or

opening of the Third. Also, at which
of the “famous public schools " or

I shall not press for an explanation
of the brilliant conversational gifts
of the man-servant, for this class has
long been accepted as the exponents of
all that is best in our stage humour.
The performance, which kept the
right note of restraint, was very good
throughout, and if the play suffered at
all from change of atmosphere I, at
any rate, who now saw it for the first
time, was incapable of imagining how
it could have been done much better.
My only trouble was that, at its reincar-
nation on the boards of the Criterion
(of all houses) it brought with it the
flattering cachet of approved matinées
at the Royalty and the solemn bene-
diction of the critics, and so started on
its new career with a definite prejudice
in its favour, having been advertised
not as merely a clever melodrama,
which it undoubtedly was, but as
a “strong" play, which I think it
was not. However, Mr. MACDoNALD
HASTINGs is far too intelligent to allow
himself to be persuaded into the belief
that The New Sin is a “contribution
to the serious drama."
This, by the way, is the second of
his plays that I have seen in two con-

ask what in the meantime is that

HOW TO LIVE ON SIXPENCE
A DAY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-For the benefit
of those of your readers who contem-
plate making the experiment of sus-
taining life for a whole week on sixpence
a day, I beg you to allow me space to
recount my experiences.
No doubt a number of unscrupulous
persons will come forward and claim a
hearing on the strength of having done
it on sixpence and an odd farthing or
so. Against these upstarts I need not
urge you to use your editorial pywers
without mercy. The extra bun or
stick of barley sugar in the day makes
all the difference.
That it could be done I knew, because
somebody had done it and written all
about it to the press, enclosing his
balance-sheet for the week. Dut, having
lost the newspaper-cutting referring to
it long before the eventful Monday, I
was thrown entirely on my own re-
sources. Yet in my very loss lay my
greater chance. What one Briton had
already done, was another Briton to
be thwarted from doing? Never! Else
where was our boast of empire, what
had our pioneers suffered and died for 2
I chose Monday as the day to start the
experiment for two reasons. The first
was that it comes after Sunday, a day,
in our family, almost exclusively given
to eating, and consequently forming a
good basis for privations of this nature;
the second was that Monday is uni-
versally the recognized day for putting
all new resolutions into practice.
Well, on Monday I bought a packet
of cigarett-s and some acid drops.
That, I admit, was a mistake, and
when I woke on Tuesday morning I
saw directly where I had gone wrong.
Of course, what the system required
was something at once fattening and
sustaining, satisfying yet withal cheap;
and for all the nutriment the human
frame could be expected to get out of
acid drops and cigarettes, in them-
selves antidotes, I might just as well
have wasted my time eating flies. No,
I must think of something better.
There then occurred to me the dear old
friend of our childhood, cod liver oil.
With sixpennyworth of it per diem,
judiciously taken, surely I could count
on keeping body and soul together till
the ensuing Sunday—a teaspoonful for
breakfast, a dessertspoonful for lunch,
another teaspoonful for tea, and a table-
spoonful for dinner, and probably some
left over for the cat. Moreover, having
recently become a bull in oils, I knew
I was practically certain to see my
money back. But no sooner had I

lection of my childhood I had forgotten

was spent and starvation stared me in
the face. For certainly no one but a
Laplander could be expected to eat that
nauseous stuff neat. It merely re-
mained to write a letter of explanation
to the coroner and wait patiently for
the end, my only hope leng that my
natural reserves of fat, with Sunday's
reinforcements, would respond nobly
to this sudden call upon them. How-
ever, to my surprise, finding myself
still alive on Wednesday I determined
to take no further risks, and demolished
two loaves out of hand, and on Thurs-
day I had several square meals.
I am told now that the staple
ingredients of human food consist of
nitrates (exclusive of the gold, silver
phosphates and fat. Had I known
this at the time, what were easier than
to go to the chemist, buy a penny-
halfpennyworth of each, shake them
all up together, and take a dose of the
mixture four times a day ? If they are
anything like as cheap as bacteria, you
ought to get quite a lot for sixpence.
Should any of your readers care to
make the experiment, the only stipu-
lation is that they must not spend
more than sixpence. But, if the pantry
door should happen to be open and the
cook of a conniving spirit, it says
nothing at all about that. I enclose

WALKER told me to meet him in
the Furniture department of Parridge's
Stores at twelve-thirty, and he would
give me luncheon. If I had arrived
there within a quarter-of-an-hour of the
time all might have been well; but as
it was I got there at one o'clock, and
all was not well. It is not much good
looking for anybody in Parridge's.
I approached the furniture man and
questioned him. “Have you seen a
small, squat person, with rather loud
trousers” (I was annoyed with Walker
for his excess of punctuality; if no-
body bothered about being punctual
there would not be all this fuss about
it) “who looked as if he had lost
someone 2" --
My friend, said the man, had gone.
That seemed to me a contradiction in
terms. If he had gone he was not my
friend. I gathered that he had indeed
been on the look-out but had retired
eventually, looking, if anything, a little
relieved. “That's my man,” said I,
and followed him to the book depart-
ment, whither, the furniture man said,
Walker had enquired the way. The
book man, discovering at once that I
was not going to buy books, was less
helpful. He overdid it. Yes, he had
seen a short gentleman in distinctive
trousers that morning—in fact, about a
hundred-and-twenty of them. Some of
them had . . . I did not stay to hear
the rest, but thought it would be a
sound idea to go to the restaurant and
wait for him there.
The restaurant is at the top of the
building. It is approached by lifts. I
took up a position opposite the lift-
gates and hoped for the best. I felt
encouraged to notice that there were
four liſts; the more lifts, I felt, the
more chances of Walker's ultimate
arrival. But, though those lifts worked
hard for half-an-hour, they produced
nothing nearer to Walker than another
acquaintance of mine, named Pearson.
I looked at him with annoyance
because he was not Walker, and he
returned the glare because I was not
someone else. “You haven't picked
up a tall fellow with an umbrella, have
you?” he asked me, “because, if you
have, he is mine. I have lost one.”
“No,” I answered, “but will ex-
change for a short one with lightish
trousers.”
“What a pity,” he said, “that we
are not looking for each other!” I did
not like the way he said that ; it
sounded almost as if it might have
been meant for a hint to which I could
not accede, having left all my real
money at home.
sex and were disgorging nothing but
Women.
“I’m awfully hungry,” said I, with
intent.
“So am I,” he answered.
“I shall have to lunch some time,
and so will you. Luncheon is one of
those things which must be. What
are we going to do about it 2 "
“It almost looks as if we shall
have to lunch together,” he said in-
advertently.
“Thanks awfully,” I said, before he
had time to cover his mistake.
He tried to smile graciously, as if he
had meant to do something kind. He
half got up from the chair, on which
he sat waiting. Then, “I think per-
haps I ought to wait a little longer for
my man,” he said.
His idea of a “little '' was a shade
too long for me. “What about it 2 "
I said at last.
“Oh, it's very good of you,” he said,
getting up with alacrity. .
When we were seated at the food, I
felt feverishly in my pocket, but no
money had grown there since the last
feverish search. “I must be candid,"
I said later on. “It was not so much
my man I was wanting as his free
luncheon.”
“Same here,” said he, with discon-
certing brevity.
“I have ninepence,” said I, produc-
ing it.
“And I a latch-key, a threepenny-
bit and two stamps.” He also laid his
cards on the table. “And one of the
stamps is a halfpenny one.”
“Were you late, too?” I asked.
“A mere nothing—not more than
twenty minutes or so. It was hurrying
to get here even twenty minutes late
that made me leave my money behind.”
“The popular craze for punctuality
has a lot to answer for,” we agreed.
Meanwhile we had eaten together two-
and-ninepence worth of food.
I suddenly looked bright, optimistic,
confident and very knowing. “I have
it,” I whispered, getting up and wink-
ing at him. “You just wait here and
keep up appearances.” I made my
way to the smoking-room, which is
an annexe of the restaurant.
When I said “I had it,” I lied. I
am now sitting in the smoking-room,
writing a faithful account of it all. I
hope Pearson's ingenuity or audacity
will have settled the matter. There is
no limit to the free luxuries provided
by these modern Stores. I had had
the faint hope that the last and most
up-to-date and considerate convenience
for customers might be an emergency
to pay for their meals. But I cannot
see it, and here I am, rapidly coming
to the end of the story and with no
alternative but to make my way out
again through the restaurant.
If that fellow in the frock-coat, who
stands by the door and appears to be
taking no notice of anything, hinders
my passage out and says, “Pardon, Sir,
have you paid for the luncheons? Your
friend " (I was so busy remembering a
moment ago how clever I was that
I forgot Pearson might be cunning)–
“your friend said you would see to it,”
I shall answer briefly, “I have no
friends,” and shall endeavour to pass on.

Though the morn be drear and soaking,
She smiles on me and you,
When the 9.15 from Woking
Arrives at Waterloo;
She stands in a glade of flower and

(That is ours for five and three)
And tells of love and a cheap return
To Baydon-by-the-Sea.
All white from shoon to bodice,
She hangs, divinely tall,
A Rivieran goddess
Suspended from the wall;
Mid the station smells you can almost
sniff
The tang of a Baydon breeze,
As you gaze on the gulls and a
crumbling cliff
And the bluest thing in seas.
And every night I toast her
As I quaff the brimming bowl,
This girl who thrills my poster-

This holiday lass who softly smiles
On passengers and guards,
And wafts them in fantasy miles and

From sooty station yards.

Is never the same as you dared to hope
From the picture on the wall.
And that is why, dear maiden,
I've passed a firm decree
That I'll never go to Baydon,
To Baydon-by-the-Sea;
I've lost my trust in a hundred pills,
In a pen and a score of shoes,

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Moon Endureth (BLAckwood) is a collection of tales
and fancies, in prose and verse, which Mr. John BUCHAN
has contributed to Blackwood's Magazine. It reminds me
of an old well-thumbed saffron-coloured book, called, I
think, Tales from Blackwood, which was one of the soberer
delights of my schoolboy days a many moons ago. It isn't
only that in several of the stories Mr. Buchan makes me
feel the thrill and ecstasy that come of the cool, clean
breath of mountain and moor and loch, and the boundless
space of sunlit skies and the sound of running waters.
That he can always do when he sets his mind to it. But he
has somehow caught the indefinable spirit of the old “Maga"
magic, which makes a typical Blackwood story as different
from ordinary magazine fiction as the spacious repose of
Tudor houses from the irritating pretence of modern jerry-
built villas. His title, which is not very happily chosen,
refers really not to the promise of the Psalmist, but to the
belief of St. FRANCIs that the moon stands for the dominion
of all strange things in water and air. In that region of
mystery and horror Mr. BUCHAN is always at home. But
I like, too, his other fancies, more particularly those of the
Americans who came to Europe to invite PRINCE CHARLIE
to be their king, and found him drunk, and of the
Lemnian who fought side by side with the Lacedæmonians
at Thermopylae. They might both so easily have been true.
Inviolable Sanctuary (NELsoN), is his best yet. I call it his
latest, but not, I hope, by any means his last. I would
like indeed that Mister BIRMINGHAM should be writing tales
this great while, the way I will be reading a fresh one every
onct in a while; and me with perhaps the black care on
me for him to charm it away. But as for telling you the
full story of The Inviolable Sanctuary, that thing I will not
do. It is himself and no other shall explain to you just
what was on the island of Inishbawn, and what took
Priscilla and Frank voyaging about the bay in the Tortoise.
In short (to drop an idiom that is becoming bothersome)
you must read the book and chuckle, as you are practically
bound to do, over the supposed German spies, and the
sponge-collecting lady and the varied enthusiasms of Miss
Lentaigne. It was this last that I enjoyed as much as
anything else. Whether she is a Christian Scientist, deny-
ing the existence of a sprain in Frank's ankle, or a fresh-air
faddist, or a devotee of female independence martyrising
herself in the endeavour to smoke cigarettes, Aunt Juliet is
always delightful. So is our last word of her, in a letter
from Priscilla, where she is described as having “dropped
being a suffragette in disgust, and taken up appendicitis
warmly.” But the whole book is the most rollicking fun;
the jolliest that Mr. BIRMINGHAM has written, which, as
you probably know, is saying a good deal. Let you read it
at once.
In the coloured comic supplement of one of the New
York Sunday papers there used to appear a series of

[May 15, 1912.
and uttering the words, “Bad mans!” I was irresistibly
reminded of this small boy when I read Mr. AUSTIN PHILIPs'
The Common Touch (SMITH, ELDER). His “Bad mans” is
the Modern, the Intellectual, the Shavian, or whatever he
likes to call himself; and he attacks him with a naïve lack
of humour and a total absence of artistry which suggest
extreme youth. Whenever two of his characters get
together, the stcry is hung up while they scold Bad mans.
Not that there is very much story to hang up. Monica
Priestly is a would-be Intellectual (Blackheath model), and
when she goes to serve in the post-office at the county
town of Rutherford she shocks the natives at first by
appearing in a djibbah. But is there not a heart of gold
beneath that djibbah 2 There is, indeed. Along comes the
local doctor, whom she had seen playing football at
Blackheath and worshipped from afar. He is Good mans.
Will she marry him and play golf like a nice-minded
English girl, or will she, so to speak, djib at the prospect?
She imarries him. And that's
possible. . . . Miss EMMA Brooke's study is always wall
informed and sometimes nearly inspired. She has only
failed at one point. In overdoing her hero's merits she has
made him a prig, and so misses the reader's sympathy. It
is not till too late that one learns what a good fellow he
really was all the time, and can manage to regret his
destruction. -
I despair of coming to any understanding with Mr. A. B.
LE SAGE about Doll Berryman, the heroine of In the West
Wind (Duckworth). She married “Captain" Harvey,
foreman of her father's tin mine and, when her husband
went to South Africa, carried on a liaison with Stephen
Pengelly, a lodger, whom she had at first disliked and
despised, and also apparently with one or two other
people. Stephen Pengelly was killed in an accident in the
Wheel Crom mine, Harvey returned home, and Dolly
apparently settled down to a quiet domestic existence with
him for the remainder of her
all. Mr. PHILIPs is so sincere
and so obviously believes that
he is saving the country that
it is not pleasant to have to
scoff. But, if there is one thing
which should be written well or
not at all, it is a philippic, and
The Common Touch is badly
constructed and childish. And
no Intellectual ever accused the
Plain, Ordinary Man of being
such a portentous bore as Mr.
PHILIPs unconsciously makes
him.
Among our great-grandfathers
there was many a one who started
life on halſ-a-crown a week and
died worth something like that
sum a minute. The ambition
and achievement of these
Northern giants was to build
great industrial concerns, and it
was only by the way that they
founded also notable families to
years. Since she was only the
daughter of a Cornish farmer
(the tin was a chance discovery
on his estate) it is natural, I
suppose, that she should not in-
dulge in a great deal of psycho-
logical introspection, as she
would have done if Mr. EDEN
PHILLPotts had been her creator,
but nevertheless the story of her
amours leaves me rather baffled.
There is a fine Cornish flavour
about this novel, like the saffron
in a local cake. I like saffron-
cake, but I am not sure that this
is a wholly successful example of .
the confectionery. Mr. LESAGE's
descriptions of scenery, his dia-
lect, and his interiors are all of
the best, but his heroine should
either have been more articulate |
or treated from a more aloof and
critical standpoint. The story
fails to provide any palpable
thrill, and I am left with a feeling

that life is not quite bracing
ingly on the net profits and to
be much sought after by others and much venerated
by themselves in local society. The affairs of this
provincial plutocracy do not figure largely in romance;
their attitude towards life is usually too cautious and them-
selves too businesslike to touch passionate extremes. But
they are liable to their problems like the rest of us, and one
of the gravest threatens when the line of descent appears
inevitably bound to come to a point in an only son, who is
of a mind not wholly commercial and prudent, is artistic even
and cogitative, intellectual, unmercenary, and advanced.
So The House of Robershaye (SMITH, ELDER) threatened
to conclude in Ambrose. To avert disaster, the father made
a will (quite a feasible will, for once in a novel) by which
Cousin Robert was forced upon Ambrose as a lifelong
companion and partner, Cousin Robert being, from a
business point of view, It. It was the father's misſortune,
if deceased testators can have misfortunes, that a feminine
contingency arose. It is hard enough in the ordinary
way for two men diametrically opposed to live at peace in
the same house and work harmoniously in the same cotton
|mill, but when in addition they become rivals for the love
haps the author will use baking-
powder as well as saffron next time.
When the heroine of The Visioning (MURRAY) began to
develop “views” it took me some fifty pages to recover
from the shock. At the outset Katie Jones was rather
hair-brainy, delightfully ingenuous and withal of a personal
charm that made men §: their credit) fall in love with her.
Not-for a moment did I guess that serious thinking was to
be numbered among her many accomplishments. How-
ever, let no one be alarmed, for in her most solemn moments
she was never tedious. I applaud Miss GLASPELL's story
as heartily as I dislike the extra syllable in her title.
Her theories are applied solely to America, but the pill (if it
be a pill) is so girt with sugar that it can be recommended
to everyone, except to those who insist upon taking
refuge from Socialism by ignoring it. With many of her
ideas I am totally at variance, but it is impossible to deny
the cogency and humour with which they are expressed.
The book indeed is a brilliant example of how to be
strenuously modern without being in the smallest degree
ferocious or offensive. Incidentally I am pleased to know

of the same woman trouble is certain and even murder is
that Americans call a niblick a sand-club. -

A NEW MISSION.
[“. Cricket is peculiarly a Christian game.
No pagan nation has ever played it."
Melbourne Pºpe,'..]
WHEN wild in woods the savage ran,
Being a prehistoric man,
There is no record hinting at
His rude delight in ball and bat:
And, when, in times a shade more dressy,
People's amusements weren't so messy,
No trundler known to ancient lore
Got pagan PHARAOH leg-before;
Moses, who must have had a notion
Of heathen games as played in Goshen,
Has neither praise nor yet rebuke
Of Cricket in the Pentateuch.
No Old Phoenician “found a patch "
In any Tyre-and-Sidon match;
There is no story from Tibet
Of lamas slogging at the net;
No sporting annals tell us how,
During the dynasty of Chow,
The full-sized volley sped through space
And took CoNFUCIU's in the face.
We hear not how ACHILLEs spent
: Whole weeks inside the scorer's tent;
Nor read of PRI.AM, stiff of joint,
Dropping a cert at silly-point:
Nor, on a nasty pitch that bumped,
Of Aristides being stumped;
Nor how, when Phoebus came out hot
At Salamis (a dampish spot),
The Attic skipper won the spin
And coolly put the Persians in.
No fable tells of Roman Cricket—
How well HoRATIUs kept the wicket,
How brother ReMUs took first knock,
Or FABIU's played against the clock;
Or JULIU's CESAR showed alarm
At BRUTUs “coming with his arm;"
Or CICERo in palmy days
Bowled with his head and broke both
ways;
Or BALBUs—he that built the wall,
Played like it, blocking every ball.
Nor did our isles adopt the game
Till Christian missionaries came,
And even then the pagan sort
Failed to regard it as a sport.
No Viking, landing from his ships,
Was ever captured in the slips;
No Irish heathen learned the hat-trick,
Though freely coached by good St.
PATRICK ; -
No Pict, in legends known to me,
After the interval for “tea,”
Lashing his sporran round his pad,
Appealed because the light was bad.
It was the same in our domains:
Not once on Bengal's tented plains
Did the great NAwab lift a googly
Halfway across the astonied Hoogily:
Nor yet was Cricket in his thought
When the high priest of Juggernaut,
Rain having fallen after drought,
Ordered the heavy roller out.
And, if at length this art of arts
Has wooed and won exotic hearts,
To Christian Cambridge is it due
Who of her RAN.ji made a Blue,
Taught him—what other creeds had
missed—
His speed of eye, his sleight of wrist,
Taught him—who learned it like a
lamb–
To cut and push and glance and slam
And live to be a perfect JAM. O. S.
MUSICAL NOTES.
No event of the season is likely to
excite greater interest than the series
of orchestral concerts which Herr
Johan N SEBASTIAN BEETHov EN is about
to give at the Royal Albert Hall. The
programme will consist exclusively of
compositions by the concert-giver and
his great-great-grand-uncle, the well-
known Bonn master, and those in-
terested in the problem of hereditary
talent cannot fail to be profoundly im-
pressed by the comparisons forced on
them by this method of juxtaposition.
Herr Johan N SEBASTIAN BEETHoves is
at all points a far better equipped
musician than his eccentric ancestor.
His hearing is perfect, he dresses in the
very best taste, he can ride a bicycle
and possesses a motor-car. Amon
the works from his pen which will be
heard for the first time in England
during his visit are an Agricultural
Symphony, a Limelight Sonata and an
Ueber-Kaiser Concerto.
Mr. Nathan Gherkin is giving a
recital on the xylophone at Blüthstein
Hall on Friday afternoon, at which he
will play selections from the works of
Szlumper, Strzgowski and de Pussy.
Mr. Gherkin, who will be assisted by
Herr Agus Aspar on the mirliton, is
a younger brother of the eleventh wife
of Professor Lessipoffsky, the famous
Viennese pianist, and it is only twenty-
three years since he was born at Kew,
Cumberland (Mo.).
An extraordinarily interesting pro-
gramme has been arranged by Messrs.
Fulsome Ould and Dursey Ranger for
their concert on Saturday at the
Great Banqueting Hall of the Hygienic
Restaurant. The various items—all of
them compositions or transcriptions by
the joint concert-givers—will be inter-
preted by what they call a “neolithic
orchestra,” from which all metal, string
or wood will be sedulously banished.
The instruments are named the petro-
phone, the pianoflint, the pickoloot and
the vegetable bassoon, and to lend
verisimilitude to the performance the
players will all be attired in troglodyte
dress with peacock's-feather head-
dresses and talc helmets.

Messrs. Boozy) we append the follow-

The Baltimore Sun has, we regret to
say, committed itself to the deplor-
able view that romance is irreconcilable
with total abstinence. It observes:—
“What would become of romance if there
were no alcohol? Imagine a teetotaler writing
“Much Ado About Nothing,” or the Fifth
Symphony, or ‘Le Malade Imaginaire,' or ‘Peer
Gynt,' or the Zend-Avesta, or the Declaration
of Independence or any other great work of
feeling and fancy Imagine Wagner, bursting
with ginger pop, at work upon ‘Tristan and
Isolde.’ Imagine Leonardo, soaked in health
drinks from Battle Creek, fashioning the un-
fathomable smile of Mona Lisa ' "

Richard STRAUss wrote his Salome
entirely on a diet of ketsup and am-
moniated quinine. Elektra, on the other
hand, was composed on a blend of ab-
sinthe, macassar oil and Condy's Fluid.
In Irigoletto, the other night, Signor
SAMMARCO, who was impersonating the
tragical buffoon, “picked up his dis-
tressful daughter Gilda on his shoulder
and strode off with her. Such a feat,”
the musical critic of The Daily Mail
remarks, “had not been possible for
years.” The Grand Opera prima donna,
until quite recently, weighed on an
average between fourteen and fifteen
stone. Indeed, it is alleged that on one
memorable occasion when a more than
usually portly Brünnhilde was hoisted
on to the back of her steed at the close
of Götterdämmerung, the back of the
unhappy quadruped broke with a loud
crack, horse and rider collapsing to-
gether on the stage.

paths of true humour.
In boyhood these aberrations were

the more discerning of his companions.
It was at the close of an informal little
supper. One of our party excused him-
self for running away to catch a train.
“I am sorry to leave the table,” he

I well remember once entering the Club
lounge as old Mr. Caysnor and Ferriby
were parting after a short chat.
“And so you've been down to see
your people. How did you find your

asking, and I saw Ferriby turn quite

think the dazed, hurt

had been almost a fairy

Ferriby now got

of humour beat in his
veins. Often he had

I recall how we shunned poor Ferriby,
or suffered his company only that we
might revile him, I am stricken with
remorse. True, when at last we saw that

“Don't—don't apologise for leaving
the table,” he said, a tinge of colour
mounting into his pale cheeks; “you
couldn't very well take it with you.”
“Oh, heavens !” we cried, mo-
mentarily mastered by our indigna-
tion; “do you call that funny?”
Ferriby dropped a haggard gaze
upon his plate.
“Why, no—no, of course not,” he
murmured brokenly; “but what can
I do? What can I do?”
I suppose something in the wording
of this reply, something too in Ferriby's
tone and look, must have penetrated to
our understandings. We exchanged
glances and forbore to press our
grievance.
I think also that after this—if, in-
deed, we had not instinctively done so
for years—we tried to avoid in Ferriby's
presence any remark lending itself to
the more devastating forms of repartee.
Taking the air in his bath-chair,
after a couple of days' enforced
rest, he had been stopped by an
acquaintance who enquired how long
he had been laid up in bed. “You
mean laid dou n in bed, don't you ?”
said Ferriby in a low voice. “Well,
how long were you in bed, anyway?”
corrected his friend, and Ferriby, his
features white and drawn, had mur-
mured ſaintly, “Just five feet nine and
a half,” and collapsed beneath the
apron of his bath-chair.
I was told all this by Dr. Keane as
he conducted me to Ferriby's room.
Several of his friends were there, and
among them Joe Wayle—breezy Joe—
but even he on this occasion kept
up his spirits with a very palpable
effort.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
And then, almost as he said the
words, he felt what he had done, and
I knew that he was inwardly cursing
himself for his thoughtlessness. A
spasm of pain twitched the corners of
Ferriby's drawn mouth; his lips moved
automatically.
“Not . . . not . . . .” he gasped, and
then paused. The perspiration stood
in cold drops on his brow. Dr. Keane
was at his side in a moment.
“Yes, yes, go on, Ferriby; we're all
friends here,” he said, and the rest of
us stood about in awkward silence,
even the least emotional of us suffering
something of the agony of those tense
moments.
“Not—not your train . . .
“Yes, yes, old fellow; go on 1 You
want to say, not Joe's train, but the
South-Eastern Railway Company's.”
“Y-yes. Yes, that's what I wanted
to say. I'm sure you're very good
to me; I don't know what I should
do 1 *
“Oh, that's all right,” said Dr.
Keane, and he spoke brusquely, but
that was to hide his emotion.
He then quietly advised us to go,
saying that he could not answer for
the consequences to his patient were
anything to bring on another spasm of
repartee.
Poor Ferribyl His case puzzled me,
and after they got him abroad I wrote
to Keane about it, asking how it was
that a condition of mind so often
accompanied by sound physical health
should in Ferriby's case have proved
almost fatal.
I have the doctor's reply, and read-
ing between the technicalities I divine
that Ferriby developed a capacity for
self-criticism after the pernicious habit
of the retort facetious had actually got
absorbed into his mental system, and
the agony he suffered in hearing him-
self give utterance to one feebleness
after another had gradually undermined
his strength.
Occasionally Keane is too—what
shall I say?—therapeutical for my lay
mind to follow him; he speaks of a
“varicose vein of humour,” etc., etc.
I quote the close of his letter:—
“We give it out that he (Ferriby) is
abroad because he finds the climate
more beneficial, but, really, of course,
it is the language. A strange ºngº
offers few opportunities to anyone with
Ferriby's complaint, and physically he
is already in better case. He is now
in Italy; but as he grows familiar with
the speech he will have to move on

possibly, even Peking. My private
apprehension is that so far as English-

(By Sammy Slicer.)
I am sometimes a little puzzled as to
what to write about in this column, for
I have now been a golf journalist for
I have had to turn out no fewer than four
golf articles a week in different papers.
Multiply four by twenty by fifty-two
and you get four thousand one hundred
and sixty columns about golf—say five
million words. Of course in five million
words one must have touched fairly
fully on most of the broader aspects
of the game, but each week gener-
ally offers some fresh topic for com-
ment, and to-day I have fortunately
remembered that the new course at
Bramblebury has not yet been described
in this paper.
Strictly speaking, Bramblebury is not
a new course, for it has been in existence
some fifteen years. When I say new, I
mean new to me. Those of my readers
who have played there will no doubt
be glad to hear what it is like, and those
who haven't can console themselves
with the thought that they will now
recognise the course when they do go
there.
We start with a plain two-shot hole
of 550 yards. A lucky pitch may give
us a three, but we shall probably be
content with a four. The next is
of the dog-leg variety, and when
I was there last Monday a strong
wind from the south-east rendered
it extremely interesting. To get on
the green in two it is necessary to
carry the river. from the tee. On a
calm day this is comparatively easy,
but in the teeth of a stiff south-easter
the 319 yards to the opposite bank
wants some doing. Probably most
players will find that it is hope-
less to attempt it with a cleek and
will take a baffy. The third hole does
not call for comment, but the fourth
presents an extremely pretty problem.
It is a short hole of 245 yards, and my
opponent boldly tried to run it with a
putter. I took a niblick and managed
to get safely on the green; but I
tremble now to think what might have
happened to me. There is a regular
sea of gorse and bramble in front of
the green, and, once in that, all hope of
a two would have disappeared.
The fifth hole must be described in
some detail . . . (It is ; and so are the
other thirteen.)
I took part in a novel foursome the
other day. It can hardly be called golf,
but it passes away a pleasant hour
on any of the lesser known courses,
where decent golf is impossible.
A and B play against C and D,
but instead of A and B sharing
a ball A and C share it. It is C’s
business to put A into all the trouble
when he drops out. We played four
most amusing holes in this way, until
C discovered that it was simpler just
to play A's shot straight back at him
again. After that the game languished.
From “The Daily Hope: ”—
THE WONDER OF GOLF.
(By IIenry Iron.)
It is a wonderful game this golf of
ours. The more we play it the more
we marvel at its intricate simplicity.
Its simple intricacy, to put it in
another way, baffles us. The deepest
problems of statesmanship, of religion,
of art and literature will all be revealed
to us ere we understand the secret of
this game of golf. A man may spend
a lifetime in the study of it (and surely
he could not spend his life more
worthily), but in the end he will have
to confess that he knows no more than
he did in the beginning. Sometimes
I lie awake for weeks thinking about
golf, so greatly does the mystery of it
haunt me. HARRY WARDON, prince of
golfers, once called it “a funny game.”
It is more than a ſunny game, it is a
deeply psychological game. For a
good golfer is a good man, make no
mistake about that. Success at golf
demands far greater qualities than
does success in politics, in art, in
commerce. And how much better
worth achieving ! Yes, this golf of
ours is indeed a wonderful game !

Reveal to men—for instance, how to fly,
The art to reckon cubes, or racing odds, -
The way from Hammersmith to Peckham Rye ;
But not to judge perfection: rose and lily,

To seek to find such measurements is silly;
Taking another case, I have two aunts,
T}oth of them estimable ladies; vain -
To ask me which is worthier of the twain.

All have the latest wires, and each one booms
His goods the best; the garland that I wreathe
Of eglantine outperfumes not the cedar;

That too is sweet; and how can mortals choose ?

Where angels fear to tread approach too nigh;
How shall you gauge the value of “The Thunderer”
To yon pale customer with blood-hued tie?
How of The Athenaeum ? I have sat
Hungrily down at times to read Home Chat 1
The wine, the bird, the salad, you may guess,
And give soft counsel on what leaves to browse,
But not the larger mysteries of our Press,
These are for private choice; you don't want rows.

The Portadown Unionist Club “in battle array” under Lord LoNDoNDERRY and Sir Edward CARson.
House of Commons, Monday, May 13.
—Under pressure PREMIER has set
apart four sittings for debate on
Second Reading of Welsh Disestablish-
ment Bill. When House met to-day
OLIVER RoNALDSHAY asked for more.
A punishment that would most closely
have fitted this suggestion of crime
would have been compulsory attendance
throughout the first day's sitting. The
noble and shrewd Lord, however, de-
parted at close of earliest hour and
was seen no more steeped in study of
argument for and against Second Read-
1I] g.
That hour after hour, between six
and eleven o'clock, Benches should
have been more than half empty has
in these times come to be a matter of
course. CARLYLE, who did not love
Parliaments, partly perhaps because,
had he been a member of one, others
would also have insisted on talking,
gleefully records a conversation in the
National Assembly in 1789.
“It was,” remarked a Member on
his legs, “dull as this day's assembly.”
“Pourquoi dater 3 "asked MIRABEAU.
When one writes about dulness in
the Commons there comes the reflection,
of dejection the days pass and resemble
each other.
About to-day's experience there is
a certain irony that conveys a useful,
sure - to-be- disregarded lesson. Here
we are entered upon fresh campaign
against property and the Church. The
nation is supposed to be riven into
sections, seething whether with en-
thusiasm or indignation. The Opposi-
tion, after dying in the ditch in resisting
Home Rule, are more Hibernico, pledged
to spill every remaining drop of their
blood in defence of the Church in
Wales. On opening night of struggle
they send to the front one of their
choicest champions. Promoters of the
Bill on their part put up the latest
Minister, a popular and capable man,
whose first important speech in new
capacity commands friendly curiosity.
Reasonable to expect a thronged
Chamber buzzing with excitement,
cheering the champions with applause
or with not less inspiriting hostile
interruption. What actually happened
was far remote from realisation of this
ardent fancy. There was moderately
full attendance when F. E. SMITH rose
to move rejection of Bill in speech
end of hour movement towards door
commenced. ELLIs GRIFFITHs, unduly
impressed with solemnity of position,
did not succeed in stopping the flow.
When he made an end of speaking
all pretence of interest in the matter
was abandoned. There were recurrent
moments when it seemed a count-out
was inevitable. But talk rolled on till
stroke of eleven o'clock mercifully
dammed it.
And all this while, in some secluded
spot uncheered by dinner, Lord
RoNALDSHAY was wringing his hands,
lamenting the intolerable obstinacy of
reckless PRIME MINISTER who declines
to add another day or two to course of
debate.
Business done.—Second Reading of
Welsh Disestablishment Bill moved.
Tuesday.—PRINCE ARTHUR gave
much-needed fillip to debate on Dis-
establishment Bill by delivery of bril-
liant speech opposing it. Arrangements
for intervention were cut-and-dried like
everything else that invests the affair
with depressing air of unreality. But
there was no competition for favourable
points of hearing, no “sitting out" on
Gangway steps, no moaning at the bar

of eager listeners. Just a fairly full
audience, at one in its welcome to
graceful actor temporarily returning to
familiar stage.
PRINCE ARTHUR in best form. House
listened with delight to the old style
of pinking an opponent with flashing
rapier as contrasted with bludgeoning
him with a blackthorn. ELLIS GRIFFITHs,
in course of his speech, mentioned that
the Archbishops of Canterbury enjoy
certain social precedence.
“True,” said PRINCE ARTHUR. “But
after all you are not taking £173,000
a year away from the poor because the
ARCHBishop goes in to dinner before a
Duke.”
UN DER-SECRETARY hastily
explained that he had touched
upon this subject in answer to
one of many interruptions to
which he was subjected.
“If that be so,” said PRINCE
ARTHUR encouragingly, “I think
the honourable gentleman ought
to be grateful to the questioner,
since he appears to have pro-
vided him with all the more
important parts of his speech.”
And then there was the
canonisation of the Home
SECRETARY. PRINCE ARTHUR
found in his speech on intro-
ducing Bill design to create
organisation of a new Church.
“I suppose,” he went on,
regarding Hoxie SECRETARY
with something of fatherly
pride, “the Welsh Church of
the future is to look back to
the right honourable gentleman
as its founder, and, as we talk
of ST. AUGUSTINE and St.
CoLUMBA, so posterity will talk
of St. McKENNA.”

dons of the law at his heels, vainly

From question addressed to Chief
SECRETARY it seems that the Mem-
bers of the Portadown Unionist Club
are already setting themselves in battle
array. Squads carrying deadly wooden
guns are paraded. After certain man-
oeuvres “they marched past Colonel
FitzGERALD, J.P., and Major BLACKER,

thus: “To ask the AttorSEY-GENERAL
whether his attention has been called
to the fact that the sentence passed
upon Miss MALEcKA was in accordance
with the Russian Criminal Law of
1903, which provides that anyone be-
longing to a revolutionary organisation
aiming at the separation of parts of the
country from the Empire shall
be subjected to a minimum
penalty of exile for life, and a
maximum of twenty years'
penal servitude.
“And whether" (no Parlia-

WHITSUNTIDE CYCLE TOURS.
(Some useful Hints.)
IBUNs.
It is inadvisable if over twelve years
of age to eat freely of these confections
before commencing a run. Neverthe-
less there are many uses to which a
bun can le put by the resourceful
rider. Firmly tied on with pink tape,
it makes an excellent and durable
saddle cover. If the tourist is un-
fortunate enough to have a puncture
but no repair outfit, the tyre can be
stuffed with 'chunks of bun until it is
hard enough to be ridden... If, on the
other hand; he has a repair outfit but
no puncture, a good deal of harm-
less amusement can be obtained by
splitting the bun longitudinally in half,
placing a piece of rubber cut to shape
between the two sections, fastening
them carefully together so that the bun
resumes its normal appearance, and
handing the result to the first youngster
met on the road. A*bun can also be
used as a substitute for pedal rubbers,
as a chest protector, a mudguard ex-
tension, a collision mat, or a duster.
INSEcts.
The most efficacious method of com-
bating these pests is to cover the face
thickly with zinc ointment. Insects
will then adhere in great numbels, and
the cyclist should dismount occasion-
ally, survey his features in a hand-
glass, and despatch the little creatures
in a humane manner by snipping off
their heads with a pair of scissors.
DRAKEs.
In the event of the brakes collapsing
on a steep descent, the cyclist has the
choice of the following alternatives:—
(1) Leap forward from the saddle
so that the waist impinges upon the
handle-bars, and the chin, a moment
later, upon the front tyre. Open the
mouth wide and bring pressure to bear
simultaneously with the upper and
lower jaw, and at the same time wedge
the heels against the back forks in such
a manner as to form an efficient rim
brake. -
(2) Move the pedals to quarter past
nine, and, with a resolute spring, turn
a double somersault forwards, landing
on the feet well in front of the
machine, which can then be stopped
and wheeled to the foot of the hill.
(3) Take off the pump, fill it re-
peatedly over the back wheel and
discharge it over the front wheel.
This will cause a vacuum immediately
behind the machine and a cushion of
compressed air in front, the combined
effect of which will be to bring the
FREE WHEELS. -
These can sometimes be secured out-
side village inns, but the collector
must exercise the greatest care, and in
view of the widespread activities of
the police the operation is at best a
risky one. - *
* SIGNPosts. '
These must never be trusted blindly,
since it is a favourite pastime in rural
districts to twist them round in the
sockets.” It is the wisest policy on
the whole to take every precaution, and
the following procedure is recomménded
whenever a signpost is encountered at
cross roads:--Ride along one of the
roads until a village is reached, and
ascertain its name from an inhabitant.
Return to the starting-point and repeat
the process over another road. The
signpost can then, if necessary, be ad-
justed until two of its arms are pointing
in what are now known to be the right
directions, when it may be assumed
as at least highly probable that the
remaining arms are correctly disposed.
**:
** **, *.

... --> PIGs.
Straying porkers form a great danger
on account of their playful habit of
bolting across the road at precisely the
wrong moment. It is best to dismount
on sighting one of these creatures, turn
the bicycle round, re-mount, and ride
backwards until the danger is passed.
The animal will imagine you to be
proceeding in the opposite direction,
and will harmlessly cross what he
believes to be your front. Another
plan is to climb over the hedge and
imitate the rattling of a bucket by
hammering the gearcase with a spanner.
This will lure the pig into the field and
afford you a chance of escape. -
MAPs.
In order to avoid unnecessary ex-
pense, it is a good plan to find the Free
Library at each town visited and ask
to see the local directory. An admir-
able map of the district will usually be
found just inside the cover. This
may be unostentatiously detached,
retained as long as required, and then
sent back to the Librarian by post.
OIL.
Lubricant oil is usually forgotten, so
that a list of easily obtained substitutes
will be welcome:—(1) cider, (2) fried
bacon fat (before congealed), (3) melted
butter, (4) tomato sauce thinned with
vinegar, (5) red ink, (6) sardine oil.
SARDINE TIN.
The empty tin, when suspended by
a piece of string, makes an efficient
gong, and may be presented to the
landlord before leaving as a mark of
THE CINEMA HEROES.
HoNour where honour is due, and
in a world that has instant praise for
everyone connected with the footlights
the great cinema comedians have been
too long neglected. -
Who are they 2 you ask. Well,
there are many, and their adventures
and misadventures are many too, but
the chief of them are MAX, BUNNY,
PRINCE and TontFLLINo.
* No matter into what electric theatre
you drop, there for a certainty is one
at least of the four in a comic drama,
and if only the cowboy romance and
the Indian melodrama and the events
of the week were not also present, all
four might be on view.
These irresponsible gentlemen, whose
feats and blunders give amusement to
millions of their fellow-creatures all
over the world every day—for cinema
films go everywhere—are the sons of
four different nations. MAX is either
German or Austrian, PRINCE is French,
ToNTELLINo is Italian, and BUNNY is
American." Ingland alone has as yet
no famous cinema comedian; but no
doubt one will come.
MAx is the pick of the bunch for
elegance and charm and manly beauty.
MAx is tall; he wears his clothes well;
he has animated and expressive fea-
tures, as indeed a cinema actor must
have, since he cannot speak; and about
him is an air of style. His devotion to
a little black moustache also suggests
that he will never, as the others have
done, impersonate a woman. MAX is
the man about town, the gay Lothario
of the cinema. He loves and triumphs,
or he loves and fails, and it's all one
to him. He smiles and prepares for
the next film. One day his cook leaves
him, and we see him struggling with
the mysteries of the cuisine. He goes
to the market and buys a live fowl,
and before he can kill it—with his re-
volver—he has destroyed £100 worth
of furniture, glass and crockery.
At another time he marries and, find-
ing that his wife prefers a rival, calls
in his collie as a spy. No sooner does
the other appear than the collie rushes
to the telephone to apprise MAX in his
office; and MAX, arriving at home, turns
both wife and lover out, and resumes
his ménage d deur with the collie. But
everything he does is done with sang-
froid and élan. That is MAX.
PRINCE is a more typical actor. He
has the comedian's face and figure: blunt
features, clean shaved. His rôle chiefly
is marital embroilments, jealousies, sub- .
terfuges. He tears his hair, his eyes
start out of his head, he rushes about
as French comedians always must.

young women at the same rendezvous
and the same time—by accident, of

PRINCE is in his element. Seeing so
vast a concourse he flies, and all pur-
sue, even to the river, which they swim
hard on his heels. For they are a
hardy lot, these cinema performers,
and must be ready for anything.
TontFLLINo is the Italian PRINCE;
but with a difference. PRINCE can take
part in a serious drama; TonteLLINo
never could. He has a figure pour rire
to start with : he is small with a
prematurely old face, as our own DAN
LENO had. Hence his rôle is sheer
farce. He is the husband of enormous
women, who bully him and carry him
about. He is told to fight the men
who insult them and has to take
lessons in physical development until
his muscles are gigantic. In one film
he is converted at a drawing-room
meeting and leaves it with a passion
for the conversion of others. He enters
a café and removes the drink of a
party at a table. They fall upon him
and sweep the floor with him. Un-
deterred, he pursues his proselytising
way, always ending in rough-and-
tumble disaster.

The remainder of the Capital (namely, 5,000,000 Shaws)
has been allotted, fully paid, to the Vendor, Mr. G. B. SHAw,
in part payment of the purchase price.

PURPoses of THE CoMPANY.
The Company has been formed for the acquisition and
development of the well-known statesman, playwright,
poet, essayist, speaker, vegetarian and hero, Mr. GEoRGE
BERNARD SHAw, who has himself, in accordance with an
agreement dated May 16, fixed the purchase price of him-
self as a going concern, a liberal rebate having been made
for the absence of any tangible goodwill. Mr. SHAw has
by another agreement bound himself to write and speak ex-
clusively for the Company during the period of what it is
proposed, subject to Mr. SHAw's assent, to call his natural life.
The Vendor's accounts show that he has a full productive
capacity of 200,000,000 gallons per day, exclusive of signed
letters to the newspapers, an amount amply sufficient to
ensure a handsome profit. All bye-products will be carefully
tested before being placed on the market. The Lord
CHAMBERLAIN s office and the CENsor will be maintained in
good working order so as to ensure the customary flow of
acidulated matter, and waste will be checked by the old
system of universal advertisement.
The Vendor's accounts have been examined by the Com-
pany's Auditors, who report as follows:–
DEAR SIRs, We beg to report that, after an ex-
haustive investigation, we have come to the conclusion
that no risk whatever attaches to the purchase you are
contemplating. All the undertakings of the Vendor
have been conducted on sound business lines and in an
enlightened spirit of self-interest. The SHAKSPEARE
department, with illustrations of Mr. SHAw measuring
his brain against SHARS1’EARE's, has never failed to
show profits, and the same may be said of the Marriage-
undermining Branch, opened some time ago. The sub-
office for the Destruction of Public Confidence in
Doctors has shown large favourable balances, and has
been but little affected by the Insurance Act. The
branch for the Abolition of Belief in Heroism is also
doing good work in calling attention to the Vendor.
He proposes in future to extend this branch, so as to
dents and shipwrecks. We anticipate largely increased
profits from this source. The Vendor will, we under-
stand, continue to dissect himself and his feelings in
public.
Faithfully yours,
(Signed) BERNARD, GEORGE & SHAw.
A suitable SHAw-factory building in London is under
consideration, and subsidiary companies will be established
in all the capitals and populous provincial centres of the
world.

ROUNDABOUTS AND SWINGS.
It was early last September nigh to Framlin'am-on-Sea
An' 'twas Fair-day come to-morrow, an' the time was after
tea,
An' I met a painted caravan adown a dusty lane,
A Pharaoh with his wagons comin' jolt an' creak an' strain;
A cheery cove an' sunburnt, bold o' eye and wrinkled up,
An' beside him on the splashboard sat a brindled tarrier
pup,
An' a lurcher wise as Solo Mon an' lean as fiddle-strings
Was joggin' in the dust along is roundabouts an' swings.
“Goo'-day,” said 'e; “Goo'-day,” said I; “an' 'ow d'you
find things go,
An' what's the chance o' millions when you runs a travellin'
show 2 ''
“I find,” said 'e, “things very much as 'ow I've always
found,
For mostly they goes up and down or else goes round and
round.”
Said 'e, “The job's the very spit o' what it always were,
It's bread and bacon mostly when the dog don't catch a
'are;
But lookin' at it broad, an' while it ain't no merchant
king's,
What's lost upon the roundabouts we pulls up on the
swings!
“Goo' luck,” said 'e; “Goo' luck,” said I: “you've put it
past a doubt; -
An' keep that lurcher on the road, the gamekeepers is
out;"
'E thumped upon the footboard an' 'e lumbered on again
To meet a gold-dust sunset down the owl-light in the lane.
An' the moon she climbed the 'azels, while a nightjar
seemed to spin
That Pharaoh's wisdom o'er again, is sooth of lose-and-
W1n ;
For “up an’ down an' round,” said 'e, “goes all appointed
things,
An' losses on the roundabouts means profits on the swings!”

and humour–of smiles rather than laughter—with which
Mr. BuckRose presents it are altogether delightful. Its
hero, the Rev. Andrew Deane, new Rector of Gaythorpe, is
a figure new also to fiction, and wholly welcome. The
jollity of the lad (still young enough to be haunted by an
ever-present fear of being called Andy), his good-hearted-
ness and sentiment and small affectations, are all of them
set out in a manner to make him live and be loved. Of
course in the book he is loved very actually by Elizabeth,
the Squire's fair daughter; and because, even in such a
pleasant comedy as this, the course of affection must not
run too tamely smooth, there are misunderstandings. But,
though Mr. BUCKRose keeps these going up to the very
day before that on which Elizabeth should have married
somebody else, they didn't frighten me more than the least
little bit. I was almost certain that no author could create
such an engaging hero as Andy without rewarding him with
the appointed heroine. Still, I was glad when all was put
right and I could enjoy the improbable but happily
Buckrosian fashion in
many continents, but I am inclined to hope that the
country which Miss WINIFRED GRAHAM makes the scene
of Sons of State (MILLS AND Boon) may be regarded as what
vulgar persons would call the limit. Mortimer Dugdale
soon found what kind of a place it was when, going as a
casual spectator to the lying-in-state of its youthful
monarch, he discovered that the king still breathed, and
for saying so publicly was condemned by the queen-mother
to be “gnawed by starving vermin.” Even after that
alone, the tourist agencies might advertise cheap fortnights
in lovely Lambasa in vain, so far as I am concerned. IBut,
of course, there was lots more. King Maldio breathed at
his own funeral, because the court physician who was hired
to poison him had prescribed the old Friar Lawrence mix-
ture instead, in order to rescue him later, like Juliet, from the
family vault. Which was done; and Maldio, prudently
determining not to proclaim his recovery, went off to
Cambridge instead, where it appears he had already been
educated as an undergraduate. (I must look up Mr. OscAR
BRowNING's memoirs about this.) In Cambridge he wooed

As Miss Guest puts it, “she would warm a workhouse.”
Miss Guest is a minor character who saves Mr. MARRIOTT
the trouble of direct narrative by telling the story for him
in a series of letters to her brother. It is only through the
medium of her observation that the reader is permitted to
see into the minds of the principal actors in the comedy.
The method is ingenious, and helps to conceal the fact that
the story might have been told with considerably more
brevity; but it has its defects. Somebody else's opinion of
what somebody else's opinion of somebody else may con-
ceivably have been is never quite so satisfying as first-hand
information from the author.

TO A GENTLEMAN OF ENGLAND.
[Being thoughts, suitable for Whitsuntide, on the question whether
a fair division of labour might not help to solve the present unrest.]
As when in slumber's net enmeshed,
Our limbs relaxed, our head supine,
It is our hope to rise refreshed
Just as a giant after wine,
So in the calm recess of Whit
We gather strength and moral beauty
That we may face, superbly fit,
The rather clamorous call of Duty.
You've read the wisdom day by day
Of Mr. WELLs and other seers,
Showing what England has to say
To you and all your favoured peers;
Hinting that this profound unrest
Which so disturbs our peaceful polity
Demands a sacrificial Quest
From men, like you, of knightly quality.
And now this Whitsuntide retreat
Should serve as lubricative oil
To turn you out prepared to meet
The claims of universal toil;
Not that it seemed a piece of news—-
This debt you owe your poorer neighbours,
But such appeals may well infuse
A zest in your accustomed labours.
More honestly than ever yet ".
You will address yourself to win
The prize of smartness from the set
That Providence has placed you in:
. Plying your work as one by whom
Its sanctity is understood would,
- On Epsom Downs you'll tan your bloom,
At Ascot toil and spin at Goodwood.
Henley shall see the labourer's brand
On brows perspiring in a punt;
Hurlingham mark your horny hand
Tightened against the tourney's brunt;
Dinners and dances, plays and masques —
Nightly you'll be assisting at a
Fresh item of the season's tasks
Till Duty calls to Cowes Regatta.
Nor yet the round of work is done
For those of conscientious type:
The restive grouse awaits your gun,
The early cub will now be ripe;
Then comes the pheasant's claim, and still
These calls that tax your nervous tissues
Will find you straining, neck or nil,
To solve the nation's social issues.
Then, lest upon your active powers
Too soon the lid of languor shuts,
Cull while you can these Whitsun hours!
Go maying in among the nuts!
That none may tell it, to your shame,
How, when her trouble came upon her,
You did not º your country's game

From The Making of London :-
“The worship of Lud was a water-worship."
Which is why judges (who are proverbially sober) are
THE OTHERS.
A LITTLE while ago “F. T. G. W. (Westmount),” a
diligent and serious reader of The Montreal Daily Star,
wrote to the editor the following letter:-
“Would you kindly publish in your columns a short
biography of H. G. Wells? I am most particular to know
| what professions or occupations he has followed in the
course of his life, and the probable effects they have had
upon his writings.” . . . . . . . . . .
The editor at once complied in the following terms:—
“Harry Gideon Wells, pathologist, was born at New
Haven, Conn., in 1875. He obtained the degree of Ph.B.
at Sheffield Scientific School, Yale, 1895; A.M., Lake
Forest University, 1897; M.D., Rush Medical College,
1898; Ph.D., University of Chicago, 1903; interne, Cook
Co. Hospital, 1898-9; studied in Berlin, 1904-5. Among
his published works are “Chemical Pathology, 1907,”
besides numerous articles in medical and biological publi-
cations. . . Another II. G. Wells, born in Hartford,
Conn., was a dentist, and claimed to have discovered
anesthesia and used it in his profession. He was also a
contributor to periodical literature.” - -
On perusing this, the British reader, accustomed to think
of his “H. G.” as the one and only, rubs, his eyes and
once again gives utterance to the pathetic inquiry, “What
is a sardine?” - -
One can only too easily imagine further activities of the
patriotic intelligence department of The Montreal Daily
Star. Thus “A. F. (Romeville)" asks, “Will you kindly
favour me with a concise biography of G. B. SHAw?"
The answer is prompt:— ---, " :
Gabriel Bunyan Shaw, minister of the gospel, was born
at Oxville, Pa., in 1863. He was educated in his native
town, but took his degree at the Boskito Divinity Seminary
in 1885. Since then he has had charge of many chapels in
various parts of America and is now not only pastor of
the Sixty-seventh Avenue Free Congregational Church
but literary editor of the Sabbath Recreator, a post that he
has held since 1906. Mr. Shaw is the author of a number
of devotional works, of which the best known are Fanny's
First Sermon (modelled on Jessica's First Prayer), The
Angel's Disciple, The Quintessence of Moodyism, The Mis-
sionaries' Dilemma, and Mrs. Warren's Conversion. In
addition to these he has a variety of domestic volumes to
his name, chief of which is the ever-popular What to do
with the Cold Beef. There is also, of course, the famous
G. B. Shaw, of Chicago, whose pork-packing factory is

for a succinct memoir of GEORGE ALEXANDER elicits the
following:— -
Alexander, George, American merchant, was born of
Macedonian stock at Thermopylae (Miss.), on July 11th,
1859. He attended a public school in that city till he was
fourteen, then became a clerk in a drug store, and was a
retail clothing salesman from 1881 to 1887, when he estab-
lished, with Nahum Stosch, the clothing house of Alexander
& Stosch, in Buffalo. Mr. Alexander, who has patented the
famous “anticorrugator” trouser-stretcher, early identified
himself with religious work, and has been since 1895 Presi-
dent of the Rational Dress Reform League.
One wonders if America has a correlative of every one
on this side who is at all famous. We had long known, of
course, of the two WINSTON CHURCHILLs. These later
revelations are even more astounding.
WIKINGS' FARE.
According to The Daily Mail the following is the recipe
for M. Escoffier's new masterpiece, Fraises Sarah Bern-
hardt, for whose appearance gourmets have for some time
been palpitating:—
“Select some very fine ripe berries, carefully remove the stalks, and
place the fruits in a silver or china timballe (bowl). Cover with
powdered sugar and moisten with a few glasses of “Curaçao a la Fine
Champagne,' after which keep in a cool place.
Prepare a pine-apple ice, which turn into a square ‘Comtesse Marie'
mº: also a very fine light mousse flavoured with the same brandy
Curaçao, adding a few spoonfuls of strawberry pulp passed through a
When ready to serve, turn out the ice on a deep dish, if possible
square in shape. Place the strawberries all round the ice and completely
cover the latter by the mousse.
To enhance the effect, place the dish whereon the strawberries repose
in a block of natural ice, and cover the whole with a veil of drawn
(spun) sugar."
Feeling that there is something a little decadent and
effeminate about this confection as a food for the masters
of the waves Mr. Punch's gastronomic expert has great
pleasure in presenting a similar but slightly more stimu-
lating dainty, which will be tested by a gathering of boy-
scout coſmoscenti on IIampstead Heath next Saturday. He
entitles it I'raises Francis Drake.
Prepare a large heavy mousse. To do this take two
mocassins, one tomahawk, and bow and arrows. Stalk the
mousse carefully until within about fifty yards, then pot it
behind the left shoulder-blade. Skin body and remove the
brisket (whatever that may be) and cure it over camp fire.
Use it as football until thoroughly tender, mince in chaff-
cutter, and mix with two pints of Devonshire cream (which
should be whipped thoroughly for two hours with a stock-
whip) and a quart of stone ginger-beer.
Place in a refrigerator for an hour, and if it looks cold
when it comes out wrap in soft woollen comforter and
sprinkle lavishly with red pepper. Now run the lawn-
mower lightly over the strawberry bed for ten minutes,
and pour the result round mousse. Garnish with comfray,
poppadums, and angelica. Serve hard into the left-hand




very fine sieve so as to give the mousse a nice warm appearance,

GEORGE'S WIFE'S BABY.
FROM one point of view, of course,
it is George's baby. But somehow I
never think of it in that light—partly,
I suppose, because I have never come
across George and it together, and
have scarcely so much as heard him
speak of it. There are times, indeed,
when I am disposed to doubt if George
has ever seen it.
I myself met it for the first time the
other day.
“Isn't he a darling?” cried George's
wife ecstatically, as she held it out for
my inspection; and I could not help
being at once struck by the
fact that it was a singularly
obese baby.
I looked at it critically and
dispassionately, but thought
it best not to say exactly
what I felt.
“Well, can't you speak 2"
asked George's wife. “What
do you think of him 2"
“I—I was thinking that
Surely he doesn't take
enough exercise?” I burst
out at last, trying to put it
as nicely as I could.
“What on earth do you
mean?” -
I saw that it was necessary
to state the truth boldly and
bluntly.
“Why,” I said, “can't you
see for yourself how stout
he's getting 2 If I were
you,” I went on impressively,
“I should knock off one of
his meals. And don’t let him
sleep so much after lunch ;
you can't help putting on
flesh if you do that.”
“Putting on flesh, indeed!”
cried my sister-in-law with
indignation. “Why, every-
FIRSt.
“What are you going to do with
him 2 " I inquired with an effort.
This time there was a metallic
gleam in George's wife's eyes that I
liked even less than the stiffening of
her shoulders.
“Is it possible,” she asked, “ that
you are trying to work off on me a
so-called joke which even the back
pages of the magazines have got tiréd
of printing? Do you want to know
whéther I am going to keep it or
drown it? Because I may tell you
at once that I've quite made up m
mind to keep it.” -

watch,” was her next foolish remark,
; and she waited expectantly. I waited
too. “Well, why don't you show it to
him 2 " she said at last.
“I was waiting for him to ask me ;
| you told him to, you know.” |
“Bless the man, does he think a
three-months-old baby can talk 2
Here, give it to me.”
* , “I–I think I must have left it at
home.”
“Then what's that you've got on
the end of your chain 2"
There was no help for it, and I had
to take out the watch—a new and
valuable one, given by dear Aunt
Josephine to her favourite :
(and most talented) nephew
on my last birthday—open f
the case and hold it up to his
ear. I got tired of this before
he did, and then the trouble
began, culminating in the
point at which offspring and
hairspring became hopelessly
entangled. It may well be,
as George's wife afterwards
alleged, that I gave frce ex-
pression to my feelings, and
even if I did say “Drat the
little beast !” (which I have
no recollection of doing) there
was surely plenty of provo-
cation. What I do remember
quite plainly, however, is that
before I went I gave George's
wife some sound advice con-
cerning her baby.
“It seems to me,” I said,
“that he's well on the road
to become a smug, self-
conscious,self-indulgent little
prig. He has absolutely no
thought beyond himself. But
what can you expect if you
keep him at home all day 2
Let him run about with

“Is that his name 2 ”
“Is what his name 2''
“Toodleums.”
“ No.”
“Icksey-dicksey, then 2"
* - No.”
“Then why ” But there was
a stiffened look about George's wife's
shoulders as she bent over her off-
| spring that I did not quite like.
So
once more I sought refuge in silence,
and for a space engaged in quiet con-
templation of the fleshy mass.
“Well?” asked George's wife again;
and again I found I was expected to

| intended him for.”
“Well, whatever happens, he's cer-
tainly not going to be a horrid, spiteful
journalist man who's always poking
fun or slinging mud, is 'oo, icks—are
you, Dicky darling?”
“Dicky darling,” looking his worst,
answered with a loud yell.
“There, then, did his masty unky
make him cry?”
“No, he did not,” I answered shortly.
Miraculously enough, at the sound
of my voice the crying stopped, and I
turned a triumphant gaze on George's
| wife. I could see she was in two
minds whether to make the baby yell
lºgº or not, but in the end her better
feelings conquered.
- better still, send him to a
good public school. That'll knock
some of the nonsense out of him,
and take off some of his ridiculous

words— ”
But by this time I was alone in the
room, and since then I have not been
on the best of terms with George's
wife. - Nor with George either, for that
matter. I happened to ask him for
seven-and-six, the price of repairs to
my watch, and his reply was worthy
neither of a father nor of a brother.
“It's your own fault,” he said
coldly. “What on ealth did you |
want to give it to him for?”
Two hours later I thought of a suit-
able answer; but the only person handy
on whom I could have worked it off was

| they saved the innings defeat.
AN. UNHAPPY SPEGULATION.
THIS is how I became a West
African mining magmate with a stake
in the Empire. -
During February I grew suddenly
tired of waiting for the summer to
begin. London in the summer is a
pleasant place, and chiefly so because
you can keep on buying evening papers
to see what Kent is doing. In Feb-
ruary life has no such excitements
to offer. So I wrote to my solicitor
about it. - a
“I want you " (I wrote) “to buy me
fifty rubber shares, so that I can watch
them go up and down.” And I added,
“Brokerage , ” to show that I knew
what I was talking about.
He replied tersely as follows:
“Don't be a fool. If you have any
money to invest I can get you a safe
mortgage at five per cent. Let me
know.” -
It's a funny thing how the minds of
solicitors run upon mortgages. If they
would only stop to think for a moment
they would see that you couldn't
possibly watch a safe mortgage go up
and down. I left my solicitor alone
and consulted Henry on the subject.
In the intervals between golf and golf
Henry dabbles in finance.
“You don't want anything gilt-
edged, I gather ?” he said. It's
wonderful how they talk.
“I want it to go up and down,” I
explained patiently, and I indicated
the required movement with my um-
brella. --
“What about a little flutter in oil?”
he went on, just like a financier in a
novel. -
“I’ll have a little flutter in rasp-
berry jam if you like. Anything as
long as I can rush every night for the
last edition of the evening papers and
say now and then, “Good heavens, I'm
ruined.’” - - -
“Then you'd better try a gold-mine,”
said Henry bitterly, in the voice of one
who has tried. “Take your choice,”
and he threw the paper over to me.
“I don't want a whole mine—only
a vein or two. Yes, this is very inter-
esting,” I went on, as I got among the
West Africans. “The scoring seems
to be pretty low; I suppose it must
have been a wet wicket. “H.E. Reef,
15, 2’-he did a little better in the
second innings. **, Boffin River, Hº,
17, '-they followed on, you see, but
By the
way, which figure do I really keep my
| eye on when I want to watch them go
up and down?”
“Both. One eye on each. And
don't talk about Boffin River to me.”.
I suppose it's too late now to offer you
a safe mortgage at five per cent. 2 . I
know a man who has some. Well,
perhaps you're right.” -
On the next day I became a mag-
nate. The Jaguar Mine was the one
I fixed upon—for two reasons. First,
the figure immediately after it was 1,
which struck me as a good point from
which to watch it go up and down.
Secondly, I met a man at lunch who
knew somebody who had actually seen
the Jaguar Mine.
“He says that there's no doubt
about there being lots there.”
“Lots of what? Jaguars or gold 2’’
“Ah, he didn't say. Perhaps he
meant jaguars.”
Anyhow, it was an even chance, and
I decided to risk it. In a week's time
I was the owner of what we call in the
City a “block” of Jaguars—bought
from one Herbert Bellingham, who,
I suppose, had been got at by his
solicitor and compelled to return to
something safe. I was a West African
magnate. -
My first two months as a magnate
were a great success. With my heart
in my mouth I would tear open the
financial editions of the evening papers,
to find one day that Jaguars had soared
like a rocket to 11's, the next that they
had dropped like a stone to 1,4: There
was one terrible afternoon when for
some reason which will never be pro-
ºperly explained we sank to ##. I think
the European situation had something
to do with it, though this naturally
is not admitted. Lord Rothschild, I
fancy, suddenly threw all his Jaguars
on the market; he sold and sold and
sold, and only held his hand when,
in desperation, the TSAR granted the
concession for his new Southend to
Siberia railway. Something like that.
But he never recked how the private
investor would suffer; and there was I,
sitting at home and sending out madly
for all the papers, until my rooms were
littered with copies of The Times, The
Financial News and—so literally was
my order taken—Answers,The Feathered
World and Home Chat. Next day we
were up to ##, and I breathed again.
But I had other pleasures than these.
Previously I had regarded the City
with awe, but now I felt a glow of
possession come over me whenever I
approached it. Often in those first
two months I used to lean against the
Mansion House in a familiar sort of
way; once I struck a match against
the Royal Exchange. And what an
impression of financial acumen I could
make in a drawing-room by a careless
reference to my “block of Jaguars”
Even those who misunderstood me
jaguars ” were startled. Indeed life was
very good just then. -
But lately things have not been going
well. At the beginning of April Jaguars
settled down at 11's. Though Istood for
hours at the club tape, my hair standii, g
up pn end and my eye-balls starting
from their sockets, Jaguars still came
through steadily at 11's. To give them
a chance of doing something, I left
them alone for a whole week—with
what agony you can imagine. Then I
looked again ; a whole week and any-
thing might have happened. Pauper
or millionaire?—No, still 11's.
Worse was to follow. Editors actu-
ally took to leaving out Jaguars alto-
gether. I suppose they were sick of
putting 11% in every edition. But how
ridiculous it made my idea seem of
watching them go up and down How
blank life became again!
And now what I dreaded most of
all has happened. I have received a
“Progress Report" from the mine.
It gives the “total footage” for the
month, special reference being made to
“cross-cutting, winzing and sinking.”
The amount of “tons crushed ” is
announced. There is serious talk of
“ore ” being “extracted ; ” indeed
there has already been a most alarm-
ing “yield in fine gold.” In short, it
can no longer be hushed up that the
property may at any moment be
“placed on a dividend-paying basis.”
Probably I shall be getting a safe five
per cent. :

solicitor this morning, “I might just
as well have bought a rotten mort-

THEATRICAL NOTES.
The recent action of Mr. ARTHUR
BourchIPR in changing the title of his
Garrick Theatre success to Proper Peter,
in order to meet the views of “many
parents,” is one that was sure to give
rise to considerable comment in dra-
matic circles. Other managements will
certainly not be slow to follow his ex-
cellent example.
Thus we learn, on wholly impeach-
able authority, that Messrs. VEDRENNE
and EADIE are about to rename their
programme at the Criterion; and that
The Kiss and The New Sin are to be
called respectively The Handclasp and
His Father's Will.
Mr. MAcDoNALD HASTINGs' other
work is also to be brought into line
with the new movement by having its

one of Affection—ct Cetera.
On the other hand, Mr. ARTHUR
CoLLINs wishes us to contradict a
rumour that the name of the spectac-
ular drama at the National Theatre is
to be changed from Ben Hur to Ben
Him. Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER also
denies in the most emphatic manner
that he has any intention of playing
Bella Donna under the suggested new
title of Ammoniated Quinine.
At the Apollo Theatre, every even-
ing, The Pleasant Smile.
Other recent innovations by two
West-end managements, of which one
provides a “Whisper Girl” to convey
telephone calls to members of the
audience during the performance, the
other adds a short story by a popular
author to its programme, have not,
felt that these actions mark a tendency
which, if carried far enough, may en-
tirely remove the fault so often ſound
with the theatre as a place where there
is “nothing to do but watch plays.”
Happily the palatial building shortly
to be erected by the enterprise of Mr.
CHARLEs FROHMAN will do much to-
wards this end, as we hear that, in ad-
dition to spacious reading and writing
rooms, London's newest theatre is to
be provided with a swimming-bath, a
gymnasium, and a circulating library.
It is said, moreover, that an ingenious
system of sound-proof shelters, attached
to the higher-priced seats, will enable
their occupants to enjoy complete
immunity from the often disturbing
traffic of the stage.
THE MYTH.
(A Thames Trout.)
WHERE the bulrushes grow ranker
(Oh, the long green spears a-gleam')
There the punt shall rock at anchor
In the stream;
By the weir's cool curve of thunder,
By the stones where wagtails plunder
Foolish daddy-long-leg flies,
And the strings of rainbow bubbles in
a rhapsody arise! -
Hours may pass and hours go fleeting,
You shall heed them not, but stay
Lost to them, and all the sweeting
Of the may;
For beneath the swelling current
Where the midge-cloud hangs susurrant,
And the sweeping swallows go,
Lives a most prodigious monster, lurk-
ing learnedly and low !
No! I've never really seen him,
But the boatman tells a tale
Of a something (“must 'a' been 'im ")
Like a whale
On the shelving shallow showing,
“Where them kingcups is a-growing."
Only just the other night,
And the frightened fry went leaping
from the Presence left and right!

He must be, for ne'er a fin
Does he move for any gudgeon
That you spin;
With a wink he maybe watches
'Neath the willow-root's dark notches
As you toil with aching wrist,
But the landing-net's no nearer, nor
the deft taxidermist'
But the skies are smiling bluely,
There is shade along the shore,
And the chestnut's litten newly

Drop the rod then and be thankful
For the sights that fill the bank full—

House of Commons, Monday, May 20.
—Curious how history repeats itself in
the record of Parliament. Time was
within memory of a few still seated on
the green benches when the House of
Commons possessed two BENs. One
was the Right Honourable GEORGE
BENTINCK, Member for West Norfolk,
who proudly wrote himself down in
Dod “A Tory,” an ancient honourable
style, which in his later days became
effaced by intrusion of the modern
name Conservative. The other was
CAvendish BENTINCR, Member for
Whitehaven, a legislator with tousled
hair which when, in accordance with
frequent habit, he stood at the Bar
surveying the House, suggested that
he had just been drawn through a
hedge backwards. One, by reason of
his ample proportions, was known as
BIG BEN. The other, moulded on
smaller scale, was LITTLE BEN.
To-day we have with us only one
BENN, upon whom his godfathers
and godmother in his baptism, with
prophetic foresight of what in due time

bestowed the name of WEDGwood.
The twentieth-century Little BENN
ranks in Ministry as Junior Lord of
Treasury, his place being in the Whips'
room or the Lobby. PREMIER's quick
eye discerning his capacity, he has this
session found provided for him a seat
on Treasury Bench, where he represents
FIRST CoMMIssion I.R of Works, throned
in the Lords.
The preference fully justified. The
DEPUTY FIRST CoMMissioxER's answers
are excellent alike in matter and
manner. To-day delighted House by
unexpected turn of ingenuousness. Long
question on paper affecting status of
architects engaged by Board of Works.
Reply duly read. Up gat inevitable
Supplementary Questioner with endea-
vour to confound the young Minister
by reference to state of things existing
in 1869.
“I am afraid,” said LITTLE BENN,
irresistible boyish smile illuminating
his countenance, “my memory does
not go back so far.”
The House, remembering that he is

teen, burst into roar of sympathetic
laughter, under which the Supplemen-
tary Questioner, for once abashed, sat
silent.
The incident focusses attention upon
prominent, noteworthy characteristic
of present Government. SARK, whose
memory, going further back than
LITTLE BENN's, recalls the personnel
of the DisrAELI Government, declares
that, compared with long succession
of Ministries subsequent thereto, the
average of age in the present one is
by many points the lowest. The barge
of State is manned by Youth at the
prow and (mixed) Pleasure at the
helm in the person of Asquith, himself
youthful compared with PALMERStoN,
DisBAELI and GLADston E when they
were seated in his place.
In one respect Nature has done
something to rob FIRST Lord of THE
ADMIRALTY and HoME SECRETARY of

THE ROMANCE OF PETER
GRAHAM'S WHISKERS."
PREFACE.
No blame attaches to Mr. FRANK
Rich ARDsos in this regrettable affair.
CHAPTER I.
THE BEGINNING..
I’eter Graham was in all but his
substantial form (which was short,
stout and ruddy) a self-made man.
He was very happy of disposition and
determined of character, as firmly re-
solved to do everything well for his
own part as he was convinced that all
things were for the best as arranged by
Providence. Only when he was made
a Justice of the Peace for his county
did he begin to entertain doubts, and
those not of himself but of Provi-
dence. He never questioned that he
was capable of fulfilling the magisterial
office as it had never been fulfilled
before, but he could not help feeling
that appearances were against him.
The genuine judicial face is not round,
bonny and jovial; it is long, solemn
and knowing. He improved his law,
he improved his clothes, and with
enormous effort he improved his figure.
But his face he could not alter, for if
that is not of the magisterial cut
nothing will make it so, except (he
thought in a moment of inspiration)
short, sharp and precise side whiskers.
It so fell out that about that period
Mr. Justice Phipps (let us call him)
very conveniently went the North-
Eastern Circuit and visited the assize
town of Peter's county. By so doing
he afforded him a model of the lines
which the administration of criminal
justice and the development of the
legal whisker should follow. Seeing
him, Peter at once made up his mind
and the appropriate growth was begun.
CHAPTER II.
THE END. -
The success of the new appendages,
as reflected by his mirror, seemed to
Peter Graham to be complete. He
only needed an opportunity to test
their effect on an expert or two before
he made his first public appearance on
the Bench. That opportunity was
afforded by an invitation to dine and
sleep at the Chairman's country house
on the eve of the Quarter Sessions.
Peter, full of confidence in his facial
dignity, packed his bag and set forth
not experts, but this one, he felt no
From the station to the Chairman's
house was a mile drive, and he drove
it in the village fly. Cabmen are
doubt, was in the habit of conveying
J.P.'s and would have an eye for such.
Peter was only too aware of the man's
close scrutiny and noted with satisfac-
tion the decision with which he
mounted his box-seat and started his
horse, as one who knew what he was
about. His attitude seemed to suggest
that he had noted the whiskers and
drawn a deduction from them. This
was the fact. Peter could have wished
that the man had uttered a “Mºlud,”
but had no hesitation in believing that
his thoughts lay in that direction.
This was not the fact. -- -

My Edward, since early this morning,

The house has been plunged into

Your absence has blighted our pleasure,

Midst alien flowers.
We are lonely to-night, we are lone,Ted;
Come back; let your wanderings

In the home there's an air of unwonted
And far from enjoyable peace.
Unrucked by your juvenile scrambles,
Serene in its place is each mat,
While out in the garden, unchivied,
there gambols
The Tomkinsons' cat.
Forgiven are all your vagaries;
Come home to us, all shall be right.
We are sitting and sighing, “O where is
Our wandering puppy to-night?”
Deprived of your presence we languish,
Bereſt of your bark we are sad;
Come home and redeem your adorers
from anguish,
Young fellow-me-lad.

streets of Southend, by way of protest.”
Erewing News.]
By to-night it is estimated that
10,000 bathers throughout the country
will be on strike. An important meeting
of the Executive of the Amalgamated
Society of Serpentine Swimmers is
taking place, and there is a possibility
that the trouble will assume a serious
aspect. If some agreement is not come
to during the week it is quite likely
that the Channel - Swimming season
will be entirely ruined. Southend to-
day was a scene of wild excitement.
The whole town seemed to be out. So
was the tide. All of a sudden a cry
was raised that there was a non-union
man attempting to bathe, and an angry
mob of “semi-nuděs '' rushed to the
spot. Shouts of “Black-leg 1" were
raised as the unhappy man was hauled
bystander that “black legs would be
nearer the truth" was not without
point. He was ultimately rescued by
the police. A mass meeting of the
National Bathers' Federation is to be
held in Hyde Park next Sunday. The
more hot - headed section lost their
resolution that everyone should go in
a semi-nude condition, and University
costume will be worn. There will be
a variety of speakers from divers plat-
forms. The principal orator will
be Mr. Mackintosh, about whom the
quarrel with the Southend Town
Council first started. The whole family
of Mackintosh is exceedingly popular
with the Southend bathers, and the
high-handed action of the Council in
refusing to let them walk through the
streets to the sea (if any) in bathing
costume is deeply resented. There is
also the vexed question of Mixed Bath-
ing, and it is understood that so serious
a view do the Government take of the
situation that Mr. Asquith contem-
at an early date. Meanwhile the Board
of Trade is (as usual) keeping a watch-
ful eye on the situation, and we are to
have Mr. CHURCHILL's assurance, made
after consultation with the Home SEC-
RETARY, that “the Admiralty is fully
alive to the necessity of protecting the
bathing-machines of the coast towns
in case of a riot, but that at present
the “semi-nudes” are behaving in a
most orderly manner, and he does not
anticipate that the services of the Navy
will be required.”

LINES ON A DEAD BICYCLE.
ALTHOUGH I be a thing of waggish cheer
And philosophical habit, little prone
To make much noise, or drop the kindly tear

Yet, were I soulless as a gramophone,
Ah me, ah me,
Still would I weep, this piteous sight to sce.
I'or, mark you, this poor stricken thing has been

Iſers was the hand that loved to keep it clean,
Watched it and tended it, and with fond care
. Gave it sweet oils, and swiftly would repair

From piercing nail, perchance, or caking dirt.
And 'twas a lovely creature. Of a truth,
Nature has nothing fairer to the sight
Than a young bicycle in its fresh youth,
So strong it is and slender, slight and light,
A thing of perfect symmetry, whose bright
And brilliant parts
Disarm the sternest and entrance all hearts.
And O what joy, when, with a favouring gale, -
Lightly they skimmed the land, these happy twain;
Up hill, down dale, especially down dale, *s
Although quite decent hills they would attain,
Unless the lady, finding it a strain,
Began to puff, .
And got off, feeling that she'd had enough.
A gallant time, but all too quickly changed
And sadly. It was ever woman's whim
To leave the thing she loves and grow estranged.
Perhaps she found the early gloss grow dim,
Or, haply, yearned toward some newer “jim
Which this poor steed
Lacked, and till then had never known the necd.
All this we know not. Only we expect
The lady grew indifferent, ceased to tend

The care became a nuisance, and the friend
An ever-growing bore; and, in the end,
The lady go',
Rid of it somehow—how, it matters not.
Small need to trace its fall; how it became
Cheaper and ever cheaper, as it passed
From hand to hand; we see the once sleek frame
Ungroomed, while lower in the social caste
lºver it fell, until we find at last
The pampered pet
A hireling bob's-worth for some 'Arriet.
And now 'tis dead. Its end was swift and kind,
More kind than life. With wild and frenzied leap
A mad bus sprang upon it from behind
And knocked it endways to its last long sleep.
And now about a crushed and mangled heap
The hushed crowds throng
While sad policemen bid them pass along.
Pass to thy rest, poor bike' Thy task is done.
Alone thou aged'st and alone hast died.
Thy rider saw the peril—wretched one —
Thought not of saving thee, but to one side
Leapt with a squeal whereat calm taxis shied.

Just now, but she'll be sorry for it soon.
THE LIGAMENT.
(By One who helped to tear it.)
WE got the lawn tennis net up last week—at least the
gardeners did—and it looked lovely with the court beauti-
fully marked out and all shining in the sun. Then Rosie and
I went to Dad. He was writing in his room, but we told
him he'd ordered the net to be fixed and given us rackets,
so he simply must come and play with us and really teach
us how to do it. It's no good playing that sort, of game
by yourselves, because you forget all the rules, and then you
begin to argue, and then somebody throws down her racket
and says it's not fair and she won't play any more. Grown-
ups make all the difference. w
*Well, first of all, Dad said he was much too busy and
couldn't possibly come, and then he looked out of the
window and said it wasn't such a bad day after all, and
then he jumped up and said he could only be young once,
and where was his racket 2 Then he said we must all look
slippy into our tennis-shoes. IIe took an awfully long
time getting his on, because he couldn't find them at first,
and when he did find them they were the wrong ones. He
said it was always so with his boots and shoes: the right
ones always hid themselves and the wrong ones tried to get
themselves put on. But at last he was ready, and out we
went and found Peggy waiting for us outside. She said
Mum couldn't come and had told her to go out and make a
fourth, and there she was. We didn't really think she was
up to it, because she's so small and has to hold her racket
in both hands, which doesn't look well; but she'd made
up her mind she was going to play, and Dad always in-
dulges her very much because she makes him laugh.
We began by having lessons, which was a useful thing,
but not very exciting. We learnt what all the white lines
meant and how to count, and what it means when some-
one says you've got a hole in your racket, and all about
deuce and vantage-in and vantage-out, and at last Dad said
we'd all got our railroad service quite perfect and it was
time to have a real game. He was enjoying himself tre-
mendously, pretending that his name was GoBERT and
asking us to model ourselves carefully on him. I believe
GoBERT is a Frenchman who plays tennis rather well.
Dad chose Rosie as a partner and I had Peggy, and then
we began. I served. I'm not sure Dad was doing his very
best, because he didn't put many balls to Peggy, and when
he did they were very gentle balls, and Peggy managed to
get one or two over. Anyhow, we won the first game, and
Dad and Rosie won the second, and then we began the
third. It was Peggy's service, and, because she was so
small, she was allowed to serve standing close up to the net.
She kept dancing about and chattering all the time while
Dad was imploring her to treat tennis seriously and to
remember what the world owed to tennis. So we got to
thirty all, and Dad said it must be put an end to, and, if
Rosie bucked up and helped him, they would now run out
and win the game in double-quick time. So, when Peggy
served to him next, he gave her what he called a teaser for
a return. It was up in the air and it came down with a
big flop and bounced up again ever so high. Peggy never
saw it. She shut her eyes and just swung herself at it with
her racket in both hands as if she were taking what Dad
calls a swipe to leg. She hit it all right, and away it went
skimming over the net into Rosie's coult near the back
line. Rosie was laughing so much she had tumbled down
all of a heap and couldn't get up in time, so Dad made a
rush, shouting out, “Leave it to me,” and Rosie rolled her-
self away out of the court, and Dad got to the ball, and I
thought he was going to do it. But just as he was taking

a whang at the ball he stopped short and yelled out, “Ow!

“Yes,” he said, “Rosie chucked a stone at me and hit me
on the calf of the right leg.”
We were all laughing, because Dad looked so funny
hopping about with one leg in the air; but Rosie made her
face serious and told him she hadn't thrown a stone at him.
Then Dad put his foot down and took a step, but it wasn't
much of a step, and he said, “Ow, ow! I can't walk
properly. I wonder what it is.”
At this moment Uncle Edward came on to the lawn—he
isn't really our uncle, but we call him that—and Dad told
him what had happened.
Uncle Edward said, “I know
what you've done.
I'll bet a hundred you've torn a
ligament.
A man of your age ought to be more careful.
My father did the same thing last year and was laid up for
six weeks.”
This seemed to make Dad angry. He said, “Don’t talk
rot about a man of my age not playing a footling game of
lawn-tennis.”
“Well, you mustn't play any more footling games of
lawn-tennis,” said Uncle Edward; “you must confine your-
self to the grand old athletic games of marbles and
spillikins.”
Then he helped Dad to hobble into the house.
Dad hadn't torn it badly, because he can get about with
a stick. But he says it's a dreadful thing for him to be

The hedges all whitewashed with May,

I smell nothing else night and day.
I'm weary to death of the willow-wren's song,
Of the glint of the gorse on the down,
And, confined by a turquoise horizon, I long
For the smoke and the swelter of Town.
It's O for the shops when the season is young,
Not these stupid plantations of fir;
It's O for the clip of a cockneyfied tongue,
Instead of this slovenly burr;
It's O for the glamour, the grit and the grime,
The wealth and the wheels and the whirl,
And it's O for the bliss of a glorious time—
The kind that appeals to a girl.
With zephyrs unsullied my senses are cloyed
In this box-bordered prison of bloom,
But the reek of the Tube I'd inhale overjoyed
Or a motor-bus spurting its spume.
Wistaria tassels encircle the pane,
With gold the genista is scored;
This happens each year, now it's happened
again,

And I think I've a right to be bored.

“I want a wrist-watch from seven-
and-six,” I said.
The man began to show me some at
thirty shillings.
“No,” I said firmly. “Here is seven-
and-sixpence; now show me a wrist-
watch from it.”
He looked hurt, but he produced a
neat little new season's watching in
art gun-metal.
“Does it go at all?” I asked.
This time he looked so hurt that I
hastened to reassure him.
“There, there,” I said, “I'm sure
it goes like a-like a clock.”
“Yes, Sir," he said; “very like a
clock.” -
The clock it went like must have
been the one Aunt Sophie gave us
three years ago. It lost half-an-hour
daily for a week, and then simply
dropped out.
I took the watch back to the premises,
which had managed to stay up some-
how. -
I thought the man was going to cry.
“We don't get complaints, not twice
a year, Sir! But we'll let you have
another instead,” he said finally.
The second was, I always think, the
best of them. It lost three-quarters of
an hour a day, but it went for three
whole weeks. -
When I took it back, the premises
were as up as ever, though there was
another man in attendance. He ex-
plained to me confidentially that they
didn't get complaints twice a year, but
that they would let me have another
instead.
The one they let me have instead
didn't look strong from the first; it
hardly went at all, except now and
then at night, when no one was looking.
Finally, I packed it up and returned
it with a note, intimating that I was
sorry to break their complaint record.
I also put it to them that I didn't want
another instead; that wrist-watches
I was prepared to consider seven-and-
sixpences.
Then came the master-stroke.
The watch-man replied. He apolo-
gised for the trouble my exceptional
bad luck had occasioned me; he depre-
cated strongly, however, any idea of
giving it up as a bad job; and he
enclosed a silver wrist-watch as a com-
pensation for previous inadequacies.
I kept it. I have it now. It is true
that as a watch it has its failings.
One of these is a tendency to go back-
wards. In this and in some other
respects it falls short of being an alto-
gether reliable time-piece; but it is
silver. There must be nearly a shilling's-
worth of silver in it; and I had got it
in exchange for a paltry piece of gun-
metal work.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN The Ministry of Poll Poorman (ARNoLD) Colonel
PEDDER has succeeded in making at least four real and
lovable people—to wit, the Reverend Apollos Burnett
(Poll for short), the staunch crank whose eccentricity takes
the form of aiming to become a poor man's parson by
holding aloof from the gentry, himself working with his
hands (for sake of the symbol) in fustian and corduroy—to
the enormous scandal of the respectable part of his flock;
Sarah Blagge, the strange, rugged, beautiful girl “off
the land,” whom he grows to love and takes to wife, to the
indefinite increase of the scandal; Poll's worldly and
worthy old clerical uncle, who is made alive with a few deft
strokes of the pen and killed too casually in the second
chapter; and Helen Grattan, Poll's friend (a charming
pastel), who dies in the third. The book is no mean
achievement for what, judged both from its virtues and
its defects, reads like a first novel. The author doesn't
quite succeed, I think, with the pleasant, wise little school-
master or with brutal Squire Halleck, on both of which
characters he has expended some pains. The former, with
his thoughtful and courageous philosophy, could hardly
have been so much afraid of the latter; while some mitiga-
tion of the ineffable caddishness of the leading gentleman
of the village is demanded in the interests of plausibility.
Someone would have horsewhipped Squire Halleck into
exile long before the book begins. Colonel PEDDER has
emphatically something to say; he has thought and felt,
and he has force to command a hearing. He wants to offer
to “the Church " and “Society” some frank and whole-
some truths. A candid critic has to confess that the book

I want a word with Mr. UPTON SINCLAIR. Only the
other day he was trying to persuade me to knock off food
and live on cold water and the New Thought; and now, in
Love's Pilgrimage (HEINEMANN), he invites me to pity his
hero because he could not get enough to eat. How does
he explain this? Here was this young man, with all the
water he wanted to drink and any amount of fresh air to
eat, and yet he grumbled. But then he was a genius, and
genius is notoriously eccentric. I know he was a genius,
because he keeps saying so all through the book; and also
because only a genius could have made such an impossible,
infernal, blithering ass of himself at every opportunity. (I
must apologise for my way of expressing myself, but one
falls into this powerful, elemental manner, after reading
Mr. SINCLAIR) Since I read my first novel, I have made
the acquaintance of many exasperating heroes, but Mr.
SINCLAIR's Thyrsis has them beat, if I may borrow an
expression from his own country, to a frazzle. The trouble
with Mr. SINCLAIR is that, after the success of The Jungle,
he has felt obliged to be terrible and earth-shaking over
everything. But I decline to be equally worked up over
the fact that American publishers (sordid brutes who
wanted their business to show a profit) returned Thyrsis'
novels of genius—samples of which are given at frequent
intervals throughout the story. “A book like this," says
Mr. HALL CAINE in his preface, “needs little praise." As
that is what I have given it, these words from the Master
are comforting.

situation was a rather dreary farce about rabbit-shooting
and elderly spinsters and getting drunk on home-made

certain how far Mr. GILLETT sent his tale wrong through
lack of skill, and how far from deliberate intent. I have a
suspicion that he would defend the banality of his rural
characters, their coarse and rather brutal humour, and the
general stupidity of them, as realism. If so, I retort that
realism of this kind has no business in such a book. To
create a living and human figure like the little clerk, Jones,
and set him up to be bullied by uncouth rustics and
subjected to all the discomforts of farce, is bad art and worse
taste. Moreover, it is not even amusing. Mr. GILLETT

can, only aggravates his present offence.

Taught me to face the cold with active skin,
To seek for ardour in my own exertion
And cultivate the vital spark within,

distinguished name graced my establishment, nor had I
ever in the course of a long and blameless life come upon
any Bopp. The ruler of the house, too, disclaimed all
knowledge of her, and the servants, amongst whom I
diligently inquired, each and all scorned the imputation of

her that all that she had ever heard or read about affection
was but a pale mockery compared with the emotion that
was devastating the writer's bosom. He recalled their
former meetings and the trembling of her little hand when
once, greatly daring, he had clasped it in his. He asked
what life would be without love, and answered his question
by asking what the day was without the sun and the night
without the moon or the stars. He poured scorn on the
“feelingless creatures " who were content to live alone and
without love in a world of dark shadows, and declared that
for his part the only thing that sustained him was the hope
of meeting his Amalie before the year was out. He urged
her to reply promptly and signed himself (I translate

Hermann Dunkelbaum.” I blushed at my indiscretion in
reading these tender avowals, wrote “Not known at this

A DESPERATE CONTEST.
My Whitsuntide was very nearly
spoilt by David's announcement on
Saturday morning that his rheumatism
would prevent him meeting me in the
Pentathlon I had arranged. The five
events in which I had decided to beat
him were lawn-tennis, golf, the hundred
yards' dash, the running broad leap, and
remaining in a stationary position
under water without breathing.
“I’m so sorry,” said David as he
limped up and down the lawn to show
me. “It suddenly came on in my bath.”
“Perhaps if you went up and had
another bath it would suddenly come
off.”
“I don't quite know what the rule
I suppose I throw it again.”
“Yes, but I ought to get something.
About six, I should say, would be a fair
amount.”
We had a little argument, David
flatly refusing to give me anything.
At last I split the difference and took
three. The score was now England, 3;
Australia, 0–and we went into the
shrubbery to look for the jack.
“Let’s leave it,” said David after
five minutes, “and have an old tennis
ball instead.” -
“No, no, we must have the orange.”
My idea was that when the red and
yellow balls saw it they would instinc-

“The ground's like ice,” he said by
way of apology, and led the way once
more into the bushes.
“There must be something more in
the game than this,” I said as I
followed him, “ or why should W. G.
be so keen on it 2 I can't help feeling
that I ought to be doing something
with my croquet balls soon.”
However, as I was leading by 6 to 2,
I couldn't complain; and even when
the search for the jack lengthened into
twenty minutes or more I kept up my
spirits with the thought that I was
winning a brilliant victory at one of the
most subtle of our national pastimes.
“This is rotten,” said David at last;
“It's a funny thing, I've
never had it before.”
“You’re much too young to
have it now,” I said crossly.
“Wait till you're bald before
you begin talking about rheu-
matism. Anyhow, you might
at least have had your hair cut,”
I added, glad to notice some
legitimate cause for complaint.
“Perhaps it's gout. A legacy
from my great-grandfather.”
That annoyed me still more.
David and I have always split
our great-grandfathers with each
other; indeed, he has even gone
so far as to share his last grand-
father with me too. So I have
as much right to gout as he has.
“Well, you've got to do

said. “I’m feeling particularly

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
THE BLUSH-BATTERY AND OTHER
THINGS.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-With panniers
and ringlets, blushing has come in,
the eyelids are occasionally lowered,
fans are fluttered (not waved), and,
instead of the dear, nicky little ex-
pressions that are such a comfort and
used to help one so sweetly on one's
way through life, it's correct to be just
a little bit rather formal and arrangée
and to use whole words and not nice
little bits of words.
As blushing is by way of being a lost
art, Fallalérie, of Bond Street, has
brought out a darling, teeny weeny
“Panniers-and-Ringlets Blush-Bat-
tery.” It lies just cosily perdu under
a necklace, and, in fingering your neck-
lace in the dear old, bashful, moss-
grown way, you just touch the tiny
battery when you think a blush would
be convenable, and you get a little
shock that not only produces the
requisite blush, but lowers the eyelids
at the same time.
Popsy, Lady Ramsgate, who is
always very much on the premises, is
all panniers and ringlets just now, but
she doesn't subdue herself quite enough
to be altogether It. Norty told me she
was his partner at dinner the other
evening, and she was so enormously
ringletty and so alarmingly lively and
confidential that her ringlets were
several times in his soup ! She had
such an affreur experience with her
blush-battery at the Flummerys' last
night! She was chatting to Curly
Chaloner, and really, my dear, was
playing up to her ringlets and panniers
a merveille—head a little drooped to
one side, fan fluttering, toes of her shoes
put primly together, little, breathy mid-
Victorian laugh at nothing in particular
—all quite well done. Then she thought
a blush would come in handy, and she
fingered her necklace and pressed her
tiny battery. Whether there was some-
thing wrong with the thing or she
pressed too hard, no one seems to know,
but anyhow the blush went wrong—it
was much too deep, and it wouldn't go
away, and her eyes, instead of droop-
ing, opened quite quite wide, and she
came out of her chair with a jump!
Poor old dear! she looked simply
horrid! They took her into the air
and the battery was taken off. People
say there 'll be a slump now in
Fallalérie's patent blush-producers.
The Million-Years-Ago dance at the
Piccadilly Gallery was a shrieking
success. It wasn't really a dance, for,
of course, as long ago as that we were
accordingly. The Gallery was turned
into a lovely forest, and, instead of
dancing, people just rushed about,
climbed the trees, and played hide-and-
seek among them, chattering all the
time in monkey fashion. Nothing but
nuts at the buffet. The Bullyon-
Boundermere people managed to get
in somehow, and he made such an
absolutely top-hole orang-outang that
everyone almost quite forgave them for
being there. Tiny Flummery came as
a hurdy-gurdy monkey, in a little green
velvet frock and cap, with cymbals to
clash. Norty said it was an absurd
anachronism, for, as there were no
hurdy-gurdies a million years ago, there
couldn't be any hurdy-gurdy monkeys
in velvet frocks and caps, with cymbals
to clash. I asked dear Professor Dims-
dale about it, and he said certainly it
was an anachronism, but that the
whole affair was an anachronism,
because a million years ago there were
not only no hurdy-gurdies but no
monkeys either, and we were all float-
ing about in the water in the form of
jelly-fish.
That's a lovely idea for a hot-weather
party, isn't it, dearest? The only diffi-
culty would be in getting up as a jelly-
fish. But no doubt Olga would be
able to do something for us in greeny-
white mousseline-de-soie, with plenty
of sequins and silk sea-weed.
Hugh Daubeny, the Flummerys'
artist cousin, has cut the old traditional
stodgy school of painting, as repre-
sented by the Academy (which never
accepted one of his works), and has
done ever so much better since he
struck out entirely on his own, follow-
ing neither the old nor any of the new
styles. He paints everything double,
my dear, just as we really see things
till it's corrected by something in the
back of our heads or somewhere. He
has a one-man show on at Mayfair
Hall, which is making a giddy sensa-
tion. I went there yesterday, and
thought it simply most enormously
clever! There's a portrait of dear
Stella Clackmannan that looks twenty-
five feet high and has a double set of
features. It's so appalling that you
feel at once it must be a work of the
highest genius.
Oh, my dear, your Blanche is coming
out in rather a new rôle. It's in this
way. Some distant people of ours, the
Havilands, asked me to chaperon a boy
who's lately dropped into the title rather
unexpectedly (he succeeded a first uncle
once removed, or something of that
kind). His mother's a quiet country
widow, who knows rather less than
nothing about anything, and she asked

quite a nice boy and threatens to be
handsome when he's a little less of
an ingénu. At present he's got the
quaintest beliefs and convictions. It
seems almost a pity to cure him of
them—they make him so amusing !
He thinks all women are angels.
“Quite right, my dear boy, and very
sweet of you!” I told him. “We are
all angels as a rule—only every woman
you meet is an exception 1" Another
of his lovely ideas is that people give
parties “for the pleasure of seeing their
friends !”
With regard to our juvenile-antiques,
too, he shows himself fearfully young.
He said of one of our most popular
evergreens, “Why does that old woman
dress and behave as if she were nine-
teen 2 I call it disgusting.” “Bo-Bo,”
I told him, “there are no old women,
mon cher. In civilized society, every
woman is considered young till she's
proved old — and even then she's
strongly recommended to mercy! And
as for Popsy, Lady Ramsgate, younger
boys than you have been seriously pris
of her not so very long ago, and last
year Ninny follyott tried to shoot
himself because she said she wouldn't
marry him—or because she said she
would—I really forget which.”
Truly he brings the scent of the hay
over the footlights, and yet he can say
things sometimes. The other day he
asked me whether the avoidance of the
obvious, in which he's been duly
trained, should be carried so far “ that
a fellow ought not to admire the pret-
tiest and most charming woman he
knows?” I thought it very nicely put,
and with a look, too, that shows he's
making quite progress. It's a pretty
little point that I shall certainly bring
up for discussion at the next sympo-
sium of the Antibanalites. I told Bo-
Bo, “That is perhaps the only case in
which an Antibanalite may commit the
obvious without reproach. You are
learning your lesson, my dear boy, and
have a proper horror of the usual and
the expected, but even in that you must
have an eye on the swing of the pendu-
lum. It's getting so usual now to be
unusual that by-and-by the most un-
usual thing will be to be quite usual.”
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
“The initial cost of the war to Germany, Mr.
Lawson tells us, was £77,550,000. But France
paid an indemnity of £213,000,000, and ceded
the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, which
have been valued at £64,000,000. These two
sums amount to £199,450,000, which subtracted
from £77,550,000, left the Germans with a
balance of £200,000,000, all but half a million.”

TWO OF OUR CONQUERORS,
A CoNTRAST.
IT is a fortunate circumstance for
Londoners that at the same moment
PAvLova and GENEE are dancing
divinely in rival halls; for probably
there have never been more remarkable
or more charming priestesses of Terpsi-
chore than these, and both are at their
best. Too long has America claimed
GENEE ; but now that she is our own
again let everyone who prizes thistle-
down steps, humanity and fun hasten
to see her.
With the Palace, where PAvLovA
reigns and enthralls, and the Coliseum,
which GENEE just now is touching
with radiance, so close together, a
comparison between this blest pair of
dancers is almost inevitable; and cer-
tainly it is odorous, for there is so
much room for both. They do not
compete; they supplement each other
and make a perfect harmony.
Although theirs the same lovely and
joyous art, the two dancers could not
well be separated by wider divergences:
the one the product of that strange,
sombre, decadent country where East
and West meet and barbarism seems
never far distant; the other a merry
blonde from busy prosperous Denmark.
Each appeals to a different mood.
When it comes to actual dancing—to
the precision and fluidity of the steps
and movements—there is little to
choose; PAVLova may be perhaps a
shade more astoundingly accomplished.
But for the most part our preference
is not for the execution but for the
executant. We like PAvLovA best, or
GENEE best, according to our tempera-
ment, or according, as I say, to our
mood. PAvLovA is more languorous,
more dangerous, more exotic; GENEE
is quicker, gay and jocund. PAvLovA
has more than an Oriental suggestion;
GENEE is one of us — a Northerner.
PAvLova is au fond melancholy; GENEE
is a kitten.
The Russian is more beautiful; she
has, as one imagines, a rarer beauty
than any of her most illustrious pre-
decessors, most of whom had a ten-
dency to thick ankles and powerful legs.
PAVLoyA might never have done any-
thing but ride in a carriage or recline
on a sofa–So soft and graceful is she:
and her shoulders are never to be
forgotten. But her face lacks ex-
pression. Her face, one says; yet as
a matter of curious fact PAvLovA has
two faces, not as Janus had, but as
a charming woman may have who is
capable of apathy. One is amiable, the
other is set, and they are strangely
different: almost they might belong

faces and only one expression for each;
and here is one of the chief points of
contrast between GENEE and herself,
for GENEE is not only a dancer but an
actress, with a play and range of
animation on her little mischievous
upturned features such as many an
actress who is actress and nothing else
would give her pearls for.
In the little piece in which GENEE is
now performing—an episode in the life
of one of the most famous dancers of
all, the Belgian CAMARGo—most of the
emotions pass across her face: joy,
disappointment, triumph, hope, fear,
content; while now and then, as when
she pretends that the king has repaid
the boon, she is the incarnation of
roguishness and the very spirit of
teasing.
PAvLovA would be lost here—just as
GENEE would be lost in the Bacchanale,
one can see making some kind of a
brave effort with the king and the .
unhappy young soldier, although never
to the point of touching the emotions,
as GENEE does; but GENEE one cannot
imagine for a moment in the vinous
amorous ecstasy of that wonderful
autumnal riot. Therein lies the es-
sential difference between these two
superb artists. PAvLovA is for the
sophistical; GENEE for the simple.
GENEE's little play should be seen
for its ensemble as well as for GENEE.
The story is a pretty one; the setting
is distinguished; the costumes and
colours are a delight. If only the
Coliseum management would announce
on the posters and in the advertise-
ments the precise hour at which it
begins all London would arrange its
time to go there; but, as it is, many
persons are not prepared to face the

Being a breach of law as laid down by
the new Shops Act.
I waited while Mr. Buffin weighed
and sold an ounce of hardbake to a
small child. Then, leaning jauntily on
my cane and speaking in the bland
manner, slightly tinged with hauteur,
that I reserve for shopping, I said,
“I will take, if you please, a penny

I have known Mr. Buffin, of our
general shop, for nine years. Every
month I pay him a princely sum in

and our relations have ever been
based on feelings of mutual trust and
respect.
But as soon as I had spoken I saw
that something had changed. He lifted
a packet of Righto Starch diffidently
from the counter and put it down
again. He closed the promising career
of an active and bustling young wasp

LIFE is, after all, just a mulcting
and a being mulcted. But when I go
into a shop to be traded upon I expect
to be treated with respect, by way of
compensation. And when I call on
a Company to sign a form, by which
I bind myself to be mulcted once a
year till my dying day, I expect some-
thing very like reverence. To take
only £18 p.a. off a man, while he lives
and to give him a whole £1,000 when
he dies may seem to you to be the
purest, if the most misplaced, philan-
thropy; but to me it was obvious, on
entering the Head Office, that that luxu-
rious and heavily
to examine me had not yet arrived.
But he did not have it all his own way;
I scored one over my second sister's
age next birthday. It is, I have since
discovered, twenty-five; I put it at
twenty-four, and he accepted my figure.
I wonder how much in yearly premiums

The doctor was even worse. He
only made me take' off my coat and
waistcoat in order to give him time to
finish the conversation he was having
with a sub-manager when we met.
Nor was the conversation about me;
“Ah yes,” said the doctor; “I sup-
pose I ought to have looked at your
tongue.”
He seemed to think very little of it
when he saw it.
There was no respect from the Pay-
Desk Clerk, none from the Proposal-
Form Clerk, and a gentleman in a fur
coat (a Director, I have since learnt)
asked me what the devil I was doing
when I trod on his toe in the liſt.
After that there was not only no re-
spect from the Liſt Clerk, but a stare of
the most marked disapproval and some
apparent hesitation on his part whether

The young man was no good at
answering; his idea was to ask ques-
tions only.
“What is your age next birthday?"
he pursued.
I took up a menacing attitude.
“Unless someone important comes
and makes a fuss of me within five
minutes I shall withdraw my favour,”
I said.
“Quite so,” retorted the young man;

three to play when I had my coat off;
dormy two when I had my waistcoat
off, and, if only he had halved the
seventeenth hole instead of losing it,
I doubt if he would ever have made me
remove my shirt. Even then he turned
to me quite without sympathy, just
struck me a blow in the chest, extracted
a ninety-nine, turned his back on me
and started another round of golf with
the sub-manager man.
“Are you aware, gentlemen,” said I,
“that I am practically financing this
Insurance Company, and whether or
not you two get your minimum wage

not I am secured as a patron 2"
“Sliced 2 ” said the sub-manager.
“Sliced!” said the doctor; and then,
in an offhand manner to me, “You
may put your clothes on again; I have
me to pit myself
against a Huge Concern like that.
“You laugh,” said I, “but you will
not laugh when I have done my worst.
I will pay my first premium of £18,
and then I will die.”
His face did not blanch. “We shall
miss you, Sir,” he said facetiously.
“You will miss your thousand
pounds,” I retorted.
“Not us,” was all he troubled to
reply. Well, well, I suppose he is
probably right; but yet I cannot help
thinking that, when my second £18 is
due and I hang back, they will begin
to sit up and take notice.

“Look out where you're coming to !”
said a fat old trout to a slim young one,
who came blundering blindly up-stream.
“Have you bought the river, or what?”
The youngster pulled up, and hung
motionless, like a shadow in the boulder-
strewn stream. Only his tail quivered
feebly and when he spoke his voice was
weak from exhaustion.
“No offence,” he gasped; “but oh
I’ve had such a gruelling—swimming
against the current for hours. I'm
fairly cooked, and no wonder.”
“What's the hurry?” .
“What's the hurry indeed! If I
hadn't put my best fin forward I should
have been floating among the surface
scum in the mill backwater wrong
side up. That's what the rest of the
crowd's doing.” -
“What crowd 2 Pull yourself to-
gether,” said the old trout benevolently,
“and tell me your trouble.”
“Why, my crowd, of course—Pa,
Ma, brothers, sisters, and all my friends
and relations. Pipped off they did,
without a word of warning. The
water's white with 'em, and they're
pulling them out by the pail, and
manuring the fields with 'em. Turned
up and died in thousands. Don't ask
me why, for I can't tell you.”
“Tar-tasting, my son,” remarked the
old trout; “that caused their funeral.
All the fault of the motorists, as per
usual. Tired of killing flesh and fowl,
now they're having a go at the fish.
You've saved your life by the skin of
your gills. But you've come to the
right spot now. This is the Squire's
water.”
“Who's the Squire?”
“Who's the Squire 2 Why, an
S.P.C.F. man, that's who he is. He's
so fond of us fish that he won't have
the roads tarred in this district, and
what's more he's got the District
Council to back him up.”
A tremor of gratitude vibrated the
young trout's shape.
“Noble man l’’ he cried. “How can
I recompense him for his kindness?”
“Well, perhaps you will find a way
when you're a bit bigger, some grey
morning with a dash of rain in it,” said
the elderly trout with a wink.
“Meanwhile,” continued the young-
ster, “come with me into the shadow
of that old stump on the bank yonder
and tell me some more. But half a
moment—I rather fancy that fly. You
won't mind me having first grab, will
you? I need some nourishment after
all I've been through. See you later.”

later, pained, gasping and almost in-

“I’ve had a horrible experience,” he
ejaculated. “Am I awake, or was it
all a nightmare 2 Did you see what
happened?”
“I saw that old stump on the bank,
as you call our dear Squire, hook you
with a ‘red palmer,’ and throw you
back to grow a bit bigger. He served
me the same once; but I haven't given
him another chance.”
“Well, I've got a dashed sore mouth,
that 's all I know,” cried the young
trout resentfully. “If that's the Squire,
give me a motorist.” .
“Nonsense,” chuckled the old one ;
“you ought to be blessing your luck
instead of cursing it. Come along with
me, young fellow-me-lad, I’ll show you
the ropes of this place—or rather the
‘Once bit, twice shy,' and you’ll live
as long and grow as fat as your uncle.”
So saying, with a flick of their tails
the two shadowy trout faded away up-

MoRE PUNGENT THAN MUSTARD,

[After “WANoc,” in The Referee.]
This country of ours is full of golf-
players, keepers of gold-fish and stamp-
collectors; the times in which we live
are degenerate; a mother's love is
evanescent (this will probably provoke
correspondence); and the hedgerow-
nettle stings. The last time I climbed
Mount Everest I thought of these
things, for, on the summit of , that
Lofty Dome, there was nothing else to
think of. TorqueMADA, CoNEUCIUS,
BoADICEA and DANIEL LAMBERT-
where are they now 2 (I mentioned
ARISTOTLE last week.) The Window
Tax was repealed on the 24th of July,
1851, but the Cabinet of misrule in
1912 continues on its path of deso-
lating incompetence. The coral polyp,
with infinite zeal, has built up island
reefs in the South Pacific, to the
end that the zealous missionary may
have somewhere to land. DARWIN
forgot this. The campanile of Pisa
was completed in 1350 and has been
leaning ever since; but the Crystal
Palace is empty, and the proletariat
of Great Britain reject compulsory
military service. Which brings me to
the second paragraph.
No city in the world can compare
with London in size or population.
I3erlin has its statues; Moscow boasts
a Kremlin ; Venice abounds in canals,
and Paris has many broad streets
called Boulevards. They resemble
Ringsway somewhat, but have houses
on both sides. London, however, can
point the finger of pride to her White
City, and one may go the whole way to
it in a taxi-cab without leaving the
wood-paved roadway. AGAMEMNON
offered IPHIGENIA as a sacrifice to
Diana, and DLLAs Howe, the inventor
of the sewing-machine, sold his rights
for £50; but it is no worthy spirit of
emulation of these noble examples that
prompts the Coalition Government to
offer the people ninepence for four-
pence. Times are changed, indeed;
never was Income-Tax harder to re-
cover; food is dearer; music-hall stars
have to shine twice nightly in order to
live; and present indications point to
a wet disappointing summer. Yet this
crapulous Government continues to
hold office—“rºm Tw, Tºmreis,” as a well-
known member of the Opposition re-
marked a few days ago. It behoves
us all, therefore, to study the Sunday
papers. For, in the fulness of time, the
Pyramids will crumble to dust, the
energies of Vesuvius will be paralysed;
the quadrature of the circle will be
and the last horse-'bus will accomplish
its last journey to Victoria Station.
Then, no doubt, the youth of England
will take to learning commercial
German, and the words of “VANOc”
will be remembered.
A PHRASE.
FROM far Japan comes a little Guide
on Hakone, written in English as well
as he can by C. J.TsUCHIYA, and one of
its phrases is so admirable that it should
be put on record for inferior English
scholars to imitate. Hakone, it should
be premised, is a village of thermal
springs situate on the top of Hakone
mountain. The mountain was once a
volcano, “but lately its activity became
quite absent.” The natural disposition
of the villagers of Hakone is “gentle
and honest,” and “their mutual friend-
ship is so harmonious as that of a
family.” The village is famous for its
fresh air; “during the winter days the
coldness robs up all pleasures from our
hands, but at the summer months they
are set free.”
But now for the shining phrase.
Hakone was the scene, thirty-odd years
ago, of a decisive battle which gave
feudalism its death-blow. The two
contestants were the Lord of Odawara-
Han, of the Imperial army, and the
Lord of Böshū, who stood for feudalism.
For a while the Lord of Böshū con-
quered, and he drove the enemy to the
castle of Odawara, where they made
themselves secure. He then advanced
upon them, feeling certain of victory.
But he had calculated badly, or, in Mr.
C. J. TsUchiya's delightful words, “he
missed unexpectedly his cogitation,"
with the result that the foe rushed out
suddenly and defeated him.
Let us all take example from the
Lord of Böshū and endeavour, when
we have a cogitation, to hit it.

[JUNE 5, 1912.
A NEW DRAMATIST.
SIR ALGERNoN FARLEY, the popular
actor-manager, in company of the
famous playwright, Mr. Bellamy Par-
tington, had gone on his annual vaca-
tion to take the fashionable waters of
Pumpenstein. Sir Algernon loathed
publicity, and had over and over again
pointed out to interviewers that lack
of privacy was the bane of an actor's
calling. In accordance therefore with
his known wishes, his press-agent had
caused to be circulated in every news-
paper in the United Kingdom the
statement that Sir Algernon had gone
abroad and that no letters would be
forwarded to him; and it was clearly
by inadvertence that the actual address
of his retreat was inserted. The secret,
however, could not in any case have
been long suppressed ; it must at an
early date have found its way into the
columns of Court and Society news, so
fierce is the light that beats upon the
movements of genius.
Sir Algernon and Mr. Partington
were sitting over their coffee and
liqueurs in the lounge of the Hôtel
Carlton et des Etrangers Distingués
when a telegram was handed to the
former. The knight glanced at it,
muttered a stage-oath, and tossed it to
Mr. Partington, who in turn gave suit-
able dramatic expression to his surprise
and chagrin.
The telegram was from Mr. Deben-
ham Courtois, Sir Algernon's business-
manager and confidential adviser, who
did everything for him except the play-
ing of his rôles; and there were those,
himself included, who thought that he
might have compassed even this feat
In an emergency.
It stated that the revival which had
been mounted as a stop-gap pending
the rentrée of the actor-manager was
itself moribund, and that the theatre
would have to be closed unless Sir
Algernon saw his way to the produc-
tion of a successor at an earlier date
than had been intended.
Confident of the running powers of
the revival, Sir Algernon, in the hurry
of departure, had not discussed with
his business-manager the question of
| his next new play, which was the work
| of Mr. Partington, and entitled A Fated
Life. But in the leisure snatched from
those social engagements which are
| among the penalties of greatness he
had, during his holiday, already begun
| studying his part with the author, and
suggesting many personal touches by
which his own part might be made
more prominently effective before its
ultimate “creation.”
“It looks,” said Mr. Partington, “as
time here and return at once to start
rehearsals.”
“That,” said Sir Algernon, “is un-
thinkable. I owe it to the public not
to curtail my rest-cure;” and he knitted
his brows in profound thought.
At last, “I have it,” he said. “I
have left behind me a duplicate manu-
script of your play. I will wire to
Courtois to cast the parts and do all
the preliminary work in advance of my
return. Invaluable man, Courtois.”
Then Sir Algernon summoned a
chasseur and despatched the following
telegram: “Put A Fated Life in re-
hearsal at once. Leave everything to
you. Will return in a fortnight in time
to take up my part.” -
“That's settled,” he said, “and we
can stay out our full time here.”
+: +: +: +: º:
A fortnight later the two strolled
unobtrusively into the theatre during
the progress of rehearsal. They sat
down and listened; then they looked
at one another.
“Do you recognise this?” said the
actor-manager.
“Not a syllable of it,” said the play-
wright.
“What in the name of is all
this, Courtois?" cried Sir Algernon
with his customary restraint of manner.
“The play you wired to me to put
on,” replied Courtois. “Took three
hours to find it in all that stack of
dusty manuscripts.”
“And what in thunder do you call
it?” said Sir Algernon.
“The same as you called it,” replied
the indignant manager; “A Fated
Wife.”
The exchange of amenities which
followed is not for reproduction. Ulti-
mately the telegram was produced, and
there—due, no doubt to the innate
stupidity of an exotic operator—were
these identical words. It had so
chanced that, among the mass of
unread manuscripts with which Sir
Algernon's repositories were stuffed,
there lay perdu a play of this very
name by an unknown author, Mr.
Vernon Vaughan, and the indefatigable
Courtois had dug it out.
What course was to be adopted at
such a crisis in the affairs of the
metropolis 2 To drop the play and
start rehearsing Mr. Partington's would
mean the indefinite postponement of
a first night already announced to an
expectant world; it would mean a blow
to Sir Algernon's reputation for keep-
ing faith with the public.
Happily, young Vaughan's play
seemed passable (though you could
never tell); anyhow, its most patent
faults of inexperience could be re-
tenure of fame, could afford to be
generous, and so waived his right of
priority. To do him justice he did
not foresee that the success of the un-
known writer's play would keep his
own in suspension for the best part of
a twelve-month.
*: *: -: -: +:
“Mr. Chairman, my lord duke, my
lords, ladies and gentlemen,” said Sir
Algernon, rising to respond to the
toast of his health at a banquet of the
Onpushers, six months after the events
narrated above, “I must disclaim any
exceptional merit, such as your
President would impute to me, for the
discovery of our new dramatic genius.
I am sure that my brother-managers,
equally with myself, leave no stone
unturned in the process of prospecting
for hidden talent. We read faithfully
every manuscript submitted to us;
and I say, as I have always said, ‘Let
the Unacted take heart. Let them
continue to send in their works to the
actor-managers of our great theatres,
assured that they will be carefully read
and conscientiously considered.' We
are always keenly on the look-out for
new Pineros, for budding Barries, for
incipient Sutros—(applause)—and the
days are gone by—if they ever occurred
—when manuscripts were suffered to
lie untouched in managerial cupboards.
And, if any play, by however obscure
a writer, possesses but a fraction of the
merit of that of my young friend Mr.
Vernon Vaughan, its author may have
absolute confidence that no manager
will be so careless of his duty to the
public, so insensible of his own needs,
as to ignore or overlook the promise
that lurks within it.” (Loud and pro-
longed cheers.)
What to do with our Brooks.
“When, after much service, a brook becomes
shorter on one side than the other, and the ends
of the straws as sharp as needles, dip it in hot
water, and trim it down quite evenly with the
shears.”—Dublin Evening Mail.

remember.

Eve (Constable) is one of those books that you begin by
liking much, and admiring slightly, and end by admiring
enormously—and hating. At least that has been my case.
During the earlier chapters of Mr. MAARTEN MAARTENs' new
story, I told myself that I must really start for Holland
next week, if only on the off-chance of encountering such
delightful persons as the Melissants, and so charming a
circle as that in which Eve grew up. Now, when I have
finished the story, the thought of Holland gives me just the
same shivery distaste as would any place where something
very sad and terrible had happened to friends whom I knew
intimately, and loved. I certainly loved the Melissants,
father and mother—called “the children” by their offspring,
who adored them with a kind of careless patronage—and all
slabs, the bulkier the better; and I do not predict a “best
selling” success for the stories and sketches of the late
RICHARD MIDDLETON which have been published by FISHER
UNwiN under the title, The Ghost Ship, with an excellent
preface by Mr. ARTHUR MACHEN. It is not a book that
will be borrowed by the many, but it will be bought and
preserved by the few. “Richard Middleton,” says Mr.
MACHEN, “knew that there was a puzzle; in other words,
that the universe is a mystery; and this consciousness of
his is the source of the charm of The Ghost Ship.” That, I
think, is as near as one can get to a satisfactory criticism
of these sketches. Superficially, they are slight; but at
the back of them there is something vast, which it is
impossible to put into words. The first of the collection,
for instance, might be classed as just an admirable bur-
lesque, but for the something which gives it dignity and
spaciousness. Captain Bartholomew Roberts, who comes in

age, is the last person you would expect to find having
experiences and getting mixed up in other people's crises
on the East African coast or in the Russian interior. I
do not suggest that this class, as it exists, is dull or lacks
initiative; indeed, no man, who numbers among his
acquaintance one of these sweet and competent old bodies,
would dispute the fitness of things which provided so
many curious and dangerous situations for Miss Gregory
to deal with, or would accuse Mr. PERCEVAL GIBBON of
exaggeration in endowing her with the energy to seize her
sporting opportunities and the ability and resource to
achieve so many successful issues. No; what I mean is
that, when a card-sharper's suicide, a royal elopement or
a conflict with a slave-dealer is afoot, this is not the sort of
dea er machind that one looks for in a novel. I congratu-
late Mr. GIBBox on having struck a new line of adventurer.
To maiden ladies of lineage and mature years we can, with-
out grudge or incredulity, allow that unerring judgment
and infallible power which are necessary to heroes and
heroines of such a series of incidents; but we know that
they have one fault, that they lack something, as the author

every one, as disagreeable as could be ; indeed, I rather
admired him for this. When, in the early chapters, I was
introduced to the widowed Mrs. Lumley and found her and
her two despicable sons living on the bounty of old Mr.
Brozworth, an aged invalid who had taken a sick man's
fancy to Beatrice Lumley, the daughter, I thought them at
least human. And when Lewis Lumley, the chief and
most unpleasant brother, upbraided Beatrice for not having
persuaded her old patron to marry her, and thus ensure
the future of her relatives, I gave him what credit was
possible. But when, immediately afterwards, old Browworth
is reported to have died at Hyères, and Lewis not only
pretends that the marriage has taken place, but actually
bullies his sister (surely the poorest-spirited heroine on
record) into not contradicting him, my sympathy with the
family suffered a shock from which it never wholly rallied.
Naturally what happened was that, though the tale was
believed locally for a while, demand for proof on the part
of the remaining Browworths—who were, if possible, more
uninviting than the Lumleys—simply crumpled it up.
Beatrice, however, didn't seem to mind much; and, having
now happily got rid of Lewis, she decided to marry the
chief constable of the ceunty, who had pervaded the
story hitherto in a vague manner that hardly justified
its being called after him; and frankly I was glad to see

able sanatorium. He is discovered by plutocrats and
professional invalids, who succeed in making him at once
rich and wretched. Civilisation irks him, and he loses
both what is personal in his healing power and all
love for his wife. The only fault to be found in the
handling of this remarkable story is that the author
shows too little sympathy with the wife, for it must be
confessed that her husband was easier to love than to live
with. The book, however, is one to read, for although
Mr. HERRICK speaks at times with exceeding frankness
he cannot be accused of salacity. He has very definite
opinions and an attractive way of expressing them.

A HINT TO AVIATORs.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I want to
make a little suggestion, which I feel
sure would popularize cross-country
flying. It occurred to me last Saturday
during the Aerial Derby, when I and
my two young daughters needlessly
sustained some severe nervous shocks
from being unable to distinguish
M
suggestion is that, if the aviator waii
make a point of waving a green flag for
a vol plane, and a red one for a fall, we
should know when to
watch a sublime spec-
|tº with wonder and
admiration, and when to
look the other way. In
|case of the latter un-
fortunate contingency,
may I also hint that, if
a megaphone as well as
a red flag could be in-
cluded in the aerial out-
fit, the aviator could then
protect the physical as
well as the mental sus-
ceptibilities of the spec-
tators, by advising them
not only that he is falling
but also where the fall is
likely to take place.
I feel confident that the
dear aviators will not be
offended by this little
suggestion, because I
understand, from people
who have met them so-
cially, that they are quite
charming men in their
– ordinary clothes.”
Yours very sincerely, “MoTHER.”

“As we pause by the roadside a small brown
bird springs out of the grass at our feet. It is
a sky-lark. Stooping down, we see a little nest
with three warm eggs in it. The sight inspirits
us. The same lark sat on the same eggs three
thousand years ago, and the same lark will be
sitting on the same eggs three thousand years
hence.”—Mr. James Douglas in “The Daily
News,” die.
In a recent issue of Punch the remark
that “while adults should rise from the
table hungry, children should reach a
sense of repletion before rising” was
wrongly attributed to the Headmaster of
Rugby. Mr. Punch has great pleasure
in expressing his regret to Dr. DAVID
for having credited him with an ob-
servation which threatened, if that
were possible, to extend his wide
popularity among his boys.

WE partook, wisely and well, of the dinner that Mrs.

“One of us,” she announced, rising to the occasion.
“goes out of the room, and the others think of a proverb.”
“As far as going out of the room is concerned,” said I,
“I am one of the others.”
“And as far as thinking of a proverb is concerned,” said
Henry, “I am not.” So Henry had to go out of the room
and I started thinking. --

work have not had the opportunity of doing much pro-

P. think of a proverb, but you do not, as in other
games, double it. Instead, you distribute the proverb,
word by word, among such of you as remain in the room,
and then arrange yourselves in a semi-circle, leaving an
empty chair in the middle. Thus, in our instance, Henry's
sister was to take the first word, Mrs. Shaw the second,
the Vicar the third, Miss Smithson the fourth, I the fifth,
and, to cut the matter short, so on. It was for Henry to

absence of Henry, “one should select a proverb with no

“Give me the a,” said I, “and I guarantee to introduce
it into my answer in such a manner as to baffle the keenest
observer.” - -
“For the less competent and more bashful it is only
fair to choose a proverb with a conspicuous word in it.”
“Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you is about
Henry's mark,” said his sister; but we thought of a
better one than that.
“Come in 1” we cried, and Henry came in. (He was,
he has since told me, glad to do so. The hall was
draughty, and the only other people about it were servants
clearing away. They regarded him as if he were playing
a game by himself, and he did not feel at all proud about it.)
“Ask us all questions, starting with me,” said Henry's
sister, briskly. She appeared to have no confidence in his
social ability. . . * . . -
“Why?” said Henry.
“Do as you are told, and ask me a question.” Sisters
are like that, but brothers know how to deal with them.
“Why?” said Henry. .
His sister gave in and searched for an answer which
should contain her allotted word. “The best people do
as they are told, without asking why.”
Henry did not maintain his brilliant start. He stared
gloomily at Mrs. Shaw, and Mrs. Shaw stared encourag-
ingly back. “Upon my word,” he declared at last, “it
is extraordinarily difficult to think of a question, isn't it?”
“Who am I that I should say?" answered Mrs. Shaw
quickly, being an expert.
Henry turned upon the Vicar and put his next question.
“What is the proverb 2" he asked, simply. The Vicar's
idea was very good: “As I live I don't rightly know.” But
the execution was poor, for this was how he said it:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ROSE GARDEN.
(After the Author of “The Rosary.”)
I.
THE butler placed the solid gold tea-
pot on the tray before Jane, and, bowing
gracefully, retired.
Jane glanced at the Boy as he lounged
in the satin-covered deck-chair. The
harmony of his pink socks and his
purple silk blazer did not blind her to
the ardent glow of his eyes.
“Don’t,” she said. -
“Don't what?” asked the Boy, show-
ing his pearly teeth.
“You know.”
The Boy stretched out his hand
for the fragile porcelain cup — worth
more than its weight in platinum.
“Every time I look at your beautiful
hand lifting the solid gold teapot I
kiss it with my eyes.”
“My pink-faced boy,” she murmured.
“He was flying yesterday.”
Another moment and she laid the
paper down and was speeding toward
the great Elizabethan mansion which
had been her home from childhood.
Her dainty feet pattered over the
costly mosaic pavement of the hall. A
marquis held out a detaining hand, but,
evading him, she vanished to her suite
of rooms. .
An hour later she reappeared. A
scarf of priceless Brussels gagged her
dainty mouth. Padding of Lyons silk
stopped her exquisite ears. -
“Jane,” cried the Duchess, “what is
the meaning of this?”
Jane made a sign to the butler.
With the intuition of a faithful family
servant he produced a gold-mounted
writing tablet and a pencil of green jade.
The Duchess stared at the message
For one moment the Archbishop was
a little overcome by the scent of the
roses in which the church was ankle-
deep, but he recovered himself. When,
Jane, on the Duke's arm, floated grace-
fully down the aisle the eyes of the
pink-faced boy met her and kissed her
across the church. With a beautiful
smile on her face she listened to the
solemn service, and with calm con-
fidence signed “I will” with her
fingers. ' -
A thrill of emotion passed through
the church. Even the baronets and
knights, who, to prevent inconvenient
crowding, had been kept in the church-
yard, participated in it. The Duchess
kissed her tenderly and then, on the
arm of her husband, she walked down
the aisle. She had chosen poverty,
affliction and the pink-faced boy, and
she was radiantly happy.
“I knew,” she whis-
pered. “Boy, I am forty-
nine.” º
“Girl, dear girl, I am ~~~~
twenty-one, but I love
you.”
“Little pink-faced boy,
I am here to chaperon
my niece. She is your
age, she is beautiful, she
has a hundred thousand
a year. Marry her, pink-
faced boy.”
“What is money? Jane,
share my poverty with
me. I have but fifty
thousand a year. It may
be a generation before
I succeed to the peerage.
I hide mothing from you.

of the family. “And now

She rose from the ebony garden-chair
embossed with pearls.
“Pink-faced boy, go.”
Her gesture was so commanding that
he ebeyed.
As his slim, graceful form vanished
through the pergola a blackbird fluted
in the myrtle-tree. Another moment
and Jane's full sweet voice arose in all
its mature sweetness. The birds hushed
in their nests. She sang “The Rosary.”
“At it again,” murmured the butler
from behind the sweet-briar hedge.

Jane carolled in the rose-garden till
the Duchess, who was removing with-
ered leaves with an exquisite pair of
gold scissors, raised her eyebrows in
silent protest. The butler came forward
with the Country-House Edition of The
Daily Mail (printed on white satin)
upon a heavy golden salver. He pre-
sented it pointedly to Jane. She sank
on to a mossy bank and with eager
|Jane wrote. “My little pink-faced boy

“Gracious goodness l’exclaimed the
Duchess.
“It’ll stop her from singing, any-
how, your Grace,” said the butler, who,
with the licence permitted to an old
retainer, had glanced over the Duchess's
shoulder.
1II.
“Little pink-faced boy,” she said in
the deaf-and-dumb alphabet, “if you
want me I am yours.”
“Jane,” he signed, “darling girl.
I am poor; I am afflicted. I cannot
accept your sacrifice.”
“Pink-faced boy,” her quick fingers
spoke, “I too am deaf and dumb.”
He leapt to his feet and clasped her
to him.

THE papers recently contained an
account of the distressing accident
which befell the Duke of ORLEANs
while playing golf on the Evesham
Club links. “He was taking a big
spring,” so we read in The Pall Mall
Gazette, “and slipped, falling heavily
on his right hand. Yet, in spite of
having sustained a fracture of the
metacarpal bone and wrenched the
muscles of his forearm, he was playing
golf at Cleeve Hill next day, using his
left hand only.”
It is a great satisfaction to us in
these democratic days to know that the
fortitude displayed by the Duke is not
an isolated example of heroism in
ercelsis, but, as the following para-
graphs show, can be paralleled by a
number of similarly exhilarating in-
stances.
Thus Lord Gosslyn, while recently
engaged in throwing stones at an
empty ginger-beer bottle on the sands
at Clacton-on-Sea, slipped on a piece
of seaweed, and fell into the sea, which
at that point was several inches deep,
and was stung on the right wrist by
a jelly-fish. In spite of his injury

ing his umbrella in his left hand.
Sir Halford Bond, the famous
financier, met with a painful accident
the other day while lunching at the
Fitz Hotel. Having taken a mouthful
of caviare, he began to tell an ex-
tremely humorous anecdote before the
process of deglutition was complete,
and was seized with a painful choking
fit which caused consternation amongst
the waiters. Fortunately Sir Austin
Tabb-Lloyd, the famous throat special-
ist, happened to be lunching at an ad-
joining table and, rushing to the
assistance of the distressed plutocrat,
was able to give him speedy relief.
Sir Balford Bond, who is a man of iron
constitution, returned home in a taxi,
and was so far $ecovered that at five
o'clock tea he was able to partake freely
of his favourite crab and Devonshire
cream sandwiches and embark upon
another story.
A regrettable accident befell Mr. Bax
Remington, the famous novelist, while
he was dressing for dinner last Friday
night. As he was struggling with a
refractory collar-stud Mr. Remington
lost his balance and fell, striking his left
elbow against a radium-mounted boot-
jack. The bruise caused by the blow
comfort caused thereby Mr. Remington
dictated his usual 4,000 words the next
morning to his amanuensis, Mr.
Widgery Roblett.
Last Saturday the Duchess of Dar-
lington, while entertaining a number of
distinguished guests at tea, was trying
to blow out the lamp beneath a tea-
kettle with a gold tube. Unfortunately
the Duchess, who, like all members of
her family, is endowed with a superb
pulmonary equipment, directed so
powerful a current of air on the lam
as to upset it, with the result that the
flaming spirit was spilt on to a plate of
almost priceless muffins, which were
entirely destroyed by the devouring
element. Several footmen were soon on
the scene, and the flames were quickly
extinguished, but the Duchess's com-
plexion was seriously disturbed. Yet
only three hours later she was seen at
her box at the opera looking as serene
and beautiful as if nothing had
happened and with a complexion as
good as new.

NOBLESSE OBLIGE.
PAMELA was in her apple-green frock
in her red hammock in her father's
orchard. Thus I came upon her on
that eventful day.
Pamela, I should mention, is my
betrothed. I cannot say that the en-
gagement gives me entire satisfaction,
but why should I depress the reader
at the outset by any sort of gloomy
forebodings. No doubt the girl means
well. -
In order to surprise and delight her
after the manner of lovers, I approached
on tip-toe, and up to the last moment
she had no inkling of my advent; then,
like a startled kitten, she sprang up
into the air and gave a scream that
echoed through the orchard.
“You,” she gasped, “James,” and,
falling into my arms, she buried her
face against my shoulder.
“What is it 2 ” I said. -
“I can't tell you; it's too awful.”
The words came to me muffled by
the summer-suiting. -
“The more awful it is,” I assured
her, “the better I shall like it. I love
to be filled with awe.”
She raised her head and surveyed me
with round eyes.
“James, a man has been here . .
all the afternoon making . . . love
. . . to me.”
A hot flame of jealousy swept through
my veins from top to toe.
“Ha!” I exclaimed, “where is the
double-faced serpent in the tree-tops?
I will shoot him like a dog.” (I can-
not say that I know exactly how to
shoot like a dog, but doubtless there is
some method.)
Pamela clasped her hands to her fair
throat.
“Do not shoot him,” she cried.
“You will be hung.”
“Hanged.”
“Hanged Oh, James, I cannot lose
ou.”
“Then he shall be horse-whipped.
The hound shall not escape my wrath.”
Pamela gave a cry of ecstasy.
“Oh, yes, yes,” she cried. “Go
now ; you will find him at his house.”
I stamped twice.
“Tell me the villain's name.”
“His name is Bertie — Bertie
Fulyard.”
“What . . . Bertie? Not that . . .
that enormous chap 2"
“Yes, that 's the man.”
“Oh, no, I think not.”
“What do you mean, “you think
not '? I know it was Bertie.”
“I doubt it,” I said, “I doubt it
very much. . We must not jump to the
conclusion that it was Bertie.”
Silly When the man's been here
making love to me, I must know
whether it's Bertie or not.”
“It might have been some other
fellow made up as Bertie,” I suggested.
“He might have some odd idea that
it would improve his chances.”
Pamela flung herself into the
hammock.
“We should all be sorry,” I said,
“if, after I'd gone and hurt the poor
old thing, we found it was somebody
else.”
To tell the truth I was rather
disinclined to move in the matter. I
had had no previous experience either
in horse-whipping or shooting like a
dog, and I did not feel that Bertie
was a suitable subject for a first experi-
ment. Later on, perhaps, yes.
“And besides,” I said, “I’ve got no
horse-whip. What a pity, isn't it?”
Pamela turned in the hammock.
“You could buy one,” she said.
“I had thought of that,” I said,
“but it is no easy matter. There are
all kinds of complications. I believe
you have to have a licence signed by a
magistrate.”
Pamela climbed out on to her ſect.
“James,” she said, “are you brave
—or not 2."
“Of course I am,” I said.
brave as seven lions.”
:* :: + -
I walked and walked until I came to
a cab-stand, where I ſound one cab.
“Want a keb, Sir?”
“No,” I said, “I do not. What I
want is a whip. I am a bull in whips.”
I always talk business in this sort of
smart clever way. But the man was
dense, and it was a long time before
his brain began to grasp the proposi-
tion. When he at last saw clearly he
became suspicious, scenting, no doubt,
some sinister design.
“Woffor?”
“For purposes of my own. Possibly
to go fishing. It might be as a pipe
cleaner, but that is unlikely. What
you've got to tell me is your price.”
He took the whip out of its stand
and regarded it in solemn thought.
“For this 'ere whip, guvnor,” he
said at last, “I’ll take two quid.”
“Done.”
I doubt if ever a bargain was closed,
even by an American financier, with
more aplomb.
The cabman suggested that we should
go across the road and drink each
other's health, but I told him that I
had placed myself under a solemn oath
neither to eat nor drink until a certain
deed was accomplished, whereupon it
was agreed that he should go across
and drink them both while I kept an
“I’m as
+ .*.
It seemed to me that a little practice
would not be out of place. The horse
would doubtless make some sort of pro-
test, but, as its hind legs were more or
less tied to the cab, and its fangs buried
in its nose-bag, I had no great anxiety
on that score. So I patted its neck
first to show that we were friends, and
then took aim and gave it a considerable
whack.
It knew at once when it had had
enough. Tossing its head wildly, it
galloped off with the cab rattling be-
hind it, and almost immediately disap-
peared out of sight and out of this story.
After that, I looked about for other
useful objects, but, with the exception
of lamp-posts, I could find nothing at
all resembling the shape or form of
Bertie. If he had only been a short
fat man the pillar-box would have been
an admirable model.
By the time I reached all that mes-
suage called “Pine Cot,” the property
of Bertie's people, I had got my eye in
and was ready for the fray.
I rang the bell violently.
The maid trembled before me.
“Where is Mr. Bertie 2 " I asked.
“In the drawing-room, Sir.”
I heard the distant clatter of china
and conversation. Bertie would be
handing round the tea-cups. -
I could not go in and beat him before
his mother and the lady visitors. In
the society in which I move such a
proceeding would have been condemned.
The proper course was the course
I took. Placing the weapon in the
umbrella-stand I went into the draw-
ing-room, and, with a smile over a
boiling heart, handed round cakes.
After tea, we went to smoke in the
billiard-room.
We played a game of billiards and
I beat him. Then we played a game
of croquet and I beat him. Then we
played a game of billiards with the
croquet balls and I beat him. Then we
played a game of croquet with the
billiard-balls and I beat him.
Then, of course, I went home.

joke about rain and reins and tore back,
but he had disappeared into the house.

Stretched thy length on a lettuce-bier,
For the glittering lamps and the foreign waiters,
For the frocks and the mayonnaise.
Yes. Or it may be up the river,
Long ere Tamesis tastes the brine,
Out on a punt where the rushes quiver
And the green boughs intertwine,
Far, O far, from the trident strong -
Of the great sea-god, thou must feel the prong
Of the Naiad's fork, and thy tentacles long
Are stretched in vain, and the girl (forgive her 1)
Such the deaths of the old Atreidae;
Such the horrible type of doom
That fell upon Itys; so untidy
Perished that minstrel whom,
Bacchanal-mad for the love of him,
Women of Thrace tore limb from limb;
So full oft for a woman's whim
(For a fair young girl, or a perfect lydy)
Thou perishest—but thy bloom,
That was not there in the salty billows,
There where the dreadful snakes are coiled,
Bursts to life on thy salad pillows
Because thou hast just been boiled.
If ever in wandering off the shore
Deeds thou hast done not well before,
By the rosy flame that hath flushed thee o'er
Now art thou shrived of thy peccadilloes,
Now is thy soul assoiled.
That is a comforting thought, O lobster;
Ay, and there's more:–if it comes to woes,
Perhaps I had better have made the throb stir
In my pitiful heart for those
That (not like thee) unavengéd die;
Glazed and dull is thy beady eye,
But still I can see in it something sly,
For Clara eats, but in turn thou rob'st her

Laughs at those claws of thine.
Of half of her night's repose. Evor.

OUR LORD HALDANE IN GERMANY.
[“I am credibly informed he went with a friend who by the cut of his beard was identified in Germany as being either the PRIME
MINISTER or myself.”—Sir Edward Grey in the House of Commons.]
Tuesday, June 4.—Curious how
through successive Parliaments, elected
under whatsoever circumstances, how-
soever affecting the fortunes of Party,
there is always a little group of Mem-
bers who constitute themselves a sort
of conduit pipe between disaffected
natives of India and the House of
Commons. Differing in name and
personal environment, they are singu-
larly alike. Well-meaning but not
wise; voluble rather than convincing.
No harm done in this country beyond
certain waste of time. Unfortunately
case different in India. Section of
native press which sets itself con-
tinuously to blow embers of unrest
takes care that this class of question is
reproduced in its columns, where it
looms large and serves purpose of in-
flaming wrath, occasionally leading to
lamentable outbreak of crime.
When DoN'T KEIR HARDIE returned
from visit to storied Ind, bringing with
him the reach-me-down suit of once
spotless linen, he made himself mouth-
piece of this group. Other interests
advertisement purposes, later claimed
his attention, and MACCALLUM Scott
stepped into the breach.
Up this afternoon to seize earliest op-
portunity of putting little conundrum to
UNDER-SECRETARY FoR INDIA. Wants
to know “how many out of the total
number of members of the district
board, talug boards, municipalities, and
union panchaits, in the districts of
Ganjam, were Uriyas [no allusion to
Heep) and how many were Telegus, in
the years 1903, 1909, and the present
year?” What may lurk under this
inquiry no one, except perhaps the guilty
UNDER-SECRETARY, knows. Be sure it
implies grave charge of maladministra-
tion on part of Government of India.
Whilst MACCALLUM SCOTT centres
his concern upon India the MAD
HATTER, after his pleasing fashion,
surveys mankind from China to Peru.
The world is his oyster, and day
after day through the Session he opens
it with the knife of interrogation.
Coming back refreshed by holiday,
he delights House with increased re-
More especially when viewed in profile
one feels sure he must have sat to
TENNIEL when he sketched the most
familiar of his fancy portraits. In his
inconsequential curiosity, in the con-
fidence of his assurance when laying
down propositions, and in his habit of
suddenly popping up and taking the
lead in conversation when no one is
thinking about him, he tends to rob
LEwis CARRoll of the originality
hitherto conceded to the creation of
one of Alice's most attractive com-
panions in Wonderland. Here in flesh
and blood is the man we were brought
up to believe was the joint fantasy of

To-day there are twenty-eight ques-
tions on the paper. Of these, seven, ex-

the name of the MAD HATTER. After

British Naval power in the Mediterra-

Government in connection with Miss
MALECKA; and NAPOLEoN B. HALDANE's
holiday descent upon Germany.
In connection with this last subject
he came a cropper that would have shut
up some men for at least an hour.
Inquired “whether Foreign SECRETARY
could make any statement regarding
the recent visit of Wiscount HALDANE
to Berlin.”
“Sorry I cannot,” Edward GREY
blandly responded, “since Wiscount
HALDANE has not recently been to
Berlin.”
Apart from this
HATTER's questions are models of
simplicity and directness. For more
than a week eyes of Europe have been
fixed upon PRIME MINISTER and FIRST
LoRD of ADMIRALTY in council with
KITCHENER at Malta. What their
business might be and what direction it
took are matters of persistent surmise.
Essential to success that proceedings
should be confidential. Secret well
kept. Not a whisper of authentic
information is floating about. "
This the MAD HATTER's opportunity.
Rises and, with artlessness that could
not be exceeded if he were asking some-
one on Treasury Bench to tell him “the
right time,” he enquires “whether the
FIRST LORD of THE ADMIRALTY can
state what measures are intended to
strengthen our naval power in the
Mediterranean 2"
Fact that FIRST Lord of ADMIRALTY
is himself on the Mediterranean, some-
what beyond earshot, makes no differ-
ence. The MAD HATTER puts his ques-
tion, gets his snub, and imperturbably
proceeds to ask FoEEIGN SECRETARY
“whether he is in a position to state
the result of recent negotiations aimed
at bringing to an end the war between
Turkey and Italy.”

How To Buy THINGs.
A BUSINESs.
EveRYONE ought to have some occu-
pation in life—we cannot all be in
the Civil Service—and the desire to
buy a business does credit to a man.
At the same time the greatest care
should be exercised—“Caveat emptor,”
as some witty Frenchman has re-
marked. (The English maxim, “Mind
your own business,” obviously does
not apply: you have not got one.)
When purchasing, try to think of a
business in which your previous ex-
perience, such as it is, may be of some
help to you, and not a hindrance.
Thus, if you have been a librarian,
you are not likely to make a good
dentist. Not for some time, anyway.
Very few members of the Stock
| Exchange—to make our meaning still
plainer—become first-rate tea-tasters;
and we have yet to hear of a curate who
has made bill-discounting pay. Some
| businesses are easy to buy, while others
are very difficult. Among the easy
ones are: growing things under glass,
| beauty parlours, and developing patents.
These are really absurdly easy. Ex-
amples of businesses which are difficult
to buy are: well-paid sinecures (other-
wise an excellent investment), a Gov-
ernorship of the Bank of England, or
the editorship of a London paper.
You will probably want a little private
influence to get one of these posts;
failing that, try an advertisement in
The Erchange and Mart. The careful
buyer will consider not only the busi-
ness but every other detail bearing upon
it before purchasing, such as its situa-
tion, for instance. The writer once knew
a man who bought a business that was
miles and miles away from the nearest
golf links. Of course he failed. This
only shows how people forget to take
the most obvious precautions when em-
barking upon a business career.
A BEDSTEAD.
Unless you live in Paris or follow
the occupation of a night editor, you
must sleep sometimes. In spite of all
that has been said to the contrary the
best appliance yet devised for meeting
this necessity is a bedstead. This has
always been the writer's view, and
always will be. It is true there is the
British Museum, but you cannot smoke
in that sanctuary. Beds are made in
endless variety nowadays, and it be-
hoves the careful buyer to exercise
discretion. If you are buying a bed
with the intention of sleeping in it
yourself, you cannot do better than get
a strong brass bedstead with mattress,
blankets, pillow, and all that sort of
sleeper, this kind of bed should last
you a long time. So much for your
own needs. But there are others to
be considered. For instance, you may
have a friend who comes to dine
sometimes, stays late, and misses his
last train home. For cases of this
sort the folding or emergency bed is
indicated. It stands in a corner all
day, and looks something like a box of
books; at night you unfold it, and it
looks something like a bed — near
enough for your purpose, anyway.
When the hour arrives, put your guest
into it, and retire to rest yourself;
sleep being the most precious boon
vouchsafed to mankind. If you have
any doubts about this, enquire of your
friend at breakfast: you will find, most
likely, that he has been thinking the
same thing himself for some time.
The chances are that he will never miss
his last train again; which shows how
important it is to buy the right kind
of bed.
A PostAL ORDER. -
Owing to the inelasticity of the Post
Office Regulations, there is very little
scope for the bargain-hunter in the
matter of postal orders. It is a case
of take it or leave it. Postal orders are
issued for amounts varying from six-
pence to a guinea. The cheapest ones
are used for newspaper competitions
and backing horses; the latter circulate
among the nobility and upper classes.
Buying a postal order is, of course, a
fairly simple process, yet a few words
may not come amiss. First of all, pro-
vide yourself with the necessary amount
of money, plus poundage, repair to the
nearest post-office, and address your-
self to the nearest young lady. She
will at once refer you to another young
lady, it is true; but you would not have
gained any time if you had gone to
this young lady first, because then
you would have been referred to the
other young lady. This is one of the
things that no fellow can understand.
Having pushed your money over the
counter, wait for your postal order.
Above all, do not tap on the counter; it
is excessively bad manners to interrupt
people when they are reading. Postal
orders represent cash, and it is as well
not to lose one, though, indeed, you
may protect yourself by writing “and
Coy.” across the face. Opinions differ
as to what can be done with an order
so marked ; persons who ought to
know say that nobody, except, per-
haps, the Archbishop of CANTERBURY,
can negotiate an order bearing
these words. The counterfoil, which
may invariably be found on the left-
hand side of the perforated line, is
another safeguard. It is full of good
when you have parted with the corpus
of the order. A friend of the writer
lost a postal order only last week and
he had not preserved the counterfoil :
however his impression is that the
number was H2SO4, or as near as
may be, and if this should meet the eye
of anyone who has such an order in
his possession, he will oblige by for-
warding same without delay.
THE CASE OF WULCAN MAGTAGGART.
IN my polite way I had permitted

THE ROMANCE OF THE
PRINCESS.
“THERE is no way out of it,” said
the King; “I wish there were, for your
sake.” I’ven the Queen, when the
Princess Seraphina had turned to her
for protection against this fearful, un-
expected blow, could only look sympa-
thetically at her daughter, and murmur
vague platitudes about duty. The poor
girl felt that her last hope was slipping
from her.
“After all,” said the King, “why un-
expected 2 As my only daughter and
a princess of the royal house of Zenda-
und-Wasser, you must have known
that this sort of thing was simply
bound to happen some time.”
“But to marry an entire stranger, in
whom I don't feel even the remotest
interest ' " sobbed the Princess.
“I did it,” said the Queen proudly.
The King coughed, and there was a
pause of embarrassment for several
minutes. In that pause Princess Sera-
phina bowed to the inevitable. She
inclined her head. “Wery well,” she
sighed brokenly, “it shall be as you
say.” -
So presently everybody about the
court, and soon afterwards everybody
in the capital and throughout all the
kingdom of Zenda-und-Wasser, knew
that the Princess Seraphina was to be
formally betrothed to H.R.H. Prince
Theobald of Thingumbobia during his
approaching visit.
But, as the approaching visit ap-
proached, the Princess found her own
distaste for the proposal increasing with
every hour. At last, on the very after-
noon before that on which the royal
suitor was to arrive, she could stand
the strain no longer. Anything, she
told herself, was better than inaction.
Her word was pledged, and for a prin-
cess of Zenda-und-Wasser there could
be no going back upon it; but at least
one half-day remained to her for liberty
and even—who knew 2–romance. Dis-
missing her attendants, she wandered
out into the home park alone. Ab-
sorbed in her gloomy reflections, she
hardly noticed where she was going; so
marked indeed was her abstraction, on
crossing a public avenue at some
distance from the palace, she was run
down, and had the narrowest shave of
being upset, by a strange young man
on a motor bicycle.
“I beg your pardon,” said the young
man; “I hope you are not hurt?"
The Princess also hoped she wasn't:
and on investigation both their hopes
turned out to be well-founded. She
told him so quite graciously, accom-
panying the words with a smile that
ings than almost any in Europe. To
herself she was wondering why the
young man (who was quite presentable
and even good-looking without his
goggles) did not recognise her and
appear more embarrassed. This, how-
ever, was partly accounted for by the
fact that he was obviously a foreigner.
So they got talking. To the Prin-
cess it seemed that in face of this tre-
mendous upheaval in her existence

Moreover, if she was

not to have a romance with a strange
young man then, she might never have
another chance. Anyhow, they sat
down together on a fallen tree by the
roadside, one thing led to another, and
| presently she found herself telling him
that she was among the most miserable
of mortals.
“That seems strange,” said the young
man, who was a very rapid goer, “for
you are certainly among the most
beautiful.” - :
“Yes,” answered the Princess, who
had been taught always to speak the
truth, even about herself. “I must
comfort myself by remembering that
in the royal pavilion to-morrow.”
“The royal pavilion " " echoed the
young man, looking a little startled.
“You mean the thing they are putting
up outside the railway-station?”
“Horrid, isn't it?” said the Princess.
“I have to welcome my future husband
in it at 12.30. Shall you happen to be
there 2''
She spoke carelessly, to disguise her
emotion. It was clear that the young
man was equally moved. He did not
meet her eyes. His whole manner had
altered. “Yes,” he said in a strange
voice, “as it happens I shall also be
there.”
“I am glad of that,” said the
Princess; and soon afterwards they
parted.
But for the Princess the memory of
the strange young man, as he came
round the corner on his motor-bicycle,
or later when he removed his goggles
and told her that she was beautiful,
remained to comfort her. Somehow
the thought that somewhere, obscure
and unrecognised in the crowd, he
would be watching her, helped her to
contemplate even the dreaded moment
when she would have to greet her
destined spouse beneath the rose-hung
canopy that had usurped the place of
the hotel omnibuses.
And now the moment had come.
Clad in a costume that was the very
last word of the court milliner, she
stood, the cynosure of every eye, in the
red carpeted space, round which were
grouped, at a respectful distance, all
Wasser. Behind these again came
the cinematographers and the special
correspondents twenty deep. Further
back were the troops, and lastly
the loyal populace, frenzied with
enthusiasm when they could see any-
thing, and with fury when they could
not.
Bang, bang went the guns, and at
the same instant the massed bands
crashed almost as one into the martial
strains of the Thingumbobian National
Anthem. Where was the young man of
the motor-bicycle? The Princess dared
not look up, though she felt rather
than saw that a figure resplendent
in dazzling uniform was advancing
towards her. It halted; the supreme
moment was at hand. Slowly, slowly
the Princess raised her eyes to the face
of this stranger who was to be her
husband, and saw—a stranger!
It was certainly the big surprise of
her life. That he was quite an amiable
stranger, with whom presently she fell
in love, and eventually lived happy ever
aſter, did little to mitigate the first
severity of the shock. It is recorded of
her, indeed, that she never afterwards
believed in short stories again.
As for the young man, who was an
assistant to the pavilion-contractor,
he saw nothing of all this, having
unexpectedly had to leave the capital
by an early train in order to superin-
tend another job. He laments to this
day his neglect to obtain the Princess's
autograph.
Thus we see that things are not
always what they seem about to be.

BLUE as a mile of pansies are the seas that circle the shores,
Circle the shores of Fairyland and the high, enchanted
ways
Where the great grim sea-green dragons guard the jade
and the amber doors,
And the Queen of the Fairies' peacocks walk under the
crimson mays;
Oh, what, I wonder,
Could look more gay
Than a peacock under
A crimson may ?
For that is the home of colour and many a wizard hue,
'Tis there they deck the rainbow ere he's pinned against
the rain,
And squeeze the tubes for the pictures of “things too good
to be true,”
And make the gilt for the turrets of castles we build in
Spain;
And what's more gilded,
This world amid,
Than castles builded
Near old Madrid 2
For we, we're all of us artists with plans and canvases
Of excellent Spanish castles with turrets all about,
With angels in the corners, romaunts, and symphonies
Of things as we would have them did every dream work
out;
And such were duller,
You'll understand,
If robbed of colour
So we must stroke the dragons and tickle their shiny scales,
And they shall grin politely and we shall pass along,
Where under the crimson may-trees the peacocks spread
their tails,
To dip our brushes in magic and echoes of fairy song;
And find us Fancy
Our daubs to deck,
With tints of pansy
And peacock's neck!

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It was Mr. BABoo JABERJEE, B.A., who held that Woman
loses in queenly dignity when she begins to turn cart-wheels
on the stage. I go further than my learned friend. To my
mind, she loses in queenly dignity when she masquerades
in male costume, even though her motive in so doing is to
be with the hero in his hour of danger. To others it may
be thrilling, but to me it always smacks of pantomime.
Thus, when Nini Auroy, in Mr. S. R. CRoCKETT's Anne of
the Barricades (Hodder AND Stoughton), donned a military
uniform and joined Jean de Larsac in Paris, whither he
had been sent by M. THIERs to spy out the weaknesses of
the Communists, I was sorry. Charming as she was, I did
not need her then, being quite satisfied to concentrate
myself exclusively on Jean. The adventures of this gallant
general of artillery are set forth in Mr. CRoCKETT's best
manner. That extraordinary farce-tragedy, the career of
the Commune, could never be uninteresting, and Mr.
CRock ETT has found it - -

of poor Fanny's nocturnal river-party, which, from her
wrong assortment of couples, became, instead of a romantic
serenade in the moonlight, a wild race between two mutually
jealous and suspicious oarsmen. But the whole book is
capital fun, and, before its happy ending, will have made
for you six jolly new friends, from whom, despite their pig-
headedness, you will have no desire whatever to be saved.
On the title-page of The Cost of It (HEINEMANN) ELEANor
MoRDAUNT quotes from Ezekiel xviii. 2: “The fathers have
eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.”
As the plot of the story deals with Harry Mostyn's return
to his mother and his mother's people (she was of partially
black blood, and had been deserted by her husband) and
his successful treatment of a sugar-plantation on the island
of “Monterracine,” and, as everywhere the shifty and un-
pleasant traits of the “whitey-browns” are insisted upon, I

the novel would be yet

a brother-and-sister friendship, and created Nini to supply
the love interest. The result is a story less powerful than
it might have been, but still full of drama and giving a
very clear picture of those troubled times.
The only thing that I do not like very much about Save
us from our Friends (GREENING) is the title, which seems
cumbersome, though it is certainly expressive of this excel-
lently entertaining story. Mr. WILLIAM CAINE dedicates
it “to any matchmaker,” and one can only hope that its
lesson and warning may be taken to heart by all such well-
meaning but often devastating persons. The awful example
here is one Fanny Barendale, who, because she was happily
married herself and had a passion for string-pulling, nearly
succeeded in playing ducks and drakes with the lives of the
four people whom she and her complacent husband had
brought to share their holiday at Trou-les-Dunes. The
trouble was that Fanny, misunderstanding the facts, would
try to pair off the right duck with the wrong drake.
Hence general vexation of spirit; and incidentally, through
the craft of Mr. CAINE, a comedy of baffled courtship that
is as amusing as anything I have read on the subject this
great while. It is all light as foam, but so deftly treated
happy, so that I am still painfully wondering what exactly
“the cost of it” is. For the rest the book is remarkable
for a very painstaking and obviously truthful account of
the industries, population and customs of the island of
Monterracine, and for the curious incident of Major Burston,
who is described as an Etonian and a good rider and shot.
This gentleman, whilst attempting to escape with his fiancée
from a native riot, allowed her to fall off the back of a cart,
and left her to the mercy of their pursuers. I clenched my
hands tightly, shut both eyes and opened my mouth, but
somehow I failed to swallow this. If only however for the
tints of its exotic colouring, I can recommend The Cost of
It, which, after all, is merely, I suppose, six shillings.

THE EDUCATION OF JOHN.
- (By one of the Educators.)
WE girls are having a great deal of anxiety about time
education of John. He is now five years old and a big boy
for his age, and it is time he began to learn something so
as to be able to hold up his head in the society of his
equals and to earn his living when the time comes. I took
that from a book called “First Steps on the Path to Know-
ledge” which Dad had thrown on the floor when he was
reading it. I read this bit to Dad, but he said he would be
quite satisfied if John could hold his own and punch the
other chap's head; and Mum said Hush, he mustn't put
ideas in the children's heads. When we told Dad that we
had decided to begin John's education, he said, “I)on't
worry the boy; his troubles will come quite soon enough
anyhow;” and then we told Dad the story about the boy
who could talk Greek when he was four and turned into
a wonderful philosopher, and Dad said if we made John a
philosopher he'd cut him off with a shilling. I'm afraid
Dad doesn't feel much interest in education, and it's very
difficult to get him to take a serious view of life.
However, Rosie and Peggy and I were quite firm about
it, and we settled to make a start on the first wet afternoon,
which was last Tuesday. We promised John a piece of
chocolate if he was good and paid attention, and he said he
would if he liked the game. Then we put some writing-
paper and pencils and blotting-paper on the nursery table,
which looked very well. I sat at the middle of the table,
with Rosie on one side of me and Peggy on the other, and
John was opposite. I had a ruler in my hand. . . . ;
Well, we began with the alphabet. We did it two letters
at a time, and John said them after me beautifully for a
long time. He got half the chocolate when we finished
O P. This seemed to make him full of mischief, and when
I said Q R, he said, “No, I aren't,” and looked round and
laughed. Rosie laughed too, but I said, “Silence, silence,”
and then I tried again, but again he said, “No, I aren't.”
Then Peggy did a dreadful thing. She said I had got it
wrong, for she was sure Q came before P, because Q was
just like O with a tail to it, and therefore Q must come
directly after O. Rosie and I tried to show her quite
kindly how ignorant and stupid she was, but she got
offended and said we were bad teachers and she would
have nothing to do with us. Then she took her helmet and
went out of the room to play ambushes. ... We heard her for
a long time in the passage capturing convoys and giving
their swords back to the enemy's generals after they had
surrendered to her. - -
After this John said he'd had enough of alphabets, so we
gave him a little bit more of the chocolate and tried him
with the commercial geography of Australia. , Rosie read
him bits out of one of our books, and when she had finished
I said I would examine him to see if he'd been attending.
So I said, “Now, John, will you please tell me what are the
principal exports of Australia?" What he ought to have
said was “wool and frozen meat and timber and hides,”
and things like that. But what he did say was, “Julia,”
which is the name of his nurse—she wasn't in the room—
and he said it in a loud singing voice. I said, “Nonsense,
John, don't be absurd. If you can't tell me the products,
will you give me the names of the chief Australian ports 2'"
and John said in the same voice, “James and Henry,”
which are the names of the butler and the footman. Then
he gave a loud yell and scrambled up on to the table and
crumpled all the writing-paper, and last of all he got hold
of the rest of the piece of chocolate and ate it up. He
wasn't laughing; he kept his face quite serious all the time;
For paper used for threatening letters! O. S.
but Rosie nearly burst herself with trying not to laugh,

John hasn't made much progress.
I have quite forgotten to say that John is pretty good at
French, but he doesn't learn it in regular sit-down lessons.
Mademo.selle Bertha comes every morning at 10 o'clock,
and she and John walk in the garden for an hour when it's

a bush once in the holidays when they were out together
and I heard him chattering away like anything. He can
say a little French prayer too, and he doesn't seem to mind
our hearing that. Last night he asked us to come into his
room to hear him say it, and just as he knelt up in his
bed with his face to the wall and put his fat little hands
together Aunt Mary crept in very quietly to listen, and
John said it very prettily from beginning to end. This
is it —

When he had finished, I said, “He hasn't made a single

crept out of the room just as quietly as she came in. -

THE CIVIL SERVICE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am a mild man, but even a
worm will turn. -
My wife was reading Punch last might, when suddenly
she ceased to laugh and burst into tears. On inquiry I
found in an article an insinuation that Civil Servants do
no work.
Now I, dear old chap, have the misfortune to be a Civil
Servant. " It may be that your joke has some foundation
in one or two branches of the Service, but, alas! not in
mine. I have often sighed of late years for a comparatively
restſul job, such as that of an author or an editor, but it
is now too late to change.
I belong, you see, to the Customs and Excise Depart-
ment, and my official hours, approved by the heads of my
department and LLOYD GEORGE, are from about 6 A.M. to
11 P.M. It is true I have the rest of the day to myself;
but it isn't so very much, is it? especially as I have to
work on Sundays as well, in order to get through arrears.
It is really our own fault, of course; we are such willing
fellows and so adaptable. No matter what Act of Parlia-
ment comes along, our department, being spread about over
the country, gets, it all, or a share of it. Consequently,
having to administer Acts, or parts of Acts, relating to
licences, brewers, clubs, old age pensions, motor spirit,
could find space to print it in its entirety I shall know
only a few), and now getting a part of the Insurance Bill
added, we really do a little. I may mention incidentally
that the baby, aged two, doesn't know me, having seen me
only once or twice during her existence, while I am in-
formed that my son, aged six, a short time ago invited
his mother to give him some particulars about “that man
who lives with us.” Of course, old man, you couldn’t be
expected to know this, but you will understand how my
wife felt about it.
Perhaps in future you could see your way clear to
appoint a sub-editor to keep a special look-out for Civil
Service jokes, and then put an asterisk, with a foot-note,
and a word of explanation about the Customs and Excise 2
If you could, I'm sure all our fellows will be very grateful.
Meanwhile I shall not, of course, withdraw my subscription,
as our acquaintance is too long-standing to be severed by
a little omission on your part.

ROOSEVELT DAY BY DAY.
OystER BAY, Thursday.—Mr. Roose-
vel.T has announced to-day, through
Judge Tinkler, of Ephesus, Me., that
he is in favour of infant suffrage, and
that the platform which he will submit
to the Chicago Convention will contain
an absolutely unreserved declaration to
that effect. - ... "
Judge Tinkler, in communicating
the above statement, added that Mr.
Roosevel.T had been induced to take
this definite stand by what Lord
Avebury had written on “The Child is
Father of the Man.” Feeling as he
did like a two-year-old, he was con-
vinced that an immeasurable advantage
to the country would be gained by
placing the ballot in the hands of
babies.
OYSTER BAY, FI iday.—Mr. Roose-
vel.T has intimated through General
Biffer, of Utica, Pa., that he is in favour
of imposing a super-tax on all golfers.

above statement, added that Mr. Roose-

globe three times running. He was
convinced by this experience that the
moral tone of the country would gain
in uplift by penalising indulgence in
a pastime which was so provocative of
objurgation.
OYSTER BAY, Saturday.—Mr. Roose-
vºlt has authorised Colonel Nahum
Quiddle, of Smyrna, Mo., to announce
that he is in favour of a grant to supply
all the public schools in the United
States with free chewing gum.
Colonel Quiddle went on to explain
that Mr. Roosevelt had been prompted
to take this momentous step by his
studies in anthropology, which proved
that only those races which system-
atically exercised their jaws had left
their mark on the world's history. It
should be the ambition of every true
American to be able to say that he had
never bitten off more than he could
chew.
Oyster BAY, Sunday.—Mr. Roose-
veLT has commissioned Bishop Hiram
P. Blott, of Damascus, N.J., to state
that he is in favour of a State subsidy
a suitable sum to contribute to the
weekly collections in church or chapel.
Bishop Blot added that Mr. Roose-
velt had been moved to this declara-
tion by his own experiences in carly
youth, when on more than one occasion
he had been reduced to placing buttons
in the bag. He was fully convinced
that the country would gain in self-
respect by the removal of such humili-
ating temptations.
OYSTER BAY, Monday.—Mr. Otis
Conger, of Snakesville, Ga., has been
empowered by Mr. Roosevelt to state
that he (Mr. Roosevelt) is in favour
of non-contributory pensions of five
dollars a week for all boys and girls
between the ages of eight and eighteen.
Mr. Conger, in conveying the above
announcement, made it clear that Mr.
Roosev ELT had been induced to take
this definite stand by the representa-
tions of his son IXERMit. “When I
had no pocket-money,” he told his
father, “there was no crime of which
I felt myself incapable.” Mr. Roose-
veLT is dead sure that the supplying of
this long-felt want will add electrifying

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JUNE 19, 1912.
THE BEWILDERER.
SoMEHow I always have shopping
to do in the village. If it isn't a ball
of string or a pencil or a postal order
for one-and-six, it is pretty sure to
be a shoe-horn, stamps, vaseline or
shaving soap. I suppose I never get
my stuff in sufficient quantities; it
can't be right that I should spend so
great a part of my time buying footling
little things like these.
However, I don't really mind buying
things; what I do object to is having
the weather expounded to me at length
in every shop in succession. I wish
they would leave it alone. The only
way to be happy in our climate is to
forget about it. I have tried cordially
agreeing with them — but that only
eggs them on. I have tried flatly
contradicting them –– a policy which
must have borne fruit in time, had I
not found that it was making me
unpopular and therefore abandoned it.
Then I embarked upon a more subtle
method – a blend of the othor two—
calculated neither to irritate nor to
encourage, but rather to bewilder. And
here I found success.
I tried it on Mrs. Hughes (pencils)
first. She said it was a beautiful day,
wasn't it 2 . . . Nice to 'ave a look
at the sun again. . . . And 'ow warm
for the time of 'ear ! -
Yes, I replied, as if weighing my
words, it certainly was a beautiful
morning and very warm, oppressive
in leed; and yet—I paused—at the
same time there was something rather
bleak about it. Didn't Mrs. Hughes
think so 2 Raw, you know.
“Oh, yes,” Mrs. Hughes replied
unbushingly; “but there—what can
you expect?” -
Then I tried IKemp (nail-brushes).
He was still more ready to meet me
half-way, for when he had drawn at-
tention to the balmy nature of the
morning and I had retorted that I
fully agreed with him, but all the same
I hoped we should have no sleet, he
said he hoped so too, but that was the
danger. He then tried to change the
subject, but I wasn't finished with him
yet. I told him that I had found it

I am beginning to think that much
may be done by elaborating and ex-

enjoyed further successes. I was
travelling cne day alone in a third-
class coupé. I was determined to keep
the carriage to myself, partly because
I had my feet up, partly because I
wanted to smoke (and it was not a
smoker), but chiefly because I always
want to keep things to myself. I’very-
one does. At the first stop the huge
form of a woman with a massive basket
appeared in the open doorway and
began to heave itself on to the step.
I leant towards her. - -
“Excuse me," I said confidentially,
diffidently, “I suppose you didn't notice,
but as a matter of fact "--I waved my
hand in an explanatory manner—“this
is a coupé ! I am very sorry.”
“Oh, I beg your pardon, Sir," she
replied, and departed covered with

a dog.
“I look 'ere!" he shouted truculently,
as he came up to me brandishing a
stick. “Are you aware that this is
private property?”
I assumed my gentle, explanatory,
expostulatory voice, which always com-
mands attention.
“Yes, certainly," I said, “I know
very well that it is private property"—
and I smiled very sweetly upon him—
“but then I am a private individual.”
He looked at mesternly for a moment.

PUNCH, OR THE LON
DON CHARIVARI.
| THE LAST TEST.
"[An exercise in the manner of The Daily News
and Leader's genial “Rover."]
HAviNg a column or so to fill and
very little to say about the cricket that
is past, owing to rain having ruined so
many matches, let me go minutely into
the question of what is likely to happen
in the last Test Match, to be begun
several weeks hence, on August 19th.
The subject is peculiarly interesting
in that it is fraught with the glorious
uncertainty of the game; we cannot
know whether England or Australia
will be up or down on the rubber; we
cannot know what will be the exact
composition of either team; we cannot
know who will bat first or what the
wicket will be like. This makes specu-
lation a positive joy. If the wicket is
wet, it will probably play otherwise
than if it is hard. August often sees
a spell of hot weather, and this may
have the effect by the 19th of baking
the Oval. In that case the bat is likely
to beat the ball, for a while, at any rate.
But if the pitch had been heavily rained
upon, it would probably mean that the
ball would beat the bat.
In the event of heavy rain before the
match, C. B. FRY, had he a grain of
that ability which a captain ought to
own, but of which he has never yet
shown himself to be possessed, as I
liave so frequently found it my duty
to point out, would take into account
the merits both of W. C. SMITH and
º: On the other hand, were it
liard and did it seem likely to go on
being hard, even C. B. FRY, I take it,
cretinous Aztec though he be, could
hardly be unaware of what Hitch and
W. BREARLEY might effect for theside of
which he will be the incompetent head,
unless the Peckham Rye correspondents
of The Daily News and Leader have their
way and he is by that time kicked out.
I would not enter into the question
of C. B. FRY's hopeless incompetency
were it not that hostile criticism of
Test Match teams has become the first
duty of all conscientious cricket jour-
nalists. That the M.C.C. should have
deliberately selected C. B.FRY is nothing
to me. What is the M.C.C. 2 A mere
collection of so-called cricket experts'
who happen to have charge of the laws
of the game—nothing more. If I want
another captain, I shall say so, and
go on saying so and invite other persons
to say so, no matter how one's attitude
may prejudice the success of the team
by making bad blood.
To come to the batsmen, whether
Hobbs and RHoDEs go in first, or
whether C. B. FRY and R. H. Spoos ER,
remains to be seen. In either case the
I can accuse C. B. FRY of failing to
make runs on occasion, however gauche
and unattractive .he may be at the
wickets. If it is collared, then, when
the time comes for JEssop to go in, what
an aſternoon for the poor fieldsmen'
On the other hand, suppose that the
bowling is too good for England under
such a skipper, then everything will be
changed. HoRBs, of course, might
make a lot, and he might fail. The
same remark applies with almost equal
force to every one. If the Englishmen
put up only a poor total, Australia's
task will be comparatively light.
As to the Australians, there are good
bats among them, and BARDSLEY and
MACARTNEY have made runs in their
time. The question is, how many will
they make at the Oval? With such an
incompetent field as C. B. FRY, they
will, of course, score easily when the
ball goes in his direction; and BREARLEY
also is not a shining light in the field;
nor is P. F. WARNER, haloed saint
though I hold him to be in every other
walk of life. But of course HobBs will
be there, and R. H. Spoon ER, to save
runs in other places, and not even
C. B. FRY's baleful influence can make
every one a failure.
The match, then, may be—taking
everything into account and thoroughly
weighing pros and cons (and amateurs
and cons, if I may be permitted the (
jape)—an open affair, and as such let
me for the moment, having again done
my unpleasant duty, leave it.
ULSTER AND THE NONCON-
FORMIST PASSIVE RESISTANCE
LEAGUE.
AN ADVANCE REPORT.
(From “The British Weekly "
of April 1st, 1915.)
A HUGE crowd gathered at Blackfield's
Tabernacle last night for the special
meeting of the Passive Resistance
League. The venerable Dr. CLIFFord
occupied the chair. Amongst those on
the platform were the Rev. SILVESTER
HoRNE, M.P., Mr. CLAUDIUS CLEAR
(the eminent critic), the Rev. SILAs
HockING, the Rev. W. R. NicoLL, Dr.
GRUMP (of Chicago), Sir W. RoPERTSON
NicoLL, Dr. HoRTON, and the Editor of
The British Weekly.
Dr. CLIFFord said, “We are here
to-night with a twofold purpose—to
protest against the tyranny which robs
us of our goods, and to congratulate
the Government on its acquisition of
the assets of the Welsh Church. (Great
cheering.) We stand to-night, gentlemen,
with LUTHER – (cheers)—-with KNox
—(renewed cheers)—as representative
martyrs of the human race. We may be
batten on their monastic plunder—
(loud cheers)—but a time will come
when our influence will control the
Government of the country. The voice
of Blackfield's Tabernacle will not for
ever go unheeded. That great politician,
Sir W. Robertson NicoLL, is ever
fighting for our cause. The Rev. SILAs
HockING is pillorying our persecutors
in some of those masterpieces of fiction
which will be read even when CAINE is
forgotten. . The fiery words of Dr.
NicoLI, in England's pulpits will kindle
a conflagration in Nonconformist
hearts which will not easily be put
out. And the cutting pen of our dear
friend, CLAUDIUS CLEAR, will make the
Bishops writhe in their palaces.”
At this point a sensation was created
by the appearance in the audience of
Sir Edward CARSON, who said that as
a Passive Resister he wished to address
his sympathisers. - -
Dr. CLIFFord shed tears of emo-
tion on hearing this request. “I
knew,” he said, “that in time the
justice of our cause would appeal to
the noble heart of Sir Edward CARson.
We welcome him on our platform. We
take him to our hearts.” (Thunders of
applause.) :
Sir Edward CARson said, when the
cheering had subsided, “I am a Passive
Resister, almost an Active Resister.”
The Rev. SILAS HockING : “Shame!
Shall I kill my brother bailiff 2") “I
will pay no tax—(three cheers for Sir
Edward led by the Chairman)—levied
by a priest-ridden Government—(great
applause)—in Ireland." (Loud and
prolonged dissent.)
The Chairman: “Order, order. I
call upon Sir Edward to desist. His
views are in direct violation of the
fundamental principles of the Passive
Resistance League — that minorities
must rule, except in Wales and Ireland.
Sir W. RoRERTson NicoLI, will now
deliver his advertised address on ‘The
Pecuniary Advantages of Disendow-
ment to Nonconformists.'”
At the conclusion of the meeting
Dr. CLIF Ford was presented by the
editor of The Expositor on behalf of
the League with a copy of Fore's
Book of Martyrs (bound in vellum) and
a complete set (194 vols.) of the Rev.
SILAs HockING's novels (bound in calf).
Dr. CLIFFord was too much over-
come by very natural emotion to ac-
knowledge these gifts, but the Rev.
SILVESTER HoRNE, who responded on
his behalf, aroused the meeting to a
whirlwind of enthusiasm by the an-
nouncement that Dr. CLIFFORD had
promised to deliver a non-political
address at Blackfield's Tabernacle the
following Sunday on “The Insurance
bowling might be collared, for not even 'sneered at by the lordly CECILs as they
Bill and Tory Wreckers.”

VACUUM PARTIES.
A LADY “with small rooms and great
social ambitions” has just explained
(in The Daily Sketch of June 13) how
she manages to reconcile these incom-
patibilities. The feat is performed by
providing the guests with artistic pro-
grammes, a full list of dances, a buffet
with light refreshments, an elaborate
supper, and in fact everything but
floor-space. The men (or ladies, when
it happens to be a leap-year dance)
then choose their partners in the
ordinary fashion and proceed to sit out
the appointed time in the hall, on the
stairs or in various odd corners—and
“the guests are still clamouring for
more of such entertainments.”
Much can be done judiciously on
these lines. We know of one hostess
already who has issued invitations
to a Barmecide Dinner-party. M.
Escoffier has been consulted in the
composition of a menu of the most
quart d'heure is to be a scream of
delighted expectancy, and the choicest
products of (empty) paper-bag cookery
are to be discussed in proper debating-
society style by some of the most
accomplished diners-out in London.
As it is a “progressive” feast of reason,
the men will all move one place round
the table at the end of each imaginary
course, and thus secure a change of
partners and a little exercise. The
lights and flowers and other appoint-
ments will be a veritable dream, and
everything is to be replete—except the
invités—and they undoubtedly, after a
famous model, will “ask for more.”
Sir BEERBoHM TREE, in his next
Shaksperean Festival, proposes to play
Hamlet not only with the Ghost and
the name-part omitted, but with all the
other characters left out as well. He
thus calculates on giving the fullest en-
couragement to conversationalists who
like to gossip throughout a tragedy and
the more restless spirits who prefer to
With one long interval, these play-goers
should find the evening pass pleasantly
enough. The stage also will be thrown
into the stalls, and the seating capacity
of the theatre thus largely increased.
The audience should certainly be “clam-
ouring” for something at the end.
The next Test Match, without either
the Australians or South Africans, will
enable the English side to enjoy a well-
earned day off among the spectators
or in the luncheon department, to the
keen delight of cricket quidnuncs and
barrackers, who may be trusted to
make good any omissions. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[June 19, 1912.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MRs. ATHERTON has a rather startling if not very artistic
method of combining recent history with romance which
continually spurs forward the interest of the reader when it
is in danger of flagging. In Julia France and her Times
(MURRAY), although I am bound to suppose, for charity's
sake, that one of the principal characters in the book, who all
move in very high places, is fictitious, I am always getting
a nasty shock from sentences beginning in some such way
as “This was the first year of Lord Rosebery's Ministry,”
or “At the beginning of the South African War,” or “It is
possible that if Christabel Pankhurst, bred on suffrage as
she was,” after which the course of the romance is usually
broken for a lengthy disquisition on foreign or internal
politics. Julia France, who was born in the West Indies,
versity football team and was confessed for the best polo-
player that ever came to Phoenix Park, all in the course of
two short pages, and that just to make himself indubitably
worthy of the lady for whose hand he was lodging a claim.
Personally, I thought him much too deserving already and
would vastly have preferred a touch of naughtiness by way
of qualification for, at any rate, a human husband, the sort
that a girl would not mind living with after she had done
admiring. And lastly the lady herself: as soon as ever I
saw the name Didy (DUCRworth) on the cover, I knew
that this was the affectionate nickname of the Ideal Young
Person, whom I had got to adore before the author had
done with me. Yet somehow, and I cannot say why,
except that Mr. LIPSETT has a very pleasant way with him
and a sound point of view at the back of all his senti-
mentalism, I read the story with undeniable pleasure, and
will, on the strength of it, engage to read his next, if he for
was married at eighteen,
without having any say in
the matter, to the brother
and heir-presumptive of al
Duke (there are not very
many Dukes, you know),
and her husband
is de-
scribed as “one of the
most blatant roués in
Europe.” When he went
mad and was confined in
an asylum, Julia began to
live her own life, with the
aid partly of Oriental
mysticism and partly of
the Women's Suffrage
movement. She manages
to find her affinity however,
and (Harold France

a good story; but there
is one thing that she cannot do. She cannot make
English people talk. Harold France may have been the
most unmitigated blackguard who ever sullied the pages of
Debrett, but I cannot and will not believe that he meditated
thus on board his cruiser off the island of Nevis:—“Rippin'
Toppin! words too weak for a bit of all right like that.”
Too much sweetness cloys the tongue, and a conglomera-
tion of four heroes and one heroine needs a touch of salt to
make it palatable. Mr. E. R. Lipsett was so determined
that we should see absolute perfection in his five paragons
that he dared not allow even one of them to err in an off
moment; they were good all the time and so too good.
Their boisterous and bohemian humours did not deceive
me; these were only kind words in disguise. As for the
coarse language of Dr. O'Dowd (one “damn" in every fifty
words he ever spoke), it was the most obvious affectation,
devised, and vainly devised, to hide his sterling worth. And
the nobility of them all. Believe me, the hero of heroes
stopped a runaway horse, saved six lives, rescued an upset
dication. For my own
part, I liked those best that show her in an eerie
mood. Miss WILsoN has evidently a fine feeling for the
bogie world, and the traditions of Somerset give her ample
scope for its exercise. “The Week Before Christmas,” for
example, is excellent ghost-telling. As for the other and
quieter papers, delicate and pretty as they are, I am unable
to help thinking that there have been too many country-
books lately for this one to appeal to the general reader
with any special freshness. For the Somerset-born the case
is of course different. But, for others, sketches of rural life
and scene have to be quite exceptionally good to avoid the
danger of dulness. Otherwise they are apt to resemble an
album of photographs of places to which one has never
been, or of relations to whom one is not related. I do not
for a moment imply that Miss WILsoN's collection ap-
proaches this final horror; but I should like her next time
to write an entirely goblin book.

HOW TO SAVE CRICKET 4
WHAT is To BE DONE 2
WHO WILL DECIDE 2
WHILE Mr. Punch reserves his own
opinion as to the necessity of making
cricket more alluring and of the serious-
ness of the tragedy of the small at-
tendance at the Derbyshire v. Hamp-
shire match, he has had, in common
with the emotional editor of The Daily
Mail, such a mass of correspondence
on the subject that he cannot but
print a selection; first, however, in-
forming those of his readers who may
have missed the point of the attack
that the batsmen of England are on
their defence for daring to make any
but boundary hits, the bowlers for ever
sending down a maiden, and the players
generally for wasting time by changing
over, taking refreshment and begin-
ning at any hour after sunrise or
finishing before dark. In short, the
modern spirit condemns the game.
What then is to be done? Read and
See. -
A CAUTIOUs WETERAN.
SIR,-No one can yield to me in
admiration of the grand old game of
cricket; but I am with you in your
noble attempt to bring it into line with
the times. " I remember all the best
players—HARRIs, NYREN, LUMPY, LAM-
BERT, MYNN, PILCH-and not one of
them ever took a tea interval. Did
they play any the worse for it? No.
They played, if possible, better. It is
true that they did not always make a
big score, but that was not because of
any wish to disappoint the public or
bring cricket into disrepute (as with
players now), but purely on account
of a certain uncertainty in the game.
Yours, etc., CENTENARIAN.
DEductions For NoN-ScoriNG.
SIR,--It is not enough to stop the
tea interval, and begin earlier, and so
forth. Cricket must feel the knife if
it is to live. Fine the batsmen who do
not hit. Give them 2 for every single,
and 4 for every 2, and 8 for every
boundary; but if they let a ball go by
and do not score deduct 1 every time.
An umpire also should now and then
be burnt alive.
Yours, Root AND BRANCH.
To Riv AL THE CINEMA.
SIR,-In order to bring cricket up
to the high level of the cinema or a
music-hall as a spectacular entertain-
ment certain things must be done and
done quickly. First and foremost, all
tedious batsmen must be forcibly dis-
couraged, and the best way to do this
is to make a rule that every batsman
overs automatically ends his innings.
This simple if drastic measure would
instantly transform the game into pre-
cisely that eventſul spectacle which
the wise public wants, for there would
of necessity either be wickets or
boundaries, and what else interests
anybody nowadays, except a few
fossils in the pavilion ? -
Yours, &c., REForMER.
5 STUMPs AND 4 BAILs.
SIR,--The three-day match is un-
doubtedly a farce, and should be cur-
tailed. I suggest that the wicket
consist of 5 stumps and 4 bails;
this would give the bowler a better
chance, and at the same time test the
merits of the batsman to a greater
degree, besides providing more excite-
ment for the spectators.
The present system of double innings
should be abolished in favour of a
single innings for each side, and all
matches should be played on a Monday
or a Saturday and finished in one day.
By these means we may be able to
attract to our cricket matches crowds
similar to those that witness football
matches. ONE WHO KNows.
A FEw SIMPLE SUGGESTIONs.
SIR,-How to make cricket more ex-
citing 2 It is merely a question for the
younger bloods of the M.C.C. They
have but to draw up new laws. For
their guidance I suggest a few –
Extend the over to thirty balls; or
do away altogether with changing over
by placing the field in some position
of compromise suitable for both ends.
Still further time (so precious to a busy
public) might be saved if every bowler
were required to keep wicket and every
wicket-keeper to bowl.
Insist upon the next-man-in standing
by the umpire so as to be ready the
moment the previous wicket falls.
Or, in default of this, establish a motor-
car service between the pavilion and the
wicket. -
Enforce captains to give preference
to sloggers and black-list the patient
men.
Abolish the lunch and tea intervals.
Reduce the time between the innings

Exclude the Press.
The above suggestions, it will be ob-
served, do not interfere in any way

nings in any arbitrary way.

SIR,--I have been giving the ques-
attention, and I find from study of the
old records that it was for many years.
a great betting game, England being,
in spite of our national disapproval of
gambling, the happiest hunting-ground
in the world for all commission agents.
Would it not be a popular move to
bring wagering back to Lord's and thus
not only brighten the game and get it
nearer to that far more perfect pastime,
football, but have every seat filled 2.
Mere betting on one side or the other
would, of course, be too tame; but a
system by which each member of each
side was backed for this performance
or that could easily be worked out,
while there could be betting on the
averages, too, and the championship
table. : -
I will gladly give you any support in
my power to bring about this.
Yours, &c., Joe STRAIGHT.
Vevey, Switzerland.
Away witH THE UNCERTAINTY |
SIR,-One is always hearing parrot-
cries about the glorious uncertainty of
cricket. If the foolish persons who
used the phrase would only pause to
think for a moment they would see how
very far from glorious this is. So far
indeed that it is cricket's ruin. Why
are matches neglected 2 Why do
cricketers strain themselves to play
for keeps and get not a single hand?
Why are the coffers of the counties
impoverished? Entirely because of
this idiotic uncertainty. Make cricket
certain and you will see the difference.
Go to every length to ensure the
success of the popular men, and
spectators and money will again roll
in. It is quite simple. You advertise,
for example, that JEssop will make
100 on Wednesday aſternoon, and
you see that he does it. That is to
say, the bowlers will bowl right, the
fieldsmen will field right, and JEssop
(who is an honourable man) will hit .
right. Result: delight of every one
present and plenty of cash for the
club. Yours, &c., BUSINESS MAN.
THE BEST SUGGESTION.
SIR,--The best way to save cricket is
to abolish the M.C.C. and Mr. C. B. FRY
and things like that and put it all under
the management of a committee con-
sisting of Lord NorthcLIFFE, Mr. IMRE
KIRALFY, Mr. CHARLEs FROHMAN, Mr.
GEORGE Rob EY, Mr. PETER KEARY,
Mr. CHARLEs URBAN and Sir Joseph
Lyons. These would bring new life
into the effete pastime at once, and
every one would be pleased.
Yours, etc., PRACTICAL.

A GREAT QUESTION.
ON a placard last Friday morning
The Daily Mail asked, “Shall we give
up India?”
We believe this is the first occasion
on which our contemporary has asked
the advice of its readers as to the path
it should pursue. On all other matters
of high importance—horticulture, diet,
holiday resorts and servant problems—
it has chosen for itself the course to
take, and gently but firmly has gone
on its way.
We venture to hope that the readers
of The Daily Mail will properly appre-
ciate the compliment that is paid to
them. The compliment carries with it
an obligation–carefully and thought-
fully to give of their best in counsel.
The responsibility is vast; an ill-con-
sidered “Yes” may be fraught with
grave peril to our country and to the
dusky denizens of our Eastern empire.
There is the greatest danger of a false
step being taken, and we beg the readers
of The Daily Mail to consider well the
possible outcome of their advice before
proffering it.

imagine our contemporary somewhat
anxiously awaits. It is not impossible
that before long some other matter of
interest may divert the editorial atten-
tion from this Indian dilemma–and the
fate of that vast land, with its myriad
peoples, would then remain indefinitely
in the balance.
The plain question demands a plain
answer, given quickly. We trust that

THE RECOGNITION.
Scene—A first-class smoking compartment in a railway
carriage. There are four passengers, all of them
having got in at the last station five minutes ago.
One, a white-haired affable soldierly man, a Major
(retired), let us say, is sitting with his back to the
engine. The other three, who are friends, occupy
the opposite seats. They are reading newspapers
or chatting with one another. The Major is
observing them with interest.
First Passenger. They don't seem to be getting on with
their dock strike much.
Second Passenger. No; I always said they'd come to
grief, and a good job too.
First Passenger. I can't stand these agitators.
Second Passenger. Nor can I. They ought to be drowned.
[A pause.
Third Passenger. What's all this row about in America?
First Passenger. What row 2
Third Passenger. This row about Roosevel.T and TAFT.
First Passenger. Oh, the row about who's to be Presi-
dent. Yes, aren't they going it?
Third Passenger. Do you understand what they're all
up to?
First Passenger. No, I don't, and I don't suppose any-
body else does. All the same it's rather disgraceful.
Third Passenger. Yes, isn't it? [A pause.
The Major (genially to First Passenger, who has put
down his paper). Would you be kind enough to let me have
a look at your paper if you've quite done with it 2 Thank
you, you're very good, I'm sure. (More genially) Why,
bless my soul, you're—yes, I'm sure I'm right. I thought
I recognised you. What a strange thing meeting you
here! Only shows how small the world is. Now (still
genially, but with a hint of roguishness) I'll wager you
haven't the faintest idea who I am, eh? Don't recognise
me in the least, ha, ha. (He looks round at the other two
passengers, who regard him with an air of cold disapproval
and become absorbed in their newspapers.) Don't know me
a bit, do you now 2
First Passenger (sparring for wind). Well, upon my
honour, of course I remember your face quite well. I
thought I knew you as soon as I got in, but I couldn't
be quite sure. (Recklessly) It's a longish time since we
met, isn't it 2
The Major. Let me see. Yes. It must be quite two
years. We were travelling up together on this very line.
No, that's not it. I'm thinking of Blenkinsopp – you
know him, I think. Commands the second battalion now
—short grey moustache and a scar on his left cheek. We
were going up to interview those fellows at the War Office
—deuced scandalous affair, but, of course, they had to cry
off—ha, ha, ha!—after we'd put it to them straight. No,
it's a good three years since you and I met, and then it
was in rather a queer place—nothing wrong about it, of
course—ha, ha!—but a funny place, you know, for you and
me to meetin. But I see it's quite slipped out of your mind.
First Passenger. Oh dear no. On the contrary, it's
beginning to come back to me—your face, you know, I
remember it quite well. Always had a good memory for
faces; but I'm no good at names. Let me see, weren't

Now, I'll just give you a bit of a clue to help you along.
My first cousin, man of the name of Holworthy, was a
captain in the Navy—commanded the Minotaur on the
China station in 1904. Retired now ; spends most of his
First Passenger. My last uncle died in 1902.
The Major. That was the one. You remember Hol-
worthy, of course?
First Passenger. Ye-es. I do seem to remember somebody
with a name something like that. Wasn't he the chap who
went to Uganda 2–No, I'm sorry: my mistake. The man
I'm thinking of was called Bullock.
The Major. Ah, poor old Tom Bullock! What a good
fellow he was. I remember we went to the Derby together
in 1882—Shotover's year—and we both put our shirts on
him. Lord bless me, that's thirty years ago. How time
does fly!
First Passenger. I rather think my Bullock's name was
Dick—yes, I'm sure it was, Dick Brudenell Bullock, a man
of about thirty-five.
The Major. He'd be Tom's nephew. I know he had a
nephew or two. (The train begins to slacken down.) Ah,
well, here we are. I don't know when I've enjoyed a
journey so much. It's such a pleasure to find oneself
remembered.
First Passenger (murmuring). Delighted, I'm sure.
[The train pulls up at the Terminus.
The Major. Well, good-bye. I can't say how glad I am
to have met you again. I shall see Holworthy to-night,
and I’ll be sure to remember you to him.
First Passenger. Yes, do. Good-bye, good-bye. So glad
to have met you again. [They part.
Third Passenger. Who was the funny old cock?
First Passenger. I haven't got the vaguest. Never set
eyes on him before.
SONNET TO WILLIAM TAFT.
(In the manner of Mr. William Watson's sonnet to
Theodore Roosevelt.)
I SEE a mighty people driven daft
By the stentorian enemy of their peace;
Amidst them, most majestically obese,
Thou towerest like a mountain, massive TAFT,
Exuberantly rotund both fore and aft.
The fateful day draws on by slow degrees;
The ship of state is pooped by perilous seas;
And would'st thou steer once more that giant craft 2
Perhaps thou shalt and must But, if by guile
The lot should fall on bear-faced THEoDoRE,
Still shalt thou be thy nation's mammoth Smile
Which wakes the world to wonder. Nay thou 'rt
more :
Thou art the Cosmic bulge and overspill,
Thou art America, Brobdingnagian Bill!
“When I first used to write to Mr. Whitworth Wallis upon golfing
matters, I used to address him as Whitworth Wallace, Esq. That was
because I put him down as some descendant of the Northerner who
watched with interest the antics of a spider and went out to fashion
his life on the same principles."
“Golf Notes” in “The Birmingham Daily Mary.”
It is interesting to learn that WALLACE kept a pet spider
too. But no doubt after BRUCE had set the fashion every-
body did it.
“‘You really ought to see the Irish players,' gushed a would-be
enthusiast; ‘that play—what's his name—“The Cowboy of the Golden
West,” is fine !' He had evidently confused ‘The Girl of the Western
World' with ‘The Playboy of the Golden West.’”
Manchester Guardian.
It's a good story, but the pith of it is spoiled by the fact
that the writer has confused the two plays himself. But, at
time in Devonshire. Well, he and your uncle—
any rate, he can sympathise with the would-be enthusiast.

(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY
of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons,
Monday, June 17.—In
the dying moments of a
drear sitting, when all
was lost but the last 'bus
for Brixton, opportunity
suddenly, unexpectedly,
presented itself to the
MAD HATTER. As they
say in France, he seized
it by the hair. In ac-
cordance with Standing
Order debate and divi-
sion on New Reform
Bill concluded before 11
o'clock. There followed
procedure of running
through subsequent
Orders and the motion
for adjournment of the
House formally made
from Treasury Bench.
speak through available
time that remained,
knowing that at half-
past eleven deliverance
from awkward position
would come.
This not an idea born
in a brainy infant school.
Amidst tumult, voice
heard declaring that in
consideration of his ser-
vices on this occasion
the MAD HATTER's name
would appear “in next
Honours List.”
Another paradoxically
accused the MAD HATTER
of being “a Bonnet.”
SPEAKER, asked to say
whether use of the op-
probrious term was in
order, oracularly re-
sponded, “It is a well-
known Parliamentary
expression.”
No less a person than
Hereupon it is open to
Members, subject to limi-
tation of time, to raise
debate on any topic under the sun.
When hands of clock touch half-past
eleven SPEAKER vanishes from Chair;
sitting automatically closes.
On motion for adjournment made
to-night, GRIFFITH-BoscAwFN, inter-
posing, accused HoME SECRETARY of
bolstering up case in favour of Welsh
Disestablishment by incorrectly citing
facts and figures relating to slum-work
in Cardiff. When he sat down all eyes
were turned upon McKENNA. He made
no sign of intention to respond. Here
was the MAD HATTER's chance. If
there was no one ready to take the
floor, why should not he? Had done
pretty well through the long evening.
At Question time made overtures to
Foreign Office for permission to inspect
documents in its charge relating to case
of Miss MALECKA. Worked off speech
on New Reform Bill illumined by at
least one remark that went to root of
matter.
“Mr. SPEAKER,” he said, “this Bill
might be improved.”
Forgetful of this priceless contribu-
tion to debate, Housegreeted his freshin-
terposition with howl of execration that
made the blood curdle. “McKENNA

MAD HATTER regarded them with in-
effable serenity. Pink of courtesy, he
felt some explanation of his appearance
on scene was due.

to dignitary in the Chair, “did not call

had suborned the MAD HATTER, cun-

A TRUCULENT MAN OF WAR.
ALFRED LYTTELTon di-
rectly accused HoME
SECRETARY of sheltering
himself behind the MAD HATTER.
This too much for McKENNA, who
appealed to SPEAKER to say whether
it was in order to accuse him of
sheltering behind another Member.
SPEAKER thought phrase was not un-
parliamentary. Amid storm of Oppo-
sition cheering he confessed he had not
understood why HoME SECRETARY had
not immediately followed GRIFFITH-
BoscAwFN.
“The honourable gentleman now in
possession of the House,” he added,
glancing towards the MAD HATTER, in
nocent creator of the turmoil, “admits
he has not got a speech ready, and
therefore I do not see what the object
of his rising was.”
SPEAKER's knowledge covers wide
range. Evidently doesn't know his
MAD HATTER.
Thus adjured, HoME SECRETARY rose
to explain; was engaged upon task
when, at half-past eleven, House ad-
journed. MAD HATTER went off with
the rest, musing on proceedings.
“I think I put them right,” he mod-
estly said to himself. “What I don't
understand is SPEAKER's remark that
he did not see why I got up to speak
since I admitted I had no speech ready.
If he means that when a man has
nothing to say he must not get up to
deliver a speech he strikes at the
heart of system of Parliamentary de-
bate. Shall put down question on
subject for to-morrow.”

Bill. Government majority bigger than
ever. Of course it does not represent
acquiescence in the Bill. Merely sup-
plies necessary authority for printing it.
Tuesday.—Proceedings with Home
Rule Bill as far as they have gone
differ a little ludicrously from what
was anticipated. Remembering threats
uttered elsewhere by GENERAL CARSON,
K.C., the MINATORY MooRE and the
CRUSADING CRAIG, people reasonably
expected that as soon as Committee
got to work there would not only be
wigs on the green but heads, arms,
peradventure here and there a leg. Up
to now debate even decorously dull.
Ulster felt that something must be
done to justify big words spoken and
written outside.
Opportunity presented itself when
PREMIER moved closure on amendment
which that truculent man of war, AGAR-
RoBARTEs, had with mailed fist tabled.
Old familiar cry, “Gag, Gag ' " raised.
House cleared for division. McNEILL
(not Swift) proposed to continue de-
bate. Upstanding, he shouted some-
thing inaudible amid tumultuous cries
of “Order!” CHAIRMAN of CoMMITTEEs
also on his feet. Disorder increased
and maintained by persistent cries
of “Order!” CHAIRMAN reminded
McNEILL that, the question having been
put and division called, if he desired to
address the Chair he must do so seated
with his hat on.
Hint promptly taken by the MARTIAL
MooRE.
“Has the question been put 2" he
artlessly inquired from under brim of
his hat. “I did not hear it.”
By this time McNEILL had learned
his lesson. Seated with somebody's hat
on, he cried aloud on the CHAIRMAN.
Wanted to know whether it was not
his (the CHAIRMAN's) duty to preserve
order? A pertinent question this for
Member with whom CHAIRMAN had for
some minutes been wrestling in attempt
to make him observe elementary rule
of order. CHAIRMAN responded by
putting the question of closure, and the
mob, laughing, shouting, gesticulating,
moved off to Division Lobby.
Another outburst of wild excitement
when they came back. AGAR-RobARTEs'
Amendment, insisting on partition of
Ireland by exclusion of four counties
from operation of proposed Act, was
negatived by majority of 69. This
sufficed. It was 29 more than majority
by which GLADSTONE piloted his second
Home Rule Bill through the Commons.
But it was 33 less than majority which
the other day negatived Instruction to
split the Bill in twain. Opposition,
accordingly, cheered itself hoarse.
Business done.—Amendment propos-
ing to exclude Counties Antrim, Armagh,
Down and Derry from Home Rule Bill
negatived by 320 votes against 251.
Friday.—SPEAKER's ruling that it
is not un-Parliamentary to accuse a
Member of acting as “a bonnet” con-
tinues to create surprise. According to
that monumental authority, A New
English Dictionary, “a bonnet " is an
exceedingly undesirable acquaintance.
He is variously defined as “a person used
to conceal or put a good face upon
underhand proceedings; a pretended
player at a gaming table or bidder at
an auction, secretly in league with the
proprietor or auctioneer to lure others
to play or buy ; a thimble-rigger's
accomplice; a decoy.”
Point of order raised, SPEAKER
promptly ruled that the taunt flung at
a Member was innocuous by precedent.
Reference greatly puzzled House.
SARK says it proves afresh the wide
and intimate knowledge of Parlia-
mentary incidents possessed by the
SPEAKER, his tenacious memory and
his readiness at critical moments.
“I suppose,” he adds, “there are not
a score of Members besides the SPEAKER
and myself who witnessed the scene
on which the ruling is based. It
happened on a day in April, 1885.
The Fourth Party were at height of
fame and power. Gentle STAFFORD
Northcote had for full four years
suffered sorely at hands of RAN-
DoDPH. On this particular night ques-
tion arose upon which RANDOLPH,
taking part in a lively turn of debate,
designedly or otherwise did something
to help Government over awkwardstile.
The proverbial worm will turn at last.
STAFFORD Northcote saw his chance
and seized it with readiness and vigour
that delighted crowded House. “My
noble friend,' he said, “is very adroit
and agile in the positions he has taken
up. But this is the first time I have
seen him perform the part of a bonnet
to the Government.' PEEL was in the
Chair in those days. Appealed to on
point of order, he declined to direct
NoFTHcote to withdraw the word.”
Business done.—Report stage con-
cluded of Bill qualifying clergymen to
sit on municipal corporations.
The Glasgow Touch.
“Mr. Cosh took exception to the proposal of
the Magistrates to give the Australian bowlers
an afternoon reception on the occasion of their
visit to Glasgow. He moved that the minute
be sent back for further consideration. Mr.
Alexander M'Clure seconded in order, he ex-
plained, that more adequate arrangements
might be made for the reception of the Aus.
tralians. Bailie MºMillan having explained
that the reception proposed meant only a cup
of tea, the minutes were almost unanimously
adopted."—Glasgow News.
Any comment on this would spoil its
simple beauty.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE AMAzoNs.”
I HAD not assisted at the original
production of this “farcical romance,”
and so it was fresh to me the other
night, or rather, perhaps, the freshness
was mostly on my side. For the athletic
female, whose advent, by the way, had
been hailed at a much earlier date by
DU MAURIER, is vieux jeu by now. And
yet, since she is still on her trial, Sir
ARTHUR PINERO's revival cannot mark
the full triumph of accomplished
prophecy (if that was what he was
after), as it might have done if the
theme had been the early promise of
one of those things, like the motor-car
or the monoplane, which by common
consent have “come to stay.”
THE SISTERS BELTURBET QUALIFYING
FOR THE HALLS.
Miss PAULINE CHASE, Miss PHYLLIs
NEILsoN-TERRY and Miss MARIE Löhr.
For all that, the reappearance of The
Amazons is welcome because it proves
to the new generation, and reminds the
old, that Sir ARTHUR was once capable
of innocent frivolity. For The Amazons,
though a little obvious after the first
blush (if the word may be used of a
trio of girls so blatantly masculine),
is at least free from those painful
social problems and that analysis of
obscure and ugly motives on which he
has insisted in his later work; and it
leaves no sour or pungent taste in the
mouth.
I except one feature in the play
which its author would have done well
to revise by the light of the change in
modern feeling. In these days, when
our neighbours across the water bid
fair to hold their own against us in
most games of skill and courage, his
sneers at French sportsmanship are
not only out of date, but, in view of our

cordial misunderstanding.
But what astonishes me most in
this reproduction is that the manage-
ment should have induced three ladies
as delectable as Miss NEILSON-TERRY,
Miss MARIE LöHR and Miss PAULINE
CIIASE to consent to make an exhibition
of themselves in modern male attire.
The disillusionment was most painful.
The particular feminine charm of Miss
MARIE LöHR was sacrificed to a more-
than-masculine horsiness, and with no
sort of compensation that I could dis-
cover. In the matter of resemblance
to the fighting heroines of antiquity,
Miss NEILsoN-TERRy was the only one
who made any pretence to this dis-
tinction. As for Miss PAULINE CHASE,
always so piquant a figure in the
sketchy costume of Peter Pan, here she
was rigged out in breaches and gaiters
for the purposes of a fishing expedition
(mitigated by incidental interludes on
the guitar) and seemed to me, in PHIL
MAY's words, to be the “smallest
giantess on record.”
The real fun of the play—and the
trance (on all fours) of Mr. WEEDON
GRossMITH as the Earl of Tureenwayes;
and whenever he was on the stage,
citing precedents from the traditional
behaviour of his ancient family, it was
impossible to be dull.
It is one of the many virtues of this
inimitable actor that he can always
afford—such is his reserve of strength
—to understate his case. I never feel
this about Mr. Dion Boucicault; but,
to do him justice, his Frenchman was
a part that demanded a more forcing
method, relying for its humorous effect
less on the thing said than on the
manner of saying it and on the right
gesture. And, anyhow, the character,
as I complained before, belongs to a
past age and needed much farcical
activity for its resurrection.
Physically, Miss ELLIs JEFFREYs

have said the same about the partridges
which, as I gathered, made it their pied-
d-terre instead of the usual stubble and
roots; but I would not think of setting
up my own experience against that of
Sir WING on a question of bird-life.
After a time the play began to re-
cognise itself for pure farce, and, quick-
ening in the last Act to a more
rollicking tempo, sent the large audience
away well satisfied with their entertain-
ment; reassured, too, of the charm of
their favourites by a brief final glimpse
of them in the habiliments proper to

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It will be a duller day when our retired diplomats
and proconsuls cease to give us the fruits of their
generous amateur culture in such volumes as A Tragedy in
Stone, and Other Papers, by Lord REDESDALE (LANE). The
author does not altogether disdain the friendly cliché, nor is
he free from that last infirmity of noble (and other) book-
makers, the reprinting of the respected addresses and
occasional papers of an earlier decade. “A Tragedy in
Stone” is a pleasantly discursive paper on the Tower of
London. Follow an address on LEONARDo; an inform-
ing “Apologia pro Horto Meo’’; and a slight but exceedingly
interesting summary of the history of paper. But readers
of Lord REDESDALE's earlier work (or of this in another
form) will turn with more zest to the papers on Japan
which form the larger half of the volume.

The conventionality of Mrs. STANLEY WRENch’s story, Pillars
of Smoke (LoNG), is relieved by her skilful handling of local
colour. She has an intimate knowledge of the Oxfordshire
peasant, and uses it to embellish what would otherwise
have been but a moderate story. The “loo-belling" episode
is very vivid. Loo-belling is a punishment which the
Oxfordshire village reserves for those who offend against its
not too rigid code of morals. It combines the more out-
standing points of burning-in-effigy and ducking-in-the-
horse-pond, together with those of one or two other rural
sports. The “Oxford Manner” seems to be less restrained
when you get out of the University centre into the villages.
To the making of certain kinds of books there should no
doubt be an end; but among these any volumes which
contain new light on that curious freakish painter of genius,
WHISTLER, could never be included. The latest Memoirs
of James McNeill Whistler (LANF) is by Mr. Thomas R.

“And who are we? Gentlemen, we are the great Consuming Middle Classes, the very marrow and backbone
of British Consumption. It is we who suffer most by these wanton disputes. It is not the idle rich, for they can
always afford to go and live abroad, where most of their money has already preceded them. It is not the so-called
working classes, for half of them, it seems, can afford to strike whenever the fancy takes them, and the other half looks
on without protest. We are the real sufferers, who are neither plutocrats nor proletariate, and we have suffered because
we have never proved our strength by combination. -
“Gentlemen, the time has come for us to form ourselves into a Union of our own—an Anti-Consumptive League,
sworn to go without luxuries and to adopt a minimum standard of necessities; to burn wood instead of coal; to walk
where once we travelled by train; to dress in woad who used to figure in tailor-made apparel; to forgo sea-borne
comestibles; to close our lips to the native charm of the succulent sausage. Thus only can we forcibly teach reason
to the truculence of Trade Unionism.
“And, if need be, we will go back to the land in a body and develop a Garden City with communal 'buses
and a communal hearse, where every man, sitting under his independent fig-tree, shall contribute his share toward
the production of the necessities of our common existence.
“So to the blast of their Socialism we will offer the counter-blast of our own '' (Loud applause, during which
the speaker resumed the floor of Trafalgar Square.)
It was at this point that an oldish gentleman of a suave but commanding exterior and with a slight excrescence
in the region of the superior spinal vertebrae, was seen to be swarming up the flank of one of the LANDSEER lions.
Arrived at his destination, and leaning gracefully upon the neck of the King of Beasts, he began to address the meeting.
“Fellow-workers,” he said—and his peculiar bonhomie at once commanded attention—“though I am not
actually prepared to strike in sympathy with your scheme—for the delicate nature of my work requires a more
generous sustenance than you propose to sanction—my heart is with you and my hump is at your disposal. In the
relatively primitive conditions which you are about to impose on yourselves, the sacrifice of carnal luxuries should
induce a craving for a compensative assortment of spiritual food. Not otherwise will each of you be in a position to
say, in the words of the poet, “My mind to me a kingdom is.’
“Here, in my hand, I hold what is probably the most nutritive mental pabulum that has ever been placed on the
market. It is for all tastes. I commend it to you without reservation.”
With that he raised aloft in air, so that all Trafalgar Square could see it, a tome of the most superb. Instantly
those who had made a conscientious study of Mr. Punch's half-yearly Epilogues (and they included all the best ||
examples of brain-power in that intelligent assembly) recognised the subject of his eulogy, and rightly concluded
that it was no other than his
Ønt jumbrel and forty-Stromb tolume.
