THE PRESENT-MINDED.
[“A telegram from Mannheim states that an
exciting incident occurred on Monday on the
Hammelburg exercise ground of the 2nd Bava-
rian Army Corps. During the manoeuvres the
5th Infantry Brigade came within the line of
fire of the artillery, who were practising with
live shell. The presence of iſ of the officers
in immediately withdrawing their men at the
double prevented any injuries.”—Central News.]
THAT the Germans do not stand
alone in the possession of this admir-
able quality is shown by the following
extracts from the daily and weekly
press:—
“What might have been a serious
bathing fatality was, on Wednesday
last, averted by the presence of mind
of Mr. Edgar Applebloom. This gen-
tleman, while bathing at the shallow
end of the local baths, lost his footing.
For some seconds his head was actually
below the water-line, but with great
promptitude he recovered his locus
standi, and thus avoided what might
have been an untimely death by drown-
ing. It is incidents such as this which
encourage us to believe that the history
of the Nation does not lie entirely in
the past."—The Stowford News.
“We beg to congratulate our old
friend Mr. Samuel Samuels Montagu
on his narrow escape from death last
week. While taking his usual after-
noon stroll on the golf links, he became
suddenly aware of loud and confused
shouts behind him. Glancing round,
he realised the presence of danger from
the excited gestures of some visitors to
the links. Mr. Montagu, with that
calmness which characterises the Anglo-
Saxon race, strolled quietly to one side
of the course. Within five seconds of
his reaching the foot-path a golf ball
landed with a thud on the very spot
where he had turned round. But for
his presence of mind in withdrawing
from the zone of danger he might con-
ceivably have been struck in a vital
part of the head.” — The Mudford
Advertiser.
“On Wednesday afternoon last a
resident of Stoneham was walking with
his small son in the fields close to the
Rockaby Quarry, when he observed a
thin column of smoke arising from a
part of the workings where blasting
operations were in progress. With
extraordinary presence of mind he
turned and walked in the opposite
direction, taking his little son with
him. Had he proceeded to examine
the operations at close quarters he
might well have shared the fate of
Professor Perie, who, as our readers
will remember, probed the source of a
similar smoke column with his walk-
ing-stick, last August, to obtain data
for his treatise on the Volcanic Origin
of Matter.”—The Rockaby Independent.
“It is not every day that one sees the Arch-
druid, but here he was in his glistening robes
of white and gold, his brow garlanded with a
wreath of oak leaves and a twining togue of
gold about his neck.”—Evening News.

DEAREst Daphne,—I don't know
whether you'll consider it joyful or
sorrowful news, but there's quite a
little feeling for pockets just now, the
tyranny of the hand-bag having got
almost unbearable. Of course, there
are several little things that we simply
must have tout prés or die on the spot.
Some people have special earrings, or
bracelets, or even rings, that will hold
a teeny-weeny puff, and so on; and the
handle of a parasol by day, and of a
fan by evening, will also hold things.
But a small yearning for pockets has
set in, and we've put it to Olga that
she must satisfy it, without in the very
least touching the outline of the skirt
or corsage. She oughtn't to find it
diffy. We've merely said to her,
“There are things that we must carry
and we won't carry, and you've got to
solve the problem "
Almost I find the chaperoning of
this Haviland boy too much for me.
It was just my absurd good nature
that made me take on the job of intro-
ducing him in town and piloting him
through the shallows. You see,
dearest, the poor boy has the misfor-
tune to be un bon parti, and my strong
sense of duty makes me do my level
to confound the politics and frustrate
the knavish tricks of Lady Manoeuvrer
and others of her kind. I really must
tell you how I got the silly boy out of
the Manoeuvrer camp. It was simply
too thrilling for words! Ever since he
came to town the Manoeuvrer woman
has meant him for one of her twins,
Marigold and Bluebell. As soon as
she thought things were nicely in
train, she gave a big boy-and-girl (with
a leavening of married boys and girls)
dance for the twins. The staircase
and dancing-rooms were all banked
with the twins' blooms, marigolds and
bluebells—in short, everything was done

The first valse after supper hadn't
long been over when my ingénu came
to me all in the downs and said, “Save
me, cousin Blanchel I've proposed to
one of the twins—Marigold, I think—
the one in yellow.”
“Silly, silly boy!” I said; “you
shouldn't have trusted yourself to

do for you. Who's your next part-

pose to her too ! There's safety in

that is how I saved him.
Call me a wretch, dearest, if it seems
good to you to do so, but I love to
think of the scene that followed at
Manoeuvrer House when everyone was
gone.
Lady M., her perpetual smile not yet
put away (Norty long since dubbed her
“the long-distance smiler”; but for all
that she's suspected of boxing the
twins' ears in camera sometimes'),
“you've something to tell me, haven't
ou?” Marigold owns up, and Blue-
bell weighs in with, “And I too have
something to tell mamma.” “Oh, my
darlings,” gurgles the Manoeuvrer
woman, taking a twin in each arm,
“am I really going to get rid of both
of you? Tell me the names of my
dear sons that will be.” And she
draws a twin up to each ear—and
hears the same name !
There's a marked coldness towards
me and my protégé in the M. quarter
now. The boy is most absurdly grate-
ful. “How can I thank you, sweet
cousin 2" he says fervently. “You've
saved me.” “Yes, I've certainly saved
your life—your single life, this time,”
I tell him.
Oh, my dear! such an affair at the
Middleshires'! You know what a
doggy woman Lala is, and what heaps
of championships she's carried off with
her kennel of Peky-pekies. You know,
too, that their boy, Toppingtowers,
has been what old-fashioned people
call a trouble to them; that's to say,
he has temperament and, since the
action for breach when Lil Lightfoot
of The Merriment got £15,000, he's
been in the limelight several times.
Well, one day last week, when Lala
was up to the eyes in dog-show busi-
ness, in walked Toppy with the head
kennel-maid in tow. “Sorry, mother,”
he said, “but this is Lady Topping-
towers. Been out and done it this
morning.” And Lala flew at him
and shook him till he went limp.
“You wretched, wretched boy ' " she
screamed. “You’ve robbed me of the
best kennel-maid I ever had. And
there's the big show next week, and
no one to see to Dee-dee and Du-du
and Sen-sen and Ti-ti, and I shall
lose all my championships' "
How charmingly distinctive shoes
are this summer, dearest ! Silk, satin,

all you must think out shoes of your

Clarges has hit on quite a nice black
day shoe made from the skins or shells,
whichever you call it, of black-beetles.
The cellars, kitchens and pantries of
their town house swarm with black-
beetles, and Beryl's given orders that
the servants are not to kill any of them,
for the shells must be taken off while
the creatures are alive or the shoes
won't have any style. The servants
are in a state of mutiny, and I hear
they're going to get one of the Labour
Members to ask a question in Parlia-
ment about it.
Talking of Parliament, chérie, Norty
made such a simply glorious fighting
speech in the House last night, oppos-
ing this Burglars' Indigestion Bill. It
arose, you know, out of the case of a
burglar who broke into some house in
the night, found the remains of supper
(boiled crab, among other things) on
the table, finished everything up, in-
cluding the boiled crab, was ill next
day, brought an action against the
person of the house, and got big
damages. The new Bill is to compel
householders, before going bye-bye,
to see that nothing indigestible is
left about that might disagree with
burglars!
Dear Stella Clackmannan gave the
last of her Garden Talks to the Anti-
banalites in the grounds of Clack-
mannan House yesterday. Her theme
has been Modern Banality; and while
we sat under the trees, had tea and
nibbled nicies, our President rubbed
it in, and told us how entirely and
utterly banal we are, in spite of our
efforts to be otherwise She told us to
avoid—as we would avoid something
that I forget—cleverness, for cleverness
was of all banal things the most banal;
and next to cleverness the worst thing
was to be in a hurry. In a wonderful
flow of most compelling words she said
that it was banal to talk and banal to
be silent, unless you kept silent in a
particular way. She said seeing and
hearing were banal senses—that we
must cultivate insight—that we must
look within-that we must compare
what never was with what never will
be—in short, the dear thing was quite
at the top of her form, and I never
heard her speak better. I took Norty
to the last Garden Talk, and asked him
afterwards what he thought of it, and
what impression he brought away. He
said he thought it capital, and that he
brought away the impression that it
was banal to be alive, and even a little
bit banal to be dead.

Fair Rereller (at carnival, to Major Blood, who prides himself on his home-grown moustache). “FANCY DREss, I PRESUME?”
THE BROWNING-BLAKE
MATINEE.
THE success of the KEAts-SHELLEY
matinée was so pronounced that no
time was lost in organising a sequel,
and the hot summer afternoon of last
Saturday could not have been better
spent than in the Beanmarket Theatre
listening to actors, actresses and society
ladies bringing their trained minds to
bear upon excerpts from the greatest
mystical and the greatest monodra-
matic poet of recent times. It was a
happy combination, for both began
with B, and the promoters are to be
warmly congratulated.
First, we had Miss ELLEN TERRY,
who recited selections from “Sordello”
with a beautiful bouquet in her hand.
It is true that she forgot the words
now and then, but her wonderful in-
stinct carried her through. Quite a
furore was also created by Miss CoNNIE
EDIss in a burlesque recitation entitled
“Pip-Pippa Passes,” delivered from the
front seat of a splendid Rapier-Joyce
Limousine; and Mr. WILLETT, of
Daylight Saving ſame, was much
applauded in “Morning's at Seven.”
A clever idea prefaced Mr. WILLARo's
recitation of “Waring.” When the
curtain rose, the famous actor (who
wore a brown suit, white slip and spats
and Homburg hat) was seen to be in
BERT WARING. Mr. WARING then sud-
denly left him. Mr. WILLARD, on
realising his absence, smote his brow
and made other signs of grief and
dismay, and then began the fine poem
which opens with the question,"What's
become of Waring 2 ” Nothing could
have been more dramatic, and Messrs.
HAMPTON and GILLow, who occupied
prominent seats in the stalls, were
much affected.
It is a question how far realism
ought to be carried on such occasions.
We have nothing but praise for Mr.
WILLARD's little device, but it is doubt-
ful if Mr. Forbes-Robertson was quite
wise in hiring from JAMRAch, as he did,
a live tiger, which he might invoke in
the lyric, “Tiger, tiger, burning bright.”
The more timid ladies among the
audience were visibly afraid, and the
effect of Mr. Forbes - RobertsoN's
beautiful voice was impaired by the
stampede to the doors, which only in-
creased when, in order to point the
phrase “burning bright,” the animal
(previously soaked in petrol) was ignited.
A charmingly naïve note was intro-
duced by Miss MARIE LöHR, who,
dressed as the dainties; “Little Bo-
Peep” imaginable, with a crook tied
with ribbons and the tiniest of high-
heeled shoes, gave a tripping rendering
of the lyric of “Little Lamb, who made
thee 2" with adorable gurgling laughs
“Wow, wow.”
Tor the rest, a poignant echo of the
Albert Hall meeting was to be heard
in “My Last Duchess,” as recited by
Miss HILDA TREVELYAN as Tweenie in
The Admirable Crichton.
The programme concluded with a
masque based upon BLAKE's long poem,
“Jerusalem,” performed by a number
of the most prominent hosts and
hostesses of the day, with a sprinkling
of Turf and Stock Exchange aristocracy.
“Standing on a table under a life-size por-
trait of himself in the costume of a hunter
standing over a lion just killed in a room in
the Congress Hotel, Mr. Roosevelt made a final
appeal to his followers to avert defeat and
domination.”—Daily Mirror.
Hard luck on the lion, who probably
thought he was safe in putting up at a
good hotel like that.
“Mascheroni’s ‘For all Eternity’ will appeal
to a wide audience, and enable many to enjoy
the wonderful singing of Caruso, to whom opera,
even in these days of musical culture, remains
unfamiliar."—Gramophone Advt.
Still, he must be getting to know some-
thing about it.
“His only bad hole going out was the ninth,
where he was lying badly in the rough from his
drive, and went from there with his niblick into
the pond, from which he lifted the hole, costing
him 6.”—Evening Standard.
The penalty for moving the hole is

THE CURSE OF CRICKET.
WooDEEY stepped out and leaned
against the ball, and it shot past cover
to the boundary. This is the sort of
cricket I can enjoy quite easily by my-
self, but the man on the bench below
was afraid I might be feeling lonely.
He turned round and introduced him-
self with the remark, “They're using
the long handle.” When a stranger
says that to you at Lord's, you know at
once that your day is spoilt. You can
get up and leave the ground, or you
can stay and talk to him; you can't
watch cricket any more.
“Yes, they're taking the long handle
to it this morning,” he said again.
“Why are they doing that 2 " I asked
innocently.
“They want to declare,
you see;

“This year, of course.”
“Oh ' " I tried hard to keep the
disappointment out of my voice, but I

“You'd never think a little chap like
that could hit the ball so hard,” he
went on. “It's timing, that's what it
is—all timing. Look at JEssop.”
“But I thought he wasn't playing.”
“Ah, and why isn't he? They never
ought to have left JEssop out. If I
were a selector, I should always say,
‘Give me JEssop, and then you can put
in who you like.’”
“Then I should put in Carruthers.

[JULY 3, 1912.
CHARIVARIA.
It is always dangerous to generalise
from particular instances. A foreigner
who visited London on ALEXANDRA
Day wrote home that Socialism has
made such strides over here that many
aristocratic ladies are reduced to sell-
ing flowers in the streets.
The ChancELLOR of the ExchEQUER
has allotted £500,000 of his surplus to
the development of cotton-growing in
British East Africa. As a consequence
he is now accused of cottoning to
Manchester. :: :::
It is stated that the new Electoral
Reform Bill “will not be seriously dealt
with in the current session.” The
phrase is ambiguous. It might simply
mean that this measure, like another
we could name, will be rushed through
without adequate opportunity for dis-
cussion. # 4.
Mr. Asquith believes that the better
opinion of the responsible Labour
leaders is against intimidation. If
this be so, it is a pity that the respon-
sible leaders—no doubt from motives
of modesty—are so shy of airing their
better opinions. . .
While in prison ToM MANN, it is said,
whiled away his time by knitting. In
spite of this we do not altogether credit
the rumour that he is about to give
up Labour agitation and open a little
Berlin wool shop.
Coming events cast their shadows
before them. The Daily News and
Leader publishes an advertisement
which shows that one person, at any
rate, intends to make a serious effort to
cope with the provisions of the Insur-
ance Act. We refer to the following
pathetic appeal:—
“WANTED–A RELIEF-STAMPER."
White mourning for widows, instead
of black, is the latest New York fash-
ion, and it is said to be so becoming
that nervous husbands are taking
special precautions.
::
Another postal improvement is an-
nounced. Reply-paid vouchers issued
in connection with inland telegrams
are now valid for twelve months, in-
stead of two, from the date of issue.
We all know how difficult it often is to
make one's answer clear within the
limit of twelve words, and the extra
ten months for cogitation will come as
a boon to many. . .
:::
the Secretary of the Navy in Mr.
Roosevelt's Cabinet, after breaking
off her engagement to a British officer,
has married her compatriot, Mr. FRANK
BRooks, of Detroit, and for doing this
the officiating minister at her wedding
described her as “the bravest girl in
the world.” This sounds like a doubt-
ful compliment to Mr. Brooks.
Headlines from The Irish Indepen-
dent of the 25th June :—
MENTAL DEFICIENCY BILL.
IRELAND's CLAIM to BE INCLUDED.
The nine-year-old pianist, SolomoN,
after his successful appearance at
Queen's Hall last week, received, in-
stead of the usual floral gift, a tricycle.
Artistes will welcome this innovation
so long as the heavier kind of tributes
are not flung on to the stage.
The proposal that, for the safety of
the public, taxicabs should be fitted up
with “cowcatchers” will, we under-
stand, not be objected to by the
chauffeurs if the contrivance be so
arranged as to throw the offending
pedestrian on to the top of the cab
so that a fee of twopence becomes due
from him. :: ::: - - -
To perpetuate the fame of living
Americans, Congress is being asked to
grant a charter to the newly-organised
National Institute of Arts and Letters.
A first list of “Immortals" has already
been drawn up, and it includes the
names of Mr. GEORGE ADE, author of
“Fables in Slang,” and Mr. Roosevelt.
It was obviously impossible to nominate
the one and not the other without justi-
fying a charge of unfairness.

more genuinely.

Undefeated, I dined with the
O'Malleys, and faced the inevitable.
Indeed, I rather led the daughter of
the house on. “How do you like
Milestones 2 " I asked right away.
“Enormously,” she said. “Do you?”
I am a man of peace, in thought,
word and deed, and deserve, I think,
more encouragement than I get. Even
now, when I was shown the agreeable
line and took it, I found that there was
no pleasing people.
“Enormously,” I said; and, since I
knew the lady for one of those who,
tiresomely enough, insist on downright
honesty, I added, ““Funny' isn't the
word. It is the most excruciating play
in London.”
“Our ideas of what is funny are dif-
ferent,” she answered coldly. “For
my part, I wept.”
W.
Even as next morning I came out
of the Theatre Ticket Office in Bond
Street I met Miss Goram, her of Sec-
tion I., again.
“How very lucky that I should meet
you,” I cried, “just when my opinion
happens to be in entire agreement with
your own.” I did not indicate the
topic, because my experience over the
week-end had led me to suppose that
there was only one.
“What about 2 " she asked.
“Why, Milestones, of course,” said
I; “the most pathetic play in London.”
| Apparently she too had had a busy
Sunday and it had tired her.
“I am sick to death of Milestones,”
she declared.
“Don’t tell me that it is the correct
thing to be sick of it,” said I, crest-
fallen, “at a moment when I have
at last booked myself to go and make
its acquaintance first-hand.”
MORE PASSIVE RESISTANCE.
A CLERICAL correspondent in The
Daily Chronicle of June 27 suggests
that the best way to combat the grow-
ing perils of London traffic would be
for a number of protesting pedestrians
to sit down in the middle of the road-
way of Putney Bridge. This promises
some fun or, at any rate, a lively after-
noon. For ourselves we have secured
the co-operation of the 80th South-West
London Boy Scouts and the “B”
Division of the Fulham Road-breakers
Corps and propose to go into camp
shortly in the middle of Hammer-
smith Broadway. First-aid displays
and Juggernaut gymkhanas will pro-
vide, it is expected, some pleasant
“NAH, the N, come Awyr, cAN'T YER
Y' Down't want To BUY ANYTHING To-Dye."
Nor are other busy and congested
centres to be neglected. A mass meet-
ing of bath chairs is to be held next
Tuesday at 6 P.M. on the deadliest
open space in town, viz., the north end
of Blackfriars Bridge and the streets
converging thereto. The vehicles will
line up at the appointed time from all
quarters of the metropolis and will
“order handles” and then stand easy,
presenting an unbroken front to all
other wheeled traffic. Simultaneously,
an al-fresco Mothers' Meeting, under
the joint patronage of Mrs. BURGWIN
and the LADY MAYORESS, is announced,
the venue being on the asphalted pave-
ment between the Bank and the Man-
sion House. At a given signal, bodies of
strapping matrons are to emerge from:
selves on carefully-tested camp stools
at the rallying - point, where, in due
course, tea and muffins will be handed
round. We are assured that their
solidity and vis inertia will prove
irresistible to the motor-buses of
Cheapside.
A posse several hundred strong of
the more intransigent Suffragettes, we
hear, are devoting themselves to the
congenial duty of holding up Piccadilly
in the neighbourhood of Hamilton
Place. They will all be chained to
each other and the railings on either
side, thus effectively stemming the
transit of “Generals” and taxi-cabs.
By these means we feel confident
that something will be done to safe-
guard the rights of foot-passengers in

Undefeated, I dined with the
O'Malleys, and faced the inevitable.
Indeed, I rather led the daughter of
the house on. “How do you like
Milestones 2 "I asked right away.
“Enormously,” she said. “Do you?”
I am a man of peace, in thought,
word and deed, and deserve, I think,
more encouragement than I get. Even
now, when I was shown the agreeable
line and took it, I found that there was
no pleasing people.
“Enormously,” I said; and, since I
knew the lady for one of those who,
tiresomely enough, insist on downright
honesty, I added, ““Funny' isn't the
word. It is the most excruciating play
in London.”
“Our ideas of what is funny are dif-
ferent,” she answered coldly. “For
my part, I wept.”

Even as next morning I came out
of the Theatre Ticket Office in Bond
Street I met Miss Goram, her of Sec-
tion I., again.
“How very lucky that I should meet
you,” I cried, “just when my opinion
happens to be in entire agreement with
your own.” I did not indicate the
topic, because my experience over the
week-end had led me to suppose that
there was only one.
“What about 2" she asked.
“Why, Milestones, of course,” said
I; “the most pathetic play in London.”
| Apparently she too had had a busy
Sunday and it had tired her.
“I am sick to death of Milestones,”
she declared.
“Don’t tell me that it is the correct
thing to be sick of it,” said I, crest-
fallen, “at a moment when I have
at last booked myself to go and make
its acquaintance first-hand.”
MORE PASSIVE RESISTANCE.
A clerical correspondent in The
Daily Chronicle of June 27 suggests
that the best way to combat the grow-
ing perils of London traffic would be
for a number of protesting pedestrians
to sit down in the middle of the road-
way of Putney Bridge. This promises
some fun or, at any rate, a lively after-
noon. For ourselves we have secured
the co-operation of the 80th South-West
London Boy Scouts and the “B”
Division of the Fulham Road-breakers
Corps and propose to go into camp
shortly in the middle of Hammer-
smith Broadway. First-aid displays

Tuesday at 6 P.M. on the deadliest
open space in town, viz., the north end
of Blackfriars Bridge and the streets
converging thereto. The vehicles will
line up at the appointed time from all
quarters of the metropolis and will
“order handles” and then stand easy,
presenting an unbroken front to all
other wheeled traffic. Simultaneously,
an al-fresco Mothers' Meeting, under
the joint patronage of Mrs. BURGwin

the venue being on the asphalted pave-

“ANN.”
You may have thought that a man
who leaps to sudden fame with a first
novel is certain to suffer from swelled
head. Then you were wrong. There
never lived a more naïvely simple
creature than the hero of the new
Criterion play; never one that showed
less sign of genius in the home-circle.
It may be that he was conscious of
having imposed on the public, like a
man I know who makes guide-books of
countries that he has never set, eyes
upon. For Edward Hargraves, aged 26,
had written a brilliant novel on the
theme of a honeymoon without ever
having kissed a woman in his life. The
defect had been recognised by a young
female critic who, herself unmarried,
must have had a natural flair for the
right honeymoon atmosphere. So
little, indeed, did the author know of the
arts which appeal to women that he
never even used hairwash, an omission
discovered by the same critic when, in
her métier of reporter, she penetrated
his flat by the fire-escape and inter-
viewed his bedroom.
A simple youth of 26
Who never greased his hair—
What should he know of Cupid's tricks
Or how to woo the fair :
This hiatus in his experience had
not escaped the fond eye of his mother
(played with a very charming sympathy
by Miss FAY DAvis). Though married to
a typical British clergyman, Mrs. Har-
graves must, I think, have had French
blood in her, for when the female critic
entered her boy's life (by way of the
fire-escape) and a scandal ensued, her
maternal mind did not discourage the
idea that his éducation sentimentale
might be promoted by other methods
than those of matrimony — methods
that could never have commended
themselves to the Very Rev. the Dean,
her husband.
However, the scandal, which had no
serious promise in it, since the youth
was ingenuous and the girl belonged
to a race whose indiscretions are so
amazingly compatible with virtue,
never went much beyond the exposure
of a night-dress; and all ended theo-
logically.
The English types, father, mother and
son, were all pleasantly recognisable,
but I confess I have no experience by
which to judge the character of Ann.
My intercourse with American female
reporters was always marked by an im-
personal detachment. None of them,
to my recollection, ever criticised my
night-wear or exhibited her own to my
fainting vision.
so fascinating as the author meant me
to find her. For one thing I dislike a
woman who knows much better than a
man—and volunteers to put him right
—on the question of what it is that he
really wants in a woman. I am put
off, too, by a female who takes her own
fascination as a matter of universal
consent. I have, again, an instinctive
prejudice against the type which im-
agines that the best way for a woman
to impress a man with a sense of
“true womanliness” (I think this was
the expression that Ann employed in
this terrible context) is to appear before
him in a night-dress with her hair
down. And, finally, I object to a

the interview can wait. Marry in haste, report
at leisure—that's my motto.”
woman who uses a pungent head-wash
at five dollars the bottle.
I must insist a little on the smell
that Ann wore on her hair, for it was a
leading feature in the development of
the play. Nostril after nostril was
lifted to inhale it. From Act to Act it
clung to the cushion against which
she had reposed. It vitiated the fidel-
ity of Edward to his betrothed; it broke
his cleanly habit of avoiding grease,
for he must needs get a bottle of it.
It may never, as I hope, have been a
real smell, but so strongly was it
imagined, so fiercely was it made to
dominate the moral atmosphere, that
it seemed to be waſted in heavy waves
across the auditorium, bringing some
of us to the very verge of nausea.
In the part of Ann, Miss RENFE
KELLY (U.S.A.) played very well indeed,
that the author asked her to do. The
invincible cocksureness of Ann; the
bloodlessness of her sentimentalism; the
prosaic quality in her treatment of the
romance of love as if it were a depart-
ment of cuisine—add sugar to taste,
stir quickly, cover with pink ice-cream,
and serve up in lace frills; her self-
satisfied amusement over everything
un-American ; her radiant confidence in
her own powers of fascination; her glib-
ness in using such an appalling phrase
as “high-class wild oats”; her casual
improprieties which could only have
one meaning in the case of an English
girl, but had none at all in hers—
they were all there, reproduced to the
life, if life is ever quite so deadly as
that. And I think it must be, for Miss
KELLY, if I may judge by the nerve
she showed on the stage, would hardly
have hesitated to correct the author's
notion of the type. But, right or
wrong, the type was very cleverly re-
produced, and, if I was not fascinated,
as I might have been by Miss IRIs
Hoey in the same part, I am free to
admit that Miss KELLY played with
the most abounding gaiety and vivaci-
ousness, and well deserved the good
reception that she got.
As for Mr. BASIL HALLAM as Edward,
I enjoyed almost every minute of him.
I liked his natural gaucherie; the stiff
leg that he kept for his long stride;
his gentle fatherliness when he said
“Dear old dad" to a parent scarcely
more innocent than himself; and his
altogether lovable simplicity of nature.
My only fear for such an Edward is
that wisdom may bring disenchantment.

FOLK-SONGS AND A SINGER.
If anybody, bent upon the performance of a genuinely
kind and considerate action, will undertake to sing folk-
songs and children's songs to me for the remainder of my
natural life, I for my part can promise a rapt and sym-
pathetic attention. I shall leave the brutal world to take
its way in the matter of problem plays. STRAUSS and the
rest of them, who are endeavouring to push WAGNER from
his stool, shall bang and blare and crash cacophonously to
their hearts' content so long as they do it far away from
me. I shall not “heed the rumble of a distant drum,” or
of any other instrument they may choose to employ. ... I can
even promise not to hear The Children of Don. I shall
not trouble myself about the present position and the
merits of English music as opposed to the audaciously
dumped continental varieties. All these and most other
matters I shall leave alone, for I shall have the children's
songs for simplicity and the folk-songs for that and for a
melancholy which, being most musical, ends by making
you cheerful almost in spite of yourself.
Not all folk-tunes, of course, are melancholy. The
German for the most part have a sweet and prattling
simplicity undisturbed by sadness, and there are in the
Scotch and Irish collections some rollicking and reckless
things which must not be forgotten. “The Road to Cork
Hill,” which, with a transformed tempo, is perhaps better
known as “Father O'Flynn,” is a shining example. But
when you get the note of sadness, the yearning on the part
of a defeated race for the glories that have been or the ideal
splendours that time may yet bring about, then you get the
true folk-tune.
And that brings me to negro songs, which are unassail-
able folk-songs, though the Africans and not the American
inhabitants of the country must have the credit of them.
Many years ago I found myself in the society of a company
of young Americans who were occupying a sort of camp on
a hill overlooking a mighty American river. All their
attendants were negroes from Boston, and in the summer
evenings, when dinner had been cleared away and the work
of the day was done, the black cook and the waiters used
to gather together in the open air and sing negro songs.
They were a chance collection of honest, smiling darkies,
but they took their parts and blended their voices as if they
had trained together for years. When they sang they were
transfigured ; their faces glowed with rapture as their
strains welled out in harmony, now sad and gentle, now
swelling to a passionate exultation, while the rest of us sat
round entranced by these bursts of unsophisticated melody.
Many songs have I heard since, but never any that touched
me more nearly. They were the songs of grown men, but
they made us feel that we were children exiled from home
and condemned to labour in a strange land, without a hope
of return. -
With these thoughts and memories in my mind I made
my way the other day to the Little Theatre, for I had heard
that the real thing in children's and negroes' songs was to
be heard there. The Little Theatre is snugly tucked away
in John Street, Adelphi, and the roar of the traffic of the
Strand hardly makes itself heard there. Inside the theatre
was a comfortably expectant audience, mostly composed of
ladies, and on the stage stood, not a bevy of negroes, but
Miss KITTY CHEATHAM, a vivacious little lady with sparkling
eyes, a pink silk dress, and the kindest and softest American
accent I ever heard. The way in which she purrs round
There can be no manner of doubt about it : Miss

at us, a universal smile was wafted back from us over the

about children, and then she chatted again, and the spell
was complete. When the interval came, I forgot all about
tea until the time was nearly spent. In answer to my tardy
summons, a polite young lady brought me a tea-tray with
cakes and I know not what beside, and laid it on my lap. I
poured from the dainty pot, and at that moment up went
the curtain, leaving me with a cooling cup of tea and all

had chatted learnedly and sung her black folk-songs de-

drink cold tea without minding it. Finally, Miss CHEATHAM
recited to music, and when she had thoroughly softened our

Miss BEATRICE HARRADEN has accomplished something
of a tour de force with Out of the wreck I rise (NELson)

has appropriated fifteen thousand pounds of dramatists'
royalties—this is to touch me on a tender spot. Neverthe-
less, just because Adrian Steele is a real character, and one
so well drawn, with the soul of goodness in his evil so
skilfully betrayed, you will be bound to follow his shifts
and dodges, up to the final tragic end, with extraordinary
interest. He alone would make the book an unusual
achievement. But there are also three other persons, the
three whose help and championship he half contemptuously
accepts and employs, who are as vital as himself. Two
of them are women who love him, Nell Silberthwaite,
the hard-working head of an anti-sweating society, and
Tamar Scott, a Jewess dealer in precious stones. The
mutual antagonism and jealousy between these two, who
are yet bound together in common servitude to the master,
Steele, are excellently shown. Different, and perhaps not
quite so good, is Richard Forest, the idealist vicar of a
Warwickshire parish. How his fortunes came to touch
you will enjoy the process. One thing I wanted to know,
however, upon which the book is silent. What happened
to the dramatists afterwards? Did they ever recover their

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FOLK-SONGS AND A SINGER.
If anybody, bent upon the performance of a genuinely
kind and considerate action, will undertake to sing folk-
songs and children's songs to me for the remainder of my
natural life, I for my part can promise a rapt and sym-
pathetic attention. I shall leave the brutal world to take
its way in the matter of problem plays. STRAUss and the
rest of them, who are endeavouring to push WAGNER from
his stool, shall bang and blare and crash cacophonously to
their hearts' content so long as they do it far away from
me. I shall not “heed the rumble of a distant drum,” or
of any other instrument they may choose to employ. - I can
even promise not to hear The Children of Don. I shall
not trouble myself about the present position and the
merits of English music as opposed to the audaciously
dumped continental varieties. All these and most other
matters I shall leave alone, for I shall have the children's
songs for simplicity and the folk-songs for that and for a
melancholy which, being most musical, ends by making
you cheerful almost in spite of yourself.
Not all folk-tunes, of course, are melancholy. The
German for the most part have a sweet and prattling
simplicity undisturbed by sadness, and there are in the
Scotch and Irish collections some rollicking and reckless
things which must not be forgotten. “The Road to Cork
Hill,” which, with a transformed tempo, is perhaps better
known as “Father O'Flynn,” is a shining example. But
when you get the note of sadness, the yearning on the part
of a defeated race for the glories that have been or the ideal
splendours that time may yet bring about, then you get the
true folk-tune.
And that brings me to negro songs, which are unassail-
able folk-songs, though the Africans and not the American
inhabitants of the country must have the credit of them.
Many years ago I found myself in the society of a company
of young Americans who were occupying a sort of camp on
a hill overlooking a mighty American river. All their
attendants were negroes from Boston, and in the summer
evenings, when dinner had been cleared away and the work
of the day was done, the black cook and the waiters used
to gather together in the open air and sing negro songs.
They were a chance collection of honest, smiling darkies,
but they took their parts and blended their voices as if they
had trained together for years. When they sang they were
transfigured ; their faces glowed with rapture as their
strains welled out in harmony, now sad and gentle, now
swelling to a passionate exultation, while the rest of us sat
round entranced by these bursts of unsophisticated melody.
Many songs have I heard since, but never any that touched
me more nearly. They were the songs of grown men, but
they made us feel that we were children exiled from home
and condemned to labour in a strange land, without a hope
of return. -
With these thoughts and memories in my mind I made
my way the other day to the Little Theatre, for I had heard
that the real thing in children's and negroes' songs was to
be heard there. The Little Theatre is snugly tucked away
in John Street, Adelphi, and the roar of the traffic of the
Strand hardly makes itself heard there. Inside the theatre
was a comfortably expectant audience, mostly composed of
ladies, and on the stage stood, not a bevy of negroes, but
Miss KITTY CHEATHAM, a vivacious little lady with sparkling
eyes, a pink silk dress, and the kindest and softest American
accent I ever heard. The way in which she purrs round
There can be no manner of doubt about it: Miss
CHEATHAM is “it’—I might almost say, “it "raised to the

at us, a universal ..i. wafted back from us over the

As being still a sportsman's game;
They know that players, when they're fairly beat,
Do not ignite the enemy's pavilion,
Dance on the umpire's face with spiky feet
Or paint the pitch vermilion.
And so with sport of any style—
Each has its rules by which we play;
We take our beating with a smile
In hope to win another day;
Thus, when we meet again in rival camps,
We may expect the foe, should we outscore 'em,
To bear their licking (though it be of stamps)
With similar decorum.
Yet, if the martyr-spirit still
Burns like a flame inside your maw,
I see a way to have your will
Without the lightest breach of law;
No free-born Briton can be brought to book
For Servants' Taxes if from off the scene ho
Discharge his retinue—from Jane (the cook)
To Josephine (the tweenie).
Then, when you call yourself at six
Responsive to the milkman's toots,
Polish the kitchen grate and fix
The blacking on the household's boots;
Now washing saucers by the pantry-sink,
Now chasing beetles when the night is stilly—
Each common task will give you joy to think

THE STORY OF ROBERT ;
or, THE SILVER LINING.
FAR off from here, I ween, there is a widow
In a grey by-street in a Northern town,
Named Smith or Jones, or Wilkinson or Prideaux
(One must have rhymes), struck down
By anguish, with an only son,
Her working days long past and done—
I say there must be such an one
Renting a small cot near The Rose and Crown,
A public, where her husband died of tippling,
A bad lot he, too prone to drink and sports;
And now the little son, the merest stripling,
His mother's age supports;
Someone who felt compassion's throb
Or liked the boy (I've called him Bob)
Found him, I feel convinced, a job,
Not a well-paid one, but a job of sorts.
They put the youth into a rubber factory,
And there his scanty wage made both ends meet,
Till this year, when the Fates got more refractory,
Through the high price of wheat
Or coals or what not; though they ate
Little enough, they fell in debt,
And so things were when, wild and wet,
June faded and July came robed in sleet.
And one grim morning (shall we dare bemoan us,
We whom so little fear of famine irks?)
The boy came back and shouted, “Hey! a bonus,
The manager came round to say

Five pounds to all of us this day;

And how that pair was saved.

Cricket at Lord's the swamps retard,
But joy wells up within the bard
In looking on that picture dream-engraved.

Speaks of our climate with an angry frown,
I tell to him the tale of Robert's mother
In that dark Northern town.

ALL (0R NEARLY ALL) THE STARS.
However much they enjoyed their
evening at the Palace on Monday,
July 1st, let not THEIR MAJESTIES rest
satisfied that they have seen a music-
hall, or that the variety stage now
withholds no secret from them; for it
is not so. They witnessed a remark-
able entertainment in a bower of roses,
and laughed consumedly at certain in-
dividuals; but they have not seen a
music-hall. Their only chance of so
doing is to be carefully disguised and
pay a surprise visit to one of the more
popular two-houses-a-night establish-
ments; and if ever they take this bold
step the odds are immense, judging by
royal predilections at the Palace, that
fell to him instantly, and HER MAJESTY
first of all. It is as well that this was
so, for RoPEY brought more of the real
spirit of the halls than anyone else into
the programme, and his triumph there-
fore may be called the justification of
the experiment. His success in the
royal box proves that the variety stage
has more to offer the Throne than the
Throne suspected; only a THACKERAY
could do justice to the impact of the
one GEORGE upon the regal OTHER.
None of the other true children of
the halls “bit” as Robey did. His
hard uncompromising challenging way,
almost as though he etched where
others draw with pencil and brush, his
profound behind-the-scenic air when
touching upon humanity's foibles, his
it; but these sidelong thrusts at him-
self, which ordinarily would have re-
joiced the house, here, among so many
aliens from high places, did not carry.
It was Robey's triumph that he
made everything carry—word, gesture
and expression. Not in any hall in
England, however packed with the ne-
cessitous, could a more instant volume
of laughter have followed his sally
about the attentions of his aristocratic
friend, Count Rendered, than went
up from the plutocratic occupants
of stalls at ten guineas apiece: a cir-
cumstance for the comedian to add to
his already remarkable collection of
sidelights on life.

until that adventure is

to ruminate upon in the
memory of what di-
versity of talent can go
to make up a score or
so of British subjects.
Always excepting
PAvLovA, as being an
exotic and in a way an
accident in this historic
programme, the in-
teresting thing to record
is the fact, already
hinted at, that the
performers who best
were so many per-
formers and each had
a different scene, and
some—such as WILKIE
BARD, C. T. ALDRICH
and ALFRED LESTER—
brought elaborate pro-
perties, perhaps the
most notable thing of
all was the celerity and
ease with which turn
succeeded to turn.
There was never a
moment's delay and
nothing went wrong.
Whoever was respon-
sible for this deserves
the highest commenda-
tion.

thorough-going music-

WESTATILLEY had sung her soldier song
instead of the obsolete ditty she chose,
or HARRY LAUDER had come on earlier
and given of his best, instead of his
second best, or WILKIE BARD had re-
vived an old favourite, or LITTLE TICH
had indulged in some of his patter, the
isolation of HARRY TATE and GEORGE
RoBEY would have been less noticeable.
But we must judge by the materials
before us, and as things went there is
no doubt whatever that these two made
the deepest impression on the house as
a whole and the royal box in par-
ticular.
In addition to HARRY TATE, the
BogANNYs, as Chinese acrobats in no
way impaired by opium, had done much
to raise the temperature to something
approaching true music-hall heat, but
it was left for that irresponsible robust
cynic, GEORGE RoREY, to send the mer-
nonsense and his vigour, must have
come as new things. His superb confi-
dence made almost every one else a
little nebular; even HARRY LAUDER,
usually so masterful, was in a minor
key, WILKIE BARD all woolly, and
poor CHIRGwin toiled in vain. White-
eyed Kaffirs never boomed less. This
was a pity, because he was the only
performer of the evening who had pre-
pared anything special and peculiar to it
—a little recitation on the First of July,
which merely perplexed the audience
unfamiliar with his naïve idiosyncracies
(and CHIRGWIN takes many years to
know, and, indeed, the prosperity of his
quarter of an hour depends always as
much on the audience as himself) and
drew only the applause of sympathy.
But CHIRGWIN, like the true fantast
that he is, turned his failure to account
by remarking that he had thought the

ALPHONSE—"SPORTMAN."
HE had dark curly hair, and his
side-whiskers would have done credit
to an English butler of Fifth Avenue.
That his name was Alphonse I have
not the slightest doubt, and when I
met him first he was attired in football
knickerbockers, a noisy blazer of no
particular cut, running shoes equipped
with regulation three - quarter - inch
spikes, and a cheery cherry-coloured
skull-cap with a gold tassel. A welted
leather cricket ball was gathered in his
left hand, and, from the knowing look
in his eye, I felt that Alphonse was
about to deliver a subtle googly ready
to break both ways—win or place.
I passed him in haste, but the en-
counter left me with some realisation
of that passionate enthusiasm for sport
which has swept across Belgium from
its sea front to its remotest boundaries.
Some weeks later I saw Alphonse
again—the merest glimpse. He did
not recognise me, and but for the side-
whiskers he too might have gone un-
recognised. As it was, for cne vivid
instant he appeared, clad in a nonde-
script sweater, white flannel trousers
and tennis shoes (probably doe-skin).
He was in act to smite over his head
into the void with a hockey stick
wonderfully poised in his gloved hand.
Clearly Alphonse was a trier. -
After that I frequently passed him
of an afternoon. I began to look upon
him as a friend and one in whose
prowess I could take legitimate pride.
It is not every “sportman” who can
play tennis in football boots and wear-
ing six-ounce boxing gloves. Perhaps
Alphonse was doing it for a wager. If
so, he probably won, for when I passed
him he had the air of having just
brought off a lovely cut which, I am
confident, eluded slip and trickled to
the boundary. . . . - -
There was something so consistently
surprising about each new encounter
with Alphonse that I ceased to be
surprised until the outrage occurred.
As a fisherman I fancy he could have
told many a good story. I saw him
once in a mackintosh and waders,
seated on a three-cornered stool and
having just succeeded in casting an
artificial roach with a fly rod for pike.
The luncheon basket at his side was
empty. On a motor bicycle, with yacht-
ing cap and khaki putties; passing out
at Rugger in long trousers and a Norfolk
jacket; racing down the wing in a
rainproof overcoat at Soccer; in these
and in many other sports beyond my
knowledge Alphonse was magnificent.
Through all, my friendship for him
grew, became indeed more real a thing

THE DOUBLE.
I was having lunch in one of those
places where you stand and eat sand-
wiches until you are tired, and then try
to count up how many you have had. As
the charm of these sandwiches is that
they all taste exactly alike, it is difficult
to recall each individual as it went
down; one feels, too, after the last
sandwich, that one's mind would more
willingly dwell upon other matters.
Personally I detest the whole business
—the place, the sandwiches, the method
of scoring—but it is convenient and
quick, and I cannot keep away. On this
afternoon I was giving the foie gras
plate a turn. I know a man who will
never touch foie gras because of the
cruelty involved in the preparation of
it. I excuse myself on the ground that
my own sufferings in eating these
sandwiches are much greater than
those of any goose in providing
them.
There was a grey-haired man in the
corner who kept looking at me. I
seemed to myself to be behaving with
sufficient propriety, and there was
nothing in my clothes or appearance
to invite comment; for in the working
quarter of London a high standard of
beauty is not insisted upon. On the
next occasion when I caught his eye
I frowned at him, and a moment later
I found myself trying to stare him
down. After two minutes it was I who
retired in confusion to my glass.
As I prepared to go—for to be
watched at meals makes me nervous,
and leads me sometimes to eat the card
with “Foie Gras” on it in mistake for
the sandwich—he came up to me and
raised his hat.
“You must excuse me, Sir, for staring
at you,” he said, “but has anyone ever
told you that you are exactly like
A. E. Barrett 2"
I drew myself up and rested my
left hand lightly on my hip. I thought
he said DAVID GARRICK.
“The very image of him,” he went
on, “when first I met him.”
Something told me that in spite of
his grey hair he was not talking of
DAVID GARRICK after all.
“Like who 2 " I said in some dis-
appointment.
“A. E. Barrett.”
I tried to think of a reply, both
graceful and witty. The only one I
could think of was, “Oh 2 ''
“It’s extraordinary. If your hair
were just a little longer the likeness
would be perfect.”
I thought of offering to go away now
and come back in a month's time.
Anyway, it would be an excuse for
“I first knew him at Cambridge,”
he explained. “We were up together in
the seventies.”
“Ah, I was up in the nineteen hun-
dreds,” I said. “I just missed you
both.”
“Well, didn't they ever tell you at
Cambridge that you were the image of
A. E. Barrett 2"
I tried to think. They had told me
lots of things at Cambridge, but I
couldn't remember any chat about A.
E. Barrett.
“I should have thought every one
would have noticed it,” he said.
I had something graceful for him
this time all right.
“Probably,” I said, “those who
were unfortunate enough to know me
had not the honour of knowing A. E.
Barrett."
“But everybody knew A. E. Barrett.
You ’ve heard of him, of course?”
The dreadful moment had arrived.
I knew it would.
“Of course,” I said.
“A charming fellow.”
“Very brainy,” I agreed.
“Well, just ask any of your artist
friends if they don't notice the likeness.
The nose, the eyes, the expression
—wonderful! But I must be going.
Perhaps I shall see you here again
some day. Good afternoon; ” and he
raised his hat and left me.
You can understand that I was con-
siderably disturbed. First, why had I
never heard of A. E. Barrett? Secondly,
what sort of looking fellow was he?
Thirdly, with all this talk about A. E.
Barrett, how ever many sandwiches
had I eaten ? The last question seemed
the most impossible to answer, so I
said “eight,” to be on the safe side,
and went back to work.
In the evening I called upon Peter.
My acquaintance of the afternoon had
assumed too readily that I should allow
myself to be on friendly terms with
artists; but Peter's wife illustrates
books, and they both talk in a familiar
way of our greatest Academicians.
“Who,” I began at once, as I shook
hands, “did I remind you of as I came
in at the door 2"
Peter was silent. Mrs. Peter, feeling
that some answer was called for, said,
“The cat.”
“No, no. Now I'll come in again.”
I went out and returned dramatically.
“Now then, tell me frankly, doesn't
that remind you of A. E. Barrett enter-
ing his studio?”
“Who is A. E. Barrett 2"
I was amazed at their ignorance.
“He's the well-known artist. Surely
you've heard of him 2"
“I seem to know the name,” lied
“'Sunrise on the Alps,’ ‘A Corner of
the West,’ ‘The Long Day Wanes'—
I don't know. Something. The usual
thing.” -
“And are you supposed to be like
him 2 ''
“I am. Particularly when eating
sandwiches.”
“Is it worth while getting you some,
in order to observe the likeness?” asked
Mrs. Peter.
“If you've never seen A. E. Barrett
I fear you'd miss the likeness, even
in the most favourable circumstances.
Anyhow, you must have heard of him
—dear old A. E.' "
They were utterly ignorant of him,
so I sat down and told them what
I knew; which, put shortly, was that he
was a very remarkable-looking fellow.
+ *: + + +
I have not been to the sandwich-place
since. Detesting the sandwiches as I
do, I find A. E. Barrett a good excuse
for keeping away. For, upon the day
after that when he came into my life,
I had a sudden cold fear that the thing
was a plant. How, in what way, I
cannot imagine. That I am to be sold
a Guide to Cambridge at the next meet-
ing; that an A. E. Barrett hair-restorer
is about to be placed on the market;
that an offer will be made to enlarge
my photograph (or Barrett's) free of
charge if I buy the frame—no, I cannot.
think what it can be.
Yet, after all, why should it be a
plant? We Barretts are not the sort
of men to be mixed up with fraud. Im-
petuous the Barrett type may be, ob-
stinate, jealous—so much you see in
our features. But dishonest ? Never!
Still, as I did honestly detest those
last eight sandwiches, I shall stay
away. A. A. M.

OR THE LONDON
THE MARTYRS.
THEY arrived—carriage paid—just
before afternoon school, and from the
moment of their arrival the dull mono-
tony of Staff Room life, was charged
with all the delirium of high romance.
Nicodemus, short and suspiciously
stumpy for a pedigree newt (the Art
Mistress pointed out that his tail in
particular was hopelessly out of draw-
ing) clambered instantly to the top of
the tree that forms the piece of resist-
ance (if the Gallicism be permitted)
of our new aquarium; but his com-
panion, evidently a confirmed pessimist,
sank so determinedly into the darkest
recesses of the sanded floor that we
decided in sheer humanity to respect
his incognito.
At lunch next day it was observed
that Nicodemus, touched probably with
the modern spirit of restlessness, had
impulsively abandoned his coat. “How
too perfectly sweet of him 1" cooed
Miss Simpson (Miss Simpson stands
for “Science” on the Staff). “Most
ungentlemanly conduct, I should call
it,” sniffed the Senior Mathematical
Mistress—ever a precisian—and was
vehemently applauded by Mademoiselle,
who fled shuddering out into the cor-
ridor, only to be further embarrassed
by a stream of Middle School admirers
bearing gifts—the slimiest duckweed,
the most succulent slugs—and was
finally discovered in the Art Room
thanking just Heaven that plaster
casts at least are inanimate.
Nicodemus, borne triumphantly in a
bottle from class to class—Anonymous,
at his own desire, remained at home—
so identified himself with his environ-
ment that whenever the lesson bell
rang he was to be detected making
conscientious efforts to take his place
with the school. His restlessness was
further increased by the passion—
natural enough perhaps—that he had
contracted for Miss Simpson, who,
arriving early on the second morning,
was met by the affectionate fellow
on the stairs. Rising next day be-
times in the hope of a similar inter-
view, he unfortunately encountered a
charwoman, who went at once into
hysterics and threw up her office. On
the following morning he was with
considerable difficulty retrieved from
behind the hot-water pipes in the
Laboratory—an apartment he had
learned to associate with his adored
Mistress—and cast ignominiously back

popularity of Miss Simpson, now con-
victed of gross negligence in the care
of school property, suffered complete
eclipse.
All day the search for Anonymous
went on, one relief party going so far as
to patrol the tower roof; while another,
armed with bicycle lamps, investigated
the coal-hole. When the morrow
dawned our worst fears were confirmed.
Nicodemus was found distended—dead.
“Of grief,” wailed Miss Simpson; but
the Classics Mistress (local Hon. Sec.
S.P.C.A.) hinted darkly at asphyxia.
Worse, we learned how we had wronged
the lofty-souled Anonymous. While
we had deemed him sullen he had but
been brooding over Rule XI. : “Every

moment of their arrival the dull mono-

with all the delirium of high romance.
Nicodemus, short and suspiciously

sank so determinedly into the darkest
recesses of the sanded floor that we
decided in sheer humanity to respect
his incognito.
At lunch next day it was observed
that Nicodemus, touched probably with
the modern spirit of restlessness, had
impulsively abandoned his coat. "How

Miss Simpson (Miss Simpson stands
for “ Science' on the Staff).“ Most

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ES S E N C E OF PA R L I AM E N T.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, July 1.
—DENMAN's eagle eye has discovered
device practised in Unionist haunts
which accounts for recent reductions
of Ministerial majority. Disclosed it
in question addressed to WEDGwood
BENN, cherubic representative in this
House of FIRST CoMMIssionER of
WoRKs. Wants to know “whether he
is aware that the division bells ring in
a certain Conservative club; and, see-
ing that this gives a party advantage to
unpaired Conservative Members who
are thereby enabled to take part in
divisions without being within the
precincts of the House, whether he will
immediately take steps to have the
arrangement terminated?”
BENN with instinct of constitutional
Minister hesitates. All very well for
CROMwFLL to make sudden descent on
House of Commons and thunder in-
structions to “Take away that bauble.”
But what authority is to raid the
sanctuary of a private Club and forcibly
cut off one of its private luxuries?
SARK says it has been done. It
happened in the late Seventies, when
THE PIEMIER SITs ouT.
ing the Government almost literally
tooth and nail. One night critical
division was expected. Irish Members
artfully prolonged discussion till
patience of irritated Saxon was worn
out. At that epoch it was the habit,
more extensively observed than to-
day, to while away dull sittings by
prolonging the dinner-hour at the St.
Stephen's Club, to which convenient
access was provided by subterranean
passage from Palace Yard. Custom
leniently regarded by Whips, since the
Club was connected with the House by
a wire which rang a bell simultaneously
with that clanging through rooms and
corridors.
Dinner well advanced, the Irish
Members permitted division to be
taken. Ministerial Whip quite easy in
mind. A fairly safe muster of men on
the premises. With the St. Stephen's
contingent hurrying over there would
be quite the full average majority.
Only three minutes to do the spurt in.
With punctual start experience had
repeatedly shown that that sufficed.
A minute sped and there was silence
turned to listen for the welcoming
tramp of returning Members. Another
minute and he began to have quickened
sympathy with Mariana in the Moated
Grange.
“They linger long,” he said.
He said, “I am aweary, aweary,
I would that I were dead.”
Division took place in absence of the
diners-out. Ministerial defeat averted
by narrow majority. In response to
furious enquiries from irate Whip,
explanation forthcoming. The wire
connecting House and Club dining-
room had been surreptitiously cut. In
vain the bell rang through the pre-
cincts of the House. It was dumb in
the Club dining-room, where, as NERO
fiddled whilst Rome burnt, loyal
Ministerialists unconcernedly ate and
drank whilst life of the Government
was in peril.
But that is another story which
SARK hopes will not suggest evil design.
WEDGwood BENN, whilst hating to
refuse anything to anybody, was unable
to encourage desire for Ministerial inter-
ference in the matter. What with the

Business done.-By 254 votes against
188 resolved that, “In the opinion of
this House, it is expedient that the
representatives of the employers' and
the workmen's organisations involved
in the present dispute in the Port of
London should meet, with a view to

In the play of this particular hand the

Tuesday.—Back for a while in good
old times. One of the legacies con-
ferred upon House by PRINCE ARTHUR,
sufficient of itself to keep his memory
green, is the Standing Order limit-
ing what is paradoxically called the
Question hour. Business commences
at ten minutes to three. If questions
put down for oral reply are not dis-
posed of by a quarter to four they are
answered, as all questions should be,

votes. Sharp on the stroke of a quarter

filled up with irregular debates on
spread of cattle plague and religious
tourney in Ulster, personal statement
from Lord Robert CECIL thrown in.
Naturally debate on Ulster affair the
liveliest. Allegation was that a party
of excursionists, largely composed of
women and children, were assailed by
body of the Ancient Order of Hibern-
ians, who differ from them on certain
theological questions. According to
story by Gordon, an Ulster Member,
the Roman Catholics were wholly to
blame. The affair arose upon the
action of an Ancient Hibernian, pre-
sumably old enough to know better,
who “dashed into the excursion party,”
enforcing his religious convictions with
assistance of a shillelagh.
According to JoHN DILLON the
Ancient Order of Hibernians were meek
as lambs, unresisting victims of the theo-
: logical arguments of the Orangemen,
which took the concrete form of pav-
ing-stones and half bricks. According
to report of police, read by ST. AUGUS-
TINE, there was lack of restraint in
both religious camps. So impartial,
not to say indiscriminate, the clash of
polemics that one police sergeant was
kicked in the stomach, and another
bowled over with half a brick.
Effect of narrative upon WINTERTON
and Cousin HUGH extraordinary. Use-

Apparently both had amendments to
move or remarks to make. WINTER-
ToN bobbed up from above the Gang-

arms and legs twitching, half rose
from corner seat below Gangway. Too
polite to stand in each other's way,
each one, observing intention of his
friend to speak, hurriedly resumed his
seat. Whereupon less scrupulous
Member on back bench got a look-in.

he did, and at eleven o'clock we had
the story all over again. But it had
lost its freshness and the sense of
stolen joy in starting debate in circum-
stances defiant of all rules of orderly
procedure.
Business done.—Very little; forty
minutes of sitting being filched for
Supplementary Questions, and Members
worked up to state of irritation un-
favourable to sober debate.

cheer rose from both sides when, the

priation of the common time. Hogg|E,
taking note of this new ruling, dis-
creetly observed it. Nevertheless, whilst
guiding his course of action by it, il
marchait toute la route avec le cochon.
(That's Norman French. Perhaps I
had better translate it. It simply
means in our vernacular “He went the
whole Hogg|E.") In brief, he occupied
nearly a page of the Question paper
with inquiries numbered from 53 to 60

under one-tenth of the whole number.
But the wily Hogge averted possible
interference from the Chair by sub-
dividing each numbered question, thus
working off a total of 18.
He was beaten by Mr. Touche who, in
a series of ten questions grouped under
a single numeral, enthralled the House
with biography of John Richards, of
60, Hatchards Road, Upper Holloway,
N., whose father was born at Nassau,
Bahama, West Indies, who went to
school in Brand Street, Holloway, the
birth of whose eldest daughter was
registered at Somerset House 49 years
ago, and who had fruitlessly applied for
an old-age pension.
And this in a business assembly
which sees before it the prospect of

order to deal with national affairs

Treasury Bench with threatening at-
titude towards PRINCE ARTHUR, then
Prime Minister. This action was
attributed to Mr. Thomas O'Donnell,
Member for West Kerry. Mr. O'Don-
NELL writes to disclaim identity with
the Member responsible for the scene.
I make haste to correct a confusion of
names, and much regret any annoyance
Mr. O'Donnell, may have suffered in
consequence of it. According to Han-

THOMAs, it was a memorable dish l
A miracle of culinary art |
Where lettuce decked the rosy-tinted fish,
And pale cucumber played no trifling part ;
The subtle vinegar a relish tart
Gave to the wonder, but oh! most my praise
Fell to those sauces—ahl be still, my heart
Truly I shall remember all my days
The magic savour of that mayonnaise.
What wonder, Thomas, if you looked askanco
When my fond mother took a second share,
Or sped o'er Juliet's head an anxious glance
So as to see if she was playing fair?
Paterfamilias with a gusto rare
Put down a generous portion on his plato,
So that I turned in haste to see if there
Was any left remaining. I may state
That I was sorry I got helped so late.
And then I saw, O Thomas, in your eye
How fierce can be the agony that sears
His soul who stands in mute remonstrance by
Nobly you bore the torment l But the tears,
Slow oozing forth, a tedious passage gained
Adown your cheeks befurrowed by the years.
A sudden pity struck me; though it pained,
I waved aside the surplus and refrained.
I saw, in fancy, Thomas, you and him,
The author of the marvel, eyed by all
That crowd whose speech is hushed, whose gaze is dim—
The minor members of the servants' hall;
I saw you, Dual Kings, in rapture fall
On that delicious remnant, ah I saw
The light of gladness in your optics' ball,
I heard the joyous clashing of your jaw,
I felt the satisfaction of your maw.
How false and fleet my fancy! But who thought
That he, that vilest little Benjamin,
Who stays up later than such children ought,
Had room to take a second helping in
But so it was. We saw that child of sin
Pounce on the precious morsel, feasting twice.
Your ample frame took on an aspect thin;
Dead the day's promise. I, as cold as ice,































While the last wreck of dishes disappears.

arrangements in the Mediterranean,
Consols at 764 and, on top of all, out-
break of Cattle Disease, the Government
have sufficient on their hands without
stretching them forth to pluck down
bell-wires in neighbouring clubs.
Business done.-By 254 votes against
188 resolved that, “In the opinion of
this House, it is expedient that the
representatives of the employers' and
the workmen's organisations involved
in the present dispute in the Port of
London should meet, with a view to
arriving at a settlement.”
In the play of this particular hand the
PREMIER “sat out.” Abstained from
voting. -
Tuesday.—Back for a while in good
old times. One of the legacies con-
ferred upon House by PRINCE ARTHUR,
sufficient of itself to keep his memory
green, is the Standing Order limit-
ing what is paradoxically called the
Question hour. Business commences
at ten minutes to three. If questions
put down for oral reply are not dis-
posed of by a quarter to four they are
answered, as all questions should be,
on a printed paper circulated with the
votes. Sharp on the stroke of a quarter
to four real business begins. To-day,
with Home Rule Bill first Order, it
was twenty-five minutes to five before
JHouse got into Committee. Interval
filled up with irregular debates on
spread of cattle plague and religious
tourney in Ulster, personal statement
from Lord Robert CECIL thrown in.
Naturally debate on Ulster affair the
liveliest. Allegation was that a party
of excursionists, largely composed of
women and children, were assailed by
body of the Ancient Order of Hibern-
ians, who differ from them on certain
theological questions. According to
story by GoRDoN, an Ulster Member,
the Roman Catholics were wholly to
blame. The affair arose upon the
action of an Ancient Hibernian, pre-
sumably old enough to know better,
who “dashed into the excursion party,”
enforcing his religious convictions with
assistance of a shillelagh.
According to JoHN DILLON the
Ancient Order of Hibernians were meek
as lambs, unresisting victims of the theo-
ºlogical arguments of the Orangemen,
which took the concrete form of pav-
ing-stones and half bricks. According
to report of police, read by ST. AUGUS-
TINE, there was lack of restraint in
both religious camps. So impartial,
not to say indiscriminate, the clash of
polemics that one police sergeant was
kicked in the stomach, and another
bowled over with half a brick.
Effect of narrative upon WINTERTON
and Cousin HUGH extraordinary. Use-
an Ancient Hibernian out on the war-
path, or an Orange-scarfed -Protes-
tant peremptory in demand of instant
change of residence for the Pope.
Apparently both had amendments to
move or remarks to make. WINTER-
ToN bobbed up from above the Gang-
way. Simultaneously Cousin HUGH,
arms and legs twitching, half rose
from corner seat below Gangway. Too
polite to stand in each other's way,
each one, observing intention of his
ſriend to speak, hurriedly resumed his
seat. Whereupon less scrupulous
Member on back bench got a look-in.
Performance repeated da capo.
At last WINTERTON, his hands rev-
erentially folded over his chest aſter
the manner of saints in stained glass
windows, found opportunity of giving
notice to recur to the matter on
motion for the adjournment. This

he did, and at eleven o'clock we had
the story all over again. But it had
lost its freshness and the sense of
stolen joy in starting debate in circum-
stances defiant of all rules of orderly
procedure.
Business done.—Very little; forty
minutes of sitting being filched for
Supplementary Questions, and Members
worked up to state of irritation un-
favourable to sober debate.
Thursday.—The other day rousing
cheer rose from both sides when, the
INTERRoGATIVEREEshavingset forth ten
questions in succession, the SPEAKER
stopped him at the eighth, remarking
that that was sufficiently large appro-|... .
priation of the common time. Hogg|E,
taking note of this new ruling, dis-
creetly observed it. Nevertheless, whilst
guiding his course of action by it, il
marchait toute la route avec le cochon.
(That's Norman French. Perhaps I
had better translate it. It simply
means in our vernacular “He went the
whole Hogg|E.") In brief, he occupied
nearly a page of the Question paper
with inquiries numbered from 53 to 60
That bad enough, being a fraction
under one-tenth of the whole number.
But the wily HoggB averted possible
interference from the Chair by sub-
dividing each numbered question, thus
working off a total of 18.
He was beaten by Mr. Touche who, in
a series of ten questions grouped under
a single numeral, enthralled the House
with biography of John Richards, of
60, Hatchards Road, Upper Holloway,
N., whose father was born at Nassau,
Bahama, West Indies, who went to
school in Brand Street, Holloway, the
birth of whose eldest daughter was
registered at Somerset House 49 years
ago, and who had fruitlessly applied for
an old-age pension.
And this in a business assembly
which sees before it the prospect of
sitting into the month of March in
order to deal with national affairs
peremptorily crowded upon it !
Business done.—Army votes in Com-
mittee. SEELY makes first appearance
as Secretary of State for War.
Writing last week about Mr. LANs-
BURY's attack on the PRIME MINISTER,
I quoted a reminiscence by the MEMBER
For SARK recalling an analogous scene,
when an Irish Member approached the
Treasury Bench with threatening at-
titude towards PRINCE ARTHUR, then
Prime Minister. This action was
attributed to Mr. THOMAs O'Donn ELL,
Member for West Kerry. Mr. O'Don-
NELL writes to disclaim identity with
the Member responsible for the scene.
I make haste to correct a confusion of
names, and much regret any annoyance
Mr. O'DoNNELL may have suffered in
consequence of it. According to Han-
sard, the Member suspended for the
breach of order was Mr. John
O'DoNNELL, Member for South Mayo.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SOLUTION.
I MUST have looked worn and
haggard as I entered Dorinda's mother's
drawing-room. Dorinda was alone.
She was sitting almost anyhow on the
sofa reading a novel, and an extremely
frivolous one too, I'm afraid. I don't
know what our girls are coming to,
especially Dorinda.
“Hullo! dear old thing,” she said
without moving.
Dorinda is twenty-two and it was
high time someone spoke to her about
it. - - -
“You should get up and drop a
curtsey,” I told her. “Now put your
book away. Dear, dear, our manners
seem to get worse every day.”
“Nobody invited you to tea,” she
said. “However, as the butler's let
you in, you'd better stay, I suppose.”
I sat down on the only available part
of the sofa.
“I hope you will endeavour to be
serious, Dorinda,” I said. “I do not
grudge you your little moment of merri-
ment just now, but you must understand
that I have not come here this afternoon
to crack jokes with you. Kindly ring
for tea.”
I waited until the butler had left the
room before proceeding.
“As you are aware, Dorinda,” I
continued, “I am not a Ladies' Man.”
She shook her head over the tea-pot.
Her hair is perfectly black, and she
parts it in the middle and does it down
over her ears in two large curly-wurly
things. A foolish method.
“So far am I from being a Ladies'
Man,” I said, “that I sometimes even
go to the length of calling myself a
misogynist—which is probably rather
a long word for you.”
“I take your meaning,” said Dorinda,
“and I am on the brink of tears.”
She handed me a cup of tea.
“The prospect of marriage,” I went
on, “is one which I should contemplate
with absolutely no enthusiasm whatever,
I am not putting it too strongly 2”
“No, you are putting it as gently as
you can, but my poor heart is breaking,”
sobbed Dorinda.
I Lelped myself to a jam sandwich.
“Another salient characteristic of
mine,” I pursued, “is that I am very
conventional and extremely particular.
Almost too much so, I sometimes
think.”
“You are an example to all of us,”
said Dorinda.
I think she really meant it.
“Anything in the nature of a-of a
flirtation shocks me very much. Very
much indeed.”
“Oh, it does me too,” said Dorinda
I surveyed the pattern on the carpet
in silence for some moments.
“These principles,” I continued,
“are very upright and manly, and they
do me credit. And in theory they are
all right. But there is a difference
between theory and practice. It is a
little difficult to explain why.”
“Oh, it is,” said Dorinda, “but you
must try to tell me. See, I will hold
your hand.” -
I gave her my hand without demur,
and transferred my gaze from the car-
pet to my boots.
“It may be said that life is full of
compromises.”
“Certainly it may be said,” she
assured me, “and it is said too.”
“Well, my dear,” I concluded, “you
are perhaps rather young to under-
stand, but the facts of the matter are
these. Last week I became engaged
to a girl called Joan. Nothing very
much in that, you may say. But wait.
Yesterday, in a weak moment, I
proposed to, and was accepted by, a
wholly separate and distinct girl called
Nancy. I slept very badly last night.
My health is not good enough to stand
these sort of complications. I think
people should be more considerate with
an invalid like me.”
“Which one do you like best ?”
asked Dorinda.
“Well, really, what an extraordinary
question "I exclaimed. “I can hardly
say off-hand. So far as I have
examined into the matter, I should
think there was very little to choose
between them. They've both got rather
nice names, haven't they 2 What do
you think I ought to do about it? Why
should I be worried like this? I'm
afraid to meet them.”
“Poor boy,” said Dorinda com-
passionately, “I will marry you and
protect you from them.”
I sprang up. “That's a splendid
idea!” I cried. “Of course, if I were
married to you, it would solve the
whole difficulty. I could go to Nancy
and say quite simply, ‘You see how
it is, I mean '—and the same with
Joan, and it would be all right.”
Dorinda, her tears banished, smiled
happily up at me.
“Have I helped you, dear old thing?”
“Of course you have,” I said. “You
are—The Solution.”
And it seemed so at the time, but, as
I have not yet managed to make the
little explanation either to Joan or to
Nancy, it occurs to me sometimes in
thoughtful moments that I am more
deeply involved than ever.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON CHOOSING A PIANO.
[A few suggestions by a well-known Clerk of
the Scales.]
Select a piano as you would a hunter
—or a wife.
There are several breeds of pianos—
the Cottage, the Baby Grand, the Upright
Grand, the Semi-Grand, the Grand, the
Double Grand and the Gorgeous. The
last-named, embellished with folding
doors and jewelled in sixteen holes,
it is at once a thing of beauty and a
cabinet of mystery. When your host
throws open its ornamental portals you
begin to wonder if he is going to look
for a clean collar or to show you the
razor-edged crease on his new evening
trousers. When he seats himself before
it you imagine that he has forgotten
your presence and is about to attend to
his correspondence, and when the flag
falls the beauty of the first few opening
bars of one of MENDELssoHN’s “Songs
Without Words” is lost upon you.
Having decided on the kind of piano
you want, or your wife wants, or the
most important member of your house-
hold insists upon having, you enter the
establishment in which this particular
breed is stabled. Have courage.
Take a good look round first, with an
eye to form and colour. Avoid the
chestnuts and light bays. A good up-
standing dark roan will probably attract
your attention before long. Approach
it in a soothing manner on the near
side. Spend a moment in admiring
the straight foreleg tapering to the
fetlock or castor-joint, and before
exposing the keyboard open the man-
hole at the top and peer into the
place “where the notes come from.”
This will convince the groom in
attendance that you are not a novice.
If the light is bad strike a match, but
not on the polished top; strike only
on the back of the box, where the wood
is plain. Note the position of the
carburetters, and having satisfied your-
self that the thing is fitted throughout
with the Major's special wires and has
a good action, open its mouth and have
a look at the ivories.
The question now arises: Are they
really ivory, or are they bonzaline 2
You see, it makes such a difference in
the angle when playing “The Long
Jenny,” for instance. Having settled
this knotty point to your entire satis-
faction you cannot do better than look
for a nice G. Most pianos include a
few of these in their curriculum. If
you can't find one, select an A or a B,
or some other easy note, and strike it
fairly and squarely. Don't be nervous
and ſoozle the shot. Tilt your hat on
one side so as to rest your ear against

wheezing the brute is a roarer, and you
should pass on ; but if the breathing is
quite regular and melodious you are
possibly on a good thing and should
make excursions among the other
notes. Don't be in a hurry. The place
doesn't close for another five minutes,
and business probably isn't so brisk
that the manager will call, “Time,
gentlemen, please !” before he has
taken your order.
Having assured yourself that the
chest and lungs are all right, the pitch
has to be considered. Don't pronounce
it as too high or too low or too uneven
until you have tried a few overs—or
If not then to your liking have it rolled
between the innings and try again.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BIRTH DAY.
(Communicated by a Cake-Eater.)
THE 1st of July was Peggy's birthday, and we made up
our minds that it was to be a good one. We all love
birthdays, except Dad, and he doesn't take the least interest
in his own birthday. He says it has come round much too
often and he's quite tired of it and doesn't want to hear
any more about it. It comes early in January, very soon
after Christmas, so we don't mind so much. If it came in
April or May or August we should insist on making it a
great day, for our family has no feasts or birthdays in those
months, and it wouldn't be right to waste a chance of
having one of our “joyments and joycings"—that's what
John calls them. We all think it would be best for a family
to have a birthday in every month of the year; but when I
told this to Mum she pretended to give a shriek of horror
and said the mere thought of a family of ten children was
too terrible. Four were trouble enough, and if she had to
provide food and clothes and boots for more than twice as
many she thought she would never be able to pay the bills.
She would have to pine away into an early grave. So
perhaps we had better stay as we are.
Peggy's birthday came on a Monday, and on the Saturday
we had all got our presents for her. We all asked her
questions so as to find out what she really wanted. Of
course we didn't say, “What would you like, Peggy 2"
We were much more cunning than that. We said, “Peggy,
if you had to give something to a little girl of about eight
or ten years old, what would you get for her ?” Or, “Did
you see any nice things in the shop windows when you
were in Barksbury yesterday 2” It was quite successful,
and we found out what she wanted; only John said he
must buy her a sewing-machine, because she told him that
was the one thing in the world for her, and he asked Dad
to give him the money for it. In the end he got her a box
of soldiers; but he promised her a sewing-machine next
time, and he has already saved up three pennies and a
half-penny stamp; but he has licked most of the gum
off the stamp, and I don't think it will be much use
next July.
Dad got a little trinket, shaped like a heart, with a gold
chain for it; and Mum bought her a “Book of Heroes”
full of battle-pictures. My present was a paint-box, and
Rosie's was a drawing-block. She has already painted the
Battle of Waterloo on it, and she has begun the Battle
of Balaclava.
It was the hardest work in the world to keep John from
telling Peggy all about the presents. She was very sly
about it. She promised him a sixpenny aeroplane if he
would say, and he was just going to when we came in and
put our hands over his mouth. After this we had to
watch him very carefully, and, of course, he tried to tease
us by nearly telling her, but not quite. He would say,
“Dad's present is a-hum, hum, hum, and Helen's present
is a box of, box of, box of. Now you know, and I shan't
say any more.” He made Rosie and me very nervous, but
he didn't tell, after all. Dad said we mustn't expect him to
help us in curbing John, for he himself felt exactly like
John. He said he was so excited he could hardly stop
himself from telling Peggy everything, and he thought he
would have to go away to Brighton or somewhere till the
happy day arrived. I think this was true. Dad doesn't
care a bit about his own birthday, but he always takes
a tremendous interest in ours, and he wouldn't miss the
birthday cake for a thousand pounds. He said so himself.
Besides, Peggy is the youngest girl, and Dad always spoils
her a little. Once, when he was away from home about
which had dropped out when she was biting a biscuit.
This is it. Peggy kept it:— - *
“DEAR PEGGY,+Your Mother, who sticks to the truth,
informs me you've lost a most beautiful tooth: a small one,
a white one, a sharp, not a blunt one; a tooth that was seen,
since the tooth was a front one; and she adds in a tone
which, no doubt, she thinks witty, that the loss of the tooth
doesn't make you more pretty
“When the news came, dear Peggy, I tore out my hair,
knocked my head on the floor and gave way to despair;
beat my face to a jelly and sliced off a leg, just to show how
I grieved for the toothlet of Peg. But I'll sew on my leg
and my face I'll restore, take my head off the planks and
be cheerful once more, for I've somehow remembered what
once I was told—that a new tooth will come in the place of
the old. In the meantime, dear Peggy, be good and keep
tidy and remember I'm coming to hug you on Friday; and
I hope, oh, I hope, you'll be jolly and glad (though you're
minus a tooth) in the arms of Your DAD.”
It was Rosie who first found out that this letter was in
poetry. It doesn't look like it, though. . -
I have almost forgotten to say that the birthday went off
splendidly. Peggy screamed for joy over all her presents,
and we all enjoyed the cake with nine candles and the
crackers after tea. My birthday comes next, but it's weeks
and weeks away. -

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I LAY aside Mr. C. B. FRY's new book on Batsmanship
(EvelEIGH NASH), realising that whateverruns I may have
made in my cricket career (now closed) were all of no value,
since they were all made wrongly. Looking back on the
past, after studying the many photographs of perfection in
this work, I can see that I stood wrongly, I held my bat
wrongly, I lifted it wrongly, I swung it wrongly. In short,
the only satisfaction I can feel—and that is a very poor
one—is that now and then the runs which I obtained by
these deplorable means were of use in swelling the score
and thus helping to win the match. But that is nothing;
accurate style is the thing. Still, the English captain,
although he has robbed so many of my best memories of
their joy (for I rather fancied my batting), has provided me
also with the materials of reprisal; and I am taking his book
to Leeds to watch his innings against the South Africans,
with it in my hand, and see exactly why he gets out; for
the text itself leaves that point a mystery.
The American “best-seller” is a sort of uncouth growth

sand readers consist 2 As a rule the story is rather dull.
In the case of the latest of the species to come to my
notice, Mr. CHARLEs MAJOR's The Touchstone of Fortune
(MACMILLAN), the story is extremely dull. The scene is
laid at the Court of CHARLEs THE SEcond, and the narrative
lumbers along without a thrill for two hundred and ninety-
eight pages. Yet, in my mind's eye, I can see it being
devoured by thousands from the Everglades of Florida to
Melonsguashville, Tenn. Why? It is no use the publisher
telling me in his preliminary announcement that it “more
nearly resembles When Knighthood was in Flower, the first
great success of this writer, than anything he has since
done,” for I have never been able to fathom the reasons
which induced five hundred thousand people to buy the
book he names. No, it is one of those things no fellow can
understand. Best-sellers are best-sellers, and that is all
that can be said. To me the most interesting thing about
The Touchstone of Fortune is the breezy American way in
which the characters speak. “Do you suppose we could
have made a mistake?” asks WENTwoRTH, on page 203.
“You surely did,” says King CHARLEs (champing irritably,
I have no doubt, at his chewing-gum as he spoke). And,

is on the blink. A high-toned genius like you, way up among
the great American novelists, shouldn't ought to hand out
a sentence like “Frances was the last girl who I should
have supposed capable of dying of love." Cut out this line
of talk, CHARLEs, or back to the bench for yours.
The Panel (CoNSTABLE) has put me in something of a
quandary. If Mr. Ford MADox HUEFFER, for whose gifts
as an author I have the highest appreciation, had come to
me and said, “I am now going to tell you a funny story,” I
should undoubtedly have been delighted. I should have
heard the tale throughout with attention, and at the end
might—if asked for it—have given an opinion judiciously
blending friendship and diplomacy in the usual proportions.
But to a third person who should seek my counsel on the
subject, all I could honestly say would be, “Mr. HUEFFER
is in his own line both an artist and a genius; as a painter
of historical prose-pictures he has few rivals. But for
goodness' sake don't let him tell you the story that he calls
funny, for it bored me to death !” Well, I am sorry to say
that has to stand as my considered judgment upon The
Panel. What it was all about is difficult to tell, because
despair of her “holy alchemy" as a universal solvent for
them.
Mr. Robert Lindsay, of Wester Mearns, who was in-
tended for the Kirk, but unhappily got sent down from
Glasgow College, and thereafter left his home and set out
to see the world, acknowledges in one passage of Dead
Men's Bells (SECKER), which is the story of his adventures
as narrated or rather edited by FREDERICK NIVEN, the
debt that he owes to DANIEL DEFoE. All the same, I
consider Mr. Lindsay something of a niggard in confessions
of gratitude; for when I tell you that he set out for the
Carolinas in a ship whose captain intended to wreck her
for the benefit of the owner; that the captain was a
drunkard and bullied his cabin-boy; that Mr. Lindsay
made friends with the mate, Mr. Wylie, a canny man but
no believer in women; that the ship was run down by a
pirate vessel, and that Messrs. Wylie and Lindsay escaped
by clinging to the pirates' bowsprit; that they were wrecked
on the West Highland coast and took to the heather; that
they were entertained in the Appin country by men who
feared the red-coats and hated the CAMPBELLs—you will

acters seemed to me

“To me the work of making the mind clear by first-hand
experience is the holy alchemy of life. I call it Solemnisa-
tion, but I recognise it also under the mask of Levity.”
That is the preface to The Solemnization of Jacklin, by
FLORENCE FARR (FIFIELD). Evidently a very clever and
profound book. But I should have been obliged if the
author had made up her mind whether she wished to pro-
duce a piece of flippantly unpleasant phantasy or of even
less agreeable but wholesome realism. There is no story to
speak of, but a series of attractions and repulsions which go
to make the higher Alchemy. Jacklin marries, philanders,
divorces, marries again, and is finally solemnized into taking
back her first husband. My own Solemnization (which I
recognised under the mask of Boredom) had taken place
earlier, but I persevered manfully in the hope of finding
justification for the pretentious brevity of that preface.

[In the manner of “Lorna" of “The British Weekly."]
I SPENT a delicious afternoon last Tuesday on the
Terrace at Westminster as one of the guests of Sir
Theopompus Luther, M.P. for the Mushton Division of
Slopshire. Our party included Sir Chadley and Lady
Bandon, Dr. and Mrs. Heber Chope, Professor Tertius
Toshley, the Rev. Eli Snuggs, B.D., Miss Aholibamah
Jubb, Lady Goldney Horner, and Master Boaz Horner,
who had recently recovered from a severe attack of
German measles and was unfortunately obliged to wear
a respirator.
We were shown the lions and lionesses by our courteous
host, and as it was at the height of the season and hand-
some gowns were worm at almost every table the tout
ensemble was all that could be desired. Mr. “LULU"
HARCOURT was the only Cabinet Minister who took his
tea in the open air. Mr. HARCOURT has grown graver
and more dignified in the last six years, but he still exhales
the same spiritual suavity, the same debonair unction,
which have always made him a vital force in earnest Radical
circles. He was wearing a grey frock suit with a white
tall hat and a coilar almost, if not quite, as high as those
affected by the present Earl SPENCER. Altogether, a fine,
well-groomed, statesmanlike, urbane and gracious figure.
I overheard him specially ask for China tea, and noticed
LoRD CREwe's MASTERY of THE LoRDs.
After tea our kind host conducted us into the House of
Lords, where we heard Lord CREwe addressing a large and
deeply interested audience with impassioned eloquence and
vivacity. Lord CREWE was wearing a fawn-coloured waist-
coat with magenta spots. He has the face of a dreamer
and idealist, with luminous eyes and a butterfly moustache,
and the timbre of his voice reminded us strikingly of Dr.
Wuthering Waddell, of Arbroath. Lord RoseBERY may
well be proud of his gifted son-in-law, who holds the Upper
Chamber in the hollow of his hand. We also saw Lord
MoRLEY of BLACKBURN, who was reading the article on
“Armageddon” in The British Weekly with an expression
of awe-stricken solemnity; Lord CourTNEY of PENwith,
who followed Lord CREWE's sallies with intense and boyish
enthusiasm; and Lord HALDANE, bland and sphinx-like,
whose wonderful resemblance to that noble-hearted Con-
gregationalist leader, Dr. Methuselah Spong, of Dalwhinnie,
was never more strikingly displayed. Indeed our host was
only just in time to prevent Professor Toshley leaping on to
the Woolsack to salute—as he thought—his old friend and
fellow-student. The dejection that reigned on the Tory
benches was indeed remarkable. Lord LANSDown E's hair
was rumpled, Lord SELBoRNE wore a wilted mien, and
Lord CURzoN positively shuddered beneath the torrential
stream of Lord CREWE's impetuous indictment.
MR. BURNS To THE REscu E.
On our return to the Terrace an incident occurred which
might have had a painful termination, but fortunately
ended without disaster. Master Boaz Horner, who had
been liberally treated by our hospitable host to ginger-beer
and cracknels, was suddenly seized with a violent choking
fit, to the consternation of his mother. At this moment
Mr. John BURNs came out on the Terrace, and, swiftly
taking in the situation, leapt over the intervening chairs,
seized Master Boaz Horner, smote him violently on the
back, and held him upside down over the Terrace wall until
the spasms had subsided. Mr. BURNs has grown whiter
and rather thinner in the last seven years, but otherwise
he is just the same vigorous athletic capable man whom I
first saw at Westbourne Chapel, listening to a sermon by
Dr. Boanerges Bopp in October, 1896.
A GLIMPSE of LLoyd GEORGE.
As we left the House we had the extraordinary good
fortune to see Mr. LLoyd GEORGE stepping into an R.U.A.T.
taxi and driving off in the direction of Downing Street,
amid the loud cheers and benedictions of a crowd which
had been waiting for hours for a glimpse of England's
darling statesman. The taxi-driver seemed nervously
conscious of his tremendous responsibility, for he sounded
his horn repeatedly. The CHANCELLOR, who wore a dark
lounge suit and a Trilby hat and was smoking an Intimidad
cigar, seemed in radiant spirits and responded to the cheers
of Dr. Snuggs with a gracious inclination of his noble head.
Other statesmen may have surpassed Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
in physical strength or stature or their mastery of Latin
and Greek, but certainly no one has ever approached
him in what the Rev. Wanless Dodder has so happily
called the “consecrated ingenuity” which he has dedicated
to the service of the suffering masses.

RETRIBUTION.
Mn. A., who claiMs To HAVE DONE MORE FOR THE CYCLE AND MOTOR-CAR INDUSTRY THAN ANY MAN, HAS BEEN ORDERED
wAlki NG ExERcise BY His Doctor. This Is His FIRST SATURDAY AFTERNoon IN A NorthERN subURB.
SOO-TI.
A PEKINESE.
Soo-Ti, I thank the careful fate
That made you wise and obstinate,
Alert, but with a proper pride,
And gay, but wondrous dignified.
I praise your black and tilted nose;
I praise your heart's deep love that
shows
In songs made up of whimpering
cries
And in the radiance of your eyes
(And if they bulge—forgive the
allusion—
Are eyes the worse for such protrusion?
The smaller eyes are, sure, the blinder,
And size makes every kind eye kinder).
Next with affection's look I note
The glossy levels of your coat,
Where a rich black doth most prevail,
Shading to beaver in your tail,
And lightly fading as it reaches
The tufted things you wear as breeches.
The dweller on the cushion purrs
She blinks and blinks and lets you
share
Her bowl of milk, her fav'rite chair.
For you she hides her cruel claw
And taps you with a velvet paw;
And, mastered by your lordly air,
For you is meek and debonair.
Even should you growl her hair stays
flat :
Be sure she thinks you half a cat.
But you're a Dog and know your job:
Oft have I seen you hob-a-nob,
And grandly gracious to unbend
With a Great Dane, your humble friend.
As on the lawn with him you roll,
He makes your very being droll.
Yet how you set to work to flout him,
To tease and gnaw and dance about
him
You risk the pressure of his paws,
Plunge all you are within his jaws,
And, swelling to a final rage,
With pin-point teeth the fight engage,
While he submits his silly size
To every insult you devise.
At last, withdrawing from the fuss,
Bearing aloft through every room
Your high tail's undefeated plume,
Till, fed with triumphs, you subside,
And sleep and doff your native pride,
Composing in a wicker fane
Those limbs that terrify the Dane.
So, Soo-Ti, I have tried to praise
Yourself and all your winning ways,
Content if I may guard and please
My little dusky Pekinese.
R. C. L.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RENASCENGE OF BRITAIN.
PETER RILEY was one of those lucky
people who take naturally to games.
Actually he only got his blue for cricket,
rugger and boxing, but his perfect eye
and wrist made him a beautiful player
of any game with a ball. Also he rode
and shot well, and knew all about the
inside of a car. But, although he was
always enthusiastic about anything he
was doing, he was not really keen on
games. He preferred wandering about
the country looking for birds' nests or
discovering the haunts of rare
“Fighting !” said the trainer, scorn-
fully. “Don't you worry; I'll take
good care that you don't fight any
more. The event you're going to win is
‘Pushing the Chisel.’ I’ve been watch-
ing you, and you've got the most
perfect neck and calf-muscles for it
I've ever seen. No more fighting for
you, my boy; nor cricket nor anything
else. I'm not going to let you spoil
those muscles.”
“I don't think I've ever pushed the
Chisel,” said Peter. “Besides, it's over,
isn't it 2"
“Then you're very different from
other Englishmen,” said the trainer
sternly.
Of course Peter was persuaded; he
couldn't let England be the laughing-
stock of the world. So for eight years
he lived under the eye of the trainer,
rising at five and retiring to bed at
seven - thirty. . This prevented him
from taking much part in the ordinary
social activities of the evening; and
even his luncheon and garden-party
invitations had to be declined in
some such words as “Mr. Peter

butterflies; he liked managing a
small boat single-handed in a stiff
breeze; he would have enjoyed
being upset and having to swim
a long way to shore. Most of all,
perhaps, he loved to lie on the
top of the cliffs and think of the
wonderful things that he would
do for England when he was a
Cabinet Minister. For politics
was to be his profession, and he
had just taken a first in History
by way of preparation for it.
There were a lot of silly people
who envied Peter's mother. They
thought, poor dears, that she must
be very, very proud of him, for
they regarded Peter as the ideal
of the modern young Englishman.
“If only my boy grows up to be
like Peter Riley !” they used to
say to themselves; and then add
quickly, “But of course he'll be
much nicer.” In their ignorance
they didn't see that it was the
Peters of England who were
making our country the laughing-
stock of the world.
If you had been in Berlin in
1916, you would have seen Peter;
for he had been persuaded, much
against his will, to uphold the
honour of Great Britain in the
middle-weights at the Olympic
THE NEW INDUSTRY.
“ANY STAMPs To Lick To-DAY, MUM 7"
Riley regrets that he is unable
to accept Lady Vavasour's kind
invitation for Monday the 13th,
as he will be hopping round the
garden on one leg then.” His
career, too, had to be abandoned;
for it was plain that even if he
had the leisure to get into Parlia-
ment the early hours he kept
would not allow him to take part
in any important divisions.
But there were compensations.
As he watched his calves swell;
as he looked in the glass and
noticed each morning that his
head was a little more on one side
—sure sign of the expert Chisel-
pusher; as, still surer sign, his
hands became more knuckly and
his mouth remained more per-
manently open, he knew that his
devotion to duty would not be
without its reward. He saw
already his country triumphing,
and heard the chorus of congratu-
lation in the newspapers that
England was still a nation of
sportsmen. . . .
In 1924 Pekin was crowded.
There were, of course, the ordin-
ary million inhabitants; and, in
addition, people had thronged
from all parts to see the great
Chisel-pusher of whom so much
Games. He got a position in the
papers as “P. Riley, disqualified"—the
result, he could only suppose, of his
folly in allowing his opponent to butt
him in the stomach. He was both
annoyed and amused about it; offered
to fight his vanquisher any time in
England; and privately thanked Heaven
that he could now get back to London
in time for his favourite sister's wedding.
But he didn't. The English trainer,
who had been sent, at the public ex-
pense, to America for a year, to study
the proper methods, got hold of him.
“I’ve been watching you, young
man,” he said. “You’ll have to give
yourself up to me now. You're the
coming champion.”
“I'm sorry,” said Peter politely,
“Over? Of course it's over, and that
confounded American won. “Poor old
England,’ as all the papers said."
“Then it's too late to begin to prac-
tise,” said Peter thankfully.
“Well, it's too late for the 1920 games.
But we can do a lot in eight years, and
I think I can get you fit for the 1924
games at Pekin.”
Peter stared at him in amazement.
“My good man,” he said at last, “in
1924 I shall be in London, and I hope
in the House of Commons.”
“And what about the honour of your

And so England was herself again.
There was only one discordant note in

ARTHUR'S BALL.
(Being a wholly apocryphal description
of a recent social function.)
WHEN Parliament, sick with unreason,
Was occupied, night after night,
With bandying charges of treason
And challenging Ulster to fight,
To ease the political tension
Good ARTHUR determined to call
A truce to this deadly dissension
By giving a ball.
The guests were by no means confined
to
The ranks of the old Upper Ten,
For ARTHUR has always inclined to
Consort with all manner of men;
So the brainy, though lacking in breed-
ling,
Were bidden as well as the fops;
The foes of carnivorous feeding
And lovers of chops.
There were golfers from Troon and
Kilspindie,
Discussing their favourite greens;
Bronzed soldiers from Quetta and
Pindi;
Pale pilots of flying machines;
There were débutantes, visibly flustered;
Calm beauties from over “the Pond.”;
Sleek magnates of soap and of mustard;
I saw LEONARD Borwick and Tovey
Demurely adorning the wall;
“Punch " Fairs, and his conqueror,
Covey,
Though neither was “killing the ball";
Disciples of BERGson and EDDY;
Denouncers of greed and of graft;
Whole-hearted supporters of “TEDDY,”
And backers of TAFT.
I saw a delectable duchess
Sit out with a Syndicalist,
And a battle-scarred soldier on crutches
Hobnob with a Pacificist;
And a famous professor of psychics—
A Scot who was reared at Dunkeld—
Indulge in the highest of high kicks
I ever beheld.

Were gracefully garbed in a kilt,
Performed the most daring contortions
With true Caledonian lilt;
Lord MoRLEY resembled a GRACCHUs;
LLOYD GEORGE was a genial JACK

And ELIBANK, beaming like Bacchus,
The revels surveyed.
The music was subtly compounded
Of melodies famous of yore
And measures that richly abounded
There was STRAUss, the adored of

And STRAUss, who the shrieks of

It was four of the clock ere I quitted
These scenes of eclectic delight;
The fogies had most of them flitted,
The revels were still at their height;
For GARVIN was dancing a Tango,
His head in the place of his legs;
And SPENDER a blameless Fandango
Encircled by eggs.
What incidents happened thereafter
I only can dimly surmise;
But gusts of ecstatical laughter
Went echoing up to the skies;

THE MIGHTY LIVING.
“O wad some power the giftie gie
us!" was BURNs's appeal; and the giftie
has come. A second-hand bookseller
in the Charing Cross Road (that happy
hunting-ground) gives it to some of us
with a vengeance by the simple device of
issuing a catalogue of autograph letters,
each with its price, of a number of
literary gents who are for the most
part too young or insufficiently famous
to come, in the ordinary way, under
this species of valuation. Each with
its price!—that is the deadly part of it.
Because that tells; there is no escape
from that. It shows how “others see
us.”
Let us take them alphabetically...
There are two of Mr. WILLIAM
ARCHER's letters, and one is three-and-
sixpence and the other three shillings.
Not much for the hand-writing of that
hardy Norseman, now in the Land of
the Chrysanthemum, if the illustrated
papers are to be trusted.
O WILLIAM, who in far Japan

CLAUDE and ALICE ASKEw, mys-
terious names familiar as household.
words to sensation-hunters on the
feuilleton pages—what offers for a
letter by each to a publisher? Well,
the price is three shillings the two.
Mr. A. J. BALFour's note to “my dear
Fowler” is four-and-six; but how “my
dear Fowler" came to part with it is
not explained. The same figure is
asked for a “fine" letter from MAURICE
BARING, while ordinary letters from the
same spritely hand fetch only half-a-
crown. Mr. GRANVILLE BARKER is
priced at three-and-six and two-and-six,
and then we jump to higher things
with Mr. BARRIE, who has two letters
to a publisher, one at twenty-five shil-
lings and the other at a guinea. Mr.
MAx BEERBoHM’s “fine” letter is twelve-
and-six, and an ordinary one eight-
and-six; but the economist might pre-
fer a selection of Mr. HARold BEGBIES
at one-and-six or two-and-six according
to their Haroldian merit. Mr. ARNOLD
BENNETT also is offered in some
quantity at from four-and-six to seven-
and-six. Mr. E. F. BENson is three
shillings, while for “a receipt for money
received from a publisher on account
of one of his hooks,” signed by Mr.
LAURENCE BINYoN, half-a-crown is de-
manded. All these have been in ink;
but Madame CLARA BUTT's scribbling
in pencil will cost you two shillings.
How much for a HALL CAINE 2
Surely here we reach gold once more?
No. A long letter is eight-and-six, and
sides, six-and-six. And that Other—
how much for Her? Well, she just
beats her rival in the popular bosom, a
long letter being half-a-guinea, and
more common measure eight-and-six;
but one is a little shocked to find the
distinguished editor of the Fortnightly
quoted as low as one-and-six. But
editors can always take their revenge
G. K. C., who for the moment can write
to no one, having, as all the world
grieves to hear, broken his arm, costs
five-and-six a letter; but Sir ARTHUR
CoNAN Doyle may be had at from
three-and-six to five-and-six apiece;
Mr. GALsworthy is only three-and-six,
which is very cheap; and a review
of Miss Stoddart's Life of Professor
Blackie by Mr. EDMUND GossE, “en-
tirely in Mr. GossE's handwriting,”
is even cheaper. A hand which trem-
bles not in the presence of peers!
Then we jump again, for Mr. HARDY is
priced at two guineas, one pound ten,
and one guinea, and decline swiftly to
Mr. FREDERIC HARRIson at three-and-
six, and The Man HARRIs (who knows
SHAKSPEARE as other men know the
alphabet) at from three-and-six to five-
and-six, pick where you will.
So far we have been on normal
ground; but in aletter from Mr. ANTHONY
HoPE HAwkINs “to a well-known
publisher who had made proposals to
him which he must not call extravagant
but which he certainly thought altru-
istic,” we touch upon wonder and
romance. For such a letter, containing
such strange matter, seven-and-six
seems to be a farcical sum. Mr. HEw-
LETT is also outside the normal pale, for
he writes a “humorous letter to a
publisher” and eight-and-six is asked
for it. A signed receipt of the epis-
tolary Englishwoman, Mr. LAURENCE
HousMAN, is three shillings, and there
should be a rush for it under the green,
white and purple; and the same
figure is required for a letter, also to
a publisher, by Mr. JEROME. K. JEROME,
who apparently did not think it worth
while to be funny in it. Coulson
KERNAHANs rule at sixpence or a
shilling less, and BART KENNEDYs are
a little stronger, while the only RAY
LANKESTER is two shillings, and the
only OLIVER Lodge half-a-crown. Any
number of John MASEFIELDs (in prose)
are to be had at four shillings to seven-
and-six each, and any number of
EUsTACE MILESEs, from two shillings
to three shillings each, or the price of
a nut orgy. The great question
agitating the present writer is whether
to save up for the EUSTAcE MILESEs or
for the Dr. SALEEBys, which range from
two shillings to three-and-six apiece.
A cheque drawn in Mr. BERNARD SHAw's
is a curiosity that would lay the
foundations of any museum of genius
and cannot be called dear; but to ask
two shillings for a letter by Mr.
CLEMENT SHORTER is, it must be con-
fessed, going rather far.
So much for this very remarkable
and eye-opening catalogue, with its
revolutionary appraisements. As an
aid to the young collector with a guinea
to spend and a desire for variety in
literary heroes, the following table of
suggestions has been drawn up, con-
taining illustrious names not hitherto

It was clipping the ivy which climbed
over and incidentally proved to have
been the main support of the tottering
old sundial that nearly led to his
undoing. . . .
I helped him up, raised his wages
and promised him a new straw hat to
replace the ruin lying crushed beneath
the fallen stone. Then word was sent
to the local mason to come and repair
the damage.
At 6.30 next morning I had to go
down in a dressing-gown to interview
an old and very deaf labourer. He told
me his name was Jargesir, and he had
worked nigh on seventy years man and

--
a wheel-barrow and spade—presumably
to show that there was no disguise
about his being a workman. I explained
loudly that he was not wanted to bury
a dog, but to replace a sundial that
had fallen off the wall. He retired
grumbling, and came back late that
afternoon with a fellow-mason, a young
lad of about sixty, carrying a ladder.
This, after a severe battle with the
creeper, was placed in position against
the house, and the old man slowly
crawled to the top. Then it was
discovered that the ladder was too
short, and it was decided that the men
should return with a longer one and go
thoroughly into the matter.
Next morning they came with a
longer ladder, placed it against the
wall, climbed up in turn to examine
the spot whence the dial had fallen,
descended, tried to lift the stone, agreed
that eewur-a-eavy-un, eewur, and went
away to procure some ropes and tackle
and have dinner. In the afternoon
they brought a hand-cart, some scaffold-
ing poles, ropes and blocks, a sack of
cement, and various trowels; also
another spade, doubtless feeling con-
vinced that someone would require
the time these articles were unloaded,
laid out on the lawn, sorted, identified
and discussed, it had become too dark
to see, and further postponement was
necessary.
I was away the following day, but,
on returning in the evening, found the
men perched on ladders and freely
bespattering everything within reach
with cement. The sundial was back
in position, but faced somewhere about
E. by S.S.E., with the pointer hori-
zontal. I spent some time drawing
diagrams on the path to explain the
principles of sundials in general; I
emphasized the importance of this one
in particular facing due South, and
arranged that the men should come
next morning at about 11.30, so as to
get the shadow of the pointer falling
on the XII at exactly noon. Jargesir
couldn't make head or tail of it, but
his young companion thought he had
caught the idea. There was just time
that night to get the stone loose before
the cement set.
It was unavoidable that a cloud
should obscure the sun from 11.40 to
1.15 next day, and most unfortunate
that at the next attempt an error in
bell for the striking of noon led to our
being an hour out. At the third
experiment, however, we were com.
pletely successful. The cement was
run neatly along the joints with a
trowel, and the scaffolding removed.
At the last moment Jargesir leant
across to give the pointer just the least
tap with a hammer (as it had got a
little bent from the fall) . . . and broke
it off short.
“‘I do not say it is the most important,’
Mr. Borden replied cautiously. ... “I do not think
I can usefully ad anything till a decision has
taken place.'”
But The Evening News might have
added a “d.” -
“His red-livered watermen were pulling a
long even stroke.”—Devon and Exeter Gazette.
We believe that the adjective applies
to others than watermen, but we see
no reason for dragging it in.
“Not until about 20 yards from home did
Oliver manage to put his mount's short head
in front, the verdict being a ‘short head.’”

a wheel-barrow and spade—presumably
to show that there was no disguise
about his being a workman. I explained
loudly that he was not wanted to bury
a dog, but to replace a sundial that
had fallen off the wall. He retired
grumbling, and came back late that
afternoon with a fellow-mason, a young
lad of about sixty, carrying a ladder.
This, after a severe battle with the
creeper, was placed in position against
the house, and the old man slowly
crawled to the top. Then it was
discovered that the ladder was too
short, and it was decided that the men
should return with a longer one and go
thoroughly into the matter.
Next morning they came with a
longer ladder, placed it against the
wall, climbed up in turn to examine
the spot whence the dial had fallen,
descended, tried to lift the stone, agreed
that eewur-a-eavy-un, eewur, and went
away to procure some ropes and tackle
and have dinner. In the afternoon
they brought a hand-cart, some scaffold-
ing poles, ropes and blocks, a sack of
cement, and various trowels; also
another spade, doubtless feeling con-
vinced that someone would require
the time these articles were unloaded,
laid out on the lawn, sorted, identified
and discussed, it had become too dark
to see, and further postponement was
necessary.
I was away the following day, but,
on returning in the evening, found the
men perched on ladders and freely
bespattering everything within reach
with cement. The sundial was back
in position, but faced somewhere about
E. by S.S.E., with the pointer hori-
zontal. I spent some time drawing
diagrams on the path to explain the
principles of sundials in general; I
emphasized the importance of this one
in particular facing due South, and
arranged that the men should come
next morning at about 11.30, so as to
get the shadow of the pointer falling
on the XII at exactly noon. Jargesir
couldn't make head or tail of it, but
his young companion thought he had
caught the idea. There was just time
that night to get the stone loose before
the cement set.
It was unavoidable that a cloud
should obscure the sun from 11.40 to
1.15 next day, and most unfortunate
that at the next attempt an error in
bell for the striking of noon led to our
being an hour out. At the third
experiment, however, we were com-
pletely successful. The cement was
run neatly along the joints with a
trowel, and the scaffolding removed.
At the last moment Jargesir leant
across to give the pointer just the least
tap with a hammer (as it had got a
little bent from the fall) . . . and broke
it off short,

“Don’t be an idiot l” said Callow.
“Don’t you understand that the Presi-

“Well,” I said cheerily, “I don't

BEEN To oxE, BUT IMAGINE IT MUST BE somethING LIKE This.
THE DOUANE.
SoMETIMEs I rest on the sofa. I was
doing so the other day when my little
daughter Felicity came along and sat
on top of me.
“I think,” she said, “we ought to go
abroad.”
“I've been there,” I said.
“But I haven't, and Stephen hasn't
either. We all need a change.”
Stephen, I should explain, is a hedge-
hog who belongs to my little daughter.
He lives in the garden and is intro-
duced to visitors as “quite one of the
family,” though personally I cannot
endorse this view.
“In any case,” I said, “Stephen
must stay behind; I never travel with
hedgehogs.”
And so eventually it was agreed that
Felicity and I should depart the Realm
while Stephen remained at home as
caretaker.
There was a considerable tempest
when we crossed the Channel, and I
could not bring myself to fall in with
Felicity's scheme of roving about the
rug and gave her permission to explore
by herself. --
“Right-o,” she said. “I'll leave
this with you,” and she deposited
beside me a small basket bag that she
had been carrying on her arm. “Don't
let anybody take it.”
“What's inside?” I asked.
“A surprise.”
I concluded that it was some assort-
ment of fruit and chocolates that she
was intending to spread before my
delighted gaze at a later stage of the
journey, and having little appetite or
curiosity during the voyage I let it be
without making any investigation.
Felicity put in some good work.
After a tour of inspection round the
other passengers, she disappeared up
a flight of stairs and apparently found
her way on to the bridge, for she came
back later with a glowing account of
the Captain, who, it seemed, was the
darlingest person, and had permitted
her to steer the vessel. It is possible,
however, that she was mistaken in
this, as it can hardly be supposed that
a captain with any sense of responsi-
ship to a child of twelve, with little or
no experience of navigation.
However, be this as it may, we
arrived safely in port, and, after some
turmoil, found ourselves within the
precincts of the douane.
Our luggage was slammed down in
a row on the counter and we were
invited to make declaration.
“Rien" (Nothing), I said. “Tabac 2
Oui, un peu, mais pour fumer moi-méme"
(Tobacco 2 Yes, a little, but for my own
consumption).
“Et Mademoiselle 2" they asked.
“Riem,” I repeated. “Rien neva plus"
(Nothing at all—strong negative).
Felicity looked up, deep indignation
in her eyes.
“Si, j'ai beaucoup d declarer.”
I was considerably taken aback. The
officials cast eyes of fierce suspicion
upon me and their moustaches bristled.
Fellow-passengers crowded forward
eagerly, anxious, no doubt, to see what
would become of me.
“ Felicity,” I whispered, “my dear
child, you should have told me. You
should have told Papa. What is it you

“Wait and see,” said Felicity.
The officials opened all the trunks,
Felicity watching them with queenly
dignity till they pronounced themselves
ready for the disclosure. Then she put
her hand down into the first box, felt
about, and drew out an ancient and
sadly dissipated-looking gollywog whose
hair had all departed from its head.
The officials eyed her in expectant
silence. With reverent care she sat it
down upon the counter facing them.
There was an awful pause.
Suddenly — “Mais ce n'est rien ca.”
“Rien ("cried Felicity. “Qa 1"
They had said the wrong thing.
I remembered well presenting this
antique exhibit to my little daughter in
the days when she first began to operate
with toys, and I knew that no successor
had ever supplanted it in her affection
and esteem.
I thought for a moment that she
would close the proceedings, but, after
giving them one glance of intense
disdain, she explored the second trunk.
A lighter note was now struck by
the introduction of a collapsible Teddy-
bear which, being apparently in a con-
dition of pent-up energy, immediately
advanced upon the douamiers in a
series of somersaults.
Almost incoherent, they thrust it
back with gestures of impatience. The
crowd behind us surged forward, and
the historic building was filled with
clamour.
Felicity, however, her chin at a
serene angle in the air, calmly proceeded
to the next “turn.”
This unfortunately, or perhaps
fortunately, did not come to pass. "I
recognised the velvety hindlegs of an
elephant rising out of a sea of muslin.
But, for some reason—at the time I
thought it modesty—it refused to come
bodily into sight. (As a matter of fact
its tusks had become hopelessly en-
tangled.)
Then, amid a scene of indescribable
confusion and untranslatable language,
we arrived at the finale.
“The basket now, Papa.”
“What basket 2"
“The surprise.”
I found that I was unconsciously
carrying the thing under my arm.
She took it from me and poured the
contents out upon the counter.
It was Stephen
In the railway carriage I sank back
into my seat with a sigh of relief.
“We came abroad for a little change,
didn't we?” I said.
Felicity regarded me with profound
solemnity, and then suddenly an irre-
sistible twinkle came into her eyes.

the corridor,” I suggested. “He must
be a bit stiff.”
“Yes, I will,” she said, and, taking
the basket off the rack, she opened it.
The Teddy-bear was within.
Felicity gasped.
“Oh, Stephen, where are you?”
She threw the Teddy-bear across the
somersault and then ceased with its
feet in the air.
“I expect he got into a P. & O.
Special or some such fancy train,” I
said. “It would be like Stephen.”
Felicity gazed at me thoughtfully.
“No, Papa, it must have been at the
douane. They made us pack up again
in such a hurry, Stephen got wrong.”
“Well, where do you think he went?”
“There were some French people
next us with a sort of comic tea-
basket. It's my belief that in a weak
moment Stephen got in there. He was
“Well, I suppose he'll stick to their
party now,” I suggested cheerfully.
“They say there's nothing like travel-
ling with French people to pick up the
language.”
“Yes,” said Felicity doubtfully; “but
I am a little anxious about him. He
never gets on very well with strangers.”
At that moment we were startled by
a sudden uproar coming from the next
compartment. Several people rushed
out into the corridor, calling loudly for
the Guard. Their demonstration was
made in the French tongue, and, from
the fleeting vision that she caught,
Felicity was convinced that she recog-
nised some of Stephen's new friends.
We both felt that we should go round
and investigate.

MR. PUNCH'S HOLIDAY COMPETITION.
IN order to be in the modern Press
movement and to bring to light any
hidden talent among holiday-makers,
Mr. Punch has recently organised a
grand competition for his readers.
They were requested to send in de-
scriptions of the holidays they had been
experiencing, together with sketches
illustrating the more salient points of
enjoyment; such contributions to be
judged as evidence of the competitor's
capacity for holiday - making rather
than of his skill as an author or
artist. To keep enthusiasm up to its
highest pitch Mr. Punch offered two
noble prizes, the first being a £500
motor-car, and the second a postal-
order for seven-and-six. It was pointed
out, however, that the winner might (a)
be already in possession of several cars,
or (b) have nowhere to keep one, and it
was decided therefore that he could
choose alternatively a plot of land in the
Island of Sheppey. Unfortunately it
has been found impossible to separate
four of the competitors, and until they
have met and decided whether they
would rather share the automobile or
the building site, the question of the
prize stands over. Meanwhile we have
much pleasure in giving publicity to
their holidays, and in congratulating
them all on the amount of enjoyment
they have extracted from them.
A. A. M.
I.—A Holiday IN THE ALPs.
[Mr. Ernest Spotley, 5, Park Lane,
Ponders End.]
Until this year I had never seen
Switzerland, though I have always been
fond of mountains.
Unfortunately one has little chance
this matter, and I have unceasingly
looked forward to the time when I
could cross the Channel and make
a first acquaintance with the world-
famous Alpine scenery in its native
haunts. Owing to certain private
matters, into which I need not go now,
but they were connected with the death
of an aunt, I was able last June to
launch out in the way of a holiday
rather more than usual, and I at once
decided to visit the Mecca of the Alpine
fraternity—Switzerland.
The month previous to my departure
was happily spent in preparing for my
holiday, and I took good care to
provide myself with an excellent supply
of rope, nailed boots, ricksacks, alpen-
stocks, and so forth. In this matter
I was much assisted by the advice of
my friend, Mr. George Bagg, who is a
confirmed traveller, having undertaken,
during last summer, a three days'
He was, however, a little against me
on the question of the rope.
“You’ll want a guide to tie it to,”
he pointed out.
“I shall pick up a guide out there,”
I said.
“Then why not pick up the rope
there too 2 When I was in the Nether-
lands * x
However, I decided to be on the safe
side and make all my purchases in
England before starting.
The thought of the journey alarmed
me, for I am a bad sailor, but Bagg
assured me that there was no fear of
illness so long as one always kept
in the same position.
because reasons connected with finance
compelled me to travel by the longer
route from Newhaven to Dieppe.
My destination was a little village
called Weissenwald, in the Bernese
Oberland, recommended over a game
of dominoes by a chance acquaintance
at lunch. It was not, he admitted,
precisely at the foot of the Matterhorn,
the Jungfrau and Mont Blanc (the
situation I had hoped for), but there
were several peaks well worth climbing
in the neighbourhood.
I had purchased a circular ticket, a pre-
caution which, as I understand from my
travelled friends, saves a good deal of
trouble with the authorities
abroad and I was on the eve of starting
when a most unfortunate event occurred.
My fellow-clerk, a man of apparently
robust constitution, was suddenly struck
down by that dread scourge appendi-
citis, and it became absolutely necessary
that my holiday should be postponed.
The senior partner suggested a fortnight
in October instead. I need hardly say
that I was thunderstruck. An earth- |
quake or a sudden
eruption of Vesuvius
could not have disturbed me more. When
the first shock was over there was
nothing for it but an enquiry as to the
autumn prices of lodgings in Southend.
Yet, though the body is still in
London, my heart is in beautiful
Switzerland, and I can truly say that

II.-A WEEK IN WonderFUL LoNDoN.
[Mr. Joshua Cobble. The Cottage,
Marsh Mallow.]
On arriving in London my first busi-
ness was to call at the Punch office and
learn the full details of this great Holi-
day Competition. [We were very glad
to see Mr. Cobble.—ED.] I accordingly
drove there in a taxicab, feeling that my
knowledge of London did not justify me
in trying to find my way to Bouverie
Street on foot. In less than an hour
I had all the information which I de-
sired, and had decided at once to enter
my name as a competitor.
London is a remarkable town. For
myself I am
never tired of looking at it;
and I feel that even if I had stayed
longer than a week I should still not
have discovered all that there is to
know about it. To describe everything
that I saw would take too long; the
most I can do is to take one day, such
as Tuesday, and let it stand as a sample
of the rest of the week.
Tuesday, 9.0 A.M. Made my way to
Earl's Court station on the underground,
where I took a ticket for Charing Cross.
9.30—10.15. While waiting for train,
tried the moving staircase. A very
clever arrangement.
10.15–11.0. Watched the numbers
appear on the notice-board of the trains.
Most ingenious.
11.5. Got on train for Charing Cross.
11.30. Arrived Ealing.
11.30—11.45. Watched moving ad-
vertisements on Ealing platform.
12.20 P.M. Arrived Charing Cross.
12.30. In the underground passages
of Charing Cross.
2.10. Returned to daylight. Lunched
heartily at A.B.C. in Trafalgar Square.
3.0. Some soldiers appeared in the
Square and marched down Whitehall.
Hastily left A.B.C. and followed them
to their barracks opposite one of the
parks.
3.40. Returned and spoke to a police-
man. Most interesting.
4.0–4.15. Crossed Trafalgar Square.
4.20. Re-entered underground and
took ticket for Mansion House.
4.20–4.30. Watched numbers on
notice-board. Very clever idea. Got
on train for Mansion House.
5.10. Arrived Richmond.
6.0. Arrived Mansion House. Dined
leisurely.
8.0. Watched whisky and tea adver-
tisements.
10.0. Entered train for West Ken-
sington.
10.40. Arrived Wimbledon.
This is only a sample. After a whole
week I can say, that I enjoyed my
holiday thoroughly, and I shall have
plenty to tell the wife when I get back
to Marsh Mallow. I have only had
one real disappointment, and that was
when I went
to see the Latin races
at Shepherd's Bush. London is an
expensive place to stay in, and I had
hoped to get something back over these
races; but they were evidently over by
III.-A WALKING Tour IN GERMANY.
[Mr. Albert Moss,
Pocklington Towers, Streatham.]
I started from Sprockenspitz on
the Monday, and after three hours'
steady walking arrived at Brockenbitz.
Brockenbitz is a delightful place; I
remember it well.
A short rest here was necessary, and
then I proceeded to Pilsenschwarz
(2 m.), where there is a post-office and
an English church, besides numerous
hotels. The population is something
over 1,200 and the town lies in a
delightful situation. Having accom-
plished nearly nine miles since break-
fast, I decided to rest here for the night.
Next morning I left for Teufelwetter,
a village some six miles distant. My
(< */

memories of Teufelwetter
are unfortunate, and I may say at once
that I was greatly disappointed with
the place. I pushed on as hurriedly as
possible to Dortchen (3 m.), passing
over a well-known gorge (whose name
I have forgotten) on my way. Dortchen
contains a post-office and an English
church, neither of which, however, I
entered. There are numerous shops,
and the roads appear to be well-kept;
the surrounding scenery also is deserv-
ing of attention. At Dortchen I
remained for several days,

and it was not until the following
Monday that I continued on my way
towards Bummelkursaalbrocken. This
is a medium-sized village some five
miles away, and I arrived there about
noon. The place is much visited
by travellers, containing as it does a
post-office and an English - church,
while there is a waterfall of some
celebrity in the neighbourhood. I did
not have time to visit this, being some-

detained after lunch
for several hours; and it was not until
the next day that I finally reached
Stiltzburg (5 m.), from which place I
took train home to England.
IV.-A SPORTING TRIP TO THE
HIGHLANDs.
[Mr. Gus Montmorency,
The Eyrie, Maida Vale, N.W.]
Duncan McGooghly has always been
one of the boys. We were at Corpus
together for a term ; we go every week
to the dear old Gaiety together; we
often drop in at Oddenino's for a grilled
bone after painting the town red. Dear
old Dunky—
a thorough sportsman,
if ever there was one. When he asked
me up to his little place in the Trossachs
last June, I threw up all my other
engagements, cut Lady Fluffie's little
dinner dance, told my man to pack my
gun-case and fishing-tackle, and caught
the night train up to Perth. There
was no need to take my hunters along
with me, as I knew I could rely on
Dunky for a mount if we wanted a day
with the hounds.
My host met me with the cob and
in no time. Old McStymie, the head
gillie, greeted me at the gates as we
drove up with, “Hoots, it's the braw
laddie herself, dinna fash the noo,”
to which I replied with a cheery,
“What hol” He will never forget

“Well, Gussie, old sport,” said
Duncan McGooghly to me next morn-
ing at breakfast, “what would you like
to do to-day ?”
“What's on ?” I said, helping myself
to another whisky-and-soda.
“You can have a day with the
grouse,” he said; “I’ve been keeping
the home coverts specially for you.
Or would you rather flog a stream for
salmon?”
“I think, dear old fellow,” I said,
“I’ll flog a stream,” and I bit the
end off a Corona. “Are the little
beggars rising?”
The fish, it seemed, were in splendid
condition, and so we lost no time in
getting to work. Barely had I com-
menced whipping the stream when
I got a bite,
and in a second a magnificent sixty-
pounder was at my feet. I am one of
those old - fashioned sportsmen who
prefer their fishing mixed. I like to
wander out with a rod, a fly and a
retriever, and pick up what I can.
Luck was in my way that morning and
at the end of the day my bag consisted
of three salmon, twenty brace of trout,
four dozen perch, a pike and a couple
the natives when we came in with the
spoil.
“The Harriers are meeting here this
morning,” said Duncan next day at
breakfast. “Would you care to go
out 2."
“I haven't a gee,” I said, as I
squirted some soda into a glass.
“I can give you a mount,” he said.
“Good man,” I answered.
It was on a fine raw-boned flea-bitten
grey that he mounted me, with careful
instructions to ride him on the snaffle.
We drew Sporran Wood first, and
hounds put up a fine hare, scent being

puss doubled,
but I headed her off, and she soon had
the whole field streaming after her, the
kill taking place at Breek's Beeches
after twenty minutes of the best.
“Dunky, old sport,” said I, as we
walked our tired nags home, “London
can show us nothing like this.”
TO THE GENTLE READER ONLY.
HERE our holiday pages end;
So, before the last is done,
Let me beg a boon, my friend—
See, ’tis but a little one :
Ere you leave the breathless city
For the scents of mead and moor—
Give a thought, for love and pity,
To the children of the poor.
Ere you sit, o' summer nights,
Where the sea has much to say,
Walk the woodlands, climb to heights
Washed by all the winds at play;
Ere you thrid the watered valleys
With your own, a merry troop—
Don't forget the stifling alleys
Where the other children droop.
, Would you make within your heart
Brighter yet the golden hours,
Calling these to have their part
In the gathering of the flowers?—
Ere you leave the sombre city
For the green ways, soft and sunned,
Please to send, for love and pity,
Something to the FRESH AIR FUND.”
O. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtEACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.)
Monday, July 8.-No one regarding
the slim, tall, well-groomed Minister
standing at the Table addressing a list-
less, half-empty House, would imagine
he was moving the Second Reading of a
Reform Bill containing potentiality of
adding to the electorate two-million-
and-a-half males, ten-million-and-a-
half females. Appearance of House on
such momentous occasion faithfully
reflects attitude of public outside. No
thronged public meetings have sternly
recommended Bill to favourable con-
sideration of Legislature. Not a park
paling has fallen. Reason for notable
state of things obvious. No one believes
in reality of Ministerial intention to
pass the Bill this Session.
If such conclusion of the matter
were desired or meant, it is physically
impossible. With full length of average
Session practically run, there remain
two great measures, either sufficient
of itself to form the background of a
Session. House will sit into New
Year, or to March, if necessary. But
the time so appropriated will not prove
too much to dispose of the Home Rule
Bill, of which one clause has been
passed in Committee, the Welsh Dis-
establishment Bill, not yet in Com-
mittee, and a Bill abolishing Plural
Voting, fragment of the bulkier measure
discussed to-night.
Wherefore then this apparently de-
liberate waste of precious time 2 Why
this hauling up of empty buckets from
dried-out wells?
Answer is found in the old
injunction, Cherchez la femme.
PREMIER, distraught amid divided
counsels, hemmed in by conflicting
sections of party, gave a pledge
that a straight issue on question
of Woman Suffrage should be
provided in Reform Bill. By-
and-by we shall get into Com-
mittee; the fateful amendment
opening door to addition of ten-
million-and-a-half women to the
electoral register will be moved;
it will be negatived; a pledge will
have been fulfilled, a troublesome
question temporarily got rid of,
and the Reform Bill having played
its part in the little game will be
dropped—all but the principle of
the abolishment of Plural Voting.
Meanwhile LULU, seductive in
his Sunday clothes, speaking in
level conversational tone at speed
unchecked by obstacle of a single
comma, commends the measure
to favourable consideration of
some empty Benches and here

ment declining to proceed with it.
Tuesday.-House emptier even than

when Reform Bill was under discussion.
Difficult to muster a quorum; increas-
ing trouble in keeping it in hand.
Fact is House has adjourned to Spit-
head to inspect the British Navy.
Whilst excursion was looked forward to
with pleasurable anticipation proper
to a picnic, it was not without mis-
giving that Members committed their
precious lives to custody of a ship.
Yesterday anxious inquiries addressed
to Admiralty as to precautions taken
against disaster. Would provision be
made, it was asked, for a sufficient
number of lifeboats, rafts and other
appliances for the safety of Honourable
Members ?
MACNAMARA able to give required
assurance. Still there was hesitation.
How about priority of Members taking
their places in the boats in case of
disaster ?
As this question was put, Members
below Gangway on both sides cast
distrustful glances on occupants of
two Front Benches facing the Table.
It is a favourite axiom with the Private
Member that when the two Front
Benches agree upon a current question
there is mischief ahead. Suppose in
case indicated they were to agree upon
their right of priority to take to the
boats, what would become of Private
Members, some of them fathers of
families?
As it happened these premonitions
proved superfluous. All went well, and
Members have returned prepared to
vote any Supplementary Naval Esti-
mates that may be asked for.
Feeling personal interest in
measure delicately entitled Mental
Deficiency Bill, set down as prin-
cipal business for to-day, I did not
go to Spithead. SARK, who was
of the company, reports complete
success of expedition. The Ad-
miralty, their intent spurred by
what took place in the House
yesterday, exceeded their original
provision for the safety of Mem-
bers. On boarding the Armadale
Castle Members of both Houses
of Parliament were equipped with
lifebelts, which they retained
throughout the voyage, tempo-
rarily disrobing for luncheon.
SARK, not constitutionally emo-
tional, not habitually exuberant
in language, much impressed by
spectacle of Lord HALSBURY, girt
by lifebelt, scanning the far-flung
line of battleships. Says he
never before realised the might
and real kingliness of Neptune.

frenzy rolling perceives much hidden
from gaze of ordinary man.
Business done.—After all, Mental
Deficiency Bill not reached, House
being with difficulty kept sitting till
7.30. Got a couple of useful small
measures over a stage.
Friday.—Dead set against HoME
SECRETARY made from Opposition
Benches continues. Daily finds issue
in cunningly-contrived questions de-
signed to put him in the wrong.
McKENNA a hard nut to crack. Sup-
plementary Questioners and others do
not get much change out of him.
JEssel, recently found this out when he
attempted to show that last year the
Home Office had saddled Metropolitan
ratepayers with cost of 500 members
of Metropolitan police force sent to
Hull in aid of local police. Wanted
to know what HoME SECRETARY
was going to do in the matter.
After explaining that the alleged
circumstances took place a year
ago, before he was responsible
for business of the Department,
McKENNA added, “The question
of the Honourable Member is
impertinent.”
Roar expressive of outraged
sense of decency hurtled from
Opposition Benches. Half-a-
dozen Members sprang to their
feet to ask SPEAKER's ruling if it
was in order to accuse an Hon-
ourable Member of putting an
impertinent question. For them
the word had nothing beyond
its meaning in colloquial use,
defined in New English (Oxford)
Dictionary — a book so seduc-
tive by its literary lore that, when
searching for a word, one pauses
to read a page—as “meddling, abusive,
presumptuous, insolent in speech or
behaviour.”
“I use the word,” McKENNA quietly
added, “in its older sense.”
This reminded House that it had
originally another meaning. In usage
of the law, “impertinent’’ still means
“not pertaining to the subject or matter
in hand, irrelevant.” That, it seems,
was what McKENNA had in mind.
Just as well to have it explained.
This done, storm blew over as rapidly
as it had arisen. But the badgered,
provokingly smiling HoME SECRETARY
had his retort courteous. In skilful
hands, more blessed than “Mesopo-
tamia" is the word “impertinent.”

TOUCHING THE MATTER IN
QUESTION.
WHEN the room which I and Murray
occupy in chambers is void of briefs, we
go in to our Big Man's room and steal
some of his; partly to occupy ourselves
in perusing them, more to give ourselves
an illusory appearance of business and
prosperity by spreading them on our
table. But even Big Men have their
bad times, and ours has had only one
set of papers this week. That one,
however, we have each read six times;
and I can tell you with authority that
it concerns an omnibus and a policeman.
There are periods of slump at the
Bar when it is necessary to give it up
for good or go to sleep for the moment.
We chose the latter alternative. Murray
dreamt of himself conducting the omni-

bus case with extraordinary ability and
conspicuous success; I deliberated upon
turning the facts into the form of an
occasional contribution to the Chit
Chat columns of the daily press.
Waking first, I put my cogitations
on paper. They bore no resemblance
to the case or anything on earth, but
ran thus:–
“I want,” said Charles, approaching
the Policeman outside Victoria Station
—“I want to go to Hammersmith.”
“Why 2” said the Policeman.
“And what is more, I want to go by
omnibus.”
“By omnibus 2 Are you quite sure
you mean what you say ?”
Charles observed him narrowly. “Yes,”
he declared, “I have thought the matter
out carefully and that is my fired deter-
mination. I apprehend that the vast
majority of people do not go from Victoria
mersmith. For myself, however, I have
a peculiar affection for the Heath.”
“What Heath 2" asked the Police-
man, being greedy of sensational details.
“Hampstead Heath, of course,” said
Charles irritably.
“Then what you really mean is that
!you want to go from Victoria to Hamp-
stead, and not Hammersmith, by omni-
bus " " Charles accepted the correction.
“In that case,” continued the Policeman,
“I will oppose your wishes no further,
and, if you are quite sure that you want
to go by omnibus and you do not think
that the walk would do you more good,
I will no longer stand in your way.”
And he moved off in an Easterly
direction.

Murray woke up second, a bad

me. He put on his pince-nez
(his greatest asset, upon which
alone he relies for his future
success in the profession). Ad-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A REST CURE.
ALFRED, my friend, when late you wrote
From your Arcadian retreat,
Bidding me cast the Bond Street coat,
The patent leather from my feet;
Leave all those labours none may tell,
That bow a conscientious bard,
And take, within your gates, a spell
Of rural rest as my reward;
Worn out, at once I saw in dream
A gently rocking hammock, far
'Neath shady willows by your stream,
And straightway wired you, “Right
you are l’”
And fancy painted, as I packed,
How I should revel at my ease
In scent of haycocks newly stacked,
Wild roses and late strawberries.
Back to the kindly, restful land. . . .
Alas, my dream the first hot day,
You put a pitchfork in my hand
And hauled me out to make that hay !
Five long days now I've fagged about
(Oh, shady side of dear Pall Mall !),
My peaceful dreams all put to rout.
Alfred, how can you deem it well?
This breaking back I might endure,
These fingers in their blistered pain,
But now I've got, I'm pretty sure,
A sunstroke on my simmering brain;
And, lest my premature decease,
Good friend, should be the end of it,
I must give up this rural ease,
Get back to town—and rest a bit.
“It was a grey day made chilly by a sharp
wind, which gathered an edge through being
stropped on the snow-capped ridges of the

“The guns continued to breathe heavily

The judges are unable to separate these

From a paragraph in The Yorkshire

“It was afterwards discovered that the cat
had a litter of chickens near the chicken-run,
and it was the maternal instinct that made her
‘go’ for Reynard.”

THE REVIVAL OF SQUASH-BALL.
It is possible that the present gener-
ation, with its wide-spread infatuation
about golf, cricket, tennis and other
elaborate summer pastimes, will hardly
even know the name of the King of
Games. The real cause of its decline
and fall is to be found in the fact that
Sinclair has been in the Argentine for
the last seventeen years. During the
whole of that time Squash-ball has
been under a cloud. Even the Annual
Tournament fell through shortly after
he went, and the Annual Revision of
the Rules (which is much the most
sporting event in the Squash-ball year)
has not been held since 1895. Last
week's matches were played on an
obsolete register.
But now that Sinclair has come
back, to see him again, porringer in
hand, is to recall the great summer
of 1889, when he and I seceded from
the local cricket club and formed a
committee of experts to consider the
condition of our national game. For
we are only too glad to admit that
Cricket is the father of Squash-ball.
Our original intention was merely to
eliminate the more obvious blemishes
in the game of cricket, such as the
extreme hardness of the ball, the pre-
carious tenure of the batsman, the large
number of players involved, and the
excessive amount of menial labour,
fetching and carrying, which it entails.
For rightly considered the ſie' er is a
mere slave. Thus we arrived at the
main principles of Squash-ball; I mean,
of course, that it shall be played in
an enclosed space with short boundaries
of varying values, with one man a side,
who has eleven successive innings, with
an enormous wicket, counterbalanced
by the accumulative boundary system,
by which you may score as many
boundaries as you can reach in a single
hit by taking in the two sides of an
angle of the wall. A small white ball
and a porringer or broomstick three
feet long were adopted as the standard;
and it was at some of the later Re-
visions that the principle of catching
off walls or roofs or first bounce off
the ground were admitted. This latter
practice has enormously strengthened
the interest in the game, which is now
a blend of all the finer points of Cricket
with the more interesting features of
Fives.
We spent a busy Sunday aſternoon
—Sinclair and I–and at last we came
upon a couple of broomsticks and a
packet of balls in the lumber room.
It was clear from the very first that
the farm-yard provided an almost
perfect pitch—might really have been
whatever in “pricing the boundaries”
(a technical term). We put one on the
cart-shed and the granary, two on the
stable. The shippon, which is on the
off, was valued at three; the hay-shed
(about mid on) at four, and the pig-
sties, barn and straw-houses were
adjudged to be worth five each. A
straight drive full-pitch to the wall of
the hen-house was the only six—it is
up a narrow passage—while a back
cut through the gate-way into the
trough counted three. Sinclair, who
always likes to introduce a little play
of fancy into these laborious details,
insisted on allowing nineteen for the
kitchen chimney; but of course, if you
missed it and went over the roof, you
were out. - -
I certainly was a bit nervous while
Sinclair with a pot of green paint was
marking off the wicket on the white-
washed wall. You see I had no means
of knowing what my servants would
think of this sort of thing. I had been
ten years in the farm, and had striven
to maintain towards them a friendly
but dignified demeanour. This was
bound to be a new aspect of me, so to
speak. I am becoming middle-aged
and might almost be regarded as stout.
I was not at all sure if they would
quite understand or appreciate. It
was all very well for Sinclair.
The game began, and I may say at
once that the bowling was atrocious.
A rigid couise of practice at the nets
must clearly be undertaken if we are
ever to recover our pitch. But the
batting, on the other hand—to our
extreme delight — had lost nothing
whatever of its old freedom and vigour.
Sinclair (who had won the toss) amassed
no fewer than twenty-six off my first two
overs without loss of a wicket, chiefly
by clean powerful drives to the hay-
shed. I got him out however. All
the last seven men were l.b.w. He
had really made the wicket too wide.
But his score was 117, and the light
was already ſailing when I went in.
Mine was an eventful innings. Off the
first ball I nearly killed a cockerel in
the slips, and in the following over I
had a beautiful square cut which
resulted in a dead loss of three gallons
of milk. But it is notoriously no use
crying over that when it is spilt, and I
went on to cause a panic among my
cart-horses by pulling a wide long-hop
through the stable window. My big
hitter however was brilliantly caught
in the third over off the turnip cutter,
and after that something of a rot set in.
I was perhaps a little distracted by
considerations of the attitude of my
farm staff. It was a great evening for
thers. The ploughman took up a

the shippon with a pipe in his mouth,
intensely enjoying the spectacle, and
the two boys, with the Briton's innate
love of sport, appeared to tumble to it
at once as being all in the day's work.
One took up a position at cover point
—saving two—and had to be persuaded
to desist; while the other did some
fine retrieving work on the railway.
The ploughman's little girl insisted on
going long-stop on the top of the wall
(which was, of course, most irregular)
with a basket.
Meanwhile the dairy-maid, who was
milking at the time, ran back and forth,
whenever her duties necessitated it, in
open terror and squealing as she went.
And I do not know that she was far
wrong, for I always score freely on the
off side. The dogs barked wildly. It
was by no means a peaceful game.
Well, he got me out for forty-nine.
But the light was getting bad. My
foreman had already kindly placed the
stable lantern on the wall before the
last wicket fell.

Cayley. I'm scarcely as anxious as
all that. Say: “Having come here to
make you listen.”
Walter (injured). When a fellow's in
trouble . . . -
Cayley. He goes to Uncle for money.
That's supposed to be the raison d'être
of uncles. They're to be automatic
machines where you put a Thank-you
in the slot and out drops a fiver. But
that 's not my specialty. Long ago I
decided to specialise in the giving of
advice—an inexpensive, useful hobby.
Walter. A fiver would be no earthly
use to me. I'm in a deuced deep hole.
Things reach a crisis to-day.
Cayley. Gambling?
Walter (reluctantly). Well, I sup-
pose straight-laced people would call it
gambling.
Cayley. Tips straight from the stable?
Walter (eagerly). That's just it. A
man I met—helped him in a race-course
row—told me of a dead sure thing.
Said he had inside information. Seemed
a decent straight fellow, and I took his
word for it. Hang it all, when you pull
a man out of a crowd of roughs at the
expense of your own top-hat and a new
suit, surely you can expect him not to
play you dirt 2 So I took his word and
plunged into it up to the neck.
Cayley. That's a dodge I've not yet
met. I must add it to my collection.
The gang stages a row, and when some
rash young sportsman rushes to the
rescue they plant him with one of those
“dead sure things.” Very neatl . . .
Of course you entrusted him with your
playing a low-down game on him. In
the third place, you've no right to
gamble on race-courses. You may
know something about horses, but you
know nothing about men, and race-
course gambling is taking chances on
men. .
Walter. In the fourth place, it wasn't
betting on horses at all.
Cayley (taken aback, but recovering
himself). That only makes it worse.
. . . Stock Exchange 2
Walter. Mining shares. He told me
to buy a block of them on margin, as
. much as I could shoulder—said they
were dead sure to go up. There was to
be a “rig" in them. Said the people
he knew were out to “squeeze the
bears,” or something like that, and the
shares were to go sky-high presently.
I believed him, and went to the broker
he recommended. The brutes have
fallen steadily, and the beast told me
yesterday that he wouldn't carry over
for me any longer. To-day's carrying-
over day, you know.
Cayley. Which beast 2
Walter. The broker. . . . I'm landed
with three thousand of the brutes, and
of course I can't afford to take them
up; and I can't pay the differences.
Cayley. In the first place, you've no
right to gamble on the Stock Exchange.
On your own showing you don't know
a bear from an Ostend rabbit. In the
second place, you've no right to tackle
mining shares; mining shares are no
meat for babes. In the third place,
you've no right to go a bull of any-
thing. (With the earnest conviction of
the system man.) All the beginners
and foolish little dabblers on the
Exchange buy for a rise. They run in
a flock like woolly baa-lambs. Eve
now and again the big men behind the
market scare the sheep to pen, and
then the shearing begins. No, bulling
is a dabbler's game. The only rule—
my rule—is to be a permanent bear,
then you're on the side of the big man
behind the market. Now in your case
you're one of the silly woolly baa-

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
DURING debate on the Home Rule Bill of 1893 Mr.
GLADSTONE, recurring to the Union of Great Britain and
Ireland, startled the House of Commons by the declaration
that there was “no blacker or fouler transaction in the
history of mankind.” The statesman who twice attempted
to invest Ireland with a Home Rule Parliament was
suspect. LECKY, most loyal of Unionists, in the front rank
of historians, declared that accomplishment of the Union
was made possible only by the fact that “the virus of
corruption extended and descended through every fibre and
artery of the political system.” Mr. McDonNELL BoDKIN,
in relating the history of Grattan's Parliament (FISHER
UNwiN), deals at some length with this episode of history.
Coming out just now, the book, result of profound study of
annals of the time, is opportune. I am not quite certain that
it is designed in favour of the resuscitation of a Parliament
on College Green. If it be, it is much more damaging to
the Bill now before the House of Commons than are the
speeches of Sir EdwańD CARSON or the ejaculations of
Captain CRAIG and Mr. Moore. GRATTAN himself cal-
culated that of those who voted for the Bill and enacted
the Union “not more than seven were unbribed.” In
order to procure a majority, three millions of money were
distributed, twenty promotions were made in the Irish
peerage, twenty-nine new peerages were created, and six
English peerages conferred upon owners of borough seats
“Jockey of Norfolk,” Ireland was bought and sold. For
Irishmen it is a pitiful memory that it was their own
countrymen who shamelessly made the bargain possible.
In his narrative of proceedings in GRATTAN's Parliament
Mr. BoDKIN cites several passages from speeches, notably
GRATTAN's own, which mark the highest style of Parlia-
mentary eloquence. The value of a book full of interest
for the reader of to-day is augmented by reproduction of
some thirty portraits of men who at this critical epoch
helped to make a new history for Ireland.
If a body kiss a body in the dark, and a body, so far from
crying, look upon the incident as a not unpleasant jest;
and if, upon recognition later in the full light of day, there
is neither confusion on the one side nor even pretence of
resentment on the other, but instant love on both, surely
there is no reason for three hundred pages of delay ?
Damosel Croft (STANLEY PAUL) fails to show cause why
Toby, in such circumstances, should hang back and
allow his less dashing rivals to try their several lucks
meanwhile. True, Jamey was no mere serving wench, as
originally supposed, but the highly respectable daughter of
a local yeoman family, and something of an heiress to boot;
but no importance was attached to this; the argument of
the book is that, though townsfolk may hanker after formal
introductions and cavil about settlements, to the honest
countryman there is only one pertinent question to be
discussed before marrying, and that is, have the parties a
mutual mind to do it? I can only account for Toby's

whose votes were transferred to the Government. Like

he knew that there were no contingent complications to
postpone the happy issue, and was fortified in his altruism,
no doubt, by the feeling that the other starters, a local
dullard and a second-rate Londoner, were never really in

his own happiness, but thank him for his kindness in
promoting mine. For the company was very good to meet,
and their quaintly idiomatic conversation a pleasure to hear.
Mr. R. MURRAY GILCHRIST imports Timothy Molyneur,
popular author and noxious egoist, into his homely atmo-
sphere, largely, I think, in order to scoff at novelists with
wide circulations. Let me warn him that, if he will put a
little more stuff into his stories and continue writing in
this attractive strain, he will be in jeopardy himself of
achieving a vogue.
My feeling about The Sign (MACMILLAN) is mainly
that it has outgrown its strength. In other words, Mrs.
RoMILLY FEDDEN has spoilt what might have been a
powerful short story in the -
attempt to stretch it into
a novel. It is a strange and
interesting little study of a
phase of what is, technically
speaking, morbid psy-
chology—a term which we
all know can be used to
explain almost anything.
Here it treats of what might
be called the strange case
of Mónik. It is dedicated
“to the painter who told
me the story;" and, as a
matter of fact, I seem to
remember hearing that
something very like it did
actually take place, not long
ago. Mónik was a Breton
peasant girl, upon whose
imagination the sinful state
of the countryside worked
so powerfully that she vowed
herself to be crucified in

the scent of thyme and myrtle and lentisk bushes, golden
and purple and green with the fruit of lemons and mul-
berries and figs, rich and beautiful and godlike in the fresh-
ness of its light and colour and sound. Eye and ear
rejoiced as I learnt to love the purity and delicacy of the
sweeping lines of its sunny bay, the blue of its seas and
skies, the gleaming white of its houses, the green of its slim
cypress trees and the soft curves of its pines, or listened for
the liquid tinkle of the goat-bells on the mountains, the
persistent chirp of the tettix, and all its other unfamiliar
sounds. Of a certainty this little island set in the Gulf of
Aegina, close to the Peloponnesian coast, forty miles across
the sea from the Piraeus and Athens, was a dream of beauty.
But for all that I didn't expect to enjoy my stay there one
bit. I know better now. I have sat with the women filling
their pitchers at the fountain, and joined in the gossip of
the market-place till the faces and thoughts of these simple
islanders are real to me; because I have been told by a
woman with a rare giſt of sympathy how the hearts of
mothers and lovers in Poros
ache, and how sickness and
separation and death and
cruelty and ingratitude, and
even the sterner tragedies
of murder and suicide,
disturb the quiet current of
their lives. All the stories
are sad, though not all of
them have unhappy endings;
|but the manner of their
telling reflects the beauty
of the island, and they are
not quite like anything that
* I have read before.
It would be a churlish
spirit indeed that could cavil
at the collection of reprints
published by SwiFT under
the title of Leaves of Prose.
With the exception of two

CLAIR, they are essays from
the village square as a sacrifice; with the result that, when
she was dying (of consumption, I gathered), marks became
visible in her hands, and she herself was found stretched
at daybreak in the market-square, “as if upon her
cross. . . .” This is the whole story. Not exactly a
pleasant one, you perceive, nor one easy to tell without
offence. To do Mrs. FEDDEN justice, the only objection
that can be urged against her way of treating it is that
the interest is a little hard to sustain, especially in the
subordinate passages with which she has had to fill
out her book. Some of the minor characters, however,
are well drawn; the best being the egoistical genius
|Walden, the head of the little artist-band, whose life
and thought are effectively contrasted with those of the
Breton folk amongst whom they work. Of course the
tale is sad, no one would object to that; the trouble is
that it is occasionally also dull, and that it need not have
been.
There is no golf in Poros, and no sport and no casino;
hardly anything, in fact, in which the heart of the ordinary
Englishman rejoices when he takes his journeys abroad.
And when I began to read Tales of a Greek Island
(CoNSTABLE), by JULIA D. DRAGoUMIs, I felt, for all my
the pen of ANNIE MATHEson, and they are prefaced by the
most meticulous expression of gratitude that I have ever
seen in a publisher's note. Not content with acknowledging
the courtesy of the periodicals under whose auspices these
leaves first burgeoned, Mr. SwiFT bows his thanks to the
living authors who have been occasionally quoted by the
essayist, and to those holders of copyrights who guard
the privilege of citation from the glorious dead. The range
of this anthology, if I may use the word of leaves, is con-
siderable, for it comprises literary and sociological criticism
as well as vignettes of people and places, and, in the teeth
of its own title, a considerable number of laurel sprigs has
crept in amongst the less pretentious foliage. Many of
the compositions are well and all are pleasantly written,
though I discover an occasional triteness, as when in
“Thyrsis in a London Square,” a very short essay, the
writer feels it necessary to quote twenty-five of the best-
known lines of The Scholar Gipsy. But, since it must
have been this kind of thing that prompted the preliminary
paean of thanksgiving from Mr. Swift, I refuse to complain.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
THE PAssING OF THE SEASON.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE, -The jangled
nerves caused by the Sturm und Drang
of town this summer have made rest-
rooms absolutely. People who've come
rushing in from two bazaars, a flower-
show, a dog-show, three concerts and
several garden-parties, just fly off to
their rest-rooms and throw themselves
flat down among cushions. You care-
fully extract all the expression from
your face, make your mind a blank,
as far as possible—if you must think,
think of nothing but dull grey things,
and dull mauve things, and oval things
(oval is wonderful for jangled nerves!)
—and stay so till you have to get up
and wrestle with your evening engage-
ments. The rest-room must be quite
quite restful. There must be nothing
to look at—nothing with any shape in
it. Everything must be neutral and
vague and undefined. If there are any
pictures, they must be pictures of
nothing in particular, they must be
oval, they mustn't have any frames,
and must just blend into the walls;
the walls and draperies must just
blend into the ceiling, and the low,
wide, neutral-tinted couches must just
blend into the floor. If there are any
chairs, they must have neither backs
nor legs and must blend into whatever
is near them. Some people, when in
their rest-rooms, have an old-fashioned
hurdy-gurdy played a long way off, and
say it gives a feeling of remoteness and
dreaminess that helps them immensely.
No pets at all are allowed in the
rest-room—with the one exception of
dormice, and these, though they blend
in quite nicely with a rest-room, are,
as pets, just a bit inadequate |
good many people have gone
already to their yachts in the Solent.
Some of them have been complaining
about the Fleet having been there,
filling up the place, and making a
noise and turning the water oily.
They say it was too bad to assemble
the Fleet and inspect it just where the
yachting people go to enjoy themselves.
Ninny follyott goes farther still, and
says it was “rotten bad form ' "
Ray Rymington's first play, Human
Beings, is a succès fou—that's to say,
Everybody and Nobody both crowd to
see it. There's a married couple in it,
and a man, and some people, and
the situations are rather new, and, I
believe, are highly disapproved of by
those who go oftenest to see it! It's
the funniest thing, my dear, to hear
Ray tell how he came to write a play.
He sat down one day to write poetry
fountain pen, scribbling idly with it
and scarcely thinking of what he was
doing. When he looked through what
he'd scribbled, he saw that it shaped
something like a play, so he split it
into Acts, wrote “Curtain'' at the end
just for a joke, put it in his pocket,
and forgot all about it. He evidently
dropped it in the street, for the next
thing that happened was a letter from
the manager of the Doric, saying it
had been picked up near the theatre
and brought to him, that immediately
on reading it he had put it into
rehearsal, and it would be produced
at once. When the interviewing people
came bothering Ray, asking him what
his plans are, and what's the way to
write a successful play, he tells them
he has no plans, and the way to write
a play seems to be to sit down with
the intention of writing something else,
or, better still, with no intention at all !
The rage for the Middle Ages this
summer has left traces behind it that
won't easily be got rid of. A good
many who are just rushing off for
their cures will have to have special
treatment this year for Elizabethan
face, mediaeval back, and all sorts of
new horrors Among the men, Lord
Clarges, Jack and Dick Flummery,
and several others, will have to go to
Krankenbad to have high-frequency
electric baths for helmet-head and
tournament-toe And the mischief
doesn't stop there. Sad to say, our
speech is affected, and we find ourselves
involuntarily using all sorts of queer,
high-ruffed, long-waisted expressions.
For instance, the other day, when
Norty's schoolboy brother was cheeking
him, instead of his usual, “Shut your
head, young 'un, or I'll punch it,”
Norty actually said, “Go to, Sir Boy!
Od's bodikins and marry come up,
thou art over malapert!”
And now, my dearest and best, to
tell you of something that's made me
so angry and disgusted that I feel I
must go away and live in a tub, like
Sophocles—or was it Socrates ? I
always mix those two up.
Yesterday the Haviland boy came
to say good-bye before leaving town.
He brought me some flowers and a
gold and jewelled manicure - set for
darling Pompom, and I gave him some
parting words of wisdom, telling him
he must see, and think, and all that
sort of thing, for himself; that, in short,
he must try to make life an inde-
pendent trip, not a personally conducted
tour ! He hung about and kept on
thanking me for having been so good
to him, and taken him about, and
shown him the ropes, and he asked if
Josiah and I would go down to Havi-
lessons ! Haven't you learnt yet that
husbands and wives are not invited
together ?” And he laughed and said
he 'd forgotten, and then he went back
to the coda and began thanking me
again, till I stopped him with, “That's
enough, my dear boy. It's admitted
I have done a good deal for you.
Probably no other woman could have
got you out of the Manoeuvrer camp
that time. If it hadn't been for that
daring rescue the Widow Manoeuvrer
would certainly have planted one of
her twins at Haviland Park by this
time !” “Please don't speak of it so,
Cousin Blanche,” he said, stammering
and fidgetting. “I — I felt such a
champion rotter after that party! I—
I hated to think of it. And when,
after the first little coldness, Lady
Manoeuvrer forgot and forgave, I felt
a still bigger rotter. You must own
it was awfully decent of her, Blanche—
it—it was noble / " I looked at him
in surprise: “The Widow Manoeuvrer
would only have made herself ridiculous
by quarrelling with you, and she'd
have simply committed social suicide
by quarrelling with me and risking my
cutting her and deserting her parties.
I'm like the star or something in
SHAKSPEARE that draws a third of
Heaven after it.”
“I — I wish you'd do her more

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PAMELA AT THE TELEPHONE.
I AM not sure that I am going to
continue our telephone. If, as seems
to me to happen with extraordinary
frequence, Pamela gets put on to a
wrong number, she will stand for hours
misleading the people the other end,
pretending to take their orders (if they
think she's a shop), accepting invita-
tions to dinner from perfect strangers,
inventing bulletins from invalids to
anxious enquirers, or assuring an irate
householder that the plumber shall be
round in ten minutes at the latest.
She has no moral qualms about her
behaviour. “You see, Dick,” she said
to me the other day when I expostulated,
“to get as much fun out of the tele-
phone as you possibly can is the only
way of getting even with the amount
of aggravation you have to put up with
from it.” And when I said something
about confusion being worse con-
founded she asked me not to swear in
front of her. I was glad, therefore, to
hear her getting some of her own back
when I was sitting writing the other
day while she was on her knees beside
the telephone at my elbow.
“Oh, are you the riding-school 2"
she began. “I want the riding-school.”
“My dear girl,” came back a lazy,
good-natured voice quite audible to me,
“how can I be the riding-school 2 I'm
in bed. In bed with flu. Beastly pains
all over me from head to foot. Feel
a perſect worm. You simply couldn't
have rung up anyone who felt less like
a riding-school. No, don't apologise.
I like it. It's awfully dull being cooped
up here all day. Do talk to me a
little. Tell me about yourself. Are you
only just beginning to ride 2 Are you
going to pay your Insurance Tax 2 Do
you like caviare 2 I've just had a lot
sent me and I hate it. Shall I send
it on ? You sound so jolly, I should
love to. I say, are you dark or fair 2
I mean, it's so dull not knowing.”
A gurgle of delight escaped Pamela.
“Oh, with a laugh like that, of course
you've got ripping grey eyes, and the
sort of hair that “escapes’ from under-
neath a large shady hat. It curls up
quite tight in a sea-mist too. I know
that sort.”
I burst into a loud laugh.
remarkably good shot.
“I say, what on earth's that ? That
noise, I mean.” -
“Oh, that,” said Pamela—“that 's
my husband laughing. He 's sitting
next to me and is rather enjoying you.”
“Your husb Oh, I say. You
might have told me before.” -
“Why? It's so nice our both know-
ing you. I almost feel I could ask you
It was a
“I wish you would. I'd come like
a shot. Well, if you must go, good-bye.
I hope you'll mistake me for the riding-
school again soon. Au revoir.”
“I wish you hadn't laughed so soon,
Dick," she said, as she rather regret-
fully put the receiver back. “He might
have gone on much longer, and it was
being rather fun.”
About a week later we were dining
with Pamela's godmother, Lady Sophie
Lamb. As Lady Sophie's one form of
conversation is a tirade against the
manners of the present generation and
the inventions of the last fifty years,
I didn't feel very happy when young
Campbell asked her if she was on the
telephone.
“Certainly not l” said Lady Sophie
severely. “I have never been able to
see the attraction of paying £6 10s. a
year to be at the mercy of anyone with
2d. in his pocket. Life under modern
conditions is complex enough without
that.”
“What a funny way of looking at it,
Aunt Sophie,” broke in Pamela on the
other side. “You miss no end of fun.
For instance, the other day I got on to
the wrong person by mistake. You
see, you can say anything in those
circumstances. They'll never know
who you are. I remember I asked
him to dinner. Or did he invite him-
self? I forget. Aren't you going to
have any caviare, Captain Campbell?
How nice of you ! Then I can take
your bit as well as my own. I adore
it. By-the-by, my telephone man
offered to send me some. I wish I
knew him.” -
Something had suddenly happened
to Campbell. He was a bright scarlet,
and was staring open - mouthed at
Pamela. He is a shy young man, and
I probably shouldn't have thought
much of it but that he was looking in
such a very odd way at her hair.
Afterwards he confided in me, and I
have promised not to enlighten Pamela.
“You see, I'm not a bit like that
really, Molyneux,” he said, “b–but
through the telephone . . . when you're
bored to tears . . . and, of course, I
never thought I should meet her.”
As I said before, I shall not tell
Pamela.
But it would be nice if he rang her
up one day and continued the conver-
sation.

'Tis not enough that I be laid
Under the lime-trees' scented shade;
'Tis not enough, O Muse, -
That from these hands the heavenly lyre
Must fall, because its strings are fire,
'Tis not enough; I still perspire,
I positively ooze.
'Tis not enough that slaves should fan
My temples, or that Mary Ann
Should fetch me fizzy bowls;
'Tis not enough that I be dressed
In some salubrious kind of vest.
(John Binks's ſad..] is much the best,
It's chiefly made of holes.)
'Tis not enough ; nay, let me leap
In fancy to some snow-topped steep
Or plunge beneath the wave
To grottoes where the mermaids sport,
To Amphitrite's vitreous court,
Where undressed crabs may still resort
And oysters need not shave.
Let me reflect on Northern nights,
On polar-bears and stalactites,
And on the charnel vault;
On the cool pluck that nerves the
frames
Of chaps that win the Olympic games
(They keep the most peculiar names,
But that is not their fault).
Let me perpend on snakes and frogs,
And winter-pastime catalogues,
And frosty days of Yule :
On hurricanes of snow and sleet,
And persons in Throgmorton Street
(Confound them) in this frightful heat
Making their thousands cool.
These be my thoughts, and, if there still
Falls from my brow the unwelcome rill,
Let every lady fair,
Whose face I keep rememberéd,
Up to my leaf-hung haunt be led,
And cut me absolutely dead
With her most Arctic stare.

MEMORY.
“LIFE,” says an ancient philosopher whose words I
remember while I have forgotten his name—“life is not
easily to be conceived without memory, for if we recalled
not past events, building up and buttressing our years with
wisdom drawn from a former unwisdom, how should it
profit us to proceed on our way to the undiscovered
country whither we tend encompassed by the natural
pitfalls of the ground and ambushed about by the designs
of our foes? Nay,” he adds, “in that second and better
life to which we hope in humility to attain, there must be
memory of the first and worse and of a man's deeds
therein, else the good and the bad would be mixed in one
general stream of self-effacing oblivion.”
These are impressive words, and they place memory in
a high position. Yet when I consider my own memory
and note what a feeble thing of shreds and patches it is,
; and how small are the treasures it yields to a careful ex-
| plorer, I begin to doubt. How few and how insignificant
for the most part are the things I remember; how innumer:
able and how important are the things that time and
negligence have wiped out and made as though they had
never been. I test myself by the question, What was I
doing the day before yesterday ? I give you my sacred
word of honour that I cannot for the life of me tell you. At
this moment, barely forty-eight hours afterwards, every-
thing is gone from me as completely as if it had happened
a thousand years ago. And yet there are men (and women
too, for the matter of that) who can go into the witness-
box in court and give a detailed account of what they did
and said and what other women did and said five years
back. Is it genius, or is it merely invention—which
is often the same thing as genius” Certainly it is a
feat that I could not perform. I should say to the
cross-examining counsel, “Have it your own way. I've
done the best I could, but if you say I'm wrong I shall
not contest it. My mind is a perfect blank.” A gentle-
man—and all our cross-examining counsel are gentlemen—
would, I am sure, sympathise with me and let me alone.
Would he himself be able to tell me where he was and what
he was doing at 3.30 P.M. on Thursday of last week.
If I scan what, for want of a better word, I may call the
vista of my earliest years, I can perceive only the most
trivial things. For instance, I see a small plump boy with
a red rose in his hand tottering along a garden path. He
falls down with an imposing crash and is immediately
picked up. I believe I myself was that boy, and yet, if
that be so, it is obvious that I never could have seen
myself in fact as I see myself in my memory, which
represents me quite plainly as a person outside myself,
for I can see my own face as I tumble and begin
to cry. Again—but this must be some years afterwards
—I behold myself sitting on a chair in the gardener's
cottage. I am sucking a bull's-eye presented to me
by the gardener's wife. I have said something to her,
for she laughs and calls me “a little radical.” I under-
stood her to make a complimentary allusion to my-high
capacities for mischief and wickedness. Yet I cannot
remember that she held or expressed any definite views on

sky. If it rains quickly play will be stopped and, the hour
being late, I shall not have to go in. The leaden minutes
pass and so do the promising clouds. There is a shout.
The ninth wicket is down and my dreadful turn has come.
The Captain says, “If you and Rimington can stay in for
ten minutes we shall draw the game. Play as carefully as
you can and take no chances.” I go to the wickets with
an affected jauntiness. I take middle. I look round to see
how the field is placed. I take my position and the
bowler begins his diabolical run. He delivers the ball. I
see it spinning inexorably at me. Thank heaven, it is not
quite straight. It is to the off. It hits my bat, snicks
itself away into the slips, and we run one. There the
curtain drops again, and I cannot even remember with
certainty whether we managed to play out time and draw
the game. I think we did. Why should my memory, I
wonder, insist on presenting this scene 2 There was no
pleasure in it. Such, however, are the futilities of a

THE SLEUTH.
OF the romance of life behind the
scenes in London few men could tell
so thrilling a story as that of Detective-
Inspector Baggem, who yesterday cele-
brated his silver jubilee of active ser-
vice. While Inspector Baggem has
often been taken for the custodian of a
picture-palace in mufti, nobody ever
suspected this quiet unassuming man
(six feet three) of being one of the most
alert and energetic of our detectives.
The Inspector has a number of good
stories to tell of his varied experiences.
“Yes, I have been in some tight
wander home to-
instance, when I arrested the Mulligan
gang single-handed in '94, the other
hand got a nasty bruise on it. Yes,
thanks, it's better now. Mulligan was
one of the most inconsiderate criminals
I have ever had to deal with.”
The part the Inspector played in the
Fairyland Street affair will not readily
be remembered. Disguised as a police-
man he came suddenly upon the un-
suspecting pick-pockets, the arrest of
whom was but the work of a moment.
Then who does not forget the
notorious forger, Checknib? Inspector
Baggem’s share in tracking down this
consummate rogue makes a story too
long to tell in detail here; suffice it to
say, however, that the indefatigable
detective, after a long and interesting
tour through France, Spain and Mor-
occo, arrived at Rio de Janeiro, and,
not finding his man there, went on to
New Zealand, Japan, Ceylon, and so
returned to old England once more,
where he had the satisfaction of learn-
ing that Checknib had just been found
in a Pimlico attic, where he had lain for
months suffering from writer's cramp.
“I shall never forget that journey,” said
the Inspector impressively. “Checknib
got three months, and well he deserved

What TIM HEALY and his rainbow
bandana did in this galley not at first
clear. Secret out later. In disposing
of his realised surplus CHANCELLOR OF
ExchEQUER allotted half-a-million to
providing loan on easy terms for pro-
motion of railways in East Africa.
That touched TIM, bringing back for a
moment something of the truculence
that endeared him to Parliaments dead
and gone. Hereanent flashed forth his
enquiry about the huckster's shop.
“Does the CHANCELLoR of THE Ex-
CHEQUER,” he inquired, sternly regard-
ing LLOYD GEORGE–elate with success
following prolonged effort to get his
feet on the edge of the Table whilst
leaning back on the Treasury Bench,
as PRINCE ARTHUR used to do whilst
Leader of House—“suppose that, if he
had included this proposal in his
Budget, a howl of protest would not
have gone up from Irish Members
against giving this money out of taxes
raised upon their tobacco and whiskey?
Tame cats as some of them have be-
come " (this with glance over his
shoulder at empty benches reserved
for John REDMoND's mute supporters),
“there would have been angry protest.”
Business done.—Second Reading of
Budget Bill moved.
Tuesday.—Many popular aphorisms
cluster round the word Peace. But
none excels the phrase dropped from
lips of HAROLD BAKER when, appearing
at Table for first time in capacity of
Financial Secretary to the War Office,
he defended Territorial Force against
captious critics.
“One thing the Territorials want
more than anything else,” he said, “is
Peace.” -
There you have the whole situation
crystallised in a phrase. Here is our
citizen soldier, to whom preservation of
Empire is to be committed in time of
extremest peril, patriotically giving up
his leisure to training calculated to
prepare him for his task. Whether
under the scorching summer sun or
chilled by the breath of winter he, at
some slight cost to a grateful nation,
prepares himself for the ordeal of War.
And all he wants to complete and
crown a noble career is Peace |
BAKER partly spoiled effect of this
memorable saying by weakly explaining
that what he meant was not peace from
the invader, but from hostile critics
thrusting with pen or tongue. But
House knows when it has got hold of a
good thing, and stuck to the FINANCIAL
SECRETARY's declaration in the simple
sense it bore when spoken.
ARTHUR LEE damped hilarity by
gloomy view of future of Territorial
Force. All very well for them to seek
for the Government and the nation to
take count of possibility of war. As,
speaking at Kennington Theatre the
other day, LLOYD GEORGE (borrowing
unconciously, SARK says, the imagery
of one of John BRIGHT's most famous
perorations) beheld a vision of gloom
passing away from the working man's
home, “the rays of God's sun piercing
the narrowest window,” so (in his
mind's eye, Horatio) ARTHUR LEE be-
held vision of a body of invaders,
seventy thousand strong, marching
upon the Territorials left on guard at
home, and “going through them like a
knife through butter.”
SEELY ridiculed this pessimistic
view. Its enunciation left Committee
more than ever desirous of realisation

of HAROLD BAKER's summing up of
the one thing needful for the happiness
and prosperity of the Territorial Force
—Peace.
Business done.—In Committee of
Supply vote of £2,780,000 for training
and other expenses of Territorial Force
agreed to after interesting debate.
Thursday.—This time five years ago
we still had with us one of those born
and trained soldiers with whom Ireland
enriches the Empire. He was known
in the Army List as Sir John ARDAGH,
Major-General of Royal Engineers.
Among his friends, a wide and varied
circle, he was always called “Military
Ardour.” The man who, had his care-
fully gleaned reports of resources of the
Boers on eve of war in South Africa
been listened to, would have saved the
country from grave peril, is in his grave.
His nom de guerre is revived in House
of Commons in connection with Mem-
War Estimates being to the fore this
-week, MILITARY ARDour. HUNT been
much in evidence. His latest idea is
set forth in question addressed to WAR
SECRETARY. Recalling fact that FIRST
LoRD of THE ADMIRALTY arranged and
carried out inspection by Members of
Parliament of our ships of war in
fighting trim, he proposes that Members
shall now have opportunity of seeing
ten battalions of regular infantry, ten
battalions of the special reserve, and ten
of the Territorial force (it sounds like
instructions for confecting a cocktail),
all to be chosen by lot, the men to carry
a full field-service equipment of 59%lbs.
in weight, march ten miles and then
go through tactical exercises. Does
not mention the detail, but it is under-
stood that if his pleasing suggestion
be accepted he is prepared personally
to take command of the force.
With that chilly demeanour which
is so speedily acquired in office SEELY
curtly answered, “The suggestion will
be borne in mind.” But, as PRINCE
ARTHUR learned at an awkward period
of his leadership of the Opposition,
MILITARY ARDour HUNT is not the
kind of man to be safely snubbed.
Having been at some pains to draw up
his plan of campaign he means us to
hear more of it.
Business done.—Members returning
from Garden Party at Windsor,
SPEAKER took Chair at seven o'clock.
Debate resumed on Second Reading of
Finance Bill. On division majority
run down to 48. “This,” said SARK to
the MASTER of ELIBANK, who, mourn-
ing for his absent men, refused to be
comforted, “comes of your going a-
garden-partying.”
“Ten military men, with rifles, have gone
after Mr. Kuk Chung-sau, a member of the
Advisory Council, with the intention of de-
nouncing him for his recommending Mr. Wan
Chih-chang to be Governor-General of Chihli
province.”—South China Morning Post.
No doubt Mr. CHUNG-SAU will justify
his recommendation with a shot-gun.
“Mr. Gutzen Borglum, the American sculp-
tor, says in a newspaper article, “When I get

people for a suit of his clothes—not a new suit,

ONE of the curious problems which
confronts the delighted visitor to
Rockville is where do all the fair
motorists, who are to be met with at
every turn in their pretty gossamer

garages of gigantic capacity. Mean-
while, rather than tire his brain with
this question, he will be wise to plunge
into the giddy vortex of this popular
Mecca of holiday makers. The sea is

AT THE PLAY.
“HINDLE WAKES.”
HINDLE is a place in Lancashire;
but as for the rest of the title, I never
even made out whether “Wakes” was
a noun or a verb. This was my only
real difficulty in a play of singular
directness and clarity. As a study in
dialect and brogue it bears a superficial
resemblance to the popular Haymarket
comedy; but, as a drama of conflicting
wills and emotions, it is worth ten of
Bunty, because it deals with one of the
universal problems of life and not sim-
ply with the particular idiosyncrasies
of local freaks.
Briefly the story tells how one Alan
Jeffcote, son of a wealthy self-made
cotton-spinner, and engaged to Beatrice
Farrar, daughter of another Lancashire
parvenu (knighted), goes off for a week-
end with Fanny Hawthorn, a mill-hand
in his father's works. The truth comes
out through a tragic breakdown in the
girl's alibi, and Jeffcote pére is informed
of the facts. For two reasons—(1)
because he himself, though Lancastrian,
wears the white rose of a blameless life
and is a stickler for moral obligations,
(2) because the girl's father, though now
in an inferior social position, has been
his friend from the days of early ob-
scurity—he insists, in spite of high
parental ambitions, that his son shall
marry Fanny; otherwise he will cut him
off. But Alan is a spoilt youth, and,
since his heart, as distinguished from
his body, remains true to his betrothed,
he declines this arrangement. Beatrice,
however, though ready to forgive his
infidelity, will not consent to let the
other girl be sacrificed, and throws
him over. Under the general pressure
Alan gives way, and in full conclave
of all the families concerned it is an-
nounced that he is prepared to “make an
honest woman” of Fanny. But Fanny,
the only person not yet consulted,
makes it quite clear that she is not
prepared to make an honest man of
Alan. Left alone with him in order to
worry things out, she assures him with
perfect candour that their week-end
jaunt was a mere matter of amusement
on her part, as on his, and that she had
never cherished any arrière pensée as to
the issue of it. He is not the man she
would choose for a husband and she
absolutely declines to contemplate such
a solution. To the consternation of
the relatives — always excepting Sir
Timothy Farrar who has week-ends
of his own, and Alan's mother whose
moral scruples stop short of the ruining
of her son's career by a mésalliance, he
is left suspended in air. But I gathered
that he counted on Beatrice to cut him
It should be noted, as simplifying
the author's task, that the one element
which is the invincible difficulty in
breaches of the moral code as between
the two sexes is here ignored altogether.
If this deliberate omission escaped the
audience, they might well, in face of
Fanny's own indifference, conclude
that some of the tragedies of life are
tragedies only because our social system
chooses to make them such.

atmosphere is suggested in a few lines
and the situation at once becomes
arresting, down to the novelty of the
unconventional conclusion, every word
tells; every word, even in apparent
digressions, is a contribution either to
the scheme or to the revelation of
character. The humour which so
lavishly relieves the tension of things
is never wanton, never destructive of
the serious interest. Between the
various types, all really of much the same
class, though money has made a differ-
ence, the nicest distinctions are drawn
both in character and manner. Com-
pare, for instance, the dour and de-
termined mother of Fanny with the
comparatively soft and refined mother
of Alan—each full of maternal solici-
tude for her child's career, but mani-
fested how differently.
The acting of Miss HoRNIMAN's
Company was most refreshingly human.
They never troubled about stage tra-
of nature. They were not constantly
shifting their seat or their stance for
fear of boring an audience eager for
“action.” Everybody spoke with the
confidence of people who can afford to
keep still and restful because they know
that what they have to say is worth
listening to. Nat Jeffcote, as he stands
robed in a long dressing-gown and

I Do not know exactly how far I ought to congratulate
Miss KATHARINE TYNAN upon the achievement of this
charming story, Rose of the Garden (CoNSTABLE), because, of
course, the events of her heroine's career and many of her
thoughts needed no invention. Thus it is possible that to
those who are already familiar with the Life and Letters
of Lady Sarah Lennor her tale in novel form may appear
twice told. That is one of the objections to fact masquer-
ading in the guise of fiction, and there are conceivably others
also, but of the fascination of the result in this instance
there can be no question. The author has managed a
delicate and difficult task admirably. Lady Sall, her
husband, and her lover, are all figures that live. Of the
three, the last, Lord William Gordon, is (as was inevitable)
the most elusive. There are some delightful scenes, in the
earlier chapters especially. Sally's childish adventure at
Kensington Palace with the old KING, and the episode of
her being courted by young GEORGE III., are told with an
excellent spirit. Perhaps the author is naturally at her
best in those passages where she can give her imagination
play and become the unfettered novelist. It is a book that
I have greatly enjoyed reading, but one that suggests the
reflection—“Exactly how long ago must real persons have
lived to become fit subjects for a story?" One sees the
limit, but it is undefined. Suppose somebody were to

complicated by a quite gratuitous loyalty to the light-
hearted NELSoN. As a matter of fact Diana had irrevoc-
ably settled on her prey even before the little Post-Captain's
philandering began. It is plain that the ground has been
carefully studied by the author, and I take away a very
clear picture of this early Quebec and the troubled and de-
pressed bearing of those responsible for her. Perhaps Miss
McILWRAITH has been too conscientious with her docu-
ments and had been better advised to give her yarn its
head and let meticulous accuracy go hang. Yet this may
be merely the plaint of the indecently ignorant person not
quite sure just when he enters historical ground or when
he leaves it for the author's romantic and plausible ex-
tensions.
Until I read Mr. H. F. PREVOST BATTERSBY's The Last
comments on the behaviour of the Government in placing
them in their perilous situation. But they were men, one
must remember, who had never gone deeply into politics,
and did not realize that the Party might have lost votes at
the next election had the defence of Magaliland been
permitted to get into the papers as a War.
Appropriately with the news of a recent Government
grant, there reaches me a copy of the new Handbook of
British East Africa (PRAED), compiled by Messrs.H.F.WARD
and J. W. MILLIGAN. While hardly suggesting this as a
volume for the general library list, I have no hesitation in
saying that no one with any interest, vicarious or personal,
in the Protectorate should fail to secure a copy. The in-
formation it contains is nothing less than staggering, and
ranges pleasantly from time-tables to taxidermists. There

Resort (LANE), I had always imagined that a particular type
of muddle-headed mismanagement was confined to the
theatre. But, if Mr. BATTERSBY is to be believed —and he
convinced me—some of the British Empire is run on the
worst musical-comedy lines. When Major Mark Sarrol
wished to get four thousand men from the authorities to up-
hold Great Britain's honour in Magaliland, he found that
in order to do so it would be necessary for him to “get in
with the management,” in other words, to make love to
Mrs. Heseltine, who would then make love to Cyril Meldon,
a member of the Cabinet, who would by these means be
persuaded to look with an indulgent eye on the maintenance
of the country's honour. But the major, who had wasted
his life brawling with Boers and others and was conse-
quently rather bad at this sort of thing, failed to play the
part assigned to him, and went back to fight Vgaz Ghama
and his twenty thousand followers with the handful of troops
he already possessed. The result was some wonderfully
fine fighting, admirably described by the author, and ending,
through the timely arrival of a cruiser, in victory. In the
intervals of beating back attacks, certain members of the

obviously useful phrases as “What are you fighting about?”
and “Stop that noise”; while for many readers the element

gratulations.

LEFT SMILING.
It is the joyful time when out of town
(For me a large red letter checks it)
To sea and loch, to dale and windy down
The public makes its annual exit,
Deeming that they are dotty in the mind
Who choose to stay behind.
“Exodus" is the tag the papers use,
A Scriptural term from ancient Jewry,
But I shall always steadily refuse
To do like PHARAoh in his fury
And fling my horse and chariot on their track
- To fetch the people back.
Poor crowded souls, who think that when they fare
Forth to the briny, there to wallow,
They leave in London's every street and square
An aching void, a yawning hollow. -
“Town,” they observe, “is empty' " It is not :
I still am on the spot. -
They picture Beauty vanished from the Park,
Clubland a waste for flies to buzz in,
The Halls of Song and high Cinema dark,
And here and there a country cousin
Sharing with vagrant cat and mongrel dawg
The putrid dust of Aug. :
These are their views who shun the quiet shade
And go en masse in search of glamour,
Wash in the same sea, walk the same parade,
Fill the same solitude with clamour,
And on the same rock, in a fist like Fame's,
Knife their confounded names.
So let them trip it where their neighbours press
With loud excursion and alarum,
And leave me London in her Summer dress
Exquisite as the lily (arum)
And fragrant with the absence, all too short,
Of the more stuffy sort.
For then, when all the obvious people flit,
The town unlocks her rarer treasures;
More freely, with companions few but fit,
I taste the less obtrusive pleasures
With which the Choicer Spirits keep in touch
-. (As Editors and such).
Dearer I find than any change of scene
The charm of old familiar places,
When the dull obstacle that stood between
Fades and reveals their hidden graces.

FROM PUBLIC TO PRIVATE LIFE.
MoRE CASEs of PROMOTION.
THE action of Sir PERCY GIRouard in resigning the
Governorship of British East Africa for an appointment at
Messrs. ARMSTRONG's has given rise to disquieting rumours.
It is reported that other servants of the State are about to
relinquish their posts and accept situations in commercial
or other unofficial establishments. Thus the HoME SECRE-
TARY is said to have been offered a lucrative engagement as
Shopwalker to the Constabulary Supply Association (strictly
Limited); Mr. LLOYD GEORGE is considering two chances—
a partnership in a well-known Land Agency, and a post as
Fruit-Taster to a famous Jam Factory in the neighbour-
|hood of Limehouse; Colonel SEELY has a prospect of
becoming Head Cutter in an Army Outfitters and Clothiers
Company; Mr. John BURNs is thinking of taking up a post
as Trainer to the Battersea Pugilistic; Mr. LEwis HARcourt
is considering the attraction of an Agency for a well-
established firm of Antiquarians in Wardour Street, and
Mr. RUNCIMAN may at any moment accept the Chair of
Pedagoguy at the Whitehall Kindergarten College.
Lord CREwe is a likely candidate for the situation of
Chef in the Curry Department of the Savoy; Mr. EDMUND
GossE, Librarian to the House of Lords, is being tempted
to become Reader to the Amalgamated Press; Mr. MASTER-
MAN's services are being solicited as Senior Leaflet-monger
to a leading firm in Paternoster Row with a branch at
Wallombrosa; and Mr. CHURCHILL has been pressed to
become Manager of the Dogger Bank Marine Stores
(lately removed from Malta). . . -
Mr. SYDNEY Buxton has been tentatively selected for the
Secretaryship of the Poplar Branch of the A.S.R.S.; Mr.
SAMUEL's success with the Telephone has secured him the
| offer of a remunerative situation with the Ear-Trumpet
and Aural Appliances Association ; the MASTER of
ELIBANK has under consideration the offer of partnership
with the proprietor of a Physical Culture Emporium ; and
Lord HALDANE, if he declines the opportunity of attaching
himself to a certain firm of Theatrical Wig-makers, will
shortly be asked to join the management of the Anglo-
German Mutual Understanding Society (which is about to
be put on a war footing). . . . -
Finally Mr. URE is to be invited to fill the Chairmanship of
a Publishing Company that makes a specialty of Popular
Fiction; and Lord GRANARD, Master of the Horse, has only
to lift his hand to become Confidential Adviser to Messrs.

nest. I picked it up, and said to my sister that we would
have a game of catchball with it. Just as I was going to
throw it to her I heard all at once a awful lot of shouting;
then I see two men in red jackets running to us, one
holding his fist up, and two men behind carrying bags.
The gentleman with his fist up had a very red face, and
he said to me, “You've got my ball, you little beggar.”
I said as I was very sorry, but I didn't know they was
playing. Then he told me to put it back at once in the
very spot where I had picked it up; he said it was a very
important match they was playing. So I went and put
it back in that little round hole. He then looked real savige
at me, and said I hadn't found it in there, but just outside

where I had put it. Then, after a bit, the other gentleman
lifted up a stick what he took from the bag, and he gave
the ball a hard hit that sent it further in. He then said
a very bad word indeed, looked at me, and gave it another
hit. This time it went further in still, and he then walked
away looking wild all round, while the other man smiled
at me kindly. The man with the bag then stooped down and

THE HEIR.
I.—HE INTRODUCEs HIMSELF.
“IN less refined circles than ours,”
I said to Myra, “ your behaviour would
be described as swank. Really, to
judge from the airs you put on, you
might be the child's mother.”
“He’s jealous because he's not
an aunt himself. Isn't he, ducksey
darling?”
“I do wish you wouldn't keep
dragging the baby into the conversa-
tion; we can make it go quite well as
a duologue. As to being jealous—why,
it's absurd. True, I'm not an aunt,
but in a very short time I shall be an
uncle by marriage, which sounds to
me much superior. That is,” I added,
“if you're still equal to it.”
Myra blew me a kiss over the cradle.
“Another thing you've forgotten,”
I went on, “is that I'm down for a
place as a godfather. Archie tells me
| that it isn't settled yet, but that there's
a good deal of talk about it in the
clubs. Who's the other going to be 2
Not Thomas, I suppose? That would
be making the thing rather a farce.”
“Hasn't Dahlia broken it to you?”
said Myra anxiously.
“Simpson 2 " I asked, in an awed
whisper.
Myra nodded.

“Heavens ! Not three of us 2 What
a jolly crowd we shall be. Thomas can

“But of course there are only going
to be two godfathers,” she said, and
leant over the cradle again.
I held up my three end fingers.
“Thomas,” I said, pointing to the
smallest, “me,” I explained, pointing
to the next, “and Simpson, the tall
gentleman in glasses. One, two, three.”
“Oh, baby," sighed Myra, “what a
very slow uncle by marriage you're
going to have ' " -
I stood and gazed at my three
fingers for some time.
“I've got it,” I said at last, and I
pulled down the middle one. “The
rumour in the clubs was unauthorised.
I don't get a place after all.”
“Don't say you mind,” pleaded Myra.
“You see, Dahlia thought that as you
were practically one of the family
already, an uncle-elect by marriage,
and as she didn't want to choose be-
tween Thomas and Samuel n >
“Say no more. I was only afraid
that she might have something against
my moral character. Child,” I went
on, rising and addressing the unrespon-
sive infant, “Lngland has lost a god-
father this day, but the world has
gained a What? I don't know.
“And, of course,
Myra gave the baby a last kiss and
got up.
“Can I trust him with you while I
go and see about Dahlia 2"
“I’m not sure. It depends how I
feel. I may change him with some
poor baby in the village. Run away,
aunt, and leave us men to ourselves.
We have several matters to discuss.”
When the child and I were alone
together, I knelt by his cradle and sur-
veyed his features earnestly. I wanted
to see what it was he had to offer
Myra which I could not give her.
“This,” I said to myself, “is the face
which has come between her and me,”
for it was unfortunately true that I
could no longer claim Myra's undivided
attention. But the more I looked at
him the more mysterious the whole
thing became to me.
“Not a bad kid?” said a voice
behind me. I turned and saw Archie.
“Yours, I believe,” I said, and I
waved him to the cradle.
Archie bent down and tickled the
baby's chin, making appropriate noises
the while—one of the things a father
has to learn to do.
“Who do you think he's like?” he
asked proudly.
“The late Mr. GLADSTONE,” I said,
after deep thought.
“Wrong. Hallo, here's Dahlia
coming out. I hope, for your sake,
that the baby's all right. lf she finds
he's caught measles or anything, you'll
get into trouble.”
By a stroke of bad luck the child
began to cry as soon as he saw the
ladies. Myra rushed up to him.
“Poor little darling,” she said sooth-
ingly. “Did his uncle by marriage
frighten him, then?”
“Don’t listen to her, Dahlia,” I said.
“I haven't done anything to him. We
were chatting together quite amicably
until he suddenly caught sight of Myra
and burst into tears.”
“He 's got a little pain,” said Dahlia
gently, taking him up and patting
him.
“I think the trouble is mental,”
suggested Archie. “He looks to me as
if he had something on his conscience.
Did he say anything to you about it
when you were alone?”
“He didn't say much,” I confessed,
“but he seemed to be keeping some-
thing back. I think he wants a bit of
a run, really.”
“Poor little lamb,” said Dahlia.
“There, he 's better now, thank you.”
She looked up at Archie and me. “I
don't believe you two love him a bit.”
Archie smiled at his wife and went
over to the tea-table to pour out. I sat
on the grass and tried to analyse my
“As an acquaintance,” I said, “he is
charming; I know no one who is better
company. If I cannot speak of his
more solid qualities it is only because I
do not know him well enough. But to
say'whether I love him or not is diffi-
cult; I could tell you better after our
first quarrel. However, there is one
thing I must confess. I am rather
jealous of him.”
“You envy his life of idleness?”
“No, I envy him the amount of
attention he gets from Myra. The love
she wastes on him which might be
better employed on me is a heart-
rending thing to witness. As her
betrothed I should expect to occupy
the premier place in her affections, but,
really, I sometimes think that if the
baby and I both fell into the sea she
would jump in and save the baby first.”
“Don’t talk about his falling into
the sea,” said Dahlia, with a shudder;
“I can't abear it.”
“I think it will be all right,” said
Archie, “I was touching wood all the
time.”
“What a silly godfather he nearly
had 1" whispered Myra at the cradle.
“It quite makes you smile, doesn't it,
baby? Oh, Dahlia, he's just like Archie
when he smiles.”
“Oh, yes, he's the living image of
Archie,” said Dahlia confidently.
I looked closely at Archie and then
at the baby.
“I should always know them apart,”
I said at last. “That,” and I pointed
to the one at the tea-table, “is Archie,
and this,” and I pointed to the one in
the cradle, “is the baby. But then
I've such a wonderful memory for
faces.”
“Baby,” said Myra, “I'm afraid
you're going to know some very foolish
people.” A. A. M.

It was during the mauvais quart
d'heure that Ronalds, my host (whom
I knew very slightly), drew me mysteri-
ously apart.
“My dear fellow,” he said, “I want

him to be sipping this dangerous fluid—
dangerous, that is, to one on a régime
—with perfect content. I therefore
explained to my partner that writing
was one of those mysteries that one
cannot tell anybody all about.
Then came the fish, and my partner
asked me if I did not think that MoRD-
KIN was really better than NIJINSKY,
because she did.
I was about to answer when hock

so good as to tell me at once if f==
there is anything the matter with
the wine. Will you? I can rely
on you absolutely, I know; they
say your taste is so perfect.”
Impossible to deny that there
was something flattering in being
deferred to as a gourmet and
judge of wine, and I put his ob-
| viously unquiet mind at ease by
promising to do what he wished.
Not, however, with any great
personal satisfaction, beyond the
glow naturally communicated by
the knowledge that a certain
fastidiousness on which I rather
plume myself had reached
Ronalds' ears. Who had told
him, I wondered. Anyway, he
knew, and, although I am not as
a rule given to putting myself
into any kind of prominence,
whether among friends or com-
parative strangers, I decided that,
if anything was wrong with the
wines, he should certainly know
it. Such were my thoughts in
the remaining few minutes before
we left the room in that absurd
ark-like procession downstairs.
I will not say that the respon-
sibility under which I had been
laid spoiled my dinner, but it did
not improve it.
There was quite a pretty girl
on my left, but her, of course, I
was not entitled to speak to
until half - time, when that
automatic swing round to the
other partner occurs. The lady

dinner. Should I act 2 At that moment
the butler reached the host with the
same large cloudy jug, and without
a moment's hesitation our host per-
mitted him to fill his glass. I was
conscious that my partner was saying
something about Clayhanger and Hilda
Lessways, but I could not attend to
her: I had to watch our host's ex-
pression as he drank. At last he lifted
his glass, tilted it, and set it down

faction. -
I was, I must admit, disap-
pointed and also a little piqued.
Why had I been singled out to do
this service for him when he could
obviously do it for himself? Why
had he so completely forgotten
his physician's advice? Why did
he never look my way? I felt so
sure about this being corked that
I fixed my eye on him, determined
that he should catch it, while
vague murmurs about the Five
Towns reached my ears. Our
host being obdurate, I determined
to tell one of the footmen, but, as
hemisunderstood me and brought
me a biscuit, I turned to my part-
ner and said that I had not read
some of the earlier ones, but all
the later ones, and that I liked
The Man of Property best. I
then asked her if she did not
think the champagne was corked,
and she said she never knew
about such things, but her hus-
band would tell her after dinner,
as he was considered the best
judge of wine in London.
Mercifully at this point half-
time was reached and I saw her
no more, but, consigning wine
and its problems to the devil,
talked cheerfully with the pretty
girl on the left. -
In the redistribution of seats
after the ladies had left us, I
found myself between two men
who seemed to be old friends.
I had taken down was of a maturer
build, and began badly by accusing
me roundly of being a barrister. Now,
if there is one thing—but never mind.
She covered her blunder by adding,
“Then I'm sure you write. Now tell
me all about it !”
Tell her all about it ! I was far too
much occupied in trying to decide
whether anything was the matter with
the sherry or not. Was it? Surely
that flavour was not wholly nutty: the
faintest suggestion of the bouchon, was
there not? or was there 2 I glanced
swiftly at our host, half terrified that
he might catch my eye, and, to my
membered my duty. Nothing the
matter with that, I discerned at once,
and replied that personally I found no
comparison between the two men,
NIJINSKY being in every way the
superior. She argued about it for a
while and then asked me if I had read
all ARNOLD BENNETT's books; but the
arrival of the champagne prevented an
immediate reply.
I hope no one thought me too much
in need of stimulant, but naturally I
had to sip it instantly if I was to do
my duty by the table, and again I was
plunged into doubt. To my palate a
suspicion of cork was again apparent—f
“Hullo 1" said one to the other,
across me, “what did you think of
your first glass of champagne? Was
it the least little bit corked, or not ?"
“Not,” said the other emphatically.
“Are you certain?"
“Absolutely. If it had been corked
I should have sent it back."
“You?”
“Yes; why not? Ronalds asked me
to. He's been seedy, it seems, and
mayn't drink anything much, and so,
considering mine the best palate here,
he asked me to watch the wine for
him."

wish you had thought it corked all the
same, and had it replaced. I nearly
did.”
“You?”
“Yes, Ronalds asked me to be sure
to mention if anything was wrong.”
“You !”
“Yes, he said he felt himself quite
safe if I would do it.”
And that was all.
And now I am wondering if at every
dinner-party Ronalds adopts the same
device for putting certain of his newer
guests into a good conceit of themselves.
But the plan has its defects.
E.
A PAIR OF OPERATIG BRAGES.
(From our Bayreuth Correspondent.)
HAVE you, O Wagnerian, ever run
short of braces in Bayreuth 2 It is
the sort of thing that might happen to
anyone, anywhere. But, happening as
it did here and to me, it has entailed a
long and painful voyage of discovery,
resulting in an unsatisfactory com-
promise. The first that were offered
to me had a picture of WAGNER worked
on one of them in pale blue silk and a
picture of the theatre on the other.
These were beautiful pictures in their
way, but doomed, from the very nature
of the case, to perpetual obscurity.
Then I might have had a pair with a
| Grail motive on them, or a pair splashed
all over with demi-semi-quavers out of
the Ring. Those that I got finally
were really more like thongs than any-
thing else. You know the sort that
Mime wears? -
You see, if you start any sort of shop
in Bayreuth you have to do this kind
of thing or be left behind by your
competitors. , You begin by placing a
large bust of Richard WAGNER, sur-
rounded by massive folds of plum-
coloured velvet, in the window. Then
you lay in a large stock of picture-post-
cards, a few photographs and some
operatic texts. After that you may
add—if you are a butcher—meat; if
you are a baker—bread, and so on.
But it is simply no good starting
business at all unless you can give your
premises the genuine festival flavour.
The only successful hair-dresser in the
place is the one that has an envelope
addressed by WAGNER displayed in the
window; and the man who set up as
a blacksmith on the strength of posses-
sing one of the shoes of the original
Grane—I won't ask how he got it—
has prospered enormously.
Of course it is the real souvenir shops
that do most of the business. It is
calculated that there are now enough

make a paste-board band—if they were
laid side by side—nearly as long as the
first Act of Götterdämmerung. I have
bought a souvenir myself this year. I
know it was weak of me, but I like to
have it. It is so characteristic. It is
a drinking-horn. Now that I have
scraped the motives off it, it may be
called quite a simple drinking-horn,
such as is in daily use among the
humblest of WAGNER's characters. I
know that it will remind me in days to
come of what I regard as the chief
cause of trouble and unrest in the
Wagnerian world. So much worry
would be saved if people would only
mix their drinks themselves! It may
seem a small point, but it is not.
Hunding, Siegfried, Tristan and Isolde
had they but taken this very simple
precaution. For the most surprising
thing about WAGNER's characters—in
other respects amiable enough—is their
abominable habit of doctoring one an-
other's drinks.

ES S E N C E OF PA R L I AM E. N. T.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
WINSTON's Epoch-MAKING SPEECH.
House of Commons, Monday, July 22.
—Emptiness of House and prevailing
listlessness, noted of late, varied to-night.
Benches on both sides filled. All
sections of galleries allotted to Strangers,
including preserves for the Peerage,
crowded. From Diplomatic Gallery
CANADIAN PREMIER and some of his
companions in memorable visit to this
country looked on. Impressed by
gravity of situation, hushed by mo-
mentous import of FIRST LORD's state-
ment, Members cheered but little.
Silence broken when reference to
emissaries from Canada was made,
whether by WINSTON, PRINCE ARTHUR,
or PRIME MINISTER. What WINSTON
felicitously described as “a touch from
the hand of a strong friend" was
warmly welcomed, the grasp heartily
returned by all sections of parties.
Contrary to early habit, WINSTON
observed precaution of writing out his
speech. Skilfully avoided depressing
influence that commonly attends that
method of oratory. Had evidently
learnt speech off by heart; only occa-
sionally bent over his folios to pick up a
line. Through hour and a half he was
followed with almost pained interest,
and with notablerestraint frominterrup-
tion by cheers or ejaculations. House
felt it was assisting at development of
a critical turn in history of Empire.
Happily at such crisis PRINCEARTHUR
was available as spokesman of Oppo-
large-minded patriotism the House has
through many years learned to expect
from him. There was no quibbling at
details, no earning of cheap Party
cheers by personal attack on individual
Ministers. He fully and generously
admitted soundness and sufficiency
of Ministerial scheme. Echoed with
approval WINSTON's declaration follow-
ing on detailed statement of Germany's
naval programme.
A FULL TREASURY BENch TAREs The NAVY SERiously.
“There is,” he said, “one way, and
but one way, to meet a menace of that
kind. It is to imitate the policy of

played by paid agitators with incredible
recklessness and lack of skill. It will
doubtless survive THE O'GRADY per-
formance of yesterday, but incident re-
mains profoundly regrettable. Want
of finish about carefully prepared out-
break fatal to success. The genius and
reputation of BURKE barely survived
the bathos of concluding inflammatory
speech by flinging a dagger on floor of
House. When, after noisily but in-
effectively wrangling with authority
first of the SPEAKER then of CHAIRMAN
of CoMMITTEES, THE O'GRADY thought
time had come for dramatic turn, he
looked about on Bench for copy of
Orders of the Day. Fortuitously find-
ing one, he twisted it between his
hands, flung it on the floor, and strode
forth amidst titter that would have been
a laugh but for thought of empty cup-
boards, famishing women and children,
down by the docks.
Significant that, with exception of
WILL THoRNE, who never can hear a
man shouting and resist temptation to
display his own exceptional gifts in
the matter of volume of sound, THE
O'GRADy's colleagues of the Labour
Party took no part in the performance.
They watched the scene in embarrassed
silence.
Matter reverted to to-day under
more orderly circumstances promising
happier issue. On motion for adjourn-
ment, cause of strikers was pleaded by
THE O'GRADY and DANSBURY in terms of
moderation pleasantly contrasting with
earlier bombastic freaks. Position of
employers set forth by NoFMAN CRAIG
in brief businesslike fashion. They
are, he said, willing for the men to
return under same conditions with
respect to wages and hours as before
the strike. Full consideration would
be given to all grievances submitted by
the men or the Unions. As oppor-
tunity offered, reinstatement of strikers
would be effected. But employers will
have nothing to do with officials of the
Federation who, “without statement of
grievance, without consulting the men,
without a thought of the women and
children, without notice to the em-
ployers, brought about the strike.”
This being state of affairs it seems
iniquitous that strike should be pro-
longed with its accompanying desola-
tion of very many thousands of homes.
RAMSAY MACDoNALD with quick in-
tuition held out hand to seize proffered
olive-branch. Suggested that NorMAN
CRAIG, representative of the employers,
should talk the matter over with him
as spokesman of the workmen, and
ascertain exactly how the land lay.
He did not doubt that even by to-
morrow morning something might be
Meanwhile CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER gave important pledge.
“It is no use,” he said amid general
cheers, “imagining that prevention of
these great Trade disputes can be
accomplished by mere agreement, con-
ciliation and persuasion. I am sure it
cannot. The Executive must be armed
with more formidable powers.”
To that end he promised to introduce
a Bill “in the immediate future.”
Business done.—Scottish Estimates

Friday.—Noting, the other week, the
HoME SECRETARY's use of the word
“impertinent” applied to question put
by JESSEL, I pointed out that the word
was used in its original meaning,
implying irrelevancy. SARK, who has

to do well by him. . . . Find my boy a
very schoole boy that talks innocently
and impertinently. So sent him to bed.”
The HoME SECRETARY, autocratic as
his office makes him, could not send
JEssei, to bed. But he used the word
“impertinent” precisely in the sense
employed by PEPYs.

LITERARY GOSSIP.
DR. THERMoGENEs D. CottoN, of
Oklahoma University, where he occu-
pies the Chair of Belles Lettres, has
just brought out a remarkable work on
the BRONTÉ Family. This volume had
its origin in the purchase of a number
of pairs of boots worn by members of
that family, of which, strange to say,
of CHARLoTTE BRONTÉ by Mrs.
GASKELL. Dr. CoTToN has made the
extraordinary discovery that Mr.
BRONTÉ was one of the first persons
to wear spring-side boots, the psycho-
logical and ethical influence of which
form of footwear Dr. CoTToN traces in
a series of masterly chapters.
Amongst other remarkable points
brought out in this work is the fact
that CARLYLE seldom went out in wet
weather without goloshes, and that
GEORGE MEREDITH harboured an acute
hostility to button-boots, to which, on
the other hand, MARTIN TUPPER was
consistently addicted. The book is
profusely illustrated with photographs
of these interesting relics, including a
pair of waders formerly belonging to
Posh, Edward FITzGERALD's friend, an
odd slipper, ornamented with beads on
the instep, believed to have been worn
by Wordsworth, and a pair of alligator-
skin leggings worn by WALT WHITMAN
during the War. Dr. Cotton, it should
be added, is known as the American
Shorter, and greatly prides himself on
this honorific cognomen.
According to The Westminster Gazette
the Chevalier WILLIAM LE QUEUx has
recently been spending some months in
the sun-baked Nubian Desert and the
Sudan, and has embodied his experiences
in a new volume which will immediately
be published. Some of the Chevalier's
adventures, we understand, were so
terrific as to border on the incredible,
and the liveliest satisfaction prevails in
San Marino at his safe return to the
haunts of civilisation. At one stage of
his travels, while navigating, a cata-
maran on the perilous waters of the
White Nile, the Chevalier was precipi-
tated into the river by the onset of a
rogue crocodile, and owed his life to
his remarkable skill with the revolver.
On another occasion he was entangled
in the sudd, that intricate and paralys-
ing growth of water-weeds which infests
this stream, and was only extricated by
the heroic exertions of a posse of Mad
Mullahs, whom he had fascinated by
recitations from his works. ..
As a protest against the prevailing
passion for cheap reprints, Messrs.
Odder and Stout propose to bring out
an édition de luze of a number of works
to which they have given the attractive
title of “Nobody's Library.” . The first
instalment of fifty volumes includes
Mrs. MARKHAM's History of England,
the works of EUCLID, the poems of
ELIZA Cook and Col.BNso's Arithmetic.
The volumes will be sumptuously bound
in vellum, printed on hand-made paper,

done to effect a settlement.

seldom do so.
DAISY AND BERTHA.—To prevent
your pretty bathing-costumes getting
wet, why not simply paddle in them,
as is done on the Continent 2
MAJOR FROM INDIA.—We quite agree
that it is extremely difficult to call a
spade a spade when a small boy trips
you up with one, and we consider
that the little lad's mother was hyper-
sensitive.
FAIR LADY.—We suppose that a
brown face and brown arms are
extremely awkward on a return to

Ermyntrude must choose stuffy lodg-
ings well away from the sea front, and
sit indoors with the blinds down and
the windows shut during the whole of
her holiday. Her complexion should
not come to much harm then.
PATERFAMILIAS.—It is most unfortu-
nate that you should, while bathing,
have sat down heavily on a jelly-fish,
and that the bad-tempered creature
should have stung you through your

TOLD TO THE CHILDREN.
THE EUGENISTs.
HARRY BUss was a nice young man. He had played
Rugby Football for Cambridge, and had also rowed in the
Cambridge Boat. He was strong and handsome, and his
mother was an old lady of sixty. She loved him and had
brought him up very well. He himself was thirty, and
was making £2,000 a year in the City. , Yesterday he had
met Lady Angelina Clanpoppet and had asked her to
marry him, and first she had said, “This is so sudden,”
and then she had said, “Yes,” and then they had talked
about the honeymoon.
So to-night he was sitting in his sitting-room and was
thinking happy thoughts about Lady Angelina. When he
had done this for some time he took up The Times and
read it, and he saw an account of what is called the
Eugenics Congress. The Eugenics Congress is a lot of
people who are not going to let you marry whom you like,
but it must be somebody else, and they are going to take
children from their parents and bring them up differently.
Some of their names are Mr. BLEEKER VAN WAGENEN, Sir
RICKMAN GoDLEE, Dr. Soren HENSEN, Sir T. WEZEY
STRONG, Dr. BEATTIE CRozier, Mrs. ALEC TweBDIE, and
Sir KRISHNA GUPTA. Mrs. ALEC TweedIE has written a
long letter about it to tell you how she is going to manage
all your troubles for you by not letting you do anything
you want, because things you want are not good for her
and Sir KRISHNA GUPTA.
Well, at last Harry put the paper down, and as he did so
the clock struck nine, and he said to himself, “It is not late;
I will go to 85, Berkeley Square, where my Angelina lives,
and will spend an hour or two in her delightful company.”
So he took his hat and his umbrella and went out at his
front door. He had not walked very far along the
Cromwell Road when he was suddenly seized from behind
by a policeman, who said to him, in a gruff voice, “I arrest
you by order of the Eugenics Society. Will you come
quietly, or must I put the bracelets on 2"
“I will come quietly,” said Harry, whose blood was
boiling in his veins at the insult; “but pray tell me what
is the cause of my arrest, for I am an innocent man and
cannot guess why I am treated thus."
“That,” said the constable, “you will learn at the police-
station to which I am about to conduct you,” and he
hailed a taxi-cab and away they drove.
They soon reached a gloomy building before which the
cab stopped, and Harry's guardian ushered him firmly into
a large room filled with policemen and Inspectors of
Eugenics, the latter being dressed in maroon velvet cloaks
and black masks. The chief policeman ordered Harry to
be brought to his table and thus addressed him:—
“Sir," he said, “I will do everything in my power to
mitigate the dreadful situation in which you have placed
yourself. It is, however, my duty to inform you that the
case against you looks very black. You are charged"—
and here he read from a document that lay before him—
“with having contracted an engagement to marry the
Lady Angelina Clanpoppet without having previously, as
the law directs, obtained the permission of the Eugenics
Officer for your district. You are further charged with
having yourself suffered from measles at the age of ten and
from scarlet fever at the age of thirteen ; and with having
had a father who was known to have drunk two glasses of
port wine at a sitting in the year 1900. It is alleged also
that your mother is liable to attacks of influenza and
cannot read small print without the aid of spectacles.
Your paternal grandfather, it is stated, lost an arm in the
his descendants to be born with only one arm. These are
the chief counts in the indictment that is to be laid against
'ou.”
“This,” said Harry, “is indeed dreadful, for I cannot
dispute the truth of what you say. Is there then no
hope?”
“But little,” said the officer in a tone in which pity
strove with severity. “Nor is this all. Your accomplice,
the Lady Angelina, has for the moment escaped, but she
cannot fail to be captured within an hour. Against her ||
too there are terrible charges. Her mother's father had ||
fifteen children, all of whom at one time or another had ||
colds and coughs. Her father has had at least one attack
of gout, and she herself was kept indoors for more than
a week with an attack of mumps, which rendered her
not merely ill, but also displeasing to the eye. My dear
Sir," he continued, “it is useless to disguise from you that,
if all these charges be proved, the rest of your life and hers
will be spent in the rigorous confinement of a prison cell.
Even should you pledge yourselves to abandon all design
of a union with one another, you will be sentenced to a |
minimum of fourteen years' penal servitude.”
At this moment the voice of Lady Angelina was suddenly |
heard protesting shrilly in the corridor. At the sound
Harry's self-control deserted him. He sprang violently at ||
the throat of the nearest Inspector of Eugenics, grappled
with him in a death-struggle—and woke up in an agony of
terror and anger in his own sitting-room.
BY THE ROMAN ROAD.
THE wind it sang in the pine-tops, it sang like a humming
harp;
The smell of the sun on the bracken was wonderful sweet
and sharp,
As sharp as the piney needles, as sweet as the gods were
good,
For the wind it sung of the old gods, as I came through
the wood |
It sung how long ago the Romans made a road,
And the gods came up from Italy and found them an abode.
It sang of the wayside altars (the pine-tops sighed like
the surf),
Of little shrines uplifted, of stone and scented turf,
Of youths divine and immortal, of maids as white as
the snow
That glimmered among the thickets a mort of years ago!
All in the cool of dawn, all in the twilight grey,
The gods came up from Italy along the Roman way !
The altar smoke it has drifted and faded afar on the hill;
No wood-nymphs haunt the hollows; the reedy pipes are
still; - -
No more the youth Apollo shall walk in his sunshine clear;
No more the maid Diana shall follow the fallow-deer
(The woodmen grew so wise, the woodmen grew so old,
The gods went back to Italy—or so the story's told !).
But the woods are full of voices and of shy and secret
things—
The badger down by the brook-side, the flick of a wood-
cock's wings,
The plump of a falling fir-cone, the pop of the sun-ripe pods,
And the wind that sings in the pine-tops the song of the
ancient gods—
The song of the wind that says the Romans made a road,
Zulu war, and there is necessarily a predisposition amongst

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF anyone, judging only by the cover and the headings
of the chapters, should take up The Awakening of England
(NELSON) in the expectation of finding a series of impres-
sionist word-pictures of country scenery, his own awakening
would certainly be abrupt. For Mr. F. E. GREEN's method
is by no means impressionist, nor does his word-painting
concern itself with the country as a thing of beauty, but
rather as a productive and industrial joy for ever. Back
to the land, in short, is the text upon which he has worked
out a very trenchant and vigorous indictment of modern rural
conditions. The publishers say that he has approached the
subject without bias, but, though this is to a certain extent
true, you will not have accompanied Mr. GREEN far upon
his rustic excursions before you find that the Parson, and
generally the stratum of society represented by the Squire
and his relations, are regarded by him with something
rather less than affection. Of course there are exceptions,
duly acknowledged by name and address, but for the most
part the rural powers, especially large farmers, or owners
responsible for preserving, come in for a good deal of
antagonism and hard speaking. It is a little startling,
moreover, to the indolent lover of solitude to find some
exquisite and deserted landscape moving Mr. GREEN to
fury, while a quite hideous collection of slate-roofed cottages
is photographed as the ideal contrast. This, however, is a
sentimental objection, with which the author has small
concern; and even those for whom Mr. GREEN's crusade has
its sinister aspect must at least admit that he has made it

and the possibility of its becoming Lizzie is formidable,
but there is something about it that seems to guarantee
success in life for its owner. Among all the Elizabeths of
recent fiction there has scarcely been a failure, and the last
of them, Elizabeth in Retreat (LANE), is more than up to
the mark. Charmingly idle and wayward, cool (I suspect)
on the hottest day in summer, delightfully selfish and as
amusing as she is amused about everything, here is a lady
who should instantly appeal to every right-thinking man
in this age of female activity, seriousness and militancy.
Spoilt by her husband, her children and herself, she sits in
the background and watches events at her ease, doing such
good as she does to her fellow-creatures inadvertently and
by the way; and at the rustic retreat of her choice there is
much to watch, more especially the tragedy of an unhappy
Prudence bound to a wreck of a man by a bond which is
itself a shame.
All the superlatives having long ago been used up and
squandered upon the undeserving, it is difficult to hit upon
such an expression of praise as the reading public will take
without a pinch of salt. MARGARET WESTRUP (Mrs. W.
SYDNEY STAcEY) must take the will for the deed, and content
herself with the one specific encomium that the character of
Evelyn Wingfield is no less than a stroke of genius. And
to all others to whom these presents may come I say,
“Believe me or not as you please, but this is the best novel
of the year that has come my way.”

the same SARA JEANNETTE DUNCAN that used to charm me
by the fresh simplicity and unexpected humour of her art.
“A little man married to a great woman,” says Messrs.
STANLEY PAUL's published estimate of the book. I concede
the littleness of the man (though he is the only one of the
characters to whom I feel at all drawn), but I am not so
sure about the greatness of the woman. The daughter of a
famous banking-house, she was fabulously rich, had a house
in Arlington Street, and knew everyone, from the members
of the Cabinet to those wedded ornaments of the State
Labour Party, the Gommies, whom I seem to have met
already in The New Machiavelli as well as in real life.
There are, in fact, too many of these portraits of living
people in the book, including a heaven-born editor for

ling to England to interview Milord of Buckingham, and
leaving his three brave companions stretched out in various
stages of puncture and collapse en route. And now it
would appear on the authority of HUGH FRASER and Mrs.
HUGH FRASER, who write The Queen's Peril (HUTchINSoN),
that her most capricious Majesty got herself into a ve
awkward predicament at a much earlier date than this.
She was kidnapped, it seems, by the Duc de Brienne, and
only saved by the devotion of Solange de Luz, her favourite
maid of honour, who impersonated her before the whole
Court and Louis himself, and by the courage of Raoul de
l'Etour, that young lady's lover, who killed the wicked
duke and brought the queen home safely to Paris disguised
and on a donkey's back. The incidents in The Quecn's
Peril are lively enough, and I have no fault to find with its
historical atmosphere, but the ladies and gentlemen of the
Court, parbleu ! There was just a single moment when I

many comparatively unknown places, and if at times his
writing is cramped by a kind of sentimental cynicism, which
one feels is more affected than real, this defect is only present
in the least valuable essays of his book. I can imagine
him saying to himself, “I will just show you that I can
write this modern dialogue as well as any of you—so here
goes”; but the fact remains that his efforts in this direction
are very far from being his happiest. For the rest, how-
ever, I do not want (or expect) to find a more engaging
writer. “Dodo Island” contains a long quotation of such
genuine humour that to have rescued it is an achievement
in itself. Although in this sketch Sir FRANK apologises
almost humbly for mentioning history, in “Tamarin and
fle de la Passe" he becomes an historian unashamed—
and a most attractive one. “The Kris Incarnadine” pro-

debtor's motor car, which by this time has come round from
the stables and is waiting outside. This is what Elsa
Armandy did in The Villa Mystery (PAUL), by Mr. HERBERT
FLowerDEw. But pause, reader, before you imitate her.
Do not forget that, immediately after you have got away
with the swag, some third party may murder the debtor
and disappear, leaving you to be suspected. This also
happened to Elsa. Fortunately for her the case was handed
over to Inspector Creed, a man who would not have found
a clue if it had been handed to him on a plate with water-
cress round it; and all ended happily. Towards the author
of the frankly sensational novel my attitude is that of some
indulgent old uncle towards a favourite nephew. I forgive
him everything so long as he does not bore me. And Mr.
FLowerDEw never does. Consequently, though in this story
he uses the long arm freely, and though my piercing
intelligence enabled me to spot the right murderer as early
as Chapter X., I have no complaint to make. If The
Villa Mystery has not the merit of the same author's

The announcement by the PRIME
MINISTER of the existence of a War

co-ordination of all our Departments
of State in time of war has, we under-
stand, given an immense fillip to the
German Spy Industry.

THERE are who scent its near decline,
This hallowed game of hunt-the-leather,

Both sides are beaten by the weather;
But, while I sympathise with their report
Who say it rather lacks excitement,

I have to bring a worse indictment.
In other games of manly skill,
As when towards the puny pocket
Our weapons push the devious pill
Over the sandy coves that block it;
When on the tennis lawn we lightly press
Feet that recall a Russian ballet,
Or shove our pawns about (I speak of chess),
Or thunder down a skittle alley; —
In trials such as these we catch
An image of the old duello:
The scales are balanced; 'tis a match—
Yourself against the other fellow;
Or, if you choose to play with more a-side,
That does not make the combat gruesome;
There are no odds to chill your trembling hide
At footer in a twenty-twosome.
So all the finer games are played;
No man is pitted contra mundum;
But when the batsman, wanting aid,
Looks round the field he finds each one dumb ;

“In case,” writes the Director, “of any inquiry or sudden

fine.” In No. 1 cage is the Water Bird and among its

nothing of the sort. There is a kindly communicativeness
about this little work which revision might damage.

“Ripping,” I agreed. “Who's it
for 2 "
He looked at me in astonishment for
a moment.
“My dear old chap, for the baby.”
“Oh, I see. That's awfully nice of
you. He'll love it.” I wondered if
Simpson had ever seen a month-old
baby. “What's its name?”
“I've been calling it Duncan in the
train, but of course he will want to
“Well, you must talk it over with
him to-night after the ladies have gone
to bed. How about your luggage?
We mustn't keep Myra waiting."
“Hallo, Thomas,” said Myra, as we
came out. “Hallo, Samuel. Hooray!”
“Hallo, Myra,” said Thomas. “All
right 2"
“Myra, this is Duncan,” said Simp-
son, and the shrill roar of the bear rang
out once more.
Myra, her mouth firm, but smiles in
her eyes, looked down lovingly at him.
Sometimes I think that she would like
to be Simpson's mother. Perhaps,
when we are married, we might adopt
him.
“For Baby?" she said, stroking it
with her whip. “But he won't be
allowed to take it into church with
him, you know. No, Thomas, I won't
have the luggage next to me; I want
someone to talk to. You come.”
Inside the wagonette Simpson
squeaked his bear at intervals, while I
tried to prepare him for his coming
introduction to his godson. Having
known the baby for nearly a week, and
being to some extent in Myra's con-
ſidence, I felt quite the family man
beside Simpson.
“You must try not to be disappointed
with his looks,” I said. “Anyway,
don't let Dahlia think you are. And
if you want to do the right thing say
that he's just like Archie. Archie
doesn't mind this for some reason."
“Is he tall for his age 2"
“Samuel, pull yourself together. He
isn't tall at all. If he is anything he is
long, but how long only those can say
who have seen him in his bath. You do
realise that he is only a month old 2."
“My dear old boy, of course. One
can't expect much from him. I sup-
pose he isn't even toddling about yet?”
“No–no. Not actually toddling.”
“Well, we can teach him later on.
And I'm going to have a lot of fun
with him. I shall show him my watch
—babies always love that.”
There was a sudden laugh from the
front, which changed just a little too
late into a cough. The fact is I had
bet Myra a new golf-ball that Simpson
would show the baby his watch within
two minutes of meeting him. Of course
it wasn't a certainty yet, but I thought
there would be no harm in mentioning
the make of ball I preferred. So I
changed the conversation subtly to golf.
Amidst loud roars from the bear we
drove up to the house and were greeted
by Archie.
“Hallo, Thomas, how are you?
Hallo, Simpson. Good heavens ! I
know that face. Introduce me, Samuel.”
“This is Duncan. I brought him
“Duncan, of course. The boy will
love it. He's tired of me already. He
proposes to meet his godfathers at
4 P.M. precisely. So you'll have nearly
three hours to think of something genial
to say to him.”
We spent the last of the three
hours playing tennis, and at 4 P.M.
precisely the introduction took place.
By great good luck Duncan was
absent; Simpson would have wasted his
whole two minutes in making it squeak.
“Baby," said Dahlia, “this is your
Uncle Thomas."
“Hallo,” said Thomas, gently kissing
the baby's hand. “Good old boy,”
and he felt for his pipe.
“Baby,” said Dahlia, “this is your
Uncle Samuel."
As he leant over the child, I whipped
out my watch and murmured, “Go!"
4 hrs. 1 min. 25 sec. I wished Myra
had not taken my “two minutes" so
literally, but I felt that the golf-ball
was safe.
Simpson looked at the baby as if
fascinated, and the baby stared back at
him. It was a new experience for both
of them.
“He’s just like Archie,” he said at
last, remembering my advice. “Only
smaller,” he added.
4 hrs. 2 min. 7 sec.
“I can see you, baby," he said.
“Goo-goo.”
Myra came and rested her chin on
my shoulder. Silently I pointed to the
finishing place on my watch, and she
gave a little gurgle of excitement. There
was only one minute left.
“I wonder what you're thinking
about,” said Simpson to the baby.
“Is it my glasses you want to play
With ? "
“Help!” I murmured. “This will
never do.”
“He just looks and looks. Ah! but
his Uncle Samuel knows what Baby
wants to see. (I squeezed Myra's arm.
4 hrs. 3 mins. 10 secs. There was just
time). “I wonder if it's anything in
his Uncle's waistcoat 2."
“No 1" whispered Myra to me in
agony. “Certainly not.”
“He shall see it if he wants to,”
said Simpson soothingly, and put his
hand to his waistcoat pocket. I smiled
triumphantly at Myra. He had five
seconds to get the watch out—plenty
of time.
“Bother,” said Simpson, “I left it
upstairs.” A. A. M.

THE WOOIN' O'T.
(Being the authorised version of the
Eugenist's Love-song.)
EYEs of azure, eyes of hazel,
Ebon tresses, locks of gold,
Beauty, ocular or nasal—
These, beloved, leave me cold.
They are trifles, only skin-deep,
Unto nothing they amount:
Let us rather enter in deep
To the things that really count.
Why, then, has my love been fired so?
What has brought me to thy feet?
'Tis thy system I've admired so,
Thy anatomy, my sweet.
Harley Street has flocked to see thee
With its stethoscopes, and found
It could safely guarantee thee
Wholly, absolutely sound.
Here's a chart whereon are written
Beatings of my true love's heart:
Never was there seen in Britain
Such a model of a chart.
Up and down in faultless rhythm
Run the curves in ordered law
Bearing testimony with 'em
Of a heart without a flaw.
Charms like this thou hast in plenty;
I resolved to tempt the Fates
When I read thy five-and-twenty
Medical certificates.
Perfect as the heart between 'em
Are thy lungs, and liver too,
While thy matchless duodenum
Is the best that ever grew.
Doctors rave about thy pharynx,
They have scarcely words to tell
All the beauties of thy larynx
And thy bronchial tubes as well;
Thy digestive apparatus
Bids my soul its love confess—
Then let Science come and mate us!
Sweet-and-healthy, whisper Yes!

“Ever seen the sea before, Mister ?”
asked the small boy who had been
grubbing about among the shingle.

“No, never in my life.”

“Where is your home?” I asked,
taking my turn as questioner.
“Poplar,” he replied.
“Then you've heard all about the
sea, I suppose, if you haven't seen it
before ?”
“Look, see this?” and he pulled a
dead starfish from his pocket. “Goin'
to take that 'ome to young Ginger
Collins. 'E come 'ere last year, and
told me about it, and I punched 'im in

little shy; there was a suspicion of
regret in his tone.
“Bit of a liar, eh?” I asked.
“Not 'im,” retorted my acquaintance.
“I thought 'e was, but 'e wasn't after

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtEACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, July 29.
—Thirty-four years ago Lord RANDOLPH
CHURCHILL, scornfully regarding poor
ScLATER-Booth, whom he could not
abear, observed, “Remarkable how
often we find mediocrity with a double-
barrelled name.” The aside caught
fresh charm from fact, momentarily
overlooked by the speaker, that
RANDoIPH SPENCER - CHURCHILL was
numbered among the class denounced.
In present Parliament owners of
double-barrelled names distinguish
themselves in new way. They assume
that, having twice as many names as
average Member, they may ask four
times as many questions per diem.
Tendency marked in increasing degree
by LocKER-LAMPSON and LANE-Fox.
WoRTHINGTON-Evans takes the shine
out of them all. Remembering SPEAKER's
modest objection to a Member even with
a double-barrelled name placing on the
paper more than eight questions, he
nominally had to-day only seven. By
ingenuity and dexterous use of the
blessed phrase, “And whether,” he
fired off no fewer than seventeen—
this not counting supplementaries.
Certain monotony about the business.
Plan simple. Execution easy. When
shaving, brushing his abundant hair,
taking his walks abroad, or otherwise
enjoying opportunity for meditation,
W.-E. thinks out hypothetical difficul-
ties arising from working of Insurance
Act, throws them into form of conun-
drum, and asks CHANCELLOR OF Ex-
CHEQUER to guess the answer. Surely
in vain is the net spread in sight of
any bird, more especially one as wary
as LLOYD GEORGE. He passes on the
riddle to SECRETARY For TREASURY,
who perhaps knows more about the
Act than does the author of its being.
This disappointing. But a Ministerial
answer is forthcoming and certain
measure of time wasted.
MASTERMAN had his revenge when,
later, moving in Committee of Supply
vote on account of salaries and ex-
penses of Insurance Commissioners he
dilated on working of Act through its
first fortnight. Things going on
swimmingly. Ten millions and a half
insured persons have become members
of Approved Societies. In first week
of operation of Act sixteen and a half
million of stamps were bought and, pre-
sumably, licked. In brief, MASTERMAN
testified that “the Act is working with
smoothness and celerity.”
Discussion interrupted by stroke of
ten o'clock. At the signal, guillotine
dragged in. Votes passed as quickly
All Opposition could do was to chal-
lenge occasional divisions. These dis-
closed notable condition of affairs that
wreathed rotund countenance of

unfamiliar since noon last Friday. On
afternoon of that day BALCARRES
worked out little plot almost crowned
with complete success. At quarter
past twelve as Ministerialists sauntered
in, themselves guileless, unsuspicious
of depravity in others, the Opposition
Whip, having his men at hand, sprang
a division on a technical point of pro-
cedure. Result: Ministerial majority

Not the sort of game to be played

includes what is known as the Single
Tax. PREMIER briefly replied in the
negative.
This triumph would have satisfied
lesser men. Tireless in pursuit of
national interests WolMER fixed his
eagle eye on SECRETARY FoR Scotſ,AND.
Last Thursday, when question of
Scottish Estimates was raised on
motion for adjournment, WolmER,
glancing round House, as is his custom
of an afternoon, with intent to see
that all things are in order and every
man in his place, noted absence of
Scottish SECRETARY. What he now
wanted to know was (a) Why was
MACKINNoN Wood absent on this par-
ticular occasion ? (b) Did he intend in
future to be at his post when matters
concerning Scotland came under dis-
cussion ?
With meekness not excelled by
PRIME MINISTER, Scotch SECRETARY
explained his absence on Thursday and
promised amendment for the future.
Here subject about to drop when
suddenly, unexpectedly, PIRIE rushed
in. Had listened with some impatience
to Wolm ER's interpellation. Noble
Lord is not a Scotchman; does not
even sit for Scotch constituency.
Comes no nearer the Border than Lan-
cashire. Aberdeen had inalienable right
to deal with the matter, and as its duly
elected Member PIRIE voiced its desire
for information.
“Is it not the case,” he asked, “that,
whilst Mr. Hogg|E was going all
the way in denunciation of Ministerial
conduct of the Scotch Estimates, the
SECRETARY was in the Lobby sniggering
at the Hon. Member ?”
MACRINNoN WooD attempted to take
refuge in guilty silence. PIRIE not to
be put off by that ignoble device.
“Will he reply?” he sternly asked.
Thus adjured, Scotch SECRETARY,
not being on his oath, answered in the
negative. No use, if there were oppor-
tunity, of carrying matter further. So
with solemn injunction to “mend his

ALL the year round Johnson's
sporting instincts are a nuisance
that do not contain a word of truth.)
After a little fruitless skirmishing on
his part, “For goodness' sake sit
down,” I said.
Suppressing as far as he could the
joy of battle, he said that what he did
he did solely for my good, and asked
me if I wanted to be stung. -
“I really don't know that I should
mind,” I said.
“Mind 2 You have no idea what
you're saying. Have you ever been
stung’”
“No,” I said. “Have you?” I knew
that my only hope of distracting John-
son was to start him talking about
himself. “Put down your napkin and
tell me all about it.”
“Once upon a time,” he began,
gradually acquiescing, “I too was

me of is, I am sure you will agree with
me, a really important sting. What
did it feel like 2 ”
“It felt . . . But where is that
marmalade 2 Quick, we must snare the
fellow by subtlety and cunning.”
I put a retentive hand on the mar-
malade jar (a sufficiently unpleasant
thing to have to do) and fixed a severe
eye on Johnson. To concentrate his
attention needed all my personal
magnetism.
“I insist upon being told all about
that sting,” I said mesmerically.
“It wasn't so much the injury as
the insult,” he continued reluctantly.
“It was a half-asleep wasp that did it,
an impudent fellow who had got into
my tobacco pouch, which is strictly
reserved for tobacco, and dared to
resent my intrusion. And above
all was the sickening thought of
my lost prestige. Now that one
insolent, comatose, and possibly
intoxicated insect had dared to
attack me, others were bound to
lose their respect and do the same.
It was the beginning of the rising
of the masses, the thin end of
the wedge.” . .
“Of the wasp,” I corrected..
“Both,” said Johnson. “Any-
how, I was incensed and amazed.”
It was because my hypnotic
eye was fixed on him that his
attention was so long held. It
was for the same reason that the
Initial Cause of All the Trouble
did very much as it liked mean-
while round about the marmalade
jar and neighbourhood . . .
“Dash it,” I said hurriedly
and bitterly, as I killed the little
to me, but when the wasp-knifing season
is on they are a positive terror. For the
rest of the year I, his London co-tenant,
suffer only from the relation of his
exploits, and, after all, one is not bound
to listen. But when there is an en-
thusiast on the move with a bread-
knife it is neither safe nor convenient
to continue one's meal unconcerned,
especially if one wants a little bread.
The other morning at breakfast the
first wasp made its appearance, and
Johnson thereupon became impossible.
He started operations with his nap-
kin, using it, as one uses the red rag in
a bull-fight, to exasperate the victim to
a proper state of fury. Meanwhile,
benefiting by the experience of past
years, I gathered the marmalade jar to
myself and concealed it behind the
coffee pot, over which it is my custom
to preside. (Johnson's dictum, that
marmalade is called a Preserve to in-
dicate that it is primarily intended for
foolish and idle and callous in the
matter of wasps. I, as you do, re-
garded wasp-stings as regrettable
incidents in other people's lives, which
were apt to get magnified in the
telling . . .”
The narrative was interrupted.
“Yes,” I said, picking up the toast-
rack off the floor but not despairing of
my ultimate purpose, “go on; I am
absorbed.”
“Having lived for twenty years un-
stung, I came to believe that I was
unstingable. I was contemptuous of
the whole matter and regarded myself
as one apart, above such things . .
Then came the first sting. It left me
a changed . . .”
This time I picked up the toast
merely and let the rack remain on the
floor. The wasp retired to the window
again, hurt but not physically.
“Do, I beg of you, continue your
narrative,” I said; “for, though others
brute with one indignant blow.
Johnson was carried away by the
pure enthusiasm of a zealot over the
conversion of a heretic. “Good,”
he declared, “I am glad to see the
militant spirit awaking in you. The
other wasp, also deceased, of which
I was telling you . . .”
“I never want to hear of that or
any wasp again,” I interrupted him.
“I am sick of the whole race.”
“But I have never even told you
what it feels like to be stung.”
“I know,” I said shortly, “now.”
Johnson leant against the mantel-
piece the better to enjoy his triumph.
“No,” I said at once, “anything
but that. The worst has undoubtedly
happened, but, nevertheless, let it be
clearly understood that if I have to
suffer further from the activities of
someone, I would, on experience, choose
that they were the activities of the
wasp rather than of yourself.” -

THE SPEECH DAY.
(Communicated by one of the Audience.)
DAD and Mum were going to the Speeches at Dad's old
School, but almost at the last moment Mum couldn't go, so
Dad wrote to the Head Master's wife and asked if he might
bring me instead, and she wrote back a very kind letter
and said Yes, certainly, I was to come. Dad said, “You're
not a boy, but perhaps you'd like to see the old place
where your father spent some of his happiest days,” and I
said, “Right-O,” and when Dad asked me where I learnt
that expression I told him everybody said it, but he told
me not to do it again.
Well, when the day came, off we started at about ten
o'clock, for we had a good long way to go. There were
a great many black clouds about, so we both took um-
brellas, and of course it didn't rain. When we got to the
place, Dad said we had a few minutes to spare before we
had to go to the luncheon, so he took me to the playing
field, where we met a very º clergyman with whom he
used to be at school, and they laughed and joked together
about the old days and all the things they used to do and
all the mischief and the scrapes they got into, just as if he
hadn't been a clergyman at all—but somebody once told me
that clergymen when they were young were always as bad
as anybody else. I don't quite believe that, though, for if
everything was quite true that Dad told me about himself
that day nobody could have been quite as bad as he was,
and he isn't a clergyman. Nearly all the places he showed
me were places where he had done wrong things. He
showed me (1) the place where he had a fight with another
boy: he hit the other boy in the eye, and the other boy
hit him in the mouth ; (2) the place where he smoked a
cigarette which he didn't like, but he thought it was a fine
thing to do and one of the masters caught him doing it
and reported him; (3) the place where the Head Master
whacked him on the hand with a birch so as to cure him of
smoking, but he was only cured for a time and has broken
out again since; (4) the window from which he poured a
jugful of water on a policeman's head, because the policeman
would keep talking to somebody and Dad couldn't go to
sleep; and a good many other places where he said he had
distinguished himself. One was where he broke another
boy's collar-bone playing football; but he said he didn't
mean to do that. I asked Dad if there were any places
where he had done good things, and he told me they were
too numerous to pick out and I must imagine them. I
must say the clergyman was nearly as bad.
Well, at last the time came and we went into the School
House, where the Head Master lives, and we were shown
into the drawing-room; but I didn't see any canes or birches
about anywhere. It was rather formidable, for all the
other ladies and gentlemen in the room were much older
than me (I'm just going to be thirteen), but they were all
very kind to me, especially the Head Master's wife. Then
we went in to the dining-room to lunch, and a gentleman,
who said he was older than Dad, gave me his arm and took
me in just as if I’d been grown up. He and I talked a
good deal during lunch, and he kept putting good things on
to my plate. The sweets were splendid.
After this we went off to the School buildings. The
speeches—but they weren't speeches really: it was all acting
—were in the big schoolroom, which was crammed full of
boys and fathers and mothers and sisters, and they were all
smiling and looking very happy, and the boys cheered
everybody and everything tremendously. I thought they
were never going to stop. First there was some Greek
acting, which they did in evening dress—long-tail coats and
and everybody understood it quite well because it was all
explained in the programmes. It was about Suffragettes
who had stolen their husbands' clothes and put on false
beards, but at last their husbands came and carried them
off in their arms, so they didn't seem to get on very well in
Greece either. Then there was a French piece, and last
of all a bit of Twelfth Night; where they make a fool of
poor Malvolio. I knew all about this because we had read
it in our own school, and I liked it very much ; but Dad said
he could never care for it himself because they all behaved
so badly to Malvolio, who was a gentleman after all. He
said it always made him feel as if he had eaten a spoonful
of ice-cream and found that the salt had got into it. I've
done that myself and it isn't nice.
After the speeches came the prize-giving—heaps and
heaps of beautiful books which were piled up on a table;
and they got Dad up on the platform and made him give
some of them. He was very different then. He made a
speech, and talked about discipline and all the things the
boys must do if they were to be really good boys and be a
credit to their school and their country; and they all
clapped their hands and cheered, the clergyman too. I
saw him doing it. After this we had a very good tea, with
any amount of different cakes, and raspberries and cream,
and Dad sat next the daughter of one of his old school-
fellows who had once run away from school because he
didn't want to learn the Thirty-nine Articles. He after-
wards became a general in India. Then we said good-bye
and walked to the station. Dad said he felt as if he was
taking Cinderella home after her ball, and I think I know
what he meant.
POUR PRENDIRE CONGE.
DEAR, when I note your “higher education,”
Your hockey prowess and your skill at golf,
I realize my sorry situation—
My chance of winning you, I see, is off.
But, could we only once again be carried
Back to the days ere womankind was “freed,”
We would within a month or two be married,
We would indeed.
For I should only have to seek your father,
Tell him his daughter pleased my amorous whim,
Beg for your hand, and forthwith (in the rather
Improbable event of pleasing him)
You would be mine. I should not need to flatter,
Court and cajole you every passing day;
His word would settle it, my dear, no matter
What you might say.
Or, were he harsh, a few soft, tender speeches,
A little rhapsody on blighted hope,
And you (my reading of romances teaches)
Would make your simple mind up to elope,
Soothing my tendency to melancholy
By fleeing with me at the dead of night,
A course which now you'd deem the rankest folly
(And you are right!)
So since, romantic practices eschewing,
You modern maidens always want to know
The income of the man who comes a-wooing,
And mine is so preposterously low,
Accept this valedictory effusion
From one whom Cupid's latter ways compel
To lead a life of celibate seclusion.

T-
I sli.ALL BE THE LAUGHING-stock of ALL THose HoRRID WORK-
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. GEORGE A. BIRMINGHAM is a writer from whose
books I almost always derive unmixed entertainment;
therefore I was just a little startled and even worried to
find in the advertisement of his latest, The Red Hand of
Ulster º: ELDER), the sinister warning, “This is a
political novel.” To save you from a similar shock, I will
say at once that whatever your political convictions they
are unlikely to be seriously outraged by a story in which
the author's peculiar gifts of light-hearted fun and half-
serious satire have never once deserted him. Yet on the
face of it, to write a tale in which Belfast's rebellion
against the rebels should be shown as a working reality,
and carried to a grimly humorous finish, was a task of
difficulty and danger. I hardly think it could have been
better done. The characters, it is explained, though
“necessarily placed in the positions occupied by living
men,” must not be taken as representing any real person.
This, however, will not interfere with your appreciation of
such episodes as that in which a certain privy-councillor,
called Babberley, having all along advocated armed resist-
ance, is so shocked and outraged at his advice being taken,
that he dashes from Belfast to Trafalgar Square, and, in
a wild attempt to prevent bloodshed, addresses a Labour
| mercenaries of the capitalist classes.”
This is a sample
of the incidents to which the revolution gives rise; the
actual fighting is told with the most jovial and exciting
zest; and the end leaves you breathless. Mr. BIRMINGHAM
in short has proved himself too good a novelist (and sports-
man) to spoil his fun, even in the domain of controversy.
At both ends of his book Mr. KEIGHLEY SNowDEN is at
great pains to make a spirited protest against a point of
view long since defunct, and to resist a charge of impro-
priety that none would urge against him. We do not, in
these enlightened days, maintain that no love affair which
has failed to culminate in matrimony duly solemnized is
fit to be discussed; and those of us who have a sneaking
regard for lovers who marry and pluckily go through with
it are not such extremists as to deserve the invective of
his dedicatory note or lengthy postscript. Without these, I
should never have known that I was reading a story
“devoutly founded in ideas repugnant to British virtue.”
This is it: Stephen Gaunt, having previously begotten (in
what he calls a moment of inconsiderate passion) and
forgotten (in a mood which he does not explain) a son,
returns, at the opening of the story, to discover that this
boy, a tiresome child, has been taken in and kept for
thirteen years by his brother Jacob. The question arises,
and is discussed at full length, shall the boy be told?

blush at, but there is less when his failure to make an
honest woman of the dead mother is amply explained, if
not justified. What annoys is the lack of sportsmanship
shown by Stephen and the author; by the one in his
ingratitude, by the other in his injustice, to Jacob. Un-
generous, on the face of it, Jacob was not, and for myself I
found him less of a prig about his premeditated righteous-

whole I cannot appreciate the fitness of the title, Bright
Shame (STANLEY PAUL). I missed both the shame and
the brightness.
When DANIEL CHAUCER, in the preface to his so delight-

describes himself as a breeder of shorthorns, writing to pass
the time, how are we to know he isn't just pulling our legs?

instance, Grigg's intrepidity was rewarded by the scoring
of several points for his side; but the credit of his
exploits is tempered by the reflection that his chief
rival would have been easily outwitted by an intelligent
boy-scout. Delia Coombs, the heroine, was of course a
whole-hearted Confederate; at least she was until she met
the spy; and then her heart was punctured. Grigg (being
less agile than his name suggests) got on very slowly with
his wooing, but the conditions under which he had to make
love were so parlous that I cannot bring myself to blame
him. . Every time he went to see Delia he was in danger
of being arrested or shot, and that may well have placed
an impediment on his tongue. For the development of
Delia's character Mr. Joseph SHARTs deserves a special
word of praise. Resisting the temptation to allow her to
indulge in heroics, he has drawn a woman capable, in
peculiarly trying circumstances, of acting not only with
loyalty and courage, but also with reason and common

PUNCH, or THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TO THE PREMIER
on reading in a Ministerial Journal the alleged programme
of his Autumn Mandeuvres.
[“The Prime Minister will spend the next few weeks in a round of
visits . . . Early in October Mr. Asquith will go north, spending a
week at Dallas, Elgin, and a week at Balmoral. . . . At the end of this
period . . . Mr. Asquith will make Venice his headquarters for a few
weeks of motoring and sight-seeing.”—Daily Chronicle.
“The House of Commons will resume on October 7.”—Daily Chronicle.]
WHEN the wild partridge, hustled from the turnips,
Comes swooping down the equinoctial gales;
When Autumn's matin chill the coney's furnips
And Summer's final charm (if any) fails;
In that lone hour of widowhood and worry,
When first your stricken party lacks the aid
Of him its Master (now the Baron MURRAY),
Newest of converts to the ranks of Trade;—
I should have thought, at such a solemn juncture,
You would be there, your own heart wounded sore,
Doing your best to salve the general puneture
And hush the dirge of “Elibank no more 1"
It should have been, I guessed, your bounden duty
To raise their drooping peckers, come out strong,
And loudly reassert the deathless beauty
Of all those various Bills deferred so long.
But no. If I may trust my Daily Chronicle,
'Tis then, when most they mourn their truant Whip,
Your kilted frame, in search of Nature's tonic, 'll
Traverse the Border on a Highland trip.
Healed by a fortnight's rolling in the heather,
You'll whizz through London on your southward way,
Not pausing once to make enquiry whether - -,
Your sheep, unshepherded, have gone astray.
Deaf to the voice of by-election voters,
You will embrace the Adriatic's bride
(Venice, that happy hunting-ground of motors
At which no local horse has ever shied).
Strident amid her strait and tortuous calli
I hear your hooter's devastating tune,
I see you in your goggles as you sally
To Lido o'er the nicely-tarred lagoon.
A few brief weeks in this fine motoring centre,
And home again your punctual feet will press,
Cheered by a generous House as you re-enter
In time to catch the Christmastide recess.
O. S.
THE RESORT.
“WE must go for a holiday,” said I.
“But must get neither lost among, nor identified with,
the holiday-making masses,” said George.
“Let us wait till the last loaded four-wheeler has
disappeared.” -
“And then get into a taxi. Nothing else remains to be
considered except our destination.” -- .
“And that will be decided by the gentleman at the
Enquiry Office of that particular terminus to which our
taxi elects to take us.” -
So we waited till the rush was over and made our
dignified and leisurely exit later. At the London and Great
Western we found an Enquiry Officer not so exhausted by
previous enquirers but what he was ready and willing to
give his undivided attention to our case, and place his vast
“Chief among the graver problems of the day,” said we
to this Knowledgable One, “is the question: where shall
we make our holiday ?”
“You want to know where to stay,” he began.
“Exactly.”
“In the West Country?”
“On to it in oncel ” said we, and he handed us a book,
marked sixpence, but presented gratis, and entitled, Where
to Stay in the West Country.
We sat upon a bench, the admired of all beholders.
“Barnstaple,” I read aloud, beginning at the beginning,
“attracts many patients suffering from pulmonary dis-
orders.”
“Next, please,” said George.
“Bideford (North Devon). Population 9,500. Early
Closing Day, Wednesday. Rates 8/4 (likely to be reduced).
Subsoil, loam and shale. Town Clerk, W. B. Sheldom.”
“We might spend our mornings,” said George, “count-
ing the population and our afternoons watching the rates
being reduced. Then, what with the loam and shale and
the Town Clerk, we should not want for evening amuse-
ment and instruction of the quieter sort.”
I went on a bit. “On the morning of June 11th, 1685,
the ‘Helderenberg,' accompanied by two smaller vessels,
appeared at the little port of Lyme.”
“Indeed,” said George ; “but I am afraid we are too
late for that.” -
“The death rate at Seaton is stated to be 15-7. . . .”
George is very hard to please. “Quickish,” he
admitted, “but if it must be, let it, say I, be sudden.”
“. . . and the gas 5s. per 1,000 feet, but 4s. 7d. for
heating. A thousand feet should last us, if we make a
point of going to bed early, and we could save the 5d. by
pretending that it was for heating. Let's go to Seaton.”
George was adamant on the question of rapid decease.
“Then,” I announced, “we must go to Lynmouth, where,
apparently, special privileges are afforded to tourists. The
death-rate there is distinctly stipulated to be 8 per 1,000,
excluding visitors. . . . Moreover I see that one may
here purchase electric light at 5d. per unit.”
“One could of course distribute units as the customary
presents for good children from Lynmouth and so keep
the Devonshire cream for oneself. But even so. . . .”
“Oh, take the book yourself,” said I irritably, “and don't
trouble to tell me that the Morthoe Parish Council Clerk
is Mr. P. Chugg, for I have observed that fact for myself.”
, “D stands for Dartmoor,” said George. “What about
that ? . . . The visitor who goes there will return again and
again . . . and those who wish for a longer stay will find
accommodation.” - -
“Does it say exactly where?” I asked.
“Curiously enough, no.” . . . . . ;
“All the men I ever knew who, by their own desire or
not, made a longer stay were similarly reticent upon the
point. . . . But what does it say about the attractions?”
“There is a lamentable absence of Town Clerks and
Early Closing Days, and there is, in fact, but one
particular given.” - -
: “And that ?”
“A Cider Manufacturer, who, it seems, practises there
as also at Birmingham.”
That railway does not go to Birmingham, so we went to
Dartmoor. -
In the train, George became a little silent and gloomy.
“Cheer up !” said I optimistically. “If we don't like
the place, we can always . . . escape.” -
“I was wondering,” he answered, “more about clothes.
Aren't they rather particular, and have we got the right
knowledge at our disposal.

AUNTS ANCIENT AND MODERN.
WHERE are the aunts of yesteryear,
Whose quaint familiar faces
Redeemed an age of chandelier,
Of lavender and laces,
Their daily rôle to knit and chat
On ottoman or settle,
Their properties a pampered cat,
A caddy and a kettle?
Where are the aunts of yesteryear,
Whose charitable labours,
Whose coal and flannel made them
dear
To impecunious neighbours,
Who breathed an air of auld lang syne
And struck delicious poses
That went with elderberry wine
And desiccated roses?
Where are the aunts of yesteryear,
The bane of little nephews
Who feared the ebon crutch, the queer
Appendage that the deaf use;
Small visitors who viewed askance
Their autocratic habits
And quailed before the lorgnette glance
Here where the groundsmen mow and
delve
Till every lie is grassy,
You'll find the aunt of 1912
Most handy with her brassy;
Scorning the after-luncheon nap,
The mittened “far niente,”
She strives to bring her handicap
To something under twenty.
Here where the glittering snowscapes
shelve
And feathery flakes are swirling,
You'll meet the aunt of 1912
Tobogganing and curling;
Ski-ing and skating with the best
In manner bright and hearty,
She adds inimitable zest
To any Alpine party.
Queen of the tourney, she applauds
Each feat of thew and tendon,

At Ranelagh or Hendon;
Where airmen plane, where batsmen

Their feet across the creases,
Young England greets the modern aunt
And disregards the nieces.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
BACK To THE LAND.
Buttercup Farm, Wilts.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-What do you
think of your own Blanche as a
farmer? One's heard so much lately
of the decline of farming in England
that I felt it was the duty of some of
us to step into the breach. So I got
Josiah to buy this place and stock it
with creatures—and here I am, farming !
And I find, my dearest, that a little
nameless yearning I've had for ages
was really just the sub-conscious need
of farm-life / Quite several people
have followed my example already.
Beryl Clarges has got a farm, in direct
rivalry with mine, a few miles off; and
Babs St. Austin is growing turnips
about half - an - hour's drive away.
(Turnips, you know, are the new food.)
But about me : I've some cows—a
darling Jersey called “Blossom" is my
special pet—and some pigs, and the
sweetest little dairy. In the morning
I milk “Blossom,” wearing the dearest
little milking-dress. I've not been able
to get any milk yet, because “Blossom"
won't stand still, though all the men
and boys on the farm hold her tight
whenever I come near her. Then I go
to my dairy, wearing a simply de-
licious dairy dress of butter-coloured
embroidered linen with teeny-weeny
churns for buttons, and my dairymaid
shows me how to make butter. I don't
know whether you've seen People Who
Matter for this week 2 There's a
double-page headed, “Society Leaders
on their Farms,” with a photo of me
milking Blossom, another photo of
me making butter, a most unfortunate
one of Babs hoeing turnips, and a fear-
fully flattered one of Beryl Clarges
standing near a plough and team and
trying to look as if she knew all about
rotation of crops and all that kind of
thing!
After the dairying I change again to
a dear little paysanne walking frock and
take a look round and grumble about
the weather as if I'd been a farmer for
years! Later in the day I write a little.
I'm contributing a series of articles on
“Practical Farming " to The Peeress.
So you see what a busy little woman I
am You must come and stay here. It
would just suit your practical well-
informed mind. I remember, ages ago,
you used to know how many things
made a ton, and which way the wind
was blowing, and all those out-of-the-
way things girls don't generally know.
'm immensely sorry about poor old
Popsy, Lady Ramsgate. But I'm not
to blame. She would come. She
wrote and said she'd the farm feeling,
and might she come and learn all about
my farm before getting one of her own 2
And so she came. And the very next
morning, when I was milking Blossom,
Popsy appeared on the scene to help
me, got up en paysanne, point-device,
with a milkmaid's complexion (not at
all badly done!), and a milking-stool
and pail complete. Directly Blossom
caught sight of her she wrenched her-
self away from the men and boys who
were holding her and went for Popsy'
The poor old dear flung away her
milking stool and pail and ran faster,
my dear, than anyone could imagine at
her age and with such heels' Later
we had to have Sir William Kiddem
down. He said, Yes, Lady Ramsgate
had certainly done too much running,
and he should positively forbid her ever
to run so fast again; her knees had un-
doubtedly been greatly overworked, and
he should advise electric massage, and,
when her constitution had partially
recovered its equilibrium, a course of
treatment at Krankenbad. So there's
an end of her farming.
Joyce Vavasour, Norty's cousin, was
married the other day at Little Higgle-
bury, not far from here. It was the
very last word in the country weddings
that are so much done now. We're
all just a little bit rather astonished at
Joyce taking Billy Mainwaring after
all. But the true inwardness of the
affair is that she had ideas for a
country wedding and she simply had
to carry them out. (Entre mous,
m’amie, that's the explanation of many
marriages that aren't otherwise to be
accounted for :—the girl has ideas for
a wedding, and the man is merely
part of the mise-en-scène!) Joyce
went to what old-fashioned people
call the altar in a flowered chintz
and a big rustic hat with wide strings.
Instead of a bouquet she carried a
basket of butter and eggs, and so did
each of the ten bridesmaids.
Joyce, of course, had to put her
basket down while the knot was being
tied, and it was kicked over, and the
eggs all got broken. Norty says he
came out of church with his boots
covered with yolk of egg, and that if
he'd known what sort of things happen
at country weddings he'd have come in
bright yellow boots! Billy and his best
man wore smock-frocks and carried
pitchforks, and they made it complete
by using dialect—including the parson,
Billy's cousin, who said, “Wull ee hev
this wumman?"—and so on, and Billy
said, “Ees, oi wull.” (Norty says it
wasn't proper Wiltshire dialect, and
that, by shoving “Ees” into the ser-
vice, Billy's made the marriage illegal.)
All we guests played up to them.
Beryl Clarges brought a milk-pail and
left it in the porch, but I bested her
there, my dear, I'm thankful to say,
for I arrived at the church with a yoke
and two pails / Instead of a dance
afterwards, we had a hay party. It
would have been a scream if the
weather hadn't been so absolutely
brutal. In one of our games half of us
buried ourselves in the hay (it was a
bit damp and sodden, but we put on
mackintoshes), with only our feet stick-
ing out, and the others had to guess
whose feet they were. I think it's a
lovely game. Beryl called it stupid
(she takes 5's ').
Talking of weddings, Jack Willoughby
was married last week. She's fancied
as the next woman amateur-golf-
champion, you know, and — isn't it
delicious, dearest? — she's actually
married the amateur-spillikins-cham-
pion, Teddy Treherne! We're all
wondering what they'll chat to each
other about during the brief intervals
when Jack is at home ! People are
telling quite a good little story about
one of Jack's presents. She only lives
for golf, as you may imagine (she came
straight off the links to be married,
left her clubs at the church door, and
went back directly afterwards to finish
a match), and is utterly an outdoor girl.
Her great-aunt Eastshire, however,
whose ideas are a good deal overgrown
with ivy, gave her a gold thimble for a
wedding gift. “Oh, what a quaint
little thing, Aunt Eastshire 1" said Jack,
with a shout of laughter, as she took it
out of its case. “Whatever is it for 2 "
I'm already planning my harvest-
home. I mean it to be the biggest
thing of the kind ever done in these
parts. Come and be a farmer, my
Daphne, and be happy!
Ever thine,
BLANCHE.
P.S.—A message from Babs: all her
turnips were stolen last night!
Second P.S.—I've told Josiah this
place must be sold at once and all the
creatures on it. Blossom has tried to
toss me; the pigs have strayed away
and are all lost; the hay has the moth
in it, or whatever it is that happens to
hay, and the corn is so damp that it's
no good for bread, and, I suppose, will
have to be made into puddings; worst
of all, that Beryl Clarges has enticed
away my dairymaid, and I'm left with
twenty pounds of stuff on my hands
that has left off being milk and will
never be butter | Don't ever ever turn
your attention to farming, Daphne !
Of all occupations it is the most
loathly

House of Commons, Monday, August
5.—Bank holiday. Striking example
of unselfish fidelity to public interest.
Whilst all the world is making holiday
at Hampstead, Greenwich and other
sylvan resorts, Members repair to
Westminster, not only set about the
nation's work as if it were not holiday-
time, but peg away far into the night.
Successive divisions mark a muster ex-

undefined but boldly asserted tendency
to incur inexplicable personal dislike.
His night's rest disturbed by appre-
hension of another Government being
in power next year and, anxious to
maintain Sugar Convention in its
integrity, finding that their country is
irrevocably cut adrift. PREMIER full
of sympathy; points out that with-
drawal from the Convention does not
take effect until September in next
year. Accordingly in event of con-
tingency foreseen by Dr. FELL, should
another and a better Government be
in power, the agreement may remain

another tack. Raised question of pay- |
ment of Members. Lamented the fact
that Government, not satisfied with
bringing credit of country to lowest
point reached in eighty years, has per-
sonally discredited Members in eyes of
the country.
“The newspapers,” he said, brushing
away a tear, “no longer speak of us as
they did two years ago.”
Everyone dying to know what be-
|comes of Dr. FELL's salary. Too polite
to ask question. Indeed, there was odd
disinclination on both sides of House
to discuss topic. When Dr. FELL sat
down, still pocketing his secret, debate,
after fashion permissible during stages
of Appropriation Bill, went adrift in all
directions.

Reply was a division in which
Government majority ran down to

“The sooner we wind up business
and get off to the moors the better,”
said the MASTER of ELIBANK, mopping
his anguished brow.
ELIBANK, by the way, to inconsolable

the Home Rule Bill, “going to the

"Twas the Voice of the SPEAKER.
Quite time he complained. Hearty
cheer from both sides welcomed inter-
position. Micua vaut tard que jamais.
Supplemental Questions have, without
exception that occurs to the mind, been
directly responsible for every scene
which through Session has interrupted
public business and inflamed Party
passion. The practice is opposed alike
to the letter and the spirit of Standing
Order. It is grossly unfair to Members
who have obeyed reasonable injunction
to give notice of a question and await
their turn to submit it. In scores of
cases daily occurring their reward has
been that before their opportunity
comes the limit of time allotted to
Questions has been reached, the
interval having been largely appropri-
ated for Supplemental Questions and
consequent conversational outbreak.
Happily that is now a thing of the
past. The SPEAKER, marvellously long-
suffering, has at last put his foot down.
The day of the Supplemental Questioner
is over.
“This sort of thing” alluded to by
the SPEAKER was a threatened duel

Member to withdraw. Not a step till

given a certain quality for speed in the
horse—but how was one to do it?
“This,” he said, “is where my system
comes in. It requires accurate know-
ledge of the position of every horse's
stable—that is to say, training stable,
or home, not temporary stable—and
the lie of the last straight stretch of
every race-course. In order to get this
one must study the one-foot ordnance
map of England; but it is worth the
trouble. Take Goodwood, for example.
I have not got a map with me, but let
us say that the last stretch up to the
winning-post runs to the North-East;
get that into your head and then look
at the runners. There are, say, seven,
of which two are trained at Wantage,
two at Newmarket, one at Lambourne,
one at Alfriston, and one at Epsom.
Your map and your compass combined
tell you that Epsom is almost in a
straight line (it may not be, but we are
merely using illustrations) with the
Goodwood finish, and consequently,
knowing of this wonderful homing in-
stinct on the horse's part and its know-
ledge of directions, you put your money
on the Epsom-trained animal and most
probably win a packet. And so on all
over the country. Do you see?”
“Then you are very rich 2" I
enquired.
“No, not yet,” he said. “But I
hope to be. As a matter of fact, I
have only quite recently hit upon this
theory, and I have not yet mastered the
geography of training stables and the
orientation of courses; but I am quite
confident that I shall do so and that
the scheme will repay me.”
“And what will you back when the
course points to nothing?” I asked.
“Nothing,” he replied. “I am not
a gambler. I am a scientific man.”
“And suppose the course were to
wind so that the first half favoured the
favourite's homing instinct, and the
second half only an outsider's, what
then 2''
“Then I should probably back the
favourite, thinking that his homing
instinct during the first half would give
him an unbeatable advantage.”
“I see. And where, say, all the
horses were running practically straight
home, as must often happen at New-
market, what then 2"
“Then I should either support the
favourite or abstain.”
“Well,” I said, “I wish you well.
But I still believe that to write the
names of horses on slips of paper, put
them in a hat, and ask a pretty woman
to draw one, is the best way.”
“Why a pretty woman 2" he asked.

INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTs.
A PowerFULLY supported movement
is on foot to secure Welbeck Abbey,
the seat of the Duke of Port LAND,
and convert it into a training establish-
ment for the British team who will
take part in the Olympic Games at
Berlin at 1916. According to the
scheme the athletes will be strictly
secluded from all external influences
and conduct their preparation for the
next contest under the supervision of
a Director and a specially selected
staff of trainers and professors, to be
chosen by a plebiscite of the readers of
The Daily Wail and The Daily Terror.
The present state of the poll points
clearly to the election of Mr. W. BEACH
THOMAS as Director. Other appoint-
ments likely to be made are as
follows:—
Lecturer on Longwindedness: Sir
HENRY Howorth.
Scientific Chewing: Professor Hiram
Chump.
Will Culture: Sir EDw1N DURNING-
LAWRENCE, Bart.
Rational Tubbing:
Manchester.
Synthetic Rubbing: Professor Attila
Tonks.
Confidence Specialist: Mr. P. A.
VAILE.
Patriotic Optimism Promoter: Sir
A. ConAN Doyle.
Flag-waving: Professor Offley Bangs.
The Science of Splurge: Professor
Hector P. Slosher.
Spell-binding: Mr. T. P. O'Connor,
M.P.
Creation-licking: Professor Victor
ALwyN.
During their residence at the institu-
tion it is proposed that the British
representatives should be trained dur-
ing alternate weeks on a vegetarian
and meat diet. Mr. EUsTACE MILES
will supervise the former, and Sir J.
CRICHTON-BRowNE, the great champion
of chops, the latter. Similarly, it is
proposed to alternate teetotalism with
an indulgence in alcohol as follows:
1st week, gin; 2nd week, gin and
gingerbeer; 3rd week, gingerbeer; 4th
week, brandy; 5th week, brandy and
soda; 6th week, soda, and so on.
In regard to finance, it is proposed
that the Director should have a salary
of £5,000 a year, and each professor
£1,500. Fortunately, the promoters of
the scheme have secured the co-opera-
tion of a powerful group of land-taxers,
including Mr. HEMMERDE, K.C., M.P.,
Mr. URE, M.P., and other stalwarts,
who have undertaken to introduce a
Short Bill providing for the expropria-
Dr. QUINE, of
price not exceeding £100, and the
raising of a sum of £250,000 by the
imposition of an extra super-tax on
the incomes of such peers as may be
selected by a commission consisting of
Mr. ARTHUR Ponson By, Mr. HARold
BEGBIE, Baron de Forest, and the
Rev. C. SYLVESTER HoRNE.
The prospect of the speedy passage
of the Bill has been greatly improved
by a manifesto issued by the Bishop of
Patagonia, who threatens to resign his
see unless the £250,000 is forthcoming
by November 1st. An even more
powerful inducement is that held out
by Messrs. A. KIPLING CoMMON, LAND-
FEAR LUCAs and LowTHER BRIDGER,
who have intimated to the editors of the
leading journals that they will cease
contributing to their correspondence ||
columns if the Bill is not passed in the
first fortnight of the Autumn Session.
In this context we may mention a
well-authenticated rumour that Mr.
J. L. GARVIN has declared his un-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I CAME to the reading of Between Two Thieves (HEINE-
MANN) without the advantage of having read the author's
previous work, The Dop Doctor, but with all the weight of
a general verdict of approval of that highly praised book
to prejudice me in its favour. The story deals mainly with
the England and France of Crimean days. The “two
thieves” are NAPOLEoN LE PETIT, and a sort of super-con-
tractor, standing for all the drab rogues who did so infa-
mously by their country in that sorry time. The hero is
one Hector Dunoisse, a chivalrous young French officer of
infantry, who, early in his career, meets and falls in love
with a rather too severe but beautiful lady, who is none
other than the “Lady of the Lamp.” Before these two
meet again in the hospital service in Scutari there has
intervened for the young officer a time of moral storm and
stress, during which his proud flag has been lowered.
Atonement is the key of his after-life, and the treatment of
it is marked by a deep religious feeling. Dunoisse's love
is returned, but is rewarded by no more than a yearly letter
and a final message after his lady's death, explaining her
renunciation and bringing peace to a dying man.
A dozen other stories of adventure, also of knavery and
intrigue, are interwoven. A bitter contempt for the THIRD
NAPoleoN distorts the writer's vision. A fierce and reason-
able hatred of the scoundrelism of the contractors finds
vent in the caustic trouncing of some very squalid departed
ghosts.
Throughout, a vivid imagination, together with a
balanced by the faculty of self-criticism necessary to re-
deem a book on so heroic a scale from a thousand absurd-
ities and disproportions. Frankly it is not so redeemed,
but, with all its obvious faults, an astonishing vigour and
conviction behind it arrest attention. There is also evi-
dence of a very careful study of contemporary documents,
illuminating the narrative at all points. Altogether a
strange, intriguing book.- -

The Human Boy Again. Apparently stage-manager John
MURRAY, listening attentively in the wings, found the
applause hearty enough to justify another verse, and the
result is From the Angle of Seventeen. I hope the audience
will applaud once more, but I doubt if their enthusiasm
will be overwhelming. Repetition has a little dulled the
catchiness of the tune; the humour has become a little
mechanical. The present volume deals with the Human
Boy's first year in the City, and is, I am bound to say,
quite entertaining when once one has resigned oneself to
the fact that there is no plot and that nothing of any im-
portance whatsoever is going to happen. . It is a sort of

But even so I cannot call it wholly satisfactory. The fact
would seem to be that Mr. Evans has attempted to cram
more plot into his tale than it can hold without confusion
and weariness for the reader. There is here the material
for at least two novels, one dealing with Glory Bellairs the
elder, and the other with her daughter. Naturally therefore
I can give you no proper idea of their history in a paragraph;
I can only suggest to you the kind of book that it makes.
One perhaps not for all markets; for GEORGE Evans writes
not always with the surest taste; and his way of dwelling
rather too insistently upon the unpleasant leads me to sus-
pect his sex. There is, as I have indicated, a heroine named
Glory, who is a dancer and exquisitely lovely, and dies at
the end of Part I., leaving a daughter of the same name to
carry on the business. Then there is a hero, Dickie, with
fair curls and passionate blue eyes and a general capacity
for taking to himself all

said Archie, “is what shall the baby be

they are.” ‘. . . . . . * * * * *
Godfather Simpson looked across in
amazement at Godfather Thomas.
“Really, you are taking a good deal
upon yourself, Archie,” he said coldly.
“It is entirely a matter for my colleague
and myself to decide whetherthe ground
is fit for—to decide, I should say, what
the child is to be called. Unless this is
quite understood we shall hand in our
resignations.” :
“We’ve been giving a lot of thought
to it,” said Thomas, opening his eyes for
a moment. “And our time is valuable.”
He arranged the cushions at his back
and closed his eyes again. “ . . . . .
“Well, as a matter of fact, the com-
petition isn't quite closed,” said Archie,
* Entries can still be received.”
“We haven't really decided at all,”
put in Dahlia gently. “It is so difficult.”
“In that case,” said Samuel, “Thomas
and I will continue to act. It is my
pleasant duty to inform you that we
had a long consultation yesterday, and
finally agreed to call him—er—Samuel
Thomas.” ; : * : :
“Thomas Samuel,” said Thomas
sleepily. - * .
“How did youthink of those names?”
I asked. “It must have taken you a
tremendous time.” . . -
“With a name like Samuel
Thomas Mannering,” went on Simpson
[“Thomas Samuel Mannering,” mur-
mured Thomas], “your child might
achieve almost anything. In private
life you would probably call him
Sam.”
“Tom,” said a tired voice.
“Or, more familiarly, Sammy.”
“Tommy,” came in a whisper from
the sofa.
“What do you think of it?” asked
Dahlia.
“I mustn't say,” said Archie;
“they're my guests. But I'll tell you
privately some time.”
There was silence for a little and
then a thought occurred to me.
“You know, Archie,” I said, “limited
as their ideas are, you 're rather in
their power. Because I was looking
through the service in church on Sun-
day and there comes a point when the
clergyman, says, to the godfathers,

You may have fixed on Montmorency
Plantagenet, but they've only to say
“Bert' and the thing is done.” < * *
“You all forget,” said Myra, coming
over to sit on the arm of my chair,
“that there's a godmother too. I shall
forbid the berts.”.” - - -
“Well, that makes it worse. You'll
have Myra saying ‘Montmorency Plan-
tagenet,’ and Samuel saying ‘Samuel
Thomas,' and Thomas saying' Thomas
Samuel.’” -
- “It will sound rather well,” said
Archie, singing it over to himself.
“Thomas, you take the tenor part of
course : ' ' Thomas Samuel, Thomas
Samuel, Thom—as Sam-u-el. We
must have a rehearsal.”
For five minutes Myra, Thomas and
Simpson "chanted in harmony, being
assisted after the first minute by Archie,
who took the alto part of “Solomon
Joel.”. He explained that as this was
what he and his wife really wanted
the child christened (“Montmorency
Plantagenet” being only an invention
of the godmother's) it would probably
be necessary for him to join in too."
“Stop!”, cried Dahlia, when she
could bear it no longer; “you'll wake
baby.”. -- " - * . -
... There was an immediate hush.
* “Samuel,” said Archie in a whisper,
“if you wake the baby I'll kill you.”
The question of his name was still
not quite settled, and once more we
gave ourselves up to thought.
“Seeing that he's the very newest
little Rabbit,” said Myra, “I do think
he might be called after some very
great cricketer.” ; :
“That was the idea in christenin
him ‘Samuel,’” said Archie. -
“Gaukrodger Carkeek-Butt Bajana
Mannering,” I suggested—“something
like that ?" -
“Silly; I meant 'Charles,' after FRY.”
“Schofield,' after Haigh," mur-
mured Thomas. -
“‘Warren' after BARDSLEY would
be more appropriate to a Rabbit,” said
Simpson, beaming round at us. There
was, however, no laughter. We had
all just thought of it ourselves.
“The important thing in christening
a future first-class cricketer,” said
Simpson, “is to get the initials right.
What could be better than ‘W. G.'
as a nickname for GRACE 2 But if
‘W. G.'s' initials had been Z.Z., where
would you have been 2 ”
“Here,” said Archie.
The shock of this reply so upset
Simpson that his glasses fell off. He
picked them out of the fender and
resumed his theme.
“Now, if the baby were christened
be ‘S. T.,’ which are perfect. And
the same as ColeRIDGE's.”
“Is that CodeRIDGE the wicket-
keeper, or the fast bowler?”
Simpson opened his mouth to ex-
plain, and then, just in time, decided
mot to. -
“I forgot to say,” said Archie, “that
anyhow he's going to be called ‘Blair
after his mamma.”
“If his name's Blair Mannering,” I
said at once, “he’ll have to write a
book. You can't wasté a name like
that. The Crimson Spot, by Blair
Mannering. Mr. Blair Mannering, the
well-known author of The Gash. Our
new serial, The Stain on the Bath
Mat, has been specially written for us
by Mr. and Mrs. Blair Mannering.
It's simply asking for it.”
“Don’t talk about his wife yet,
please,” smiled Dahlia. “Let me have
him a little while.”
“Well, he can be a writer and a
cricketer. Why not? There are others.
I need only mention my friend,
S. Simpson.” -
“But the darling still wants another
name,” said Myra: “Let's call him
John to-day, and William to-morrow,
and Henry the next day, and so on
until we find out what suits him best.”
“Let's all go upstairs now and call
him Samuel,” said Samuel.
“Thomas,” said Thomas.
We looked at Dahlia. She got up
and moved to the door. In single file
we followed her on tip-toe to the
nursery. The baby was fast asleep.
“Thomas,” we all said in a whisper,
“Thomas, Thomas.” . . . .
There was no reply.
“Samuel !”
Dead silence. - - -
“I think,” said Dahlia, “we’ll call
him Peter.” " * A. A. M.

(Special for “The Daily Moil,” by the

Who is the perfect airman 2 What

He should be acquainted with

ful commonsense was his

He should have nerve but
no nerves.
He should advertise.
He should be still living.
But better than this list of
requirements it would be well
to take an actual perfect air-
man and describe him, and
by a fortunate chance there
is one in existence who,
moreover, by a coincidence
happens to have done some
flying for The Daily Moil.
Onry Salmay is a perfect
airman. He is also a born
airman, although he was
born before flying was pos-
sible. But that makes no
difference; he is a born air-
man. Even in the cradle his
little arms made the move-
ment of wings; his little eyes
continually looked upwards
at the sky, or, since he is
French, had I not better say
ciel? He followed the flight of
oiseaux (birds) with passion-
ate interest. The neighbours
clustered about him. “ Voilà
l'aviateur !” they would say,
and little Onry would crow
his delight. Well, they were
good prophets, these neigh-
bours, and Onry is now the
finest aviator of the bunch,
holding the proudest position

good friend. “If I am to be
an airman,” he said to himself
(in French), “I must learn to
tly; and if I am to fly with
a machine, which seems to
be the only way, I must
understand machinery.” This
sagacious decision was the
beginning of the end. He be-
came a mechanic, then took
flyinglessons, and began to fly.
To-day he has fulfilled the
highest desire that can ani-
mate and stimulate any air-
man—he flies for The Daily
Moil. He is wonderful. He
can fly even in the rain. He
despises umbrellas. “Regard
then,” he often cries to me
as the drops fall—“regard
then the humidity? But do
I mind? Am I downcasted 2
No. Up, up, Onry Salmay,
to your proper sphere, the

perfect Frenchman talks, and
I am proud of our intimacy
and proud thus to pat on the
back a colleague of the staff

less Jingo—is making a point of eight
more Dreadnoughts, and the cry seems
to be popular. Issue new bill at once:
“Vote for a Twopenny Land Tax and
you getTwenty new Dreadnoughts every
Year.” That has taken the wind out
of the Jingoes' sails, I fancy. Deputa-

programme of twenty Dreadnoughts
and points out that the money would
be better spent in bringing the entire
adult German population over here
and entertaining them. Explain to

problematic, and that the election must
be won somehow.

unscrupulous briber who ought to be
hounded out of decent society—has
announced that Tariff Reform will
enable the Beer Taxes to be reduced.
A gross appeal to the thirsty masses.

SEASIDE SPORTS AND
PASTIMES
FOR
LITTLE ONES AND GROWN-UPS.
I. —MAINLY FOR LITTLE ONES.
IBUILDING CASTLEs. .
This pastime is popular with all
little ones who have constructive or
artistic proclivities. (See my little book,
“Bumps, and All about Them, or, The
Home Phrenologist.") If you are a
seriously-minded child and have read
Mr. WELLs' articles on Labour Unrest,
you will probably prefer to build com-
fortable Workmen's Dwellings. In that
case the procedure is the same,
but, instead of proclaiming that you
are the King of the Castle, you will
sing, “I am the Freeholder of this
Attractive Workman's Dwelling.”
II.-FOR LITTLE ONES AND GROWN-UPS.
WINKLING.
Great skill is required to bag a
winkle. The best method of catching
this sporting little crustacean is as
follows:—Bait an ordinary pin with a
sand-hopper (which may readily be
caught with a large butterfly net) and
hold it outside any cleft in the rocks
that looks a likely place for a winkles'
form. (None of the best winklers say
“nest.") If our friend is at home, he
will pounce upon the hopper, and
impale himself upon the pin. You can
then deal him a sharp blow upon the
nape of the neck, which will render
him insensible, when he may be safely
transferred to your creel.
CRABBING.
This requires more courage and
endurance than skill. Advance boldly
upon the crab and, as it charges,
present the fore-, or index, finger of
the right hand to it, when the fierce
creature will promptly fasten upon it.
All that then remains to be done is to
wait until the crab dies.
LOBSTERING.
The method of catching the lobster
is the same, but more painful. You
may die first.
LURING THE LIMPET.
For this sport some seccotine, a
hammer (or mallet) and a geologist's
chisel are necessary. Having sighted
the limpet, stalk it cautiously from the
rear. If you see it preparing to spring,
the only thing to do is to retreat and
try it on with another limpet. If,
however, you succeed in getting to
close quarters without awakening the
fiery mollusc, seccotine it instantly to
attack you. The rest is simple. Take
your hammer (or mallet) and chisel,
and break off the portion of the rock
on which the limpet is perched.
Alternative Method.
Blast it off with dynamite.
Note to Mothers.
No child under ten years of age
should be trusted with this dangerous
explosive.
SNARING THE SHRIMP.
It is considered unsporting to use a
net in the chase of the shrimp. All the
best shrimpers now employ a running
noose, which should be dangled in a
pool. When a shrimp enters the
noose, strike sharply. A landing net
or gaff is generally unnecessary. All
shrimps under 3 dwt.s. in weight
should be returned. -
N.B. Thick leather gauntlets should
be worn, as the sting of the shrimp
has been known to be fatal.
PoTTING THE PRAwN.
Proceed as above, but with a larger
noose. The prawn needs more careful
playing than the shrimp, from which
it may be distinguished by its more
sonorous cry when agitated.
Close Season: October 1st to June
31st.
OGLING THE Octopus.
The octopus is not, fortunately, a
common object of the sea-shore, at
least not north of Clacton-on-Sea.
If, however, you should espy on the
sand a trail like that of eight winkles
running round in a circle, you may be
pretty sure you are hot on the slot of
this denizen of the deep. When you
have tracked it down, look it boldly
and steadily in the eye. In its anxiety
to avoid your gaze, it will retreat into
itself, until it has turned itself com-
pletely inside out. It is then perfectly
harmless, and may be readily hand-
cuffed and presented to the Zoo.
BOOT SHOP.
THE Complete Sportsman has many
things to learn beyond the mere
handling of his gun and the successful
pursuit of his quarry. He must try to
remember what powder he is using, and
why, so that he can answer questions
on the subject without furtively looking
at one of his cartridges. He is also
very apt to be asked if he believes in
Number 6 shot for grouse—and that is
rather a trap in its way, because the
larger the number the smaller the shot.
And he must not mistake a young grey
hen for a wild duck, or he will find
must be able to talk about his boots.
He will find that his companions by
common consent reserve the “best
hour of the day"—after lunch—for
this one absorbing topic. And so eager
do they become that they can with
difficulty restrain themselves to listen
to the breeziest anecdotes about other
people's boots.
“. . . I have had this pair for seven
years and they have been worn hard.
Of course, I never let 'em put any
blacking on them; but it's an absolute
fact that they will take me through a
field of wet swedes now without letting
in a single drop. I got them from
Pucklington's.”
“. . . . Well, these of mine were
made by a chap in Dumfries, in a little
shop in a back street. They cost me
twenty-seven bob two years ago, and
they are every bit as good as new.
Pucklington charges you forty-five, and
in my experience they nearly always
crack.”
“. . . I got this pair in Norway"—
(sensation). “They are real ski boots
—built for snow—and the only fault of
'em is that they are a bit hard. But I
can stick my foot in a bog any time
and be none the worse."
“. . . I wonder if it is a good plan
having the seams outside like that?”
“. . . I always walk in shoes. Can't

It is at about this point that I come
in. I always say that mine were made
by the village blacksmith, that I keep
them under water when not in use,
that they are thirteen years old, and
cost three-and-nine.
But I believe I have discovered the
reason of it. You have had a heavy
morning, let us say, and you are
lunching (late) in a gully on the moor.
You are pretty certain to be sitting on
a game bag with your back to a bank,

speaking of ordinary years). After you

cherry whisky and lit your pipe, you

WHY DO MEN MARRY 2
SENSATIONAL REVELATIONs.
WHEN a man marries, is it, as is
commonly believed by the person most
intimately concerned, due to her great
beauty, coupled with exceptional in-
tellectual attainments? If not, what
is the reason 2 The following letters
would seem to throw some light on
this most interesting of problems:–
DEAR SIR,-For years and years I
had been giving wedding presents, but
no one had ever given me one.
DEAR SIR,--It was like this with
me. I never intended getting married.
I was sitting out with a rather nice
girl at a dance. We seemed to have
come to an end of the topics which
were mutually interesting, so, merely to
make conversation, I proposed . . . It
was very thoughtless of me.
DEAR SIR,--I married because I
wanted someone to share my fortune
with the CHANCELLOR.
DEAR SIR,--I married my wife be-
cause I disliked the woman so much.
When I was young she jilted me.
Then the other fellow jilted her.
Years afterwards, when I was a crusty
old bachelor with fixed selfish habits,
she was still a spinster, so I married
her. A pretty revenge, I fancy you
will agree.
DEAR SIR,--I married as an example
to my children.
DEAR SIR,--I married for peace. I
am exceptionally handsome, many per-
sons holding that I am remarkabl
like the late Apollo. I did it, hoping

attentions with which I was pestered
by my lady friends. Unfortunately it
has not done so, and I may have to
grow a beard.

married because I loved her money.
She married because she loved me.
My love has proved to be more durable
than hers, and I apologise for being
compelled to send this letter to you
unstamped.
DEAR SIR,--I married her because I
loathe being sued for breach of pro-
mise.
DEAR SIR,-My marriage was due
to a lack of frankness on my part. I
got engaged to the lady at the seaside,
and she did not understand that it was
only for the Silly Season, nor did her
DEAR SIR,--I have only just done
it, and I have done it to spite LLoyd

get threepence a week from me, and
threepence a week from the poor soul
who does for me, so I have just married
her—to LLoyd GEORGE's rage, con-
sternation, and surprise.

not like the idea of my name (Jones)
dying out.

Frankly, you have me. I have been
wondering for over thirty years, and I
am dashed if I know.

A TALE OF TWO SISTERS.
MILDRED and Jane were sisters, but Mildred alone had
style:
Both of them were good-looking, but Jane, who was void
of guile, -
Was a doormat as well as a saint, and her taste in dress
was vile.
Jane from the first accepted the rôle of her sister's slave,
Cheerfully fetched and carried, cheerfully also gave
Out of her pocket-money whatever she managed to save.
Thirty summers have passed since I first encountered the pair,
And Mildred, who must be forty, is slim as well as fair;
While Jane, the virtuous drudge, looks rather the worse
for wear.
For Mildred married a magnate who made his pile in mines,
And is widely famed for his motors, his chef and his
priceless wines—
There seldom passes a week but a peer at his table dines.
Her entertainments figure (p. 4) in The Daily Mail;
The sheen of her ruby tiara turns most of her rivals pale;
Her life is one long carnival of endless cakes and ale,
Jane married a struggling parson, who hadn't a single sou,
And, like the famous old woman we read of who lived in a
shoe, .
She has so many children that she doesn't know what to do.
But, unlike the same old woman, whose methods were
harsh and crude, - -
Jane sacrifices her comfort to that of her graceless brood,
Mildred's daughters are pretty, but they simply haven't a
chance, -
For their mother dances divinely and never misses a
dance. - - -
The local milliner makes their frocks; for hers she goes to
France. . . .
Yet Mildred's daughters, I know, of their selfish mother
are proud,
While Jane's despised by her children as a thorough-going
dowd, - -
Who could only be expected “to pass with a push in a
crowd.”
The moral of this sad story I add in a brief P.S.:
O saints of the family j, pray study the art of dress;
For a saint who is also a slattern will never achieve

Of Government goods in the town;

And tells you as much with a frown:
Miss Thomson is tiring her hair at the

And drives you away to Miss Brown.

And baccy and candles and cheese.
She is tender and kindly and willing,
She never compels me to wait;
All telegrams strike her as thrilling,
Her eyes, as they read 'em, dilate;
She is charmed when I squander as
much as a shilling
On the maw of a ravenous State.
At a time when so few things are sunny,
Such virtue shall find its reward;
If I have to keep parting with money
To pile up the Treasury's hoard,
I will spend it down here, in this

And roses and peaceful accord.

to the Atlantic.
There were six of us—Dad, myself, Peggy, John, John's
nurse Julia, and Soo-Ti, the Pekinese dog; and Dad was in
charge. He said he was determined to show that men
were not the useless and ornamental creatures they were
generally supposed to be, but that they could beat women
on their own ground, and really do things if it was necessary.
He said he knew well enough it was a difficult game to
look after a family party on a journey, and to keep house
in seaside lodgings, and then to bring them all back again,
but he wasn't going to show the white feather, and he
thought he could pull through. If kindness was useless
with us he said he was quite prepared to employ sterner
methods. He took a box of chocolates in his pocket in
order to be prepared for everything, and he gave a big
chocolate to John so as to get on good terms with him,
because he said John was the one he was most afraid of.
If he could manage John he thought he could bring the
whole thing off successfully. Dad's always been pretty
good at buying newspapers at stations and getting angry
with guards and porters, but this time he had to do every-
thing, and I must say he wasn't nearly so bad at it as we
thought he was going to be.
The first thing that happened was that when we got to
our own station, Soo-Ti wasn't there. Everybody thought
everybody else had got him, and the consequence was he
had been left behind with Dad's waterproof and the
Thermos flask which had got all our hot tea in it. Luckily
our house is quite near the station, and there was lots of
time, so Henry, the footman, rushed home. He found
everything, and got back five minutes before the train
started. He had had to chase Soo-Ti twice round the
garden because Soo-Ti doesn't like footmen, but he had
wrapped him up in the waterproof and brought him like
that. It made Soo-Ti furious, and he didn't recover the
whole of that day. Besides, he hates his harness and his
lead, and when they're put on he stands with his head
down looking just like a bison; you have to drag him all
over the place.
We had had lunch before we started. Last year we
lunched in the train, and John swallowed a bit of pear the
wrong way and got very red in the face. Rosie made a
poem about it, but I can only remember one verse, which
was this:—
“We took some lunch for the baby boy
Who finds in eating his chiefest joy.
We gave him a pear; he began to choke,
And choked all the way to Basingstoke.”
This year our cousin Sylvia joined us at Basingstoke.
If you can think of pink roses mixed up with strawberries
and cream, and all smiling, that's what she looks like.
Dad was glad to see her because he said the load was
getting too heavy for him, and we were all jolly glad to see
her too. We changed at that station, and Dad and all the
guards and porters ran up and down the platform looking
for an empty carriage for us. Dad said afterwards he had
been quite surprised to find how near he was to his old
form; but it was all no good. We had to get into a
carriage where there was one old gentleman with a beard,
| what good manners little boys can have when they try.
in. He sniffed a good deal, and Dad and he glared at one
another without saying anything. Then we had our tea, and
of course there was a lot of paper and crumbs on the floor
of the carriage, and some of the milk got spilt. Milk
always does get spilt somehow, and when you try to rub
it away with your foot there's always a white stain left
and you can't disguise it. It really was very unlucky for
the old gentleman, but I must say he bore it very well.
It was here that John distinguished himself and showed
He had been looking at the old gentleman when we were
having our tea, and at last he got very pink in the face and
leant across to Dad and said, “Daddy, you haven't given
this gentleman any tea.” At first Dad looked puzzled, but
then he pulled himself together and said, “There's plenty
of tea left, Sir; won't you have a cup 2" and the old
gentlemen said, “Upon my word, as you are so polite, I
think I will. Thank you very much; ” and then he said John
was a Good Samaritan, and Dad and he got talking to-

hadn't met for years. So it all ended in a very pleasant.
way, and we didn't have any more adventures, and in the
end we arrived safe and sound at our lodgings. -
Next morning we went out and bought two spades an

shoes, and then we got to work on the sands. In fact,
everything's as jolly as possible, except the weather, and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“READY MONEY.”
ILEARN from one of our Photographic
Weeklies that The Merry Wives of
Windsor is being played in Tokio, and
I judge from the appearance of Mrs.
Quickly and Mistress Page that certain
features of SHAKSPEARE's original de-
sign must have been lost in trans-
mission. Something of this same kind
seems to have happened with Mr.
Montgomery's Ready Money, as made
in America. In crossing the water
and being translated into English it
has sacrificed nearly all the essentials
of local colour. Its geography is still
American, but its native idiom and its
native slang (I assume that they were
there in the original) are gone, and
the native accent with them. And if
its commercial sentiments remain
imperishably Transatlantic — if, for
example, the passionate admiration
kindled by the flashing of a bunch of
thousand-dollar notes is clearly indigen-
ous to the Western Hemisphere—the
expression of these exotic emotions by
British lips in British phraseology
sounds strange even to the verge of
incredibility.
Fortunately, however, the sea-change
does not seem to have materially
damaged the play. After all, a detective
melodrama appeals to a class of mind
not easily susceptible to the subtler
pangs of outraged congruity. And the
main idea—the exhibition of forged
notes as a mere bluff to indicate a
sudden access of solvency—was so
fresh, the intrigue so arresting, the
movement so smooth and rapid, that
it would be ungracious to cavil at
trifling improbabilities.
There was a pleasant novelty in the
arrangement by which the villain and
the virtuous hero were made to work
together like brothers, hand in hand.
So closely were their fates interwoven
that we were almost indistinguishably
glad at the escape of both, our-blunted
sense of moral justice being more than
satisfied by the combined triumph of
innocence and guilt over the New York
Secret Service.
The villain, too, is an artist, and
that counts for much. Not merely an
artist in crime, but a connoisseur of
decorative engraving. The forged
notes which he hands to the hero to
tide him over a financial crisis (never
actually “passed" by the latter, for
our tolerance could not have gone that
length) are works of art; he prides
himself on their superiority to the
Government article; and when, after
careful inspection by the detectives,
tl:ey are taken for genuine notes, it is in
destroys them, indignant that their
finer quality should have escaped
recognition.
The attraction of the play lay in its
admirable blending of fun with serious
melodrama. It was not the kind of
humour which makes a burlesque of
melodrama; nor was it introduced by
way of relief to the tension; the changes
from gay to grave and back again were
of the very essence of the design.
Mr KENNETH. Douglas as the hero
was extraordinarily good. His remark-
able performance in Dad had prepared
us for the almost total disappearance
of his old air of indifferent detachment.
THE “DECORATOR.”
Potter (alias Ives, alias Walker)
Mr. ALLAN AYNESWORTH.
Quiet and restrained, he was still always
alert at moments when the slightest
hesitancy would have ruined the situa-
tion. As the villain who incidentally
found himself a philanthropist (taking
50 per cent. of the profits) Mr. ALLAN
AYNEsworth was thoroughly at home
in his new house. The decorative
dignity of the part suited him well.
Never have I seen so many glossy
silk hats on a stage, and his was the
curliest of them all. The minor male
characters were satisfactory, Mr. BENE-
DICT being particularly mobile, and Mr.
HARRY CANE recalling pleasantly the
manner of the late Mr. BLAKELEY.
There were a few fiancées scattered
from time to time about the stage, with
or without Miss MAY WHITTY to
chaperon them; but they served no
very useful purpose. They were sup-
posed to act as incentives to the
men. But being Americans (as alleged)
these young men could easily have
done without any encouragement.
Mr. ALLAN AYNEsworth has been
bold in starting his first managerial
adventure in the very heart of the off-
season, and most cordially I wish him
the success that his sporting courage
and the excellence of his production
alike deserve. O. S.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. ALGERNoN BLACKwood holds a monopoly of a certain
line in uncanniness. Pan's Garden (MACMILLAN) is a col-
lection of shorter and longer sketches in which mainly
some mystical and quasi-personal activity of the wood, the
sea, the desert, the hills, the snows, is suggested with a
singular skill, a subtly ingenious symbolism and a welcome
distinction of phrasing. Perhaps “The Glamour of the
Snow,” a story in which some maleficent spirit in the form
of a mysterious and coldly beautiful grey lady on skis lures
a susceptible literary alpinist to danger and all but death,
is the best in this kind; while “The Attic,” in a different
mood, is a finely drawn study in shadows. Mr. BLACK-
wood's work stimulates one to an exacting standard of
criticism; to a protest against the little shirt-sleeve phrases
showing through the purple patches, against such mere
fountain-pen pictures as “the moonlight falling in a shower
of silver spears upon the slates and wires and steeples”
(italics ours); against a drawing-out of the agony of
mystification which is sometimes, it has to be confessed,
a little wearisome. But I have the half of a horrible
suspicion that a jaded, city-ridden critic hasn't the real
entry to Pan's Garden; he can, however, heartily (and with a
touch of envy), commend it to those more fortunate who
have. Among Mr. GRAHAM-RoBERTSON's drawings the
beauty and directness of his illustration of “The Attic”
seem worth any three or four of the more ambitious others.
WE all want to distinguish ourselves outside our own
peculiar spheres, and Mrs. LEVERSON, like so many other
I did so take her in The Limit; but in her new book,
Tenterhooks (GRANT RICHARDs), which also deals with a
love intrigue manqué, she is not quite so successful with
her imported gravity. I was never really persuaded to
believe in the vagaries of the husband, though the uncon-
scious humour of this futile egoist was always acceptable.
It is no matter for surprise that Mrs. LEveRson knows
more of a woman's mind than of a man's, and more of
a man's attitude to women than to his own sex. Clearly
—and I cannot blame her for this—she has never assisted
at the confidences which men impart to one another at
their clubs. She seems, indeed, to be less happy with the
things that she invents than with those that she observes,
and is at her best in those light and frivolous touches
with which she seizes superficial eccentricities when she
can find a subject to draw from life. The conversational
gifts of Captain Willis, for instance, are realised in the very
briefest sitting: “Do you know, what I always say is—
live and let live, and let it go at that; what? But people
won't, you know, they won't—and there it is.” er
children, too, are most delectable. There is Archie, who
declines to give direct expression to his revolt against the
birth of a baby sister, but conveys it through a figurative
medium: “I had such a lovely dream last night, mother!'
‘Did you, pet? How sweet of you! What was it?’
‘Oh, nothing much. . . . I dreamt I was in heaven.’
“Really How delightful. Who was there?' This is
always a woman's first question. “Oh you were there,
of course; and father. . Such a nice place.’ ‘Was
Dilly there?’ ‘Dilly? Er—no—no–she wasn't. . She
was in the night nursery, with Satan.’” I could wish for
more of this gay cynicism, which is Mrs. LEVERSON's

natural humorists, is anxious to be taken seriously. And
particular possession; but there is enough of it to repay

the reader of Tenterhooks, though it may not be the best
thing she has yet done.
I am beginning sadly to think that I am more ambitious
for Mr. PERCY WHITE than he is for himself. Each time
I begin a novel from his fluent pen I say, “This is going to
be IT,” and at the end I have to resign myself to another
period of waiting. In To-Day (CoNSTABLE) he proves once
more that no point in the great (or little) social game can
escape his eye or his irony, but it is, I hope, permissible to
remind him that even the popular sport of snob-baiting may
in time become a little tedious. Here he chooses a militant
suffragette for his heroine, and decks her with bewitching
beauty and charm. It may be argued that Dulcie Ellice's
opinions were so very up-to-date that she required all the
graces her creator could find for her, but all the same I
should have respected Mr. WHITE more (even if I loved
Dulcie less) had he handicapped her with a slight squint
A confessedly “comic" novel is tickl.sh handling for the
reviewer. To treat it severely is to expose oneself to
suspicion of the gravest of all crimes—lack of humour.
That is why I approached The Barmecide's Feast (LANE)
with caution. It is also why I hasten to add about it that
I did laugh several times. But not quite so often as the
prefatory poem and the wholly delightful pictures had led
me to expect. One might perhaps say of Mr. John GoRE's
book that it apparently represents the savings of a lifetime.
I picture the author, whenever he heard or invented a joke,
rushing with it to his notes, and saying to himself, “Soon
I must make a story that shall hold them all.” What the
story is that resulted it would be futile for me to attempt
to repeat; irresponsibility and the art of talking nonsense,
sometimes clever, often medium, and occasionally silly, have
here been carried to their limit. It is humorous and original
—but the two qualities do not always coincide. Thus to
speak of a person who was hanged as having “fallen from
a platform while in con-
or a provincial accent.
The way, in fact, is made
too easy for her. It is,
however, Dulcie's in-
fluence upon the life of
her father and not of her
fatherland that gives Mr.
WHITE an opportunity
to show his admirable
sense of comedy. Randal
Ellice was a pompous
M.P., and the struggle be-
tween his self-importance
and his love for Dulcie is
told with a wit which has
grown mellower and
kindlier in the course of
years. To - Day deals
so vividly with topical
questions that it is sure
to be one of the successes
of the season, and if Mr.
WHITE is content with

EDWARD WHITE's camping methods and musings in a
| Californian forest, the knowledge, sympathy and skill
| necessary to make a delightful book of outdoor jolli-
nesses. . And they won't be disappointed. Mr. WHITE
writes charmingly of his friends, man, mule and tree, finned
things and feathered, in an unaustere but, for the most
part, authentic English, varied only occasionally by such
explosions as “He snapped shut the book.” The philo-
sophy of old California John the Ranger alone makes the
book notable. Of such simple things as an impatient
intellectual, engaged in sawing through a log, he has pro-
foundly wise things to say—the kind of thing that strikes
you in a flash as significantly true. I should like to quote,
but you'll find it in the chapter “On the Conduct of Life.”
| As from all books written by folk who really know their
ground, so here one takes not entertainment merely, but
knowledge, knowledge specifically of the kind of work
involved in that new task of forest conservation in America
(HE IN E M A N N). As a
story, it is at once simpler and more kindly. The two
families who between them contain almost all its characters
are drawn with a most attractive sympathy. The house-
hold in the hills, especially, where Clara Rutherford, the
mother-woman, tends and loves her two men-folk, weak
husband and unforgiving son—this is something that I feel
the earlier Miss YouNG could not have created. The town
home also, in which Edward Webb strives with circumstance
to bring up his little daughters, is hardly less successful.
There is certainly some quality of distinction in this author's
work which everyone must feel, but probably most readers
would find it difficult to define. The gift of phrase she has

Under the Cross for sign,
Such was his life's crusade; and, as their death
Inspired in men a purpose pure of taint—
In some great cause to give their latest breath—
o died this soldier-saint.
Nay, his the nobler warfare, since his hands
Set free the thralls of misery and her brood–
Hunger and haunting shame and sin that brands—
And gave them hope renewed.
Druised souls, and bodies broken by despair,
He healed their heartache and their wounds he
dressed, - - -
And drew them, so redeemed, his task to share,
Sworn to the same high quest.
Armed with the Spirit's wisdom for his sword,
His feet with tidings of salvation shod,
He know no foes save only such as warred
Against the peace of God.
Scorned or acclaimed, he kept his harness bright,
Still, through the darkest hour, untaught to yield,
And at the last, his face toward the light,
Fell on the victor's field.
No laurelled blazon rests above his bier,
Yet a great people bows its stricken head -
Where he who fought without reproach or fear,
Soldier of Christ, lies dead.
O. S.
A FREE SHAVE.
HE was walking up and down the empty shop when I
came in. An absent-minded barber, I thought, for when
I said, “Shave, please !” as I settled into the chair, he
was some moments in showing the alacrity usual in the
profession. But his “Certainly, Sir " when it came, had
the right ring of enthusiasm about it, and he bustled in
search of a towel as one aroused to some purpose.
“Hot or cold, Sir?” he enquired, as he rammed volu-
minous folds into the back of my collar. “Cold is said to
stimulate the growth of the beard; I will therefore assume
that you preſer hot. There are authorities for the other,
but the literature of barbering is painfully scanty. SHAw
—I am a Shavian of course. . . .”
I groaned.
“Too hot, Sir 2" he asked sympathetically. “I think
not—but, if so, the temperature will soon fall by evapora-
tion. A little patience—to the philosophic mind. . . .”
“Look here,” I expostulated, “can't you fall back upon
the weather or something? Your method is too original
for this hour of the morning.” -
“Ah, I feared as much,” he said. “My grandmother
always would have it that I was original. Fatal, ineradi-
cable gift 1"
I looked askance at him; he had found a razor and was
the towel from my neck, wipe off the lather and fly; and
the next moment he had begun again.
“The art of conversation,” he said, “is one in which,
contrary to popular opinion, barbers seldom excel. I begin
to perceive that I am no exception to the rule. (Head
well back, if you please—I intend to begin at the throat
- Nay, do not shrink; my intentions are strictly
humane.) I am necessarily unacquainted with your cast of
mind; your politics, your entire view of life are unknown to
me. (Do you mind if I hold you by the nose 2 It gives
me a certain senso of purchase. Thank you.) All kinds of
subtle correspondences might have been possible between
us (your beard is a trifle stiffer than mine, I notice); cast
away, let us say, upon a desert island, we might achieve
the most marvellous interchanges, such as only a HENRY
JAMES could do justice to. But, as we are—(No, on second
thoughts I think I will adopt a sideways stroke for your
upper lip; the nose must be left intact at all costs—a fine
feature, Sir, if I may say so)—as we are, I say, with our
opportunities of communication so unavoidably restricted,
we can barely touch the surface of things. It is very sad.
One might almost as well be a dentist. (Keep the mouth
closed, if you will be so good).” f
He was shaving me with extreme care, but not very
expertly, retaining a firm grasp upon my nose, which he
used as a convenient lever when he wanted to turn my
head from one side to the other.
“I cad’t if you dod’t let go of by dose,” I said.
bust breathe.” -
“True. I will hold it higher up. All theories of method
must be modified in face of the stern primal necessities of
Life. We begin to touch fundamentals after all—but, alas,
only when the moment of our parting is near. There
—I have finished—and, I am gratified to find, without a
single gash. I will not tempt Providence by going over
you again; I am sure you will find that short enough for
the present fashion. It only remains. . . .”
He was squirting at my face with the spray.
“Here,”I said, “you haven't washed off the soap yet.”
“Believe me,” he rejoined, “it is better thus.” He kept
the spray going till rivulets of bay-rum and soap were
trickling freely into the towel about my neck. “There,”
he said, “I am sure you will agree with me that that is
a method at once more generous and more hygienic. I
always prefer to dry my own face; your feeling, no doubt,
is the same. Here is a dry towel.” -
I responded mechanically. My mind refused to deal
adequately with this person. I got up in silence and felt
in my pocket for pennies. -
“No, Sir,” he said. “Not on any account. It has
been an interesting experience for me—I hope, indeed,
for us both—and I could not dream of taking any remun-
eration. Think of me sometimes—that is all I ask of you.”
At this moment a fresh arrival entered. “Beg pardon,
gen’lemen,” he said, “I must have missed hearing the bell;
I was jest getting my dinner. Now, which of you gen’le-
men is first 2"
“My honour, I think,” said the late operator, as he
settled himself into the chair I had vacated.
“Shan't be above two minutes, Sir,” said the barber, as
I reaghed out for my hat.
“Thanks,” I said, “I will forgo the pleasure.”
“Wud
“At time of wiring the Artillery are back in camp, and I am informed
that they did better to-day than yesterday. They fired two series of
sixty rounds at a Battery of six guns and at an Infantry supposed to
have been in a well.”—Ceylon Independent.
The day before, the infantry had been supposed to be in
moodily stropping it. I checked a craven impulse to snatch
a balloon, and the results were not so deadly.

CAUGHT NAPPING.
AMONG the brown trout that frequent
Shy Corner, few are better known and
more respected than Wiscount Howie-
toun and William Smith (one of the
Haslemere Smiths). This evening they
were lying at the bottom of the chalk
stream among the reeds, idly gossiping.
It was their custom to meet here most
nights of the week and dine together.
To the left of them lay a large flat
stone, and the Viscount called his
friend's attention to a fat fresh-water
shrimp on the top of it. “Help your-
self,” said he.
“Your shrimp, old man,'
thing deserve all they get. I have no
sympathy with the young idiots.”
For a while they continued feeding
and even lay on a little after the meal
was done. But at last there arrived
almost on the very nose of William
such a mass of fuzz and feather as
was an insult to any experienced and
intelligent fish. Genial and lazily
pleasant about most things, there was
one thing that these two old cronies
could not tolerate, and that was any
reflection upon the wariness of which
they proudly boasted.
“This,” said William, “is beyond a
joke. It is an affront.”
“More,” replied the Wiscount, “it is
comatose silence;
come here oftener?”
William let his friend talk on.
“There is a pleasant something about
the water that appeals to me. Is it not
a movement, a curious sort of ripple 2
Do you notice it 2"
William shook his tail in a lazy
negative.
“I am indeed in a mood to imagine
pleasant things" (the Wiscount was
getting garrulous, in a happy and
sleepy sort of way), “but I don't think
that I am imagining this. The water
does indeed vibrate around one, in a
manner which is both refreshing and
soothing. Surely you must feel it?”
But William did not an-
“why don't we

liam courteously. -
“Not for me, thanks. I
never take hors d'oeuvres. . . .
And now shall we feed 2 I
am feeling peckish.” And
the two moved slowly up
towards the surface.
“Poor cousin Hilda,” said
William, as he poked his
fastidious nose out of the
water and absorbed a Blue
Winged Olive, “we’ve seen
the last of her.”
“Not really 2” said the
Wiscount, as he too helped
himself. “I am deeply dis-
tressed to hear that. She
was a great favourite of mine.
How sad (There is a Pale
Watery Dun to your right, if
you care for them.) A vic-
tim, I suppose, of the eternal
feminine curiosity ?”
“Yes, poor ; Anything
new and garish attracted her.
To me it was always a won-
der that she remained with
us for so long. I was talking

The two were now lying in
Indian file, William a yard or
two in front of his friend.
Asleep or not, it was too
much bother to turn round.
But the genial effect of having
dined prevented the Wiscount
either from being offended
or from ceasing his soliloquy.
“Delicious,” he murmured,
“gradually increasing and
quite delicious. We must
certainly come here again.

There was a sudden dis

William awoke with a jerk;

round and see what on earth

which he himself had been shrieking
with laughter a few minutes before.
It was quite unnerving, I'm told, to
see the dear girl's shame and annoyance
as she rushed past Lady Mary and all
her set with the gawdy thing sticking
in her mouth.”
“Girls will be girls,” said the Wis-
count, “but really the credulity of the
young is astounding. . . . Have you
been pestered with any of the new Hal-
ford patterns 2 See There's one

things up very well nowadays. I could

THE CONQUERING TOUCH.
WHEN I became engaged to Fred
I realized he was a nut,
His hair lay plastered on his head,
His coats were of the latest cut,
His socks were silk, his footwear
(brogued)
Paid tribute to the best of blacking,
Yet our engagement I prorogued,
For still there seemed a something
lacking.
I had no quarrel with his eyes,
His finger-nails were well preserved,
Alluring was his taste in ties,
His figure slim, yet nicely curved ;
His wit, I'm glad to say, was tame
(I shy at brains when over-rapid),
Yet it annoyed me all the same
That Frederick's face should be so
vapid.
Until he spent a week at Ryde,
And how, on his return, I thrilled !
The blank expression I decried
Had, in the interim, been fiſled;
One inch of auburn whisker lay
On either cheek in chaste equation,
I lifted mine and named the day
Without the smallest hesitation.
A HINT FOR PUBLISHERS.
UNDER the heading “Corsican Shoot-
ing Mystery,” The Daily Chronicle,
after giving the details of a mysterious
attempt to murder the British Vice-
consul at Bonifacio, continues: “The
district in which the affair took place
is that in which the scene of H. Seton
Merriman's Corsican vendetta story,
“The Isle of Unrest,' is laid.” -
This geographical method of adver-
tising works of fiction suggests develop-
ments which we have endeavoured to
forecast in the following announce-
ments:— -
“While assisting at a water carni-
val at Biarritz, Lord FitzBoodle, one
of the recent Liberal creations, was
upset, in his motor-catamaran and
rescued with some difficulty by a gallant
Basque mariner named Pierre Arozte-
guy Arrozagaray, of Zugarramurdy.
What lends peculiar interest to the
incident is the fact that one of the
scenes in Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEUx's
new novel, The Purple Cummerbund,
is laid at Bayonne, which is only a
few miles from the scene of the
disaster.”
“Sir Albert Blond, while recently
stalking capercailzie on his deer forest
in the isle of Skye, was suddenly
assaulted by a peat-hag of the most

IV.-HE Is CHRISTENED,
ON the morning of the christening,
as I was on my way to the bathroom,
I met Simpson coming out of it.
There are people who have never
seen Simpson in his dressing gown ;
people also who have never waited for
the sun to rise in glory above the
snowcapped peaks of the Alps; who
have never stood on Waterloo Bridge
and watched St. Paul's come through
the mist of an October morning. Well,
well, one cannot see everything.
“Hallo, old chap!”he said. “I was
just coming to talk to you. I want
your advice.”
“A glass of hot water the last thing
at night,” I said, “no sugar or milk, a
Turkish bath once a week and plenty
of exercise. You'll get it down in no
time.”-
“Don't be an ass. I moan about
the christening. I've been to a wedding,
of course, but that isn't quite the same
thing.” - -
“A moment, while I turn on the
tap.” I turned it on and came back
to him. “Now then, I'm at your
service.”
“Well, what's the er—usual cos-
tume for a christening 2" -
“Leave that to the mother,” I said.
“She'll see that the baby's dressed
properly.”
“I mean for a godfather.”
Dahlia has conveniently placed a
sofa outside the bathroom door. I
dropped into it and surveyed the dress-
ing-gown thoughtfully.
“Go like that,” I said at last.
“What I want to know is whether
it's a top-hat affair or not ?”
“Have you brought a top-hat?”
“Of course.”
“Then you must certainly
say! Come out of it, Myra !”
I jumped up from the sofa, but it
was too late. She had stolen my bath.
“Well, of all the cheek 3 *

appeared round the corner.

“The two noble godfathers,” he mur-
mured.
Meanwhile the two godfathers con-
tinued to gaze at each other, as if
fascinated. At last Simpson spoke.
“We can't both be right,” he said
slowly to himself.
Thomas woke up.
“Is it the christening to-day ? I
quite forgot."
“It is, Thomas.

“Well, I can change afterwards.
You don't expect me to wear anything
like that ?” he said, pointing to
Simpson.
“Don't change,” said Archie. “Both

Simpson collected his breakfast and
sat down next to Myra.
“Am I all right?” he asked her
doubtfully.
“Your tie's up at the back of your
neck,” I said.
“Because if Dahlia would prefer it,”
he went on, ignoring me, “I could
easily wear a plain dark tweed?”
“You’re beautiful, Samuel,” said
Myra. “I hope you'll look as nice at
my wedding.”
“You don't think I shall be mistaken
for the father ?” he asked anxiously.

“I think you're right,” said Simpson,
and after breakfast he changed into the

As the hour approached we began to
collect in the hall, Simpson reading the
service to himself for the twentieth
time.
“Do we have to say anything?”
asked Thomas, as he lit his third pipe.
Simpson looked at him in horror.
“Say anything? Of course we do!
Haven't you studied it? Here, you'll
just have time to read it through.”
“Too late now. Better leave it to
the inspiration of the moment,” I sug-
gested. “Does anybody know if there's
a collection, because if so I shall have
to go and get some money.”
“There will be a collection for the
baby afterwards,” said Archie. “I
hope you've all been saving up.”

“Isn't Mr. Simpson looking well ?”
said Myra in a society voice. “And

suit I've seen him in to-day.”
“Well, are we all ready?”
“You're quite sure about his name?”
said Archie to his wife. “This is your

“I think Peter is rather silly,” I said.

(Culled from an authentic paean by a

THE village of St. Pierre is situated
at a height of 1675 m. above sea. It
is gently exposed to the full sun on a
little hill flank, in the middle of fat
and nice smelling meadows, surrounded
with dark forests of fir and lark-trees
with balsamic scent.
It is the railway station of S. . . .
which makes the service for the valley

lets to St. Pierre in a little hour, until
we get the funiculaire. On that day
which is not very far off, the Hotel
shall have to widen her winks, and
open her doors very large.
Nothing is more pleasant in its shape
of pure soil than the defaced cottages
of St. Pierre made brown by the sun
and the sunburnt mountain, perched
on their spurs, and from the top of
their belvidere seeming to throw over
the valley their astonished looks.
St. Pierre has conserved its vulgar
old bake-house of the common, where
the eighty families of the place have
their bread baked on each turn, two
families for every twenty-four hours
and three times a year.
As for the watering of their meadows,
in a place where rain is rare, the
Pierrons were obliged to have recourse
to the establishment of artificial lakes
which are no less than little marvels
of primif art, realised with the courage,
the strength and the audaciousness.
The surroundings of St. Pierre offer
ravishing walks: first of all the Pierre
des Sauvages, ten minutes above the
village, immense erratic block of a
hundred metre cubes volume, holed by
a quantity of druidic bowls of a real
historic interest.

But there we are already very far
from St. Pierre, our centre of radiation,
where we shall return through the
way of the Thalweg. The beautiful
terrace of the Hotel appears behind its
row of service trees, fresh and folded,
whose coral berries wave softly under
a lukewarm scented evening zephyr.
We have arrived at our point of
departure, happy return to the port
of salvation, where, after the emotions of
the day, we feel so comfortably to taste
the true native hospitality.

THE HISTORIC DRAMA.
ANTICIPATIONS of the success of the
new historical play at a West End
theatre which are being allowed to steal
into the Press so unassumingly have
sent many of our managers and dra-
matists to history in search of similarly
promising material, with a few results
that can already be announced.
Under the title of The White Ship
Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER is placing on
the stage of the St. James's a realistic
version of the tragedy of the ill-fated
Young Prince WILLIAM who, it will
be recollected, went down in a vessel
of that name. The Second Act will
witness the shipwreck, and the shi
will be an exact copy of the White
Heather lent for the purpose by Mr.
MYLEs KENNEDY. This touch, it is
thought, will extend the interest of the
play by capturing the sympathies of
yachtsmen, who are not at present
the most assiduous of playgoers. The
Third Act will illustrate HENRY I.'s
inability to smile again after the
calamity, and in order to emphasise
the uncompromising nature of his grief
a number of our funniest comedians
have been engaged to fire jokes at the
bereaved monarch. Thus we shall
have the spectacle of a house and
stage in roars of laughter with the
exception of one impassive royal figure.
The final tragedy of the King's death
from a surfeit of lampreys is expected
to be one of the most striking gastro-
nomic scenes ever placed upon the stage.
Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER has no part
in the play himself, but he will keep
in the closest touch with the theatre
during the run and, if necessary, take
another house for a play in which he
has scope for all his varied gifts.
Mr. OsCAR AschE, it is said, will
return to London management with an
exciting drama entitled simply Clarence,
the hero of which is the luckless prince
who met his death by drowning in a
butt of malmsey. Special attention to
historical detail is promised, and those
who remember the bathing scene in
Kismet will not need to be reminded of
Mr. Asche's thoroughness. The butt is
to be immense—a great tun of Heidel-
berg in short—and real malmsey, pro-
cured at an enormous cost, will fill it,
electrically heated so that the actor who
takes Clarence's part may not catch cold.
Into this butt nightly (and at matinées)
will the Duke fall. By a happy thought,
natural to Mr. AschE, Mrs. KENNERLEY
RUMFORD has been engaged to sing a
descriptive solo after each fall of the
curtain, as was done in Kismet with
such acceptance; while during the
catastrophe she will sing all the time.

You, MATE *"

play himself, but he intends to keep
his eye closely on the theatre and, if
needful, to take another in which to
delight London audiences with a sight
of his own robust talents.
Mr. GEORGE EdwardEs is rapidly
completing his plans for a musical
comedy written around the life and
times of KING John, which is due at the
Gaiety before long. Mr. GEORGE GRos-
SMITH is, of course, the author, while the
part of King John falls to Mr. EDMUND
PAYNE. The first scene is the island
of Runnymede. Here much play will
be made with the Barons, who are to be
impersonated by some of the smartest
younger sons of London (most of whom
have failed as motor - car salesmen).
In the interest of Gaiety stallites an
equal number of Baronesses has been
added to the scene, and the signing of
Magna Charta promises to go with a
bang. The Second Act will be even
John's loss of all his clothes in the
Wash. The Baronesses here become
laundry maids, chief of whom is Miss
CoNNIE EDIss, and Mr. EDMUNDPAYNE's
drollery with them can easily be con-
ceived.
Mr. BourchIER's next appearance
as a manager will be with a sensational
drama on the subject of AIFRED THE
GREAT. Here his author has found
scope for much entertainment and
variety, and no money will be spared
in the mounting. The cakes burned
by the absent-minded King will, for
example, be supplied fresh every evening
by a famous firm not a hundred miles
from Berkeley Square, while a company
of genuine Danes from Copenhagen,
among whom will be found the inimit-
able GENEE as a vivandière, are to take
part in the battle of Ethandun. There
is unfortunately no part for Mr. Bour-
cHIER, since KING ALFRED is shown as

Mr. AschE will have no part in the
a clean-shaven man, in accordance with
funnier, for it will deal with KING

the very latest theories on that point
as evolved at Oxford (the University of
which this popular and vigorous actor-
manager is an M.A.), but he intends to
keep in close touch with the theatre
during the run and, if needful, take
another house in which to figure in a
rôle of strong bearded interest, probably
The Oyster Bed, by a native author of
promise.
Mr. CYRILMAUDE, to whose prescience
we are indebted for the introduction of
Bunty to the London stage, is already
contemplating the production of a
successor to that enormously popular
specimen of Scots domestic drama. The
subject, which is being manipulated by
Messrs. GRAHAM Moffat and HARRY
LAUDER in collaboration, deals with
the famous historical episode of BRUCE
and the Spider, and no expense will be
spared to secure entomological veri-
similitude in its presentation. Mag-
nificent specimens of the Tegenaria
domestica have been secured and are
being carefully trained under the most
favourable conditions, the ultimate
selection depending on a competition
in web-spinning, to be carried out
under the supervision of a committee
of arachnologists. Although there is
no part in the drama for Mr. Cyril,
MAUDE, who unfortunately has a great
dislike of spiders, the famous actor-
manager is resolved to keep a vigilant
eye on its preparation and, if necessary,
take another theatre in which he will
appear in a piece of a less predomin-
antly zoological interest.

ROBIN, THE SEA-BOY.
Ho, ruddy-cheeked boys and curly maids,
Who deftly ply your pails and spades,
All you who sturdily take your stand
On your pebble-buttressed forts of sand,
And thence defy
With a fearless eye
And a burst of rollicking high-pitched laughter
The stealthy trickling waves that lap you
And the crested breakers that tumble after
To souse and batter you, sting and sap you—
All you roll-about rackety little folk,
Down-again, up-again, not-a-bit brittle folk,
Attend, attend,
And let each girl and boy
... Join in a loud “Ahoy!”
For, lo, he comes, your tricksy little friend,
From the clear caverns of his crystal home
Beyond the tossing ridges of the foam :
Planner of sandy romps and wet delights,
Robin the Sea-boy, prince of ocean-sprites,
Is come, is come to lead you in your play
And fill your hearts with mirth and jocund sport to-day !
What! Can't you see him 2 There he stands
On a sheer rock and liſts his hands,
A little lad not three feet high,
With dancing mischief in his eye.
His body gleams against the light,
A clear-cut shape of dazzling white
Set off and topped by golden hair
That streams and tosses in the air.
A moment poised, he dares the leap
And cuts the wind and cleaves the deep,
Down through the emerald vaults self-hurled
That roof the sea-god's awſul world.
Another moment sees him rise
And beat the salt spray from his eyes.
He breasts the waves, he spurns their blows;
Then, like a rocket, up he goes,
Up, up to where the gusty wind
With all its wrath is left behind;
Still up he soars and high and high,
A speck of light that dots the sky.
Then watch him as he slowly droops
Where the great sea-birds wheel their troops.
Three broad-winged gulls, himself their lord,
He hitches to a silken cord,
Bits them and bridles them with skill
And bids them draw him where he will.
Above the tumult of the shores
He floats, he stoops, he darts, he soars;
From near and far he calls the rest
And waves them forward for a quest;
Then straight, without a check, he speeds
Across the azure tracts and leads
With apt reproof and cheering words
As on a chase his cry of birds.
And when he has finished his airy fun
And all his flights and his swoops are done
He will drop to the shore and lend a hand
In building a castle of weed and sand.
He will cover with flints its frowning face
To keep the tide in its proper place,
And the waves shall employ their utmost damp art
In vain to abolish your moated rampart.
And nobody's nurse shall make a fuss,
Instead of the usual how-de-do
She will give us praise when we get wet through;
In fact she will smile and think it better
When we get as wet as we like and wetter.
As for eating too much, you can safely risk it
With chocolate, lollipop, cake, and biscuit,
And your mother will revel with high delight
In the state of her own one's appetite.
Great shells there shall be of a rainbow hue
To be found and gathered by me and you;
Wonderful nets for the joy of making 'em,
And scores of shrimps for the trouble of taking 'em ;
In fact it isn't half bad—now is it 2–
When Robin the Sea-boy pays his visit.
And perhaps he will tire of his shape and habit
And change and turn to a frisky rabbit,
A plump young gadabout cheerful fellow .
With a twitching nose and a coat of yellow,
And never the smallest trace of fear
From his flashing scut to his flattened ear.
But, lo, there's a hint of coming rain,
So, presto, Robin is back again.
He liſts his head and he cocks his eye
And waves his hand and prepares to fly—
“Good-bye, Robin, good-bye, good-bye!”

THE STAMP.
IT is a very difficult case.
What should a perfectly nice, respectable person do with
an insurance stamp stuck to the roof of his mouth 2 I may,
perhaps, mention (since it will anyhow transpire later on)
that I am the person. Should I join an approved society
and throw the duty of cancelling it on to them?
º: + 3: + º: + + º:
“Richard,” said Muriel's mother (I am engaged to Muriel),
“please stick this stamp on here!”
Now, I am one who habitually rushes into perilous
enterprises with a recklessness that amounts almost to
criminallevity. I took the stamp lightly between the thumb
and forefinger of my right hand, holding the card in my
left. I then assumed a detached air, and carelessly placed
the stamp upon my tongue.
Muriel at that moment entered the room, the early
morning dew (as the saying is) still upon her. I rushed
forward to shake hands with her—I am engaged to Muriel.
As we stood hand in hand, it dawned upon me that I still
had my tongue out and that the stamp was still on it. It
is curious how quickly one's mind works in a crisis like this.
At once I realised that this was hardly the manner in which
to greet Muriel (to whom, I think I said, I am engaged).
Like a flash I drew my tongue back into my mouth.
It must have been almost twelve minutes afterwards
when I remembered the stamp. The reason for the delay is
obvious, for I know I told you I am engaged to Muriel.
A further two minutes passed, and then I found myself
sitting down with my head well back, Muriel holding a
looking-glass and a lighted candle, and her mother trying
to separate the stamp from its last resting place with the
point of a hat-pin. You see, I had, purely by misadventure,
placed the º on my tongue upside down. My own
efforts were confined to the suggestion that a well-worn
crochet hook might not have quite so penetrating a point.
The same evening I wrote to the Insurance Commis-
sioners. A fortnight later I received their reply—a leaflet
giving minute directions about what to do when your
card is full, under a ten-pound penalty.
As is far too often the case with us;
It's all very, very difficult.

AIDS TO HUSBAND-KEEPING.
WE have so often been asked to give
a few simple culinary hints for inex-
perienced wives, that we have at last
consulted our Mr. Gordon Blew, who
has sent us the following, for which
we accept no responsibility:—
A dainty little chevaux de frise is an
appetising dish for a husband after a
hard day, and should win a pleasant
smile from him. Though possessing
a French name, its origin is probably
German. For it is in the Fatherland
that the sausage has reached its peri-
helion, and there it is held that a well-
cooked chevaux de frise is the last word
in gastronomics. The method of pre-
paring it—or rather, them—is really
quite simple, and need not deter a real
trier. The “little horses”—as they
used to be called at the Continental
casinos, where they were at one time
a standing dish—should be baked in
clay in the same way that gipsies pre-
pare hedgehogs for the table. When
the clay is quite hard, it should be
broken, and the spikes will be found to
have adhered to it. Serve hot with a
little melted butter.
M. Escoffier, in the intervals of
in Paris, has been writing what might
be termed a monolith on Cookery in
the Stone Age, and is said to have
come across some delightful recipes
among the archives in the library of
the Arsenal.
Were it not that the antediluvian is
too elusive nowadays to figure in the
menu on washing days, cótelettes de mé-
gathérium—according to M. EscoffiFR
—would be a capital Monday dish for
the young housewife to grapple with.
In the old days, when the monsters
were to be had without the asking, a
sun-scorched rock and a paper-bag
were all that were necessary, and one
might almost say that dear old “Meg"
did the rest. Also there were no com-
plaints, and the rude forefathers of the
hamlet—or “lads of the village,” as
they are now called — usually slept
soundly— oh! so soundly—after the
meal.
But cheer up, little wife, the crusta-
ceans are still with us, the steak pie,
the sausage roll and the apple dump-
ling. Edwin's teeth are young (perhaps
even unpaid for) and love will sharpen
them. So make pastry and fear not.
After all, what is this making of pastry?
A mere matter of flour, water and a
contain steak, sausage or apple, the
same kind of armour-plate, cold rolled,
does for the lot. Steak pie has to be
cooked in a dish—of course, you guessed
that—and a fancy edging of the paste
is usually moulded on round the to
of the dish, but if you should forget it
before insertion in the oven it can be
baked by itself and riveted on after-
wards.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
CLEARLY Mr. CHARLEs GLEIG must be numbered with the
iconoclasts. In my humble inexperience I had always
supposed that to woo and win a lady from the lighter
musical stage was an affair of some dash and gallantry, not
to say romance. Mr. GLEIG has changed all that, however,
with A Woman in the Limelight (METHUEN). With
laborious and detailed realism he has drawn a portrait of
the musical comedy actress that is about as unattractive a
thing as can well be imagined. Not only has he set himself
to strip the gilt off this gingerbread, but (if I may follow
the metaphor) to show us how it is made: the cheap butter,
dubious eggs, and pernicious colouring-matter that go to its:
composition. Naturally the result is not too exhilarating.
One can hardly dwell of intention upon the sordid for three
hundred pages and escape depression. Nor am I by any
The meeting between The Big Fish (METHUEN) and myself
should have been historic. Unfortunately, the Fish did
not rise to the occasion. I am hard to please now, for I
remember Mr. WATSON's other books – The Golden
Precipice; Hurricane Island; best of all, The Adventurers.
His latest story has not quite the same charm, though it
deals, as all good stories should, with buried treasure.
There was an island in The Golden Precipice; perhaps it
was the island that I missed. There was no love interest
in The Adventurers ; more likely it was the love interest
that I regretted. It is a legitimate grievance of women
that there is really no room for them in treasure-hunts; as
STEVENSON knew. Too often they are allowed in from
politeness only; the author's soul is not in the love
business. There is a heroine provided for The Big Fish,
and Mr. WATSON tries hard to pretend that she was there,
but one reader, at least he cannot persuade to believe in
her. I am all for Coop, the little Cockney villain. I
means certain that the example by which he sets out to take Coop to my heart, and sternly wave Mercédès Varley

The caddishness of Jessie
Anglehart, convincing enough

of his gradual disillusionment
are very skilfully told. The
Anglehart family and the

West Kensington is quite a
little triumph of depressing
realism. But I have also the
feeling that it is all hardly
worth while. The other two

To see how that same metre works
Upon the feelings of September.
For August—well, my temperate rhyme
Recoils from diction over-heated,
But, when I pass in close review
The Summers I have slithered through,
I trace a lot of loathly slime
But nothing, nothing, quite so fetid.
Myself, who feed on inward joys,
I am content, or else dissemble;
But what the tripper says about
This weary spell of waterspout-
What loose expletives he employs
I dare not think-it makes me tremble.
Regard him shivering by the main,
In scenes where he proposed to swelter ;
Think you he dips his clammy hide
Beneath the grey repellent tide
For joy? Not so; it is the rain
Drives him to this unnatural shelter.
Mark, too, the wheat (there may
be worse
Records than this; I've never known 'em)
Up to its ears in ooze and slush
And farmers faintly murmuring, "Hush !
August, thank Heaven, is in his hearse;
De mortuis nil nisi bonum !”
Hark, then, September; hear my prayer,
And, like the rosy-fingered plumber
Whose art retrieves in drain and pipe
The havoc due to Winter's gripe,
Come and with kindly touch repair
The hideous ruin wrought by Summer.
Much of your bounty have we heard.
You bring the partridge (little treasure);
Oh let him not be forced to cower
From tempests in his turnip bower,
But take the open like a bird
And share our simple manly pleasure.
Month of the mellowed fruits of earth,
I trust the gifts within your lap 'll
Surpass the others' poor supply--
Summer too wet and Spring too dry-
And Autumn, crowned with russet mirth,
BY THE SILVER SEA.

unable to locate the town, and so was obliged to return to
Folkestone without descending.

ANGELA'S ELOPEMENT.
I HAVE informed Angela, as the result
of the following experience, that I can
no longer be expected to sympathise,
as I have rashly done in the past, with
the vagaries of what she is pleased to
term her exceptional temperament. I
am doubly sorry to have been forced to
this decision, as I know what James,
who is a dear old friend of mine, will
have to suffer.
more fitted to undertake the entire
responsibility of Angela (his wife) than
I am. Temperament, according to her,
means that you must go to the F-
opera at least once a week or have
a nervous breakdown. James cer-
tainly fails to appreciate this view,
but emphatically denies the allega-
tion that he entertains a sneaking
regard for Picture Palaces.
It began with a telegram from
Angela asking me to call at Kens-
ington without delay. I was im-
mediately on my guard, and did
not turn up until nearly an hour
later, when I got rather a shock to
find that Angela was out and had
left a note for me in her room. I
first strolled into the smoking-room
on the off-chance of seeing James,
but he was not visible. There was,
I noticed, an unpleasant sense of
emptiness about the house which
tended to confirm my suspicions
that something nearly approaching
a domestic crisis had recently
taken place.
The letter was five pages in
length and the handwriting was
Angela at her worst. I gathered,
after much difficulty, that she had
left James forgood. There were sun-
dry vague references on every other
page to one Jack Barton, whose
name I remembered in connection
with Angela in the palmy days
before her marriage with James.
He, poor fellow, is no

“I'm speaking from Charing Cross.
Why didn't you come before?" That
started an argument which I was in a
fair way to win, but she stopped me
abruptly. -
“Listen!” she said. “I want you
to do something for me at once; it's
very important.”
I assured her that I was at her
service. There was a pause.

Only two-pennyworth more. I began
wondering what sort of a figure I should
cut in the Divorce Court and sub-
sequently in the halfpenny illustrated
papers. Also my heart ached badly for
James.
“We must be quick,” gasped Angela
feverishly as we started on the last lap.
“All right. I'm ready."
“Listen; the card is in the escri-
toire, to your right—in the secret
drawer.”
“Which is the secret drawer ?”
“I can't remember well enough
to describe it. I know you have
to press something.”
lifted the telephone bodily,
crossed over to the escritoiré and
fumbled wildly about for some-
thing to press.
“Are you there?" she shrieked.
“Yes—hulloa.”
“No; I mean are you by the
escritoire ?”
“Oh—yes.”
“Well, do make haste and find
the drawer.”
“I am making haste,” I said;
“I’ll be with you directly. Mind
you wait for me.” -
I never was my best at tricks,
and I went on searching quite fruit-
lessly. Meanwhile Angela kept
plying me with useless and inco-
herent directions. I could hear
her jumping up and down on the
spring-board of the telephone-box.
In desperation I seized hold of the
escritoire and shook it violently.
I also struck it several resounding
blows with my clenched fist. But
the secret drawer remained a closed
mystery.
Suddenly Angela's voice came
Details followed to the effect that she
had written twenty pages of explanation
to James and pinned the envelope to his
pillow-case, and that my part in the
business was to await James's return,
to be by him when he read the letter,
to soothe him in his agony, and, above
all, to be sure to see that he attempted
nothing desperate. I strolled out on
the landing, cautiously opened James's
bedroom door and switched on the
electric light. There on the pillow-case
lay a fat pink envelope with “James"
inscribed upon it in bold º

“You see,” she finished up, after a
long spell, “Jack only returned from

Lohengrin together and . . .”
What followed was somewhat scrappy
and not very audible. There was a deal
about Lohengrin and the higher life.
It was also clear that Angela had been

THE HEIR.
W.—HE SEES LIFE.
THERE was no one in sight. If 'twere
done well, 'twere well done quickly. I
gripped the perambulator, took a last
look round, and then suddenly rushed
it across the drive and down a side
path, not stopping until we were well
concealed from the house. Panting, I
dropped into a seat, having knocked
several seconds off the quarter-mile
record for babies under one.
“Hallo!” said Myra.
“Dash it, are there people every-
where to-day? I can't get a moment
to myself. “O solitude, where—' "
“What are you going to do with
Baby?"
“Peter and I are going for a walk.”
My eyes rested on her for more than a
moment. She was looking at me over
an armful of flowers . . . and—well—
“You can come too if you like,” I said.
“I’ve got an awful lot to do,” she
smiled doubtfully. -
“Oh, if you'd rather count the
washing.” -
She sat down next to me.
“Where 's Dahlia 2"
“I don't know. We meant to have
left a note for her, but we came away
in rather a hurry. ‘Back at twelve.
Peter.”
“‘I am quite happy. Pursuit is use-
less,’” suggested Myra. “Poor Dahlia,
she'll be frightened when she sees the
perambulator gone.”
“My dear, what could happen to it?
Is this Russia. ?"
“Oh, what happens to perambulators
in Russia?” asked Myra eagerly.
“They spell them differently,” I
said, after a little thought. “Anyhow
Dahlia's all right.”
“Well, I'll just take these flowers in
and then I'll come back. If you and
Peter will have me?”
“I think so,” I said.
Myra went in and left me to my
reflections, which were mainly that
Peter had the prettiest aunt in England,
and that the world was very good. But
my pleased and fatuous smile over these
thoughts was disturbed by her an-
nouncement on her return.
“Dahlia says,” she began, “that we
may have Peter for an hour, but he
must come in at once if he cries.”
I got up in disgust.
“You've spoilt my morning,” I said.
“Oh, mo " "
“I had a little secret from Dahlia,
or rather Peter and I had a little secret
together; at least, you and I and Peter
had a secret. Anyhow it was a secret.
And I was feeling very wicked and
happy—Peter and I both were; and
too. And now Dahlia knows all about
the desperate deed we were planning,
and, to make it worse, all she says is,
• Certainly By all means ! Only don't
get his feet wet. Peter,” I said, as I
bent over the sleeping innocent, “we
are betrayed.”
“Miss Mannering will now relate her
experiences,” said Myra. “I went into
the hall to put down the flowers, and
just as I was coming out I saw Dahlia
in the corner with a book. And she
said, ‘Tell your young man p > y
“How vulgar !” I interrupted.
“To be careful with my baby.' And
I said in great surprise, ‘What baby?'
And she said, ‘He was very kindly
running him up and down the drive
just now. Peter loves it, but don't let
them go on too long or there may be
an accident.’ And then she gave a few
more instructions, and—here we are.”
“Peter,” I said to the somnolent
one, “you can't deceive a woman. Also
men are pigs. Wake up and we will
apologise to your aunt for doubting
her. Sorry, Myra.”
Myra pinned a flower in my coat and
forgave me, and we walked off together
with the perambulator.
“Peter is seeing a bit of life this
morning,” I said. “What shall we
show him now 2"
“Thomas and Samuel are playing
golf,” said Myra casually.
I looked at her doubtfully.
“Is that quite suitable?”
“I think if we didn't let him stay too
long it would be all right. Dahlia
wouldn't like him to be over-excited."
“Well, he can't be introduced to the
game too early. Come on, Peter.” And
we pushed into more open country.
The 9-hole course which Simpson
planned a year ago is not yet used
for the Open Championship, though it
is certainly better than it was last
summer. But it is short and narrow
and dog-legged, and, particularly when
Simpson is playing on it, dangerous.
“We are now in the zone of fire,” I
said. “Samuel's repainted ninepenny
may whizz past us at any moment.
Perhaps I had better go first.” I tied
my handkerchief to Myra's sunshade
and led the way with the white flag.
A ball came over the barn and rolled
towards us, just reaching one of the
wheels. I gave a yell.
“Hallo!” bellowed Simpson from
behind the barn.
“You're firing on the ambulance,” I
shouted.
He hurried up, followed leisurely by
Thomas.
“I say,” he said excitedly, “have I
hurt him ?”
“You have not even waked him.
WELLINGTON or NAPOLEoN ?—that of
being able to sleep through the heaviest
battle.”
“Hallo,” said Thomas. “Good old
boy | What's he been learning to-
day?” he added with godfatherly
interest.
“We're showing him life to-day.
He has come to see Simpson play golf.”
“Doesn't he ever sit up?” asked
Simpson, looking at him with interest.
“I don't see how he's going to see
anything if he's always on his back.
Unless it were something in the air.”
“Don’t you ever get the ball in the
air?” said Myra innocently.
“What will his uncle Samuel show
him if he does sit up?” I asked. “Let's
decide first if it's going to be anything
worth watching. Which hole are you
for 2 The third 2 ''
“The eighth, My last shot had a
bit of a slice.”
“A slice It had about the whole
joint. I doubt,” I said to Myra, “if
we shall do much good here; let's
push on.” -
But Myra had put down the hood
and taken some of the clothes off Peter.
Peter stirred slightly. He seemed to
know that something was going on.
Then suddenly he woke up, just in
time to see Simpson miss the ball com-
pletely. Instantly he gave a cry.
“Now you've done it,” said Myra.
“He’s got to go in. And I'm afraid he'll
go away with quite a wrong idea of
the game.”
But I was not thinking of the baby.
Although I am to be his uncle by
marriage I had forgotten him.
“If that's about Simpson's form
to-day,” I said to Myra, “you and I
could still take them on and beat them.”
Myra looked up eagerly.
“What about Peter ?” she asked ;
but she didn't ask it very firmly.
“We promised Dahlia to take him
in directly he cried,” I said. “She'd
be very upset if she thought she
couldn't trust us. And we’ve got to
go in for our clubs anyway,” I added.
Peter was sleeping peacefully again,
but a promise is a promise. After all,
we had done a good deal for his educa-
tion that morning. We had shown
him human nature at work, and the
position of golf in the universe.
“We'll meet you on the first tee,”
said Myra to Thomas. A. A. M.

enterprise was graced by the presence
of the Church, and before we knew
where we were (even before Miss
Chapman knew where she was) we
were all in the big room, sitting on
rows of chairs and facing a platform.
“My dear friends,” said the Vicar
from this eminence, “it is with very
genuine feelings of gratitude that I see
so many of you gathered here to-night.
There are those missing, I am sorry to
say, whom I had invited to be present,
but on the other hand there are many
gathered here to-night to whom no
direct invitation was addressed. That,
I think, shews that our mission has a
greater popularity and fame than we
dared to suspect, and cannot, I feel,
help but affect the amount of the
collection (silver) to which all those
gathered here to-night will be asked,
and, I am sure, gladly persuaded, to
contribute. Before I make way for my
reverend brother from the Fiji Isles,
I should like to announce that, at
the termination of his address, all
present are asked to partake of a light
supper, provided at the last moment (I
am vaguely informed) by an anonymous
donor, of whose identity some of us
And as he sat down he looked with

Besides the collection there was a
hymn or two, and it took us two hours
to get to supper time; even then
few of us got enough, our personal
contributions being shared with the
outsiders who hadn't brought a particle
of food with them.
For which reasons Miss Chapman
has, very properly, been deposed from
her leadership, and the rest of us have
determined to devote our energies to
that safer but less original pastime,

Although he speaks quietly, even hesitatingly,
in the E glish language, he lises to heights of
thrilling eloquence in his lative tongue. . . . .
During the recent campaign c'ectors frequently
walked five or six miles in the rain to hear him.
. . . To some enthusiasts he is “The Wizard
of Wales' and “The Poet cf the People." A
brother Noirconformist minister, the Rev.
Rhys J. Huws, said of him : ‘The advent to
l'arliament of a man of the character and coi:-
victions of Mr. Towyn Jones cannot but send
a thrill of health through so materialistic an
institution.” There is little real comparison
between the new Member and minister M.P.'s

While the House of feudal rotters

This wild incarnate blizzard,

HOW TO BECOME A J00RNALIST.
THE gifted CLEAR (CIAUDIUs) of The
British Weekly, discussing this matter,
comes to various conclusions. We
take the liberty of extending his en-
tertaining lucubrations.
Journalism . is every day a more
difficult profession to adorn; and every
day more journalists attempt to adorn
it. Now and then one drops out, as
when Lord SALISBURY took to states-
manship ; but for the most part once a
journalist always a journalist.
In order to see how to become a
journalist let us first ask: What is the
best education for a journalist? The
reply to this question depends upon the
kind of journalism that you propose
to follow. A leader-writer on The
Poultry Watchdog, for example, requires
a different training from the chief
reporter on Auto Sparklets. The old
idea that there was no training to
compare with Balliol is now exploded.
The Jowler, it is true, bred a few hefty
pens, but the tradition no longer holds.
you wish to write with acceptance, if
not authority, for the readers of The
Poultry Watchdog you must have had
a period at the Dorking High School,
followed by two terms at least at the
A religious pape again requires a
different training from a sporting paper.
A religious journalist, to be complete,
must know not only all about religion,
but he must be acquainted with the
new books and the forthcoming books;
he must know what this feuilletonist
gets “per thou.,” and where that short-
story-writer is spending his holiday,
and why Cardinal NEwMAN did not
marry CHARLoTTE BRONTÉ. A sporting
journalist, on the other hand, needs less
preparation. All that he requires is a
hat in which to place the names of
to-morrow's race-horses before picking
out the one which he recommends his
readers to back. It is thus easier to be
a sporting than a religious journalist.
But, curiously enough, a cricket
journalist needs more of an equipment.
He ought to know the Christian names
of the professionals and the pet names
of the amateurs; he ought to have
a profound contempt for the English
captain, increasing with every victory.
scored by the English team, together
| with very decided views as to why the
Test Selection Committee ought to in-
clude eleven totally different men from
those chosen, with reasons for his belief.
This wants some doing, but he must
be able to do it if he is to succeed in
his high calling.
The second question is, How is the
profession of journalism best entered ?
Here the answer is simple. By way of
the Temple. Pretend to be a barrister
and journalism is at your feet. Another ||
way, but less certain, is to send admir-
able articles to editors and get them
accepted. But choose the editor with
skill. You will not, for example, send
a pink joke to The Church Times, or a
panegyric on the Insurance Act to The
Saturday Review, or an appreciation of
WINSTON to The Morning Post. Nor
(for a very different reason) will you
offer a “Thing that matters” to The
Pall Mall Gazette, or a “Literary
Letter,” no matter how good, to The
Sphere, or a joke from a back number
of Punch to The Tatler.
Thirdly: What are the prospects of
the journalist in the present day?
Well, if he is on The Daily Mail and,
is over twenty-five and cannot write
about the need for compulsory golf, his
prospects are rotten. But, if he is on
The Daily Telegraph and can supply
information about Sir HERBERT TREE's
forthcoming productions, he ought to
be sure of his post for ever and ever.
So now you know.
“One can imagine an old public-schoolboy
going down to his school, and visiting the playing-
fields where he bathed.”—The Daily Telegraph.
So these floods are nothing very new,

Their lives on thine, most beautiful, most calm,
Melodious songster | List, how, while we swaddle
Our limbs in mackintoshes, thy clear psalm
Rises untroubled. Lo! how thou dost waddle
About in filthy pools and find them balm,
Insatiate of beastliness and muck,
Blithe spirit of our summer, hail, O duck!
There is no gleam of comfort in the heavens,
Now, while we sit with suppliant hands and groan,
Pavilion-bound the impotent elevens,
The farmer cursing at the tempest's moan,
But thou, O duck, O duck of Mrs. Evans,
For ever singest in mellifluous tone,
The deluge pouring from thy rain-proof back,
Loud orisons of praise. Thou goest, “Quack,”
And once more, “Quack,” well knowing to recover
The first fine careless sound, egregious brute,
Out in the orchard yonder, where some lover
Maybe has wandered with goloshless boot
In other years, and plucked from boughs above her
(Matching his lady's cheek) the ripened fruit:
But now in vain they vaunt their crimson front,
One cannot pick them, not without a punt.
Ah, yes, thou singest on, thy voice assuages
(Or ought to) human plaints about the corn,
Perhaps the self-same voice that in past ages
Cheered the sick heart of HAM some early morn,
As he leaned out and cried, “The flood still rages,
The Ark is tossing in a sea forlorn,
But some live thing is happy; don't condemn
But I, when I observe no sunshine dapple
The leaden pall above, the rayless gloom,
And hear thee singing 'neath the pendant apple,
Although I praise thee, duck, I also fume,
I ask for vengeance, for the gods who grapple
With too much fortune, for the hand of doom;
I like to think that thou must end thy joys,
And stop that silly sort of rootling noise.
I lift my nose to catch the waſted savour
Of incense stealing from the onion-bed,
The perfume of the sage-leaf. O thou laver
In filthiness and slush, I want thee dead—
No more to gloat upon our grief, nor favour
The air with that wild music, but instead
With vermeil fruit, like those on yonder trees,
Garnished in dissolution. Also peas. Dvor.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE INTERRUPTIONS.
I AM not prepared to guarantee the accuracy of any
single one of the nautical terms used in the following
report of an interview which I was privileged to have
with a sailor-man. All I say is that I have done my best
to keep close to the original, and to create a briny
sea-going impression in the minds of my readers. Nine
hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand of them
won't know the difference. The thousandth will growl and
put me down as a landlubber, which, as a matter of fact,
I am. His pardon I beg at once, and ask him to consider
the necessities of a working journalist and not to bear too
hardly on my faults. -
This happened in August. The usual shower of rain
was pouring down, and, being on the sea-shore, I had taken
refuge in a sort of shed, a tumble-down wooden affair, the
approach to which was littered with nets, lobster-pots,
oars and spars. In the shed was a man in a dark blue
guernsey, a thick pair of blue trousers, no boots and a blue
cap. He was doing something to a net with a knife, a
piece of wood and a length of string, and he greeted me as
I entered :—
“Step aboard, messmate,” he said.
I murmured something about the beastly weather and
the disgusting month.
“Lor' love you,” he answered, “I’ve seen many a worse
Augusty month nor this. This is a cloud o' dust to some
I've been through. Wet 2 I believe you. Why, ten year
ago—no, it warn't ten; it were eleven. I remember it by
our youngest bein’ born the follerin' month. We was beatin'
round Cape Horn as it might be to-day, spare sails all set
and the main-top-gallant braced to the lee scuppers for to
catch the trade winds. The old Susan Mary was doin'
her fourteen knots comfortable, and if it hadn't been for
the cook's black cat goin' for a voyage by hisself through
clawin' up the mainmast and gettin' tossed orf of it when
we got the Gulf Stream abeam we should all have bin as
happy as a nest of cherubs with the mother-cherub settin'
on 'em to keep 'em warm. But you know, Sir, what
sailor-men thinks of a cat, and this was a very peculiar
sort with his chest and his belly all laid out in white stripes,
which is a sign of riches to them as don't mind bein’
scratched by 'im. But we couldn't spend much time
sorrowin' after poor old Sultan, for the wind was blowin'
half a gale from the Sou’-West, and the rain was comin'
down just as if all the sky taps had got loose. It was five
bells, and I was look-out-man in the bows. Sudden the rain
lifted like and there ahead of us, a point or two on the
starboard bow ' Here he stopped suddenly, for two
of the big guns in the Cliff fort had been fired. When we
recovered from the effect of the double explosion he con-
tinued :—
“Them two guns reminds me of the waterspout we met
once in the China Seas. I was a deck hand on the
Bride of the Ocean, and we'd picked up a pretty cargo of
silks and spices and ’eathen gods, the ugly fat sort, more 'n
half naked, with red eyes and 'orns to their 'eads and all
full o' mischief. 'Owever that didn't worry us, 'cos we'd
got 'em all packed tight in boxes, fifty or so to a box, and
stowed away under hatches with the rats to play round 'em
and take orf their curses when they was in the mind to let
'em out. We'd got to think o' the ship, and the weather
had kept us pretty close to our work hauling on the tackles
and gettin' the foreyards snug. There was a long thin
man out o' Plymouth town in my watch, a lantern-jawed
fellow with a turn for good talk; “Preachin' Moses’ we
called 'im, 'is name bein’ Solomon. 'Im and me was
swain come along. “Now, look 'ere,' says the boatswain
—'e was chewin' a quid o' terbacker, and we could see by
the colour of 'is nose that something 'ad run acrorst 'is
bows and spoilt ’is temper, so we made to sheer orf and
give 'im a wide berth—‘look 'ere,' 'e says ” But what

MEssRs. METHUEN could not have chosen a better
moment for the publication of Mrs. PERRIN's latest novel.
At a time when even the seasoned Londoner is beginning to
notice that the weather is a little depressing it is impossi-
ble not to sympathise with the Fleetwoods, dumped into
England after a lifetime in shiny India. The main thread
of The Anglo-Indians has to do with the love-story of Fay
Fleetwood and Clive Somerton, but it is the vividness with
which the author sets forth the tragedy of “the guillotine
of completed service” which makes the book so absorbing.
They are a race apart, these Anglo-Indians who have come
home on a pension. The climate does not suit them (it
killed Mr. Fleetwood), they miss their friends, their work,
their servants—everything that has made life worth living;
they are at a loose end, with the added disadvantage of
being short of money. To quote one of the characters in
the story, they “subside into a suburb" and “have a
loathsome time.” Woven into the fortunes of the Fleetwood
family are those of a delightful young native prince; and
here again the pathos of the contrast between East and
West is made plain. You may anglicize your Rajah if you
catch him young, but not his women-folk. Mrs. PERRIN
has done nothing better than the passages dealing with the
domestic affairs of the Rajah of Rotah, drifting every day
further out of sympathy with his half-imbecile child-wife.
I admire particularly the skill with which she renders clear
the points of view of her various characters, and still more

making me feel ashamed of that extraordinary ignorance
which I share with so many of our legislators who interest
themselves in Indian affairs.
I am afraid that if Miss MAISIE BENNETT were a motorist
instead of an author she would be heavily fined for exceed-
ing the statutory speed limit. For the chief thing that
strikes me about her Golden Vanity (MILLS AND Boon) is
that she is a young woman in a most uncommon hurry.
In one chapter her red-haired heroine, aged about fifteen
and brought up in an orphanage, is earning four shillings a
week as a useful help in a Balham household. In the next,
after two years' interval, at the beginning of which, in spite
of her total ignorance of the stage, she secures an engage-
ment in a travelling provincial company, she has blossomed
into the principal girl in the chief London pantomime, and
by the following season has become the musical-comedy
idol of the town, with her red head on all the hoardings, an
extravagantly furnished flat, a motor-car and a well-filled
jewel-case and, what is still more surprising, a cultivated
literary taste and a genius for painting. Comparatively
speaking, the playmate of her youth who wins her love on
the last page is a bit of a slow-coach, though even he
managed to write the novel of the year in the course of a

of those amiable books for which there is evidently a
large class of readers and which disarm serious criticism
by their unpretentiousness and general wholesomeness.
Olivia Mary, a beautiful, timid soul, has married rich
Squire Anthony Cheston, now dead. Their reputed son,
John, devoted to his mother in a masterful sort of way,
is really the illegitimate fruit of an earlier excusable
adventure which Cheston had discerningly and generously
condoned by adopting John. The widowed mother lives
under the shadow of the possible discovery of her secret.
The blow falls on the eve of John's marriage. John pities
himself, reproaches, storms, turns against his mother,
behaves in fact as badly as possible. But the girl, Isabel
Matheson, and her father take more kindly and reasonable
views, and the marriage proceeds, as we dare to prophesy, to
the lifelong regret of Isabel. Loosely interwoven, too loosely,
Quain makes a feeble resistance against this capture of
himself, but he never gets anywhere near to calling his
soul his own. After reading Mightier than the Sword I
am convinced that, when a journalist does marry, his wife
must be more in need of sympathy than even a golfer's.
“Man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself
in vain.” That seems to me to express the general ten-
dency of Mr. RICHARD CURLE's Shadows out of the Crowd
(Swift) better than any of the quotations from Dostol-
Evsky, TURGENEv, IBs EN, Tolstoy, and other psychological
writers which preface his book and each of its twelve short
stories. For nearly all of them end in nothingness. Four
are accounts of morbid suicides, one of a sudden death |
by fire (oddly contrasted with a supper at the Cecil or
the Savoy), and two others drift off directly they begin
to tell truth, is another thread
of narrative which introduces
some fairly drawn minor char-
acters and less than minor in-
cidents. Helen Ambrose, the
American wife of a shadowy
literary man, is carefully done.
If Olivia Mary, who was
meant for a nice thing, had
kept a stiffer back, had aban-
doned the habit of gazing into
the fire or into the eyes of
tired she was; if she had yearned
less and had schooled herself to
outh, she would have escaped
eing something of a bore. As
wished the author or any one
of her characters had shown
an adequate (Sir John has a
faint) sense of the iniquity of
that preposterous prig. How
such monstrous egotism and
uncharity (surely much more
flagrantly immoral than any
conduct of Olivia Mary's) could
be capable of attracting the
devotion of Isabel, the approval
of that decent old boy, Sir John,
or the tolerance of John's brother
officers, is never explained.

they suggest an irritating sense
of power, irritating because I
feel that Mr. CURLE is wasting
his abilities in his pursuit of
vagueness. The entertainment
known as a shadow-show is
good in its way, provided that
it is comic, though even then the
grotesquely distorted shadows

Humphrey Quain joined the staff of The Day when he
was a mere boy, and at once fell under the influence of
Ferrol (not a stimulating tonic, with iron in it, as you
might think, but the man who directed the paper). Ferrol,
a strange mixture of humanity and brutality, is drawn
with an almost uncanny skill. He is just human enough
to make me wish that he had more heart and less brains.
Taking an especial interest in Quain he literally assumes
possession of the boy, and crushes in him all aspirations
except the one desire to become a brilliant journalist. To
emphasize his point Mr. Court,ANDER in turn makes Quain

“IT's sad to think that to-morrow
we shall b2 in London,” said Simpson
with a sigh.
“Rotten,” agreed Thomas, and took
another peach.
There was a moment's silence.
“We shall miss you,” I said, after
careful thought. I waited in vain for
Dahlia to say something and then added,
“You must both come again next year.”
“Thank you very much.”
“Not at all. I hate these awkward
pauses. If my host or hostess doesn't
do anything to smooth them over, I
always dash in. It's been delightſul
to have you,” I went on. “Are you
sure you can't stay till Wednesday?"
“I’m so sorry,” said Dahlia, “but
you took me by surprise. I had simply
no idea. Are you really going?”
“I'm afraid so.” -
“Are you really staying?” said
Archie to me.” Help!”
“What about Peter?" asked Myra.
“Isn't he too young to be taken from
his godfathers?” -
“We’ve been talking that over,”
said Simpson, “and I think it will be
all right. Wé've mapped his future
out very carefully and we shall unfold
it to you when the coffee comes.” .

“Sailor, indeed,” said Dahlia. “He’s
going to be a soldier." . . . . . .
“It's too late. Thomas has begun
another one. Well, he'll have to
swallow the stone." - -
| “A trifle hard on the Admiralty,”
said Archie. “It loses both Thomas
and Péter at one gulp. My country,
| what of thee?” -
However, when Thomas had peeled
the peach, I cleverly solved the diffi-
| culty by taking it on to my plate while
| he was looking round for the sugar.
“No, no sugar, thanks,” I said, and
waved it away. -
With the coffee and cigars Simpson
unfolded his scheme of education for
Peter.
“In the first place,” he said, “it is
important that even as a child he
should always be addressed in rational
English and not in that ridiculous baby-
talk so common with young mothers.”
“Oh dear,” said Dahlia.
“My good Samuel,” I broke in,
“this comes well from you. Why,
only yesterday I heard you talking to
him. I think you called him his nun-
key's ickle petsy wetsy lambkin.”
“You misunderstood me,” said Simp-

“Oh ' " I said, rather taken aback.
“Well—well, I'm not.” I lit a cigar.
“And I shall be annoyed if you call me
so again.”
“At the age of four,” Simpson went
on, “he shall receive his first lesson in
cricket. Thomas will bowl to him—"
“I suppose that means that Thomas
will have to be asked down here again,”
said Archie. “Bother. Still, it's not
for four years.”. . .
“Thomas will bowl to him, Archie
will keep wicket, and I shall field.”
“And where do I come in 2 " I asked.
“You come in after Peter. Unless
you would rather have your lesson
first.” - -
“That's the second time I've been
sat on,” I said to Myra. “Why is
Simpson so unkind to me to-night?”
“I suppose he's jealous because
you're staying on another week.”
“Probably; still I don't like it.
Could you turn your back on him, do
you think, to indicate our heavy dis-
pleasure?" -
Myra moved her chair round and
rested her elbow on the table.
“Go on, Samuel,” said Dahlia.
“You're lovely to-night. I suppose
these are Thomas's ideas as well as

“His signature is duly appended to

“I didn't read 'em all,” said Thomas.
“That's very rash of you,” said
Archie. “You don't know what you
mightn't let yourself in foſſ. You may
have promised to pay the child three-
pence a week pocket-monéy.” -
“No, there's nothing like that,"
said Simpson, to Archie's evident dis-
appointment. “Well, then, at the
age of ten he goes to a preparatory
school." 3. * * * * *... . . .
“Has he learnt to read yet?" asked
Dahlia, “I didn't hear anything about

“He can read at six. I forgot to say.
that I am giving him a book which I
shall expect him to read aloud to
Thomas and me on his sixth birthday.”
“Thomas has got another invitation,”
said Archie. “Dash it.”
“At fourteen he goes to a public
school. The final decision as to which
public school he goes to will be left to
you, but, of course, we shall expect to
be consulted on the subject.”
“I’ll write and tell you what we
decide on,” said Archie hastily; “there'll
be no need for you to come down and
be told aloud.”
“So far we have not arranged any-
thing for him beyond the age of
fourteen. I now propose to read out
a few general rules about his upbring-
ing which we must insist on being
“The great question whether Simp-
son is kicked out of the house to-night,
or leaves unobtrusively by the milk

settled,” I murmured.
“RULE ONE.-‘He must be brought
up to be ambidexterous.' It will be very
useful,” explained Simpson, “when he

“Or when he wants to shake hands
with two people at once,” said Archie.
“RULE Two.—" He must be taught
from the first to speak French and
German fluently.' He'll thank you for

“Or when he goes to the National
Liberal Club,” said Archie.
“RULE THREE.—‘He should be sur-
rounded as far as possible with beautiful

paper, beautiful scenery * >
“Beautiful godfathers?” I asked
doubtfully.
Simpson ignored me and went on
hurriedly with the rest of his rules.
“Well,” said Archie, at the end of
them, “they're all fairly futile, but if
you like to write them out neatly and
frame them in gold I don't mind
hanging them up in the bath-room.

TWO OF A KIND.
“OH ! Look, MoTHEIt –“SNAP' ”
ODE TO AN ANCIENT HAT.
A HAT 2 . . . Ah, there you are, my faithful fellow !
My dissolute, disconsolate old felt
Fallen into the sere, the almost yellow,
Whose leaf was once a wondrous green to melt
My eyes that saw you hanging at the hatter's,
Soiled not of sun that rusts nor storm that batters,
But boasting such a tint as vernal trees,
As jade, as emeralds, as soup, as seas
Never attempt:-the perfect Tyrolese.
I bought you. You remember how we swaggered
With envious zephyrs waſting us ahead,
And met some men, and they went wan and haggard,
Fleeing before the radiance you shed 2
Him who disliked your tint I told to lump it;
You blessed the bardic brow, caressed his crumpet
(Size 6%); you were my chief
Adornment, and I felt I would as lief
As fifty fancy vests hold you in fief.
You know, there was a girl I might have married
Last year at Southsea—oh, she told me so;
Yet to our mutual grief the thing miscarried.
I introduced her to you once, you know
(You were not present at our fonder meetings);
And that sufficed. For all my fervent bleatings
She bade me settle which did I prefer—
Her or my hat ? Well, loving though we were,
Your tint was talismanic, almost mystic;
I grieved to watch it slowly going off.
My love was not completely altruistic;
You used to help me splendidly at golf.
Together we have set stout scratch men swearing,
Made even Irishmen blaspheme the wearing
Of (after divers attributes) the green,
Blinking at foozled puts. It might have been
The turf. . . but no 'twas you they used to mean
That was long since. The suns of Time have slain you,
Have booked you for the man of rag and bone.
Sadly the Fates had fashioned you, for they knew
How surely you would wilt—yes, they alone;
While I—I somehow dreamed you could not perish.
Now there you hang, the hat I used to cherish;
Nor would I care to venture out in you
Nowadays. You have seen your seasons through. . . .
Yes, Thomas, certainly.—Will this one do?
Mr. H. H. HILTON on his grip:—
“I do not touch the left hand with the fingers of the right hand,
but on the other hand my fingers do in a sense overlap.”
However many hands has Mr. HILTON got?
“Owing to the floods, consequent upon the recent rains, the
Sleights Water Carnival, which was to have been held on Tuesday
night, was indefinitely postponed.”—Malton Gazette.

I really couldn't throw you up for her.
Well, well, we did think that this would be all right.

By our on LY CLEMENT.
I welcome as an instalment of the
official recognition due to men of letters
the decision of the Government to name
a number of new ships of war after
characters in the plays of SHAKSPERE
and the novels of Scott. But the in-
adequacy of the treatment is deplorable.
Why, to begin with, should living
authors be excluded from the scheme,
and why should the honour be con-
ferred on representatives of England
and Scotland alone? I readily admit

him: I make a point of this)—was a
leading and brainy dramatist and Scott
a considerable romancer. But it is
unfortunate, to say the least of it, that
this mode of commemorating their
talent should be contrived to aggravate
the discontent of Wales and Ireland at
the present juncture. I am not a
Welshman or an Irishman myself, but
some of my dearest friends are and
their nationality as keenly as if I had
been born in Tipperary or Criccieth.

to have a battleship named after him it
was GEORGE MEREDITH, a photograph

that Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, whose
ignorance of Burford Bridge and Box
Hill is abysmal, had never heard of
him or it. -

whose immortal poem Omar Khayyám,
every edition of which is on my shelves,
would make a splendid name for a

The cause of Feminism, of which I
am a convinced adherent, would be
enormously assisted by the bestowal of
her name or that of Jane Eyre on a

of course, the Greek for thunder;
what could be more appropriate for an
ironclad equipped with 13 in. guns

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. (SEPTEMBER 11, 1912.
“SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE –?"
I supposi: I had not seen my old
preparatory school for a matter of five-
and-twenty years. As I reflected on
the interval that morning in the train,
it had seemed centuries. Now that I
was actually there it seemed more like
three weeks. How well I recalled a
little series of exactly such functions
as this sports prize-giving! Nothing
was changed; even the proverbial
shrinkage for which I had been pre-
pared was hardly noticeable, perhaps
because my own inches have never
developed to any imposing extent.
There were exactly the same pink and
cherubic competitors, in the same state
of excited shyness; the head master
did not seem to have altered by so
much as a single hair out of the half-
dozen that I remembered; the visitors
were precisely the stodgy-looking and
spectacled crowd, at whom I had
myself mocked secretly a score of times.
It was at this point that I observed
one of the latter regarding me curi-
ously across the space of lawn that
separated us. Adjusting my glasses,
I stared back at him; and as I did so
there grew up gradually a vague
consciousness of familiarity. Some-
where certainly I had seen that hawk-
like nose and the prehensile mouth now
shaded by a drooping sand-coloured
moustache. It was evident that the
man shared my feeling. Working his
way round the throng, he was presently
at my side.
“Another of the old gang,” he cried
heartily, in a voice that was just as
elusively reminiscent as his face; “I
declare this makes me quite young
again!”
As however it produced no obvious
change in his appearance (though I
watched closely) I was obliged to be
content with grasping his proffered hand
and hoping for future enlightenment.
“Queer coincidence,” he went on,
“but I assure you 1 was thinking of
you only the other day. Wonder
what's become of old Partington, I
said to myself, before ever I knew I
was coming down here. And here you
are Place looks just the same, doesn't
it 2 ”
“Just,” I agreed. (Who on earth was
the fellow 2).
“Bless me, yes! Meeting you like
this, I wouldn't be surprised to see any
of them come up for their prizes.

ran a dead-heat in the quarter * >
“With Crab Thompson' " I cried
suddenly. “Of course!” This was
better; I felt that I was placing him
and that identification could not be
“What times those were ! And there's
the old Head jawing still the same old
gags about it not being only those that
win the races that score by 'em ; you
know !” he chuckled. “Remember
Johnnie Lyons?” he asked suddenly.
“He was always about with us. A
judge now, they tell me, in East Africa.
Must have quieted down a bit since
our time, eh?”
I laughed pleasantly. “Then there
was Bruiser Deighton,” I said; “what's
happened to him 2"
“I dunno,” answered the stranger,
with less interest; “and to tell you the
truth, Partington, I don't very much
care. He was a stuck-up little prig a
the best.” -
“Oh, but surely not,” I protested,
moved by some impulse to the defence of
the only contemporary whom I remem-
bered well. “Anyhow, he has one
good deed to his credit. You can't have
forgotten the licking that he gave that
confounded bully Ottershaw!"
The moment I had spoken I saw the
truth. My companion had stiffened
visibly. “My dear Partington,” he
cried, though even then more in sorrow
than in anger, “surely from you of all
people I need not have expected this!
To forget your old chum. I am
Ottershaw ”
It was a nasty moment; fortunately,
however, fate had provided me with a
repartee.
“After all,” I said hastily, “you
can't wonder at it. I'm not Parting-

A PUBLISHER AMONG THE
OYSTERS.
IT is scarcely necessary to say that
the following letter, recently printed
in The Daily Sketch, has created the
liveliest excitement in publishing
circles:—
“Sir, –Will you permit me to correct a state-
ment made the other day as to the record for
oyster eating
The record was created some years ago by
the late Charles H. Clarke, publisher, of Pater-
noster Row, who, after consuming his usual
steak at Prosser's, then in Fleet Street, backed
himself for a sovereign to eat twelve dozen
oysters in twelve minutes, and won his bet
with a minute to spare. I may add that he
offered to back himself for a ‘fiver’ to eat six
dozen more, but there were no takers.
PAUL HERMYNG.”
Publishers of whatever complexion
cannot but feel a deep interest, one
way or the other, in the circumstance
that such a record is held by a member
of their profession. In order both to
ascertain their feelings in the matter
and also to elicit, if possible, particulars
of other feats of skill, strength or en-
durance, Mr. Punch has been making
results which he hopes will be found
at once valuable and entertaining.
Mr. John MURRAY, interviewed in his
austere parlour in historic Albemarle
Street, was deeply moved by the story
of his late colleague's capacity. “It
is not what we are famous for, it is
not what we are famous for,” he
murmured brokenly more than once.
“That is what pleases and touches me.
The great public think of us as thin-
blooded mercenary men of business
with small appetites — nothing else:
a false idea fostered not a little by the
intuitive hostility of authors. But here
is a charming proof that it is not true.
Here is a publisher so far approximating
to the heroic standard that he can per-
form this Gargantuan task and risk
good red gold on his prowess. It does
my heart good, it does indeed.”
Asked if he had any gastronomical
triumphs of his own to record, Mr.
MURRAY sighed wistfully. No, he had
not. He once had two helpings of the
Cheshire Cheese pudding, but that was
an accident. He had thought that the
second was fruit tart. No, he had
nothing to pit against Mr. CLARKE.
Mr. John LANE was envious. “A
few years ago, yes,” he said, “I might
have taken up CLARKE's bet. But to-
day I am older. Eight dozen, perhaps
nine, I could manage, but not the
whole gross. But let me tell you a
secret. It was thought that I set up
the Bodley Head in Vigo Street to be
near the Albany. Not a bit of it. It
was because just across Regent Street,
in Glasshouse Street, there is a famous
oyster bar.”
After waiting for some time in the
company of other suppliants for a
few minutes' interview with the auto-
crat of Waterloo Place, Mr. Punch's
representative was at last conducted
to the presence of Mr. REGINALD
SMITH, K.C.
In response to the question as to how
he considered the late Mr. CLARKE's
accomplishment bore upon the prestige
of the publishing profession, Mr. SMITH
shook his head. “No,” he said, “I
confess that I cannot feel that we are
elevated thereby. Indeed, I go farther
and say that I winced when I read the
letter. Not that an oyster per se is
vulgar, or that to consume a few now
and then, at seasonable times, when the
month has an R in it, is not agreeable.
But for a publisher, one who puts forth
books, which are in their turn the product
(more or less) of brains—for a publisher
to eat oyster after oyster for a wager
(and after a steak, too, instead of before
it 1), why, that is, I think, not only a
debasement of the gustatory sense but
a smirch on a noble calling. Good

“But one moment,” our representa-
tive found courage to reply. “You
have, Sir, confessed to a partiality for
oysters yourself. Will you kindly tell
me your highest score at one eating?”
But Mr. SMITH declined. “A pub-
lisher,” he said, “above all men must
be able to keep a secret. If he blabs,
so much the less oyster he.”
“Still,” said our admirably efficient
and plucky messenger, “you will be

“No,” said Mr. SMITH, ringing the
bell that summoned the footman, “no,

Mr. HEINEMANN thought that the
publishing profession was distinctly
elevated by the performance of Mr.
CLARKE, and he was glad that the
record had been brought into such
prominence. The odd thing to him
was that the most picturesque part of
the undertaking had been omitted,
because it was impossible to believe
that any publisher would eat twelve
dozen oysters without finding a few
pearls. Why was there no mention of
Mr. CLARKE's success with pearls?
Until that question was answered he
must decline to say anything more.
speaking on behalf of Messrs. HoDDER
AND STOUGHToN, said that a cordial
feeling of goodwill towards the late
Mr. CLARKE for his genial industry
animated that firm. How could it be
otherwise when the name of SToUGHTON
was, if the truth were known, originally
spelt Stout'un (with reference to that
beverage which most suitably accom-
panies the juicy bivalve on its other-
wise lonely journey to the oesophagus),
but was changed to its present form
out of consideration for the feelings of
the Nonconformist conscience?

You lie at ease in a long deck-chair,
As a woman may who has never a care

With happiness writ from head to heels
And a linen kirtle that oft reveals
A delicate hint of ankle.

To watch you sit on the captain's right
Nibbling the various victuals,
Or to follow the line of that sinuous neck
As you bend your head on the lower deck
Learning the laws of skittles.

Spoil your appetite, cloud your mind,
Ensure you sympathy (staunch and

Whether you lean on a crowded rail
Or stroll on a lonelier fo'c's'le 2
In your thirst for knowledge I've seen

With a puzzled look and a dainty hand
Pointing to gulls and gannets,
Asking the name of rock or ridge,
Wheedlinga man from his auction bridge
To a homily on the planets.
To every sailor you're passing dear,
Be he captain, mate or engineer,
Or merely a bathroom steward;

TRAVELLERS TALES.
HE murmured something about a
Mrs. Hunt who, he said, had probably
mentioned him to me.
“Mrs. Hunt of Westly Square—you
may remember.”
“It is quite possible,” I admitted,
“that I may, but at present I don't.”
He was puzzled at my having for-
gotten a lady who, he had understood,
was an intimate friend. But he con-
cluded that there must have been some
mistake and that he would have to
introduce himself.
As a matter of fact it was quite
unnecessary. We had met before and
I remembered him perſectly. His air
of having thrown himself upon my
generosity, of being about to lay bare
his soul to me, was unforgettable, and,
although it was two years since our
previous interview, I had no doubt as
to his identity.
He hesitated for a moment and then,
gulping down his pride, decided to
make a clean breast of the whole affair.
It seemed that he found himself in
an extremely painful and humiliating
position. He looked at me appealingly.
He mutely thanked me for my
encouragement and, making it clear
that my womanly sympathy had helped
him out wonderfully, plunged into his
story.
He had an ingratiating and con-
fidential manner and I felt that I
ought to be open with him and tell
him of the doubt that had suddenly
sprung into my mind. There was
something I wanted to ask him, some-
thing about himself, but I couldn't
bring myself to speak of it. You see,
I rather thought he was Tea, but then
again he might have been Sewing
Machines.
It appeared that he had once
occupied a very good position, but a
sudden breakdown in his health had
ruined his promising though vague
career. He had since found it im-
possible to obtain a post worthy of his
ability; but was he to let his wife and
children starve for the sake of his
paltry pride 2
I said in a non-committal way that
it was a nice point.
I could see he was hurt by my
attitude, but his was one of those
generous natures that are always ready
No, he had thrown ambition to the
winds and had applied for the position
of agent to a firm in the City. They
were going to engage him, he told me
joyfully, if within a certain period he
were able to sell twenty pounds of
their excellent tea. He paused and,
feeling sure he could trust me with a
secret, admitted that so far he had only
sold seventeen pounds, and if he wasn't
able—but there, he didn't like to think
about it.
It was then that I interrupted him.
It was I, I explained, who found my-
self in a painful position—a position
compared with which the embarrass-
ments of his own were negligible.
Asking him to believe that I was
acting in his own interests, I begged
him, for the sake of his wife and
children, the wife and children for
whom he had already sacrificed so
much—this for emphasis, not for
identification—to give it up.
“I realise,” I said, “how easy it is
to mistake one's vocation, but surely
you cannot be blind to the fact that
your natural aptitudes do not lie in the
direction of Tea Travelling. Seeing
that in the last two years you have

AT THE PLAY.
“DRAKE.”
MR. Louis PARKER has triumphantly
proved that the pageant play can still
hold its own with the cinema. For
one thing, it has colour, though it will
not keep this advantage long. On the
other hand, the cinema has the golden
gift of silence, a great boon to the
imagination, and a source of incalcu-
lable profit in cases where every well-

trained school-child knows what the
words ought to be.
Nobody imagines that the author of
Drake is to be judged by the ordinary
standards of drama, though one re-
viewer solemnly reminds me that “as
a play it does not observe the unities
of time and place, for the scene skips
from one quarter of the globe to an-
other in following Drake's adventures.”
Mr. PARKER would be the last to sup-
pose that his play could have stood
on its merits if it had dealt with the
career of an unknown hero of just any
nationality. He has simply under-
taken to give us pictorial selections
from the hallowed history of a noto-
rious British sea-dog; relying—and his
confidence has been more than justi-
fied—on a common instinct for the
pleasure of recognition and on a popu-
lar prejudice in favour of home-grown
filibusters. -
As for Mr. PARKER's motives and
those of Sir HERBERT TREE, I have
before me, taken from The Pall Mall
Gazette, an illuminating interview with
them both, in which the loſty ideals of
the one are contrasted with the devas-
tating candour of the other—as shown
“‘It is all going to make a very
strong appeal to our patriotism 2' I
suggested. “What do you say, Mr.
PARKER 2'
“‘All I will say on that point,' Mr.
PARKER replied, “is that I hope, at
least, it will have the effect of bringing
people to the theatre.'
“Sir HERBERT, however, left no room
for doubt. He made it quite clear that
there was a definite patriotic purpose in
the production of the play.
“And you really hope it will have
an influence on the nation ?'
“‘Of course I do,” he replied, adding
significantly, ‘I don't stand out of a
play for nothing.’”
If Sir HERBERT is rightly reported
as uttering this ambiguous phrase, I
compliment him on the best mot he
has ever made at his own expense.
In my own case I confess that the
desired effect was mitigated by a feeling
that none of his intelligent admirers
except Queen Elizabeth seemed to make
distinction between Drake the pirate
and Drake the patriot; and by a sus-
picion that his remarks—noble, if lack-
ing in modesty—as to the future that
lay beforo England on the sea (thanks
to the initiative of self and friends)
were directed at me rather than at the
stage-crowd.
Far the best of many good scenes
was that which included the episode of
the trial of Thomas Doughty and the
death sentence pronounced by his old
friend Drake. Here, in their last em-
brace, was a touch of sincere pathos.
Mr. LYN HARDING showed a fine dignity,
and Mr. PHILIP MERIVALE was an
extraordinarily picturesque figure. For
a brief spasm, after Doughty had begged
to “be allowed to die like a gentleman,”
I thought that the cup presented to him
contained hemlock. But a moment's
reflection showed me that the Socratic
method was improbable in the middle
of the Spanish Main, and that the stuff
was just ship's rum. I was particularly
sorry for the traitor, because among the
charges against him was one of high
treason in that he had accused the
Queen of having speculated in Drake's
Chartered Company, and I think he
must have been right; for I had pre-
viously gathered from her own lips that
ONE OF DRAKE'S HEROES
in full parade drcss.
Her Majesty was under the impression
that she had got in on the ground floor.
Miss NEILson-TERRY's Queen made
a very glorious and graceful picture.
There never was such an Elizabeth,
certainly not in history. I felt that
Drake did not properly appreciate her.
Among the various Visits of Elizabeth
(if Mrs. ELINor GLYN will permit the
phrase) there was one occasion when she
paid him a call on the Golden Hind at
Deptford. Here it seemed to me that
Drake, who had been home five weeks,
might well have made his crew a bit
smarter for so august a parade. They
looked as if they had come straight off
a three-months' shipwreck.
If there was anything tedious in the
performance, it was the love-business.
It had a moment's piquancy in the First
Scene, but the rest was mostly conven-
tional. This however did not prevent
Miss AMY BRANDON-THOMAs from look-
ing very sweet as the other Elizabeth.
The humorous relief was slight and
rather obvious, but the tars who were
chiefly responsible for it were of the
right Devon stuff.
Among the most attractive figures—

in the matter of costumes—was that
of Don Bernardino de Mendoza (Mr.
DIGBY STRous), who bore himself very
well; and Mr. HERBERT WARING's sin-
ister part as John Doughty found him
as dapper as ever.
I have only one criticism to pass on
the admirable scenic effects. The
curtain had just gone down on Ply-
mouth Sound, with the Armada re-
ported as somewhere round the corner.
When it rose again there were great
splashes of flame all round the horizon.
It was not quite clear that these were
the beacon-fires which Drake had
ordered; and for the moment I thought
our fire-ships must have got among the
Spaniards.
I am confident that all the accessories
were correct and that even the powder
used in the fight with the Armada was
of the period. Certainly its fumes were
of the most noxious and penetrated as
far as the thanksgiving service at St.
Paul's. This last scene, by the way,
seemed to me a little cramped as a
spectacle, and one felt the lack of some
crowning episode. I could have wished
that Elizabeth might have seen her
way to make Drake a Baronet, but this
would have been to anticipate the
creative art of a subsequent Monarch.
Out of a cast of forty-eight speaking
characters there must remain some
that I have carelessly overlooked or
even failed to identify. But I offer
them all my best thanks in gross for a
very spirited entertainment. O. S.
“LITTLE Miss LLEwBLYN.”
We have had Scotch plays and Irish
plays; now we have a Welsh play.
Well, it was Wales's turn, but it is a
pity that we should only get to Wales
by way of France. Little Miss Llewelyn
is described as “founded on Le Mariage
de Mlle. Beulemans.” There is no harm
in founding a Welsh plot on a French
plot, but it becomes dangerous when
this demands the founding of Welsh
character on French character. In
the play at the Vaudeville Miss Llewelyn
accepts with great calmness the en-
gagement to Thomas Griffiths arranged
for her by her parents, and her horror
when his real character is discovered by
her depends much less upon the fact that
he has a mistress than that he has a
child. All this is very much in accord-
ance with the French view, but I doubt
if it is how the Welsh look at things.
The pity is that there was really no need
for this Franco-Welsh point of view.
Without any loss to the play the plot
could have been so altered as to owe
nothing for its atmosphere to the
country from which it came.

the humours of the play were, I am
prepared to believe, the simple Welsh
humours. Some of the latter were a
little too simple; but Mr. GwBNN was
always so entirely in the picture and
Miss TREVELYAN was always so sweet
that one could not but be pleased. And
there was a surprise in the Third Act,
for a genuinely humorous scene was
sprung upon us here: a committee
meeting of the Licensed Victuallers'
Association in the Ship Inn. I seemed
to see the hand of the producer, Mr.
NorMAN McKINNEL, very plainly in
this—a perfect little picture.
In some of his parts lately Mr. GwBNN
has been inclined to press, but he was
at his very best as Enos Llewelyn,
wonderful. Miss Llewelyn managed
to hide her enchanting Wendy voice
sufficiently to seem Welsh, but she
could not prevent me falling in love with
her again. It was Walter Barrington,
however, who won her in the end,
and he was so nicely played by Mr.
RoNALD SQUIRE that I forgave him.
To the players of all the minor char-
acters I hand out praise lavishly, but
my special thanks are due to Mr. D. H.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DRY CONCLUSION.
PERHAPs it was because I had no
umbrella with me, but depended solely
on a tall silk hat to keep my head pro-
tected from the elements. Perlaps it
was due to reasons entirely unconnected
with myself. Anyhow it rained.
I hurried forward. There were door-
ways on either hand—but they were
crowded to the overflowing point. I
do not enjoy walking in the rain, but
I much prefer so doing to standing
beneath the overflowing point.
I hailed nineteen taxi-cabs. Eighteen
were already occupied and splashed me
with mud. The nineteenth possessed
a defective chauffeur who could neither
see nor hear—and it also splashed me
with mud.
Then a notice caught my eye—
“Second-hand umbrellas eightpence.”
“Good aſternoon,” I said, more from
force of habit than from any possible
relevancy in the remark. “I want an
umbrella, please.”
I placed my hat upon the counter.
It was not badly damaged, but just
enough spotted to show that I was in
no way unreasonable in my request.
The young lady displayed no par-
ticular interest. With one motion of
the hand she selected a gold-mounted
silk umbrella from a shelf, unfurled it,
opened it and placed it in my hand.
I examined the umbrella with sus-
picious interest. It purported to be
manufactured by one Jones, of Camber-
well. The most minute survey failed to
reveal the slightest sign of wear or tear.
“I will take this one,” I said hastily.
I was possessed of a feeling that I
might wake up before I had completed
the purchase. I laid a sixpence and
two coppers on the counter and picked
up my hat.
For the first time since my arrival
the young lady evinced some show of
interest in the proceedings. “Eighteen-
and-sixpence,” she remarked severely.
I dropped the umbrella hurriedly on
to the counter. “But — ”
“Oh, we have them at eightpence,”
she replied with a promptitude which
indicated long practice.
“Then give me an eightpenny one,”
I demanded firmly.
With an air of contemptuous indiffer-
ence the young lady produced a bulgy,
moth - eaten, greeny - black “gamp,”
with two fractured ribs, a curved spine,
and the remains of a handle. “Sold
out of eightpenny," she said. “This
one's tempence. It was a shilling, but
it 's been knocked down.”
“They ought to have taken it to a
hospital,” I remarked sternly. “I
wouldn't be seen working a helpless
“We've a bargain here at one-
eleven-three—”
“One minute,” I interrupted. “What
I require is not so much a bargain as
something which will protect me against
the rain and at the same time not make
me appear over-dressed in my present
clothes.”
The young lady unbent. “Something
about four-and-six 2" she inquired,
embracing a bundle of loose umbrellas,
faggot wise. “These are all four-and-
six. Wonderful value. Be half-a-guinea
new. You can choose whichever you
like. Here's a nice one. Looks almost
new.”
To my untutored eye it appeared
quite new. Its maker was one Jones,
of Camberwell.
“Or this one 2 " she handed me
another. “You can't see much wrong
with that.”
I admitted that any defects in it
were marvellously concealed. I had
not previously heard of Mr. Jones of
Camberwell. But I was gradually
learning his name and residence by
heart.
She eyed me with a suspicious glance
and handed me a third one from the
pile. “That's a cheap one,” she
volunteered.
“Yes—that looks a cheap one,” I
agreed enthusiastically. “How much
is that one 2''
“Four-and-sixpence,” she replied
icily. “They're all four-and-sixpence.”
I felt disappointed in Mr. Jones.
This specimen of his art seemed un-
worthy of his previous standard. I
held out my hand for the next.
“How do you come by these ?” I
enquired.
“Buy them at Scotland Yard sales,”
she replied. “Left in 'buses and taxis
and things—and not called for by their
owners.”
“I can understand that,” I mur-
mured.
“What?" she asked sharply.
“How you get them, of course.
you pick out all the best ones?”
“No,” she replied. “We buy them
in lots of a thousand, and take them
just as they come. Here's a good one.
Only used once or twice, Ishould think.
How people can be so careless beats
me. Fancy losing an umbrella like
this and never going to get it back!”
The rain stopped before I had quite
finished my examination of the fifth
bundle. I took up my hat and brushed
it gently on my sleeve.
“Fancy this one for four-and-six,”
said the young lady desperately. “Only
four-and-six for that l”
“Tell me,” I ventured, “who is Mr.
Jones of Camberwell ?”
Do

to have been in the half-guinea shelf.
We don't let his umbrellas go at
four-and-six However, you've looked
through a lot of unmbrellas, so we'll say
four shillings for that one. You will
find it a really useful article.” -
“Excuse me,” I replied courteously,
“but I shall not, because it is no
longer raining, and I have an umbrella
of my own at the office.”
“But—” she began.
“If I had found a single umbrella in
these bundles that showed the slightest
sign of wear—if I had found one that
was not made by Jones of Camberwell,
I would have bought it.”
“I tell you they are genuine second-
hand bargains,” she snapped. -
“Exactly,” I replied. “But is it
not strange that not one single person
who possessed the work of B.own, the
handicraft of Smith, or a creation by
Robinson, left it unclaimed at Scotland
Yard 2 Here,” and I waved my hand
round the shop, “is the referendum—
here is the public opinion of the um-
brellas by Jones of Cambel well."
I did not wait for the 1eply. I
doubt whether she had one.

THE visit.
(Communicated by a Visitor.)
WE are now on a visit at Aunt Mary's and we are
enjoying it enormously, Peggy and Pad and I. It is really
almost like staying at home, but it's a new home, with
different rooms and chairs and tables, and a different
garden and different photographs to look at and ask about,
and the dogs are different, too. Of course we left Duke,
the Great Dane, and Soo-Ti, the Pekinese, at home, and
very sad they looked when we drove off, though we had
given them each a bone (Soo-Ti's was a little cutlet-bone
and he growled awfully over it) and we had told them we
were coming back on Friday and they must be good dogs
and obey the servants while we were away. - The dogs
here are Chin and Bobby. Chin is a Chinese Chow dog,
a great furry dark-red fellow with very sharp ears and a
sorrowful face. There's only one person in the world
whom he loves, and that's our cousin Sylvia. Whenever
he sees her and she speaks to him he lays back his ears
and smiles and wags his curly tail like mad; but when we
speak to him he pays no attention at all—just walks away
and looks very scornful. Dad says it's like trying to make
friends with the garder -roller, or being -insulted by an
arm-chair which you thought was a very comfortable one
till you tried to sit down in it and found it was full of
tin-tacks. However, Chin went for a walk with us this
morning and seemed rather pleased, so we hope he'll take
to us before we go home. Bob is a fox-terrier, and he loves
being petted, so he gets lots of it. . He's Uncle George's
favourite, not because he is beautiful (he isn't), but because
of his amiable nature and his courage in fighting cats.
When he was quite a young dog he was badly scratched
by a cat with whose kitten he was trying to play, and
º then he has never forgiven cats, but has always
attacked them. -
There's another thing which makes visits different from
being at home, but it's rather difficult to describe it. It's
something like this. When we're at home Dad encourages
Peggy because she amuses him, and she talks and laughs a
good deal and says what she thinks; but before we came
away Dad told her and me we must be quiet and well-
behaved and not offer our opinions when grown-ups were
engaged in conversation. He said he wanted to be proud
of his little girls; and how could he be if Peggy would
insist on giving her views on the German peril, or if I
talked about Socialism and the position of women to Uncle
George!'s So we began by keeping very quiet; but Uncle
George and Aunt Mary always help us by talking about
things we know and getting us to talk too, so we don't
mind a bit. We've been very punctual at all meals, but
Dad was a lot late for breakfast this morning. He said he
couldn't find his ties, but we heard him go to his bath very
late, and we both gave him a look when he came down
and began to excuse himself; but we didn't give him away.
When families are on a visit they must stick to one another
and back one another up through thick and thin—at least
that's what Uncle Fred, our soldier uncle, once said when
he was staying with us and Aunt Laura had her breakfast
in bed because of a sudden head-ache. He said he was
bound to say it was a head-ache because she had told him
so, and no officer ever contradicted a lady even if she wasn't
his wife. Afterwards he told us as a secret that Aunt
Laura was sometimes lazy in the morning, and so was he
himself, but that he always put it down to not being able
to find his boots or being locked out of the bathroom; so
when he was late the next day Peggy whispered “Boots,”
and I whispered “Bathroom,” and he said we'd got him
Anyhow, it's very jolly being on a visit, and I've stayed
up for dinner every night, and we've both played cricket
every morning with Archie. Our family is a rowing family,
but Aunt Mary's is a cricketing family, and we've learnt a
great deal since we've been here about the Australians and
the South Africans and what blobs mean and googlies and
cuts and straight bats and playing a sound game. We also
went one afternoon to Earl's Court and walked all over the
Revenge. A sailor in a helmet and armour took us round.
He let Peggy touch his breast-plate. He said he'd been
afloat himself for many years, but he hadn't been in any
wars since he fought the Spaniards a matter of more than
three hundred years ago. But you never know your luck,
he said, and if he was wanted he'd be there, if his age
wasn't counted against him. He was quite a joky sailor,
and when Dad gave him a shilling he didn't mind taking it
a bit. He said it reminded him of the old days when he
always had a hundred doubloons in his pocket. We also
saw the circus, which was splendid, especially a clown-
dog with the legs of a dacshund and the rest of him like a
Great Dane; and we rode on the Alpine railway; but Aunt
Mary said she thought she wouldn't, so Dad had to come.
He said he didn't object if he were allowed to scream
whenever we rushed down-hill. He did scream, and so did
we and everybody else. It was very good fun. . -
FiN DE saison. .
A FAREwBLL to CRICKET.
LET me go out in splendour. As a chieftain
Of olden days who, just about to die,
Smote, while his armour rattled like a beef tin,
And banged his foeman squarely in the eye,
Then, falling with a crash,
Expired; so let me make one final splash.
That, surely, is my due. Through all this summer
I've had to suffer simply putrid luck:
My scores have made my face grow weekly glummer,
2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0. -
-- Immense is sorrow's weight
To one whose average is just 8.
And it would lift that crushing load of sorrow
If in the Snafflehampton match which ends
Our local season (2 P.M. to-morrow : -
3d., but free to members and their friends)—
If in that closing game
I could achieve a century—and fame.
Or, if that be impossible, then, dash it,
Let me make some sensation. Let me bound
Jessopwise, wallop at the ball, and smash it
Soaring, a perfect sixer, from the ground.
Nay, why prune down the glory?
Let it go plumb through Binks' conservatory.
Or, just to cause a stir, let my dismissal
Bring up some very knotty point of law; -
Or let me, smiting, make my Demon whistle, ****
And smack the stumper right aeross the jaw;
Or even let me close
By getting l.b.w.. with my nose.
Vain dreams! I feel a sense of gloom impending,
A harassing presentiment of woe.
There will be, I foresee, no happy ending,
But probably the scoring book will show
A dull, tame, dismal, flat,
on toast.
Inglorious finish—“Miffkins, did not bat."

- OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. A. E. W. MAson has a pleasant habit of getting the
most charming copy out of his many travels in strange
places, and now we have, in The Turnstile (Hopper AND
Stoughton), the anticipated fruits of his late º
by way of Coventry, into the interior of the House of
Commons. I, for one, must believe him capable of making
a very good book out of this sole theme, so admirable is his
reproduction of the atmosphere of the People's Chamber, so
entertaining are his sketches of certain of its figures,
notably Mr. LLoyd GEonge. But Mr. MAsoN's known
modesty shrank from the task, and he has resorted, for his
purposes as a story-teller, to a great deal of extraneous
colouring matter. Thus the tale opens with an excellent
earthquake at Valparaiso and some exciting scenes on
an Argentine estancia. Cynthia, the heroine, is rescued
by her villainous father from the earthquake; is posted
anonymously through a turnstile into a foundlings' home;
is adopted by a rich childless couple; is traced by her
father; is spirited away to England from his menaces;
lives in terror of rediscovery—groundless, for he dies
without her hearing of it till years afterwards; and even-
tually marries the strong man of the book (whom she does
not love), partly for the sake of protection against the
timorousness which has become part of her nature.
Surely a very inadequate motive for the introduction of all
this exotic interest. -
Then, too, the author must needs provide diversion by
to recognise the working of the detective bacillus caughtinſ
the neighbourhood of the Villa Rose. Such are the dead-of-
night episodes Q
drowned in the Serpentine. Such, too, is the quite un-,
reasonable secrecy about Cynthia's marriage. More sincere,
even if he does not altogether impose his views upon the
reader, is his effort to analyse the change of Cynthia's atti-
tude towards her husband, Captain Rames. At first she
cherishes high ideals for his career, frankly despising ||
the purely vulgar and selfish character of his political am-
bition, but her growing personal sympathy, with the man
makes her decline to his own standard, and the beginning of
love is shown in the very process of this decline. But in
dealing with Captain Rames the author's sincerity fails
him. With a very cynical candour Rames himself confessed
that his brilliant expedition to the Antarctic had been
meant as a mere advertisement to give him a send-off
on some other career totally unnautical. Yet when that
career is at its height of promise and he sees Cabinet rank
within his grasp, the author represents him as seized with
an unquenchable torment of the soul to throw it all up
and make a fresh attempt on the South Pole. Frankly,
the thing is unbelievable. But when all faults are found
and noted there remains both in the matter and in the
manner of this book an arresting charm ; and to say that
so good a romance does not show Mr. MASON at his best—
as in The Four Feathers or The Broken Road—is to pay
him the best compliment at my command.

higher culture in Waverton, Boston, U.S.A., and did him-
self extremely well out of the widows and orphans whose

Olivia, engaged to a superb British colonel, “Lucky
| Ashley," of the Sussex Rifles. “It was he who in South
Africa brought, the M'popos to order without shedding a
drop of blood; it was he who in Eastern Sudan—” etc., etc.
So that it had become “something like a habit at the
Colonial Office or the War Office or the Foreign Office, as
the case might be, whenever there was trouble on one of the
Empire's vague outer frontiers, to ask, ‘Where's Ashley 2’”
...None of this could you guess from the figure he cuts in
this queer street called Straight. He also was a W.C., and
“when he said “Oh ' ' " which he did very often, “he
softened the vowel . . . in a way so droll to the American
ear... so that the exclamation became A-ow !” Possibly
it was that which so impressed the M'popos. A rich and
awkward young American, Peter Davenant, who had once
vainly dared to ask the very stiff and proud Olivia to marry
him, has the timely notion that his money is turning
him into a slacker, and suggests lending or giving all of it

needn't say it again; and in any case you would no doubt
prefer to judge for yourself. -
Myself, I never met a dog that could distinguish between
heroes and villains at sight, but when Barri, the usually
standoffish St. Bernard of Röslein, was instantly affable to
Dr. Helme, I knew what that meant. He was the hero

A clever person once observed in my presence that the

Well, I apologise for repeating it, but really this does seem
to me a criticism not wholly impertinent to the latest work
of Mr. A. NEIL Lyons. He is a writer whom before now
I have admired very greatly, and indeed no one can ſail to
recognise his rare qualities of sincerity and sympathy and
his fine gift for impressionist character-drawing. But in
Clara (John LANE) I cannot help ‘feeling that these good
and graceful attributes have been wilfully subordinated to
the almost childish determination to shock me at all costs.

O LAUNDREss—though a cold machine
Of bloodless I.H.P.,”
You still are, as you long have been,
All woman unto me—
I greet you, not with empty cheer
Or words of hollow praise,
But-seeking, after many a year,
The purpose of your ways.
I ask not why you always fall
On everything that's new
And damage it beyond recall;
For, though of course you do,
It is an old and classic wrong;
And howsoe'er they weep,
Men learn to suffer and be strong
And buy their linen cheap.
Nor is it that you love to ram
The starch in every part
That should be softer than a lamb,
Not harder than your heart;
Nor why the names we deftly mark
Should rouse a fearful hate
That seems to make the whole world
dark,
Till you obliterate.
These mysteries, and many more,
Though maddening, are trite;
The world has sought them oft before,
Yet never found the light.
But there is one thing still more
strange,
A graver, deeper care
That thrills my soul, whene'er I
“change,”
With ever-new despair.

[SEPTEMBER 18, 1912,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CHRISTENING.
I AM going to marry a person called
Gloria; not immediately, of course;
just some time or other.
I can't think how I came to be en-
gaged to a person with that sort of
name. When I asked Gloria, she said
it was a very good name, just as if
she had chosen it herself; and any-
how that didn't answer my question.
The fact is, I fear that Gloria, even
with unfettered liberty of choice, has
no true feeling for names.
This you will see plainly when I
tell you about the cottage, or more
accurately speaking (or writing) The
Cottage.
We don't know yet whether it's
built or not; but it's somewhere on a
moor by a sea; standing in its own
grounds of five rods, poles or perches;
lit throughout by candles, and thatched
to a depth of about three feet—hot in
summer, cold in winter—or it may be
the opposite, I never was much of a
thermodynamic. It is four miles from
the nearest house, and ten from a fire-
station; but we have a telephone in
case the candles set the thatch ablaze.
When Gloria had finished the cottage
and put in the telephone, she said,
“What shall we call it 2 ” .
It didn't seem to me to matter
much ; but I felt it was time for me
to show some independence, so I took
a strong line, and said, -
“Anything except ‘The Labur.
nums.’”. - - . . - - -
“Ah!” said Gloria, “that's the
very name I was thinking of. Never
mind, though. What about ‘The
Lawn'?” - - - -
“That's the same as ‘The Labur-
nums,’” I said hastily, “and so is
“The Cedars,’ and ‘Fairholme,’ and
‘Mont Repos,' and ‘Hill View.” I
really believe, Gloria, for two two's
you'd call it ‘The Ingle.’”
“But there will be a lawn,” said
Gloria.
“I'm glad of that,” I said; “I
always felt that a lawn would be most
genteel. But you see if we had a
lawn any fool could see what it was ;
and if we hadn't they'd either think
us liars or come nosing round into the
back-yard to look for it. Why, they'd
be knocking us up at all hours to
ask about it. We'd never get any
sleep.”
Gloria considered.
“Well,” she said, “what would you
call it 2 ”
“I think,” I said, “I should call it
‘1.’ You've got to consider the post-
man. Numbers are so much easier for
the poor man.”
“It would be much more absurd,” I
said, “if we called it 273 A.”
“But I want a name,” said Gloria;
“it won't have any individuality with-
out a name.”
“Suppose,” I suggested brilliantly,
“we call it “The Submerged Tenth 2
You see, income £500, rent £50—”
“If you imagine,” interrupted Gloria,
“we’re going to pay £50 a year for a
cottage, you'd better start looking for
one with a gold roof and Venetian
glass windows.”
“There aren't many going,” I said
dubiously. “So few Americans have
taken English shootings these last few
seasons we can't expect a moor cottage
to have every modern convenience.
Still, I'll ring up Harrod's and ask.”
“No, you won't,” said Gloria;
“we’re going to call it “The
|Cottage.’” -
“Look here, Gloria,” I said seriously,
“you don't appear to realise for a
moment what's in a name. When
you name a house you're supposed to
be instructing and edifying the trav-
eller, not telling him what he could
have seen with his eyes shut. When
I see a red-brick semi-detached called
‘The Oaks,' it suggests things. I
immediately look for an oak fence, or
peer through the pantry window to see
if they've got oak butter-tweezers.”
“Rubbish,” said Gloria; “they don't
tweeze butter, anyhow.”
“Not now,” I said, “but it used to
be the thing to do with butter. My
grandfather was once champion boy
butter-tweezer of Northumberland.”
“At all events,” said Gloria, “I’m
going to have a straightforward
name; and “The Cottage ' is good
enough for me.”
“Well,” I said, after reflection,
“you may call it “The Cottage' if you
add something to make it plain to the
public that the title does not claim
either to amuse or to instruct—is, in
fact, a mere label. Otherwise we'd
simply be wasting its time.”
“There won't be any public,” said
Gloria; “but you can do what you like
so long as you call it “The Cottage.’”
“Very well,” I said finally; “it
shall be called ‘The Cottage, As It
Obviously Is.’”
So that is where we are; and now, if
you ever chance to strike a building
of that name, you'll know how it
happened; and we'll be delighted to
give you a cup of tea on the lawn.

SYLVIA'S PRESENT.
I NoTICED when we strolled into the
café that Sylvia's eyes had an unusual
sparkle, and I mentioned the fact to
Edward as we secured our customary
table. Edward told me not to talk rot:
which is characteristic of the man.
No sooner were we seated than
Sylvia came up in her winsome way
and handed me a menu together with
a ravishing smile. I studied them
both very carefully while she and
Edward exchanged greetings.
“Chop for me, please,” I said. “Ed-
ward will have a steak, of course. He's
no originality, Sylvia.”
I glanced at her again and felt certain
“Absurd—so tactless. Why, it's
thrusting the poor girl's profession
down her throat.”
Sylvia made a timely approach with
the steak.
She inspected us closely.
“You both look quite serious,” she
remarked.
“Sylvia,” I said, “who is this person
you're going to tie yourself to?”
Sylvia put an extra sparkle into her
eyes.
“I shan't tell you just yet,” she said.
A bell rang rather angrily close by
and she hurried away.
“Now,” said Edward, “you think
of something. It must be something
useful, you know. She's probably
of us again. I waved it aside and got
up quickly from the table.
“No sweets,” I said; “after your
announcement I couldn't look at them.
Henceforth, Edward and I eat for the
solepurposeof keeping alive. Farewell.”
I hurried out of the café and led the
way to the establishment of one Smith
an ironmonger.
“We must get the things at once,”
I said ; “I have it direct from the
market that door-mats are on the boom.
We can make the presentation on Mon-
day. Come along.”
We had a heavy afternoon.
On the Monday morning, with the
aid of a taxi, we arrived at the café
well in advance of the general public.
she was looking a little unusual.
“You're exceptionally nice to-day,
Sylvia; what is it?” I asked.
She blushed. I looked at Edward
triumphantly.
“Engaged,” he said.
Sylvia smiled (and Sylvia smiling
is a sight for the gods).
“Good guess. I'm going to be
married very soon.”
I clutched at a piece of bread;
Edward knocked his knee against
the table leg.
“When 2" we asked.
“Next week if I may, please.”
“I cancel the chop,” I said very
firmly. “I refuse to eat.”
Sylvia laughed adorably and went
to place our orders.
“Jove!” exclaimed Edward," what
an ideal "
“Not at all,” I said; “people get
married every day, and Sylvia's an
exceptionally attractive girl.”
Edward looked annoyed.
“I mean I’ve got an idea,” he
explained — “you needn't laugh.”
He paused impressively. “We must

plate. I followed with the scraper;
it came into collision with more than
one chair, and by the time wereached
our table the beastly thing was com-
pletely out of hand. I sat on it.
Sylvia came up.
She gazed at the door-mat with
obvious astonishment.
“Good gracious,” she cried, “what
have you got there?”
Edward looked at me; it had been
arranged that I should deliver a little
address suitable to the occasion.
I spread the notes of my speech
on the table and cleared my throat.
Sylvia didn't appear to catch the
meaning of it all until I came to the
last recital: “And whereas a mar-
riage is shortly intended to be
solemnised between the said Sylvia
and the said A. B–"
“Oh,” she cried, “how perfectly
sweet of you both ! I'm sure Lance-
lot will be delighted with the pre-
sents.” For no apparent reason she
give Sylvia a present.”
“Not so loud,” I whispered.
“You know,” he continued, “Sylvia's
waited on us jolly well for two years;
and she's wonderfully pretty.”
“She's pretty,” I agreed, “and of
course I've nothing serious against the
girl; but there was that episode of the
tough steaks, you may remember.”
“That wasn't Sylvia's fault.”
“Possibly not; but I had fearful in-
digestion for days afterwards.”
“Well, what do you suggest ?”
“I don't suggest "I began, when
Sylvia appeared, preceded by a chop.
“Undoubtedly, undoubtedly,” I said.
Edward looked surprised; he is no
diplomat.
“I don't suggest anything,” I re-
peated when Sylvia was out of hearing.
“I leave that to you.”
“What do you think of knives and
marrying a respectable joiner, and they
won't be well off.”
There was a dead silence for five
minutes. Suddenly the idea came to me.
“You want something respectable for
a useful joiner. Very well, then, what
better than a boot-scraper? No dirty
carpets, no mud-stained mantelpieces;
the chair-cover a dead-letter.”
“Not enough,” he said; “hadn't we
better include a door-mat?”
“We might; but she's sure to get
several door-mats. Anyone can think
of a door-mat. But a scraper, Edward,
a scraper; at least it's original.”
“A scraper and a door-mat or no-
thing,” he insisted.
I hate arguing, it always gives me
a pain in the head, and Sylvia was
coming back just then, so I conceded
the door-mat.

Edward looked mystified. He told
me afterwards that he thought Lancelot
was an unusual name for a joiner.
“Lancelot. Who is the man 2" he
inquired ; “what does he do?”
Sylvia laughed again. “I'm afraid
he doesn't do anything.”
“It's no laughing matter,” I groaned.
“Sylvia, you're not going to marry one
of the unemployed. You're far too nice.
Besides, he'd be sure to forget to use
the scraper.”
“Or the mat,” Edward added hastily.
“Has he any money, or are you
going to support the rotter?”
“He's plenty of money,” she gurgled
gently. “And he doesn't do anything

THE CHOICEST EFFORTS OF THE GREAT COMEDIAN FALL FLAT.
IN OTHERWISE BRILLIANT CAREERS.
THE PRINCE of FINANCE GETs THE worst of A BUSINEss DEAL.
DEDUCTIVE EVIDENCE.
The Daily Mail's Paris correspondent
reports as follows:—
“An aged parrot put to flight yesterday three
burglars who broke into a house in the Rue de
Suez. As they entered the house they were
startled by a voice saying, ‘Who goes there?'
Immediately they took to their heels and fled.
When the owner of the house returned he
found the parrot still proudly repeating, ‘Who
goes there?’”
Some equally well-attested marvels
have come to our knowledge:–
ASToUNDING INTELLIGENCE of A
FIRE-BUCKET.
Dooley's Theatre narrowly escaped
destruction by fire last night. Nothing
would have been known of the pre-
vented calamity but for the discovery
this morning of the fact that a fire-
bucket in the vestibule had wrenched
out the fastening that held it to the
wall and had overturned with all its
contents on to the Turkey carpet. It
is thus clear that some careless person
had thrown down a half-spent match
in the vestibule, and that the watchful
vigilance of the fire-bucket had averted
a serious catastrophe.
AMAZING ALTRUISM of A
BLACK-BEETLE.
On the 16th inst. a young man, in
an advanced state of alcoholic delirium,
rushed down the stairs of his lodgings,
with the intention of hurling himself into
a black-beetle, perceiving no other way
of frustrating the rash youth's wicked
design, deliberately got under his foot,
causing him to slip and fall. All night
he lay with his head comfortably
pillowed on the doormat, and, awaken-
ing in chastened mood, went forthwith
and signed the pledge. The facts of the
case are beyond dispute, because the
remnants of the heroic beetle were
found on the hall linoleum. They have
been gathered together and conveyed
to the South Kensington Museum.

A hint of gold about your ear,
Of pistols at your girth,
Marooned mid isles of shale and
shells,
Where time is told by notches—
But, as it is, you ring the bells
Maybe you think that life is stale,
That modern times are dull,
That privateers no longer sail
Beneath the bones and skull,
That nowadays no smugglers brag
Of beaches nice and handy,
Whereon a crew may run their swag
Of dutiable brandy.
But you are wrong, my friend; you take |
A pessimistic view;
For still ferocious blackguards slake
Their thirst for derring-do;
Braver than once, your smuggler rows
His kegs o'er sunlit reaches,
While pirates have the cheek to pose
On panoramic beaches.
Then why should Fortune clip the wings
Of one whose instinct soars
Above the world of trivial things
His pirate soul abhors?
Nay, quarter-master, snap your thumb
At one who mocks you, dupe her,
Give up the Service and become
A bioscopic “super.” J.M.S.

“WHAT's that you're carrying?” said Francesca sus-
piciously.
“It looks,” I said, “like a parcel done up in brown
paper and tied with cord. It's something hard—a box,
I think. Yes, I'm sure it's a box.”
“A box 2 What's in it 2 ”
“I haven't looked yet. It might be bulbs or chocolates.”
“And it might be eggs or cabbages.” -
“Yes,” I murmured doubtfully, “it might, of course, be
eggs or cabbages.” -
“Is it addressed to me?” said Francesca sternly. She
is often quite stern about trivial things.
“No, I think not. At least, it didn't seem to be a
minute ago. But perhaps it has altered itself. It ought to
have been addressed to you; but there—you can look at
the label yourself—it isn't. Most inconsiderate, I call it.
I shall certainly write to the people and complain. They
ought——"
“But is it something for me?”
“How can I tell until I've looked inside it? I'm hoping
all the time it's going to be for you, but people do some-
times make mistakes and send me things—trousers, you
know, and braces, and shooting-boots, and collars and
things of that kind. I've struggled against it, but it's
quite useless.” -
“If,” said Francesca, “it’s something you've bought for
yourself it's certain to be a piece of ridiculous extravagance.”
“You’ll be sorry for that, Francesca.”
“I’ll take my chance of that. Anyhow, let's undo the
absurd thing.”
“Hush, Francesca. This may be something very sensitive.
Do not use rash and wounding words even about unknown
objects. I knew a man once * ,
“So did I, and he was six foot six high and broad in
proportion, and he had a red beard, and his eyes were
green, and when he looked at you you wanted to fall down
and worship him.”
“Oh, but that's not the man I knew. Mine was only
five feet five and pigeon-breasted and clean-shaved, and his
eyes were grey, and when he looked at you you generally
kicked him. A most peculiar man. His name was—”
“Give me the pen-knife,” said Francesca.
She cut the cord and rapidly undid the paper.
“There,” I said, “I told you it was a box, and it is a box.
What do you say now?"
“You get more wonderful every day. Let's see what's
inside it.”
“Fatal curiosity' That's how ministers of police always
get blown up. Pause, Francesca. Well, if you won't it's
not my fault.”
I pressed up two catches and lifted the box off its base.
“Why, you dear stupid old thing,” said Francesca, “it’s
a typewriter! And at your age, too!"
“Come, Francesca, it's not my fault. I didn't ask you
to open it. You brought this on yourself, you know.”
“But you'll never, never be able to learn it. Your
fingers are much too stiff.”
“My fingers will have to submit. Do you think I'm
going to let a little thing like a finger stand in my way?
Besides, I've tried it at the shop. I've written the whole
alphabet in quotation marks, and all the punctuation
marks, and I know where to find the thumb-pawl.”
“The what?’” said Francesca.
“The thumb-pawl. That shiny thing, sticking up. And
I've made friends with the spacer and the platen and the
knurl and the swinging bail. Let me show you”—I in-
now it's ready. Just think, Francesca, of all the wonders
in that machine. There's a novel, a problem-play, a book
of essays, a volume of poems > y
“All typed with the thumb-pawl.”
“A defence of revealed religion, a pamphlet on Free
Trade, notes for a speech on foreign policy. With this,
Francesca, we can rule the world.”
“Let's write a sentence first,” said Francesca, pre-
paring to seat herself in front of the machine.
“No, you don't, Francesca,” I said. “Nothing of the
sort,” and with a deft movement I inserted myself in the
chair. “Some day,” I continued, “you shall be allowed to
play with it, but not now. You can watch me while I
click it—or, stay, you can dictate to me out of that book—
any page will do—and then you shall see what you shall
see. Are you ready ?" -
Francesca knows when the moment for submission has
come. She took up the book and began to read :—
“‘My poor son-in-law has suffered so much in health,’ ”
she read. I looked for the letter “M” carefully. It had
vanished.
“What are you waiting for 2" said Francesca.
“Francesca,” I said, “I will not deceive you. Your
words have made me think. We have no sons-in-law now,
but some day we may have three. Of what sort will they
be 2 Will they respect us and shall we like them, or will
they talk of us casually as ‘my in-laws' 2 Will they help
to minister to our old age, or will they ” At this moment
I found the “M” and pressed it hastily. It made a beautiful
click. “If you will look at the paper, Francesca,” I said
proudly, “you will find that I have made a good
beginning.”
“You’ve made nothing of the sort,” she said. “You've
made a small 'm' instead of a capital.”
“I did it,” I said, “to prove you, and you have come
nobly out of the test. We will now make a space and
begin again.”
Everything now went swimmingly. In five minutes I
had managed to get to the end of the word “son."
“Francesca, dear,” I said, “this is weary work for you.”
“Oh, no,” she said, “not weary. Tedious, perhaps, but
not weary. Come, make the hyphen between ‘son’ and
in.'” -
“The hyphen 2" I said. “Is it right, do you think, to
make hyphens? "
“It’s printed here with hyphens, and I insist on having
them.” -
“Well, have it your own way. The hyphen is
here's the little beggar underneath the letter 'G' on the
same disc,” and down it went.
At last I struck the “h” at the end of “health,” and
paused. “We will now,” I said, “pull the paper out and
see what we've accomplished. See how easily it is released.
Now let us—no, I don't think it would be fair to you. It
is too well done; you will be discouraged. I will preserve
this in my pocket-book.”
But Francesca was too quick for me. She seized the
paper and looked at it. Then she smiled grimly. It had
come out like this:— -
“m My porsonginglaw hassuffedsso muchin dealth.”
“It was a bad sentence to start with," I urged. “These

TERRIBLE RESTAURANT
OUTRAGE.
FAMoUs WRITER's Noble PROTEST.
MR. FILsoN YouNg, writing in a
recent number of The Pall Mall Gazette,
utters a poignant cry of protest against
a grave public scandal.
“Yesterday,” writes Mr. FILson
YoUNG, in his usual impressive italics,
“lunching in the Carlton grill-room
was a party of four, which included a
child about five years old.” It is pain-
ful to learn that this intrusive infant
“did not really like the admirable but
unsuitable food provided for him,” and,
after giving further distressing details,
Mr. FILsoN YoUNG observes that “the
sight of a child in such a place strikes
one as an impropriety; and rightly so.
To take a child to the Carlton is incon-
siderate both to other people and to
him.”
We append a selection from the
letters elicited by Mr. FILson YouNg's
dignified and memorable protest:-
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I can fully sym-
pathize with Mr. FILsoN YoUNg in his
manly protest against the abominable
selfishness of bringing children to ex-
pensive restaurants, as I myself have
been victimized in precisely the same
the Fitz when, to my disgust, I saw a
child of not more than ten at an ad-
joining table. I was engaged on some
turtle soup at the moment, but the
shock to my moral sense was so great
that I actually swallowed a piece of
green fat without thinking—a thing I
have never done before. What, I ask,
is England coming to when such things
are tolerated ? People talk about the
iniquity of the Insurance Act, but this
strikes at the root of our social system
and destroys the amenity of restaurant
life, which makes us what we are.
I am, Yours indignantly,
PHILIP GoRGERY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I trust you will
back for all you are worth Mr. FILsoN
YoUNg's splendid denunciation of the
decadent practice of bringing children
to first-class restaurants. Nothing is
more lamentable at the present day
than the disregard of adults by their
juniors. The respect and consideration
due to age seem to be things of the
past. Only the other day, when travel-
ling to Vienna in the train de lure, I
found myself quite unable to concen-
trate my attention on a financial article
owing to the chatter of an overdressed
child—English, I regret to say. If
children must go to restaurants, let
them at least have the decency to avoid
than thirty shillings on a meal without
loss of self-respect.
Yours faithfully,
“MAXIMA DEBETUR seniBus
REVERENTIA."
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - Mr. FILson
YoUNG as usual hits the right nail on
the head. It is a desecration of the
fine art of gastronomy to allow its
votaries to be disturbed by the presence
of children, who are wholly incapable
of appreciating its higher mysteries.
If he errs at all it is in the gentleness
of his rebuke. He speaks of the incon-
siderateness shown to their elders. I
call it downright cruelty. Personally
I can never eat caviare, ortolans, or

Weary Tommy. “AN UNEDUCATED BLIGHTER THE BLOKE what cALLED THIS SALISBURY PLAIN."
THE UMBRABELLA.
It was after this wettest of all
recorded “Camps" that Fragonet
spoke to me about his umbrabella. He
is not of those who delight in discussing
the number of Territorial Batteries
requisite to kill one German scout —
nor how many Yeomen must bestride
a single charger into action. Details
such as these, by every British prece-
dent, are settled after Peace is declared.
It is the triumph of experience over
theory. It has made us what we are.
It will make us what we shall be.
| But, for the comfort of the lads be-
hind the counter—the lads who make
the charges and, if I may say so,
the counter-charges — he is most
earnestly concerned. “Why,” says he,
“should these gallant fellows—Eng-
land's third hope—be subjected to an
inconvenience which a few hundred
thousand pounds would totally re-
move 2"
Inspired by such thoughts he took it
upon himself to write to the Secretary
of State for the War Department and
offer him at very moderate rates (as
such things go) an invention of his
own for ensuring blue skies and a
“Nothing,” he points out to him (on
page 17), “can exceed the discomfort
experienced by troops under canvas in
such weather as we now absorb. Will
you condemn the protégés of your
predecessor to plod squelchily home,
day by day, through the streaming rain
when a word (and a cheque) from you
would ensure their being as dry as the
proverbial Scotsman 2"
This invention of Fragonet's is sim-
plicity itself. It consists of the upper-
works of an umbrella. In place of the
conventional “stick” there is a short
steel spike which fits into the muzzle
of the rifle.
It is an undisputed scientific fact that
if one goes out with an umbrella it
never rains. The effect on the weather
of—let us say—the London Scottish
marching out of camp with their thou-
sand kilts a swinging and their thousand
umbrabellas raised towards the heavens
would be irresistible. A month's
drought at least would follow. The
sun would blaze all day and, very
possibly, all night. The Territorial
would sing blithely on the march and
the farmer in the cornfield.
When not in use the umbrabella is
sheathed alongside the bayonet in an
Nor is this all. The convex surface,
which is coloured green, bears upon it
a life-size portrait of the profile of a
sheep. By way of rank badges and
further to enhance the deception, the
umbrabellas carried by officers will
have one or more sheep-dogs painted
on them.
Think what superlative “cover” it
would be Brigade after brigade,
bleating plaintively, could advance to
the firing line and pour their volleys
into the unsuspecting foe. Victory is
ours. Mars smiles down on us in war
and Phoebus beams on us in peace |
Never again, says Fragonet, need
such an Annual Training as this last
one be endured. Let the Government
beware how it refuses to provide pro-
tection for its citizen soldiers. A
General Election is coming. Let it, he
says, beware lest these dripping and
neglected “Terriers” change their
name to “Torials.”
Sometimes I wonder if Fragonet is
as mad (or as sane, for that matter) as
he pretends to be.

“ART AND OPPORTUNITY.”
ONe is familiar enough with the kind
of comedy that starts as a comedy
and then, half-way through, the finer
humour gives out and somebody squirts
a soda-siphon and somebody else trips
over the door-mat just to keep things
going, and the last Act is carried
through on a hurricane of buffoonery.
Well, this is not quite what happened
with Mr. HAROLD CHAPIN’s “comedy”
at the Prince of Wales's. Physically,
though the Third Duke of Keels had
his restive moments, the players kept
themselves under reasonable control;
it was the motives of their actions, or
at least those of the chief figure, that
degenerated into a sort of intellectual
farce.
Mrs. Cheverelle, widow and adven-
turess, has secured the affections of
Algernon dºc. Gossamore, callow youth
and son of the heir-presumptive to the
Dukedom of Keels. In a First Act full
of pleasant comedy we see her disarming
the parent's opposition by her trans-
parent candour. She is of the jelly-fish
order, her very transparency serving,
like a protective colouring, to render
her true character invisible. It is
son in favour of the father, thus saving
one of the intermediary steps to fortune.
In the Second Act, to the natural in-
dignation of the youth (it almost always
shatters a son's piety to be cut out by
his father in an affair of the heart), she
makes this transilient move. Mean-
while, to the Duke, who had com-
missioned his very businesslike private
secretary to buy her off, her upward
progress threatens danger. Is he not
the climax? What is to prevent her
from leaping at one fell bound to the
top of the ladder, disregarding all the
lower rungs?
The ducal eye is under her fascina-
tion. He is her rabbit and she his
boa-constrictor. But the author is
determined at all costs to be anything
but obvious. As in the best detective
stories, where the crime is ultimately
traced to the very last person you ever
thought of, so here the gay widow falls
finally into the arms of the most
improbable of all the male cast—the
private secretary, with whom she has
hitherto not exchanged one civil word.
If the author was determined to
have this dénouement, I venture to
suggest that he might have got at it
by a more exhilarating process. The
lady should have demanded from the
of her dismissal, and married him on
the proceeds. Wasn't there a no-
torious precedent for something like
this in the best circles?
But the author had his own views,
and preferred to bring about his results
by an elaborate feat of casuistry which
imposed upon nobody; and in the end
the adventuress makes nothing by it.
By the other scheme she would have
secured the one thing she was out for
—namely a fortune, for she doesn't
seem to have worried much about the
title. But, as it is, she gains nothing;
for there was never any pretence that she
had made the one slip that the cleverest
adventuresses sometimes make, and
actually fallen in love with an ineligible.
The fact is that Mrs. Cheverelle is a
little too clever for herself, and far
too clever for her audience; and this
is true of a good deal of the play.
I am confident that if the author would
only put himself in the position of his
audience—infants crying for the light
—he would soon learn to temper the
obscurity of his dark sayings, and
make things easier for us. He was

here he might have made the proper
distinction that what a woman likes to
see is the triumph of her sex and the
discomfiture of the individual repre-

she said, or why she said them, but
they knew it must be all right so long
as she said them in her own inimitable
way. But I don't quite know how we
should have fared without Mr. GRAHAM
BRowNE's Duke. It was a really
humorous sketch, both on the political
side and on the social, and had the
further merit of being thoroughly
understandable. His final burst of
gratitude to his secretary for having
rescued him from the widow's clutches
saved a very improbable situation and
sent a puzzled audience away on good
terms with its own intelligence. Mr.
BREoN was all that you could want of
ingenuous youth and long plastered
hair, and Mr. FRANCE as his father
was very sound indeed in the First Act.
Mr. TREvoR, as the secretary, said his
words briskly, but never gave us any
clue to the widow's reason for being
attracted to him. Finally, Miss KATE

delightfully emphatic clarity, being the
one person on the stage of whom you
could confidently predict that she would
always know her own mind and take
care that everybody else knew it.
There is a phrase that someone uses
about something in the play: “A little
involved but still interesting”; and
this is a fair description of the author's
work. If only he will make his motives
as clear as his dialogue, at its best, is
brilliant, he should travel far.
“Everywoman.”
It is not really the story of Every-
woman, nor yet of Everyotherwoman;
indeed I hope it is not even the story
of Every hundredthwoman. You might
as well describe Hogarth’s “Rake's
Progress” as the history of Everyman.
The Drury Lane version of the career
of a typical woman is in no sense
typical, except of Drury Lane, and not
always of that.
My second trouble is concerned with
the incongruity of this mixture of the
phraseology of the Middle Ages with a
setting of modern realism. And the
costumes only added to the medley,
running riot as they did through all
sorts of confounded periods. Most of
the personifications of Virtues and
Vices were in present-day dress: but
Passion was a Georgian highwayman;
Flattery might have stepped out of

garb of a mediaeval apprentice. Thirdly,

to one particular woman, and dying
half-way through the play. Yet, if
we may believe KEATs, Truth and
Beauty are identical, and if the one is
eternal then so is the other.
Their actions, too, and the sequence
of them, were often strangely illogical.
Thus it is not till after she has yielded
to Passion that Everywoman is deserted
by Modesty, and it is then that she
calls in Conscience to comfort her, at
the very moment when you would

torture. Beauty, again, perishes long
before Youth. Yet, if I have any
acquaintance, by report, with the arts
of almost Every Woman, it is generally
the other way about. Then there was
Passion, who was represented as
deceiving the lady under the mask
of Love. Yet she knew his real name,
for his label was perfectly clear;
and so there was not the faintest
excuse for mistaking his identity.
Comparisons, inevitably suggested,
between Everywoman and The Nun
were all in favour of Dr. REINHARDT's
pageant. The lurid career that was
conceivable in the one case was purely
arbitrary in the other. Her cloistral
seclusion naturally encouraged in The
Nun a passionate curiosity to see
something of Love and the colour of
Life; and it was as an unprotected
female that she adventured into the

Modesty to companion her; with a per-
fectly respectable King Love living
next door, and Truth, his mother,
ready to chaperon her at any time.
In the matter of artistic design and
unity it would, of course, be ludicrous
to compare the two productions, and
there was also an incalculable advantage
enjoyed by The Nun in being a pageant
without words. For, though a true
poet in the person of Mr. STEPHEN
PHILLIPs had been called in to tinker
up the original of Everywoman, he
must have found some of it past repair,
for, to be frank, the amended libretto
was not very great stuff.
Still, with the bizarre material at his
command Mr. ColliNs made an admir-
able show; and the performance of Miss
ALEXANDRA CARLISLE, of whom one
hardly suspected so much versatility
or so earnest a sincerity, was a real
triumph. Of the rest, the best of the
figures was perhaps that of Miss
CoLLINGE as Youth, a very sympathetic
study. Miss GLADYs Cooper was well-
chosen for the part of Beauty, and Miss
WINTER for that of Mcdesty. As
Passion, Mr. DouTHITT sang his dread-
ful drawing-room lines with a fine
resonance, though he shattered tradi-
tion by not being a tenor. Miss KATE
RoRKE as Truth, an antique who was
ultimately restored as good as new, did
a very sound piece of work; and Mr.
FRED LEWIs, as a bloated millionaire,
conquered many difficulties.
Finally, my sympathies go out to
Mr. H. B. IRVING, whose business it
was, as a kind of chorus, to throw off
from time to time a lot of dull doggrel,
only relieved by an incredibly frequent
iteration of the same little joke upon
his name of Nobody. With the assist-
ance of some bilious-green limelight he
bore it with an extraordinary and
heroic composure.
Artistically, and for the purposes of
an allegory, the first scene was the
best; for the background, the costumes
and the scheme of movement were
largely decorative and avoided actuality.
Of the realistic scenes the one of which
most was expected—Piccadilly Circus
—was disappointing. It never sug-
gested the original. A single practicable
electric brougham (the rest were fixed
in two dimensions) was inadequate to
represent the maëlstrom of traffic in
this congested locality; and the chief
merit of the scene was the miraculous
rapidity with which it gave place to
the exterior of a church, with snow-
storm. On the other hand, “The Stage
of a Theatre” was a very remarkable
and daring exposure of the sordid
secrets of life behind the foot-lights of
what I took to be Drury Lane itself.

NEWS FROM THE BOURSE.
My HUMILIATION.
IT may be true that some men are
born great; but it is absolutely true—
no doubt whatever — that some men
are born never to be able to sell any-
thing. I am chief of them. To buy,
yes; but to sell ?—that is another
matter. How is this 2 Why is it that
the two gifts, although united in certain
of us, are so utterly distinct in others?
I will give you an example. Suppose
that I want a dog. It matters very
little what kind of a dog; but a dog.
I ask advice and find that there is no
dog so popular as a bob-tailed sheep-
dog—blue, old English and so forth.
“Get a good one,” says the counsellor,
and—this is all supposition, of course—
I do so. There is no difficulty, not the
least. The world is suddenly full of
people with the best bob-tailed sheep-
dogs to sell. I select a breeder, write
to him, choose a particularly promising
pup and send a cheque for him. How
much 2 Five guineas, let us say.
Nothing is easier than this. I am on
my own ground: I am buying.
Suppose next that after a couple of
years, during which time the dog has
been trained to work with the flock,
I want to sell him for any reason.
He is too big, too clumsy, he breaks
too many flowers, he eats too much
money; or say that the shepherd who
has trained him has left the neighbour-
hood and did not need him any more
and the dog moped when not in his
company.
Say what you like: the point is that
he has to go; that the time is ripe for
me to become a seller—what then 2
You would fancy that, the fashion in
dogs not having changed in the inter-
val, sheep-dogs were still marketable.
Perhaps they are; but not mine. He
cost five guineas, I said, when a pup.
He is now trained and tried: surely he
is worth eight 2 I advertise him at
that and get no replies. I advertise
again at six and get no replies. He
has a pedigree, we will assume, a yard
long. I advertise him at four and get
no replies. I offer him to his original
breeder, recalling the circumstances of
the purchase, but he answers that
he cannot trace the transaction and
does not want to purchase, anyway. I
advertise him at three guineas and
receive two replies—both from shep-
herds, poor men, as they are careful
to point out—offering one pound if he
satisfies on trial. I offer to send him—
both are, of course, living a long way
off and the fare and trouble would cost
five shillings, and neither replies again.
Then I advertise no more, but put
that a sheep-dog is for sale, and still
I get no replies. I ask my friends if
they want a dog, and all say No, except
one man, who would not mind one as
a gift. The end of it is that the dog
remains on my hands and continues
to do damage and mope and eat money.
Meanwhile the breeder from whom I
bought him is selling sheep-dogs all
day long, and The Exchange and Mart
is full of traffic in sheep-dogs. And
mine is as good as any of them, and
probably a good deal cheaper, but he
will be on my hands for ever.
because it is my destiny not to be able
to sell—only to buy.
I took a sheep-dog as an example
because it is apt. But there are other
things as striking. I can take a house
with any man; but can I let it? No.
I can buy shares; but can I sell them
at anything but a loss? No. I buy
old books and their value instantly
drops. I buy water-colours and no
one but myself has the faintest desire
to possess them. And all the time I
am meeting men whose sole activity in
life is to pick up this and that bargain
and reap fifty per cent, on it. So
diversified we are; so many of us are
there to make up this little world.
THE BOOM IN PARLIAMENTS.
MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL's scheme
of Federal Home Rule, under which the
country would possess ten or a dozen
parliaments, has not been allowed to
pass unnoticed.
Already a hot discussion is raging in
Lancashire as to the most suitable
centre for the parliament house for
that county. While there are numbers
who feel that Manchester should be the
honoured city, the people of Wigan
feel very strongly that Wigan should
be the seat of government. As for
Yorkshire, the Mayor of Scarborough
has not delayed to press the claims of
that resort, pointing out most justly
that the town affords excellent boating
and bathing, with bands, pierrots and
other attractions.
Something like consternation reigns
in Burslem and its neighbouring towns
at the suggestion that the Midlands
should possess a parliament of its own.
At a street corner the other evening,
a group of five or six determined-look-
ing townsmen was heard to state in
unison, “Burslem will fight, and Bur-
slem will be right,” and this is but the
beginning of a movement that is bound
to spread like wild-fire. Already certain
of the local political associations have
purchased iron dumb-bells and Indian
clubs, and other implements will be
secured if necessary. An advertisement
And all
eighteen to twenty competent drill-
sergeants able to keep a secret tells its
own tale. “Convention" and “cove-
nant" are two of the most popular
words in the Five Towns, and there is
an enormously increased sale of Mr.
ARNoLD BENNETT's books, into which
ardent students are delving for full
information about the revolutionary
methods of the French.
A well-known firm of building con-
tractors, in conjunction with one of
our most enterprising architects, has
been at work night and day in getting out
designs and estimates for a useful and
inexpensive type of parliament house.
In a few days the results of their labours
will be placed before the authorities,
and quotations for single buildings, or
per dozen, will be submitted.
We should like to add that, for real
bargains in maces and Speakers' wigs,
there is little to choose between Gam-
ridge's and Selfage's.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
AcTUALLY, for the first four or five chapters of Lamorna
(METHUEN), I thought it was going to prove that hitherto
undiscovered thing, a novel by Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick in
which my interest would fail to be wholly absorbed. Of
course I was all wrong. From the moment when Lamorna
and Pansy started for the Continent, and the story
contrived to shake itself free of some earlier hesitations, it
had me captive. Not, I feel bound to tell you, that it is
altogether a happy or pleasant story; quite the contrary.
Most of it concerns the very real and grim trouble into
which silly Pansy contrives to plunge herself (and Lamorna)
by conduct a good deal worse than foolish. There are also
a couple of thorough-paced blackguards, the one who takes
advantage of Pansy's infatuation, and the other (to my
mind a little less credible) who would use his knowledge of
it to blackmail her friend into marriage. You will see
from this that you are not going to find Mrs. SIDGwick in
a comedy mood; and if, with me, you admire her most in
that mood, you will be sorry. But she has written nothing
more absorbing; to the last page I was in a state of
trembling doubt as to how it would all end. Also her
people, with the exceptions indicated, are just the same
sensible, level-headed human beings whom she draws so
convincingly. I shudder, for example, to suppose what the
conventional novel-heroine would have done in such a
situation as confronted Lamorna, when the cad Wigan
threatened to expose her friend unless Lamorna married
him. Being the creation of Mrs. SIDGwick, she went

Mrs. Axes (Hodder AND STOUGHTON) is a great book (and
I am not so sure it isn't, if only I had the courage to say so)
it is certainly worthy of himself at his best. There is a
merciful absence of duchesses and ultra-smart folk; the
persons concerned are a very ordinary set in a provincial
backwater, who stand on their merits as individual
characters and trade on no illusory attraction of birth or
“the movement" by which to recommend themselves to
the reader. If one's interest is intrigued by them, and
indeed it is, the credit is the author's alone. His theme is
the monotony of provincial life; but this is no bloodless
sketch of the dull existence of dull people. Their very
dulness reacts upon themselves and inevitably produces an
engrossing story without the adventitious aid of any
improbable or even momentous incident. Even the ten-
dencies to elope or cry “Wotes for women l’ bear no signs
of having been forced in order to tickle respectively the
romantic or the topical sense, but follow in natural
sequence. Mrs. Ames, the lady herself, makes a pitifukly
obvious and futile attempt to regain her first youth. I
congratulate Mr. BENson most heartily on having regained
his without any apparent effort.

| story, The Heather
| sister, Basil and Aline,
Chronicles of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (HopDER AND
Stoughton). It is published at a shilling, and I fancy
there must be many admirers of Miss KATE Douglas
WIGGIN quite ready to pay more than that for the renewed
society of her best-known heroine. Not that Rebecca,
manifold as are her excellences, is a young lady for all
tastes. Personally, I believe that in real life she would
have bored me crazy. I hate to say it, but in all her
chronicles there is to me an uneasy suggestion of the angel-
child, with limelight and appropriate music, that simply
ruins my enjoyment. This is perhaps unfair, as Rebecca
is by no means unduly virtuous and certainly does not die
in the last chapter. Still, there it is—I can't believe in her.
But those who can will certainly welcome a volume that
has all the qualities of its predecessor. I fancy it is more
particularly what would be called “the story of the play,”
as many of the chronicles—that concerning the Simpson
wedding-ring and others—I recognise as forming part of
Rebecca's stage traffic at the Globe Theatre. Very possibly
there the art of a winsome and clever little lady may
roads, should remind me of an older favourite. There is
much of the zest of BLACK's immortal Phaeton about these
motor adventures. And this is high praise.
I don't know whether the influence of pictorial posters
recommending boot polish and tooth powder and the like
has anything to do with it, but there is a rapidly growing
habit amongst publishers of supplying a portrait of a young
woman with no name underneath her as a frontispiece to
their novels. The Rat-Trap, written by “DANIEL Wood-
Roffe” and published by WERNER LAURIE, does this, and
I am still in doubt as to whether the photograph at the
beginning represents Hoya, the heroine, or somebody else.
But I like to think it is some cdy else. . . . The Rat-Trap
is a tirade against the institution of marriage, and the
argument is supported by two cases—(1) that of Captain
Macintyre, whose wife develops homicidal “mania and
nearly puts out one of the gallant soldier's eyes, and (2)
that of the mother of Hoya, who makes an unfortunate
second match with a scoundrelly adventurer. Captain

chosen such very ex-
treme instances; but I
am inclined to answer
authors of popular
| motor-novels, and incidentally the foiled villains of this par-
ticular tale, must have been for the versatile originals of the
caricature the greatest possible fun. Even their personal
appearance is mildly burlesqued, and the photographs that,
taken together, “were considered by publishers to help the
sale of their books.” This is all the most excellent and
disarming play; and, if only for the sake of it, I wish I
could add that the story it adorns is equal to others that I
have enjoyed from the same pens. Honestly, I don't quite
think this. The characters seem affected by that un-
certainty of line which is characteristic of moonlight effects.
Barrie, the young girl who is taken over Scotland in a
touring-car; Somerled, her host and lover; the actress-
mother, of whom she is in search, are all a little shadowy.
Moreover, the necessity of changing, in various parts, from
the third to the first person produces (if I may fall naturally
into an appropriate metaphor) an alteration of gear which
effects the even running of the plot with an awkward jar.
And smooth-going is a characteristic that I have long
learned to associate with the WILLIAMSON make of motor-
story. But, though I confess to have been a little dis-
appointed with the intrigue, about the setting, the little
lightning sketches of places and scenery, there is certainly
no diminution in skill. It was perhaps inevitable that

How To BRIGHTEN Football.
WITH the opening of the Football season those restless
and enterprising spirits who have been agitating for exten-
sive reforms in connection with first-class cricket are
turning their attention to the winter game, Present-day
Association football, they maintain, does not fully satisfy
the modern passion for exciting spectacle, and its extra-
ordinary popularity will quickly wane unless changes are
introduced in time. Selections from the large correspon-
dence on the subject received by Mr. Punch are given
below:—
“. . . . Something must be done quickly if soccer is to
retain its hold upon the popular imagination. At one of
the First League matches last Saturday afternoon only
31264 paid for admission—a decrease of no less than 2 per
cent, on the numbers present at the corresponding game
last year! These are eloquent figures. f
I suggest that three balls should be employed simul-
taneously, coloured respectively red, white and blue. This
simple expedient would enormously enhance the spectacular
value of the sport, Of course three Referees and six Lines-
men would be engaged. . . .” • , , . --
“. . . What is wrong with football? Simply that not
enough goals are scored. The width between the goal-
posts should be doubled, or, better still, trebled. With
fifteen players a side, five of whom must be goalkeepers
(to prevent goals becoming really monotonous), I venture
to assert, Sir, that the popularity of the game would go
up by leaps and bounds. . . .” … . . . . . . ;- -
..". . . Football must be progressive or it will inevitably
decline. I make three suggestions— . . . . . . . . . . . .
1—Abolish the present method of remunerating players
by a regular wage, and substitute a system by which pay-
ments are made to the winning side only. . . . . . . . . .
-2.—Do away with most of the present ludicrous restric-
tions regarding fouls. - 5 , :- - - - - º:
3.—Permit fresh players to be substituted at any time for
those injured. . . .” * * * - - - - - - : " " '
“. . . Let every player be compelled to wear 4-oz. boxing
gloves and be allowed to employ them while the match is
in progress under the usual regulations applying to pugilistic
contests, and we should hear no more of the decline of
football. . . .” - .* - - :--
“. . . We must revive something of the old gladiatorial
spirit. `When a man is bowled over, let the spectators
turn their thumbs up or down as their sympathies direct.
If the verdict is against the fallen one, let the victor jump
This would delight the crowd
without hurting anyone, since footballers would be trained
to stand this kind of thing. . . .” • * * * ,
| “... There are not wanting signs that football is already
beginning to lose its grip. A friend of mine who has
followed the game closely for twelve years absented himself
from an important match a week ago in order to attend a
Church Bazaar ! Why not substitute for the present
|leather ball a stout empty tin can 2 The game would then
become more thrilling, more noisy and more dangerous,
nºn
and therefore more attractive to the general public, ...”.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SILLY SEASON
POLITICS.
MINISTERs are nothing if not imita-
tive, and Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL's
exhilarating excursion into the domain
of constitutional reconstruction has
already provoked spirited competition
on the part of his colleagues. We
append a brief report of the latest of
these efforts, with the comments of
The Daily Times and The Westminster
Gazette:–
Mr. SYDNEY Buxton, speaking at
Poplar last Friday, devoted the earlier
part of his speech to the Home Rule Bill
and the noblepersistence of Mr. Asquith
in securing justice for Ireland. It was,
he said, largely the work of one man—
tunnels may prove the true solution
of the Irish question. In any case
Tubular Federalism is not outside the
range of practical politics.
The Westminster Gazette remarks that
nothing could be better than the stimu-
lating and suggestive speech delivered
by Mr. BUxTon to his constituents. We
confess, continues The Westminster, that
ye find it rather startling to conceive
of the linking up of our dominions by
this gigantic system of trans-oceanic
tunnels. But as President of the
Board of Trade, Mr. BUxTon must
have counted the cost, and, dismissing
financial considerations, we are fully
convinced that we rely too much on sea
traffic. It is of the first importance
that the difficulties should be probed,
were worth. But he was firmly per-
suaded that in this way alone they
would be able to stave off for ever the
nightmare of universal conscription.
The Daily Times, commenting on
Lord HALDANE's speech, congratulates
him on his generous attitude to Colonel
SEELY. Such incidents, it remarks,
redeem the squalor of politics and
appeal to the nobler instincts of
humanity. The idea of village uni-
versities is altogether charming, though
perhaps some time must elapse before
a Professor at Little Peddlington can
hope to attain the prestige attaching
to a Fellowship at All Souls.
The Westminster Gazette cannot find
words to express its delight at the
epoch-making suggestion of Lord
HALDANE, or his masterly
a man of superb brain,
dauntless courage, great
classical attainments and
wonderful equanimity
in the bunker-play of
politics. But the work of
Imperial reconciliation
could not be achieved
without improving our
communications — not-
ably by submarine tun-
nels. He was convinced
that the stability of the
Empire would never be
secured until we had not
only a Channel tunnel,
but a tunnel from Holy-
head to Kingstown, from
Fishguard to Rosslare,
from Galway to Halifax,
from Vancouver to Hong
Kong, from Colombo to
the Cape, and from Bom-
bay to Sydney. (A

NEY” and laughter.) Mr.

discretion in refraining
from committing his col-
leagues. Yet the scheme,
The Westminster owns,
inspires some misgivings
as to its feasibility. Lord
HALDANE speaks of far-
mers as professors and
labourers as lecturers.
But who are left to be the
undergraduates ? This
difficulty, however, might
be easily overcome by
importing them from the
towns, from the older
universities, or from the
congested districts of Ire-
land. The question of
endowment may be safely
left to the resourcefulness
of the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER. There
remains the thorny ques-
tion of University repre-
sentation. But these are
PHEASANT | ''
BUxToN then dealt at length with the
humanizing influence of tunnels, the
charm of their “dim religious light,” the
relief which they afforded to the con-
gestion of sea traffic, and their extra-
ordinary popularity with persons who
suffer from mal de mer.
Mr. BUxTon observed in conclusion
that he was only speaking for himself,
and that he did not commit any of his
colleagues, some of whom were excellent
sailors. But he could not refrain from
broaching a suggestion which he was
firmly convinced was the only true
solution of the most pressing problems
of the hour.
The Daily Times, in a sympathetic
leading article, while admitting that
Mr. Buxton's scheme may present
some difficulties, welcomes the tone and
temper of his speech. No one can fail
to be touched, it observes, by his loyalty
to his chief or by the graceful reference
and the public mind directed to the
problem of Tubular Federation.
Lord HALDANE, addressing a great
Liberal meeting at Galashiels on Satur-
day, paid a glowing tribute to the
energy and ability of his successor.
Colonel SEELY, he declared, resembled
JULIUS CAESAR not only in his profile
but in his military genius. Turning
to the question of national efficiency,
Lord HALDANE insisted on the urgent
need of indefinitely multiplying univer-
|sities. There should be a university
not only in every city, but in every
town and every village. He would like
to see every farmer a professor, every
labourer a lecturer, every curate a vice-
chancellor. Then only would they
organise education on the true basis of
the elastic solidarity of humanity,
instead of the fissiparous foundation
of caste. (i.) He did not speak
for his colleagues; he merely threw
mere details. The great thing is the
focussing of public attention on the
problem of the diffusion of culture
among the masses.
Lord CREWE was the principal guest
at the annual dinner of the Hammer-
smith Anglo-Indian Art Club on
Thursday last and delivered a remark-
able speech. Dwelling at the outset on
administrative art, Lord CREWE said
that it had been redeemed in this
country from its damaging associations
by the exertions of one man—a man
of unparalleled dignity, urbanity and
assiduity. Mr. HARcourt, he went on,
was the ideal representative of the
picturesque mind in the picturesque
body, and he adorned the Colonial
Office no less than the Board of Works.
Turning to the question of the con-
tinuance of the peerage, Lord CREWE
observed that the Liberals had been
criticised for a too lavish distribution of

honours. He could not agree, for every
out these suggestions for what they

true Liberal deserved a dukedom. But
he admitted that in the choice of titles
the newly-created peers often showed
a singular lack of judgment. The bi-
cameral system, of which he was a
convinced adherent, was seriously
damaged by the emergence of a Lord
Bootle, a Wiscount Chowbent, or a
Marquis of Weston-super-Mare. His
experience of India had convinced him
of the need of enlivening the monotony
of noble nomenclature by the ac-
climatisation of Indian titles. In short,
il faut Orientaliser la noblesse. He
believed that a Begum of Bristol, a
Nizam of Norwich or a Maharajah of
Melton Mowbray would not only add
to the picturesqueness of life but help
to perpetuate the hereditary principle.
He had not consulted his colleagues, he
made the suggestion entirely off his
own bat, but he was persuaded that
unless it was promptly earried into
effect the Triple Entente was doomed.
The Daily Times, in its third leader
on “The Ethics of Eulogy,” warmly
commends Lord CREwB for his pane-
gyric of Mr. HARcourt. The sphere
of art, remarks our contemporary, is
happily still uninvaded by politics, and,
viewed from an aesthetic standpoint,
Mr. HARcourt is a great national asset.
Coming from so well-groomed a states-
man as Lord CREwe, the tribute is a
fine instance of laudari a laudato. . . .
The importation of Indian titles advo-
cated by Lord CREwB shows imagina-
tion, enterprise, and a love of colour—
qualities which make for vitality. The
debt we owe to Lord CREwe is akin
to that we owe to the Russian Ballet
—to all, in a word, who embroider life.
The Westminster Gazette observes
that the zeal and industry shown by
Lord CREwe at the India. Office have
not in any way weakened his grip on
politics as a whole. His illuminating
suggestion for the revision of titles will
be enthusiastically welcomed by all
good Radicals, and may prove a most
effectual means of conciliating the dis-
content of extremists. The question of
precedence no doubt presents difficul-
ties, but they are not insuperable. We
can never forget that Lord CREwe is a
poet and the son of a poet.

OLD FRIENDS.
“IT was very nice of you to invite
me to give you lunch,” I said, “and if
only the waiter would bring the toast
I should be perfectly happy. I can't
say more.”
“Why not?” said Miss Middleton,
looking up. “Oh, I see.”
“And now,” I said, when I had
finished my business with a sardine,
“tell me all about it. I know some-
thing serious must have brought you
What is it 2. Have
yóu run away from home?”
Miss Middleton nodded. “Sir
Henery,” she added dramatically,
“waits for me in his yacht at Dover.
My parents would not hear of the
marriage, and immured me in the spare
room. They tried to turn me against
my love, and told wicked stories about
him, vowing that he smoked five non-
throat cigarettes in a day. Er—would
you pass the pepper, please?”
“Go on,” I begged. “Never mind
the pepper.” -
“But of course I really came to see
you,” said Miss Middleton briskly.
“I want you to do something for me.”
“I knew it.”
“Oh, do say you'd love to.”
I drained my glass and felt very brave.
“I'd love to,” I said doubtfully.
“At least, if I were sure that—” I
lowered my voice: “Look here—have
I got to write to anybody?”
“No,” said Miss Middleton.
“Let me know the worst. Have
I—er—have I got to give advice to
anybody?”
“ No.” -
There was one other point that had
to be settled. I leant across the table
anxiously.
“Have I got to ring anybody up on
the telephone 2 " I asked in a hoarse
whisper.
“Oh, nothing like that at all,” said
Miss Middleton.
“Dash it,” I cried, “then of course
I'll do anything for you. What is it?
Somebody you want killed? I could
kill a mayor to-day.”
Miss Middleton was silent for a
moment while allowing herself to be
helped to fish. When the waiters had
moved away, “We are having a jumble
sale,” she announced.
I shook my head at her.
“Your life,” I said, “is one constant
round of gaiety.”
“And I thought as I was coming to
London I'd mention it to you. Because
you're always saying you don't know
what to do with your old things.”
“I’m not alu'ays saying it. I may
have mentioned it once or twice when
“Well, mention it now, and then I'll
mention my jumble sale.” -
I thought it over for a moment.
“It will mean brown paper and
string,” I said hopelessly, “and I don't
know where to get them.”
“I’ll buy some after lunch for you.
You shall hold my hand while I buy it.”
“And then I should have to post it,
and I'm rotten at posting things.”
“But you needn't post it, because
you can meet me at the station with it,
and I'll take it home.”
“I don't think it's quite etiquette
for a young girl to travel alone with a
big brown-paper parcel. What would
Mrs. Middleton say if she knew?"
“Mother?” cried Miss Middleton.
“But, of course, it's her idea. You
didn't think it was mine?” she said
reproachfully.
“The shock of it unnerved me for a
moment. Of course I see now that it
is Mrs. Middleton's jumblesaleentirely.”
I sighed and helped myself to salt.
“How do I begin?”
“You drive me to my dressmaker
and leave me there and go on to your
rooms. And then you collect a few
really old things that you don't want
and tie them up and meet me at
the 4.40. I'm afraid,” she said frankly,
“it is a rotten way of spending an
afternoon; but I promised mother.”
My parcel and I arrived promptly to
time. Miss Middleton didn't. .
“Don’t say I've caught the wrong
train,” she said breathlessly, when at
last she appeared. “It does go at 4.40,
doesn't it 2 ”
“It does,” I said, “and it did.”
“Then my watch must be slow.”
“Send it to the jumble sale,” I
advised. “Look here—we've a long
time to wait for the next train; let's
undress my parcel in the waiting-room,
and I'll point out the things that really
want watching. Some are absolutely
unique.”
It was an odd collection of very dear
friends, Miss Middleton's final reminder
having been that nothing was too old
for a jumble sale.
“Lot One,” I said. “A photograph
of my house cricket eleven, framed in
oak. Very interesting. The lad on the
extreme right is now a clergyman.”
“Oh, which is you?” said Miss
Middleton eagerly.
I was too much wrapped up in my
parcel to answer. “Lot Two,” I went
on, “A pink-and-white football shirt;
would work up into a dressy blouse for
adult, or a smart overcoat for child.
Lot Three. A knitted waistcoat; could
be used as bath-mat. Lot Four. Pair
of bedroom slippers in holes. This bit
is the slipper; the rest is the hole. Lot
good. Truthful Jane—my first prize at
my Kindergarten.”
“Mother is in luck. It's just the
sort of things she wants,” said Miss
Middleton.
“Her taste is excellent. Lot Siac.
A pair of old grey flannel trousers.
Lot Seven. Lot Seven forward. Where
are you?” I began to go through the
things again. “Er—I'm afraid Lot
Seven has already gone.” -
“What about Lot Eight?”
“There doesn't seem to be a Lot
Eight either. It's very funny; I'm ||
sure I started with more than this.
Some of the things must have eaten |
each other.”
“Oh, but this is heaps.
really spare them all?”
“I should feel honoured if Mrs.
Middleton would accept them,” I said
with a bow. “Don't forget to tell her
that in the photograph the lad on the
extreme right ” I picked up the
photograph and examined it more
carefully. “I say, I look rather jolly,
don't you think? I wonder if I have
another copy of this anywhere.” I
gazed at it wistfully. “That was my
first year for the house, you know.”
“Don’t give it away,” said Miss
Middleton suddenly. “Keep it.”
“Shall I? I don't want to deprive
Well, I think I will if you don't mind.”
My eyes wandered to the shirt. “I’ve
had some fun in that in my time,” I
said thoughtfully. “The first time I
wore it—”
“You really oughtn't to give away
your old colours, you know.”
“Oh, but if Mrs. Middleton,” I
began doubtfully—“at least, don't you
—what?—oh, all right, perhaps I
won't.” I put the shirt on one side
with the photograph, and picked up the
dear old comfy bedroom slippers. I
considered them for a minute and then I
sighed deeply. As I looked up I caught
Miss Middleton's eye. . . . I think she
had been smiling.
“About theslippers,” she said gravely.
Can you
“Good-bye,” I said to Miss Middleton.
“It's been jolly to see you.” I grasped
my parcel firmly as the train began to
move. “I’m always glad to help Mrs.
Middleton, and if ever I can do so again
be sure to let me know.”
“I will,” said Miss Middleton.
The train went out of the station,
and my parcel and I looked about for a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN THE DEPTHS.
A week or so ago NordicA was
exasperating her less fortunate sisters
by withholding from an interviewer
the name of the fluid which, poured
into her bath, has the double effect of
invigorating her system and reducing
her weight. But the Divine SARAH,
the only BERNHARDT (whose motto, it
was once said, was grace before meat),
has no such niggardly ways. SARAH
tells all. To an interviewer of The
P. M. G. she has divulged the secret of
that youth which is still so buoyant
and effervescent at sixty-eight—and in a
word it is shrimps or, in the language
of SARAH's own country, crevettes.
Think of it—the humblest denizen of
the deep thus selected for the privilege
of keeping this wonderful lady ever
young! No wonder shrimps are a little
above themselves.
News travels fast in these days of
scientific ingenuity, and already a mass
meeting of indignation has been held in
one of the ocean's most commodious
grottos.
The chair was taken by a venerable
oyster, who had visited SARAH's friend,
CLARKSoN, for the occasion, and was
wearing a very handsome new beard.
He was selected to preside, he said,
because oysters were notoriously the
chief piscine stimulant. (Question.)
Very well, then, why was Colonel
| Roosevelt so powerful and magnetic?
Because he came from Oyster Bay.
(Laughter and cheers.) But now that
the news had gone forth to the world
that a shrimp diet was the vivifying
medium of the greatest tragédienne,
where would oysters be? The thing
was a scandal. (Hear, hear.)
Followed a prawn, who darkly sug-
gested foul play. What he wanted to
know was, What did SARAH really eat?
Because, of course, she had put forward
the shrimp merely as a blind. (Sen-
sation.) He also wanted to know what
was the nature of the hold which the
shrimp evidently had on that weak,
confiding woman. (Renewed sensation.)
| If a shrimp contained the elements of
vitality, which was possible, how much
more must a prawn contain them,
which was certain. For prawns were
the perfected article, of which shrimps
were merely the 'prentice work, the
bald scenario, to borrow a phrase from
SARAH's vocabulary. (Loud cheers.)
A lobster succeeded. It was ridicu-
lous, he said, for either the oyster or
the prawn to be so proud. The oyster
was a mere gulp; the prawn a minute
particle of a meal; but he, the lobster,
was a meal in himself. He nourished.

black and active, could have any notion
how irresistibly attractive he looked,
quiescent and appetising, in panoply of
alluring scarlet on the table. (Shudders.)
When he first heard the news about
the shrimp he laughed. He couldn't
help it; he laughed. (Applause.)
Afteran impassioned eulogy of himself
by the sole, who claimed in his capacity
of the poulet of the sea to be the most
constant and trustworthy friend and
invigorator of ailing man, the shrimp
was called upon to explain and apologise.
He pleaded not guilty. It was not his
fault, he urged, that the great lady had
chosen him as her elixir vitae. He
personally cared nothing about the
possession of such properties. He knew
he was tasty, but he had no notion that
he was sovran against Time's ravages.
He had not yet got over the discovery;
he trusted, so honourable a career as a
concomitant of trippers' teas, it was
a startling experience to find oneself
a rejuvenator of genius. He was, of
course, sorry that any deed of his, how-
ever unconscious, should put the noses
of his august relatives out of joint; but
he declined to bear any responsibility.
It was not he that should be arraigned,
but SARAH ; and SARAH had, he be-
lieved, never yet played Undine, and
therefore probably could not manage
to keep any submarine appointment
for more than a few seconds. (Dissatis-
faction.)
The sense of the meeting being
taken, it was found that the shrimp

serious consideration, and that great

And azure socks on,
You looked absurdly young to be

And we who ailed from mal-de-mer
Would strive to strike a jaunty air
And smile defiance
On one who searched with youthful zest
For any ill on which to test
His new-learn'd science.
So, while your log-book scarcely named
Our paltry woes, another claimed
A larger section,
A damsel, slightly overstrung,
Whose malady was either lung
Or heart affection.
Maybe the ailment was not such
As might have brought you into touch
Was not the sort of case that needs
A page or so in doctors' screeds,
E.g., The Lancet.
Yet every day—a trumpet press'd
About the purlieus of her chest—
Would find you gleaning
The secret of a maid's decline
And give a phrase like 99
A deeper meaning.
And, since you found among the
crew
No case of sleeping sickness, sprue
Or plague (bubonic),
You had the livelong day to twist
Your fingers round a throbbing wrist
Or give her tonic.
And, as I watch the eager face
With which you choose a pillow's
place,
A rug's position,
Or hear amid my doze the sound
Of whisper'd talk, I know she's

The right physician.
There may be passengers who hate
Your jocund ways, and roundly rate
who call it flirting and deride
The hours you dally at her side,
The way you fan her;
But things are seldom what they

And I am quite prepared to deem
The motive higher;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN EXPERIMENT IN ENTENTE.
THE thing belongs to what I call the
aftermath period of Grierson's holiday.
As a rule, Grierson spends his summer
vacations at Sheringham, playing golf.
This year, however, a spirit of adven-
ture drew him as far afield as Paris-
Plage, a seaside resort situated (as is
well known) upon the continent of
Europe. That he occupied himself
there precisely as he would have done
at Sheringham has no bearing upon
the issue. Grierson's holiday finished
about a fortnight ago; and the after-
math began, naturally enough, after-
wards. .
The first outward manifestation of it
appears to have been that, in sym-
pathies and general outlook, Grierson
suddenly became more
pointed towards an approaching group
of rustics.
“We should almost certainly be late
for lunch,” I said. I may mention
that we were walking over to partake
of that meal with the Traverses who
live at Churchover Hall. But Grier-
son did not heed.
“Parbleu !” he exclaimed suddenly
in some excitement. “But of course!
these children give us the very material.
The experiment shall be made at this
moment. Attendez l’’
Removing his soft hat and holding
it in his hand, he advanced upon the
foremost of the approaching group.
“Pardon, mes amis,” said Grierson,
bowing elaborately, with the demeanour
of a French character in mid-Victorian
farce, “woulez-vous bien nous diriger,
cried Grierson, shrugging his shoulders
and contorting himself like a lunatic.
(Secretly I knew he was delighted at
this proof of his contention.) “Je suis
Français, et j'ai perd 3 y
“Monsieur !” said a quiet and ex-
quisitely modulated voice, speaking in
the purest accent of the Quai d'Orsai.
Perhaps I ought myself to have been
more on the look-out and so have
warned Grierson. As it was, the first
intimation we had of the stranger's
approach was when we spun round
suddenly to confront a young man on
horseback, who had reined up and was
watching Grierson's antics with obvious
bewilderment.
“If I can be of any assistance,” he
said in French, “pray command me!”
With many humorists Grierson has
an almost morbid horror
French than you would
suppose possible.
Friends who returned on
the same boat report
that he expressed him-
self during the voyage
as though apprehensive
lest the vessel should
overshoot our insignifi-
cant island altogether.
English cooking was a
subject that (he declared)
made him shudder. His
usual neatly-knotted tie
gave place to floppy
bows of a kind supposed
erroneously to be Gallic;
and for some days his
attempts to reproduce a
chansomette heard in Bou-
logne occasioned consid-
erable anxiety to his wife

them for better things.

then it was suggested
that a week-end in the country, with
an intelligent but not too exciting
friend, might be beneficial, which ex-
plains how Grierson and I came to find
ourselves last Sunday in the depths of
Warwickshire; and what happened.
“Talking of the French,” said Grier-
son (he had been doing so during our
whole walk, in spite of determined
efforts to head him off), “one thing
that must strike the intelligent ob-
server is their kindly courtesy towards
foreigners who try to make themselves
understood. But do you think for a
moment that the same is true on our
side of the Channel ?”
“I never think about it for a moment
one way or the other.”
“Suppose, for example, that we were
two Frenchmen, entirely ignorant of
the English language, who wanted now
to ask our way to the next village.
How do you imagine we should be
s'il vous platt 2 Nous avons perdu notre

Naturally the children had halted,
and now stood regarding Grierson with
round-eyed amazement. The elders
seemed to hesitate between derision
and alarm, but said nothing. The baby
began to howl.
“Comme j'ai vous dit,” said Grierson
in a triumphant aside to me. “Petits

the children again he added, speaking
very slowly and with elaborate em-
phasis, “Nous me parlons pas Anglais.

No answer. The tallest girl, finding
Grierson's expressive glance upon her,
giggled nervously.

AT THE PLAY.
“THE GREAT John GANTON."
If the manners of the Golf Club
where the recent American Champion-
ship took place were anything like the
exhibition given at the “Chicago Golf
Club” in the Aldwych play, I can well
understand how one of our British re-
presentatives was beaten and the other
broke down. ... I myself was almost
tempted to retire, so loudly did the
members discuss matters that are never
vented in a decent club, so strangely
did they behave in the presence of
ladies," so familiarly was the waiter
addressed. Indeed, on all its social
side the play was distinguished by an
astonishing crudity. . . . . . . . . .
But this feature was only an inci-
dental adjunct to the main scheme of

the author, Mr. HARTLY J. MANNERs,
which was to present a picture of the
business methods of a typical Chicago
pork-packer, American finance being
just now a theatrical vogue. And in
Mr. GEORGE FAwcETT he had the ideal
thing. Mr. FAwcETT can do whatever
he likes with his perfect gift of a face.
He can fold his eyes or his lips into all
sorts of creases. His manner is best
adapted for coping with tough business
propositions, but he had his moments of
sentiment. Even in a tragic situation
I think he could always be saved from
excessive mouthing by his pleasant
capacity for saying things with his lips
shut. - -
It is a pity that he was not supported
“English accent” and bearing of the
majority lent an air of improbability to
the picture. Indeed Mr. FAwcETT had
to carry the whole play on his one
pair of stooping shoulders. Mr. ERIC
MATURIN, even allowing for his alleged
Harvard training, never began to be
credible as the son of such a father.
He was hopelessly British to the bone.
The slouching angularity which is char-
acteristic of his methods and served him
well enough as a casual philanderer in
Love—and what then Žhere gave astrong
note of insincerity both to his serious
love-making and to the lofty professions
which the author attributed to him.
*Miss LAURA’ CowIE was the very
pretty girl of his choice—gentle when
gentleness was asked of her, but a
veritable tigress in her attack upon
the iniquities' of the great John Ganton.
I. should have liked to see her in a
burlesque of her own part, for she has
a very nice gift of humour for which
there was no opening here, all the good
º, things being closely reserved for Mr.
Fawcett. 3, Miss Cowie is new to
modern drama, and I think her training
in the Shakspearean school has made
her enunciation perhaps a little too
conscientious for this style of thing.
Miss MABEL, TREvoR, who played the
part of a flighty wife, deserved some-
thing better than the raw stuff she was
given for dialogue." Of the rest I can
find nothing very kind to say, though
Mr. EARLE BRowNE may perhaps have
ranted more successfully behind the
scenes, where a lot of cryptic business
went on in connection with a strike, of
which the issue was never confided
to us. . . . - -
I wish I could believe more heartily
in the author's honesty of motive. He
was constantly declaiming against
graft and other discreditable devices of
American commerce, but, when the
arch-offender, John, Ganton, finding
his end near (for the horse-medicine he
got from a vet. had done him no good),
became reconciled to his son, and
bequeathed his business to him, with
the earnest recommendation that he
should conduct it on the old detestable
lines, everybody, including the re-
formers, seemed perfectly content. And,
while Mr. MANNERs professed to be
shocked at the brutality shown by the
employer to his workmen, he could not
resist the vulgar temptation to throw
a lot of cheap ridicule on the parson
who was concerned to improve their
condition. - - . .
If Mr. MANNERs' play is to be a
success (which I gravely doubt, for the
audience was very sparse when I
attended, and much of the commercial
jargon must have been over its heads)
would be the making of MANNERs.

There is an artless innocence about
the theatrical profession which is really
quite lovable. Mr. H. W. Esmond's so-
called comedy might have annoyed us
if he had been an author-playwright,
but because he is an actor-playwright
we all found his ingenuousness rather
touching. “The dear to think this

THE BINDWEED.
THE last blade of my wife's pen-
knife—but, anyhow, her birthday comes
next week—went with a snap in my
hand, and the pail beside me was about
full of little white wriggly things, like
spaghetti that want dusting; and I had
cleared at least a square yard of our
lawn. So I stopped to report progress
and lit a fresh pipe. Then I sat down
to work it out. It came out like this:–
Dimension of lawn, say, 30×20 yds.
=600 sq. yds.
(It isn't really quite so much, but
there's the bit that goes down cross-
wise beyond the gooseberry beds that
I can't be bothered to measure.)
Time occupied in clearing 1 sq. yd.
=2 hrs. 20 min.
Approximate cost (1 penknife 2s. 6d.,
damage to trouser-knees 3s.), 5s. 6d.
... Time to be occupied in clearing
whole lawn (in hours)=2} x600=
1400–19 days of 8 hours=175 days.
Cost of clearing lawn (in shillings)=
5 x 600–3300=4,165.
I am a patient man, but I have to
earn my living. I decided to consult
a gardening book.
It said as follows:–
BINDweed (Convolvulus): This is one
of the most noxious and troublesome
growths that can infest a garden—
(Hear, hear ! but I should have put it
more strongly)—“Half-measures are no
use; the weed must be eradicated at all
costs.” (£165 in my case.) “Every
vestige of its roots must be eliminated
from the soil and burnt, as once it has
begun to spread it is exceedingly hardy.”
I flung the book down and returned
to the garden. Over the wall I could
hear my neighbour's gardener panting
over the geraniums. I stood on the
cucumber-frame (avoiding the glass as
much as possible) and shouted to him.
“Hi! I say, can you by any chance
tell me the best thing to do with

“Dig't oop an' burn't,” he said.
“It's all over my lawn, you see,” I

“Well, if I were to dig the whole

“Well, it's killing all the grass.”
“Ah, 'twould.” With that he re-
sumed his panting and I retired.

OUR COLONIES.
NoTE.—Owing to the amazing in-
difference which the average Briton
displays concerning our possessions
beyond the seas, we publish the follow-
ing essays in the hope of quickening
his interest and convincing him that
truth is stranger than the fiction which
is so lavishly supplied by the Colonial
author.
I.—SouTH AFRICA.
South Africa (or Zuid Afrika, as it is
termed by the People Who Really
Matter) is situated in the lower half of
the Dark Continent. You could drop
the whole of England in several corners
of it, and the chances are that she
would be floated as a Gold Mining
Proposition one of these days, and
there would be considerable difficulty in
raising the authorised capital.
The inhabitants of South Africa (or
Zuid Afrika) are divided into two
distinct classes—Dutch and Jews, and
the former are inclined to look down
on the latter in the most offensive
manner. To the hardy, simple-minded
farmer, the Jew is of no consequence,
except to keep that hot-bed of iniquity,
Johannesburg, flourishing ; also to
manage the gold mines, and pay the
taxes, and support charitable institu-
tions, and keep the country going, and
pay the salaries of the Ministers, and
establish Land Banks, and buy his
farm when he has no further use for
it, and a few unimportant matters
like that. The hardy, simple-minded
farmer does not care for the rush of
modern civilisation, but prefers to sit
on the stoep of his house, smoking a
large calabash pipe and drinking coffee
made from burnt meal and chicory.
Hustling is repugnant to him, and he
holds that it is wicked to interfere with
the decrees of Providence in any way,
if such interference necessitates any
work on his own part.
The most important industries in
South Africa (or Zuid Afrika) are con-
nected with mining. It will come as a
shock to British investors to learn that
most of the revenue of South Africa (or
Zuid Afrika) is derived from the gold
mines in the Transvaal; but such is the
case. Johannesburg is the centre of
the gold-mining industry, yet it doesn't
seem a bit ashamed of itself. It is a
very large and very dusty town, and is
principally inhabited by people who
are trying to escape from it. Every
month something like £1,236,745 worth
of gold is worked out of the mines
round Johannesburg, but it is not all
profit. £1,000,000 may be described as
working costs; £236,000 goes to the
Government in one way or another;
the odd £45 is available for distribution
among European shareholders.
The favourite recreations of the
country are shooting, cricket and com-
pany-promoting. There are lots of
things to shoot, though, if you shot
the things that deserved it most, you
would probably be hanged. The correct
way to go shooting is to hire an ox-
wagon, several natives, some guides,
many dogs and a tent, and then buy
some licences. With a little care
you can procure quite a lot of
licences for a paltry £100 or so.
Thus equipped, you trek off towards
the distant horizon, and keep on till
you are out of sight of town. In a
week or two you may come back and
write a book about it.
Company-promoting combines all
the pleasures and excitements of the
chase with a prospect of substantial
profit. It is very popular in and near
Johannesburg, but, owing to the diffi-
dence of the European investor, is not
the game it used to be.
South Africa (or Zuid Afrika) is
cursed with many plagues, the best
known of which are the locust, the
mealie grub, scab in sheep and the
bi-lingual problem. The locust is being
scientifically exterminated by means of
arsenic; the mealie grub is made un-
happy by a diet of strychnine; scab in
sheep is under discussion in the local
parliament; but the bi-lingual problem
is allowed to flourish unchecked.
South Africa (or Zuid Afrika) is
popularly supposed to have been dis-
covered by a gentleman named VAN
RIEBEEK in the seventeenth century.
Great Britain began to discover it
during the Boer War. When the dis-
covery was complete, the country was
handed back to the original inhabitants
with as little delay as possible. And no
wonder.

THE COMPACT.
“PATHos?” he said. “I'll tell you
something pathetic. When I was at
Bart.'s I had a great friend, another
student, named Lewin. That was, let
me see, more than forty years ago. We
were both devoted to music; I played
the violin, he the 'cello; and we spent
a great deal of time at the opera.
When we were through I stayed on
for a while as H. P., and Lewin went
on a P. & O. boat as ship's doctor, and
taking a fancy to the East remained
out there. Well, when we parted on
the night before he sailed, we made an
undertaking that whenever we next
met, and at all our future meetings,
each of us would greet the other ;
whistling the opening notes of BEE-
THovKN's eighth symphony. You know
“Well,” he continued, “when we
made that promise we expected to
meet often, for he had then no notion
of settling in Japan. But settle he
did, and he came back to England for
the first time only last week. I had
heard from him now and then, and a
brief letter came the other day an-
nouncing his arrival and asking me to
dine with him at his hotel. ‘Come up
to my room,” he added. So I went.
He was on the top floor, and as I
approached his room a chambermaid
came along and told me he was there
and the door had been left open for me.
Just as I put my hand to the knob
I recollected our old agreement and,
standing on the door-mat, I began to
whistle. Funny I should have for-
gotten it till I was so near him; but I
had. - -
He made no response, but, hearing
him moving about inside, I repeated it
louder. Again he did not respond; so
I pushed the door open and marched in
in full blast, like a drum and fife band.
He ran to grasp my hand, shook it
warmly and thrust me into a chair.
“But why didn't you whistle too?' I
asked him. He looked at me blankly
for a moment and then fetched an ear-
trumpet from the table. He had be-,
come almost totally deaf.” -

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE seems to be something in the air of the United
States which infects everyone, natives and visitors alike,
with the scribbling-itch. The only Americans who are not
writing plays are those who are writing historical novels;
and the only Englishmen who have never written their
impressions of America are those who have never been
there. All these impressions fall into two classes—the
bright, where you devote a chapter to a description of how
they brought you ice-water at your hotel instead of cleaning
your boots; and the solid, where you put your head on one
side with a thoughtful frown, and say, “What is the
future of this great country?” Mr. J. NELSON FRASER's
America, Old and New (OUSELEY) belongs to the second
class, and, if it tends to a certain heaviness in parts, has, at
any rate, the merit that the author's attitude towards the
country is not that of a visitor to a freak-show. I have
read very few books on America by English authors so free
from prejudice. Mr. FRASER was six months in the States,
and he seems to have “done" them with the furious
energy of the American tourist in England, who takes in
Westminster Abbey in the morning, Stratford-on-Avon in
the afternoon, and catches the night boat to Calais after
dining at the Cheshire Cheese. There is something
positively snipe-like in the way in which he dodges from
San Francisco to New York and from New York to
Virginia. I am bound to admit, however, that hurry did
not impair his powers of observation. The book is packed
with interesting facts, some the ordinary stereo of American
travel, others fresher and less obvious. Occasionally the
sobriety of it is lightened by a mild jest, as, for instance,
“The American policeman considers his fellow-subjects as
‘clubbable' persons in quite another light from that in-
is very much in earnest. As the result of a brief visit, the
book is something of a feat; but I am not yet satisfied that
I have been told all there is to tell of the United States.
After all, America is quite a sizeable little place, and a
man might stay in it longer than six months without
exhausting its points of interest.
Admirers of the precocious and exuberant talent of the
authoress of The Viper of Milan will find in The Rake's
Progress (RIDER) much for their delectation in an
eighteenth-century setting of spinets and sconces, masks
and patches, dice and duels. My lord Lyndwood, rake,
gambler and son of a gambler, is all but in the clutches
of the bailiffs, when Marius, his younger brother, returns
from abroad, having fallen sadly in love with an unknown
fair. In order to save his house and the romance and
career of his brother, the Earl sells himself to a rich
merchant for the fat bribe which goes with that gross
worthy's daughter. When the new Countess proves no
other than Marius's charmer, you may expect complications,
which you duly get. The heartless Lyndwood has two other
charming ladies honourably and romantically in love with
him, but contrives to be as great a spendthrift of the finer
things of life as of the shekels of his tradesman father-in-
law. It is a vigorous, twopenny-coloured portrait of the
insolent, “rake-helly” aristocrat of the times, who is
fittingly pinked in a casual brawl, and taken to his house,
which the brokers promptly enter, and, by a charming
custom of the day, contrive to make a little by charging
admission to see the body. Miss BowFN has a genuine
power of visualising things, first for herself, and then for
her readers. If she sees a little too much, the “heart-
shaped flame of a candle,” for instance; or if her puppets
“press handkerchiefs” to mouth or “moisten lips" a
little too frequently, you get incident and an atmosphere,

(Liberal majority in 1910, 1234.)
The result of the Drumpattock Elec-
tion—by no means unexpected—may
at first sight appear to be a direct
condemnation of the policy of the
present Government. As such it will
no doubt be accepted by the Opposition
Press, where we may look for the usual
outbreak of jubilation, as in the case of
North-West Manchester and Mid-
lothian. Let us say at once that the
Tories are quite welcome to any satis-
faction that they may find in a cursory
and superficial examination of the
figures. We make them a present of it.
But to those who read between the
lines, to those who peer beneath the
surface, to those (like ourselves) whose
business it is to explain away this
astounding result—which was by no
means unexpected—such an interpreta-
tion will appear wide of the mark. Let
us make our meaning perfectly clear.
Whatever these figures may signify,
they do not signify any real increase in
Conservative strength in the constitu-
ency or any appreciable turn-over of
votes.
It is a simple matter to analyse the
votes, but—it should be borne in mind
-it takes an expert to analyse the ab-
stentions, upon which so much depends.
This is just where we come in. Only
79 per cent. of the electorate went to
the poll. If we add the other 21 per
cent. to the Liberal total (which, as
we shall show, we have a perfect right
to do) we have a pronounced victory

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN EXPERIMENT IN ENTENTE.
THE thing belongs to what I call the
aftermath period of Grierson's holiday.
As a rule, Grierson spends his summer
vacations at Sheringham, playing golf.
This year, however, a spirit of adven-
ture drew him as far afield as Paris-
Plage, a seaside resort situated (as is
well known) upon the continent of
Europe. That he occupied himself
there precisely as he would have done
at Sheringham has no bearing upon
the issue. Grierson's holiday finished
about a fortnight ago; and the after-
math began, naturally enough, after-
wards. .
The first outward manifestation of it
appears to have been that, in sym-
pathies and general outlook, Grierson
suddenly became more
pointed towards an approaching group
of rustics.
“We should almost certainly be late
for lunch,” I said. I may mention
that we were walking over to partake
of that meal with the Traverses who
live at Churchover Hall. But Grier-
son did not heed.
“Parbleu (" he exclaimed suddenly
in some excitement. “But of course!
these children give us the very material.
The experiment shall be made at this
moment. Attendez l’’
Removing his soft hat and holding
it in his hand, he advanced upon the
foremost of the approaching group.
“Pardon, mes amis,” said Grierson,
bowing elaborately, with the demeanour
of a French character in mid-Victorian
farce, “woulez-vous bien mous diriger,
cried Grierson, shrugging his shoulders
and contorting himself like a lunatic.
(Secretly I knew he was delighted at
this proof of his contention.) “Je suis

“Monsieur !” said a quiet and ex-
quisitely modulated voice, speaking in
the purest accent of the Quai d'Orsai.
Perhaps I ought myself to have been
more on the look-out and so have
warned Grierson. As it was, the first
intimation we had of the stranger's
approach was when we spun round
suddenly to confront a young man on
horseback, who had reined up and was
watching Grierson's antics with obvious
bewilderment.
“If I can be of any assistance,” he
said in French, “pray command me!”
With many humorists Grierson has

that a week-end in the country, with
an intelligent but not too exciting

ourselves last Sunday in the depths of
Warwickshire; and what happened.
“Talking of the French,” said Grier-
son (he had been doing so during our
whole walk, in spite of determined
efforts to head him off), “one thing
that must strike the intelligent ob-
server is their kindly courtesy towards
foreigners who try to make themselves
understood. But do you think for a
moment that the same is true on our
side of the Channel ?”
“I never think about it for a moment

“Suppose, for example, that we were

to ask our way to the next village.
How do you imagine we should be

Naturally the children had halted,
and now stood regarding Grierson with
round-eyed amazement. The elders
seemed to hesitate between derision
and alarm, but said nothing. The baby
began to howl.
“Comme j'ai vous dit,” said Grierson
in a triumphant aside to me. “Petits

the children again he added, speaking
very slowly and with elaborate em-

No answer. The tallest girl, finding

AT THE PLAY. ...,
“THE GREAT John GANToN."
If the manners of the Golf Club
where the recent American Champion-
ship took place were anything like the
exhibition given at the “Chicago Golf
Club” in the Aldwych play, I can well
understand how one of our British re-
presentatives was beaten and the other
broke down. I myself was almost
tempted to retire, so loudly did the
members discuss matters that are never
vented in a decent club, so strangely
did they behave in the presence of
ladies, so familiarly was the waiter
addressed. Indeed, on all its social
side the play was distinguished by an
astonishing crudity. . . . . - -
But this feature was only an inci-
dental adjunct to the main scheme of

A SUBTLE DISTINCTION.

the author, Mr. HARTLY J. MANNERs,
which was to present a picture of the
business methods of a typical Chicago
pork-packer, American finance being
just now a theatrical vogue. And in
Mr. GEORGE FAwcETT he had the ideal
thing. Mr. FAwcETT can do whatever
he likes with his perfect gift of a face.
He can fold his eyes or his lips into all
sorts of creases. His manner is best
adapted for coping with tough business
propositions, but he had his moments of
sentiment. Even in a tragic situation
I think he could always be saved from
excessive mouthing by his pleasant
capacity for saying things with his lips
shut. - -
It is a pity that he was not supported
“English accent” and bearing of the
majority lent an air of improbability to
the picture. Indeed Mr. Fawcett had
to carry the whole play on his one
pair of stooping shoulders. Mr. ERIC
MATURIN, even allowing for his alleged
Harvard training, never began to be
credible as the son of such a father.
He was hopelessly British to the bone.
The slouching angularity which is char-
acteristic of his methods and served him
well enough as a casual philanderer in
Love—and what then?here gave astrong
note of insincerity both to his serious
love-making and to the lofty professions
which the author attributed to him.
*Miss LAURA’ Cowie was the very
pretty girl of his choice—gentle when
gentleness was asked of her, but a
veritable tigress in her attack upon
the iniquities of the great John Ganton.
I. should have liked to see her in a
burlesque of her own part, for she has
averyºnice gift of humour for which
there was no opening here, all the good
: º, things being closely reserved for Mr.
Fawcett. - Miss Cowie is new to
modern drama, and I think her training
in the Shakspearean school has made
her enunciation perhaps a little too
conscientious for this style of thing.
Miss MABEL, TREvoR, who played the
part of a flighty wife, deserved some-
thing better than the raw stuff she was
given for dialogue. Of the rest I can
find nothing very kind to say, though
Mr. EARLE BRowNE may perhaps have
ranted more successfully behind the
scenes, where a lot of cryptic business
went on in connection with a strike, of
which the issue was never confided
to us.
I wish I could believe more heartily
in the author's honesty of motive. He
was constantly declaiming against
graft and other discreditable devices of
American commerce, but, when the
arch-offender, John Ganton, finding
his end near (for the horse-medicine he
got from a vet, had done him no good),
became reconciled to his son, and
bequeathed his business to him, with
the earnest recommendation that he
should conduct it on the old detestable
lines, everybody, including the re-
formers, seemed perfectly content. And,
while Mr. MANNERs professed to be
shocked at the brutality shown by the
employer to his workmen, he could not
resist the vulgar temptation to throw
a lot of cheap ridicule on the parson
who was concerned to improve their
condition. -
If Mr. MANNERs' play is to be a
success (which I gravely doubt, for the
audience was very sparse when I
attended, and much of the commercial
jargon must have been over its heads)
would be the making of MANNERs.

There is an artless innocence about
the theatrical profession which is really
quite lovable. Mr. H. W. Esmond's so-
called comedy might have annoyed us
if he had been an author-playwright,
but because he is an actor-playwright
we all found his ingenuousness rather
touching. “The dear to think this

still think that a box of effective stage

Readers of Kipps will remember how
and why that great dramatist, Harry
Chitterlow, introduced a beetle into his
masterpiece. There is a beetle at The
Criterion, really a funny beetle, and it
is quite possible that Mr. Esmond
built up his play around it. For the

us another screen in a flower-shop, I
am afraid I began to think that the
naïve note was being forced even
beyond Mr. Esmond's strength.
If you realise at once that “A Young

the music, you will pass an entertain-

THE BINDWEED.
THE last blade of my wife's pen-
knife—but, anyhow, her birthday comes
next week—went with a snap in my
hand, and the pail beside me was about
full of little white wriggly things, like
spaghetti that want dusting; and I had
cleared at least a square yard of our
lawn. So I stopped to report progress
and lit a fresh pipe. Then I sat down
to work it out. It came out like this:–
Dimension of lawn, say, 30×20 yds.
=600 sq. yds.
(It isn't really quite so much, but
there's the bit that goes down cross-
wise beyond the gooseberry beds that
I can't be bothered to measure.)
Time occupied in clearing 1 sq. yd.
=2 hrs. 20 min.
Approximate cost (1 penknife 2s. 6d., |
damage to trouser-knees 3s.), 5s. 6d.
... Time to be occupied in clearing
whole lawn (in hours)=2}× 600–
1400=1;º days of 8 hours=175 days.
Cost of clearing lawn (in shillings)=
5; x 600=3300=4,165.
I am a patient man, but I have to
earn my living. I decided to consult
a gardening book.
It said as follows:–
BINDweed (Convolvulus): This is one
of the most noxious and troublesome
growths that can infest a garden—
(Hear, hear ! but I should have put it
more strongly)—“Half-measures are no
use; the weed must be eradicated at all
costs.” (£165 in my case.) “Every
vestige of its roots must be eliminated
from the soil and burnt, as once it has
begun to spread it is exceedingly hardy.”
I flung the book down and returned
to the garden. Over the wall I could
hear my neighbour's gardener panting
over the geraniums. I stood on the
cucumber-frame (avoiding the glass as
much as possible) and shouted to him.
“Hi! I say, can you by any chance
tell me the best thing to do with
bindweed ?”
He looked up from his work and

“Dig't oop an' burn't,” he said.
“It’s all over my lawn, you see,” I

“Dessay 'tis,” he responded.
“Well, if I were to dig the whole

“Can't say, Sir; might be a matter

“Well, it's killing all the grass.”
“Ah, 'twould.” With that he re-
sumed his panting and I retired.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR COLONIES.
NoTE.—Owing to the amazing in-
difference which the average Briton
displays concerning our possessions
beyond the seas, we publish the follow-
ing essays in the hope of quickening
his interest and convincing him that
truth is stranger than the fiction which
is so lavishly supplied by the Colonial
author.
I.—South AFRICA.
South Africa (or Zuid Afrika, as it is
termed by the People Who Really
Matter) is situated in the lower half of
the Dark Continent. You could drop
the whole of England in several corners
of it, and the chances are that she
would be floated as a Gold Mining
Proposition one of these days, and
there would be considerable difficulty in
raising the authorised capital.
The inhabitants of South Africa (or
Zuid Afrika) are divided into two
distinct classes—Dutch and Jews, and
the former are inclined to look down
on the latter in the most offensive
manner. To the hardy, simple-minded
farmer, the Jew is of no consequence,
except to keep that hot-bed of iniquity,
Johannesburg, flourishing ; also to
manage the gold mines, and pay the
taxes, and support charitable institu-
tions, and keep the country going, and
pay the salaries of the Ministers, and
establish Land Banks, and buy his
farm when he has no further use for
it, and a few unimportant matters
like that. The hardy, simple-minded
farmer does not care for the rush of
modern civilisation, but prefers to sit
on the stoep of his house, smoking a
large calabash pipe and drinking coffee
made from burnt meal and chicory.
Hustling is repugnant to him, and he
holds that it is wicked to interfere with
the decrees of Providence in any way,
if such interference necessitates any
work on his own part.
The most important industries in
South Africa (or Zuid Afrika) are con-
nected with mining. It will come as a
shock to British investors to learn that
most of the revenue of South Africa (or
Zuid Afrika) is derived from the gold
mines in the Transvaal; but such is the
case. Johannesburg is the centre of
the gold-mining industry, yet it doesn't
seem a bit ashamed of itself. It is a
very large and very dusty town, and is
principally inhabited by people who
are trying to escape from it. Every
month something like £1,236,745 worth
of gold is worked out of the mines
round Johannesburg, but it is not all
profit. £1,000,000 may be described as
working costs; £236,000 goes to the
Government in one way or another;
the odd £45 is available for distribution
among European shareholders.
The favourite recreations of the
country are shooting, cricket and com-
pany-promoting. There are lots of
things to shoot, though, if you shot
the things that deserved it most, you
would probably be hanged. The correct
way to go shooting is to hire an ox-
wagon, several natives, some guides,
many dogs and a tent, and then buy
some licences. With a little care
you can procure quite a lot of
licences for a paltry £100 or so.
Thus equipped, you trek off towards
the distant horizon, and keep on till
you are out of sight of town. In a
week or two you may come back and
write a book about it.
Company-promoting combines all
the pleasures and excitements of the
chase with a prospect of substantial
profit. It is very popular in and near
Johannesburg, but, owing to the diffi-
dence of the European investor, is not
the game it used to be.
South Africa (or Zuid Afrika) is
cursed with many plagues, the best
known of which are the locust, the
mealie grub, scab in sheep and the
bi-lingual problem. The locust is being
scientifically exterminated by means of
arsenic; the mealie grub is made un-
happy by a diet of strychnine; scab in
sheep is under discussion in the local
parliament; but the bi-lingual problem
is allowed to flourish unchecked.
South Africa (or Zuid Afrika) is
popularly supposed to have been dis-
covered by a gentleman named WAN
RIEBEEK in the seventeenth century.
Great Britain began to discover it
during the Boer War. When the dis-
covery was complete, the country was
handed back to the original inhabitants
with as little delay as possible. And no
wonder.
THE COMPACT.
“PATHos?” he said. “I’ll tell you
something pathetic. When I was at
Bart.'s I had a great friend, another
student, named Lewin. That was, let
me see, more than forty years ago. We
were both devoted to music; I played
the violin, he the 'cello; and we spent
a great deal of time at the opera.
When we were through I stayed on
for a while as H. P., and Lewin went
on a P. & O. boat as ship's doctor, and
taking a fancy to the East remained
out there. Well, when we parted on
the night before he sailed, we made an
undertaking that whenever we next
met, and at all our future meetings,
each of us would greet the other i.
whistling the opening notes of BEE-
THovPN's eighth symphony. You know
“Well,” he continued, “when we
made that promise we expected to
meet often, for he had then no notion
of settling in Japan. But settle he
did, and he came back to England for
the first time only last week. I had
heard from him now and then, and a
brief letter came the other day an-
nouncing his arrival and asking me to
dine with him at his hotel. ‘Come up
to my room,’ he added. So I went.
He was on the top floor, and as I
approached his room a chambermaid
came along and told me he was there
and the door had been left open for me.
Just as I put my hand to the knob
I recollected our old agreement and,
standing on the door-mat, I began to
whistle. Funny I should have for-
gotten it till I was so near him; but I
had. - --
He made no response, but, hearing
him moving about inside, I repeated it
louder. Again he did not respond; so
I pushed the door open and marched in
in full blast, like a drum and fife band.
He ran to grasp my hand, shook it
warmly and thrust me into a chair.
“But why didn't you whistle too?' I
asked him. He looked at me blankly
for a moment and then fetched an ear-
trumpet from the table. He had be-,
come almost totally deaf.”

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE seems to be something in the air of the United
States which infects everyone, natives and visitors alike,
with the scribbling-itch. The only Americans who are not
writing plays are those who are writing historical novels;
and the only Englishmen who have never written their
impressions of America are those who have never been
there. All these impressions fall into two classes—the
bright, where you devote a chapter to a description of how
they brought you ice-water at your hotel instead of cleaning
your boots; and the solid, where you put your head on one
side with a thoughtful frown, and say, “What is the
future of this great country?” Mr. J. NELSON FRASER's
America, Old and New (OUSELEY) belongs to the second
class, and, if it tends to a certain heaviness in parts, has, at
any rate, the merit that the author's attitude towards the
country is not that of a visitor to a freak-show. I have
read very few books on America by English authors so free
from prejudice. Mr. FRASER was six months in the States,
and he seems to have “done" them with the furious
energy of the American tourist in England, who takes in
Westminster Abbey in the morning, Stratford-on-Avon in
the afternoon, and catches the night boat to Calais after
dining at the Cheshire Cheese. There is something
positively snipe-like in the way in which he dodges from
San Francisco to New York and from New York to
Virginia. I am bound to admit, however, that hurry did
not impair his powers of observation. The book is packed
with interesting facts, some the ordinary stereo of American
travel, others fresher and less obvious. Occasionally the
sobriety of it is lightened by a mild jest, as, for instance,
“The American policeman considers his fellow-subjects as
‘clubbable' persons in quite another light from that in-
is very much in earnest. As the result of a brief visit, the
book is something of a feat; but I am not yet satisfied that
I have been told all there is to tell of the United States.
After all, America is quite a sizeable little place, and a
man might stay in it longer than six months without
exhausting its points of interest.
Admirers of the precocious and exuberant talent of the
authoress of The Viper of Milan will find in The Rake's
Progress (RIDER) much for their delectation in an
eighteenth-century setting of spinets and sconces, masks
and patches, dice and duels. My lord Lyndwood, rake,
gambler and son of a gambler, is all but in the clutches
of the bailiffs, when Marius, his younger brother, returns
from abroad, having fallen sadly in love with an unknown
fair. In order to save his house and the romance and
career of his brother, the Earl sells himself to a rich
merchant for the fat bribe which goes with that gross
worthy's daughter. When the new Countess proves no
other than Marius's charmer, you may expect complications,
which you duly get. The heartless Lyndwood has two other
charming ladies honourably and romantically in love with
him, but contrives to be as great a spendthrift of the finer
things of life as of the shekels of his tradesman father-in-
law. It is a vigorous, twopenny-coloured portrait of the
insolent, “rake-helly” aristocrat of the times, who is
fittingly pinked in a casual brawl, and taken to his house,
which the brokers promptly enter, and, by a charming
custom of the day, contrive to make a little by charging
admission to see the body. Miss BowFN has a genuine
power of visualising things, first for herself, and then for
her readers. If she sees a little too much, the “heart-
shaped flame of a candle,” for instance; or if her puppets
“press handkerchiefs” to mouth or “moisten lips" a
little too frequently, you get incident and an atmosphere

tended by Dr. Johnson; ” but for the most part Mr. FRASER
which are plausible enough, and can contrive to pass a

Sparkes is a long story
of life below stairs;
Love at Paddington a

Miss DoRothea CoNYERs really must get out of the lost-
will habit. Sally (METHUEN) had taken us to the real
Ireland and was giving us the most delightful runs with as
odd and sporting a pack of foxhounds and others as I ever
wish to meet, and all was merry and bright, natural and
exhilarating. Then the authoress got thinking that we
were not being sufficiently excited, that we wanted (Heaven
help us!) a melodramatic interest. Out she came with
her irritating Mrs. Studdert, the snob in wrongful posses-
sion, her even more irritating Donough Clanchy, the saintly
youth and ousted heir, and her deadly “If only we could
find that will!” For myself I made short work of the
tiresome testament. Turning at once to the end, I satisfied
myself that it was, as I knew it must be, eventually found,
that Mrs. Studdert was evicted and Donough installed, and
then I read the rest of the book at my leisure, skipping a
page or two every time a reference to the will caught my
eye. And so I enjoyed it extremely, for, as well as the
sporting element and native brogue, there were “the
subsequent complications which ensued between Sally and
her various lovers ” (see cover), which, however simple and
not seem to have read
widely, he was able, by wariness, to express much by
nods, words of assent, and, as some reference escaped
Miss G. for the moment, intimating, when she secured it,
that the information had arrived to him at exactly the
same moment.” And this, of SHAKSPEARE: “‘A man I
never could stand,' remarked Cook, “so far as his writings
are concerned. Rude, I call him.’” To all who love true
humour I recommend Devoted Sparkes. Funny, I call it.

The GERMAN EMPREss, while visiting
a village school in Alsace, promised to
grant a little girl to whom she spoke
whatever she wished. The girl replied
that she would like French to be taught
in the school. Her request has now
been granted, and it is rumoured that
her father-has reproved her severely
authority. Last week, however, the
Willesden magistrates imposed a fine
of half-a-crown on a Mrs. SMITH who
chased her husband round a public park

To praise his whiskers and compare

Suit Betsey-Jane, and so fares he.

THE LETTER.
“FRANCEscA,” I said, “I have had a letter.”
“What?” said Francesca. “A letter with a pretty red
penny stamp on it, and the postmark quite illegible, so that
you couldn't guess from whom it came? Well, you are in
luck.” - -
“I did not study the postmark,” I said wearily. “Post-
marks do not interest me. I do not collect postmarks.
But, if you like, I will consult this one and find out all
about it.” - -
“Was it from your Aunt Matilda 2" said Francesca.
“No, Francesca, it was not. At least I think not. Aunt
Matilda does not deal in postmarks. She ->
“Yes, I know. Aunt Matilda deals in advice, and I
wish she wouldn't. What does she say this time?”
“Francesca,” I said, “you are unjust. Aunt Matilda
says nothing this time. She offers no advice of any kind.”
“I’ll bet she does. Hand me the letter.”
“You will lose your bet, Francesca. Aunt Matilda has
written many letters, but not this one.”
“Then why,” said Francesca, “ did you say she had 2"

“I could still,” she went on, “have smiled in the sight of

was broken because you could not remember a simple
quotation. But now concealment is useless.” She paused
and dabbed her eyes with my handkerchief. -
“Pardon me, Francesca,” I said, “the boot is on the

and all the smiling has got to be done by me. Francesca,

that goes on is unbelievable. But there
is no malice in it; it is just shear fun.
In addition to sheep, there are vast
herds of cattle, which are always tended
by gentlemen with red shirts, top boots

are slack in the cattle business, these
gentlemen accept situations on the
Music Hall stage and are very popular.
Formerly gold grew practically wild
in Australia, but, owing to the persistent
efforts of the old-time miners and the
enterprise of various company - pro-
moters, the industry is now a very tame

turn in drawing the attention of the
world to Australia, and was a magnifi-

prefer riding to walking.
Rabbits are a dreadful nuisance.
Many years ago, some careless person
introduced a couple, and there are now
about 786,245,000,000,000, in round

to Europe; but even this awful fate
doesn't seem to discourage them.

Australia is very exclusive
as regards many of its attri-
butes, and possesses sº

exclusive and original type
is known as the ornitho-

been sufficient to make
Australia famous even if

and both instruments must be pitched in a

We are glad to learn that, as a part
of the great land campaign initiated
under the auspices of the CHANCELLOR
of THE EXCHEQUER, a scheme for pro-
viding for the musical needs, not only
of cattle, but horses and poultry, has
been worked out by a special sub-
committee, including Sir HENRY Wood,
the Earl of TANKERVILLE, KUBELIK,
Mr. ARTHUR Ponsonby, Mr. ALGERNoN
ASHTON, and Mr. HARRY LAUDER.
One of the most interesting features
of the campaign is the effort that is
being made to enlist the co-operation of
distinguished composers. Several of
these have already promised their assist-
ance. Thus Mr. Josef HolbrookE is
actually engaged on an Agricultural
- Symphonic Tone - Poem
entitled, “Three Quavers
and a Cow,” in which the
“Ranz des Vaches” forms
the “motto” theme of the
entire work. Professor GRAN-
VILLE BANTock has wel-
comed the suggestion with
enthusiasm, and is medi-
tating a great Choral Sym-
phony in four movements,
of which the subjects will be
Ensilage, Intensive Culture,
Small Holdings, and Land
Taxes. The scenario has
been prepared by Mr. OUTH-
waite, but the words will

naturalists are strangely silent on this
point. In addition there are kangaroos
and wallabies, and a very ferocious
brand of wild dog known as the dingo,
which must not be confused with the
South African donga.
The favourite pastimes in Australia
are cricket, racing and bushranging.
The last-named is the only one which
calls for any comment, though it is not
nearly so popular as it used to be. The
modus operandi was refreshingly simple,
the properties consisting entirely of a
man with a mask, a horse, a good re-
volver and a coach full of gold. The
man with the revolver used to shoot the
man driving the coach, and then take
possession of the gold. It is generally
considered that the American Trusts
were much impressed with the fascina-
tions of bushranging.
There are many beautiful towns in
Australia, and each of them is the most
modern and progressive in the world.
Australia has its fair share of plagues,
mutton, and The Bulletin. It is also
very useful in emergencies because it is
such a long way from England; and
its people are the most open-hearted
and hospitable in the world. You
ask them.

PHILHARMONIC FARMING.
CoNSIDERABLE interest has been ex-
cited in musical circles by the recent
experiments of Mr. GRANT, of Wis-
consin. Not only has he proved to his
own satisfaction that cows to which
music is played increase their yield of
milk by one-third, but, according to The
Whitby Gazette of the 24th inst., he has
convinced a number of agricultural
experts in the United States. But it
must be good music.
“At milking-time, according to Mr. Grant,
the best music to play is a low soft tune, which
will soothe the troubled nerves of the cows;
but it has also been discovered that young cows
prefer a light composition. All cows like to
hear a waltz. They revel in the waltz, but
their milk turns sour if they are treated to a
vulgar music-hall air. The Wedding March
from “Lohengrin' has been found to have a

Professor BANTockhimself. Sir Edward
ELGAR's contribution will take the form
of a Harvest Festival Masque, in which
prominence will be assigned to the
different cereals, vegetables and fruits.
Thus there will be an obbligato for the
oat pipe in one section; in another
there will be a quartet for four vegetable
marrowphones, an instrument recently
invented by Mr. EUSTACE MILEs. A
Hop dance and a Tutti Frutti will also
be included in the work, which, we
understand, is scored for full orchestra,
supplemented with a cottage piano,
thrashing machine, and the instruments
already named.
While harmoniums are found to be
admirably adapted to the musical
organisation of cows, the physical well-
being of pigs is materially advanced by
instruments of a shriller timbre, and
the Committee have decided to offer a
prize for the best duet for two piccolos
suitable for farmyard performance.
Meantime Mr. CECIL. SHARP has
generously offered to arrange “Ye

as being specially suitable for an
good effect on most animals.

The influence of music on poultry has

intention to organize travelling string

[OCTOBER 2, 1912.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LAST HOURS.
(Being an account by our Special
Correspondent of the death of Home
Rule.)
To-DAY Ulster has found herself.
By the right of yesterday's proceedings
Ulster is a nation. Yesterday, amid
scenes of unparalleledenthusiasm, Ulster
was addressed in one afternoon by Lord
LoNDONDERRY, Sir EDWARD CARson,
Lord CHARLEs BERESFORD, Lord WIL-
Lough BY DE BROKE and (crowning
touch) Mr. F. E. SMITH. Home Rule
is dead!
The scene before the arrival of the
speakers was one to impress anybody
but an obsessed Nationalist. The
thousands of upturned faces—a trifle
grim at the thought of going into action
two years hence, but utterly without
signs of fear—spoke a stern resolve
unprecedented in history. “Never in
any circumstances will we have Home
Rule.” Ulster has said it, and for all
practical purposes Home Rule is dead.
But hark | The National Anthem is
playing; and with one accord we rise—
those of us who have seats—and stand
with bared heads as Sir Edward
CARson, followed by Lord LoNDON-
DERRY, Lord CHARLEs BERESFORD, Lord
WILLoughBY DE BROKE and (crowning
touch) Mr. F. E. SMITH, stride on to
the platform. A moment later and
Ulster's leader is speaking.
As I watch his audience I begin to
realise the spirit which dominates these
men, I begin to understand why it is
that four-fifths of Ireland can never
have Home Rule if the other fifth
objects. They hang upon the very lips
of their great general; they follow his
every word; with an incredible quick-
ness they take up each point as he
makes it. “We areaccused of bragging,”
he says; “I ask you, gentlemen, is it
the habit of the Ulster Scot to brag 2"
and immediately all the Ulster Scots
present cry “No!" with a loud voice,
and thus stamp out the base libel for
ever. A little later Sir Edward refers
to a Belfast merchant who has been low
enough to give an interview to a
Radical paper, and the deep-throated
roar of “Kick him 1" which resounds
through the hall is an indication of the
determined spirit which animates the
meeting.
But now he strikes a loftier note.
“Gentlemen, we are met to make a
solemn covenant one with the other
and likewise each to each. We are to
take an oath together, mutually and
one with the other. In this matter,
gentlemen, it has fallen to me by
Heaven's will to be your leader, con-
jointly, mutually, and side by side.
Had the answer been “No || " Home
Rule might still be a living issue, but
the roar of assent made it plain that
for all practical purposes Home Rule
is dead.
The final note was of a tremendous
solemnity:-
“Gentlemen, with God's aid, always
providing that The Westminster Gazette
won't mis-quote me, I will lead you to
victory.”
Lord WILLOUGHBY DE BROKE is an
Irishman of a different type. His
message was simple.
“We are prepared,” he said, “if it
be possible, to resist Home Rule with-
out the shedding of blood; but if blood
must flow, then, believe me, gentlemen,
blood will flow. For in the last resort
our strength will be the strength of our
own right arm, and the Thames will run
red with blood before a Parliament is
established on College Green.”
Wild cheering and loud hurrahs
greeted this statement, for every one
present remembered the noble lord's
similar threat in regard to the Parlia-
ment Bill; and how, before that Bill
became an Act, Lord WILLough BY DE
BROKE defied his enemies on Waterloo
Bridge until his blood poured into the
Thames and, wounded in a hundred
places, he fell unconscious across his
broken sword.
But suddenly this mass of shouting
men is hushed into silence, for Lord
CHARLEs BERESFORD is in the middle
of a typically breezy speech. -
“Stick to it, gentlemen,” he said.
“You're bound to win. You've got them
on the run. It's WINSTON CHURCHILL
who has been doing it all. I thought
when he went to the Admiralty that
the Navy might be brought up to its
proper strength, but I was wrong.
WINSTON ... two-power standard . . .
monkey-tricks . . . the recent naval
manoeuvres . . . the Admiralty . . .
WINSTON . . .”—at which point a
volley of cheering brought an excellent
speech to a close. And when the noble
lord sat down one felt that once more
Home Rule had, for all practical pur-
poses, been killed.
It was at 4.15 that the greatest
Irishman of them all, Mr. F. E. SMITH,
rose to address the multitude. A
Solemn Covenant without Mr. F. E.
SMITH would be unthinkable. Indeed
anything without Mr. F. E. SMITH
would be unthinkable. As a well-
known member of our Orange Lodge
said to me: “It only needed this 1"
“Gentlemen,” said Mr. F. E. SMITH,
“the Government has betrayed the
country, has sold its honour and its
sovereign's honour for a mess of
pottage; and, gentlemen, it is a mess,
this mess, but we go to them and we
say to them, ‘Nol get out of it for your-
selves.' Gentlemen, they have toed
the line to REDMOND, and now the
country is going to toe them out.”
As I watched the audience under the
influence of this speech, I realized what
I had not properly realized before, that
beneath his stern demeanour the Ulster-
man hides a real sense of humour.
Indeed it is not too much to say that
these splendid Nonconformists—in no
way to be confounded, of course, with
the Nonconformists of Scotland and
Wales and the Whitefield Tabernacle—
are the very salt of the earth.
But we must return to Mr. F. E.
SMITH. Great Statesman and Leader
as he is, I think he made a mistake in
his peroration. His words were:
“And if the PRIME MINISTER sends
English soldiers to shoot down Ulster-
men, what shall we do? Gentlemen, I
will tell you what we shall do. We
shall simply hang the Prime Minister
to the nearest lamp-post.”
Of course the difference between
English soldiers shooting down common
English rioters during a strike, and
English soldiers shooting down loyal
Ulster rioters during a rebellion is
enormous to any real thinker, but to a
mixed audience it is a trifle subtle.
And some of us could not help remem-
bering that in the former case Mr.
F. E. SMITH did not hang the PRIME
MINISTER to the nearest lamp-post.
However, it is ungracious to find fault
with one who had come all the way
from Liverpool to address his fellow-
countrymen, and who by his words had
killed Home Rule for ever.
Once more we stood up with bared
heads while Lord LoNDoNDERRY, Sir
Edward CARson, Lord CHARLES BERES-
Ford, Lord WILLough BY DE BROKE and
(crowning touch) Mr. F. E. SMITH filed
slowly out of the hall. Home Rule
was dead.
Later. — Home Rule is dead. Sir
Edward CARson has just received the
following letter from the PRIME
MINISTER:—
DEAR SIR Edward, I gather from
the reports of your meetings that Ulster
strongly objects to Home Rule. My,
dear fellow, why didn't you tell me
before? I had no idea. I thought,
Ulster was in favour of it. But of
course we won't press the Bill if there
is anybody who doesn't like it.
Yours ever, H. H. Asquith.
P.S.—You might ask F. E. SMITH
for me—I understand that he is a
Welshman—whether there is anybody
in Wales who doesn't want Disestab-
lishment. If there is, we'll drop that

SIR,--I observe in your issue of
September 24 the phrase “the un-
doubted gifts of Smax Hardtrein.”
What your contributor means by this
I should greatly like to know. “Un-
doubted" is a strong word. It means,
I take it, that in universal acceptance
Hardtrein has ability. Let me then
say here, as unambiguously as I am
able, that you are wrong, for one person
at least doubts Hardtrein's artistic
capacity, and that is myself. If you
want to know, there is one man and
one only who has undoubted gifts as
a producer of plays, and that is Edmund
Cradon Gorg. Yours, etc.,
THoRD KNUFFSEN.
SIR,-There is a bet on at our
Amateur Dramatic Society as to which
came first, Hardtrein or Gorg, and I
write to ask you to settle it. Your
word will be taken as final. Some of
our members hold that Gorg influences
Hardtrein, and indeed go farther and
others say that Hardtrein influences
Gorg. Personally I don't much mind,
especially as neither seems to have
anything to do with any of the plays
that one likes; but since there is money
on it—as a matter of fact, five shillings
—I should greatly like to know.
Yours, etc., IRVING Tonks.
SIR,--I see references in the Press to
the genius of Mr. Cradon Gorg. They
are ridiculous. There is but one man
of genius now connected with the
artistic production of plays, and that is
Bolskoff, of the Nijni Novgorod Hay-
market. Both Gorg and Hardtrein
equally derive from Bolskoff.
Yours, etc., HENRY K. BURGE.
SIR,-Would it not be possible for
Some arrangement to be made among
the nations by which each kept its own
men of transcendent genius within its
confines? England, I have no doubt,
might lose a certain number of
musicians, but, at any rate, we should

Gorg in our midst, to show us, as he

time we should be freed from the un-

Destruction on a grand scale, by fire,
by water and by burial. We are stern,
inexorable; we have no thought of vain
regrets: indeed we egg each other on.
The first Destruction day—three years
ago—lasted for nearly a week. It
rivalled the Spring Cleaning, and was
much more permanent in its results.
We purged the house from the far end
of the back cellar to the top corner of
the garret. All its inmates, of what-
soever age or degree, trooped forth into
the open bearing their burdens to
heap upon the pile. Out came the
defective cameras, the unread books,
unworn clothes, torn music and broken
chairs. Out came the damaged mowing-
machine. Out came the barbarous ag-
glomeration of photographs that stood
on the piano. Out came all that hope-
less and decrepit mass of goods that
had been “put by because they would
be useful some time.” One full cart-
load was culled from the little hole
under the stairs alone. But we were
not quite up to the job in those days.
We granted reprieves; we commuted
sentences. The clock (which did not
go), having once belonged to our Aunt
Martha, was spared; also a torn um-
brella, which might some day be re-
covered, and a hideous pair of vases,
because they had been a recent present
from my mother-in-law. But we are
much firmer now.
Now that we have only one year's
supply to work on we generally get
| through in a day, if we have an early
breakfast and a cold lunch. But, of
course, the bonfire has to be laid and
the grave dug overnight. The morning
is devoted to collection and prepara-
tion and the afternoon to sacrifice, and

even now in doubt if it would not be
quicker to take everything out of the
house to start with and then put back
the ones we want to keep. For it is
amazing the amount of stuff that drifts
into a house in the course of a year.
And in the evening we come home,
worn and weary, and make a tour of
the establishment and sit down in each
room and look round and say to each
other, “There is not a single thing in
this room that has not a good reason
for being here.” And we feel rewarded.

DESTRUCTION DAY.
We always know that other people
would like to do the same if they
had the pluck. For the Jumble Sale
is at best only a method for burking
responsibility and raising money for
charitable purposes by questionable
means. The only real cure is the
Clean Sweep.
And then of course no one can be
bothered. You may start all right
with the drawing-room. But when
you find that it takes a sizeable wheel-
barrow to do that one room, you
generally chuck it, and go away and
smoke a pipe and try to think of some-
thing else.
But Ethel and I have really faced
this problem. We have done more
than that. We have elevated the day

A TOTAL FAILURE.
“You aren't bringing Felicity up
properly,” they had said more than once.
“The child is getting precocious. She
knows far too much of some things,
and not enough of others. No wonder
with such a father.”
I began to think there might be
something in the idea, and anyway
I could not rest under the imputation
of being an unsuccessful parent, so I
purchased a small book on the subject,
entitled, “Training the Young Mind.”
From this work I gleaned the informa-
tion that education may be imparted
at all times and places. “It is better,”
the author said, “to let the child learn
from nature than from books.
“Or smoke or play football,” added
Felicity.
I feared for the moment that she
was not taking our little talk quite
seriously, but on glancing down I dis-
covered that her face was perfectly
grave.
We wandered about the gardens,
and I showed the various exhibits to
my little daughter, telling her their
names, which were fortunately on the
cages, and explaining to her their
various habits and peculiarities. She
was very attentive, but almost entirely
silent.
She approved of the pelicans and
the polar bears, but shook her head
sadly at the camel, though she ad-l.
“Now I think we have learnt some-
thing here, have we not? Let us go
on and see if Mr. Elephant is at
home.”
Felicity bought a bun for the ele-
phant (which introduced the subject
of extravagance) and gave it to a seal
(which brought up the question of
wastefulness).
“But he looks so hungry,” she said.
“My dear child,” I said, “seals never
eat buns. They eat fish. They live
on a strict fish diet.”
Of course the seal spoilt everything.
It swallowed the bun, laughed aloud,
and disappeared into the lake. It
might have had a little more sense.
Felicity said nothing.
—, We went on and entered
Take him to the Zoological
Gardens.”
I laid the book on my desk
and sent for my little
daughter.
I spread my feet out on
the hearth-rug and put my
hands under my coat tails.
“This afternoon,” I said,
“I am going to take you to
the Zoological Gardens.”
“You mean the Zoo?”
“I mean precisely what I
said, Felicity.” -- -
“All right, Papa, have it
your own way.”
I twisted my moustache.
“A child must learn to
respect its father,” I said.
“It's the first rule in the
book . . . that is . . . .”
I cleared my throat and
possibly cast a nervous glance
in the direction of my desk,
the Elephant House.
“There, that 's the ele-
phant,” I said, “No, not
there ! There.”
Felicity gazed at it with
round eyes.
“Oo.”
“Now, the elephant,” I
pursued, “though the largest
creature, in the world, has
not the sagacity of the dog
nor the fleetness of the gazelle
nor the industry of the bee.”
“Nor can he carol like
the lark,” said Felicity.
“True.”
“Well, you can't expect
the poor beast to do every-
thing.”
I had to admit the sound-
ness of this view. On the
whole the arguments seemed
strongly against me. I began

Our last visit was to the
“Large Ape House.”
“Here,” I said, “we

“I’ll go and dress at once,
Papa,” she said; “what
would you like me to wear?”
“I'm afraid that you think too much
of your appearance, Felicity,” I said
severely. “Vanity is one of our little
faults. The animals we shall see this
aſternoon will not be critical. They
do not dress at all.”
“No, not at all well, anyway.”
“Not at all,” I said.

As we drove there I took the oppor-
tunity of saying a few words to
Felicity on the subject of our little
excursion.
“We must always try on such oc-
casions as these,” I said, “to improve
our minds even while we are enjoying
ourselves. From the animals we shall
see to-day we may very likely learn
some useful lessons, even though they
mitted that he might be useful as a
water cistern.
It was not until we reached the lion's
house that she volunteered an opinion.
“It would be fun to let them all
out, wouldn't it?” she said.
“Oh no,” I replied, “it would be a
great mistake. These lions and tigers,
though they look so much like pussy
on a large scale, are very fierce and
wild, and would perhaps eat several
people.”
“Why not?” she said; “I shouldn't
blame them.”
“You would be the first to blame
them,” I said, “if they ate you. We
are all very prone to think that other
people's misfortunes are of little im-
portance, but when it is a matter of
inconvenience to ourselves it is a very
stand in the presence of
our ancestors.”
Felicity gazed at them for a long
time in solemn silence. Then she
turned to me with a look of deep
reproach.
“Oh, Papa,” she said, “how you
have deceived me!”
“How—how have I deceived you,
my dear?” I said.
“You know you always told me,
Papa, that our ancestors came over
with the Conqueror.”

We passed out through the turnstile,

I AM again beholden to The Pall
Mall Gazette's interviewer for light on
the motives of an actor-producer. This
time it is Mr. GRAN VILLE BARKER who

(Not an advertisement of the Smoke Abate-
the advantages of a simple setting for
Shakspeare over a more elaborate
pointedly in four words: ‘You get
the play.” “Either,’ he added,
“you want to see a play of
Shakspeare, or you do not.’”
“‘There
are a vast number of persons
who do, and the “decoration ”
we have used is perfectly ob-
vious, simple and straightfor-
ward. Granted that you want
to give the play, and not merely
is no other way of doing it.'”
I gathered from the above
that my friend Mr. GRAN VILLE
BARKER had determined that
SHAKSPEARE should at last have
a chance, while the producer, in
a spasm of sacrificial devotion,
suppressed himself. I could
guess, therefore, what a shock
it must have been to him to
find his own work discussed in
the Press; to be subjected to an
recoiled; to read elsewhere a
discourse on the subject by Mr. Perdita
name of SHARSPEARE was never once
mentioned, but he (Mr. BARKER), how-
ever much his production might irritate
Mr. CRAIG (who hadn't seen it), was
admitted to be “a fine fellow.” And
I can well imagine the hot and rapid
words of protest that fell from Mr.
GRANVILLE BARKER's lips when, on
entering the vestibule of the Savoy
Theatre, he found, not a statue of the
Bard to whom he was giving a chance,
but a life-size portrait of himself.
In his delightful preface to the
acting edition of The Winter's Tale
Mr. BARRER says: “As to scenery, as
scenery is mostly understood—canvas,
realistically painted—I would have none
of it.” But to avoid realistic scenery
and present a formal background is
not to deliver yourself from the vice
of pageantry if at the same time you
fill your stage, as Mr. BARKER does,
with a veritable orgy of fantastic cos-
tumes, dazzling with the blaze of their
discordant colours and disturbing by the
restlessness of their designs. The scene
of the rustic revels was pure pageant
and nothing else, notwithstanding its
unobtrusive cottage at the back. The
effect of this kind of thing is still to
strain the senses of the audience to the
point of exhaustion, leaving them scant
strength or leisure for the digestion of
the play itself. At His Majesty's they
may dress the Greek tyrant and his
Court on strictly classic lines, and at
the Savoy they may see them through
the eyes of the Renaissance, but that
does not make Mr. BARKER's art any
better than Sir HERBERT TREE's as far
as SHAKSPEARE's chance is concerned.

“Classic dress” (I quote again from
the producer's preface) “would offend
against the very spirit of the play,”
and he therefore preferred to agree with
Mr. ALBERT RoTHENSTEIN that “Re-
naissance-classic, that is, classic dress
as Shakspeare saw it, would be the
thing.” But does he suppose that the
bizarre costumes with which he staggers

SHARSPEARE “saw" them, with War-

what SHAKSPEARE actually “saw" with
that vision of his that from the Pisgah-
height of genius could descry the sea-
board of Bohemia, and Delphi isled in
the ocean 2 Does anyone imagine that
it would have greatly disturbed his
sense of historic periods and local
colour if he had been asked to shift
his Hamlet to Forres and his Macbeth
to Elsinore?
When I produce a play of
SHAKSPEARE I shall give him
a real chance by putting his
characters, of whatever period,
into the everyday modern dress
of actors at preliminary re-
hearsals; and when I am inter-
viewed I shall say that that is
how SHAKSPEARE “saw "them,

creator could project himself

defy the speed limit with his glorious
voice; but I did not resent the pace
at which he took his words, leaving
my intelligence far in the rear; for one
can always read SHAKSPEARE afterwards
to find out what the actor has been
saying. I could see that he had gone
gibbering mad, and that was enough
for me.
Miss LILLAH McCARTHY, who was
privileged to make her own pace, gave
its right dignity to Hermione's moving
defence before the Court, and to the
noble passage,
“Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping.”
But the rest, of whose utterances in the
original text scarcely a word was spared
us, left me rather cold; though very
sound work was done by Mr. DREwiTT
as Camillo, Miss BERINGER (who seemed
to enjoy herself) as Paulina, Mr.
NICHOLson as the Old Shepherd, Mr.
QUARTERMAINE as the Clown and Mr.
GRAHAM as Poliacenes. But I found
Miss NESBITT's Perdita too skittishly
virginal, and I was frankly gratified
when The Bear made mincemeat of
Mr. RATHBONE's Antigonus. The hu-
mour of Mr. WHITBY as Autolycus and
Mr. PLAYFAIR as Paulina's Steward
was a very pleasant relief, but the
best fun was undesigned, except by the
costumier and the person responsible
for the gentlemen's plumes. I never
want to see a more diverting spectacle
than Mr. KELT as the tufted Officer
of the Court (Admiralty and Divorce),
and his raucous recitation of Apollo's
oracle was a thing to travel miles to
hear.
The noise, even without an orchestra,
was often appalling, and, if the mean-
ing of many of the words was anyhow
going to be taken for granted in the
rush of their delivery, it would have
been kinder of Mr. BARKER to take
some larger place, like Covent Garden
or Olympia, for his production.
In conclusion, if my remarks have
been lacking in that fulsomeness which
keeps a critic out of trouble, I honestly
want to be grateful to Mr. BARKER for a
very sporting piece of work. I only wish
that he had chosen for his experiment a
play less exposed to the ridicule of the
Philistine. For, when full recognition
is made of its great literary qualities,
The Winter's Tale is, after all, a pre-
posterous drama, isn't it? O. S.

MEDALITIS.
IN the full height and glory of the year,
When husbandmen are housing
golden sheaves,
Before the jealous frost has come to
shear
From the bright woodland its reluc-
tant leaves,
I pass within a gateway, where the
trees,
Tall, stately, multi-coloured, manifold,
Draw the eye on as to some Chersonese,
Spanning the pathway with their
arch of gold.
A river sings and loiters through the
grass, -
Girdling a pleasance scythed and
trimly shorn;
And here I watch men vanish and
repass
To the last hour of eve from early
morn;
Dryads peer out at them, and goat-foot
Pan -
Plays on his pipe to their unheeding
earS ; - -
They pass, like pilgrims in a caravan,
Towards some Mecca in the far-off
years.
Blind to the woodland's autumn livery,
Blind to the emerald pathway that
they tread,
Deaf to the river's low-pitched lullaby,
Their limbs are quick and yet their
souls are dead;
Nothing to them the song of any bird,
For them in vain were horns of
Elfland wound,
Blind, deaf and stockfish-mute; for, in
a word,
They are engaged upon a Medal
Round.
Making an anxious torment of a game
Whose humours now intrigue them
not at all,
They chase the flying wraith of printed
fame,
With card and pencil arithmetical;
With features pinched into a painful
frown
Looming misfortunes they anticipate,
Or, as the fatal record is set down,
Brood darkly on a detrimental 8.
These are in thrall to Satan, who
devised
Pencil and card to tempt weak men
to sin, - -
Whereby their prowess might be adver-
tised—
Say, 37 Out and 40 In;
Rarely does any victim break his chains
And from his nape the lethal burden
doff—
The man with medal virus in his veins
Seldom outlives it and gets back to
THE REPRIEVE.
GLoRIA insisted on it.
“None of my fiancés,” she observed
sententiously, “has ever been com-
pletely without a redeeming feature.
You will part your hair in the middle;
you will wear Liberty Art collars;
you will go about in an overcoat like
a dressing-gown and socks like a
cyclone - ?
“A bicyclone,” I interjected cleverly.
(When Gloria is once fairly off, any
interjection is clever.)
She paused not to laugh; then she
went on—“And if you can't even
wear spats for my sake, all is over
between us. I can't go about with a
fiancé looking like—(she searched for
an adequately abysmal description)—
an artist.” -
“Don’t be ridiculous,” I said; “I
had my hair cut only on Saturday.
Anyhow, real men don't wear spats;
they avoid them because they know
they're effeminate; and women culti-
vate them because they think they're
masculine.”
“Why drag real men into it?” asked
Gloria.
I looked at her determinedly.
“Young woman,” I said, “why did
you become engaged to me?”
“Gracious,” said Gloria, “didn't
you read my letter to The Daily Mail
about it? What do young men read
nowadays? Put your hat on at once,”
she added, “we’re going spatting.”
It was no use; I went like a lamb,
or like a bird. A lamb in bird's cloth-
ing, let us say.
We went steadily along Oxford Street
till we came to a policeman.
“Can you direct me to a good spatter,
constable 2 " I asked.
“He means a place where he can
buy spats,” explained Gloria.
(She is one of those people who
came into the world to explain things
that don't need it.)
At the door of Hobbes & Marlowe's
distinguished-lookingemporium Ihalted
for a last stand.

“Inside,” repeated Gloria coldly;

It was then that Hope first sat up
definitely and said, “Here I am.”
“The lady is buying some things,” I
explained to the man, “and I thought
I'd just glance at some spats.”
I glanced; I was grieved and amazed
to discover how far the modern spat
falls short of my modest requirements.
“Have you no spats with clocks?”
I asked at last. “I want some with
pale mauve clocks—you know—the
colour of the tiles in Dover Street
Station.”
No, he had no such spats, he said
sadly. - -
Seeing instinctively that he was
going to offer to make them for me for
Christmas, I added hastily—
“I want spats with laces, too.

Just as I was about to explain that I

with rejected spats.
“Oh, Jack,” she said, “I’ve got just

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. WALTER BELL is the Colossus of Fleet Street. He
strides over seven centuries of the history of the thorough-
fare, and at every step finds matter of human interest.
Fleet Street in Seven Centuries (Sir Isaac PITMAN) is con-
siderably more than a record of persons and events grouped
under its title. It traces with many picturesque touches
the growth of London beyond the walls within which the
Romans jealously encircled the City. It is no new
topic, having found congenial work for the pen of
Stow and earlier writers. It has never been better
done than in this portly volume, which no one who begins
to read will find too long. Mr. BELL is animated by
sympathy for London throughout its many cen-
turied course, and has the happy knack of communi-
cating his interest to his reader. The pages are thronged
with passages that within the space of a few lines illuminate
Fleet Street even more effectively than the electric light
that succeeds to the once familiar lantern. One learns, for
example, that the back part of Mr. Punch's former office in
Fleet Street occupied the site of a house where MILTON
lodged, a circumstance that may account for much. For
years the daily newspapers have grown accustomed to
speak disrespectfully of the sea-serpent. But there is no
getting over the fact that nine years ago, excavations being
made at the printing office of a weekly newspaper in
Salisbury Square, there were dug out the bones of a rein-
deer. This animal, yearning for immortality, knew what it

A drawback to the full success of the scheme is that the
far-seeing beast necessarily remains anonymous. Mr. BELL,
commencing his tour through the centuries, has something
to say about the Roman occupation. The wildest desire of
the human breast would be satisfied if it were possible
for JULIUS CAESAR to revisit the scene of one of his early
labours and, taking a turn in a taxi-cab, say from Hyde
Park Corner to London Bridge, behold how far-reaching an
oak has grown out of the acorn he planted.
The chief diversion which The Three Anarchists, by
MAUD STEPNEY RAwson (PAUL), offered me was to imagine
the expression and feelings of the library subscriber settling
down to his expected bonne bouche of bombs and pistols,
and discovering on the title-page, from a quoted obiter
scriptum of Mr. C. F. G. MASTERMAN, that the anarchists
in question were Love and Birth and Death. Here clearly
are a title and a theme of promise, but beyond the range
of the author, who is content to do no more than tack on
her title to her novel without the trouble of artistically
developing her theme. Love and Birth and Death enter
the orbit of most of us, not in a specially anarchistic way,
and not always in that of the gentle and too subservient

Geste. And I can't help noticing the author's use of a
growing modern habit of slinging on to paper, in the name
of realism, all sorts of unselected detail, cemented together
with clichés worn smooth with constant service. But I
can unreservedly commend to all lovers of unconscious
humour the pseudo-realistic fight between old George and
young Harry—the “swift cracks of the fist,” the “hits in
the chest,” the snarls, grunts and gurgles, and (when
George took to kicking, which Harry º “the
wounding feet waggling feebly" and the “horrible pain
below the belt.”
For several years I have been vaguely conscious that
Mr. BURGIN has been writing novels and that I have not
been reading them, but until I opened Varick's Legacy
(HUTCHINsoN) I had no idea that my acts of omission
amounted to the appalling number of forty-three. If, how-
ever, this book is to be taken as a fair sample of the author's
wares it is not difficult to account for their popularity.
Wind Among the Barley (MILLs AND Boon). There are
two things that put me off in the usual run of tales about
villages. Though it is good to be alone among the bracken,
it is not so pleasant hearing anyone else declaiming about
it in lengthy and affected simplicity. , Again, the village
annalist always seems to be saying, especially if his village
is a Devonian one, “This is our village and I am one of us,
but you are not, and don't you forget that.” To these
faults, Miss WILLCocks adds a third, that of going beyond
her point and ending on an anticlimax, which is telling once
in a way but tiresome when repeated at the end of every one
of her twenty-odd stories. And yet she leaves me the
devoted admirer of her village of Larkbeare, her fishermen,
farm-folk and moor people, and almost of herself. Susan
Palfrey, Mrs. Tamzen Pickman, Lawyer. Brimacombe and
Dr. Boswarva, I loved them all for their odd matter-of-fact
ways and their happy phrases. “But her 'll have to shift
her clothes before seeing company,” says one of Maria
Shaddick. “Not her,” is the answer. “'Tis a homely sort

of body, and if you see her
Monday, you see her Sun-
day.” Best of all are the
incessant love-affairs of that
hearty philanderer, John
Metherall.
Had Miss WILLCocks
striven less after simplicity,
had she not included herself
so prominently and almost
ostentatiously among her
characters and specifically
called me a “stranger” in
the first chapter, I should
have been bound to confess
that I felt nothing but
gratitude for this enter-
taining series of homely
episodes.
Of the various clever
writers who are at present
striving for first place in
what I-may call the East
London Stakes, there is no
Legacy with jokes which
even a family-humorist would decline to handle.
Every now and then we get in the papers a story of a
kidnapped child and a huge ransom demanded from a
millionaire parent. That, stripped of embroidery, is the
theme of Miss JENNETTE LEE's book, Betty Harris
(METHUEN). I think a very good detective story could be
made out of it—I dare say it has been done—but that is
not Miss LEE's way. She has chosen the alternative
sentimental method, and skated over the practical details.
The child is tracked after nearly three months, more by
coincidences than anything else, to a hiding place which, I
am sure, would not have baffled the Chicago police (who
are those concerned) more than a day. The little girl is
found by a dreamy sort of Greek fruiterer who sees visions
of the Acropolis whenever he shuts his eyes, and gives one
the impression that Miss LEE has recently been doing
Yurrup and acquired a fit-out of general culture on the best
Boston lines. Her style is spasmodic: four words and . . .

she seems to be on tip-toe reaching to the top-shelf for the

doubt whatever that. Mr.
Robert HALIFAx carries my money every time. Much as I
remember to have liked A Whistling Woman, his latest book,
A Slice of Life (CoNSTABLE) is certainly its better. There
is the same delicacy and insight, with a greater sureness
of touch. I think it must be the milk of human kindness
that gives to the productions of Mr. HALIFAx their peculiar
flavour. All the persons of the simple tale, the dwellers in
Roper's Row, Barking, Mr. Domno especially, and “the old
soul at the back,” are touched in, even the unpleasant ones,
with a humanity that has never a hint of caricature. Mr.
Casswade, the landlord, and his good-hearted, wholly in-
effective agent, Josh, are creations of pure joy, from whose
interviews I should like to quote whole pages. Now and
again I am a little uncertain about the heroine, but here I
am prepared to admit the fault is more mine than that of her
creator; she has some love scenes that are as 'unconven-
tional, yet completely sincere, as anything I can call to
mind. Sincerity is indeed the final note of Mr. HALIFAx.
At his most sensational you are never aware of invention;
the thing remains a “just so" story—and a fine one. -

III.-CANADA.
AT various times and by various
statesmen our various Colonies have
all been described as the brightest gem
in the British crown or diadem, as the
case may be; but from sheer weight of
repetition Canada may definitely be said
to merit this appellation. It is a very
big country, and quite a lot of it is so
unknown as to be largely a matter of
guesswork. It extends from the United
States in the South,to as far North
day in London, they perish miserably—
which only serves to show what a hardy
race are we Londoners.
The scenery in Canada is immense.
The Great Plains stretch right across
the country till they meet the Rocky
Mountains. The Rocky Mountains are
also very wonderful, and are principally
famous on account of the difficulty experi-
enced in getting the Canadian-Pacific
Railway across them. Otherwise they
are comparatively useless, and are gene-

the Immigration Department. You
can shoot almost anything, from a
moose bull to a rapid; and, if you care
to venture into the Western districts,
you may even bag a man or two. The
most exclusive prize, however, is the
grizzly bear. A unique advantage about
shooting in Canada is that business can
be combined with pleasure, most of the
animals there being covered with a
very expensive kind of fur, which finds
a ready market throughout the world.

mighty oceans which limit it.
Its expansion in the matter of
trade is, of course, largely deter-
mined by the fact that it is
a British Colony. But then
every country has some draw-
back with which to contend.
Canada is a land of extremes.
In summer the weather is so
hot that the asbestos lining to
the fireproof buildings has been
known to melt; and in winter
the snow is so deep that special
elevators have to be instituted
to convey the residents down
to the roofs of their dwellings.
Of course this only refers to
certain parts of Canada. In
many districts the climate is
one long dream of delicious de-
light. For further particulars
see the letter-press so kindly
supplied by the Immigration
Department.
But it must be admitted that
the extraordinary variations in
temperature—in some parts—
are not without effect on the in-
habitants. They have to cram
a year's work into six months,
because it is far too cold during
the winter to do anything except

broncho-busting, and exploring.
The first consists in letting
loose a large number of tree-
trunks on a swift river, and
then jumping from one to the
other; the second is the art
of remaining on a horse which
is convinced that you belong
somewhere else; and the third
is indulged in because otherwise
so much of the country would
go to waste.
Canada is famous for its maple
sugar, its North-Western Police,
the siege of Quebec, Sir GILBERT
PARKER, and the North Mag-
netic Pole. Next to the Police,
the most remarkable feature is
the Magnetic Pole, there being
only one other specimen in the
world, and that a very inferior
article.
Lastly, Canadians drink rye
whisky in preference to the
kind produced by Bonnie Scot-
land. This is, perhaps, their
greatest achievement.

Canada is also famous for its gold

the upper reaches of the Saskatchewan,
and always seems to be able to find a
new mine when it desires to get rid of
the more turbulent spirits among its
population. It is a great pity there

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BABY OR THE PICTURE 2
: SIR GEORGE BIRDwood's bold de-
claration, such is his fine asthetic
passion, that were he in a burning room
with a baby and RAPHAEL's Dresden
Madonna, and could save only one of
them, he would save the picture, has
dropped a bomb-shell into conversa-
tional circles. All other topics have
given way before this. The Balkan
crisis is as nothing, Home Rule and
Ulster fade away, and even the question
who will win the Cesarewitch fails to
attract a reply until Sir GEORGE BIRD-
wooD's enormous problem has been
settled. Meanwhile The Erpress with
commendable enterprise has put the
dilemma before some of our acutest
minds and printed their answers.
In examining the stages of this
profoundly interesting plebiscite one
could not but feel that far more valu-
able results would have been obtained
had the human factor been older. A
baby is so young and, in a sense, so
immature. There are too few data
about a baby. One would not know
what one was saving; and this ignor-
ance reduces the action of the saver to
mere sentimentalism. Now, were the
work of art contrasted, not with a help-
less pink potentiality like a baby, but
with a man of masterly performance
and superb confidence, such as, say,
Mr. G. B. SHAw, the alternative lines
of conduct offered to the person in the
burning room would present difficulties
worth solving. For one knows all
about Mr. SHAw; he is.
Acting upon this belief and with his
customary tendency towards usefulness,
Mr. Punch has put the question before
a number of eminent ladies and gentle-
men. Sir GEORGE BIRDwood's text
remains the same, except that for the
baby Mr. SHAw has been substituted.
The room is the same; the flames are
equally threatening; the picture is still
the Dresden Raphael; but the baby has
become G. B. S. Now, which would
you save?
A selection of replies are appended:—
Sir GEORGE BIRDwood: I should save
the Raphael.
Miss LILLAH McCARTHY: What a
strange question | I should save Mr.
SHAw, of course.
Mr. G. K. CHESTERTON: I should
save the Raphael. One cannot get a
new Raphael.
| Sir A. W. PINERO : I should think a
long time.
| Sir CHARLEs Holroyd; Would the
picture have to go back to Dresden 2
Mr. GRANVILLE BARKER: It would
be fun to watch SHAw saving himself.
Mrs.PANKHURST: I should say, “Now

ANOTHER FOOTBALL INVASION.
ARRIVAL of THE NUBIANs.
THough public attention has been
largely monopolised by the famous
“Springboks,” the arrival of the
Nubian football team at Southampton
on Saturday last has naturally caused
considerable excitement in athletic
circles, as this is the first occasion on
which a genuine Black-All-Over team
has visited this country. We are glad
therefore to lay before our readers
some notes by a fellow-passenger:-
There are in all twenty-four mem-
bers of the team, not to mention their
manager, Mr. Jonah Porbeagle, and
several friends and relatives who are
accompanying them on the trip, notably
Mrs. Jim Panzee, herself no mean per-
former on the side comb, and the life
and soul of the party at the daily
smoking-concerts held on the long
journey to England. On shipboard an
effort was made to keep up practice,
but it was soon abandoned, and the
Nubians confined their attention to
punching the speedle, stoot-racing,
pingling the pipit—a sort of Abys-
sinian skittles—deep-sea breathing and
PECULIARITIES of THE TEAM.
Jack Effarig stands out from the
team by reason of his enormous height.
He measures 7 ft. 10 in. from the crown
of his head to the sole of his feet when
measured along the line of his neck, but
only 6ft. 6in. from the sole of his foot
to the crown of his head in a vertical
line. He is the best concertinist of the
team and knows the works of the
Baroness ORczy practically by heart.
By a curious coincidence, though only
twenty-four, he measures 48in. round
the chest. Tim Allirog has the longest
arms in the team. He is a vegetarian,
weighs 15st. 4 lb., and is the only man
who ever made the Emperor MENELIK
laugh. “Jimbo” Allirog, his younger
brother, is a bit of a dandy and plays in
lemon-coloured kid gloves and heliotrope
socks.
voice and, when dishevelled, which is
most unusual, bears a striking resem-
blance to Sir Edwin RAY LANKESTER.
But the greatest personality in the team
is Blagwa Nobbig, the captain, who is
the only man living who has ridden an
okapi. Nobbig is a splendid specimen
of prognathous humanity, and to see
him leading the revels at a jamboree is
He has a magnificent baritone;
|His weakness—if he has a weakness—
is nuts; indeed it is said that more than
once he has been stopped in a “run in ’’
by the lure of these insidious comesti-
bles deftly thrown in his path.
THE NUBIAN GAME.
Though differing widely from ortho-
dox Rugby and Association rules the
Nubian game has a spectacular charm
which is all its own. Kicking the ball
is absolutely forbidden; the essence of
the game is passing or slinging the ball,
which is about half the size of an Asso-
ciation ball. The full-back hangs by
his toes from the cross-bar and guards
the goal with his hands, and the half-
backs and three-quarters are equipped
with a wooden instrument like a long
ladle in which they carry the ball,
while the function of the forwards is
entirely vocal and saltatory. The game
is thus a sort of blend of Lacrosse;and
the Basque Pelota, with a suggestion of
Spillikins. In their earlier matches the
Nubians will play against one another,
but it is hoped that in time an English
team will be formed to practise the new
game and eventually to meet the
visitors.
It should be added that the Nubians’

[“Dr. Leon Meunier, an eminent food specialist, recommends as the most effective method of promoting digestion a promenade on
all-fours after each meal."]
THE TURNING POINT.
(A compressed VERSION of THE
St. JAMEs's PLAY.)
ACT I.
[The Scene is laid in a reception-room
in M. Stettin's country house. It
is after dinner, and, as so often
happens after dinner, somebody is
playing the piano. Most of the
characters are standing round the
pianist to see how she does it, but
in one corner Marcel Beaucourt is
making love to Monique Felt. So,
at least, those of us who know Mr.
GoDFREY TEARLE and Miss ETHEL
IRVING by sight discover from our
programmes.
Everybody. Charming, charming. Do
play it again.
Marcel (a trifle annoyed). I shall leave
you now, Monique; your husband is
watching us. I am afraid he suspects
something. They don't generally sus-
pect till the Second Act.
Monique. Go and talk to Thérèse.
She is sometimes rather amusing after
dinner, or at the beginning of a play, or
any time when people are rather easily
amused. She's in bad form to-night,
though. Perhaps she'll be brighter
when Bertrand comes.
Bertrand. Hallo, there's Thérèse.
Come to the front of the stage with me
and I'll tell you all about myself.
(Does so.)
Thérèse. Isn't this boring the stalls a
bit, seeing that you aren't in the plot
at all, really?
Bertrand. My dear girl, how stupid
you are We're trying to bore them,
so as to make the great Second Act seem
more thrilling. Look out, Sir GEORGE
ALEXANDER wants to speak.
Colonel Felt |. Marcel). I desire a
word with you, but there are too many
people on the stage at present. Can't
you get them off somehow?
Marcel. Right. (To everybody) Well,
what about bridge? (Ereunt everybody.)
Now then.
Felt. What I want to say is this.
You love my wife
Marcel. I do. And she loves me.
Felt (calmly). That is impossible,
because I'm a much finer man than
you. For instance, I have more self-
restraint than you have. What pre-
vents me from flinging myself at your
throat now? Not the fact that you are
so much bigger than I, but simply my
self-restraint. Also you're only a
politician and I'm a soldier, and this
has been advertised as a patriotic play.
Enter Monique.
Marcel. He suspects. I must talk
things over with you. When can I
see you ?
Monique (surprised). Why, in my
bedroom at one o'clock to-night, of
course !
Marcel (doubtfully). Wouldn't that
seem rather—I mean some people are
so silly about little things like that.
They might think—
Monique (proudly to the audience).
Then in case there's anybody with a
nasty mind like that in the theatre to-
night I'd better say once and for all
that I am a good woman. And until
I have divorced the Colonel, Marcel
Beaucourt is nothing more to me than
a friend. After all, one must talk to a
friend somewhere.
Enter Monseigneur Jussey.
Monique. I was just saying, Monseig-
neur, that I am going to divorce my
husband and marry Marcel.
Monseigneur. I suppose you know the
Church doesn't approve of that sort of
thing? I only mention it because the
play has been advertised as containing

you hadn't suspected of coming into

Glogau. I will now tell you the story
of your life. (Does so at great length.)
To sum up, you owe a hundred thousand
francs, which you've got to pay by
Saturday, and you can't do it.

Felt. You'll scream all right when
I’ve told you something.
Monique. What is it?

Monique. Well, why don't you tell

THE PIONEERS.
“Look at that l” said my wife
triumphantly, pointing to a paragraph
in the paper. “Read it aloud. It is
just what we want.”
I read it aloud.
“4:50. Why rent a house in a stuffy
suburb 2 Why, not buy one of our
magnificent building-plots, overlooking
the sea, and own your own house?
Close to station and prospective golf-
links. Sea-bathing. Bracing air. Select

£50.” -
“I love bathing,” said Mary en-
thusiastically, “and you love golf.”
“I have never tried prospective golf,"
I replied, “unless it means the round
one is going to do under bogey next
time.” * *
“Fifty pounds isn't much,” con-
tinued Mary. “We pay lots more
than that in rent already." '
“They've forgotten to mention the
cost of building the house and the
price of the season ticket,” I remarked
as I turned up Worley-on-Sea in
Bradshaw.
“But each plot is guaranteed to
double itself in five years,” she read
out triumphantly.
“Ah!” I said, “that's all right if
your plot starts first. What happens
if you suddenly find your neighbour's
plot spreading itself over your tennis-
court 2" -
“Don't be absurd," said Mary.
“Fifty. A hundred. Two hundred.
Four hundred. Light hundred. Six-
teen hundred. What does twice that
come to ?” - -
“Bankruptcy.
ruptcy.”
But Mary had already seized a pencil
and piece of paper.
“In sixty years that land will be
worth £204,800 ! That can't be right.”
| “It hasn't the ring of truth about
it certainly,” I admitted, glancing at
the advertisement. “But the philan-
thropist who is selling it only says it
| will double in five years—not every
| five years. Still, it's uncommonly
good of him to sell it even then. Some
men would have stuck to that property
like grim death.”
“Perhaps he is going abroad,” sug-
gested Mary.
“They do frequently,” I replied.

As we followed the agent across a
rather badly kept hay-field I stumbled
over a stone and fell into a layer of old

“Ah,” he remarked cheerily, “that

“What is?" I asked, rubbing my
knees.
“You fell over the kerb-stone. We
always put down the kerb-stones and
foundations before we lay the road.
You won't know the place in a year's
time.” - - - -
“I am sure I shan't,” I agreed
heartily. “But why do you grow hay
and thistles all over Acacia Road 2 Is
it for the benefit of the tradesmen's
horses and for itinerant costers? Do
you get itinerant costers at Worley-
on-Sea 2"
“We have a sample section of road

Agent.
“By-the-way,”

“The Wendor.”
“Yes; but who pays for it?"
“The-er—the Purchaser. You see
it comes cheaper if it's all laid down
in one piece.”
“I see. We wait till all the land is
taken up. How many plots have you
sold, so far?”
“To you, Sir–and Madam—will be-
long the honour, I hope, of being the
oldest inhabitants of Worley-on-Sea.”
“Oh,” said Mary doubtfully.
“We came early to avoid the rush,”
I explained.
“I congratulate you,” said the Agent
heartily.
“Yes. I think we have avoided it
marvellously well. I haven't seen an
rush anywhere. Have you, Mary 2 " .
“But to-morrow morning,” sug-
gested the Agent.
“One never knows,” I assented.
“That's what I thought when I read
your advertisement last month.”
“Last month !” said Mary reproach-
fully, “and you never told me! Think
what we might have lost l” -
“No, no, think what we haven't
lost,” I replied. “The grass and other
crops have come on splendidly in the
last month. We should not have
appreciated half so fully the wonderful
fertility of Acacia Road. Why, it was
then clad solely in an undervest of old
tomato cans and gallipots.” -
“Where is the bathing?" enquired
Mary.
“In the sea, Madam.” The Agent
spoke with pride. He seemed to let
himself go on that statement. For
once he could make an announcement
that was unimpeachable.
“Is it a real sea 2 " I asked. “With
genuine waves 2 " I was becoming
more suspicious at every step.
I said, “who lays
plied the Agent brusquely. “The best
plots are those by the cliffs.”
“Is it necessary to trouble him 2 "
whispered Mary in my ear.
“Of course it is,” I replied with
enthusiasm. “I am charmed with the
quaint unconventionality of the place.
We must certainly have a week-end
cottage down here.”
I am usually a truthful person. But
I know Mary. For my future peace it
was necessary that she should refuse
to live there. Moreover, she did de-
serve some small retribution for those
two horrible train journeys.
“What is this street called ?” I
enquired as I landed full length on
another strip of tomato cans.
“It has not been named yet.
can call it what you like.”
“Then—” I began.
“Grosvenor Crescent,” interrupted
Mary hastily.
“It is hardly a crescent,” objected
the Agent politely. “If you could
follow the line of the kerb-stones you
would see that they run straight up
the hill.”
“Avernus Avenue,” I suggested.
“Excellent ' The other roads are
all called after flowers too. The plot
which I think will suit you is just at
the top of the Avenue.”
We followed him there without
further parley. Avernus Avenue was
quite a noisy thoroughfare.
“Here you are,” said the Agent,
proudly waving his arm in a vague
semicircle.
Mary remained silent save for the
quietest variety of sniff.
“Delightful!” I cried. “I suppose
we could uproot those four little tomb-
stones, though 2 One would always
be tripping up if one built the pantry
over them.”
“Those,” replied our guide with
dignity, “are the boundary stones of
that piece or parcel of land described
as a plot.”
“Parcel, please—it is the better
word, isn't it? That will do excellently
for the dog-kennel. But,” I explained
to him confidentially, “my wife and I
had intended to build a house on to
one side of it—so that we could be at
hand to look after the dog.”
“If that plot isn't large enough, you
can always take in one or two of the
adjoining ones. Make quite a pretty
little estate of it.”
“But where is the sea?" cried
Mary. “I can only see miles and
miles of mud | " -

visit. The tide is out at the moment.”

“You could build a neat little wooden
staircase down the cliff,” he suggested.
“Don't stand too near the edge, Madam,
it is not safe after these rains.”
“You haven't any movable plots, I
suppose—ones that we could shift back
as the cliff falls away? This kind
which only moves downwards has its
drawbacks.” I pointed to a sole sur-
viving little boundary mark which stood
by the cliff edge.
“Years before it will reach your
plot,” said the Agent.
“And then 2" asked Mary.
“Then the property doubles in
value," I explained, “because we can
bathe from the front door instead of
having to go down a neat little wooden
staircase. Why, at high tide we could
bathe actually inside the house.”
“Then shut the front door and pick
up the fish as the tide went down,”
she snapped. “Let's get some lunch
and go back home.”
“There is a free luncheon for pur-
chasers at the ‘Merry Congers,’”
hinted the Agent.
“We will leave it this way,” I replied.

II— n
“No, we won't,” said Mary firmly,
“not even if our lunch at the ‘Merry
Congers' comes to over fifty pounds.”
AT THE PLAY.
“THE LITTLE CAFE.”
I HAVE never seen a programme
with so many names on it, or a play
which depended so much upon the
efforts of one man. “Albert Loriflan—
Mr. CYRIL MAUDE'' heads the cast of
forty-five, and, as far as I am concerned,
ends it.
Albert was a waiter who came un-
expectedly into money. You may have
noticed that on the stage all sorts of
people come unexpectedly into money,
whereas in real life— However, I
need not go into that now. Albert's
proprietor, hearing the news of the
legacy before Albert, persuaded the
latter to bind himself to remain at the
Little Café for twenty years, in the
expectation that, when Albert heard of
his fortune, he would pay a large fine
to be let off his agreement. But
Albert, , half-Scotch, is not by any
means for paying a fine, and he remains
on—a waiter at the Little Café from
8 A.M. to 1 A.M., a gentleman at the
Café Fifine from 1 A.M. to 8 A.M.
Those of you who have observed that
gentlemen and waiters wear the same
clothes will be able to guess the amus-
ing complications which ensue. Mr.
CYRIL MAUDE is very funny over it all;
M.THISTAN BERNARD, the author, is also
funny as Mr. MAUDE. He seems to
have been rather careless about it—to
have missed many good things and not
to have followed up others.
Well, the two plays I have seen this
week have both been translations from
the French—at the Playhouse and at the
St. James's Theatre; but I feel singu-

STRAIGHT QUESTIONS AND
CROOKED ANSWERS.
[“During his short stay at Holyhead Mr.
Churchill enjoyed a º ramble among the
rocks at Porth Dafarch.
The First Lord was seen to be busily occu-
pied in digging the sand with a small spade,
and he was asked whether he was in search of
anything.
‘Oh, no,” he replied smilingly, “I am merely
amusing myself.’”—Evening News.]
UNDER the guise of innocent amuse-
ments, His MAJESTY's Ministers have
been hatching all sorts of mischief in
the Recess. In every instance, as will
be seen from the following reports,
evasive and often impertinent answers
were given to the perfectly proper and
natural questions of our representative.
While up at Dornoch recently, Mr.
McKENNA was seen wielding a peculiar-
looking stick with an iron head which
stuck out at right angles to the shaft.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
LADY DoRothy NEVILL is a prized possession bequeathed
by the nineteenth century to the twentieth. As an earlier
popular work from her pen testifies, she has lived under
five Sovereigns and has been personally known certainly to
three. In her new book, My Own Times (METHUEN), she goes
back over a period of three-score years, pleasantly chatting
by the way of persons and places she has known. Amon
many others the former include DISRAELI, NAPOLEoN III.,
Count D'ORSAY, Prince EstERHAzY “murmuring compli-
ments through the most perfect of his sets of teeth; ”
THACKERAY's Lord Steyne, and Sir RICHARD WALLACE,
ultimate heritor of the wicked marquis. Modest amid
memories of many advantages, Lady DoRothy most nearly
touches the boastful mood when she surmises that she is
probably “one of the very few alive who has shaken hands
with the Duke of Wellington.” Of these personages she
gossips brightly and briskly, enabling a later generation
almost to see them in the
characteristic) and wit (only very rarely fading into face-
tiousness), which the author seems increasingly to have at
command. Trafford and Marjorie work out their salvation
not without sacrifice and bitterness of spirit. They finally
seek together in the loneliness of a solitary hut in far
Labrador the chance of “getting away from things” and
“talking things out.” They come back with new strength
and new knowledge born of dangers encountered, to take up
the struggle which is the inevitable price of real success.
It is an invigorating piece of work. The “creative and
illuminating phrases,” “the breadths, the spacious emo-
tions” are here, and more packed thought than would
suffice to quicken a dozen normal novels. Mr. WELLs'
method has shaped itself into a completely effective instru-
ment of artistic presentation. Could anything be better
than the short vigorous selected pieces of dialogue, the
salient successive episodes painted in with swift, sure
strokes? And between them the judicious, never wearisome
passages of comment, observation, speculation. A book as
alive, as challenging, as courageous as a monoplane in flight,
flesh and hear them speak.
CHARLEs DICKENs illumined
the old coaching days with
the glow of his genius. Lady
DoRo THY, who suffered
them as a girl, in a few
graphic passages reveals
their wretchedness and the
misery of their hapless pas-
sengers. Coming to later
days, she laments the degra-
dation of modern politics
compared with the good old
times when the genuine
Tory flourished and ruled
the roost. The modern
Radical pleases her not, nor
the halting Unionist either.
With the latter, as more
nearly representing her own
class, she is the angrier.

and not the less courageous
because the pilot refrains
from his old irresponsible
habit of bomb-dropping—
a habit which, I confess, has
always a certain attraction
for those of us who are not
underneath.
When the experienced
novel-reader catches sight
of an attractive MILLs AND
Boon publication bearing
the inscription, The Five of
Spades, he will jump to the
conclusion that someone has
been cheating at cards.
When he has been allowed
to begin reading but never
to finish a letter, and this at
the very start, which only
too clearly implicates Simon
Armytage, he will go further
with whips, she chastises
the Unionists with scorpions. A curious blot on an excellent
piece of literary workmanship is an unaccountable habit of
peppering the pages with anecdotes, many of them not
even d propos des bottes, most of them having lived through
more reigns than Lady DoRothy herself. The book will be
vastly improved if, before the second edition appears, these
excrescences are removed. As they have nothing to do
with the text the process would be easy.
. . In Mr. H. G. WELLs' new novel, Marriage (MACMILLAN),
the union in chief between Marjorie Pope, still an under-
graduate, and the young scientist, Trafford, who drops
with his aeroplane on to the Popes' croquet lawn, is an
essentially happy one, threatened as time goes on with
little rifts of misunderstanding which the vision and courage
of the principals contrive to close. There is an earlier
marriage, that of Marjorie's parents, which gives the author
occasion to lash with a savage conviction the pompous
tyranny of the preposterous retired coach-builder and the
battered, mistaken loyalty of his kindly wife. And there
was the marriage of convenience which was arranged
and did not take place between Marjorie and Magnet, the
too conscious professional humourist with the very com-
fortable income and the hateful proprietary airs. Each is
and guess that, whoever
else cheated, it was not Simon Armytage. (In my opinion,
the fellow deserved all he got, except his happy ending, for
writing that “his heart prompted him to make a clean
breast” of someone else's sin.) And when all the conversa-
tion, wise or flippant, turns upon the respective tendencies,
moral and intellectual, of the sexes, he will expect to have
it borne in on him from time to time how little men under-
stand women, how little women understand men, but how
thoroughly the author (Mrs. PHILIP CHAMPION DECRESPIGNY)
and, by inference, himself understand both. Later on,
though the taking and loading of guns may have for its
alleged purpose nothing more sinister than the destruction
of a pheasant or two, he will anticipate that the shooting
does not end there; and on the sudden arrival of the three
principal and most involved characters upon the precipitous
cliffs of Sark, dangerously near the edge, he will be on the
look out for a horrible but not inopportune accident. None
the less, since the book is so good of its kind, let him buy'
it with all confidence and he shall not be disappointed
in the reading. I myself got such satisfaction from it as
prevents me grudging the author a recommendation, even
if I cannot wholly support, on mere human grounds, her.

“Not with hats every time,” said Francesca. “The first
time was with that ducky little story about the dog who up-

of the American dry-goods millionaire and his two sons.”

“Then why,” said Francesca, “did you suggest that we
ought to have a new rose-garden?" -
“Francesca,” I said, “I refuse to be cross-purposed by
anyone. You are reading a newspaper. I am writing im-
portant letters. If you insist on reading me tit-bits out of
your paper I shall retaliate by reading you choice parts of
my letters.” t -
“But, dearest,” said Francesca, “I should simply love to
hear your letters. Do not be afraid of me. I shall not find
them dull. I can sympathise even with letters to solicitors
and find poetry in instructions to a stockbroker. Try me.”
She assumed an attitude of devout and eager attention.

with the details of my business. All I ask is that you
should refrain from breaking in on me with your news-

I said, “understands how to read a newspaper.” -

poor sister-women. Have I not proved it to you? Or
shall I read you the thrilling account of the negro family in
Jamaica who possess a pet cow with two heads?”

superficial. I mean something far deeper than the mere
power of reading nonsense in a loud voice.”
“No, no,' she pleaded, “not loud. Soft, gentle and low,
an excellent thing in woman. And as to nonsense, is that
my fault 2."
“When a woman,” I said, “gets a newspaper, the first
thing she does is to separate it into three or four sheets.

HE's small for his years but as sharp as a needle,
Accustomed to traffic before he could crawl;
He's a militant shrimp, and, like most of his breed,'ll
Lay odds on a dog-fight or street-corner brawl;
His cap and his elbows show symptoms of fraying,
With slippery, clattering hob-nails he's shod;
He clings to his perch where the boxes are swaying,
The van is his home and the carman his god.
His brain is alert, his anatomy plastic,
He has to nip back to his place how he can,
By dodges and tricks that are slim and gymnastic,
When left in the lurch by the vanishing van;
But he, like the rest of his nimble fraternity,
Finds smartness and knack as effective as strength,
And, with only a rope between him and eternity,
Climbs over the tailboard, outstretched at full length.
From the streets he has garnered a broad education,
A censor of fashion, his sarcasms sting;
He has his ideas on the fate of the nation,
But keeps a soft place in his heart for the KING;
“'E's got work to do, an' 'e don't do it badly,
'E can't lay about all the day more 'n me;
'Is job ain't a soft one; although,” he adds sadly,
“'E can 'ave a relish each day to 'is tea.”
His hours are too long and his future precarious,
Each week he assists with the family rent;
Domestic appeals to his pocket are various,
Though biograph shows are his favourite bent;
His earnings are small but his appetite's healthy,
He's a robin for pluck when the weather is bad;
In short—here's a word to the wise and the wealthy—
arm-chair.”

THE HYPOTHETICAL MOUSE.
MR. J. M. BARRIE recently wrote a letter to a newspaper
upon a question relating to his new play at the Duke of
York's Theatre, in which he said: “All this must be about
as interesting to the general public as the appearance of a
mouse in Bond Street, but perhaps you will kindly find
space for it.” The inference is that such an event would
afford little if any interest to the British public.
It is difficult to understand how Mr. BARRIE, who was a
journalist himself in days gone by, can hold this opinion
(writes our Grub Street correspondent). The explanation
is, perhaps, that he was a journalist in the days before
journalism was what it is. The story of the invasion of
Bond Street by a mouse, in competent hands, could be
made truly a journalistically touching one, placing news of
war, of Parliament, and of other commonplaces in secondary
positions.
Such incidents, of course, never come my way. But I
must not be bitter; I have already had the good fortune
this week to witness a nasty cab accident and to have a
chat with a released convict who lamed a policeman for
life; and I must not complain. But to be in Bond Street,
with my fountain pen and camera, when a mouse appeared—
that is the kind of good fortune I dream of. If the dream
came true, I would go and live in the sunshine for a month,
and reduce my debts with whatever was left of my gains.
Think of the pathos that might be introduced into a
faithful description of the adventures among motor wheels
and horses' hoofs of what BURNs so truly called a “wee
beastie" | I would see to it that a duchess's coachman
should rein in his prancing steeds in mid-stream to let the
stroke it, and a pet poodle should be righteously run over
in just reward for trying to capture it. An aged road-
sweeper, overcome by the memories it aroused of his dear
old home in a Somerset village, should burst into tears at
sight of it; a well-known actress should climb on to a
brewer's dray and scream with fear of it; a bronzed and
battered hero, immaculately dressed, should twirl his
moustache and smile indulgently at it; a ragged and tender-
hearted newsboy should punch in the nose the youthful
scion of a noble house for striking at it with his governess's
umbrella; and a burly policeman should take the tiny timid
creature in his huge hand and place it gently within the
door of the pastrycook's shop whither it was evidently
bound. Then the street should resume its everyday aspect
of busy gaiety, as if nothing had happened; yet out of sight
there should be many a heart lighter and many an eye
brighter for the pretty incident.
Why, it is just the sort of thing that the general public
wants to happen. As a matter of fact, I shouldn't be sur-
prised if, when the sunshine is calling very sweetly and the
duns are desperately thick, I take some pains to provide
them with it.

MUSICAL NOTES.
THE immerse success achieved by the
modernised versions of standard works
at the recent Birmingham Festival has
prompted other conductors and com-
posers to follow the inspiring example of
the HANDEL-Wood and BACH-WooD
partnership. Thus it is reported that
Mr. JIMMY GLovER is busily engaged on
a revision of MozART's Requiem for the
Drury Lane Pantomime, and those who
have been fortunate enough to hear
portions of the score describe it as a
masterpiece of melodious jocularity.
The achievement is all the more re-
markable because MozART, as is well
known, had a most uncompromising
contempt for anything that savoured
of piffle, tosh or even balderdash.
Dahomey, where he gave a recital
before 1,000 Amazons, the King testified
his appreciation by hanging a priceless
boa constrictor round Mr. BAMBERGER's
neck, to the consternation of Mrs. BAM-
BERGER and her father, Sir Pompey
Boldero, who accompanied his son-in-
law on the tour.
In Patagonia, again, the King, or
Kong as he is called, pressed upon him
a stuffed giant sloth, the skin of which
now forms Mrs. BAMBERGER's fourth-
best motor-rug. Perhaps the most
embarrassing of these attentions was
the honour conferred on the great artist
in the Solomon Islands, when fifty
native musical critics were handed over
to him as table delicacies. Another
difficult situation had to be faced in
kangaroo by a single Boy Scout as a
greater tribute to native artistic ex-
cellence than the scores of living
gorillas, ostriches and other formidable
monsters with which I have been pre-
sented on my tours round the world?
The evidence is incontestable, as many
of them are now safely housed at the
Zoological Gardens, and in every case
I was careful to send full details to the
local press. Any one who cares' to
consult the files of The Lhasa Daily
Mirror, The Archangel Daily Mail, The
Patagonian Spectator, or The Hairy
Aino Gazette will find these incidents
set forth with a wealth of particularity
which beggars scepticism.

may prove to be an
intelligent anticipation of what will
ultimately take place, since Mr. RUBENs
has a hereditary interest in the works
of old masters.
The rash statement made by a con-
temporary, that the presentation to
Madame MELBA, at her recent concert
in the Albert Hall, of a floral tribute in
the shape of a kangaroo, was an un-
precedented incident in the annals of
adulation, has elicited a dignified protest
from Mr. MAx BAMBERGER. He points
out that the assertion is wholly un-
pardonable in view of the far more
honorific presentations made to him
repeatedly during his career as a
travelling virtuoso. Thus, on the oc-
casion of his second visit to Lhasa, the
DALAI LAMA presented him with a
magnificent sacred yak, which Mr.
BAMBERGER trained to play duets with
him, but which was unhappily
killed by a rhinoceros given him by
Archangel, where the GoverNor be-
stowed on Mr. BAMBERGER the remains
of a mammoth which had recently been
dug out of a glacier. Mr. BAMBERGER
had to dispose of it rapidly by fire, but
preserved the skeleton, which he sub-
sequently presented to Sir HENRY
Howorth, in whose back garden it is
now a conspicuous ornament. At
Krugersdorp Mr. BAMBERGER's grand
pianoforte was hauled from the station
to the concert-hall by forty ostriches,
while at Seattle he was serenaded by a
band of twenty-five tame seals.
So far we have contented ourselves
with a bald summary of Mr. BAM-
BERGER's manifesto, but the concluding
paragraph must be given in his own
words:—“Could anything,” he asks,
“more convincingly expose the incom-
petence or the utter lack of all sense
of proportion shown by British musical
critics than this ludicrous attempt to

IV.-JAMAICA.
SoMEwHERE in the vicinity of the
Americas is a string of islands known
as the West Indies. Owing to an
oversight, several of these do not belong
to Britain ; but at least we can con-
gratulate ourselves on possessing the
most picturesque, the most West Indian
and the most interesting—Jamaica.
It is also the most intensely patriotic
of all the West Indies and very rarely
rebels.
Jamaica is noted principally for its
plagues. There never was such a place
for plagues. First of all it was rats,
and the merry rodents increased and
multiplied at such a rate that the
prosperity of the country was in serious
jeopardy. So they imported a few
cases of snakes, which were guaranteed
to exterminate rats. The contract was


the Emperor MENELIK. Again at

regard the gift of a single floral

years, though there were no rats, there
was a plague of snakes. So they im-
ported a cargo of mongooses (or
mongeese), and in a very little while
there were no snakes, but there was a
plague of mongeese (or mongooses).
;| So they imported a few dozen cats, and
very soon there were no mongooses (or
mongeese) but there was a plague of
cats. So they imported some dogs—
but why pursue the subject further?
Suffice to say that at present there is
something of a plague of prosperity,
and they are thinking of importing
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE. -
The inhabitants of Jamaica are very
sunburnt for the most part, and
habitually dress in bright - coloured
prints and large straw hats. The
ladies wear very short skirts, and the
gentlemen carry banjos. With the
influence of the Southern States of
America strong upon them, their man-
ners are of the most courtly, and
offences against etiquette are practically
unknown. In this connection it is
interesting to note that the people have
been at a great disadvantage during the
past few years, when compared with
their more fortunate brethren elsewhere.
Bananas are the staple crop of the
land; but, as any form of “shop" is
held to be in the worst of taste, the
inhabitants are debarred from the
fascinating amusement of asking each
other to have one. -
In the Bad Old Days, most of the
inhabitants of Jamaica were slaves and
had to work for nothing. When they
were liberated, their former employers
offered them three or four times as
much, but they utterly refused to do any
more toil. They maintained that they
had seen the dignity of labour, and
that they really did not think very
much of it. Thus little work was done,
and everybody was quite contented.
The favourite pastimes in Jamaica
are playing the banjo and dancing.
At night, when the heat of the day is
past and the moon am shining, then
the old buck nigger he comes out and
serenades his little honey gal. He sits
on a very black tree with very green
foliage, and thrums away at the old
banjo, while the little honey gal, clad
in a wide-brimmed hat, a short, red-
and-white-striped skirt, and an expan-
sive smile, joins in the chorus and
does fancy steps. It is all very charm-
ing and simple, and on the way home
the buck nigger can always loot
somebody's fowl-roost and so combine
business with pleasure. . -
Jamaica is noted for its ginger. It
grows in small clear glass bottles, and
is quite expensive. Other countries
have tried to cultivate it, but Jamaica

the island which does not produce

of the banana and the cocoanut. The
last-named is so plentiful that at the
local fairs plain wooden balls are put

that they are retailed in the streets of

very striking fashion some idea of their

THE TRUTH ABOUT HOME RAILS.
IMAGINE us, if you can, sitting one on
each side of the fire, I with my feet on
the mantelpiece, Margery curled up in
the blue arm-chair, both of us intent on
the morning paper. To me, by good
chance, has fallen the sporting page;
to Margery the foreign, political and
financial intelligence of the day.
“What,” said Margery, “does it
mean when it says ” She stopped
and spelt it over to herself again.
I put down my piece of the paper and
prepared to explain. The desire for
knowledge in the young cannot be too
strongly encouraged, and I have always
flattered myself that I can explain in
perfectly simple language anything
which a child wants to know. For
instance, I once told Margery what
“Miniature Rifle Shooting” meant; it
was a head-line which she had come
across in her paper. The explanation
took some time, owing to Margery's pre-
conceived idea that a bird entered into
it somewhere; several times, when I
thought the lesson was over, she said,
“Well, what about the bird 2 " But I
think I made it plain to her in the end,
though maybe she has forgotten about
it now.
“What,” said Margery, “does it
mean when it says “Home Rails
Firm’ 2 ''
I took up my paper again. The
Springboks, I was glad to see, were
rapidly developing into a first-class
team, and—
“‘Home Rails Firm,’”
Margery, and looked up at me.
My mind worked rapidly, as it always
does in a crisis.
“What did you say?” I asked in
surprise.
“What does “Home Rails Firm '
mean 2"
“Where does it say that ?” I went
on, still thinking at lightning speed.
“There. It said it yesterday too.”
“Ah, yes.” I made up my mind.
“Well, that,” I said—“I think that is
something you must ask your father.”
“I did ask him yesterday.”
“Well, then—”
“He told me to ask Mummy.”
Coward | -
“You can be sure,” I said firmly,
“that what Mummy told you would be
right,” and I returned to my paper.
“Mummy told me to wait till you
repeated
| came.”
Really, these parents' The way they
| shirk their responsibilities nowadays is
disgusting.
“‘Home Rails Firm,’” said Margery,
and settled herself to listen.
It is good that children should be
affairs of the day, but I do think that a
little girl might be taught by its father
(or if more convenient, mother) which
part of a newspaper to read. Had
Margery asked me the difference
between a Springbok and a Sanjak,
had she demanded an explanation of
“ultimatum" or “guillotine,” I could
have done something with it; but to let
a child of six fill her head with ideas as
to the firmness or otherwise of Home
Rails is hardly nice. However, an
explanation had to be given.
“Well, it's like this, Margery,” I said
at last. “Supposing—well, you see,
supposing—that is to say, if I ” and
then I stopped. I had a sort of feeling
—intuition, they call it—that I was
beginning in the wrong way.
“Go on,” said Margery.
“Perhaps I had better put it this
way. Supposing you were to- Well,
we'd better begin further back than
that. You know what— No, I don't
suppose you do know that. Well, if I
—that is to say, when a man—you know,
it's rather difficult to explain this,
Margery.”
“Are you explaining it now 2"
“I'm just going to begin.”
“Thank you, uncle.”
I lit my pipe slowly, while I con-
sidered again how best to approach the
matter.
“‘Home Rails Firm,’” said Margery.
“Isn't it a funny thing to say?”
It was. It was a very silly thing to
say. Whoever said it first might have
known what it would lead to.
“Perhaps I can explain it best like
this, Margery,” I said, beginning on a
new tack. “I suppose you know what
“firm' means ?”
“What does it mean 2"
“Ah, well, if you don't know that,”
I said, rather pleased, “perhaps I had
better explain that first. ‘Firm’
means that—that is to say, you call a
thing firm if it—well, if it doesn't—
that is to say, a thing is firm if it can't
'move.”
“Like a house.”
“Well, something like that. This
chair, for instance,” and I put my hand
on her chair, “is firm because you can't
shake it. You see, it's quite— Hallo,
what's that ?”
“Oh, you bad uncle, you've knocked
the castor off again,” cried Margery,
greatly excited at the incident.
“This is too much,” I said bitterly.
“Even the furniture is against me.”
“Go on explaining,” said Margery,
rocking herself in the now wobbly chair.
I decided to leave “firm.” It is not
an easy word to explain at the best of
times, and when everything you touch
goes and breaks itself it becomes
“Well, so much for that,” I said."
“And now we come to “rails.' You'
know what rails are 2" :
“Like I've got in the nursery 2"
This was splendid. I had forgotten
these for the moment.
“Exactly. The rails your train goes
on. Well then, “Home Rails' would
be rails at home.” -
“Well, I've got them at home,” said
Margery in surprise. “I couldn't have
them anywhere else.” :
“Quite so. Then “Home Rails Firm’
would mean that—er—home rails were
—er—firm."
“But mine aren't, because they
wobble. You know they do.”
“Yes, but—” .
“Well, why do they say “Home
Rails Firm’ when they mean ‘Home
Rails Wobble'?” -
“Ah, that's just it. The point is
that when they say Home Rails
Firm,' they don't mean that the rails
themselves are firm. In fact, they
don't mean at all what you think they
mean. They mean something quite
different.” -
“What do they mean 2"
“I am just going to explain,” I said
stiffly.
-: :: -- + +
“Or perhaps I had better put it this
way,” I said ten minutes later. “Sup-
posing— Oh, Margery, it is difficult
to explain.” -
“I must know,” said Margery.
“Why do you want to know so
badly?”
“I want to know a million million
times more than anything else in the
whole world.”
“Why?"
“So as I can tell Angela,” said
Margery.
I plunged into my explanation again.
Angela is three, and I can quite see
how important it is that she should be
sound on the question. A. A. M.

RECOLLECTIONS.
I KNEw very well that I had never
seen him before. I am rather given to
boasting that I never forget a face, and
if I had only had enough faith to hold
on to that I should have been all right.
But when he came up to the motor
which was to convey us both from the
station to my uncle's house some twelve
miles distant, I could see at once that'
he was bent upon recognising me. I
had been on the point of formally
introducing myself, according to a use-
ful Teutonic custom that I learned as
a student at Bonn, but he instantly
swept all that aside, grasped my hand,
and told me not to “pull his leg”—an

expression, by the way, that I strongly

fitted in all right, for I too used to play
Rugby for Blackheath. Naturally he
went on to enlarge upon this common
topic. Did I remember the match
against the London Scottish when
Waterhouse was hurt in the first five
minutes and Hopkins had to play half?
No, I didn't remember anything at all
about it, and furthermore—though I
didn't tell him so—I didn't remember
either Waterhouse or Hopkins. He
went on in the same strain. I was
asked in turn to recall occasions when

not go on any longer meeting his
friendly advances with a stony negative.
I was becoming a positive wet blanket.
Conversation would soon have been

that if one has any sense of decency.
After that we got on swimmingly.
Perhaps I threw myself into the thing
with a little too much gusto, but I felt
that I had arrears to make up. Not
only did I remember Balfour, but I
had dined with him not long ago and
he had told me that he was just sailing
for Valparaiso. Then I recalled with
him every detail of the remarkable
dinner that had followed the Leicester

last year, don't you think so?”
Last year! That pulled me up pretty
short, for I had not played for Black-
heath since 1906. And then I saw it.
The fellow had mistaken me for my
brother Colin! There was an awkward
pause, for I began to reflect that I had

DEAR SIR, when several weeks ago
The perfect orb in heaven was hung
Of Dian wandering to and fro
Thessalian woods among,
When fast by many a forest glade
The hunt was up, and houndsobeyed
The horn-blast of the buskined maid,
I did not weep when your decayed
Old rag-bag too gave tongue.
I flung my window casement wide:
O'er flood and fen, o'er field and bog
I seemed to see the huntress stride,
Her silvery rout agog,
Through beech and fir and pine-
wood stem,
And though the time was 2 A.M.
I listed powerless to condemn
A beast howe'er so slightly rem-
Iniscent of a dog.
“Poor chap,” I thought, “it well may be
Some shadowy vision stirs within,
Some memory of the uplands free
And copses loud with din,
Of sires who from some moated
grange •
Would sally forth the woods to

Enkindled underneath the mange
That pies his odorous skin.

That bids him bay the virgin moon,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted Fito M THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Oct. 7.
—There's no getting round LAURENCE
GINNELL, Member for North West-
meath. If he never read another paper
to the listening Senate he would live in
Parliamentary history by reason of the
manoeuvre whereby he dominated the
present House even before it was fully
equipped by election of SPEAKER. Mr.
LowthER having been nominated to
the Chair, the motion seconded amid
acclaim, up gat GINNELL with volumin-
ous notes in hand. Proceeded to read
denunciation of proposed Speaker in-
asmuch as during previous parliaments
he had, in spite of all temptation, never
once caught his (GINNELD's) eye.
Crowded House aghast. Assembled
to do honour to one of the select among
Speakers of modern times, here was a
Member making personal attack upon
him. Worst of it was GINNELL was
master of the situation. There being
no mace on the Table, no Speaker in the
Chair, no Deputy appointed, authority
to check unruly Members was non-
existent. On this the wily G. had
counted, and fully enjoyed fruition of
his foresight. Since the autumn nights
when he used to defend cattle-driving,
to the detriment of grazing farmers in
the Irish Midlands and the despair of
CHIEF SECRETARY, had never had such
a good time.
Little heard of him since. To-day,
House re-assembling after brief recess,
he suddenly, unexpectedly, comes to
the fore. A sort of Parliamentary
Brer Rabbit, at a moment when cir-
cumstances seemed to presage
his final discomfiture, he is dis-
covered quietly, doggedly
dominant.
Only nineteen questions on
paper and GINNELL not num-
bered in the list. CHARLE's
BATHURST well to the front
with four. Hopelessly beaten
by the MAD HATTER, who has
five, representing more than
25 per cent. of the curiosity of
assembled House. Actually his
several in terrogations,
subdivided under general head-
ings, number thirteen. House
with quickened interest observes
that during Recess he has pene-
trated a new district, assumed
championship of fresh client.
Particulars set forth in inquiry
addressed to the languid LULU,
desiring to know “whether he
has received a petition from
Ifawibe, the onion or head chief
of Ibon, in Southern Nigeria;
returned; and whether Ifawibe will be
restored to his seat of authority at
Ibon.”
(Beg pardon. On looking again at
the question find that, led astray by
familiar associations, misread a word.
“To the fore again.”
(Mr. LAURENCE GINNELL.)
“Onibon" is the head chief, not
“onion.”)
Questions on paper disposed of, there
arose from quarter where Irish Members
dwell together in unity a tall figure up-
lifting countenance of funereal gravity.
In right hand it held sheaf of manu-
script. As he proceeded to read from this,
House recognised GINNELL, wanting to

know about precautionary measures
taken by Board of Agriculture in view
of foot and mouth disease in Ireland.
This and batch of Supplementary
Questions answered by RUNCIMAN, a
happy thought struck GINNELL.
“Will the House allow me,” he said,
“to ask the right honourable gentleman
a question I have asked him already?"
No : the House drew the line at this
indulgence, and Member for North
Westmeath slowly subsided.
Other business interposed. GINNELL
forgotten, when familiar voice was
heard from below Gangway, and lo!
there he was again with another short
paper, this time read for the benefit of
ST. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL, “to whom,”
he remarked, “I have given private
notice of the question.”
Here the wiliness of Westmeath
comes in. Ordinary Member desirous
| of cross-examining a Minister hands
text of question to Clerk at Table. In
due course it is printed. But it may
not be read aloud. Is referred to simply

Noble Lord has not fully attained
the martial air natural to his learned
friend the Chieftain. But he was smart
and soldierly. Opposition quickly caught
on. An iniquitous Government, anxious
to save public time, had lumped two
proposals together in order to dispose
of them by one division. If they were
submitted as one Resolution delay in
approaching business would be halved.
SPEAKER consenting to make two bites

sult that Ministerial majority was run

This rather a damper; but at least
there would be two more divisions.
BANBURY having, so to speak, tasted
blood, wanted “some more in a moog.”
Moved amendment restricting suspen-
sion of eleven-o'clock rule to to-day's
sitting. This insisted upon would raise
number of divisions to three. LLoyd
GEORGE, in charge of affairs in tempo-
rary absence of PREMIER, did a little
sum in mental arithmetic. If he re-
sisted BANBURY's amendment there
would be a division involving loss of
quarter-of-an-hour. If he accepted it it
would be necessary to-morrow to move
a resolution suspending the rule. There
would, of course, then be a division.
But if he now proved obdurate a division
was inevitable. Thus the balance was
struck. Accordingly when BANBURY,
after impassioned appeal, resumed his
seat, CHANCELLOR, protesting himself
convinced, accepted amendment.
House roared with laughter at sight
of BANBURY's look of amazement
and disgust at this concession.
Thought he was opening a spicy
debate that might last an hour
and make an extra division. And
here he was getting all he'd asked
for, patted on the back, told to be a

OxFord is naturally interested in the
coming of a British Prince who last
week wrote his name in the college
books. Those who only know Oxford
from seeing Charley's Aunt will
scarcely realize the difficulties of the
PRINCE's advisers in determining just
how far he may enter into University
life. The PRINCE will be treated as
an ordinary commoner, like all other
undergraduates except exhibitioners and
demies. (The demies, it is stated, will
be kept strictly in the background
during the PRINCE's stay, as it is not
| considered advisable that he should
make acquaintance with the demies'
monde). The difficult question of
“soccer,” as the Oxford breakfast is
called (from the fact that slippers being
the rule there is a liberal display of
fancy socks), has been solved in this
way. The PRINCE will not invite men
to “soccer" in his own rooms, but will
meet them at “battels” in the ordinary
way. If he plays billiards in a public
room before one or ten and is caught
in the act by the “scout” (a sort of
University detective) he will have to go
to “bedder” early for a week, just like
every other Magdalen man. A good
deal of nonsense has been written to
the effect that the PRINCE will not be
allowed to indulge in the ordinary
college sports. As a matter of fact he
will take up just such sports as
he pleases, and, though perhaps
rather light for a helmsman, I
should not be surprised to see him
sculling in the college “Ruggers,”

PRINCE will, of course, have a per-

he will join. Oxford naturally

(Some ertracts from an old friend, as
it might appear if written to-day
and issued in volume form by
Messrs. SIDGwick AND JAcksos.)
Box AND Cox.
The scene represents a bed-sitting-room
in a lodging-house of the lower
middle-class. The furniture and
appointments are frankly hideous,
but utilitarian—or would be, in an
aundamaged condition. There is
one door, which, when opened, dis-
closes the head of a somewhat dingy
staircase. Though it is a summer
morning there is not too much light.
The window (which has not been
cleaned for weeks) permits only a
partial view of the upper floors and
chimney-pots of a rew of drab
houses, forming the opposite side of
a mean street. A typical Battersea
or Bermondsey vista. At present,
however, even this cannot be observed,
as the window is in the fourth wall,
and therefore out of sight of the
audience.
When the curtain rises, Mrs. Bouncer,
a careworn and worried woman of
forty-five, but looking older from
want of albumen, is clearing away
the breakfast things.
Mrs. Bouncer. Anything further you
require, Mr. Cox2

Thank you. Nothing. Nothing.
[Now that he has turned from the fire,
before which he has been sitting
lost in thought, you see Henry Cox
more clearly. A sparse, middle-
aged, and prematurely grizzled
man. A hatter, with all a hatter's
emotionalism and characteristic
lack of balance kept in check by
circumstances. He has the sallow,
brooding face of a man who will
never grow up, because he has never
been wholly young. Something of
a misogynist too, though this fact
is not as yet fully apparent ; his
manner, for example, towards Mrs.
Bouncer gives no clue to it. Con-
tinuing, he says:

[He comes in quickly. George Box is
a printer, which means nowadays
a Socialist. He is a larger, more
assertive man than his fellow-lodger.
One feels instinctively that in a
higher social sphere he would spend
his autumns in Northern Italy and
contribute to The Saturday West-
minster. As it is, he goes to Margate,
and considers Mr. CHESTERTON
well-meaning but obscure. Gener-
ally easy-tempered, he is capable of
outbursts of passion. At present
he is very angry indeed. NoTE.—
The actor may find all this, es-
pecially the CHESTERTON part, a
little difficult to express by make-up

reflections, Box re-enters, and they

neither of her victims is familiar
with French, she is allowed to
depart unanswered. The two then

be also, by the fact that this remark

to be certain he is not being “got

serious.

a sudden flash of the hatter) fight for

A HOMELY HERO.
IT was not on the tented field, -
Where fierce the flag of battle flew,
That, scorning all demands to yield,
Darling, I proved my love for you
Both staunch and true.
Nor at some manly outdoor game
My stand did I proceed to take,
Crying (in honour of your name),
“Behold the duck's-egg that I break
For Maisie's sake.”
No! 'Twas at supper yesternight
My heart continued unafraid
When told that there for my delight
A pie would shortly be displayed
That you had made.
For love of you, dear, I ignored
The pangs I knew Fate had in store;
Alone of those around the board,
Like little Oliver of yore,
I asked for more.

HOW THEY BEGAN.
A NEw series of autobiographical
sketches, to be called “How I Began,”
is to run through T.P.'s Weekly. An
intelligent anticipation of certain of the
contributions follows:–
MR. T. P. O'Connor, M.P.
But surely I have told you all this
before? Yes? Then here goes. [He
tells it again.]
MR. GEORGE GRAVES.
I cannot remember any time when I
was not an old man with a voice like
DAN LENo. Even as a baby I would
place one hand over my eyes, lean
against some one or something with
the other, and make the nursery rock
with laughter. It was horrible, hor-
rible, in one so young; but I did it.
MR. J. S. SARGENT, R.A.
I don't usually talk much about
myself, but who can resist T.P. 2 Even
as a mere child I had a passion to
paint portraits. My first brush was
made of hair cut from a favourite
puppy's tail, my first paint was black-
ing and cochineal, and my first sitter
was SHEM from the nursery Noah's ark.
MR. G. K. CHESTERTON.
Your request that I should tell you
“how I began ” is one of the most
enormously perplexing and paralysing
that I ever received. For it puts in
the past tense an operation which is
still in the present. It is like asking a
man who has not yet eaten his first
morsel of hors d'oeuvre, how he had
liked his dinner; or asking a traveller
just alighting at Calais from Dover for
the first time, how he had enjoyed his
trip in France: for I consider my be-
ginning as much in front of me as
behind me. To tell you how I began
would be to write the whole history of
my life, day by day, and minute ly
minute, down to this very moment.
I hold that I shall be beginning to the
end.
MR. HARRY WARDON.
For some years I played no golf at
all, certainly for three years. But
although I did not play I thought
about the game, and from my nurse's
arms and from the perambulator studied
the frequenters of the Jersey links until
I knew more of their form than they
themselves did. Then, when the time
was ripe, Ione day seized a club myself
and—began.
MR. ARNOLD BENNETT.
To tell you how I began would not
only take too long and occupy too much
of my space, but it would also be
throwing away a lot of excellent
st rved tº Roº

letting you know how I chanced upon
my present profession. I once let my
house furnished and had an inventory
of it made out. Glancing at the in-
ventory, I exclaimed, “What an excel-
lent ground plan for a novel !” and
straightway wrote it.
SIR HENRY WooD.
Strange to say, I was unconscious of
any musical talent until I won a good
conduct prize at my preparatory school,
and immediately realised that I was
destined to be a good conductor.
MR. C. K. SHoRTER.
I, a mere Cockney, even in the cradle
found no difficulty in MEREDITH's
Shaving of Shagpat. Its intricacies
(as other people call them) were indeed
milk to me. Nor did I need a glossary
when reading the menitorious poems
of RoHERT BURNs, while CHAUCER,
mine, little Cockney though I was, was
so simple and lucid as to make him my
favourite songster. Thus nurtured on
the best, and finding it so easy, how
could I help but become an omnivorous
reader and collector and a critic of
universal range?

Emphatic, like to fire alarms,

Mighty is truth; I must confess,

AT THE PLAY.
“DoorMATS.”
No dramatist writes dialogue quite so
simply and naturally as Mr. H. H.
DAVIES, and with such pleasant results.
His characters are always human, and
because they are so human they are of
their own accord humorous. Uncle
Rufus is not given funny things to say;
he merely says the things that your
Uncle Rufus or my Uncle Rufus would
say; we recognise them with delighted
laughter. Noel and Leila and Aunt
Josephine we know too; they speak as
our own Noel and Leila and Aunt
Josephine would speak. It is very
jolly to see all our relations in a play.
Captain Harding gets going; and we
find that we don't know Captain
Harding. He makes love to Leila, and
we begin to think that we don't know
Leila. They decide to run away to-
gether—this, we feel, is something out-
side our own life. Noel refuses to divorce
her, but offers to let Leila divorce him;
we begin to look about us uncom-
fortably. These are not our friends at
all; who are they? Have we come
into the wrong house by mistaké?
It was unwise of Mr. DAVIEs to deal,
in a light-hearted play and in his light-
handed manner, with the deep emotions.
There are dramatists who can be amus-
ing about infidelity, but he is not one
of them—for which let him be thank-
ful. Mr. DAVIEs knows perfectly well
“Of course, I hate making love to another
man's wife, but in these days of competition

that in real life husband, wife and lover
don't behave as do Noel, Leila and
Harding in the Third Act of Doormats.
Another dramatist might protest that
his people were not meant to be real
people, but Mr. DAVIES has not that
excuse. He started out to make them
real and to make us interested in them.
He could not, afterwards, turn them
back into puppets.
Mr. ALFRED Bishop and Miss NINA
Boucicault played perfectly as the
Uncle and Aunt. Mr. GERALD DU
MAURIER as Noel was better than I
have ever seen him; for once, it was not
the part which fitted him, but he who
fitted the part. Miss Löhr was Leila,
and how else she could have played
Leila I do not know. It was to her
credit as an actress in the first two Acts
that she showed up the Third Act so
badly. Mr. DAwson MILWARD did not
belong to the play at all, but as an
imaginary Captain Harding he was

WITH the war comes a very epidemic
of alphabets, no paper being complete
without its “A.B.C. of the Struggle;"
or, “Who's Who in the Balkan busi-

Facts.” Mr. Punch does not propose to
enlighten his readers as to the ins and
outs of this conflict, partly because he
does not know them; but to come out
without an A.B.C. of some kind seems
to him so pusillanimous that, at great
expenditure of force and patience, he
has compiled one. The war itself being

then with a disappointed woman of twenty-five. And when
I say “fallen in love” I mean, and Mr. THURSTON means,
what I say. “A boy of nine has got in him all that a
woman wants in a man.” It is the mother who says this;
it is the woman of twenty-nine who acts upon it. Which
seems to me not only unpleasant but silly. It is a pity
that Mr. THURSTON lets his mind run riot on this “ever-
lasting antagonism" between men and women which is
commonly called passion. He tells his story well and there
are good points about it. But the general effect to my
Puritan mind is unhealthy. Some of the prettiest of
hedgerow flowers bear poisonous berries. And they are
not always the kind that blush unseen.
Mr. EDEN PHILLPotts in The Lovers (WARD, Lock) has
gone back to his old friends the American prisoners of the
mism an aged War
and to others. Howard Luttrell's trouble was that in the
first flush of youth he promised a revengeful woman that
he would never marry while she lived. Then, of course, as
years passed by he forgot all about her and fell in love with
a very delightful girl. Before, however, he could marry
her the revengeful one appeared again, and complications
naturally set in with some violence. I cannot help being
more than a little sorry for the heroine, who had already
suffered enough from her father. This man was so extra-
ordinarily callous and inhuman that the first part of the
book is literally devoted to the sudden flights of his family.
At last, indeed, he seems to have become so accustomed
to this form of dissipation that when he discovered his
daughter flitting in the middle of the night he said, “Go to
our room, and leave in the morning when you please.
I shall not stop you.” Look at him as you will, he was a
most irritating parent, but, as he lived in the eighteenth
century, I would not have him judged by modern paternal
standards. Miss Fox has written a pleasing romance, and

simplicity of an undeveloped form may now be accounted
mere slackness and let down a talented writer into a class
in which he has no possible business. This blemish, how-

PROBLEMS OF THE WAR.
(By Our Military Erpert.)
APART from any effect the war may
have upon the peace of Europe and the
sale of newspapers, the public, guided
by expert opinion, will find it inter-
esting to watch the influence of the
fighting in the Balkans upon strategy
and tactics. - - - -
Possibly, the contention of certain
theorists that the battles of the future
must be fought at long range will be
proved, but at the same time it must
not be forgotten that distance is
a relative term, a fact which is
well illustrated by the popular
saying, “So near and yet so
far.” -- - -
The use of acroplanes will pro- |
bably form a profoundly instruc-
tive feature of the operations.
Quite possibly these machines |
may revolutionise warfare, but,
on the other hand, it is equally
possible that they may not. Un-
doubtedly their utility has been ||
proved in peaceful manoeuvres, #
but we must bear in mind that
these manoeuvres are not fought ||
under war conditions. In the
circumstances it would be foolish |
to dogmatise until we have more ||
knowledge than at present. -
The question of mechanical |
traction is also one on which
considerable light should be
thrown. In the case of motor-
lorries there is, of course, the
handicap that petrol or other
fuel must be obtained before the
engines will run. At the same
time we must not lose sight of
the counter-necessity for pro-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PARTING GUEST.
WHEN nice people ask me to their
houses for the week-end I reply that I
shall be delighted to come, but that
pressure of work will prevent my stay-
ing beyond Tuesday. Sometimes, in
spite of this, they try to kick me out
on the Monday; and if I find that they
are serious about it I may possibly
consent to go by an evening train. In
any case, it always seems to me a pity
to have to leave a house just as you
are beginning to know your way to the
bathroom.
“Is the 9.25 too early for you?”
said Charles on Sunday night d propos
of nothing that I had said.
“Not if it's in the evening,” I
answered.
“It's in the morning.”. !
“Then it's much too early. I never
travel before breakfast. But why do
you ask?” -
“Well, I've got to
Newtown to-morrow
“To-morrow'?" I said in surprise.
“Aren't we talking about Tuesday ?”
It appeared that we weren't. It also
came out that Charles and his wife, not
anticipating the pleasure of my com-
pany beyond Monday, had arranged to
ride over the downs to Newtown to
inspect a horse. They would not be
back until the evening. -
“But that's all right, Charles,” I
said. “If you have a spare horse, a
steady one which doesn't wobble when
it canters, I will ride with you.” . .
“There's only the old pony,” said
Charles, “and he will be wanted to
drive you to the station.”
“Not until Tuesday,” I pointed out.

Charles ignored this remark alto-
gether. . . . . - - * * *
“You couldn't ride Joseph, anyway,”
he said. ' ' ' , , ------, . . .
“Then I might run beside you,
holding on to your stirrup. --Myan-
cestors always used to go into battle
like that. : "We are still good runners.”
Charles turned over some more pages
of his time-table. -
“There is a 10.41,” he announced.
“Just when I shall be getting to like
you,” I sighed. --
“Molly and I have to be off by ten.
If you caught the 10.41, you would
want to leave here by a quarter-past.”
“I shouldn't want to leave,” I said
reproachfully; “I should go with the
greatest regret.”
“The 9.25, of course, gets you up to
town much earlier.”
“Some such idea, no doubt, would
account for its starting before the 10.41.
| What have you at about 4.30?”
“If you don't mind changing at
I got up and lit my candle.
“Let 's wait till to-morrow and see
what the weather's like,” I said sleepily.
“I am not a proud man, but after what
you've said, and if it's at all wet, I
may actually be glad to catch an early
train.” And I marched upstairs to bed.
However, a wonderful blue sky next ||
morning made any talk of London
utterly offensive. My host and hostess
had finished breakfast by the time I
got down, and I was just beginning
my own when the sound of the horses
on the gravel brought me out.
“I’m sorry we've got to dash off
like this,” said Mrs. Charles, smiling at
me from the back of Pompey. “Don't
you be in any hurry to go. There are
plenty of trains.” ~
“Thank you. It would be a shame
to leave the country on a morning like
this, wouldn't it 2 . I shall take a stroll
over the hills before lunch, and sit about
in the garden in the afternoon. There's
a train at five, I think."
“We shan't be back by then, I'm
afraid, so this will be good-bye.”
I made my farewells, and Pompey,
who was rather fresh, went off sideways
down the drive. This left me alone
with Charles. * - -
“Good-bye, Charles,” I said, patting
him with one hand and his horse with
the other. “Don't you bother about
me. I shall be quite happy by myself.”
He looked at me with a curious
smile and was apparently about to say
something, when Caesar suddenly caught
sight of my stockings. These, though
in reality perfectly tasteful, might well
come as a surprise to a young horse,
and Caesar bolted down the drive to tell
Pompey about it. I waved to them all
from the distance and returned to my
breakfast. . . . -
After breakfast I lit a pipe and
strolled outside. As I stood at the
door drinking in the beauty of the
morning I was the victim of a curious
illusion. It seemed to me that outside
the front door was the pony-cart—
Joseph in the shafts, the gardener's boy
holding the reins, and by the side of
the boy my bag'
“We'll only just have time, Sir," said
the boy. " ' " * -
“But—but I'm going by
train,” I stammered. - -
“Well, Sir, I shall be over at New-
town this afternoon—with the cart.”
I did not like to ask him why, but I
thought I knew. It was, I told myself
sarcastically, to fetch back the horse
which Charles was going over to inspect,
the horse to which I had to give up my
room that night.
“Very well,” I said. “Take the bag
now and leave it in the cloak-room.

was when your host gave you a hint
by sending your bag to the station and
going away himself, I did not know.
But however many bags he packed and
however many horses he inspected, I
was not to be moved till the five o'clock
train. - -
Half-an-hour after my bag was gone
I made a discovery. . It was that,
when I started walking to the five
o'clock train, I should have to start in
pumps. . . . ---

“My dear Charles,” I wrote that
night, “it was delightful to see you
this week-end, and I only wish I could
have stayed with you longer, but, as
you know, I had to dash up to town
by the five train to inspect a mule.
I am sorry to say, that a slight accident
happened ..". I left you. In
the general way, when I catch an after-
noon train, I like to pack my bag over-
night, but on this occasion I did not
begin until nine in the morning. This
only left me eight hours, and the result
was that in my h I packed my
shoes by mistake, and had to borrow a
pair of yours in which to walk to the
station. I will bring them down with
me neart time I come.” º
I may say that they are unusually
good shoes, and if Charles doesn't want
me he must:at least want-them. So I
am expecting anotherinvitation by every
post. When it arrives I shall reply that
I shall be delighted to come, but that,
alas! pressure of work will prevent my
staying beyond Tuesday. A. A. M.

expressed his determination to have it,
put me on my guard from the start.”
“He asked to see some silver tooth-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
oUR COLONIES.
W.—NEwFoundLAND.
This large and patriotic island lies
a little this side of Canada, and has
a very curious history. Originally
discovered by Phoenician whalers
somewhere in the B.C. period, it was
inadvertently mislaid, and the most
diligent search failed to reveal its
whereabouts. However, towards the six-
teenth century—speaking roughly from
memory—a daring adventurer named
CABot stumbled across it again, and
the event was duly chronicled in all
the periodicals of the day. Extraordi-
nary though it may seem, practically
nothing was heard of the island again
till it was re-discovered by The Daily
Mail, since when, of course, it has been
constantly in the limelight. We do not
think the island is likely to be mislaid
a third time, but we confess we have
made a careful note of its latitude and
longitude on the off-chance that our
help will be wanted one of these days.
The climate of Newfoundland is
foggy, and the whole place is con-
stantly enveloped in a dense mist.
This may account for the remarkable
history of the island. However, we
have no doubt that this will all be
altered in a few years now.
Newfoundland boasts the largest
paper factory in the world. It keeps
on boasting it. Paper of the most
superfine nature is distilled from the
carefully conserved falls of some mighty
river, and the absolute purity of the
article thus obtained fits it admirably
for use in modern journalistic enter-
prise. The only other industry of
importance is catching fish and ex-
tracting their livers in order to add yet
another burden to the lot of the rising
generation.
Fishing is, indeed, the most im-
portant industry of the inhabitants,
though in saying this we mean no
disrespect to the paper factory. All
the people in the island are enthusiastic
anglers, and the whole coastline is
occupied by men, women and children
eagerly plying the rod. In Newfound-
land, to spare the rod is indeed to spoil
the child, for in no other manner can
the succulent cod liver be obtained.
Though the average person does not
know it, the scenery of Newfoundland
is magnificent, and, as half the inha-
bitants are occupied round the coast,
there is plenty of room for hunting
caribou. - -
The great difficulty with which New-
foundland has to grapple is that even
people who rather want to go there
almost invariably get carried past it to
Canada. When they try to hark
again, and so see nothing of the de-
lightful island. It is a great pity, for
what with its grand forests, its magni-
ficent waterfalls, its rolling plains, its
broad lakes, and its paper factory, New-
foundland is well worth a visit.
The islanders are a very hardy race,
and their favourite amusement is to go
out in small boats and dodge the
Atlantic liners. They pretend they are
going fishing, and then sail right to
the famous Newfoundland banks, where
they know perfectly well they will en-
counter Atlantic liners. Probably some
law would be made to prevent this,
but it has been discovered that a liner
experiences practically no shock when
striking one of the fishing boats, so
the authorities don't worry about it.
Arrived at the banks, the boats spread
out, and wait till they hear the siren
of an approaching steamer. The fog
makes this sound very deceptive, and,
as the steamer is probably travelling
at something like thirty miles an hour,
it can readily be imagined that the
sport is remarkably exhilarating.
Newfoundland is quite an important
island, having its own parliament, its
own Fishery Act, and its own variety
of postage stamp, in addition to the
paper factory. In the past its progress
has necessarily been retarded by its
unfortunate habit of getting lost, but,
now that it appears to have definitely
overcome this weakness, there should
be a great future for the island. In-
cidentally, the climate is held to be
matchless for the complexion.
Mention of Newfoundland recalls
another British Colony to mind, and
it would indeed be invidious to close
this record without some word as to

North-East of Cape Horn, and will be

DOUBLE PAINS.
BY A GAMBLING, TIRo.
I AM one of the most pitiable men
on earth. For why? The horse I
backed has won the Cesarewitch. But
that surely ought to make you happy,
you say: the unhappy people are those
whose horses lose races; and so forth.
True—ordinarily; but not true in my
case, because I have been gambling
on a double. I get no money unless
a certain other four-legged creature
succeeds in coming in first for the
Cambridgeshire. I will not tell you
its name, but the odds against this
combination winning being very heavy
I stand to be several hundred pounds
the richer after the Cambridgeshire has
me and would make it possible to do
all kinds of things I want to do.
If only Warlingham had not won the
Cesarewitch I should be, in one sense,
all right; for all my worries would be
over. Ishould have lost my ten pounds,
it is true, but what peace would be
mine compared with this fever. For
there are two terrible things connected
with my double. One is, it is my first,
for though I had heard of such things
before vaguely I had never ventured
into the perilous waters of turf commis-
sions, and naturally I find the experience
exciting; and the other is, the Cam-
bridgeshire is not run until October 30,
and how I am to get through the in-
tervening days and, worse, intervening
nights, is a bitter problem.
My life is already an agony and will
become more so. I shall search the
papers for news of my horse: his
gallops and canters, his “easy miles,”
his “useful 5 furlongs,” his “steady
14 miles.” How the heading, “Latest
scratchings,’ is going to turn my blood
cold! how his place in the latest
London betting, and latest Manchester
betting, whether according to . The
Sportsman or The Sporting Life, is
going to disturb me! And, worse
perhaps than all, the conversation one
is bound to hear ! The men who tell
each other and me the “dead snips"
and never allude to my poor choice;
the barbers who whisper the very
latest into my ear, for whom so far
as winning the Cambridgeshire is con-
cerned my horse might never have been
foaled. And the articles in the papers,
too, by the MAJoR and the Scout and
the ColoneL and the HEAD LAD and
CAPTAIN CoE and Robin GooDFELLOW
and Hotspur and all the other pro-
found students of form whose advice it
is so dangerous to take, yet who have
such a way of seeming to be wise.
What a terrible thing if they agree to
favour my horse!
But, any way, I am in torment, and
no more “doubles” for me—at any
rate until the Lincolnshire and Grand
National.

ESS E N C E OF PAR LIAM E. N. T.
ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
House of Lords, Monday, October 14.
—FLETCHER MoULTON, disguised in a
scarlet gown, re-named Lord MoULTON
of BANK (Ltd.), entered this morning,
took oath and straightway got to work
on appeal coming before their Lordships
in their judicial capacity. Somecuriosity
as to particular Bank with which the
new Peer has associated his personality
and his title. Anyhow sure to be a
sound institution.
FLETCHER MoULTON will be a valued,
much-needed accession to strength of
Ministerialists in this Chamber. Hap-
pens by chance that, whilst in the
Commons supremacy of Treasury Bench
over Front Opposition Bench in debate
is overwhelming, reverse is, in degree,
the case in Lords. Lord MoULTON of
BANK (Ltd.) will, of course, not sit on
Ministerial Bench, but will be at hand
when wanted.
One of curiosities of Parliamentary
life that a man of such wide experience,
such accumulated store of knowledge,
such felicity of phrasing did not meet
full recognition in the Commons.

ing his mouth in court under less
persuasion than lurks behind a fee of
a hundred guineas, when he rose in the
Commons prelude to his speech usually
emptied House in space of ten minutes.
Former Member for Launceston almost
equally effective in that direction.
Happily qualities that do not glitter in
the Commons frequently shine in the
Lords. Baron Moulton of BANK (Ltd.)
will presently discover that with his
new title he has found his right place.
Welcome to him saddened by re-
flection upon occasion of his change of
estate. He comes to his Lordship of
Appeal with a seat in House of Lords
in succession to Lord Robson, only
temporarily, everyone hopes, fallen on
field of battle with harness on his back.
Still in the prime of life as years are
counted for public men, reaching the
height of a steadily growing reputation,
Robson was suddenly smitten down,
forced to relinquish recently-acquired
position on the Bench.
This one of the penalties men of
supreme intellectual capacity, with
physical organisation too delicate to
keep up the pace, pay for privilege
during term of Robson's Attorney-
Generalship circumstances combined
exceptionally to burden his office. In
addition to its special duties he was
called upon to undertake others ex-
traneous to its range. Came to occupy
in the Administration position akin to
that of maid-of-all-work in domestic
households. He made no complaint,
scorned delights, lived laborious days
and in due course entered a haven of
comparative rest.
One of the best debaters of his time
in the Commons, his transference to
Ministerial Bench in the Lords pro-
mised appreciable measure of redress of
the balance of inequality alluded to. It
was matter for remark among his Peers
that the brilliant ex-Attorney-General
habitually abstained from debate. The
MEMBER For SARK explains. Reason
incredible if forthcoming upon less in-
fallible authority. He affirms that one
of the honest if not amiable prejudices of
the Ex-Lord CHANCELLOR was directed
against custom of a Member of the
Judicial Bench (other than the Lord
Chancellor) taking part in political
debate. This was with engaging frank-

House of Commons, Tuesday.—Since
the remote period when reference to
“the story of grouse in the gun-
room " thrilled human curiosity there
has been no outburst such as that
which followed upon BYLEs of BRAD-
Ford's allusion to-night to “the
problem of the chicken and the egg.”
Earlier in the sitting, emotion had been
stirred by HARodd BAKER's method
of answering questions. In absence of
UNDER-SECRETARY FoR INDIA, a happy
man who, leaving us to discuss Home
Rule with Welsh Church Establishment
to follow, is at this moment steaming
over sunlit seas on his way to visit the
GREAT Mogul, BAKER was put up to read
Departmental answers to Questions.
Four in succession on the paper. First
related to petty appointment to some
office in India. Impressed with gravity
of his task, BAKER unconsciously fell
into intonation reminiscent of the
pulpit. At the end of first five minutes
this suggested to irreverent Member
opposite the fervent ejaculation “Amen!”
But BAKER hadn't finished yet. As
he continued, volleys of ironical cheers
accompanied his recitation, reaching
climax in burst of applause when at
length he reached the end.
Nothing House enjoys more than
little joke of this kind, all of its own
invention. Thrice more BAKER rose to
read a short paper. Ever the cheering
recommenced and was continued. On
finally resuming his seat, BAKER sat
puzzled, wondering what it was all
about. Never had he received such
ovation since in college days he won
the Gaisford Prize.
“And this,” said TULLIBARDINE
testily, “is the man who brought in a
Bill to abolish Plural Voting! If he
would cut down his answers instead of
other people's franchise it would be
more agreeable.” -
It was just before the guillotine fell
for the first time that BYLEs of BRAD-
Ferº turned up with his chicken and
the egg. House in Committee dis-
cussing SANDys' amendment to Clause
II. of Home Rule Bill, limiting legis-

known as HENRY FowlFR. His career,
lengthened and honourable throughout,
shows afresh how open is the race for
the Parliamentary Stakes. It was a
cherished saying in NAPoleoN's time
that every recruit to the army carried
in his knapsack the baton of a Field
Marshal. At least equally true that
every new Member taking his seat in
the House of Commons conceals about
his person the seals of a Secretary of
State. HENRY FowlFR stepped into the
arena with the preliminary disadvan-
tage of age. It is rare indeed for a
man who enters this unique assembly
at the age of fifty to achieve distinction.
The rule of comparative youth is
established in the cases of Pitt, PAL-
Returned as Member for Wolver-
hampton HENRY Fowler took his seat
below Gangway among the Radicals.
Constitutionally he was more nearly a
Whig than a Radical. As years accumu-
lated, bringing higher position and fresh
honours, he further mellowed in that
direction. Early made his mark as one
of the best debaters in the House. He
never aroused enthusiasm; invariably
convinced by argument. The supremest
effort was his speech on Indian Cotton
Duties, which averted what threatened
to be disastrous defeat of the Govern-
ment, establishing in its place decisive
triumph in the Division Lobby. '
Less commonly appreciated, but not
less striking; was his conduct of the
Parish Councils Bill in the Session
of 1893-4. Having at his back a
nominal majority of forty disheartened
by action of the Lords in frustrating
long labour on the Home Rule Bill, he
carried this intricate measure through
all its stages without once invoking
the Closure. The arduous task brought
into play his peculiar characteristics of
patience and persuasion. Exceeded in
brilliancy by some of his colleagues on
the Treasury Bench, he was the only man
who could have achieved this endeavour.
As HARcourt, a keen and interested
looker-on, wrote to him, “You are the
skilful sportsman who has brought
your game to the bag.” - -

not necessarily follow—to his country.

AT THE PLAY.
A TRIPLE BILL.
It began with Overruled, a sad piece
of frivolity by Mr. BERNARD SHAw.
The scene was a sofa at a seaport.
First it accommodated a man and
somebody else's wife; then the man's
wife and the somebody else; and con-
cluded, from sheer exhaustion, after an
ensemble (the ladies seated, the men
standing) very tedious and tourmenté.
From platitudes we passed to para-
doxes in the old manner, with here and
there a good thing. There was a little
fun about a mutual revelation on
the part of the first couple that
each was already married. I
recall this diversion from a twenty-
year-old page of Fliegende Blätter
—“Ich bin verheiratet !”. “Ich
auch.” There was some more fun,
on a lower plane, about a man's
promise to his dead mother; and
there was one of those deplorable
banalities to which Mr. SHAw
occasionally descends — a joke
about Mrs. Lunn's Christian name
of Sally. But the most typical
part of the humour was of a more
obscure pattern, as when Mr.
Sibthorpe Juno said (unless my
poor head failed me from dizzi-
ness), “I don't object to people
saying I have done wrong; but
I do object to their saying that
what I have done was wrong.”
I daresay this sort of thing is
well enough on paper when you
can worry it out; but the stage,
as Mr. SHAw knows well and
rejoices in his knowledge, is no
place for the bandying of such
dark pleasantries. “Stop foot-
ling,” said somebody, “and let's
get to dinner; ” and this was the
best thing said.
As for movement, the actors,
of course, had no chance; and the
performance had the air of an
amateur drawing-room entertainment.
The piece was received with the
polite tolerance due to Mr. SHAw's
repute.
Followed The Widow of Wasdale
Head, by Sir ARTHUR PINERo, a roman-
tic costume “fantasy” of an amazing
futility. Looking back, I cannot think
how I contrived to sit it out. The
young and comely widow, who kept an
inn, was suspected by an admirer of
| secretly entertaining, every Friday night
at 10 P.M., an amorous visitor. With
mighty rumblings the local mountain
(Wasdale Head) gave promise of an
arresting parturition, but it was the
most ridiculous of mice that emerged.
It was just the stolid ghost of her
ditions.
bridge.”
made his hebdomadal reappearance with
the idea of giving her agricultural hints
for the management of her crops and
live-stock. He stood at a considerable
distance and their relations (taken very
seriously) were of a purely platonic
order. Finally the dull lover, his
suspicions removed, secured the heart
of the lady (charmingly played by Miss
MARGERY MAUDE), and the last of the
ghost was seen through the wall, about
to vanish—none knew whither—on a
white mare. The best thing in the
play was the wind, which whistled
very well indeed.

The piece was received with the
polite tolerance due to Sir ARTHUR
PINERo's repute.
Then, at last, there came Mr. BARRIE’s
Rosalind, with Miss IRENE VANBRUGH
to play it exquisitely. It contained—
what the other trifles had omitted—
the illustration of an actual idea. Not
perhaps a very new one, since the
advanced age of some of our ever-
green actresses has always been
recognised by everybody except them-
selves and their very young adorers.
But Mr. BARRIE, as usual, brought a
nice novelty to the presentment of his
theme. Mrs. Page, the famous actress,
is “resting" at an obscure lodging,
dressed in sloppy clothes, hugging the
and a bittock”) and posing before her
landlady (clever Miss HELEN HAYE) as
the mother of herself. Here she meets
one of the “boys,” who has only seen
her hitherto in her war-paint, and (this
being a play) he fails to recognise her.
To him she reveals her secret, well kept
from the audience till within a few
seconds of its disclosure. Then comes
a telegram from her manager recalling
her to the stage; the dormant passion
revives; and a swift readjustment of her-
self at the toilet-table restores her to
the twenties.
| There is the old blending of tears and
laughter which we have come to
expect from Mr. BARRIE , the
sudden fall from pathos to bathos.
But he touches nothing which
he does not adorn with his own
perennial freshness, and his play
just saved the evening from being
a fiasco. O. S.

OF course if you are not in
the “movement” it becomes a
simple matter. You merely walk
into What 's-his-name's or the
Thoroughbred Furnishing Co.
(after slinking past the corps of
gentlemen-at-arms guarding the
portal), prostrate yourself before
the immaculately-dressed Peer of
the Realm who is lying in wait
for you behind the third roll of
cork lino on the left, and buy as
you are bid.

beam over the fireplace. You have
done your duty, no less. Do not lose
your temper with the casement that
will not open. Summer is coming next
year, and the wood will shrink. Wait
and see.
While waiting, come to the drawing-
room, and it's ho! for the white wall-
paper with the vieux-rose spots, and for
the pea-green carpet and the pink silk
curtains. How admirably the polished
mahogany stands out; and the silver
cup that Uncle James won at the
Podbury Fat Stock Show seems to
have an added value against the dark
rosewood overmantel. The prints in
their archaic frames, the old Sheraton
writing-table you picked up, are not
genuine; never mind, you think they
are, and they give the right feeling,
and feeling is everything.
We are now in the bedrooms. Yes,
wooden bedsteads are much pleasanter
to the eye than brass and iron ones,
though they possess none of those nice
big cool knobs to suck of a morning
after a night of pain. To close the
bottom drawer of the inlaid dressing
chest, lie on your back and use both
feet. It is much more effective than
the wiggle-woggle action with the
hands, and relieves the feelings.
Don't worry about the kitchen. The
maids aren't in the movement, anyhow.

A CALL TO ARMS.
Ever since the passing of the Finance
(1909-1910) Act, 1910, I have been
exercising myself to discover a means
of humiliating its authors and avenging
the unhappy faces and lives of my
friends. Two years I have given to
the task—years of such utter devotion
to thought that my brow is still sodden,
like a washerwoman's fingers, from the
constant application of cloths, and to
this day I cannot approach a cup of
black coffee without trembling. I am
now able to announce that my scheme
is perfected. I take this opportunity of
thanking many unknown friends who
have awaited the result of my labours
with such patient interest, and with
their kindly sympathy cheered me in
my moments of darkness, at times when
| a less powerful intellect would have
broken down completely under the con-
| tinuous strain.
| There is one thing further I should
| like to say. In publishing my discovery
iſ now for the first time, I think I can
|fairly claim that the credit is entirely
my own. If merit is ever going to be
iſ rewarded, the least I can expect, when
|| the Conservatives come again into
| power, is the refusal of a peerage; yet,
if there is nothing else for it, I would
| accept two seats in the Cabinet, for
| myself and a friend. One other thing.
Josephine particularly asked me to
mention that she, for her part, has
decided upon the post of female assessor
to the Divorce Division of the High
Court of Justice, which no doubt could
be arranged; and that her young
brother, Algernon, rather than hang
about home after leaving school, would
prefer a stake in the country as Junior
Lord of the Treasury—or was it the
Admiralty? I forget; I believe she
said Admiralty, because of the greater
likelihood of there being money in it,
with the Conservatives in office again.
I think that is all, unless I put in a
good word for a cousin on my mother's
side, who as Inspector to the Board of
Agriculture and Fisheries could find
more opportunities for sport than in
his present employment. -
Now to begin at the beginning I
propose to take you back to last summer,
i.e., August, 1911, when I was lodging
with Mrs. Jones at a place by the sea.
Perhaps you don't know Mrs. Jones.
But if you do and have ever rented
her rooms, you will probably have
heard from her own mouth a remark-
able epic, the Odyssey of her late
husband: how, after a brief but singu-
larly crowded matrimonial career, he
left sundry small pledges on the hands
of his widow, though considerably more
none of the former possesses any re-
deeming feature worth mentioning,
evil being transmissible through the
male line only; and how the buffetings
of fate have reduced her from compara-
tive affluence to the letting of lodgings
to handsome young gentlemen at a
place by the sea. Little did she dream,
as she was bringing in breakfast one
morning, surrounded by several small
demons, somewhat like those that
appear in the Bacchanal procession on
the front page of this issue, only dirtier,
that the eye of the twentieth century
would soon be fastened upon her. For
it was then the idea first entered my
head, and led me to wonder how much
there was in it. Did I say breakfast?
I should have said tea, because I
remember now that that afternoon it
was raining.
Every father, of course, will recall
that passage in the Act where it says, I
think, that, for purposes of income-tax,
all persons with sixteen children shall
be entitled to claim a rebate of £160,
those again with fifty, a rebate of £500,
and so on and so on. Very well; now
here is the master-stroke, here is where
intellect tells. I propose that all un-
married Conservatives—say, roughly,
six million—should bind themselves
solemnly by covenant to marry the six
million widows with the largest families,
before the close of the current financial
year. . . . Friends, in response to your
repeated and generous calls of “Author!"
I beg to thank you for your kind
applause. Yes, that would be a nasty
one for the Government, indeed! I
leave you to imagine the chaos, the
panic, the utter disruption of forces, that
such concerted action must surely entail.
But help is urgently needed. Who will
help ? One man cannot do it alone.
As pioneer of the movement, I would

If so, let him communicate with me at

word more. I need scarcely remind
you that in all intrigues of such magni-
tude little expenses mount up so rapidly
that a sovereign is gone almost before
the change has had time to get warm.

IT might have helped to fill a space
On some relation's spare-room wall;
It might have shone in pride of place
Upon a missionary stall,
Where Charity—that covers sin–
Or Hospitality had shed
The laurels that you yearn to win–
But, no! you sent it me instead.
And, as I scan this curious view,
* It “furiously gives to think;"
The upper-half is mainly blue,
The lower—various shades of pink;
And none, I ween, should ever name
The purport of these mystic tones,
Were it not printed on the frame:
“An Eastern Sandscape—Doris
Jones.” . . ... . . "
But I, whose fate it is to know
The drabness of a desert land,
Who look from out my bungalow
Across infinities of sand, . . . .
Could wish that you had sought a
theme - -
In brae and burn, in tree and turf,
Or fixed an exile's fading dream
Of cloud-swept down, of wind-swept
surf. ---
For one who's seen a tropic sky
And knows by heart its sickening hue
Must needs admit it's white and dry,
But, Doris, never liquid blue;
And as for sand, the beastly stuff
That gets into your eyes and nose,
It may be yellow, white or buff,
But never this ethereal rose.
And yet I'm glad you didn't send
This symbol of a maiden art
To any caustic critic-friend
Who boasts a less romantic heart;
For he'd have scanned it with a frown
And placed it in a bottom-drawer,
While I—I'll hang it upside down ...,
And call it “Sunrise off the Nore.”

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN The Royal Visit to India (MACMILLAN) the Hon. JoHN
ForTEscue gives an animated account of the expedition of
KING GEORGE and QUEEN MARY to the greatest dependency
of the Crown. Mr. ForTEscue has earned and is still
earning great renown as the historian of the British army,
and his narrative of the Indian visit is, if a fault may be
hinted, unduly coloured by prejudices engendered by the
studies in which he has for so long been honourably en-
gaged. O que j'aime les militaires might be his motto, for
he loses no opportunity of exalting the Indian soldier at the
expense of the Indian civilian. His views, in fact, are
those of a military autocrat of a somewhat rigorous type.
He charges Lord WILLIAM BENTINck with having “injured
the discipline of the Sepoys still more by abolishing the
punishment of the lash in native regiments, in the face of
unanimous advice to the contrary both from Europeans
and Indian officers.” I seem to remember that when
flogging was abolished in the British Army military men
were almost unanimously opposed to the change. Would
any of them care to revert to the old and brutal system
now 2
In regard to English history as a subject of education
for Indians, Mr. ForTEscue evidently regrets that he was
born too late to modify the events of the past. “The most
eloquent passages in English history and oratory,” he says,
“are those devoted to conflict with Royal authority, the
dethronement of Kings, and the conquest of what is called
civil and religious liberty . . . In any case the classical
incidents of English history do not furnish sound models
been studying The Pious Editor's Creed in The Biglow
Papers. He seems to think that “libbaty's a kind o' thing
thet don't agree with " Indians.
In fact they must not
even read about it.
May I suggest, by the way, that it was
the war of the Austrian, not, as Mr. ForTEscue states, of the
Spanish, Succession which is remembered for the battles of
Dettingen, Fontenoy, &c.? With this slip of his pen my
faultfindings cease and I may conclude by congratulating
Mr. FoETEscue heartily on having written a very brilliant
and entertaining record of a memorable expedition and a
great ceremonial.
The odd thing about Mr. W. B. MAxwell, is that he
appears to possess two entirely distinct literary personal-
ities. There is the teller of brisk tales, not too probable,
with plenty of bustle and a happy ending, like Vivien, for
example. There is also the writer who specializes in clever
and quite merciless exposure of certain abnormal types of
character. Well, in General Mallock's Shadow (HUTCHIN-
son), both these gifted authors appear to have collaborated,
with a result, as you might suppose, brilliant but a little
disconcerting. I have an impression indeed of Mr. MAx-
well, the mind-dissector, bursting in upon the other one.
“My dear fellow,” says he, “I've just thought of a splendid
idea! What about an old general, broken and disgraced
after some incident in a frontier war, living in lonely
retirement, and brooding over it? From being a man with
a grievance he would slowly develop monomania, and thus
gradually become insane. Eh 2 How does that strike you
for a novel, my boy?” “Rotten' " says the other, “unless,
of course, you could manage to work in a happy ending." |
“I might,” the first answers, “if you wouldn't mind writing







for good citizenship in India.” Mr. ForTEscue must have
that part.” So they set to work, and turned out a book

that for three-quarters of it is as hauntingly clever and
depressing as . In Cotton Wool, and for the remaining
quarter develops into a perfect riot of felicity and senti-
ment. But of course it took some doing. When the
strikes began at the local mines, and we were told that the
men “showed an ugly temper,” I first began to suspect the
prèsence of Mr. Vivien MAxwell. Later, when he took
sole command, I confess I gave myself to his guidance with
delight, and enjoyed his happy transformation - scenes to
the fullest. In short, a story, you observe, to suit all tastes.
Socrates, the friend and enemy of my youth, was the
very last person I expected to meet in a modern novel. If
I had ever conceived the possibility of the reneontre, it was
to hope that it would never occur, since the atmosphere he
carried with him would necessarily be so full of bitter
memories as to spoil the novel. Mr. H. DE WERE STAc-
Poole has shown me my mistake in The Street of the Flute
Player (MURRAY), the action of which takes place in the
year of the first production of The Frogs. I have now come
to the conclusion that the brilliant and gay, splendid and

have believed that so common a manifestation of weather
could have such a devastating effect on the moral character
as occurs in the case of her Clover Feilding. Here is a girl
whose record of self-respecting independence and virginal
aloofness has been established over a matter of some 150
pages; yet suddenly, under the influence of an electric
disturbance, following upon an eerie experience of marsh-
land mists, she returns the passion of a man whom she
does not love, and in the very house of another man whom:
she adores. I have a suspicion, possibly unfair to her, that
Mrs. BYNG has had certain exceptional traits and tempera-
ments under observation, and that in transplanting them
into other types and environments she has overlooked
the change of conditions. But the rest of her characters
are drawn with great probability, always excepting the
wicked Mrs. Craven, whose lurid conversation clearly lies (as
is only proper) beyond the pale of the author's experience.

a great pity that a book

allowed a heavy share of

Since, for so long a
time now, not to know
and Nitetis is all the more charming because one is made to
feel that in days when everyone was inspired and none
plodded it must have been so much more worth while to love
and be loved. The dialogue is a little disappointing in parts,
which I attribute to the author's having failed to catch
always the spirit of contemporary humour. I do not care
to think that old Athens was made to laugh so easily as he
would have me at times believe.
The Hon. Mrs. JULIAN BYNG, who has emerged from her
mask and published a new novel, Barriers (HoldFN AND
HARDINGHAM), under her own name, ought to know more
about soldiers than I do. Yet I hope that, if I had lost a leg
in the service of my country, I should be more inclined to
wave the other one about in the open than to shun human
society (my old regiment in particular) and become a
morbidly introspective recluse like her hero, Southminster.
One expects a soldier to accept these chances as part of the
great game and not develop the bitter cynicism which
might be excusable in a man whose nature had been warped
by a trick of Fate at his birth, or an accident in which his
honour was not concerned. On another point, too, I can
only very grudgingly bow to Mrs. BYNg's judgment. She
probably knows more than I do about the effect of thunder-
Mrs. ALEC TweedIE has been to argue oneself unknown, it is
hardly surprising that she should have been tempted into a
volume of reminiscences. Let it be said at once that many
greater names have been put to less readable books. Mrs.
Tweedle's is called Thirteen Years of a Busy Woman's Life
(John LANE), and the title has the merit of exactly describing
the contents. The notable persons who are at least men-
tioned fill nine pages of index, and about many of them the
writer has some quaint or characteristic story. One thing
you will note about Mrs. TweedIE's lions; she seems to have
found them, those of whom she gives personal recollections,
in an amiability which speaks volumes for the charm of
the tamer. Even WhistLER, for example, and W. S.
GILBERT, those formidable monsters, roar you in these
pages as gently as any sueking dove. . . - . ºf.
But, after all, the chief interest of the book lies not so
much in the great people and events that the writer
encountered as in the revelation it gives of a brave and
energetic woman cutting her way to success in the face of
obstacles. That lends it a dignity of its own, and for
that at least it deserves to be read with consideration and
respect. Fvery page of Mrs. ALEC TweedIE's recollections
breathes the content of one who has “arrived " through
her own exertions, and doesn't mind showing that she

While there's a landlord left to pinch— .
That, once you roused his generous rage,
Once the high task was fairly tackled, he
Could not refuse a living wage,
Not even to the Faculty.
Long time—for it was here a case
Of public money, not his own—
Long time he wore a grudging face,
Then took the following lavish tone:–
“What, shall our schemes incur a hitch

That rust in port through lack of pitch)
For half-a-crown per annum ?
“Is eight-and-sixpence (net),” he cries,

“And I,” said Francesca, “was speaking of the house-

“Given warning?” I said. “Now why has she done
that 2 ''
“It was a desire to better herself that led her to the
dreadful step.”
“Better herself!” I said with scorn. “Bettering is of
the spirit; but she desires more money. The woman is a
base materialist."
“And,” said Francesca, “the worst of it is she doesn't
know it.” -
“But she ought to know it,” I said. . . . .
“Well, you go and tell her. She will, of course, pretend
not to understand you, or she will say she's got to make
her living same as everybody else, and if she don't look
after herself nobody else will, and then where’ll she be?”
“And this,” I said, “is what England is coming to 1."
“Pooh,” said Francesca, “do you suppose this is the
only country where housemaids leave their places? They're
doing it in France and Germany at the rate of a hundred a
minute, and as for America, it is just one gigantic universal
warning, only, of course, they call it something else and
pronounce it much better. Anyhow your sacred comfort
won't be disturbed. You won't notice the change. I'll
undertake to say you don't even know the housemaid's
name.” * ---
“Oh, Francesca,” I cried, “how you wrong me! Not
know the housemaid's name 2 Her name, of course, is Jane.”
“Her name,” said Francesca, “is Euphemia." . . .
“No, no,” I continued with growing enthusiasm, “her
name is not Euphemia. No housemaid's name was ever
Euphemia.”
“We shortened it to Effie," said Francesca.
“Nonsense,” I said, “you shortened it to Jennie."
“No,” said Francesca, “we lengthened it to Eff."
“Your levity,” I said, “does not excuse your ignorance.
Talk to me about housemaids, indeed! Why, whenever I
go to my dressing-room in the course of the morning to
fetch a handkerchief, I find a housemaid there.”
“And how do you deal with the intruder?”
“In the only way,” I said. “I smile pleasantly and say
“Don't move. I have only come for a boot.’”
“A handkerchief,” suggested Francesca.
“It is sometimes a boot,” I said. “At any rate I say
‘Don't move. I have only come for '-whatever it may be.”
“It might be a guitar or a suit of armour. You do open
up possibilities.” -
“But,” I went on, “before the words are out of my
mouth or the smile is off my face she has always vanished,
leaving behind her a duster, a brush and a dust-pan.”

FROM MY BALKANY.
BY WILLIAM THE TRUEx.
(A Remarkable Article of Intimate and
Eacclusive Knowledge.)
It is exceedingly fortunate for my
good friends, the news-loving English
public, that I have spent so much time
in the Balkan States. I might so
easily have gone somewhere else. Let
me, as concisely as possible consonantly
with the acquisition of a living wage as
byword there. “Peter Pan,” I call him,
and he calls me his “Truex” Bill. If
you visit Belgrade under the wing of a
diplomat—or, better still, a diplomat's
chalming wife—you will soon be in a
veritable vortex of gaiety, for all the
legations entertain lavishly. When
the war is finished Servia will be
a popular country for tourists, and
Ribarska, a health resort, will rival
Biarritz, the King of which, by the
way, is one of my oldest friends, as Sir
Edward GREY will tell you any day
I need hardly say that I have respected
his wishes, for Old Christmas Carol, as
I call him, is a fine fellow. KING FER-
DINAND, or “Two-in-the-Bush,” as I
call him when we are alone, is not so
popular as he might be; but personally
I find him very affable and as an ento-
mologist he is above reproach. |
But I suppose that my dearest friend
among these warring monarchs is
Nicholas of Montenegro (or Black
Mountain). I shall never forget my
first ten minutes in Cettinje. I arriv

to discuss the vexed ques-
tion of Macedonia, a ques-
tion which the King cf
MontBNEGRO once de-
clared to me had only been
properly understood by
one Englishman—the late
Mr. GLADston E. I doubt
if there is now, beyond
myself, a living diplomat
in the whole world who
has completely grasped the
question. On one of the
many visits I have paid to
the Balkans I was charged
by the Foreign Office to
have audience with the
various rulers and endea-
vour to obtain from them
their personal views upon
the best settlement of the
Macedonian trouble. I
asked the King of MonTE-
NEGRO if he would allow
his son, Prince MIRKo, to
become ruler of Mace-
donia, but His Majesty
gave a flat refusal, observ-
ing in epigrammatic verse:

moving the dust of travel
in my room, a loud knock
came at the door, and there
entered a gentleman in
scarlet coat embroidered
with gold, blue breeches,
white felt gaiters, and a
perfect arsenal of weapons
in his belt. He saluted
gravely and bade me wel-

once remarked to me at
Addis Abeba.

KING PETER of Servia and KING
FERDINAND of Bulgaria both suggested
the appointment of an English Prince,
whose identity I must not disclose.
But when the personage in question
was approached he politely declined
to rule over such a disturbed and dis-
tressed state, a diplomatic secret which,
I believe, has never before been pub-
lished, and which shows how Great
Britain has constantly endeavoured
to establish peace in what has wittily
been called the “powder-magazine of
Europe.”
But to come to the States themselves.
Servia, I think, most interests me, and
you like to ask him. KING PETER
informed me that he had visited every
Spa in Europe without finding relief,
but on trying Ribarska he was imme-
diately cured. I may add that I hold
an honorary commission in the Ribarska
Spahis. The uniform is superb.
Now for Roumania. In my ignor-

The news sent to us this morning
by our special correspondent, Miss Kent,
the first woman war correspondent that
has ever been at the back, will give our
readers some idea of the huge propor-
tions of the struggle now in progress.
Miss Kent tells us that a defending army
of 200,000 Turks is drawn up at Wrmitzi
[? Wrkitzi) prepared to resist the pro-
gress of the attacking army. , What
this means is best realised when we
consider the defensive forces at the
disposal of the invaded country in other
historic conflicts.
In the historic Etrusco-Roman war
the defensive army in the first stages
of the conflict consisted of 3 Romans,
viz.:-Horatius Cocles and two others.
In the Graeco-Persian war the first
defensive measures at Thermopylae
were entrusted to Leonidas and his 300
Spartans—a total of 301 altogether.
These remarkable figures are best
grasped if put out in tabular form —

GRAPHIC COMMENTS.
(Our daily vivid article by the famous
ambide.ctrous pen - and - swordsman,
“Penya Linesman.")
For full three weeks the “dogs of
war" have been loosed, and yet a
shroud (“of thoughts,” as Byron,
fighter in an earlier Eastern struggle,
said) hangs over the area of operations.
Through the “misty morn” of old
Autumn there seems to come to us,
“like a tale of little meaning,” the
slow-dropping notes of battle; as it
might be the rattling of some heedless
urchin who draws his hoop-stick across
the area railing. So “Bella, horrida
bella” pursues its stark way, nor heeds
the dull moan of women. “Della,”
verily “matribus detestata.”
To get to business, however. Once
more there is no definite news from
the front, and the position of the vivid
writer who has to deliver a column of
words—“litera scripta manet "–upon
nothing, is pitiable. That the war
correspondent should be muzzled, his
“War's glorious art” demands it; so
even old Paul Kruger knew. “The
art of war,” said Napoleon, “is to mis-
lead the enemy"—Austerlitz had not
else been Austerlitz. A press telegram
may go from the Bulgar line at Kirk
Kilisse to Carmelite Street, and back to
the Turks at Kirk Kilisse; 'twere as
wise to entrust a secret to a woman.
That there should be no news from
the war correspondent, then, is one
thing; but that there should be no
official news is another. For this is to
rob the vivid pen-and-swordsman of
his bread; it is to make a mock of the
graphic commentator. A thing beyond
forgiveness.
Meanwhile the Turk is still the Turk.
Indomitable stands the Crescent.

Russia. Will he, mill he, this be his
epitaph : Than the Turk no braver

it cannot get a view of his right hand.

ACCOUNTS DELIGHTFULLY
RENDERED.
I HAVE discovered a new Shop—or
rather Stores—with a most ingratiating
way of composing its bills. Not that
any process (except a premature and
miraculous receipt stamp) could make
a bill essentially and au fond other
than what it is—a detestable thing.
But since apparently there must be
bills it is pleasant to get them made
readable not only on the chance of dis-
covering an arithmetical inexactitude,
but for their own sake as—more or
less—literature.
As a rule I do not look at bills.
What I see of them is a huge figure
representing the gross total of a great
number of them; but, chancing to
glance at one the other day, my eye
met the following item :—
1 Partridge that has been hung long
enough to be suitable for Sunday
lunch 3/6
“Why all this?” I asked of the
châtelaine. “Yes,” she replied, “isn't
it odd? They always repeat my words
in their bills.” “And how long have
we been dealing there?” I asked.
“About three weeks,” she said. “And
you never told me!” I remonstrated.
“In this grey world, you never told me.
Let me see some other specimens, I
implore you.”
She brought them,
charmed. I read:—
1 dozen absolutely new-laid eggs, with
the dates legibly on them, brown for

and

and
A shoulder of Welsh mutton just large
enough for four persons . . . . . . . . . . 3/2
Such bills as these are not only re-
minders of what you owe, but of what
you were. They are biographical.
“Splendid,” I said. “Now, we will
really put them to the test.” So we
drew up an order which, among other
things carefully described, included “a
pork-pie, about 2 lbs., not the kind with
crust like plaster of Paris, but a soft
short crust into which the flavour of
the meat has found its way.”
“There,” I said, “that will beat
them.” But I was wrong. When the
bill came in, in a neat clerkly hand on
the blue paper was written, without
the faintest sign to indicate whether the
writer was a humorist or a machine,
this item :-

Perhaps a little odd that the particular

irresistible tendency towards preserva-
tion of peace, a body of Ulster Nation-
alists forthwith presented a similar
weapon to the WINsoME WINSTON.
“The question is,” as the SPEAKER
sometimes remarks, Is it in order for
right honourable gentlemen to bring
these bludgeons into the House whilst
debate is proceeding?
Doubt arises in connection with a
Standing Order going back to duelling
days. Time was when heated argu-
ment in debate was followed by with-
drawal to cool precincts where con-
troversy was renewed and concluded
sword in hand. It is among things not
generally known to the new Member
that a relic of those good old times
remains to this day in the thin red line
that runs down the matting on either
side of the floor of the House, a short
pace beyond the Benches. What he
does know, or will quickly learn, is that
if, in excitement of debate, he steps
outside the line, he is interrupted by
angry shouts of “Order | Order . "

know that the line was originally drawn
in order to keep quarrelsome Members
at a distance of more than a sword's
length from each other's throats.
Other times other manners, or lack
of them. The old order is preserved
to extent that when, as sometimes
happens, Lord Mayor and Sheriffs are
permitted to stand at the Bar presenting
a petition, the Sword-bearer is compelled
to leave his weapon at the door with
stray umbrellas that may have there
congregated.
There is, of course, difference between
a shillelagh and a sword. The former
was not in view when the edict was
drafted and put in force. But in strong
hands it might do equal damage. Hear
from SARK that the delicate matter has
for some time engaged attention of the
authorities.

Miss SYLVIA PANKHURST, who is pro-

account of her activities in connection
with the W.S.P.U., has recently
enrolled herself among the company
of those who keep fowls. In taking
this step she has merely followed the
example of many other men and
women who have adopted this hobby.
It seems—or rather it transpires—
that the birds are kept in a specially

Miss PANKHURST was asked by a
friend not long ago if she kept her pets
solely with a view to fresh eggs.
“Not at all,” was the reply. “As a
matter of fact they seldom lay. But they
are the most soothing, companionable
creatures. They are a perfect mental

MR. P. F. WARNER, on the occasion of

MR. JOHN AYSCOUGH writes to The
Pall Mall Gazette to explain a curious
misunderstanding that has arisen about
the title of his new book, Faustula.
It appears that a writer in The Pall

in which he called it "a better book
than KINGSLEY's classic masterpiece,
Hypatia," with the words "Ave Flos
Martyrum.” Result: The Secretary of
The Times Book Club has written to Mr.
AYSCOUGH inquiring as to his book,
Ave Flos Martyrum, for which sub-
scribers are asking, and Mr. AySCOUGH
accordingly begs the Editor of The

“TANTRUMS.”
ONE has often heard complaints of
the cutting-down of SHAKSPEARE for
the purposes of modern stage-pageantry,
but it is rarely that anyone has the
hardihood to expand him. I remember
meeting in Naples a resident English-
man who confided to me that he had
often felt that SHAKSPEARE had not
made enough of his opportunities in
ANTONY's finale:-"I am dying, Egypt,
dying; ” and that, in leisure moments
of exile, he had ventured to compose an
addendum. Fearing the worst, I tact-
fully , shifted the conversation
to another play and so away
from SHAKSPEARE altogether. But
he was not to be denied, and,
taking up a commanding position
on l;is own hearthrug, he had
me, being his guest, at his mercy.
I suffered much, and this terrible
experience was recalled to me by
Mr. FRANK STAYTON's attempt,
at the Criterion, to revise the
conclusion of The Taming of the
Shrew. It seems that Katharine's
submission and her advice to
other women to “vail their
stomachs,” might well, in real
life, have been a womanly ruse to
cover an attack which would in
the end have reduced Petruchio
to pulp. In Tantrums (dear old-
fashioned word!) the young mil-
lionaire husband (U.S.A.) sets up
to starve his shrew into surrender
by representing to her, after
marriage, that he is a clerk
on a mere pittance. Well know-
ing the true facts, she accepts the
lie with a cheerful countenance,
and undertakes the wifely duty of
much nausea and indigestion, has Sha
to “vail” itself in perfect humility.
There was very little useful action in
the play apart from the incidental
smashing of mantelpiece crockery,
designed to illustrate the domestic
habits of the shrew in her maiden state.
Even the descent of a large vase on to
the head of a stranger in the street, and
his consequent introduction to the lady
who discharged it, did not materially
contribute to the scheme, as the gentle-
man was anyhow on his way from
America to marry her at sight on the
strength of a photograph. The best
achievement of all took place off the
stage. It was the catching of the 2.20
Continental express from Charing Cross
by a couple who had been married in
Liverpool the same morning.
One or two things worried me. I
new bride, on arriving with her husband

proposes, even if she is a shrew, to go

when they want to get away by a fire-
escape ladder, climb up instead of down,
even if there is nothing alight?
I confess that I laughed three or four
times; but this wasn't nearly enough
for a farcical comedy. Also, the un-
relieved hardness of the shrew in the
domestic circle set me against her at
the start; and Miss MARJoRIE DAY had

her long and rather emaciated dialogues.

That Mr. Robey's impersonation of the

THE WALUE OF EXPERT
EVIDENCE.
JAMES CRUNDLE, the Wolchester
General Draper, is one of the successes.
He went into the business, he will tell
you as he welcomes you into his com-
modious premises, when he was four-
teen, and attributes his achievement, of
converting a shop into a national
emporium, to punctuality and plod.
Myself, I put it down to genius. Any-
how I couldn't have done it myself.
My wife has a passion for general
drapery, and none of our household can
venture on an expedition into Wolchester
but what she has a commission for
that one.
“If you are going into town,” said
she to me, “will you take these two
patterns to Crundle's and match them
for me 2''
I realised my unhappy position at
once. “This is the beginning of a
long and bitter quarrel, Belinda,” said
I. “Whatever I do it will be wrong.
How much will you take in cash to
settle at the start and let me off 2 "
“Do your best,” said she, “and I
shall be satisfied.” º
“My doubts,” said I gloomily, “are
of the gravest.”
The girl at the counter and I
managed the first pattern all right, for
the original material was Crundlean.
But they were sold out of the second lot.
“Send for the departmental man;
ager,” said I, keeping calm in a moment
of stress.
The departmental manager said that
not only were they sold out of the stuff,
but that no more could be got, since the
original block, dye, loom, letterpress,
whichever it was, was destroyed.
“Then,” said I, “I must see Mr.
James Crundle.”
, I was glad at this point that I have
always nodded to Mr. Crundle when I
have met him in the street, preferring
that others should know that I know
him, rather than that Mr. Crundle
should know that I know that I know
him but am weak enough not to know
him lest others should know that I
know him (if you follow me). On this
occasion I went to the length of shak-
ing hands with him.
“I went into this business when I
was fourteen,” he began.
“Quite,” said I. “But I am com-
paratively new to it, and I want your
help.”
I explained the position to him and
made many valuable suggestions. His
suggestions were less valuable but more
practical. They amounted to this, that
Belinda must go without.
“Mr. Crundle,” said I, “are you a

“I don't suppose that even a wife
would venture to argue with you about
the matching of materials for servants'
aprons, but conceive the general posi-
tion with other particulars; yourself,
say, commissioned to match a-a-slice
of beef, piece of butter, or drop of
chicken extract.”
Mr. Crundle put his fingers together
and made the conception.
“Something,” said I, “must be done.
Mr. Crundle, you are a success in life.”
He denied this, but showed signs of
reviving his first youth.
“Men have risen to be bishops and
generals, admirals and judges by
triumphing over the follies of men.
You have risen to be the leading draper
in England by triumphing over the
follies of women.”
“Will you step up into my private
room ?” said he. “There we shall find
peace, quiet and privacy, and also pens
and paper.” . .
We stepped up and Mr. Crundle
drafted a memorandum. He handed it
to me and I read with admiration. I
handed it back to him.
“Sign, please,” said I, infected with
the atmosphere of the place.

Before I had even opened my defence,
Belinda had started to convict and
sentence me. “I wish,” said I, “to
hand in a statement,” and I produced
the memorandum.
“I, the undersigned James Crundle,”
read Belinda, “having since the age of
fourteen years been in the business of
general draper, hereby certify that in
the matter of a certain pattern for
material now produced and shown to
me and exhibited to this memorandum
and stamped with the official seal of
Crundle's, Limited, and in the matter
of the executory trusts wherewith
Thomas Bostock, Esquire” (me) “was
intrusted to match the same, every
effort has been duly made to carry out
the said trusts and that the terms thereof
have not been complied with owing to
circumstances over which the said
T. Bostock had no control, that the
said failure is due to force majeure or
the King's enemies, and that the said
T. Bostock has done his best.”
Belinda examined the document from
all points of view, and even looked at
the back.
“I was sure you would muddle it
somehow,” she said; “I suppose I
shall have to go myself.”

THE BIRD IN THE ROOM.
A Robin skimmed into the room,
And blithe he looked and jolly,
A foe to every sort of gloom,
And, most, to melancholy.
He cocked his head, he made no sound,
But gave me stare for stare back,
When, having fluttered round and round,
He perched upon a chair-back.
I rose; ah, then, it seemed, he knew
Too late his reckless error:
Away in eager haste he flew,
And at his tail flew terror.
Now here, now there, from wall to floor,
For mere escape appealing,
He fled and struck against the door
Or bumped about the ceiling.
I went and flung each window wide,
I drew each half-raised blind up;
To coax him out in vain I tried;
He could not make his mind up.
He flew, he fell, he took a rest,
And off again he scuffled
With parted beak and panting breast
And every feather ruffled.
At length Ilured him to the sill,
All dazed and undivining;
Beyond was peace o'er vale and hill,
And all the air was shining.
I stretched my hand and touched him;
then
He made no more resistance,
But left the cramped abode of men
And flew into the distance.
3: 3: +: 3: +
Is life like that ? We make it so;
We leave the sunny spaces,
And beat about, or high or low,
In dark and narrow places;
Till, worn with failure, vexed with doubt,
Our strength at last we rally,
And the bruised spirit flutters out
To find the happy valley.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
PEOPLE who know Mr. HoRACE ANNESLEY WACHELL best
as interpreter of Harrow-on-the-Hill may be surprised to
find him with revolver and bowie-knife ranging the prairies
of the West. Thirty years ago, however, he tells us in his
preface to Bunch Grass (MURRAY), he ranched cattle with
his brother in a country which he has called San Lorenzo,
and the present volume is one of the products of that ad-
venture. It consists, apparently, of stray fragments rescued
from Occidental magazines, and the material has been left
as it was originally printed, so that the book betrays not a
few signs of the tenderfoot in literature, as well as in the
sterner art of cow-punching. There is plenty of the good
raw Californian vernacular, and there are some good yarns
in it together with some that are not so good, but all
through runs a kind of insular sententiousness that makes
it compare unfavourably with the starry models of this
branch of letters, with the tales of BRET HARTE, for instance,
or those of that great humourist who also travelled West
with his brother (and six pounds of unabridged Dictionary)
and subsequently wrote Roughing It. Bunch Grass, in the
words of yet another great writer who has also dealt with the
Golden State, “is not a bonanza, but there's boodle in it.”
In Mark Twain (HARPER BRos.) Mr. ALBERT BIGELow
PAINE has produced a biographical monument which in
respect of bulk is prodigious. It runs to 1,718 pages of type
exceptionally small for book use. Such a work would be all
very well for METHUSELAH to have dallied with. In these
minutiae is appalling. Had it been half as long the biography
would have been more than twice as valuable. It leaves
the life of MARK Twain yet to be written in fashion that
will bring home a fascinating personality to the minds of
multitudinous admirers. It is an interesting speculation
whether his success would have been as immediate, as
universal and as permanent, had he signed his books with
his full name, SAMUEL LANGHoRNE CLEMENs. It is usually
accepted as a fact that, amid much else, CLEMENS invented
his nom de guerre. Mr. PAINE tells us that it was “con-
veyed" from an older Mississippi pilot, who used it as the
signature to contributions confided to local journals. When
he died CLEMENs appropriated it and made it world-famous.
In the same generous fashion he borrowed from another
river-pilot the story of “The Jumping Frog” that gave him
his first taste of fame.
MARK TwAIN was one of the few humourists of later days
whose conversation in its freshness and quaintness did not
fall short of the attractiveness of the printed page. Effect
was added by a delicious drawl and a countenance whose
stolidity seemed to deepen as his audience shook with
laughter. Wandering through the morasses of these three
volumes the reader will hap upon many passages which
help him to realize the simplicity, sincerity and lovable-
ness of MARK Twain. His life was crowned by one of its
latest episodes. Finding himself in his sixtieth year
financially ruined by commercial connections, he, like Sir
WALTER Scott, put on again discarded harness and worked
till his creditors were paid in full. Striking resemblance in
the lives of two great writers is increased by the circum-
stance that in both instances ruin was brought about by

days of greater hurry and shorter life its record of wearisome
embarkation in the trade of publishing.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Much good reading is to be found in Queen Anne, by
HERBERT PAUL (Hodder AND Stoughton). This is a new
and revised edition. The first was published by Messrs.
Goupil, AND Co. in 1906, with numerous illustrations. To my
regret I cannot remember it, but I venture a guess that the
illustrations were reckoned the more important part of the
book. Now the letter-press is set free from the super-
incumbent weight of the pictures and has a chance to speak
for itself, a chance of which it makes very good use. The
book is an account of the political, literary and social life of
England in the time of the Queen whose chief titles to fame
are that her country produced many great men during her
reign, and that she herself, poor woman, having had seven-
teen children and lost them all, is now in quite a special
sense dead. We all know our HERBERT PAUL by this time
—the agreeable crispness of his manner, the short sentences
packed so full of meaning that each one may in itself represent
a pamphlet or a book, the occasional pleasant discursive-
ness when a subject particularly attracts him, and the
many-faceted brightness of the whole. What Mr. PAUL
of sugar and all the rest of it. There is one pleasing inno-
vation in The Mystery of 31, New Inn (HopDER AND
Stoughton). John Thorndyke is every whit as infallible
as Holmes, and Jervis displays an almost super-Watsonian
density, yet never once does the former permit himself a
touch of irritability. And that, mind you, was no mean
feat, for this is the sort of conversation they used to have:—
Thorndyke: “You never suspected that the coachman and
Weiss were one and the same person?” Jervis (amiably):
“No. How could they be 2 They weren't in the least
alike.”
Lady Jeffreys, the flighty young wife of Sir Baldwin
Jeffreys, was detected in a midnight assignation with
Lieutenant Carrington by her young sister, Boadicea. It
was the kind of assignation that indiscreet wives do give
gentlemen on our virtuous comedy stage—compromising,
but Quite All Right Really. However, when Sir Baldwin
came thundering on the door, his lady had only just time
to invent the lie that her sister was the object of the
Lieutenant's suit. And

a feeling that I have
been badly used. Mr. Richard WASHBURN CHILD has
written a book called The Blue Wall (Constable). It has
all the marks of the detective story, which I love. The
frontispiece depicts an anxious-looking man in a strained
attitude, with moonlight all over him: some of the chapter-
headings are, “The House Next Door,” “A Moving Figure,”
“The Face,” “A Shadow on the Curtain,” and “A Visitor
at Night”—oh, yes, and “The Scratching Sound”; I was
nearly forgetting that; and on page 32 one of the characters
gasps, “Something is going on—some ghastly, horrible
tragedy.” Promising, I think. There is the heroine, all
alone in that sinister house. Her life hangs in the balance,
you guess. Not a bit of it. He caught me like that, too.
Her life is in no danger whatsoever. All that has happened
is that she has contracted the morphine habit and has shut
herself up to try to cure herself. If Mr. CHILD thinks it fair to
spring an anti-climax like that on a trusting public after
twenty-three chapters of bated breath and scratching noises,
there is no more to be said; and I turn in wounded silence
to Mr. R. AUSTIN FREEMAN, who, curiously enough, asks me
precisely the same question as did Mr. CHILD–to wit, “What
is it that is happening at that house?” It is all right this
time. It was murder right enough—good, honest murder,

undeniably effective that I will not spoil your enjoyment

inevitably into speaking of Baroness ORczy's latest pro-
duction in terms of the theatre; I should add that for the
present it is a novel called Meadowsweet, and published by
Messrs. HUTCHINsoN. But if ever a tale was predestined
for the footlights this is it. For all the effect of real life
created, the characters might as well have talked frankly
in dialogue, with stage directions. Two of them, about
whom I have not spoken, sound the very abysm of comic
relief. But there are some good acting parts; and I
certainly look forward to witnessing that letter scene in
the last Act.

Europe's Ministerial purlieus,
Save where someone opes his lung
In a wailing like a curlew's:–
“He is dying ! There is no
Chance for dear old STATUs Quo!”
Softly fall the steeléd feet
Of the First-class Christian Nations;
All the Chancellors you meet
Seem to be his near relations;
Murmuring, “We shall miss him. Oh,
How we loved old STATUs QUO !"
Long they'd patched his tender spot,

;If, one day, a fatal blow
Finished good old STATUS Quo!"
Now the Powers, the Great (and Good)–
All their men and all their horses —
Cannot, even if they would,
Reconstruct his vital forces;
Cannot rectify the low -
Pulse of poor old STATUs Quo.
Only they who knocked him out,
Whom his sorry plight he owes to,
They, the little powers, no doubt,
Could revive him if they chose to ;-
But they won't ; they say, “What ho!

Very flatly their surprise |
At his sudden taste for dying:—
“Why, we told you long ago,
All was up with STATUs Quo 1"

The Saturday Review, commenting
on a speech by the KAISER, says:–
“He can speak of the deep things without
unction or any offensive at-homeness in
Zion. To be able to speak like that is
worth many blazers.”
This is a new and useful currency of
esteem. We hope to be able by-and-

EFFICIENCY.
Very urgent.
To PRIVATE PARKINs.
As you have not yet fired your stan-
dard Test in Musketry, this is to remind
you that Saturday next is the last pos-
sible day, and if you fail to pass you
will not be efficient, and will render
yourself liable to prosecution.
(Signed) J. BLANKY BIANK,
- Capt. and Adjt.
I rang the bell and sent to the nursery
for Felicity. It was Felicity who was
responsible. It was Felicity who had
told me in June how splendid I should
look in uniform. In July it was Fe-
licity (and her cat) who had practised
“forming fours” with me on the lawn.
It was Felicity who, on the fateful first
|of August, had packed me off to Camp
with my equipment fastened on wrong
way up, and a hot-water bottle (shade
of Horatius!) in my kit-bag. It was
Felicity, therefore, who should now
encounter the full tide of my reproach.
The door opened, and my little
daughter came in.
I showed her the alarming document.
“What do you make of that?” I asked.
She gazed at it solemnly.
“Oh, Papa,” she said, “you have
been and gone and done it.” - -
“On the contrary,” I replied, “I
have not been and gone and done it.
That is just the trouble: and I, blame
you entirely. I knew from the start
these military operations would end in
a cry." - w
“What's to-day?” she asked. .
I enlightened her. . . ;
“The day,” I said, “is Saturday.
The hour is 3 P.M. Lighting-up time,
4.30 P.M. Venus is an evening star.
Vegetables in season are—”
“Papa,” she cried, “we must order
the car round at once.” -
I looked out of the window.
“I might conceivably shoot by
candle-light,” I said, “but working
under such conditions I can hardly
expect to make a good score.”
“Can you shoot anyway?”
asked.
* Shoot?” I exclaimed. “My dear
child! Do think before you speak. But,
as a matter of fact, I shall be a little
out of practice. I believe the last time
I handled a rifle was that evening at
Earl's Court.”
“And then you only hit one glass
ball, you know.”
“Glass ball, indeed,” I cried indig-
nantly. “I shot the running Rhino-
ceros at ten yards—twice.”
“Did you? Good. Well, I'll run
up and dress immediately.”
“You are not coming,” I said. “I
she
Felicity drew herself up and clapped
her heels smartly together.
“If there is to be danger,” she said,
“then I am coming as a nurse.”
Half an hour later we descended from
the car, I in my immaculate top hat,
fur overcoat and spats, Felicity en-
veloped in what she describes as her
musquashes, with a red cross on her
left arm; and by forced marches across
ploughed fields and over five-barred
gates, we reached the rifle range.
A sergeant attired in khaki was
having his tea in the pavilion. . .
Carrying our umbrellas at the trail,
we marched in and presented arms.
“Prepare for night operations,” I
said. º . -
He responded to my greeting with
little or no enthusiasm, It appeared
that I had no business to put it off till
the last moment; that he had been
there all day, and now would probably
miss his train. We found him quite
brusque, even for a sergeant. . . .
“Come, come, fellow,” I said. “Pro-
duce the fire-arm. I am chafing for
the conflict.” - -
He selected a weapon, and we went
out to the firing line. On the way I
made them a short address: “‘Would
that we now had here,' " I said, “‘but
one ten thousand of those men in Eng-
land who do no work to-day.'" . . .
“The fewer men,’” said Felicity,
“‘the greater share of honour. Oh, do
not wish one more.'" . . . . .
A grunt from the sergeant seemed to
indicate his concurrence with this view.
* . Presently we arrived at a place where
a piece of dissipated-looking cocoanut
matting was spread upon the ground.
“Lie down,” he commanded.
... “Lie down 2" I exclaimed.
“Yes, lie down,” repeated the ser-
geant unmoved.,
I turned to Felicity.
“Run back to the car, my dear, and
tell the chauffeur to bring a couple of
rugs.” - -
“Oh, Papa,” she protested, “we can-
not afford the delay. It is the time for
prompt action.”
“Well, well,” I said. “It is the
fortune of War.” And giving her my
beautiful hat I prostrated myself with-
out further hesitation.
“Now take careful aim,” said the
sergeant, indicating the target. “Go
steady.”
“I know all about it,” I replied.
“First I give it a slow and well-directed
fire. Then I crawl up closer and give
it a rapid and devastating fire. Then,
under cover of that, I fix my bayonet,
rise with a loud yell and charge it."

Being an account of the recent amazing

- CHAPTER I.
...PROFEssoR BILLINGER, the great
| sporting agent of St. James's Street,
was the most extraordinary thing I
| ever saw ; and, being both a Rugby
| International and a pushing journalist,
| I have seen a good deal. If he re-

cocoanuts with eyes and beards in
famous big-game hunter, collector of
bibelots, and nut. Next, Professor
Winterly, Billinger's bitter rival and
a profound disbeliever in the truth-
fulness of his inventories. Lastly,
myself, who was to write an account
of everything that happened and send
it every night to my paper, no matter
how far away from civilization we
might be, and incidentally to win
Gladys. Whether or not she was
really worth winning, I never quite
made up my mind; but the motive has
a romantic flavour. - - -

before. We looked in vain for their
bones. After many days' travelling
we reached an unclimbable cliff.
“We’re up against it this time, no
bloomin’ error,” said Lord John.
Winterly was silent, but he looked at
Billinger with a sardonic expression
that said as plainly as words, “I told
you so.” “Unclimbable, is it 7” said
Billinger. “Wait a moment; ” and
drawing out his tobacco-pouch he filled
it with free hydrogen from a neigh-
bouring geyser, attached our four
saddles to it, and such was the buoyancy
of the gas that we were almost
instantly at the top of the cliff. I
never had a more exhilarating ride.
Once there, for at least five, minutes
Winterly ceased to jibe, such was the

appalling experience of
my life. I met a masto-

Street left either by the window or an
ambulance, or both.
This sounds unprepossessing, but
since only Billinger's agency knew
where the best pterodactyl ºf
and mastodon stalking were to be had,
and since I had to do a little of each in
order to win Gladys and satisfy the
editor of The Daily Trail that I was
worth my salt, I was forced to call
on him. Our interview began in his
office and finished in the St. James'
Park duck-pond, whither we had pro-
gressed locked in each other's arms and
rolling over and over to the complete
disorganization of the traffic. But—I
had secured the shooting !

his sub-acid humour, “I thought I
smelt a liar.” “You’re another,” said
Billinger, and it required all the tact
and physical strength of Lord John
Kangar and myself, exercised for two
hours, to separate them. Such contests,
both of sarcastic wit and fisticuffs, were
of daily occurrence. But, as Lord John,
who was a master of current slang,
said, “These young fellow-me-lads
must be allowed their little scraps—eh,

Professor Billinger was our spokes-

Professor Winterly brought down the

Billinger was thunderstruck. He re-
peated his statement and Winterly
repeated his interruption. At last
Billinger inquired what he meant by
“Question.” “I mean,” said Win-
terly, “that you are not unique.”
Billinger was speechless; he flung
himself at Winterly, but forty scientists

CHAPTER I.
...PROFEssoR BILLINGER, the great
| sporting agent of St. James's Street,
was the most extraordinary thing I
| ever saw ; and, being both a Rugby
{| International and a pushing journalist,
| I have seen a good deal. If he re-
| sembled anything it was one of those
cocoanuts with eyes and beards in
famous big-game hunter, collector of
bibelots, and nut. Next, Professor
Winterly, Billinger's bitter rival and
a profound disbeliever in the truth-
fulness of his inventories. Lastly,
myself, who was to write an account
of everything that happened and send
it every night to my paper, no matter
how far away from civilization we
might be, and incidentally to win
Gladys. Whether or not she was
really worth winning, I never quite
made up my mind; but the motive has
a romantic flavour. - * *

last arriving in the centre of South
America, four thousand miles from the
mouth of the Amazon (I am pledged
before. We looked in vain for their
bones. After many days' travelling
we reached an unclimbable cliff.
“We’re up against it this time, no
bloomin’ error,” said Lord John.
Winterly was silent, but he looked at
Billinger with a sardonic expression
that said as plainly as words, “I told
you so.” “Unclimbable, is it?” said
Billinger. “Wait a moment;” and
drawing out his tobacco-pouch he filled
it with free hydrogen from a neigh-
bouring geyser, attached our four
saddles to it, and such was the buoyancy
of the gas that we were almost
instantly at the top of the cliff. I
never had a more exhilarating ride.
Once there, for at least five, minutes
Winterly ceased to jibe, such was the
success of the experiment.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ONE OF OUR SUFFERERS.
THERE is no question before the
country of more importance than that
of National Health. In my own small
way I have made something of a study
of it, and when a Royal Commission
begins its enquiries, I shall put before
it the evidence which I have accumu-
lated. I shall lay particular stress upon
the health of Thomson.
“You’ll beat me to-day,” he said, as
he swung his club stiffly on the first
tee; “I shan't be able to hit a ball.”
“You should have some lessons,” I
suggested.
Thomson gave a snort of indignation.
“It's not that,” he said. “But I've
been very seedy lately, and " .
“That's all right; I shan't mind. I
haven't played a thoroughly well man
for a month, now." . . - -
“You know, I think my liver
I held up my hand. --
“Not before my caddie, please,” I
said severely; “he is quite a child.”
Thomson said no more for the mo-
ment but hit his ball hard and straight
along the ground. .5:-
“It's perfectly absurd," he said with
a shrug; “I shan't be able to give you
a game at all. Well, if you don't mind
playing a sick man—” - -
“Not if you don't mind being one,” I
replied, and drove a ball which also went
along the ground, but not so far as my
opponent's. “There! I'm about the
only man in England who can do that
when he's quite well.”
The ball was sitting up nicely for my
second shot, and I managed to put it
on the green. Thomson's, fifty yards
farther on, was reclining in the worst
part of a bunker which he had forgotten
about. -
“Well, really,” he said, “there's
an example of luck for you. Your
ball—”
“I didn't do it on purpose,” I pleaded.
“Don't be angry with me.”
He made two attempts to get out
and then picked his ball up. We
walked in silence to the second tee.
“This time,” I said, “I shall hit the
sphere properly,” and with a terrific
swing I stroked it gently into a gorse
| bush. I looked at the thing in disgust
and then felt my pulse. Apparently I
was still quite well. Thomson, for-
getting about his liver, drove a beauty.
We met on the green.
“Five,” I said.
“Only five?” asked Thomson sus-
piciously.
“Six," I said, holing a very long
putt.
Thomson's health had a relapse. He
took four short putts and was down in
“It's really rather absurd,” he said,
in a conversational way, as we went to
the next tee, “that putting should be so
ridiculously important. Take that hole,
for instance. I get on the green in a
perfect three; you fluff your drive com-
pletely and get on in-what was it?”
“Five,” I said again.
“Er—five. And yet you win the
hole. It is rather absurd, isn't it 2."
, “I’ve often thought so,” I admitted
readily. “That is to say, when I've
taken four putts. I’m two up.”
On the third tee Thomson's health
became positively alarming. He missed
the ball altogether.
“It's ridiculous to try to play,” he
said with a forced laugh. “I can't see
the ball at all.” - º
“It's still there,” I assured him.
He struck at it again and it hurried
off into a ditch.
“Look here,” he said, “wouldn't you
rather play the pro. 2 This is not much
of a match for you.” *
I considered. Of course a game with
the pro. would be much pleasanter
than a game with Thomson, but ought
I to leave him in his present serious
condition of health 2 His illness was
approaching its critical stage, and it
was my duty to pull him through if I
could.
“No, no,” I said. “Let's go on.
The fresh air will do you good.”
“Perhaps it will,” he said hopefully.
“I’m sorry I'm like this, but I've had
a cold hanging about for some days, and
that on the top of my liver— ”
“Quite so,” I said.
The climax was reached at the next
hole, when, with several strokes in hand,
he topped his approach shot into a
bunker. For my sake he tried to look
as though he had meant to run it up
along the ground, having forgotten
about the intervening hazard. It was
a brave effort to hide from me the
real state of his health, but he soon
saw that it was hopeless. He sighed
and pressed his hand to his eyes. Then
he held his fingers a foot away from
him, and looked at them as if he were
trying to count them correctly. His
state was pitiable, and I felt that at
any cost I must save him.
I did. The corner was turned at the
fifth, where I took four putts.
“You aren't going to win all the
holes,” he said grudgingly, as he ran
down his putt.
Convalescence set in at the sixth
when I got into an impossible place and
picked up.
“Oh, well, I shall give you a game
yet," he said. “Two down.”
The need for further bulletins ceased
at the seventh hole, which he played
“A-ha, you won't beat me by much,”
he said, “in spite of my liver.”
“By the way, how is the liver ?”
asked. -
“Your fresh-air cure is doing it good.
Of course it may come on again, but
” He drove a screamer. “I think
I shall be all right,” he announced.
“All square,” he said cheerily at the
ninth. “I fancy I'm going to beat
you now. Not bad, you know, con-
sidering you were four up. Practically
speaking I gave you a start of four
holes.”
I decided that it was time to make
an effort again, seeing that Thomson's
health was now thoroughly re-estab-
lished. Of the next seven holes I
managed to win three and halve two.
It is only fair to say, though (as
Thomson did several times), that I had
an extraordinary amount of good luck,
and that he was dogged by ill-fortune
throughout. But this, after all, is
as nothing, so long as one's health is
above suspicion. The great thing was
that Thomson's liversuffered no relapse;
even though, at the seventeerth tee, he
was one down and two to play.
And it was on the seventeenth tee
that I had to think seriously how I
wanted the match to end. Thomson
at lunch when he has won is a very
different man from Thomson at lunch
when he has lost. The more I thought
about it, the more I realized that I was
in rather a happy position. If I won,
I won—which was jolly; if I lost,
Thomson won—and we should have a
pleasant lunch.
However, as it happened, the match
was halved.
“Yes, I was afraid so,” said Thomson;
“I let you get too long a start. It's
absurd to suppose that I can give you
four holes up and beat you. It prac-
tically amounts to giving you four
bisques.”
“What about lunch 2" I suggested.
“Good; and you can have your
revenge afterwards.” He led the way
into the pavilion. “Now I wonder,”
he said, “what I can safely eat. I
want to be able to give you some sort
of a game this afternoon.”
Well, if there is ever a Royal Commis-
sion upon the national physique I shall
insist on giving evidence. For it seems
to me that golf, far from improving the
health of the country, is actually un-
dermining it. Thomson, at any rate,
since he has taken to the game, has
never been quite fit. A. A. M.

THERE is a sudden commotion in the
market-place. Bright eyes pop up above
apples, grapes, red wine, white cheeses,
tomatoes the size of plums, and plums
the size of tomatoes, for there is a sound
of horsehoofs in the distance. News
from the front At last we are to know
the truth ! - A buzz of conversation
arises, and a cheese is knocked over.
But it is only a farmer's wife, late in
from the country, seated in a prehistoric
vehicle, which also contains apples,
grapes, red wine, white cheeses, toma-
toes the size of plums, and plums the
size of tomatoes. The voices die away
and the bright eyes disappear, but
pulses continue to tº quickly, for we
have had a taste of War.
I purchase a tomato for my lunch,
and pass on. The tomato is no larger
than a plum, but in war one must shrug
one's shoulders at hardship.
II.
I have ridden out a mile from the
town in the direction of Muskub
A straight, dusty road stretches before
me; to the right lies a long, low, white

white. In the distance a motor-car is
speeding. Surely . . . but a close ex-
amination through field-glasses reveals
the fact that it is moving away from

An old man, slightly bent and a little
bowed in the legs, approaches. His
boots are dusty, though it rained only
a fortnight ago, and his nose is hooked.
He carries a basket; perhaps he may
bring news of the War. . . .
I address the man in English, in
French, in German, but he shakes his
head. I speak a few words in Welsh,
and say “Good morning” in Esperanto,
and still he only mutters something
in what I strongly suspect to be Serb,
a language with which I am not
acquainted. But a War Correspondent
is not thus easily baffled. Consulting
my compass, I point approximately in
the direction of Yanitza. He turns,
shades his eyes with his disengaged
hand, looks, and shakes his head. I
imitate with my fingers the motions of
two armies meeting in battle; again he
shakes his head. I point to the basket;
he opens it and offers me an unripe
tomato, which I politely decline. Nerv-
ing myself for a great effort, I dash
forward, emulating the movements of
cavalry advancing into action and at
a very fair imitation of big guns boom-
ing several miles away.
I look round. The man is gone. The
language of signs has failed me.
It is the fortune of War.
III.
The Press Censor sits in his office—a
cheerful, smiling little man, who receives
my telegram with infinite courtesy.
Suddenly he speaks a few words to
the orderly beside him, who instantly
produces a shining knife. The whole
thing has occurred so quickly that I
have barely time to pull out my pen,
and my heart hammers against my ribs
as I snatch off the cap. -
The orderly picks up the blue pencil
and sharpens it carefully. I sheathe
my pen and go out.

Sentries carrying rifles appear at the
street corners. It is nearly ten o'clock,
and at ten o'clock, by order of the

Above me the stars shine, but the
moon has either not risen or has sunk.
A sentry coughs.
The lights go out and the streets are
dark. Still the stars shine and there
is no moon. In the distance a clock
strikes slowly ten times.

Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.
ST. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL. “Sir, it is matter for painful regret to me that the Closure should curtail the arguments of the eager and
crowded ranks that face me.”
House of Commons, Monday, October
28.-Interesting treatise might be
written on subject of extinct volcanoes
in House of Commons. On historic
occasion Dizzy (in Opposition) touched
upon it. With characteristic lightness
he confined his observations to occu-
pants of Ministerial Bench and did not
carry them beyond a single sentence.
There are some score of men even in
the present House who would supply
material for a chapter in suggested
biographical work.
Take for example the Member for
Holderness Division of the East Riding
of Yorkshire. On his appearance in the
House a dozen years ago A. S. WILSON
at once assumed the leading position
natural to the modesty and energy of
youth. His activity was to some ex-
tent fettered by political situation of
the hour. One of the choicest fruits
of Khaki election, he, on taking his seat,
found himself a unit in overwhelming
majority under leadership of PRINCE
ARTHUR. In such circumstances, re-
peated to-day with a difference, there
is applicable a familiar nursery dictum.
Good Ministerialists, like good children,
may be seen but should not be heard.
It was after the great débâcle of
1905 that A. S. W. found his oppor-
criminating and faithful constituency,
he was one of a minority without hope,
temporarily without a leader. Here
was his chance, and he made the most
of it. “Are we downhearted ?” the
decimated Opposition feebly asked each
other. Stridently the negative sounded
from back Bench above Gangway to
left of SPEAKER, where sat the realised
hope of the Holderness Division of
the East Riding of Yorkshire. With
light heart he confronted triumphant
inisters seated in gateway of their
overcrowded camp. By questions per-
tinent and impertinent, by interruption
of ordered speeches, by inopportune
outbursts of ironical cheering, he kept
the Unionist flag flying.
Of late years a change came o'er the
spirit of his dream. Although, with
reasonable measure of regularity, his
face was seen in the familiar quarter,
his voice was never heard.
Spell broken to-night by fresh testi-
mony of Ministerial tyranny. Suddenly
the volcano, regarded as extinct, burst
afresh in flame. At four o'clock this
afternoon House resumed Committee
on Home Rule Bill, taking in hand
Clauses W. and VI., with knowledge
that, if discussion were not concluded
at 10.30, aid of guillotine would be
of one of half a hundred amendments
to Clause V. when fateful blade fell.
Amendments ruthlessly cut away;
Clause added to Bill.
Then the soul of A. S. WILson stirred
within him. The silence of several ses-
sions was broken. “Do you call this
fair discussion ?” he inquired, address-
ing himself pointedly to CHANCELLOR
of ExchEQUER. No reply forthcoming,
he supplied it. “It is a perfect farce,”
he roared.
Having once more found his voice,
he used it with even greater effect
when in due course Clause WI. was
submitted from the Chair, without a
moment's discussion of the many
amendments that filled the paper.
“Not one word of discussion,”
A. S. W. remarked. That was perhaps
obvious. What followed made amends
for anything approaching the common-
place. Bending forward in his seat,
unconsciously making with left hand
gesture as if drawing atoga more closely
over his shoulder, he stretched an
accusing forefinger towards faltering
figures on Treas Bench opposite,
and declaimed the following lines:—
Go and tell the country you are not allowing
Free discussion on the Home Rule Bill.
Something in stinging melody of the

tunity. Returned again by a dis-

It is the invariable habit,

away to order the dinner.
That morning I went out stealthily
and bought a dozen boxes of Cygnet
Pine Vestas and locked them up care-
fully in the drawer of my writing-desk.
A few days afterwards, when Elmira
came to dust it (this, of course, can-
not be entrusted to a servant), she
tried to open the locked drawer.
“Hallo! what's in there?” she said.
“Nothing," I answered, blushing,
rather guiltily. “Nothing-only some
old things I was going to burn."
Elmira turned rather pale. She did
not speak, but I feel convinced that
this is not the end. Next time that I
am out in the evening there will be a
rather dramatic little episode in our

end of the room in a crouching attitude,

BACON'S SYMPHONIES.
THE wide range of works hitherto
attributed to other authors but now
incontestably proved to have emanated
from the brain and pen of the omni-
scient BAcon has been further enlarged
by a momentous discovery, details of
which have been communicated to us
by the famous composer, Professor
Bilger.
Briefly stated, the discovery amounts
to this, that BAcox=BEETHove N +

“CALLISTo" AND “THE LITTLE
DREAM.”
WHEN the first scene of Mr. MAURICE
HEwlFTT's Ballet without words
showed us an Academy for Young
Gentlewomen (kept by Artemis) going
through their callisthenics with a very
perfect propriety, I wondered a little
what the author was doing in so correct
a company. But when one of the
pupils Callisto, was rusticated for un-
sociable conduct, and to her, in her
solitary depression, entered a piping
Faun (Mr. FRASER OUTRAM), who exe-
cuted a delightful MAURICE dance, I
recognised my HEWLETT, and was con-
fident that the young lady would shortly
be consoled. (I hope, by the way, that
Callisto, in her subsequent home-life
with the Faun, hinted to him that there
should be a more obvious collusion
between his pipe and the orchestral
flute.) Miss MARGARET MoRRIs was
really excellent in all moods—virginal,
amorous, maternal—for Callisto be-
from the period of Pan, and several
symbolic dancers of no particular era.
It was like a canvas by Mr. SIGISMUND
GortzE. As for the goat-god, I think
he must have drifted in by mistake out
of Mr. HEwleTT's ballet. I was not
surprised that the health of the cow-
girl from the Dolomites visibly declined
in this riotous atmosphere. My wonder
was reserved for Miss MARGARET MoRRIs,
that so intelligent a lady should have
chosen an allegory that offered so few
natural openings to her company of
dancers.
Mr. GALsworthy's allegory was fol-
lowed by a selection from a generous

dolorous and repentant. A charming
dance-suite and very well suited to the
capacity of Miss MoRRIs' pupils.
I cannot honestly say the same for
Mr. GALsworthy's Little Dream. On
paper it would probably be pleasant
enough, but for stage purposes it was
too full of impracticable allegory. Its
motive was the moral contrast between
the appeal of Nature's solitude and the
attractions of the life of the town. The
two were typified in the solid flesh
by a native guide and a mountaineering
tourist from the gay city—each in love
with a soft-spoken and very ladylike
cow-girl, resident among the Dolomites.
They were also represented, with equal
solidity, by two local peaks, the Cow
Horn and the Wine Horn. Taking
turns, with the limelight alternately on
each to show which was supposed to
be speaking, these two dangerous peaks
threw off a deal of sombre rhetoric
illustrative of their respective points of
view. I never rightly understood, by
the way, the nice distinction drawn
between this pair of natural excrescences
—why one mountain should represent
the aloofness of Nature, and the other
(no less a part of Nature) should typify
the whirl of human society.
Anon, on the wings of a dream, we

programme of isolated dances. It suf-
fered a check, I understand, from the
intervention of the London County
Council, who insisted on putting the
children to bed by 10 P.M. Another
difficulty was the darkness of the
auditorium, which compelled me to
step out into the lighted passage if I
wanted to identify the item in the
programme. Miss KATHLEEN DILLON
danced a very charming “Sylphide,” but
the best performance was Miss MAR-

an extremely decorous “Bacchanale,”
which, apart from Miss MoRRIs's share
in it, might have figured with acceptance
in the programme of any school-girls'

I venture to compliment the Mistress
of the Ceremonies. Miss MoRRIs has a
youthful and gracious figure (would I
could say as much of all our “classical"
dancers!); a most intelligent face, not
given to vacant smiling; a fine supple-
ness of limb; and an instant sensitive-
ness for the suggestions of her theme.
And, if she cannot impart all her trained
gifts to her young pupils, she has at
least taught them something more than
the first principles of an art which can
never be learnt in perfection without
ripe experience and the development
of individuality. And by that time the
gift of youth, the best gift of all, is so
often gone. O. S.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ZACYNTHUS.
I NoTICE that Mr. PLowDEN, of the Marylebone Police
Court, has been giving his views on the various tests of
drunkenness and that he doesn't think much of those usually
applied by the doctors—which is another blow to that
suffering profession. -
I happen to be in a position to give Mr. PLow DEN some
valuable help, for I possess the diaries of the Rev.
Augustus Strongitharm, formerly of St. Paul's College,
Oxford, who served his College and his University in
many capacities, and was noted among his contemporaries
for a dry and genial humour. At first sight there would
not appear to be a very close relation between a College
Don and the subject of drunkenness, but it must be
remembered that Mr. Strongitharm was for some time
a Proctor, and was thus brought into collision with
many noisy young men, flown with insolence and wine, at
a period when Oxford had not yet adopted the temperate
methods of to-day. Mr. Strongitharm, it will be seen,
had his own tests and found them very successful.
Here are some extracts from his MS. volumes:—
Nov. 5, 185–.—Usual Town and Gown disturbances,
but nothing serious. Intercepted a party of ten under-
graduates. They fled, leaving one in my hands. He
swayed a great deal from side to side, as well as backwards
and forwards, so I asked him to repeat after me the words
“my eldest brother is a rascal.” At first he refused, saying
he was not there to have his family insulted. Afterwards
pleaded he was an only son, but finally consented, and
did fairly well. Being asked to spell the word “rascal”
he laughed loudly and made the attempt, saying with
great solemnity “r—a—l—s—c—a,” and adding that
he knew he'd got the “1” in all right, and didn't care
about the rest. He must be admonished.
Nov. 18, 185––Salter, the youngest Fellow, distresses
me by his inability to carry his wine like a gentleman.
In Common Room to-night he grew noisy. Finally, to
test him, I asked him if he had read As You Like It.
Replied that he knew the blessed thing by his blessed
heart. Told him to say quickly—
Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
That shall civil sayings show.
A ghastly failure. He then retired in dudgeon. The
story will be all over Oxford to-morrow.
May 26, 185——Bump suppers everywhere. Had a
most lively and amusing evening. Met ten oarsmen, five
being carried pick-a-back by the others. Engaged them
in conversation and found them in a rather genial state
of melancholy. Asked them one after another to repeat
after me—“The British constitution is suited to British
citizens and the constitution of Zacynthus is suited to
Zacynthus's citizens.” . None of them got clear through
the first three words, but they all insisted on repeating
the whole passage and laughed heartily at one another.
We broke up with three cheers for Zacynthus.
I have numerous additional examples if Mr. PLowden
would like them.
From an account in The Daily Mirror of “B.-P.'s"
wedding present to his wife:
“The lettering is in green and gold. On the left side is a boy scout
sitting at case on his staff.”
A common editorial feat.
“Advertiser, having £4 Income, requires Partner £1500 to £2000.”
Advt. in “Scotsman.”
SUGAR.
[A suggestion has been made that men should take to eating sweets
instead of drinking alcohol. The results are said to be the same.]
Away, O juices of the grape, away!
To you and all strong waters, white or red,
I have been loyal, I regret to say,
For many a year; but now your spell is dead.
I do recant; and, from this present day,
I shall eat sweets instead.
I shall no longer, howsoe'er I pine,
Tackle the noonday dram or vinous lunch;
It shall suffice me, even when I dine,
Some saccharine substitute alone to munch;
Nay, I will conquer a strong taste of mine
For midnight brews of punch.
For there is news that gives one much to think,
News that the faculty has noised abroad,
That all the cheer and stingo of the Drink—
The alcoholic drink—is but a fraud;
That sugared almonds, be they white or pink,
Do just as well, when gnawed.
I am a faddist, and embrace this fad,
And, though it something try me at the first,
Some chocolate (how cheap) when I am sad,
Some acid-drops (how simple) when athirst,
Will do—and these combined will give a glad
Feeling when on the burst.’
And why? ... 'Tis known that lovers of the grape
Put on a bibulous aspect plain to see,
Which has too often cooked their amorous goose,
Maids jibbing at the same; and it may be
That the bland sweet may work, with temperate use,
A dulcet spell on me.
And when that sugaring process is complete,
And I am sweetened for the privilege,
Of Julia then this boon will I entreat
(Ah, heaven!) that I may take a box and pledge
Her with a sweet, both from and to the sweet,
She having kissed its edge. DUM-DUM.
HOOTS 1
IN a dissertation on the hooting nuisance, Mr. FILson
YoUNG writes as follows (the italics are his): “Let the
sounding of horns be prohibited for one month, say, in the
Mayfair area, and then let the corpses be counted. I don't
think there would be many.”
Quite by chance we obtained in the palm court of the
Hotel Cecil a quaint transatlantic view of the suggestion.
“I have just seen in one of your evenin' noospapers,”
said a shrewd-looking man, “the smartest advertisement
I have ever read on this side. Here it is, Sir-right
slap in among matter, and printed in eyetalics so’s to look
like a li'erary extract which is too good to miss. Yes, Sir,
I guess this Mayfair undertaker of yours is the slickest
burier you've got; and if I ever die in this country I shall
send for this FILson YoUNg. I'm a business man, and I'd
like to be buried by a business man.”
War Note.
“The Isle of Man,” we read, “has proclaimed its neu-
trality.” This is a nasty set-back for the Greeba Castle
contingent which Mr. HALL CAINE had thought of raising
A very natural desire.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. GALsworthy's new volume of collected comments of
life and letters is happily named The Inn of Tranquillity.
Mr. HEINEMANN's windmill decks its title-page. It is a
sober, restful and gentle book. Through it shines, with
almost too intimate a sense of personality, so that one seems
somehow to be eavesdropping, the sensitive, perplexed
temperament of the fastidious and reflective weaver of
exquisite words. One will place the studies according to
one's bent. That of the two German brothers, bootmakers,
with their splendid pride in their craft and their ultimate
financial failure, is a beautiful sombre piece of portraiture,
lighted with a human tenderness. The shafts of biting
irony in “My Distant Relative "—the inveterate discreet
sponger on aunts and others, who feels so strongly that the
poor are being demoralised by having things done for them
and thereby losing their fighting power—hits the very
gold. It is written in a mood entirely characteristic of
the maker of The Silver Bor. “The Black Godmother,”
which describes a stupid unintentional cruelty to a dog, is
almost too poignant in its revelation of the writer's tender-
ness for the dumbly suffering. “Memories,” another dog
study, will delight those who recall John, the spaniel of The
Country House. But one runs on. There are deeper
matters of criticism, speculation and protest; delicate
matters of fancy. A rebuke to scribblers in the matter of
overwriting themselves is given in “Wanted—schooling.”

all find so entirely convenient and are all too much of,
literary snobs to commit—save by accident. After all

Never having travelled in Andalucía, or for the matter
of that in any other part of Spain, I am, I conceive, ex-
ceptionally well qualified to comment on The Guadalquivir
(CoNSTABLE), a book written by PAUL Gwyn NE. It does
not, however, require a very large ignorance of the country
described to appreciate Mr. Gwyn NE's book, for it has
qualities that must commend it even to the most extensive
Spanish travellers. It is the work of a man who is not
only shrewd and observant, but also sympathetic and
humorous—humorous, that is to say, without ostentation.
He tells us that anything we like in his olla podrida is due
entirely to his assistants. He gives a list of them, which
includes CERVANTEs (believed by some, he says, to have
largely assisted BAcon in the writing of Don Quixote),
VELAsquez, MURILLo, and, in addition to these spiritual
companions, DoN ANGEL PizARRo Y CABAs, who lent his
corporal presence and who, though being made in the outer
semblance of a brigand, possessed the most constant and
patient kindness the author has ever met with in man.
In reading this book I have found myself drawn almost
insensibly by a spirit of agreeable banter from page to page
and from chapter to chapter. I should have liked to linger
at Villahueca or Villaharta, two neighbouring villages whose
inhabitants detest and despise one another with an intense

And it is really jolly to find so fastidious a writer approv-

white-washed cottage in the latter place blush vivid rose-
colour. Villaharta has a church without a steeple. And
why? Because the people of Villaharta are so stupid that,
when the steeple was half-built and they had no more
material, they began pulling out the stones from underneath
to place them on the top.” Willaharta, on the other hand,
knows that the inhabitants of Villahueca are sulky, ignorant,
boorish, idiotic and immoral. Mr. Gwynne approves
patriotism and says “be hanged to the brotherhood of
man.” The book is agreeably and appropriately illustrated,
but I failed to discover the name of the artist.
There is an undoubted fascination in the spectacle of an
unpunished criminal doing good with his ill-gotten gains.
Even if the gains were gotten considerably after his crime,
and have no connection with it, the charm is almost as
great. Such a central figure made the fortune of that most
effective of melodramas, The Silver King; and might have

wood, whose girlhood's love returns, as such persons do in
books, to clasp her to his elderly breast. This, to do it
justice, is an incident very tenderly and engagingly told.
But, as I say, my favourite figure was Caryll, and I have
only against him the feeling that as a most promising
criminal he hardly represents quite the “source of innocent
merriment” I had been led to expect.
According to the fat red book that tells me who everyone

can breathe freshness into characters and topics that have

as he was. We are asked to believe that this man, who,
until he inherited a fortune, had been a master in a boys'
college for seventeen years, did not know enough—generally
speaking—“to come in out of the rain.” Women simply
scared him out of the few wits he had, and when he went
to a registry office to engage servants he thought that he
had to give his character, and performed other amazing
(but not amusing) exploits while he was there. Neither can
I say much in favour of the girl who married him; she was
certainly robust enough and would have been a perfect
terror in a mixed hockey match, but her feminine qualities
left me cold. Among the crowd of disagreeable or eccentric
characters, one village girl, Melia Hann, is drawn so vividly
that I hope in his next book Mr. BURRE will give up
caricaturing duchesses—yes, there's a duchess—squires,
and parsons' wives, and give us some real studies of the poor.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
November 13, 1912.
THE PERFECT GOLFER.
As a set off to the life-like portrait,
drawn in Mr. Punch's last issue, of
Thomson, the very human golfer, who
ascribes his failures to his opponent's
luck and his own liver, I am tempted
to submit a slight sketch of the
perfect match-losing temperament as I
observed it—for the last time, I hope–
in the person of that paragon of golfers,
Gabriel Goodwin.
When we met on the first tee
yesterday his face wore an extreme
pallor, the result of a recent nasty
attack of influenza. -
“Going strong?" I asked, for I am
not in the habit of making concessions
to the health of my opponents.
“Never fitter in my life,”
answered cheerily.
“Been playing much lately?" I asked.
“No,” he said ; “but I'm always
better after a rest. I ought to do
pretty well to-day.”
He drove off and topped the ball
badly. As it approached the cross-
bunker a brave smile lit up his filmy
eye. “Serves me right,” he said
genially. Then, as the ball scrambled
over and lay clear beyond, “Tut! tut!”
he said with a frown; “just my luck!"
I responded with a hard low drive
that should have travelled 250 yards
at least, but it caught the bunker full in
the face and fell in.
“Just your luck!” he said, and was
obviously pained. And indeed I could
see that he took little pleasure in
winning the hole with three strokes to
spare.
On the second tee he sliced hopelessly
into the rough. “Funny thing,” he said;
‘ it isn't as if I wasn't feeling fit.'
I followed suit in the same direction.
“A bit off colour—what?” he said
sympathetically.
Both balls were lost. He left his
caddie to search for his, and came over
and found mine for me. His own was
never retrieved.
“All square,” I said. I saw no
occasion to refer to his bad luck, but he
clearly felt that the thing might be
weighing on my mind, so he just said,
“Mine was much the worse shot ; and,
anyhow, if I'd found my ball I doubt if
it would have been playable.”
At the seventh green (he was now three
up, in face of the most execrable fortune)
a marvellous recovery from a bunker
laid his ball dead.
“Good,” I said, for I could afford to
be lavish, having something in hand
this time. “Pure fluke,” he answered.
I had three putts for the hole and
scratched the first two of them.
“I'm afraid you're not in the best of
he
“Oh, I'm all right,” I answered
snappily. -
I had still a four-foot putt to win the
hole and missed it. “Have it again ' "
said Goodwin; “I put you off by telling
my caddie to keep still.” -
“The hole is halved,” I said coldly.
After the turn, where he was five up,
he visibly tired, and once or twice he
swayed as if he would fall. Indeed, at
the thirteenth hole, where a gallant
brassey shot just trickled him into the
water-bunker (two strokes later I
hopped it with a fluffed iron, without
protest on his part or comment on
mine) a touch of vertigo nearly toppled
him in while he was fishing his ball
out. “Anyhow, it wanted washing,”
was all he said.
At the sixteenth hole, after an un-
paralleled run of luck, I had him down
to one. Every time that I just fell short
of a bunker he would say, “Well
judged 1" and when I scraped through
he would say, “Hard luck! Took all
the run off your ball !” -
At the seventeenth he could hardly
stand, and missed a 9-inch putt. “All
square ' " I said, on a note of triumph.
“Anybody's game,” he replied brightly.
At the eighteenth he was within a
foot-and-a-half with his third. I had
to play the odd from fifteen yards away,
and the match was as good as over. At
the best I could only hope to halve it. I
putted desperately and lipped the hole,
laying him a dead stymie. He had two
for a half, and his plain business was to
take no risks. But a gay smile broke
over his wan cheek as he called aloud
for his niblick. “One seldom gets a
chance of trying this stroke,” he said,
“and now 's an excellent opportunity.”
I breathed a short sharp prayer that
he might knock me in and remain
outside himself.
He did.
“I've often wanted to see that done,”
he said, with a rippling laugh.
“My game !” I said.
“And well deserved,” said he, as he
offered me the price of a first-class ball.
“But we had no bet,” I said.
“Oh, but surely we had,” said he.
Being flushed with victory and in a
generous mood, I hadn't the heart to
deny him. -
“How did you get on with Goodwin?”
said the Secretary after lunch.
“Oh, I won all right,” I said.
“Then you've made him a happy
man. If there's one thing he enjoys
more than winning, it is being beaten.”
“Well, next time,” I said, “I think
I'll play with someone who makes
excuses on the score of health, and
blames his luck and complains of
satisfaction that way. There's no fun
in beating these inhuman angels. I'd
as soon whack an indiarubber bogie.”
O. S.
THE SNOW-WHITE LIE.
HE is sixty-five years of age and
usually looks it. A tall ruddy man,
with a great shock of iron-grey hair,
and, though walking a little creakingly,
as sons of the soil must do in later
years, he is still active and powerful,
but—sixty-five. . . .
Now sixty-five is all right if you have
a good master and have been in his
employ for a long time; but sixty-five
is the devil if you are seeking a new
job. And Old Jack, as we have thought-
lessly called him (Heaven forgive our
want of prescience (), after seeming to
be as deeply rooted here as any tree,
was, three weeks ago, suddenly told that
he would not be wanted after that
Saturday. For how many years he
had lived in this village and done his
daily task on the same farm, I cannot
say, but certainly for nearly forty, and
never an hour off for illness in all that
time. And now he had to go; find a
new master, a new cottage; begin
again.
He tried near about, day after day,
for a week, but to no purpose, and then
began to extend his view, giving up all
hope of remaining among his old neigh-
bours, and one evening he brought me
an advertisement clipped from a paper.
“Would you mind answering that 2"
he asked ; for Jack did not want to be
beholden to his late employer for any-
thing, and he is one of those fortunate
creatures who can neither read nor
write.
So I answered it. I said that I had
known Jack for so long; that he was
sober, willing, agreeable, capable and
all the rest of it; and that he had been
dismissed through no fault of his own
but because the farmer was making
changes all round. And I added, “he
is fifty-eight.” And last night Jack
came to tell me he had got the place.
Jack's serious trouble will come when
it is time to draw his old-age pension;

[NoveMBER 13, 1912.
“INSTINCT.”
(An Instinctive Perversion of an evening
at the Duke of York's Theatre.)
THE FIRST ACT.
A sitting-room in the house of the well-
known American Surgeon, Bradford
Mandover, M.D., F.R.S.
Enter Walker.
Walker. I've come to see the doctor.
Mrs. Walker (slightly ruffled). I don't
quite know what my position is in this
house. In my last place housekeepers
didn't have to answer bells, like any
common servant. But I say nothing
of that. What I do say is that, whether
I am your wife or not—and the author
is none too clear upon the point—
you've no business here. Get out.
Walker. I've come to tell the doctor
about his wife's goings-on with this
young poet.
Mrs. Walker. You brute!
tress never goes-on.
Walker. Wait till you've read this
letter he's written her. It's the rough
copy of the one she's going to get
to-day. I picked it out of his fireplace.
Mrs. Walker. A likely story ! .
Walker (loftily). If you'd hever been
a student of the drama, Mrs. Walker,
you'd know that that sort of thing is
halways happening.
Eacit with dignity, followed by
- Mrs. Walker.
Enter Mrs. Mandover and her brother-
in-law, Arthur Mandover, M.D.
Mrs. Mandover. To continue our dis-
cussion about doctors—I must say I
think they are ignorant butchers.
Arthur (quietly). Did I ever tell you
the story of how my brother, at the
risk of his own life, failed to cure one
of his patients?
Mrs. Mandover. Dozens of times.
Arthur (annoyed). Oh! (Hopefully)
Still, the audience hasn't heard it.
Mrs. Mandover (rising). Then you
must tell them some other time.
You'll have plenty of opportunities of
talking before the play's over. Here's
Amy, and I must see her alone.
Eacit Arthur. Enter Amy Vane.
Amy. Well, I saw the poet and I
gave him your message.
Mrs. Mandover (eagerly). What does
he say?
Amy. Refuses to return your letters
and says he must see you once more to
say good-bye. Here's a fair copy of
the assignation. He spilt the ink over
the first draft.
Mrs. Mandover (reading the letter).
Amy, it's for to-night! I mustn't
Amy. He'll kill himself if you refuse.
At least, he said so, but men are so
My mis-
that 1 Rather than he should kill
himself, I will see him. We haven't
too many poets in America. (Reflecting)
Now where can I see him at half-past
eleven to-night 2
Amy (trying to help). In the green-
house? On the croquet lawn 2. In the
butler's pantry?
Mrs. Mandover (doubtfully). No-o-o,
no-o-o-o. (Suddenly) I have it! In
my bedroom |
Amy (a little surprised). Aren't you
thinking of Mr. HENRY KISTEMAECKERs'
other play, dear—The Turning Point 2
At the St. James's, you know?
Mrs Mandover (with simple dignity).
Why do you grudge me a bedroom
scene, Amy? Is there any reason why
I shouldn't have one too 2 -
Big-handed Bradford. “Another word and
I'll fall on you.”
Bradford Mandover Mr. C. AUBREY SMITH.
Mrs. Mandover Miss LILIAN BRAITH waite.
Amy. Of course not, dear. Only it
seems so funny of Mr. KISTEMAECKERs.
To keep on and on.
Mrs. Mandover. Really, I cannot help
that. Well, then, you will arrange it for
me? Thank you, darling. And if there's
ever anything I can do for you—if, for
instance, you want to marry my
brother-in-law . . . and take him right
away . . . well, you know how glad I
shall be to help you in anything.
Erit Amy.
Enter Bradford Mandover, M.D., F.R.S.
Mandover. Ah, I wanted to see you.
Mrs. Mandover. Well?
Mandover (grimly). I've just been
talking to Walker and, er—(decides not
to kill her)—I'm going to take you to
Switzerland to-morrow for your health.
Mrs. Mandover (staggered). Just you
and I–alone?
Mandover (sternly). Quite alone.
Mrs. Mandover (seeing a ray of com-
fort). Not even your brother, then 2
Mrs. Mandover oh, I shouldn't like
Mrs. Mandorer. Oh, well, that 's
something, anyway.
CURTAIN.
THE NExT Two ACTS.
The scene is the same, but the door at
the back, leading into Mrs. Mandover's
bedroom, has a way of opening. The
hour is late. - -
Mandover. Arthur, I was calm in
the First Act, but now I'm going to let
myself go. You've never seen me really
angry. (Rushes up and down the room.)
There! That shows you! My primeval
passions are roused I am a savage!
Arthur (putting the tips of his fingers
together). It would be interesting at
this point to discuss what is meant by
the veneer of civilisation. It won't take
more than twenty minutes. My view
is this. I hold that instinct is largely
the product of -
Mandover (succumbing to the instinct
of antagonism which Arthur arouses
in everybody). You are quite wrong.
Civilisation . . . (They discuss it ear-
haustively) . . . But, good heavens !
All this time my wife may be walking
about the park with the poet !
[He seizes a revolver and dashes out.
Enter Amy. •
Arthur (accusingly). You have taken
the poet to my sister-in-law's bedroom!
(Amy draws herself up.) It's no good
looking indignant; I know everything.
Amy (to the audience). And I used to
think I liked him once 1
Arthur. My brother may be back at
any moment with his revolver. It is a
matter of life and death that the poet
should be got away immediately. That
being so, I will devote the next ten
minutes to telling you what I think of
your behaviour in this matter. (Putting
the tips of his fingers together.) In the
first place—
[The bedroom door opens and Mrs.
Mandover appears in great distress.
Mrs. Mandover. Oh! oh! Nothing
like this ever happened in a St. James's
Theatre bedroom
Amy. What is it?
Mrs. Mandover. When I told him I
was going away to Switzerland he
fainted and hit his head against the
washstand He is dying !
Arthur (having entered the bedroom,
diagnoses the case rapidly, and re-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
AUTUMN MANOEUVREs.
I’ark Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--I've just been
putting in a week or two with Jack
and Dot Flummery at Flummery Park.
Jack's brothers, Dick and Tom, belong
to the Open-Air League now, and there
were some other members of the League
among the people down there. . Their
goings-on, my dear, are utterly and
absolutely ricky They had a row of
cots stood in the shrubbery, piled with
blankets, and there, if you please, they
pretended to sleep—each of them pro-
viding himself with a big umbrella in
case of rain At breakfast they made
a great show of being ravenous, of
feeling much better than mous autres,
and, generally speaking, of being very
sorry for everybody else. But they
looked wretched Someone asked if
they wouldn't have some brandy before
tackling their brekky, and one specially
nippy morning I said I supposed they'd
dreamed of discovering the North Pole
over again. Dick said, in his most
superior manner—and the open-air
manner, Daphne, is distinctly inclined
to be priggish—“Open-air people never
dream.” “No, poor things, I suppose
not,” I answered. “To dream, one
must be asleep!” -.
The way they forced their open-
airhood down our throats was, we
agreed, a little bit insufferable. For
instance, one evening, when we were
having some music, someone sang an
old Scotch song, “O wert thou in the
cauld blast, I'd shelter thee" (one
must be either Scotch or ragtime now),
and some of the open-air people got on
their hind legs and said the song was
drivel, that the person in the “cauld
blast " evidently belonged to the Open-
Air League and knew what was what,
and that the blighter who came
doddering round with his offers of
shelter was some blithering indoor
idiot' - -
Talking of ragtime, it really has been
quite a serious symptom. I hear that
at St. Agatha's the other Sunday the
congregation drifted into ragtime while
singing a hymn, and the dear rector
reproved them from the pulpit when
he began to preach; but before he'd
finished his sermon the dreadful thing
had seized him too, and he was preach-
ing in ragtime. -
I've a simply dilly bit of news for you.
This, my dearest, is to be a sideways
winter | The draping, the trimming, in
fact the whole effect of the new gown is at
one side, and, of course, the coiffure and
headgear follow suit. Par consequent,
front faces are quite quite out, and
you'd far, far better be dead! You
must decide which of your profiles you
like best, and be dressed and coiffee for
that side.
Some fortunate creatures have two
distinct profiles in different styles, and
both presentable. Babs, for instance,
has a retroussé, saucy profile, and a
straight, serious one ; so she can have
two perfectly distinct styles according
to which side she dresses for With
the sideways frock, jewellery and peltry
have fallen into line and reserve all
their best effects for one side. Oh
and another frightfully important thing
—the sideways toilet has brought with
it the sideways walk. All the forward
walks—the glide, the stride, and the
little frivolous pit-pat—are tombés dams
l'abime, and we're all proceeding a
l'écrevisse. Your Blanche is generally
considered to be the best exponent of
the new walk. (Proclaim it not from
the house-tops, dearest, but I've got a
big crab and take lessons from him
every day.)
The Bullyon-Boundermere woman
went to have some sideway frocks made
lately, and, after turning her two pro-
files—they're both equally past praying
for-to Olga, said, “Now which profile
shall I choose 2 Which side shall I
have the draping and trimming of the
gown at 2" Olga felt herself in a deep,
deep hole. She looked at the two
profiles, and then her artistic conscience
gained the day and she said, “I think
I should advise madame to have the
draperies and garniture derrière de la
robe.” “Which side is that ?” asked
the B.-B. woman.
Another leading feature of this
autumn is the passing of the girl and
even of the young married woman.
It's immensely correct just now to be
old, and there's quite a small rage for
grey hair. If years haven't made you
old, why, you must get there with a
grey wig and burnt cork, and, if you
want to be utterly and absolutely, you
must stoop a little, carry a gold-headed
stick, and sprinkle your chat with such
phrases as, “In my young days”; “I
don't know what the world's coming
to,” and so on. Yesterday Popsy Lady
Ramsgate was discussing the elderly
vogue with some of us—from the stand-
point of a juvenile, of course, or it
wouldn't be Popsy—and she wound up
by actually daring to say, “It's an
absurd fashion, but I suppose one must
follow it, and, if grey hair's de rigueur,
why, there's nothing for it but to wear
a wig' "
“Or not to wear one, as the case
may be,” said Beryl.
Norty says this is going to be a
distinctly lively session at Westminster.
mean to separate from the Scots and
set up for themselves. Then, he tells
me, Norfolk and Suffolk and a heap of
other counties are going to demand the
revival of the Heptarchy, and intend to
have their own Witenagemote (N. says,
for his part, he thinks a Witenagemote
sounds a distinct improvement on the
House of Commons, where wit is con-
spicuous by its absence!) Outre cela,
my dearest, the people of the Isle of
Wight and Hampshire, where the Jutes
originally settled, are going to give
notice that for the future they will
consider themselves Jutes, have Jute
Home Rule, and talk nothing but Jute.
It will be a long business, I daresay,
for, as Norty says, before the Hept-
archy people and the Jutes can speak
their own languages they'll have to
learn them, and it won't be a bit easy
to find anyone to teach either Jute or
Hep. .
Everyone in town just now is going
to the Natural Theatre, a quaint little
barn of a place, but with a great mission.
It is a reaction against the elaborate
mounting of plays, against the modern
form of drama, in short, against almost
everything. There are no carpets,
curtains, cushions or pretty-pretties of
any kind. The audience sit on plain
wooden benches. The stage scenery is
drawn by children on big slates, there
are no footlights, the stage being lit by
a candle or two, and no make-up is
used. The management say they are
there to show “common-place, every-
day life, where common-place things
happen and common-place things are
said.”
They say no author who writes for
them is to “grin over the shoulders of
his characters and let off epigrams,”
and no actor is to “get between a
character and the audience by making
points and by elocutionary effects.”
Nothing particular ever happens in the
plays, but they call a spade a spade to
any extent, and so the Natural Theatre
is always full! There are no Acts and
no curtain to come down, and one
would never know when the play "is
over (for it gives no clue to that itself)
if it were not for a voice calling out
from the darkness at the back of the
stage—“That's all—get out !”
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
“There were about 6,000 spectators, and
amongst them was the Prince of Wales, whom
I saw with a couple of his college chums stroll-

She covered the book I was reading

dropped into a chair. Gabrielle is a

“Still smashing windows?” I queried.
“I didn't come to discuss politics,
uncle,” she said, “but to remind you
that to-morrow is my twenty-first
birthday.”
I am not one of those who deny that
women can be businesslike.
“I had not forgotten it,” I answered,
“and I have already sent you, with my
best wishes, a present which I hope will
prove worthy of this truly memorable
occasion. It should reach you in the
morning.” -
“Oh, you perfect uncle!” cried she.
“Do tell me what it is.”

I surrendered. “Do you remember,
Gaby,” I asked, “what your weak-
minded uncle gave you when you
attained the age of ten ?”
“Perfectly,” said she. “You gave
me ten coins—a farthing, a halfpenny,
a penny, a threepenny bit, a sixpence,
a shilling, and so on—and I honestly
believe it was the best birthday present
I ever had.”
“I hope you will find this even
better. To tell the truth, Gaby, I was
in a difficulty, and it has caused me a
lot of worry. I wanted to give you
something handsome, you see, in view
of the unique nature of the festival, but
for the life of me I couldn't think what.
I couldn't consult you because I wished
it to come as a surprise, and that is
why on second thoughts I'm not going
to tell you anything more about it now.”
“Go on,” said Gaby.
“Very well,” I agreed meekly after
a pause. “I have sent you twenty-one

ES S E N C E OF P A R L | A M E N T.
PRINCE ARTHUR (complacently reflecting during Home Rule debate). “Poor old BonAR
has to keep awake!”
House of Commons, Monday, Novem-
ber 4.—“It is a curious position we're
in on this Bill,” said BonneR LAw just
now ; “discussing academically, as if
we were a debating society, questions
like Proportional Representation and
Woman Suffrage.”
This reflection presents with simple
force a view of the extraordinary, un-
precedented character of debate going
forward from day to day in Committee
on Home Rule Bill. All know what
was expected when the business began.
Seemed probable that the riots which
marked passage of Bill of 1893 would
be exceeded in respect of eruption of
temper and spilling of gore. And here
we are night after night boring each
other to death with vain repetition and
debating - society disquisition on ab-
stract questions.
The only man who keeps the flag
flying is Captain SNoDGRAss CRAIG.
Only the other night, as recorded at
the time, he gave notice to whom it
might concern that he was beginning
to take off his coat. To-night at
Question-time he went straight to the
point.

Nationalist Parliament proposed to be
set up under the Government of Ire-
land Bill, against their expressed de-
termination and the terms of the
solemn league and covenant they had
entered into ?”
There you have it. No circumlo-
cution. No beating about the bush of
proportional representation, canals in
the planet Mars, and the like. Amid
the sleepy haze that lies low over the
House the glorious Ulster Day is in peril
of being forgotten. Dim are memories
of its martial pomp, its deadly wooden
guns, its royal escort of middle-aged
barristers bent on breaking the law.
This simple question flashes it all back
again. At last attention is focussed on
real issue, the actuality evaded by all
this talk round and round about the
inane.

possible for him at present stage to add
anything to statements made by him

answers. It followed that none could

approve their conclusions. Whilst

as usual, I am beginning to wonder how much I really
enjoy the performance. I am not referring to the humani-

begin to think of it, you're bound to acknowledge that
you've no mortal right to take or to attempt the life of
anything in that blundering uncertain way. On the other
hand there's your sporting primeval spirit and there's your
day in the open air and the leash of birds you take home,
and your jolly old friendly shooting boots and the grand
glowing tired feeling after dinner. However, as I say, we
won't talk of the humanitarian aspect or the compensations
that can be set against it. We will talk of ordinary shoot-
ing and assume it to be all right. And that 's exactly
where the trouble is: my shooting is now so very ordinary,
and the missing of a bird stirs me to such gloomy fits of
ill-temper that even the Irish stew or the pigeon-pie at
luncheon cannot console me. Still, there it is: I'm going
to shoot on Tuesday; I accepted the invitation with en-
thusiasm, and now, although the cold fit is on me, I've got
to make the best of it.
It's a curious thing how little one can judge a man's
shooting capacity from his externals—until he begins to
shoot. There's a man I know who has large dreamy eyes
and haggard lines in his cheeks and forehead. His hair
is long and untidy and his moustache straggles, and he
generally wears a sage-green tie in a flannel collar without
a gold safety-pin. Everybody would put him down as a
poet or some rubbish of that sort, but everybody would be
wrong, because he's in a London Bank, and he's quite
incapable of missing any bird that comes within range of
his gun. I know another man who looks as sturdy and
strong as a hippopotamus. His face is red and his cropped
whiskers are also red, and his manner is the bluffest thing
I ever came across, and when he shakes you by the hand
he makes your bones crack. He's got an old retriever dog,
too, whom he controls by nicking the nail of his thumb
against that of his middle finger, and he can load his own
cartridges. A sportsman, you say at once, and a dead shot.
Not a bit of it. He can't hit a haystack. I can honestly
say that, bad as I am, I'm better than this barbarian fraud,

misses as other men when they hit.

DID BARNES WRITE BARRIE'S
PLAYS?
A WELL-KEPT secret has at length
been divulged by the dramatic critic
of The Westminster Gazette in his
reference last week in that paper to
“Mr. BARNES's delightful comedy ‘Rosa-
lind.'” It is many years now since
Mr. BARNES, disguising his identity
under the pseudonym, “J. M. BARRIE,'
began to charm theatre-goers by his
whimsical and artistic plays, and it is
a question whether his admirers at this
late date will consent to recognise him
by his real name.
How Mr. BARNES came to adopt the
name of “J. M. BARRIE" is not certain;
one theory is that in his boyhood he
knew a youth of that name, hailing
from Kirriemuir, N.B., and that a
friendly exchange of names was made
between them.
Certain enthusiasts are declining to
admit that Mr. BARNES is identical
with Mr. BARRIE himself, and a BARNES-
BARRIE controversy is beginning to rage.
“Did BARNES write BARRIE's plays ?”
is the question that is troubling the
minds of some, while an equal number
of minds are wrestling with the problem,

“Is BARNIE the author of Barnes's
plays ?”
A well-known baronet has given up
all his engagements in order to devote
his whole attention to the important
subject. He has spent the last two

J. M. BARRIE is supposed to have lived.

admit that Mr. BARNEs is identical
with Mr. BARRIE himself, and a BARNEs-
BARRIE controversy is beginning to rage.
“Did BARNEs write BARRIE’s plays?”
is the question that is troubling the
minds of some, while an equal number
of minds are wrestling with the problem,
“Is BARRIE the author of BARNES's
plays?”
A well-known baronet has given up
all his engagements in order to devote
his whole attention to the important
subject. He has spent the last two
days in Kirriemuir, where the real
J. M. BARRIE is supposed to have lived.
“Remember JAMIE BARRIE2” exclaimed
an old lady in a mutch with whom the
Baronet conversed. “Ay, I remember
the wee birkie, sittin' in his little
blacks in the kirk, drinkin' in the meat
of the meenister's discoorse. And is it
likely that a bairn wi' sic upbringings
wad gi'e himsel’ to play-actin’ and the
like? Ay, I knew the bairn; he was
a sicht too clever to be wastin' his time
writin' books, and when Mistress Mac-
pherson read me a bit of A Window
in Thrums, 't was ca'ed, I said to her
‘Losh, wumman, oor Jamie never
wrote sic or'nery rubbish; ye’ve been
deceiv't.” Largely owing to this con-
versation, the baronet is preparing a
pamphlet to be entitled “BARNEs is
BARRIE,” and to be published at 12s. 6d.
Much indignation has been caused in
Kirriemuir by the arrival of a foreigner,
declaring himself to be a Professor,
who intends to drag the Kirrie river in
the hope that something may be found
not later than Friday next to establish
his theory of the correct solution of the
problem. At the time of going to
press nothing had been discovered.

THE PRIWILEGE OF EMINENGE.
THE agents of a lady well known in
the musical world recently communi-
cated to the Press her experiences with
a “musical marauder” as a warning to
other stars of the musical firmament,
adding the following admirable post-
cript: “It has just occurred to us that
these incidents might conceivably be
construed as an ‘advertising paragraph.'
We assure you that such is not the
case. Madame is too well known
to adopt such means.” -
We have already received several
similar notifications, from which we
select the following:—
Elaine Runnymede, the famous child
pianist, whom the GERMAN EMPEROR
wittily called the Patti of the keyboard,
has lately had a curious--—
experience. While shel

links at North Berwick, +

identity Miss Runny-
mede at once ex-
made its way into the stables and was
only dislodged by the united efforts of
all Sir Herbert's four footmen, whose
appearance after the struggle (as they
were in livery and powder at the time)
was most distressingly dishevelled. As
the orang-utan escaped and has not yet
been captured, Messrs. Pougher and
Blower have thought it desirable to
send these facts to the papers by way
of warning to other members of the aris-
tocracy who live in the neighbourhood,
and may not be so well equipped with
male retainers in case of a visit from
the unwelcome intruder. The sugges-
tion which may conceivably be enter-

humane warning is dictated by a craving

Leiermann cannot too emphatically

behalf of artists less richly endowed

that Sir Pompey is going on well, and
was able to eat a poached egg yesterday.
A STORM IN A PIGSTY.
THE strictures of the Archbishop of
York on contemporary fiction, which
he described as “hot, panting and
blear-eyed,” have caused tremendous
excitement in literary and publishing
circles, and already Dr. LANG has been
obliged to secure police protection
against several in-
furiated fictionists who
have vowed to stab him
to death with their

Mr. Offley Garbidge,
the famous psycho-
logical romancer,
writes: “Dr. LANG's

cessation of the pain, and an invitation
to tea with the Grand Duchess soon
restored her to her normal virtuosity.
Concert-Direction Nathaniel Meyerbeer
(sole agents for Miss Elaine Runny-
mede) are aware that this information
might possibly be misconstrued as a
piece of réclame. There is not the
slightest ground for so ignoble a sus-
picion. Miss Elaine Runnymede, who
has been kissed by four Emperors, is
the last person in the world to en-
deavour to make any capital out of
her casual acquaintance with a mere
Grand Duke.
A regrettable incident (we are in-
formed by Messrs. Pougher and Blower,
the well-known dramatic agents) re-
cently occurred at Marienbad Hall,
Windsor, the country residence of Sir
Herbert Samson, the famous tragedian.
While Sir Herbert and Lady Samson
were entertaining a number of their
friends at tea, an orang-utan which had
as Messrs. Pougher and Blower happily
put it.
Mr. Hans Bamberger, while recently
returning from the country seat of his
father-in-law, Sir Pompey Boldero,
F.R.G.S., in his motor car, stopped at
Metheglin Castle to lunch with the
Duke of Wiltshire. The party included
one Prince of the Blood, two belted
Earls, and several Bishops. Shortly
after leaving the Castle, at about
3.45 P.M., Mr. Bamberger was held up
by an armed footpad who threatened to
shoot Sir Pompey unless Mr. Bam-
berger at once handed over £1,000.
Fortunately, Mr. Bamberger happened
to have the money with him, and a
terrible tragedy was thus averted. But
the man is still at large, and Mr.
Bamberger has authorised his agents,
Concert-Direction Leiermann, to issue
a warning to his brother artists to be
prepared for similar extortions. The
robber was a tall man with piercing
great public which reads
my books by the million, and at the
critics who have compared me favour-
ably with BALzAc, FLAUBERT and
DE MAUPAssant. -
Messrs. Broader and Blewer, on being
interviewed by our representative,
expressed great indignation at the obser-
vations of the Archbishop. “What,”
they asked, “does this obscurantist
prelate want? Does he think that an
enlightened democracy will rest content
with such mawkish fictional pabulum
as that provided by the Early-Victorian
Sentimentalists? Let the preacher
stick to his pulpit. The business of the
conscientious novelist is to explore the
drains and dustbins of humanity in the
best interests of moral hygiene.”

feminist writer, says: “These archi-

BEING SEHOWN AT THE CINEMAS 2 ''
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I REMEMBER meeting some chapters of The Joyous Adven-
tures of Aristide Pujol (John LANE) in the pages of a
popular magazine, and the pleasant impression they then
left has only been increased by re-reading them in this
collected form. Mr. W. J. Locke has shown himself equal
to the rather difficult task of creating a consistent
character in a number of short stories. Aristide indeed is
a worthy companion to any in the author's gallery, and his
adventures, joyous to the verge of improbability and a little
beyond, are always the greatest fun in the world. See him
outwitting a rogue of a picture-dealer, smoothing the course
of true love, and incidentally putting five hundred pounds
in his own pocket, all by one amazing stroke of impudence.
That is “The Adventure of Kind Mr. Smith.” Elsewhere
we find him adopting (for a space) a foundling, reconciling
husband and wife, and even—once only—himself the victim
of swindlers. And throughout he is the same merry, kind-
hearted and wholly mercurial soldier of fortune whom (I
think) Mr. Locke specially delights to draw, and (I am
quite sure) the circulating libraries will take to welcoming
arms. Only in the last adventure, where Aristide is caught
in the toils of a rather unreal domesticity, did my faith in
him waver ever so slightly. Married existence in the
English suburbs—no, Mr. LockB, I cannot think you
meant me to believe this! Magazine readers have no
doubt their demands, but I for one shall not sacrifice to
them the reality of such a beloved vagabond.
I have just been having the most delightful visit to
America in the company of Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT. The
Second Suburban Nut. “ANd Dog-FIGHTS 1 '' -
Third Suburban Nut. “AND PRIZE-FIGHTs WHY, DASH IT, IT's ENough To DRIVE on E INTO THE TERRITORIALs.”
Those United States (MARTIN SECKER), and, in simple
honesty, I never yet met any collection of printed pages |
that conveyed so vivid an impression of actuality. Nobody,
I suppose, needs to be told at this period of time that Mr.
ARNoLD BENNETT is gifted with an eye for the effective
detail. Two continents are enriching him for it at this
very moment. Naturally therefore this makes him the very
man for a transcriber of the emotions produced by strange
places and people. I have never personally seen the United
States, but this book has for the first time made me waver
in the hitherto fixed determination that I never will.
Perhaps this is because wherever he goes, on great liners,
in trains, and hotels and institutions, the author fastens
unerringly upon the human interest of the scene; and
human interest is a wonderfully reassuring thing. It can
even rob of its terror such a spectacle as the interior of the
chief telephone exchange in New York or the palace of an |
insurance king. I wish I could quote to you some passages
in the book, but that is not possible. Moreover, the fascina-
tion of it is cumulative; once begun it holds you like a
romance, even like one by the same author. The chapter
on a journey by the New-York-to-Chicago train is in especial
an epic of modern travel. On the whole, I came away
from my visit with a firmer conviction than ever that, if
Those United States are a wonder, this Mr. ARNOLD
BENNETT is very certainly another.
My Love and I, says in effect an intriguing announce-
ment of the English publishers (CoNSTABLE), is the work
of a well-known (American) novelist, who prefers to adopt,
because of his autobiographical references, the pseudonym of
“MARTIN REDFIELD.” The author indulges himself in some
rather flamboyant diction, as when, in describing a young

vehicle in which the trip was made was a volume called

“really happy in that she carried a bandbox and was so
fain of it that she had to open it in the hall and show me
her fruit, plucked from the tree of life.” Accepting or dis-
counting this imaginative idiosyncrasy of style, which tends
to mask a real sincerity and thoughtfulness, one can enjoy
a quietly interesting story, carefully planned and told.
Martin, making an early literary success, marries a woman
whose coldness, shallowness, suburban outlook and petty
avarice are hidden from her adorer by her beguiling beauty.
He later finds his real affinity in Ellen Tracy—meets her
in an enchanted garden, a sentimental variant of the
rendezvous in The Brushwood Boy—but under the in-
spiration of her generous demand that he should be
“splendid" cleaves honourably to his wife and little son,
checkmating the imperturable, crass constancy of rich,
owlish Cousin Tom, a would-be lover. The beauty, distinc-
tion, and courage of Ellen are well expressed. And there is
another charming character, a pattern of patient unselfish-
ness, Mary Owen, with which the author makes amends for
any eccentricities of style (it was Mary who was carrying
problem of the Golf Caddie.” Those who are interested in
the solution of the difficulties of “blind alley” occupations
will welcome this very sound and honest piece of work.
It gives statistics, drawn from a large number of repre-
sentative clubs in the neighbourhood of London, of the
rates of caddies' payments, their hours of employment, their
ages and the conditions under which they work. It records
the efforts already made by a few golf-clubs to improve
these conditions and to find employment and instruction
for caddies in their long waiting hours. It shows that the
very circumstance of enforced idleness, which is apt to
demoralise the caddie and unfit him for subsequent employ-
ment at home or in the colonies, offers opportunities for
training and education which are denied to most boys of
his class engaged in other fields of labour; and it modestly
offers suggestions as to the best means of utilising these
opportunities. The relations between caddie and player
should be something closer and more personal than those
that are commonly recognised between employer and em-
ployed; and no one can read this little book, so happily
the bandbox). There is
throughout a strange
striving after the ex-
pression of the tragedies
and glories of literary
endeavour that would
be pretentious if it
were not so obviously
sincere.
The underlying theme
of Mr. Richard BAGOT’s
book, Darneley Place
(METH U EN), is the
theory that a person
may be unconsciously
influenced in his ac-
tions by the will of
another not necessarily
alive. I call this a

pose none can take the

fact, except by proxy.
And Mr. BAGoT does not actually do even that. He
sets two very delightful people discussing it, one from
the religious standpoint, the other from the scientific,
and they are mutually convinced to the extent of
not being able to find any other explanation of what
happens. The first is Cardinal Lelli, a shrewd, kindly
adviser of all who bring him their troubles. The other is
Professor Rossario, who mingles his penetrating arguments
and his conversation generally with good - humoured
sarcasms, unless he chances to be correcting proofs, when
he sends everybody, from the Princess, his daughter-in-law,
downwards, to the devil. Various complications are
worked out by a number of very lovable people who live
and love in very lovable places—chiefly in Italy—with the
sinister shadow of a Sicilian vendetta in the background.
The young couple are eventually brought together by In-
fluences (with a capital letter, since there is something
occult about them) which But I have already tackled
the influence question. Mr. BAGoT gives such generous
measure—there is quantity as well as quality—that I can
tell no more of the tale than that. And sample threads do
not give much of an idea of the pattern. It is too well woven.
I commend The Rough and the Fairway (HEINEMANN) to
bright blue and jabbing
at him with a six-foot spear. An awkward situation
for Marcus. However, he had murdered her fiancé, so
perhaps, pity is wasted on him. Eventually he got it
—literally—in the neck, and Boudicca, with the satisfy-
ing feeling that her duty had been done, married her
second-in-command, Alawn, and went off to live happily in
the forest. That is the main theme of the spirited narrative
which in his novel Boudicca (OUSELEY) Mr. C. H. DUDLEY
WARD has woven round the picturesque personality of the
“British warrior queen’’ (for Boudicca, despite the spelling,
is none other than Mr. Gandish's Boadishia). It is a story
full of thrilling movement, and—to me at least—atmo-
spherically convincing. I know a great deal now about the
manners and customs of the ancient Britons, and it is
extremely interesting to note how some of the quaint old
practices survive to this day. “When you have lived in
this country a bit longer, Geminius, you will be amazed at
some of their customs. He . . . had a passion for
borrowing money. He wished to borrow from me, and
repay in the next world.” Not fifty yards from Bouverie
Street have I met again and again the descendants of this
rugged old ear-biter whose very name is lost in the mists
of the past. The formula, it is true, is now “till Saturday,”

that I could just manage a useful and reliable car, complete

It is just as well that I went to the Show, because
previously my ideas about accessories were all wrong. Just
lamps and a horn, I thought . . . And these, according to
the advertisement, were included in the £200.
But there is a little fat policeman, it seems, who stands
on the radiator cap and waves his arms. He, I realise
now, is essential.
And an electric horn. I am filled with contempt for the
squash-buffb horn. The very name gives it away. Squash-

the same gentleman pronounce it at the Show that I did.

too late. -
And another electrical arrangement which warms the
steering wheel and the foot-mats, illuminates the clock,

WHAT WE MISSED AT OLYMPIA.
THE UMBRELLA TREE.
An exercise in the facile manner of one
of the “Best Sellers” of the day.
[With acknowledgments to the Author of
The Upas Tree and The Rosary.]
PART I.
THE sun was streaming through the
“Glacier” panes of the old Tudor
grange. It fell on the boyish curls of
the famous novelist, Donald East; it
fell on the regal form of his beloved
Ellen, the wealthy heiress in whose hall
he had hung up his hat; it illuminated
the old motto which some idle visitor
had scratched on the “ Glacier'': Ad
hoc.
“I often wonder what that means,
Donnie,” said Ellen, as she took off her
spurs, for they had been rabbit hunting.
“My darling,” said Donald, his
boyish face all aglow, “like a breakfast
sausage, Greek is a great mystery.”
Ellen was silent. There were times
when Donald's merry humour got on
even her well-ordered nerves.
“Darling,” he continued, “I want to

to lay the scene of my new novel
there.”
“Very well,” she said, suppressing a
sigh, “I’ll write the usual cheque.
And on your way back I wish you'd
look in at Bayreuth and get me a
German flute.”
“I will, darling,” said Donald, “if you
will give me the money for that, too.”
“But be sure of one thing,” said the
beautiful Ellen, as she signed another
cheque, “do not go near my cousin, Sir
Rupert Malatesta, who has made Bay-
reuth his home. For he is both bold
and bad. He wears evening dress in
the morning.”
PART II.
It was six months later. Donald
was seated in an arm-chair in the room
of Sir Rupert Malatesta, at Bayreuth.
“Ha, ha! So I have you in my
power,” hissed Sir Rupert, removing
his cigarette in order to bring his teeth
close together.
But Donald did not hear, for he was
in a high fever; he was also too much
engrossed in playing with his wife's
cheque-book, which he called “Baby
“Here is a letter from Ellen for her
miserable nincompoop,” Sir Rupert
went on, lighting another cigarette.
“It says that you are a father. But
shall I give it to you? Never. Malapert
that you are Did I not love her first 2
No, I will increase the fever which you
caught in Portuguese West Africa, and
send you home to die. Ha, ha-to die!"
Again Donald did not hear, so wrapt
was he in “Baby Balance.”
“You clown,” cried Sir Rupert, “I
mean to kiss Ellen again.”
PART III.
Two days later Donald East reached
Liverpool Street Station, where all the
porters knew him by name.
“Have you come from the Hook, Mr.
East 2" asked the obsequious inspector.
“Yes,” said Donald; “did you think
I had come from the Eye?”
It was such humour as this that
helped his amazing popularity, but the
inspector knew in a moment that he
was suffering from Portuguese West
African fever.
Donald rushed through London in a

MORE SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
(As revealed in the Magazines.)
I.—THE HEIR.
MR. TREvor PILKINGTON, of the well-
known firm of Trevor Pilkington, fixed
his horn spectacles carefully upon his
nose, took a pinch of snuff, sneezed
twice, gave his papers a preliminary
rustle, looked slowly round the crowded
room, and began to read the will.
Through forty years of will-reading
his method of procedure had always
been the same. But Jack Summers,
who was sharing an ottoman with two
of the outdoor servants, thought that
Mr. Pilkington's mannerisms were de-
signed specially to annoy him, and he
could scarcely control his impatience.
Yet no one ever had less to hope
from the reading of a will than Jack.
For the first twenty years of his life his
parents had brought him up to believe
that his cousin Cecil was heir to his
Uncle Alfred's enormous fortune, and
for the subsequent ten years his cousin
Cecil had brought his Uncle Alfred up
in the same belief. Indeed Cecil had
even roughed out one or two wills for
signature, and had offered to help his
uncle—who, however, preferred to do
these things by himself—to hold the
pen. Jack could not help feeling glad
that his cousin was not there to parade
his approaching triumph; a nasty cold,
caught a week previously in attending
his uncle to the Lord Mayor's Show,
having kept Cecil in bed.
“To the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, ten shillings and
sixpence"—the words came to him in a
meaningless drone—“to the Fresh Air
Fund, ten shillings and sixpence; to
the King Edward Hospital Fund, ten
shillings and sixpence"—was all the
money going in charities?—“to my
nephew Cecil Linley, who has taken
such care of me”—Mr. Pilkington hesi-
tated—“four shillings and ninepence;
to my nephew, John Summers, whom,
thank Heaven, I have never seen, five
million pounds * >
A long whistle of astonishment came
from the ottoman. The solicitor looked
up with a frown.
“It's the surprise,” apologised Jack.
“I hardly expected so much. I thought
that that brute—I mean I thought my
cousin Cecil had nobbled—that is to
say, was getting it all.” -
“The late Mr. Alfred Linley made
three wills,” said the lawyer in a mo-
ment of expansion. “In the first he
left his nephew Cecil a legacy of one
shilling and tenpence, in the second he
bequeathed him a sum of three shillings
and twopence, and in the last he set
ninepence. The evidence seems to show
that your cousin was rapidly rising in
his uncle's estimation. You, on the
other hand, have always been a legatee
to the amount of five million pounds;
but in the last will there is a trifling
condition attached.” He resumed his
papers. “To my nephew, John Sum-
mers, five million pounds, on condition
that, within one year from the date of
my death, he marries Mary Huggins,
the daughter of my old friend, now
deceased, William Huggins.”
Jack Summers rose proudly from his
end of the ottoman.
“Thanks,” he said curtly. “That
tears it. It's very kind of the old
gentleman, but I prefer to choose a
wife for myself.” He bowed to the
company and strode from the room.
It was a cloudless August day. In the
shadow of the great elms that fringed
the Sussex lane a girl sat musing;
on its side in the grass at her feet a
bicycle, its back wheel deflated. She
sat on the grassy bank with her hat
in her lap, quite content to wait until
the first passer-by with a repairing
outfit in his pocket should offer to help
her.
“Can I be of any assistance?” said
a manly voice, suddenly waking her
from her reverie.
She turned with a start. The owner
of the voice was dressed in a stylish
knickerbocker suit; his eyes were blue,
his face was tanned, his hair was curly
and he was at least six foot tall. So
much she noticed at a glance.
“My bicycle,” she said; “punctured.”
In a minute he was on his knees
beside the machine. A rapid examina-
tion convinced him that she had not
over-stated the truth, and he whipped
from his pocket the repairing outfit
without which he never travelled.
“I can do it in a moment,” he said.
“At least, if you can just help me a
little.”
As she knelt beside him he could not
fail to be aware of her wonderful
beauty. The repairs, somehow, took
longer than he thought. Their heads
were very close together all the time,
and indeed on one occasion came
violently into contact.
“There,” he said at last, getting up
and barking his shin against the pedal.
“Conf That will be all right.”
“Thank you,” she said tenderly.
He looked at her without disguising
his admiration; a tall, straight figure
in the sunlight, his right shin rubbing
itself vigorously against his left calf.
“It's absurd,” he said at last : “I
feel as if I've known you for years.
And anyway I'm certain I've seen you
“Did you ever go to ‘The Seaside
Girl'?” she asked eagerly.
“Often.”
“Do you remember the Spanish
princess who came on at the beginning
of the Second Act and said, ‘Wow-
wow !' to the Mayor?"
“Why, of course! And you had your
photograph in The Sketch, The Tatler,
The Bystander, and The Sporting and
Dramatic all in the same week 2 ”
The girl nodded happily. “Yes, I'm
Marie Huguenot l” she said.
“And I'm Jack Summers; so now
we know each other.” He took her
hand. “Marie,” he said, “ever since
I have mended your bicycle—I mean,
ever since I have known you I have
loved you. Will you marry me?”
“Jack 1" she cooed. “You did say
‘Jack,' didn't you?”
“Bless you, Marie. We shall be
very poor, dear. Will you mind?”
“Not with you, Jack. At least, not if
you mean what I mean by ‘very poor.’”
“Two thousand a year.”
“Yes, that 's about what I meant.”
Jack took her in his arms.
“And Mary Huggins can go and
marry the Pope,” he said with a smile.
With a look of alarm in her eyes she
pushed him suddenly away from her.
There was a crash as his foot went
through the front wheel of the bicycle.
“Mary Huggins?” she cried.
“Yes, I was left a fortune on condi-
tion that I married a person called Mary
Huggins. Absurd . As though * >
“How much 2"
“Oh, quite a lot if it wasn't for these
confounded death duties. Five million
pounds. You see—”
“Jack, Jack 1" cried the girl. “Don’t
you understand? I am Mary Huggins.”
He looked at her in amazement.
“You said your name was Marie
Huguenot,” he said slowly.
“My stage name, dear. Naturally
I couldn't—I mean, one must—you
know how particular managers are.
When father died and I had to go on
the stage for a living—”
“Marie, my darling!”
Mary rose and picked up her bicycle.
The air had gone out of the back-wheel
again, and there were four spokes
broken, but she did not heed it.
“You must write to your lawyer
to-night,” she said. “Won't he be
surprised?"
But, being a great reader of the
magazines, he wasn't. A. A. M.

AND AFTER $–WHAT THEN ?
(Being Our Own Contribution to the
Symposium of Intelligent Forecasts.)
WE are enabled to give to-day (most
fortunately and to the intense relief of
our readers) a complete and detailed
survey of the present position in
European politics, resulting from the
sudden and surprising events in the
Near East. We have this on the
Highest Authority (Our Own). We can
vouch for every one of the new facts here
disclosed. The first point that we wish
to make is that the Powers—contrary to
common belief—are waiting on events.
In the meantime the one outstanding
hopeful sign is that they remain on
the friendliest terms. Sympathetic
messages of courteous goodwill and
macy are passing daily between them.
While events are moving so rapidly it
would, it is felt, be premature to con-
sider what steps will have to be taken
in eventualities which have not yet
arisen and are not (in the opinion of
some observers) at all likely, in the
immediate future, to arise.
With these few words of introduction
we may at once embark upon a full con-
sideration of the position. We may say
without hesitation that no definite re-
sult to the “conversations” now pro-
ceeding may be looked for at present.
The Powers—to tell the simple truth—
are waiting on events, feeling that it is
better in the interests of the main-
tenance of European peace to allow
circumstances to shape themselves
before dealing in detail with situations
instance, the Turks by a tardy recovery
succeed in rolling back the Balkan
invasion and thus re-creating the status
quo, the whole problem, regarded from
a territorial point of view, would have
to be reconsidered in the light of new
facts. If, on the other hand, the Allies
reach Constantinople, as the final out-
come of the surprising incidents of the
past few weeks, other aspects of the
situation—it is not too much to say—
will be thrust into prominence. Mean-
while in the momentous negotiations
which are daily going forward among
the Powers it would appear that no-
thing is more urgently insisted upon
than the desirability of marking time.
That is a wise and statesmanlike view.
The problems of Salonica, a very ticklish
question, and of Albania, another very
ticklish quest on, are still in the future.
In dealing with the whole question of
Turkish supremacy it must always be
remembered that it is one thing to take
territory from Turkey; it is quite
another thing to be allowed to stick to
it. There need be no confusion there.
Perhaps in conclusion a few words
about the position of some of the
Powers and their individual attitude
will not be out of place. Great Britain,
then, while still acting loyally within
the Concert, and therefore avoiding an
independent line of action, is under-
stood to be pressing for delay. France,
while absolutely maintaining her hearty
co-operation with the other Powers,
and thus avoiding an independent point
of view, is all in favour of deferring
action. Germany, while disparaging
any infringement of the general har-
mony, and thus avoiding an inde-
pendent train of thought, is eagerly
advocating what we may call a policy
of pause.
There we must leave it. The most
hopeful sign at the moment is to be
found in the amicable sentiments with
which the future is awaited.

Ministry, having thus far got through
Committee on Home Rule Bill with
majorities averaging 100, defeated by
majority of 21 in House of 434 Members.
Amazing victory due to strategy com-
monplace in conception but cleverly
worked out. Business on hand was
Report stage of Resolution governing
financial clauses of the Bill. Arranged
that division should be taken somewhere
about seven o'clock. As to result there
was no ground for anxiety on Treasury
Bench. In Committee the Resolution
had been carried by a majority of 121.
This exceeded the generous margin
declared night after night, even went
beyond actual numerical strength of
Ministry.
Why therefore should faithful Minis-
terialists bother? Sick to death with
tiresome iteration of talk avowedly
designed not to amend but to obstruct
the Bill, why should they waste a
precious hour or two of week-end
holiday in order to be in their places?
So they stayed away, some 170 all
told. When they arrived in good

crowd, one-half abashed the other
jubilant, departed.
Surprise admirably manoeuvred. As
soon as question of accepting Com-
mittee's Resolution put from the Chair
BANBURY casually stepped in with
amendment. It did not appear on the
Paper. Was apparently one of those
inspirations that without premeditation
flash on busy brain of City Baronet.
Nothing in appearance of House sug-
gested peril to Bill. As usual, when
Order of Day was calledon—the business
being discussion of revolutionary Bill
striking at heart of Empire—Members
with one accord arose and strolled
forth to Lobby.
BANBURY rattled on unheedful of
familiar aspect of empty Benches. No
one on Ministerial side scented danger.
One significant incident, remembered
after, might have aroused suspicion.
LONSDALE, seconding BANBURY's
amendment, contented himself with
uttering formal sentence. In ordinary
circumstances he would have contri-
buted his full share to speech-making
that would have occupied the sitting
up to stipulated hour when guillotine
came into operation. Further evidence

was supplied by abstention of Unionists
from prolonging debate. MITCHELL-
THoMson said a few words following
PostMASTER-GENERAL's contemptuous
rejection of Amendment. Then un-
wonted silence fell on Benches to
left of SPEARER. Had barest sus-
picion of plot existed in Ministerial
ranks it would have been easy to defeat
it. Needed only to put up succession
of speakers to delay division till the
dallying week-enders arrived in number
sufficient to save situation.
To vary afamiliar tag, Whom the gods
would destroy they first make blind.
Ministerialists saw nothing unusual till
they beheld Clerk at Table, having
compared return of figures brought from
Division Lobby by the Tellers, hand
the paper to the blushing BARONET
BANBURY. It did not need the wild
shout of triumph that went up from
Opposition Benches to tell that the
Government had been defeated.

Resolution of Home Rule Bill carried

accustomed places to announce parti-
culars. Not so the old campaigner.
His usual seat is in comparatively
obscure background of Opposition
Benches above Gangway. His special
mission justified full share of what on
the stage is known as limelight. Ac-
cordingly, by forced march rivalling
that of the Bulgarians on Lule Burgas,
he reached Gangway and took pos-

Delightful to watch and hear the
Colonel make the most of strategical
position thus temporarily annexed. As
matter of fact, presentation of petitions
to House of Commons is the extreme
of futility. They have no more in-
fluence upon debate and decision than
has a feather floating downward from
one of the galleries. They are igno-
miniously thrust into a bag hanging by
the Clerks’ Table and are not further
heard of except in not unfamiliar cases
where discovery is made of batches of
bogus signatures. To the Colonel his
mission was as momentous as if he
were presenting a Budget or intro-
ducing a Reform Bill. As in loud voice
he cited particulars of each petition
committed to his charge, he paused a
moment and looked fixedly at the
SPEAKER as who should say, “What
do you think of that ?”
Case-hardened by long occupancy of
Chair, Mr. LowTHER managed to con-
ceal any emotion that may have welled
in his bosom. Perhaps acute ear
caught something like a gulp in his
voice when, the recitation completed,
he said, “The honourable Member will
please bring the petitions up to the
Table.” -
As for the Colonel, his mission ac-
complished, he marched with soldierly
tread to the Table, dropped his rolls of
paper into the unsympathetic bag, and
retreated to his accustomed seat on
back bench.
Business done.—Home Rule Bill
temporarily shelved. Criminal Amend-
ment Bill takes a turn.
Wednesday.—Opened quietly enough.
PREMIER moved Resolution rescinding
Vote of Monday night. BonneR LAw
in vigorous speech denounced procedure
as dishonourable, cowardly, tyrannical,
revolutionary and destructive of Parlia-
mentary customs established and main-
being defeated on what was admittedly
a vital question, straightforward course
was to resign.
This view of situation approved
with thunderous cheers by Opposition.
PRINCE ARTHUR listened with far-away
look. Situation a little awkward for
him. As PREMIER reminded House,
seven years ago PRINCE ARTHUR, then
head of the Government, had refused to
resign when beaten in the division lobby,
the very course now exciting the
righteous indignation of his Party.
Asquith mainly justified his action b
citation from PRINCE ARTHUR's speech
in 1905. If mud were thrown at the
Colonel YATE has a mission.
erring Minister to-day, some flakes must
stick to his predecessor of 1905.
Some of his old supporters must have
remembered this and regretted the per-
sonal pain inflicted on sensitive nature.
To do them justice, the main body were
able to ignore disagreeable facts. They
were out to harry AsquitH, and
they did it with a will. It was BULL
who applied the match to the con-
veniently handy train of gunpowder.
Summing up the indictment against
PREMIER he bellowed, “He’s a traitor l’”
SPEAKER insisted on withdrawal of
unparliamentary phrase. He declined.
Taking BULL by the horns, so to
speak, SPEAKER commanded him to
withdraw, which he did, cheered on his
way to door by Opposition now blazing
with excitement.
Shortly after, Attorney-GENERAL
appeared at Table with intent to
reply upon debate; met by persistent
cries for adjournment. After vainly
suspended Sitting for an hour. Mem-
bers returning, refreshed by hasty
meal, more than ever resolved to pre-
vent discussion of PREMIER's motion,
shouted ATToRNEY-GENERAL down.
SPEAKER recognising impossibility of
restraining disorder, adjourned the
Sitting till to-morrow. Opposition went
off triumphant. As they filed out
pelted Ministers with missiles impro-
vised out of stray copies of Orders of
the Day.
Business done.—None.
Thursday.—When Questions were
called on, the House presented appear-
ance rarely witnessed. With Home
Rule Bill in Committee average
attendance through a Sitting seldom
exceeds four-score. This afternoon the
throng, including Strangers, probably
mustered 600. Every seat on floor of
House was appropriated; side galleries
on both sides packed; a crowd elbowed
each other at the Bar; Gangway
steps and steps of SPEAKER's Chair
eagerly competed for as coigns of
vantage; Peers struggled for places in
their Gallery with the ruthlessness of
ordinary mortals; Strangers' Gallery
peopled to topmost range of benches.
Little attention paid to Questions
which ran their ordinary course; replies
occasionally inaudible amid rise and
fall of conversation. Excitement deep-
ened when hand of clock pointed to
third quarter of the hour, signal for
taking in hand business of the day.
This set forth in notice on paper of
PREMIER's intention to move that the
House forthwith resume discussion of
the Resolution rescinding hostile vote
on clause of Home Rule Bill.
What would happen when PREMIER
stood at the Table 2 Ministerialists
regarded with concern the serried ranks
opposite which yesterday shouted down
Attorney - GENERAL and compelled
adjournment.
What actually happened was the un-
expected, a not unfamiliar occurrence
in House of Commons. SPEAKER rose
presumably to call on PREMIER to move
his Resolution. This would no doubt
be signal for repetition of yester-
day's clamour. But the SPEAKER had
another task in hand. Assuming that |.
no party or section desired to witness
renewal of yesterday's lamentable riot,
he suggested that, with opportunity for
reflection and consultation, another
method of procedure might be devised

PREMIER, briefly accepting sugges-
tion, moved adjournment till Monday.
BonneR approved, and before the vast
assembly quite realised what had hap-
pened it was dispersing.

LIVE AND LET DYE.
STANDING in the early morning sun
at my mirror a few weeks ago, I was
running my fingers through my hair,
vaguely conscious that I had seen my
face somewhere before, when my atten-
tion was suddenly arrested by a sinister
streak in the general ebony. Hitherto,
by retracing my movements on the pre-
vious evening and aided by the distinc-
tive characteristics of colour and length
common to hairs, I had been able to
clear up satisfactorily any misgivings I
may have entertained upon the matter.
But the previous evening I had stayed
at home; the evening before that I had
opened an important debate in our local
parliament; and the plot thickened as
I remembered that on the evening before
I was sitting with my family, quietly
talking of politics, when the truth came
home to me. Every detail of that
scene is indelibly burnt on my brain.
I remember the puppy was stretched
full length on the hearth-rug, and on
his whiskers a fragment of paper
which he had been chewing when
sleep overtook him, and I wondered
whether the Lake of Geneva is really
as deep as they say it is. And then I
knew. To all outward appearance I
am still in the heyday of youth. If
you were to meet me in the street, you
would turn round and say, “There
goes a man with youth in its glorious
flower and with hope his handmaiden!”
But, in my heart, I know I am growing
older, running rapidly to seed. Already
thirty-one per cent. of my life is flown.
any more of my exploits in the fields
of heroism and romance would scarcely
be fair to my biographer. You will
read about it all in due time.
To proceed: love shall fly past me
to his hangar with a rush of gilded
wings, as Anacreon has it, for the
thread that bound him is no longer
young and glossy and black. Fare-
well, Josephine ! Farewell, thou best
and fairest of women, second only to I
forget how many just now, who sittest
in thy bower overlooking the Park, yet
sittest in vain, for it shall never be said
thou hast married a greybeard. But
thou art yet young (comparatively, that
is), and very soon someone will come
along who is worthy to fill my place—
no, not so very soon, but still in time.
In the old days we have been very
that again I had been at
the club, because that was
the evening I lost my last
sixpence at snooker, and
had to walk home. That
takes us back to Tuesday.
On Monday—now what did
we do on Monday ? P.
haps, after all, we need not
pry into that; it will suffice
to say that by a careful
process of exclusion I was
forced to admit that the
hair was my own, and—yes,
you have guessed the rest.
At first (that was in the
early days, understand, be-
fore I had begun to suspect
the worst), I put it down
to having eaten something
that had disagreed with me;
or possibly to the autumnal
frosts, which had already
acquired a nasty nip in the
early mornings. So far all

But the deed I am about to
commit will sever us for

boy I had bribed with a bag
of Barcelonas to walk in

the pavement the empty
shells she so delighted to
crack under those dainty
feet of hers. But there !
And now, dear friends,
farewell! It is my simple
wish that you go on en-

nothing had happened.

Whose bright intellect was
it that suggested to you the
value of a strong right arm
was plain sailing, but the question was,
what was to be done? I decided to conceal
it, for the moment, behind a couple of
black ones that happened to be near, and
trust to a little more care on my part in
the matter of diet and warmer under-
clothing, for soon restoring it to its
natural colour. A week later the in-
fection had spread to another; and
where, but a fortnight ago, all was as
black as my hat, the number of grey
hairs had risen to two, though, happily,
still in a minority. But, the iron having
once entered into their souls, they sank
into a decline, from which they never
rallied, and four days after the poor
fellows were dead. I pulled them out
tenderly and put them into the fire. This,
I learned subsequently, was the very
worst thing I could possibly have done.
And thenceforward I had no peace.
Each morning that I went to my mirror
there was so much weeding to do that
Next year it will be thirty-two, and so
on, adding one for each year till you
come to a hundred. But something
tells me I shall never live to a hundred.
Perhaps, if I were a life-tenant, an
annuitant, or anything of that sort, I
might, with the prayers of others,
struggle on into the nineties; but,
lacking encouragement, I have none of
that obstinate vitality. Good-bye, then,
to physical perfection, good-bye to
strength, good-bye to beauty, though
the wrench in this case is not quite so
hard ' Looking back on my life, I am
at least thankful that there have been
passages in it that I am not altogether
ashamed of, e.g., when at great personal
risk I rushed up and prevented a horse
from running away, for which I was
resented with an illuminated address

about a mowing machine; and on Fri-

“SoME GRIEFs ARE MED'cINABLE.”—Cymbeline, Act III., Scene 2.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is a rare bookish fragrance that exudes from the leaves
of Mr. GossE's Portraits and Sketches (HEINEMANN). There
are portraits of such men of substance as Swinburn E,
AUBREY DE WERE and MANDELL CREIGHToN, and sketches of
such literary ghosts as “ORION” HoRNE, “FESTUs" BAILEY
and “INGLESANT" SHoRTHouse. The Sw1NBURNE memories
are delightful and affectionate: in particular of that all but
fatal episode at Etretat, when the little poet and foolhardy
swimmer was carried out by the tide, rescued—a most
casual stroke of chance—by Captain WALLIN of the Marie
Marthe, and wrapped in a spare sail, whereout he preached
to crew and captain of the splendours of Republicanism
and spouted Victor Hugo to them. The mad Englishman
And one likes the lady who played “Three Blind Mice" to
him, representing it as a just-discovered, very ancient
Florentine ritornello. Swin BURNE, enchanted, “found that
it reflected the cruel beauty of the Medicis.” It is also
pleasant to hear of the recurring comedy of the poet sitting
about with his latest manuscript obtruding from his breast-
pocket, obviously waiting to be invited to read it and
habitually replying when so invited, “I had no intention
in the world of boring you with it, but since you ask me * >
The whole book is an occasion of intercourse with that
type, none too frequent in an age of hasty writing and
overprinting, the authentic, leisurely “man of letters.”
As the laurels wither on the temples of the epistolary muse
we look more and more for the merely human and personal
interest in the correspondence of the great as they pass away
from us. GEORGE MEREDITH lived on to a time when even
in country villages you may see men hastening to catch the
and prodigal was his genius that it may well be doubted
whether the readers of these Letters (collected by his son and
published by CoNSTABLE) will find much cause for regret in
the fact that many of them were evidently penned with haste.
For if he wishes to look at a finished fabric of the master-
weaver, he has only, after all, to turn to the romances upon
his bookshelves; and even in these stray fragments and
patches that were lavished upon particular friends there is
much to remind him pleasantly of the manner of those
classics. In letters to WILLIAM HERDMAN, to Lord MoRLEY,
to Admiral MAxse, to Mr. FREDERICK GREEN wood, to Mrs.
JANET Ross, one may seize MEREDITH at his jolliest, at his
most nonsensical, or, again, in his acutest, his deepest, his
most intricate moods; one may pass from the flamboyant
flippancies which he showers on his “Friar Tuck” to the
wonderfully beautiful words in which he writes of the death
of his wife. There are letters too, of course, of peculiar
literary and political interest—it is impossible to refrain
from mentioning one addressed to M. ANDRE RAFFALovich,
containing a marvellous appreciation of CARLYLE. But
whilst many are naturally written to the editor of this
book there are all too few which contain references to
those other children of his—Harry Richmond, Evan
Harrington, and the rest. MEREDITH seems to have
worried far less than R. L. STEvenson about his characters,
though there is one letter written to this other maker of
tales in which a confidence is breathed on the subject of
Diana of the Crossways. On the whole, so eminent are
the recipients of these missives that I have a fancy picture
of the superior mien, the arrogant intellectual airs, of that
Dorking postman whose privileged duties embraced the
collection of the correspondence dated from Box Hill Cottage.
It does not often fall to the lot of Junior Counsel, as now,

than in camerd. It is therefore with some personal satis-
faction that I reprimand His Honour JUDGE E. A. PARRY
for a split infinitive on page 304 of his What the Judge Saw
(SMITH, ELDER). For the rest, though I am tempted to give
it His Honour hot, just for the fun of the thing, honesty
forces me to confess that I derived infinite entertainment
and some profit from his eloquent and breezy work. His
pages are full of delightful anecdotes, very few of which are
familiar, and there is a sequence in the whole which makes
for the most comfortable reading and enables one to form
a vivid impression of the life and career of a successful
lawyer, things by no means devoid of excitement and romance.
His Honour complains of the unblushing sycophancy usual
in the demeanour of the Bar to the Bench. To give him
what he asks for, I note a naïve egoism and self-satisſac-
tion in his opinions, especially when they refer to himself.
The Bench, in his opinic.n, was not faultless while he was
at the Bar; the Bar is not faultless now that he is on the
Bench. Again, when he leaves the judiciary and speaks
from the point of view of a legislator, his proposed reforms
are, to my thinking, nonsense; except when they are deliber-
ately nonsensical and then there is something in them. skill and sympathy.
Which said, it must be

companied the advice with an immense pirouette and pro-
digious grin of his own, such as few people could perform
after dinner without being sick, ending on one foot and
t'other in the air.” I have only to add that the book is
crammed with amusement, not forced, as is often the case,
but woven into the very texture of the letters.
I have to confess to a perhaps churlish dislike and
suspicion of the practice of puffs preliminary as printed by
publishers upon the covers of books submitted to my critical
notice. To be told that a novel was written to amuse a
friend, “without thought of public or publisher,” or found
in a cloak-room, or fished out of the Thames, is invariably,
so far as I am concerned, to be prejudiced against its
contents. That is one reason why Windyridge (JENKINs)
failed to satisfy me. I admit willingly that Mr. W. RILEY's

in-waiting to QUEEN VICTORIA in 1838, and in 1842 was made
governess of the royal children, a post which she retained
until 1850. The letters in this book prove her to have been a
woman exceptionally endowed with intelligence, with kind-
ness and with humour. She is never malicious, but what she
writes is always interesting. She has an unerring eye for
the little laughable things which, even in royal Courts,
make up so large a part of human intercourse. In 1838
she writes from Windsor, “We are alone naw, several ton
weight of Royalty having departed.” In 1841 she describes
with inimitable verve how, during a drive to Woburn
Abbey, Mr. ANsoN quºte unintentionally “knocked off
Lord HEADFoRT's hat, always worn with a jaunty tapageur
slant on the top of his hair (suspected of being false),”
and how Lord HEADFort “sat down for a good while
on a basket full of currants put into the carriage for
luncheon.” In 1845 she gives us a pretty picture of the
QUEEN and the PRINCE CoNsort. The QUEEN, as it appears,
had by a false report been accused of Verdriesslichkeit

when they were travelling abroad, and it was judged right to
tell her the story. “Of course she (the Queen) listened with
an air of meek endurance, as usual, and said she feared she
might have looked cross from fatigue and shyness, before
she reached Coburg, but that it was dreadful to have it
Though of course this
may be merely his artfulness. To sum up, those who care
for a tale of simple happenings, told in a manner that at
its best is tenderly sentimental, and at its worst not wholly
free from sloppiness, will rejoice in Windyridge. The
others can keep away.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MORE SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
II.--THE STATESMAN.
ON a certain night in the middle
of the season all London was gathered
in Lady Marchpane's drawing - room;
all London, that is, which was worth
knowing — a qualification which ac-
counted for the absence of several
million people who had never heard
of Lady Marchpane. In one corner of
the room an Ambassador, with a few
ribbons across his chest, could have
been seen chatting to the latest Ameri-
can Duchess; in another corner one of
our largest Advertisers was exchanging
epigrams with a titled Newspaper Pro-
prietor. Famous Generals rubbed
shoulders with Post-Impressionist
Artists; Financiers whispered sweet
nothings to Breeders of prize Poms;
even an Actor-Manager might have
been seen accepting an apology from a
Royalty who had jostled him.
“Hallo,” said Algy Lascelles, catch-
ing sight of the dignifica figure of
Rupert Meryton in the crowd; “how's
William 2 '' -
A rare smile lit up Rupert's distin-
guished features. He was Under-
Secretary for Invasion Affairs, and
“William ” was Algy's pleasant way
of referring to the Bill which he was
now piloting through the House of
Commons. It was a measure for doing
something or other by means of a
what d'you call it—I cannot be more
precise without precipitating a Euro-
pean Conflict.
“I think we shall get it through,”
said Rupert calmly.
“Lady Marchpane was talking about
it just now. She's rather interested,
you know.”

head into the crowd.
coldly. -
It was barely ten years ago that
young Meryton, just down from Oxford,
had startled the political world by
capturing the important seat of Crickle-
wood (E.) for the Tariffadicals—as, to
avoid plunging the country into Civil
War, I must call them. This was at
a by-election, and the Liberatives had
immediately dissolved, only to come
into power after the General Election
with an increased majority. Through
the years that followed, Rupert Mery-
ton, by his pertinacity in asking the
Invasion Secretary questions which
had been answered by him on the
previous day, and by his regard for the
dignity of the House, as shown in his
invariable comment, “Come, come—
not quite the gentleman,” upon any
display of bad manners opposite, estab-

subsequent Tariffadical Government.
He had now been Under Secretary for
two years, and in this Bill his first real
chance had come.
“Oh, there you are, Mr. Meryton,”
said a voice. “Come and talk to me a
moment.” With a nod to a couple of
Archbishops Lady Marchpane led the
way to a little gallery whither the
crowd had not penetrated. Priceless
Correggios, Tintorettos and G. K.
Chestertons hung upon the walls,
but it was not to show him these that
she had come. Dropping into a won-
derful old Chippendale chair, she
motioned him to a Blundell-Maple
opposite her, and looked at him with a
curious smile. -
“Well,” she said, “about the Bill?”
Rupert's lips closed about his mouth
in a firm line. (He was rather good at
this.) Folding his arms, he gazed
steadily into Lady Marchpane's still
beautiful eyes.
“It will go through,” he said.
“Through all its stages,” he added
professionally.
“It must not go through,” said Lady
Marchpane gently.
Rupert could not repress a start, but
he was master of himself again in a
moment.
“I cannot add anything to my
previous statement,” he said.
“If it goes through,” began
Marchpane—
“I must refer you,” said Rupert, “to
my answer of yesterday.”
“Come, come, Mr. Meryton, what is
the good of fencing with me? You
know the position. Or shall I state it
for you again 2"
“I cannot believe you are serious.”
“I am perfectly serious. There are
reasons, financial reasons—and others,
why I do not want this Bill to pass.
In return for my silence upon a certain
matter, you are going to prevent it
passing. You know to what I refer.
On the 4th of May last—"
“Stop!" cried Rupert hoarsely.
“On the 4th of May last,” Lady
Marchpane went on relentlessly, “you
and I–in the absence of my husband
abroad—had tea together at an A.B.C.”
(Rupert covered his face with his
hands.) “I am no fonder of scandal
than you are, but if you do not meet
my wishes I shall certainly confess the
truth to Marchpane.”
“You will be ruined too !
Rupert. -
“My husband will forgive me and
take me back.” She paused signi-
ficantly. “Will Marjorie Hale—”
(Rupert covered his hands with his
face)—“will the good Miss Hale for-
give you? She is very strict, is she
Lady
said
politicians want money more than
scandal.” She raised her head sud-
denly at the sound of footsteps. “Ah,
Archbishop, I was just calling Mr.
Meryton's attention to this wonderful
Botticell ” (she looked at it more
closely)— “this wonderful Dana
Gibson. A beautiful piece of work, is
it not ?" The intruders passed on to
the supper-room, and they were alone
again. -
“What am I to do?” said Rupert
sullenly.
“The fate of the Bill is settled to-
day week, when you make your big
speech. You must speak against it.
Confess frankly you were mistaken.
It will be a close thing, anyhow.
Your influence will turn the scale.”
“It will ruin me politically.”
“You will marry Marjorie Hale and
be rich. No rich man is ever ruined
politically. Or socially.” She patted
his hand gently. “You’ll do it?”
He got up slowly. “You’ll see next
week,” he said.
It is not meet that we should watch
the unhappy Rupert through the long-
drawn hours of the night, as he
wrestled with the terrible problem. A
moment's sudden madness on that
May afternoon had brought him to the
cross-roads. On the one hand, repu-.
tation, wealth, the girl that he loved;
on the other, his own honour and so,
at least, he had said several times on
the platform—the safety of England.
He rose in the morning weary, but
with his mind made up.

Rupert Meryton was a speaker of a not
unusual type. Although he provided the
opinions himself, he always depended
upon his secretary for the arguments
with which to support them and the
actual words in which to give them
being. But on this occasion he felt
that a special effort was required of
him. He would show Lady Marchpane
that the blackmail of yesterday had
only roused him to a still greater effort
on behalf of his country. He would
write his own speech.
On the fateful night the House was
crowded. It seemed that all the guests
at Lady Marchpane's a week before
were in the Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery or behind the Ladies' Grille.

which Bill the secret history that I
have disclosed concerns itself, the Great
Powers in an instant would be at each
others' throats. But though I may not
disclose the speech I can tell of its effect
on the House. And its effect was curious.
It was, in short, the exact opposite of
what Rupert Meryton, that promising
Under Secretary, had intended.
It was the first speech that he had
ever prepared himself. Than Rupert
there was no more dignified figure in
the House of Commons; his honour
was proof, as we have seen, against
the most insidious temptations; yet,
since one man cannot have all the
virtues, he was distinctly stupid. It
would have been a hopeless speech
anyhow; but, to make matters worse, he
had, in the most important part of it,
attemped irony. And at the beginning
of the ironical passage even the Tarif-
fadical word-painters had to confess that
it was their own stalwarts who “sud-
As Lady Marchpane had said, it was
bound to be a close thing. The Libera-
tives and the Unialists, of course, were
solid against the Bill, but there was also
something of a cave in the Tariffadical
Party. It was bound to be a close
thing, and Rupert's speech just made
the difference. When he sat down the
waverers and doubters had made up
their minds.
The Bill was defeated.
That the Tariffadicals should resign
was natural; perhaps it was equally
natural that Rupert's secretary should
resign too. He said that his reputation
would be gone if Rupert made any
more speeches on his own, and that he
wasn't going to risk it. Without his
secretary Rupert was lost at the
General Election which followed. For-
tunately he had a grateful friend in
Lady Marchpane. She exerted her
influence with the Liberatives, and got

THE MOTOR SHOW.
By our Very Own Erpert.
THE Motor Show of 1912 is a thing
of the past, and there is nothing now
to be done but to wait till November,
1913. This is a truism—a word I
always use whenever I have a good
opportunity of misapplying it. While
we wait, however, there will be no
harm in filling up a few columns with
reflections, made as diffuse as possible,
on the leading events of the Show.
Among many new things at Olympia
it was pleasant, on first entering, to
recognise the familiar atmosphere of
last year, and I am glad to acknow-
ledge the courtesy of the powers that
be (1) in retaining the breathing mix-
ture intact and undiluted during the
intervening twelve months, so that
those who engaged in wordy conflict
on this subject last year might meet
and settle the matter in the very
presence. For my part, I found the
air everything I expected and in exact
accord with my previous descriptions.
It is a rich, dense and tasty blend, of
a bright nutty flavour, and of a re-
markably low specific gravity that
stimulates the action of the diaphragm
and promotes the deep breathing so
much urged by modern physicians.
“Make the gruel thick and slab,” says
the poet, and the powers that be (2) at
Olympia have followed his precept. It
is a fattening atmosphere rich in nutri-
ment in a minutely separated, easily
assimilated and appetising form. Taken
all in all it is a classy (1) breathing
mixture, the tobacco smoked last year
being of a high average order of merit,
conferring distinction upon the oxygen
present. Some unkind things were said
last year of the failure of the powers that
be (3) to maintain intact the original
virgin air enclosed when the building
was first roofed in; but it is only fair to
point out that it is impossible to keep the
air inviolate and unpolluted by leakage
from outside. Even with double doors
and all precautions to prevent draughts,
suction is induced by the passage in
and out of crowds of people, and, more-
over, all, these people bring fresh air
into the building in their hats, so that,
instead of anathematising the powers
that be (4) for not preserving the initial
air supply in its integrity, I commend
them, for doing all that is humanly
possible to maintain that ideal.
The WEAsel, Coy.
Various improvements have been
made by this enterprising firm in
their majestic 123 h.p. “Great Mogul."
Among other things the trip lash flange
releasing the tangent trunnion of the
fitted with a phosphor-bronze instead
of a cop-bronze nut, as it was found
that leakage from the accumulators
corroded the nut and gave it an ugly
appearance when the bonnet was raised.
The most important innovation, how-
ever, which will lead to a revolution in
the details of motor-body construction,
is that the stud for holding the hood-
strap is turned up, instead of down, as
formerly, so that it is now possible for
the owner to get into his car without
ripping out his side pocket.
THE BIMI RUN-About.
Another new revolution has been
effected in this little side-car which, in
common with every other car at the
Show, was so much praised kast year;
in fact, as the genial manager (1) of the
Company told me with pardonable pride,
“Nothing remains of last year's design
except the transfer bearing the word
‘Bimi.’” The little car will continue
to commend itself to motorists. The
foot-boards are now so arranged that
when climbing a hill the red-hot cylin-
der will not burn off the motorist's
boots, and by a most ingenious device,
too complicated to describe, the spark
is automatically switched off and the
brakes automatically applied just before
(not after) the steering column crumples
up. One common form of fatality is
therefore avoided by the little “Bimi.”
For a trifling extra charge a special
guard is now fitted (detachable at will
in 14:37 secs.) by which it is made
impossible for the tails of the rider's
dress coat to get wound up in the driv-
ing-hub. This will appeal to classy (2)
motor-cyclists who have experienced
the inconvenience of arriving at a
dinner-party on foot, forty minutes late,
with their coat-tails torn off. A handy
little “Self-aid” surgical case is sup-
plied with each “Bimi" entirely free
of charge, and should form a great
attraction, comprising as it does tourni-
quet, cocaine, brandy, with probe and
forceps for locating , and extracting
sparking plugs, and other necessaries.
TRIAL RUN of A 12-H.P. PIFF-PAFF.
I was glad to accept the hospitable
offer of the genial manager (2) of Piff.
Paff Limited and Reduced, and experi-
ence a run in the Company's 12-h.p.
four-cylinder touring car, with two-
seater body. This car is fitted with a
patent dog-clip on the bonnet, which
makes it impossible for a dog travelling
in the car to lie down on the acceler.
ator or try to jump into the driver's
lap, a thoughtful arrangement which
should be made standard for all two-
seaters. We had a most interesting
run, and I was able to make a thorough
handled. Leaving the company's well-
known works in Radgrane Street, we
took the turning into Palace Road on
the second speed, and soon reached
St. James's Park, when we were stopped
by the gatekeeper, as the exhaust was
smoking, due to a defect in the lubri-
cating oil, as the genial manager (3)
explained to me. Owing to the hard-
ness of the London water, the radiator
boiled as we went up Castle Lane, and
eventually we found it convenient to
stop in Victoria Street just above the
Stores, as the paint was beginning to
blister on the bonnet. I may say in
passing that the amount of attention
the racy lines of this classy (3) little car
attracted was quite remarkable. We
found the engine at a cherry-red heat,
and my genial host (4) informed me
that this was an excellent thing, as it
ensured that the casting would be
thoroughly annealed and correct any
tendency to fatigue of the metal. It,
soon transpired that nothing was
wrong, but that the water had drained
from the radiator into the crank cham-
ber owing to some displacement of the
pump casing by the man who last
cleaned the car; and I was lucky to
have this opportunity of confirming
the claim made by the company as to
the ease with which the pump can be
dismantled. Very little thought con-
firmed us in the best course to pursue,
and, after one or two attempts from the
top with the handle of the jack, my
genial companion (5) borrowed the key
of the adjoining church and, working
from beneath the car, in less than an
hour the casing came away, the gland
was exposed, and the defect remedied
temporarily with brown paper and
butter.
The courteous police gave us every
assistance by diverting the traffic and
maintaining a cordon to keep back the
crowd, and we were speedily under way.
At Shaftesbury Avenue the little car
stopped again; and my genial host (6)
explained that the engine had siezed
up, and called my attention with justi-
fiable pride to the fact that there is
not another engine on the market that
would have gone so far with the crank
chamber full of water as the little 12-h.p.
Piff-Paff had done. We were in the
neighbourhood of the restaurants, and
I had the gratification of returning the
hospitality extended to me. When we
returned we found a derrick in attend-
ance and the car in mid-air being slung
on to a trolley, and one could not but
admire the ease with which the work
was done and recall the advantage
claimed for the light weight of these
cars, which, with two-seater body, dog-
clip and lamps complete, weighs less

FYTTES FOR THE PANTOMIMES,

Being the sort of article that any
paper is glad to print at this time
of the year.
“TELL you about the Christmas
songs?” said Mr. Mendelssohn Browne,
the well-known music - publisher.
“Why, of course. Sit down.” Our
special very young man sat.
“Wit without vulgarity,” Mr. Browne
continued, “that's our motto. The
great British public will not for an
instant tolerate anything that is in at
all doubtful taste. -
“First of all, place aur dames" (Mr.
Browne has been over to Boulogne);
“let us take the hero. No self-respect-
ing principal boy will consider she is
doing her duty by the management if
she does not warble our new topical
sºng, ‘A Bit of a Nut—eh what,’ and
also that patriotic masterpiece, ‘Come
along and help yourself to Turkey.'
That's topical too, of course.
“For the principal girl there is
Miss Birdie Twitter's summer success,
‘Mother's little tiny Drop of Comfort.'
The touching refrain,
‘No, it's not a drop of gin that I find my
comfort in,
But a tiny little toddeller of four,”
will find an echo in every mother's
healt.”
“And the dame?” asked our very
young man.
“He, too, is well supplied. Perhaps
you've heard “Father's put the Lodger
through the Hoop,' one of those mas-
terly little sketches of low life that can
always command a princely salary.
Then again there is ‘Percy's grown
too big for Father's Pants,’ at once
humorous, pathetic and wholly true to
the best canons of pantomimic art.
Listen,” and he recited—
“‘Percy ain't ungrateful in the ordinary way;
Percy's quite a decent sort of kid;
Not a word of imperence to me 'e'll ever say
"Cos 'e knows that 'e would cop it if 'e
did ("ave a banana).
But I likes to save me money, and the way
the nipper grows,
Oh, it doesn't give the 'ousekeeping a
chance;
“Cutting down " 'as got to end and the
cash I've got to spend,
Now that Percy's grown too big for
father's pants.'
“By the way,” Mr. Browne, who is
an enthusiast on his subject, went on,
“have you heard ‘It’s always rather
crowded in my heart"? That's going
to be popular, too.” Our representa-
tive pleaded not guilty, and was regaled
with the refrain, of which, however, he
can only remember—
“There's Tom and Dick and Harry love me
quite as much as you,
And of my love they each demand a part;
Still, I'll love you all I can since you ask

ExTRACTED FROM THE DIAity of Toby, M.P.
House of Commons, Monday, Novem- peradventure another division.
ber 18.—Of the situation created last
week, varying monotony of Committee
stage of Home Rule Bill, this afternoon
was at once the most dramatic and the
quietest stage. To ill-regulated mind
it suggested memories of a day in the
magisterial court of Mr. Nupkins, when
Mr. Pickwick and his friends were
brought up under arrest for alleged dis-
orderly conduct. As in case of PREMIER
and his Resolution rescinding the BAN-
BURY Amendment there was adjourn-
ment followed by transmogrification
of the scene. On his first appearance
Mr. Pickwick, bullied by the Bench,
howled at by the crowd, was convicted
and ordered to find bail with alternative
of imprisonment. Then came adjourn-
ment, followed, on reassembling of
Court, by honourable acquittal, general
acquiescence and invitation to dine
with the magistrate.
Meeting to-day after adjournment
from Thursday, House again crowded

he made plain business statement.

broke off.
Thus nothing will have happened
except loss of seven Parliamentary
days, which will be recaptured either
at expense of a Christmas holiday, at
its best unseasonably brief, or by exten-
sion of session in New Year.
When PREMIER resumed his seat,
having been on his legs less than ten
minutes, profound silence fell over
crowded assembly. All eyes were
turned upon Front Opposition Bench
where BonneR sat amid his colleagues.

that it was all over and in this prosaic
fashion. Only when PARLIAMENTARY
SECRETARY FoR BoARD of TRADE ap-
peared at Table and began to talk of
Light Railways Bill as amended in
Standing Committee, they rose and
made for the door. At twenty-two
minutes past six all was over, Home

away in good time to dress for dinner.

consequent on Snap Division of last
Monday agreed to without further
wrangling. -
Tuesday.—House, once more clothed
and in right mind, set itself to discuss new
formula designed to replace Resolution
disfigured by BANBURY Amendment.
For eight hours it pegged away, speech
following speech with direful regularity.
Marked peculiarity of debate was fact
that two Irish Members, GINNELL and
CLANCY, took part in it, TIM HEALY
occasionally nipping in with interjection
designed to bring low his compatriots.
As a rule the harp that once through
Tara's halls the soul of music shed
now hangs as mute on Westminster's
walls as if that soul were dead. Of
course it isn't. Current circumstances
arise out of shrewd appreciation of
opportunity. Home Rule Bill must be
got through all its stages in order to
be sent on to the Lords as what Lord
HALSBURY would call “a sort of "
Christmas card. Time is short; every
quarter of an hour precious. If an
Irish Member uses one or more for
delivery of a speech he increases pres-
sure and imperils passage of Bill. Ac-
cordingly, at what personal cost in
individual cases who shall say, the rank
and file of Redmondites have sat and
listened to others talking, themselves
dumb.
Swift MAcNEILL providentially dis-
covered opportunity at Question time
for opening safety-valves. Usually
manages to get in a Supplementary
Question giving light and leading to
one or other or both Front Benches.
The rest suffer in silence with heroism
that recalls memories of the Spartan
boy subjected to attentions of surrepti-
tious fox. Mr. FLAVIN says he is not
sure he would not be disposed to strike
a bargain about the fox. Certainly the
animal making free with your vitals is
not a desirable companion. And the
pain, taking extreme form of indiges-
tion following upon presence of an
undelivered speech, makes a man ready
to chance a change.
Whether on the scaffold high or
on battle-field they die, Irish patriots
have ever been ready to sacrifice them-
selves for the benefit of their country.

less discipline it has never been excelled.

ally how incomprehensible. At one
point CATHCART WASON frankly ad-
mitted that the more Irish Finance was
discussed the more complicated became
the problem. If a statesman of his

is to be hoped from lesser mortals?

of Commons is the spirit of camaraderie
which underlies its constitution, occa-
sionally asserting itself in most un-
promising circumstances. It is reason-
able to suppose that after incident of
yesterday week something of Arctic
coolness would have sprung up between
the WINsoME WINSTON and that deadly
swift bowler, RoNALD M'NEILL. On the
contrary, SARK tells me it has been
followed by exceptionally warm friend-

whether he will be strung up at the

of how the little misunderstanding of

fashioning them arrow-shape and dis-
charging volleys across the Table at His
MAJESTY's Ministers filing out behind

was suddenly—and therefore perhaps a
little hazily—flooded with memories of
JENNY GEDDEs. He recalled how her
three-cornered stool, flung pulpitwards
in the sacred edifice of St. Giles',
Edinburgh, wrought marked effect upon
subsequent course of Church history in
Scotland. Didn't happen to be a three-
legged stool within reach; but there
was handy a tightly-bound volume
suitable for purposes of missile. This
he seized and with well-directed aim
very nearly succeeded in catching eye
of FIRST LORD of ADMIRALTY.
By a fine touch of irony the volume
contained directions for the orderly
conduct of Parliamentary proceedings.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
POLITICAL DEDUCTIONS,
IN reply to a question advanced
during the Home Rule debates, “Who
is going to be Chairman of the Joint
Exchequer Board 2" Mr. HERBERT
SAMUEL in the House of Commons
stated that to appoint or name a chair-
man now would be “counting the
chickens before they are hatched.”
This item of news appears in The
Daily Express under the headlines
“Home Rule Cat Escapes—Remarkable
Admission by a Minister,” and is inter-
preted to mean that the Government
do not expect the Home Rule Bill to
pass.
Such a brilliant deduction has al-
ready stimulated other students of the
political situation to put forward con-
clusions based on apparently trivial
remarks.
Thus Mr. BoxAR LAw's innocent
question, “Do we pay old-age pensions
in Uganda?” is understood to mean
that, so far from abolishing old-age
pensions in the United Kingdom, it is
the intention of the Unionist party,
when returned to power, to extend the
system to all British Protectorates.
The news has been received with the
greatest satisfaction by the natives of
Uganda, among whom birth certificates
are unknown.
Again, the epithet “Old Cromwell,”
which has been applied to Mr. Asquith,
is considered to possess extraordinary
significance. It is thought that the
PREMIER himself invented the designa-
tion and secretly caused it to be
circulated with the object of preparing
the ground for a great coup by which
Parliament is to be disbanded and a
Dictatorship established.
Another sensational prophecy is
founded upon the words recently uttered
by Mr. REDMOND, “The democratic
forces are determined to . . . preserve
cheaper food for the people.” This
remark is supposed to indicate beyond
question that the whole of the Coalition
intends to resign its seats in Parliament
in a body and to embark upon the meat-
packing and jam-making industries on
a large scale.
From Bachelor's Buttons, p. 38:-
“‘This garden requires at least two
gardeners.' --
‘And it will have two—me and Angus.”
For close on forty years I had had to be
grammatically correct. Now I take a pleasure
in being as much otherwise as possible. Each
time I say ‘me’ for ‘I,’ one of the shackles
of the past falls away.”
The writer's attempts to talk ungram-
matically are pathetic. Once again he
has missed it, and the shackles of the
past remain. Next time he might try

POLITICAL DEDUCTIONS.
IN reply to a question advanced
during the Home Rule debates, “ Who
is going to be Chairman of the Joint
Exchequer Board ? ” Mr. HERBERT
SAMUEL in the House of Commons
stated that to appoint or name a chair-
would be "counting the
chickens before they are hatched.”
This item of news appears in The
Daily Express under the headlines
"Home Rule Cat Escapes—Remarkable
Admission by a Minister,” and is inter-
preted to mean that the Government
do not expect the Home Rule Bill to
pass.
Such a brilliant deduction has al-
ready stimulated other students of the
political situation to put forward con-
clusions based on apparently trivial
remarks.
Thus Mr. BONAR LAW's innocent
question, "Do we pay old-age pensions
in Uganda ?” is understood to mean
that, so far from abolishing old-age
pensions in the United Kingdom, it is
the intention of the Unionist party,
when returned to power, to extend the
system to all British Protectorates.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE GARVINIZER OF VICTORY.
(With acknowledgments to “The Pall Mall Gazette's "
article, “The P. M. G.' and the War,” Nov. 13th.)
OUR special representative in the 13alkans, whose duty
it has been to keep in close touch with the belligerent
monarchs, sends us the following information by our own
service of airships:–
“It is well known,” he writes, “that IKING PETER of
SERVIA is one of the most unapproachable of men. As soon,
however, as he heard that The P. M. G. had authorised me
to open pourparlers with him in Uskub, he sent four of his
aides-de-camp to beg me to accord him an interview. I at
once consented, and was escorted by the entire regiment of
Royal Guards to the newly-conquered Palace of the Kara-
georgevitch dynasty. The monarch, having helped me to
divest myself of my hat and coat, requested me to permit
him, on behalf of The P. M. G., to address an ultimatum to
Austria-Hungary. He added that the services rendered by
The P. M. G. to the cause of Servia were indelibly engraved
on all Servian hearts. The public is aware that but for these
services the capture of Uskub could not have occurred.
“In other quarters the far-reaching influence of The
P. M. G. has made itself felt no less sensibly. An ex-
perienced and cool-headed diplomat told me smilingly that
KING FERDINAND has had The P. M. G. War Notes trans-
lated into the Bulgarian language, and is accustomed to
read them aloud to the Bulgarian General Staff. General
SAvor F, having committed only one paragraph to memory,
immediately afterwards gained the victory of Lule Burgas.
The General has already expressed his gratitude in the
warmest terms. ‘Tell. The P. M. G.,” he said, ‘that but
for the support given to the Bulgarians by The P. M. G.
we should never have been where we hope to be to-morrow.'
This was said yesterday, but reasons of State forbid me to
reveal where the Bulgarian Army finds itself to-day.
“The Kings of Greece and Montenegro are equally
enthusiastic. “If one man,’ said KING Nicholas, ‘could
have taken Skutari, that one man would have been '—but I
must leave the rest to the imagination of readers of The
P. M. G. “We shall make no peace,' said KING GEoRGE,
‘without submitting the terms to The P. M. G.; of that you
may rest assured.’ Observing that I was rolling up my
war-map, His Majesty added with a smile, ‘You remind
me of Pitt, who, you will remember, asked that the map of
Europe should be rolled up.’ This was most gratifying to
the representative of a journal which has during this
anxious time endeavoured to display those qualities of
statesmanship, audacity, resource and genius which are
usually, and perhaps rightly, attributed to the pilot who
weathered the storm.
“It remains only to mention the Sultan of TURREY.
His Imperial Ottoman Majesty has been able to console
himself in his troubles by reading the comments of The
P. M. G. on the vicissitudes of Turkish affairs. On being
told of the Bulgarian advance on Constantinople, His
Majesty murmured in a broken voice, ‘Where was The
P. M. G. 2' It is quite unnecessary to say more than that.
I now propose to visit Potsdam via Vienna.”
From a bootmaker's advertisement:—
“Our Repairing Speaks for Itself.
Have you heard it 2 ”
Yes. We distinctly remember, last August, hearing several
pairs of it going up the aisle of the Wee Free Church at
“BogEY FIVE";
on, THE CUNNING Counsellor.
TAINT hope, like a fantail a-flutter
In the light of the crimsoning West –
Faint hope, like a lucifer splutter,
I’lared up at the last in my breast
As I looked on my new aluminium putter
In the bag with the rest.
Very wrathful and keen were the faces
Of niblick and mashie and cleek,
And my driver made angry grimaces,
And my brassie, that struggled to speak,
IIe was merciless too; but, demure as the Graces,
Compassionate, meek,
Calm-featured, as lo! when thou peerest
Through forests of pine-trees that mix,
On a sudden there shines at her clearest
The moon—in the maze of my sticks
I beheld him, the crown of the bunch and the
dearest - - - -
(By about three-and-six.)
And I said to him, “Son, thou art wiser,
Thy brethren are feckless and daft,
Thou art prince of them all and adviser,
What an if thou art short in the shaft 2
So is Asquith and so is LLoyd GEoRGE and the
KAISER,
Yet look at their craft.
I have been where the water was glassy,
'In desolate ruts I have been, -
And my third (which was not very classy)
Was entrapped in the boughs of the treen,
And behold with my fourth, a circuitous brassie,
I am still off the green.
The brows of thy brethren are torrid,
They reek with the sweat of the fray,
With the divoted turf they are horrid,
And with lumps of environing clay;
Come up, then, thou bald-head | Thy luminous
forehead
Is lord of the day.”
So I spoke and, as erst, when the issues
Of war were debated at Troy,
It was not to the strength of the tissues
Of Ajax, too hot to destroy,
That the victory fell, but the feints of Odysseus,
That artful old boy.
Dven so the bright visage that butted
Did all that I prayed it to do;
Even so I sagaciously putted
A pill that ran perfectly true,
And Thomas took four on the green and “tut-
tutted"
(Having got there in two). Evoe.
From an advertisement in The Times : —
“Jones's West Monmouthshire School, Pontypool.—Resident
Headmaster wanted in January, 1913. Fixed Salary, £400 per annum,
with residence, coal, gas, rates, and one maid valued at an additional
£100 per annum.”
Our cook, having caught sight of this, has given us notice,
Achnagallagach.

AT THE PLAY.
THE HAYMARKET TRIPLE BILL.
THE mantle of Bunty—to say nothing
of her crinoline—is a difficult garment
to fit upon a successor, and the Hay-
market management did well to pro-
vide so good a Variety Entertainment
to take the place of the dear departed.
At the same time I rather wonder that
they should have chosen for their chief
item one of those strictly Sabbatarian
interiors with which, in a different
geographical setting, Bunty had suffi-
ciently familiarized us.
Indeed, The Younger Generation must
have been something of a disappoint-
ment to those among Mr. STANLEY
Houghton's many admirers who had
looked to him for a note of freshness
and distinction. His Hindle Wakes
introduced us to a new and disturbing
problem. The theme of The Younger
Generation—the revolt of grown-up
children against the narrowness of their
home-life—is as old and obvious as the
everlasting hills. His sense of the
values of observed detail is not less fine
than before, and there is more gaiety in
his humour, but the atmosphere, except

outer air, seems always a little used-up.
We are sadly accustomed on the
stage to cheap ridicule of the Church,
and to exchange this for cheap ridicule
of the Chapel is to offer a variant, but
not a novelty. And Mr. Houghton
makes the mistake, common in the
young, of confusing virtue with the
excess of it, which is a vice (see WALK-
LEY on ARISTOTLE). He elects, quite
permissibly, to portray some very strait
samples of Dissent. But that is not
enough for him. He wants us, on the
strength of this picture, to laugh at the
idea of the Chapel as a centre of social
life. Yet, if allowance is made for
different temperaments, why should
this be any more ridiculous than the
idea, for instance, of their temple-
worship as the centre of the social
life of the Greeks 2 What would Mr.
Houghton have us choose instead 2
The realistic stage, perhaps? Heavens !
And, when his young man breaks out
and gets drunk as a protest against the
narrowness of his upbringing, and is
made to say in effect, “ Human nature
demands some such relief; that is the
secret of the Salvation Army,” surely

imagine that he is imposing on any but
the most fatuous of his audience. He
is not likely to damage very greatly the
credit of the Salvation Army, but he is
|pretty sure to damage his own, and
badly.
Mr. Houghton will please forgive my
attitude of heavy father; but he is a
writer of unusual talent, and I should
be sorry to see him drift into the old
ruts, and find content in tickling the

It is hard to judge how much the

exception their excellence was extra-
ordinary. The brunt of the work fell
upon Mr. STANLEY DREwiTT, whose
performance was flawless but for the
exaggerated unctuousness of his voice.

was that when the gods want to deal
out poetic justice they are not very
particular about their instruments: an
impostor will serve as well as a better
man. It was an engaging little
episode—An Adventure of Aristide
Pujol, adapted from Mr. LocKE's new
book. It began a little stiffly with a
rather too ingenuous device for letting
the audience know where they were.
But after this it went with a joyous
fluency, thanks to the Gallic breeziness
of Mr. LEoN LION as the undefeatable
Aristide, and the British bluster of
Mr. FEwlAss LLEweLLYN as the dealer
in picture-fakes.
It was followed by The Golden Doom,
a phantasy by Lord DUNSANY. Out-
side the door of an Assyrian palace
two sentries stood and talked of affairs
of state, just as they do outside Buck-
ingham Palace. Entered a little girl
who had a boon to ask of the Monarch.
The Monarch not being available, she
prayed to his door, saying, “I want a
little hope!" The exact nature of her
ambition was left vague for the time;
but it subsequently appeared that what
she wanted was a little hoop. She was
joined by a boy playmate who had
just composed a quatrain, which he
recited. It was about a purple bird
that went up against the sky. He
could have made more lines than four,
but had run out of rhymes for sky.
(Lord DUNSANY is clearly a poet, and
understands the exigencies of Art.)
So the little maiden contributed a fifth
line, “I saw him die.” It was a foot
short, a defect which was quickly
pointed out by the author of the
quatrain, but the soundness of the
rhyme was incontestable. The girl,
who had been to a Board School, wrote
the five lines on the King's door in
local characters with a bit of gold she
had picked up, the sentries meanwhile
standing a few yards away with their
attention diverted. Then the children
went away.
Now entered the Monarch, forerun
by three nearly naked spies, who ex-
ecuted various evolutions of a strangely
serpentine character. The royal notice
was drawn to the writing on the door.
Who could have done it? Owing to
the unpardonable obtuseness of the
sentries no suspicion falls upon the
culprit. Soothsayers are sent for, and
each in turn, as he reads the final line,
“I saw him die,” receives a shock.
All agree that it indicates the over-
throw of the kingdom. A few Assyrian
incantations are murmured and they
go into mourning. The Monarch, re-
cognising with great fortitude that the
stars are against him, thinks he might
save the situation for his people by a
his crown and sceptre and announces
his fixed intention of becoming even as
one of the humblest of his subjects.
Depositing these symbols of empire on
the ground and giving strict instruc-
tions that they are not to be touched,
he enters the palace. If crown and
sceptre miraculously disappear by the
next morning this should imply that
the gods have accepted his sacrifice.
The three spies, who might have been
of some use outside, stupidly follow the
King into the palace and spend the
night there. The two sentries, totally
ignoring their obvious duty, immediately
go off on remote beats. At dawn the
little girl returns, kneels down again
before the King's door and says, “I

want a little hope.' Rising, she
detects the golden emblems, joyfully
seizes one in each hand, whacks the
crown with the sceptre and bowls it off
into the wings like a hoop.
The Monarch, issuing from his palace,
finds that his regal gawds have dis-
appeared. Taking no cognisance of the
truancy of the sentries, he concludes
that the crown and sceptre have been
divinely spirited away, and that the
stars have accepted his sacrifice.
There was little beauty in the play to
take the eye; the dialogue was heavy,
and its delivery (if we except the Chief
Prophet, Mr. EwAN BRook) not very
satisfactory. But two rather pleasant
strains of irony ran through the
scheme, shewing (1) that a child's
trivial writing on a door may be enough
to unseat a dynasty; (2) that it may
need a king's sacrifice of his crown to
get a little girl the toy that she wants.
mensurate with their causes. I take
this to be the interpretation of the
author's symbolism (if I am right in
suspecting him of any such motive).
I have not the heart to pursue the
subsequent history either of the Mon-
arch or of the little girl. In about
ten minutes, if there is anybody in the
place who has a little more intelligence
than the three spies and the two
sentries, her theft will be discovered.
What will happen to the Monarch I
can only conjecture; but the little
girl's position would seem practically
hoopless.
“SYLVIA GREER.”
In Tantrums it was a shrew; and
now in Sylvia Greer it is a minx. But
the earlier play, as Isaid at the time, had
an idea in it; and I could trace none here.
Of course it is always pleasant to be
told that the most selfish and offensive
woman has a sort of a heart hidden
away somewhere which threatens to be
unworldly; but, when the man who
finds it takes his discovery very coolly
and doesn't quite seem to know what
to do with it, interest lapses. The play
went moderately well for two Acts, but
crumpled up in the third. What
episodes there were did not contribute
much to the scheme. A girl had an
epileptic fit on the stage and somebody
sent the minx an anonymous letter to
say that her mother had been no better
than she should be. But each of these
incidents was just introduced for joy.
There was only one really cheerful
feature. It was a man who stuttered
and insisted on talking golf-shop—well-
known weaknesses, both of them, but
seldom found in this happy conjunction.
Miss ETHELWARwick, as SylviaGreer,
has a reminiscent manner. I was con-
stantly reminded of Miss ALEXANDRA
CARLISLE. But she has a piquancy of
her own, if only she would not work it
too hard. Mr. GUY STANDING was at-
tractive as the strong man. He kept
his strength under control, and never
used it like the rugged giant he was
represented to be. I don't think he
was ever quite sure why he kept
coming in by the balcony at midnight
to see Sylvia, instead of by the front-
door at tea-time.
The popular Mr. LowNE had no
chance, and the other dull or disagree-
able parts were played in a manner
worthy of a better cause.
Criticism of the author is disarmed
by the fact that he preferred to leave
his name out of the bill. I dare not
probe his reasons, which are sacred.
But he is reported to be a writer of
established reputation, and we can all
guess that something must have hap-
pened, even if we can't guess what.

The Nest (ARNOLD) takes its name from the first of a
collection of short stories by ANNE Douglas SEDGwick,
which seem to me to be of very unusual quality. But,
then, I am specially susceptible to the good short-story,
always far too rare a bird in English fiction. Not that I
exactly liked all these; very far from it. On the contrary,
one of them, The Nest itself, seemed to me, while I admired
its diabolical cleverness, so painful and probing that I was
induced to question whether any author was justified in
writing it. It is about a man who, given a month to live
by his doctor, spends that month with his adoring wife in
such a state of super-emotional strain that its end—and
the discovery that the verdict was false—sees them perma-
nently estranged. Told, as I say, with an almost horrible
gift for exposing the recesses of the human character, this
tale haunts one afterwards. There are others, however,
where comedy is the chief feature. In all of them the
adventures are mental rather than physical; and in each
you will be struck by some new and arresting turn of
phrase, which yet by its aptness avoids the snares of affect-
ation. Thus, women who had been the intellectual com-
panions of the hero are described as “knowing their way
about his mind and soul;" and this is but one remembered
at random. There will, I hope, be a good welcome for
The Nest from those who can appreciate fine craftmanship,
and have sensibilities so robust that they need not wince at
Adam Lindsay Gordon and his Friends (CoNSTABLE), by
EDITH HUMPHRIs and Douglas SLADEN, is by no means a
formal “Life.” It is rather an olla podrida concerned with
the unhappy poet whom Mr. SLADEN calls “the Bylon of
Australia . . one of the most romantic figures in literature.”
Born in the Azores of Scottish parents in 1833, he was
educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military
Academy, whence he appears to have retired under compul-
sion, went to Australia in 1853, joined the South Australian
Mounted Police, became a horse-breaker, married in 1862,
was elected a Member of the South Australian Parliament in
1865, rode many steeple-chases successfully, and in 1870,
under the stress of financial difficulties acting on a con-
stitution enfeebled by a serious riding accident, he shot
himself. Mr. SLADEN has contributed to this book a chapter
on Gordon as a Poet, in parts of which, though not in the
conclusion, the note of eulogy is pitched too high, and is
sustained without sufficient discrimination. Of “The Ride
from the Wreck,” for instance, he says “The i. was of
course inspired by Browning's ‘How they brought the
News to Ghent’” [he means, I suppose, “How They
brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix”) “published
ten or twenty years earlier, but in every way is superior to
Browning's manufactured article. For in Gordon's poem
we have the description, not from an observer but from the
man who did the ride, or other such rides, while Browning
did not write like a man-at-arms any more than he looked
like a man-at-arms.” This pertness is ridiculous. A glance
at GoRDON's poem will show not merely that it was inspired

—at any rate not in that way—had BrowNING abstained feel yourself plunged suddenly into a company of entire
from writing his grand galop. Moreover, if BRowNING's
article is to be sneered at as “manufactured,” what is to be
said of TENNYsoN, who did not exactly write (or look) like
an Elizabethan sailor-man or a Crimean cavalry-man?
And under this test how much would be left of Mr. KIPLING,
another of Mr. SLADEN's heroes? The truth is that a
great deal of GoRDoN's poetry, though the open-air quality
of it is his own, is in expression merely imitative, now of
Sw1NBURNE, now of BRowNING, or again, as in In Utrumque
Paratus, of Hoop. Still, when all deductions have been
made, there remains a small amount of authentic poetry,
purely original in conception and expression, which justifies
his claim to a seat on Parnassus. All those who have been
attracted by his writings and have heard of his unhappy life
and his tragic death will find in this volume much to
interest them.
Frederick Hewitt Molyneur, gentleman of leisure, in order
strangers, to none of whom have you been introduced, and
none of whom condescends to a word of explanation as
to his past or present. When, however, the inevitable
strangeness of this has worn off, you will find them exceed-
ingly pleasant. Do not expect them to do or suffer anything
whatever, except exist amusingly. Nothing happens from
the first page to the last; which is perhaps why I am con-
vinced that the book must be true. It is just a picture
of a Russian country family, noble but not wealthy, and
a record of their placid, conservative and happy routine.
Throughout you will be struck by the pleasing absence
of bombs and vodka and hereditary madness—of all the
things, in short, which you have probably learnt to consider
inseparable from home-life in Russia. To watch Baroness
AMINoFF's charming family picnicing in a wood, conspiring
over surreptitious gifts to their delightful mother, and
troubled by nothing more serious than the tardy completion
of a wedding-dress, is to enjoy an entirely new view of what

look of the exclusive Lady

such as this:—“tricks that were absolutely mouldy by the
time Ananias told Sapphira she was the tastiest bit of
fluff in Jerusalem"—leaves me cold. Nor can I see eye to
eye with Mr. Schwan N in his estimate of the humour of
Mr. Molyneur, drunk, throwing the slippers of female fellow-
diners at the heads of male fellow-diners; sitting down on
a dog-biscuit; or falling into a pond. The only part of the
story which seems to suggest that the author, having rid
his i. of much ponderous waggishness, may later on
write something approaching good light comedy, is the
chapter dealing with the happy and untidy married life of
the Hon. Maurice Lester, the “nut,” and Julia Delorme,
the chorus-girl. For quite a while the dialogue is on a
high level, and then down sits Mr. Molyneur on the dog-
biscuit and all is over.

Walk (Constable), because, to tell the truth, for a con-

Darlington of his daughter Violet. When diphtheria brings
Lady Violet to death's door, Cyril performs that heroic
operation which sometimes saves a patient, and in this case
gives him both the life and love of his young ward. The
author reproduces amusingly the conversation of that type
which says, if not the same smart things, always the same
kind of smart things in the same smart way. Perhaps the
weak point is that folk of real character don't adopt this
rather cheap derivative sort of attitude; also that a con-
tinued habit of scoffing at all sincerities and endeavours
effectually sterilises the scoffer. The author's sympathies
seem generally with the poseurs, if not with the pose. Lord
Darlington, the chivalrous founder of the Samurai, is made
rather a bore. Mr. McKENNA has indeed been less con-
cerned with serious ideas, whether challenging or orthodox,
than with the superficial witticisms and railleries of his
puppets. But he has certainly succeeded in being entertain-
ing, and (if he be a young writer) of suggesting that he can
put more meat and no less seasoning into a better book.

[To KAISER FRANCIS-Joseph, KING PETER, and others whom it may
concern. Written after reading a most entertaining and erudite
article in The Westminster Gazette on the above and other brigand
types that make up the variegated population of Albania.]
OLD Dual Monarch, you who don't at all
Approve of Servian thrusters grown ecstatic
Over the loud demand to have a small
Bow-window looking on the Adriatic,
But look for further swag,
Adding Albania to your unearned Bosnian bag;-
And you, KING PETER, who on this crusade
(Purely a Christian warfare, so you term it),
Claim solid recompense for having played
The part of your old namesake, PETER HERMIT,
Saying, “This useful pitch is
The proper perks of Us, the Karageorgevitches;–
And you, ye armchair referees, who shout,
“Albania for the Albanians! Give 'em freedom,
The right to work their own salvation out,
With some good Prince or President to lead 'em –
Either a local Pagan
Or else the usual younger son from Copenhagen;"—
Have you considered what their views may be,
This fancy race of Opera-bouffe banditti,
Lawless as is the incorrigible sea,
Their morals vague, their manners very gritty,
Their dearest home-delight
To lay the unoffending stranger out at sight?
To them, untutored in the Higher Life,
Reading and writing are the work of wizards:
They'd do their voting with the naked knife
Plunged in the opposition party's gizzards;
- That, sure as eggs is eggs, -
Would be the pointed method of the Tosks and Ghegs.
Their history tells no tale of any tax,
And as for Health-Insurance, our LLoyd GEORGEs
Might send their minions forth on pathless tracks
Whistling for stamps in steaming torrent-gorges,
In devious dell or bosk,
And never squeeze a tanner out of Gheg or Tosk.
Taught, every tribal babe, a taste for gore,
They hate each other hard, but hate still harder
The fool who interlopes along their shore,
Suspect of loose designs upon their larder;
Him, as I just now said,
They shoot without preliminaries through the head.
They seldom care to die a natural death,
For he alone, none else, is counted true man,
The right Albanian stuff, who yields his breath
Barging against some law divine or human;
Their modes of crime are many,
The plain vendetta being liked as much as any.
Such are the natives, such the brigand breeds
(Candidates, half of them, for execution),
For whom the pundits, busy with their screeds,
Offer to build a stately constitution,
Modelled on some fair plan—
The Swiss arrangement or the Nicaraguan.
Europe, of course, may shed her silly skin
That PETE or FRANcis-J. be made Protector;
But, failing this, if they should call me in,

BEAUTY CHATS.
By Gwendolen de St. Clair.
“HoPELEss.”—Why do you persist in using that sad
name? I promise that, if you persevere with my treat-
ment, you will soon not be able to recognise yourself.
In the meantime, as you seem to have a remarkably nice
nape to your neck (a very unusual beauty'), wear collarless
gowns, dress your hair high, and always remember to
turn the nape of your neck to anyone you may be
conversing with-first giving it a dust with my Beautaline
Powder (5s. 6d. per box).
“DisappoINTED.”— My dear unreasonable Friend | Did
I not impress upon you that Il faut souffrir pour étre belle 2
And though you complain that so far “it’s all souffrir
and no belle," you will soon, soon alter your opinion.
Try to put more faith in the treatment. Little lines come
through giving way to a sceptical attitude of mind.
“HYACINTH.”—You ought not to find sleep impossible
with my Eye-lengthening machine and Smile-producer
properly strapped and screwed into place. You evidently
do not adjust them according to the printed instructions.
“Gwen.”—I am sorry the Eyelashes fell into your soup
at a dinner-party. Am sending you another box with
needles, silks, etc. Sew them in more firmly this time.
“BABs.”—See answer to “Gwen.” It may be a little
painful, when the Eyelashes are first sewn in, to lift the
eyelids suddenly and then drop them in that fascinating
way, but you will soon get used to it.
“Dolly.”—Yes, I can give you the broad classic brow
and deeply set eyes you admire so much. Write for my
Head-widener, Brow-developer, and Eye-pusher-in (the set
complete 35s. 6d.).
“Mrs. H.”—Nothing easier than to turn your short thick
throat into a long slender one. Fasten a pair of my delight-
ful little Throat-corsets (£1 1s. per pair) round your throat
and lace them as tight as you can bear it. You must, of
course, be satisfied with only a moderate amount of breath,
and only take liquid food while wearing the Throat-corsets.
“DAisy.”—So glad to hear that since using my Beautaline
Cream (8s. 11d. per jar) your programme has been full
directly you enter the room at the Tootwich Fortnightlies.
“Nobody's PET.”—For the chronic frown you must have
a set of my Beautaline Brow-irons. Heat them and pass
them across the puckered brow. For the turned-down
corners of the mouth I will send you a set of Mouth-clamps
which will give the rosebud shape so much desired. Cheer
up! You will soon change “No” for “Some" in your mom
de plume.
“Topsy.”—I am glad to say I do not often receive such
a letter as yours. Of course I shall not refund the money,
for which you have had such splendid value ! You say the
treatment has made you “much uglier." Judging from
your original photo, I should say that was quite impossible!
“GRANNY.”—Not at all. I take quite as much interest
in my older Friends as in my younger ones. A client of
about your age whose relations, a year ago, were trying to
get her into an almshouse, but who fortunately came to me
instead, has just written, asking me to her wedding with a
young nobleman in his twenties! I should advise you to
have the Sweet-seventeen treatment (inclusive charge
£10 10s.). There's not the least fear of your not surviving it!

[Now that the struggle in the Near East
appears to be drawing to a close, the public
will be interested in the following graphic
description of the work of preparing a great
daily paper during the earlier stages of the
War. Written by one who has no professional
connection with any newspaper office, it will
be found not only free from technical jargon,
but unhampered by the excessive modesty so
characteristic of the press.]
IN a room at St. Martin's-le-Grand
the wheel of a little brass machine
begins to spin and to reel off a narrow
ribbon of blue paper. A War Special
from Buda-Pesth, viſi St. Petersburg, is
coming in.
Trembling with excitement, but
methodical from force of habit, the
operator tears off a length from the
tape, lays it face downwards, applies a
layer of adhesive paste, and deftly sticks
it on a foreign telegram form. Emotion
has made him nearly inarticulate, and
as he hands the form to an attendant
he can say no more... than “Battle !

gether with a supreme effort, he wipes
the paste from his fingers and prepares
to tear off another strip of tape.
The attendant pushes the form into
an envelope, speeds out of the room and
down a long corridor, clearing a kneel-
ing charwoman with a single bound,
and thrusts the envelope into a pneu-
matic tube by which it is shot swiftly
into the heart of newspaper land.
There, in a large untidy room, lined
from floor to ceiling with books of re-
ference and littered a foot deep with
proof-sheets, a group of sub-editors sit
in a row playing idly with blue pencils
—pale, clean-shaven men, with hawk-
like eyes and lean quivering fingers.
Suddenly the one nearest the door
snatches the envelope from a breathless
messenger and tears out the all-im-
portant telegram. “Buda-Pesth, vid
St. Petersburg. A great battle is being
fought at Tchretz,” he reads, and a
thrill like an electric wave runs from
end to end of the line of expectant men.

IIe. “FACT! HAD IT FIROM His own Lips. SAID HE of TEN DINEs AT HOME As MANY AS THREE OR Four: TIMEs A Most II.”
The blue pencil poises and hovers in the
air like a living thing, and then swoops
down unerringly. The message, as it
reaches the hands of the third sub-
editor, runs, “Buda-Pesth, rid St.
Petersburg. A terrific battle is being
fought at Tehretz (? Tchuctz).”
The third has a large map spread
before him and a powerful reading-glass
in his right hand. His face is an im-
penetrable mask as he bends over the
table, but presently it lights up in a flash
of triumph, to be succeeded a moment
later by an expression of dismay. There
is no Tchrytz or Tchuvtz in the Balkan
Peninsula, but he has found two
Tchivtzes, separated by some 300 miles!
The fourth, after a hurried consulta-
tion with the third, alters the u in

catches up the receiver of the telephone

WHY I WAS OSTRACISED.
(Interesting Interview with Aristides.)
A PAPYRUS recently discovered in
Egypt, and deciphered at the British
Museum, turns out to be a cutting from
the Athenian 'Astúp containing an inter-
view between a representative of that
journal and ARISTIDES immediately
after the announcement of the hostile
verdict of his fellow-citizens. By the
kindness of Sir F. G. KENYON, we are
enabled to lay before our readers a trans-
lation of this interesting document.
ARISTIDES, who appears to have been
quite unmoved by the result, attributed
his ostracism partly to his opposition
to the foreign policy of THEMISTOCLES,
but chiefly to the irritation produced by
his integrity and independence. “Ever
since I entered public life," he observed,
“my official relations with my Party
have been most unsatisfactory. The
first occasion was when I was ordered
by the Whip (Mágrik) to march into
a certain lobby, and was told that was
my lobby, when I asked what I was
voting for. I replied that it could not
be my lobby, as it was the property of
the State ; also, that I had never been
in the habit of taking orders of that
kind. The Whip replied by calling me
an execrable ass' (ovos Tappiapos). Since
then the jealousy and antagonism of
my colleagues have been acute and un-
remitting. The attitude of the official
party press towards me may be judged
by the fact that they have not hesitated

oDE TO AN INDOORS WARBLER.
OH thou who, when the skies are gray
And on the leafless boughs a-poise
No feathered songsters pipe their lay
(In point of fact, the other day
I chanced on some down Epping way
Making a rare old noise;
Still, for the purposes of song,
The woods are silent as my hat;
Old Winter with his frost-bound thong
Has cowed and crushed the feathery
throng;
This being clear, we'll get along)–
Oh thou who, calm and fat,
While all the woods without are stark,
Here in the genial house,
More glorious than the rising lark,
Verger of heaven's dome and clerk,
That strains the neck so much to mark
(Thus differing from the grouse),
More tuneful than the nightingale,
The blackbird or the thrush,
Or whatsoe'er wild poets pale,
Instructed by The Daily Mail
That Spring-tide flaunts it in the vale,
Go featly forth to flush;-
Ah, kettle! lutanist sans wings
Forth from thy lungs what rapture
springs!
What ecstasy' whilst Mary brings
The toastand buttered scones and things
That form my scant repast.
Thou warbler, from whose liquid throat
Such melodies emerge
As never a bard whom I can quote
Has dared to ape on lyre nor oat
Nor Pan-pipes [humorous—AUthon's
NotE],
So splendidly they surge;—
Herewith I hymn thee. Thou canst
slake
The feverish poet's care
And waft him to that Lethe-lake
By willows hemmed; come, let me take,
Ere thou canst boil, a piece of cake
And sit in yon arm-chair.
Sing on. I would not break thy thrall;
Thou carriest the mind
To sandwiches that softer fall
Than snowflakes on an Oread's pall,
And muffins dank. I take them all,
Though harmful to the wind.
Still onward let thy numbers flow:
With thee to Eden's gates,
With thee to far Cathay I go,
Thine is the cup that cheers our woe
But not inebriates.
Fled is that music. Do I rave or ramp?
No longer from thy spout
Strains of the Philomela stamp
Come eddying forth; the girl's a scamp!
She never fills the spirit-lamp;
The flame is going out! EvoB.

MORE SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
III.--THE MAGNATE.
IT was in October, 19— that the
word “Zinc "first began to be heard in
financial circles. City men, pushing
their dominoes regretfully away, and
murmuring “Zinc "in apologetic tones,
were back in their offices by three
o'clock, forgetting in their haste to
leave the usual twopence under the cup
for the waitress. Clubmen, glancing at
the tape on their way to the smoking-
room, said to their neighbours, “Zinc 's
moved a point, I see,” before covering
themselves up with The Times. In the
trains, returning husbands asked each
other loudly, “What's all this about
zinc 2"—all save the very innocent
ones, who whispered, “I say, what is
zinc exactly?”
it up. No sooner had the word “Zinc "
left the lips of an acknowledged
comedian than the house was in roars
of laughter. The furore at the Collodium
when Octavius Octo, in his world-
famous part of the landlady of a
boarding-house, remarked, “I know
why my ole man's solate. 'E's buying
zinc,” is still remembered in the bars
round Piccadilly.
+ -3- + 2: 2:
To explain it properly it will be
necessary (my readers will be alarmed
to hear) to go back some thirty
years. This, as a simple calculation
shows, takes us to June, 18–. It
was in June, 18— that Felix Moses, a
stout young man of attractive appear-
ance (if you care for that style), took
his courage in both hands, and told
Phyllida Sloan that he was worth ten
thousand a year and was changing his
name to Mountenay. Miss Sloan,
seeing that it was the beginning of a
proposal, said hastily that she was
changing hers to Abraham.
“You’re marrying Leo Abraham 2"
asked Felix in amazement. “Ah !”
A gust of jealousy swept over him. He
licked his lips. There was a danger-
ous look in his eyes—a look that was
destined in after days to make Emperors
and rival financiers quail. “Ah!” he
said softly. “Leo Abraham | I shall
not forget !”
-: 2: º: 2: 2:
And now it will be necessary (my
readers will be relieved to learn) to jump
forward some thirty years. This obvi-
ously takes us to September 19–. Let
us on this fine September morning
take a peep into “No. —, Throgneedle
Street, E.C.,” and see how the business
of the mother city is carried on.
On the fourth floor we come to the
sanctum of the great man himself.
“Mr. Felix Mountenay—No admit-
The music-halls took | . . .
It is a name which is known and feared
all over Europe. Mr. Mountenay's pri-
vate detective stands on one side of the
door; on the other side is Mr. Mounte-
nay's private wolf-hound. Murmuring
the word “Press,” however, we pass
hastily through, and find ourselves be-
fore Mr. Mountenay himself. Mr.
Mountenay is at work; let us watch
him through a typical five minutes.
For a moment he stands meditating
in the middle of the room. Kings
are tottering on their thrones. Empires
hang upon his nod. What will he
decide? Suddenly he blows a cloud of
smoke from his cigar, and rushes to the
telephone.
“Hallo! Is that you, Jones? . . .
What are Margarine Prefs. at? . .
What? . . . No, Margarine Prefs., idiot.
Ah! Then sell. Keep on selling
till I tell you to stop. . . . Yes." -
He hangs up the receiver. For two
minutes he paces the room, smoking
rapidly. He stops a moment . . . . but
it is only to remove his cigar-band,
which is in danger of burning. Then
he resumes his pacings. Another
minute goes rapidly by. He rushes to
the telephone again.
“Hallo! Is that you, Jones? . . .
What are Margarine Prefs. down to
now 2 . . . Ah! Then buy. Keep on
buying. . . . Yes.”
He hangs up the receiver. By this
master-stroke he has made a quarter
of a million. It may seem to you or
me an easy way of doing it. Ah, but
what, we must ask ourselves, of the
great brain that conceived the idea, the
foresight which told the exact moment
when to put it into action, the cool
courage which seized the moment—
what of the grasp of affairs, the know-
ledge of men 2 Ah! Can we grudge
it him that he earns a quarter of a
million more quickly than we do?
Yet Mr. Felix Mountenay is not
happy. When we have brought off a
coup for a hundred thousand even, we
smile gaily. Mr. Mountenay did not
smile. Fiercely he bit another inch off
his cigar, and muttered to himself.
The words were “Leo Abraham |

This is positively the last row of
stars. Let us take advantage of them
to jump forward another month. It
was October 1st, 19–. (If that was
a Sunday, then it was October 2nd.
Anyhow, it was October.)
Mr. Felix Mountenay was sleeping in
his office. For once that iron brain
relaxed. He had made a little over three
million in the last month and the strain
was too much for him. But a knock
at the door restored him instantly to
“I beg your pardon, Sir,” said his
secretary, “but somebody is selling
zinc.”
The word “Zinc "touched a chord in
Mr. Mountenay's brain which had lain
dormant for years. Zinc Why did
zinc remind him of Leo Abraham 2
“Fetch the Encyclopædia Britannica,
quick!” he cried.
The secretary, a man of herculean
build, returned with some of it. With
the luck which proverbially attends
rich men, Mr. Mountenay picked up
the “Z” volume at once. As he read
the Zinc article it all came back to
him. Leo Abraham had owned an
empty zinc-mine! Was his enemy in
his clutches at last 2
“Buy I "he said briefly.
In a fortnight the secretary had
returned.
“Well,” said Mr. Mountenay, “have
you bought all the zinc there is 2"
“Yes, Sir,” said the secretary. “And
a lot that there isn't,” he added.
“Good ' " He paused a moment.
“When Mr. Leo Abraham calls,” he
added grimly, “show him up at once."
It was a month later that a hag-
gard man climbed the stairs of No. —,
Throgneedle Street, and was shown
into Mr. Mountenay's room.
“Well,” said the financier softly,
“what can I do for you?”
“I want some zinc,” said Leo Aber-
gavenny.
“Zinc,” said Mr. Mountenay with a
smile, “is a million pounds a ton. Or
an acre, or a gallon, or however you
prefer to buy it,” he added humorously.
Leo went white.
“You wish to ruin me 2"
“I do. A promise I made to your
wife some years ago.”
“My wife?” cried Leo. “What do
you mean? I'm not married.”
It was Mr. Mountenay's turn to go
white. He went it.
“Not married? But Miss Sloan—"
Mr. Leo Abergavenny sat down and
mopped his face.
“I don't know what you mean,” he
said. “I asked Miss Sloan to marry
me, and told her I was changing my
name to Abergavenny. And she said
that she was changing hers to Moses.
Naturally I thought—”
“Stop!” cried Mr. Mountenay. He
sat down heavily. Something seemed
to have gone out of his life; in a moment
the world was empty. He looked up
at his old rival, and forced a laugh.
“Well, well,” he said; “she deceived
us both. Let us drink to our lucky
escape.” He rang the bell. -
“And then,” he said in a purring
voice, “we can have a little talk
about zinc. After all, business is still

WHY I WAS OSTRACISED.
(Interesting Interview with Aristides.)
A PAPYRUs recently discovered in
Egypt, and deciphered at the British
Museum, turns out to be a cutting from
the Athenian 'Agrip containing an inter-
view between a representative of that
journal and ARISTIDEs immediately
after the announcement of the hostile
verdict of his fellow-citizens. By the
kindness of Sir F. G. KENYon, we are
enabled to lay before our readers a trans-
lation of this interesting document.
ARISTIDEs, who appears to have been
quite unmoved by the result, attributed
his ostracism partly to his opposition
to the foreign policy of THEMISTOCLEs,
but chiefly to the irritation produced by
his integrity and independence. “Ever
since I entered public life,” he observed,
“my official relations with my Party
have been most unsatisfactory. The
first occasion was when I was ordered
by the Whip (Máarić) to march into
a certain lobby, and was told that was
my lobby, when I asked what I was
voting for. I replied that it could not
be my lobby, as it was the property of
the State; also, that I had never been
in the habit of taking orders of that
kind. The Whip replied by calling me
an “execrable ass’ (Gwos trappiapos). Since
then the jealousy and antagonism of
my colleagues have been acute and un-
remitting. The attitude of the official
party press towards me may be judged
by the fact that they have not hesitated
to accuse me of dilatation of the cranium
(otönua requMºs), and have endeavoured
to excite odium against me on the
score of my side-whiskers.”
Asked if he were down-hearted, ARIs-
TIDEs replied: “Oix jugul [apparently
a cant phrase of the day], ARISTIDEs is
all right. In the first place, this ostra-
cism was not enforced on me. Ivolun-
tarily proposed it as a means of testing
my popularity and securing a mandate
for those measures in which I am
specially interested. If the vote had
gone in my favour, my position would
have been unassailable. THEMis-
Tocles would almost certainly have
had to resign. As it is I am most
favourably circumstanced. I cannot
accept the vote as a representative or
conclusive indication of the views of
the democracy, and for various reasons
I demand a recount of the oyster shells.
To begin with, a number of those cast
against me were broken and therefore
invalid. Again, it was not clearly
stated before the voting that oysters
with contents might not be used, and
the disallowing of a number of such
oysters (including several with full
beards) which were recorded in my

Patient Host (after repeated thumps from below). “I say, old chAP, THE TUNNEL IDEA
IS ALL RIGHT, BUT I THINK You 'LL FIND THIS IS THE QUICKEST way. To THE club-House !"
Again, I have reason to believe that on
previous occasions “natives' were always
allowed to count double, but this rule
was also disregarded. Thus I have not
only the consciousness of innocence,
but contempt for the morality and
mentality of my enemies, my associates,
and my colleagues to sustain me in my
temporary absence from politics. From
this point of view my ostracism is not
a defeat but a triumph. It ministers
to my self-respect and to that of those
who say with me, &ewov to 65Mu. I was
defeated because I was too just to suc-
ceed. The result spells no disgrace for
ARISTIDEs; on the contrary, it spells
my eternal honour. My name from
this hour becomes world-wide as the
champion of freedom.” -

ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.
“Round AND Round ENGAGED IN THE PROCESs of LEGISLATION."
House of Lords, Monday, November
25.-The SPEAKER, whose patience
through waste of time and temper that
habitually marks Question hour is mar-
vellous, feeling necessity of drawing
the line somewhere, expressed opinion
earlier in the Session that eight ques-
tions placed upon the paper for a single
sitting were enough for any able-bodied

does not seem niggardly.

found upon notice paper no fewer
than forty-eight questions standing in
PortsMoUTH's name ! A Longer Cate-

bare the secret places of the Territorial

Characteristic of catholicity of mind
of a Statesman who has in succession
sat on both sides of the House that
PortsMoUTH did not address his in-
terrogations to a particular Minister.
He rose “to ask His MAJESTY's Govern-
ment the following questions.” It was
for them to settle among themselves
who should be put forward to make
whatever halting excuse was possible
for the abject state of things indicated
in the Catechism. On one matter he
was, however, imperative.
“I must,” he said, “insist upon
having categorical reply to each ques-
tion.”
Never since stacking his musket,
unbuckling his sword, he quitted the
War Office for the Woolsack, did
HALDANE so greatly rejoice. But for
fallen to his lot to face the ordeal pre-
pared by the military expert, who, tossing
back his auburn locks and fixing stern
gaze on Ministerial bench, awaited
reply. HERSCHELL, comparatively
young, superlatively innocent, was
gently pushed to the front from Minis-
terial Bench. Had been provided with
sheets of foolscap, on which were type-
written answers to the Catechism. Not
to be lured beyond their limits. Fearing
that forty-eight questions might not
supply sufficient material for Ministerial
cogitation, PortsMoUTH supplemented
them by a speech in which he suggested
that “the Territorial Force is merely a
sort of sop thrown to a stupid political
antagonist.”
There was nothing on HERSCHELL's
paper about this. Accordingly dismissed
it with remark that he “would not follow
the noble Earl into that matter.” Then
he read his answers and, no one show-
ing disposition to join in conversation,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
House of Commons, Tuesday.-For
two hours and a quarter by Westminster
clock an average of four hundred and
fifty gentlemen of various ages and
various weights walked round and
round the Lobbies engaged in process
of legislation.
“I know now,” said KINLoCH-Cook E,
upon whose massive mind new light is
ever falling, “why the word begins
with the syllable leg.' We do not
discuss Bills; we walk them into
shape.” -
Hitherto work of guillotine accom-
plished at single stroke delivered at
specified hour. Difference to - night
arose consequent upon certain amend-
ments moved from Treasury Bench.
They were purely technical; in ordinary
business assembly would have been
accepted without comment, leaving nine
quarters of an hour for discussion of
vital questions arising upon clauses.
But we are not an ordinary
business assembly; so round and
round the Lobbies we toddled.
There was not even attraction
of possibility of damaging
Government by snap division.
At close of each promenade—
“prolonged pedestrian exercise"
was Mr. CRA1G's portentously
polite way of putting it–
Government majority was
steadily maintained over the
generous margin of 100.
Incidentally a new word
added to strictly limited cata-
logue of authorised Parliamen-
tary expressions. GoLDSMITH-
not The Traveller—moving an
amendment, prefaced his remarks
by prolonged disquisition on shortness
of time allotted for discussion. Verbatim
report of what immediately followed
affords glimpse of lofty style of current
debate.
Voice from Below Gangway opposite:
“Hurry up.”
GENERAL CARSoN, K.C. (always
effective in retort): “Hurry up your-
selves.”
Captain SNoDGRAss CRAIG (his coat
still on): “We have only a few minutes
and you keep on shouting like a lot of
jackals.”
Probably had the gallant Captain
used the word “jackasses” CHAIRMAN
would have interposed and sternly
ordered withdrawal of offensive word.
“Jackals" affords almost as much
relief to justly aggravated mind and
has advantage of enjoying tacit ap-
proval of the Chair.
Perambulatory performance lasting
from half-past seven up to approach to
ten o'clock liberally covered dinner-hour.
Attempts to snatch a meal led to
obstruction the late Mr. Joseph G.ILLIs
BIGGAR developed pleasing habit
designed to impose the greatest incon-
venience upon the largest number.
Loitering about dining-room he noted
precise moment when majority of
Members were halfway through a
course of hot meat. Straightway re-
turning to House, he moved a count,
compelling loyal Ministerialists to for-
sake their food and rush off to “make
a Hºuse.”
To-night there were a dozen such
interruptions, lengthened by process of
division. At successive summons of the
bell Members hurried off even as they
raised to expectant mouth the friendly
fork or the soothing spoon.
Business done.—By discriminating
and intelligent perambulation of the
Division Lobbies seven clauses added
to Home Rule Bill.

Thereupon announcement audibly

cELLOR sharply inquired, “Are they
in the same condition as you received
them in 2''
“They are,” said their custodian, by
way of precaution taking another look
at the papers. --
“Then hand ’em in,” said the LorºD
CHANCELLOR decisively. -
This was done, and straightway
Ireland's wrongs were further redressed
by possession of a new champion of
her national aspirations.
Business done.—Commons engaged

establishment Bill. Sat up all night
over it. -
A PERFECT CURE.
I.
A striKE was threatened—
and a strike meant ruin
Eric Goodman, the young
manager of the great iron-works,
leant over the senior partner as
he sat at his desk, and breathed
earnestly on the back of his
head. But when the inflexible
old man sat up and made faces
and thumped the ledger Eric
knew that further argument
would be useless. He backed
to the door, he gave one frenzied
glance at the ceiling cornice,
and vanished from the room.
Outside, the senior partner's
daughter Mary—taking advan-
tage of the gardener's temporary ab-
sence—was gathering all the tall tiger- ||
lilies in the garden. With a sheaf of |
them in her arm and her bat hanging
by its libands, she pirouetted suddenly
and faced young Eric Goodman in coy
surprise.
She had a nice profile, and the hand
she laid imploringly on the young
fellow's arm was white and shapely.
But Eric had been drilled to play a
manly part. No turning back for him
—no dalliance beyond a light kiss on
her finger-tips; then, raising his Trilby
hat, he went to face the storm.
II.
The high gates of the works sundered
and forty inſuriated men rushed out.
Black Bill was the ringleader—Black
Bill, who disdained to wear a waistcoat
and who had not shaved for quite three
days. Undaunted by these proofs of
the man's innate brutality, Eric Good-
man held his head high—yet not so
high, unfortunately, but that Black
Bill could reach it with a hammer.

The next moment Mary, rid of her
lilies and languors, came upon the
scene and stooped over the prostrate
man and felt for his heart. No-yes,

III.
They put him to bed in the senior
partner's drawing-room, to the evident
distress of the butler, who was further
mortified by having to hold a pudding-
basin. Into this Mary gingerly dipped
a handkerchief and bound it round the
unconscious man's head.
And then he came—the Doctor: a
man, you would judge, cool almost
to the point of exasperation. He put
a black bag on a chair, he slowly peeled
off his gloves, he smiled a slightly
amused smile. Then he touched the
improvised bandage with his forefinger.
Yes, that was right as far as it went,
but it was not enough.
There was a moment of strained ex-
pectancy, and the Doctor firmly opened
his bag. That done, he sat down and
“If he opens his eyes in two minutes
he will live.” That was the verdict.
It was the crisis. . . . .
The dread period of suspense began.
The senior partner tried to hide his
manly emotion and a loyal workman
wept unaffectedly into the bend of his
à l'In.
Mary clasped her hands, peaked her
pretty eyebrows, and stared straight be-
fore her, her lips moving. Could he save
him 2 He would do what trained skill
could do, at all events. No one, seeing
his calmly imperturbable face, could
doubt his confidence in the Open Bag
treatment. It had cured so many
others; why should it fail with Eric 2
So he held on devotedly to his
patient's wrist as the slow seconds
ticked away, till the last was registered.
“Time!” There was a stir in the
bed. Punctual to the moment, Eric
opened his eyes. The crisis was past !
Then the good doctor rose and gently
shut his bag.
Without medicaments, without carv-
ing-knives or things, he had made one
more lightning cure. Even the butler
seemed favourably impressed.
And now for a timely suggestion:
work the Act, let the British Medical
Association take heed. Even though the
Faculty fails us the resources of civiliza-
tion are not yet exhausted. Certainly,
no one would grudge licking stamps to
secure the services of that matchless if
slightly unorthodox healer of men—

“It is,” said Francesca; “most important.”
“And you want to be certain of finding it again?”
“I do.”
“Then why not put it in your pocket?"
“My pocket?” said Francesca.
“Yes,” I said, “your pocket. Swing your left hand

Now screw your body to the left, at the same time dropping
your head and shoulders until your forehead comes in contact
with your heels. You now command your pocket and

Ten years hence you will make an incautious movement, and

“No,” said Francesca, “I cannot bear to wait so long.”
“In that case,” I said, “let us mingle our tears at once
and have done with it.”
“And if you have no better suggestion to make,” said
Francesca, “pray let me think this question out for myself.”
“No, Francesca,” I said, “I will not. I have another

Lady. “THE MAN WITH THE GREY HAIR, TALRING TO THOSE LADIES OVER THERE.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE ELDEST SON.”
THE first obvious criticism that
everyone has to make on Mr. John
GALsworthy's play is to note its
resemblance to the motive of Hindle
Wakes. But it is only a very super-
ficial resemblance. For Mr. STANLEY
HoughtoN's scheme was a quite simple
matter. On the one hand we had the
hard morality of the boy's father; on the
other the cold defiant indifference of
the girl (practically in the same rank of
life) who declined the remedy for what
she would not admit to be a wrong.
Mr. GALsworthy's scheme is much
more complex. There is not only the
social contrast ; we have one tradition
clashing with another—the tradition of
caste with the tradition of honour;
there is common sense at work and a
knowledge of life, and there is also
a recognition of the pitifulness of
things. Hindle Wakes was a serious
comedy. The Eldest Son only just
stops short of tragedy. There is further

Youth. “I KNow Yog ARE, THAT's why I AskED You As I THOUGHT You 'D BE sunk. To RNow.”
father's attitude to his son's case, and
his judgment on an identical offence
committed by one of his servants.
In this last matter the resemblance
to certain circumstances in Mr. SoMER-
SET MAUGHAM's Grace is more unfor-
tunate. But it would never occur to
anybody acquainted with Mr. GALS-
worthy's genius to question his honesty.
His play was begun many years ago.
The sense of reality (a very different
thing from realism) produced by The
Eldest Son is so amazing that it is only
the impressiveness of some of the
entrances and exits that reminds us
that it is drama and not actual life that
we are looking at. Only once does the
author come under suspicion of having
studied his effect. It is when, at the
opening, he poses Freda at the bottom
of the stairs where all the family and
guests must pass on their way to
dinner. A maid would more naturally
have gone upstairs to deliver her
flowers. Perhaps, too, there is just
a suggestion of something theatrical
in the head-keeper's behaviour when
daughter. But if any theatrical quality
might be expected it would be here;
indeed, it serves a purpose as a contrast
to the restraint of better breeding.
The author owed almost as much to
his cast as they to him. I am inclined
to give the best of my gratitude to the
performance of Miss IRENE RookE as
Lady Cheshire, so exquisitely gracious
was she in voice and movement
and expression. But Mr. EDMUND
MAURice's presentation of Sir William
Cheshire was scarcely less fine; for he
was given more subtle work than is
commonly demanded of a bluff hunt-
ing squire; and he had to do most of
it in pink. Mr. GUY RATHBONE as
Bill, their eldest son, did not give so
strong a suggestion of race; but he
seldom had a chance of holding up his
head. Yet he was courageous, and pre-
served what dignity was possible, and
above all he was sincere. The Freda of
Miss CATHLEEN NESBITT was a very
pathetic figure. Never self-assertive,
she showed the great gift of being able
to keep quite still with the action of


the irony of the contrast between the

WILLIAM FARREN's finished art found
no terrors in the rôle of the head-keeper,
and he used all his chances.
Of the others, Miss ELLEN O'MALLEY
seemed rather too consciously enig-
matic; but the rest were extraordinarily
true to the easy atmosphere of a
country-house. The test came, of
course, when they were asked to cope
with a sudden upheaval of their calm;
and they bore themselves as gentlefolk
should.
I must particularly compliment Miss
IRENE McLEod as the hoyden Dot,
who had no more use for girlish
illusions. Her appalling frankness
was a healthy corrective to the uni-
versal strain. Indeed, the author was
generous beyond his wont in the
matter of humorous relief. One may
add that his selection of Caste as the
subject of the rehearsal-scene was a
very happy touch of irony.
In conclusion, I thank Mr. GALS-
worTHY and his company most sincerely
| for as good a show as I ever want
to see. It has made me amends for
much that I have borne fretfully this
year. As usual, of course, he offers no

“WHERE THERE's A WILL–’
IF you cannot think of a plot for
your play, a good one can always be
got out of a Will, Sealed Document or
Sliding Panel. For his four-Act farce
Mr. BERNARD PARRY selects a Will.
He also selects a bedroom scene —
I believe on purpose to please me.
I thank him. One of these evenings
I shall rise from my stall, and saying,
“That reminds me,” go home to bed.
However, boredom did not lead me
to desert the Criterion, for Mr. PARRY
was often amusing in the Great Bedroom
Act. Moreover, Miss DoRothy MINTo
was on the stage at the beginning of
it, and might conceivably return at any
moment. Miss MINTo has a person-
ality; it is one which I, anyhow, find
irresistible. If she cannot always be
in SHAw plays, we must take her where
we can find her. She made the part
of Dolly Graham delightful; I don't
think there would have been much in
it otherwise.
But Mr. PARRY's greatest mistake
was not in failing to keep away from
Act farce as if it were what he calls it
—a comedy. A farce is not a farce
solely by reason of its knock-about
business, nor is it, therefore, capable of
becoming a comedy by an omission of
such business. It can only become a
comedy if it shows us real people,
behaving naturally. I am sure Mr.
PARRY would never claim this for his
play, for he must know that he has
not attempted to delineate real people.
Every one of his characters is a ready-
made “stock-size,” such as has done
duty in a hundred different plays. No
harm in this if he will announce the
result as a farce and see that it is

played as a farce. Indeed, it might
well become a very funny and successful
farce. But it is hopeless to expect us
to be interested in the serious troubles
and emotions of people in whom we
cannot believe. Such people may only
amuseus. If Mr. PARRY would recognise
this and refuse to take them seriously
himself, he might yet do something
with his idea, even though it turns
upon a Will.
I wish very much that the Criterion
could get hold of a real play. May I
suggest that the management should
begin by fixing the idea in their minds
that this is the year 1912? M.

from personal observation the facts contained in An Account
of the Norwegian Antarctic Erpedition in the “Fram,”
1911–1912, by Roald AMUNDSEN. Still, after reading
that account, I feel that I have as good as been there. I
started with an indefinite sense of duty, the duty of every
man who is a man and not content to stew in his own
juice of informing himself of an enterprise so important
and intrepid. I finished with a sense of excitement and
intense cold. I had sailed in the Fram across the Southern
oceans and especially Ross Sea; I had clambered on to
the Great Barrier and spent whole months in camp there;
I had driven on a sledge, behind splendid scoundrels of dogs,
over Mount Don Pedro Christophersen, the Devil's Ball
Room and the Plateau, from 80° to 85°, from 85° to 88°,
from 88° to 89°, and from 89° to-hats off, gentlemen!—90°!
And not once in the course of my going had I fallen or
nearly fallen into the crevasse of boredom or even got lost in
a fog of technical expressions.
Never in a book of travel have I been made to feel so
intimately in the movement, and rarely have I met a traveller
who wielded so nimble a pen. I cannot find terms for my
admiration of AMUNDSEN, and especially of his laughing
modesty; he is full of enthusiasm for the achievement, but
every word of his praise goes to his dashing men. I recipro-

has shown throughout and congratulate him most heartily

story of MURAT and his predecessor on the Throne of Naples;
of the retreat from Moscow of the Grand Army; of MoLTRE's
boyhood, and of what Mrs. FRASER airily calls “the
Schleswig-Holstein riddle.” These historic epochs were
before my time. But if Mrs. FRASER's “Reminiscences” are
not more accurate than her account of an event that took

columns of a certain paper containing the text of the all-
momentous Treaty. M 's defence was that the docu-
ment had been purloined from his desk in his absence.”
The mysterious “M ” was a Mr. MARVIN, temporarily
engaged at the Foreign Office at the munificent rate of
tenpence an hour. What really happened was that, called
into his chief's private room on some immaterial business,
his eye alighted on the draft of the Treaty lying open on
the desk. Whilst his unsuspecting chief conversed, he
memorized the document and sold his MS. to The Globe,
not now nor then a paper London would find on its break-
fast table unless it came down to the meal about mid-day.
Where Mrs. FRASER's recollections are personal, as in the
account of her visit to her brother at Sorrento, and in her
chat about her sojourn in Chili, she writes with charm.
When her book receives the merited honour of a call for
a second edition there will be opportunity of relieving it
of a considerable surplusage. It will be a smaller volume,
but increasingly attractive.

is a novel; moreover, it is
one of some merit. Never-
theless I have failed to
free myself of the impres-
sion that. Mr. BEGBIE is
somewhere aloft teaching
me a lesson, and rubbing
in his moral for all he
(and it) is worth. But
when I have confessed
that his sentimentality left me untouched, I have made an end
of my complaints. For Mr. BEGBIE has done sound work in
reproducing the atmosphere of thirteenth-century France;
and many readers, I doubt not, will be moved by Gaspard's
renunciation of worldly success and happiness, so that
through weal (of which there was a scarcity) and woe he
might do his mother's bidding. That his loyalty failed to
move me is partly due to an inherent dislike for novels in
which joy is overwhelmingly crushed by sorrow.

THE CATCH.
I was busy with the usual scene in
the House, marmalade and toast, when
Doris exclaimed, “The silly creatures!”
“You are quite right,” I replied. “I
don't know whether I object more to
the measures of the Government or the
manners of the Opposition.”
“I wasn't talking about your ab-
surd Parliament,” said Doris contemp-
tuously. “What can you expect from
an assembly without women? They
him to send some one to put the electric
bells right. He promised to send a
man at once. Ten days since that is.
This is just about the time Hitcham
would send.”
She stared wildly at me. A sound
resembling a snore came from the
cupboard.
“It is an innocent workman,” I
said. “The way he sleeps proves
that.” - -
“What are we to do?”
“Look 'ere, Mister, I'm a British
subjeck, I am.”
“That,” I said sternly, “does not
justify you in coming and sleeping in
my cupboard under the pretence of
adjusting electric bells.”
“Look 'ere, she locked me in.”
“And now you are trying to put the
blame upon a lady. Enough of this.
Get to your work, and don't dare to use
my cupboard as a bedroom again.”
“But I tell you she-"
“Let him out, I suppose. You don't

“It’s a police-court case.
Here's a man who's got access
to ninety-five different houses
under pretence of examining the
electric fittings, and stolen jewel-
lery from every one of them.”
“How very easily women are
imposed upon " I commented.
Dora flushed. “I’ll bet all
the ninety-five were Antis,” she
said. “I should like to see the
man who could impose on me.”
“So should I,” I answered.
“I cannot flatter myself that I
ever did.”
When I returned for lunch a
hysterical Doris rushed from
the flat and wept upon my
shoulder.
“Not Uncle John?” I cried,

WHY I WON.
Interview with P. ScipIO AFRICANUS.
Last week we gave a brief account of
the ARISTIDES papyrus newly acquired
by the British Museum. That institu-
tion has now been enriched by another
IA
document of extraordinary interest, re-
cently found in the Catacombs. It con-
sists of a copy of the Vesper Purpureus,
the famous Roman newspaper published
during the Second Punic war, containing
an interview with P. Scipio AFRICANUS
after the battle of Zama, in which
HANNIBAL was completely defeated by
the Roman General. The interview is
not only deeply interesting for the
details which it gives of the conflict,
but it involves a complete revision of
the traditional verdict of history on the
crowning exploit of the Roman General.
The true organizer of victory, it now
turns out, was not Scipio, but that
wonderful Roman journalist, Ampulla
Sesquipedalis, the Editor of the Vesper
Purpurcus, who is alluded to in CICERO's
Letters as a writer of “ almost incredible
exuberance.”
SCIPIO, who was resting in his tent
after the exertions of the fight, had
given orders that no one should be
admitted, but, hearing that the repre-
sentative of the Vesper was outside, at
once commanded him to be brought in,
and embraced him with the utmost
fervour. · Let there be no mistake

I was busy with the usual scene in
the House, marmalade and toast, when
Doris exclaimed, “The silly creatures!”
“You are quite right,” I replied. “I
don't know whether I object more to

“I wasn't talking about your ab-

would send.”
She stared wildly at me. A sound
resembling a snore came from the
cupboard.
“It is an innocent workman,” I
said. “The way he sleeps proves
that.” -
“What are we to do?”
“Let him out, I suppose. You don't
“Look 'ere, Mister, I'm a British

“That,” I said sternly, “does not
justify you in coming and sleeping in
my cupboard under the pretence of
adjusting electric bells.”
“Look 'ere, she locked me in.”
“And now you are trying to put the
blame upon a lady. Enough of this.
Get to your work, and don't dare to use
my cupboard as a bedroom again.”
“But I tell you she-"
“I don't want to know what you
would introduce an element
of quiet refinement—”
“My dear,” I interrupted—

let us talk about Mrs. DRUM-
MoRD. What made you exclaim,
‘The silly creatures' 2"
“It’s a police-court case.
Here's a man who's got access
to ninety-five different houses
under pretence of examining the
electric fittings, and stolen jewel-
lery from every one of them.”
“How very easily women are
imposed upon " I commented.
Dora flushed. “I’ll bet all
the ninety-five were Antis,” she
said. “I should like to see the
man who could impose on me.”
“So should I,” I answered.
“I cannot flatter myself that I
ever did.”
When I returned for lunch a
hysterical Doris rushed from
the flat and wept upon my
shoulder.
“Not Uncle John?” I cried,
thinking naturally of our wealth-
iest relative.
“No, the man in the flat.
It's Ellen's monthly day out,
and I was all alone when he
came at eleven o'clock and said
he'd come to look at the electric
fittings. I asked him where
he came from, and he said
‘Hitcham's.' You see they watch
where we deal to have a story
ready. I knew he was lying,
so I took him to the cupboard where
the electricity meter is and, while he
was looking round, pushed him in
and locked the door. Then I piled
furniture against it. He used awful
language, but now he's pretending to
| be asleep. I daren't leave the flat for
fear he should burst the door and
escape. And the bell for the hall-
porter won't ring, and the flat below's
empty. So I had to wait till you
came.”
“You’re a plucky woman,” I de-
clared admiringly, but even as I said it
an awful thought came to me.

The puzzled toiler proceeded
with his work of adjusting the
electric bells whilst Doris em-

“How splendid of you!" she
said.
“You taught me,” I replied.
“I taught you!”
“Yes, whenever you make a
mess of things you always prove
that I'm in the wrong.”
“Do you think Hitcham will

I stared at her. There is a

WHY I WON.
Interview with P. SCIPIO AFRICANUs.
LAST week we gave a brief account of
the ARISTIDEs papyrus newly acquired
by the British Museum. That institu-
tion has now been enriched by another
document of extraordinary interest, re-
cently found in the Catacombs. It con-
sists of a copy of the Vesper Purpureus,
the famous Roman newspaper published
during the Second Punic war, containing
an interview with P. Scipio AFRICANUs
after the battle of Zama, in which
HANNIBAL was completely defeated by
the Roman General. The interview is
not only deeply interesting for the
details which it gives of the conflict,
but it involves a complete revision of
the traditional verdict of history on the
crowning exploit of the Roman General.
The true organizer of victory, it now
turns out, was not Scipio, but that
wonderful Roman journalist, Ampulla
Sesquipedalis, the Editor of the Vesper
Purpureus, who is alluded to in CICERo's
Letters as a writer of “almost incredible
exuberance.”
ScIPIo, who was resting in his tent
after the exertions of the fight, had
given orders that no one should be
admitted, but, hearing that the repre-
sentative of the Vesper was outside, at
once commanded him to be brought in,
and embraced him with the utmost
fervour. “Let there be no mistake
about it,” he cried, “this is not my
victory; I have only been the humble
instrument of the mighty genius of
Ampulla. It was he who inspired my
strategy, inflamed the spirits of my
soldiers, and created an atmosphere of
confidence which made Rome irresisti-
ble. The pen is mightier than the
sword, the epithet more formidable than
the elephant, the polysyllable more de-
structive than the catapult.'
SCIPIo then went on to explain that it
was at the suggestion of Ampullahimself
that he had given orders to his standard-
bearers to wave copies of the Vesper
in the faces of the foe, and that the
wonderful efflatus proceeding from these
purpurei panni had produced a curiously
disintegrating effect even upon HANNI-
BAL's most seasoned veterans. As for
the elephants, they absolutely refused to
stand up against them, and turned and
fled in abject confusion. As a Cartha-
ginian prisoner picturesquely put it,
they had not only been out-generalled;
they had been out-trumpeted. But
perhaps the greatest compliment of all
was that which came from HANNIBAL
himself. The famous General, it appears,
though escape was easy, risked capture
by waiting to dictate a letter to his con-
queror, in which all his characteristic

“From the day,” he wrote, “on

camp, I knew that the game was up. It
contained an article headed “O si /

triumph on the strength of the joint

Incredible as it may seem, Scipio flatly

the Senate, he actually refused to allow

MORE SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
IV.--THE DOCTOR.
His slippered feet stretched out lux-
uriously to the fire, Dr. Venables, of
Mudford, lay back in his arm-chair
and gave himself up to the delights of
his Flor di Cabajo, No. 2, a box of
which had been presented to him by an
apparently grateful patient. It had
been a busy day. He had prescribed
more than half-a-dozen hot milk-
puddings and a dozen changes of air;
he had promised a score of times to
look in again to-morrow; and the
Widow Nixey had told him yet again,
but at greater length than before, her
private opinion of doctors.
Sometimes Gordon Venables won-
dered whether it was only for this that
he had been the most notable student
of his year at St. Bartholomew's. His
brilliance, indeed, had caused some-
thing of a sensation in medical circles,
and a remarkable career had been
prophesied for him. It was Wenables
who had broken up one Suffrage meet-
| ing after another by throwing white
mice at the women on the platform ;
who day after day had paraded London
dressed in the costume of a brown dog,
until arrested forbiting an anti-vivisector
in the leg. No wonder that all the
prizes of the profession were announced
to be within his grasp, and that when
he buried himself in the little country
town of Mudford he was thought to have
thrown away recklessly opportunities
such as were granted to few.
He had been in Mudford for five
years now. An occasional paper in
The Lancet on “The Recurrence of
Anthro-philomelitis in Earth-worms,”
kept him in touch with modern medi-
cal thought, but he could not help
feeling that to some extent his powers
were rusting in Mudford. As the
years went on his chance of Harley
Street dwindled.
“Come in,” he said in answer to a
knock at the door.
The housekeeper's head appeared.
“There's been an accident, Sir,” she
gasped. “Gentleman run over !”
He snatched up his stethoscope and,
without even waiting to enquire where
the accident was, hurried into the night.
Something whispered to him that his
chance had come.
After a quarter of an hour he stopped
a small boy.
“Hallo, Johnny,” he said breathlessly,
“where's the accident ?”
The boy looked at him with open
mouth for some moments. Then he
had an idea.
“Why, it's Doctor!” he said.
Dr. Wenables pushed him aside and
It was in the High Street that the
accident had happened. Lord Lair, an
eccentric old gentleman who sometimes
walked when he might have driven,
had, while dodging a motor-car, been
run into by a child's hoop. He lay
now on the pavement surrounded by
a large and interested crowd.
“Look out,” shouted somebody from
the outskirts; “here comes Doctor.”
Dr. Venables pushed his way through
to his patient. His long search for the
scene of the accident had exhausted him
bodily, but his mind was as clear as ever.
“Stand back there,” he said in an
authoritative voice. Then, taking out
his stethoscope, he made a rapid
examination of his patient.
“Incised wound in the tibia,” he
murmured to himself. “Slight abrasion
of the patella and contusion of the left
ankle. The injuries are serious but not
necessarily mortal. Who is he?”
The butcher, who had been sitting
on the head of the fallen man, got up
and disclosed the features of Lord Lair.
Dr. Venables staggered back.
“His lordship !” he cried. “He is a
patient of Dr. Scott's I have attended |
the client of another practitioner
Professionally I am ruined ' "
Lord Lair, who was now breathing
more easily, opened his eyes.
“Take me home,” he groaned.
Dr. Venables' situation was a terrible
one. Medical etiquette demanded his
immediate retirement from the case,
but the promptings of humanity, and
the thought of his client's important
position in the world, were too strong
for him. Throwing his scruples to the
winds, he assisted the aged peer on
to a hastily-improvised stretcher and
accompanied him to the Hall.
His lordship once in bed, the doctor
examined him again. It was obvious
immediately that there was only one
hope of saving the patient's life. An
injection of anthro-philomelitis must be
given without loss of time.
Dr. Venables took off his coat and
rolled up his sleeves. He never travelled
without a small bottle of this serum in
his waistcoat pocket—a serum which, as
my readers know, is prepared from the
earth-worm, in whose body |.
large deposits of anthro-philomelitis are
continually found. With help from a
footman in holding down the patient,
the injection was made. In less than a
year Lord Lair was restored to health.
+: +: + : s:
Dr. Gordon Venables' case came before
the British Medical Council early in
October. The counts in the indictment
were two.
The first was that, “on the 17th of
June last, Dr. Gordon Venables did fel-
commit the disgusting and infamous
crime of attending professionally the
client of another practitioner.”
The second was that “in the course of
rendering professional services to the
said client, Dr. Venables did knowingly
and wittingly employ the assistance of
one who was not a properly registered
medical man, to wit, Thomas Bolling,
footman, thereby showing himself to be
a scurvy fellow of infamous morals.”
Dr. Venables decided to apologise.
He also decided to send in an account
to Lord Lair for two hundred and fifty
guineas. He justified this to himself
mainly on the ground that, according to
a letter in that week's Lancet, the supply
of anthro-philomelitis in earth-worms
was suddenly giving out, and that it was
necessary to recoup himself for the
generous quantity he had injected into
Naturally, also, he felt that
his lordship, as the author of the whole
trouble, owed him something.
The Council, in consideration of his
apology, dismissed the first count. On
the second count, however, they struck
him off the register.
It was a terrible position for a young
doctor to be in, but Gordon Venables
faced it like a man. With Lord Lair's
fee in his pocket he came to town and
took a house in Harley Street. When
he had paid the first quarter's rent and
the first instalment on the hired furni-
ture, he had fifty pounds left.
Ten pounds he spent on embossed
stationery.
Forty pounds he spent on postage-
stamps.
For the next three months no journal
was complete without a letter from
999, Harley Street, signed “Gordon
Venables,” in which the iniquity of his
treatment by the British Medical
Council was dwelt upon with the fer-
vour of a man who knew his subject
thoroughly; no such letter was com-
plete without a side-reference to anthro.
philomelitis (as found, happily, in earth-
worms) and the anthro-philomelitis
treatment (as recommended by peers).

Venables had been utterly unknown to

time it was better known even than

MUSICAL NOTES.
THE announcement that Madame
CLARA BUTT has declined an offer to
sing at one of the leading music-halls
at a remuneration of £250 a week has
elicited a number of interesting state-
ments from leading musicians, illus-
trating in pleasing fashion the heights
to which artistic self-denial can attain
in these days of acquisitive materialism.
Thus it will be no surprise to the
admirers of Robert Knaus to learn
that he recently refused an offer from
one of the greatest Sausage Kings
in Chicago. It was that he should
compose a symphonic poem giving a
realistic description of the entire process
of manufacture, the only condition
imposed being that the analytic pro-
gramme should mention the name of
the magnate and include a photograph
of his factory.
The fee offered being only £500, Herr
Knaus's answer, which was conveyed
in terms of noble indignation, was of
course a foregone conclusion.
Perhaps the most notable of these
revelations is that which reaches us
from Sir Pompey Boldero, F.R.S.L. “I
writes the famous publicist, “that when
my son-in-law, Mr. Max Bamberger,
was touring in New Guinea he was
approached by the chief of the famous
anthropophagous tribe of the Fifoſumi,
who offered him a nugget of gold, esti-
mated at £5,000, if he would accompany
them in a head-hunting expedition into
the interior, and inspire the warriors by
the strains of his violin. Needless to
say, Mr. Bamberger declined the offer,
and the impression created by his noble
behaviour was such that cannibalism
has since fallen into disrepute through-
out the length and breadth of Papua.
I ought to add that I am writing entirely
on my own initiative, Mr. Bamberger
being notoriously averse from any public
advertisement of his actions.”
Another splendid act of renunciation
is that of the famous Suffragist soprano,
Miss Sylvia Dark, who was offered a
series of engagements in the provinces,
but, when she discovered that it involved
an appearance in the Isle of Man, at
once declined the engagement as casting
an intolerable stigma on her reputation.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRAcTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Decem-
ber 2–At Dotheboys Hall there was
no Christmas vacation. Announced
to-night that we shall have ten days.
Following upon what with brief interval
has been a year's regular attendance
at Westminster the arrangement cannot
be censured on ground of excessive
liberality. Present Session will almost
overlap that of 1913, giving us another
seven or eight months' unintermitted
hard labour.
PREMIER's remark, that House ad-
journing on 20th of this month will
turn to again on the 30th brought
anguished wail from Scotch Member.
“Is the right honourable gentleman
aware how Scotsmen usually spend the
first week of the New Year?" asked
Mr. WATT, who knows his Glasgow
well. “Does he think it a fair sub-
stitute to bring us here?"
Well, we must do our best to rise to
occasion. Scotland has not monopoly
of currency of the whisky bottle, and
there are great doings in neighbour-
hood of St. Paul's on last night of
parting year.
It happened by accidental concatena-

score of Members sit and languidly
listen to one on his legs.
To-night Cousin Hugh, rising to
address scanty audience, bitterly de-
plored state of things. TIM HEALY,
unflinchingly constant in attendance,
offered explanation.
“What takes the life out of these
debates, Mr. WHITLEY,” he said ad-
dressing the long-suffering Chairman,
“is the obvious fact that gentlemen on
this side of the House"—it need hardly
be said that TIM ranges himself on
Opposition Benches—“are all reading
from briefs. What they say is cut
and dried for them like horse-fodder.

printed form what is mostly nonsense.
This is photographed and circulated

not debate. It is absurdity.”
If this be not true it is well invented.

condition of House. Gooseberry blight

Wednesday. — ToM TAYLOR — how
familiar the name sounds in connec-
tion with these pages—is already disil-
lusioned. Less than a fortnight since he
arrived from Bolton beaming with plea-
sure at prospect of enjoying privilege and
distinction of the M.P. Finds
brought sharply to mind. Mr.
WATT hymned the sorrows of
Scotsmen compelled to “see the
New Year in " in London.
Ireland and Wales each had its
grievance. Spokesman of the
former was Mr. GINNELL, who
drew lurid picture of CHIEF
SECRETARY and accomplices
taking advantage of count-out
last Friday “at a time when the
Irish Government were being
charged with complicity in crime
in Dublin Castle.” Another
Member pointed out how Wales,
still unrelieved from cost of
maintaining Established Church,
had suffered fresh affront by the
regimental goat of the Welsh
Fusiliers being placed in quar-
antine in vague affright at spread
of Foot and Mouth Disease.

he moans. “What d'you think?
Once inside they won't let me

This a sad reminiscence of

House of Lords, Thursday. —
Noble Lords habitually distinguished
from meaner mortals in another place
by imperturbability. “I never eat and
I never drink,” said Dizzy's Cardinal,
pictured in Lothair. Lords rarely laugh
and seldom cheer. Commons always
childishly anxious to find opportunity
for either exercise. -
This peculiarity made more marked
what the French call mouvement dis-
played just now when WILLOUGHBY
DE BROKE strolled in. Affairs of state
occupying him elsewhere, this his first
appearance since delivery of famous
speech at Unionist gathering in Albert
Hall.
“I am out for blood,” he then con-
fided to a cheering audience. “We
are not going to go home without it
if we have to stop out all night to
get it.”
Several nights elapsed since this
inspiring declaration was trumpeted.
Presumably WILLough BY, in accordance
with his public pledge, has been on the
prowl through them all. Had he suc-
ceeded in the enterprise? Had he
“got it"?
Some noble Lords were conscious of
vague picture, hung somewhere, on the
back of their minds, of WILLOUGHBY,
having prospered in his nocturnal enter-
prise, entering from behind the Wool-
sack, a gory knife in one hand, in the
other a pail half-filled with the proceeds
of his labour. Nothing could be further
removed from realised fact. WIL-

Perhaps, after all, this talk about

But he should remember that what is

THE EIGHTPENNY BIT.
IT begins to look as if yet another way
has been found in which the Insurance
Act may wreck our happiness. There
is to be a famine in copper coins. This
is how it works. In the old days—the
dear old days—if you employed a man
who earned 30/- a week, you simply
handed over to him, when Saturday
came round, the sum of thirty bob (in
gold)—and there you were. But now,
thanks to the National Health Insur-
ance Act, he has to get 29/8, which is
a much more vexatious problem. This
sort of thing is already throwing a
frightful strain on our copper currency,
so that it is freely predicted (with the
Christmas shopping coming on, and all)
that there are bound to be too few
pennies to go round.
We are not sure of the soundness of
the argument. We cannot quite bring
ourselves to believe that that loose two-
pence (the recognised equivalent of half-
a-pint) will be long lost to the world.
But let that pass. We are told that
the difficulty must be met, and we are
quite prepared to meet it. A happy
and daring solution has already been
found. We are to have an Eightpenny
Bit. The idea has been taken up with
much enthusiasm, and there is certainly
this in it (though we should be sorry to
encourage gambling in any form)—that
if you do begin to toss with a penny
and lose, and then lose thrice more,
neither a shilling nor a sixpence meets
the case whereas an Eightpenny Bit
does. The Press, however, points out,
most pertinently, that there is one
almost iºi, objection to a new
coin so like in size to a sixpence. “On
cold and dark nights on the tops of cars ”
mistakes will occur. That objection,
however, may be easily merged in the
larger problem of the proper lighting
and heating of the tops of our
CarS.
Still we do not altogether
care about this Eightpenny Bit.
While it will, no doubt, relieve
copper, it is bound to throw
a fearful strain on silver. We
would suggest a bolder and a
simpler course. Why not have
a Nine-and-eightpenny Bit 2 Or,
even better, a Twenty-nine-and-
eightpenny Bit 2
As a matter of fact we have a
better solution still. It is indeed
what we have been working up
to. All wages are not paid at
the rate of thirty shillings a
week. No, we had not overlooked
that. Very well, we shall have a Six-
and-eightpenny bit. This will not only
(1) relieve this intolerable strain on
copper, (2) mitigate the evil opera-
tions of the Insurance Act, (3)
prevent all sorts of awkward contre-
temps on the tops of cars on cold and
dark nights; it will also (we suppose
you have already guessed it) come in for
paying one's lawyer's fees. It will get
round the difficulty of that exceedingly
—well, untidy amount that they de-
mand for any little service they may do
you. Which of us has not experienced
a most unpleasant five minutes while
he has fumbled and hunted feverishly in
his various pockets, on the very door-
step, trying to make up the total? In
future we, for our part, will have the
fee ready inside our glove, where we
keep our postage-stamps.
We only throw out the suggestion
for what it is worth—as they always
say when it happens to be a particularly
rotten one—but there is this to be said
for it. It will do for two birds at once
—the “publican " and the solicitor.

THE BRAVEST DEED.
It was in the Club, and they were telling stories of danger
and of high adventure, of perils by land and air and sea,
from wild animals and wilder men; and presently one of
them asked an old scarred general to tell the tale of how
he had won tho Victoria Cross.
But the old man shook his head smilingly.
“That was more luck and opportunity than anything
else,” he said. “I’ll tell you the coolest thing I ever saw,
though. A man I knew in India once followed up a wounded
tiger, armed with nothing but a riding-whip. . The beast
was dead when he found it, as things turned out, but imagine
the fellow's nerve.”
“A cool customer, certainly,” agreed an old Police official;
“but what do you think of a man presiding at a meeting of
Anarchists assembled to plan his own assassination? I've
known that done.”
[Editor: Isn't this just like a hundred magazine stories

AUTHoR: Glad you think so.
a parody of them.
EDITOR: Oh, I beg pardon ||
The talk went on, and each present told of the bravest,
most reckless deed he had ever known. Presently a famous
lawyer, who was sitting in a corner and had hitherto taken
no part in the conversation, interposed.
“Talking about bravery,” he said, “do any of you happen
to know who that man is sitting in the arm-chair by the
window 2"
They looked round with interest, for there had been a
note of reverence, almost of awe, in the lawyer's voice, and
they knew he was a man not easily moved.
“Do you mean the insignificant-looking little man with
white hair reading the paper?" someone asked. “What
about him?”
“Looks rather young to have such snowy hair," observed
another, a famous airman. “Something in the City?”
The lawyer smiled impressively.
“Yes,” he said, “I mean that commonplace, insignifi-
cant-looking person who appears to be merely an ordinary
I thought you might like
| plain man of business, ‘something in the City,' to use the
| general expression.
Well, you were talking of the bravest
deeds you have ever known. That man, when he was
younger, did a thing that, for sheer audacity, for cool, calm,
| reckless devilment, matches, I think, anything I have
heard to-night—or in my life, for that matter. And I know
| that he did it, for I was there and I saw the whole thing
from beginning to end.”
“What was it?” they asked.
“Well, some people said it was simply an attempt at
suicide,” the lawyer answered, “and certainly it was mad
and rash in the extreme. I do not consider it was a
| thing any man ought to have attempted. Still, he sur-
vived, though how, I do not know—nor does he himself.
And I can tell you another thing,” continued the lawyer
deliberately, taking evident pleasure in deferring the
| satisfaction of our curiosity, “his hair that morning
was black as the raven's wing.
| you see it now—white as the driven snow on an Alpine
In the evening it was as
peak.”
“I have heard of that happening,” observed the old
general, “though I have never known a case. It must have
been a pretty bad experience; yet can it have been worse
than some of the things we have heard about to-night?”
“As to that,” answered the lawyer, “you shall judge
for yourself.”
He lifted one hand with a gesture unconsciously
“That man, as you see him there,” he said slowly,
“one day in the autumn of 1912, arrived at the Blackfriars
District Railway Station. From there he wished to
reach the north side of the Embankment. What do you
suppose he did? The press of traffic was at its height,
but without pause or hesitation or visible tremor, ignoring
the subway and heedless of the warning cries we uttered,
he—crossed the road.”
|N DYNASTY MING.
[“The Earthly Paradise: Ming Dynasty.”—British Museum.]
THE poets have ever been servitors dutiful
Of everything pleasant and everything beautiful;
From Helen of Troy to a handful of roses
They've pondered their plots and poetical poses;
So I make no excuse for this thesis I bring—
The Eden on earth of the Dynasty MING ! - :
I am bound to admit you may never have heard of it,
I hadn't myself, not a chance spoken word of it,
Till I happened to-day in that grave athenaeum,
The manuscript-room of the British Museum,
And hit on—they're doubtful who painted the thing—
This haven of peace in the Dynasty MING !
It's a garden, of course, and it's painted enchantingly
With dear little ladies whose eyes go up slantingly,
Whose dear little faces are fresh as a blossom ;
There's a baby as cute as a baby opossum
(Yes, baby opossums that clamber and cling
Are just like the baby in Dynasty MING !).
In the foreground a portly and jolly Chinee party
Is giving a kind of an afternoon tea-party
To a god and a goddess, at least so one guesses,
For an acolyte zephyr with slavish caresses
Showers down every petal that's known to the Spring;
They did themselves proudly in Dynasty MING !
Such flowers and profusion Ah well, 'twas the Flowery
Land
(How pleasant it sounds in this chilly and showery land!);
Just think of the lawns and the lisp of the fountains,
And the blue in the distance of pine-covered mountains,
And the graceful white cranes—mark the bold sweep of
wing
Of the one just alighting in Dynasty MING !
'Tis captious, perhaps, still a critic may criticise
Any point in a picture that doesn't quite fit his eyes;
And the best Chinese Edens should surely achieve dogs,
The fubsy companions of kings known as sleeve-dogs;
One or two for the baby brought home from Peking
The critic had asked for in Dynasty MING !
For he means, when the fogs in sulphureous fumes bury
The chill London chimneys, if passing through Blooms-
bury
To call for five minutes of phantom and fancy,
And charm of red lacquer, pagoda and pansy,
And dream, in some valley where nightingales sing,
That the garden still blows as in Dynasty MING!
There the gods still shall come, spite of Time and his
rim sickle,
Where the dear little ladies look flowerlike and whimsical,
And the jolly old mandarin sits at his table
And eats all the nice little cakes that he's able;
And there the fat baby shall clamber and cling
dramatic. The silence was tense as he spoke.
As it did in the days of the Dynasty MING!

PUNCH, OR

THE LONDON CHAR
THE ROOT OF THE MATTER.
THERE was once a man named Cas-
well. About the same time there was
a man named Pacton. These two got
up against each other about a tort.
What had really happened was that
Caswell's motor car, having made a
series of bloodthirsty but abortive at-
tempts on the life of Pacton, had
eventually, by waiting up a side street
and dashing out suddenly at breakneck
speed, succeeded in knocking Pacton
down. True, it hadn't killed
him, but no doubt it hoped for
better luck next time.
What had really happened
was that Pacton had taken a
malicious dislike to Caswell's
motor and had purposely pre-
cipitated himself against it
when it was standing still. But
for Caswell's readiness in re-
ceding Pacton might have done
his car a very serious injury.
Hence Pacton v. Caswell ;
after the institution of which
suit the individualities of Cas-
well and Pacton sank into rela-
tive insignificance.
On the morning of the Assizes,
at which the cause was to be
tried, the Caswellians, solicitors,
experts and other camp-fol-
lowers marched into the Shire
Hall of the Assize town, led
by their counsel, Jones. His
smile was bold and his head
was high. . He had reason to
hold his head high and to smile
boldly, for the other fellow
hadn't a leg to stand on.
From another direction ad-
vanced the Pactonites, solicitors,
experts and other hangers - on,
headed by Smith, their counsel.
Smith said nothing, but his
expression was darkly confident.
He had good cause to wear such
an expression, for the other
fellow hadn't a leg to stand on. 'T'
Say what you like to the discredit of
litigation, there is always that charm-
ing fact about the other fellow; whether
he stands or not, he has never a leg to
stand on. -
The Jury returned a verdict for
Pacton, with damages. Jones there-
upon left that town for London with
his tail between his legs.
And Smith's tail?
That might have been goodness
knows where but that he met two of
the jurymen on the station as he was
waiting for his train.
“Ah,” he said to them, with the most
pleasant condescension, “that was a
very proper verdict of yours. I found
appreciative a jury. Now, I wonder
which of my points particularly appealed
to you? I fancy you rather liked the
one about the wheelmarks.”
The jurors did not remember anything
of his point about the wheelmarks nor,
when he revived it for their benefit, did
they show any great affection for it.
He revived all his points and the jurors
were quite distinct in stating that they
didn't see anything in any of them.
Smith was a little depressed. Then

EDITH WHARton's new novel, The Reef (MACMILLAN), is
a brilliant and remorseless analysis of the processes of a
tragic estrangement that falls between Darrow, a young
American diplomatist, and Anna Leath, a young widow
who is an old friend. The friendship is resumed on the
death of Anna's husband, and broken off by the discovery
of a brief entanglement of Darrow's with a Sophie Winer, in
whose company he has accidentally been thrown during
a temporary estrangement from Anna, and whom he after-
wards meets as governess to her daughter. Owen Leath,
the step-son, who becomes secretly engaged to Sophie,
completes the essential quartette of characters. On this
perhaps somewhat too elaborate but very skilfully developed
complication Mrs. WHARTON exercises her rare gifts of
observation and discernment, of patient analysis, of artistic
reticence, and of felicitous distinction of style. The fine
irony of the situation is that one's sympathies slip away
from Anna, for all her exquisitely feminine qualities and
generous ideals, because she, sheltered and unsullied, is,
in the end, too uncomprehending for the great love it is
her nature to need and to desire, and drives her lover into
inevitable mazes of deceit. When discovery comes and he
is able to make and she unable to understand or accept his
real defences, it is his self-respect and dignity that are
restored, and it is Anna who goes to pieces, irresolute,
sentimental, éssentially a coward. Sophie, the charming,
pathetic, honest little governess, is a very vivid and notable
fragrant, sympathetic. It is the author of The House of
Mirth at her best, and that best has long ago placed her
in the small front rank of contemporary novelists.
. I don't know whether it is because Mr. Joseph CoNRAD
has something of the Russian novelists' method, or because
he is not a mere amateur of his theme, that his spell is so
potent; but the fact remains that he seems to be able to
spin a yarn which has all the “unsatisfactoriness” of real
life, and invest it at the same time with the artistic qualities
that one looks for in romance. There are plenty of writers
who “go down to the sea in ships,” but is there one of them,
except Mr. CoNRAD, who would have harboured a naked
swimmer—a man who had committed murder on another
vessel—for days and days in his cabin, and concealed the
fact from his mates and his crew, and then let him quietly
slip overboard again, with the chance of getting to land, and
never hear another word about the fellow again? This is
the plot of the second of the three stories that make up
Betwict Land and Sea (DENT); and the first, which is called
“A Smile of Fortune,” is even more weirdly inconclusive.
It tells how a skipper, waiting for his cargo at an island
called The Pearl, made the acquaintance of a strange,
vixenish half-caste girl who had been shut up all her life in
the garden and house of a trader, with only an eccentric
aunt for company. It tells how, for no reason at all (for she
was not very nice to him), he fell in love with her and then
she suddenly fancied him, and he fell out of love again at
once, and got his cargo of tomatoes on board and sailed
away. But there is something haunting and strange about

THE ROOT OF THE MATTER.
THERE was once a man named Cas-
well. About the same time there was
a man named Pacton. These two got
up against each other about a tort.
What had really happened was that
Caswell's motor car, having made a
series of bloodthirsty but abortive at-
tempts on the life of Pacton, had
eventually, by waiting up a side street
and dashing out suddenly at breakneck
speed, succeeded in knocking Pacton
down. True, it hadn't killed
appreciative a jury. Now, I wonder
which of my points particularly appealed
to you? I fancy you rather liked the
one about the wheelmarks.”
The jurors did not remember anything
of his point about the wheelmarks nor,
when he revived it for their benefit, did
they show any great affection for it.
He revived all his points and the jurors
were quite distinct in stating that they
didn't see anything in any of them.
Smith was a little depressed. Then
it must be something about the defen-

him, but no doubt it hoped for
better luck next time.
What had really happened
was that Pacton had taken a
malicious dislike to Caswell's
motor and had purposely pre-
cipitated himself against it
when it was standing still. But
for Caswell's readiness in re-
ceding Pacton might have done
his car a very serious injury.
Hence Pacton v. Caswell ;
after the institution of which
suit the individualities of Cas-
well and Pacton sank into rela-
tive insignificance.
On the morning of the Assizes,
at which the cause was to be
tried, the Caswellians, solicitors,
experts and other camp-fol-
lowers marched into the Shire
Hall of the Assize town, led
by their counsel, Jones. His
smile was bold and his head
was high. . He had reason to
hold his head high and to smile
boldly, for the other fellow
hadn't a leg to stand on.
From another direction ad-
vanced the Pactonites, solicitors,
experts and other hangers-on,
headed by Smith, their counsel.
Smith said nothing, but his
expression was darkly confident.

third yarn is called “Freya of the Seven Seas,” and is less
episodic; it is the tale of a brig which was the apple of a
man's eye and was deliberately wrecked because a Dutch
lieutenant was the captain's rival in love. But this yarn,
too, is spun of the same good stuff, and, in short, I want
no better pilot between two green covers than Mr. Joseph
CoNRAD.
I like The June Lady (CoNSTABLE)—that is to say, I like
the lady herself. But I don't so much care for the story
of her Golden Month, as told by Mr. R. E. VERNEDE. He
takes the number nine (the sum-total of the house-party,
including the hostess), subtracts two (already man and
wife), adds three (not staying in the house), and, by halving
the result, triumphantly rings down the curtain on five
completed or prospective marriages. It is like the last Act
of Hamlet, with engaged couples substituted for corpses.
No doubt, given a fine June and a houseful of idle young
people bent, in deference to the wishes of their sovereign
hostess, on reviving for a month the golden age of
chivalrous and romantic adventure, a fair amount of amorous
sport was to be expected.
untimely end owing to disputes at rehearsal; but there are
others, and they include a kind of semi-amateur entertain-
ment, put on experimentally in the West End, that runs
for years. Thus even Miss FILIPPI cannot resist enriching
her heroine in the end. There is another part of the tale
that is not concerned with the theatre, but with Christian
Science and other matters. This, though naturally less
amusing, is as clear and persuasive a plea on a debated
subject as any I have read. Miss FILIPPI, in short, has
produced quite an interesting study in two themes.
The inmates whom Mr. A. D. GoDLEY has brought
together in The Casual Ward (SMITH, ELDER) possess
attractions not often found in connection with such an
institution. Mr. GoDLEY (if I may drop the metaphor to
which his title invites me) continues the Oxford tradition—
he himself had no small share in its definite establishment
—of combining classical learning with light-hearted per-
siflage. He is a Don and, for aught I know, may employ
some part of his precarious leisure in controlling the studies
and disciplining the frivolity of undergraduates. Yet there
is no man living who ex-

us what T H U CYD IDEs

HERODOTUs described a

The Father of History,
it appears, had no high
opinion of such races.
He thought it foolish “to
dig trenches and build
other ramparts parallel
indeed to each other, but
transversely to the run-
ning of the horses them-
selves,” so that “whoever

in order to bring the car to a stand-still. And then, with
destruction waiting for them at the bottom of the hill,
he conceived the truly brilliant idea of steering it into
a large flat field, with the intention of driving round and
round till the petrol was exhausted. The incident is slightly
artificial, but it is redeemed by the humour of its telling.
I rather fancy that when Miss Rosin A FILIPPI set out to
write Bernardine (DUckworth) she may have had some
idea in her mind of correcting the usual type of stage novel,
in which authors with no first-hand experience of the sub-
ject represent their heroines as springing at one bound to
affluence and fame. In pursuance of this plan she lets her
Bernardine (though she is the wife of the author of the new
play, and has herself attended by appointment in order to
be interviewed with regard to playing the chief part) be
flatly refused admittance by the commissionaire at the stage
door. This is an incident that sounds so incredible that
I (who happen to know my theatre) have not the slightest
doubt it actually happened. However, Bernardine does
eventually get inside, and what follows serves to introduce
some highly entertaining scenes of stage life, as also some
portraits of the dwellers therein which are not only en-
tertaining and easy to identify, but even (I must add)
on which sitting he set out, and not it running, having left
him behind, nor he himself on foot, he is considered to have
conquered.” In verse as well as in prose Mr. GoDLEY has a
very pretty wit. I like particularly his “Hints for the
Transaction of Public Business,” which begins by layin
down the principle that “the less there is to talk about, the
more there is to say,” and advises an orator not to argue
with the Chair, but “to state the things you might have
said—unless he'd ruled it thus.” “The Pupil's Point of
View” is another pleasant piece—though I think I ought
to protest against “dunces” as a proper rhyme for “stunts
us.”
The National Physique.
“Captain Barrett and Mr. Bignell would not be available next
season, having gone broad.”—Standard.
They might get somebody to run for them.
“Those letters contained a statement to the effect that the Crown
‘lays no claim to lumbago found in lands sold by it prior to 1901,
anything in the wording of the Crown grant to the contrary not-

statement as curing the infirmity in the plaintiff's title.”—Times.
The point is whether it cured the infirmity in the plaintiff's
back. As far as we are concerned, the Crown can have our

“Nor have I,” he replied, “but Antonio knows me.”

grimacing in our wake. º -
“But this is wonderful,” I said, when we got outside.
“We will always dine here. How on earth do you do it?”
“As for always dining here,” said Pottygrew, “that is
another matter. I don't think we shall ever come here again.
Only the direst necessity dragged me hither to-night.”
“You have taken too much wine,” I said. “The St.
Estéphe has been too much for you. You get a good dinner
for nothing, and you say you will never go there again.
Do not speak like this, I beg of you; it is hardly reverent.”
“Cecil,” he replied solemnly (he only calls me Cecil when
ſhe is deeply moved, and it isn't really my name, but he
thinks it is),-" Cecil, you know my family is one of the

“Well, it is. We are mentioned, unfavourably it is true,
and in connection with cattle-maiming, but still mentioned
in Domesday Book. Always and everywhere we have held
our heads high. Elias Pottygrew was mate on the Victory—
or was it the Revenge 2 ; Timothy was an army contractor
under Charles II.; Benjamin dabbled in the South Sea
Bubble, and Paul once proposed to a lady-in-waiting. But
we fell on evil days. My grandfather became a solicitor.”
Pottygrew paused, his whole frame quivering with
emotion. -
“This is a very long story 2 " I said.
“It is a very sad story,” he replied. -
“ Unfortunately my poor grandfather was not what the
world calls an honest solicitor. A friend on whose affec-

prison my father endeavoured to carry on the firm. He
did his best, but circumstances were against him — the

“I've never heard you mention it before,” I said.
“We met him often,” Pottygrew proceeded, “at our club,

he said that a good chef was a finer artist than VELAsquez;
his monuments, he declared, were more lasting than brass.
Next morning my brother had disappeared.” ‘. .
“I don't see the connection,” I said. . . .
“Nor did I at the time,” Pottygrew went on; “but, after
searching in vain for several months, I came here. Cecil,
my poor brother was, he is, Antonio the chef.” -
“But Antonio 's an Italian.” . . . -
“No more Italian than yonder organ-grinder,” said
Pottygrew; “born and bred in Camberwell. He has
nothing to do with the dinners, he doesn't know a sausage
from a péche Melba. He runs the place, he stands at the
door and gives the foreign touch which Englishmen love
and so few foreigners can give. It's all manner; Andrew
always had a manner.” - - - -
Pottygrew's emotion was too much for him. I seized
him by the arm and drew him toward The Cod and

“A drink will revive you,” I said.
Pottygrew examined his pockets, shook his head and
turned slowly away.
“I have no more brothers,” he said.

APOLLO.
I MET Apollo face to face, some four years ago, at a
country-house party in Leicestershire. It was on the
second day after Christmas, a very fine bright day for the
time of year. There were many children in the house,
several of them belonging to our host and hostess, and to
please them our host had on this particular afternoon pro-
vided a Punch and Judy show, “one of the real old-
fashioned sort,” as he put it, “plenty of rooti-too-it, dog
Toby, and all the rest of it.” There were to be two per-
formances, one for us and the children (including those of
the immediate neighbourhood) in the early afternoon, and
another for the servants in the evening. It was at the first
of these that I saw Apollo.
I have always loved a Punch and Judy show. The
directness and ferocity
accepted a biscuit, ate half of it, and with an air of guilty
cunning conveyed the rest to a distant bush and buried it.
Then with a muddy nose he came back and barked huskily
for more.
“Yes, Sir,” said the showman, “he’s a nice dawg. Ibred
him myself. His father and mother was both in the
profession. This little chap was one of a litter of five, and
I kept him because he had such bold ways; and when he
was only four months old I used to give him Punch to play
with, and he'd set atop of him growling like mad and
worrying his face and tossing him up and trying to ketch
him, and running races round him and taking him off when
he thought I wasn't looking, and trying to bury him.
‘That there dawg,' I says to myself, ‘is made for the show;"
and I was right. He got most of his natural gifts from his
mother. When she had her litter of puppies it almost
broke her heart not to

succession of infamous
and jovially executed
crimes and the swift
completeness of the
nemesis fascinate me
now as they did when
I was a child, and in
watching this tremend-
ous drama I can forget
appointments of the
most sacred and punc-
tual character. Toby,
too, is a delight to me.
About every Toby that
I have ever seen there
is a noble and almost
haughty melancholy, as
of one who, made by
nature to shine in the
throng of the gay and
careless, has been forced

opportunity. . Accordingly, when Punch had duly paid
the penalty of his atrocities and the rapturous show was
over, I stayed behind to have a few minutes of conver-
sation with the showman, while his assistant restored
the properties to their box and made all snug. Toby,
relieved of his frill, the degrading badge of servitude, was
rolling on the grass, investigating bushes, squaring up to a
stray spaniel, scraping up the turf, and, in fact, behaving
as if the weight of no drama had ever rested on his
shoulders. He was a short and sturdy dog with one
dependent ear and the other rakishly cocked. Partly, no
doubt, he was a smooth-haired fox terrier, but there were
plain indications of many other breeds about him. Rough-
haired terriers, bull terriers, and Scotch terriers and others
had all combined at one moment or another to promote his
existence and diversify his looks and his colour. Intelli-
gence and affection shone from his brown eyes; and his
stumpy tail, now that he was no longer official, wagged
it didn't pay, and we had
to smuggle the dawg home in a hamper so as he shouldn't
go to quarantine. He'd have pined away there without
the show. You look at him, Sir. Don't he seem to be
saying he's a gentleman in private life? Well, so he is,
and his private name's Apoller. A gentleman give it him
because, he said, Apoller was the god of song, and this
dawg can strike a tune better than most. You heard him
when Punch tried to give him a wipe over the head.
“No, he ain't an old dawg; rising six is his ticket, and
he's got plenty of years before him. So long as him and
me is together there'll always be bed and board for him,
and if he sees me out there's Joe here to take him on and
keep the show going. But you and me ain't going to be
parted yet, are we, Apoller?” Apollo understood, for he
rose and rubbed his head on his master's hand and gave
him a grubby paw. That is how I met the god of song.

MoRE SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
i W.—THE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETOR.
THE great Hector Strong, lord of
ournalism and swayer of empires,
paced the floor of his luxurious apart-
ment with bowed head, his corrugated
countenance furrowed with lines of
nxiety. He had just returned from a
lunch with all his favourite advertisers
. . . but it was not this which troubled
him. He was thinking out a new
policy for The Daily Vane.
| Suddenly he remembered something.
Coming up to town in his third motor
he had glanced through the nineteen
periodicals which his house had pub-
lished that morning, and in one case
had noted matter for serious criticism.
This was obviously the first business
he must deal with.
He seated himself at his desk and
pushed the bell marked “38.” In-
'stantly a footman presented himself
with a tray of sandwiches.
“What do you want?” said Strong
coldly. -
“You rang for me, Sir," replied the
trembling menial.
“Go away,” said Strong. Recog-
nising magnanimously, however, that
the mistake was his own, he pressed
bell “28.” In another moment the
editor of Sloppy Chunks was before him.
“In to-day's number,” said Strong,
as he toyed with a blue pencil, “you
apologise for a mistake in last week's
number.” He waited sternly.
“It was a very bad mistake, Sir, I'm
afraid. We did a great injustice to—”
“You know my rule,” said Strong.
“The mistake of last week I could have
overlooked. The apology of this week
is a more serious matter. You will ask
for a month's salary on your way out.”
He pressed a button and the editor
disappeared through the trap-door.
Alone again, Hector Strong thought
keenly for a moment. Then he pressed
bell “38.” Instantly a footman pre-
sented himself with a tray of sandwiches.
“What do you mean by this?” roared
Strong, his iron self-control for a
moment giving way.
“I b-beg your pardon, Sir,” stam-
mered the man. “I th—thought * >
“Get out 1 ''
Strong passed his hand across his fore-
head. “My memory is bad to-day,”
he murmured, and pushed bell “48.”
A tall thin man entered.
“Ah, good afternoon, Mr. Brown-
low,” said the Proprietor. He toyed
with his blue pencil. “Let me see,
which of our papers are under your
charge at the moment 2"
Mr. Brownlow reflected.
“Just now,” he said, “I am editing
As the footman retired,

Sermon and Back Chat.
“Ah! Well, I want you to take on
Sloppy Chunks too for a little while.
Mr. Symes has had to leave us.”
“Yes, Sir.” Mr. Brownlow bowed
and moved to the door.
“By the way,” Strong said, “your
last number of Slosh was very good.
Very good indeed. I congratulate you.
Good day.”
Left alone, Hector Strong, lord of
journalism and swayer of empires,
resumed his pacings. His two mis-
takes with the bell told him that he
was distinctly not himself this after-
noon. Was it only the need of a new
policy for The Vane which troubled
him 2 Or was it—
Could it be Lady Dorothy?
Lady Dorothy Neal was something
of an enigma to Hector Strong. He
was making more than a million pounds
a year, and yet she did not want to
marry him. Sometimes he wondered
if the woman were quite sane. Yet,
mad or sane, he loved her.
A secretary knocked and entered.
He waited submissively for half-an-
hour until the Proprietor looked up.
“Well ?”
“Lady Dorothy Neal would like to
see you for a moment, Sir.”
“Show her in.”
Lady Dorothy came in brightly.
“What nice-looking men you have
here,” she said. “Who is the one in
the blue waistcoat? He has curly hair.”
“You didn't come to talk about
him 2" said Hector reproachfully.
“I didn't come to talk to him really,
but if you keep me waiting half-an-
hour Why, what are you doing?”
Strong looked up from the note he
was writing. The tender lines had
gone from his face, and he had become
the stern man of action again.
“I am giving instructions that the
services of my commissionaire, hall-boy
and fifth secretary will no longer be
required.”
“Don't do that,” pleaded Dorothy.
Strong tore up the note and turned
to her. “What do you want of me?”
he asked.
She blushed and looked down. “I–I
have written a-a play,” she faltered.
He smiled indulgently. He did not
write plays himself, but he knew that
other people did.
“When does it come off 2" he asked.
“The manager says it will have to
come off at the end of the week. It
came on a week ago.”
“Well,” he smiled, “if people don't
want to go, I can't make them.”
“Yes, you can,” she said boldly.
He gave a start. His brain working
in an instant. At one stroke he could
win Lady Dorothy's gratitude, provide
The Daily Vane with a temporary
policy and give a convincing exhibition
of the power of his press.
“Oh, Mr. Strong x -
“Hector,” he whispered. As he rose
from his desk to go to her, he acci-
dentally pressed the button of the trap-
door. The next moment he was alone.
“That the British public is always
ready to welcome the advent of a clean
and wholesome home-grown play is
shown by the startling success of
Christina's Mistake, which is attract-
ing such crowds to The King's every
night.” So wrote The Daily Vane, and
continued in the same strain for a
column.
“Clubland is keenly exercised,”
wrote The Evening Vane, “over a
problem of etiquette which arises in
the Second Act of Christina's Mistake,
the great autumn success at The King's
Theatre. The point is shortly this.
Should a woman . . .” And so on.
“A pretty story is going the rounds,”
said Slosh, “anent that charming little
lady, Estelle Rito, who plays the part
of a governess in Christina's Mistake,
for which (“Manager” Barodo informs
me) advance booking up to Christmas
has already been taken. It seems that
Miss Rito, when shopping in the pur-
lieus of Bond Street . . .”
Sloppy Chunks had a joke which set
all the world laughing. It was called—
“BETWEEN THE ACTs.
Flossie. “Who's the lady in the box with
Mr. Johnson ?'
Gussie. ‘Hush | It's his wife " '
And Flossie giggled so much that she could
hardly listen to the last Act of Christina's
Mistake, which she had been looking forward
to for weeks' "
The Sunday Sermon offered free
tickets to a hundred unmarried subur-
ban girls, to which class Christina's
Mistake made a special religious appeal.
But they had to collect coupons first
for The Sunday Sermon.
The Times, of two months later,
said:
“A marriage has been arranged
between Lady Dorothy Neal, daughter
of the Earl of Skye, and the Hon.
Geoffrey Bollinger.”
s: º: + + +;
Than a successful revenge nothing
is sweeter in life. Hector Strong was
not the man to spare anyone who had
done him an injury. Yet I think his
method of revenging himself upon Lady
Dorothy savoured of the diabolical. He
printed a photograph of her in The
Daily Picture Gallery. It was headed
“The Beautiful Lady Dorothy Neal.”

DEAR Mr. PUNCH,-You have not
asked me for my views on diet and
longevity, but you have got to have
them all the same. My rule has been
simplicity itself—seven square meals
a day. I am now ninety-six years of
age, whereas, if I had stinted myself, I
should probably be years younger. Lord
Beever of Oxhoe, with whom I went
to school, also lives on seven meals
a day. Another famous advocate of
generous feeding was JENNER. He was
a great friend of mine, and used to say,
“If every man lived on seven meals a
day, no doctors would starve.”
When I was twelve years old my
father said, Would you like to go to
| Harrow or Eton ? I said Eton, because
I liked the sound of it. Those were
the good old days of hampers, and I
used to have one every week. My
nickname was Friar Tuck. At Cam-
bridge I entered Porterhouse College,
and won the Porterhouse Sweepstakes
My third wife, who was the widow
of a North American pemmican mer-
chant, brought me a small fortune and
I was able to retire from the Bar in
1850 and invest her money in a ruby
mine. She was a handsome woman,
and her portrait, painted by Sigismund
Toots, A.R.A., appeared in the Academy
in 1852. Yours irrelevantly,
WINDHAM BAGsHoT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, - Longevity is
incompatible with short commons. It
is a matter of liberal diet and long
drinks. If you drink nothing at meals
you can drink anything you like be-
tween them. Conversely, if you drink
nothing between meals, you can drink
anything you like at them. But the
wisest plan is to drink both at and
between meals. I need hardly say
that I am a teetotaler, but I find that
I can achieve variety by the following
regimen: 7.30 A.M. China tea; 8.45 A.M.
Indian tea; 11 A.M. (in summer) rasp-
berry vinegar; (in winter) ammoniated
quinine and ginger-ale; 1.30 P.M. lemon
squash; 4.30 P.M. Ceylon tea; 8 P.M.
botanic beer; 9 P.M. coffee; 11 P.M. (as
think I ought to mention that the
famous artist, Swinburne Coke, once
stopped me in the Strand and offered
to paint my portrait for Madame TUS-
SAUD's. Faithfully yours,
DESMOND FUSBY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Longevity is of
little value without economy. The true
secret of health is to be found in the
practice of the Snark. He frequently
took “breakfast at 5 o'clock tea and
dined on the following day.” I always
do, thus saving seven dinners a week,
or, estimating these at 3s. 6d. each—
the price of my club dinner—24s. 6d. a
week, or £63 14s. a year. As I am
now ninety-two and have followed this
rule ever since my first marriage—I
have been married six times—you can
easily see how substantial the gain has
been. I need hardly say that I enforced
the practice on all my wives.
Yours faithfully, OCTAvus HENRY.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-It is high time
that a word of dignified protest should
be uttered against the prevailing heresy
that longevity is a virtue and grandeur
an inseparable attribute of old age.

unnecessary effort to disseminate super-

ments catapult is one as per illustration. Make
earthen bullets, dry them in the sun and when-

chase few birds; it won't miss the aim. It is

(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
BAKER.
House of Commons, Monday, Decem-
ber 9.—Twenty-fourth day allotted for
consideration of Home Rule Bill in
Committee. Only four more days and
up goes the Bill for Report. For that,
further allowance of seven full sittings.
As the Man in the Street well knows,
the Report stage of a Bill is practically
Committee at work again, main differ-
ence being that proceedings go forward
with SPEAKER in the Chair and Mace
on Table. Any controversial detail
debated and divided upon in Committee
may be brought up again at Report
stage, discussed and divided upon
afresh. Thus by time Bill stands for
final ordeal of Third Reading thirty-
five days will have been occupied in
discussing its details.
Only Macbeth inviting Macduff to
“lay on,” or Oliver Twist, in circum-
stances too familiar to permit quota-
tion, would complain of insufficiency of
opportunity. For majority of Members
it has proved embarrassingly liberal.
This afternoon, as heretofore, resump-
tion of sitting of Committee accepted
Had Clerk at Table, instead of citing
Orders of the Day, wildly shouted,
“Fire! Fire | " Members could not have
fled with greater alacrity. Nor are
they in haste to return. Only thing
that brings them back is sound of
division bell. Then they troop in by
hundreds.
Perplexing if, momentarily returning
to arena of debate, they were called
upon to consider merits of question at
whose decision they are about to assist.
Happily there is an easier way. The
Party Whips are at their posts. They
indicate the right lobby for their men
to vote in, and in they tumble. Ayes
to right of us, Noes to left of us.
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to vote and fly
back to the smoking-room, the reading-
room, the library, or whencesoever they
may have been summoned by the
tintinnabulation of the bell.
All the same, this does not prevent

Turned up to-day with group of eight
further queries marked by curiously in-
timate knowledge of technicalities of
transactions in the silver market;
could not be excelled if it were supplied
by the baffled traders aforesaid.
SARK, in contradiction of accepted
theories, asserts that RUPERT was the
lay figure from which character of
Sherlock Holmes was developed. Cer-
tainly there is something in the quietly
assertive manner, the cool grey eye
with which he fixes the Minister on
the rack that recalls the great master
of amateur detection. If he were within
reach of Treasury Bench one would
expect to see him lightly touch repre-
sentative of India Office in neighbour-
hood of breast pocket, or peradventure
on collar of coat, and produce a rupee
which with aid of microscope would
disclose damning evidence of criminal
connivance between SECRETARY OF
STATE and City house, designed to put
money into their joint purse. Separ-
ated by full breadth of floor he can
only smile—a smile of provoking in-
telligence—as he watches the hapless
Minister struggling in net craftily cast
about him.
Business dome.—Clauses 37 to 41 of
Home Rule Bill carried. In course of
debate stranger in Gallery fell asleep;
even snored. Member in Ministerial
camp, worn out by excitement of
situation, audibly joined him. Deep
answered deep. Cadence of duet rose
and fell whilst St. AUGUSTINE BIRRELL
explained what he proposes to do to
ameliorate lot of Irish Royal Constabu-
lary affected by transference of Govern-
ment.
Thursday.—Monotony of continuous
debate on Home Rule varied for some
Ministers by pursuit of little side
game already referred to in these
columns. Winner is the man who can
in briefest space of time read answer
to Question concerning his Depart-
ment. For some weeks running made
between IRISH SECRETARY, PRESIDENT
of BoARD OF TRADE, and FINANCIAL
SECRETARY TO TREASURY.
By long practice St. AUGUSTINE
BIRRELL has trained golden voice to
speed that elsewhere might be taken as
defying competition. As it happens,
petty details with which he is supplied
in refutation of minute personal gossip
of Nationalist Members are so abso-
lutely immaterial that the fact that no
one can intelligently follow his break-
neck speed is of no consequence. SYD-
NEY Buxton is handicapped by com-
paratively weak voice which, put to

custom commonly respected by his pre-

elocution of John BURNs he would,
even if he omitted superfluous pronouns
of the first person singular, occupy the
whole of time allotted for Questions.
To avoid personal predominance dis-
tasteful to modest man, he rattles off
answers at terrific pace which, if
he achieved it in capacity of chauffeur,
would bring him to the police court
with gyves on his wrists.
Performance curiously suggestive of
operation of penny in the slot. Indis-
pensable penny takes form of Questions

THE Royal Astronomical Society has
recently come into the possession of a
piece of the identical apple-tree which
grew in Sir Isaac NEwton's garden
and, by the fall of a fruit therefrom,
suggested to him the law of gravi-
tation. By a series of coincidences,
which are so familiar to students of the
doctrine of chances, a number of other
interesting relics have simultaneously
emerged from seclusion into the genial
warmth of publicity.
Apropos of historic apples, it is
curious that the civic museum at
Lucerne should have just been enriched
by one of the pips of the apple which
WILLIAM TELL shot from the head of his
son. The seed is much shrunk by age,
but enough remains to stir the heart
of any patriotic Swiss, no matter in
what hotel, however distant, he may
be acting as porter.
The history of the pip is beyond
doubt authentic. The tyrant GEssLER
seems to have preserved it as a token
of high-class marksmanship and to have
Fraúlein Apfel Gessler, who recently
deceased, left it to Lucerne.
Sir SIDNEY LEE, on behalf of the
Trustees of SHAKSPEARE's House at
Stratford-on-Avon, has just written a
letter of thanks to a Warwickshire
gentleman (he prefers to be nameless),
who has given to the Trustees a feather
from the historic second-best bed left by
SHAKSPEARE to ANN HATHAway. The
interesting thing is that the bed turns
out to have been stuffed with swan's
down, and the committee of experts
have agreed that this warm and lux-
urious material was torn for the purpose
from SHAKSPEARE's own body. Sir
Edwin DURNING-LAwRENCE is, how-
ever, contesting this, his allegation
being that it was torn from BACON,
the Swan of Gray's Inn. Be that as
it may, the Trustees are to be con-
gratulated on their good fortune.
At a recent meeting of the Ento-
mological Society great enthusiasm was
caused by the announcement that the
skeleton of the spider which taught the
BRUCE the lesson of perseverance had
been presented to the Society by Mr.
ANDREw CARNEGIE. It appears that
which BRUCE was devotedly attached,
he kept its remains together with the
web in a small leather case, which he
wore round his neck until his death,
and which was subsequently preserved
at Dunfermline, where he was buried.
The web unfortunately has disappeared,
having been blown away in the great
gale of 1839, but Mr. CARNEGIE has
generously offered to present it to the
Society in case of its recovery, and has
offered a reward of a Free Library to
the finder.
Lastly we have to chronicle the
acquisition by the Refreshment De-
partment of the British Museum of two
of the cakes baked by ALFRED THE
GREAT when he was lying perdu in the
hut of a poor neatherd named GUNTHER.
GUNTHER, a man of iron constitution,
frequently tried to eat them when pro-
visions ran low, but, owing to their
brick-like consistency, failed in his
purpose, and on learning the identity
of his guest preserved them as an heir-
loom. Subsequently, under ALFRED's
patronage, he set up a confectioner's
shop in London and founded the illus-
trious firm which has ever since had

THE RELIC-HUNTING SEASON.
SPLENDID BAGs.
THE Royal Astronomical Society has
recently come into the possession of a
piece of the identical apple-tree which
grew in Sir Isaac NEwToN's garden
and, by the fall of a fruit therefrom,
º to him the law of gravi-
tation. By a series of coincidences,
which are so familiar to students of the
doctrine of chances, a number of other
interesting relics have simultaneously
emerged from seclusion into the genial
warmth of publicity.
Apropos of historic apples, it is
curious that the civic museum at
Lucerne should have just been enriched
by one of the pips of the apple which
WILLIAM TELL shot from the head of his
son. The seed is much shrunk by age,
but enough remains to stir the heart
of any patriotic Swiss, no matter in
what hotel, however distant, he may
be acting as porter.
The history of the pip is beyond
doubt authentic. The tyrant GEssLER
seems to have preserved it as a token
of high-class marksmanship and to have
Fraúlein Apfel Gessler, who recently
deceased, left it to Lucerne.
Sir SIDNEY LEE, on behalf of the
Trustees of SHAKSPEARE's House at
Stratford-on-Avon, has just written a
letter of thanks to a Warwickshire
gentleman (he prefers to be nameless),
who has given to the Trustees a feather
from the historic second-best bed left by
SHAKSPEARE to ANN HATHAway. The
interesting thing is that the bed turns
out to have been stuffed with swan's
down, and the committee of experts
have agreed that this warm and lux-
urious material was torn for the purpose
from SHAKSPEARE's own body. Sir
Edwin DURNING-LAwRENCE is, how-
ever, contesting this, his allegation
being that it was torn from BAcon,
the Swan of Gray's Inn. Be that as
it may, the Trustees are to be con-
gratulated on their good fortune.
At a recent meeting of the Ento-
mological Society great enthusiasm was
caused by the announcement that the
skeleton of the spider which taught the
BRUCE the lesson of perseverance had
been presented to the Society by Mr.
ANDREw CARNEGIE. It appears that
which BRUCE was devotedly attached,
he kept its remains together with the
web in a small leather case, which he
wore round his neck until his death,
and which was subsequently preserved
at Dunfermline, where he was buried.
The web unfortunately has disappeared,
having been blown away in the great
gale of 1839, but Mr. CARNEGIE has
generously offered to present it to the
Society in case of its recovery, and has
offered a reward of a Free Library to
the finder.
Lastly we have to chronicle the
acquisition by the Refreshment De-
partment of the British Museum of two
of the cakes baked by ALFRED THE
GREAT when he was lying perdu in the
hut of a poor neatherd named GUNTHER.
GUNTHER, a man of iron constitution,
frequently tried to eat them when pro-
visions ran low, but, owing to their
brick-like consistency, failed in his
purpose, and on learning the identity
of his guest preserved them as an heir-
loom. Subsequently, under ALFRED's
patronage, he set up a confectioner's
shop in London and founded the illus-

By a Lady Contributor.
PRESENTs For GENTLEMEN.
What to give one's male friends at
the happy season of goodwill is always a
difficulty, but all doubts should cease
immediately one enters the fascinating
doors of Messrs. Jenner and Ossity.
Ingenious brains have been busy all the
year in devising new and acceptable
gifts, and the harvest now on view is a
very rich one. Does your male friend

than a cigarette case ? Messrs. J.
and O. have a delightful specimen
constructed either of silver, gold, plati-
num or radium, according to the means
of the purchaser or the measure of his
or her love, to hold one each. But no
one, it may be urged, wants only one
cigarette. That is true, but Messrs. J.
and O.'s idea is that the single case will
be popular because it will discourage
indiscriminate benevolence, no one ex-
pecting to be offered the only one left,
while a number of these cases scattered
about the person or worked in a jewelled
bandolier made for the purpose will
come to the same thing as having the
same number of cigarettes in one case
—a dull and antiquated arrangement
in no way consonant with the novelty
which Christmas should induce.

in this direction is a box containing
seven pencils, each with a jewelled top
and each lettered with a day of the
| week, so many gentlemen having com-
plained that it is irksome and degrading
to use the same pencil two days running.
\ A week's set in gold can be obtained
for fifteen guineas.
For THE FAIR SEx.
For the ladies there are novelties
galore. Beautiful devices for moisten-
ing insurance stamps are, of course,
old; but Messrs. J. and O. have many
new designs, one of the most popular
of which is a little silver figure of the
CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer with
means of water; so that the inventor
of the stamp is also the licker of it, as
is only fit. Messrs. J. and O.'s tele-
gram-openers are a 1912 novelty, and
everyone will welcome their silver
damp-detectors for the seats of motor-
cars: a long-felt want.
But one of their cleverest gifts, the
invention of which indicates not only
that desire to please which ever dis-
tinguishes Messrs. J. and O., but also
not a little knowledge of modern
feminine weaknesses, is a beautiful
morocco Prayer-Book, made in a variety
of hues, in the cover of which is a tiny
but perfect roulette wheel under glass.
Very attractive little I. O. U. books,
with counterfoils, for Bridge parties, can
also be had for a guinea each, with
tiny silver pencil included.
For CHAUFFEURs.
Quite a number of delicately appro-
priate gifts designed for these Hiero-
phants of Speed are exhibited in a
special apartment. Amongst these we
may notice a charming little electric
footwarmer, which can be worn inside
the boot, and is ludicrously cheap at
five guineas the pair. Very dainty
also is the turquoise mounted book-
rest, contrived to meet the literary
needs of the chauffeur when he is wait-
ing for his employer, with a diamond-
hilted moustache-brush attached.
For PET DoGs.
Our humbler friends are by no means
neglected by Messrs. Jenner and Ossity,
and, in fact, everything is done to
render the joyous anniversary ever to be
Jhappily remembered by them. Jewelled
collars are, of course, to be seen in great
profusion; but what are more new and
charming in their thoughtfulness are
the gold and silver napkin rings for the
little darlings, with a place for the name
to be engraved. Photograph frames
for the portraits of pedigree dog's father
and mother side by side, are deservedly
favourite gifts, and indicate Messrs.
J. and O.'s thoroughness.

THE KING's REMEMBRANCER TACTFULLY REMINDS HENRY VIII. THAT HIS MAJESTY HAS ALREADY BEEN MARRIED FIVE TIMES.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
King Errant (HEINEMANN) is one of those somewhat
perplexing books that set themselves to tell fact as fiction.
In it FLORA ANNIE STEEL has accomplished very success-
fully the task of writing the life of a real man in the terms
of a novel. Babar, Emperor of India—poet, painter,
soldier, athlete, gentleman, musician, beggar, and king—is
her hero, and the story of his adventurous life, drawn from
his own records, is her material. You will not need my
assurance that there is no writer living who could have
used it to better advantage. But (and let me hasten to
assure Mrs. STEEL that what follows is the sincerest tribute
of my admiration) I am glad that the task, well done, will
now leave her free for pure fiction again. These stories
“founded on fact,” even when the result is so fascinating
as this quite undeniably is, always produce in me a sensation
of profound unreality. I can never enjoy the most witty
or appropriate talk because of my suspicion that the real
persons never talked it. If the persons are confessedly
only real as the creations of a distinguished novelist, I can
believe in them whole-heartedly. All of which amounts to
saying that while I admired King Errant and enjoyed it
for what it was, I am so ungrateful as to grumble at its not
being the unfettered work of one of my favourite story-tellers,
simply because while truth is sometimes stranger than
fiction it is often less convincing.
The Bloomsbury boarding-house directed by Mrs. Sockitt,
with the languid moral support of that prince of loafers, her
ful people, that if I had lived there I should certainly have
tried to return to it from the grave. I should have wanted
to see more of Miss Meadows, of Susette, of Owen Bachelor,
and of the maid-of-all-work, Fanny, who on Sunday after-
noons, sallying out in gay attire, was always met at the
corner by a meek young man, whom she invariably greeted
with the astonished, “Well—an' were on earth 'ave you
sprung from ?” The motives, however, which led the hero
of Mr. ToM GALLoN's Levity Hicks (LoNG) to make such a
return were deeper and more complex. Like most men who
die suddenly, Levity (short for Leviticus) had left much
undone that he would have wished to have done before
leaving this world; and the second half of the story tells
how he came back and did it. As is generally the case with
Mr. GALLON's work, the charm of the book is due to the
fact that the author does not forget that he has a sense of
humour; though, with such a theme, it has naturally to be
held back and only unleashed at somewhat rare intervals.
The characters of the inhabitants of the little world of
Sockitt's are individualized with much apparently effortless
skill, and the author reveals a kindly sympathy for all of
them, however unprepossessing on the surface, with the
single exception of Horace Rutherglen, concerning whom,
indeed, it would require an extraordinarily lenient judge to
say a good word. Most of the plot stands or falls by the
credibility of Horace's villainy; and, as far as I am con-
cerned, it stands. I recommend the book as one of the
best I have read for a very long time.

of his characters to take the liberty of describing him as

his afternoons in the reading-room of the Museum, writing
dull political leaders which no one reads, and reading
musty old books which no one ought to have written,” is
worth looking into, and Mr. ERIC PARKER is worth that
and more. His Promise of Arden (SMITH, ELDER) is the
sunniest and most natural story I have read this year.
Its theme is children and the country, and of the two
I prefer the former. With the exception of Peggy, who
threatens at times to be a prig, they had hardly—God bless
them —a virtue between them. They were gloriously alive
and thoroughly destructive. Dacia was my favourite;
strictly speaking, she was a grown-up, but I cannot find any
excuse for her heartless and mischievous flirtations, except
by regarding her as a child along with the rest of them.
Frankly, I fell in love with Dacia, and I had the feeling,
as I read, that Dacia rather liked me. That, of course,
shows how clever Mr. PARKER has been in the making
of his flirt. With his picture of the country he has been
less clever, or perhaps too clever. Delicate and careful as
it is, it has a touch of
Kathleen Carter (GRANT RICHARDs). Here is an eccentric,
imaginative and diverting book, which yet contrives to miss
the distinction which its opening chapters promised. Nor
does it quite escape absurdity; but its faults do not outweigh
its odd charm. Kathleen is a mid-Victorian actress and
danseuse of exquisite beauty and untarnishable virtue. A
mysterious Mr. Gray, a young foreign potentate, is sojourn-
ing incognito in England with his tutor, Cheyne-Shelton,
a super-intellectual drunken giant with a new and pro-
found philosophy of life (happily only hinted at, not ex-
plained). Under the tutor's influence he contracts with
Kathleen an “amazing marriage,” of which there is quite
unexpected issue in the person of the boy Theo, preco-
ciously a poet and predestinate leader of men. The author
has not enough skill to make his story bear the weight of
the mysteries suggested, or not enough patience to develop
the indicated themes which pique the reader's curiosity.
Certain things are admirable—the early life of Kathleen
with quaint adoring little Miss Reber; the strange court-
affectation, which i.

completed Mr. BRADBY's study of school-boyhood; that
is outside the scope of his present task, which is a
picture of nursery-life from the child's view, drawn with
an engaging humour that is always kindly and never for
one moment degenerates into the sentimental. At times
it may remind you of The Golden Age, and I can
only add that acquaintance with his grown-ups will by no
means lessen your enjoyment of Mr. BRADBY's fascinating
kiddies. There are six of them, each with a marked
and human individuality that is the result (I suspect) of
study from an actual model, and with a fine gift for the
most varied and pleasant adventure. Read the chapter in
which they give rein to a sudden passion for “Doing Good.”
There is a smile on nearly every page of it (as the advertise-
ments might, but do not, say), a reminiscent smile that
acknowledges the truth of Mr. BRADBY's observation and
memory. A book, in short, that will have no enemies and
countless friends—and one that no bachelor should be

appeal may not be urgent enough to reach those who like
their fiction to bear a resemblance to fact. For my own
part, however, I am boyishly delighted to find that my
appetite for an honest shocle:–the price seems to have
gone up—is as eager as ever. Here we see a Lord Chief
Justice calmly sentencing a man to death for the crime he
has himself committed. I doubt if a novelist's imagination
ever reached a giddier height of improbability than this;
but Mr. ALLERTON is merely out to give excitement, and if
you can swallow a few unlikelihoods I promise that you
will get it. Altogether a feverishly engrossing melodrama
with a love story duly thrown in, and infinitely better
written than the majority of its kind. -

Fossil remains which were uncovered
by a fall of cliff at Bacton, Norfolk,
have, we are told, been “identified" by
the curator of Norwich Museum as
those of the skull of a primeval elephant.
Whether these beasts were once natives
of our island, or whether this particular
one was imported by a local showman,
is a question as to which the curator's
memory is said to fail him.

THE INTERVIEW.
A STUDY IN HUMILIATION.
The Editor of “Solace and Vim" to
Mr. Hon.ACE BEAMEs.
DEAR SIR,--I should much esteem
the privilege of placing an interview
with yourself before the myriad readers
of Solace and Vim, many of whom are
no doubt familiar with your admirable
and popular romance, The Petrified
Ocean, and would like to know more
about your personality. If you have
no objection will you kindly name a
convenient time to receive a representa-
tive of the paper ?
Yours faithfully,
Editor of Solace and Vim.
Mr. HoRMcE BEAMEs to the Editor of
“Solace and Vim."
DEAR SIR,--It will give me much
pleasure to converse with your repre-
sentative, but only on the understanding
that I have the opportunity of reading
a proof of the interview before publica-
tion. On this condition I should be
glad if he would come to lunch on
Monday next at 1.15.
Yours faithfully,
HoRACE Hºurs
Mr. Hor ACE BEAMEs to Mrs. BEAMEs.
MY DEAR Mother, I have just had
a splendid piece of luck. I have been
asked by the Editor of Solace and
Vim to let one of the staff interview
me! Look out for it.
Your loving HoRACE.
Mr. HoRAcE BEAMEs to the Editor of
“Solace and Wim.”
DEAR SIR,-This is just a line to
remind you, of your promise that I
should see a proof of the interview
before it was published. Mr. Willish
and I talked of so many things besides
those intended for print that I am a
little anxious.
Yours faithfully,
HoRACE BEAMEs.
Telegram from the Editor of “Solace
and Vim" to Mr. HoRACE BEAMEs.
Greatly regret but owing to mis-
understanding interview already pub-
lished. Feel confident however you
will approve everything.
Telegram from Mr. HonACE BEAMEs
to the Editor of “Solace and Wim.”
Stop issue. Interview is utterly
misleading and damaging.
Mr. MoRDAUNT YATEs to Mr. HoRACE
BEAMEs.
MY DEAR HoRACE,-Chancing at my
dentist's to pick up Solace and Vim,

I was amazed to find you expressing
yourself freely in its columns on
so advanced as yourself still hold sacred,
You say, for instance, “ Divorce is as
essential to the well-being of our race
as marriage; ” and in response to the
interviewer's question, “What is your
view, Mr. Beames, of the limits of
realism in fiction?” you reply, “The
novelist should suppress nothing. It
is a duty he owes to Society.” Now
I have not your advantage of being
a single young man of twenty-four
with a popular story to my name
and an income largely derived from a
relative's generosity, and therefore I
cannot understand what you mean;
but I should very much like to be told.
Your affectionate Uncle,
MoRDAUNT YATEs.
From “The Literary Forum.”
It is not uninstructive to think now
and then how times have changed.
Look, for example, at Dr. Johnson being
turned from Lord CHESTERFIELD's door,
and then open the current number of
Solace and Vim, where three columns
are given to the description of a con-
ceited young man and his opinions on
all matters under the sun, for no other
reason than that he has written a glib
story which has run into three or four
editions. As to what these opinions are
worth, one will suffice. “‘I consider,’
said Mr. Beames, leaning back with a
super-subtle smile on his sensitive lips,
‘MATISSE as far above LEONARDo as
PAvLovA is beyond St. VITUs.'”
Mrs. BEAMEs to HoRACE BEAMEs.
MY DEAR Boy, How could you be so
vain and silly? And I thought you
so level-headed under your success.
Once again let me urge on you the
wisdom of going into the Bank and
giving up all but occasional writing.
Your loving Mother.
Mr. HoRACE BEAMEs to Mr. MoR-
DAUNT YATEs.
MY DEAR UNCLE MoRDAUNT, Is it
necessary for me to assure you that
I never said a deal of it at all ? I
was asked by the editor if I would be
interviewed, and thinking it might be
useful to me in getting my name better
known I said Yes, but only on the
understanding that I was to see a proof.
This understanding was broken, and I
am still blushing from the horrors of
the printed travesty of what I said, or
rather what I meant, for it is true that
I did say some of these things, but
purely ironically, with no notion that
they would either be used or miscon-
strued. As a matter of fact the things
that he has used were chiefly those that
I said at lunch before he took out his
notebook, and many even of these are
distorted. Other things really about
The remark about realism was a joke:
Society was spelt with a big S, meaning
the Smart Set, for whom the rather
warmer novels are supposed to be
written. The divorce passage was a
burlesque epigram. The remark about
MATIssB was also nothing but a joke,
just to see how far he (the ass) would
let anyone go in support of his own
Post-Impressionism. I personally hate
it. But I have learned my lesson.
Never again will I be ironical with
anyone who has the power of print.
Your affectionate Nephew,
HoRACE.
From the “Sowbridge Weekly Gazette
and East Works Advertiser.”
It is with pleasure that we draw our
readers' attention to the current number
of our contemporary, Solace and Vim,
which contains a deeply interesting
interview with our gifted young towns-
man, Mr. HoRACE BEAMEs, now a resi-
dent in the Metropolis and on his way
to becoming a distinguished novelist.
In this interview Mr. BEAMEs covers
the whole range of modern thought
and is always deeply suggestive. We
congratulate not only him but Sow-
bridge.
Miss LAVINIA SPIRE to Mr. HoRAcE
BEAMEs.
MY DEAR HoRAcE,--I think I ought
to tell you that I was much pained by a
reference to one of the Saints in a
strange interview with you. I admit
that ST. WITUs is not a Saint in men-
tioning whom one involuntarily hushes |
the voice, but none the less the habit
of flippancy is one to be steadily
avoided, and I sincerely hope you will
consider seriously what I say,

Mr. HoRACE BEAMEs.
DEAR SIR,--I am sorry to have sent
no reply to your numerous telegrams
and letters, but I have been enjoying
a hard-earned holiday in Paris. I fail
to see that, beyond a little natural
annoyance, which I share, at the
negligence of my Sub-Editor, you have
any grievance. I find the interview both
entertaining and informing, and it
should give you a very useful lift.
Sooner or later everyone sees Solace
and Vim, and you will be getting press
cuttings with your choicest tit-bits in
them for months to come. Let me
congratulate you and again thank you
for so kindly acceding to my request.
I would merely add that Willish is one
of the best and most responsible inter-
viewers in London.

the privilege of placing an interview
with yourself before the myriad readers

[DECEMBER 25, 1912.
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE TIDE.”
IT was a pleasant fancy of that child-
like race, the ancient Greeks, that when
they assisted at a play (dealing, of course,
with some familiar myth or history)
they were in the happy position of
gods, capable of enjoying by anticipa-
tion the irony of events which were
hidden from the characters of the drama.
(The ingenuous Agamemnon goes to his
bath. Ha! haſ we know that the
poor old thing is going to his death.)
But the fun may be on the other side
of the footlights, for the actors in a
new modern play must sometimes enjoy
ironically this same sense of superiority
in the knowledge of a future still veiled
from the audience. Thus when the in-
terpreters of Mr. MAcDoNALD HASTINGs'
play remarked the warm reception ac-
corded to the earlier scenes they must
have said to themselves, “Ah ! but our
friends in front don't know what's
coming in the last Act; they'll be let
down badly there.”
Not that I ever quite understood
their approval of those earlier scenes.
It is true that the first Act introduced
us to a bedroom; but even a bedroom
scene cannot altogether compensate for
the improbability of its female occupant
or the doubtful sincerity of the author
who put her there. If he had wanted
honestly to illustrate the noble instinct
of maternity—an excellent obječt in
these days—and not to be merely ex-
travagant and bizarre, he would never
have chosen so extreme a sample.
Here was a demi-mondaine, a drugged
wreck of a woman, who had just es-
caped vulgar suicide through ignorance
of the mechanism of a toy revolver, and
we were asked to believe that the secret
of her life's tragedy was her vain
longing to recover a child that had
been smuggled away from her twenty
years ago, before she had even set eyes
on it—a child that was the fruit of a
chance day's acquaintanceship with a
man whose name she had not had the
curiosity to learn. This was to make a
heavy demand on the credulity even of
a theatre audience; but so firm and
businesslike were the methods of Mr.
NorMAN TREvor as the doctor to
whom Felicity Scarth confided her
maternal yearnings that some of us
felt that if she could impose upon him
with her story we might just as well be
imposed upon too in such good com-
pany. And when, without the faintest,
clue, he undertook to search for the
missing child, not one of us doubted
that he (or she) would be run down
before the evening was much older.
And our confidence was more than
for a bit by the appearance of another
“love-child" — stray “love-children.”
seemed rather numerous in that little
Guernsey watering-place, which was
also remarkable for the Irish accent of
a local tar—we were very soon on the
right track. And here a complication
ensued, slightly reminiscent of The
Second Mrs. Tanqueray. For the
soldier-man who was engaged to the
“love-child” developed a flirtation with
Felicity, and the knowledge of this fact
did not prejudice the girl in her favour
before she learned that her rival
happened also to be her mother. , Nor
did the manner in which the revelation

Dr. Stratton (Mr. NonMAN TREvon) to
Felicity Scarth (Miss ETHEL WARwick). “You
have never scen your child? It was hidden
away from you nearly twenty years ago, and
you have no clue to its sex or name or where-
abouts? Good I will find it for you. . That
shall be my part in the Simple Life which I
am prescribing.”
was made conduce to the improvement
of matters. It was done by the doctor
in the presence of both mothers, the real
and the assumed, as well as the young
man who wanted to marry the one
and resign the prospect of becoming
son-in-law to the other. The girl was
wearing a scarlet cloak at the time,
and in order to break the news more
deftly the doctor made this the text
for a reconstruction of the legend of
Little Red Riding Hood. I can't say
how far this tactfulness mitigated for
the love-child the painfulness of his
disclosure; but she did not take it
at all well. In the end Felicity had
to sacrifice the gratification of her
maternal instincts and console herself
We all hoped that their union would
be fruitful. -
I find that I have not yet mentioned
the Tide, which gave its name to the
play. It only started work in the last
Act, and tried to make up for the delay
by the most appalling uproar. In con-
sequence the apostrophes addressed to
it by the other love-child (Mr. SHIEL
BARRY)—literary afterthoughts that had
no bearing, as far as I could follow
them, on what had gone before—had to
be conducted in tones as of a trumpet.
This Demosthenic competition made a

There was a moment of sincerity in the
play when the woman (Miss Cicely
HAMILTON) who had adopted the love-
child told to the real mother the
tragedy of her childlessness. But for
the most part the author does not seem
to have worried about the truth of his
sentiments so long as he imagined them
likely to be effective on a stage.

by Mr. MACMILLAN. f confess to a
preference for having my humorous
relief supplied by the chief characters

Holiday-making Youth. “CoME on, MATER, THERE AREN'T ANY SEATs. ALL THE BEST PEoPLE Go IN HERE.”
NOEL AND THE NOVELIST.
(A LITTLE Romance.)
WE smoked in peace; the wine was set,
The chestnuts roasted in the ember,
The night was windless, warm and wet,
Being a night in late December.
We smoked in silence, Tom and I,
Save for his pipe's melodious barrel,
When sudden—very shrill and high—
Rang out the ancient Xmas carol
Telling how WENCESI.As the Good
One night, when feeling extra hearty,
O'erwhelmed with doles of meat and wood
An indigent bucolic party.
There is a notice in our street
Too often spurned, too often flouted,
Vetoing music; with some heat
I threw the window up and shouted:—
“O wait! most admirable wait!
I love to hear you make a vile hash
Of that old tune; it thrills me, mate;
The warm drop trembles on my eyelash;
But lo, 'tis Yultetide; 'tis the hour
When Christian men take thought for others,
When kindness, if not sacks of flour,
Should be bestowed on all our brothers.
We feel like that, my friend and I;
Our hearts are kind, our thoughts are gentle;
We heed no wandering minstrel's cry
But yonder, where they've put down tan
Lest noise should mar his stately diction,
At No. 7, there's a man
Writing a morbid piece of fiction.
No Christmas impulse stirs his heart,
But now he tears his matted tresses,
And now he mumbles, “This is Art,
This will be liked by governesses.”
Wile thoughts, like adders green and blue,
Seethe in his soul and hiss and harry:
I think he has a contract to
Finish the vol. by February.
Go, gentle wait, and cheer him up,
Fulfil his heart with generous feeling,
Bid him bring out the wassail cup,
Advise him that the bells are pealing.
I think I see his eyes grow damp,
I hear him murmuring, “I have sinned, oh
Come to my arms, thrice blesséd tramp l."
With these remarks I closed the window.
I know not if the wanderer sped
Straight to the house of Mr. Bevan
(This is the chap, I should have said,
Writing the bilge at No. 7);
I know not, but I think he did,
For some time later, while we toasted
Amanda's eyebrow or her lid,
And munched the chestnuts we had toasted,
Far off, amid the murk and mud–
As Tom remarked, “This brew is stunning"—
We heard a most tremendous thud,
º









To make us dashed well sentimental.
Followed by sounds of someone running. Evor.

| ABRACADABRA.
THE Old Forces really do not play
the game nowadays.
I had spent a long and trying after-
noon in a sale-room that is described
as historic. I had not gone with any
intention of bidding, merely to look
on; and yet at four o'clock I had still
bought nothing.
“Lot 321,” announced the auctioneer.
“Five Roman fibulae or brooches, a
supposed spear-head believed to be from
the bed of the Thames, an ancient
bronze ring, a plaster cast (Venus
Surprised), three seventeenth-century
pipe-etoppers, a bundle of French
assignats and a galvanic battery—
faulty. A speculative lot.”
No one responded.
“Sevenpence,” I ventured diffidently.
There were seven items to the lot, you
will observe. -
“I must remind you, Sir,” said the
auctioneer severely, “that the rules
printed in the catalogue, which you
have before you, fix one shilling as the
minimum initial bid for any lot.”
I corrected myself. “One-and-two-
pence, I mean, of course.”
The hammer paused, then fell with
the conventional tap.
“What name, please?"
“Cash,” I replied largely.
I paid my cash and received the lot.
I had not as yet examined it, but with
it now before me I began to fear that
I had been beguiled into overbidding
myself. -
“Oh dear! oh dear!” panted a voice
at my elbow, “am I too late 2 Can
you tell me, my dear Sir, if Lot 321
has gone?”
“In a sense, yes,” I replied, indi-
cating the miscellaneous flotsam before
me. “In another sense it has come.”
“You have bought it!” exclaimed
the old gentleman—he was really, now
that I came to look at him, a very
patriarchal, not to say oriental, per-
sonage—“may I ask, what have you
bought it for 2 "
“Well,” I admitted, “that's just
what I was asking myself when you
interposed.”
“I mean,” he said a little impatiently,
“what particular object attracted your
fancy. I can scarcely imagine that if
the galvanic battery was what you
desired you will have any strong par-
tiality for the Roman fibulae; or if
your heart was set on the alleged spear-
head that you would not be ready
to consider an offer for the French
assignats. But perhaps the shortest
way will be for me to explain myself
definitely. I have a partiality for this
antique bronze ring; may I acquire it
“Certainly,” I replied. “Or, better
still, at yours. I might, however, point
out to you,” I added, referring him to
the first page of the catalogue, “that
Rule 4 says: “No bid shall commence
at less than a shilling . . . and so on
in proportion.’”
“Assuredly,” he admitted a little
vaguely, but picking up the ring with
evident satisfaction. “You have been
markedly generous. I am not to be
outdone. In return for this ancient
bronze ring you shall be granted three
wishes—have whatever you like.”
“Thank you. I don't mind a scotch-
and-soda,” I said, perhaps by mere
force of habit.
Immediately at my hand stood a tall
crystal glass of the beverage I had
specified. The cut of the vessel was
curious and antique, but the contents
were above suspicion.
“I only wish,” I remarked, as I put
the glass down again, “that I could
always have one from under that label
for the asking.” -
“You can,” replied the venerable
stranger, “henceforth.”
I thought it as well to try the dodge
while he was there.
“Then I'll have another,” I declared,
and the glass was instantly replenished.
“Your demands are satisfied ?”
suggested the old man.
“Not quite,” I replied cunningly.
“I know what I am doing. That last
wasn't a separate wish—it comes under
the generous and inexhaustible provision
of wish B. And that being so I don't
mind ordering up another for you.”
Needless to say, a third miraculous
whisky-and-soda was there.
“Have your final wish,” said the
stranger, pushing aside the glass, a
little ungraciously, I thought, after my
delicate attention. “I am anxious to
be gone from this place.”
I began to think that the old man
was rather selfish and had possibly
over-reached me in the bargain.
“I can have anything I name for the
third wish 2 " I demanded.
“You have only to mention it.”
“Then I'll have the ring back, thank
ou.”
“The ring !” he repeated incredu-
lously.
“Precisely. The antique bronze ring
which you are wearing,” I replied.
He seemed a little dazed still, but he
hulled it off his finger and it was in
my hand. -
“Crafty and perfidious one,” he began.
“Wait a moment,” I replied. “Now,
will you give me three wishes for this
ring 2"
“Have I not spoken it? You have
only to declare your demands.”
begin over again. And I only hope that
there's no catch in it.”
I saw a tricky look come into his
venerable eyes and I knew in a flash
that I had squandered wish A.
“Ah-ha, so that counts, does it?”
I remarked. “Very well. Now will you
knock it off or shall I have the ring
back again for wish B and then begin
again? We have the long winter
evening before us.”
“Proceed, excellency,” he entreated,
with tears in his eyes; “have it as
your enlightened wisdom demands, only
proceed.”
“All right; now this is really the
start,” I agreed. “I wish that I had
a purse containing gold and that it
would be replenished at once however
often I emptied it, and—hold hard |
I'm touching wood still, it all belongs
to the same wish—that none else should
be any the poorer by it and that I
should be unable to lose the purse or
to part from it by accident or through
misapprehension.”
“It is granted.”
I felt something heavy come into my
right-hand trouser pocket and I knew
that a start had been made.
“Secondly, I wish that I may at once
become very accomplished, amiable,
entertaining, handsome, distinguished,
learned, popular, eligible and in every
other way desirable, and that none of
these attributes may bring in its
train the boomerang-like retribution
that gentlemen of your craft tradi-
tionally keep up your sleeves.”
The venerable personage seemed to
have several things to say in his own
tongue and the incantation was a little
lengthy. But at last he bowed.
“It is assured,” he declared. Strangely
enough, I did not feel the slightest
change in my personality.
“Finally—wish C–and most impor-
tant,” I continued, “I insist that in
common fairness I shall be allowed to
have a decent time in possession of my
new qualities before I wake up.”
This is what I complain of. It was
at that moment that I awoke.

THE HALL-MARK.
MY DEAR MAURICE, -The delicate
compliment contained in your last letter
has done its work. “When will you
renounce your old-fashioned prejudice
against Music Halls?” you wrote. “I
assure you they have altered out of all
recognition during the last few years,
and even though you live in the
Provinces you would find the perform-
ances there acceptable to the most
intellectual. Go, my boy, see, and be
conquered.”
Well, I went, saw, and was—not
exactly conquered, Maurice; overcome
would be a better word. The turn that
was due to commence as I took my
seat was, I found on reference to the
programme, “Trotter and Lottie, in a
Hunting Scena." The curtain rose and
revealed what appeared to be a lawn
separated from a wide stretch of hilly
country by a wooden paling, the latter
disappearing at each side behind massive
Ionic columns which projected from
the wings. -
Presently, when we had feasted our
eyes upon this, Trotter came in, a tubby
little man, clad in “pink,” white
breeches, top boots and the cap affected
by huntsmen. An artificially bibulous
appearance had been given to his
features by means of a lavish appli-
cation of red grease paint, and his hair
was long and aggressively auburn.
“I’m going a-hunting,
Tally ho-ho-ho-hol
We'll all go a-hunting,
Tally ho-ho-ho-hol”
sang Trotter with energy—with so
much energy, in fact, that, seeking to
reach a high note with his last ‘ho !'
he apparently dislocated his jaw.
Vigorous and protracted manipulation
failed to effect a cure, but a sudden
inspiration caused the sufferer to strike
his chin smartly on the top of the
paling, an operation which afforded
instant relief.
Meanwhile Lottie had entered, a
stout, florid lady wearing riding habit,
hard hat and top boots. Being also, it
seemed, of a musical disposition, she
immediately started to warble, rather
inappropriately:
“Sing me to sleep; the shadows fall . . .”
At this point an appalling crash was
heard just off the stage. The singer
jumped round in very matural alarm,
and exclaimed in a terrified voice,
“Good heavens ! What's that ?”
“Don’t be alarmed,” said Trotter, with
a reassuring smile. “It's only the
shadows falling!”
The incident, however, destroyed
Lottie's desire for self-expression, but

her in crab fashion and assuming a
gargantuan grin, he prodded her in the
ribs, and said in a shrill falsetto,
“Swee-heet one, wilt thou wed me?"
“Certainly not,” she replied indignantly,
and at the same time struck him lightly
on the cheek with her open hand. A
moment later a sharp noise, as of two
boards being smacked together, was
heard in the wings, but appeared to be
unnoticed by either performer.
The unfortunate Trotter now removed
one boot and held the shining side
against his face, a proceeding which
seemed to dissipate all the pain, both
physical and mental, inflicted by his
late rebuff, for he again approached the
lady and asked pleasantly, “Can you

Trotter quickly, and was seized im-

tell, in a sing-song recitative, of a young
man living in the country who was
about to pay a visit to London. His
friends gathered round him and pro-
phesied gay doings in the great city.
“No,” said he, -

This he repeated in order, as I sup-
posed, to convince his friends that they
were mistaken in him.
Charlie then went on to describe a
Colonial about to set out for a well-
earned holiday in the Motherland.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
FROM an early age I have been accustomed to regard the
Borg1As and other mediaeval poisoners as fairly formidable
mixers of other men's drinks; but, since reading God's
Playthings (SMITH, ELDER), I have come to the conclusion
that, if I had lived in their day, I should have preferred to
be left to their mercy rather than to that of the average
doctor of the period. The doctor gave you just as bad a time,
and (the Borg1As never thought of doing this) sent in a bill
for it afterwards. The medicines in this book fascinate me.
If you survived “Jesuit's bark and pulverised mummy,” you
were given a glass of oil, viper powders and milk, or
“horrible nameless drugs.” After that the doctor shook
his head, murmured something consolatory about “in the
midst of life,” and went off in his carriage to murder some-
body else. Those were stirring times, and the tales that
Miss MARJoni E. Bow EN has to tell of them are fine vivid
pieces of work, every one. To my mind, she is at her best

And then sometimes, by way of a specially devastating
contrast, Miss JoHNSTON will allow us an exquisitely
peaceful vignette of Southern scenery, or homes; such a

hearth, with jalousied windows just brushed against from
without by a superb magnolia, with a cricket chirping, and
a great soft white bed . . .” My welcome for that bed
was the sincerest tribute to the power and realism of an
unusual book.
It is a little curious at a time when our sympathies are
thoroughly enlisted on behalf of the Balkan peoples in their
struggles against Islam to read a book by an English
writer who sincerely admires the conduct of the Turks in
Africa, and thinks no word bad enough to describe the
behaviour of Italy. Regarded as a war-correspondent, Mr.
ALAN OSTLER, the author of The Arabs in Tripoli (MURRAY),
is interesting enough, though I should like some antidote

certainly loses none of its dramatic force in Miss BowFN's
hands. And the pathos of it is haunting.
I suppose no historical event has been used more often
as a background to fiction than the American Civil War.
There is a direct and obvious drama about it that is com-
pelling in its appeal to the novelist. In Miss MARY JoHN-
STON's latest book, Cease Firing (CoNSTABLE), it is something
more than a mere background; one would say rather that
the fictional hero and heroine make rare and comparatively
unimportant appearances in a story of which the conflict of
North and South forms the real motive. It stands further
confessed as a war-book from the presence of a map at the
end, which the English reader will find very useful in
following the course of its events. You, of course, know
Miss JohnstoN already as the mistress of a direct and
trenchant style, vividly picturesque. Her adjectives fall
thick and fast, but each like well-aimed shells hitting
exactly the right mark, illumining the scene described with
a quite unforgettable flash. Martial metaphor becomes
inevitable in speaking of this book. The smell of gunpowder
is on almost every page; one is deafened by the roar of
many battles, so much so indeed that I for one emerged
sary to explain to me
the symbolic meaning of ix60s. Nor do I think the Arabs
and their chaffering propensities worthy of so much
attention as he pays to them. I had already guessed that
in all the lands of the sun infinite haggling is a point of
honour in the smallest commercial transaction. But on
the whole Mr. OSTLER's description of the strange hosts
who gathered to the help of the Crescent has charmed me
like nothing else since I read of the gathering of the army
of XERxEs. Would anyone have expected to find at his
tent-door an English-speaking Afghan who had come on
from Mecca, instead of returning home, because “God’s
battles are the battles of all Moslems”? And best of all,
Mr. OSTLER has plenty of humour. I cannot do better than
end with a quotation which will appeal to all who re-
member their childish dreams of the devotion of an Arab
steed to his lord: “So I bought that horse, and called him
‘Binbashi,' which means “Major,’ and I spent quite a lot
of time in trying to tame him. I fed and watered him
myself, and, after many weeks, I found that, if he were
loose, he would follow me like a dog—with intent to bite.”

CEILOGUE

I
N the course of his latest journey through Europe, Mr. Punch found himself one winter night on the outskirts
snow, he entered the nearest inn for the purpose of ordering a small vodka. A peasant, seated by the fire, looked up
and greeted him in Russian.
"Good evening," replied the Sage fluently in the same language.
The peasant enquired if he had come far.
"From England," said Mr. Punch. " In pursuit of knowledge.” He took out his notebook. "Perhaps you will
be kind enough to assist me. I am collecting information on the subject which is stirring every nation to its depths.”
He sharpened his pencil and began. “You agree with me, no doubt, that Servia's desire for a port on the Adriatic
“On the what?" said the peasant.
The Adriatic — is, when all the facts are taken into consideration-
" What is the Adriatic?"
“Good Heavens, man!” cried Mr. Punch. “Don't tell me you've never heard of the Adriatic! Why, your blood
must boil when you think of Austria's veto of a little window in the Adriatic for Servia !”
The Russian indicated that his blood did not boil in such circumstances.
“ Aren't you longing to get to grips with the hated Austrian ? "
“Why?” said the peasant stupidly.
Why? Bless the man! Haven't you been at enmity with him for centuries ?”
" Have I?”
"Of course you have! And you are longing to kill-
The Russian looked round in alarm and then rose from his seat.
" You mustn't talk Anarchy here,” he said warningly. He looked round again and put his finger to his lips.
Anarchy!” cried Mr. Punch. “This isn't Anarchy, it is Patriotism! Surely you are burning to kill your
country's hated foes; to plunge your knife-
" When I plunge my knife," said the peasant in a low voice, “ it will not be into an Austrian.”
Mr. Punch shivered and put his notebook back into his pocket. "I think I will be getting on,” he said.
He tossed a rouble to the landlord and made for the door. "I have a long way to go,” he explained. Whistling to the
waiting wolves, he jumped into his sleigh and drove off rapidly.
It was some days later that he found himself in a German house of refreshment. Ordering a large lager, a loaf

DECEMBER 25, 1912.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 519
ºf N Bernant Parratoct. |
IN the course of his latest journey through Europe, Mr. Punch found himself one winter night on the outskirts
of a Russian village. Stepping from his sleigh and shaking off the usual wolves which had pursued him over the
snow, he entered the nearest inn for the purpose of ordering a small vodka. A peasant, seated by the fire, looked up
and greeted him in Russian.
“Good evening,” replied the Sage fluently in the same language.
The peasant enquired if he had come far.
“From England,” said Mr. Punch. “In pursuit of knowledge.” He took out his notebook. “Perhaps you will
be kind enough to assist me. I am collecting information on the subject which is stirring every nation to its depths.”
He sharpened his pencil and began. “You agree with me, no doubt, that Servia's desire for a port on the Adriatic—”
“On the what?” said the peasant.
“The Adriatic — is, when all the facts are taken into consideration
“What is the Adriatic 2''
“Good Heavens, man!” cried Mr. Punch. “Don’t tell me you've never heard of the Adriatic | Why, your blood
must boil when you think of Austria's veto of a little window in the Adriatic for Servia!”
The Russian indicated that his blood did not boil in such circumstances.
“Aren't you longing to get to grips with the hated Austrian 2"
“Why?” said the peasant stupidly.
“Why? Bless the man I Haven't you been at enmity with him for centuries?”
“Have I?”
“Of course you havel And you are longing to kill
The Russian looked round in alarm and then rose from his seat.
“You mustn't talk Anarchy here,” he said warningly. He looked round again and put his finger to his lips.
“Anarchy l’’ cried Mr. Punch. “This isn't Anarchy, it is Patriotism Surely you are burning to kill your
country's hated foes; to plunge your knife * > -
“When I plunge my knife,” said the peasant in a low voice, “it will not be into an Austrian.”
Mr. Punch shivered and put his notebook back into his pocket. “I think I will be getting on,” he said.
He tossed a rouble to the landlord and made for the door. “I have a long way to go,” he explained. Whistling to the
waiting wolves, he jumped into his sleigh and drove off rapidly.

It was some days later that he found himself in a German house of refreshment. Ordering a large lager, a loaf

of black bread and a round of horse-flesh, Mr. Punch sat down at a table and gave himself up to thought. The noise
of an opening door roused him.
There entered a spectacled German; such an one as, in the intervals of study for an English clerkship, refreshes
himself with emendations of SHARspeARE and copious draughts of beer. It was not long before Mr. Punch was in
conversation with him. - - - -
“Ah,” said Mr. Punch, “how I envy you! To march, burning with indignation, shoulder to shoulder with your
brother Austrian against the hated Slav; to see your life-blood drip slowly out in defence of that noblest of all ideals,
the inviolability of the Adriatic. Ah, my friend, that indeed is a grand fate' "
The German did not appear to be stirred by the picture.
“It will be inconvenient,” he said stolidly. “You see, I have just
“To rush into battle, crying ‘God defend the Adriatic ' ' and with drawn sword—"
“You see, I have just got a clerkship at ‘Smith and Wilkinson's in Cheapside, London, starting at no less
than fifteen shillings a week. They want me to begin work next month. My prospects in England are excellent."
He drank his beer and went hastily back to his studies.
Mr. Punch's next stay was in Italy, but the information he picked up in that country was of the slightest.
It was in the intervals of eating macaroni that he enlarged upon the grandeur and nobility of war to an Italian soldier
home from Tripoli. The Italian, waking from his siesta, stared at him in astonishment.
“What did you say was noble?” he asked. -
“Why, war !” said Mr. Punch.
The Italian, home from Tripoli, smiled curiously to himself. - -
“War in such a noble cause!” explained Mr. Punch. “War on behalf of one's beloved ally, Austria!”
The Italian returned to his siesta. -
The Sage decided to hurry home through France. Stopping for a week-end in Paris, he found the city as
gay as ever; so much so that he quite forgot that his mission was to sound public feeling upon the question of the
little window in the Adriatic–the question which was to settle the ſate of millions of human beings. And,
unfortunately, nothing that anybody said reminded him of it. - -
Once back in England, however, Mr. Punch soon discovered that his fellow-countrymen were in an unusual
state of excitement. Each man was talking eagerly to his neighbour, and one name was upon every lip.
The Sage, entering a handy inn and calling for a bumper of grog, questioned the landlord.
“Well,” he said, “and how do they all feel about the little window in the Adriatic–ſor that, I gather,
is the cause of the excitement 2 Aren't they stirred to the very depths of their souls 2"
“Adriatic 2" said the man. “Bless you, Sir, it ain't that that's exciting 'em. It ain't nothing foreign.”
“Then what is it?" asked the Sage of Bouverie Street.
“What is it, Sir? Why, to be sure, it's our Mr. Punch has just brought out his
One jumbrel and forty-Chiro tolume."

• It will be inconvenient,” he said stolidly. “You see, I have just-
“To rush into battle, crying 'God defend the Adriatic!' and with drawn sword-
"You see, I have just got a clerkship at Smith and Wilkinson's' in Cheapside, London, starting at no less
than fifteen shillings a week. They want me to begin work next month. My prospects in Englınd are excellent."
He drank his beer and went hastily back to his studies.
Mr. Punch's next stay was in Italy, but the information he picked up in that country was of the slightest.
It was in the intervals of eating macaroni that he enlarged upon the grandeur and nobility of war to an Italian soldier
home from Tripoli. The Italian, waking from his siesta, stared at him in astonishment.
“What did you say was noble ?” he asked.
Why, war!” said Mr. Punch.
The Italian, home from Tripoli, smiled curiously to himself.
“War in such a noble cause!" explained Mr. Punch. “War on behalf of one's beloved ally, Austria!"
The Italian returned to his siesta.
The Sage decided to hurry home through France. Stopping for a week-end in Paris, he found the city as
gay as ever; so much so that he quite forgot that his mission was to sound public feeling upon the question of the
little window in the Adriatic—the question which was to settle the fate of millions of human beings. And,
unfortunately, nothing that anybody said reminded bim of it.
Once back in England, however, Mr. Punch soon discovered that his fellow-countrymen were in an unusual
state of excitement. Each man was talking eagerly to his neighbour, and one name was upon every lip.
The Sage, entering a handy inn and calling for a bumper of grog, questioned the landlord.
“Well," he said, "and how do they all feel about the little window in the Adriatic-for that, I gather,
is the cause of the excitement ? Aren't they stirred to the very depths of their souls ? "
“ Adriatic?" said the man. “ Bless you, Sir, it ain't that that's exciting 'em. It ain't nothing foreign.”
“ Then what is it?" asked the Sage of Bouverie Street.
“What is it, Sir? Why, to be sure, it's our Mr. Punch has just brought out his
One Hundred and Forty-Third Volume.”

IN PRAISE OF HILDEBRAND, OLD CAMPAIGNER AND HUMORIST.
Not in the cart, the common cart,
With vulgar items of the bag,
But in a special place apart
Let him be laid, our warrior-wag;
Here in the scene where last he sprinted
And, sprinting, fell convulsed with
mirth,
Give him his hero's dues unstinted,
Lay him in earth.
He was a most unusual hare,
This Hildebrand; he loved to face
The powder's music and to share
Our simple pleasures of the chase;
Delight of camaraderie pricked him
To join us at the first report,
And, when he died, he died a victim
To love of sport.
Indifferent how remote the beat
And what the weather, foul or fine,
He would attend with instant feet
And run the gauntlet of the line;
Wearing a smile of calm derision
Yet not unmixed with kind regards,
He mocked, in profile, our precision
At fifty yards.
“At CERTAIN CELEBRATIONs
By wispy Moons of MARCH HE wore
Whole Rows of FIGHTING DEcoRATIONs."
Yet was his ſur no coat of mail
To let his limbs escape immune;
People would notice how his tail
Ended an inch or so too soon ;
Through punctured ears one saw the
stubble;
His flanks were drilled with draughty
dints;
And half his hind-legs gave him trouble
For want of splints.
Legends arose of his renown,
How that his courage under fire
Had won, by wide consent, the crown
Of every soldier's heart's desire;
And how at certain celebrations
By windy moons of March he wore
Whole rows of fighting decorations,
Three deep or more,
There was the Norfolk Star he gained
For cool behaviour in the roots;
Likewise the D.S.O., obtained
The day he rushed the Colonel's
boots;
And here, too, where he bit the greasy
Bank of the hedge at which he dived,
He surely must have earned the W.C.
Had he survived.
But no, his destined hour had struck;
Not all his judgment, nice and true,
His sense of range, his gift of luck,
y Availed, this time, to get him through;
Right on the post, when he had flouted
"A dozen barrels' harmless bark,
Fate's humour intervened and outed
“The DAY HE RUSHEI, The Col.oxEL's Boots."
For, as he flew the open field,
Taking, from time to time, a scratch,
He failed to mark a gun concealed
In the ensuing turnip-patch;
He failed, I say, to see this ambush,
And suddenly there rang a shot
From somewhere just behind a dam
bush—
And he was not
He fell, and in his filmy eye

THE GIANT WHO DIED
FROM LAUGHING.
(A Matter-of-Fact Fairy Tale.)
ONCE upon a time there was a King
The two eldest,
who had three sons.
were lazy good-for-nothing
young men, but the third
son, whose name was
Charming, was a delightful
youth, who was loved by
everybody (outside his
family) who knew him.
Whenever he rode through
the town the people used
to stop whatever work they
were engaged upon and
wave their caps and cry
“Hurrah for Prince Charm-
ing !”—and even after he
had passed they would
continue to stop work, in
case he might be coming
back the same way, when
they would wave their caps
and cry “Hurrah for Prince
Charming!" again. It was
wonderful how fond of him
they were.
But alas! his father the
King was not so fond. He preferred his
eldest son; which was funny of him,
because he must have known that only
the third and youngest son is ever any
good in a family. Indeed, the King
himself had been a third son, so he had
really no excuse for ignorance on the
point. I am afraid the truth was that
he was jealous of Charming, because the
latter was so popular outside his family.
Now there lived in the Palace an old
woman called Countess Caramel, who
had been governess to Charming when
he was young. When the Queen lay
dying the Countess had promised her
that she would look after her youngest
boy for her, and Charming had often
confided in Caramel since. One morn-
ing, when his family had been parti-
cularly rude to him at breakfast, Charm-
ing said to her:
“Countess, I have made up my mind,
and I am going into the world to seek
my fortune.” -
“I have been waiting for this,” said
the Countess. “Here is a magic ring.
Wear it always on your little finger,
and whenever you want help turn it
round once and help will come.”
Charming thanked her and put the
ring on his finger. Then he turned it
round once just to make sure that it
worked. Immediately the oddest little
dwarf appeared in front of him.
“Speak and I will obey,” said the
dwarf.
Now Charming didn't want anything
at all just then, so after thinking for a
The dwarf, a little surprised, dis-
appeared.
“This is splendid,” thought Charm-
|ing, and he started on his travels with
a light heart.
The sun was at its highest as he
came to a thick wood, and in its shade
But Charming did not want to talk
about brothers. He sat down on a
fallen log beside her, and looked at her
entranced.
“I think you are the most lovely
lady in all the world,” he said.
“Am I ?” said the Princess, whose
name, by the way, was
Beauty.
She looked away from
him and there was silence
between them. Charming,
a little at a loss, fidgeted
nervously with his ring, and
began to speak again.
“Ever since I have known
you * >
“You are in need of
help ?” said the dwarf, ap-
pearing suddenly.
“Certainly not,” said
Charming angrily. “Not
in the least. I can manage
this quite well by myself.”
“Speak, and I will obey.”
“Then go away,” said
Charming; and the dwarf,
he lay down to rest. He was awakened
by the sound of weeping. Rising
hastily to his feet he peered through
the trees, and there, fifty yards away
from him, by the side of a stream sat
the most beautiful damsel he had ever
seen, wringing her hands and sobbing
bitterly. Prince Charming, grieving
at the sight of beauty in such distress,
coughed and came nearer.
THE LITTLE DWARF.
(1 hare forgotten his name.)
“Princess,” he said tenderly, for he
knew she must be a Princess, “you
are in trouble. How can I help you?”
“Fair Sir,” she answered, “I had
thought to be alone. But, since you
are here, you can help me if you will.

who was beginning to lose
his grip of things, again
disappeared.
The Princess, having
politely pretended to be looking for
something while this was going on,
turned to him again. -
“Come with me,” she said, “and I
will show you how you can help me.”
She took him by the hand and led
him down a narrow glade to a little
clearing in the middle of the wood.
Then she made him sit down beside
her on the grass, and there she told
him her tale.
“There is a giant called Blunderbus,”
she said, “who lives in a great castle
ten miles from here. He is a terrible
magician, and years ago because I
would not marry him he turned my—
my brother into a- I don't know
how to tell you—into a--a tortoise.”
She put her hands to her face and
sobbed again.
“Why a tortoise?” said Charming,
knowing that sympathy was useless, but
feeling that he ought to say something.
“I don't know. He just thought of
it. It-it isn't a very nice thing to be.”
“And why should he turn your
brother into it 2 I mean, if he had
turned Ayou into a tortoise Of
course,” he went on hurriedly, “I’m
very glad he didn't.”
“Thank you,” said Beauty.
“But I don't understand why
“He knew he could hurt me more
by making my brother a tortoise than
by making me one,” she explained, and
looked at him anxiously.
This was a new idea to Charming,
who had two brothers of his own ; and

“My brother,” said
Beauty, “was to have

and added, “He used
to be so punctual.”
“But how can I help

“It is like this. The
only way in which the

someone to kill the

and returned to take

of the Princess.
As soon as he was
alone, Charming turned
the ring round his

appeared before him.

ing to vanish at the word. He was just
beginning to get into the swing of it.
“No, no,” said Charming hastily.

said at last, “a sword. One that will
kill giants.” -
Instantly a gleaming sword was at
his feet. He picked it up and examined
it.
“Is this really a magic sword 2"
“It has but to inflict one scratch,”
said the dwarf, “and the result is
death.”
“Do You KNow ANYTHING About Tortoises 2"

the blade, took his thumb away

“One thing more,” said Charming.
“A pair of seven-league boots . .
Thank you. That is all to-day.”
Directly the dwarf was gone, Charm-
ing kicked off his shoes and stepped
into the magic boots; then he seized
the sword and the cloak and darted off
on his lady's behest. He had
barely gone a hundred paces
before a sudden idea came to
him, and he pulled himself
up short. - -
“Let me see,” he reflected;
“the castle was ten miles
away. These are seven-
league boots—so that I have
come about two thousand
miles. I shall have to go
back.” He took some hasty
steps back, and found himself
in the wood from which he
had started.
“Well ?” said Princess
Beauty, “Have you killed
him 2 '' …
“No, n-no,” stammered
Charming, “not exactly
killed him. I was just—just
practising something. The
fact is,” he added confi-
dentially, “I’ve got a pair
of new boots on, and—”
He saw the look of cold sur-
prise in her face and went on
quickly, “I swear, Princess,
that I will not return to you
again without his head.”
He took a quick step in the
direction of the castle and
found himself soaring over
it ; turned eleven miles off
and stepped back a pace;
overshot it again, and arrived
at the very feet of the Princess.
“His head ' " said Beauty eagerly.
“I—I must have dropped it,” said
Charming, hastily pretending to feel
for it. “I'll just go and ” He
stepped off in confusion.

However, by taking one step to the

he found himself close enough. A
short, if painful, walk, with his boots in
his hand, brought him to his destina-
CHAIRMING MISJUDGES THE DISTANCE.
He had a moment's natural
hesitation about calling at a strange
castle in his stockinged feet, but con-
soled himself with the thought that in
life - and - death matters one cannot
bother about little points of etiquette,
and that, anyhow, the giant would not
be able to see him. Then, donning the
magic cloak, and with the magic sword
in his hand, he entered the castle gates.
For an instant his heart seemed to stop
beating, but the thought of the Princess
gave him new courage. . . .
The Giant was sitting in front of the
fire, his great spiked club between his
knees. At Charming's entry he turned
round, gave a start of surprise, bent
forward eagerly a moment, and then
leant back chuckling. Like most over-
grown men he was naturally kindhearted
and had a simple humour, but he could
be stubborn when he liked. The original
affair of the tortoise seems to have shown
him both at his best and at his worst.
“Why do you walk like that?” he
said pleasantly to Charming. “The
Charming stopped short.
“You see me?” he cried furiously.
“Of course I do | Really, you
mustn't expect to come into a house
without anything on your feet and not
be a little noticeable. Even in a crowd
I should have picked you out.”
“That miserable dwarf,”
said Charming savagely,
“swore solemnly to me that
beneath this cloak I was
invisible to the eyes of my
enemies!”
“But then we are m't
enemies,” smiled the Giant
sweetly. “I like you im-
mensely. There's something
about you—directly you came
in . . . I think it must be
love at first sight.”
“So that 's how he tricked
me !”
“Oh no, it wasn't really
like that. The fact is you
are invisible beneath that
cloak, only—you'll excuse
my pointing it out—there
are such funny bits of you
that aren't beneath the cloak.
You've no idea how odd you
look; just a head and two
legs, and a couple of arms.
. . . Waists,” he murmured
to himself, “are not being
worn this year.”
But Charming had had
enough of talk. Gripping
his sword firmly, he threw
aside his useless cloak, dashed
forward, and with a beautiful
lunge pricked his enemy in
the ankle.
“Victory!”he cried, waving
his magic sword above his head. “Thus
is Beauty's brother delivered 1"
The Giant stared at him for a full
minute. Then he put his hands to his
sides and fell back shaking in his chair.
“Her brother ' " he roared. “Well,
of all the Her brother 1’’ He

ON THE PORTRAIT OF A FRIEND.
WHEN all the world is cold and dark without,
When through a window that is far from clean
The solemn day peers in as though in doubt—
He that of late so buoyant was of mien—
As to his very fitness to be seen;
When London fog, and skies of London grey,
Recall the golden splendour that has been,
And the sick bard reflects, with strong dismay,
That here he is for good, and here he has to stay;
Then, when the gates of light are wholly blocked,
My fragile soul, accustomed to a peak
Of clear empyreal air, is straightly knocked
Into the glooring middle of next week.
Darkling I gº.ze around, and darkling seek
Some helpful charm these wintry woes to end,
Wainly, until, with sudden-brightening cheek,
I turn to thee, O Portrait of my Friend,
And slowly all grows clear, and things begin to mend.
On a most mellow lawn, within a chair
Of pleasing comfort, calmly as a lord
He sits; a blissful scent is on the air,
Borne from his pipe: umbrageous elms afford
A comely shelter for the shaven sward;
Pensive he sits; a book is on his knee.
Ah, happy book, he is not looking bored;
Doubtless his musings are inspired by thee
Partly, and partly by th' approaching hour of tea.
And, gazing with rapt eyes, I am withdrawn
Into a pleasant land of summer ease.
Methinks I stand upon a flower-fringed lawn;
Roses commingle on a lightsome breeze
With the choice weed; the lazy hum of bees,
The song of sleepy birds, entrance my sprite;
All is cool air, clear skies, and kindly trees
That shed a shadowy rapture—different, quite,
From the depressing weight of town's material blight.
And in that hour what fantasies of song,
Like wandering cloudlets, flow across my brain l
What spell is on me! I could go full strong,
But no. The fancy fades. I hear again
The press of many feet, the dripping rain;
The fog broods round me, and the solemn day
Pallidly glimmers through an unclean pane;
And all is dim, and dull, and dismal grey,
As I turn up the light, and sigh, ah well-a-way.
O cool, calm shape, sit on. Thy fragrant pipe
For ever shalt thou smoke, and not consume.
- For thee shall summer be for ever ripe,
The sky be fair, nor waning seasons doom
Thy fancy suiting to a wintry tomb.
Fair youth, beneath thine elms, thou canst not know
The awful deeps of London's heavy gloom;
But be it thine, when I am bored and low,
To waft me hence, as now, for some half hour or so.
