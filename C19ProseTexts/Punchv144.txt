PAVING STONES FOR -
THIs year I am going to be very
| circumspect and sensible. I have made
up my mind, to leave off many old
habits. Let us not speak of “good reso-
lutions,” because they carry breakage
with them; let us call them wise
resolves and give them a chance; or
we might go even farther and call them
hopeless endeavours, and then perhaps
much would result, for this is a world of
surprises.
My first resolve will be to get in first
with the phrase, “A happy New Year.”
I have never done this yet; it has
always been left to me to make the
trite rejoinder, “Same to you, and many
of them.” But this year I will be first.
I will give up being imitative and
secondary in other ways, too. I will be
more original. I will make a start by
taking Yorkshire pudding with mutton.
I will get up earlier.
I will be punctual for breakfast.
I will remember that champagne
doesn't always agree with me.
I shall, of course, go on playing golf
every day of the year, because I believe
that only thus can England maintain
her greatness; but I hereby resolve to
have more pity on those who do not
play it and never talk of the game in
their company.
I will read a chapter of some good
author every night before going to
sleep. -
I noticed now and then in 1912 a
tendency on the part of my friends to
tell me the same story twice or even
thrice. This is a serious danger and
I must myself be on guard against it.
I have therefore bought a little Where
is it? and have written the names of
the best stories in my repertory on the
write underneath them the names of all
the persons to whom I tell them, an
thus I can avoid repetition. . . .
I will weed out and send back all
the books I have borrowed. I will
send round a note asking for mine.
I will never lend any more books.
I will be stronger. I will withhold
tips from waiters, taxi-drivers and so
forth who have not been attentive and
capable. I will tip only the deserving.
I will make that long-deferred list of
the things I want in my bag, and so
for ever cease to forget the strop.
I will answer letters the same day.
P.S.—I don't think. -

“RosBBUD.”—Dear little eighteen-
year-old City . Typist, yours is the
sunny nature for which a sunny future
seems assured. ... I have nothing but
good news for you. If all be well, you
will be very happy. The crystal tells
me that at no very distant date your
fate seems likely to be linked with that
of another, but as to whether that
other is the fair, curly-haired young
‘man who travels with you every
morning by the Shepherd's Bush Tube,
or the dark young man who chatted
with you on the top of a motor-bus,
Isis is silent. (Would you like me to
consult the Black Bowl of Buddha on
this point? For this, with the extra
psychic force required, I should have
to charge £1 10s.) - * . .
“PHOEBE.”—He may be all you
think him, or even all you think you
think him. Go bravely forward. When
the clouds roll away from your horizon,
the sky will be clear. The lock of hair
you send has had a stain applied to it
and has been acquainted with a well-
known curler, all of which shows you
to be of a hopeful, courageous disposi-
tion, determined to make the best of
things. If there were more such women
as you, there would be fewer of other
kinds ! (My fee for an ordinary reading
is £1 1s., not £1.)
“PREVIOUs ExistENCE.”—Yes, cer-
tainly I can, after some little concen-
tration and preparation, take you back
through all your previous incarnations.
The fee is progressive, starting at
£1 1s., and doubling with each previous
individuation. (From what I can sense,
through your letter and the lock of
hair, I should say some of your former
existences have been of a thrilling and
extraordinary kind!) *... •
“ANXIous.”—I have looked into your
future with special reference to the
letter you would be so glad to receive.
Yes, I have seen a letter for you, but
as the flap of the envelope was towards
me, I cannot say what sort of hand the
address was written in.
“LoRNA.”—You are apparently quite
justified in all you think of yourself.
You seem indeed to have every gift,
physical and mental. Use your powers
of fascination gently. Do not break
hearts and desolate lives. Your hand-
writing is very characteristic and dis-
tinctive (there are two p's in appear),
and the lock of hair is of the rarest
shade of chestnut. For such a subject
as yourself, to whom a singular, per-
haps dazzling, destiny seems coming,
the crystal and even the Black Bowl of
Buddha are scarcely adequate. You
had better let me consult the stars.
(My fee for this, taking into considera-
tion the strain on the eyes-and on the
psychic faculties and the risk of taking
cold, is £2 2s.). - -
“AMBITIous."—There can be no doubt
that you are fitted for something even
higher than to be a social leader in
the Garden Suburb, Popplewell Green.
You wish to know if in the coming
time you will realise your ambition and
“get into really good society.” I have
looked into the golden-mists of your
future, and I have seen faintly adum-
brated the form of a woman robed in
satin and adorned with gems receiving
crowds of well-dressed and evidently
high-born guests; but whether that
woman is yourself, time alone will
show ! (All postal orders sent m
should be crossed.) -
“JUST A LARK.”—You say, in your
own deplorable phrase, that you were
“getting at " me, that all your state-
ments were false, and that the lock of
hair sent was cut from a pet dog.
Such conduct is beneath contempt.
Since receiving this second communi-
cation I have again looked into your
future. I should be sorry to tell even
such a person as you what I have
seen.
“INQuisitive.”—No, I know nothing
of the methods of Rooti-Tooti-Lal, the
Indian mystic, whose Psychic Parlour
in Edgware Road was closed by the
| police.

CLARIFYING COMMENTS.
By TIBERIUS MUDD.
I MUST offer my heartiest con-
gratulations to The Skittish Weekly on
its 2,000th number. The proprietors
of this admirable journal have always
been true to the main aim they set
before themselves at the outset—to
combine spirituality with “snap,” the
higher criticism with the personal
note. Amongst those who at one time
or another have enriched its pages by
their contributions are Lord Soper, Sir
Jenery Bunn, Sir Gulliver Stodge, the
Rev. Dr. Inigo Slobb, the Countess
Schunck, Mrs. Chillingham Cattley,
and Professor Folsom Ould, whose
“one minute sermonettes” have been
such an alluring item in The Skittish
Weekly for the last few years. I rejoice
to think that the unimpaired vitality of
this splendid periodical will be mani-
fested in a number of new and un-
precedented features during the forth-
coming year, notably comic obituary
notices of authors who are still alive;
accounts of the wardrobes of Dr.
Johnson, CoLERIDGE, KEATs, G. B.
SHAw and JoHN GALsworthy; and a
series of autobiographical sketches
under the attractive caption, “How I
got my Peerage.”
Great interest is excited by the an-
nouncement of the impending publica-
tion of a new religious weekly paper to
be called Balm. The new venture,
which will be published by the Din-
widdies, will cater not only for the
spiritual but the literary needs of
members of the Free Churches and
will be edited by the Rev. Chadwick
Bandman, pastor of Zion Church,
Stoke-under-Ham. Mr. Bandman, who
was recently presented with a roller-top
desk and a complete canteen of cutlery
and silver by his congregation on the
occasion of his marriage to Miss
Hephzibah Muxloe, daughter of Dr.
Minsey Muxloe, is a richly persuasive
preacher. Not long ago, while attend-
ing Zion Church, I saw the wife of a
Cabinet Minister in a front pew, wear-
ing the most beautiful furs, and irre-
proachably gowned in other respects.
I have been considerably impressed
by the brilliancy of recent issues of
The Bludgeon. For some time past one
felt that literature was suffering from
the unduly lax and conciliatory tone
adopted by our leading journals in their
literary criticisms. This tendency has
found an admirable corrective in the
splendid articles of the editor, Mr. Ixie
Dipsett, who now intends to add a new
feature to his paper under the arresting
title of “The Gibbet,” where “the

Lady. “YEs; BUT suppose THEY FIND someTHING”
worst book of the week’’ will be faith-
fully dealt with. I understand that the
staff of the paper has recently been
reinforced by the accession of that
trenchant young publicist, Mr. Under-
wood Cutts, whom I recently had the
pleasure of meeting at the hospitable
board of my old friend, Dr. Doyly
Springett. Mr. Cutts's novel, Lethal
Love, published by the Dodders, is
certainly a very startling work. I hear
that the CHANCELLOR OF THE Ex-
CHEQUER read it through at a sitting
on a recent week-end visit to Criccieth.
The weekly prize of 5s., or a copy of
the Rev. Offley Bolsover's Soul Food,
for the best paragraph contributed to
this column, has been awarded to the
author of the communication relating
to Balm. For the ensuing week the
prize will be awarded to the writer of
the ten best rhymes on the model of the
head-lines in a recent number of The
Pall Mall Gazette: “Can you name a
Kitten? By Wilfred Whitten.” As
examples for the use of competitors I
give “The Outrage in Delhi. By MARIE
CoRELLI”; “Chatter about Jane Porter.
By C. K. ShortER”; and “Are Dis-
senters Fickle? By Sir Robertson
NicoLL.”
I cannot better close this week's
Comments than by printing a letter
handed on to me by the Editor.
TIBERIUS MUDD.
DEAR SIR,--It is with the most un-
feigned delight that I see we are going
to have a serial by Tiberius Mudd,
entitled “The Cure of Souls.” If there
is an author whose works I admire it is
he. They are so clean, soul-shaking
and winsome.
Yours faithfully, X, Y. Z.

MORE SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
VI.--THE Collector.
WHEN Peter Plimsoll, the Glue King,
died, his parting advice to his sons to
stick to the business was followed
only by John, the elder. Adrian, the
younger, had a soul above adhesion.
He disposed of his share in the concern
and settled down to follow the life of a
gentleman of taste and culture and
(more particularly) patron of the arts.
He began in a modest way by collect-
ing ink-pots. His range at first was
catholic, and it was not until he had
acquired a hundred and forty-seven
ink-pots of various designs that he
decided to make a speciality of historic
ones. This decision was hastened
by the discovery that one of QUEEN
ELIZABETH's inkstands—supposed (by
the owner) to be the identical one with
whose aid she wrote her last letter to
RALEIGH-was about to be put on the
market. At some expense Adrian ob-
tained an introduction, through a third
party, to the owner; at more expense
the owner obtained, through the same
gentleman, an introduction to Adrian;
and in less than a month the great
Elizabeth Ink-pot was safely esta-
blished in Adrian's house. It was the
beginning of the “Plimsoll Collection.”
This was twenty years ago. Let us
to-day take a walk through the gal-
leries of Mr. Adrian Plimsoll's charming
residence, which, as the world knows,
overlooks the park. Any friend of mine
is always welcome at Number Fifteen.
We will start with the North Gallery;
I fear that I shall only have time to
point out a few of the choicest gems.
This is a Pontesiori sword of the
thirteenth century—the only example
of the master's art without any notches.
On the left is a Capricci comfit-box.
If you have never heard of Capricci,
you oughtn't to come to a house like
this.
Here we have before us the historic
de Montigny topaz. Ask your little boy
to tell you about it.
In the East Gallery, of course, the
chief treasure is the Santo di Santo
amulet, described so minutely in his
Windicia Veritatis by John of Flanders.
The original MS. of this book is in
the South Gallery. You must glance
at it when we get there. It will save
you the trouble of ordering a copy
from your library; they would be sure
to keep you waiting. . . .
With some such words as these I
lead my friends round Number Fifteen.
The many treasures in the private parts
of the house I may not show, of course;
the bathroom, for instance, in which
hangs, the finest collection of portraits
of philatelists that Europe can boast.
You must spend a night with Adrian to
be admitted to their company; and, as
one of the elect, I can assure you that
nothing can be more stimulating on a
winter's morning than to catch the eye
of Frisby Dranger, F.Ph.S., behind
the taps as your head first emerges
from the icy waters.
Adrian Plimsoll sat at breakfast, sip-
ping his hot water and crumbling a
dry biscuit. A light was in his eye, a
flush upon his pallid countenance. He
had just heard from a trusty agent that
the Scutori breast-plate had been seen
in Devonshire. His car was ready to
take him to the station.
But alas! a disappointment awaited
him. On close examination the breast-
plate turned out to be a common Risoldo
of inferior working. Adrian left the
house in disgust and started on his
seven-mile walk back to the station.
To complete his misery a sudden storm
came on. Cursing alternately his agent
and Risoldo, he made his way to a
cottage and asked for shelter.
An old woman greeted him civilly
and bade him come in.
“If I may just wait till the storm is
over,” said Adrian, and he sat down in
her parlour and looked appraisingly
(as was his habit) round the room. The
grandfather clock in the corner was
genuine, but he was beyond grandfather
clocks. There was nothing else of any
value: three china dogs and some odd
trinkets on the chimney-piece; a print
or two—
Stay ! What was that behind the
youngest dog?
“May I look at that old bracelet?”
he asked, his voice trembling a little;
and without waiting for permission he
walked over and took up the circle of
tarnished metal in his hands. As he
examined it his colour came and went,
his heart seemed to stop beating. With
a tremendous effort he composed him-
self and returned to his chair.
It was the Emperor's Bracelet !
Of course you know the history of
this most famous of all bracelets. Made
by SPURIUs QUINTUs of Rome in
47 B.C., it was given by CESAR to CLEo-
PATRA, who tried without success to
dissolve it in vinegar. Returning to
Rome by way of ANTONY, it was worn
at a minor conflagration by NERO, after
which it was lost sight of for many
centuries. It was eventually heard of
during the reign of CANUTE (or KNUT,
as his admirers called him); and JoHN
is known to have lost it in the Wash,
whence it was recovered a century after-
wards. It must have travelled thence
to France, for it was seen once in the
possession of Louis XI.; and from there
to Spain, for PHILIP THE HANDsoME
presented it to JoANNA on her wedding
day. Columbus took it to America, but
fortunately brought it back again;
PETER THE GREAT threw it at an in-
different musician ; on one of its later
visits to England Pope wrote a couplet
to it. And the most astonishing thing
in its whole history was that now for
more than a hundred years it had
vanished completely. To turn up again
in a little Devonshire cottage! Werily
truth is stranger than fiction.
“That's rather a curious bracelet of
yours,” said Adrian casually. “My—er
—wife has one just like it which she
asked me to match. Is it an old friend,
or would you care to sell it?”
“My mother gave it me,” said the
old woman, “and she had it from hers.
I don't know no further than that. I
didn't mean to sell it, but * >
“Quite right,” said Adrian, “and,
after all, I can easily get another.”
“But I won't say a bit of money
wouldn't be useful. What would you
think a fair price, Sir? Five shillings?"
Adrian's heart jumped. To get the
Emperor's bracelet for five shillings!
But the spirit of the collector rose
up strong within him. He laughed
kindly.
“My good woman,” he said, “they
turn out bracelets like that in Birming-
ham at two shillings apiece. And quite
new. I'll give you tempence.”
“Make it one-and-sixpence,” she
pleaded. “Times are hard.”
Adrian reflected. He was
strictly speaking, impoverished.
could afford one-and-sixpence.
“One-and-tuppence,” he said.
“No, no, one-and-sixpence,” she re-
peated obstinately.
Adrian reflected again. After all, he
could always sell it for ten thousand
pounds, if the worst came to the worst.
“Well, well,” he sighed. “One-and-
sixpence let it be.”
He counted out the money carefully.
Then, putting the precious bracelet in
his pocket, he rose to go.

Adrian has no relations living now.
When he dies he proposes to leave
the Plimsoll Collection to the nation,
having—as far as he can foresee—no
particular use for it in the next world.
This is really very generous of him,
and no doubt, when the time comes, the
papers will say so. But it is a pity that
he cannot be appreciated properly in
his lifetime. Personally I should like
to see him knighted. A. A. M.
“Wanted from 3 to 500 acres of land for
shooting.”—Advt. in “East Anglian Times.”
He should get the three acres anyway.
“Three acres and a pheasant" is the
birthright of every British sportsman.

Before such excellence I was cowed

you,” she said archly, at the door.
“If you promise not to tell,” I said
to mother's little girl as I returned to
the fireplace, “I’ll have that last piece
of brown bread-and-butter, and you
can have another cup of tea. Shall
We 2''
“Well, perhaps I will have just half
a cup.”
“That makes your fourth,” I re-
minded her. “To-morrow you'll come
out in spots and your complexion will
be ruined. Now it's your turn to
amuse,” I added. “Come, amuse me !
I'm waiting, Josephine. You heard
what your mother said. You know
you're not amusing me properly.”
But in the end it was bound to come
to it; I had to provide my own enter-
tainment.
“The other night I went to the
Maxwells’,” I observed carelessly,
settling back in my chair. Josephine
paused with her cup half-way to her
mouth and looked up in surprise.
“Why, I thought you never went to
dances,” she said.
“I don't, as a rule.” Islipped down
in the chair, prepared to enjoy myself,
and, crossing my legs, gazed wistfully
up at the ceiling. “It was a very
nice dance,” I added. “Won't you
drink up your tea 2 " Josephine buried
her face in it, and for a while silence
ensued. “A very nice dance, indeed,”
I repeated, partly to myself. “Let me
put down your cup for you!”
“Thanks, I can manage.” From
the corner of my eye I watched her
pick up a crumb she was nursing and
carefully put it into the fire. “So
you enjoyed yourself?” she said, still
intent on the crumbs.
“I couldn't very well help it,” I
replied; “I had an adventure. No, I
didn't tread on anyone's frock or
upset the sandwiches, if that's what
you're thinking of. Oh, dear, no!”
“Nothing so conventional, I sup-
pose,” she murmured, “that is, for
you.”
“There was one beautiful young girl
in particular,” I went on affably, “who
took a great fancy to me. The daring
way she- Well, I'm sure people
must have noticed. Dear little girl!"
—and I wafted an airy kiss at the
ceiling.
“Perhaps your tie wasn't straight?”
she suggested.
“No, it wasn't that. And there
were no smuts on my nose, and no one
had been chalking things on my back.
I especially asked Henry, to make sure.
He said it was clearly a case. That's
what your own brother Henry said.”
“I don't believe it,” said Josephine
simply.
“No, neither did I, at first. Come,
be a sportsman, Josephinel Don't
grudge me my little triumphs Shall
I show you how I smiled at her?”
I showed her. She broke into a
loud inconsequent peal of laughter, but
I took out my cigarette-case and waited
patiently for it to subside.
“This isn't a smoking-compartment
—at least, it doesn't say so on the
window, but may I? Have one, too?
No, not that one; he's put his foot
through his nightshirt . . . his little
bedfellow on the right.”
I lit a match for her, and lapsed
again into silence, musing and lazily
blowing smoke rings at the shepherdess
on the mantelpiece.
“She has beautiful dreamy brown
eyes,” I resumed, tenderly stroking my
chin. “Her name's Winnie, short for
Winifred, you know—little Winnie.”
“How nicel” said Josephine. Jose-
phine's eyes are blue.
“Yes, she was,” I agreed; “you'd be
surprised. Give me brown eyes, say I,
for the winter months, at any rate.
And as for her complexion ” Words
failed me for describing her complexion.
“Oh yes, and she has beautiful rich
chestnut hair. Rolls and rolls of it.”
“Really,” said Josephine. Jose-
phine's hair is a summer complete in
itself.
“Yes, I'm very fond of that-coloured
hair. What a pity you don't take
more care of your complexion | I did
tell you her name, didn't I? Pretty
name, Winifred.”
I rolled it round on my tongue
several times, to get the full flavour of
it. The “fred" begins to sound rather
funny at the ninth or tenth time of
saying. Then I added my surname,
to see how it sounded with that. The
combination was distinctly melodious,
tickling the ear.
“Now let us dip into the future,” I
said, when I was tired of repeating it.
I dipped into the future by taking
out an old envelope, writing our two
names on the back of it, and crossing
out the letters common to both. I
quietly handed her the answer.
“There you are. Love on both
Why, what on earth's the matter,
Josephine?”
There was a suspicious noise in her
throat, she had her hands to her eyes,
and her cigarette had fallen to the
floor. Poor jealous Josephine! It was
that bit about the hair that did it ; she
is very proud of her hair. I got up in
alarm and went over to her, but her
hands resisted my efforts to remove
them. -
“Forgive me, Josephine!” I whis-
pered penitently. “I was a brute, and I
was only teasing you, and there isn't
a Winifred at all, or—or anyone. I
didn't mean to . . . at least, I did, but
I didn't think you . . . For Heaven's
sake, don't cry 1”
At that she looked up indignantly,
with one eye, however, still hermetically
closed. -
“I wasn't crying,” she said, “it was
the smoke. It-it went the wrong
way. And, anyhow, I knew there
wasn't a Winifred.” So she said.
I think I did it rather well.

THE SONGSHOP.
THE prospectus of the Songshop, an
institution which is shortly to be
opened in the heart of Bloomsbury,
under the aegis of the Songsmiths'
Friendly Society and in close connection
with The Minstrels' Magazine, has just
reached us and calls for immediate and
sympathetic notice.
The advantages of maintaining a
periodical inconnection witha Songshop
are convincingly driven home in the
prospectus. In The Minstrels' Magazine
they will recommend the public what
to read; in the Songshop they will sell
them what they have recommended.
More than that, however, they are
prepared to afford special facilities to
those anxious to study the art of lyrical
expression under the most favourable
conditions. The premises being most
extensive, rooms will be let at a moder-
ate rate to meritorious minstrels. These
will be known as Nests and will be
equipped with all the necessary imple-
ments of inspiration—hammocks to
provide that gentle motion which is so
essential to metrical utterance; paper
of different vivid colours to fit the
chequered emotions of the singer;
Pierian fountain pens; spring mat-
tresses for spring poets; and a constant
supply of light and phosphorescent
refreshment. , - -
The songs of nightingales, larks,
cuckoos, and other birds associated
with poetic stimulus will be reproduced
faithfully on the gramophone.
Tenants of the Nests will not be
under any compulsion to produce a
fixed number of lines every day, but
they will naturally be expected to throw
in their lot with those who are en-
deavouring to enlarge the borders of
true art. The art of the Songshop will
have nothing to say to sterile formalism,
empty rhetoric, jingling rhymes or flat
heavy blank-verse. Yet the line must
be drawn somewhere; “formlessness
is only permissible when it is absolutely
necessaly,” and the Songsmiths “will
uphold a positive distinction between
prose and verse.”
Lord AvPBURY, who, according to
The Sunday Times, is a contributor to
the January number of The Poetry
Review, has permanently engaged one
of the largest Nests, which is built in
the form of a Beehive, where it is ex-
pected that he will shortly make things
hum. The cuisine of the Songshop
will be under his special charge, and he
has already made a metrical list of the
Hundred Best Cooks, headed with the
motto, “The hand that holds the ladle
rules the world.” Mr.HERBERT TRENCH
the author of the famous Illuminate
Symphony, who has repeatedly been
pronounced by some of the most gifted
press agents to be the greatest living
poet, will be attached to the institution
as Polychromatic Adviser, and Mr.
PARIs SINGER, Mr. WILKIE BARD, Mrs.
ORMiston CHANT and Mr. HENRY BIRD
will, it is hoped, form a House Com-
mittee, whose special duty will be to
watch over the warblers and, when
necessary, extricate them from pre-
carious metrical positions.

SNAPDRAGON.
Long ago, long ago in the land of Shan-tung,
When the world was attractive and magic and young,
Mid the mild pterodactyls the Snapdragon slew,
And his breath was a flame of hot yellow and blue;
He'd pounce, where they played with their primitive
toys,
Upon }. little raisin-faced Chinaman boys,
And he'd swoop with a snap, as they combed out their
curls,
Upon fat little almond-eyed Chinaman girls;
And in fact he went on in so tiresome a way
That the greatest of Chams became filled with dismay,
And he said, “Lest the Snapdragon guzzle and gorge
Every kid in our kingdom, let's send for St. GEORGE | "
The Saint soon appeared, riding stately and slow,
On a charger as white as the new-driven snow;
His shield it was silver, his lance tough and strong,
And his two-handed sword most prodigiously long;
But his face it was gentle and merry and kind,
The best sort of face for a fighter, you'll find,
And he pulled on his helmet and tightened a strap,
And he cried, “Where's the dragon who calls himself
Snap?”
Then the dragon rushed out and the dust and the din
Of the combat was carried as far as Pekin,
Till the Saint hammered home his most useful of smacks
And the Snapdragon whimpered, “ST. GEORGE, let's
have paa 1"
“All right,” said ST.GEORGE, for he wasn't, you know,
The sort to be hard on a well-hammered foe;
Still, the dragon despondently hung down his head,
Being frightfully sick at the life that he'd led;
So the Saint thought a minute and then waved his sword
And the kids who'd been eaten were safely restored
As jolly as ever; the Snapdragon said
He would live for the future on brown gingerbread
To show he was sorry and, if it would please,
He would come—as a waiter—to holiday teas.
This task he performed with most pious complaisance,
Though he always would hand round the almonds and
ralSins,
Which in consequence often appeared in a blaze,
For his breath was blue fire till the end of his days I
And after his death at a hundred-and-three,
When almonds and raisins were served after tea,
In the land of Shan-tung it was proper and right
To call them Snapdragon and serve them alight!

BUT for the scenery, which was

that we were dealing with Continentals,
so British was the humour, so true to

of France and Switzerland that
the most engaging episode of
the evening occurred, when
Monte Blanco (Mr. G E org E
GRAves), who had for eighteen
years been established in this
spot as a scarecrow (on a more
military frontier such an object
would almost certainly have
attracted suspicion), recovered
his ducal identity.

“Principal Boy,” should, by all that is
sacred in tradition, have been a girl,
but actually 'he was Mr. DouTHITT.
Excellent in voice, he looked a little too
stalwart for the part. One expected a
resounding smack when he kissed the
lady out of her sleep; and a response
on her side—
“O love, thy kiss would wake the dead!”
But then one had to remember that his
foster-parents were rustic, and that he
had been brought up as a gardener.
The Princess made a pleasant point of .
this, while still ignorant of his lofty
pedigree. “The first lady of the land,”
she said, “married a gardener.” An
admirable precedent, and, as we know,
“From yon blue heavens above us bent
The gardener Adam and his wife
Smile at the claims of long descent.”
I was very sorry indeed for him
when the malevolence of Anarchista,
the Wicked Fairy, turned him into an
appallingly hairy monster. (Was it
the Tatcho of Mr. SIMs, part-author,
that did it?) Here the pathos and the
grotesqueness of things rubbed a little
against one another. But it brought
love to the test. For it was the loyalty
of the Princess in these trying circum-
stances that secured his restoration.
Such was the pretty rule in Faërie,
where Puck set forth the law that these
restorations can only occur through an
act of human intervention.
The slight and graceful Princess
(Miss FLORENCE SMITHson) lacked
something of the sentimentality of
the habitual heroine of pantomime;
but she got well home to the hearts of
her audience by the refinement of her
singing. The chief honours, how-
ever, went again to little Miss RENEE
MAYER. She could not be expected
to have voice enough for the part of
Chorus, but there was an instinctive
grace in all her movements, and
whenever she appeared—an unfailing
promise of some good change coming—
she brought with her an exquisite air
of romance.
I feel for Mr. ARTHUR Collins, upon
whom the necessity of surpassing him-
self must put a heavy annual strain.
To say that he has done it this time
would be to compromise his past record.
But every year, one seems to detect a
surer feeling for subdued harmonies,
a nicer distaste for resonance and
glare. The dim light on the great
Garden scene was very beautiful, and,
for contrast, the high colours of “The
Blue Lagoon,” were proper enough to
the hard brilliance of Lake Geneva–
or whatever it was. -
As for the fun—vires acquiret eundo:
and the same may be hopefully said of
some of the dancing, which needed more
rehearsals; but meanwhile I carried
away (some time, I fear, before the end,
for I am past the age when even the
best pantomime is an adequate solace
for the loss of both dinner and supper)
a vivid impression of some very en-
trancing pictures, of an amazing smooth-
ness in the work of the scene-shifters,
of the most fascinating of Pucks, the
most genial of humorous Dukes, and
Mr. BARRY LUPINo (Finnykin) in a golfing
suit, as worn on the Franco-Swiss frontier.
the handsomest Wicked Fairy (in the
person of Miss ALICE CHARTREs) that
ever mitigated the charms of Malice by
the beauty of her own. O. S.
“SHOCK-HEADED PETER."
Why it was I do not know, but as
a child I certainly owed nothing to
Struwwelpeter. Though we all read it,
our reception of it was mild, and it
was never the family book that, say,
Uncle Remus became. As a result I
could only remember, when I grew up,
that Augustus was a chubby lad, and
that Fidgety Phil couldn't keep still.
So I cannot say whether this children's
play by PHILIP CARR and NIGEL PLAY-
FAIR (as given every afternoon at the
Vaudeville) is calculated to shock the
elect or not. Obviously it does not
shock me. I do not mind at all that
Philip and Augustus and Peter and
Harriet should be made to belong to
one father, when perhaps they weren't
even related in the original version. I
have no feelings about any of them.
What does concern me is that these
four bad children should be played
so delightfully by Messrs. CoMPTON-
CouTTs, Edward RIGBY, EDMUND
GwenN, and Miss NELLIE Bowman,
and that they should have had such a
thoroughly happy and wicked time.
Pleasant too it was to hear again such
childish expressions as “Bags I” and
“Beastly swizzle"—they, at any rate,
owed nothing to the German. (But,
dear Authors, surely we used to say
“Fain I,” and not “Fains I,” when
we wished to get out of anything un-
pleasant? That extra “s" gave me
uite a turn.)
The little play is admirably staged.
There is a very sound storm which
carries off Peter on the crook of Harriet's
umbrella, and a realistic burning-up of
Harriet (who played with matches)
which is positively terrifying. Indeed,
it was only the calmness of the children
round me which kept me in my seat
during these calamities. -
Shock-Headed Peter is preceded by
some old English singing-games and

These were altogether charming. There
is one particular singing-game called
“The Roman Soldiers” which took my
fancy entirely. I wonder if I could
introduce it into Bouverie Street.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Little Thank You, which Messrs. PUTNAM
publish for Mrs. T. P. O'Connor, is a charming
idyll. It presents a sunny picture of Virginia
after the war, but at a period so close to the
epoch-making event that we catch many
glimpses of home life in “ole Virginny.” The
hero of the story is a small boy who, after
the occasional manner of his kind, dominates
the domestic circle of which he is the centre.
It would be easy to make such an one a per-
sistent bore. Mrs. O'Connor handles her
subject so gently and with such skill that the
reader, inclined at the outset to be repelled, is
conquered, and pays court with the rest. The
characters in the little drama are few, but
without exception are admirably drawn. The
old negro nurse, probably taken from life, is
delightful. Jimps, the dog, is in his way
equally good. It is the sort of book that is
especially attuned to the Christmas mood.
Those who did not find the opportunity of
reading it in the already passed holiday-time
may take my word for it that its perusal will
brighten the New Year.
One of the most agreeable entertainments
that I have encountered this great while is
The Unbearable Bassington (John LANE). By
now one has, of course, grown to expect verbal
dexterities from Mr. H. H. MUNRo (“SAKI"),
and in the present volume one certainly gets
them, and something more. The book is in
fact a pudding in which the greatest possible
number of plums are held together by the
barest modicum of suet—with the natural
result that, taken in bulk, the mixture may be
found cloying. In small portions, say three
chapters to a meal, you can not only enjoy it
delightedly yourself, but even compel the
appreciation of those to whom you will be
unable to resist reading the choicest bits
aloud. Than this, of which I have made per-
sonal test, there can surely be no greater
tribute to such a book. Only considerations of
space restrain me from quoting its best things
now. There is one chapter that contains
the most brilliant exhibition of conversational
fireworks since The Importance of Being
Earnest. But inevitably they are of different

degrees of sparkle. Not only does one get
the rather mechanical humour which describes a man's
beard as “lending a certain dignity to his appearance
—a loan which the rest of his features were continually
repudiating,” but on the same page we read, “One should
always speak guardedly of the Opposition leaders; one never
knows what a turn in the situation may do for them,”
with the added remark, in reply to obvious comment, “I
mean they may one day lead the opposition.” This seems
to me the genuine article; and, if you like it, and ever so
much more that at its worst is always smart and at its best
witty, you will find with me The Unbearable Bassington
very bearable indeed.
There can be no question about it, Mrs. HENRY DE LA
PASTURE (Lady CLIFFoRD) has made a very delicate and
telling study of her Erica and the down-trodden Lady Clow,
and the odds and ends of people who are involved in Erica's
affairs. The hapless Tom Garry, who married her, is less
convincing, being a trifle too stagnant for a young Guards-
man; but he is a good enough background for the finely-
shaded picture of his wife. As so often happens in real life,
one thing after another occurred in their existence; and
again, as so often happens in real life, these incidents were
just incidents and led up to no particular crisis or dénoue-
ment. They were interesting in themselves, severally and
apart, and in the telling of them the author, as shrewd and
observant as ever, finds many an opportunity of expounding
her simple and genial philosophy. Meanwhile, Tom Garry
bore with his wife very patiently for a while, lost his
illusions of her one by one, and ultimately died before the
birth of his son. And there you have Erica (SMITH ELDER).

I have to make against

that Percival, its hero,

Indeed, I had good
reason to think that
Mr. A. S. M. HuTehi N-
son, whose first novel,
Once Aboard the Lugger,
was such an unquali-
fied success, intended
to waste his 'talent
upon a psychological
study of a vulgar wo-
man, but now I know
that even if he makes
a false start he is only
getting up steam for
something absolutely
fresh and original. The
plot of this story
{breathless after page
93) is very slight, for,
guard, and Cameron's
, three encounters with him make a stout yarn. The police are
the finest of fine fellows, a breed of demigods—five hundred
of them effectively patrolling the frontiers of an Empire.
The time is in the eighties, just before the Indian Rebellion
in Western Canada. I should like to have had more of
the hero's Scotch friends, who are introduced with some
circumstance and incontinently and unwisely abandoned—
Dunn, the Scotch International captain; Mr. Rae, the
lawyer with the disconcerting smile; Miss Brodie, and
Cameron's sister Moira, bonnie lassies both.
In The Trinity Foot Beagles (ARNoLD), Mr. F. C. KEMP-
son has compiled a history of the well-known pack which,
under the management of undergraduates, has for more
than fifty years hunted hares over the heavy soil of Cam-
bridgeshire. Mr. KEMPson is, I gather, a parson of the
sporting sort, and he declares himself to be an “hereditary
Barbarian,” meaning that he is devoted to field sports as
opposed to games, which are pursued, he says, by Philis-
tines. But Mr. KEMPson, I further gather, has been a
rowing man, and he is therefore in the supreme position of
being both a Barbarian and a Philistine. The book is put
together, if I may say so, in a somewhat disconnected way;
although the vulgar
woman thinks that she is a peeress, and contrives a great
future for her amiable but effeminate son, the reader knows
that the hero is really the peer. Not, however, until the
end of the book is Percival aware of his rank, and by
that time he has formed a warm affection for the pseudo-
peer, and has also “made things hum.” Chafing under
the restraints of village life he joined a kind of travelling
show, and while living this roving existence he won the most
glorious fight. “One of the real ones, one of the clean
breds, one of the true-blues, one of the all-rights, one of the
get-there, stop-there, win-there—one o' the picked"—is the
description given to Percival, and I am very content to
leave him at that. To those who are prepared to overlook
the author's false start (I am sorry to be so insistent about
that, but I resent those initial pages) and to step off the
soundly beaten track of commonplace fiction, I most warmly
recommend Mr. Hutch INsoN and his Happy Warrior.

second class would show up the bishops better.

THE PREMIER AND THE BIRD.
[Reflections on a soft Winter; with acknow-
ledgments to his friend, Mr. W. BEACH
THOMAS.]
Now any morning you may hear,
Before the pinks of dawn appear,
Where on the sombre boughs they sit,
Mavis and robin, wren and tit,
Piping their introductory bars
Without respect of calendars;
And, what is worse, without regard
To the convenience of the bard,
Caught napping in the New Year's
prime
All unprepared with vernal rhyme.
These hints, which early birds convey,
That this is now the month of May
Are of a rudimentary kind,
Appealing to the common mind.
But there are other marks, not missed
By the accomplished ruralist—
More subtle signs, half hidden from us,
That don't escape my friend, BEACH
THOMAs.
Thus, in his rambles round the place,
His beady orbs have marked a brace
Of slugs—a most unusual thing—
Strolling about as though 'twere Spring;
Also a snail (he noticed that)
Taking the air without its hat.
Likewise of flowers he makes report
Citing the more precocious sort.
With piercing glance he clapped his eye
On
The undefeated Dandelion,
Fool's Parsley, nauseous to the nose,
Dead Nettle and the rathe Primrose.
By wooded walks and hedgerow ways he
Chatted with Kex and modest Daisy,
With Shepherd's Purse and Periwinkle
And Canterbury Bells a-tinkle,
And, quoting Wordsworth, line by line,
Lunched with the Lesser Celandine.
Further he saw a roomy nest,
Fruit of a gay cock-sparrow's zest,
Built for his young fiancée's use;
And, should the Winter keep its truce,
Our THOMAS, in a week or so,
Should hail the swallow's Northward
Ho!
And in his note-book scribble, “Hark!
I hear the cuckoo's opening bark!”
Alas for faith that meets the shock
Of disillusion's nasty knock,
Of frosts that blight the ardent blood
And a sad nipping in the bud
Yet how can simple bird or plant
Help making these mistakes? They
can't.
Innocent little dears, that lack
A knowledge of the Almanack,
And think that, like last Summer

Sometimes commit a like mistake—

. BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
NEw YEAR's NEws.
West Boggleshire Manor.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-Here, at Bosh
and Wee-Wee's, we've been having a
lovely time out with the West Boggle-
shire—positively the one and only
motor-hunt We all follow in motors,
and the quarry is a motor-fox l Bosh,
who's Master, is naturally very proud
of it. He says it was the only way
out of the difficulties made by those
absurd farmer-people, with their com-
plaints about their silly poultry being
eaten. Our motor-fox gives us simply
glorious runs, and then when hounds
break him up he can quite easily be put
together again. If anyone earns the
brush it's just unhooked and handed
to him (or her), and then it's hooked
on again. By next season Bosh says
perhaps he'll have a pack of motor-
hounds as well.
If we were men, dearest, I'd say,
“Hats off to Lady Manoeuvrer!” for
really and truly she is a clever woman,
et elle connait son monde as well as any
of us, and better than most. This is
a preface to the news that one of the
twins is actually—but wait
Marigold and Bluebell, as you know,
what with their height, their twin-
hood, their constant rushing round and
chattering about nothing, their ever-
lasting, “Oh, isn't it absolutely top-
hole !” and their mother's strenuous
efforts on their behalf, have been, for
quite several years now, a sort of
double landmark, poor dear things!
(It was Norty who first called them
Reculvers.) Well, last July, when every-
body left town, the Manoeuvrers went
to rusticate in some remote spot, and
nothing more was heard of them till
one began to meet them again in the
autumn at country houses. And then,
my dear, one noticed a change. Mari-
gold, it appeared, had retired from
business and made over her share of
the joint stock-in-trade, the high spirits,
rushing round, chattering about nothing,
and “Oh, isn't it absolutely top-hole!”
to Bluebell. She was quiet, silent, pré-
occupée, wore a diamond marquise on
her left third, and a dreamy, always-
thinking-of-him expression on her face.
There she sat, twirling her ring and
smiling to herself. And several men
who before had scarcely seemed aware
of her existence became quite épris of
her in this altered state of things, and
made immense efforts to get her to
talk and laugh as she used; but they
were answered either at random or not
at all.
Of course Marigold was asked about
her engagement, but all she would ever
say was, “We’re going to keep our
little romance quite to ourselves. We
don't want it spoiled by being an-
nounced in the papers and gossiped to
rags by all of you. He's gone back to
his duties in India and he'll be coming
home by-and-by, and that's all you're
any of you going to know!”.
Of those who fancied the idea of cut-
ting out this absent hero of romance, the
chief was the Duke of Derwent, whom
the Manoeuvrers gave up in despair ages
ago. Derwent, who never yet wanted
anything unless it belonged to some-
body else, was quite in the first flight
of Marigold's new-found soupirants and
by degrees became utterly and entirely
set upon eclipsing the Absent One.
The more Marigold wouldn't pay any
attention to what he said and the more
she sat in corners twirling her ring and
dreaming, the more Derwent persisted,
till at last, when they were both at the
Dunstables' with a large party, he
succeeded in persuading her to forget
“the other fellow ’’ and elope.
They went to town, and were married
“on the 20th of December, suddenly, at
the Registrar's,” as Norty put it. Of
course, when the knot was fast tied,
Derwent was sorry. But there was
still a drop of sweetness in his cup.
“How long will it be before that other
fellow knows you've shunted him and
found someone you like better?” he
asked with a chuckle when the 'moon
was about a week old. His new duchess
flung her arms round his neck. “Oh,
Bobby darling,” she yelled, for all and
more than all her old high spirits had
come back, “you're the only man in
the world for me. There's no ‘other
fellow,’ and there never was 1 It was

Talking of runaway marriages,
there's quite a small slump just now
in regular, conventional, white satin
and orange - blossom functions—St.
Agatha's and half-a-dozen bishops,
church crowded, everybody there—and
people are taking to sneaking off to
some weird church in the City or the
suburbs and being married without a
sound. The Oldlands went to town
last week for the wedding of Veronica,
the eldest girl—quite a nice match, with
everyone's approval. The afternoon
before the marriage-day, when every-
body in town was at Oldlands House
for the “Wedding Present Tea,” in
walked to-morrow's bride and groom
in travelling kit. “Awfully sorry,
people,” said Veronica, “that you've
all been asked to the show to-morrow,
because there won't be one ! Teddy
and I were married this morning at
St. Hildred's, Islington, and we're off
now to Friesenberg for the ski-ing.”
Oh, my dearest and best, such a
simply horrid thing has happened here !
I'm afraid '13 will be a most odious
year for your poor Blanchel On New
Year's Eve we were all enormously
careful about the proper observances—
13 being such a sinister number. Bosh
said he'd tried to get some hunchbacks
to meet us, but all the hunchbacks were
engaged ages . for the New Year !
Josiah, who 's abroad on business, sent
me a wire during the evening with such
stodgy, Victorian wishes for the New
Year that we all quite shrieked over it.
As midnight approached we looked
about for our First Foot. The darkest
man in the party was a Col. Briggs,
whom Bosh and Wee-Wee met abroad
somewhere last year. He had black
hair and moustaches. He didn't seem
enthusiastic about the job, but at five
minutes to twelve we sent him out at a
side door, and the front door was set
open to let in the New Year and the
First Foot. Then we danced the St.
Sylvester's waltz, with the dear old
custom of one's partner saluting one
as midnight begins to strike. Someone
said the salute should be given at the
first stroke of midnight, and someone
else said it should be given at the last
stroke. Norty said they'd better make
sure of being right by giving it at each
stroke And so we danced, and mid-
night struck, and the bells of West
Boggleshire church rang out, and the
Briggs man came in, and we all wished
each other everything nice. -
Next day, when some of us were
chatting it over, someone said suddenly,
“I wonder if the Briggs man is really
dark!” “But what a hideous thought!"
I cried. And then a sort of panic
seized us. Piggy de Lacey suggested,
“I might get my fellow to ask his man.
But it wouldn't be quite cricket,
would it 2 ” “Never mind that,” we
all gasped; “our happiness, our very
lives depend upon it. Go, best of
Piggies, and find out.” And Piggy

MORE SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
VII.--THE ADVENTURER.
Lionel Norwood, from his earliest
days, had been marked out for a life
of crime. When quite a child he was
discovered by his nurse killing flies on
the window-pane. This was before the
character of the house-fly had become
a matter of common talk among
scientists, and Lionel (like all great
men, a little before his time) had
pleaded hygiene in vain. He was
smacked hastily and bundled off to a
preparatory school, where his aptitude
for smuggling sweets would have lost
him many a half-holiday had not his
services been required at outside-left
in the hockey eleven. With some
difficulty he managed to pass into
Eton, and three years later—with, one
would imagine, still more difficulty—
managed to get superannuated. At Cam-
bridge he went down-hill rapidly. He
would think nothing of smoking a cigar
in academical costume, and on at least
one occasion he drove a dogcart on
Sunday. No wonder that he was re-
quested, early in his second year, to give
up his struggle with the Little-go and
betake himself back to London.
London is always glad to welcome
such people as Lionel Norwood. In no
other city is it so simple for a man of
easy conscience to earn a living by his
wits. If Lionel ever had any scruples
(which, after a perusal of the above
account of his early days, it may be
permitted one to doubt) they were re-
moved by an accident to his solicitor,
who was run over in the Argentine on
the very day that he arrived there with
what was left of Lionel's money. Re-
duced suddenly to poverty, Norwood
had no choice but to enter upon a
life of crime.
Except, perhaps, that he used
slightly less hair-oil than most, he
seemed just the ordinary man about
town as he sat in his dressing-gown
one fine summer morning and smoked
a cigarette. His rooms were furnished
quietly and in the best of taste. No
signs of his nefarious profession showed
themselves to the casual visitor. The
appealing letters from the Princess
whom he was blackmailing, the wire
apparatus which shot the two of spades
down his sleeve during the coon-can
nights at the club, the thimble and pea
with which he had performed the three-
card trick so successfully at Epsom last
week—all these were hidden away from
the common gaze. It was a young
gentleman of fashion who lounged in
his chair and toyed with a priceless
straight-cut.
There was a tap at the door, and
Masters, his confidential valet, came in.
“Well,” said Lionel, “have you
looked through the post?”
“Yes, Sir,” said the man. “There's
the usual cheque from Her Highness,
a request for more time from the lady
in Tite Street with twopence to pay on
the envelope, and banknotes from the
Professor as expected. The young
gentleman of Hill Street has gone
abroad suddenly, Sir.”
“Ah!” said Lionel, with a sudden
frown. “I suppose you'd better cross
him off our list, Masters.”
“Yes, Sir. I had ventured to do so,
Sir. I think that's all, except that Mr.
Snooks is glad to accept your kind
invitation to dinner and bridge to-night.
Will you wear the hair-spring coat, Sir,
or the metal clip 2"
Lionel made no answer. He sat
plunged in thought. When he spoke
it was about another matter.
“Masters,” he said, “I have found
out Lord Fairlie's secret at last. I
shall go to see him this afternoon.”
“Yes, Sir. Will you wear your
revolver, Sir, as it 's a first call 2 ''
“I think so. If this comes off,
Masters, it will make our fortune.”
“I hope so, I'm sure, Sir.” Masters
placed the whisky within reach and
left the room silently.
Alone, Lionel picked up his paper
and turned to the Agony Column.
As everybody knows, the Agony
Column of a daily paper is not actually
so domestic as it seems. When
“MoTHER” apparently says to “FLoss,”
“Come home at once. Father gone
away for week. Bert and Sid longing
to see you,” what is really happening
is that Barney Hoker is telling Jud
Batson to meet him outside the Duke
of Westminster's little place at 3 A.M.
precisely on Tuesday morning, not
forgetting to bring his jemmy and a
dark lantern with him. And FLoss's
announcement next day, “Coming
home with George,” is Jud's way of
saying that he will turn up all right,
and half thinks of bringing his auto-
matic pistol with him too, in case of
accidents.
In this language—which, of course,
takes some little learning — Lionel
Norwood had long been an expert.
The advertisement which he was now
reading was unusually elaborate:
“Lost, in a taxi between Baker
Street and Shepherd's Bush, a gold-
mounted umbrella with initials “J. P.”
on it. If Ellen will return to her father
immediately all will be forgiven. White
spot on foreleg. Mother very anxious
and desires to return thanks for kind
enquiries. Answers to the name of
Ponto. Bis dat qui cito dat.”
What did it mean 2 For Lionel it
had no secrets. He was reading the
revelation by one of his agents of the
skeleton in Lord Fairlie's cupboard'
Lord Fairlie was one of the most
distinguished members of the Cabinet,
His vein of high seriousness, his
lofty demeanour, the sincerity of his
manner endeared him not only to his
own party, but even (astounding as it
may seem) to a few high-minded men
upon the other side, who admitted,
in moments of expansion which they
probably regretted afterwards, that he
might, after all, be as devoted to his
country as they were. For years now
his life had been without blemish. It
was impossible to believe that even in
his youth he could have sown any
wild oats; terrible to think that these
wild oats might now be coming home
to roost.
“What do you require of me?” he
said courteously to Lionel, as the latter
was shown into his study.
Lionel went to the point at once.
“I am here, my lord,” he said, “on
business. In the course of my ordinary
avocations”—the parliamentary at-
mosphere seemed to be affecting his
language—“I ascertained a certain
secret in your past life which, if it were
revealed, might conceivably have a not
undamaging effect upon your career.
For my silence in this matter I must
demand a sum of fifty thousand pounds.”
Lord Fairlie had grown paler and
paler as this speech proceeded.
“What have you discovered 2" he
whispered. Alas! he knew only too
well what the damning answer would be.
“Twenty years ago,” said Lionel,
“you wrote a humorous book.”
Lord Fairlie gave a strangled cry.
His keen mind recognised in a flash what
a hold this knowledge would give his
enemies. Shafts of Folly, his book
had been called. Already he saw the
leading articles of the future:— t
“We confess ourselves somewhat at
a loss to know whether Lord Fairlie's
speech at Plymouth yesterday was
intended as a supplement to his earlier
work, Shafts of Folly, or as a serious
offering to a nation impatient of levity
in such a crisis. . . .”
“The Cabinet's jester, in whom
twenty years ago the country lost an
excellent clown without gaining a states-
man, was in great form last night. . . .”
“Lord Fairlie has amused us in the
past with his clever little parodies; he
may amuse us in the future; but as a
statesman we can only view him with
“Well ?” said Lionel at last. “I
think your lordship is wise enough to
understand. The discovery of a sense of
humour in a man of your eminence—”
But Lord Fairlie was already writing
out the cheque. A. A. M.

Householder (awakened). “What THE- Oh, Lond Another CHRISTMAS-Box, I suppose?”
THE winter spoRTSMAN.
My wife, my Oxford son, my daughters three
(Named Mary, Ralph, Iseult, Elaine and Nesta)
Have flown off to the Engadine to ski
And skate and risk their limbs upon the Cresta,
Their view of life, so far as I can see,
Being to make it one continual festa;
While I, the patient drudge in duty's mill,
Remain in town and drive the daily quill.
Think not, however, that I mean to “make
A song about it,” piteously appealing
For sympathy because my children take
Their walks abroad while I remain at Ealing;
I haven't got a “travel-thirst" to slake;
Davos no more attracts me than Darjeeling;
I loathe the cold; hotels are uninviting;
And, lastly, London's hugely more exciting.
There's not a crossing but some taxi-cab
May start you running for your life and floor you.
There's not a 'bus but women try to jab
Their horrid hatpins in your face and gore you;
The skies, I own, are dull, the outlook drab,
But here the human beings never bore you,
With militants who war on all in trousers,
And Letts who run amok with murderous Mausers.
Here not a week can pass completely by
Without a missive from some moneylenders
Offering me untold gold—I know not why;
I just return it stampless to the senders;
Wine-merchants for my custom daily vie
With cider-makers or with whisky-blenders,
As keen about replenishing my cellars
As if I were the best of RockefellERs.
Then as for games, why should I search for sport
In the vicinity of Chiavenna,
When I can to the gallery resort
And see Tartaric Tim give “Shawn "Gehenna,
Or hear the Taffies truculently snout
Defiance at the maladroit McKENNA,
Or watch the daily cranial distension
Of Ministers whose names I need not mention?
Moreover, here, and here alone, one knows
The joy of tasting Mr. GARVIN's leaders,
Fresh and red-hot, as forth the lava flows
And scarifies all Unionist seceders,
Or proves the triumph that awaits our foes
If we become a nation of free-feeders.
(They get them two days later up at Sils,
But there they miss his name upon the bills.)
You'll say the grapes are sour. Perhaps they are.
The point is personal and matters little.
I only know that Switzerland is far;
That bobsleighs seem to me extremely kittle;
That falls, on ski or skates, the system jar,
And bones, when men are elderly, grow brittle;
And, if I must take part in a gymkhana,
Let it be held in London, not Montana.

THE PARTY.
“WHAT,” I said, “is this rumour about a party 2”
“Rumour?” said Francesca. “I have heard no rumours.
And, if it comes to that, what is a rumour?”
“A rumour,” I said, “is evidently something which you
know you have not heard. It therefore follows that if you
heard it you would recognise it, and, that being so, you
must know what it is, for otherwise—”
“For otherwise,” she said, “I should know what I don't
know, and I should not be expected to wait here half the
morning in order to answer idle questions.”
“Since the word 'rumour' gives you pain,” I said, “I
will withdraw it, expressing at the same time my most
sincere regret at having said anything which might—”
(Loud cheers, in which the conclusion of the hon, member's
sentence was lost). “But what,” I added, “is all this about
a party?”
“A party?” she said. “Who has said anything about a
party? What can you mean?”
“Francesca,” I said with determination, “I will be plain
with you x -
“No, no,” she interrupted, “not that. But, after all,
why should I complain? Good looks are nothing.”
“Good looks,” I said, “are better than a ribald tongue.”
“But some people,” she said, “have got both, and that
must be splendid for them.”
“Evasions,” I said, “will not help you. What is all this
about a party on Saturday next?”
“Oh, that,” said Francesca. “If that's what you mean,
why couldn't you say it before ?”
* Apparently,” I said, “that is what I mean; and I have
been saying it over and over again since I began.”
“You should guard,” she said, “against repetition.
is wearisome and unnecessary.”
“What is the nature,” I said, “of next Saturday's party?”
“Its nature is that it isn't really a party at all. If I
said it was I have deceived you. It is a children's dance.”
“But a children's dance,” I urged, “is a party. It has
all the qualities that distinguish a party. It causes
It
inconvenience. It gives no enjoyment.”
“You couldn't persuade the children of that. Tell them
it's not to come off, and see what they say.”
“Poor dears,” I said, “they are ignorant. It would be
useless to appeal to them. But, if they enjoy it, why are
they so solemn and silent? Tell me that.”
“Oh that's only at first,” said Francesca. “If you
come into this room after they've been at it half-an-hour
you'll find them enjoying it all right.”
“Into this room?” I said. “Francesca, you are forgetting
yourself. This is my room.”
“Of course it is; and it's the largest room in the house,
and much the best for dancing; and you're going to lend it
to us for that day, like a generous true-hearted British
father.”
“And,” I said, “all the furniture will be taken out and
all my papers will be disturbed and lost, and the carpet
will be removed, and the books will be put into the shelves
in their wrong places. Is this what you propose 2"
“Something like that,” she said, “will probably happen.
You wouldn't have them dance in all this litter.”
“I wouldn't have them dance at all,” I said. “Francesca,
I forbid the moving of my writing-table.”
“The writing-table,” she said, “will be the first to go.
But you talk as if you'd heard of all this for the first time.”
“And that,” I said, “is the solemn truth. No man in
England is less easily surprised than—me or I; which is it,
Francesca 2"
“And,” she said, “you don't even know your grammar.
To think that an ungrammatical man should dream of
stopping a children's dance.”
“I will circumvent the grammar,” I said. “I am the
least easily surprised man in England, but to-day, I own,
you have startled me. Not one word of this dance have I
ever heard whispered or 1 y
“No,” she said, “you haven't. Every day for the past
three weeks I've shouted it at you.”
“Your gentle nature would never permit you to shout,”
I said. “But I do remember that some time ago you said
quite casually that it would be a nice thing for the children
to have a dance.”
“There you are,” said Francesca; “didn't I say so?”
“And I replied that this modern craze——”
“I know perfectly well what you replied. It did you no
credit and you mustn't say it again.”
“And from that moment,” I went on, “you have, I
suppose, been stealthily planning this dance. And Muriel
and Nina and Alice were in the conspiracy, of course. But
what of Frederick, my little five-year-old barbarian 2 How
did you secure his silence? Surely he cannot approve of
dancing?”
“The barbarian mind,” she said, “is susceptible to the
promise of ices. He believes that on Saturday a world
entirely composed of ices is to be at his disposal. You
had better resign yourself to the dance.”
“Francesca,” I said, “something dreadful ought to happen
to you.”
“Something dreadful,” she said, “has happened.”
“I know,” I said. “The man who plays the piano has
got the influenza.” -
“Worse than that.”
“The greengrocer has sprained his ankle and cannot come
in to pour out lemonade.”
“Worse even than that,” she said. “Your Aunt Matilda,
who likes children in their proper place, has announced
herself for a three days' visit from Friday next.”
“Which serves you,” I said, “absolutely right.”
“And, of course,” said Francesca, “you will have to
devote yourself to her on Saturday. After all, she has a
kind nature in spite of her sharp tongue, poor old dear.”

BY THE OPPOSITE ROUTE.
WHEN he was called he turned over and went to sleep
again. When he got up he decided that he would get
himself shaved professionally on his way to the office.
He read the newspaper solidly through breakfast. On
two occasions he contradicted his wife. He took the odd
piece of toast. In putting on his boots he swore quite
wantonly (on the testimony of his wife).
He continued the day in the same strain of dogged laxity.
At lunch he prolonged his usual interval of ninety minutes
to one of a hundred-and-twenty minutes. By 5 P.M. he had
smoked six cigars.
Then he telephoned to his wife to come and have dinner
in town and go to a theatre, knowing that she would refuse.
He thereupon carried out his programme en garçon, in the
teeth of her imperfectly transmitted resentment.
Arriving home, he had a last unnecessary whisky and
soda. Finally (as he tramped upstairs in his boots) he
murmured with satisfaction, “Now you know what to
expect, New Year!”
On the 2nd of January he returned inevitably — like
everyone else—to the happy human mean of moderate im-
perfection. But-contrary to everyone else—he had the
satisfaction of feeling that he was being a better man than
he had set out to be.

PUNCH, OR
FLIGHTING.
DEEP the ditch and very muddy,
And the time seems very long;
There's a sunset wild and ruddy,
The West roars a song;
And the dusk is just a-falling
And it's lonesome as can be
Ere the geese come in a-calling
Off the cold wet sea l
Yes, ’tis lonesome in the ditches
(Where's the whistle of the wings?)
And the dusk is full of witches
And of Big Black Things;
Funk, blue funk for him who strikes it
Has the bogey-haunted bog,
And the only one who likes it
Is a red wet dog!
He 's a-twitch to hear the whicker
Of the pinions down the sky,
While the ghosts they bawl and bicker
And the gusts boom by:
And you pat him for protection—
Ah, you hardly would suppose
So much comfort and affection
In a cold wet nose!
Hark, the gaggle / Up the gun, then—
'Twas the neatest left-and-right;
“Fetch 'em, boy, and we’ll be done, then,
Two's enough to-night;
Leave the shadows to their sinking,
Leave the ghosts their howling glee,
It's yourself that will be thinking
Of your hot wet tea!”
AFTERMAS.
A PROJECT is on foot, supported by
a number of influential tradesmen, to
inaugurate a New Season of present-
giving, supplementary to Christmas
and New Year's Day, to be called
Aftermas. It will, it is believed, fill a
long-felt want.
The origin of Aftermas is the disap-
pointment with her own gifts recently
experienced by a well-known Society
lady of viewing those of her fellow
guests in a country house at Yule-tide.
“Why,” she exclaimed, “you seem
to have received everything that I
really wanted i’’
“But,” was the natural reply, “were
you not asked what you would like?”
“I was,” she said, “but I couldn't
for the life of me think. Now I know.”
This charming person had struck on
a basic truth of life, namely that envy
is stronger than choice, and it is this
fundamental human foible which the
New Season will do much to satisfy.
The root idea of Aftermas is the
giving of the presents which we know
beyond question that our friends will
like. Everyone will admit that Christ-
mas and New Year's Day rarely leave
us with the best things; Aftermas will

do so. To some extent, it may be urged,
New Year's Day ought to do so now,
since it is a week later than Christmas.
But as a matter of practical politics
this is not so. Christmas itself is a
dies non (as the learned say). Boxing
Day is another of the same Latin bunch,
and the days that immediately follow
are not adapted for correspondence, even
if one's friends were disposed so soon
to go shopping once more, an ordeal
from which they naturally shrink after
their recent terrible experiences.
Thus, as a corrective to the mala-
droitness of Christmas benefactions,
New Year's Day is of little use. But
Aftermas should fulfil every condition,
since it has been decided to put the
date well forward, even as far as the
end of January, to give everyone time
really to examine the presents of their
friends and make up their minds abso-
lutely. Lists will then be sent in and
—well, they will see what they will see.
Arising out of this Aftermas move-
ment is a scheme, much favoured in
Bond Street, to set apart the second
Monday in every month throughout the
year as a day on which friends should
exchange valuable gifts. A plan to bring
back the glories of February 14 with
really expensive valentines is also afoot,
and there are supporters also of the
birthdays of Messrs. Asquith, BonAR
LAw, REDMoND and MACDoNALD as
occasions to be ear-marked for genial
contests in generosity among friends.
But at present the weight of the attack
is being directed to the solid establish-
ment of Aftermas.

It started when, some month or more ago
(I will say this, that Mary did not err long),
She haled me to that house of fear and woe,
The restaurant of Mr. Ambrose Furlong:
And all about us sat (ye saints, deliver us!)
The glum-faced armies of the graminivorous.
There was a deathly silence o'er the place,
Save only when, amid the murk and stillness,
A nut went off; the food I could not face,

The turkey queened it, and the beef was lord,
But Mary, by the doctrines of her school tied,
Though wistful glances stole across her features,
Disdained to batten on her fellow-creatures.
Till, ringed with dancing flame, divinely brown,
With white hair glistening and with scarlet berry,
The Bacchant pudding in the cloth came down,
Hailed by a revel cheer; and, now grown merry,
Ev’n she, the death's head, scouting melancholy,
Was fain to eat, and cut into the folly.
When “No,” I said, and stayed her with the thought,
“This is your kinsman. No, you must not do it.
The fare you ask for, by some god distraught,
Is principally made of best beef suet.
In pomp of old he ranged betwixt the hedges
(All but the plums). Where, traitress, are your pledges?"
And Mary heard, and Mary's cheek grew pale;
Her spirit strove and underwent contortion,
Then yielded suddenly, and chanced the bale.
“Hang it,” she cried, and took a hefty portion.
Since when, apostate proved, she daily smothers
Her natural feelings and devours her brothers.

about preaching rebellion, there must
be disloyalty in Ireland.” -
Not to be supposed that utterance
of these soothing remarks ran as
smoothly as they are here printed.
They were punctuated by interruptions
from Irish camp. DEVI.IN's scornful
“Oh! oh!” rising above the din, Pole
turned upon him with withering glance
and remarked, “The honourable Mem-
ber for Belfast is the worst of the lot.”
Reference to boycotting bringing from
same quarter enquiry, “What about
the doctors?” Pole, drawing himself up
with mingled air of sorrow and dignity,
observed, “A very irrelevant observa-

Irrelevancy was the one thing he
couldn't a-bear. Catching sight of
SEELY laughing on Treasury Bench he
turned aside to inquire whether SECRE-
TARY FoR WAR had taken into his con-
fidence his military advisers on the
Committee of Imperial Defence on
subject of military position of this
country in event of establishment of
Home Rule Parliament in Dublin 2
An interpolated remark from SEELY
found Pole quite prepared to discuss in
detail circumstances attendant upon
Union of Great Britain and Ireland.
The GENERAL not only delightfully
irrelevant himself but cause of bewild-
ering irrelevancy in others. He brought
to his feet that kindred spirit, WILLIE
REDMOND, who stirred the SPEAKER to
anguished protest.
“I have,” the right hon. gentleman
said, “not the faintest idea of what
the honourable gentleman is alluding
to, or what the resolution is, or what
was the body that passed it.”
This brought up GILBERT PARKER,
bent on making an awful example of
himself as a warning to others. WILLIE
REDMond had accused Polk, CAREw of
having used “disgracful and defamatory
language.” GILBERT PARKER wanted
to know whether such remark was in
order.
. “I myself,” he humbly added, “was
reproved by a former SPEAKER for using
the word “disgraceful.’”
SPEAKER again interposed in sterner
mood. “The House,” he said, “has
very little time. It is called upon
to discuss an important clause, and the
whole of the time is being wasted in
ridiculous talk.”
Ridiculous talk, forsooth ! WILLIE
REDMOND swelled visibly like an of-
fended turkey-cock, though he had not
been mentioned. The SPEAKER's ac-
cusatory remark had been couched in
general terms. But WILLIE not to be
comforted.
“Sir,” he said, amid cheers from Mr.
FLAvis, “I have the very greatest re-
spect for you, but as to the character
of the remarks I feel called upon to
deliver I will take leave to be the judge
myself.” . - ... -- *
“Very well,” said the SPEAKER, “let
us assume that you have disposed of
the honourable and gallant gentleman
(Pole CAREw) and come to the clause
under discussion.”
Thus gently but firmly led back, atten-
tion was again turned upon the impor-
tant measure with respect to which
well-grounded complaint is made in
some quarters that sufficient time is not
supplied for discussion of its clauses.

AT THE PLAY.
“HULLO, RAG-TIME '''
I suppose that if you call a thing a
“Revue,” it is meant to be a satire on
persons in the public eye and on current
vogues and events, and I therefore
assume that all the chorus-part of
Messrs. PEMBERTON and DE CourviLLE's
production at the Hippodrome was
designed to satirise the choruses of
Musical Comedy. If, as I hope, I am
right, the imitation here given of the old
meaningless banalities was almost too
perfect, for its intention clearly escaped
the intelligence of the audience, who
received it with loud and unsuspicious
approval, as if it were the real thing.
I am not sure that even the chorus
itself recognised what it was there for.
But Miss ETHEL LEVEY knew all about
it, and her Musical Comedy methods in
the duet with the foreign huzzar were
very delightful for those who appre-
ciated her humour. On the other
hand, Mr. JAMIEsoN DoDDs, who played
the part of the gallant officer, seemed
to take it quite seriously.
But for the interludes between the
choruses, the “Revue” would have been
a tedious business, for the ugliness
of rag-time dances soon gets on the
nerves. The clow of the evening was an
“Extra Turn,” entitled “The Dramatists
get what they want.” It was almost
THE SPIRIT OF RAG-TIME.
Miss ETHEL LEVEY.
unbelievable that this was from the
same pens that wrote the rag-time
part, yet the programme mentioned no
other authorship. The protestations
of the artistes from the Music-halls—
a decent dog-trainer and his wife, a
perfectly respectable acrobat, with six
children in common—against the ques-
tionable character of the words they
were given to say in a sort of Stage
Society drama, were exquisite fooling;
and here again Miss ETHEL LEVEY was
the soul of the fun, though Mr. HEGGIE,
in a smaller and less exacting part, was
just as good. It was a delightful little
burlesque, and deserved a much more
responsive audience.
Another excellent interlude was the
Sentimental Drama of the mother and
her lost child (allusive to The Tide 2),
with interpolations from the body of
the house. Here Miss DoRoTHY MINTo
was in happy vein, and the attempts
made by the child (first a real child,
and then, after objection raised by the
L.C.C. because of the lateness of the
hour, a grown-up member of the staff,
quite as old as the mother) to secure
paternal recognition from just anybody
that came along were most acceptable.
There was nothing topical in the
American dialogue between those ad-
mirable artistes, Mr. LEw HEARN and
the lady who calls herself “BonitA,”
but it was extremely amusing. Indeed
the large American element did most
of the funny work of the evening, and
even the actress who played Britannia
in a Union Jack had apparently been
imported from over the Atlantic, to
sing the merits of the “red, white and
blyew.” I don't know where the chorus
came from, but they were well above
the average in good looks.
A few public characters were intro-
duced, but in many cases we were left
to gather their identity from the pro-
gramme or the dialogue. Worse like-
nesses than those of Messrs. CHURCHILL,
F. E. SMITH, GRANVILLE BARKER and
the PRESIDENT of the Divorce Court it
would be very difficult to produce. The
representative of Mr. MARTIN HARVEY
was more like the original, but The Only
Way is too established an institution
to ridicule at this time of day even if
the impersonator had got Mr. HARVEY's
voice right. But a really excellent
imitation of Mr. GEORGE GRAVEs was
given by Mr. CYRIL CLENsy in the
midst of playing the character of Sir
|Wilkie Bard; and Mr. GERALD KIRBY
successfully assumed the manner of Mr.
GEORGE GRossMITH, though he could
hardly hope to reproduce his legs.
For a satire on the passing hour this
“Revue” was not quite catholic enough
in its allusions. Its authors over-esti-
mated the part played in our lives by the
stage. There really are other things.
Still, after all, there are few interests
that more closely touch so many types.
For the camps of the Higher Drama, the
Legitimate, and Musical Comedy have
little traffic with one another, and the
way of the true devotee of the Halls
lies apart from them all.
The audience at the Hippodrome was
made of all these types—a sprinkling
of the first two and strong contingents
of the others; and it is matter for

IN John of Jingalo (CHAPMAN AND HALL) Mr. LAURENCE
Hous MAN lets out a number of bees that have been swarm-
ing in his bonnet (or ought I rather to say his toque 2),
some of which have very acute little darts concealed about
them ; others, I think, are content, like the telephone,
with a mere intermittent buzzing. Jingalo is a country
whose capital may be described in the good old phrase as
situated not a hundred miles from Whitehall, and it is only
by an ingenious system of transpositions, and by the
device of alluding quite frequently to England as a co-
existent European state, that the author prevents us from
saying at every turn, “How on earth could anyone dare to
publish a book like this 2 ” Mr. HousMAN's main thesis
is that Jingalo is governed by a class of office-seekers
(represented at any given moment by the Cabinet), who are
wholly unsupported by the voice of the people, and use
alike the democratic will and the institution of monarchy
to serve their bureaucratic ends. Having tumbled down the
palace staircase upon his head, King John begins to “see
things,” and the scope of his vision is further enlarged by
conversations with his son Maw, a Max with whose cynical
detachment we somehow seem familiar. It will not come
as a shock to anyone to learn that the Dramatic Censorship
and Women's Suffrage are cases in which King John sees
fit to set his counsellors at defiance; but these are only two
and not, I think, the sharpest of the points which Mr.
HousMAN has made. I admire most the monarch's decision
! to revive the ceremony of washing beggars' feet on Maun-
day Thursday, attended by the whole Order of Knights of
the Thorn in full robes; and the epilogue: “And when
their ordeal by water was over then the twelve beggars—all
of guaranteed good character though not actual communi-
cants—received with delight each a new pair of shoes and
stockings, which they were able to sell immediately
at fabulous prices to collectors of curiosities, chiefly
Americans. And that same night twelve very happy
beggars, all more or less drunk, made their appearance on
the largest music-hall stage in the metropolis, where the
whole scene was elaborately re-enacted in fac-simile,
followed by a cinematograph record of the actual event.”
That bee stings.
1 have been reading an extraordinary, not to say night-
marish, book about the Mysterious East. It is called The
White Knight (MURRAY) and begins on board a P. & O.
liner, passengers on which were Denis Grey and Howell.
The former, I gathered, had come out to Egypt as the guest
of his Oxford friend, Howell, who was not only “one of the
quietest men in Balliol,” but on his mother's side a Bedouin
Arab. Naturally this unusual combination was not without
startling results, because, as it happened, there was a high-
pressure blood feud going on at the time between Howell's
tribe and another; and hardly had the two travellers dis-
embarked at Port Said when events began simply to hum.
I have a fixed idea that had I been Grey I should have
called the visit a failure. To begin with, having expressed
a wish (the least he could do) to join his host's brotherhood,
he found himself bound hand and foot and involved in the
most terrifying entertainment of gong; and green lights

Amongst other questions that occur to the sceptical reader
is, “Where was Lord KITCHENER2" Briefly, Mr. T. G.
WAKELING has written a sometimes exciting, but more often
rather nonsensical, story about a country that he evidently
knows and loves. The interest would have been stronger
if the author had been less eager to combine it with in-
struction. The characters have a disconcerting habit of
holding long natural-history dialogues in question and
answer, such as I take to be unusual for men in moments
of emotional stress. But the big fight in the last chapters
is tremendous fun, and justifies the making of the book—
for those who like that sort of thing.

method of telling half a tale, and suggesting the rest, which
you may then find out for yourself if you have interest and
imagination enough. Only the other day I saw that
Mr. REID was writing on “The Boy in Fiction,” and
certainly the list of his own books would seem to give him
some claim to speak with authority. All his stories are
in fact studies, extraordinarily clever and detailed and
painstaking, of certain types of adolescence. In Following
Darkness, the boy, Peter Waring, who is its central
character and tells his own tale in the first person, is
drawn with an ingenuity that is quite merciless. The
result is a picture attractive, almost in spite of itself, from
this quality of sincerity. For it must be confessed that on
no other ground could Peter's be called an engaging
personality. Moreover, let those who demand from a novel
that it shall have a symmetrically rounded plot, or for

LEIGH HUGHES, but
of Lord Collingwood from undeserved oblivion its publica-
tion would be welcome. His share in the great victory
of Trafalgar was outshone by the dazzling glory of his
commander and friend, NELsoN. Full justice is at length
| done him, partly by publication of his own modest account
of the great fight, though the part he played in it is only
incidentally referred to. His description of the battle is
a masterpiece. A passage in one of his letters of later
date, protesting against a tendency on the part of the
Admiralty to neglect the duty of maintaining the efficiency
of the Navy, will by its exact terminology commend
itself to the present FIRST Lord. “I have always found,”
CoLLINGwood wrote, “that kind language and strong ships
have a very powerful effect in conciliating the people.”
Another apophthegm, a favourite remark with John STAN-
HoPE, may recommend itself to one of Mr. CHURCHILL's
Cabinet colleagues: “The great advantage of being of old
family is that you are further removed from the rascal who
founded it.” Both NAPoleoN and WELLINGTON figure in
the correspondence, in which appear vivid glimpses of Paris
after Waterloo. -
Casting about me for an epithet by which I may most
suitably describe Following Darkness (ARNoLD), I think
has somehow or other got left out—an article on the
varying value of externals. Any unprejudiced reader who
took up this book and considered the very tasteful crimson-
linen binding, the hand-made paper, the coloured illustra-
tions, the wide margins, the clear lettering and the style
of the printing—every chapter begins with a whole line
in capitals and ends with two shortening lines like the tale
of Fury and the Mouse in Alice in Wonderland—might be
pardoned for saying eagerly, “Here is CHARLEs LAMB at
least.” But with all due respect to Mr. HUGHEs (who was
so well-known as the Sub Rosá of The Morning Leader and
has now transferred his bower to The Daily News) I think
he would be a little disappointed. Mr. HUGHES has one or
two good stories to tell, and his observation is sometimes
shrewd enough. But, oh dear! there are some sad
platitudes in these pages and (can it possibly be because
they first appeared in the form of diurnal columns?) they
are woefully periphrastic at times. But never mind. Mr.
HUGHEs has doubtless plenty of admirers, and he will
not be annoyed if I reserve the larger share of my gratitude
for Mr. Foulis.

THE GREAT TWIN TERRORS.
“Tory Members are trembling before the remorseless propaganda,
the unerring arithmetic, of Mr. Chiozza Money and Sir Alfred
Mond.”—P. W. W. in “The Daily News and Leader.”
WHENCE comes this pallor which bedims
The Tory Party's sanguine faces?
Who puts the palsy in our limbs,
As when a cobra's fierce grimaces
Reduce to pulp the paralytic bunny?
It is the leonine CHIozzA MonEY.
Who is the other terror ? Who
The basilisk that makes us shiver
Turning our red corpuscles blue,
Setting our marrow-bones a-quiver,
Causing a kind of hiccup in the heart?
It is Sir ALFRED MonD, the gifted Bart.
And if you care to call in doubt
The wiles of these astounding wizards;
If you would know some more about
Their power to petrify our gizzards;
With my inspired authority I'll trouble you—
It is the trusty scribe, P. double W.
'Twas he from whom I heard the trick
That makes them such a pair of wonders:
He says it's their arithmetic - -
Which absolutely never blunders;
Ask them, if proof you want, to say at sight
How many beans make five—they're always right.
'Tis this that puts us in the soup,
A wriggling mass of vermicelli;
By this they catch us when we stoop
So that we tremble like a jelly,
Because we cannot cope with men of lore
Who see at once that two and two are four.
They know addition, oh, and lots
Of darker matters; they define us
The meaning of those “little dots,”
And cryptic things like + and – ;
They even do their sums (or so 'tis said)
Not on the fingers, but inside the head!
Deadly at economics, they -
Can tell by lightning calculations
The blow that threatens, some fine day,
To knock the Tariff-ridden nations;
Nor, on the Free Food stump, can hecklers stand a
Moment against their ruthless propaganda.
In hurid lights, that leave us dumb,
• They paint the ruin, swift and heavy,
Of those who tax the People's tum,
Barring, of course, the Liberal levy
(A little thing, a mere ten million touch)
On currants, coffee, cocoa, tea and such.
But we, a trembling chicken-brood,
We dare not say we find it funny
That Liberal taxes laid on food
Are naught to MoND and nil to MoNEY:
And, after all, a mere ten million—what 's a
Trifle like that to ALFRED or CHIozzA 2

By all means, Jemima, make it up with your William.
No one is perfect, and we all lose our tempers at times.
Besides, you say the boot did not actually hit you, and you
can easily get a new chandelier. Do you think he can
have been anticipating in a clumsy and indirect fashion the
custom of throwing a shoe after the wedding carriage? In
any case make him a present, as you suggest, as a sign of
forgiveness; a pair of very soft bedroom slippers would be
a thoughtful gift.
Lucy is engaged to a man who is most high-minded and
honourable, but unfortunately he is not clever and he has very
little hair on his head. Still, I think she had better stick to
him. There are many preparations for the hair (see our
advertisement columns), and many great men have been
bald, e.g., CAESAR and Fra LIPPo LIPPI. As to cleverness,
that is not everything. The poet says, “Be good, sweet
maid,” and it is better to meet nice people, even if they are
rather bores, than to be robbed by a witty dramatist or
bludgeoned by a thoughtful poet.
I am at a loss, my dear Mary, to know what to say to
you. Yours is a most distressing case. Use all your womanly
tact and perhaps you will reclaim him. Next time he
wants to enter a picture palace draw him aside, saying,
“Come, Walter, I see a dog-fight at the other end of the
street.”
Philip thinks he has been very clever, but he has not; he
has done a cruel unkind thing. It is not merely the
crockery; hearts are broken by acting in that way.
You were quite right, Lily. A man who could behave
like that is unworthy of any affection, let alone a con-
suming passion such as you describe yours to be. When
next he calls, summon him to that latticed window of
which you speak so feelingly, and empty a jug of cold water
over him. If he remonstrates you might reply with some
little badinage, as for example, “Water, water everywhere
and not a drop to drink.” Then close the window and
retire to rest. - -
Your heart is not touched, Amelia, but I think you are
a little bit wrong in the head.
I can quite understand, Constantia, that you miss the
visits of your Henry. His eyes must have been excessively
blue. But his habit of imitating a green parrot no doubt
grew tiring and, as you say his income is so small, I feel
certain that your heart cannot really have been touched.
If Percy's diamonds are genuine (and a visit to the nearest
jeweller will settle this point) I think I would forget Henry.
But you must be very careful not to display anything
like a mercenary spirit, for there is nothing that the rich
dislike so much.
I should advise Clara to see a beauty specialist.

passions. If the eyes were her great feature, the mouth gave more
key to her true self. The short upper lip curled outward enough to
make visible a shadowy line above itself, when the light came upwards
to her face. The skin over the eyeteeth showed that slight fulness
indicative of animalism.”—“Bystander” Short Story.

MILLENNIAL MEETINGS.
STIMULATED by the example of Mr.
FREDERIC HARRIsoN in his pronuncia-
miento, “1913,” in The English Review,
several of our leading publicists have
delivered themselves on the subject of
Anglo-German relations, and the best
way of promoting the peace of Europe.
Sir Edwin DURNING - LAwrence,
speaking at the annual meeting of the
Bacup Baconian Society last Friday,
observed that they lived in stirring
times. He was, however, hopeful, nay
sanguine, that peace would be preserved
if the legitimate aspirations of Ger-
many could be reconciled with a due re-
gard for our own Imperial obligations.
Personally he had no doubt whatever
that this could be done easily on the
basis of a simple deal. Let Germany
take SHAkspeaRE (giving us LUTHER in
exchange) while we kept BAcox. He
felt convinced that she would acquiesce
in an arrangement so fraught with
pacific possibilities. Germany would
save her face, and we would save our
BACON. (Great applause.)
The Chevalier WILLIAM LE QUEUx,
who was the principal guest at the
quinquennial banquet of the Rochester
Revolver Club, adumbrated a remark-
able scheme for maintaining the inter-
dynastic relations of Europe on a
harmonious basis. . He proposed a
Conference of Crowned Heads to be
held in the Republic of San Marino,
before which he was prepared to submit
his plan of settling all international
disputes by reference to an official, to
be called the Cosmic Conciliator, who
should be elected by the assembled
Sovereigns and hold office for life. If the
choice fell upon himself, as he had good
ground for believing it might, he would
not shirk the responsibilities of the
post or ſail to deal faithfully with
recalcitrant potentates.
Mr. Thomas BEECHAM, the famous
conductor, fresh from his triumphs
in Germany, addressed a meeting of
musicians at Finsbury Park last Satur-
day evening. He said that the treat-
ment of German bands was the only
outstanding question between the two
countries. He had begun to conduct
overtures with Sir Edward CARSoN with
a view to their establishment in Ulster
under Home Rule in case his efforts to
secure their repatriation failed.
Sir WILLIAM BYLEs, M.P., who pre-
sided at an extraordinary meeting of
the Bradford Branch of the Mad
Mullah Protection League, criticised
Mr. FREDERIC HARRISON's proposal to
surrender various portions of the
Empire as timid and half-hearted. It
was no good giving up Egypt, Malta
and Gibraltar unless we also decided
to give back India to the Indians and
Australia to the aborigines. In view
of the GERMAN EMPERoR's fondness for
yachting, Sir WILLIAM added that it
would be a gracious as well as politic
act to present him with the Isle of
Wight as a summer residence.

MORE SUCCESSFUL LIVES.
VIII. (and Last). —THE EXPLORER.
As the evening wore on —and one
young man after another asked Jocelyn
Montrevor if she were going to Ascot,
what? or to Henley, what? or what 2–
she wondered more and more if this
were all that life would ever hold for
her. Would she never meet a man, a
real man who had done something 2
These boys around her were very
pleasant, she admitted to herself; very
useful, indeed, she added, as one ap-
proached her with some refreshment;
but they were only boys.
“Here you are,” said Freddy, handing
her an ice in three colours. “I’ve had
it made specially cold for you. They
only had the green, pink and yellow
jersey's left; I hope you don't mind.
The green part is arsenic, I believe.
If you don't want the wafer I'll take
it home and put it between the sashes
of my bedroom window. The rattling
kept me awake all last night. That's
why I'm looking so ill, by-the-way.”
Jocelyn smiled kindly and went on
with her ice.
“That reminds me,” Freddy went on,
“we 've got a nut here to-night. The
genuine thing. None of your society
Barcelonas or suburban Filberts. One
of the real Cob family; the driving-from-
the-sixth-tee, inset-on-the-right and
New-Year's - message-to-the-country
touch. In short, a celebrity.”
“Who 2 " asked Jocelyn eagerly.
Perhaps here was a man.
“Worrall Brice, the explorer. Don't
say you haven't heard of him or Aunt
Alice will cry.”
Heard of him 2 Of course she had
heard of him. Who hadn't 2
Worrall Brice's adventures in distant
parts of the empire would have filled a
book—had, in fact, already filled three.
A glance at his flat in St. James's Street
gave you some idea of the adventures
he had been through. Here were the
polished spurs of his companion in the
famous ride through Australia from
south to north—all that had been left
by the cannibals of the Wogga-Wogga
River after their banquet. Here was
the poisoned arrow which, by the mer-
ciful intervention of Providence, just
missed Worrall and pierced the heart
of one of his black attendants, the
post-mortem happily revealing the pre-
sence of a new and interesting poison.
Here, again, was the rope with which
he was hanged by mistake as a spy in
South America—a mistake which would
certainly have had fatal results if he
had not had the presence of mind to
hold his breath during the performance.
In yet another corner you might see his
favourite mascot—a tooth of the shark
which bit him off the coast of China.
Spears, knives and guns lined the walls;
every inch of the floor was covered by
skins. His flat was typical of the man
—a man who had done things.
“Introduce him to me,” commanded
Jocelyn. “Where is he?”
She looked up suddenly and saw him
entering the ball-room. He was of
commanding height and his face was
the face of the man who has been
exposed to the forces of Nature.
wind, ti,e waves, the sun, the mosquito
had set their mark upon him. Down
one side of his cheek was a newly-
healed scar, a scratch from a hippo-
potamus in its last death-struggle. A
legacy from a bison seared his brow.
He walked with the soft easy tread
of the python, or the Pathan, or some
animal with a “pth " in it. Probably
I mean the panther. He bore himself
confidently, and his mouth was a trap
from which no superfluous word es-
caped. He was the strong silent man
of Jocelyn's dreams.
“Mr. Worrall Brice, Miss Montrevor,”
said Freddy, and left them.
Worrall Brice bowed and stood
beside her with folded arms, his gaze
fixed above her head.
“I shall not expect you to dance,”
said Jocelyn, with a confidential smile
which implied that he and she were
above such frivolities. As a matter of
fact, he could have taught her the
Wogga-Wogga one-step, the Bimbo,
the Kiyi, the Ju-bu, the Head-hunter's
Hug and many other cannibalistic steps
which, later on, were to become the rage
of London and the basis of a revue.
“I have often imagined you, as you
kept watch over your camp,” she went
on, “and I have seemed myself to hear
the savages and lions roaring outside
the circle of fire, what time in the
swamps the crocodiles were barking.”
“Yes,” he said.
“It must be a wonderful life.”
“Yes.”
“If I were a man I should want to
lead such a life; to get away from all
this,” and she waved her hand round
the room, “back to Nature. To know
that I could not eat until I had first
killed my dinner; that I could not live
unless I slew the enemy! That must
be fine !”
“Yes," said Worrall.
“I cannot get Freddy to see it. He
is quite content to have shot a few
grouse . . . and once to have wounded
a beater. There must be more in life
than that.”
“Yes.”
“I suppose I am elemental. Beneath
the veneer of civilisation I am a savage.
To wake up with the war-cry of the
enemy in my ears, to sleep with the
The
er—barking of the crocodile in my
dreams, that is life " ''
Worrall Brice tugged at his moustache
and gazed into space over her head.
Then he spoke.
“Crocodiles don't bark,” he said.
Jocelyn looked at him in astonishment.
“But in your book, Through Trackless
Paths ' " she cried. “I know it almost
by heart. It was you who taught me.
What are the beautiful words 2 “On
the banks of the sleepy river two great
crocodiles were barking.'”
“Not ‘barking,’” said Worrall.
“‘Basking.' It was a misprint.”
“Oh ' " said Jocelyn. She had a
moment's awful memory of all the
occasions when she had insisted that
crocodiles barked. There had been a
particularly fierce argument with Meta
Richards, who had refused to weigh
even the printed word of Worrall Brice
against the silence of the Reptile House
on her last visit to the Zoo.
“Well,” smiled Jocelyn, “you must
teach me about these things. Will you
come and see me?”
“Yes,” said Worrall. He rather liked
to stand and gaze into the distance
while pretty women talked to him.
And Jocelyn was very pretty.
“We live in South Kensington. Come
on Sunday, won't you? 99, Peele
Crescent.”
“Yes,” said Worrall.
On Sunday Jocelyn waited eagerly
for him in the drawing-room of Peele
Crescent. Her father was asleep in the
library, her mother was dead; so she
would have the great man to herself
for an afternoon. Later she would
have him for always, for she meant to
marry him. And when they were
married she was not so sure that they
would live with the noise of the crocodile
barking or coughing, or whatever it
did, in their ears. She saw herself in
that little house in Green Street with
the noise of motor-horns and taxi-
whistles to soothe her to sleep.
Yet what a man he was ' What had
he said to her 2 She went over all his
words. . . . They were not many.
At six o'clock she was still waiting in
the drawing-room at Peele Crescent . . .
At six-thirty Worrall Brice had got
as far as Peele Place . . .
At six-forty-five he was back in
Radcliffe Square again . . .
At seven o'clock, just as he was
giving himself up for lost, he met a taxi
and returned to St. James's Street. He
was a great traveller, but South Ken-
sington had been too much for him.
Next week he went back unmarried
to the jungle. It was the narrowest
escape he had had. And he would have
hated Green Street. A. A. M.

THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH, OR
HULLO, WALTZ-TIME!
THE Great Central Hall of the Hop
Market was the scene, on Monday last,
of a remarkable meeting, convened by
the Society for Promoting Graceful
J)eportment, and presided over by Mr.
Cecil I'foulke-Loring, the famous
terpsichorean professor, with a view to
reviving the famous Old English dances
associated with the Merrie England of
the past.
Before addressing the meeting, Pro-
fessor Ffoulke-Loring read letters and
telegrams from several distinguished
sympathisers with the movement.
Lord CURzoN wrote: “I cordially
approve of the aim of the meeting.
Decorum is the inalienable heritage of
the British race, though the exhibitions
witnessed in modern ball-rooms suggest
that we have exchanged the cult of
Terpsichore for that of St. Vitus. It
should be our duty to call in the Old
World to redress the outrages of the
New.”
Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE tele-
graphed: “Am with you heart and sole.”
Mr. FILSON. YoUNG wrote: “Modern
life is sadly lacking in dignity and dis-
tinction, and it is strange to note in
persons of birth and breeding a ten-
dency to relapse, in moments of ex-
hilaration, to the simian contortions of
the primitive savage. Any effort to
combat this retrograde tendency will
receive my most cordial and italic
support.”
Professor Ffoulke-Loring, who was
very heartily received, drew the atten-
tion of his audience to the circumstance
that unless steps were at once taken
there was every danger of certain of the
dances to which the feet of our ancestors
and ancestresses kept happy time re-
maining for ever in the oblivion in
which they were now buried. This
would be a very regrettable calamity.
Records of the past told him that the
waltz, the polka and the lancers were
once ingredients of the life of Merrie
England, and he had himself conversed
with persons who could recall these
measures and the pleasure they had
taken in footing them. At a house in
Mayfair he had found a comely lady of
forty who distinctly recollected waltz-
ing (as it was called) at a ball in London.
There was nothing, she was convinced,
in the rag-time dances of the present
—the Hugs and Trots and Cuddles and
Strangles and Tangos—which could
compare with the waltz for enjoyment.
He had discovered, the Professor con-
tinued, that musicians had existed who
wrote nothing but music for this par-
ticular dance, and in Vienna, which he
had recently visited, there were persons
still true to it. It was indeed from the
Maid. “YEs, MUM ; AND SIIE walrs out REGULAR AT NIGHTS WITH MR. Bhows, THE
BUTCHER, AND EVEN TAKEs 'Is ARM; AN' MR. BROWN's A MARRIED MAN, AN' SHE ENOWs
IT AND "E KNOWS IT, Too.''
notes which he had taken in Vienna
that he hoped to reconstruct the waltz
for the purposes of their Society.
As to his adventures in search of the
correct steps of the other obsolete dances
which he had mentioned—the polka
and the lancers—he would at the present
moment say nothing.
What was very strongly felt, both by
himself and his committee, was that, if
only a few negroes could be induced to
take them up, all these dances would
instantly be received into favour by
the Smart Set of England and their
prosperity be assured.
Mr. Ffoulke-Loring then read the
list of subscriptions towards the great
work to which he had set his hand,
including £50, ear-marked for waltzing
reconstruction, from Messrs. Giddy and
Giddy. He had also had a promise of
support from the well-known pugilist
and bridegroom, Mr. JACK JoHNSON.
(Great enthusiasm.)
A resolution in favour of urging the
Government to appoint a Royal Com-
mission to inquire into the Decadence
of Dancing having been unanimously
passed, the meeting broke up to the
strains of the “Mabel" Waltz.

[JANUARY 15, 1913.
A FLUTTER ON THE FLAT.
WHEN we were married, Elmira's
aunt gave us a picture of JonAH and
the Whale, and after considerable dis-
cussion we decided to hang it in the
bathroom. There is nothing indelicate
about the work—if you knew Elmira's
aunt you would be quite certain of that
—and indeed it is difficult to be sure
what precise moment in the Scriptural
drama the artist endeavoured to seize.
The prophet is fully clothed, and there
is a kindly, almost quizzical expression
on the face of the sea-monster. Neither
of us, Elmira nor I, considers the thing
very beautiful, and, except when Miss
Tompkinson seemed likely to call, we
felt that the bathroom was the most
suitable home for it. It hangs just
over the geyser and looks, I think,
rather well.
At four o'clock last Thursday after-
noon the dreaded event happened, and,
in accordance with the pre-arranged
scheme, as soon as I heard the draw-
ing-room door closed on our visitor
I took a chair and a bamboo-stick
and, successfully gaffing the master-
piece, hastened towards my study with
it. Unhappily, before I could get there,
the drawing-room door opened again.
Without a doubt, Elmira's aunt in-
tended to be shown round the flat, and
since my study is opposite the drawing-
room there was nothing to be done but
to take refuge in the kitchen. As Fate
would have it, this was, of course, the
very room which Elmira's aunt im-
mediately wished to inspect. Perhaps
she wanted to look at the colander—
I know there is a colander because I
have paid for it, but I have never yet
been allowed to see it at its work; or
it may have been the nutmeg-grater—
I am told we have a very beautiful nut-
meg-grater. Anyhow, before they came
in I bolted with a cry of alarm into the
larder and slammed the door. Then
I realised that I was trapped again, for
there is no bolt on the inside of the
larder door. It would have been absurd
for the master of the house to be dis-
covered weltering amongst the remains
of the cold mutton, clasping the repre-
sentation of a Biblical crisis under one
arm. So I crawled with some difficulty
through the larder window on to the
roof–ours is the highest flat in the
buildings—and dragged the seascape
after me.
It is a great pity that people should
go and leave unnecessary nails sticking
out of window-casements and that it
is not someone's business to keep the
slates of London roofs clean. I made
my way, however, with a little trouble,
to the sky-light over the landing and
dropped down opposite our front door.
I was just going to let myself in when
I heard voices on the other side.
Apparently Elmira's aunt was just
going to leave. I felt that she must
have been disappointed at not seeing
her picture, but it was too late to bother
about that now—at any rate, she had
not seen it over the geyser. The one
thing to do was to escape, and, since ||
our lift is temporarily disabled, I ran
downstairs into the street—it was the
only way. Several people looked at
me rather curiously when I got on to
the pavement, and I suppose it is a
little unusual for an English gentleman
to take the air in a rather grimy con-
dition with no hat on and a large rent
in his trousers, and carrying a bamboo
stick in one hand and a large picture of
a devotional nature in the other. I did
not see the joke myself. To avoid
ostentation I summoned a taxi-cab.
“Where to ?” shouted the man at the
wheel, and I said, rather recklessly
perhaps, “The Royal Academy.” When
we were about half-way there I decided
that the coast must be clear, and told
the man to turn round and go back.
Still rather unmanned, but feeling con-
siderably relieved, I let myself into the
flat and immediately came face to face
with Elmira and her aunt.
“Oh, you’ve got it!” said Elmira
(I married Elmira partly for her quick
intuitions), clasping her hands and
positively beaming. “I was just telling
Auntie that we broke the glass of her
beautiful picture while we were trying
to hang it in the drawing-room this
morning, and that I had sent you off
to get it mended at once.”
If . stay at our flat you will
probably notice the picture of JoNAH
and the Whale while you take your
morning tub; it imparts an air of salt
water. It is placed just over the
geyser, and on the wall opposite I have
hung a bamboo walking-stick.

That I've heard the little story that
he wants to tell before.
Mere politeness starts the error;
He dislikes to think it stale;
Ah, but the unholy terror

As he turns on me his glances !

As I fail to seize the chances

Told it me when I was young?

While the perspiration oozes and
comes trickling down my cheek.

Cross his mind before the end?
What if by some thought-transmission
He should find me out 2 O friend,
You who read the subtle novels
Of the school of HENRY JAMEs,
You can guess the imp that grovels
Darkly in my cranial hovels
As the jest winds slowly seawards to
the full-mouthed roar it claims.
Ay, and if the end completed
All the anguish, all the pain;
If those moments tense and heated
Passed, and I might breathe again;
No, for sometimes mid the thunder
Of my mirth the man recalls
How he split his sides asunder

THE BILLIARD-ROOM.
THERE was no possible mistake about
it. “Billiard-room”—those were the
words; and as a billiard-room was a
sine qua mon, and the rest of the de-
scription of the house seemed satis-
factory and its situation was agreeable,
I chartered a car at enormous expense
—no one can call tenpence a mile any-
thing but enormous expense—and
hurried away with an “order to view.”
It was not a bad house. The agent's
printed words and the edifice cannot be
said exactly to have run in double
harness; but it was not a bad house.
I don't say I should myself have called
it precisely “old world,” but then I am
rather fastidious about epithets; and it
was obvious that if one of the alleged
seven bedrooms was used as a dressing-
room the number of the bedrooms
would be reduced to six; that is to
say, the house possessed either seven
bed-rooms and no dressing-room, or a
dressing-room and six bedrooms, but
under no conditions seven bedrooms as
well as a dressing-room, as the specifi-
cation would have you think. Still, it
was not a bad house.
Having seen all over it I asked the
“caretaker on premises” if I might
now look at the billiard-room.
“Billiard-room?” she said vaguely.
I showed her the agent's list, with
the smiling announcement in black-
and-white.
She read it, but was still nonplussed.
At last a light broke in. “Oh, yes,”
she said, “I suppose they mean the
attic;" and she again led the way
upstairs to a point on the top landing
beneath a trap-door in the ceiling.
“They mean that,” she said. “Would
you like to go up? There's a ladder
close by.”
I declined. A half-size bagatelle-
board might conceivably be insinuated
through this trap and erected on the
unstable floor; but nothing bigger or
heavier; and as for light . . .
This—and many similar experiences
—make it necessary to address to the
house-agency profession (or is it craft?)
the following epistle:–
DEAR SIRs, May I draw your at-
tention to an old aphorism, “Honest
is the best policy”? Not that I thin
you exactly dishonest—that is perhaps
too strong a term for deviations from
accuracy which are prompted, I am
convinced, by no more culpable motives
than the desire to see properties change
hands, house-hunters satisfied, and
yourselves the recipients of commis-
sion. None the less, there are only
two things: truth and that which is
not truth; and you might just as well
pin your faith to truth as to the other

feel sure I shall be told so. Let that
point then go. But since you cannot
conduct your business thoroughly and
are content to recommend pigs in
pokes, in defiance of sound commercial
principles, may I implore you to take
such a simple precaution as to ask the
owners of the houses on your books for
measurements? That surely would be
easy and save many fruitless journeys
on the part of house-hunters.

w ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF Toby, M.P.)
- TIM HEALY, while HAYES-FISHER was speaking, “took a census.”
House of Commons, Monday, January have 123 supplementing what may be or indeed why it shouldn't. Equal
6.—As the 15th of January approaches,
bringing fulfilment of promise of
9d. for 4d. through operation of In-
surance Act, Questions designed to
hamper accomplishment of the benefi-
cent work fall off in number. To-day
there was, by exception, remarkable
recrudescence. Probably a final foray,
it beat the record. Of eighty-six
Questions on paper the first thirty-one
were addressed to FINANCIAL SEC-
RETARY TO THE TREASURY. Each
presented a more or less cleverly con-
structed conundrum suggesting diffi-
culties in working the Act. The number
was increased by ten, MASTERMAN,
Ready as usual to take on fresh
work, answering for CHANCELLoR of
ExcHEQUER to whom they were ad-
dressed. This made forty-one Questions,
nearly one-half of the whole replied to
by a single Minister.
Statement only partially represents
the case. With few exceptions each
of the Questions was a congeries of
interrogation. Thus whilst they num-
bered up to forty-one they actually
presented ninety separate and distinct
enquiries, each calling for detailed
reply. Nor is this all. Ministerial
answer was invariably followed by
crowd of Supplementary Questions.
The minimum was two; the average
three; sometimes the number ran up to
six. Taking the average as three we
called the mother questions, bringing
up the total to 213.
Purists in Parliamentary procedure
might be disposed to describe this as
disorderly debate, outraging funda-
mental principle upon which the
practice of seeking useful information
from Ministers is based. Not at all.
It is the latest development of the
Question-hour. If some score of Mem-
bers who, in obedience to Standing
Order, have given notice of their Ques-
tions and duly placed them on the Paper,
find the list closed by time limit before
their names are called on, it is their mis-
fortune. They should either ask Sup-
plementary Questions or give private
notice to a Minister of intention to
cross-examine him on a particular
point. By this last device they would
gain the privilege of reading their
Question aloud, a delight denied to the
commonplace Member who subjects
himself to the spirit and the letter of
the Standing Order governing the
Question-hour.
Business dome.—Clause 13 of Welsh
Church Disestablishment Bill added in
Committee. Long debate left undeter-
mined the crucial question, “What is a
layman?”
Tuesday.—Read sometimes in the
papers of the silver market going
“up" or “down” so many points.
Don't know why it should do either,
mystery broods over recently born
absorbing passion of RUPERT Gwyn NE,
known in smoking-room conversation
as “Silver-Market” Gwyn NE. To-day
he rose ten points—I mean ten times
—with searching inquiry about that
purchase of silver (or was it a sale?)
on account of Indian Government.
India Office, in . to questions
with which they have been bombarded
during last couple of months, state
that Éy clever management the City
firm entrusted with the business out-
witted group of market operators and
saved the Treasury £100,000. “Silver-
Market” Gwyn NE, whose intimacy with
intricacies of the trade is extensive and
peculiar, knows better.
Hence severe catechism to which
from time to time he subjects represen-
tative of India Office. Of late has eased
off a little. Sometimes whole week
passes without our hearing from him.
Then, as to-day, he starts afresh. Ever
in the same unimpassioned manner, the
same monotonous tone, and withal the
same unmistakable air of conveying to
House impression that if he were to tell
all he knew he would make its flesh
creep and its hair uprise in affright.
By accident there are two Members
seated in close proximity below Gang-
way, each bubbling with possession of
secret information, both restrained by
fetters of Parliamentary procedure tom

maintaining high level of courtesy in
Parliamentary debate. But it leaves
undetermined the problem whether a
red herring, good, bad or indifferent,
may reasonably be expected to “touch

FIDO.
IAST week the idea came to me in a
bright moment to call upon Suzanne
and make her an offer of marriage, and
as it was four in the afternoon I decided
to put on my best suit and commence
immediately. Ushered into her mother's
drawing-room, I found her alone on the
sofa holding in her lap what appeared
at first sight to be a piece of disused
hearthrug.
“Hullo, James, dear old thing,” she
said, “come and be introduced to
Marmaduke.”
I advanced and poked the object with
some idea of discovering its nature.
It gave vent to a horrible squeal, and
I sprang back in alarm.
“My goodness,” I said, “the thing's
alive.”
“Of course it is.
expect?”
I approached again and looked at it
closely.
“But what is it 2 " I asked.
“Why, it's a dog, of course.”
“A dog!”
“Yes, a dog.
Was 2 ''
“I thought it was a pen-wiper."
Suzanne pouted.
“You’re a very fine dog, aren't
you?” she said, addressing the insect.
“Good old Fido,” I said.
“His name isn't Fido,” said Suzanne.
“It's Marmaduke.”
“Oh! What makes you think that 2"
“Why, bless the man,” she exclaimed,
“I call him Marmaduke, so he is
Marmaduke, isn't he 2''
“No,” I said, “he isn't. I always
call dogs Fido ; and I see no reason
now to abandon the custom, so I shall
continue to speak of him as Fido.”
Suzanne made agesture of impatience.
“Oh, well, ring for tea anyway,” she
said.
I had got the best of the argument,
and I rejoiced about it at the time, but
I am inclined to think that a little
diplomacy would perhaps have been
wiser.
I had not however called upon Suzanne
that afternoon for the sole purpose of
putting her right in the matter of her
dog's name. I had a more delicate feat
to perform, and, while wearing an air
of easy nonchalance and touching lightly
on the topics of the day, I deftly ap-
proached the question which lay so near
my heart.
With the advent of tea I began to
skirmish about the bush.
I helped myself to a fair-sized muffin.
It is a good thing to have something
substantial to hold on to in a crisis.
“You may have noticed, my dear
Suzanne,” I began, “that I have been

paying you what I may describe as
marked attentions for no little time.”
I took a bite of muffin and gazed at
her over the top of it to observe the
effect of my words. -
“I come round here on fine after-
noons,” I pursued, “when I might be-
working. I take you to dances and for
your sake endure sleepless nights—
and-sleepy days. I give you boxes of
chocolates in season and out of season.
In short, I would appear to be de-
cidedly . . . pris . . . if you know the
word . . . "
“Of course I know the word,” she
interrupted. “Why, I believe you
learnt it from me.”
“Possibly,” I said. “But that is beside
the point. The point is why—why do
I do all this 2"
“Goodness knows.”
“I will tell you. It is because I am,
in fact . . . pris.”
Suzanne, overcome with sweet modest
blushes, gazed with downcast eyes at
Fido curled up in her lap, and vouch-
safed no reply.
“And yet,” I continued, “neither
your father nor your mother has made
bold to ask me my intentions. Rather
singular, isn't it?”
I took another bite of muffin.
“I might, without exaggeration, say
very singular.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“In their absence,” said Suzanne,
“I must apologise for them. They are
both a little forgetful.”
“That may be,” I replied with dig-
nity, “but º remains to be said that
most men would have taken advantage
of this and gone off and been lost alto-
gether. However,” I added, “I am
made of different stuff or cast in a
different mould—I forget which—and
I have come here to-day to make a
voluntary declaration.”
“You overwhelm me!” exclaimed
Suzanne.
“I ought perhaps to tell you that
this is not at all the sort of marriage I
expected to contract when I started out
in life. I thought then that I should
probably wed a society beauty and have
my photograph in The Tatler . . . but
somehow you have crept into my heart
—or whatever the technical expression
is—and . . . and, in short, I . . . love
you.”
At this critical point in my declara-
tion Suzanne, shaken no doubt by a
very natural emotion, spilt some hot tea
on to Fido. It was, of course, a pure
accident, but the little beast worked
itself up into a fearful state about it,
squealing in a more horrible manner
than before.
She caught it up in her arms, kissing
it and begging to be forgiven.
“My poor darling ! Was it scalded,
then 2''
It was too much.
“Come, come,” I said, “you really
must leave your toys alone now and
attend to me. Let us put Fido away
in the cupboard.”
Suzanne stood up, panting with in-
dignation. Then she gnashed her little
teeth. I became alarmed. It seemed
as if no language would occur to her
mind sufficiently frightful to meet the
situation.
I felt somehow at the time that it
was not a propitious moment for my
proposal, but I had put my hand to
the plough, and I am of the race that,
having done this, never lets go.
“Joking apart,” I said, “I love you,
and I want you to be my wife.”
There was a long, a very long pause.
You could have heard a pin drop. (But
I have observed that in real life pins
rarely fall at such times.)
“My wife,” I repeated.
that.”
Suzanne gazed at me in solemn
silence. She was, to all appearances,
thinking of it. Then she kissed Fido.
“You may have the refusal of
me for seven days,” I added. “An
| option.”
She re-seated herself, and spoke at
last with great deliberation.
“Marmaduke and I,” she said, “take
“Think of
the very earliest opportunity of declin-
ing your kind offer.”
I could hardly believe my ears. A
lifelong confidence in those features was
rudely shaken.
“But surely,” I cried, “surely you ||
love me 2"
Suzanne looked me straight in the
face, with an expression of perfect
candour in her big blue eyes. -
“Yes, James,” she said, “I do. I
will not conceal the fact. I love you
deeply.”
“Then why,” I exclaimed, “why
this diffidence? It is due to some
girlish whim.”
“No, James,” she replied, “it is the
mature decision of a woman ripe in
years and wisdom.”
I could not understand her attitude.
It is a matter of common knowledge
that Suzanne is only nineteen.
“I need a second muffin,” I said.
“This unlooked-for development finds
me unprepared.”
With tears in her eyes she handed
me the muffin dish.
“Now,” I said, “if you love me what
is the impediment to our marriage? I
know of no family feud. Can it be
Eugenics 2 Is it that I am a confirmed
muffin-eater 2''
She shook her head.
“It is because you do not really love
me,” she said.
I gasped. I could think of no ade-
quate reply. I had so obviously been
in love with her for weeks.
“Will you kindly explain 2" I said at
last with a sort of calm resignation.
“How shall I begin?” she asked.
“Begin with a few introductory
bars,” I said patiently, “and then
announce the principal theme con
amore on the wood-wind.”
“Well,” she said, “you know the old
saw or adage that goes, ‘Love me, love
my dog'?”
I felt misgivings.
“Yes. Well?"
“Do you love Marmaduke 2 Assur-
edly not. Then how can you love me?”
felt competent to deal with the
difficulty. I can depart from the truth
as gracefully as most men when the
occasion demands it.
“Indeed,” I said impressively, “I
have the greatest affection for Fido.”
“How do you show it? You come
in here this afternoon and greet him
with a heartless prod. You wilfully
mistake him for a pen-wiper. Subse-
quently you propose putting him away
in the cupboard, and, worst of all, you
insist on calling him Fido when you
know his name is Marmaduke.”
I saw that the evidence was strongly
against me. I tried another line of
defence.
“After all,” I said, “what are pro-
verbs? Wise men make them and
F-F-Fido repeats them.”
Suzanne raised her eyebrows.
“Marmaduke, I presume you mean?”
At this moment the door opened and
a lady visitor came in.
“Back at last,” she said ; “and thanks
so much, dear, for looking after my
darling pet.”
Suzanne introduced me.
“Is that your dog?” I asked. “Such
a nice affectionate little thing.

“Topsy.”

“YES, FATHER, THE PANTOMIME 's AMUS-
THE SUBsoil, I FIND ING ENOUGH, BUT THIS HEATED ATMOSPHERE
Is No Doubt IMPREGNATED witH BACTERIA.”
THE ROMANCE OF A BILL OF COSTS.
IT has lately been my good fortune to be enabled to ||
study an old bill of costs sent in to their client by Messrs.
Ginnyfee, Ritter and Server, formerly (and still, for aught
I know) a well-known and highly-respected firm of solicitors.
Set out, as it is, in the unadorned but convincing style of
a lawyers' document it has a certain homely eloquence of its
own and reveals qualities which have made some English-
men what they are.
The hero, if I may so term him, of the story appears to
have leased a little house at a rent which he cheerfully
neglected to pay. There are no circumlocutions about the
beginning of the narrative, no investigations into obscure
matters of heredity and early history. It plunges head-first
into the thick of things in the following fashion:-
“18—, July-August. Costs of obtaining judgment
against Mr. T. F. Hartupp for possession of 33, Cul-
verwell Gardens and for £70 5s. 0d. arrears of rent due
8th July, 18–, in the action of yourself v. Hartupp, as
assessed against Mr. Hartupp by Master Wackerley on
21st August, 18–, £810s.”
That sounds conclusive, and “yourself” no doubt thought
that the matter was settled and his cheque in the post.
The resources of civilisation, however, were far from being
exhausted. They had scarcely been tapped, as the following
items show:—
“Upon receipt of your letter, instructing us to receive
possession if no payment made and no reasonable
proposition put forward, writing acknowledging same.”
“Attending Mr. Hartupp's solicitor, when he said he
expected to see his client and would communicate
with us.”
“Attending him later, when he asked us to postpone
appointment to 4 P.M. as he had not yet seen
Mr. Hartupp.”
“Attending Mr. Hartupp's solicitor, when he said no
proposal could be made at present and possession would
be given up.”
This again has all the outward semblance of a triumph—
but where was the money, the much-desired but elusive
cheque for £70 5s. 0d. and costs?
I omit some trifling matters in order that I may carry
the story forward swiftly to its next stage:–
“Attending Mr. Hartupp's solicitor, informing him
that we should proceed to enforce judgment unless
matter dealt with at once.”
“Writing him to same effect and threatening pro-
ceedings in Bankruptcy.”
With the mention of this smashing and portentous word
Mr. Hartupp ought to have been defeated, but he wasn't:-
“Attending by appointment to serve Mr. Hartupp
with Bankruptcy Notice at his solicitor's office, when
he did not attend; but his solicitor stated he would
inform him that unless he called by following day at
12 o'clock noon we should apply for an order for
substituted service.”
“Attending to serve Bankruptcy Notice at Mr.
Hartupp's solicitor's office, when Mr. Hartupp did not
keep appointment.”
The business now lingered about the purlieus of the
Bankruptcy Court for a good many days. Instructions for
the petition were given, it was drawn, it was engrossed, and
there was an item of one shilling “Paid Parchment.”
During all this time Mr. Hartupp was described as “keeping
out of the way.” This, indeed, seems to have been his
favourite fighting method:—
“Upon receipt of letter from Mr. Hartupp's solicitor
that he had asked his client to attend at his offices at
12 o'clock to be served, attending at solicitor's offices
accordingly, when he stated that his client had not
arrived and asked us to call again at 2 o'clock.”
“Attending again at 2 o'clock to serve petition, when
Mr. Hartupp did not come.” -
By this time we had passed from July into December and
the end was not yet in sight. There were again dark rumours
of what is called “substituted service,” on the ground that
Mr. Hartupp was still keeping out of the way and could not
be served personally. A “joint and several affidavit” was
drawn, a Commissioner was paid the paltry sum of 3s.6d.,
and a shilling was charged for “copy order for sealing to
serve folios three.” Finally Mr. Hartupp seems to have ||
relented. Feeling that he had done enough for the time, he
brings his wife into the story:—
“Attending Mr. Hartupp's solicitor, when, on behalf
of Mrs. Hartupp, he paid £50 on the terms of our
agreeing to the dismissal of the petition against
Mr. Hartupp, and allowing two months' further time
for payment of balance of debt and costs.”
I wonder what happened when the two months were up.

“HULLO, THOMPsoN ''
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I own to a most pleasant feeling of friendliness for the
stories of Mr. THoMAs CoBB. In any case, his latest,
A Marriage of Inconvenience (MILLs AND Boon), would
have enlisted my sympathies by its attractive title. Those
familiar with the author's methods will hardly require to
be told what it is all about. Nothing really, or at least
nothing that mightn't happen to any of us. But as usual
we are introduced to a set of quite delightful people, who
sit about in each other's houses (and they all live in the
jolliest parts of London) and discuss their slender intrigues
over lunch or tea in a manner that I have found exceedingly
agreeable. I fancy that Mr. CoBB has (if I may put it so
without offence) a strong feeling for the place that food fills
in social intercourse. I hardly remember a story of his that
has not a meal of some kind in almost every chapter. And
there is no writer who is more generous with eonversation;
so much so that now and again I have not been able to resist
the suspicion that the characters were chattering less to
further their own development than to help Mr. Cobb to fill
out another novel. Anyhow, A Marriage of Inconvenience
is just as pleasant as all its predecessors. You can see from
the name that she marries him in the end; and the incon-
venience of the match (chiefly objected to by his party
because her mother was such an impossible person that for
a long time I thought there was going to turn out to be no
real relationship between them) seems unlikely to be very
overwhelming. Indeed on the last page the happy pair are
left with both a luncheon and a dinner-party in prospect.
So that's all right. -
I am in a position now to understand the feelings of the
Hired Murderer in the fairy stories, who repents at the last
moment and refuses to slay the Child. Ever since I read in
a daily paper one of the silliest column-articles I had ever
encountered, I had been, so to speak, lying in wait for Mr.
DION CLAYTON CALTHROP. I said to myself: “Mark me, a
time will come. Some day I shall have to review a novel by
this fellow. Then I will let myself go.” Sure enough, along
came St. Quin (ALSTON RIVERs). I smiled grimly, reached
down my club, and gave it a twirl. A moment later it had
dropped from my grasp, and I was wondering how I could
have entertained for a moment the idea of maltreating this
fascinating little stranger. From now onward, Mr. CALTHROP
has my permission to write what he pleases in the daily
papers, if only he will keep his novels up to this standard.
In St. Quin he has hit on a fundamental truth, to wit, that
the great majority of human beings are struggling all their
lives to keep from getting fat. To some of us bodily fat is
the bogey. Edmund St. Quin was troubled by a horror of
the fatness of the soul. “We are fat,” he says. “That is
it. We are hideously fat. We are so fat that we cannot
see the stars or the daisies; ” and the story is an epic of his
campaign against the insidious curse. All the conditions
are against him. He is rich; he has centuries of it-isn't-done
traditions to prevent his taking spiritual Swedish exercises:
a thousand forces are at work to urge him to lie back in his
arm-chair and put his feet up. But his love of Romance is
too strong for all of them. He breaks away, and finds his
salvation, at last, in company with the wife whom he has
always considered a very queen and leader of the it-isn't-done
army, but who, unknown to him, has all the time been
taking soul-exercise as thoroughly as he himself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Mrs. ANDREw LANG has an ingratiating habit of assuming
in the reader all manner of knowledge which it is quite
possible (and in one case quite certain) the reader does not
ossess. There is indeed about Men, Women and Minares
LoNGMANs) an awesome air of long familiarity with odd
volumes and MSS. and crumpled faded letters, and the
pleasantly discursive papers range from “Pitfalls for
Collectors,” the most engaging summary of a Frenchman's
history of famous fakes, to “The Fairchild Family,” an
interest in which not even the author's genial desecration
of those sad old bones can create in my bored and stubborn
breast. I liked best to read of an eighteenth-century
Scotchwoman, a MURE of
after burning down the castle, like the ancient Chinese
when they wanted bacon for breakfast, that Miss RAMSAY
is able to bring him up to the scratch by flinging the flapper
into his arms. I need hardly say that in the end she
turned out to be anything but a poor relation, though how
Miss RAMSAY manages to make her a Dollar Princess I will
leave the reader to find out for himself. I could wish that
she had not introduced into her story the decadent American
youth who only escaped the electric chair by being shut up
for a time in an asylum. The type doesn't seem to me to
fit in with the kind of writing in which she excels—pleasant
descriptions of the hunting-field with a seasoning of ordinary
Caldwell, writing of an
earlier generation: “The
booksellers' shopes were not
stuffed as they now are with
novels and magazines.” It
is indeed because of the
inordinate increase of every
sort of such stuffing that a
quiet, pleasantly learned and
leisurely volume like Mrs.
LANG's brings such relief.

in view they let one of the castles—useful pieces sometimes
when you want to mate—to a beautiful young American
heiress. But, though she put hot-waterpipes into the draughty
old rooms and passages, neither they, nor her charms, nor her
dollars were able to raise the temperature of Peter's heart.
He left her at home with the cold comfort of the hot-water
pipes while he hunted and hulloed and had many a rattling
day with a poor relation of hers, a little slip of a girl with
her hair down her back, who knew how to ride. And even
then for Peter was a backward sort of a lover, it is only
the latter is a glorious
creature, an expert hand at the game of life, and worth
a dozen of Alice, it is Alice upon whom the misunderstood
hero dotes and whom the villain gets into his clutches.
At the end, when Alice is freed from her engagement to the
villain, the hero, now thoroughly understood and appreciated
as such, is still doting upon her. Does he then marry the
girl? or, rather, does the girl marry him? No; she pulls
my leg instead, and Lorrie aids and abets. I am taken
entirely by surprise when two human beings emerge from
this atmosphere of unreality and do two very human things.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BLACKLEG'S CONVERSION.
(A few minutes with the Tawi-Drivers.)
THE three peaked-capped, leather-
breeched, black-legginged gentlemen
in the coffee shop, following the usual
custom of improvidence when most
providence is needed, were regaling
themselves with unwonted lavishness.
Two of them, moustached and upright,
bore rather the stamp of the ex-soldier.
The other was of the “droopy” order,
with weak, indifferent features and an
expression of sullen determination upon
them which contrasted strangely with
the care-free, almost debonair attitude
of his two companions.
“Wot's the matter wi' you, 'Arry?
You got a face like a church door.
Don't you like restin’?”
The speaker, who answered to the
name of “Nobby,” was wearing a little
white badge that bore the mystic words
“December Clearance.” He continued
his meal without any apparent anxiety
to have his question answered.
“No, I don't,” replied the droopy
one, “and I ain't doin’ it much longer.”
“What—goin' back to navvyin’?”
asked No. 3. -
“No, goin' back to drivin'. I've 'ad
enough of strike pay when there's
money to be made. I'm goin' up to
the garridge to-morrow mornin' and I'm
goin' to take a car out. So now yer
know.” - -
Two knives and two forks were
placed deliberately upon two tin plates,
and four disgusted and astonished eyes
were levelled at the budding blackleg.
“'Ave you gone up the pole, or
what?” asked Nobby. "…
“What, I should think. You can
all go on strike till the cows come 'ome,
but I'm finished: you don't catch me.”
Nobby was very calm. “Oh,” he
said, “well, if I 'appen to catch you,
you'll go through it, don't forget that.
Do you think it'll pay you to make
a few quid now, and go against all yer
pals, and then when the trouble's settled
be kicked out of the garridge? Why,
if you were 'alf a man . . . .”
In the midst of the heated words
that followed a mysterious stranger
in a greasy frock-coat and a top hat
that looked as if it had been brushed
with a fire hose in full play, sat himself
down next our trio and ordered his
sausage and mash.
“‘Oo's 'is nibs?” asked Nobby of
No. 3. -
“I dunno. Looks too 'appy for a
mute, don't 'e? Never mind abaht 'im.
We got to persuade this 'ere blackleg.”
“’Ow's the strike goin', mates?”
asked the stranger affably. “Are we
down-'earted 2''
“Oh, no, we
ain't down-'earted.
But 'ere, what would you think of a
bloke that wanted to turn it up as soon
as this, eh?”
“Well, I should think 'e was mis-
guided,” replied the stranger. “I know
somethink abaht your troubles. Do I
understand it's our friend 'ere?”
Silence answered in the affirmative.
“My lad”—the stranger addressed
'Arry as if he were talking to his son—
“you think again. D'ye know that
nothink worth 'avin' was ever got
without a fight? 'Ow dare you set up
your puny intelligence against that o'
thousands 2"
He pushed a bit nearer and thrust his
face closer to that of the astonished
blackleg.
“Are you goin' to be the only one to
fly in the face o' this chanst what's
given you to stand up for yer rights? Do
you know that the time of the general
strike is close at 'and 2 Can't you
symperthise with the noble spirit that's
spurrin' your mates on to 'old out till
the cupboard's bare 2"
“Yus, but—”
“'Ave you sunk so low that you
would go out and deliberally take
advantage of your own fellow-workers
by pocketin' the money what they
ought to 'ave only won't cos o' their
principles?”
The stranger stopped for breath.
Nobby and No. 3 at once took up the
cudgels that the stranger had moment-
arily laid down, and in five minutes the
convert was won.
“Now I'ope you won't never think
like that again,” said the stranger
earnestly, and very well pleased with
himself. “You and your mates is out
to win. Don't forgit that. Well, will
you 'ave a cup o' corfee with me, the
three of yer? We'd go over the road
and 'ave a pint each, but I 'aven't time
just now. I've got to be movin'.”
With a lordly “take it out o' that ”
air, he threw a ten-shilling piece on the
table to pay for the coffees and his own
meal, and then rose to go.
“Well, so long, boys,” he said, and
shook hands with all three quite
effusively. “I’m glad we all agree.
Go in and win, mates, that's what I
says. Keep on strikin' and you’ll
strike oil. Yus, and cheap oil at that.
So long. Be good.”
“Ain’t a bad old stick,” said No. 3
when the stranger had departed.
“'Oo is that bloke?” asked Nobby
of the waitress who happened to be
passing at the moment.
“What " 'Im with the tall 'at 2
Don't you know 'im 2 That's old
Charley Barnes. 'E drives a 'ansom
cab. Made a pot o' money the last
week or two. I'm thinkin' o' walkin'
out with 'im.”
ENGLISH BARDS AND AMERICAN
REVIEWERS.
In the Lyric Year: a Great Sym-
posium of Modern American Verse, a
minstrel of the day proclaims the right
of independent judgment in the fol-
lowing fearless lines:–
“To tell the truth about you, Robert
Browning,
I bring no wreath of laurels for your
crowning.”
In humble imitation of this isolated
effort we venture to submit a few
further specimens of much-needed pro-
test against the tyranny of Old-World
conventions. The following quatrain,
inspired by a perusal of Sir Edwin
DURNING - LAwRENCE's illuminating
pamphlet, may assist BACON's greatest
and most persistent champion in his
holy task of dethroning the Stratford
impostor:—
“I pay no homage to the Swan of Avon,
A bird as fabulous as Athene's owl :
I put my money on PoE’s peerless Raven,
A far superior fowl.”
The popular adulation of the late
Laureate, again, finds a salutary cor-
rective in the following couplet:—
“Mark well my words, I cannot give my
benison
To any of the works of ALFRED TENNYson.”
Comparisons are to be deprecated as
a rule, but they are occasionally forced
on us by a regard for the truth. The
claims of America's greatest poet can
be treated in no other way:— -
“As the petulant crowing of shrill cocks
Compares with the lift of the thrush,
So, matched with the magic of WILCox,
Old SAPPHo is shown to be slush.”
This is a theme, however, that invites
further variations:—
“Before the shrine of WILcox (ELLA
WHEELER)
HoMER, were he alive, would be a kneeler;
And ALEXANDER, who was born at Pella,
Would yield his crown to WHEELER WILcox
(ELLA).”
But other Transatlantic bards and
authors must not be forgotten:—
“Great Vol.NEY STREAMER, of Magnolia, Ill.,
Plies an untiring and momentous quill;
KEATs was a trickling rill, a puny dreamer,
But Wol.NEY is a Mississippi Streamer.”
“The soaring muse of talented BLISS CARMAN
Flies higher than the aeroplanes of FARMAN.”
“The bays that formerly old DANTE crowned
Are worn to-day by EzRA Loomis Pou ND.”
“HERodorus was prone to talky-talky;
Not so AUGUSTU's KEELER of Milwaukee.”
“Why prate of WALTER Scott and LAMB and
SHELLEY, -
CARLYLE, MACAULAY, GROTE 2
You have no names like RAPHAELPUMPELLY,
Or AMos STOTE.”
“Great is Apollo when his lyre he twangs,
But greater far is our John KENDRICK BANGs,
Who, born just fifty years ago at Yonkers,
‘Bangs Banagher' and RUDYARD KIPLING
conquers.” -

heard. Mr. BERNARD SHAw's recent
manifesto to theatre audiences, in which
he asks them to refrain from laughter
and applause, has already, we under-
stand, done much to mitigate an evil
which had gone far in the direction of
turning our theatres into mere resorts
for recreation and amusement. We

the part of the Little Ones at Drury
Lane, but that too will come in time.
It is, we know, often contended that
expressions of approval act as a stimulus
to the performer. “It bucks him up
to find them biting back a bit,” as we
have heard. But surely such approval
can be expressed by some other and
better means than mere barbarous
uproar? We ourselves have long ago
adopted the method of taking occasion
of any interval that may occur to
approach the performer and convey to
him, according to his status and the
nature of his art, our gratitude and
appreciation by (1) a slap on the back,
(2) a warm pressure of the hand, or (3) Again, the habit of snoring in church
a dig in the ribs.
But it is not only in theatres that the
Public must learn to observe some
measure of decorum. The time is ripe
for a sweeping, root-and-branch reform
in the matter.
Thus, the custom of shouting personal
remarks to football players must be put
a stop to. It is exasperating, to say
the least, for those of us who have paid
our money with the object of witnessing
a keenly contested game, to have to
submit to repeated interruptions, as is
now the case, while one player or
another bows his acknowledgments or
replies to a greeting from a pal in the
grand stand.
The Cinema. Theatre is another case
in point. There can be no excuse
whatever for the whispered comments,
ejaculations and cat-calls which often
punctuate the performance; and nothing
could be more detrimental to the smooth
running of a film. A favourable im-
pression can surely be conveyed by
other means than these—as for instance
in the form of a private letter of eulogy
addressed to the manager,
cannot be defended. It must be dis-
| - - - -
tracting to the officiating clergyman,
who is not improbably doing his best.
Even at political meetings one can
seldom hear a pin drop.
And emphatically there must be no
more “laughter in court.” Our magis-
terial wits must make up their minds
to forgo this temporary recognition and
content themselves with the more
lasting satisfaction to be obtained from
appreciative notices (generally ample
in scope) in the Press of the following
dav.
“Bands of Turco-Albanians, after pillaging,
set fire to the dwellings and warehouses of
Santi Quaranta, a small seaport of Yanina. . . .
The losses sustained by the unfortunate in-
habitants are estimated at £20,000.

“Other” is good.

intriguing event.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
THE HUMAN HANDICAP.
“FAR be it from me,” said the man
with the onion—“far be it from me to
decry the industry for which the ant,
º and other insects and birds are
—justly or unjustly—famous, but,
nevertheless, I am reasonably certain
that these little creatures are not
compelled to—ah—dig out for their
living to anything like the extent to
which we—Mankind—are compelled
to—ah—dig out . . . I have studied the
question. . . .”
I had encountered him sitting on the
edge of the chalkpit past which runs
the road to the golf links. He was
operating with considerable élan upon
an onion, bread, and some rather
remarkable cheese. His friendly smile,
as I approached, seemed to light up
the whole of a tolerably spacious
landscape, and I liked him at once,
adventurer fallen on evil times though
all the visible evidence proclaimed him.
He appeared to like me also, for he
very generously offered me half his
onion and bread and cheese, which, in
common humanity to the mixed
foursome to which I was proceeding, I
was compelled to decline.
He had made a few casual remarks
on industrial unrest—very restfully
indeed—and therefrom had passed to a
brief consideration of animal and insect
labour.
“Man digs out for many things,
insects for one only,” he said thought-
fully. “I have been watching an ant
throughout lunch . . . Far be it from
me to belittle an ant—but we cannot
ignore the fact that this little crustacean
works only for food. Food only.” He
took a bite at his onion, and I wondered
vaguely if (like the “crustacean”) he
had worked for that.
“We Mankind—on the other hand,
have to work for food and many other
things. And there you have in a
nutshell the reason why birds, insects,
wild animals and many domestic ones,
including fowls, are always happy—
given good health. . . .
“This afternoon, for instance, dull
though it is, the air is full of the songs
of the birds. But I hear no song of
man, listen where I will. And the
reason 2 Man has something else to do.
Like the birds, man (generally speaking)
has already worked long enough to-day
to earn his food. But, unlike the
birds, he has not finished—he has still
to put in enough labour to pay for, say,
a pair of trousers . . .” He gazed ab-
sently at the tasselled ends of his own.
Then he roused himself.
“Clothes generally, that is. The
trouble is that clothes don't grow on a
man, and feathers do grow on birds,”
he said, with a remote irritation in his
voice. “Think that over,” he added.
“It is an interesting and not particu-
larly pleasing side of the question. . . "
He concluded the onion, and produced
a packet of cigarette papers and a small
roll of brown paper.
“Birds again have not to put in a
part of every working day in order to
provide themselves with tobacco,” he
said with a melancholy smile, “or
substitutes for tobacco.” He began
reluctantly to pick off shreds of the
brown paper. I did not realize at first
that he intended to smoke the shreds
when he had unravelled them, and it
was not until he placed the stuff in
position on the cigarette paper that I
apologised and offered him my cigarette
Case.
“Try tobacco,” I said, rather fool-
ishly.
“Thank you, I will,” he replied,
wanly, and cleared the case. Holding
the cigarettes tightly in the warm-
looking hand which had gripped the
onion, he smiled at me.
“Some men would,” he said, almost
playfully, “take the lot, I mean . . . .
Never present your case to a tramp, my
friend . . . .” He sighed and offered
me the handful of cigarettes. “My
joke,” he said; “I only require one.”
But somehow I felt as though I
should not care to smoke that afternoon,
and so I presented them all to the
drifter.
“Very well—if it is your wish,” he
said, and concealed them deftly in his
rags. He was the raggedest drifter I
have yet encountered. “To return to
our subject. Animals, then, triumph
over us in the matter of procuring
clothes. They get a suit for nothing.
And, equally, they triumph in the
matter of wear. Compare the lasting
qualities of an average coat with the
feathers of a bird, the shell of an ant,
or the hair of a rabbit. We have
constantly to be renewing our clothes!
Theirs are everlasting. You see where
we are at a disadvantage 2
“Now as regards rents and rates.
Every living thing but man is a born
builder. Some build nests, some bore
holes, some use hives, and nocturnal
animals, such as bats, are furnished with
hooks on their elbows to hang them-
selves up with when they have finished
out-of-doors. But—and here is the
weak point—only about one man in a
thousand can build a house for himself,
and so we have to waste another part
of our working day in providing for the
cost of the builders' output—time, re-
member, which the bird sets aside for
song. You will see already why man
must work so long and ceaselessly . . .
why the song of man is not often heard
in the land. Speaking for myself, I
never sing. . . .
“Then—and this is almost the last
straw—there are our luxuries to earn.
Birds and things do not use luxuries.
But we have made life a mad and
frenzied struggle in pursuit of luxury.
Motors, hothouse peaches, Havanas,
venison and champagne—we must and
will have them " " His eyes began to
sparkle and he shook his tousled
whiskers in the wind, tossing his head
like an old war-horse who hears afar off
the strident blaring of bugles. He was
using capitals now and a font of larger
type. " Fur-coats, Cognac, Lobster
Salad, Asparagus and Oysters!" He
passed the back of his hand across his
mouth and began carefully to pack up
the relics of his lunch. “Turkish
Coffee, Yachts, Pâté-de-foie - gras,
Salmon Trout, and Derby Winners—
ha! really it makes one wonder whether
the birds have got the laugh of us after
all ! Luxuries | But expensive ones!
Caviare and Diamonds, Egyptian Cigar-
ettes and Polo—no wonder the birds sit
upon boughs and sing. They could
sit there and shout hurray if they only
knew the price of luxuries, the toil and
worry it takes to pay for them.
“Finally—I do not say this in any
spirit of jealousy, but as a matter of
simple fact—there is existent a danger-
ous habit of viewing the methods of
birds and things too indulgently.” A
real indignation manifested itself now
in his voice as in his gestures. “For
instance, all birds are thieves—en-
couraged and protected by Act of
Parliament. My friend, I assure you
that I have seen a blackbird flap into a
cherry-tree, and steal half a peck of fruit,
and spoil another half-peck. Was she
shot at 2 No. Not even scared out of
it. People don't seem to care. ‘Oh,
it's the birds,’ they say simply. But I
put it to you that if I had flapped up to
that cherry - tree and started eating
fruit. . . .”
He ceased abruptly with a dry gulp,
rose and slowly gathered his goods
together, his eyes wandering across the
downs along the road to the workhouse.
“Far be it from me to belittle the
birds, to decry the industry of the ant,”
he repeated, “but . . . think over what
I have said. . . .”
We moved along the road to the foot
of the downs.
“It's a big subject,” he concluded,
absently. “Almost as big as astro-
nomy;” and so drifted leisurely away.
Pro Merito.
“An experienced gentleman desires engage-
ment as assistant in an olice or position of
trust, would accept small retribution.”

“PER PRO.”
“How,” said Francesca, “would you answer this man 2"
“There are,” I said, “a thousand ways, all equally good,
of answering him. There is the familiar way; there is the
haughty third-person way, which involves a presentation of
compliments and a tangled web of pronouns; there is the
stern curt business way; there is * >
“I did not ask,” she said, “for a complete essay on
correspondence. I wanted to know how to answer this
particular man.”
“Quite so,” I said; “I was coming to that. Would it
not be well to let me see his letter first 2 ”
“There may be something in that,” she said. “Yes, it
is a good idea.” And she handed
me the letter, which I read.
“But why,” she said, “give them a date? I never worry
about dating ordinary letters and they seem to get there
all right.” -
“It is always done in business circles,” I said, “but, of
course, women are not brought up with business habits.
They do not understand banking-accounts or pass-books or ||
book-keeping by double entry.” -
“And all these matters,” she said, “are perfectly under-
stood by Hammelstein and Ladenberger and by you. We
are, no doubt, an inferior sex, and we mostly date our letters
“Wed.’ or “Sat." Let us date this one “Wed.’”
“We will do nothing of the sort,” I said. “We will date
it in full, “Wednesday, Jan. 15, 1913. Now for the body
of the letter. Francesca, we will be calm and sarcastic.
How will this do?” I read it
out as I wrote it down:-
“The case,” I said, “presents
no difficulty. This man says he
understands that you take an
interest in beautiful furs. He
solicits the honour of being
allowed to show you a unique
consignment just received from
Hudson's Bay. He declares that
special circumstances enable him
to offer them at an extraordin-
arily cheap rate for cash; and
he adds that, unless you come
to a quick decision, the furs will
be snapped up and you will lose
the chance of a lifetime. He
signs himself, ‘Hammelstein and,
Ladenberger, per pro. A. F.,’ and
he writes from an address in
Clerkenwell.”
“The rapidity with which you
have mastered the contents,”
she said, “is amazing. But tell
me, what does ‘per pro.’ mean?”
“It is,” I said, “a Latin
expression.”
“But do you think that
Hammelstein and Ladenberger
are Latin scholars? And why
should they throw their silly
Latin at me?”
“‘Mrs. Carlyon presents her
compliments to Messrs. Ham-
melstein and Ladenberger x * x
“Per pro. A. F.,’” said Fran-
cesca. “You must put that in.
It sounds so cutting.”
“‘—to Messrs. Hammelstein

they have understood—’ ”
“That doesn't sound quite
right,” she said.
“I will continue,” I said, “as
if you had not interrupted me;
— and fails to gather’—remem-
ber that word, my dear—‘why
or from whom they have under-
- stood that she is interested in
beautiful furs.'”
“But I am,” she said.
“I’m

I'm not.”
“No one,” I said, “is expected
to be absolutely truthful in the
third person. Besides, I haven't
said you're not interested in

“It is just possible,” I said,
“that both Hammelstein and
Ladenberger toy with Latin
verse in their leisure moments. -
Perhaps they are devoted to the Classics. At the same time
it would be rash to infer too much from a mere ‘per pro.’”
“It would be rash,” said Francesca, “to infer too much
from anything; but you haven't told me what it means.”
“Francesca,” I said, “I will not deceive you. Your
dreams of a classical firm of furriers are not warranted by
this letter. “Per pro.’ means that Hammelstein and Laden-
berger have not written this letter themselves. They have
delegated the duty. They have, as it were, given a power
of attorney to A. F. They have made A. F. their proctor.
Francesca, they have put you off with a clerk. Yes, he is
probably a clerk and much underpaid.”
“But how,” she said, “does an underpaid clerk know
that I am interested in beautiful furs ?”
“There are mysteries in Clerkenwell,” I said, “that we
cannot attempt to fathom ; but we can, at any rate, draft an
answer to this letter. Come, Francesca, we will tackle
them in the third person, and first we will date our reply.

(Contributed.)
I HAVE done a bit of shopping in
my time, but never under such perfect
conditions. My first surprise was when
a commissionaire on the pavement
opened the door of my cab and spread
an umbrella for me; my second, the
attentions of a polite gentleman in a
well-fitting frock-coat who met me just
inside and inquired with the utmost
solicitude as to my wishes. This, I
said to myself, is not only business but
pleasure. Having told him what I
wanted, I followed his directions and
made my way to the required depart-
ment, passing ºn route crowds of happy
traffickers, each of whom carried a little
parcel which, from the expression of
their faces, had obviously cost only
half as much as in any other shop and
was twice as good. For these articles
money had been paid and receipts given,
the establishment being a model not
only of excellence and despatch, but also
of organization. As a lady near me
remarked to her astonished companion,
“It's just as I told you, dear, you get
a receipt for everything !”
Meanwhile on all sides the civil
salesmen and saleswomen—for in this
marvellous place both sexes are em-
ployed and, I am convinced, work
amicably together — were displaying
goods on wooden counters made ex-
pressly for that purpose and kept spot-
lessly clean, and were doing it with
such ingratiating' tact that life-long
friendships with customers were being
formed. As another lady near me re-
marked, “Now you see what I said:
the assistants serve the customers here.”
Passing on in a very dream of rapture,
I came at last to the room where my
own modest needs were to be supplied
and where naturally my critical sense
would be most exercised. My every
hope, I say at once, was more than
fulfilled. The articles I wanted were
either in stock or would be procured;
the assistant treated me with respect,
possibly even admiration; my money
was instantly accepted; my receipt was
in order; in short, I was in a com-
mercial paradise and knew it. A little
scrap of conversation which I over-
heard at this time fortified my own
opinion. “Whatever they haven't got,”
said a lady to her friend, “they always
promise to get; ” and her friend's ex-
pression of bewilderment, gratitude and
joy will not soon fade from my memory.
And so I came away from this fairy
palace, a little piqued, possibly, at not
1eceiving a parting gift of a five-pound
note, but otherwise in a glow of enthu-
siasm for everything connected with
the place and its superb and startling
efficiency.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAR
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, January
13.−Fog outside; fog inside; plenty
of room for it here. As it broods
over half-empty benches one seems to
recognise a coronetted head
suggestive of House of Lords
taking look round, preliminary
to making quick end of a
measure that has occupied full
forty days of labour in the
Commons.
“Fee, fi, fo, fum,
Ismell the blood of an Englishman,”
was the remark, clear in drift
if faulty in rhyme, of an ogre
familiar in childhood. Fee, fi,
fo, fum. House of Lords smells
the blood of another Home Rule
Bill and means to drink every
drop of it.
The SPEAKER, looking up after
Questions were over, very nearly
varied long career of correctitude
by a curious blunder. Catching
sight of humanised figure of the
Fog standing at the Bar, and
thinking it was a newly-elected
Member, he was about to say, “Members
desiring to take their seats will please
come to the Table.” Just in time realised
actual situation. Adroitly coughed by
way of intimating that so far from
having intended to make a remark it was
only the Fog that had got into his throat.
Weird effect increased by glimpses
caught in Gallery facing SPEAKER's
Chair of faces apparently bodyless.
These were the strangers
peering through the Fog won-
dering what had become of His
Majesty's Ministers. With the
exception of two they were cer-
tainly not in their places when
Questions were called on. As
for Front Opposition Bench, it
was, save for the Fog, tenantless.
Later, when House resumed
consideration of Home Rule
Bill on Report Stage, BonneR
LAw turned up and, as ever,
obedient to call of duty, con-
tributed a speech criticising
Clause 40.
Straightway had occasion to
wish he had been altogether lost
in the Fog on his way down.
MAsoN (of Coventry), following
him, administered castigation so
vigorous that as he spoke the
Fog in his immediate neigh-
bourhood judiciously cleared
away, leaving him standing out

awaiting Third Reading, Welsh
Church Bill gets a look in.
Welsh Bill and Irish Bill re-
semble each other inasmuch as
mere mention of Order of the Day
is signal for stampede. When,
immediately after Questions, the
first Order is read by Clerk at
Table — to - day, for example,
“Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill;
Committee”—it behoves the Sergeant-
at-Arms to advance to Table and re-
move the Mace, which lies upon it
only when, with SPEAKER in Chair,
House is in full session. Of late this
has become a practice as perilous as
crossing Trafalgar Square at high-tide
of traffic. Stream of Members hurrying
out threatens to catch up Sergeant-at-
Arms and carry him forth on
crest of wave. Only natural
grace and long-trained habit
enable Sir DAVID ERSKINE to
stem the current with dignity,
not to speak of personal safety.
Those who remain to carry on
debate make up in vigour of
speech for lack of numbers.
Considering we are talking about
a venerated Church, with its re-
tinue of bishops, rectors, vicars,
and all that, not forgetting the
charwoman, our language is
occasionally awful.

and lay holders of freehold

here that EDGAR Jones drama-

simpering charwoman on his
arm. If compensation was go-
ing round she, he insisted, had

THE RED HEADS.
A GREAT meeting was held in the
Scarlet Town Hall, under the auspices
of the Rufus League, on Friday last,
to discuss the alleged decrease in the
numbers of red-headed people and to
devise means to defeat it. . The Rufus
League, we may add, was originally
founded by the Norman king of that
name, and has always consisted of
twenty-two members, who are known
familiarly as the Twenty-two Carrots.
The Chair was taken by the Presi-
dent, Sir RUFUs Is AACs, who, in
accordance with the rules, opened the
proceedings by singing “O Ruddier
than the Cherry,” the anthem of the
League. He then called on the Sec-
retary, the Right Hon. Lord Justice
Cherry—to whom we believe HANDEL
dedicated the song in question—to
read the letters from various members
and sympathisers who were unable to
attend. Foremost amongst them was
a spirited contribution from Mr. Ruddy
KIPLING, two lines of which we are
allowed to reproduce by kind permission
of his publishers:—
“Never the dingo dozes, never the bulrushes
shoot
But a red-polled son of England starts out
on the All-Red route.”
The PoET TIAUREATE in a remarkable
letter pointed out that GoLDSMITH
| began one of his most famous poems
with the words “Sweet Auburn.”
Mr. HALL CAINE, who enclosed a
photograph of himself taken by the
new chrono-chrome process, wrote that,
if he might be permitted to jest on such
a subject, nothing was red about BAcon
except his works, while SHAKSPEARE,
like BAYARD and Another who should
be nameless, favoured in his chevelure
the hue immortalized in the portraits
of TITIAN.
Dr. C. W. SALEEBY, the famous
Professor of Eugenics, sent a brief but
momentous memorandum on the best
means of fostering the red corpuscles
which conduce to the pigmentation of
the capillary follicles. In his opinion
this could be best arrived at by a diet
of tomatoes, ginger and beetroot,
washed down by liberal potations of
Burgundy, Barolo and Chianti.
Sir RUFUs Is AACs, who was much
moved during the reading of the last
letter, then addressed the meeting. He
began by reminding them that his own
presence there in such an exalted
position was due rather to his name
than his mane. He then went on to
enumerate the losses which England
would suffer if this picturesque feature
of her rural and civic life were allowed
to die out. A red-haired man, wherever
seen, never failed to bring into the

as different as CoRot and LANDSEER
so esteemed; while a red-haired girl,
wherever seen, was like a glint of gold.
(Loud cheers.) Were they to dis-
appear, what would become of that
curious enactment of nature which
provided that whenever one met a red-
haired girl one could see at the same
time a white horse? Scientists had
for centuries puzzled their brains to
explain why this was, but in vain.
Yet the strange fact remained. As to
what were the causes of the decrease
in red hair no one could rightly say.
Many Unionists believed that the
Government at large, and Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE in particular, had discouraged
it, and were to be blamed in the matter.
But when they remembered that Mr.
LLOYD GEORGE was named after DAVID,
the ruddy antagonist of the Philistines,
they could hardly accept this view.
He himself saw some hope for the
future from Canada, in view of the
notoriously red hair of General WolfE.
\Gueers) Whatever they did, they
must not lose hope. He himself, as
a member of the most optimistic
Cabinet of recent times, would never
do so. (Renewed cheers.)
Mr. BERNARD SHAw, who apologised
for being not so fiery as he once was,
the alloy of old age having dimmed
his furnace—in other words, grey hair
having supervened—then spoke. He
said that as a descendant of Owen Roe
O'NEILL and a sympathiser with the
Red Hand of Ulster, though at the same
time a fervent supporter of maintaining
the Green above the Red, he fully ap-
proved of the aims and objects of the
League. He called upon his twenty-one
fellow Carrots to pledge themselves to
do everything in their power to impress
upon Society the merits of ruddiness.
He himself was writing a play to that
end. (Cheers.) With Dr. SALEEBy's
excellent programme he found himself
in agreement, except as regarded the
beverages. For the wines named he
would suggest substituting ginger ale
—(marked depression) and red ink—
(groans). Only on those conditions
| could he
retain his membership.

solved itself into a free fight, everybody
seeing red.)

“The restaurant was also doing a large
business, many dinner parties being held to
partake of the special men which had been
provided.”—Bombay Gazette.
A correspondent, whose heart is in
the right place, complains of the way
in which her letters have been treated
in the pillar-boxes. They come to her,
she says, “smeared all over with
suffragetted hydrogen.”

at St. Paul's Church, Fairhaven, was broken

AT THE PLAY.
“GET-RICH-QUICK WALLINGFord.”
IN my anxiety to be a true admirer
of America and her genius, I would
give a lot to know that the plays which
she is now sending us were composed
exclusively for our market, just to see
to what lengths the dull Britisher would
let his silly leg be pulled before he
found out. But unhappily all these
dramas come trailing clouds of glory
accumulated in the course of prodigious
careers on the other side; and this
means, if it means anything, that the
samples which they give us of vulgar
roguery on the one hand and stupid
cupidity on the other have been warmly
acknowledged by the American public
as representative of typical features in
the national character. I cannot bear
to believe this, and yet I may not do
our friends the effrontery of disputing
their opinion of themselves as reflected
in their own mirror of life.
This opinion was further endorsed
by the U.S.A. colony in London, who
figured in great force on the first night.
All the humours of Mr. Cohan's play
were received by them with a very loud
enthusiasm, in which I could seldom
join, though I must have seen some of
the points. Every American present
seemed to have a financial interest in
the enterprise, or at least to regard the
national honour as being staked on its
success.
One thing I am thankful for: we need
never again worry about an enigma that
must often have troubled the thinking
mind—how it is that in America, where

everybody is so smart, there is so much
money to be made and so quickly. How
can they even make a living by taking
one another in 2 Well, I gather from
Ready Money — and the revelation is
supported by Get-Rich-Quick Walling-
ford—that our minds had been abused;
that we were wrong in imagining that
all Americans are smart. It seems that
the mugs over there enjoy a numerical
superiority of at least ten to one.
It was a flaw in the new play that
its mugs were such “easy fruit.” The
leading rogue never found an opponent
worthy of his steel. In Ready Money
it was a square fight all through—
diamond cut diamond—with the detec-
tive force. Here the only trouble, and
soon settled, was with a pretty typing-
girl.
I see in a brochure published by the
Management that the play “points
that excellent moral, “Honesty is the
best policy.’”. Let me, as a moralist,
warn the British public against this
misleading statement. It so happens
that a stroke of fortune gives a crown
of unpremeditated honesty, in a techni-
cal sense, to a scheme conceived and
executed in a spirit of the purest fraud.
These rogues do ill by stealth and wake
to find it fame. It was no fault of
theirs.
Let me also warn this same innocent
public against their persuasive charm.
Mr. HALE HAMILTON, with that in-
sinuating voice and accent and smile
of his, was irresistible for his victims on
both sides of the footlights. There is
something almost Greek in his catholic
feeling for the joy of life. Our British
stage-villains—burglars always ex-
cepted—are not built that way. They
take their vices, as the virtuous take
their pleasures, with a spice of sadness.
And this, of course, is morally sound.
But, put your morality aside as you
enter—there are cloak-rooms provided
in all modern play-houses—and you
will get a lot of simple fun out of
Wallingford. But you must not mind
the noise and rush; the constant in-
cursions, at full speed, of negligible
people all busy in establishing an
atmosphere of American hustle; or
the endless introductions of one unim-
portant person to another which con-
stitute the dominant feature of the last
Act. And your sophisticated minds
must bear with the simple irony, mildly
Sophoclean, by which the villains
offer to take the audience into their
confidence.
And at the end, if you have not
laughed quite as freely as you were told
you were going to, do not cast doubt
on the American sense of humour, but
put the trouble down to your British
lack of it. This is the true hospitality.
“BILLY's ForTUNE.”
The maker of Billy's Fortune—I
refer to his adoptive father, and not
to Mr. Roy HoRNIMAN–was never seen
by us, for he was a corpse before the
curtain rose; but if his last will and
testament revealed the man he must
have been something of a humorist.
For in the first place he disappointed
his relations of the bulk of his fortune,
leaving it to Billy, a “pauper brat”;
BEAR-BAITING.
Mr. Bradley (Mr. E. M. Robson) tries to
conciliate Billy (Master JoHNNIE BRowN) with
a present for a good boy.
and, secondly, he bequeathed £100,000
to whichever family Billy should elect
to make his home with, after a three
months' test of each. Though ignorant
of this condition, Billy at once recog-
nises that he is meant to be spoiled,
and lends every possible assistance to
that end. Six months have elapsed
and we see him in the hands of No. 3
of the spoilers. He has developed into
a sort of “Buster Brown,” and has the
whole ménage under his little heel;
his wildest freaks of behaviour being
tolerated, since correction is unthink-
able if his hosts are to secure a
favourable report. What with loss of
self-respect, and mutual suspicion as
between the competitors, it is a sad
revelation of some of the most de-
plorable aspects of human nature.
This kind of thing is only possible
on the stage if it goes without , a
check to the laughter; and, to be
frank, the Second Act had its intervals
of repose. But there were hilarious
moments, as when the entire household
paraded, as a military band, in various
sketchy uniforms, under the dragooning
of the Napoleonic infant.
In the Third Act we find Billy trans-
ferred to the care of an ideally happy
young couple. They, too, would be
glad to touch the money, but are not
going to sacrifice their own souls—or
Billy's—in the process. Accordingly,
on the very first evening (Christmas

spoiling of the child is over for ever.
By 10 P.M. he is one of the family,
sitting in pyjamas round the fire and
| listening contentedly to a fairy-tale, a
thing he had never done before. It
was a refreshing scene, made pretty
by the mother and children, and restored
our belief in humanity. And if there
was just a suspicion of priggishness in
the voices of the parents, this defect of
virtue should be easily remedied.
“Train up a child,” says SoLoMon,
“in the way he should go, and . . . he
will not depart from it.” It was there-
fore no shock to me in the last Act when
Billy elected to take up his permanent
residence with this admirable family.
I trust that the character of little
Master John NIE BRowN, who played
Billy with considerable intelligence
and aplomb, will not be unfavourably
affected either by the preliminary
booming of him in the Press or by his
early contact with the seamy side of
human nature. Of the grown-ups, that
delightful actor, Mr. O. B. CLARENCE,
as one of the designing relations, bore
the chief burden in a part that suited
his distressful methods, though I can
imagine him funnier. The others fell
easily into the picture; but a kindly
Providence has given Miss MANSFIELD
too genial a countenance for the
austerity of such a rôle as that of Aunt
Fanny.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Mr. Sheringham and Others (MILLS AND Boon) is the latest
production of that clever lady, Mrs. ALFRED SIDGwick, and
displays her art in various lights all good, if not quite the
best. Mr. Sheringham, you should be told, is a long short
story, almost a novel. The Others are short short stories,
and some sketches so slight as not to be stories at all. Mr.
Sheringham, however, is capital fun—a tale with all the
right elements of popularity: a poor heroine, friendless in
Paris, and some wicked adventurers who almost murdered
her to obtain some valuable shares, which she carried
let us say, The Salchester Guardian. But, to turn from
the background to the characters, Mr. GILBERT CANNAN has
made a sporting if rather too ambitious attempt to chronicle
the doings and inter-relations of a large clerical family (there
were ten of the Folyats, counting the parents), an attempt
that has hardly been rivalled, perhaps, since the days of
Miss CHARLOTTE YoNGE, though what that good lady
would have said to her successor's tiresomely emancipated
views on life and love, as expressed through the lips of
Serge, the Bohemian eldest son, I shudder to think.
They were an unhappy family, the Folyats, from little James,
who fell off the roof on page 46, to Frederick, who shot
himself in the train on page 332; and the whole book is
about with her, as heroines
do, in a little bag. This, of
course, was after she had
been enriched by the gifts of
a kind uncle, a financier, who,
having presented her with
stock certificates worth fifty
thousand pounds, left her
quite alone in a strange land,
at the mercy of a couple so
patently villainous that one's
flesh crept to read about
them. You will now not be
astonished to hear that
comic relief is supplied by a
page-boy º and a
friendly cook, who fulfil their
| obvious purpose by helping
the heroine in moments of
urgent need. You will also
be prepared for my statement
that the whole thing shows
Mrs. SIDGwick as a teller
of effective stories, such as
many writers could manage
with equal success, rather
than as the creator of any-
thing so exquisite as, for
example, The Severins. But

I have discovered a jolly
winter evening game for the inhabitants of Manford
and Salchester on the banks of the river Irsley. They
must buy copies of Mr. GILRERT CANNAN's new book,
Round the Corner (MARTIN SECKER), and go through it
carefully, trying to identify the names of local streets
and buildings through the not too difficult fog of aliases
with which the author has enshrouded them. They will
like the game, I think, but I am not at all so sure that
they will like Mr. GILBERT CANNAN. For he has very few
good things to say of what he calls “the darker half of
our town on the north bank of the poisoned river.” And
when I read such sentences as “he walked to the station
through the dark railway arches, through Town Hall Square
with its statues of John Bright, the late Bishop, the Prince
Consort, and a local philanthropic sweater,” I envy with a
deep envy the task of the man who reviews this book for,

stituted a further series of adventures with Red Indians
and such. I ought to tell you that she has been invented
by Mrs. Alice. WILson Fox, who gives to the book the
certainly very appropriate title of A Regular Madam (MAG-
MiLLAN). It is a story of simple but pleasant, and entirely
wholesome happenings chiefly intended for the daughters
of gentlemen, to whom indeed it should make a strong
appeal.

[For once in a way the Party Whips were taken off and Members

very strange and complicated intrigues resulted from the Cabinet's

That hurtle through the deafened lobbies,
Cross-questions and oblique replies
From those who back their several hobbies,
All, like the polyglots of Babel,
Talking as hard as ever they are able 2
What should portend this curious breach
Of Liberal tie and Tory tether;
Old foes embracing each with each
And friends at fisticuffs together,
So that you get no sort of clue
From party labels as to who is who?
Can Reason from her throne have fled?
Over some riddle, dark and knotty,
Has Parliament mislaid her head
And gone (in vulgar diction) dotty 2
Nay! 'Tis the voice, long out of use,
The still small voice of Conscience breaking loose.
Conscience at play! Ah, picture how,
Ever the sport of cruel lashes
Laid by the Whips on back and brow,
All pink and blue with weals and gashes,
Trodden beneath the tyrant's boots,
Goaded and herded like dumb driven brutes—

Was lifted from his neck, poor martyr,
Like an emancipated moke
Free to enjoy the winds' wide charter,

And filled the air with blithe, discordant squeals.

To play once more the hopeless party-hack.

Sworn to the bidding of their sweaters,
And soak in that abysmal sink—

ALL THE WORLD'S A SCHOOL.
HAVING noticed in a contemporary an interview with
Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE, in which the great actor
said not only, “I am completing my education by touring
the world,” but “I hope my holiday may be beneficial to
my art, and therefore a benefit to the public,” the Secre.
tary of the Royal Geographical Society at once hurried to
the home of the illustrious histrion with the purpose of
putting a number of supplementary or “arising-out-of”
questions. ..
He found Sir HERBERT three deep in the paraphernalia
of travel. Móccasins and snowshoes jostled mosquito nets
and sombreros. Here was an alpenstock, there an ice
hatchet; guns, boots, howdahs, pith helmets were every-
where. GALToN's Art of Travel lay on the floor, and beside
it copies of Near Home and Far Off. Medicine chests were
filled; “crates containing beads and gaily coloured
cloths (for the natives) were being packed; busts of
STANLEY and Captain Cook stood on the mantelpiece, each
wearing a wreath.
In the midst of this confusion was Sir HERBERT.
“What can I do for you?” he asked, with his profound
and unfailing courtesy.
“Observing,” replied the visitor, “that you have selected
travel as the medium by which you are to complete your
education, I thought it would be interesting to inquire how
far you mean to go?”
“My plans are not too definite,” said Sir HERBERT.

Sir HERBERT TREE boughed, as to the manner born.

THE MILO MEASURE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I wonder if you
will be sweet enough to act as my
advance agent in booming a little
practical feminine invention which I
am about to place on the market. As
you know very well, the Venus di Milo
represents that absolute ideal of pro-
portion which every woman aims at,
though, of course, the lady in the
| Louvre is on the large side and a little
battered about the extremities. As no
doubt you are also aware, some years
ago certain artistic experts took the
measurements of the statue and re-
duced them to normal human scale and
have supplied the world with the
measurements which are exactly those
which the Venus di Milo would have
possessed if she had been a living
woman of 5ft. 4 in. in height. Now,
this table has hitherto apparently re-
presented a hopelessly unattainable
ideal, until quite recently the feminine
| world was fluttered by the news of an
American girl whose measurements are
claimed to approximate to those of the
ness of The Daily Mirror to find a and bring a rosy atmosphere of classical
successful rival in England, and, that
being speedily accomplished, I think
I may say without exaggeration that
the interest in Milo measurements has
become so universally keen that nearly
every woman of average height on both
sides of the Ocean has been busy with
a tape measure.
I was lately assisting at one of these
private séances, and it was when I
noticed how frightfully bucked my
friend was to find that her neck and
ankles, for instance, were all right, and
how disheartened she grew to find her
waist and fore-arm, shall we say, were
all wrong, that a great inspiration for
the benefit of my sex flashed across my
brain. -
That inspiration has now borne
fruit in “The Milo Measure,” price 1/-
in untarnishable nickel case (patent
applied for). I guarantee that this
dainty toilet necessity, on which the
Milo measurements are marked out—
7.4 inches for ankle, 13.2 for calf, 26 for
waist, and so on—will make Venuses of
all women of average height, and thus
beauty to many a grey suburban home.
All that the purchaser has to do in
order to make her proportions come out
identical with those of the Milo is to
grasp the end of the Measure between
the thumb and finger of the left hand,
place the thumb and finger of the right
hand firmly on the particular number of
inches required, and apply the Measure
to each limb or feature in turn. The
Measure will do the rest.
Yours very sincerely, Eva.
P.S.–I am confidently counting on
your assistance, dear Mr. Punch, as my
advance agent, so I think it is only
right to inform you that “The Milo
Measure" is made of elastic web.

RUPERT.
RUPERT, the horse, came to us with
the best references, and I'm sure he
always meant well and tried his hardest,
but we all have days when things go
wrong and we feel like slamming the
door or smashing something, and I
think that was Rupert's trouble on the
ill-fated morning.
Papa has an excellent custom of
riding about the neighbourhood on
horseback to shake up his—to keep
him fit, and that was where Rupert
came in ; and, as I was saying, he was
a conscientious horse and as a rule did
the job well. -
On the morning in question
Papa had gone out riding and
I was doing the housekeeping,
and was in fact in the kitchen
expounding the Insurance Act to
the cook for about the twentieth
time. It seemed to her un-
reasonable that she might not
immediately begin to draw in
some benefits, and I was at
great pains making it clear to
her that the game couldn't begin
till she gotill or married or some-
thing, and that for the present
she must derive what satisfaction
she could from contemplating
her card, which really looked
very pretty with the stamp-col-
lection on it.
The discourse was interrupted
by the advent of Papa, who came
in rather furtively through the
back door with his hair awry
and a lot of mud on his clothes.
There was not the least doubt
what had happened to him.
“Ah, Felicity,” he began,
“I—I’ve just returned—rather
unexpectedly.”
“Oh, Papa,” I cried, “have
you fallen off?”
“Certainly not,” he answered .
“I came away. I was too indignant
to discuss the matter with them at any
length: I could find no excuse for their
behaviour. If they wished to dance
they should have wait od until a suit-
able occasion presented itself. It's a
growing scandal, you know. Bad
enough for people to go about without
visible means of support. They should
at least observe the common courtesies
of the highway.”
“Yes,” I said, “advice would have
been wasted on them; but what did
you do with Rupert?”
“Well,” he said, “it was rather a
problem. He was a little difficult to

to parley with them, and I kept an eye
on the proceedings from behind the
window-curtain.
It was soon evident that they were
demanding most extortionate sums for
salvage, and I began to be afraid that
Papa would be unable to cope with the
situation, so I decided on immediate
action, and, raising the sash, leaned out.
“Papa, papa,” I cried.
“Yes, my dear.”
“An awful thing's happened. The
bloodhounds have escaped. They've
eaten the under-gardener and they're
tearing round the shrubbery.”
The tramps threw up the game at
– once. In five seconds they were
out of sight.
It took some time to reassure
Papa, who at first believed that
there really were bloodhounds
concealed about the premises.
| “Well, I thought you might
have got some, Felicity,” he
said ; “I never know what
you'll do next.”
As a matter of fact we haven't
any dog at all. The idea was
mºoted a short time ago, but
|Dora the cat and Stephen the
hedgehog filed a petition against
it and the proposal was dropped.
For some days the fate of
|Rupert was the chief topic under
discussion. Papa said he felt he
could never be reconciled to him
again and refused even to go
near the stable, and in the mean-
while Rupert took life easily
and ate his head off.
“We'd better give him a
month's notice,” I said. -
“Not at all,” said Papa.
“You don't do that with horses.

dear? How did it happen?”
However, Papa was disinclined to
relate the adventure in the presence of
cook, naturally enough, and it was not
till he had changed his clothes that
I learned the details.
It appeared that all had gone well
until they reached the open country,
where they encountered two dis-

and executed a dance in front of the
indignation, reared up, and Papa lost

For a moment he seemed to brighten

his head.

This worked out all right. The

do the rest.

However, the people at TATTERIDGE's
entered him as a “Good hack. Quiet
to ride for a lady.” The red tape there
is about as bad as in any Government
department. I'm sure with my testi-
monial he would havo gone off very
well, instead of being knocked down,
as Papa said, for a mere song. Rupert
wouldn't like that.
And so for a time Papa was horse-
less and went about like ordinary
people; but it didn't suit him. His
temper began to get fretful. I decided
that he must have something to jog
his—to exercise him, and I came and
talked to him seriously.
“Why don't you get another horse,
Papa?" I said.
“Another one?"
“Yes; get a nice tame one, you
know.”
“Oh, no,” he said. “That wouldn't
do at all. I want a horse with a lot of
mettle. Of course it must have some
self-control as well.”
“Well, couldn't you get one like
that?" I suggested. “You oughtn't
to give up your riding, you know.”
“Yes, I daresay I could,” he said.
“I'm a pretty fair judge of a horse.
I'll look in at TATTERIDGE's to-morrow
and see if I can find one to suit me.”
I would have gone with him, but
I had a party on that afternoon—
Blindman's Buff and Coon-Can, I think
it was.
I got back from it rather late and
found Papa already returned, fearfully
pleased with himself and looking very
horsey with a large cigar in his mouth
and a whisky-and-soda on the mantel-
piece.
“What success 2 " I asked.
“Picked out the very horse,” he said.
“Rather expensive. Cost a good deal
more than Rupert, but well worth the
money.”
“Where is he 2''
“I rode him back. He's in the
stables. Come round and see him.”
He showed him off with great pride.
I walked all round the horse. He
winked at me and whisked his tail
towards Papa.
“I suppose you didn't meet any
tramps on the way down,” I said.
“No. Why?"
“Well, if you had, he might have
given himself away.”
“Who might?”
“Rupert.”

MUSICAL NOTES.
THE successful appearance of the
banjo at the Queen's Hall Symphony
Concerts on Saturday week is, we are
glad to learn, likely to be followed by a
further invasion of the orchestral pre-
serves by instruments hitherto deemed
unworthy of such an honour. The
prospectus of the New Romantic
Orchestral Concerts, just issued, an-
nounces that on April 1st Mr. Oliver
Pilditch will produce a new symphony
by Professor Quantock de Banville,
entitled “The Brontës,” dedicated to
Mr. CLEMENT Short ER. The sym-
phony, which will occupy ninety
minutes in performance, is not only
scored for every one of the instruments
employed in MAHLER's Seventh Sym-
phony, but also includes parts for a
quartet of penny whistles, and a solo
“Brilliantine Zither-Comb,” which will
be played on this occasion by Mr.
SHORTER himself. -
Another novelty to be produced later
in the season is a Mystical Tone Poem,
entitled “The Wandering Jew,” by
Mr. Hamish MacSlazenger, the young
Russo-Scottish composer who is already
known as the Moscow-Glasgow Strauss.
In a brief but alluring account of the
new composition Mr. Oliver Pilditch
informs us that no key signature is
affixed to any of the fifteen movements
of which the work is made up, and that
it has practically no tonality at all. A
wonderful effect is produced in the
Scherzo, in which four barrel-organs
are introduced, each playing different
tunes in different keys and each sur-
mounted by a monkey wearing a red
coat, while the motto theme, or idée fice,
is always given out by a group of Jew's
harps, specially constructed for the
occasion and called the “Magnifico
Pomposo Solomon Glory - Harps.”
These, it is reassuring to hear, will
be played by real Rabbis. The score of
the Symphony, which occupies just
under two hours in performance, mea-
sures 4 × 4 × 2 parasangs and weighs
almost exactly 62 poods.
Mr. Odo Gurglitz, the manager of
Mr. Bamberger, writes to us with
reference to the tragic experiences of
DANIEL MELSA, the Polish violinist
now performing in London, on which
so much stress has been laid in the
Press. In the biographical sketch of
DANIEL MELSA, which is now being
circulated, we read how during an anti-
Jewish pogrom at Lodz in 1905 his
playing melted the heart of the Cossack
leader and saved the fiddler's life.
Mr. Gurglitz observes that he has
not the smallest intention of disputing
the absolute accuracy of the above
statement. All he wishes to point out,
in justice to Mr. Bamberger, is that on
at least four several occasions he (Mr.
Bamberger) was exposed to dangers
compared with which the ordeal of
DANIEL MELSA was a trivial experience.
The occasions were as follows: in
September, 1907, Mr. Bamberger was
captured by the Fifo fumi cannibals in
New Guinea and was partially eaten
before he was rescued by a punitive
expedition commanded by Mr. Gurglitz
and the famous ex-cannibal chieftain,
Gobolo, whose beautiful daughter,
Ispovispop, entertained a romantic
but unrequited affection for Mr.
Bamberger. The second occasion was
in Odessa in 1909, where Mr. Bam-
berger was blown up by Nihilists
while he was playing the piano, and
came down unhurt at a distance of
nearly 200 yards, although the piano
was smashed to atoms.
Mr. Bamberger's third escape was
in 1910 from a boa constrictor of the

The prosperity of rag-and-bone-time

going up by leaps and bounds. Mean-

advances, due to a strong desire in the
less nutty circles of society to escape

THE NICE PEOPLE.
This is a true story and the idea of
it is to show how awfully decent—but
you will see what I am driving at as
you read on.
I had special reasons for ringing up
my friend Burgess, but I did not know
his number. I knew it had a 1, a 7, an
8 and a 4 in it somewhere, and was
Mayfair; beyond that I was misty.
Passing these figures in review, I
decided it was 1478, and asked for that.
A pleasant voice came back, “Hullo!”
“Is that you, Burgess?” I said.
“No. There is no one of that name
here.”
“But isn't that Mr. Burgess's tele-
phone?” -
“No. What number did you want?”
“Oh, I'm frightfully sorry. I've
made a mistake.”
“Never mind. Don't mention it. It
doesn't matter in the least.”
I then asked for 1748.
A pleasant voice came back, “Hullo!”
“Is that you, Burgess?”
“No, this isn't Burgess. What num-
ber do you want?”
Again I apologised profusely; again
the reply was sympathetic. “Don't
trouble. It's all right.”
I next asked for 1874.
A pleasant voice came back, “Hullo!”
“Hullo! ” I said.

“ No.”
“Is Mr. Burgess in 2"
“Mr. Burgess does not live here.
What number did you ask for?”
Again I apologised, and again the
reply was kindly: “It's all right.
Some mistake of the operator, I expect.
It doesn't matter.”
Once more I decided to try, and this
time I asked for 1784.
A pleasant voice came back, “Hullo!"
“Hullo!” I said. “Is that Mr. Bur-
gess's number?”
“No, it 's not.”
“Oh, I'm so sorry. The fact is I've
forgotten it.” -
“Isn't it in the book 2"
“No, he won't have it there.”
“What a nuisance! How very un-
fortunate for you! But why don't you
ring up the enquiry office? They'll
tell you.”
“Thanks awfully, I will.”
“It's all right. Good-bye.”
Now wasn't that jolly? Not one of
all that crowd angry or even irritated.
All as nice about it as they could be.
I then rang up the office and found
that Burgess's number (as I at once
remembered) is 1847.
A waspish voice came back, “Hullo!
Who's there?"
“Is that you, Burgess?”
“Yes, of course it is.”
“All right, old chap.
Harrison.”
“I know it is. Do you suppose I
can't recognise your voice? Why on
earth haven't you rung me up before?
Here have I been waiting here for

And they were all strangers, and this
was my friend!

House of Commons, Monday, January lined up before the Mace to declare

round. Great achievement was vindica-
tion of the rights of British citizens
grossly assailed under cover of the
Shops Act. According to his story,
told in the ear of a thronged and deeply
moved House, there is a carrier—(no,
Sir CHARLEs ALFRED, not Cripps)—
trading between Bristol and Portishead,
having for sole retinue a small but
hungry boy. For some time it has
been his custom of an afternoon to
present largesse to his escort in the
form of “a pennyworth of biscuits pur-
chased at a refreshment room in Pill.”
Avowedly under coercion from the
Shops Act, the purveyor of biscuits
declines to trade on an early-closing
day, arguing that “biscuits are con-
fectionery, not refreshments.”
And so, as in the case of Mother
Hubbard's dog, the poor boy had none.
He might, of course, swallow Pill.
But there are contingencies which
naturally make the carrier unwilling
to undertake responsibility of adminis-
tering it. In his dilemma he brought
the matter under notice of the MAD
HATTER, who left it in hands of Homr,
SECRETARY, with request that he “will
issue a memorandum or order to make
it clear that carriers' boys and other
travellers may ask for biscuits, even in
small amounts, without being refused
on the plea that biscuits are only
sweetmeats and not proper food.”
Business done.—In Committee on
Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill.
Tuesday.—Great slump in Silver-
Market Gwyn NE. In accordance with
recent habit, spent week-end in his
study, wet towel bound about his
manly brow, preparing fresh set of con-
undrums for India Office about trans-
action in silver carried through London
market a year ago. Question paper
bristled with them. Not your ordinary
questions drafted by amateurs like
KINLoch-CookE or John REEs (late of
India). Each one equivalent to argu-
mentative speech on topic to be handled
only by a specialist.
This bad enough had it stood
alone. Merely preliminary procedure.
FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO WAR OFFICE,
who in absence of MonTAGU answers
for India Office, faces ordeal with
commendable courage. Reads with-
out quaver in his voice or trembling
in his limbs matter-of-fact answers in
reply to allegations and insinuations
pointing to something like criminal
conspiracy on part of India Office and
a City firm to pocket what in America
is known as “graft.” When he resumes
his seat up gets Gwyn NE with auto-
matic regularity and in slightly different
phrase repeats conundrum.
Hitherto SPEARER, jealous for full
play of freedom of speech, has permitted
this sort of thing. To-day's experience
too much for patience whose long-
suffering sometimes amazes House.
At outset of Gwyn NE's performance
SPEAKER insisted that notice should be
given of Supplementary Question pro-
posed to be put.
Regardless of the snub, Gwyn NE put
twelfth question, when slump alluded to
took place.
“These Supplementary Questions,”
said the SPEAKER, “are all in the nature
of arguments suitable for discussion,
but not for the purpose of obtaining
information.”

of Supplementary Questions, SPEAKER,
amid general cheering, again interposed.
“Complaints,” he said, “are made
to me that the end of Questions on
Paper is rarely reached, many of which
notice was duly, given being barred by
number of Supplementary Questions in
the nature of argument.”
The MEMBER For SARK, who has
been saying this with perhaps tiresome
reiteration through two sessions that
have seen unrestrained growth of in-
defensible irregularity, naturally grati-
fied at this ruling by supreme authority.
Business done—Still (Welsh) harping

Friday.—There is a matter, perhaps
trifling in itself but strikingly illustra-
tive of the systematic belittling of
Woman by Man, not alluded to in to-
day's debate on Suffrage question. On
entering the Ladies' Gallery, whether
with or without intention of chaining
themselves to rail, visitors are con-
fronted by a card hung in prominent
position. On it is printed in large type
the word “SILENCE 1" Why should
this designedly offensive injunction be
flaunted in the Ladies' Gallery? Im-
mediately opposite is the Strangers'
Gallery, where men do congregate.
You may search its walls and its ap-
proaches in vain for repetition of this
command.
“We 'll soon alter that,” murmured
a section of the company crowding
Ladies' Gallery this afternoon.
Nor is intention to snub exhausted by
this mean device. Withdrawing from
Gallery to Tea Room at the back,
Ladies approaching the fire - place
observe boldly carved over the mantel-
piece the brusque command, “Get
Understanding.” It need hardly be
said that this insolent injunction,
with implied suggestion of mental
density more or less nearly approaching
imbecility, is reserved exclusively for
womankind. It is not to be found
within sight of any part of the House
where Members sit, whether above or
below the Gangway.
And yet how much more urgent is
necessity in their case !

THE DANCE.
WHEN good-nights have been prattled, and prayers
have been said,
And the last little sunbeam is tucked up in bed,
Then, skirting the trees on a carpet of snow,
The elves and the fairies come out in a row.
With a preening of wings
They are forming in rings;
Pirouetting and setting they cross and advance
In a ripple of laughter, and pair for a dance.
And it's oh for the boom of the fairy bassoon,
And the oboes and horns as they strike up a tune,
And the twang of the harps and the sigh of the lutes,
And the clash of the cymbals, the purl of the flutes;
And the fiddles sail in
To the musical din,
While the chief all on fire, with a flame for a hand,
Rattles on the gay measure and stirs up his band.
With a pointing of toes and a lifting of wrists
They are off through the whirls and the twirls and the
twists;
Thread the mazes of marvellous figures, and chime
With a bow to a curtsey, and always keep time:
All the gallants and girls
In their diamonds and pearls,
And their gauze and their sparkles, designed for a dance
By the leaders of fairy-land fashion in France.
But the old lady fairies sit out by the trees,
And the old beaux attend them as pert as you please.
They quiz the young dancers and scorn their display,
And deny any grace to the dance of to-day;
“In Oberon's reign,”
So they're heard to complain,
“When we went out at night we could temper our fun
With some manners in dancing, but now there are
none.”
IBut at last, though the music goes gallantly on,
And the dancers are none of them weary or gone,
When the gauze is in rags and the hair is awry,
Comes a light in the East and a sudden cock-cry.
With a scurry of fear
Then they all disappear,
Leaving never a trace of their gay little selves
Or the winter-night dance of the fairies and elves.

AT THE PLAY.
“TURANDOT, PRINCEss of CHINA.”
I FEEL almost certain that 7.0 P.M.
is too late for a matinée and too early
for an evening performance. As I made
my way to the St. James's at this am-
biguous hour—an hour sacred to the
memory of Boxing Night at the Lane—
it seemed that only pantomime could
be my natural reward. And panto-
mime it was, with just a sad little echo
of the old Savoy that left us on the
verge of tears.
In point of colour Turandot is a
gorgeous spectacle, but the costumes of

the Far Orient—and there was no
pretence to confine them strictly to
Chinese patterns, the noblest of all
being something in the style of the
Samurai—do not make for a very pro-
nounced beauty of form. I am not sure
that this kind of spectacular romance,
though the traditions of pantomine are
against me, is not best conducted in
a serious vein throughout. We are
always being asked to keep one half of
our face fixed in astonished admiration
and the other half crinkled with laughter.
I speak not only of the figures of the
pageant, part beautiful, part grotesque,
but of the words, which kept on shifting
from an atmosphere of passion and
intrigue to one of wanton flippancy.
Calaf, for instance, the successful
suitor, never relaxed from the key of
high sentiment, but Turandot was all
over the gamut.
However, one is habituated in panto-
mime to the mixed quality of the enter-
tainment; the real trouble here was
the incredible poverty of the fun. I am
forced to entertain one of two suspicions,
each alike repellent to me. Either,
when Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER witnessed
the performance of Dr. VoILMoELLER's
play, the weakness of its humour escaped
him through lack of familiarity with the
language; or else Mr. JETHRO BITHELL,
its translator, has done injustice to
the German version. In this painful
dilemma, I incline to the former theory.
There are rumours, indeed, that we
have been spared even a worse disaster
through the action of Messrs. SAss and
NoFMAN For BEs in revising their parts.
If this is so, I assume that they gave
time and care to the task, though there
is historical precedent for improvisa-
tion. For Gozzi, of the eighteenth
century, who adapted at Venice the
old Persian theme, and introduced from
local sources the four alleged comedians,
Pantalone, Tartaglia, Brigle'la and
Truffaldino, wrote no text for these
characters, but trusted to the actors'
native gift of gag. -
I suppose it is too much to hope that
the authorities should at this late
hour repent themselves and cut out all
the words. The general verdict seems
to be that the play is a thing (like little
children) to be “seen and not heard.”
But I am afraid there are points in it
—the riddles, for example—which could
not be expressed by dumb show. And
it is not only the humour that could
be spared; for more rotten riddles it
would be hard to imagine, and the third
of them, of which the answer was
“love,” was the most unlikely thing in
the world to come from the lips of so
ruthless a creature as Turandot.
And what does the author mean by
that tag of poetry in which he speaks of
the lady's heart as being “cold as the
snows of yesteryear”? Surely WILLON
would never have enquired as to the
whereabouts of les neiges d'antan if he
hadn't known that they had long ago
melted.
As for the acting, I don't know what
we should have done without Miss
EvelyN D'ALRoy. There was a delight-
ful piquancy in her mincing voice and
manner. Mr. GoDFREY TEARLE was a
brave figure, but his personality was
of no particular period. Miss MAIRE
O'NEILL was attractive in the small
part of Zelima. Of the humorists,
Mr. SAss, as Pantalone, and Mr. FRED
LEwis, as Brighella, came nearest to
being funny. The background was
always effective; but the stage of the
St. James's was not designed for
pageantry and seemed badly over-
crowded in the riddle durbars.
I am sorry not to foresee a very
great future for so sporting a venture,
unless of course it can be reproduced
on a kinemacolor film.
“THE HEADMASTER.”
A four-act comedy, preceded by a
four-act music-drama, makes a heavy
programme for a dress rehearsal
matinée that begins at 3.30, and
many of the actors in the audience had
to slip away before the finish. Critics,
too, with a First Night performance
before them (to which nobody asked
me, so it is not my affair), had to
choose between their consciences and
their stomachs, and I can easily guess
which won.
The title of The Headmaster gave
promise of a school play, but it was
largely misleading. The scholastic ele-
ment was little more than the incidental
environment of an ordinary plot turning
upon two rather commonplace ideas
—(1) a clergyman's passion for prefer-
ment, (2) an innocent remark misin-
terpreted as a proposal of marriage.
Complications ensue from the fact that
the designing widow who thus entraps
the reverend gentleman is the very
person to whom he is to owe his offer of
preferment, and that his chance of a
bishopric is his chief attraction in her
eyes. But unfortunately this lady (very
soundly played by Miss Ivor) is not
cºnstructed on the lines of Miss Lottir.
WENNE, but is large and domineering
and in deadly earnest—all which is apt
to get on our nerves almost as much
as upon those of her harassed victim.
But Mr. CYRIL MAUDE as an absent-
minded Headmaster of the last genera-
tion was a glorious figure, and his
scene with those two clever school-
boys, Masters ERIC RAE and KENDRICK
HUXHAM, who came to him for a con-
firmation class, and not, as he imagined,
for a swishing, has never been bettered
in realistic comedy. All the others,

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Miss MARGERY MAUDE, most sweet and
sympathetic, and her sister Antigone,
very nicely played by little Miss
KATHLEEN Jon Es, to Pallisser Grantley
(Mr. ARTHUR Curtis), a perfect prig
of an usher, and Mr. John HARwooD's
school sergeant, the real manager of
the academy. Mr. JACK HolºBs was a
quite human prefect, in love, of course,
with the Headmaster's daughter; and
Mr. CoMBERMERE (Jack Strahan), the
junior master who won her heart, had
really the air of a 'Varsity Blue (a
rare thing on the stage), even if he
did not make the most convincing of
lovers. And I shall have left nobody
out when I have mentioned the truly
decanal performance of Mr. BIBBY as
the Dean of Carchester.
In the end the play drifted off into
a pleasant series of detached episodes,
with a touch of serious sentiment which
did no harm.
It is a great pity that it did not start
a month ago and catch the school-boy;
but its whole atmosphere, if a little
thin in parts, should appeal just as
closely to all who have ever been young;
and I look hopefully, as a good uncle
must, to seeing it run on into the
Easter holidays.
In Haarlem there Ducelt is a pleasantly
sordid little music-drama for three. A
young Dutch peasant-girl, bored by her
dull dog of a husband, arranges openly
to fly with her lover, but changes her
mind at the last moment on finding a
message pinned to her husband's coat
requesting her, before eloping, to mend
a hole in it. If I had been arranging a
removal of this kind, I should not have
been put off by a thing like that; but
of course it is a question of taste.
The play was practically wordless.
This did not trouble the husband, who
read the paper at meals and had a most
extraordinary gift of taciturnity The
music and the action did nearly all that
was needed, with the help of notices that
popped up from the orchestra, saying,
“Three months' interval,”“Six months'
interval,” “Two days' interval.” As
usual, the music took its own time, and
the action and what words there were
had to wait upon its convenience. But
it was impossible to be discontented so
long as Miss MARGERY MAUDE was on
the stage. She made an exquisite
picture and played with the very nicest
intelligence. O. S.

THE PROFESSIONAL REMOWER.
WHEN first Mrs. Tobinson told
Robinson that she had every reason
to believe that Mrs. Smith, who lived
next door, was as anxious to get to
know Mrs. Robinson as Mrs. Robinson
was determined not to get to know
Mrs. Smith, and warned him against
any effort on the part of Smith to get
to know him in order to assist Mrs.
Smith's object, Robinson pooh-pooh'd
the suggestion, as far as he was able
to follow it. He promised, however,
to keep his eyes open and, doing so, he
could not conceal from himself that
Smith's comings and goings did seem
to coincide to a suspicious extent with
his own. So he obeyed his wife's
instructions and avoided him, a process
which involved many deviations and
sudden changes of programme, much
waste of time and even some lies.
Eventually he confessed to his wife
that there could be no doubt of Smith's
fixed determination to follow him about
and force a meeting. Indeed, he be-
came very incensed about it.
The climax was reached in his barber's
shop. Robinson had sat there for
twenty long minutes in order to secure
the attention of his special artist.
His patience had just been rewarded,
and himself wrapped up for his hair-
cutting, when who should come in but
Smith, and where should he seat him-
self but in the next chair to Robinson?
The position was impossible: Robinson
could not be crudely offensive, and so,
sweating with suppressed emotion, he
spoke a reluctant “Good morning. . .”
Later he vented his wrath in the
presence of his friends and acquaint-
ances at the persistence of a man who
followed him even into his barber's
“I wish I knew,” he said, “of a means
of removing from existence those per-
sons, the constant effort, and strain of
avoiding whom make a misery of one's
whole life ” -
A week later his office-boy announced
that a man, who withheld his name
and otherwise behaved mysteriously,
desired to see Robinson. He would
not indicate the nature of his business;
he would not send a message. He
must see Robinson and see him alone.
“Show him in,” said Robinson, and
there appeared a soberly clad, secretive
man carrying a small black hand-bag.
He had the exact appearance of a
travelling dentist, if there are such
things.
“Your name 2'' asked Robinson.
“Is irrelevant,” came the answer.
“Your business 2 ”
“Requires leading up to.... Murder,
I submit, is a practice justly looked
down on, but it is the motive and not
the achievement that is so disliked. It
is the malicious purpose or the mis-
chievous purposelessness of it that
offends against good taste. A worthy
object may relieve manslaughter of half
its blame; a pre-eminently worthy
object may even popularize it. Take
war, for instance.”
“Don't go and tell me that you are
only a soldier,” said Robinson, with a
trace of disappointment in his voice.
“Your preface had led me to hope that
you were an assassin.”
“I am the latter,” said the man. “I
do not kill promiscuously in the service
of my country. I kill specifically on
the commission of private individuals.”
At first Robinson was inclined to
suspect that this was too happy a
coincidence to be genuine and to see
in the whole affair some ingenious
scheme for attracting attention to a
patent medicine. But, observing the
man closely and remembering that his
(Robinson's) wishes with regard to
Smith were known to others, he changed
his mind. “Someone,” he suggested,
“has mentioned my name to you?”
The man nodded.
“Is the Removal of Persons One is
Constantly Having to Avoid . . . 2”
“My business? Yes. But, if you
will hear me out, I hope to disabuse
your mind of the prejudice you might
have at first blush against my calling.”
“We will not trouble you,” said
Robinson, judicially, “for we are al-
ready in your favour.”
The man gave vent to a sigh of relief.
“Then we may at once proceed to the
real object of my visit,” he said.
Robinson smiled. “I can guess it.
You are anxious to exert yourself in
what I will call the case of Smith and
me 2 ”
“That is what I was proposing to
do, if you will excuse me.”
“I will certainly excuse you.”
“And bear me no malice 2''
“None whatever,” said Robinson,
raising his eyebrows. “Why should I?”
For the first time the man looked
almost surprised. Then he pulled
himself together. “Why should you?
Why, indeed 2" he muttered. “Is life
as valuable as all that 2 Then, I take
it, I have not only your approval but
your defini e permission to proceed?”
“Not only my permission, but my
authority,” said Robinson.
The man opened his bag and dis-
played the instruments of his craft.
“What particular means do you prefer
should be employed 2 " he asked.
“I leave that to Smith,” said Robin-
son. “It is only fair to consider his
convenience as far as possible.”
The man paused. “Pardon,” he said,
“but Smith has left it to you.”
Robinson, frowning a little, asked
the man to explain how Smith came to
mention the matter.
“Most certainly,” said the man, as he
produced a piece of rope from his bag
and tied Robinson politely but firmly
to the chair in which he sat. “I thought
you had understood that Smith was the
someone who mentioned your name to
me. He has tried, he says, to discredit
the suggestion first of his own wife and
then of his own eyes, and to believe that
it was only coincidence that so often
brought you together. That proving
impossible, he has tired himself out in
his efforts to avoid you, and, however
worrying and inconvenient the process
has been, he has, up to now, hesitated
to resort to the extreme measure of
employing me in the affair. But, he
says, the thing goes too far when he
cannot even go into his barber's to
be shaved without finding you there
waiting for him.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
A word of serious warning to those about to read Mr.
OLIVER ONIONs' latest novel, The Debit Account (SECKER).
Be careful not to do as I did and miss an inconspicuous
note opposite the dedication, in which it is stated that
“This novel is complete in itself, but the early history of
its protagonists, and the events leading up to the situation
with which the story opens, are to be found in a previous
book entitled, In, Accordance with the Evidence.” If you
should neglect this, and if (again like myself) you should
be so unfortunate as not to know the earlier book, your
enjoyment will be marrcd by an exasperated perplexity as
to what on earth the characters are driving at. Not until
page 108 do you get any clue to the special position of the
hero, Jeffries, with regard to his girl-wife. Briefly the
explanation is that he himself had—for a good and sufficient
motive, not to be set down hero—killed her previous fiancé,
and escaped punishment for it. This book shows how in
the end he does not escape. It is a clever tale, exceedingly
well told, tracing out logically and truthfully the develop-
ments inherent in the situation with which it starts. Mr.
ONIONs has an amazing gift also of making ordinary things
not perhaps beautiful but new and uncommon. Whether
he speaks of setting up house in a jerry-built cottage at
Hampstead, of a business-dinner at the Berkeley, or chops
and tea at a model club in Chelsea, he makes of each a
thing challenging outside expectation. And you never
know what he will say next—which is a rare and refreshing
stimulant.
all who admire quality in fiction—but I repeat my advice
that you should know first what debt is being paid.
|
This is the age of artistic restraint. Dramatists are
taking to the “quiet curtain.” Comedians in farce, in
moments of embarrassment, stand like statues instead of
zig-zagging about the stage and slapping people on the
back; and novelists with a lurid story to tell become almost
dry in their manner. To this school belongs Mr. ANTHONY
DYLLINGTON. His earlier novel, The Unseen Thing, had as
weird and sensational a theme as one could invent, but
his style and restraint gave it a dignity which raised it
above the merely lurid. His latest work, The Stranger
in the House (WERNER LAURIE), belongs to the same
genre, and once more he has been completely successful
in avoiding crude sensationalism. It was not an easy task.
I wonder what the manufacturers of the old three-decker
would have made out of the same material. They would
certainly have been fascinated by the central idea—of an
evil spirit entering into a woman's body at the moment of
death, as her soul left it. And I seem to see them gloating
over “the Boy,” the idiot heir of Lord and Lady Brayden.
Mr. DYLLINGTON's art carries him triumphantly past all the
pitfalls of his story. He has himself admirably in hand at
all times. He has a great gift of condensation. I commend
to authors who cannot do without plenty of elbow-room
a perusal of chapter seven of this book. It is a fifty-thousand-
word novel in sixteen pages. The only drawback to the
story, to my mind, is that which mars all novels of the
supernatural, namely that what should be the climax
becomes something of an anti-climax owing to the fact of
the reader's having adjusted his mind to contemplation of
the horrible. The great moment in all these stories is
The Debit Account is thus certainly a book for about half-way through, when the reader begins to suspect.
When he knows, the tension slackens. None the less The
Stranger in the House is to be commended highly.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
If two people are to lose each other in the heart of London;
if all the efforts of Scotland Yard and the agony column
are to be of no avail; if, moreover, to increase the poignancy
of the situation, they must needs live within a stone's
throw of each other in Soho, it is essential, I suppose, that
one of them at least should suffer from a lapse of memory
and a change of name. This, at any rate, is what happens
to John Faithful, who mislays his daughter Marcelle in
Chapter I. of SoPHIE Col.F.'s In Search of Each Other
(MILLs AND BooN). But if there is something a little too
mechanical about her plot I must congratulate the authoress
heartily on her choice of characters. The young gentleman
who extracts teeth in You Never Can Tell is a butterfly sort
of creature at best. Here we have a dentist light-hearted
enough when he chooses, but of sufficient serious merit to make
a worthy husband for a sweet and spirituelle young girl.
And who marries John Faithful (for he is a widower) when
he remembers his right name and recovers his daughter?
Who, out of a hundred guesses, but one of those delightful
ladies who do the fashion sketches with figures like the Tower
of Pisa, and write of love and dress and infantile ailments
for the weekly feminine magazines? Never before have I
on without one, read this book. At any rate I can promise
you some most amusing types and three really delightful
urchins of the true Cockney breed.
My bristles are always mildly agitated by a novel in which
I am introduced to a writer whose work is never revealed
to me. Mr. Bravery, in Lot Barrow (SECRER), was a milk-
and-watery young man who wrote essays. Apart from the
sympathy which he entertained for a maid-of-all-work, his
life was lacking in colour; I hoped, therefore, that he was
going to write something that would atone for his amiable
unimportance. And on page 102 Miss WIOLA MEYNELL
raises the cup of expectation to my lips, only to dash it
abruptly to the ground. “Mr. Bravery sat at a little table,
with his manuscript before him. He began to read aloud,
and we shall hear a little of what he read. But, on the
whole, no. Those who wish may discover it for themselves.”
Frankly, I felt no craving for this research work; and since
the author declined to appease my curiosity, I let it go, and
with it the faint interest I had ever felt in the man.
Throughout this novel, which has for its setting a most
delightfully fragrant, gillyflowery farmhouse, Miss MEYNELL
had the heart of one of
these oracles laid bare
to me any more than I
have pierced behind the
veil which shrouds
odontological domes-
ticity. In Search of
Each Other is a plea-
sant if rather superfi-
cial tale, and whatever
one thinks of it the
authoress has at least
resisted the temptation
to call it “Behind the
Throne” or “Crowned
with Gold.”
Upon my word, I
hardly know what to

is excessively careful
of the nerves of her
readers. Perhaps that
is why she spared us
Mr. Bravery's essays.
But I am always glad
to have my nerves
tried, and though I can
do with an occasional
rest I must have some-
thing more than atmo-
sphere, however whole-
some or rarefied. Lot
Barrow is, in short, the
kind of book that many
people profess to like,
but very few find time
to read. It is a pity that
say about The Friendly Enemy (MILLs AND Boon). I have
no doubt about my own feelings in the matter; I was
absorbed. But then I like being preached at, providing the
preacher is a humorous and observant fellow, obsessed by no
tiresome cranks and free from prejudices and limitations.
Mr. T. P. CAMERON WILSON is all that and more also, but I
doubt if he is sufficiently definite in his conclusions to appeal
to everybody. He is an idealist and a cynic, but he allows
neither his idealism nor his cynicism to blind him to the
facts as they are; in the end he leaves the reader alive to
many new and oppressive problems, possessed of the solu-
tion of none of them and uncomfortably obscure about life
and his proper attitude to it in general. There is no actual
story in the book, but a series of well-connected and mutu-
ally relevant instances. All are taken from the meaner
streets of London and most of the characters are urchins.
A fairy godfather descends upon these and takes them out
of their squalor into the fresh clean country, where one
might expect them to thrive. So far from doing that, they
find the country lacking in something as essential to life as
it is indefinite; they insist upon returning to their squalor
forthwith, and when they get there they are still unsatisfied.
Unhappily, the author does not go on to tell us what to do
about it. If you wish your emotions to be stirred on broad
and easy lines, go elsewhere. If you are ready to have your
intelligence exercised while your sympathies are being en-
listed; if you are prepared to be left to form your own
philosophy, or, having had your eyes opened, still to go
this is so, for great care
and not a little distinction of phrase have gone to its making.
The Book of Woodcraft and Indian Lore, by Mr. ERNEST
THoMPson SEton (CoNSTABLE), ought to be in the hands of
every Boy Scout, and I would advise those elders who put
it there to avail themselves of the rare occasions when it
will be free, and dip into it on their own account. A good
many of Mr. SEToN's preliminary pages are devoted to
clearing the Red Indian of accusations of cruelty, laziness,
uncleanliness and treachery with which prejudice has
loaded him. This is a matter which possibly is of more
moment to American readers (for whom the book was
written) than English, though the information gathered is
full of general interest. One of the unwritten laws of Indian
etiquette, for instance, is the charge: “Do not talk to your
mother-in-law at any time, or let her talk to you.” This,
however, is by the way. The real part of the book is its
woodcraft. Here is one of seventeen tests which the young
Brave in Mr. SEToN's suggested organisation must pass
in order to qualify as a Tried Warrior: “Light fifteen
successive fires with fifteen matches all in different places
and with wildwood stuff.” If an ordinary smoker could do
that, there would be no more tragedies of the last wax vesta.

Mr. TAFT, who has been interviewed on the subject by a
representative of The American Bird, stated as his opinion
that the Drood Case clearly called for international arbitra-
tion, but that the constitution of the Hague Tribunal was
not such as to afford a guarantee that the identity of
Datchery would be satisfactorily established. For the
moment, however, he thought that the diversion of the
“Bull Moose” Party into the paths of literary mystery was
a subject for national rejoicing.
Dr. Woodrow WILsoN has declined to commit himself
to any precise statement as to the political significance of
Mr. Roosev ELT's latest move. He observed, however,
that if it led him on to the Man in the Iron Mask or the
Letters of Junius the peace of the United States might be
assured for another decade.
Great excitement prevails in Rochester, the scene of
Dick ENs's famous romance, in view of the rumour that
Mr. Roosevelt will shortly take up his residence in that
city. At a public meeting held last week it was unanimously
decided to invite Mr. PERCY FitzGERALD to execute a
colossal statue of the ex-President to commemorate his visit.
A proposal to import some lions and other big game, in
order to furnish Mr. Roosevelt with relaxation during his
research, was also favourably eonsidered.
Interviewed by a representative of Brainy Bits Sir
Robertson Nicoli, stated that negotiations were pending
with a view to induce Mr. Roosevelt to accept the post
of Contributing Editor of The British Weekly. The scheme
would involve a considerable extension of the paper, as it
was proposed to place an amount of space at Mr. Roose-
vELT's disposal equal to that allotted to CLAUDius CLEAR.
His weekly contribution would, it was hoped, take the form
of a strenuous commentary on current events under the
heading of “A Cowboy's Causerie.” - : * > .

HOW MILITANT SUFFRAGETTES ARE MADE.
THE ROSE BOWL.
AN Excursion INTO ART.
(In the manner of one of the Critics of
the New Post-Impressionist Exhibition.)
WHAT do the Public make of Mr.
Van Slosh's exquisite “Rose-bowl and
Roses,” this masterpiece of truth of
things as they are, and not as we see
them 2 Do they see only a gilt frame,
and three or four irregular rhomboids
splashed with paint?
Let us endeavour to explain what we
see, in words that the coarsest and
crudest of the savage daubsters and
realists of old, the Velasquezes, the
Corots, the Meissonniers, and the
Whistlers, could follow.
First we consult our catalogue—this,
alas, is still necessary, even to us, who
are acolytes of the new mystery of Art.
Then, little by little, very little by little,
for we too were once unbelievers, it
permits us to understand.
And then 2 A mystic and other-world
odour steals upon our senses—blossoms
that are not, and never will be Marvels
of marvels—artistry satanic and angelic
both ! The nosiness of the nose, the
rosiness of the rose, the bowliness of
the bowl; and bowl and roses are not
there on the canvas'
Not there? Yes, they are there.
Caddie (to visitor). “THAT's THE old GREEN To THIs 'ole, SIR. IT GETs FLooDED, so THEY've give IT To THE LYDIES' "
They are coming through the fog of our Nature's meticulous details—but note
perceptions, as a barge comes through
a fog on the Thames—and they are
strangely like barges—four barges—
barges imbedded—abreast in a pasticcio
of tidal mud. Yes, we see them now ;
and surely it is our triumph as much as
the master's 2
What has the artist done? He has
shamed, upon perishable canvas, the
Sham, Insincerity and Vulgarity of
Nature /
Here are roses, oh, such roses' The
roses that poets have dreamed of, and
singers have sung of, and amateur
gardeners through all time have lied
and boasted of in the 9.1 train. Thank
Heaven that roses like these do not
grow on this earth—for the sob of their
scent, the exquisite pain of their parturi-
tion, would be too much for mortals |
Look at them closely, now that you
know—those four (or is it five?—they
do run together so) irregular rhomboids.
Look at the passion of them, the de-
lirium of them, the disdain of them, the
supreme asafoetida which their frag-
rance exhales. “Roses all the way"—
the way that Nature has missed and
that Art, which for ever shrinks from
the crudities of Nature, has found.
Note the petals—of course they are not
there; Mr. Van Slosh has outsoared
them nevertheless.
Note the stem—it
is not there; for the roses of Mr. Van
Slosh have grown in the unsupporting
acther of Paradise—but note it never-
theless. Note the thorns! What joyous
caprice is this of the master, that the
thorns are there, pushed from beneath
the canvas, in an ecstasy of mockery of
this Public who only know roses when
they have pricked their fingers!
Lastly, note the bowl, so consummate
in its utter absence that one of the
dear roses (or rhomboids—what does it
matter 2) has fallen out of it; and the
water, that should be in it, is streaming
instead from your eyes in tears—or in
what other emotions ! Ah what?
Never again will we look on real
roses. Never again will we lay our
face on that harsh texture of coarse
blowsy petals. Never again will we
inhale without nausea that vitiate,
brutal aroma. The very word “per-
gola” is henceforth abhorrent.
But will—oh will—the Public ever
understand 2

WINTER SPORT.
I.—AN INTRODUCTION.
“I HAD better say at once,” I an-
nounced as I turned over the wine list,
“that I have come out here to enjoy
myself, and enjoy myself I shall. Myra,
what shall we drink?”
“You had three weeks honeymoon
in October,” complained Thomas, “and
you're taking another three weeks now.
Don't you ever do any work?”
Myra and I smiled at each other.
Coming from Thomas, who spends his
busy day leaning up against the wire-
less installation at the Admiralty, the
remark amused us.
“We'll have champagne,” said Myra,
“because it's our opening night.
Archie, after you with the head-waiter.”
It was due to Dahlia, really, that the
Rabbits were hibernating at the Hôtel
des Angéliques, Switzerland (central-
heated throughout); for she had been
ordered abroad, after an illness, to pull
herself together a little, and her doctor
had agreed with Archie that she might
as well do it at a place where her
husband could skate. On the point
that Peter should come and skate too,
however, Archie was firm. While
admitting that he loved his infant son,
he reminded Dahlia that she couldn't
possibly get through Calais and Pont-
arlier without declaring Peter, and
that the duty on this class of goods
was remarkably heavy. Peter, there-
fore, was left behind. He had an army
of nurses to look after him, and a
stenographer to take down his more
important remarks.
: bulletin and a record of his table-talk
promised her, Dahlia was prepared to
be content.
As for Myra and me, we might have
hesitated to take another holiday so
soon, had it not been for a letter I
received one morning at breakfast.
“Simpson is going,” I said. “He
has purchased a pair of skis.” -
“That does it,” said Myra decisively.
And, gurgling happily to herself, she
went out and bought a camera.
For Thomas I can find no excuses.
At a moment of crisis he left his
country's Navy in jeopardy and, the
Admiralty yacht being otherwise en-
gaged, booked a first return from
Cook's. And so it was that at four
o'clock one day we arrived together at ||
the Hôtel Cos Angéliques, and some
three hours later were settling down
comfortably to dinner.
“I’ve had a busy time,” said Archie.
“I've hired a small bob, a luge and a
pair of skis for myself, a pair of snow-
shoes and some skates for Dahlia, a-a.
tricycle horse for Simpson, and I don't
know what else. All in French.”
With a daily
“What is the French for a pair of
snow-shoes?” asked Myra.
“I pointed to them in French. The
undersized Robert I got at a bargain.
The man who hired it last week broke
his leg before his fortnight was up,
and so there was a reduction of several
centimes.”
“I’ve been busy too,” I said. “I’ve
been watching Myra unpack, and tell-
ing her where not to put my things.”
“I packed jolly well—except for the
accident.”
“An accident to the boot-oil,” I
explained. “If I get down to my last
three shirts you will notice it.”
We stopped eating for a moment in
order to drink Dahlia's health. It was
Dahlia's health which had sent us
there.
“Who's your friend, Samuel?” said
Archie, as Simpson caught somebody's
eye at another table and nodded.
“A fellow I met in the lift,” said
Simpson casually.
“Samuel, beware of elevator ac-
quaintances,” said Myra in her most
solemn manner. -
“He’s rather a good chap. He was
at Peterhouse with a friend of mine.
He was telling me quite a good story
about a ‘wine' my friend gave there
once, when x -
“Did you tell him about your “gin-
ger-beers' at Giggleswick?” I inter-
rupted.
“My dear old chap, he's rather a
man to be in with. He knows the
President.”
“I thought nobody knew the Presi-
dent of the Swiss Republic,” said Myra.
“Like the Man in the Iron Mask.”
“Not that President, Myra. The
President of the Angéliques Sports
Club.”
“Never heard of it,” we all said.
Simpson polished his glasses and
prepared delightedly to give an ex-
planation. . . . . .
“The Sports Club runs everything
here,” he began. “It gives you prizes
for fancy costumes and skating and so
on.”
“Introduce me to the President at
once,” cooed Myra, patting her hair
and smoothing down her frock.
“Even if you were the Treasurer's
brother,” said Archie, “you wouldn't
get a prize for skating, Simpson.” .
“You’ve never seen him do a rock-
ing seventeen, sideways.”
Simpson looked at us pityingly.
“There's a lot more in it than that,”
he said. “The President will introduce
you to anybody. One might see—er—
somebody one rather liked the look of,
and—er Well, I mean in an hotel
one wants to enter into the hotel life
and—er—meet other people.”
“Who is she? ” said Myra.
“Anybody you want to marry must ||
be submitted to Myra for approval
first,” I said. “We’ve told you so
several times.”
Simpson hastily disclaimed any in-
tention of marrying anybody and helped
himself lavishly to champagne.
It so happened that I was the first
of our party to meet the President,
an honour which, perhaps, I hardly
deserved. While Samuel was seeking
tortuous introductions to him through
friends of Peterhouse friends of his, the
President and I fell into each other's
arms in the most natural way.
It occurred like this. There was a
dance after dinner; and Myra, not
satisfied with my appearance, sent me
upstairs to put some gloves on. (It is
one of the penalties of marriage that
one is always being sent upstairs.)
With my hands properly shod I re-
turned to the ball-room, and stood for
a moment in a corner while I looked
about for her. Suddenly I heard a
voice at my side.
“Do you want a partner?” it said.
I turned, and knew that I was face
to face with the President.
“Well,” I began—-
“You are a new-comer, aren't you ?
I expect you don't know many people.

dance with 3 *

“I wonder,” I said. “That girl over

He almost embraced me.
“I congratulate you on your taste,”
he said. “Excellent 1 Come with me.”
He went over to the girl in the pink
frock, I at his heels. -
“Er, may I introduce,” he said. “Mr.
—er—er—yes, this is Miss–er—yes.
H'r'm.” Evidently he didn't know her
iname.
“Thank you,” I said to him. He
nodded and left us. I turned to the
girl in the pink frock. She was very
pretty.
“May I have this dance?” I asked.
“I’ve got my gloves on,” I added.
She looked at me gravely, trying hard
not to smile.
“You may,” said Myra.

LITERARY NOTES.
WE learn from the literary para-
grapher of The Daily Chronicle that
Mrs. MARY GAUNT, who is shortly
starting for her travels in China, has
been advised by her brother-in-law to
carry a revolver as a measure of self-
defence.
“The thought of that revolver—es-
pecially how she is to manage it!–
makes her a trifle nervous, as she
confessed the other evening at a fare-
well dinner which her publisher, Mr.
WERNER LAURIE, gave in her honour
at the Waldorf Hotel."
It is pleasant to know that precau-
tions of this sort are not neglected by
other literary Amazons and Strong
Men, whose preservation from harm is
so enormously important to their pub-
lishers and readers alike.
Mrs. Dalclitch Glumme, who is shortly
about to start for New Guinea, was
entertained on Friday night by her
publishers, Messrs. Odder and Odder, at
a farewell dinner at the Fitz Hotel.
The length of her sojourn in the Island
of Mystery depends on the attitude of
the anthropophagous tribes of the
interior as well as the advice of her
uncle, Sir Hugo Glumme, the famous
big game hunter. Acting on his sug-
gestion she has been taking lessons in
the use of the blow-pipe, and the only
contretemps which occurred to mar the
enjoyment of the gathering on Friday,
was the inadvertent wounding of the
elder Mr. Odder during a demonstration
of her skill.
Fortunately the dart was
not poisoned, and Mr. Odder was able
to render full justice to the exquisite
wines and liqueurs which graced the
board.
Lady Gladys Strutt-Jenkinson left
on Saturday by the Aurora from South-
ampton. This dauntless sportswoman,
as is well known, is proceeding to the
Solomon Islands to collect local colour
for her new didactic romance on the
marriage laws, and a select company of
friends and admirers were invited to
meet her at a send-off banquet at the
Charlton on the previous evening by her
publisher, Mr. Goodleigh Champ. On
her former excursions, Lady Gladys has
relied solely on the power of her eye to
quell all resistance, whether on the part
of natives or wild animals, but on this
occasion she has yielded to the urgent
request of her publisher, and equipped
herself with a battery of boomerangs.
After the dinner, Lady Gladys gave
an exhibition of her command of this
elusive weapon, in the course of which
she brought down Mr. Goodleigh
Champ, Mr. Tufton Hunter, and the
head-waiter, in three shots. As, how-
ever, the boomerangs employed were
richly padded no untoward conse-
quences resulted from the impact,
Mr. Bax Wimbledon, whose new
novel, Cresta Bobberley, will probably
appear in April, is one of those con-
scientious workers who never write on
any subject with which they are not
personally and intimately acquainted.
If, for example, his theme is Royalty,
he makes a point of visiting a crowned
head. If it be winter sports, as in the
present case, he spends at least a week
at Montana, Adelboden, or some other
fashionable resort. Last week, he was
the principal guest at a brilliant supper
party at the Saveloy, given by his pub-
lisher and friend, Mr. Roland Stodger.
A charming feature of the evening's
entertainment was the descent of the
noble marble staircase, which had been
treated with a monster ice pudding,
by Mr. Bax Wimbledon on a silver tea-
tray. The masterly way in which he
negotiated the corner before the last
flight is of the happiest augury for the
success of his new romance. It is
immensely reassuring to learn, however,
that, acting on the advice of his second
cousin, Professor Pybus, the famous
Alpinist, Mr. Bax Wimbledon never
enters a bobsleigh without donning a
pneumatic suit, which renders the
wearer practically bump-proof.
“Mr. Borden spoke with an eloquence
which sprang from his deep-seated conviction
of the grave pass which we have reached,
basing his proposals upon the significant
memorandum which the Almighty had pre-
pared at his request.”—Montreal Gazette.

27th. The Lords were hit pretty hard
by Parliament Act. Not sure that, for
the moment, they do not even more
acutely feel snub lately administered.
Through greater part of Session, en-
tirely throughout the
Winter sitting, they
have been set on one
side whilst the Com-
mons manipulated the
Home Rule Bill. Un-
dignified position only
bearable in contempla-
tion of certainty that in
due time they would
have their turn, reassert-
ing ancient predomin-
ance of partnership.
This the long-looked-
for day. Home Rule
Bill came up for second
Reading. Full-dress
debate arranged with
pleased consciousness
that the public would
gratefully turn atten-
tion from the Commons,
concentrating it on the
Lords. And this is the
very day the Commons
select for crisis of their
own, involving dislo-
cation of sessional programme, not to
speak of danger to life of Government.
Thus it comes to pass that whilst the
House of Commons, seething with
excitement, is crowded from floor to
topmost bench of Strangers' Gallery,
the House of Lords, Cinderella of the
domestic establishment, sits apart
neglected, forgotten, engaged upon
drudgery of chewing over again the
thrice-boiled colewort of the Home
Rule controversy,
In accordance with his custom of an
afternoon, PRIME MINISTER conducted
on strictly business principles the
dilemma in which House and Govern-
ment suddenly, unexpectedly, find
themselves engulfed. In Delphic
utterance the SPEAKER last Thursday
indicated possibility of withdrawal of
Franchise Bill and introduction of new
measure if the Suffragists' amendments
standing on the Paper should be carried
in Committee. But he had not given
definite ruling, adopting for personal
guidance PREMIER's famous axiom,
“Wait and see.” This an awkward
predicament, not only risking loss of
valuable time but investing debate with
air of unreality. PreMIER adjured
SPEAKER straightway to make more
precise declaration.

Very well; there an end of the

It was our old friend NAPOLEON B. HALDANE.”
If, he said in effect, any one of the dispersing gloom that lay low over the
uffragists' amendments were carried,
assembly. Duke of DEvoNSHIRE, in per-
formance, as he said, of hereditary duty,
moved rejection of 13ill. If you closed
your eyes and momentarily persuaded
yourself that you were twenty years
younger, you might have thought it
was the eighth Duke who was speaking.
This afternoon ST. ALDwyN, a planet in
the Unionist firmament,
takes up the wondrous
tale, devoting long and
weighty discourse to
what he regards as “an
un workable Bill, a
measure framed not to
work but to pass.”
“Forty years ago,”
he said, “I was opposed
to IIome Rule for Ire-
land, and I am equally
opposed to it to-day.”
“There's the man for
my money, such as it
amounts to,” said the
MEMBER For SARK, his
eyes gleaming with
pleasure as he looked on
from the pen gallery
above the Bar lavishly
set apart for accom-
modation of the Com-
mons. “Studying an
in tricate question
through the changing
courses of forty years he
holds the same opinion as he declared
when Is AAc BUTT first preached the
gospel of Home Rule in House of
Commons. That's what I call true
statesmanship. None of your living
from hand to mouth, indignantly
denounced by BosNER LAw fresh from
Ashton and Edinburgh.”
As St. ALDwyN developed his argu-
ment, leading up to this memorable
declaration, the wigged-and-gowned
figure on the Woolsack seemed to be
engaged in playing a game of Patience.
On his spacious knees was spread a
heap of sheets of paper. Taking them
up one by one, he, after glancing over
contents, placed one on bench to left of
him, another to the right. Hadn't quite
finished the game when ST. ALDw YN
resumed his seat. Thereupon, bundling
remainder of the cards off his knees,
he stepped two paces to left of Wool-
sack, and began to address the House.
Something familiar in the figure,
albeit disguised. Something recog-
misable in the voice, though on lower
key, its utterance more deliberate, indi-
cating in subtle fashion consciousness
on part of speaker that he was in church.
Could it be possible? Was it? No-
yes. It was our old House of Com-
mons friend, NApoleoN B. HALDANE.

strange sea-change suffered since
he was accustomed nightly to stand
at Table in the Commons and, to
the bewilderment of retired Colonels,
set squadrons of Territorials in the
field. One thinks regretfully of familiar
spectacle of his march up floor of
the House, with almost imperceptible
twitch of his left leg as of one accus-
tomed to have a sword swinging from
his belt. So complete was illusion
one almost fancied one heard the jingle
of spurs.
Hidden beneath silken folds of Lord
CHANCELLOR's costly gown lurk the
manly limbs of former SECRETARY

CARDwell of the British Army. Wan-
ished, doubtless flattened out, under
full-bottomed wig is the famous lock
of hair that, curling over the massive
brow, instantly recalled the personality
of another equally great and heaven-
born soldier.
Perturbed by discovery I did not
closely follow drift of reply to St.
ALDwyN's damaging criticism. Don't
doubt it was effective. Peace hath

THE GREAT CUP TIE.
(By our special Financial Expert.)
Forty-FIVE thousand sporting en-
thusiasts gathered on the ground of the
Blackton Cockspurs yesterday to view
the great cup tie with Upton United.
All felt it to be a tremendous occasion,
for the Cockspurs had bid no less than
£1,000 to secure that the tie should be
played on their own ground. Great
anxiety was felt by the crowd as to
whether the speculation would pay.
When the news passed round that
already £1,250 had been taken at the
gates loud cheers were raised. The
crowd recognised that a fine sporting
action had met with its proper reward.
At last the referee (£2 2s. and inci-
dental expenses) appeared with the lines-
men (£1 1s. and incidental expenses) in
the centre. Loud cries of “Mind you
treat the Cockspurs fair!” and “Play the
game, referee!" greeted them, and the
officials bowed their acknowledgments.
In a minute the famous black-and-white
shirts (4s. 6d. each) of the Blackton
Cockspurs were seen, and the vision of
the team (net cost, g12,000) sent the
crowd into raptures. First came Jubber
—the ex-Everton-Celtic-Burnley-Villa
centre forward, specially purchased for
these cup-ties at the record price of
£2,000. His face beamed with enthu-
siasm for the good old Cockspurs as
(for the first time) he took his place in
their team. Then came Dubbs, the
ex-Derby-Sunderland-Fulham outside
left, with the consciousness of his £1,500
transfer fee on his face. Mugg, the
goalkeeper, who had been picked up at
an end of the season bargain sale for a
mere £500, crept towards his goal,
sensible of his social inferiority.
“4:6,000 worth of forwards,” whis-
pered the crowd. “They can't be beaten.”
Then Jubber (£2,000) stepped forward
to toss with the rival captain (value
nil). He produced a coin (1d.) from
his pocket, and the referee (£2 2s. and
incidental expenses) watched it as it
spun in the air.
“Jubber's won,” howled the crowd.
“Good old Jubber—seven to four on
the Cockspurs!”
The ball (15s., including bladder—
strange that such mighty issues should
depend on so cheap an article) was
placed, and the mounted police (10s. 6d.
each for afternoon) held themselves in
readiness to ride to the referee's protec-
tion, and the kick-off came.
A moment and Jubber had posses-
sion. 42,000 worth of centre forward
was sailing for the Upton goal when a
half-back (born in Upton—no transfer
expenses, therefore) interposed and
kicked the ball up the field. Wild cries
of “Order him off!” and “Play the

game, referee!” filled the air. A cheap
Upton outside-left gathered the ball
and centred. It was scrimmaged past
the Blackton goalkeeper amidst loud
shouts of “Offside!” A brilliant charge
by the mounted police checked the crowd
when the referee (£2 2s, and expenses)
allowed the goal. Then everyone said,
“That's the worst of these cheap goal-
keepers—if they'd only paid £3,000
for Wiggins that would never have
happened.” An impromptu directors'
meeting was held on the stand, and
the secretary (£500 per annum) was
instantly despatched with a blank
cheque to buy Wiggins.
In the meantime the £6,000 line of
forwards made ground, but, owing to
the unsportsmanlike conduct of the
opposing halves, who charged without
the least regard for monetary value, the
attack was beaten off. Jubber, the
great Jubber, collapsed on the field.
The trainer (£5 per week) rushed out
with a brandy bottle (4s. 6d. net.), but
the fine fellow did not rise. He had
twisted his ankle (value £375). Ambu-
lance men (volunteers) bore him
solemnly from the field.
“Where's our dividend ?” hissed a
shareholder (twenty £5 shares) from
the grand stand. “Kill that referee.”
Things went from bad to worse.
Dubbs (the £1,500 full back) kicked the
ball through his own goal and in vain
the crowd appealed for offside. So the
game came to an end, though the chair-
man of the Blackton Cockspurs made
a desperate effort to save the situation.
by lodging a protest against the state
of the ground (cost £10,000) as being
too dry to suit his team.
The crowd filed out with sorrowful.
faces, though a few thousand sportsmen
stayed behind to conduct a referee-
hunt round the (£4,500) pavilion.
“It’s a sad day for Blackton sport,”
they sighed. “Why, if they'd kept on
in the Cup they might have paid ten
per cent. this year.”
“The fact that the bow of the Ulstermore
is pointing to one quarter of the compass and
the stern to another is evidence of the remark-
able effect of the wind and Mersey currents.”

THIRD-SINGLE COMB.A.T.
MIND you, I'm not done yet; I'll
have the laugh of Herbert Anthony or
perish.
Herbert Anthony has, I'm certain,
grown grey in the service of the Under-
ground. Grey he undoubtedly is, but
far from rusty. He has learnt how to
keep himself from that by processes
which I was to appreciate on the very
day of his arrival at the booking-office
of my particular station.
Every evening as the clock strikes
five the pen falls from my nerveless
fingers and I hurry to this station and
book to St. James' Park.
Herbert Anthony did not let the grass
grow under his feet. On Tuesday, the
night of his first appearance, I went to
the window and, tendering a few pence,
called, “James' Park.”
“Saint James,” replied Herbert A.,
and furnished me.
I smiled; he smiled back ; we mutu-
ally recognised a twin spirit.
The subsequent daily engagements
can be chronicled briefly :
Wednesday.
I. “Saint James.”
II. A. (laconically). “Park.”
Thursday.
I (business-like). “J. Park.”
H. A. (priggishly). “Saint James, his
ark.”
- Friday.
I (coldly), “St. James.”
H. A. (vulgarly). “St. Jas.”
On Saturday I came to a decision as
I walked to the station at one o'clock.
Since it is a point of honour that fresh
ground should be broken each time I
felt some confidence as I greeted him
warmly with “James.”
Frigidly he replied, “‘Herb.’ to in-
timates; ‘Mr. Anthony' to others.”
Before these lines are in print I shall
have checkmated him. Let me outline
it. H. A. will see me coming from afar.
Through his window I shall note him
smirking, and with one word that itself
spells victory I shall smite him down.
“Victoria," I shall say.

“Wilfred thinks games are a fright-
ful waste of time, besides being
childish and expensive. He says that
when we are married he hopes I'll
give up tennis and golf and all that
sort of thing, and go for “good long

“Shall you?" Elsa asked cautiously.
“Oh, of course not l But till we're
married, anyway, it's no good giving
him games things, is it? Think of
something else, there's a dear.”
“It's not so easy,” said Elsa, from
the depths of an enormous arm-chair.

“No card games of any kind.”

Caroline dolefully. “And black socks

“His mother's giving him those.”
“H'm. Is he fond of reading 2"
“Only SHARspeARE, and I gave him
that for Christmas.”
“Music? Perhaps he
“I'm afraid Wilfred doesn't care
for music.”
A long pause.
“I honestly can't think of anything
else,” said Elsa at last. “I never knew
a man with so few pursuits or wants.
It's awfully splendid, of course,” she
added hurriedly. Yet another pause.
“He doesn't shoot or fish, I suppose?”
“Wilfred? Good heavens, no! Surely
you've read his pamphlet on “Wanton
Butchery' 2"
“‘Fraid not. Does he motor, though,
or ride?”
“Can't afford either.”
Another pause, during which Elsa
poked the fire with the tip of her shoe.
“Caroline,” she said, when they had
sat in silence for at least two minutes,
“I want to ask you something, only
I'm afraid of making you angry."
“I shan't be, I promise. Don't mind
asking me anything. What is it 2"
“It's—”
“Go on."
“It's,” began Elsa, speaking rather
jerkily, “why did you get engaged
to Wilfred ? I mean, what was the

“I was in love with him.”
“ Was 2 "
“Am, I mean.”
Elsa began to feel extremely awk-
ward. “Oh, I see,” she said lamely.

down between them, bristling with

SUFFERING.
(On a recent Critical Pronouncement.)
“THE chief essential that our poets lack
Is suffering"—a sweeping critic cries;
I come to squash this infamous attack;
Let me, I beg you, hit this person back;
“Suffering,” bless his eyes—
Why, bards are born to suffer. Not a lyre
Was ever kindled into laboured song
That did not speak of anguish long and die,
So much there is to chill the poet's fire,
So many things go wrong.
The very feet whereby he seeks to climb,
(Ah, heav'n) like lead restrain him to the flat;
As for the weary trafficking called rhyme,
I have not got the eloquence or time
To give my views on that.
And, when all 's done, after the stress and strain,
To cast the fruits of one's perfected art
Forth to a mob who callously disdain
The treasures wrung from one's perspiring brain,
That's the most cutting part.
I have a score
But a bard
I could go on with this.
Of woes that cry for utterance.
Is born to suffer, as I said before;
And, when I hear that what he wants is more,
It comes a trifle hard.
No. To requite the poet for his toils
He should recline among earth's choicest blooms;
His meek head should be laved in precious oils,
His garment woven of the costliest spoils
From oriental looms.
Slaves should attend him, at his slightest beck,
To bear him scented sherbet and rich cream;
Jewels should hang in clusters round his neck,
Nor any noise should enter there to check
The current of his dream.
That is the treatment. Not to carp or scoff,
Not to deny his load, but make it light;
Why, now, a bard is rarely so well off
As to afford a motor—even golf;
I do not call that right.
And, which is worse, for lack of this refined
(Tho' simple) ease for which all poets yearn,
You cannot hope for song of highest kind:—
As for myself, I often feel inclined
To drop the whole concern.

whether you are coming to London with us to-morrow.”
“To London 2 ” I said. “Us’? Who are the ‘us'—I

forward a valid excuse, for there isn't one.”
“Let me explain,” I said.
“No,” she said.
“Yes,” I said, “I will explain. I insist upon it. When
I said that the question of my coming to London had been
settled long since, I meant, of course, that I had determined
to come with you, that wild horses should not keep me

“That's better,” I said. “I was beginning to be half
afraid that my desire to join your little party had—how

“The confusion of your metaphors terrifies me,” she
said. “But are you sure you know why we are going to

“Sure ?” I said. “Of course I am. You, Francesca,
are going to shop. The three girls will take lessons in
shopping from observing you. Frederick and I shall stay
outside. We shall endeavour to keep our tempers, but, of
course, you never can be sure. Men are so unreasonable.”
“You are quite wrong,” she said.
“No, no,” I said, “they are unreasonable. I have often
heard you say so.”
“I was not referring,” she said, “to the unreason of men.

“It is useless,” she said, “to entangle ourselves in

“But why?” I said. “Who wants family groups ?”
“I am having it done,” she said, “chiefly for Mamma.
It will give her great pleasure.”

IN THE BEGINNING.
[“Salmon fishing has now commenced on many Northern rivers.”
Daily Paper.]
PRE the season turns and the crocus burns
Her torch at the flame of Spring,
We dream of lines of muttering pines
On banks that roar and ring; -
And—wild and black—of a foam-flecked wrack
That the sea-run salmon knows,
Who has won his girth and his warrior worth
Where the humpback whale-school blows!
The stream runs deep and the hill-showers sweep,
And the tops in white are tricked;
His scales they shine of the ice-cold brine
And his tail is tide-lice ticked;
And I would wish for a big cock fish
And a combat fast and grim,
And for half-an-hour of his fighting power
And the rod that's bent in him
Now whether we reach his ringing beach
And look on his burnished mail,
When it's give and take till the surface break
In the swirls of a huge spent tail,
Till he bulks and rolls where the shingle shoals,
The gods themselves may know,
13ut by every god of a reel or rod,
At least we have dreamt it so !

Nobody admires the art or the sincerity of Mr. HENRY
ARTHUR JoNEs more than I do. I still remember with
gratitude the evening when a performance of The Masquer-
aders by a touring company made so strong an impression
upon a susceptible schoolboy that he left the theatre deter-
mined to live a nobler life, and one devoted to the composition
of plays as much like that masterpiece as possible. But in
spite of this I cannot but think that a shorter volume than
The Foundations of a National Drama (CHAPMAN AND HALL)
would have served its author's purpose better. Several of
the papers it contains, written at various dates from 1896
onwards, have now only an archaeological appeal. The
English Drama has done considerable hustling in the past
seventeen years, and meditations upon its progress are apt
quickly to become out of date. Clearly Mr. JoNEs antici-
pated that objection, from the not quite easy tone of his
Preface. To me the most interesting things in the book
are the review of “The Drama in the English Provinces.”
(first published in 1901, and here contrasted with a paper
on the same subject in 1912), and three papers on the
censorship, in which the case for its abolition is put forward
with a great deal of vigour. To those who cannot find
time for the whole of this massive volume I would offer
the advice that they should confine themselves to the
portions I have mentioned, and to the Preface, of which

the personal note promises to arouse attention and perhaps
controversy. I hope it will. -
In his scholarly introduction to The Windham Papers
(JENKINs) Lord RoseBERY follows MACAULAY's lead in
describing WINDHAM as the finest English gentleman of his
day and perhaps of all time. That, I think, is overdoing it.
For, to take one little test-case, surely the finest English
gentleman that ever was would have been able to appreciate
The Vicar of Wakefield, which WINDHAM did not. Then
again he looked upon WARREN HASTINGs, when he was
assisting in his impeachment, as the vilest of criminals, and
in the House of Commons objected with some bitterness to
the proposed bestowal of funeral honours on PITT. In each
of these cases he seems to me to have gone rather near hitting
a man when he was down, which may be gentlemanly
but is not commonly supposed to be English. On the
other hand, he was swished, as an Eton boy, for going
out of bounds; he was a very bad man of business—I like
him for that; and overybody loved him. And they loved
him for himself, and not only because he was a brilliant
writer and scholar, and the most fascinating talker cf his
time. He was the friend, and in many respects the equal,
of nearly all the great men of the exciting days in which he
lived, and his letters from and to PITT, Fox, BURKE,
CANNING, NELsoN, Cobb ETT, Dr. JoHNSoN and the rest,
certainly show him in a very agreeable light as a most
attractive personality. Altogether, for their personal as

well as their historical interest, we ought to be grateful to
the anonymous editor for having dug these papers and
letters out of the British Museum and elsewhere. But he
might with advantage have left some of them out—for the
book is too long—and substituted something more solid in
the way of a connecting narrative. For most of us forget
our history with remarkable case. , Did you know, for
instance, that WINDHAM was a member of the Ministry of
All the Talents, or that he was a supporter of bull-baiting 2
Je m'en doute.
In The Terrors and Other Stories (METHUEN) Mr. ARCHI-
BALD MAREHALL has gathered the pick of the short stories
written by him during the past sixteen years. I may say
at once that the collection is a most agreeable one. Those
readers who have enjoyed Earton Manor, The Squire's
Daughter and The Eldest Son, and have liked their MAR-
SHALL on the broad ground of his novels, will like him no
less in the best (and they are many) of these stories. No
Marshallite—if I may be forgiven the expression—who
expects the usual pleasant ingredients will be disappointed.
He will find the old and -
“a powerful streak of red” in his veins, came, it is true, from
a curious stock, but even when every allowance has been
made for him I find it impossible to understand how he
could attract a woman of such natural refinement as Lady
Carfar. Doubtless Miss DELI, has tried to give him some
magnetic quality in compensation for his “streak,” but it is
astonishing that the author should so far tolerate or over-
look the impossibility of his manners as to suffer him to
be adored by so gentle a heroine. The only character to
whom he showed a true deference was his invalid half-
brother Lucas, and in the scenes between these two we are
given some most admirable pieces of writing.
I AM never quite certain whether I best like “M. E.
FRANCIs" in her Dorset or in her Lancashire mood.
Hesitatingly I decide for the latter, perhaps from personal
reasons, perhaps only because I have just finished Our
Alty (LONG), a tale of rural Lancashire, which strikes me
as exhibiting Mrs. BLUNDELL's art at its very good best.
The construction of it is simplicity itself, for its whole
matter is the wooing of a country heroine by two contrasted
- suitors, a Territorial
stately country houseſ &
the clipped yew hedges, =
the rose - gardens, the
terraces, together with
the delightful girls (a
particular speciality of
Mr. MARSHALL's), the
shrewd old lady and tiº
acid one, the precociously
clever and observant
child-woman, the spruce
but manly youth, and
the general atmosphere
of calm and immemorial
comfort. Here and there
an American girl crops
up, and it is plain that
this variety is a favourite|
with Mr. MARSHALL, for
he takes care that she liviº MODEL.

officer-boy and a young
farmer. But the three
of them are so well and
delicately drawn, the
girl especially, that the
course of her love holds
you like a history of high
adventure and romance.
And in the middle—to
the astonishment per-
haps of readers who may
not remember that its
author has already proved
her power of drama
upon the actual stage
—it suddenly quickens
to a scene of breathless
give-and-take that would
make its fortune as a
play. Of the setting I
shall do no discredit to -
her patrician surroundings; indeed he sees to it that
she shall come out on top. The whole dish is served
up with a seasoning of acute observation and quiet humour
which makes it very agreeable to the palate. Except
in one story, a very early one, Mr. MARSHALL does not
set out to make your flesh creep. His crises, though
well contrived, are amiable rather than terrific, and he
knows exactly how to carry his reader along with him to
the end of the tale. I select “A Son of Service" as proving,
if any proof were needed, that he has a special gift for
writing a powerful story of striking human interest without
losing his amenity.
The Knave of Diamonds (Fisher UN wis) may well
appeal to those who either shun or shudder over the
rampantly popular fiction of the day. If Miss Edith DELL
does not possess the higher literary graces, nobody can
read this book without recognizing that she has a very apt
turn for natural dialogue, that she knows how to create a
poignant situation, and that her sense of pathos never
descends into the glutinous depths of maudlin sentimentality.
Where she fails is in her tendency to exaggeration in the
drawing of character (her squire would have been more
convincing if he had been less wildly bestial), and in her
inability to recognise that her hero is, when all is said and
done, a very perfect bounder. Nap Errol, an American with
do not speak in detail,
because you must know already the charm of Mrs.
BLUNDELL's rustic pen-pictures. It may be, however,
that you hardly supposed the country within a few miles of
Liverpool likely to yield any special beauties of description.
In that case all I say is, “Do but read.” As for the speech
of the characters, to taste its full flavour you may require
to have been brought up, like myself, by a nurse whose
native tongue it was, so that such phrases as “to be kept
agate siding after him " have the charm of early association.
But you need no special upbringing to find pleasure in a
story so engaging and so well told.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WINTER SPORT.
II.--THE OPENING RUN.
WITH a great effort Simpson strapped
his foot securely into a ski and turned
doubtfully to Thomas. -
“Thomas,” he said, “how do you
know which foot is which 2"
“It depends whose,” said Thomas.
He was busy tying a large rucksack
of lunch on to himself, and was in no
mood for Samuel's ball-room chatter.
“You’ve got one ski on one foot,” I
said. “Then the other ski goes on the
foot you've got over. I should have
thought you would have seen that.”
“But I may have put the first one
on wrong.”
“You ought to know, after all these
years, that you are certain to have
done so,” I said severely. Having had
my own hired skis fixed on by the con-
cierge I felt rather superior. Simpson,
having bought his in London, was re-
garded darkly by that gentleman, and
left to his own devices. *.
“Are we all ready?" asked Myra, who
had kept us waiting for twenty minutes.
“Archie, what about Dahlia 2"
“Dahlia will join us at lunch. She
is expecting a letter from Peter by the
twelve o'clock post and refuses to start
without it.'. Also she doesn't think she
is up to ski-ing just yet. Also she
wants to have a heart-to-heart talk
with the girl in red, and break it to her|
that Thomas is engaged to several
people in London already.” . º
“Come on,” growled Thomas, and
he led the way up the hill. We
followed him in single file.
It was a day of colour, straight from
Heaven. On either side the dazzling
whiteness of the snow; above, the dee
blue of the sky; in front of me the
glorious apricot of Simpson's winter
suiting. London seemed a hundred
years away. It was impossible to
work up the least interest in the Home
Rule Bill, the Billiard Tournament or
the state of St. Paul's Cathedral.
“I feel extremely picturesque,” said
Archie. “If only we had a wolf or
two after us, the illusion would be
complete. The Boy Trappers, or Half-
Hours among the Rocky Mountains.”
“It is a pleasant thought, Archie,”
I said, “that in any wolf trouble the
bachelors of the party would have to
sacrifice themselves for us. Myra, dear,
the loss of Samuel in such circum-
stances would draw us very close
together. There might be a loss of
Thomas too, perhaps—for if there was
not enough of Simpson to go round, if
there was a hungry wolf left over,
would Thomas hesitate 2 ”
“No,” said Thomas, “I should run
like a hare.”
Simpson said nothing. His face I
could not see; but his back looked
exactly like the back of a man who
was trying to look as if he had
been brought up on skis from a baby
and was now taking a small party of
enthusiastic movices out for their first
lesson.
“What an awful shock it would be,”
I said, “if we found that Samuel really
did know something about it after all;
and, while we were tumbling about
anyhow, he sailed gracefully down the
steepest slopes. I should go straight
back to Cricklewood.”
“My dear chap, I've read a lot
about it.”
“Then we're quite safe.”
“With all his faults,” said Archie,
“and they are many—Samuel is a
gentleman. He would never take an
unfair advantage of us. Hallo, here
we are.” - -
We left the road and made our way
across the snow to a little wooden hut
which Archie had noticed the day before.
Here we were to meet Dahlia for lunch;
and here, accordingly, we left the ruck-
sack and such garments as the heat of
the sun suggested. Then, at the top
of a long snow-slope, steep at first,
more gentle later, we stood and won-
dered. & sº
“Who's going first 2" said Archie.
“What do you do?” asked Myra.
“You don't. It does it for you.”
“But how do you stop?” º
“Don’t bother about that, dear,” I
said. “That will be arranged for you all
right. Take two steps to the brink of
the hill and pick yourself up at the
bottom. Now then, Simpson Be a
man. The lady waits, Samuel. The-
Hallo! Hi! Help!” I cried, as I began
to move off slowly. It was too late to
do anything about it. “Good-bye,” I
called. And then things moved more
quickly . . .

I realised that I wasn't keeping up with

But I was not to be beaten. Once
more I obtained the lead. This time I
took the inside berth, and kept it . . .
There seemed to be a lot more snow
than I wanted . . . I struggled bravely
with it . . . -

And then the earthquake ceased, and
suddenly I was in the outer air. My
first ski-run, the most glorious run of
modern times, was over. :
“Ripping!” I shouted up the hill to
them. “But there's rather a masty
bump at the bottom,” I added kindly,
as I set myself to the impossible busi-
ness of getting up . . .
“Jove,” said Archie, coming to rest a
few yards off, “that's splendid.” He had
fallen in a less striking way than myself,
and he got to his feet without difficulty.
“Why do you pose like that?” he
asked, as he picked up his stick.
“I’m a fixture,” I announced.
“Myra,” I said, as she turned a somer-
sault and arrived beaming at my side,
“I'm here for some time; you'll
have to come out every morning with
crumbs for me. In the afternoon you
can bring a cheering book and read
aloud to your husband. Sometimes I
shall dictate little things to you. They
will not be my best little things; for
this position, with my feet so much
higher than my head, is not the one in
which inspiration comes to me most
readily. The flow of blood to the brain
impairs reflection. But no matter.”
"Are you really stuck?” asked Myra
in some anxiety. “I should hate to
have a husband who lived by himself
in the snow,” she said thoughtfully.
“Let us look on the bright side,”
said Archie. “The snow will have
melted by April, and he will then be
able to return to you. Hallo, here's
Thomas. Thomas will probably have
some clever idea for restoring the family
credit.” . . . . . . .
| Thomas got up in a businesslike
manner and climbed slowly back to us.
“Thomas,” I said, “you see the
position. Indeed,” I added, “it is
obvious. None of the people round me
seems inclined—or, it may be, able—to
help. There is a feeling that if Myra
lives in the hotel alone while I remain
here—possibly till April—people will
talk. You know how ready they are.
There is also the fact that I have only
hired the skis for three weeks. Also-a
minor point, but one that touches me
rather—that I shall want my hair cut
long before March is out. Thomas,
imagine me to be a torpedo-destroyer
on the Maplin Sands, and tell me what
on earth to do.”
“Take your skis off.”
“Oh, brilliant!” said Myra.
“Take my skis off 2 " I cried.
“Never ! Is it not my duty to be the
last to leave my skis 2 Can I aban-
don Hallo, is that Dahlia on the
sky-line? Hooray, lunch! Archie,
take my skis off, there's a good fellow.
We mustn't keep Dahlia waiting.” . .

AT THE PLAY.
“THE SON AND HEIR.”
Miss GLADYs UNGER's play has the
misfortune to challenge comparisons
(rather odious for her) with Mr. GALs-
worthy's recent production, The Eldest
Som, a work of so pure an excellence
that its failure was foredoomed. Mr.
GALsworthy presented to us, in an
atmosphere of amazing reality, a very
delicate problem which might any day
be set for solution. I don't know what
experience Miss GLADYs UNGER (U.S.A.)
may have had of English country houses,
but she starts out with a prejudice
against our system of primogeniture,
and goes on to manufacture a story
to suit her case—a story savouring
strongly of novels and the stage.
Happily for us (for things might
have been worse) the spoilt youth of
the title, an unmannerly boor, incredible
as a product of Oxford, disappeared
early from the scene, and we were left
to witness the brutality of his father
towards those other members of his
family who, through difference of sex or
age, did not happen to be his eldest son.
At 7 P.M. he was in his study thrashing
- his younger son for a slight ineptitude in
the hunting-field. At midnight he was
in his eldest daughter's room, trying his
best to throttle her because she differed
from him as to her duty towards the
beast of a husband whom he had
forced her to marry. Meanwhile, in
the intervals snatched from devoted
attendance on an injured mare, he had
arranged, as a matter of by-play, to
blast the hopes of his younger daughter
and her lover, thus achieving the first
stage of the treatment which had ruined
his other girl's life. Not a bad evening's
work for a typical English squire.
He took it easily, however, as to the
born. The real brunt fell
upon his married daughter (Miss Ethel,
IRVING), who had to entertain no fewer
than four midnight visitors in her
bedroom: (1) her lover, who arranged
to fly with her inmediately after break-
fast; (2) her young sister, whose tale
of woe she had to hear; (3) her father,
who, as I said, tried to throttle her;
(4) a French guest, who heard her
screams, and came from his neigh-
bouring room in a dressing-gown to
the rescue.
The last Act shows some ingenuity.
The Squire has thought things over in
the few remaining watches of the night,
and announces at the breakfast-table that
he consents to his younger daughter's
engagement. This disarms the other,
who cancels her arrangements to elope
and determines to “play the game,” in
the hope that an appeased Providence
may intervene on her behalf later on.
It was all over and settled with the
greatest promptitude, and in face of
grave difficulties presented by the scene.
For the huge breakfast table took up
nearly all the stage, leaving hardly any
room for the drama in which at least
four souls were intimately concerned.
And Miss ETHEL. IRVING's hat, built on
the lines of a hussar's head-gear, and
tilted rakishly over one eye, did not
lend itself to sacrificial tragedy.
Comparisons between The Son and
Heir and The Eldest Son were painfully
emphasised by the fact that Mr. J.DMUND
MAURICE played the Squire in both.
1'ascoe Tandridge (Mr. NoHMAN TREvoR)
to Felix Fourić (Mr. RAYMoND LAUzente).
“Congratulate me, my dear fellow; my elope-
ment is off. We are ‘playing the game'—a
habit peculiar to the race whose institutions
you are here to study.”
After the fine justice which he did (and
no one else could have done it so well)
to the subtleties of Mr. GALsworthy's
portrait, it was sad to see him called
upon to play the part of a mere brow-
beating family tyrant; yet somehow he
contrived to make his distinction of
manner shine through it all. I badly
missed the exquisite grace of Miss
IRENE Rooke as the châtelaine of the
earlier play. I don't know whether Miss
CYNTHIA BROORE was following the
author's instructions when she bowed
to one of her guests at their first meet-
ing after his arrival. But I beg her
very earnestly, if she wants us to believe
that she is really the hostess (however
crushed) of an English country house,
to shake hands with him at once.
Miss ETHEL. IRVING cannot, of course,
help being her charming self, and Mr.
IRAYMOND LAUzerte, as Felic Fourié,
a French guest who had come to take
notes of British social manners, was a
great success. In old days the stage
Frenchman was a butt; here he is
allowed to ridicule our national foibles.
I cannot say that all of his criticisms
were peculiarly illuminating, but they
were made with admirable good-humour.
I hope I have not been unfair to Miss
UNGER. But she can well afford me
my protests, for her play seems to have
had an enthusiastic reception on the
First Night. And the other day I saw
as many as two pictures of her on a
single page of a photographic weekly.
“TRUST THE PEOPLE.”
Things had been going pretty well
so far with John Greenwood. Risen
from the People (Lancashire, of course,
for this is Mr. StANLEY Houghtox's
play), he had entered Parliament, be-
came engaged to the daughter of a Tory
Marquis, and only a week ago been
appointed President of the Board of
Labour with a seat in the Cabinet
(Radical). It was at this point that
Nemesis of the halting foot came in.
To Captain Felton, who had a soldierly
eye for tactics, it seemed as good a
moment as any for citing Greenwood
as a co-respondent. To offer marriage
to his late mistress (who declines it)
is the work of a moment; to release
his betrothed is another simple matter.
But how will the scandal affect our hero's
Parliamentary career? That is a larger
question. Rumour is already busy in the
Clubs (Reform and others) and, as usual
in these cases, the Prime Minister and
the Chief Whip pay a morning call
upon the delinquent. Guardian of the
Nonconformist conscience, the head of
the Cabinet is perfectly cynical about
the immorality of Greenwood's conduct,
but has to consider the Party's welfare.
Was it not a case for hush-money?
What were the Party funds for except
to be used for the good of the Party 2
But Greenwood will not hear of
blackmail. He will throw himself upon
the People. He will resign his seat,
make a clean breast of things, and stand
again for Blackshaw, his birthplace.
After all, what has a man's private life
got to do with his political position ?
The People might be depended upon
to understand all that. “Trust the
People !” had always been his motto.
The close of the First Act, which ran
very smoothly in a pleasant vein of
humour, gave promise of interesting
developments along the lines of comedy
for those of us who had not detected
a sinister note of melodrama in the
attitude of Lord Cheadle, ex-father-in-
law-elect of the President of the Board
of Labour. The stage must be all

to the ridicule of a Radical Cabinet,

Candidate's hotel in Blackshaw.
But the result of the election still
intrigued us. On the one hand, the
title, in which no irony was suspected,
led us to suppose that Greenwood would
be justified of his Trust in the People.

in taking seriously an episode of the
kind which they had always been in
the habit of grinning at.
After all this the play was past
acceptance as a comedy of life, though
large amends were made with the
genre interior of the last Act, which
showed us Greenwood's devoted mother
waging victorious battle (in the vernac-
ular) for her broken prodigal against
the adamantine opposition of his father.
Here Mr. Houghton was in his element.
Up to this point his task had lain a
little outside his experience.

were all very natural. The younger
women were little more than lay

ADWICE TO NATIVE GOMP0SERS.
(Written after hearing Scriabine's
“Prometheus.”)
IRREPRESSIBLE aspirant,
Who would batter down the doors
Which the concert-giving tyrant
Shuts against your deathless scores—
Lo! I bring you counsel cheering
Of a plan for engineering
Paths to gain for you a hearing
And encores.
First, that you may better mimic
Those who fill the trump of fame,
You must change your patronymic
And assume a Russian name.
Then, removed to far Mongolia
Or the purlieus of Podolia,
At a frenzied melancholia
You must aim.
Let your “programme” be exotic
With Theosophy imbued;
Let the “cosmic " and “erotic”
Intermittently intrude;
Mix the violets of Parma
With the cult of Krishnavarma;
And repeatedly to Karma
You'll allude.
Take a scale, say, mixo-Phrygian
With an oriental twang,
Let your ... .". be Stygian
But inspired by Sturm und Drang :
Keep the soft celesta strumming,
And the kettledrums a-drumming,
And the cymbals always “coming ”
With a clang.
STRAUss is growing sadly trivial,
Condescending to the part
Diatonic and convivial
Of his namesake and MozART.
You must never stoop to rollick
In a mood of fun and frolic ;
No, you must be vitriolic
In your art.
By an ecstasy Islamic
Let your fervid Muse be fanned;
Be sonorous and “dynamic";
Unintelligibly grand;
Let the foms and the origo
Be a mystical fuligo
Culminating in vertigo
On the band.
Thus equipped in art and argot—
If you follow my advice—
You will lift the long embargo
On the native in a trice;
And your symphony of bogeys,
Cosmic blatherskite and Yogis
Will be played, in spite of fogeys,
One day twice.

THE TRUTH OUT AT LAST.
IN the House of Commons last week
Mr. MASTERMAN said, “I cannot accept
newspaper reports of these cases. The
facts are often opposite to the state-
ments made.”
It is generally agreed that this must
be taken as an authoritative confirma-
tion of the ugly rumour which for some
time has prevailed in sophisticated
circles. To say that Fleet Street is
stricken with consternation hardly
meets the case. Members of the jour-
nalistic profession had hitherto felt able
to afford to laugh at the rumour, sinister
though it undoubtedly was; but this
definite statement from a member of
the Government and an ex-journalist
is a different matter. By a colossal
effort of self-restraint the gentlemen of
the Press go about their duties almost
as if nothing had happened; close ob-
servers notice, however, that now and
again in Fleet Street one Pressman will
glance suspiciously at another as if to
enquire : “Are you the one who has
brought this blot on our escutcheon 2"
Whether the pronouncement of the
proprietor of a well-known specific for
the cure of croup, chilblains and cancer
will allay the anxiety in the provinces
remains to be seen. With a reassur-
ing vigour he has declared to an
anxious inquirer that anything in print
may be believed. And his view is
upheld by a resident in a Norfolk
village who still affirms that when a
thing's in black-and-white, there it is,
and you can't get over it. But there
is bitter disappointment among regular
readers of certain of the Sunday news-
papers. Our heart is much touched by
the utterance of an old lady in Battersea:
“Why, Annie,” she said gloomily to
her daughter on having Mr. MASTER-
MAN's pronouncement brought to her
notice, “all this 'ere about the resur-
rection curit at Monte Carlo mayn't be
true, after all, then "
Up to the time of writing the expo-
sure has had no effect, we are informed,
on the response to company prospec-
tuses or the popularity of the Secret
Land Enquiry's reports.
“In the midst of the present confusion,
when no one knows what a day may bring
forth, when surprises are continually sprung
upon us, when we ask, with baited breath,
What next? it may be as well to spend a few
moments in looking back and looking for-

MORE CONCESSIONS.
[“Dogs are to be allowed on the upper decks
of the Middlesex County Council tramcars on
payment of ordinary passenger fares. The
conductors are to have the right of veto in
the case of animals whose appearance or be-
haviour is such as to render them undesirable
passengers.”—Evening Standard.]
RETURN tickets at single fares, avail-
able by ordinary trains, are about to be
issued on the Midland Railway to foxes
desirous of attending local meets on
their system during the season.
Monkeys will in future be admitted
to the Zoo as ordinary visitors at half-

to give offence or cause annoyance to
their comrades in captivity.
Cats are requested to note that ad-
mission to the Frank Buckland Col-
lection of Fish at the Science Museum,
South Kensington, is free on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays. Visitors are
particularly requested not to touch the
exhibits.
Through the courtesy of H.M. Office
of Works, sea-gulls have been granted
permission to indulge in mixed bathing
in the ornamental waters of St. James's
Park between the hours of 7 and
9 A.M. University costume is not in-
sisted on.
The London General Omnibus Com-
pany are making arrangements whereby
old 'bus-horses formerly in their service
may travel by any of the Company's
motor omnibuses at greatly reduced
fares. The conductors have, however,
received instructions to eject any horse-
ſound making derogatory allusions to
the new motive power.
O. U. D. S.
ONE of Mr. Punch's learned clerks
wishes to state that he derived con-
siderable entertainment from The Shoe-
maker's Holiday, as represented by
the O.U. D. S. “If here and there in
the earlier scenes,” he writes, “there
was some obscurity, which (helped by
the effect of the curtains, through which
the performers came and went) produced
an atmosphere curiously like that of a
charade, with the audience hopelessly
groping for the word, the later acts of
roystering made ample amends. Here
and there the old comedy sounded
strangely modern, especially in the
portrayal of the two chief apprentices
as arranging a sympathetic strike
whenever anything went untowardly.
A line in which Frisk (that merry rogue,
excellently played) speaks of 'chopping
up the matter of the Savoy' had an
almost wistful appeal for certain critics
from town who had scamped their lunch
in order to attend the matinée. But
they were well repaid for their fasting.

Mistress. “THAT's RIGHT; AND I HoPE You won't BE SEA-SICK.”
Mary. “Oh, BUT I–I-DoN'T wast To Miss ANYTHING.”
Altogether a deserved success seems to the “wives of the Rector's Warden
have rewarded the Oxford Society in and the Parish Warden" to be cleared
breaking away from its traditional policy up; but we are glad that all suspicion
of SHAKSPEARE or Greek. Prosit.”
The Rugby Advertiser, honourably
anxious to locate in the right quarter
a piece of intelligence which ought, it
appears, to have been associated with
“the wives of the Rector's Warden and
the Parish Warden” (not of Rugby),
makes the following statement: “By
an inadvertent omission the paragraph
read, ‘wives of the Rector and the
Parish Warden.” The Rector has never
been married and has, therefore, no
wife.” There is still the question of
of polygamy on the part of the Rector
has been removed. It is now admitted
that the reverend gentleman, as is the
way with people who have never mar-
ried, has no wife at all.
“It is announced that the Porte has sent
instructions to the Turkish Commander at
Adrianople, requesting him to set apart, in
accordance with the requests of the Consuls,
a neutral zone two square millimetres in ex-
tent, within which foreigners may take up
their quarters.”—Birmingham Daily Post.
This should provide ample quarters for
the neutral bacilli of the place.

THE MERRY HIND.
(A Topical Eclogue, with sincere apologies to Mr. John
MAs EFIELD for borrowing the metre of “The Daffodil
Fields” in the current number of “The English
Review,” and for attempting to imitate his use of the
“pathetic fallacy.")
I wanderED on a morning, ere the Spring
Had set a-dance the dancing daffodils,
And heard a Shropshire lad shout loud and sing
Like one whose soul is cheered by patent pills.
I will accost, I thought, this boor that tills
And ask him why his pulses pound and gallop.
A rook cawed, and a milestone said, “Eight miles to
Salop.”
I found him on a gate. “Come hither, yokel,”
Quoth I, “and tell me why thou art not swinked ;
How of the agricultural distress, the local
Famine and misery 2” The young man winked;
A florin passed between us, and he chinked
The coin within his pouch, then grew oracular.
I wish I could do justice to his quaint vernacular.
“Misery 2” he began; “well, times was bad;
It's gentlemen like you that makes them better;
Erstwhile we groaned, rebellious and sad,
Under the squire's and parson's baleful ſetter;
To-day there is no drouth but finds a wetter;
You'll be the fourth this week.” “Explain, good fellow,”
Said I. A bull in the near field began to bellow.
THE SUSPECT.

“Three bob he gave me.
“Last Monday,” he resumed, “there come a chap
Collecting folk-songs and old morris dances;
Asked if I'd heard on some of them, mayhap;
I hadn't, but a bloke must take his chances.
I telled a mort of lies, and off he prances,
Leaving-me half-a-crown.” He paused. A fat
Thrush in a hedgerow trilled. Leaves stirred. The
rustic spat. -
“Wednesday,” he then went on, “a sad-eyed cove
Wanted to hear old tales of far-off sorrows
(That's what he called them), bade me as I drove
My blinking team afield on cloud-hung morrows
Tell him of murders done and loam that borrows
Its richness from red gore. I stuffed him proper.
Easy as cutting chaff, it was, with Farmer's chopper.
And last night there come,
Whiles I was looking on at blacksmith's forge,
A gent with ferret's eyes as whispered, “Mum!
I am a secret agent of LLoyd GEORGE:
I hunts for evidence of squires that gorge
On ill-got gains while you poor hinds have nix.’
A pleasant-spoken party; he gave three-and-six.”
He ended, and began to hum a stave
Of how all men were doing it. Demure
His glance, as at the first, and so I gave
Two further bobs and said, “You are a cure.”
Uprose a distant scent of bone manure.
A skylark soared from grasses soft as flannel,
And the great Severn rolled towards the Bristol
Channel. Evoe.

ES S E N C E OF PA R L J A M E N T.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Feb-
ruary 3.-Seemed reasonable to sup-
pose that, Insurance Act being now in
full working order, MASTERMAN might
look for relief from incessant shower
of questions that through preceding
months, with singularly refreshing in-
fluence, fell upon his head. On the con-
trary to-day no fewer than forty-nine
separate Questions were addressed to
him upon the paper. Taking the unit
as minimum of Supplementary Ques-
tions we have one hundred less two.
Ordeal might be expected to sour the
temper of an ordinary Financial Secre-
tary to the Treasury, the more so since
not one in a score is designed to elicit
useful information. The rest are pin-
pricks more or less skilfully fashioned
with object of embarrassing operation
of the Act.
MASTERMAN a tough customer to
approach with such intent. Whether
he reads from manuscript answer pre-
pared in office or whether he makes
quick reply to supplementary enquiry
he is invariably top dog in the tussle.
What he doesn't know about the in-
tricacies of this elaborate Act isn't
worth LLoyd GEORGE's picking up.
TIIE VERY LATEST IN PANEL DocTORs.
(TULLIBARDINE, M.D.)
Imperturbable, impregnable, master of
every turn in the tortuous ways, brief
but sufficient in reply, he is not one
out of whom much change is to be got.
This normal state of things makes
more striking TULLIBARDINE's success.
Eagle eye of noble Marquis ranging over
Hebridean seas has discovered a lone
island whose inhabitants are bravely
wrestling with mysteries of Insurance
Act. Something charming in simplicity
of question which brought the matter to
light of Southron day. “To ask the
SECRETARY of THE TREASURY if he could
state the total population of the island
of Canna, and who is the panel doctor.”
MASTERMAN Ready as usual with
information on matter of fact. Popu-
lation of Canna all told is twenty-nine.
As for arrangements for panel doctor
case obviously difficult. Even upon more
liberal terms of remuneration wrung
by doctors out of reluctant CHANCELLOR
of ExchEQUER an able-bodied practi-
tioner could hardly be expected to live
on the aggregated fees of a population
of twenty-nine.
True. But there remains fact of this
appalling shortcoming of a statute
framed for application to the odd mil-
lions on the adjacent islands of Great
Britain and Ireland.
TULLIBARDINE not the man to rest
content with barren victory albeit
achieved over redoubtable adversary.
“If the Treasury Canna do it,” he
whispered in the sympathetic ear of
WINTERTON, “I will.”
Obvious joke; its poverty more than
redeemed by generous purpose it covers.
SARK tells me TULLIBARDINE has re-
solved to take upon himself duty evaded
by callous Minister. A small thing for
him to qualify as doctor authorised to
charge 8s. 6d. a case, including medicine.
Regardless of the weather he is already
off to Canna, carrying with him stock
of medicines and surgical instruments,
together with a red lamp to hang over
the front door of his bothie.
Interesting case ; will be closely
watched by old associates on both sides
of Tweed who would never think of
personally volunteering for such a duty.
Business done.—Report stage of
Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill

of ultimate possession of glebe

these are to go for secular pur-

Captain TRYox calls “the plun-
der.” Amendment moved re-
taining them for the Church.
A big question stirring the depths
on either side of controversy. Good for
at least a couple of hours' debate. In
view of that alluring prospect House
further emptied. Doleful doings under
eye of SPEAKER. Outside, more par-
ticularly in little room in corner of

where Opposition Whips foregather,
excitement suddenly burst forth.
Heads carefully counted. Good
Ministerialists, reckoning on prolonga-
tion of debate, tarried on the way to
Westminster. By one of those chances
that occasionally cheer the chronically
disappointed, there was marked excep-
tion as regards muster of Opposition

reached.

Two hours later, when guillotine set

skilfully played their game, nearly won

he went on, “the horrid fact that a

wrench. No doubt every one has such

sovereigns, although I am never reckless
with them, I can transfer from my own

ever, I stop again. The idea of paying

14s. 6d. is intensely repugnant to me.

else is drawn from me only by torture,

The plaintive man paused. “Such,”
he said, “is my currency creed.”
“I am not conscious,” said the thin
man, “of any of those distinctions and

above all things, should be free. The
idea of having to pay for an apple in-

where they are often sixpence each.”
“The measure of all men's gener-
osity,” said the quiet man, who had
not yet spoken, “is their capacity to
pay for fruit.”
“Well, personally,” said the stout
man, “I always think the height of
illicit payment is reached in the charge
made to enter TATTERSALL's ring. For

[FEBRUARY 12, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A QUESTION OF PRONUNCIATION.
It was the girl who sometimes helped in the neighbour-
ing flat and she was addressing the porter on the landing:—
“We 'ad a real ole go at 'ome last night. It makes me
all of a trimble to think of it. But there, you never know
what's a-goin' to 'appen when Uncle Bill gits along o' father.
Fust they starts talkin' and jorin' about their politics, and
then they gits argifyin' and naggin' at one another,
and then they gits to throwin' things about and pastin' one
another, and then the fat's in the food, as the sayin' is.
Mind you, they don't go for to mean it like that. They
both thinks they're the kind o' men that's got a very good
temper and can make allowances, but as far as I've seen
'em when they begins soft and kind they ends cruel
hard; and it isn't so much what they say, it's the good food
they chuck abaht and the plates and dishes they break.
Uncle Bill's got one o' the 'andsomest marks you ever see
on a man's forrid all along of a cabbige-dish. Father
ketched 'im a crack with it a year ago come last November,
when they was explainin' the Insurance Act to mother.
The doctor put the stitches in and advised 'em to quit
talkin' about setch big things after supper. It vexed
Uncle Bill and 'e didn't come visitin' us for a matter o' six
weeks.
“Well, last might Uncle Bill comes in sudden like, and
mother says to 'im, ‘Lor, Bill,' she says, “you give me quite
a turn,' and 'e says, “That's a nice thing to say to yer only
brother,' 'e says; “but, bless you, I'm not one to keep my
grudge a-boilin', 'e says, “and anyhow it was all in the
family, wasn't it, Jim 2' 'e says, with a look at father; and
father says, “Things do git 'ealed over, don't they, Bill?'
and then they both started larfin', and mother said there was
sossidges and mash for supper and I was to run round
quick and fetch another quart o' beer.
“When I got back with the beer I found 'em setting to
work on the sossidges and all three as friendly as you like.
Uncle Bill's a very proud man and 'e's got a nice little bit
o' property—'ouses, you know, and that kind o' thing, and
'im bein’ a batcheldore, mother's always tellin' father to
humer 'im more and let 'im talk, becoz she says 'is 'eart's
in the right place and if 'e was to be took fust it might
make a big difference to us. Uncle Bill was sayin' 'e'd seen
a tidy little bit o' land for buildin' a shop or two, and father
says, “Why don't you nip in and buy it 2' 'e says. “It'll
always be there,' 'e says. “Land and shops can't run away.'
Uncle Bill looks at 'im and says very quiet as 'e'd buy it in
a minute if it wasn't for LLoyd GEORGE. “What's LLoyd
GEORGE done to you now 2' says father. Uncle Bill says
LLoyd GEoRGE 'as got 'is knife into the land and all men
o' landed property 'ave got to combine agin this 'ere new
land kimpane or else LLoyd GEORGE 'll git 'em in the cart
and tax 'em to rags: ‘’E's a reggler pest,’ says Uncle Bill,
‘that's what 'e is.’ Father says, ‘’E's a better man any
day o' the week than this 'ere BoSAR LAw that you're all
so pleased with. 'Ow about food taxes?' 'e says. “What
are you to think of a man like that, blowin' 'ot and strong
all in one go?' Uncle Bill swallers the sossidge and potato
'e'd got in 'is mouth and then lets LLoyd GEorge have it
to rights. ‘’E's underminin' confidence,' 'e says,' and arter
all 'e's no more than a little Welsh attorney.' That's 'ow
'e pernounced it, same as you'd say horny or thorny.
Father laughs a sort of cold laugh and then 'e says very
scornful, “Attorney, attorney ! Where did you git your
eddication, Bill Sampson 2' 'e says. “When I was in the
Board School they taught us better nor that. Atturney's
the word you're lookin' for, Bill. But o' course I'm always
glad to 'elp them as ain't so well eddicated as others.” Uncle
Bill got redder'n a turkey, and 'e says, “You can say what
you like, but that's what 'e is, a little Welsh attorney.” O’
course father couldn't stand that, so 'e takes the last sossidge
and chucks it in Uncle Bill's face, and then they'ad a bit of
a set-to, and Uncle Bill said 'e'd shake our mawsty dust orf
of 'is feet. Talk o' strained relations o' Turkey, it ain't a
patch on what's 'appened in our family.”
AFTER LONG YEARS.
I PUT aside my knife and fork and ponder—
Ponder some memories of bygone days,
When I, a careless lad, was wont to wander
About a Cornish undercliff and blaze
At bunnies blinking by the summer sea:
I blazed at them who couldn't blaze at me.
And though I called it sport, this wanton slaughter

My mother said, since home they never brought her
Warrior dead of shots from his own gun,
“It isn't sport, I take it, to attack
A harmless thing that cannot hit you back.”

I never ate 'em—oh, I wish I had
Myself, acquiring sedentary habits
And cancelling the licence of a lad,
Became a journalist, and now abide
In modest chambers on the Surrey side.
I never knew what happened to those bunnies,
But, sitting vanquished here before my plate,

Says the Shrewsbury Commercial and Literary Circular in

“This week’s ‘Punch' has reproduced a printer's error which crept
into our paper a fortnight ago, by which an advertisement was made
to read ‘ALE cordially invited.” As showing how easily such errors
are made “Punch' itself, the great and only, makes a blunder in
stating that the error occured in the ‘Shrewsbury Commercial and

“The Devil” is tempted to have another go; he therefore
points out that “occured" is better spelt with two “r's.”
Now it is The Shrewsbury Commercial and Literary Circular's
turn again.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
My only complaint about “FRANK DANBY's" latest story,
Concert Pitch (HUTCHINson), is that she takes rather too
long over keying it up. This done, however, the tone and
the tune are alike excellent. All the part about Manvella's
early engagements, first to the depraved Duke and then to
the eligible Earl, I found unconvincing to the point of
boredom. It was not till Manvella herself grew so bored
with it that in a fit of pique she eloped with Migotti, the
musician, and went to live with him and his queer friend
Gerald in their ramshackle house in Bedford Square, that
the tale began to show signs of life. Thence onwards it
was vivacious enough. “FRANK DANBY " has certainly the
art of making you know the persons she knows herself; in
this book she seems to have caught to perfection the
Musical Set, half Bohemian, half society hangers-on, with
their jealousies and triumphs and intrigues. Also the
emotions of a delicately nurtured girl suddenly plunged
into a world where she is considered as nothing but
the highly privileged servant of a husband for whom she
has never really cared (compelled even to do her own
cooking and to subordinate herself to his every mood), seem
very subtly and successfully conveyed. I am somewhat
less certain about the villain, Peter Graham (fancy a villain
called Peter / O tempora ! O mores 1), chiefly because I am
always incredulous about these professional breakers-of-
hearts, with their “once on the Riviera and the girl is
ours!” It is perhaps my loss never to have encountered a
specimen in actual life. But in a story they are well
enough, especially since (as here) they are invariably foiled
before the last chapter.
Miss “MARJoRIE Bowen" is doing much to remove the
prejudice which has grown in my mind against the modern
crop of historical fiction. She is never boring, and it was
with cheery confidence that I opened A Knight of Spain
(METHUEN). Exactly how many books Miss “Bow EN” has
published in the last twelve months I dare not say. Yet
her work is as fresh and vigorous as ever, and I am inclined
to think A Knight of Spain her best performance. (This
is written without prejudice to the volume or volumes from
her pen which may be published while this review is going
to press.) A Knight of Spain is the completed picture for
which “The Camp outside Namur,” in her God's Playthings,
was the rough sketch. That story dealt only with the
death of the ill-fated Don Juan of Austria. This novel
takes the reader through each detail of his extraordinary
career. We see him as the student of Alcala, the victor of
Lepanto, the Governor of the Netherlands, and, finally, the
broken victim of KING PHILIP's hatred, dying at the age of
twenty-eight in the pigeon-house among the corn-fields on
the hill of Bouges. My principal emotion on finishing the
book, apart from a feeling of gratitude to Miss “Bow EN” for
an excellent story, was a horror, which the history-books of
my youth had never conveyed to me, of that sinister man,
KING PHILIP of Spain. Not even Mr. Louis N. PARKER
could feel a greater esteem for DRAKE than I did on closing
A Knight of Spain.
Everyone knows by this time that Mr. BERNARD CAPEs,
whose last book is a collection of stories entitled Bag and
Baggage (CoNSTABLE), can write with distinction and a
delicate choice of epithets, that he can hit upon unusual and
interesting situations, and that he is a good hand at giving
us “creeps.” The worst of it is that he so seldom manages

that her actions are impossible. My favourite out of the

WINTER SPORT.
III.-A TYPICAL MORNING.
“You take lunch out to-day—no 2''
said Josef, the head-waiter, in his in-
variable formula.
Myra and I were alone at breakfast,
the first down. I was just putting some
honey on to my seventh roll, and was
not really in the mood for light con-
versation with Josef about lunch. By
the way, I must say I prefer the good
old English breakfast. With eggs and
bacon and porridge you do know when
you want to stop; with rolls and honey
you hardly notice what you are doing,
and there seems no reason why you
should not go on for ever. Indeed,
once . . . but you would never believe
me. - -
“We take lunch out to-day, yes, Josef.
Lunch for—let me see * x
“Six 2 ” suggested Myra.
“What are we all going to do?
Archie said something about skating.
I’m off that.”
“But whatever we do we must lunch,
and it's much nicer outdoors. Six,
Josef.” . . . s -
Josef nodded and retired. I took my
eighth roll. -
“Do let's get off quickly to-day,” I
said. “There's always so much chat
in the morning before we start.”
“I’ve just got one swift letter to
write,” said Myra, as she got up, “and
then I shall be pawing the ground.”
Half-an-hour later I was in the
lounge, booted, capped, gloved and
putteed—the complete St. Bernard.
The lounge seemed to be entirely full
of hot air and entirely empty of any-
body I knew. I asked for letters; and,
getting none, went out and looked at
the thermometer. To my surprise I
discovered that there were thirty-seven
degrees of frost. A little alarmed I
tapped the thing impatiently. “Come,
come,” I said, “this is not the time for
persiflage.” However, it insisted on
remaining at five degrees below zero.
What I should have done about it I
cannot say, but at that moment I
remembered that it was a Centigrade
thermometer with the freezing point in
the wrong place. Slightly disappointed
that there were only five degrees of frost
(Centigrade) I returned to the lounge.
“Here you are at last,” said Archie
impatiently. “What are we all going
to do?”
“Where's Dahlia 2" asked Myra.
“Let’s wait till she comes and then we
can all talk at once.”
“Here she is. Dahlia, for Heaven's
sake come and tell us the arrangements
for the day. Start with the idea fixed
in your mind that Myra and I have
ordered lunch for six.”
Dahlia shepherded us to a quiet
corner of the lounge and we all sat
down.
“By the way,” said Simpson, “are
there any letters for me?”
“No; it's your turn to write,
Archie.
“But, my dear chap, there must be
one, because
“But you never acknowledged the
bed-socks,” I pointed out. “She can't
write till you I mean, it was
rather forward of her to send them at
all; and if you haven't even > *
“Well,” said Dahlia, “what does
anybody want to do?” -
Thomas was the first to answer the
question. A girl in red came in from
the breakfast-room and sat down near
us. She looked up in our direction and
met Thomas's eye.
“Good morning,” said Thomas with
a smile, and he left us and moved across
to her. º
“That's the girl he danced with all
last night,” whispered Myra. “I can't
think what's come over him. Is this
our reserved Thomas — Thomas the
taciturn, whom we know and love so
well? I don't like the way she does
her hair.”
“She's a Miss Aylwyn,” said Simp-
son in a loud voice. “I had one dance
with her myself.”
“The world,” said Archie, “is full of
people with whom Samuel has had one
dance.” *... "
“Well, that washes Thomas out,
anyway. He'll spend the day teaching
her something. What are the rest of
us going to do?” -
There was a moment's silence.
“Oh, Archie,” said Dahlia, “ did you
get those nails put in my boots?”
I looked at Myra . . . and sighed.
“Sorry, dear,” he said. “I’ll take
them down now. The man will do
them in twenty minutes.” He walked
over to the lift at the same moment
that Thomas returned to us. -
“I say,” began Thomas a little awk-
wardly, “if you're arranging what
to do, don't bother about me. I rather
thought of er—taking it quietly this
morning. I think I overdid it a bit
yesterday.”
“We warned you at the time about
the fourth hard-boiled egg,” I said.
“I meant the ski-ing. We thought
of-I thought of having lunch in the
hotel, but of course you can have my
rucksack to carry yours in. Er—I'll
go and put it in for you.”
He disappeared rather sheepishly in
the direction of the dining-room.
“Now, Samuel,” said Myra gently.
“Now what, Myra 2"
“It's your turn. If you have a
headache, tell us her name.”
said
“My dear Myra, I want to ski to-
day. Where shall we go? Let's go
to the old slopes and practise the
Christiania Turn.”
“What you want to practise is the
ordinary Hampstead Straight,” I said.
“A medium performance of yours
yesterday, Samuel.”
“But, my dear old chap,” he said
eagerly, “I told you it was the fault of
my skis. They would stick to the
snow. Oh, I say,” he added, “that |

He dashed off. I looked at Myra . . .
and sighed.
“The nail-man won't be long,” said |
Archie to Dahlia, on his return. “I’m |
to call for them in a quarter of an hour.”
“Can't you wear some other boots,
Dahlia, or your bedroom slippers or ||
something? It's half-past eleven. We
really must get off soon.”
“But we haven't settled where we’re
going yet.” -
“Then for 'eving's sake let's do it.
Myra and I thought we might go up |
above the wood at the back and explore.
We can always ski down. It might be ||
rather exciting.” -
“Remember,” said Dahlia, “I’m not
so expert as you are.” -
“Of course,” said Myra, “we’re the
Oberland mixed champions.”
“You know,” said Archie, “I was
talking to the man who's doing
Dahlia's boots and he said the snow
would be bad for ski-ing to-day.”

“Talking about that,” said Archie,
“why shouldn't we skate this morning,

coming up with a heavy rucksack.

I looked at Myra . . . and sighed.
“What about him 2 " I said.
Half-an-hour later two exhausted
people—one of them with lunch for six
on his back—began the ascent to the
wood, trailing their skis behind them.

Harassed Hostess. “Do YoU DANCE, or ARE You A walNUT 2 ''
I HAVE written a rare little drawing-room piece;
It will never be acted; the public must lose it;
The lords of our stage are incredible geese;
One and all they refuse it.
I shall not expound you the whole of the plot,
But I'll just give a hint of the heroine's character;
No Grundys would ever call her a bad lot,
No gods could have “barracked ” her.
A beautiful girl with an infinite tact,
She delights in undoing her relatives' tangles;
Her cousin Lord D'Arcy's in love (the First Act)
With a creature in spangles.
She saves him.
She saves her mamma from her
“friends”; -
If she deals with one problem she deals with a dozen;
And she gets her reward, as the curtain descends,
In the shape of her cousin.
Not wholly original that, you'll observe—
The girl who plays Providence; ah, but what ſary
Had ever the gumption, the grace and the nerve
Of my Managing Mary?
Other masterful maidens have captured your heart
With the help of their toilets, too nice or too rowdy;
But the thing that sets Mary so wholly apart
Is the fact that she's dowdy.
Her garl is the garb of a season agone,
And her intimates say, when she brightens their
troubles,
“Dear girl! What a terrible gown she had on 1"
And their gratitude doubles.
What is more, when the grip of a present-day mime
Is apt, ere the ending, to fade or diminish,
My heroine wears the same frock all the time,
From the start to the finish.
You have it: I give you the skeleton shape;
You can picture the rest—all the gallery staring,
The critics dumbfounded, the boxes agape
And aghast at my daring.
Yet I write to our Frohmans and Barkers in vain:
Evermore they present Sophonisba's Vagary,
Or Whimsical Susan; will no one explain
Why they send back my Mary? EvoB.

We heartily commend the reading of DEFoE as an aid to the

people who read the latter in their youth have clean
forgotten the illustration of Robinson Crusoe's parrot.

AN INTERVIEW WITH OUR FIRST-PRIZE
“BOBLET" WINNER.
(From “The Weekly Wonder.”)
I HAD to do the last part of the
journey on all fours, for the mountain
was not only snowy but steep. A
Weekly Wonder man, however, out to
interview the First-Prize Winner in
our world-famed “Boblets " Competi-
tion, is not easily beaten.
I had just enough strength left to
rap at the door of a neat cottage, and
then my trials were over.
I found, myself in a warm, bright,
comfortable parlour, my climbing irons
taken off, the hundredweight or so of
snow removed from my back, and in
the presence of a hale, hearty, hand-
some, apparently middle-aged couple—
Mr. John MacRumbleton, Mountain
crutches are those I see? Not yours,
I hope?”
They both laughed happily. “Ees,
Sir, they wur mine. I wur dead lame,
I wur, afore I began to take in The
Weekly Wonder—and now I can walk
as well as any ' "
“You delight me. Whose ear-trumpet
is that yonder? Neither of you is
deaf.” - -
Again they laughed joyously. “'Twur
the old ooman's, Sir. She wur deafer
nor a postess—afore we began to take
in The Weekly Wonder—and now there's
nowt she can't hear.” -
“Enchanted And now, once more
to ask you for the history of your ex-
traordinary Winning “Boblet' in our
universally talked-of Competition.”
“Wull, Sir, I been trying to make
'em this long time. I always takes out
Shepherd and Winner of a First Prize
in our world - renowned “Boblets"
Competition, and his comely happy-
looking wife.
“And now, Mr. MacRumbleton,” said
I, when I had announced my mission,
“how came you to think of this won-
derful Winning “Boblet' of yours?”
“Wull, Sir, I dunno,” answered this
splendid specimen of a Mountain Shep-
herd and “Boblet ''Winner. “You see,
I been a shepherd these seventy year.”
I gave a loud shriek and had to take
a nip of brandy from my flask.
“A shepherd seventy years, Mr. Mac-
Rumbleton 2 " I shouted. “You look
about forty-five!”
“Ees, Sir, we bears our years well,
but we be eighty and ninety—and we
looked it—we looked more—we looked
ninety and a hunderd—afore we began
to take in The Weekly Wonder 1"
“I’m charmed to hear it. But about

“Ah, that will be a treat for you!

‘Captain Morgan's March,’ the warlike refrain

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PORKER v. M.R. MARDON.
Won DE RFU L things, miraculous
things, are seen to - day at billiard
matches. STEvenson, with bonzoline
balls, makes 1016 at a break, of which
these eyes saw the last 350; REECE
with the ivories makes over 700 and
yet is beaten by the youthful NEWMAN ;
GEORGE GRAY goes in off the red, hour
after hour; INMAN imperturbably scores
off impossible double baulks; and yet no
book is written about it. Guides to the
game—heart-breaking counsels of per-
fection—come out in some profusion, but
no history of a match of 500 up is ever
written now, as was done some sixty-
six years ago, in the handsome quarto
that lies before me, price ten shillings,
with the position of the balls for the last
nine breaks, and also thirty-two other
diagrams, the red being uniformly
coloured by hand. Books like this are
published no longer, more's the pity."
The contestants were Mr. PorkBR
and Mr. MARDON, and the game began in
Mr. KENTFIELD's Subscription Rooms,
| at Brighton, at half-past twelve in the
afternoon of. January 18th, 1844. A
few survivors among the audience might
still be; but it is hardly likely.
“Not a bet,” says the report, “was
offered whilst the player was in the act
of striking; ” which seems to be a wise
precaution and certainly should not be
| resented by the players themselves.
“For such an arrangement much praise
is due to Mr. KENTFIELD.” The tables,
of course, had list cushions.
Which of the players broke is not
stated, but after the first few strokes
Mr. MARDON was 40 to 6. Mr. Pork ER
then passed him—53 to 51—but Mr.
MARDoN having all the luck 3 to 1 was
laid on him. When the game was 300
the light became obscure and it was
proposed to have the lamps. Mr.
MARDON did not, however, pause,
leaving Mr. Porker “the appearance
of a great break.” How well we know
those appearances and how deceitful
they can be Mr. Porker's ball being
close to the lower cushion, there was
some risk, and he prudently awaited
the lighting of the lamps. No sooner
were they burning brightly than he
accomplished the stroke, which was
“pronounced by Mr. KENTFIELD to be
as fine a stroke under such circum-
stances as ever was played.” Mr.
PoRKER from this point never looked
back until his score was 495, or 5 from
victory, to Mr. MARDON's 475. Four
to one was then offered on Mr. Porker.
But Mr. MARDON's special line of
country seems to have been unruffled
precision, and he gradually, in nine
strokes, reached the finish amid a scene
of terrific excitement.
Such was the satisfaction of one of
the players—I need hardly say it was
not Mr. Porker—that he wrote a book
about the match, and also to illustrate
his contention that “fine and first-rate
hazard striking,” such as no doubt dis-
tinguished the play of Mr. PoRKER,
cannot in the long run bear up against
“caution, coolness, and good strength,”
or Mr. MARDON's particular game; and
this is the handsome volume that lies
before me. -
Much of it, I may add, is as sound
to-day as it was then; but there is
a curious onslaught on indiarubber
cushions, which would amuse anti-
quaries. A table fitted with these new
absurdities was placed in a club as an
experiment; but so many baulks re-
sulted “that the frequenters of the
room had the good sense to discard
such cushions immediately,” being
fortified in their decision by a well-
known maker, who said oracularly that
both truth and speed could never be
obtained on the same table. Has it
been thus with every new invention ?
I suppose so.
Among the general hints at the end,
which no doubt were novel enough in
those simple, distant (and happy) days,
when the great Mr. KENTFIELD once
“actually completed as many as two-
and-thirty cannons in succession,” but
are now everyone's property, is a
quatrain written by Mr. HUGHES, who
kept a billiard-saloon in London for
the benefit of his patrons. It is good
sense, whatever Sir ARTHUR QUILLER-
Couch (“CUE.") may think of it as
poetry. It hobbles thus:—
“William Hughes hopes you'll him excuse
For making this observation :
When you've the best of the game, keep
the same ;
To mention more there can be no oc-
casion.”
As to Mr. KENTFIELD, of whom every-
one speaks as being a man of fine
strength of character, I wish I knew
more of him. He seems to have been
the second champion, a marker named
CARR being the first. CARR challenged
the world for 100 guineas, and KENT-
FIELD accepted; but the match went
by default, as CARR was taken ill.
KENTFIELD, who was not only a fine
player but an instructor of singular
patience and lucidity, may be called
the Father of the Game. In 1849
John Robi:RTs the elder went to
Brighton to challenge KENTFIELD ;
KENTFIELD declined, and Rob ERTs
remained champion for many years.
Beyond these public facts I know only
that KENTFIELD's name was EDw1N ;
that he was always called “Jonathan ";
and that when the evening of life drew
on he retired and took passionately to
gardening.

PAINTED gaily on the cup,
When I drink my early tea
And consider getting up
As a thing about to be,
There's a pink and podgy bird
For a minute's vague employment,
Fairy, fat and most absurd
To my half-awake enjoyment'
For 'twas only but just now
That I wandered where he stood
Very haughty on a bough
In a green and silent wood,
Mid the burnished colibris,
Each a buzzing blue scintilla,
Where the wind comes through the
trees
Faintly flavoured with vanilla!
That's the sugared land of spice
Where one's luck is always in,
And the girls are always nice
And the favourites always win;
Where a dun is never seen
And there's always pots of money,
And the grass is always green
And the skies for ever sunnyl
Bird of plump and pleasing wing
And of curved and curious make,
You're a very friendly thing
When I'm cross and half-awake,
And the grey comes through the
blind—
For you link the unideal
With the dreams I’ve left behind,
With the rainbow and unreall

DEAR SIR,-We noticed recently in
your columns an article suggesting that
House Agents should be more frank and
honest in their descriptions of properties
to let, and we think it may interest the
writer of the article mentioned to know
that we, at any rate, adopted, six months
ago, such methods as he or, she sug-
gested, and have not departed from them
since.
We beg to submit specimens of the
particulars of three properties, supplied
to our clients recently, and a personal
inspection will prove that the premises
do not belie the advertisements:—

grange, surrounded by 50 acres of park-
land. Bone - manure factory within

with three packs (country well wired).
Fishing, chiefly minnows, in the moat.
The mansion contains 6 entertaining
rooms and 15 bedrooms, nearly all oak-
anelled. The best bedroom is said to
be haunted, but this is probably due to

ANOTHER PATHETIC FALLACY.
You have read in novels how a great emotion will
transform a man's countenance; how a poet's face in the
hour of inspiration sets the sparrows singing on the house-
tops; how that of a man suddenly ruined causes phlegmatic
horses to stagger. My own features are of the common-
place type, which nobody ordinarily thinks of regarding
twice, but nevertheless I too have had my experiences.
They occurred on the morning when I received a letter
from Phyllis, which said briefly, “Yes, I think so.” Not
much in that, you may say, but when I tell you it was the
delayed answer to a proposal of marriage you will under-
stand. Shortly after reading it I stepped out into the street
to walk to the office. -
What a walk that was! The light in my eyes seemed
to brighten the very sun; the song in my heart was echoed
from a hundred motor-buses. Never have the winds of
May wooed so winningly a February morning. -
Not a man I met but turned his head as if loth to take
his eyes from my irradiated countenance. Every girlſseemed
to take the keenest pleasure in my happiness, smiling prettily
as if infected by its contagion. 'Tis well, I thought (in blank
verse) that Phyllis now is pledged to me, or, by my troth,
these flattering glances shot from beauty's eyes might make
my heart unfaithful.

A PURELY FANCIFUL PICTURE OF THE MARCONI ENQUIRY.
Showing how the infantile innocence of Mr. WEDGwood BENN, had he conceivably been the object of Mr. FALconER's cross-
examination, would have foiled that legal luminary.
House of Commons, Monday, February
10.-Appearance of House when Ques-
tions called on suggested final collapse.
Doubtful whether, had count been
moved, a quorum would have been
found. Front Opposition Bench tenant-
less. BoNNER LAw, whose thirste for
information is unrelieved by callous
PREMIER, temporarily abandons pursuit
of knowledge. Example loyally fol-
lowed by his colleagues. Only three
Ministers on Treasury Bench.
Happily among them is WEDGwooD
BENN, who, though not officially at-
tached, answers for Board of Works in
this Chamber. Not for the first time,
never before with equal force, is brought
home to mind of Members looking on
what a precious asset he is to a Govern-
ment occasionally in need of extraneous
help. Something about his guileless
countenance, his seraphic smile, recalls
famous group of cherubs hovering over
the canvas of a great master. By
chance he had no Ministerial con-
nection with the MARCONI contract.
Had it been otherwise it would have
been impossible for the most reckless
imagination, the most loosely strung
mind to suspect him of dabbling in
stock with a view to making a profit of
£200,000 more or less.
As things stand he has a curious
fascination for FALCONER, whose piti-
less, persistent cross-examination of a
witness in course of the inquiry finds
nearest parallel in the supreme achieve-
ment of Sir CHARLEs RUSSELL before
he deserted the Bar for the Bench.
Had WEDGwood BENN chanced in any
conceivable circumstances to be his
victim in the witness-chair, response
to his most soul-searing inquiry would
have been a smile of almost infantile
innocence, in its way as impregnable as
a Dreadnought.
Occasionally, when he makes shrewd
answer to inquiries concerning the de-
partment he represents, House begins
to suspect he is not quite so ingenuous
as he looks. That, however, a passing
impression. There permanently re-
mains the subtle, indescribable, but
clearly felt conviction that a Ministry
among whom WEDGwood BENN is
numbered cannot be as iniquitous, as
hopelessly bad, as Mr. HUNT and SILVER
MARKET Gwyn NE regretfully assume.
Danger of thinking aloud in a mixed
assembly illustrated this afternoon.
CHARLIE BERESFORD, who continues to
keep his weather eye upon the WIN-
soME WINSTON, inquired whether, in
pursuance of engineering work at Rosyth
the contractor had come upon a bank
of mud not marked on any chart 2
WINSTON, who knows most things, fain
to admit this beyond him.
“I cannot answer that question
without notice,” he almost humbly
said.
Question and answer struck a chord
in breast of KINLoch-CookE.
“Cannot answer it 2 ” he cried. “I
thought you were a slinger of mud.”
Hadn't slightest intention or ex-
pectation of being overheard. Just
an idea that struck him, not without
tinge of disappointment that one so
much esteemed by him as is FIRST Lord
of THE ADMIRALTY had at a particular

crisis fallen short of high standard at
which he is habitually measured by
a perhaps too-prejudiced friend. Un-
fortunately, in temporary absence of
mind, KINLocH-CookE, instead of mur-
muring the remark below his breath,
spoke it aloud with startling effect.
Indignant cries of “Withdraw l’ rose
from Ministerial ranks. The SPEAKER
interposing administered personal re-
buke perhaps unexampled in severity.
Awkward incident. However, as
things turned out, better offer - an
apology. This he hastened to do, and
in the quaint manner peculiar to House
in analogous circumstances was as
loudly cheered as if he had performed
! meritorious action. -
Business dome.—In Committee on
Supplementary Estimates.
House of Lords, Tuesday. — Second
field night of session. Debate opened
on motion to read a second time Welsh
Church Disestablishment Bill. By
comparison with scene at similar stage
of Home Rule Bill great falling off in
interest. Few peeresses graced side
galleries with their presence. Red-
cushioned benches on floor only half
filled. Marked exception in case of
benches below Gangway to right of
Woolsack. Here flocked the surpliced
Bishops. Effect undesigned; not
therefore the less, perhaps the more,
striking.
Fog filled Chamber with depressing
persistency. Electric lights flaring
from roof did little to disperse the
gloom. Through it shone the white
robes of the Bishops, emblematical of
innocence and of capacity to rise
superior to mundane influences.
KENyon, in moving rejection of Bill,
set forth in detail evil consequences
that would follow upon its enactment.
Approaching climax he, in voice trem-
bling with emotion, said: “My Lerds,
the disestablishment of the Church in
Wales will be a step to the inevitable
disestablishment of the English Church.
In such case the business of your Lord-
ships' House would be daily commenced
without prayer.” - -
Conscience-stricken peers recollected
that attendance at prayer time rarely
exceeds a devout half-dozen. Still
there it is, and a murmur of pained
sympathy approved this conclusive
argument against the Bill.
Bishop of ST. AsAPH read interesting
paper. When he laid his manuscript
on pulpit desk (I mean on the Table),
life-long associations connected with its
appearance—quarto sheets neatly sewn
in black silk cover—caused noble Lords
reverentially to close their eyes and
assume a restful attitude. Presently
roused by energy of the Bishop, who,
untrammelled by his manuscript, “let
McKENNA have it hot,” as WILLough BY
DE BROKE admiringly said.
e About this time discovery made of
curious incident illustrating force of
early habit. The fog deepening, LoRD
CHANCELLOR seized opportunity of
making strategic retreat. Beckoning
CoLEBRooKE to approach Woolsack, he
asked him to take his place.
“Back d’rectly,” he whispered as he
tiptoed out. . l -
Choice of substitute might have been
better made. Col.BBRooKE's figure lacks
expansiveness of Lord CHANCELLOR's.
Moreover, he was, of course, unprovided
with wig and gown. Nevertheless so
dense was the fog that disappearance
of LoBD CHANCELLOR, long unnoticed,
would not have been discovered save

for the reflected light from the Bishops'
lawn falling upon the Woolsack. To
general surpriseitdisclosed Col.EBRookE
sitting bolt upright, looking increasingly
miserable as LoRD CHANCELLOR tarried
on his way back.
Business done. — Lord BEAUCHAMP
moved second reading Welsh Church
Disestablishment Bill. Lord KENYoN
moved its rejection.
Friday.—Yesterday Lords threw out
Welsh Church Bill by 252 votes against
51. To-day Commons adjourn till
Friday, 7th March, when Parliament
will be prorogued, with interval (includ-
ing Sunday) of three days before new
Session opens.

SAFE BIND, SAFE FIND.
WE having occasion to shut up our
flat for a month or so, my wife was all
for taking our silver round to a Safe
Deposit in order to prevent its being
stolen in our absence. For myself, I
was all for having it stolen in our
absence in order to save the trouble
of having to take it round to a Safe
Deposit on future occasions. In the
end, she admitted that I was right,
as always, and then it was agreed that
I should have the privilege of taking
the silver, in a trunk, to the Safe De-
posit. -- -
I felt, as I alighted from my taxi
with my trunk, worth my weight, and
more, in silver. But the clerk in charge
of the Deposit Office made no overt
sigh of deference, doubtless determining
to keep an open mind until he was
satisfied as to the contents of my trunk.
Rather than have him suspect me of
being an ingenious murderer with an
awkward corpse to dispose of, I made
haste to inform him that this was not
the case and to explain to him the
truth of our domestic affairs.
Clerks in charge of Safe Deposits
are eminently human, and nothing
bores them so much as the truth of
other people's domestic affairs. So he
gave me the Company's booklet of in-
structions to read and returned to his
desk, to write, no doubt, to the other
depositories to tell them how their
deposits were getting on and that if
there was a suspicious cove in the room
he was under the strictest observation.
After an interval: “I have read your
little work,” said I, returning him his
booklet, “and find your Subscribed
Capital, Directors, Solicitors, Auditors,
Bankers, Business Hours, Telephone
Number and Telegraphic Address the
most delightful reading. But there are
two points at which I quibble: the
first, is it wise to make, as you do in
the very fore-front of your preface, this
proposition: ‘Visitors are invited to
inspect the Safe Deposit, which is open
free from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M.,’ and is it not
asking for trouble to put it in italics?
And, secondly, is it really necessary for
me to have a password 2"
The man turned from his desk. “I
will take your last question first,” said
he, “for your first I do not intend to
answer. A password is necessary, and
I shall be glad if you will fix on one
while I make out the necessary forms
for you to sign.” - - -
It is said of me by my friends that
I am a man of many words, by my
enemies that I am a man of too many
words. But, upon my soul, it took me
on this occasion five minutes to think
of one. Any word, the Clerk had said,

would do, one word being as easy to
remember or, as he added when he
appreciated my difficulty, as easy to
forget as another. But I did not look
at the matter in the same light. “It
must be,” said I, “exactly the right
word,” and with great care and cir-
cumspection I evolved it. I gave it
him, I saw him make a note of it for
future occasions, and then I proceeded
in due course and naturally enough to
forget it and all about it.
s: º: 3: s: 3:
On the re-opening of our flat a month
later, I argued even more strenuously
against a second visit by myself to that
Safe Deposit. I knew that I had some
very strong grounds for objection, but
could not remember exactly what. Sure
enough, when I got to the place and
produced my signed forms and asked
for my silver, that Clerk must needs
have me give him a password. A pass-
word; why, of course.
“How many guesses have I got?” I
asked, in order to temporize.
“Your password, Sir 2 ” said the
Clerk, for any signs of flippancy are very
properly discouraged in the purlieus of
a Safe Deposit. .
“I can give you the rough idea,”
said I, “for that at least I can remem-
ber. You gave me to expect that this
emergency would arise, and I well knew
that when it did arise I should be un-
equal to it. So I chose a word that
would naturally suggest itself when I
came so to inform you. If you look at
your book it will no doubt show you
what that word is. . . . And now may
I have my silver?”
“I must be told,” said the Clerk,
“what the word was.”
I thought and thought, but there
was nothing for it but to tell him that
I had forgotten it.
“Damn,” I began apologetically . . .
Thereupon the Clerk thanked me
and gave me the silver.

“I am not allowed to forget them. Some talk, and

would I give to be a thinker, to be able to bear down
opposition by the force of reason, to bring doubters to my
side by the pure influence of a great mind! Tell me, tell
me how does it feel to be like that ?”
“It feels,” I said, “like—surely you know what I mean

“Pretty warbler,” I said. “If I could remember the

“I’ll do without it. You needn't strain your memory

“Pooh ' " I said.
“And can do simple sums in addition.”

“Unnatural father, thus to depreciate the genius of your
son. He is a born arithmetician, and insists on doing sums

“Then,” I said, “he shall go to Cambridge.” .
“Do they do sums in their baths at Cambridge 2"
“Yes,” I said, “and everywhere else, too. He shall be a
wrangler.”
“Bless his heart,” said Francesca fondly. “Did he want
to be a little wrangler then?”
º, “My heart,” I said, “is steeled against your prattle, and
Frederick, being upstairs, cannot hear it.” -
“This conversation,” she said, “is becoming too dis-
cursive. Besides, I cannot bear a man who says ‘pool. '
and ‘pish.' Such expressions are only met with in books.”
“Francesca, if you dare me, I will say ‘ugh' and
‘pshaw.'. But please understand me. When I said “pooh'
and ‘pish ’ just now I did not intend to make light of
Frederick's learning. I meant to imply that knowledge is
not necessarily the first object of education. Character,
you know—Frederick must acquire character.”
“His character,” she said, “is angelic. He would give
his last sponge-cake to his sisters.” .
“He must play cricket and football.”
“He can play them on the lawn.” -
“And he must learn to take a swishing like a man.”
“Do men take them much 2" she said. , , --, …
“And, therefore,” I said, disregarding her, “he must go
to a good preparatory school and afterwards to a public
school. Do you imagine that Eton, IIarrow, Winchester,
Rugby and all the rest of them are gaping for Frederick?
He must be put down at once for somewhere.”
“But won't they let him do his reading and his little
sums ?" . . . : . v . . . . .
“He will, I hope, continue to dabble in them. But he
will learn to write Latin Elegiacs and, possibly, Greek
Iambics. Think, Francesca, how proud you will be of a
son who can write Iambics.” - * .
“But, you yourself," she said, “once wrote these awful
things. You don't do much at it now, do you?” .
“I don't exactly make a habit of it,” I said; “but it has
given me an insight; it has helped to build me up; it has
taught me how to avoid false quantities—"
“And that,” she said, “is, of course, most important. I
shall begin to teach Frederick that directly.”
“I wouldn't hurry him too much,” I said.
“Wouldn't you? Of course you know best. I thought
perhaps he'd like to take an Iambic to bed with him.”

Mr. BASIL GILL, who, in the charac-

a very striking personality. The Skald

I had finally accepted Alison's précis, lo, Hubert, the worm,

artificial and unconvincing. It has, I believe, been com-
pared to the work of DICKENs; and indeed it would be easy |
for the curious to trace out a parallel between its charac- |
ters and those in David Copperfield, which would sound
astonishingly complete. Yet no two books could well be
more unlike in spirit. I have indicated that I found Mr.
WALPoLE's tale unequal. The Cornish parts impressed me
enormously. All the early chapters that treat of Scaw
House, and the influence upon Peter of its tradition of cruelty
and degradation, are wonderfully forcible. And the end,
when, after years of striving and apparent defeat, he comes

It is not often that one comes across a picce of coastline
of which the mere subsoil is worth two hundred pounds
a ton for export, by reason of its containing wolframite,
known amongst the knowing as WO2. When one does,
it is tiresome enough to find another fellow there already
exporting that subsoil as fast as he can. It would be
difficult to think of a more convenient way of dealing with
this other fellow than that of blowing him up, himself, his
assistants, his head offices and all, with an adequate
charge of picric acid and an electric fuse—a method which
has the double advantage of eliminating one trade competitor
and putting off others. But for myself, if I had the picric
acid carefully arranged and the electric fuse timed to
work punctually at 10 P.M., I should hesitate to keep an
appointment at the doomed office anywhere near that hour.

There are aristocrats and citizens in the best eighteenth-

culture. Cooking is French “perfected by the influence of

with all this there is in operation a process of levelling—
both down and up. . And over all there seems to hang the
shadow of tragedy which a knife or a pistol shot or a bomb
may at any moment make a reality. I give thus, I am
afraid, a very superficial idea of what this excellent book
has to say, and no idea at all of the entertaining way in
which it says it. But there is too much in it for a summary.
It is the best work of its kind I have seen for years.
The Finger of Mr. Blee (John LANE) is a new humorous
novel, by a new humorous writer, Mr. PETER BLUNDELL,
in a new setting—a tropical island. To dissect a joke must
always be a dark and dreadful task; the hardest thing,
therefore, that I propose to say about Mr. BLUNDELL’s wit
is that it is at times less
original and striking
than its setting. His
characters, especially
the nautical ones, have
obviously sat at the sea-
boots of Mr. W. JAcobs
and not come empty
away. But if their in-
terchange of pleasant-
ries and “scores” has
a familiar ring, there
are other persons in the
tale — the half-caste
hero and the shore
society of the islands—
that are both new and
welcome. When Mr.
BLUNDELL isn't bother-
ing to be funny, and

of the good ship, Luck and Charity, that I am forced to

We
like our seamen to be boisterous, sturdy and downright,
thorough masters of their own subject and, if not frankly
ignorant of, at least not too conversant with, the subtleties
of domestic politics. And a man of the sea, most em-
phatically, is this author.
There is a popular belief—to which I have never altogether
subscribed—that fifty per cent. of the Russian people are
anarchists, and it is interesting to find that the popular
belief is wrong. So far as I am able to estimate after
reading Mr. Roth.AY REYNoLDs's book, My Russian Year
(MILLs AND Boon), sixty per cent. would be nearer the
mark, if not seventy. They are not all fierce, militant
anarchists. Some are very nice, though they are the real
thing at heart. Mr. REYNoLDs depicts Russians of whom
almost anything seems possible. You may find among
the peasants the Anglo-Saxon serf. There are pilgrims
belonging to the age of the Crusades. There are those who
hold religious views belonging to the reign of ELIZABETH.

It would be quite impossible here to trace in detail the
varied adventures of Harold Blee, Eurasian clerk and
(unofficial) pawn in the dispute between the two rival chiefs
of Jallagar—the Commandant's lady and the wife of the
steamship agent. This shows you in a sentence the
character of the tale and most of its plot. The latter
culminates, after the as proved model, in a scene of uproar-
ious farce at the official garden party given by Mrs.
Commandant on the occasion of the King's birthday.
Personally, I should have enjoyed the party better without
the farce, but this is my own affair. Both are agreeable of
their kind. -

WHEN WAR BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE.
It was the severest form of warfare—street fighting.
Moreover there were no uniforms, no trappings of military
organisation. The combatants were in every nonconformity
of civilian dress; and they were mere boys. But as I
watched I thought of RUSKIN's words on the ennobling
influence of war. For it had been raining; yet some of
the attackers lay prone on the wet pavement and even in
the road. - - -
The fight was raging round the playground entrance of
the school where but a little while before there had been
peace and order and the elementary education which fits
boys and girls to be citizens. The noise of battle echoed
in the street where the little girls had only just gone.
swarming home with jocund shouts.
For a moment the firing had lulled. The attackers
were creeping up for a final rush. They hugged the
houses that stood flush with the playground wall. The
defenders, too, contemplated some counter-movement; and
every now and then the great iron gate in the wall was
opened slightly for a reconnaissance. Still the attackers
crêpt closer and closer, their crouching figures suggesting
something about to spring. It was the supreme moment.
I was quite close; and I could hear their leaders explain-
ing the plan of attack and exhorting them to brave
deeds. Occasionally the rank and file answered back—
short, bitten words of suggestion. Discipline was forgotten,
such was the tension.
Then suddenly the great iron gate swung open. The
defenders swarmed out. Instantly the attackers hurled
themselves forward. The rattle of firing broke out again.
The two forces met and intermingled in an awful mêlée.
The firing increased. Figures lay on the pavement com-
paratively still. * . . .
Amid the tumult of combatants I watched two—a thin
enthusiast and a short fleshy boy.
The enthusiast charged at the other, pistol levelled.
Bang! Bang! “You’re killed, Bill Smiff!”
“No, I ain't l”
“Yes, y'ar !” - - -

ain't going to be killed.” . .
“Well, then, be wounded,” suggested the other.
“Na-ohl” Smith's hands dug into the pockets of his
knickers. -
Then the other lifted up his voice amid the din of battle
—a shrill cry that pierced the noise of firing and the cries
of combatants.
“I say, Bill Smiff won't be killed; and I fired at him
twice l’’ - - -
The effect of the words was instantaneous. True, the
fury of the encounter was on the wane, but that did not
explain the immediate cessation of hostilities. The fight
stopped. The killed and wounded, lying on the pavement,
raised their heads to see what was happening; some even
got up. Everywhere combatants stood in all attitudes of
arrested action. The accusation against Bill Smith shrilled
out again. “I fired at him twice—close; and he won't be

ACIDULATED GOLF.
“DoN'T KNow Irow To PLAY THIS, CADDIE * ''
Follow THE S. THE OTHER GENTLEMAN's BUNKERED IN THE E.”
THE JILTED NUT.
I AM not an eavesdropper; but now
and then drops are, so to speak, eaved
upon one, and that is what happened
to me last evening at the Rayon de
Soleil, the latest of the little Soho
restaurants. I was sitting there alone,
waiting for a friend, and at the next
table was a young man moodily eyeing
alternately a bottle and the door. Four
things about him were evident: that he
was what is called a nut; that he was
drinking more than he ought; that he
had something on his mind; and
that he was expecting a companion.
Suddenly his appearance brightened,
for the companion arrived, a nut also;
and it was then that, in spite of any
effort to avoid it that I might have
made, his confidences became mine;
for the Rayon de Soleil tables are
extremely near together and his voice,
naturally loud and nutty, was rendered
still louder by the alcohol robbing his
perceptions of their edge. As my friend
did not arrive to distract me, I am in a
position to set down the young man's
words almost exactly as he spoke them;
and I trust I commit no indiscretion in
doing so. Should he ever read this
page (and he did not look like a lover
of print) he can rest assured that I
wish him all happiness; that there is
too little description to give him away;
and that so many of his kind are turned
down by so many of her kind that he
could always deny his own identity.
He rose to his feet to greet his friend
and dropped back into his chair. On
the table, I should say, was only a
bottle, nothing to eat. “My dear
man,” he said, holding the other's hand
in an emotional grip for a whole minute,
“what a trump you are to come like
this! Infernal good luck of mine getting
on to you. I never was in such need
of sympathy. My engagement's broken
off.”
The other nut whistled. “I didn't
know it was an engagement,” he said.
“Well, no,” said the first nut, “it
wasn't exactly, but fundamentally it
was. We both understood each other.
But this afternoon she told me to con-
sider it at an end. It's completely
broken me up, old man. I haven't been
able to eat a morsel of food; I've just
been sitting here in despair. She was
on the stage, you know, but a good
girl. I'll swear she was a good girl,
and fundamentally she loved me. I
believe she loves me still—fundament-
ally. Of course it was awkward—her
being on the stage. My people would
have made an awful dust about it :
they'd have never given their consent;
but now it's all over. Of course I
shall have to go away—I don't know
where, but right away; but I want to
get drunk first. You don't mind me
getting drunk, old man 2 I want to
get furiously drunk. How much have
you got? I've only got six shillings.
I've already had two liqueurs and now
I've got this Burgundy. I tried to eat
some soup, but I couldn't. Fundament-
ally I'm sure she loves me. I'd like
to talk to some woman about it all;
they're so rippingly sympathetic; but
so are you, and that's why I rang you
up. You're all right; but women are
best. Do you mind if I order another
bottle? Fundamentally I swear she
loves me.”

NoTICING a revival in certain of his
contemporaries of the favourite old
device of suggesting scandal by ques-
tion, Mr. Punch, who hates to be out
of the movement, has arranged with a
knowing hand, who is behind most of
the scenes and is always on the qui
(hole) vive, to provide him with a
similar article. May it have much
success in provoking curiosity not un-
mixed with the worst suspicions!
OUR ONE IDEA IS To AscertAIN–
Whether the young nobleman who
last week removed a silver-headed
umbrella from the club at which he
was lunching was really unaware that
it was not his own 2
And, if so, how it was that it
found its way so quickly to a dealer
in secondhand umbrellas "not a hun-
dred miles from Tottenham Court
Road 2
How long it will be before Her Grace
answers the letter from the Rural Dean,
and what she will say when she does?
If the Duke knows?
And why he sent such a long way
for a money-order last week, when the
village post-office is only just by the
park gates? .
When the subaltern intends to re-
cover from the severe attack of influenza
which has kept him in town so long,
and return to his regiment? .
Who was responsible for San Bonitos
falling two points one morning last
week and rising six in the same after-
noon ? -
And, if a certain pretty little lady not
unknown to the stallites of a West-End
house of musical comedy profited at
all by the transaction?
And, if she did, whether she put the
money into another sealskin or paid off
a part, at any rate, of her debt to a
famous modiste whose China tea seems
to have such an attraction for her
clients? -
How it is that when canard d la
presse was ordered at a well-known
restaurant on Sunday evening only
one party was served, and what the
Management would say if all the facts
were brought to their notice?
What a certain peer would pay to
know for certain that these facts were
hushed up for ever? -
Who is responsible for the story now
going the rounds concerning a well-
known Soeiety Beauty and the Batter-
sea Dogs' Home?
Why the Naval officer did not hit the
man back but contented himself with
being shaved? - -
Why so many young men of fashion
have been up the Monument of late?

IV. Thomas, AND A TURN.
MYRA finished her orange, dried her
hands'daintily on my handkerchief and
spoke her mind. .*
“This is the third time,” she said,
“that Thomas has given us the slip.
If he gets engaged to that girl in red I
shall cry.”
“There are,” I said, idly throwing a
crust at Simpson and missing him,

measles. It is well known that Swiss
engagements don't count.”
“We got engaged in Kent.

“Except the way she does her hair.”
“—but she doesn't strike me as being
the essential Rabbit. We cannot admit
her to the er—fold.”
“The covey,” suggested Myra.
“The warren. Anyhow, she
Simpson, for goodness' sake stop fooling
about with your bearded friend and
tell us what you think of it all.”
We were finishing lunch in the lee
of a little chalet, high above the hotel,
and Simpson had picked up an acquaint-
ance with a goat, which he was appar-
ently trying to conciliate with a piece
of chocolate. The goat, however,
seemed to want a piece of Simpson.
“My dear old chap, he won't go
away. Here—shoo! shoo! I wish I
knew what his name was.”
“Ernest,” said Myra. -
“I can't think why you ever got into
such a hirsute set, Simpson. He prob-
ably wants your compass. Give it to
him and let him withdraw.”
Ernest, having decided that Simpson
was not-worth knowing, withdrew, and
we resumed our conversation.
“When we elderly married folk have
retired,” I went on, “and you gay young
bachelors sit up over a last cigar to
discuss your conquests, has not Thomas
unbent to you, Samuel, and told you of
his hopes and fears?”
“He told me last night he was afraid
he was going bald, and he said he
hoped he wasn't.”
“That's a bad sign,” said Myra.
“What did you say?”
“I said I thought he was.”
With some difficulty I got up from
my seat in the snow and buckled on
my skis.
“Come on, let's forget Thomas for a
bit. Samuel is now going to show us
the Christiania Turn.”
Simpson, all eagerness, began to pre-
pare himself.
“I said I would, didn't I? I was
doing it quite well yesterday. This is
a perfect little slope for it. You under-
stand the theory of it, don't you?”
“We hope to after the exhibition.”
“Well, the great thing is to lean the
opposite way to the way you think you
ought to lean. That's what's so diffi-
cult.”
“You understand, Myra 2 Samuel
will lean the opposite way to what he
thinks he ought to lean. Tell Ernest.”
“But suppose you think you ought
to lean the proper way, the way they
do in Christiania,” said Myra, “and
you lean the opposite way, then what
happens?”
"That is what Samuel will probably
show us,” I said.
Simpson was now ready. -
“I am going to turn to the left,” he
said. “Watch carefully. Of course I
may not bring it off the first time.”
“I can't help thinking you will,”
said Myra. - º
“It depends what you call bringing
it off,” I said. “We have every hope
of-I mean we don't think our money
will be wasted. Have you got the
opera-glasses and the peppermints and
the programme, darling 2 Then you
may begin, Samuel.” !
Simpson started down the slope a
little unsteadily. For one moment I
feared that there might be an accident
before the real accident, but he re-
covered himself nobly and sped to the
bottom. Then a cloud of snow shot
up, and for quite a long time there was
no Simpson.
“I knew he wouldn't disappoint us,”
gurgled Myra.
We slid down to him and helped
him up.
“You see the idea,” he said. “I’m
afraid I spoilt it a little at that end,
but * >
“My dear Samuel, you improved it
out of all knowledge.”
“But that actually is the Christiania
Turn.”
“Oh, why don't we live in Christi-
ania?” exclaimed Myra to me.
“Couldn't we possibly afford it?”
“It must be a happy town,” I agreed.
“How the old streets must ring and
ring again with jovial laughter.”
“Shall I do it once more ?”
“Can you?” said Myra, clasping her
hands eagerly. -
“Wait here,” said Samuel, “and I'll
do it quite close to you.”
Myra unstrapped her camera.
Half-an-hour later, with several
excellent films of the scene of the catas-
trophe, we started for home. It was
more than a little steep, but the run
down was accomplished without any
serious trouble. Simpson went first
to discover any hidden ditches (and to
his credit be it said that he invariably
discovered them); Myra, in the position
of safety in the middle, profited by
Samuel's frequent object-lessons; while
I, at the back, was ready to help Myra
up, if need arose, or to repel §
avalanche which descended on us from
above. On the level snow at the bottom
we became more companionable.
“We still haven't settled the great
Thomas question,” said Myra. “What
about to-morrow 2 ''
“Why bother about to-morrow?
Carpe diem. Latin.” --
“But the great tailing expedition is
The horses are ordered;
everything is prepared. Only one thing
remains to settle. Shall we have with
us a grumpy but Aylwynless Thomas,

“She can't spoil the party. I'm here
to enjoy myself, and all Thomas's
fiancées can't stop me. Let's have
Thomas happy, anyway.”
“She's really quite a nice girl,” said
Simpson. “I danced with her once.”
“Right O, then. I'll tell Dahlia to
invite her.”
We hurried on to the hotel; but as
we passed the rink the President
stopped me for a chat. He wanted me
to recite at a concert that evening.
Basely deserted by Myra and Samuel,
I told him that I did not recite; and
I took the opportunity of adding that
personally I didn't think anybody else
ought to. I had just persuaded him to
my point of view when I noticed

oxFORD INTELLIGENCE.
(With acknowledgments to the scholarly
sleuth-hounds of some of our
contemporaries.)
IT was noticed that at the Torpids
the young PRINCE of WALEs, who is, our
readers may remember, an undergrad-
uate of Magdalen, cheered his College ºf
boat's progress with enthusiasm. “Well #
rowed, Magdalen!” he was heard to
shout several times, pronouncing Mag-
dalen not, of course, as it is spelt, but
thus, Maud-lin. This not only shows
that he has assimilated the tradi-
tions of his University, but it has
had the effect of endearing him to his
playmates. Another and gratifying
proof that the PRINCE is a true Oxonian
at heart is to be found in his religious
observation of the unwritten law that
one must never refer to New College as
New tout court, but always as New
College. This local subtlety he has
mastered, much to the gratification of
his young companions and tutors.
Curiosity runs high as to the charac-
ter of the political instruction given
by Sir WILLIAM ANson, the Warden of
All Souls, to our future ruler; and the
outer keyhole of the sanctum in which
the lessons are held is said to be highly
polished by inquisitive ears. Nothing
has, however, yet leaked out, but I am
in a position to announce that up to
the present time no emphatic com-
mendation of either Radicalism or
Socialism has been made by the illus-
trious pupil's mentor. This may be
taken as authentic. The PRINCE's
lightness of step and general buoyancy
of manner on leaving the sanctum have
much added to his popularity.
E-
CONSUMMATION.
IT is strange that in my day-dreams
I have so often pictured myself in the
Law Courts. There is that scene when
I am the principal witness for the
defence. . . .
“And now, Sir, what is the name of
the lady who was with you on the
morning of the 16th?’”
“I decline to answer that question.”
(Sensation.)
“Come, Sir, I must insist upon an
answer.”
“I decline to answer your question.”
I draw myself up and blow my nose.
(Renewed sensation.)
“I am afraid, Mr. Smith,” says the
Judge kindly, “that you are doing
yourself no good by taking up this
attitude.”
“I am sorry, me lud, but I must
still decline to answer the question.”
(Applause in court, which is instantly
suppressed.)
Mistress. “WHAT IS THIS ABouT THE NEW GROoxi AND HIS INSURANCE 2''
Butler. “WELL, My LADY, IT SEEMs IN HIS LAST SITUATION THE LADY PAID HIS
staMP, AND when I Told HIM Your LADYsHIP INsistED THAT THE SERVANTs should
Each PAY THEIR contRIBUTION, HE SAID—IF you 'LL Excuse Me, My LADY-‘HE'D BE
BLow ED IF HE DID, FoR THAT’S THE sort of LANGUAGE, Mx LADY, THE Low ER CLASSES
EMPLOY.”
And, far away, the lady next morning
reads through seven and a-half columns
of description, and murmurs passion-
ately, “My hero!”
Or, again, it is the most amazing
Murder case of the century. I am in
the dock, calm and imperturbable,
while the grim chain of circumstantial
evidence is fitted together link by link.
One word from me and it would fall to
pieces, but that word cannot honour-
ably be spoken.
At last it is all over. The voice of
the foreman of the jury is unhesitating
as he pronounces the awful word,
“Guilty!” The face of the Judge is
stern as he assumes the black cap. . . .
“Stop!” A figure bursts into the
court. “In the King's name, stop !”
An hour later volleys of cheering ring
through the crowded court as the
venerable Judge, his voice shaken with
emotion, says, “England to-day is
proud of you, Mr. Smith.”
Yes, it is certainly strange to recall
the day-dreams in which I have been
associated with the Law now that the
real thing has come, now that I am to
appear in the courts in very fact.
Still, it is hardly what I expected,
this summons for driving a motor-cycle
without a licence.
“The thousand-foot ship is coming, and if
New York is going to be so ostrich-like as to
give it a left-handed welcome, New York must
be prepared to drop out of the running.”
World's Work.
All the ostriches we know are right-
handed. -

THE WATER RIGHT.
WHEN I settled my house on my
wife under a pre-nuptial contract, I
forgot to specify, among its many
attractions, the water supply, for which
I was indebted to the neighbouring
landowner. Later on one of the
Trustees—a lawyer—found that out.
That is the whole plot, and the story
begins in the middle.
Letter No. 1X. (He to me.)
Despite the arguments advanced in
yours of the 17th inst., I feel it to be
my duty to demand the conveyance to
the Trustees of the water right con-
nected with Skew Brig House. If you
will favour me with your acquiescenceſ
trying to get at. The bally thing is of
no value except in conjunction with the
house. So what can happen? If I give
it away to someone else, trade it, sell,
mortgage, barter, assign or leave it in
my will, what on earth can the other
Johnny do with it as long as the house
doesn't belong to him 2 Don't you see
how silly you are 2 He can't use it,
eat it, hang it on his watch-chain or
stow it away in his conservatory. Any
fool could see it belongs to the house.
Better chuck the whole thing, don't
you think?
XV. (He to me.)
I feel bound to protest against the
whole tone and tenor of your last letter.
The argument is also quite irrelevant.
13th, 1911. There you say, “Although
the valuation—£2,400—is undoubtedly
a high one, I do not think it too high,
as you must remember it includes a
water right, worth fully £200.”
XVIII. (I to him.)
All right, I admit you have me there.
I had forgotten ever writing that. It's
a fair score for you. Still you must
bear in mind that that was written
about ten days before I was married, at
a time when a chap is hardly respon-
sible. Is it quite sporting under the
circumstances to take advantage of it,
do you think?
XIX. (He to me.)
I have great pleasure in acknowledg-
in this suggestion, I
shall be happy to have
the papers prepared at
Once.
X. (I to him.)
Really, I don't quite
see it. My own lawyer
assures me that such
a step would be (1) in-
tolerably expensive and
(2) entirely uncalled for.
You see, the valuation
of the property given
without the water right
—£2,400—was enor-
mously below what it
would fetch at any time
in the open market. I
am told that the view
from the front - door
alone is worth all that.
Which being so, I think
the Trustees are pretty.

in the matter. I've
been thinking it all over

I have decided, as a
protest against the
Scottish Temperance
Bill, to give up the use
of water in our house

matter drop.
XI. (He to me.)
We have given the most careful con-
sideration to yours of the 21st, and we
are not convinced. You must reflect
that the house without the water right
would be of very little value.
XII. (I to him.)
That is all very fine. Iłut what
about the water right without the
house?
XIII. (He to me.)
I do not understand your last letter
at all. The water right is of value as
belonging to the house—of great value;
and therefore I feel it my duty to
advise my Co-trustees to insist upon
securing it.
YIV. (I to him.)
Should you dispose of the water right
in question, the owner of it, even if
unable to use it himself, could take
steps to prevent anyone else from
making use of his property.
XVI. (I to him.)
Dut surely he wouldn't be such a
rotten sportsman as that. I mean to
say what a confoundedly dog-in-the-
mangerish thing to do! Hang it all.
I feel bound to protest against the
whole tone and tenor of your letter.
Do you mean to imply that I would
ever think of leaving a water right or
any other thing to a chap that would
behave like that? I absolutely decline
to take any steps whatever in the
matter.
WWII. (He to me.)
It will perhaps help to shorten this
controversy if 1 quote from your letter,
now in my possession, of September
I dare say you are right. We shall
still require a certain amount for
washing and all that sort of thing.
But as a matter of fact the long drought
has happily solved the problem for us.
There is no water. So why worry about
it? Non est, my dear Sir, non est. I
hope you will have a jolly time in
Brittany.
[His reply omitted.]
XXII. (I to him.)
I cannot, my good fellow, get up the
slightest interest in a mythical water
supply. There will be time enough to
convey it when it begins to run. Hope
you will have a good crossing to the
Hook.
[Several of his letters omitted.]
XXIII. (I to him—Telegram.)
Rain at last. Water reappearing.
By all means convey. Rather muddy
so far, but plumber thinks it will clear.

THE SPECTRE.
(Mr. Punch's solemn Warning to the
latest Type of Malefactors.)
MIDNIGHT, and the tide was almost
full. The wind had long ago fallen,
and the sea made hardly a ripple as it
crept up the ghostly sands. The moon's
image was a great splendour on the
waters, and all the white pebbles on
the beach were clear. Beyond it, be-
tween wave and tilth, the hallowed
enclosure lay very still. Not a whisper
stirred the dark-green mounds that
were tended with so much loving care,
the mute memorials of so much toil of
men, such high and ardent rivalries, so
many of life's fitful fevers, long past
and done.
Suddenly there came a great stir and
crackle in the briar hedge between the
foreshore and the fields, and the face of
a woman showed ghastly white as it
looked through on the seaward side.
She crawled out laboriously and found
herself upon a patch of level sward.
Then the moonlight flashed on a metal
instrument that she held in her hand
and made her awful purpose only too
clear. She was about to cut the sods
in that silent place, to desecrate the
earth where Fame had decreed that so
many of her noblest sons should lie
dead. Madness goaded her on. What
was it to her if she shattered the most
sacred traditions, links with a famous
past, links that united a father's and a
husband's love? The hazards were
nothing to her. Here and now the
deed should be done. She knelt down,
but suddenly, as if moved by some
irresistible impulse, before she began
her work, looked up and round about
her.
Was that only a Will-o'-the-wisp
that flickered on the swampy ground to
her right, or was it something else?
No marsh fire, surely, moved so steadily,
so purposefully, nor ever gleamed so
large. Surely it was a figure, but as
surely not the figure of a mortal man.
Now as it came nearer, luminous,
terrible, she could swear that she saw a
face—a face with fixed and glassy eyes
that looked ever before them, not at
her—this crowned the horror—but at
something unseen, something on the
ground at her feet. Resolute as a
warrior going to battle, it came on and
on. And what was this again that it
seemed to brandish in one hand—a
weapon, surely, as bright as her own;
and what was that which it bore upon
its back? A bundle or a swathed body?
For some moments she remained
there as if rooted to the spot, bound
fast in a paroxysm of fear. Then with
a great effort she rose, shrieked wildly,
dropped her sacrilegious tool, and fled,
fled fast as her feet could carry her, till
she found a gate, scrambled over it she
knew not how, and fell a huddled heap
on the roadway.
They found the trowel in the morning
lying where she left it, in the bunker
that guards the thirteenth green.
“One o' them Suffrygettes,” said the
groundsman to his acolyte. “For-
chernately she don't seem to have cut
the turf anywhere.”

answered the boy.

THE girl who helped in the opposite flat was again
addressing the porter on the landing outside:–
“There's lots o' queer things 'appens to people in
London, and some on 'em takes you quite sudden like—
comes on you all of a nonplush, as the saying is. Yester-
day evening mother was worryin' 'er 'ead about the tea.
Father 'ad bin fractious over 'is tea lately; said 'e was tired
of bacon and eggs and if mother couldn't do 'im a omlick
'e'd 'ave to take 'is custom somewhere else. Omlicks is
tasty—I don't say they're not—but they're the difficultest

“Well, mother and I was planning about this 'ere omlick,
and I was chopping up parsley and mother was wondering
if she'd got to put a taste of onion into it, father being a
rare one for onions—mother says 'e'd 'ave onions in 'is
plum-pudding if she give 'im the chaunce—when there
come a knock on our front-door and mother says, “Sally,'
she says, “go and see 'oo it is, and if it's Mrs. Wortle you
can tell 'er we've got no more sugar to spare. She's
always runnin' short o' sugar.' But before I could git out,
the door of the kitchen opens and a lady steps in. She
was a real lady and no mistake—'at and feathers, and fur
all over 'er and gold chains dangling, and pretty pointy
shoes, and scents and perfooms. You couldn't 'a' smelt the

we've got.’
“Ah,' says the lady, settin' down, ‘that's very interesting,
'ighly interesting, that is. My name is Robertson.’
“‘Oh, indeed,” says mother. ‘There was some Robertsons
lived in this street once. I've often wondered what become
| of them.'
“‘Oh, no,' says the lady, “not them Robertsons, oh dear
no. A different fam’ly altogether. I'm a member of the
Society for Aiding the Deserving Pore, and I thought p'raps
you could give me information.'
“‘Well, mum,' says mother, ‘you can take a look round.
We're pore enough, goodness knows, and there's four more
in the upstairs bedroom. Sally, run up and give 'em a bit
o' the stick. I'll warrant 'Enery's swallered all the buttons
orf of 'is weskit. I never knew a boy like 'im for buttons.'
“With that mother give me a wink and out I went.
There warn't no kids upstairs, o' course. There's only me
at 'ome, but the lady didn't know that. So I pops up and
begun slapping my 'and on the wall and stamping about
and knocking up agin the cupboard and making a racket
just as if there was four kids in the room 'ollering blue

I went down agin.
“I've quieted 'em, mother,' I says. “There was only one
button left on 'Enery's weskit.'
“‘Are not your methods rather draskit 2' says the lady.
“They're ole-fashioned,’ says mother, “but they're none
the worse for that. Pore people can't waste their time
palavering with children. 'Ere you, Sally,' she says,
turning to me, ‘you’ll 'ave to 'ave a taste o' the stick
‘’Oo 'ave I the
yourself if you don't look brisker.' And then she runs on
with a long story about our struggles and the 'appy 'omes
we've lost and the sad way we've come down in the world,
and 'ow we've got to leave this 'ouse all along o' the rent
and the price o' food going up, and what a misery it is to
see your children starving; and 'ow she isn't one to com-
plain, because the Lord made the pore, and if they wasn't
meant to be pore they wouldn't 'a' bin made so, and 'ow
kind it was of ladies like Mrs. Robertson to come and set
in their 'ouses. “It's no use,' she says, “offering us money
because we've got our pride and we couldn't be got to take
money, but if you'll stay 'ere to tea, Mum, and share our
last bit o' pickled salmon and cowcumber we shall all be
very pleased.’ Then she went on to make up a story about
father wearin' out 'is boots looking for work and not finding
it, and 'ow 'e comes 'ome at nights and cries over the kids,
and at last the lady, she gets up and says she's 'eard enough
and it's a sad case, and the Society will put it in a book
and send it out so 's to tell people what a 'eartless Sosherlist
Guyment we've got. Mother told 'er she'd best go
round and see Mrs. Wortle, but the lady said 'er time was
up, and so she went out arter shaking 'ands with us, and
orf she goes in 'er motor-car. We ain't seen 'er since.
I wonder mother 'ad the face to do it.”

Her curious knife within the virgin crust,

THE SECOND CHEST.
“GoING at five pounds. Going–
going—gone!" The auctioneer brought
down his hammer. “To Mr. Jarvis for
five pounds,” he said.
I jumped from the trap and pushed
my way through the crowd. The
auctioneer's assistants were carrying
away the old oak chest which I had
driven over especially to buy.
“Half-a-minute,” I shouted. “Can
you put that up again? I want to bid."
“Sorry,” said the man with the
hammer, “but it's been knocked down.
Like to bid for the next lot, Sir? Lot
seven : A stuffed marmoset in a case, a
set of fire - irons, twelve volumes of
sermons, and a picture by an artist.”
I fled hastily after the old oak chest.
“Are you Mr. Jarvis 2 " I enquired of
a bluff, hearty-looking man who stood
regarding it with evident satisfaction.
“I am, Sir.”
“You don't want to sell that chest
again?" I enquired. “I’ll give you
six pounds for it.”
He shook his head regretfully.
“Seven pounds?" I suggested.
“I'd 'a' took six all right,” he
answered, “if so be as I could have
sold it again; but I've bought it on
commission for a gentleman.”
“Would he sell it?” I enquired.
“No, he wouldn't sell it.” Mr. Jarvis
seratched his head thoughtfully under
his cap. “I were just thinking, though;
if you were wanting to go so high as
eight pounds, there's another chest
near by here as I've always thought
must have been made at the same time
and by the same man as made this one.
I'm blamed if I'd know one apart from
t'other. Now the man as that belongs
to has had a bad harvest and I reckon
if I were to go to him as a neighbour
and offer him eight pounds for his
chest he might take it. Mayhap he'd
take seven. I don't know. Safer to
say eight, anyway.”
“Where could I see it 2"
“Well, if you was to go over to see
it at his farm he'd likely ask you twice
as much as he would me. I'll get it
over to my place and you can come
round and see it there—and if you likes
it you can pay me the eight pound or
seven poundor whatever he wants for it.”
At the end of a week Mr. Jarvis
wrote me to say that the chest was
waiting for my kind inspection and that
the price would be eight pounds ten
shillings—with another ten shillings
for commission.
“Couldn't get it for a penny less,”
said Mr. Jarvis when I arrived, “but I
think you'll agree it's worth it. I'm a

put together that way nowadays—
though the carving on a modern bit of
furniture is a lot better to my way of
thinking. Come inside, Sir. I had it
carried into my workshop out of the
rain.”
I followed him in and examined the
chest. With the exception of some
slight difference in the carving on its
panels it might have been the same
one that I had seen knocked down to
Mr. Jarvis at the sale. The date, too,
I noticed, was 1591 instead of 1590.
“So it is,” agreed Mr. Jarvis; “I
always said they was about the same
date, them two chests. Bit worm-eaten
in the corner there. Does that matter?”
I told him that it did not, and asked
him if he could send it over to the
house in which I was staying as I
intended it for a gift to my host. He
shouted out of the window that the
horse was to be put into the cart and
called to another assistant to give him
a hand out with the chest.
I sat down at his bench to write
him a cheque for nine pounds. Then
I changed my mind and replaced the
cheque-book in my pocket.
Despite the frantic efforts of Mr.
Jarvis and his assistant the chest
refused to leave the workshop. It was
too large to go through the door!

A LABOUR SETTLEMENT.
ONE afternoon there came a knock at
my private door, and Charles's soldierly
face presently peered round the edge
of it.
“How much is it to come in 2" he
said.
“Like that, six-and-eightpence; ten
shillings, if you come right in.”
“Why aren't you asleep?” he asked,
still from the doorway.
“I was. I was just in the middle of
a beautiful dream. A rich, handsome
client with a real fur coat–I suppose
you don't happen to have a dream-book
about you?”
“That's me,” he said, with a grin.
“Are you going to finish it?”
“Not now,” I replied. “You may
come in, if you don't make a draught
and disturb the dust.” -
For some reason or other the dust in
my office is strictly preserved, and I
have to be very particular about it, the
idea probably tº to ensure the
correct legal atmosphere. It is just
this scrupulous attention to detail that
makes the City caretaker the artist
she is. - -
As Charles ushered himself in, I re-
tied the bundle of papers I had hastily
undone upon hearing a visitor, and ||
threw it back on the desk with the
others. Bundles three I have in all.
As the man of whom I bought them
said, if a client should happen to call,
it looks rather cheap to have only an
inkpot dividing you. They make quite
a picture, the three of them, with their
little blue overalls and their little pink
sashes tied into bows.
“Well,” I said, leaning back in my
chair, “what can I do for you? Now
I have a very nice line in divorce for
one week only, dirt cheap at a hundred
guineas. If alimony is desire * *
“Shut up! And don't talk to me
about divorce l’’
I looked rather hurt; I thought
soldiers loved to hear about divorce.
“Look here,” he broke out, “I’ve
come for advice, and I hope you've
got some.”
“Advice Of course I have. Any
amount of it, simply eating its head
off. You really want some? Really 2
Allow me! Let me hang up your hat
for you !”
Then I took his hand and wrung it
a while in silence; I wanted time to

If he was going to ask my advice about
wearing side-whiskers, or whether a
friend could marry his deceased wife's
sister, I was ready for him. But if
“I’m sorry, old chap,” he put in ;
“I forgot. I ought to have broken it
gently. If you’ll wait a moment, I'll
go out and tell the office-boy and be
ushered in gradually.”
“I hope it's nothing complica—
I mean, nothing serious?” I said.
“Sit down and tell me all about it—in
your own words.”
I sat very still with the tips of my
fingers together, ready for one of those
harrowing stories I have read so much
about. But it did not come. I counted
the buttons of his waistcoat, perused
his parting, and finally ran down a
smut on the side of his nose. Still
nothing came, and the suspense was
terrific.
“There's a tiny smut you've got.
Just here. Shall I lick it off—I mean,
if you'll moisten your handkerchief,
I'll take it off for you.”
The smut was removed, confidence
was restored, and Charles's tongue was
loosed. And all done by tact, tact and
kindness.
“Thanks. Well—er—the fact is—
er × 2
“Is that how it is? I see.” And
with true professional delicacy I got up
and switched off the light. It is the
little graceful actions of this kind that
endear you to your clients and enable
you to die with a fortune running into
six figures.
“Oh, no. It's nothing like that,”
he explained hastily.
I switched it on again. Two pretty
examples of tact, you see, and both
simply thrown away on people like
Charles.
“I’m engaged,” he blurted out at
last.
“But that 's not all,” he went on,
when I had congratulated him. I
nodded comprehension.
“A simple case of bigamy, eh—or
rather, breach of promise? Well,
where is the writ 2."
“Don’t be an idiot! Her father
asked me last night how much I was
prepared to settle on her. Me!” and he
pointed to himself so that there should
be no mistake.
This really was serious.
“What did you say to him?”
“I said I would consult my solicitor
about it, and here I am. What on
earth am I to do?”
“How much have you got?” He
put his hand to his pocket. “No, no,”
I added; “we can settle up after. I
mean, what capital have you?”
“If you mean,” he began.
“No assets. I thought so.

“Yes, plenty of those—but very old

out that, as I'm settling down, if
there's any more settling to be done,
it's his turn to do it 2 ”
But my mind was revolving the sub-
tleties of the law, and I waved him to
hold his peace, and thought very hard.
“The firm has an idea,” I said
presently. “Tell me. How much is
her father prepared to bring into settle-
ment 2 '' -
“That's just the devil of it. He
said he would put up as much as I
did.”
“Very proper and usual,” I said im-
pressively. “Now listen. Have you
ever heard of what we call in the pro-
fession acovenant to settle after-acquired
property? No. Well, roughly it comes
to this: whereas one party settles hard
cash, the other party merely binds
himself to do so at some future post-
nuptial date. An extremely useful
| provision when your capital is locked
up. You are young, you have energy,
ambition, brains—at least, so you will
tell him—and several aunts. You have
some maiden aunts, haven't you? As
I say, your prospects are of the bright-
est. After many years of hard work,
promotion, legacies, and so forth, could
you or could you not scrape together,
say, £15,000 to hand to the trustees of
your settlement 2 Are you prepared to
enter into a solemn covenant to that
effect 2"
“I might manage it,”he said,thought-
fully scratching his nose, “I might. I
might even manage £20,000.”
“Well, go and tell him so, like a
man.”
He went like a bird.
s: -- :: º: +
“Well,” I said, when he came to
see me next day, “what about it?
You told him what I said 2.” But
from his face I knew that things had
not gone well.
“Yes, I told him what you said all
right,” he replied, passing his hand over
his brow, “but he only winked—twice,
once with each eye.”
“It sounds rather as though he
were a man of business, Charles—who
regularly consults his solicitor,” I added
for the honour of the profession.
“He is,” said Charles dismally,
“and he offered me a job in it at five
hundred to start with, if I chuck up
the Service.” -
So Charles will have to take off his
coat and devote the rest of his days to
strenuous toil. Well, honest work will
not kill him, and the hours really pass
very quickly if you have a good appe-
tite and do not suffer from insomnia.
And when he 's in doubt or difficulty
he can always come to me for advice.
There is plenty more where the last
came from.

MULEs and mesas and mosquitos
And a land that half its heat owes
To its jobs, its dust, the cantrips of its squealing muley

While the sun-glare, jumpy, aching,
Sets the thirsty levels quaking,
Till a young man might see visions and an old man might
dream dreams |
Mine go this way, green, consoling:—
There's the ridge and furrow rollin
To the near-by home horizon, grey and misty, cold and still;
And the wet hangs on the hedges,
And the clouds have mackerel edges;
Miles away a gorse blurs bluely on the landscape's only hill!
That's his point—I'd have you notice,
Not a tucked-up cur coyote's— -
'Tis a big red Midland dog-fox leads across his native grass,
Full of pluck, and full of cunning,
And (at present) full of running,
Raised on turkey-cock at Christmas and on goose at

That a chap may choose his horses,
And I've always leant to longtails when there's galloping

But the sort that wins at Aintree with at least eleven two.
He's a raking powerful jumper,
Though the bank-flushed brook's a bumper,
Though the blackthorn's dark and hairy with a ditch that's
deep and wide,
His no scrambled blown endeavour,
Smooth as clock-work, quick and clever,
One turn faster, half an ear-cock, and he's over in his stride!
That's the sort; he fairly smothers
With his gallop all the others;
We're alone when, hackles lifted, hounds are racing for a
kill,
And the pirate rooks are stooping
At a brush that's mired and drooping,
And a beaten fox is crawling up the hedge below the hill.
There, they've got him sure and certain;
So—who-whoop! ring down the curtain—
Mules and mesas and mosquitos, mighty things have come
to pass,
For a penniless poor devil
| Has had twenty minutes' revel
On a thousand-guinea racehorse and five miles of English

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Politics, according to the author of the admirable Broke
of Covenden and the happy-fantastic Fortune, are more
exciting in An Affair of State (METHUEN) than any glimpses
that we get of them from Hansard and the platforms
would lead us to suppose. This particular “affair” is the
handling of a crisis due to the Workers' League, with its
fifteen million members, declaring a general strike, and to
a coalition Government paralysed and broken by the in-
dependence of a Mr. Draper, President of the Board of
Conciliation, a risen man of the people, hated by the Right,
and dubbed “The Haberdasher.” He is backed by the
great industrial North, but is, on the whole, a rather
isolated and distrusted figure. Realising that the famous
Clause Nine of the Conciliation Bill will hand England
over in fetters to organised labour, he has the courage to cry
“Halt l” But I hope that if and when such a crisis arrives
They and their surroundings are so well drawn that, though
it would be easy to dismiss the book as improper (which it
occasionally is), cynical, and dull (in places), it has subtle
qualities that cannot be lightly overlooked. What might
perhaps be called the lilies and longueurs of vice have
seldom been better conveyed. Also there are some good
theatre-scenes, and at least one new situation concerning
a dramatic censor. But my chief quarrel is with certain
passages in the dialogue of which I thought that the in-
decorum did not always ring true, seeming indeed less
indigenous to the situation than imported for commercial
purposes. But I may quite easily be wrong here. Any-
how, it is a brilliant piece of work that should increase its
author's reputation.
Life held three things for Mrs. Tremayne—her husband,
her son, and her house. Her husband died, her son died,
and one night somebody burnt down her house. In her own
mind she had no doubt whatever that the criminal was one

which should make a
jury as certain of his
guilt as she herself was.
That is the main theme
of Mr. CHRISTOPHER
STONE's new story, The
Burnt House (MARTIN
SECKER), and the obvi-
ous way to have treated
it would have been as
a kind of Sherlock
Holmes, a let-me-just-
run-through-the-most-
significant - points-
again-Watson episode.
Mr. STONE avoids the
obvious. It is the in-
gather that our author is really weaving a fancy in the neo-
Ruritanian manner, and he makes an exciting thing of it.
It is nice to meet an Illustrious Personage strolling over
to the President's study for a couple of whiskies and a chat,
and it is thrilling to hear in imagination “the tumbrils
down Piccadilly"—motor tumbrils, no doubt. An Affair
of State is an eminently readable book, and a very pleasant
note of chivalrous loyalty runs through it. .
Miss VioleT HUNT is a clever woman. The characters
in her latest story, The Celebrity's Daughter (STANLEY
PAUL), are such dreary scoundrels that you would suppose
it impossible to take the slightest interest in their fate.
But she makes you do it. The method employed is to
introduce amongst them a heroine who, while quite as
unprincipled, retains some attractive qualities, the remains
of a pious affection for her battered and discredited father,
a caustic wit, and above all an abundant and compelling
vitality. It is Tempe's high spirit that galvanizes the book,
and gives it an appeal at which in retrospect you may find
| yourself astonished. For the atmosphere in which she
| moves is enough to make the boldest yawn. Miss HUNT
has not spared us a detail of the sordid intrigues and
wearisome immoralities of the set she has chosen to depict.
- fluence of the quest on
the development of Mrs. Tremayne's character that engages
his attention, and he has drawn a remarkable picture of this
lonely woman, battered by misfortune, falling gradually
under the spell of her fixed idea of vengeance and emerging
triumphantly from her Slough of Despond when John
Dethick comes back into her life and gives her something
human to live for. There is a curiously matter-of-fact air
about the story. Neither in incident nor in character does
Mr. STONE for one instant strain for effect. Melodrama is
always waiting for him with outstretched arms, but he
dodges past it with the nimbleness of a Harlequin three-
quarter. A good example of this occurs when the faithful
chauffeur offers his help to Mrs. Tremayne: “And if you'll
allow me to"do what I can, m'm, I'll find out everything
for you, m'm, or my name's not Sebastian Kean.” Was
there ever a clearer cue for the heroine to smile a sad,
sweet smile and murmur nicely-chosen words of thanks?
Mrs. Tremayne's reply would never have done for the
BROTHERs MELVILLE. “But is that your name?” she
asked, far more interested in this point than in his fidelity.

Londoners are justly incensed at the

revenues, attributed in part to abstinence during Lent.]
SoME there are whom conscience tickles,
Bidding pay their Lenten toll,
Cut off sugar, jam and pickles,
And renounce the wassail-bowl,
Give the flesh to flagellation for the purging of the soul.
Some elect to cope with vices
Not concerned with food and drink,
Practise social sacrifices,
Fly the rag-time and the rink,
Shun the carnal snares of coon-can or the ways of men in
pink.
Some prefer a mental bleeding,
Close the novel's lurid page,
Give up halfpenny-paper-reading
And in heavier thought engage,
Poring over cyclopædias or the works of saint and sage.

To eschew the ballet's ranks,

And the boom in hustling Yanks,
To abstain from STANLEY Houghton and the homely life of

THE S.P.I.K.S.A. .
WITFLLIUS has been a little off colour again, and though
it matters very little to Vitellius, it matters a good deal to
us. When Vitellius is dead—he is an Irish terrier with
the least touch, so the gossips say, of Airedale in him—
when Vitellius has assumed the title of divus, the chronicler
will have to record that one of the most beautiful traits of
his character was that the incidents of a Channel crossing
could have no terrors for him ; he was hardened to such
tests by almost daily use. But just at present, of course,
we are not crossing the Channel; we are in a very small
flat, and it is rather tiresome. Witellius came to us with
the generic name of Caesar, but we could not rest satisfied
until we had determined to which of the wearers of the
purple he bore most resemblance. Hesitating for some
time over NERo and HELIOGABALUs, we gave the vote at
last to that stout bon-vivant, the successor of GALBA. We
were certain almost from the beginning that it was not
MARCUs AURELIUS ANTONINUs. I do not mean to suggest,
of course, that Vitellius is anything of an epicure, and I
believe that nightingales' tongues would be absolutely lost
on him; but with the things that do happen to tickle his
palate his appetite is only equalled by his calm but often
untimely submission to the pangs of Nemesis.
The official food of Vitellius is dog-biscuit, broken up and
mixed with a very little gravy; and there are nights when
he will look up at us with a winning smile, wag his tail,
and make some pretence of doing justice to the feast. “I
know you two dear good people want me to eat this stuff,”
is, I fancy, what he would say if he could. “Here am I,
tired out after a long day's work—two pieces of decayed
fish, some offal from the butcher's shop, and several of those
nice little sugar-cakes in the flat below; but I am a good
fellow, after all, and unselfish. I will do my best to please
you.” But even this, unhappily, is not often. As a rule
he sniffs casually at the banquet, and then sits up with
shining eyes in an attitude of expectant prayer. “A plea-
sant toy of yours,” he confesses. “But now let us turn to
dinner.” Let it not be supposed, however, that Vitellius's
teeth are faulty. Far from it.
Thomas, who gave him to us, and who rather fancies
himself about dogs, came and looked at him one day and
said, “That creature's coat is in pretty bad condition; you
ought to give him more exercise.” “We do,” I said;
“come out for a walk now.” Thomas had a rather nice
cane walking-stick, and he was wearing light fawn-coloured
spats. I persuaded him to throw his stick into a pond for
Vitellius to retrieve. After a long healthy swim in every
possible wrong direction the emperor found the stick,
brought it to land, put it down, shook himself, rolled care-
fully in the mud, came and pawed Thomas's spats, returned
to the stick, galloped about with it in circles for three-
quarters of an hour, and then lay down and ate it.
But I should not mind if it were only Thomas's walking-
sticks. There is no ruffian in the street so poor that
Vitellius will not beg a greasy crust from him; and since,
by a strange fantasy, he regards all the flats in our block
as rooms in a single house, he is always dropping in on
their occupiers and sitting up to a hearty tea of muffins and
cake. And then, next morning, he will steal softly away
into the drawing-room and—behave as if he were at sea.
That is why I wish to found the S.P.I.K.S.A. The Society
for the Prevention of Indiscriminate Kindness to Strange
Animals will, of course, be useless unless it is assisted by
an Act of Parliament. But when once that is passed there
will be uniformed inspectors who will take the name and
address of anyone they see giving food to a strange dog in
the streets or elsewhere. Then they will communicate with
the owner of the dog, and he will be entitled to prosecute.
The penalties for offenders convicted at the instance of the
S.P.I.K.S.A. will be very severe. For the first offence a
fine of two guineas will be inflicted; for the second there
will be a sentence of two months' hard labour. But it will
not be the usual kind of hard labour; prisoners will be
compelled to turn out at 5 A.M. every day and feed a growing
dog on half-a-dozen sugar-buns and a large mutton-bone
with plenty of meat on it. After that they will exercise the
dog up and down the prison-yard until such time as he sees
fit to cat a hard dry biscuit for his supper. There will, I
think, be no third conviction under the auspices of the new
society.

LONDON IS SO BRACING.
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, in an article
on the L.C.C. elections, says, “London
has a bill of health of which any holiday-
resort might be proud—and people from
the other parts of the Empire and
from the provinces visit the Metropolis
not only because it is attractive, but
because it is remarkably healthy.”
Mr. Punch suggests a daily parallel
column to “Health and Sunshine,” and
he offers his contemporary a first
instalment:—
HAcKNEY - su PER - MAR's H.-The
glorious weather of the past fifteen
years, still prevails. Thousands of
people |. into this district by the
return business trains each evening.
The N.E. wind has been much wel-
comed, coming straight from the North
Sea over East Anglia and the Bone
Works. The inducements of Hackney
as a pleasure resort will be seen by the
following figures:—
February sunshine . 200 hours.
sº rainfall . 4 pints.
No fog has been experienced during
the whole month.
BLUE LION, COMF. SAL. BAR. BLLIRDS.
HAMMERSMITH.—This favoured resort
is still rejoicing in the reports of un-
precedented warmth and dryness which
are issued by the public-spirited local
council. While London generally—and
particularly the East London pleasure
resorts—have suffered from an abnorm-
ally gloomy winter, the statistics below
will show the happy lot of this sunny
little nook in the West. Prospective
holiday-makers will note the very re-
markable sunshine figures:—
February sunshine . 250 hours.
77 rainfall . Nil.
No trace of mist was recorded during
the month.
CEME. 6 ACREs. CoMF. TERMs MoD.
SouTHwark.-The construction of
the new Paul's Bridge should greatly
increase the tourist traffic to this
charming old riparian cathedral city.
Delightful weather was (as usual, of
course) experienced yesterday. The
river foreshore forms a fascinating
resort for fashionable visitors, who seek
at the ebb for stranded treasure. Added
zest has been given to their quest by
the prize offered by The Daily News
for any relics of the steamers wrecked
by the Moderates.
BEAU RIVAGE. FINEST POS. EUROPE.
CLOSE FRSHRE. CASINo. 6d. per night.
HollowAY. — Magnificent weather
continues in this quiet little spot,
where the Castle Hydro is patronised
more for its rest cure than for the
feverish gaieties of other resorts.
Visitors soon fall in with the simple
regimen that everyone follows—early
rising and retiring—plain cuisine—
abstention from stimulants—uncon-
ventional costume—and avoidance of
restless excursions. It is a tribute to
the place that many habitués return
year after year.
THE LoRD RowToN ARMs.

MARYLEBONE.-The radiant weather
continues, with a complete absence of
Mistrals, Föhns, onsoons, and
Mizzles. 37,119 visitors arrived
yesterday, by rail and 'bus, etc., and
37,117 departed, making an increase of
two.
The season, however, culminates in
April, when the Cup Tie brings
thousands of fashionable travellers,
who find more allurement in the
charming refreshment resorts handy to
the Termini than in prolonging their
journey to Sydenham. Short excur-
sions are however numerous, notably
to view the monumental masons’ yards
in the Euston Road.

ONE MORE CHAPTER
(Being a suggested finale to Mr. G. K.
CHESTERTON's vivid and suggestive
work, “The Victorian Age in Liter-
ature”).
| THE most curious and inspiring
manifestation of the Victorian Age
has been left to the last, but it is,
of course, perfectly obvious to the
simplest person that the last is really
first. Until the appearance of this
portent, what had been lacking in the
Victorians was, in a word, self-con-
sciousness. They were like a huge and
prosperous business concern which,
when the end of the year comes and
FRED BARNARD (that neglected genius)
of the yokel holding a lantern over the
sundial to see the time. She knew
that time was somewhere hidden there,
but she did not know how to educe it.
Even more so, perhaps, was she like
a motor-car absolute in every part
and ready for everything but with no
member of the party capable of acting
as chauffeur. It was then at that
critical moment that the man arrived,
forced, as foolish old TAINE in his only
wise remark expressed it, out of space
by the sheer demand of his time.
It was, in a word, peculiarly CHES-
TERTON's mission to explain and ac-
count for. Every one has heard of
the veil. It was under CHESTERTON that
England at last realised where she was.
He made it all enormously clear.
RAG-TIME AMONG THE POETS.
FAMILLARITY is said to breed con-
tempt. One hesitates to say that it does
that in the case of the best poetry, but
it certainly rather dulls the edge of
pleasure. In other words we can know
poems so well that their freshness
wears off. And that is where rag-time,
the great antiseptic, comes in; for by
its aid all poetry, however trite, can
be made new. Take, for example,
SouTHEY's famous lyric, “The Battle
stock-taking is necessary, has
no one capable of performing
that tedious but needful opera-
tion. They were like a million-
aire who has no arithmetic. The
money is there, but he can-
not tell how much it is ; the
scrip is there, but he does not
know its value.
It is given to some firms to go
on quite happily without taking
stock; and it is given to some
millionaires to rest content with
dividends and make no enquiries
as to capital. But England is
not always like that. England
has a genius for complacency,
but it also has a genius for
anxiety. Its genius for com-
placency is fairly steady; its
genius for anxiety is sporadic.
Everyone with a grain of ob-
servation must have noticed now
and then that, in the terrible
slang of the man on the 'bus,
we get into the grip of a don't-
know - where - he - are -ishness. tº.
Periodically this want of direc-
tion, this ignorance of the
meaning of life, has been terrifi-
cally apparent in our little island,
To WIN
McSlaughter (the great). “WELL, THAT’s 8 UP AND 7.”
A. Worm, Esq. (pathetically). “WHAT DoES IT FEEL LIKE
A MATCH2''
of Blenheim.” Most persons
are, perhaps justly, tired of the
form in which we learned it—
“It was a summer's evening,
Old Kaspar's work was done,”
and so forth. But apply the
method of “Diacie,” with a little
help from “Everybody's Doing
It,” and you get a totally new
and invigorating poem. Thus:–
It was a sum- -
It was a sum-
Mer’s evening, and old Kaspar's work
It was done, it was done, it was done;
And he before
And he before
His cottage door was sitting there
In the sun, in the sun, in the sun.
And by him sported on the
Green, on the green, on the green,
His little littlegrandchild, sweet Irene.
(The name is, of course, Wilhel-
mine, but rag-time must have a
dissyllabic Irene in it, every
time.)
The monotony of the stanza
in “The Daffodil Fields,” Mr.
MASEFIELD's latest joy-ride on
Pegasus, has been commented
upon. With a little skilful
syncopation even that poem
might be made cheerful and
but never more so than towards the
end of what for convenience in this
book has been called the Victorian Age,
although as a matter of fact the really
salient thing about the Victorian Age
was its habit of borrowing from other
ages.
At the end of that remarkable era
of poets with one leg shorter than the
other a feeling of unrest came to be
evident, which can be best expressed
by the statement that England was
looking for a prophet, or not perhaps
so much a prophet as a lamp or star
of guidance. Perfectly equipped to go,
she was unaware of the way. She
was like a first-class pedestrian with
knapsack and staff all complete but no
map. She was like the captain of a
superb liner who has lost his compass.
She was like the inspired picture by
personally-conducted tours of the world.
CHESTERTON was the first and greatest
personal conductor. With his pointer
in his hand he accompanied mankind
to every spot of interest and made all
clear. He missed nothing. No scruple
of conscience was too minute for his
attention; no cataclysm of human am-
bition great enough to daunt him. By
his assistance the wayfarer was pro-
vided with a new map, which CHES-
TERTON (who was also an artist) rapidly
drew from his own head. By his
guidance the captain of the liner re-
gained an approximate idea of the where-
abouts of the pole. But it was CHES-
TERTON's special mission to assist the
benighted rustic by instructing him in
the divine mission of the sun. For too
long had the sun been obscure to the
Victorians. CHESTERTON drew aside
bright. Try it.

Dear Old Lady (using call-office telephone for the first time, to operator at the Exchange). “AND As You've BEEN so NICE AND
ATTENTIVE, MY DEAR, I'M PUTTING AN EXTRA PENNY IN THE Box Fon YoURSELF."
FOLLOWING PRECEDENT.
ENTENTE - cordiALITY is in the air.
One of the first acts of the new Ameri-
can President, Mr. WooDRow WILson,
was to send a friendly letter across
the Mexican border couched in the
following terms, which seem to have
an air of familiarity to us, we cannot
think how. It was no fault of Presi-
dent TAFT's successor if anything went
wrong with the document. We subjoin ||
the text:—
MM. les Présidents, great and good
(but somewhat too numerous) friends, I
desire to address to you my congratu-
lations and best wishes on the occasion
of your election to the highest and most
precarious office that your country can
offer, and this I do most heartily quite
irrespective of the brevity of your reign.
Being desirous of adding a further proof
of my sincerity I am pleased to confer
upon you my Order of the Canned Eagle,
a quantity of the insignia of which
accompanies this letter, sufficient, I
hope, to go round. Accept, MM. les
Présidents, good and great, if transitory,
friends, the assurance of our complete
esteem and high consideration.
Your good Friend, WooDRow.
Mr. WooDRow WILSON has not as
yet received any reply, the accredited
reason being that his letter occasioned
such a sanguinary mélée among the
addressees that no one was left alive
to respond to it.

LATEST CUCKOO LORE.
(The extraordinarily early advent of the
cuckoo this year has not escaped the
attention of Mr. Punch's nature cor-
respondents.)
A veracious correspondent sends us'
a remarkable account of the conduct of
a cuckoo in Kew Gardens. It has been
observed on several occasions to visit
of the cuckoo this season. Instead of
its customary call of “Cuck-oo,” every
time he has heard it the bird has said
“Jew-jew.”
Our Bishop's Waltham correspondent
announces that the Smallholders' Asso-
ciation of the district are offering a
reward of 10s. for every dead cuckoo.
The Association declares that the dam-
age to crops done by the local hunt is in-
finitesimal compared with that done by
photographers, cinematographers, and
newspaper correspondents in pursuit
of the evasive early cuckoo. One
farmer complains that a Daily Mirror
correspondent, in his endeavours to get
a snap-shot of a rook in the act of
early nests of thrushes and starlings. cuckooing, spoilt no less than half an
After each visit the nest was found torn
in fragments. It is conjectured by our
correspondent (an eminent naturalist)
that the female bird is disgusted that
the male bird should alone enjoy the
privilege of song and feels that its own
claims to equality of voice will never
be recognised unless and until it proves
them by an exhibition of violent and
revolutionary behaviour.
Mr. HILAIRE BELLoc (the famous
Sussex naturalist) reports that there is
an extraordinary alteration in the cry
acre of winter wheat.
A correspondent writes from the
Army and Navy Club that there is
only one explanation of the cuckoo's
early arrival this year. As the air in
France and Germany is so crowded
with army dirigibles and aeroplanes
that a cuckoo cannot cuck in peace, it
is only natural that the timid bird
should come to England, where there is
not the slightest risk of its flights being
checked by collision with anything in
Colonel SEELY's Aerial department.

WINTER SPORT.
W.—A TAILING PARTY.
THE procession prepared to start in
the following order:-
(1) A brace of sinister-looking horses.
(2) Gaspard, the Last of the Bandits;
or, “Why cause a lot of talk by
pushing your rich uncle over the cliff,
when you can have him stabbed quietly
for one franc fifty 2” (If ever I were
in any vendetta business I should pick
Gaspard first.)
(3) A sleigh full of lunch.
(4) A few well-known ladies, and
gentlemen (being the cream of the
Hôtel des Angéliques) on luges; namely,
reading from left to right (which is
really the best method—unless you
are translating Hebrew), Simpson, |
Archie, Dahlia, Myra, me, Miss Cardew
and Thomas. * *
While Gaspard was putting the finish-
ing knots to the luges, I addressed a
few remarks to Miss Cardew, fearing
that she might be feeling a little lonely
amongst us. I said that it was a
lovely day, and did she think the snow
would .# off till evening? Also had
she ever done this sort of thing before ?
I forget what her answers were.
Thomas meanwhile was exchanging
badinage on the hotel steps with Miss
Aylwyn. There must be something
peculiar in the Swiss air, for in England
Thomas is quite a respectable man". . .
and a godfather.
“I suppose we have asked the right
one,” said Myra doubtfully. -
“His young affections are divided.
There was a third girl in pink with
whom he breakfasted a lot this morning.
It is the old tradition of the sea, you
know. A sailor—I mean an Admiralty"
civilian has a wife at every wireless
station.” . . -
“Take your seats, please,” said Archie.
“The horses are sick of waiting.”
We sat down. Archie took Dahlia's
feet on his lap, Myra took mine, Miss
Cardew took Thomas's. Simpson, alone
in front, nursed a guide-book.
“En avant 1” cried Simpson in his
best French-taught-in-twelve-lessons
accent.
Gaspard muttered an oath to his
animals. They pulled bravely. The
rope snapped—and they trotted gaily
down the hill with Gaspard.
We hurried after them with the
luges. . . .
“It’s a good joke,” said Archie, after
this had happened three times, “but,
personally I weary of it. Miss Cardew,
I'm afraid we’ve brought you out
under false pretences. Thomas didn't
explain the thing to you adequately.
He gave you to understand that there
was more in it than this.”
Gaspard, who seemed full of rope,
produced a fourth piece and tied a knot
that made even Simpson envious.
“Now, Samuel,” I begged, “do keep
the line taut this time. Why do you
suppose we put your apricot suit right
in the front ? Is it, do you suppose,
for the sunset effects at eleven o'clock
in the morning, or is it that you may
look after the rope properly 2”
“I’m awfully sorry, Miss Cardew,”
said Simpson, feeling that somebody
ought to apologise for something and
knowing that Gaspard wouldn't, “but
I expect it will be all right now.”
We settled down again. Once more
Gaspard cursed his horses, and once
more they started off bravely. And
this time we went with them.
“The idea all along,” I explained to
Miss Cardew.
, “I rather suspected it,” she said.
Apparently she has a suspicious mind.
After the little descent at the start,
we went uphill slowly for a couple of
miles, and then more rapidly over the
level. We had driven over the same
road in a sleigh, coming from the
station, and had been bitterly cold and
extremely bored. Why our present posi-
tion should be so much more enjoyable
I didn't quite see.
“It's the expectation of an accident,”
said Archie. “At any moment some-
body may fall off. Good.”
“My dear old chap,” said Simpson,
turning round to take part in the con-
versation, “why anybody should fall
off y
We went suddenly round a corner,
and quietly and without any fuss what-
ever Simpson left his luge and rolled
on to the track. Luckily any possi-
bility of a further accident was at once
avoided. There was no panic at all.
Archie kicked the body temporarily out
of the way; after which Dahlia leant
over and pushed it thoughtfully to the
side of the road. Myra warded it off
with a leg as she neared it; with both
hands I helped it into the deep snow
from which it had shown a tendency to
emerge; Miss Cardew put a foot out at
it for safety; and Thomas patted it
gently on the head as the end of the
“tail” went past. . . .
As soon as we had recovered our
powers of speech—all except Miss
Cardew, who was in hysterics—we
called upon Gaspard to stop. He indi-
cated with the back of his neck that it
would be dangerous to stop just then;
and it was not until we were at the
bottom of the hill, nearly a mile from
the place where Simpson left us, that
the procession halted, and gave itself up
again to laughter.
“I hope he is not hurt,” said Dahlia,
wiping the tears from her eyes.
“He wouldn't spoil a good joke like
that by getting hurt,” said Myra con-
fidently. “He’s much too much of
a sportsman.”
“Why did he do it?” said Thomas.
“He suddenly remembered he hadn't
acked his safety-razor. He's half-
way back to the hotel by now.”
Miss Cardew remained in hysterics.
Ten minutes later a brilliant sunset
was observed approaching from the
north. A little later it was seen to be
a large dish of apricots and cream.
“He draws near,” said Archie. “Now
then, let's be stern with him.” -
At twenty yards' range, Simpson
began to talk. His trot had heated
him slightly. -
“I say,” he said excitedly. “You—”
Myra shook her head at him.
“Not done, Samuel,” she said re-
proachfully.
“Not what, Myra 2 What not * >
“You oughtn't to leave us like that
without telling us.”
“After all,” said Archie, “we are all
one party, and we are supposed to keep
together. If you prefer to go about by
yourself, that's all right; but if we go
to the trouble of arranging something
for the whole party * >
“You might have caused a very
nasty accident,” I pointed out. “If you
were in a hurry, you had only to say
a word to Gaspard and he would have
stopped for you to alight. Now I begin
to understand why you kept cutting the
rope at the start.”
“You have sent Miss Cardew into
hysterics by your conduct,” said Dahlia.
Miss Cardew gave another peal.
Simpson looked at her in dismay.
“I say, Miss Cardew, I'm most
awfully sorry. I really didn't— I
say, Dahlia,” he went on confidentially,
“oughtn't we to do something about
this? Rub her feet with snow or -I
mean, I know there's something you do
when people have hysterics. It's rather
serious if they go on. Don't you burn
feathers under their nose?” He began
to feel in his pockets. “I wonder if
Gaspard's got a feather?”
With a great effort Miss Cardew
pulled herself together. “It’s all right,
thank you,” she said in a stifled voice.
“Then let's get on,” said Archie.
We resumed our seats once more.
Archie took Dahlia's feet on his lap.
Myra took mine. Miss Cardew took
Thomas's. Simpson clung tight to his
luge with both hands.
“Right !” cried Archie. -
Gaspard swore at his horses. They
pulled bravely. The rope snapped—
and they trotted gaily up the hill with

DISAPPEARING GENTILEMEN.
THE DALLY MAIL’s “own correspon-
dent’’ at Rome relates in a recent issue
the strange experience of a generous
Canadian rejoicing in the name of
Gaway. While he was visiting the
Forum a man, who appeared to be
an Englishman, approached him and
entered into conversation:—
“The stranger said he was going to
be received by the Pope, to whom he
had to present a sum of money, but
that he had not the full amount in his
possession. The Canadian lent him
£100, whereupon the stranger disap-
peared.”
On communicating with our own
correspondents in several other capitals,
we have been able to obtain evidence
of several other cases in which the
superb confidence and generosity of the
representatives of the Dominions are
worthy of at least equal note. Thus, a
New Zealander named Googley was
standing on the Rialto the day before
yesterday, when a man, who appeared
to be a Scotsman, engaged him in
conversation. The stranger informed
Googley that he was about to have
an audience of the Doge of Venice, to
whom he had to present a purse of
50,000 sovereigns from the Italian com-
munity resident in Portobello, Scot-
land. As he was unfortunately £5,000
short, the New Zealander promptly lent
him that sum, whereupon the canny
Caledonian vanished into thin air.
A wealthy Newfoundlander named
McJuggins, who has recently been
visiting St. Petersburg, was accosted a
few days ago by what appeared to be
a Manxman. In the course of an
animated conversation the Manxman
explained that he had come all the way
from the Isle of Man to engage in a
| three-legged race with the TsAR against
two of the most notorious Grand Dukes.
| Unluckily he had not enough money in
| his possession to pay for the regulation
costume enjoined by the Procurator of
| the Holy Synod—viz., “shorts” of
| cloth of gold and a jersey embroidered
with precious stones. McJuggins at
once agreed to lend him a quantity of
uncut jewels, which the Manxman
promised to return after the race, but,
strange to say, he has not been heard
of since. On enquiry at the Imperial
Palace at Tsarsko Seloé, McJuggins
was assured that no such contest was
in prospect or indeed had ever been
contemplated by any member of the
Romanoff family.
A South Australian named Swallow
was recently visiting the Acropolis at
Athens, when a total stranger, who in
dress, accent and demeanour appeared
to be a perfect Welsh gentleman, came

ful week-end bungalow on the Plains of
Marathon for Mr. LLoyd GEORGE, but
unless he could deposit £10,000 with
the Greek Government that day the
option would lapse. Mr. Swallow at
once furnished the sum, whereupon the
stranger, genially observing “a man
with a name like yours is capable of
anything,” suddenly became invisible
and has not yet been discovered by the
Athenian police.

(Golf will appear for the first time in the Olympic Games' programme for 1916.)
FETTERs of sloth hang round and hobble us,
Swiftly the webs are spun;
Scarce have we time ere the spiders gobble us
To utter “Jack Robinson.”
Chief of our shames, we have lost our claims
To excel the world at Olympic Games;
We are heirs no more to the old Discobolus;
We can neither leap nor run.
Where, ah where shall we seek asylum ?
How shall we gild again,
Fallen and tarnished deep, the whilom
Coronals 2 Frank and Dane
Filch from our brows the olive boughs;
Sprinters we have, but they halt like cows;
And as for our chess and our chucking the pilum—
Ah, stop! It is too much pain.
Thus did I muse, and my heart debated
Sadly about Berlin;
Here, I thought, shall the lease undated
Of Albion's pride fall in
We shall gain no goal, I said to my soul,
We shall fall at the foot of the greas&d Pole,
We shall bow our heads to the Czech, checkmated,
We shall yield the palm to the Finn.
When lo! like a sun-burst seen through vapour
As a three-days' fog clears off,
I found this par in my morning paper,
“Hellas embraces golf”:
German and Yank, you may keep your swank
With the quivering lath and the diver's tank,
But who shall best o'er the bunker caper,
And joust in the sand-filled trough?
None, I think, but the loved of Heaven
Whose path is the ancient green,
Whose hearts are buoyed with the sea-dogs' leaven,
Whose brand is the iron keen;
Only the race with the brassie face
That follow the spheres in a long, stern chase,
That still putt out as the tars of Devon
Put out to the Spaniard's teen.
Here (so carry our drives, O Castor,
Pollux our chip-shots eke)
I will wager a crown to a mere piastre
That Teuton and Gaul and Greek
And the far-away Japs and the sledge-borne Iapps
Shall fall to our plus-four handicaps,
And the god shall fasten the oleaster
To the blade of a British cleek. Evoe.

FORCED CARDS.
I Usually defend myself by claiming
that my mind isn't built for learning
card games. I have cynical friends
who say, “Why drag in card games?”
but, of course, they exaggerate. My
mind is equal to any amount of
politics, law, and finance. The moment
I sit down at a little green table, how-
ever, I am chastened, shamed, publicly
humiliated.
It usually happens like this. Sup-
pose it is evening. I am tired, and I
sit down with the relish of
There is a general sigh of weariness
about the table. “Oh, you'll see
in a minute when you've started
playing.”
I wait impatiently and apprehen-
sively. Presently I find myself with
about a dozen cards in my hands. On
the backs are some very pretty pictures,
representing Sir WALTER RALEIGH
(brown and §: before Windsor
Castle (mostly black) throwing a brown
cloak into a black puddle, while QUEEN
ELIZABETH (brown), followed by brown
gentlewomen, steps all over it. As an

But my respite is short. In a
moment they are after me again. I am
frozen with terror. My hands shake.
“What do I do?”
“Put down three more. No, not
there . . . over here! Good.” There
is a murmur of applause. But Alice
has been looking over my shoulder, “to

The next time my turn

Alice watches me again.
“No, Uncle, not those

So the game progresses.
I am led as the blind. At
last the process ends, the
scores are added. I am

miserable.
“You did beautifully,”
they all assure me in chorus.
“You’ll learn the game in

“Now explain the game, please,” I
venture. . "How do you play?"
“The idea,” says Jack, “is not to

Diamonds counts ten.”
This is the way such people always
begin.
“Yes, but what do I do? Do I hand

I do so.

THE REVIVAL,
Awake, my Muse; O idle Muse, awake.
There was a time, and not so long ago,
When we habitually did betake,
From morn's young flush till dinner's tardy glow,
Ourselves to song: when we went near to break
All records with a fine unfailing flow,
So full, so pure, that people wondered how
We did it—as I sometimes wonder now.
Delia it was that then controlled our song,
Delia that ruled our most surpassing lays;
Her charms that swept us, so to speak, along
As on a wave. In such a maiden's praise
The veriest idiot could not go far wrong,
So fair was she. Why, in that goodly phase,
We did our piece per diem; once, by heaven,
In one triumphant burst we managed seven.
O Inspiration, never have I known
Aught to compare with that imperious prime.
Her (fair) hair sang itself; her eyes alone
(Blue, luckily) were pools of various rhyme.
On these and on her figure (all her own)
We sang magnificently till, as I'm
A sinner, she remarked that she could not
Stand any more—which chilled me like a shot.
For Delia, though too late we learned it, lacked
One charm for want of which all charms are vain;
. ...The very music which one might have backed
To sweeten lemons filled her heart with pain.
It was a crushing blow. In point of fact,
I made a dark oath not to sing again,
But put my songs away and in my throes
Vowed my snubbed soul thenceforth to dullest prose.
But now again there rises in my breast
A quickening zeal to sing the long day through;
I think I feel the better for the rest.
Then wake! We need not tackle aught that's new.
Our Delia's old collection, if redrest
And slightly altered here and there, will do.
'Tis Araminta now that rules our lay,
A better girl than Delia, any day. DUM-DUM.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SUFFRAGE COMEDIETTA.
SHE was going round selling The
Militant and making converts, and she
was shown in just as I was busy over
the housekeeping books, after break-
fast. She was young and pretty and
tailor-built.
“I'm Maud Timmins,” she began
(she had a charming smile); “I daresay
you've heard of me?”
“Yes,” I said, “I think I have. But
—are you really a Suff? I didn't know
any of you were like you ! I had a
notion of spectacles and goloshes, you
know, and a forty-five-inch waist.”
She laughed. “Oh, well, we have
some dear devoted women who are
perhaps a little in that way. But, for
making converts, we find we must
employ youth and charm and bright-
ness; that's why I want you !”
“It's awfully sweet of you to say
so" (that's me talking), “but my time
is simply frightfully full—what with
social engagements, acting as Papa's
housekeeper, and preparing for my
marriage in three months' time.”
Her face grew beautifully serious.
“But there's a higher part of you that
wants something higher than all this—
that wants a Vote!”
“Oh,” I replied, “I shall have a vote
when I'm married Jack will vote
eacactly as I tell him.”
She held up her hand reprovingly.
“With that brow, it's no use trying to
hide your higher self. Doesn't your
heart throb when you hear of the great
Woman's Movement 2"
I said it hadn't throbbed up to now.
“And as for my brow,” I went on,
“please, please don't look at it! My
hair isn't really properly done yet.”
| Well, she talked and talked, and
ſ before she left she'd made me promise
| to go to a great meeting the next night.
| “Our glorious Claribel is to speak!”
| she told me. . -
“But I thought she was abroad?”
| I said.
“Supposed to be,” she answered.
| “But she's just getting herself smug-
gled across the Channel in a big pack-
| ing-case marked ‘Explosives.' Isn't she
grand 2" - -
::: ::: : : ::: :
I've been to the meeting. It was
Jack's evening for coming, but I couldn't
| help that. It was splendid! Maud Tim-
mins looked sweet in pink cachemire-
| de-soie. She sat by me for a time and
| told me who was who. There was
Mary Holmes, who managed to get
into the House of Commons and tied
herself to the SPEAKER's chair; and
| there was Grace Clutterbuck, with her
arm in a sling (in reaching up to slap
a policeman she grazed her poor dear
hand against his horrid hard helmet!),
and lots of other heroines. And when
the famous Claribel appeared on the
platform, oh there was such clapping
and cheering ! And when she told us
what it felt like to cross the Channel in a
big packing-case marked “Explosives”
we all stood up and screamed, and
seven ladies were carried out choking !
When I got home I found Papa an
Jack smoking together. i
“I'm one of them | " I cried. “I’ve
joined the W. S. P. U. . Here are my
sash and badge and card of member-
ship ! Oh, it was so splendid to-night!
Claribel is so grand, and Maud Timmins
is so sweet, and they're all such brave,
determined darlings—t And I felt such
a poor worm among them, never having
broken anything or burnt anything or
been in prison.”
Jack looked glum, and Papa sighed
and said, “You’ve been happy enough
up to now, Kitty, without a vote.”
“This is not a question of happiness,
Papa,” I told him. “It’s a question
of righting a wrong—of abolishing
an injustice—of doing something I
can't remember to a thing I've for-
gotten—”
Papa burst out laughing and I turned
away. “I don't expect sympathy in
the matter from you, Papa,” I said,
“but I don't despair of making Jack
see eye to eye with me.” -
::: ::: ::: ::: x: :::
Jack sees eye to eye with me, and
I could wish it might stop there. I've
taken him to several meetings, and he's
even more enthusiastic now than I am.
I've introduced him to Maud Timmins,
and she's had a great deal to say to
him. I don't think I like her quite
so much as I did. Jack simply raves
about her. “She's a ripper!” he said
yesterday. “The idea of such a woman
as that not having a vote—or anything
else she wants l She's the prettiest,
cleverest, most charming girl I ever
met—except you, of course, Kitty,” he
added, almost as if it were an after-
thought.
::: : : : :: :
I don't see how I'm to get through
all my social and domestic duties
and work for the W. S. P. U. as
well.
Jack and I were to have gone to a
great meeting to-night, at which Maud
Timmins was to tell of her frightful
experiences at Holloway; but I had
a headache, or thought I had, and said
I wouldn't go. He actually went with-
out me ! “Of course you wouldn't wish
me to stay away too, dear,” he said;
“you've the Cause too much at heart
for that. What message shall I give
your friend, Maud?—Miss Timmins, I
should say.”
I looked at him. “I have no friend
called Maud,” I said frightfully coldly,
“ and I have no message for Miss
Timmins,” and I went up to my room
and shut the door with the bang of an
injured woman.

greens? It stands to reason that one
set of duties must go; and so I've
had to sever my connection with the
W. S. P. U., and have sent back my
sash, badge, flags and everything.
Of course they'll all despise me, call
me a doll, a weakling, a reactionary in
an upholstered cage, and all that sort

so voteless, there's no place like Home!
Jack was nicer and more devoted than
ever—but still I'm glad he won't have
any more chats with that Timmins
creature.
During the evening I went to fetch
Papa a book he wanted from the library,
and on my return, when I was just
outside the drawing-room door, I heard
him say to Jack, “It was a capital
idea of yours, my boy, and for all our
sakes I'm delighted it's worked out so

“What clever thing has Jack been
doing?” I asked as I went into the
room. But I never heard what it was,
for he immediately began to tell me of
a dear little house in Mayfair that he
thought we might go and look at.

DEAR FATHER,-Since a school expects
Its junior members to be dumb
About the manifold defects
Of comfort and curriculum,
I have, until the present term,
Observed that custom, like a worm.
But now must ask you if I ought
To waste my time and, what is worse,
To waste your money, being taught
The art (?) of writing English verse;
No art, I hear, since HoMER's day
Has ever yet been made to pay.
If you could see the little swines
Who take the prize for this offence,
Could see the masters alter lines
And turn their rubbish into sense,
You would, I really think, agree
That this is not the place for me.

DEAR ALFRED,-Yours of 2nd inst.

Would beg to say I am convinced
That—though, of course, in days
gone by
It didn't pay the bards to sing—
Now there is money in the thing.
Before commercial enterprise
Had reached its present happy state,
When people didn't advertise,
But left the sale of goods to Fate
Or merit, then the artist's trade
Was very often under-paid.

The writer couldn't place his stuff;
But now that pretty posters tell,
And polish pleases in a puff,
There is a chance for cultured lads
To make a fortune out of ads.

Jackson is full of irrepressible fun;
Dreary Drew relies for his humour

that we are for the moment concerned.

The remnants of breakfast are on the

HAVEN'T I of TEN TOLD You THAT LETTERS ARE SACRED
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IT will be happy news to many that Mr. EDEN PHILLPoTT5
has written another epic about Dartmoor folk. In many
ways, apart from its actual length (and Mr. PHILLPoTTs was
never one for scant measure) I should regard Widecombe
Fair (John MURRAY) as a big book. Its scope and aim,
nothing less than to tell the human comedy of an entire
district, make it the largest achievement that its author has
so far to his credit. Mr. PHILLPoTTs himself says in his
Preface that the idea of the work has been maturing for
twenty years; and I for one can well believe it. Look at
the very title! It is amazing how a Dartmoor writer can
have so long refrained from using it. Sooner or later Mr.
PHILLPOTTs was almost morally bound to tell us the true
histories of certain immortals, known hitherto only as a string
of beloved names. They are all here, they and their families,
the Pierces, the Harry Hawkes, the Gurneys, and the rest,
even down to Old Uncle Tom Cobleigh. You will scarce
make their nearer acquaintance without a thrill. These,
however, are but a handful amid a crowd of characters to
be numbered by the score, so that the book becomes not so
much a single story as a collection, from which everyone
may choose a different favourite. My own would be the
diverting history of Farmer Sweetland and his courtships.
The spectacle of a pampered egoist, robbed of his self-
esteem and, later, happy in its recovery, is very aptly con-
veyed. I liked Widecombe Fair so well that I am the
more sorry to find its Preface, already alluded to, revealing
Mr. PHILLPoTTs as very cross with somebody. He com-
plains that he has been condemned for the large part played
by inanimate nature in his stories. Well, for myself, re-
membering the delight I have taken—and it is here renewed
—in his gift of scene-painting, all I can say is, “Please,
Sir, it wasn't me!”
If you are still in any doubt as to where the “life ro-
mantic” is to be discovered in our sordid modern civilisa-
tion, go to Richard HARDING DAvis. He knows. . It
centres (I mean centers) in the offices of a great American
newspaper. Nearly all the stories in The Red Cross Girl
(Duckworth) hinge on the possibility of fame or adventure
that lie, like the quest of the Grail, before the star reporter
of a Transatlantic print. By far the best of these tales,
I think, is the one called “The Grand Cross of the Crescent,”
which tells how Dr. Gilman, of Stillwater College, the
obscure author of The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire

in five volumes, ploughed Peter Hallowell, son of the mil-
lionaire founder and supporter of that institution, in Ancient
History; how for that reason he incurred the wrath of Cyrus
Hallowell, and the time-serving Principal, and lost his job;
how Peter, a good sort after all, was sorry for this and,
having been sent to Constantinople to mug up his subject
at headquarters for the next examination, secured for the
doctor by means of bribes the highest honour that the
ruler of Islam could confer on distinguished foreigners; and
how a friendly press agent worked up a gigantic boom out of
this for the college and all concerned with it, but one which
was of no practical use to the kind-hearted Peter; for in
the end the now famous and reinstated sage, entirely
ignorant of the source of his celebrity, remarks, “I regret
to tell you, Hallowell, that you are not passed. I cannot
possibly give you a mark higher than five.” There are
other good yarns in this book, and indeed the author may
generally be relied upon to “deliver the goods.” But I do
method of telling a tale, and he can mingle a little laughter
with a little pathos in delightfully soothing proportions.
Of the stories which make up his last book, The Lady of
the Canaries (BLACKwooD), one is an experiment in the super-
natural, and one has a tragic ending, but the rest are in the
spirit of very genial comedy. “Sanderson's Venus" tells
how a young painter, inspired by Simon Jubb, “the Lucifer
of critics, the Don Juan of art, with whom the reputation
of no old master was safe,” to hunt out other pictures by
the unknown author of an incomparable Madonna in the
Palazzo Montegrigio, “invaded private houses so incessantly
that he felt like a gas-inspector,” and found out at last—but
I shall not tell you what he found out. “The Unfortunate
Saint,” again, will be welcome to those who remember the
writer's previous exercises, in the manner of M. ANATOLE
FRANCE, on the careers of holy men. But I must join issue
with Mr. ST. John LUCAs on one point. In his last study,
which he calls “Troubles with a Bear in the Midi,” a very
wish that when in London
his characters would do as
London does. On this side,
for instance, we never “feed
buns to the bears ” at the
Zoo. I don't know how it is
done, but I feel sure that the
keepers would not allow it.
The only girls wenen never
fall in love with are those
whom our mothers and sisters
most persistently recommend
for that very purpose. They
may be pretty, they may be
smart, they may not even be
obtrusively good; neverthe-
less we do not get engaged to
them. It is not that our
female relatives are actuated
by envy or malice; it is
simply that men and women
do not see eye to eye in the
matter of charm. Thus I am
unable to agree with Lady
RIDLEY as to the probability
of Margery Fytton (CHAPMAN
AND HALL). I find un-

moving anecdote that has
something of the flavour of
R. L. STEvenson's adven-
tures with the unforgettable
Modestine, he is in difficulty
about the diet of bears, and
begins to collate literary testi-
mony. Two features in the
tariff are set forth as follows:–
“(1) Sons of the prophets
(and so, presumably, all men
who are not too old. Holy
writ was the authority for
this item).
“(2) Naughty children (this
item was derived from vague
recollections of romances
read in early youth)."
As to the “sons of the pro-
phets,” I want Mr. St. John
LUCAS to read 1 Kings xiii.
He will find that his arctology
is hopelessly unorthodox.
Q
I am convinced by this time
that women-novelists adore
a strong, silent, rugged hero,
who keeps his emotions pent
believable the ubiquitous
conquests with which she is credited almost as a matter
of course, nor can I think that, with all the fineness
of character innate in her and intensified by the tragic
circumstances of her youth, she could so easily and imme-
diately have unsettled the affections of her cousins' prospec-
tive husbands. It would have been the other way on; her
aunt's campaign for the marrying off of her daughters would
have been aided by her having Margery to live in the house.
Interested men would have come there because they were in
sympathy with Margery, but would have stayed on because
they were in love with one of her cousins, for the cousins
had, as Margery had not, the volatile spirit of sheer femininity
which brings men under. The last thing I suggest is that
this Margery is unreal; she is very lifelike and exactly true
to type, but her type is unhappily the wrong one for Lady
RIDLEY's purpose. The book is more especially a woman's
book, and, while all who read it will be thrilled by the story
and fascinated by the minuteness and delicacy of the por-
traiture, the ladies will go further and flatly refuse to agree
for a moment with the one exception I take to it.
An engaging simplicity marks Mr. ST. John LUCAs's
until the flood-gates burst
open and the heroine is overwhelmed by a veritable spate
of emotion. In the flesh I admit that I have never to my
knowledge met this type of man, but in fiction I have a very
decided fancy for him as being much more satisfactory than
the philanderer who constantly interrupts the story by
making love all over the place. In The Beloved Enemy
(METHUEN), Edmund Curne's manners did not amount—he
was an American—to a hill of beans, but he had the patience
of a night-watchman and a heart of gold. The lady–
Elizabeth Thornton—was perhaps, in spite of her sunniness
and beauty, not quite worthy of her prize. Thoughtlessness
is sometimes a pardonable defect of nature, but I found it
hard to forgive her for neglecting her delightful father when
he was critically ill. Madame ALBANESI's theme is the in-
fluence of adversity upon character, and she puts Elizabeth
through a very severe course of treatment, but still the
remembrance of that extraordinary lapse remained to con-
vince one that her heartlessness was so ingrained that not
the most powerful doses of ill-fortune could purge it. That,
however, is my only murmur, and I only insist upon it
because this is the most ambitious—and in many ways the
most successful—of Madame ALBANESI's novels.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EMPORIUM SPORTS.
[A Sports and Games Exhibition has recently
been held at some London Stores, where—
to follow the lines of the announcements—a
Great Gathering of Champions was present
“to discuss matters of sport with visitors and
personally to demonstrate their mastery at
their respective games,” and where space was
provided to practise driving, approaching,
putting; to bat and bowl at the nets; to cast
a fly; to punch the ball; to row in a fixed
racing boat; to play a 100 up at billiards,
“AND ALL UNDER THE EYE OF A CHAMPION.”
Not least of the allurements offered was the
chance of trying to bowl out Hobbs, or “to
have a chat with a Champion, and thus to
improve your game.” - -
Mr. Punch has secured the following account
by a survivor.] - -
“HERE we are,” said Charles as we
entered. “No, not that way, you ass!”
I have always wondered what a trout
says when he sees his pal led away by
the hook. Now I know. I flapped a
despairing hand at Charles and swerved
off towards the earnest sportsman who
had just contrivedasuccessfulcast at me.
I followed my ear, which was pointing
taut in the direction of the angler. ...
My progress was interrupted by a
resounding cry of “Fore!” and I ducked
swiftly, just in time to add to the
general éclat of a golf-ball's impact.
The hook still held, however, and the
next moment I was brought up under
the bank. • , . . . . . . . . . . .
“Now in a case like that,” the Expert
was saying, as my angler, gaffed me
neatly in the vicinity of the front collar-
stud, “when the fish made a sudden
plunge you should have let the line
run." Had it not been of superfine
quality, and the rod, too, one of them
would assuredly have given way under
the strain.” - -
“What about my ear?” I murmured.
“Only one of the best ears could have
—ah, thank you!” I continued, as the
hook was released. “No, it's all right,
really. I've been thinking for some
time of having the lobe pierced. So
useful for hanging a key-ring on, you
know.”
The Expert listened with some im-
patience to my angler's apologies.
“And if there's anything I can do
for you,” the latter wound up.
“Nothing, nothing!” I assured him.
“ Unless—well, if you would just get
that Gentleman Usher for me. Thanks!”
I carefully extricated the Gentleman
Usher from the landing-net—he looked
a bit white about the gills—and asked
him the way to the cricket stand.
“I have never yet had the honour
of asking Mr. Hobbs's advice on the
matter of my play,” I said. “True, I can-
not hope to reproduce with any fidelity
that lovely shot of his past cover, but
I should like to know if the best people
will wear a knotted silk-handkerchief
round their necks next season. In
which case,” I added hastily, “you may
rest assured that I am not the man to
slink off home without going to your
haberdashery department and buying
half-a-dozen of this neck-wear.”
“No doubt,” said the man, retiring
to the safety of formula, “you would
like to have an opportunity of bowling
Hobbs out 2." -
“Do you—do you really think I
could 2 " I asked excitedly, grasping him
by the arm. “You know, there's that
ball of mine which goes with the shirt-
sleeve, and you think it's going to be a
half-volley (sometimes it is). It used
to be pretty useful in College matches
when the bowling screen was a bit off
colour. Do you think it might get the
better of Hobbs—the Oval's Hobbs
— England's Hobbs — the Empire's
Hobbs 2 ” ---
“Well, Sir,” said the man, “you can
but try. To get to the cricket stand
you take a flying leap over the middle
of the skittle alley, skirt the hopscotch
yard and the fifteenth green, and then
go along the butts—I should say the
first-floor gallery,” he corrected him-
self. “Up there, Sir, you'll have to
be very careful and do your best not
to look like a stag, because there's
some gentlemen stalking up the grand
staircase under the direction of the
Open Championship Gillie, and some
mistakes have been made already, Sir.”
“Thank you,” I said.” “I hope I
am not deficient in natural courage,
but first of all you shall tell me where
to find the bar.” " - - ---
“Under the direction of Mr. G. K.
CHESTERTON, Sir? Yes, Sir. Straight
ahead down the Punch Ball Avenue,
Sir.”
“Thank you,” I said, “and after
that I will go and do a little hammer
throwing in the China department.”
I never got as far as the China
department. First of all the Miniature
Foxhounds (under the direction of
a distinguished M.F.H.) ran me to
earth among the Manchester goods,
and then, when I emerged blowing, I
was very nearly harpooned by a figure
in a gent.’s whaling outfit whom I
recognised as Charles by the spats
which he wore over his sea-boots.
(Always a dandy, Charles.) I made a
desperate charge through the mur-
derous hail of golf balls, tennis balls,
cricket balls, and billiard balls, seeking
for further cover, only to be held up on
a chevaux-de-frise of spillikins. Re-
coiling from this, I put my foot through
the skin of a racing eight, and came
down heavily on to a stray dumb-bell.
::: ::: ::: ::: : :::
“Perhaps this gentleman will try a
bout with you,” were the next words I
heard, as somebody alluded to me with
his foot. I struggled to my feet and
beheld Charles—perjured traitor—who
had lured me to the place, deserted me,
and (all but) harpooned me. I was
not the man I was while I was lying
stunned. I fancied I had been bob-
sleighed over, and I also felt that some
too zealous golfer (from a Service ...)
had been using me as a bunker—but
seized a foil in a fevered grip.
“Charles,” I hissed, “I am going to
pink you all over. Then I will have
three rounds with you in the ring.
Then I will bowl at you in the nets.
Then I will cast flies at you. Then I
will play you a hundred up at billiards
—and if you fancy I can't hurt you at
that sº be cruelly undeceived, my
son. I am going to be an assailant
now, under the advice of all the
Experts.” -
3: . . . . . . . * * :: -k
Charles's man opened the door and
I delivered a limp bundle into his
arms. - - -
“This,” I said, “is your master.
Arrange him roughly on his bed, and
then send for a surgeon to make the
necessary extractions, etc. We have
been playing a compendium of sports
together. This end, by the way, is his
head. . It is wearing spats merely as a
temporary dressing.” º
I had just enough strength left to
return to my taxi. .
“To the nearest hospital,” I said.
“I am going to give myself up.”

A TRIBUTE TO ALEXANDRA, QUEEN OF NURSES.
IT is just fifty years since Denmark's PRINCEss won the
place that she still keeps in the hearts of the English
people when she came over the sea to be wedded to our
PRINCE of WALEs. It is desired to record this Jubilee by
the building of a Queen Alexandra's Nurses' Home in
connection with the Alton Hospital for Crippled Children.
The QUEEN-MoTHER has always been devoted to the
welfare of Nurses, and has closely concerned herself with
the interests of those who tend the little patients at Alton.
Mr. Punch ventures to appeal to the many friends who
share his love of children and his loyalty to QUEEN
ALEXANDRA to help of their generosity to raise the sum
of £10,000 needed for this most appropriate memorial.
Contributions should be sent to Sir WILLIAM TRELoAR,

That you should send me forth resolved to gain
Oblivion by plunging them in pain.
I’ause and reflect how at an early date
Maybe some stricken brute will cease his snarling
And (in the jungle's tongue) ejaculate,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A GREAT CONTEST OF WITS.
IN a recent number of The Daily
Mail London and Greater London were
startled and shocked to learn that Mr.
PLowden, the BERNARD SHAW of Mary-
lebone, has a serious rival—by which
we mean a comic rival.
The deadly article ran thus:—
“A South London Solomon is Mr. I. A.
Symmons, the magistrate at Greenwich Police
Court, where he has patched up many a do:
mestic quarrel and solved many a matrimonial
problem. Mr. Plowden will have to look to
inis laurels as London's most quoted magistrate.
A handsome man with a ruddy complexion
and keen but kindly blue eyes, Mr. Symmons
inspires confidence at the first glance. His
manner is cheerful and tolerant, but he can be
firm to the point of severity if he suspects that
a witness or prisoner is lying to him. A good
man to confess to, but a bad man
“What's that ?” asked the wit. “A
summons 2"
I gave it to him and he ran his eagle
eye over it.
“Ah, no,” he said, “not a summons
but a SYMMONs.”
For myself, I had difficulty in retain-
ing my feet, but an usher passing at
the time fell into a stupor of mirth
from which, I am told, he has not yet
recovered. -
“And what can I do for you?” Mr.
PLowden inquired in his inimitableway.
“Simply this,” I said. “The sugges-
tion of that article is that your nose is
being put out of joint. , Kindly tell me
how you yourself feel about it.”
“Well,” replied the Marylebone
Solon, “do I look down-hearted 2"
Never was there such a morning.
Officials tottered gasping for breath
into the street and leaned against lamp-
posts and omnibuses to complete their
fits of hilarity. Traffic was suspended.
Portions of the ceiling fell down. “Fiat
justitia, ruat colum,” said Mr. PLowDEN
more than once. Prisoners escaped.
The public gallery was like a battle-
field.
Here are Mr.
scintilla juris:–
“Eat, drink, and be buried : that is
the summary of too many lives.
The wiser the wife the better the
dinner she gives her husband.
Life is a mixture. It isn't all beer
and picture-palaces. s
It isn't only at the National Gal-
PLowDEN's rival
to deceive, he quickly probes to
the heart of evidence, makes his
decision swiftly, and punishes
according to the means of the
offender.
Some of Mr. Symmons's com-
ments are worth reproducing.
The following are samples:
Nagging is the constant reitera-
tion of unpleasant truths.
Any man can talk a woman over
if he tries.
Life is a compound. It has the
tears of things, it has the joy, the
humour, the pleasure of things.
If some women were only better
cooks there would be far fewer
domestic differences for us to
settle. -
There is always the chance for
the good joke.
A large share of the melancholy
of life is due to some derangement
of the digestive system.”
Feeling that these mo-
mentous statements were of
such a nature as to need
investigation, Mr. Punch
commissioned one of his less
dull young men to visit the
famous cadi of Marylebone,

jured. *.
The best constables are
the politest—they might be
called “If-you-police-men.'
A lost latchkey leads to a
multitude of sins.” -
During the recital of these
sparklers one man and one
only kept a straight face.
In vain did Mr. PLOWDEN
bend his wits upon this stoli
spectator, until at last he
called an usher and orde
him to conduct the man from
the court as a hindrance to
justice. The usher returned
saying that he had done so.
“Wäs he deaf 2" asked
Mr. PLowDEN. -
“No, Sir,” said the usher.
“He comes from Greenwich.”

is surely the highest proof of solicitude
to tell a man that his pre-eminence is
in danger. The setting star is always
happy to learn of one that is rising, and
his friends cannot be too eager in
bringing the news.
Mr. PLowDEN, a short corpulent man

WINTER SPORT.
VI.-A HAPPY ENDING.
“For our last night they might at
least have had a dance,” said Myra,
“even if there was no public presenta-
tion.”
“As we had hoped,” I admitted.
“What is a gymkhana, anyway?”
asked Thomas.
“A few little competitions,” said
Archie. “One must cater for the
chaperons sometimes. . You are all
entered for the Hat-making and the
Feather-blowing—Dahlia thought it
would amuse you.”
“At Cambridge,”Isaid reminiscently,
“I once blew the feather 119 feet
7 inches. Unfortunately I stepped out-
side the circle. My official record is
2 feet.” i
“Did you ever trim a hat at Cam-
bridge?” asked Myra. “Because you've
got to do one for me to-night.”
I had not expected this. My view
of the competition had been that I
should have to provide the face and
that she would have to invent some
suitable frame for it.
“I’m full of ideas,” I lied.
Nine o'clock found a small row of
us prepared to blow the feather. The
presidential instructions were that we
had to race our feather across a chalk-
line at the end of the room, anybody
touching his feather to be disqualified.
“In the air or on the floor?” asked
Simpson earnestly.
“Just as you like,” said the President
kindly, and came round with the bag.
I selected Percy with care—a dear
little feather about half-an-inch long
and of a delicate whitey-brown colour.
I should have known him again any-
where. -
“Go!" said the President. ‘ I was
rather excited, with the result that my
first blow was much too powerful for
Percy. He shot up to the ceiling and,
in spite of , all I could do, seemed
inclined to stay there. Anxiously I
waited below with my mouth open; he
came slowly down at last; and in my
eagerness I played my second just a
shade too soon. It missed him. My
third (when I was ready for it) went
harmlessly over his head. A frantic
fourth and fiſth helped him down-
wards . . . . and in another moment
my beautiful Percy was on the floor. I
dropped on my knees and played my
sixth vigorously. He swirled to the
left; I was after him like a shot . . . .
and crashed into Thomas. We rolled
over in a heap.
“Sorry!" we apologised as we got
back on to our hands and knees.
Thomas went on blowing.
“Where's my feather?” I said.
Thomas was now two yards ahead,
blowing like anything. A terrible sus-
picion darted through my mind.
“Thomas,” I said, “ you've got my
feather.” -
He made no answer.
after him.
“That's Percy,” I said. “I should
know him anywhere. You're blowing
Percy. It's very bad form to blow
another man's feather. If it got about,
you would be cut by the county. Give
me back my feather, Thomas.”
“How do you know it's your fea-
ther?” he said truculently. “Feathers
are just alike.” -
“How do I know 2 " I asked in
amazement. “A feather that I've
brought up from the egg? Of course
I know Percy.” I leant down to him.
“P–percy,” I whispered. He darted
forward a good six inches. “You
see,” I said, “he knows his name.”
“As a matter of fact,” said Thomas,
“his name's P-paul. Look, I'll
show you.”
“You needn't bother, Thomas,” I
said hastily. “This is mere trifling.
I know that's my feather. I remember
his profile distinctly.”
“Then where's mine?”
“How do I know? You may have
swallowed it. Go away and leave
Percy and me to ourselves. You're
only spoiling the knees of your trousers
by staying here.”
“Paul and I,” began.Thomas
He was interrupted by a burst of
I scrambled
applause. Dahlia had cajoled her
feather over the line first. Thomas
rose and brushed himself. “You can
'ave him,” he said.
“There!” I said, as I picked Percy
up and placed him reverently in my
waistcoat pocket. “That shows that
he was mine. If he had been your
own little Paul you would have loved
him even in defeat. Oh, musical chairs
now 2 Right-o.” And at the President's
touch I retired from the arena.
We had not entered for musical
chairs. Personally I-should have liked
to, but it was felt that, if none of us
did, then it would be more easy to stop
Simpson doing so. For at musical
chairs Simpson is—I am afraid there is
only one word for it; it is a word that
I hesitate to use, but the truth must
prevail–Simpson is rough. He lets
himself go. He plays all he knows.
Whenever I take Simpson out any-
where I always whisper to my hostess,
“Not musical chairs.”
The last event of the evening was
the hat-making competition. Each
man of us was provided with five large
sheets of coloured crinkly paper, a
packet of pins, a pair of scissors and a
lady opposite to him.
“Have you any plans at all?” asked
Myra.
“Heaps. Tell me, what sort of hat
would you like? Something for the
Park?” I doubled up a piece of blue
paper and looked at it. “You know,
if this is a success, Myra, I shall often
make your hats for you.”
Five minutes later I had what I
believe is called a “foundation.” Any-
how, it was something for Myra to put
her head into.
“Our very latest Bond Street model,”
said Myra. “Only fifteen guineas—
or three-and-ninepence if you buy it at
our other establishment in Battersea.”
“Now then, I can get going,” I said,
and I began to cut out a white
feather. “Yes, your ladyship, this is
from the genuine bird on our own
ostrich farm in the Fulham Road.
Plucked while the ingenuous biped had
its head in the sand. I shall put that
round the brim,” and I pinned it round.
“What about a few roses?” said
Myra, fingering the red paper.
“The roses are going there on the
right.” I pinned them on. “And a
humming-bird and some violets next
to them . . . I say, I've got a lot of
paper over. What about a nice piece
of cabbage . . . there . . . and a
bunch of asparagus . . . and some
tomatoes and a seagull's wing on the
left. The back still looks rather bare
—let's have some poppies.”
“There's only three minutes more,”
said Myra, “ and you haven't used all
the paper yet.”
“I’ve got about one William Allan
Richardson and a couple of canaries
over,” I said, after examining my stock.
“Let's put it inside as lining. There,
Myra, my dear, I'm proud of you. I
always say that in a nice quiet hat
nobody looks prettier than you.”
“Time !” said the President.
Anxious matrons prowled round us.
“We don't know any of the judges,”
I whispered. “This isn't fair.”
The matrons conferred with the
President. He cleared his throat.

A UNICORN STORY.
I CARED not for his lordship's right,
Nor for his lordship's rangers,
Because the lanes with may were white
And Age and I were strangers;
In Woolcombe Wood that summer
In Orn—
The wisest wood in Britain—
I found a baby unicorn
As pretty as a kitten
Most fairylike and elfinwise
Was he from hoof to ear-points,
A budding horn betwixt his eyes,
The tiniest of spear-points;
Beside the brook where earth the brocks
He stripped a sapling sallow,
As ruddy as a little fox,
As dappled as a fallow !
He stamped and snorted on the view,
He trotted and he ambled,
But ever yet the closer drew
And in my shadow gambolled;
I rubbed his ears and wild shy head
Where still the velvet lingers;
He ate with grace my salted bread
And mumbled at my fingers!
A mile he followed o'er the grass
And took the crusts I tossed him,
Then, sudden as the shadows pass,
I found that I had lost him;
I whistled on the dainty thing,
None answered to my calling,
Save for the far-off, tuneful ring
Of faint-heard echoes falling.
Though naught know I of signs and
saints
And things pertaining thereto,
And portents that a herald paints,
One marvel I can swear to:
In Woolcombe Wood that summer
In Orn–
A wood it ne'er deceives me—
I saw a little unicorn,
But nobody believes me!

A DETAIL.
UPON his appointment to a Colonial
Governorship it seemed meet to the
members of his old department, his
colleagues, deputies, juniors and what-
nots, to give a dinner to Sir Hen
Kelkershows, K.C., K.C.B., K.C.V.O.,
LL.M., F.R.S.L., and once President
of the Wimbledon Wanderers A.F.C.
Saunders and I were appointed to do
all the dirty work of the affair, not
because we were the most businesslike,
but because we had the least business
to do. We demonstrated our incapacity
from the start by keeping all our notes
and accounts in soparate books, which
could not be made upon comparison to
| tally in any one important particular.
Over the mere pecuniary department
we did not worry much; “let’s have

the dinner first,” we agreed, “and see
about that afterwards.” The graver
difficulty arose when I telephoned to
Saunders on the morning of the ap-
|pointed day to say that the list was
now closed and covers might safely be
ordered for thirty-six diners. His only
comment upon this was that there were
thirty-seven names on his list and it
seemed a pity to leave the last man with
nothing to eat.
“Have you counted them 2" said I.
He had.
“Have you counted them carefully?”
He had.
“Then count them again,” said I.
He had.
We adjourned consideration of the
matter for separate recounts. I took my
list and counted from the top to the
bottom; the total came to thirty-six. I
counted from the bottom to the top; the
total came to thirty-six. I started in
the middle and counted out both ways,
and still the total came to thirty-six.
Then I rang up Saunders again.
“Well,” I said tolerantly, “what do
you make it now?”
“Thirty-seven. And you?”
There seemed nothing for it but that
I should go and see Saunders per-
sonally, except that Saunders should
come and see me. This I brought
about. I produced to him my list, the
cheques I had received and all other
data, and waited for him to confess that
he was no mathematician.
“There is no method known to
science,” I said, “by which you can
arrive at a total other than thirty-six.”
“Quite so,” said he, as he proceeded
to compare his list with mine. “But
it seems to me that you have omitted
the name of one person who, I have
reason to suppose, will be present at
this affair.”
It appeared that he was right after
all. It is odd how these little things
escape one. I had omitted to include
Sir Henry Kelkershows, K.C., K.C.B.,
K.C.V.O., LL.M., F.R.S.L., and once
President of the W.W.A.F.C.

SIR,-May I call attention to the
singular coincidence brought to m

quite close to the Rufus stone, while
Mr. LEWIS HARcourt, the present

constantly contiguous at Cabinet meet-
ings to the Attorney-General, Sir RUFUs

SIR,-May I call your attention to a
wonderful coincidence that has so far
escaped the notice of experts? Last
Friday, Professor Sir ARTHUR QUILLER-
Couch was entertained by the White-
friars Club and had his health proposed
by Sir WILLIAM RoBERTson NicoLL.
Not only were they both knights and
Whitefriar knights, but while the
initials of Sir ARTHUR QUILLER-Couch's
surname form the title Q.C., those of
his health proposer are R.N. The
fact that the Professor has never been
called to the Bar, while Sir WILLIAM
|Robertson NicoLL never served in
the Navy, only enhances the singularity
of the coincidence. -
Yours, etc., TIBERIU's MUDD.
DEAR SIR,-The curious similarity
|between the name of the Progressive
leader and the bell in the Westminster
| clock tower deserves, I think, to be
chronicled at this juncture. The fact
that the former is spelt with two “n's,”
while the latter only has one, will
doubtless furnish food for philologists.
Apropos of municipal politics I cannot
refrain from noting that in Bermondsey
the name of the unsuccessful Labour
candidate was AMMON. Can this be a
descendant of the Jupiter Ammon of
whom I used to hear in my childhood?

“YEs, I LIKED THE SERVICE, BUT I NEveR ENJOY SUNDAY IN THE country.
RUNNING ON AT HOME ALL THE TIME.”
IN THE TEETH OF RESISTANCE.
I went into the place which was
called a Drug Stores. There were one or
two cameras in the window, a number
of scent bottles and some portraits of
celebrities in the pharmaceutical world
—Mr. SIMs, Mr. SANDow, Miss PHYLLIS
DARE, and so on. I said to the eminent
Harley Street specialist who stood be-
hind the bar, “I want a tube of
Kallinikos Tooth Paste, please.” He
moved away two or three steps, prised
up one of the glass cases of his museum,
and said, “We have a much better
preparation here called Tenika, if you
care to try it.” I said, “I want a tube
of Kallinikos Tooth Paste, please.” He
said “Tenika is now being recom-
mended by all the most fashionable
physicians. It is the best germicide
in the world; another advantage of it
is that you get more of it for a shilling.”
I said, “I want a tube of Kallinikos
Tooth Paste, please.” “Tenika,” he
said, “is the i. preparation in the
market. All our customers find that
they prefer it to Kallinikos. I use
Tenika myself.”
I CAN'T BEAR To THINK of THAT PEw-RENT
I gazed round the emporium in silent
despair. Then I moved away to a
corner and sat down on a weighing-
machine, between a large basket of
sponges and a little conventicle of
soda-water syphons. I looked for some
time at their silent, patient faces, then
I looked at the door. Outside ran the
careless stream of London's traffic.
I bowed my head in my hands and
thought. Then I had a bright idea.
I got up and went to the consulting
counter again. The Rosicrucian was
still there. “Acolyte of AEsculapius,”
I said to him solemnly, with a tear in
my voice, “you are one of the initiated;
you swing a censer in the sacred shrine;
you serve the son of Apollo. It is not
to be expected that a miserable pilgrim
like myself can come up to your style,
but in all things possible I should like
to imitate you. Tell me what is the
hair-oil that you use—what the Sapona-
ceous detergent, and I will strive to
follow your example. Tell me the shape
of your lufah, the size of your bath.
Tell me where you get the wonderful
pine-breathing pastilles that make your
voice so melodious, and I also will send
for a sample bottle as per ‘ad.’ Tell
me everything about your private life,
and the name and address of the young
lady you walk out with, and I will try
to love her too. But spare me this one
foible. Say, if you like, that I have
a rich uncle who will disinherit me if
he ever hears of my using any other
tooth paste. Think that I have ac-
quired a morbid craving, now too strong
to be overcome, for this miserable, in-
effectual fangwash. Only be merciful,
and give me a tube of Kallinikos l’’
Looking deeply grieved, he wrapped
the abhorred dentifrice in a little piece
of paper, sealed it and placed it on the
counter. Just then a stranger came
in and went up to the oracle. “I
want a tube of Kallinikos Tooth Paste,”
he said. And he got it immediately,
without demur. He was a weak-
looking man and did not appear to
have any gift of rhetorical persuasion.
It would have fared ill with him, I
think, if it had not been for me. And
if he knew all that I had done for
him he would not have broached his
little tube that night without first of
all lifting a silent glass to my memory.

no reason why they should not asso-

I HAVE always said that if ever I
met Yvonne I should fall in love with
her. You, perhaps, are an unromantic
person; you could not fall in love with
a mere name ; that would be absurd.
You, perhaps, are happily married to
Amelia (or Eliza). But why was she
favoured above all others? For some
charm which I'll wager you can't
describe. What, for the matter of that,
did Eliza (or Amelia) see in you? She,
poor dear, may by this time have
fallen to wondering; but I will not
dwell upon that.
Only remember this: her charm and
yours may fade, but Yvonne is always
Yvonne. To get a letter signed
“Yvonne"; to call from the foot of the
stairs “Yvonne.” Try it; and then
have a shot at Amelia (or Eliza) after-
wards. But first of all you must hear
the story.
You know those initials they put at
the top of business letters? Perhaps
you are not in business? I congra-
tulate you. Well, suppose you were,
and that your name was Cyrus K.
Bulger, and the name of one of your
many typists Euphemia Stunt. Then
at the top of every letter you dictated
to the fair Euphemia would appear the
mystic sign C.K.B./E.S., so that if
anything went wrong you could share
the blame publicly and fight it out in
private. But supposing that one bright
spring morning I had a letter from you
marked C.K.B./Y.A., what then 2 I
should call at your office, and there
would be a vacancy in your staff with-
out formal notice.
Now this is what actually happened.
I did get a letter marked C.K.B.I.Y.A.,
from my friend Charles Kay Bradshaw,
of the Life and Liberty Insurance
Company; and I went to his office in
search of Yvonne. Ever since I had
known Charles it had been C.K.B./O.A.;
that must be Olive, I thought, or
Ophelia, dark, beautiful, interesting—
the elder sister; but Yvonne ! -
How I treasured that letter, with its
queer little mistakes | She had not
mastered the horrid machine yet, and
she never would—I would see to that.
I had never been to Charles's office
before, and when I arrived I did not
know whom to ask for. It was Miss
Adair, I felt certain, Yvonne Adair,
the loveliest name in the world. How-
ever, I began with Charles. He was
businesslike; we would get to the
point at once. Who had typed the
letter? I held it out tremblingly and
he looked at it without emotion.
“Atkins,” he said.
“Christian name 2 ” I cried.
“Oswald,” said Charles, simply.
“But that 's his father's name, too;
so we call the son “Young Atkins.'
Have you any objection ?”

“A LITTLE BIT OF BLUE.”
WHEN the waves rise high and higher as they toss about
together,
And the March-winds, loosed and angry, cut your chilly
heart in two, -
Here are eighteen gallant gentlemen who come to face the
weather - -
All for valour and for honour and a little bit of blue !
Chorus.
Oh get hold of it and shove it!
It is labour, but you love it;
Ict your stroke be long and mighty; keep your body on
the swing; -
While your pulses dance a measure
Full of pride and full of pleasure,
And the boat flies free and joyous like a swallow on the wing.
Isis blessed her noble youngsters as they left her; Father
Camus . -
Sped his youths to fame and Putney from his grey and
ancient Courts:—
“Keep,” they said, “the old traditions, and we know you
will not shame us - .
When you try the stormy tideway in your zephyrs and
your shorts.
“For it's toil and tribulation till your roughnesses are
polished,
And it's bitterness and sorrow till the work of oars is
done;
But it's high delight and triumph when your faults are
all abolished,
With yourself and seven brothers firmly welded into one.”
So they stood the weary trial and the people poured to
greet them,
Filled a cup with praise and welcome—it was theirs to
take and quaff; -
And they ranged their ships alongside, and the umpire
came to meet them,
And they stripped themselves and waited till his pistol
sent them off.
With a dash and spurt and rally; with a swing and drive
and rattle,
Both the boats went flashing faster as they cleft the
swelling stream ;
And the old familiar places, scenes of many a sacred battle,
Just were seen for half a moment and went by them in a
dream.
13ut at last the flag has fallen and the splendid fight is
finished,
And the victory is blazoned on the record-roll of Fame.
They are spent and worn and broken, but their soul is
undiminished;
There are winners now and losers, but their glory is the
same !
Chorus.
Oh get hold of it and shove it!
It is labour, but you love it;
Let your stroke be long and mighty; keep your body on

AT THE PLAY.
“HER SIDE OF THE HOUSE.”
IF I were a Dramatic Censor I should
put my ban on all plays in which the
physical relations of a newly married
pair are discussed. An audience that
is left cold by the most lurid vice may
get very hot and uncomfortable over
certain phases of the domestic virtues,
The vicious people in this rather foolish
play were harmlessly absurd; but about
all the business of a separate establish-
ment for bride and bridegroom there
was an atmosphere of indecency. Not
the robust indecency of a French farce,
but the half-baked sort at which
you are supposed to be free to
snigger because you don't see the
legal tie broken but only vulgar-
ised. There is vulgarity enough
—heaven knows—in a social
system that daily delights in the
public exploitation of a private
sacrament; but the authors of
Her Side of the House do not set
out to satirize this; they are
busied to invent new vulgarities
of their own. º
And a far and fantastic search
they have to make for them.
They shew us a convent-bred
girl for whom her French grand-
mamma arranges a marriage with
an English marquis, neither side
making any profession of love.
He wants her money and she
wants freedom. Not freedom
simply from grandmotherly con-
trol; she has larger notions of
liberty; she wants to experiment
in the meaning of love, of which
her knowledge is pardonably
hazy; and she wants to choose
her own teachers. So she dis-
penses with a honeymoon and
splits up her husband's house into
two parts, one for herself and
her friends, and one for him and
his. They have (I gathered) a “Lounge
Hall,” a billiard-room, and servants'
offices in common; but nothing was said,
I think, about a mutual restaurant.
All this sounds a little licentious,
but it is arranged with a great air of
innocence, as if the girl were dealing
with a doll's house—not, of course, the
IBSEN kind. Once established in “her
side of the house” our ingénue pro-
secutes her studies in the science of
Eros. She is not particular where she
gets her answers to such elementary
questions as “What is passion?”
“What is love?” At one time it is a
former admirer—a very dashing fellow
(in the text)—who conducts her educa-
tion; at another it is a blameless old
manicurist from whom she seeks
enlightenment. Then again she gets
THE “SIDE OF THE House
LIKED TO SEE.
'wrinkles from her husband (when he
pays a call), and from a wicked lady
with a past to draw upon and designs
of her own on the sanctity of this
peculiar home.
But her whole time is not given to
the accumulation of first principles;
incidentally she is drawing compari-
sons between her lover (in theory) and
her husband, in favour of the latter.
How long the process might have con-
tinued I dare not conjecture; but only
a few months had elapsed when one
night, Grandmamma—a very practical
old dowager—put her foot down, took
the heifer, so to say, by the horns, and

locked her out of her side of the house.
A prisoner in the neutral section, with
no way of escape except to the bride-
groom's territory, she overhears (it is
a way she has) a conversation from
which she learns that his lordship,
satisfied that she desires still more ac-
commodation in the matter of freedom,
is prepared, for her benefit (not for his
own, as is apparent from the type that
he proposes to elope with) to clear the
way for his wife to divorce him.
Against such heroism she cannot
remain proof, and falls, experimentally
and without loss of modesty, into his
allins. ... --
I find I have not yet mentioned a
veteran stage-duke (uncle of the bride-
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE
gave expression to them with a candour
that greatly diverted the house. If the
play is saved, the medal must certainly
go to Mr. SPENCER TREvoR, who
brought this relief.
I confess to having felt a little shock
when I saw that Mr. GoDFREY TEARLE
was to be a British marquis; but he
played with a very reticent propriety
and did all that was possible to preserve
the decencies. Miss DULCE MUsgBAve,
who was the bride, has a gentle voice
and, for a débutante, acquitted herself
well. She was natural in her gaiety,
but when she had serious things to say
she was apt to take on the intonation
of the stage, so that you might
- have thought she had been on the
boards for years and years. Miss
HELEN FERRERs as a grande
dame sans merci had no diffi-
culty about keeping in her own
particular groove. Mr. DEAcon
had an ungrateful part to play as
the lover, and lady-killing is not
his métier. As for the villainess,
who stayed on the bride's side
of the house, I think she would
have been more at home on the
Surrey side of the Thames.
It is not a bad fault that Mr.
WoRRALL's ambition should out- |
run his experience. He has a
sense of humour that promises
better things if only he will learn
not to waste it on an artificial
theme. His present play, written
in conjunction with Miss ATTÉ |
HALL, had a flattering welcome
which should not deceive its
authors. In a little speech Mr.
WoRRALL gallantly acknowledged
the help of Miss Rosina FILIPPI
who “produced" him. I hesitate
to criticise the work of so charm-
ing and accomplished an artist;
but it was lucky that the play
attempted no resemblance to
actual life, for any illusion must
have been shattered by the jumpiness of
one or two of the performers. Å. the
first dozen words of a conversation
somebody must needs spring up, prance
round and lean over the back of some
other seat for a sentence or two and
then off again. One neversees any such |
behaviour except on the stage. Is it
done to brighten things up for us? |
It hasn't that effect upon me. On the
contrary, I too grow restive and can ||
scarce restrain myself from getting out
of my seat and climbing all over the
auditorium. l
I think Miss FILIPPI can never have |
felt like that ; but she has imagination |
and will understand, now that I have ||
told her what I suffer. And perhaps,

about this caricature of matrimony and
still. O. S.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
SUBURBAN householders have so many little worries that
they might well be spared the final inconvenience of being
haunted by the spirit of the wicked aristocrat on whose
estate their detached houses have been built. Yet it is to
this that Mr. E. W. HoRNUNG dooms them in Witching Hill
(HopDER AND STOUGHTON). Though a peer of the realm,
Lord Mulcaster had made a perfect baronet of himself, so
bold and bad had he been in the days of the Regency. He
died, but the evil that he did lived after him in the form of
a sort of Influence which so wrought upon the tenants of
the villas in Witching Hill Road and Mulcaster Park that
their characters became completely warped. Religious
tenants took to gambling, engaged tenants toyed with the
idea of murdering their fiancées. Even the Vicar's sister
abandoned parish-magazine fiction and composed a novel
so lurid that the Vicar, after one reading, put the MS. in
the fire. It is an ingenious idea which, like most ideas,
could have been developed in more than one way. To me
it seems an admirable basis for a frolic of the Gilbertian or
Ansteyan. type. Mr. HoRNUNG has preferred to try to
thrill us, and I think he has chosen the more difficult plan.
With such a scheme it would have been easier to amuse.
Nevertheless, if one or two of the stories seem a little mild
and drawn-out, the last but one, “The Locked Room,” is
excellent. Possibly because the adventure happens to the
teller of the story, and not to his rather wooden friend, Uvo
Delavoye (whom, till then, he has allowed to monopolise
the centre of the stage), this particular tale seems more vivid
than the rest.
I have known so long and so well the charm of Miss
ALICE BRowN's art that it is no surprise to me that she
should have written one of the best and freshest child-
stories that I have ever read. The Secret of the Clan
(CoNSTABLE), which will remind you a little of The Golden
Age of Mr. KENNETH GRAHAME, tells the tale of four girls,
most cunningly differentiated, who are allowed by their
adorable lady-guardian to run wild, because if she made
rules they might be broken, and she loved her children
much too well to let them risk the taint of disobedience.
The girls' idea of forming themselves into an imaginary
tribe of Indians, sworn to secrecy, does not pretend to be
novel; the novelty comes when their vows bring them into
unavoidable collision with their gentle guardian. A night
escapade, begun by one of them with the purpose of con-
quering her fear of the dark, gets them into trouble and
requires explanation. Their dear hearts are torn asunder
between the claims of their oath of secrecy and a passion-
ate desire not to hurt their guardian's feelings. The oath
prevails and their lips are sealed, until, after much tribula-
tion, a way is found out compatible with the nicest sense of
honour. A really fascinating book, full of humour and
gentleness and the gayest imagination. And you may
have left your childhood far behind, but that will make no
difference here. New England has no more delightful
writer than Miss ALICE BRowN, and it is a marvel to me
that Old England knows so little of her rare gifts.
Mr. WEEDON GRossMITH carries the happy reader From
Studio to Stage (John LANE) at lilting speed, the journey
enlivened by endless stories perhaps mostly true. Starting
in life he fancied himself as an artist. Here and there in

the volume may be found veiled hints of conviction that
had he stuck to his early love he would have done even
better than on the stage, where he has managed pretty well.
As is commonly the case in biographies and autobiographies
the most interesting passages are found in the opening
chapters. Charm is increased by the cynical frankness
with which the author exposes his alleged weaknesses and
jots down his indiscretions. I fancy WEEDON was not
such a sad young dog as he paints himself. Did he really,
as is narrated in the chapter suggestively entitled “Fast
Life in London,” help “Tottie" FAY into a cab at the solemn
hour of midnight and recklessly pay her fare to Highgate?
I trow not. The difficulty graphically portrayed is sus-
piciously suggestive of more remunerative embarrassment
that came to him later in life in consequence of a super-
fluity of (stage) babies. All the same, it is a funny story,
admirably told. Another confidence reveals his youthful
engagement to a lady whom he describes as “considerably
older than myself, even less attractive, who had a very
Wrong people and thereby damn it for ever in the eyes of
the Right. But for some accidents of love, this is what
would have happened to Miss Valentine; not all her energy
and enthusiasm could have saved the Pageant, if certain
things had not happened. What these were, and the charm
and humour and even pathos of their telling, you must
discover unaided by me. If a fraction only of the late
adherents of Mr. Louis PARKER and Mr. FRANK LAscELLEs
purchase this book and enjoy it (as they must), its success
is certain.
I opened The Only Prison (John LoNG) with some vague
expectation that Miss ELLEN ADA SMITH might be found
to have provided a fresh solution for the problem of the
Suffragettes. Of course I was disappointed. Her novel is
really a variation upon an old theme—and one in which I
have always resolutely declined to believe—the man who
takes credit and reward for the literary work of another.
It is only fair to add at once that Miss SMITH has provided
substantial income.” At
this time his balance at
the bank stood at £6 10s.,
while his liabilities
amounted to over £700.
Something must be done.
So he seriously contem-
plated marriage, to which
end the lady was obviously
disposed. At the last mo-
ment courage forsook him
and he bolted. His experi-
ences as actor and mana-
ger, with vivid peeps be-
hind the scenes at Drury
Lane and elsewhere, sup-
ply racy material for the
story of a strenuous life,
frankly told, liberally
spiced with the precious
salt of humour. As colla-
complications that add
greatly to the interest of
the main situation, if not
to its inherent probability.
Thus, before Henry Agar
came to prosper feloni-
ously on the renown and
royalties that were actually
earned by Mary Dormafield,
he had saved her life in a
railway accident at the
peril of his own, and could
in this way persuade him-
self that he had a kind of
moral claim upon the re-
sults of her preservation.
That is one excellent new
point. Another is that he
was at the time sacrificing
personal comfort in order
to keep alive a very un-
borator with his brother

s MITH has countless
friends and admirers
among readers of I’unch
who do not forget “The
Diary of a Nobody.” WEEdoN is Somebody. Nevertheless
his actual Diary is scarcely less delightful than the other.
st'RE HE was NoT THE AGGREssoR.''
I have been awaiting it this great while—a really good
story that should make use of the Pageant, as lately to be
observed in the rural districts of England. Happily, now
that it has come, it proves quite worth the waiting; its
name is New Wine and Old Bottles (FISHER UNwiN), and it
is written by Miss CoNSTANCE SMEDLEY. If this lady does
not know her theme from intimate observation, I am no
judge; certainly the humour and trials and rewards of the
pageant-period could hardly have been better realized.
You see the plot in the title. Scrooge, that somnolent
little Cotswold town, was the old bottle, into which the
arrival of energetic but charming Miss Valentine, straight
from a Florentine villa, poured new wine with the most
devastating results. Miss Valentine, looking about her on
a fair prospect marred by apathy and local feuds, was
inspired with the idea of a Pageant that should unite and
quicken all the sluggish life of Scrooge. She did not know
(as Miss SMEDLEY and I know too well), first, that new-
comers have no business with inspirations; secondly, that
nothing is more fatal than to impart such a scheme to the

interesting wife at Davos.
So altogether there was
something to be said for
Agar. What was said,
when the inevitable expo-
sure came; what Mary did,
and how it allended, you shall find for yourself. The book is
well enough written to give interest to the process, though
I believe that the author will do better work yet. Upon
one small point however I most vehemently join issue with
her. This is the manner in which she bases Agar's success
at the Bar upon the reputation of his supposed skill as a
novelist. I should like counsel's opinion upon that I

“THE LONDON LOOK.”
[To a lady just returned from six years in Canada, who writes to
The Chronicle to say that she notices “a difference that has taken
place in Londoners” during her absence. “Coming from a land full
of hope and promise for the future,” she has been forcibly struck by
“the sad and hopeless expression worn by the average Londoner.”] .
FROM regions of the Golden West, . .
The promised land of boundless prairie,
Where if you do but scratch the soil
- At once it teems with corn and oil,
And Labour goes to work (or rest)
Light-footed as a fairy;-
Land of the well-known Maple-leaf,
Where legs are lithe and muscles limber,
Where no one yet was heard to sigh,
But all men wear a glad, glad eye
That comes of canning fruits and beef
And logging virgin timber;--
Where rolls of greenbacks, rolls and rolls,
Drop from the trees (just like Utopia);
Where Fortune smiles without a break,
And all the world is on the make
And carries in its button-holes
A blooming cornucopia;-
From that Elysium homeward borne,
You find yourself completely staggered,
Treading once more our London ways,
To note the contrast she betrays,
The dull despair of lips forlorn,
Of eyes how strangely haggard
You say you can't account for this.
Six summers back you left us cheery;
Contentment sat on every brow
Six little summers back, and now
You see the same Metropolis
Hopelessly dull and dreary.
Blithe as a bird that scales the sky, -
That day, when you and London parted,
We went about as though on air, * ,
Carolling lightly here and there.

Why are we so downhearted 2
Madam, we thank your fresher eyes " . . .
Through which we pierce the humorous vapour
That screens us from ourselves, and find
How changed we are; but was it kind
To send the news of your surprise

THE CHRISTENING OF CANBERRA.
GREAT satisfaction is expressed amongst patriotic Aus-
tralians that the Federal Government should have reso-
lutely refused to emphasize the historical or personal
associations of their country with the Mother-country, and
have decided instead to call their capital, Canberra—a name
which is at once Australian, indigenous and aboriginal.
In view of the epoch-making nature of the event, we have
invited the opinions of a number of leading patriots,
scholars and littérateurs on the choice. - *
Mr. P. F. WARNER writes: “While disclaiming any right
to dictate to the Commonwealth Government in this
matter, I cannot help regretting that they have not seen
their way to commemorate the greatest of all Australian |
products—cricket. For my own part, I have never dis-
guised my belief that the best name for the new capital
would be Trumpersville, though I admit that Spofforths-
town has much to recommend it.” - * ,
Mr. EDMUND GossE writes: “As the most intimate
living friend of Robert BRowNING, FitzgerALD, GEorge
MEREDITH and TENNYSON, may I be permitted to express my
regret that the claims of none of these great men have
been regarded in the nomenclature of the new Australian
capital 2" - - * .
Mr. P. A. VAILE, the great lawn tennis and golf expert
and author of Wake up, England, though himself a New
Zealander, takes a keen interest in Australian politics. He
writes: “The Australians have missed a great opportunity.
They should have called their capital Boomeranga, or,
perhaps, Bouméringue, in memory of the famous aboriginal
missile which, when all is said and done, is the outstanding
contribution of Australia to the inventions of the world.
I may add that I have for many years been engaged in
researches into the flight of the boomerang; in which the
antagonism of topspin and undercut is reduced to a perfect
harmony, and hope soon to publish them in a definitive
monograph.” ** - - - - - - - - -
Sir GEoRGE BIRDwood writes: “Inasmuch as philologists
trace the derivation of the word to an aboriginal perversion
of ‘Cranberry,' a fruit which grows in great luxuriance on
the spot, I can only say that I prefer it to Wallaby, Wattle-
ton or Federalia.” - -
Mr. Thomas BEECHAM expresses regret, on the grounds
of euphony, that the more melodious name of Myola was
not chosen. “The termination -ola,” he observes, “is con-
secrated to music—e.g., viola, pianola-though an excep-
tion must be made in the case of Gorgonzola — and
naturally appeals with peculiar force to all persons of an
Lord CourTNEY of PENwitH writes: “I must confess to
a bitter disappointment that the name which I suggested,
viz. Proportionalia, with a view to celebrating the triumph
of proportional representation, did not even achieve the
distinction of serious consideration. I cannot profess en-
thusiasm for Canberra, but it is a great relief to me per-
sonally that Venus was not selected.” - -
Sir Edwin DURNING-LAw REN cº, writes: “The only
redeeming feature of the situation is the negative one that
the name Shakspeare was rejected. For the Common-
wealth to link its lot with the arch-impostor would have
been a cosmic catastrophe.”
The latest projected alliance between the Peerage and the
Music Hall Stage is indicated by the following significant
“exchange” advertisement in The Motor Cycle:–
“Excellent Coronet and Banjo, each in case, for good side-car.”

(Old Gentleman retires indoors to think it out.)
CRICKET REFORM.
IT is becoming more and more evi-
dent that something must be done to
“brighten cricket.” We have listened
patiently to the many helpful proposals
that have appeared in the Press in the
last few weeks and given them our
most thoughtful consideration, and we
feel that now our turn has come.
It has been suggested in some quar-
ters that spectators should be admitted
free for the last hour's play of the day.
That seems to us a very happy idea,
and one which might be carried a good
deal further. It is generally conceded
that the game cannot exist without
spectators. (It is not as if the players
were doing it purely for the fun of the
thing) . Well, why not admit all spec-
tators free? A much larger crowd
could then be confidently counted upon.
We shall be told, of course, that the
club's finances would suffer from such
open-handed treatment. But we have
not overlooked that difficulty. It could
be met by making a small charge—of
perhaps a shilling a head—“upon re-
tiring,” that is to say, as they go out.
The necessity for a band has been
very generally insisted upon, and quite
rightly. But it is ridiculous to suppose
that every member of the crowd is
interested in music. And if nothing
more than this is to be done it is clear
that the great majority will be reduced
to looking on at the cricket after all.
The band must be supplemented by
other attractions. A few simple side-
shows would do much—a picture palace
perhaps at each corner of the ground,
some pierrots, an Aunt Sally or two, and,
let us say, a joy-wheel would probably
be found quite sufficient, for ours is
ever a good-humoured crowd. The pro-
gramme would, of course, have to be
changed, say, twice a week, and to meet
this need every touring eleven might
carry with it its own little troupe of
itinerant artists. Lancashire would
bring its clog-dancers, Somerset its team
of wrestlers, and local talent would be
encouraged in every possible way. On
the more special occasions (that is to
say, when the match itself is more than
usually dull), pageants illustrating the
development of the game from pre-his-
toric times might parade the ground.
Again, all are agreed that there is too
much cricket. For this a simple remedy
could be found. Why not have a
season with no cricket at all? It
might foster appetite.
As to alterations in the actual rules
of the game, we feel a little diffident in
putting forth our views, for one of the
very highest authorities has just told
us that what cricket really wants is
“ten years of sober government and
freedom from scares and criticisms.” It
is not that we are without happy ideas
on this subject. We still believe that
our notion of making the wicket so
wide that the ball on occasion would
pass between the stumps is really a
capital one, and would add quite a
sporting new element to the relations
between batsman and bowler. And
our own special reform—the corrugated
pitch—would without doubt introduce
many bright and amusing episodes.
But even if we may not tamper with
the rules something can surely be done
to improve cricket as a spectacle.
Whatever other attractions we are able
to provide there must always be a few
members of the crowd, old sportsmen

of the bull-dog breed, who are there to
see the game. Can we do nothing to
relieve the monotony for them 2 At
least the players might adopt the very
obvious expedient of fancy dress, and
it would be a pity not to make use of
the umpires in the same way. At
present they add little or nothing to
the spectacular effect.
And now we come to the final reflec-
tion that there may be no need, after
all, to take any steps to brighten cricket.
The problem may solve itself. When
we consider all that the W.S.P.U. has
done in the last few months to
brighten golf, surely there is no
need to despair.
THE SPORTSMAN.
ALFRED BINKs PRossER was
enjoying himself immensely.
He was seated in a covered
stand, while outside, in the
drizzling rain so characteristic
of an English spring, the Port-
hampton “Yellow hammers”
and the Ringsley “Lobsters”
manoeuvred a heavy football
over a large area of watery mud
dotted here and there with pools
of muddy water. A big button
of brown and yellow—the Port-
hampton colours—was in his
coat, and a gilt tie-pin made in
the shape of a hammer also
neatly indicated on which side
his sympathies lay.
The “Yellowhammers ” were
leading by one goal to nil, and
Alfred experienced a satisfying
sense of having done his best to
bring about this result. He had
cheered his own men through
fair play and foul, and had con-
sistently booed their opponents.
He had also shouted a great
many pertinent exhortations,
was forty-six. But it was not merely
territorial enthusiasm which inspired
him, and as the band floundered pre-
cariously out into the open he took a
bundle of papers from his pocket and
reviewed his position.
To Mr. Jim Blow, of Lucerne,
Switzerland, he had sent a postal
order for 10s. and various forecasts of
football results. If all these forecasts
proved correct he would win £12 10s.
Among them he had given Porthampton
to win.

º
foot with vexation. He remembered
now what up to this moment he had
utterly forgotten. Just as he had been
on the point of crossing out Ringsley
on the Whispers coupon a few days
before, some obscure instinct had
prompted him to stay his hand, and
he had given the result a draw
Four pounds a week for life! He
dropped the tie-pin and the button into
his pocket and went out for a breather.
When he sat down again it was in
another part of the stand.
Here for some time he urged on the
efforts of the “Lobsters ” with
the utmost zeal, completely
putting to shame a small group
of Ringsleyites near him. Then
at last the ball flashed into the
“Yellowhammers’ ” net and
made the scores level, and he
gave a long sigh of relief as he
watched the goal-keeper pick
himself up and scrape the mud
out of his mouth.
Minute after minute passed
without any further score, and
Alfred now sat unwontedly
quiet, feeling more and more
certain of his £4 a week. But
five minutes from time the
“Yellowhammers” seemed sud-
denly to develop a fresh access
of energy. They began to press
strongly; and in spite of himself,
in defiance of all reason, Alfred
found himself becoming wildly
|excited on their behalf. Fight
| against it as he would, there
2 surged into his breast a mad,
|illogical, but sporting hope that
| Porthampton might win.
A minute from time the
“Yellowhammers’ ” centre-for-
ward found the ball at his feet
about forty yards from the
Ringsley goal. Alfred yelled
piercingly, “Shoot, you silly
fool! Shoot l” The centre did
such as “Play the game, Ref. 1"
“Pull your socks up, Ref.!” “Go and
buy a pair of specs, Ref." Indeed
his advice to the Referee must have
been a great help to that harassed
official. In addition to all this he had
indulged in a spirited verbal skirmish
with an excited Ringsleyite, and had
wittily advised him to swallow a
sponge if he couldn't spleak splain for
splutterin'.
Altogether, except for a natural and
! ludable hoarseness, Alfred felt at the
top of his form when the whistle went
for half-time.
He had long supported the “Yellow-
hammers’’ for the excellent reason that
their ground was situated but twenty-
two miles by rail from his home, while
that of the only other professional club
within reach on a Saturday afternoon
Switzerland, he might similarly expect
to receive £25 if all his predictions were
successful; and among them he had
given Porthampton to win.
In the weekly Football Competition
organised by Trifles, which offered a
prize of £100 for a correct forecast of
the results of twenty-four selected
matches, he had given Porthampton
to win.
In a parallel Competition arranged
by Masses Weekly for a prize of £200,
he had given Porthampton to win.
In the Competition announced by
Piffling Pars, which offered a prize of
£500 on the same terms, he had given
Porthampton to win.
Likewise in the Whispers Competi-
tion for £4 a week for life But stay !
What was this 2
not shoot, but swung the ball to the
outside right. Alfred rose to his feet
and waved his arms. The outside man
raced along the touch-line and lofted the
ball towards the goal-mouth. Alfred
stamped on the boards and bawled
incoherently. The inside right slid
forward, and with a quick jerk of his
head sent the ball flying into a top
corner of the net. Alfred brought down
both his fists with a crash upon the
bowler hat of the man in front of
him, and with a thrill of pure, un-
hesitating, rapturous triumph screamed
“GOAL | * -
At the risk of losing £208 a year for
life, Alfred Binks Prosser had shown
himself a sportsman. . . . Nor, since
his other predictions were all wrong,
Alfred stamped his did he ever have cause to regret it.

IT was a wonderful Spring after-
noon. I’erambulators blossomed on the
| Heath, boy scouts burgeoned into scout-
| masters, crocodiles had come out of their
lairs. On every side of me young male
shop-assistants walked and whispered
honeyed nothings into the shell-like
ears of young female dittos.. I only was
| sad. This was because of a little ex-
planation I had had with Araminta just
after lunch. I was rather pleased than
otherwise when she said to me, “Of
course you remembered to buy that
foolscap this morning?” because it gave
me a chance to expound to her the
principle on which I regulate the petty
details of everyday life. It is a fixed
idea with Araminta that I am slightly
careless and unmethodical. Nothing
could be further from the truth. So I
said, “No," and at the same time smiled
sardonically. (An article on sardonic
smiles, illustrated by photographs of
the faces of Cabinet Ministers smiling
them, will be found on some other page
of some other paper.) After I had got
this over and my mouth had resumed
its normal footing, Araminta, looking
slightly relieved, went on. “But you
|said you simply must have it to-night,”
--
she murmured reproachfully, “and some
bootlaces and dog biscuits—"
“Araminta,” I broke in, “civilization
is a lethargic monotony. We are both
lotus-eaters; so is the dog. Constant
supplies of little luxuries lie round
about our door x -
“Not unless you order them
the morning.”
“— lie, I should rather say, behind
the counters of the little shops at the
end of the street. Why should I get
these things an instant before they are
absolutely needed? If it is at all pos-
sible to infuse any flavour of romance
into our swathed and padded existence,
it can only be done by waiting until
the last possible chance, and then sally-
ing forth like a relief expedition and
buying boot-powder, tooth-laces, seal-
ing-biscuits and dog-wax at the psycho-
logical moment when failure to procure
them would bring the violf to the door.
In all good stories of desert islands it
is just when the dishevelled mariner
despairs of being able to cook the yams
or iguanas which he has been lassoing
all morning with his neck-tie that the
bale of hermetically-sealed pine-vestas
is washed ashore from the wreck. So
it is with me. It is quite true that I
have been longing for foolscap, not to
up in
speak of various other what-nots. It
is quite true that I must have them
this evenin py
“Isn't it better?" began Araminta,
seizing a moment when I stopped for
breath— -
“No, it is not better to have them
always in stock. That is your method,
but not mine. In a few moments I
shall issue forth and pay a visit to the
stationer; from him I shall go on to the
biscuit-monger and the bootwright and
come back hung all over with little
parcels like the good St. Nicholas.
Your ideal, it seems, is the Garden
of Alcinous, where the greengroceries
never run out. Mine is the date-palm
of the oasis which greets the eye of the
thirsty Bedouin, now at his last gasp.
Such is romance.”
So saying, and before Araminta had
time to recover from her bewilderment,
I clapped my plum-coloured Carlsbad
on my head and went out.
As I said before, all nature was
smiling. Shop-assistants cooed of love.
It was then that I became suddenly sad.
I should not have minded about nature;
it was the shop-assistants who worried
me. I realised almost at once that it
was Thursday afternoon; and Thursday
is our early-closing day.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER.
REALLY I know nothing aboutflowers.
By a bit of luck, James, my gardener,
whom I pay half-a-crown a week for
combing the beds, knows nothing
about them either; so my ignorance
remains undiscovered. But in other
people's gardens I have to make
something of an effort to keep up
appearances. Without flattering my-
self I may say that I have acquired a
certain manner; I give the impression
of the garden lover, or the man with
shares in a seed-company, or—or some-
thing. º
For instance, at Creek Cottage, Mrs.
Atherley will say to me, “That's an
Amphilobertus Gemini,” pointing to
something which I hadn't noticed be-
hind a rake.
“I am not a bit surprised,” I say
calmly. º :
"And a Gladiophinium Banksii next
to it.” -
“I suspected it,” I confess in a hoarse
whisper. … -
Towards flowers whose names I
know I adopt a different tone.
“Aren't you surprised to see daffodils
out so early 2” says Mrs. Atherley
with pride.
“There are lots out in London,” I
mention casually. “In the shops.”
“So there are grapes,” says Miss
Atherley. -
“I was not talking about grapes,” I
reply stiffly.
However at Creek Cottage just now
I can afford to be natural; for it is not
gardening which comes under discussion
these days, but landscape-gardening,
and anyone can be an authority on
that. The Atherleys, fired by my tales
of Sandringham, Chatsworth, Arundel,
and other places where I am constantly
spending the week-end, are re-adjusting
their two-acre field. In future it will
not be called “the garden" but “the
grounds.” -
I was privileged to be shown over
the grounds on my last visit to Creek
Cottage.
“Here,” said Mrs. Atherley, “we are
having a plantation. It will keep the
wind off; and we shall often sit here
in the early days of summer. That's
a weeping ash in the middle. There's
another one over there. They'll be
lovely, you know.” - -
“What's that ?” I asked, pointing
to a bit of black stick on the left ;
which, even more than the other trees,
gave the impression of having been left
| there by the gardener while he went
for his lunch.
“That's a weeping willow.”
“This is rather a tearful corner of
the grounds,” apologised Miss Atherley.
“We'll show you something brighter
directly. Look there—that's the oak
in which KING CHARLEs lay hid. At
least, it will be when it's grown a
bit.”
“Ilet's go on to the shrubbery,”
said Mrs. Atherley. “We are having
a new grass path from here to the
shrubbery. It's going to be called
Henry's Walk.”
Miss Atherley has a small brother
called Henry. Also there were eight
Kings of England called Henry. Many
a time and oft one of those nine Henry's
has paced up and down this grassy
walk, his head bent, his hands clasped
behind his back; while behind his
furrowed brow, who shall say what
world-schemes were hatching? Is it
the thought of Wolsey which makes
him frown—or is he wondering where
he left his catapult 2 Ah! who can
tell us? Let us leave a veil of mystery
over it . . . for the sake of the next
visitor. * * *
“The shrubbery,” said Mrs. Atherley
proudly, waving her hand at a couple
of laurel bushes and a-I've forgotten
its name now, but it is one of the few
shrubs I really know.
“And if you're a gentleman,” said
Miss Atherley, “and want to get asked
here again, you'll always call it the
shrubbery.”
“Really, I don't see what else you
could call it,” I said, wishing to be
asked down again.
“The patch.”
“True,” I said. “I mean, Nonsense.”
I was rather late for breakfast next
morning; a pity on such a lovely spring
dav. -
*I'm so sorry,” I began, “but I
was looking at the shrubbery from my
window and I quite forgot the time.”
“Good,” said Miss Atherley.
“I must thank you for putting me
in such a perfect room for it,” I went
on, warming to my subject. “One can
actually see the shrubs—er—shrubbing.
The plantation too seems a little thicker
to me than yesterday.”
“I expect it is.”
“In fact, the tennis lawn ” I
looked round anxiously. I had a sudden
fear that it might be the new deer-park.
“It still is the tennis lawn 2" I asked.
“Yes. Why, what about it?”
“I was only going to say the tennis
lawn had quite a lot of shadows on it.
Oh, there's no doubt that the planta-
tion is really asserting itself.” -
Eleven o'clock found me strolling in
the grounds with Miss Atherley.
“You know,” I said, as we paced
Henry's Walk together, “the one thing
the plantation wants is for a bird to
nest in it. That is the hall-mark of a
plantation.”
“It's Mother's birthday to-morrow.
Wouldn't it be a lovely surprise for
her 2 ''
“It would, indeed. Unfortunately
this is a matter in which you require
the co-operation of a feathered friend.”
“Couldn't you try to persuade a
bird to build a nest in the weeping
ash 2 Just for this once?”
“You’re asking me a very difficult
thing,” I said doubtfully. “Anything
else I would do cheerfully for you;
but to dictate to a bird on such a very
domestic affair No, I'm afraid I
must refuse.”
“It need only just begin to build
one,” pleaded Miss Atherley, “because
Mother 's going up to town by your
train to-morrow. As soon as she's out
of the house the bird can go back to
anywhere else it likes better.””
“I will put that to any bird I see
to-day,” I said, “but I am doubtful.”
“Oh, well,” sighed Miss Atherley;
“never mind.”

“What do you think?” cried Mrs.
Atherley as she came in to breakfast
next day. “There's a bird been nesting
in the plantation 1"
Miss Atherley looked at me in undis-
guised admiration. I looked quite sur-
prised—I know I did.
“Well, well !” I said.
“You must come out afterwards and
see the nest and tell me what bird it
is. There are three eggs in it. I am
afraid I don't know much about these
things.”
“I’m glad,” I said thankfully.
mean, I shall be glad to.”
We went out eagerly after breakfast.
On about the only tree in the plantation
with a fork to it a nest balanced pre-
cariously. It had in it three pale-blue
eggs splotched with light-brown. It
appeared to be a blackbird's nest with
another egg or two to come.
“It's been very quick about it,” said
Miss Atherley.
“Of our feathered bipeds,” I said,
frowning at her, “the blackbird is
notoriously the most hasty.”
“Isn't it lovely?” said Mrs. Atherley.
She was still talking about it as she
climbed into the trap which was to take
us to the station.
“One moment,” I said, “I’ve for-
gotten something.” I dashed into the
house and out by a side door, and then
sprinted for the plantation. I took
the nest from the weeping and over-
weighted ash and put it carefully
back in the hedge by the tennis-
lawn. Then I returned more leisurely
to the house.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, March
10.--La Session est morte.
Session /
Death happened last Friday. New
birth dates from to-day. House, in fact,
has enjoyed exhilarating recess of two
days, one being Sunday, the other in-
cluding usual Saturday half-holiday.
Reasonable to expect in such circum-
stances that legislators who for thirteen
months have had their noses in uncom-
fortable proximity to Parliamentary
grindstone would come back browned
by exposure to occasional rain, brimful
the Commons. Come here and find
my old friend, his father, moving
Address in Lords.”
Young M'LAREN, gifted with a fine
Vive la voice, accomplished in elocution, ac-
quitted himself in manner that drew
frequent cheers from both sides. Only
threatened note of discord was struck
by opening sentence, when he described
himself as the youngest Member on
Ministerial side. WEDGwooD BENN,
seated Gangway end of Treasury Bench,
obviously thought remark superfluous.
Accustomed to have that distinction
attributed to him—he never assumes
anything for himself—naturally did not
like to hear it claimed by another.
of health and spirits, eager to buckle- Made movement as if about to rise and
to at business of fresh
session. On the con-
trary, gathering in both
Houses unprecedent-
edly small, deplorably
depressed.
Noble Lords, whose
business aptitude is well
known, having listened
to speeches from mover
and seconder of Address,
Leader of Opposition
and Leader of House,
straightway agreed, and
went off to dinner on
stroke of half-past
seven. The Commons,
faced by necessity of
working double tides
in order to meet exi-
gencies of financial
year, which closes on
31st, could not stand
things later than nine
minutes to eight, at
which precise moment
a dwindling gathering
dispersed. But they
did not confirm Address, over which
talk will simmer for rest of the week.
When limit of Ministerial patience is
reached there will be loud complaints
of tyrannical shortening of debate.
And here, on very first night of Session,
something like half a sitting is wantonly
chucked away.
The MEMBER for SARK, looking in at
House of Lords, found ABERCONway
on his legs, moving Address with
successful observance of consecrated
custom by which original thought or
independent criticism is regarded as
undesirable. Afraid worry and weari-
ness of long Session have told upon a
disposition naturally kind, peculiarly
sweet. SARK certainly grumpy.
“Seems to me,” he growled, “Parlia-
ment is being run strictly on family
lines. Just heard FRANcis M'LAREN
arrayed in velvet and fine linen make
neat little speech seconding Address in
MORE BANBURY SENSATIONS.
enter protest. Fortunately BANBURY,
sitting next to him, quickly discerned
situation and laid restraining hand on
the Cherub's shoulder, and what for
half a minute threatened an unpleasant
scene passed over.
BANBURY's appearance on Treasury
Bench created consternation in Strang-
ers' Gallery. Rumour ran round as-
serting that he had “been bought.”
Various surmises as to particular price
extorted for so great a possession.
Some said he had ousted LLoyd
GEORGE from the Exchequer. Others
affirmed that, at ten minutes' notice, he
had undertaken care of the Navy, vice
WINSTON, about to be elevated to the
House of Lords. Absence of McKENNA
from Treasury Bench being noticed, it
was thought that BANBURY had ac-
cepted the Home Secretaryship and
that Suffragettes had better look out.
Simple fact is that, in accordance
with ancient tradition, the MEMBER For
THE CITY OF LONDON has a place found
for him on Ministerial, Bench on open-
ing night of new Parliament. PRINCE
ARTHUR doesn't hanker after privilege.
But BANBURY, wrestling with native
modesty, takes the prominent place,
enlarging the bounds of precedent to
include the third Session.
Reference in Speech from the Throne
to anniversary of KING Edward's
wedding-day stirred up memories of
fifty years ago in bosom of young
M“LAREN. “We are,” he said, “all
delighted to be reminded of those days
long ago when QUEEN ALEXANDRA came
in the Spring as a bride to London.”
Business done.—Parliament meets for
third Session.

like about Rowland
HUNT is his thorough-
ness. Time flies so
rapidly, events crowd
upon each other with
such bewildering in-
sistence, that his first
Parliamentary achieve-
ment is forgotten. Two
years ago young bloods
of Unionist party, con-
vinced that “Arthur is
played out,” succeeded
in relieving him of cares
of Leadership. Have
since from time to time
had occasion to medi-
tate upon sagacity of
the move. It was Row-
LAND HUNT who first
raised standard of revolt.
Declared from his place
behind Front Opposi-
tion Bench that he had
no confidence in his
nominal Leader.
This too much even for cynical in-
difference of PRINCE ARTHUR. Decided
that if someone must go he was not the
man to budge. Accordingly Rowland
was drummed out of regiment, Party
whips being no longer sent to him.
By-and-by he came to heel again, and
has since reserved his gift of denuncia-
tion for more legitimate objects on
t’ other side of the table.
Still in his ashes lives their wonted
fire. Amendments to Address touching
on most of conceivable topics have
through the week crowded the paper.
For the most part lengthy in phrase,
rambling in argument, they excited no
interest. Such as have been submitted
have not succeeded in drawing an audi-
ence appreciably exceeding a quorum.
Then comes Row1AND, effectively bring-
ing up the rear with an amendment
whose comprehensiveness encircles the
globe.

He proposed to ask the House to
approach the Sovereign with expression
of regret “that Your Majesty's Govern-
ment have failed to provide sufficient
forces on sea or land or in the air for
preserving the safety of the country
and the Empire.”
Omission of reference to the waters
under the earth seems to imply excep-
tional satisfaction with the submarine
flotilla. Unfortunately the Amendment,
standing at end of long list, was not
reached, and conjecture on this point
lacks support or dismissal by explana-
tion. 'Twill serve as it stood. When
mighty intellect has bent itself to con-
sideration of vital issues on land and
sea and in the air, what is happening in
the deep unfathomed caves of ocean

of Second Chamber, be left for consider-
ation at a later unnamed date.
Business dome.-After five days' dreary
debate in House rarely half full, Address
agreed to. Main interest centres in
fact that at opening of new Session
Ministerial majority was maintained at
or about the round 100.

AT THE PLAY.
“OPEN WINDOWS.”
WHETHER or not Mr. MAsoN, when
he is out to write one of his pleasant
books, is apt to look at real life too
much through the eyes of a teller of
tales with whom the story comes first
and humanity second, it is certain that
his new play betrays the hand of the
novelist. He seemed to treat his audi-
ence as if they were readers of a serial
of which they had had the misfortune
to miss the first twenty chapters, and
needed a résumé of the foregoing argu-
ment. Unhappily, the necessary reve-
lations had to be made by word of
mouth, and required a very delicate
diplomacy, and this took up practically
*Masº. -

“Your request that I should hand your
daughter over to you is couched in very
unusual terms. You say nothing about ‘the
paternal instinct.'”
the whole of the First Act, and even
then they were none too clear. But
this wouldn't have mattered much if
Mr. MASON, in his anxiety to be done
with his preliminary chapters, had not
been tempted to ignore theimprobability
of some of the conditions under which
he made his précis. Thus for the pur-
poses of his play he has somehow to
impart to us the chequered career of
Philip Brook, who under this assumed
name is acting as secretary to Sir
Henry Cluffe; and how does he do it?
Scarcely has John IIerrick (Home
Secretary) set foot for the first time in
Sir Henry's country house on a week-
end visit, when his host says to him in
so many words: “I have a secretary
who has by heart the matter of the
Bill which you want to discuss; but if
you knew all that I know of his past—
how he said he had climbed Mount
w
Everest when he hadn't—you might
not care to have anything to do with
him. I will therefore proceed to tell
you the facts, and you shall decide for
yourself.” Now Sir Henry was under
no sort of obligation to Herrick to tell
him Brook's secret, which could not
conceivably affect the value of his
political advice; but he must have
been under a good deal of obligation
to Brook himself not to tell it. Such,
however, are the exigencies of drama
without a chorus when you cut out the
first eighteen years of your story.
However, on the whole, Mr. MAsoN
coped very adroitly, not only with the
technical difficulties involved in our
enlightenment, but with the task of
making us realize a tragedy of whose
remote origin we had to learn by
report. Perhaps he would have done
better still to have sacrificed one of the
unities, as he did in The Witness fo
the Defence, where he shewed before
our cyes, in that most effective First
Act, the source of all the subsequent
trouble.
Signs were not wanting (as they say)
that he has been studying other dra-
matic conventions besides the unities.
His stage-irony was very pronounced.
When Lady Cluffe went out of her way
to wonder how Herrick, minion of
fortune, would conduct himself in adver-
sity, even the most childlike of us
looked knowingly up to the blue sky
in absolute confidence that a bolt would
presently emerge,
But there was one convention which
rather irritated me. Eighteen years or
so before the curtain rose, Brook had
passed a “riotous" week with his lover
in Fontainebleau (I give the epithet
which she employed when relieving
her husband's curiosity about this pre-
nuptial episode). Being too poor to
marry her, and, I dare say, too much
pressed for time (for his ship had
already started from Tilbury), Brook
went on to Marseilles to join an ex-
ploration party bound for the Hima-
layas. It was to secure a name for the
child of this union that the lady
hurriedly married the unsuspecting
Herrick. But not once, apparently,
during the three years of his time in
the East did it occur to Brook that
there could be any question of a child.
Yet he was not without imagination, as
shown in the matter of Mount Everest.
Mr. SYDNEY WALENTINE, who took the
part of Brook, recognised that a man
who is in revolt against life is seldom a
very lovable personality; and he did his
best (which can be very good) to dis-
courage sympathy. On the other hand,
sympathy was invited by the lady, very
attractively played by Miss IRENE WAN-
BRUGH. And I might have been quite

thrill that ran through the theatre on
the butler's announcement that Sir
GEORGE ALEXANDER was about to make
his first entry. I refer to the moment
when Herrick summoned Brook to his
room and the presence of his wife. The
audience was palpably intrigued. Yet
the scene when they met was not very
moving. After all they had no quarrel.
Neither had wronged the other. The
real wrong done was by the wife to the
husband, and she remained a silent

grace and sweetness imposed silence
upon both her fathers—actual and
adoptive.
Mr. MAsoN's theme did not make for
hilarity, but I think he might still have
given us more to laugh about, though
I grant that his one joke was quite
good. I omit, from sheer sense of tact,
to mention the unrehearsed humours of
a certain deciduous moustache, which
went far to relieve the strain of the
Second Act. The gay girlishness of
Elsie (very prettily played by Miss
Rosalie ToI.LER) brought relief, but
tempered by the reflection that she
was the very centre round which the
tragedy turned.
The acting throughout was sound,
but it revealed no very new talent and
added little to established reputations.
In conclusion you may want to know
what the “Open Windows” were for,
and what they opened on. I think they
had something to do with sanitation;
and I know they had nothing to do
with KEATs. I have an impression
that they were first mentioned in con-
nection with Norwood; and there, of
course, the view from them may well
have been “forloin "; but not over
“faerie lands.” O. S.

THE SOFA-DOG.
“NAUGHTY dog,” said Francesca—she was addressing,
not me, but the Great Dane—“you have been on the sof,
again.”
"... Well,” I said, “he's off it now. As soon as he heard
your fairy footsteps in the passage he began to slink off.
It's quite wonderful what an ear dogs have for footsteps.”
“He’s a very wicked dog,” said Francesca.
“No, no! He thinks it's a trick. He's got it into his
head that you'd be bitterly disappointed if he didn't get on
to the sofa when you're not in the room and get off it as
soon as he hears you coming. Just you try him. Go into
the passage. There! He's up again. Rnock at the door.
Didn't I tell you? Isn't he the quickest mover out of a
sofa you ever saw 2 Oh, good dog, good dog!”
“Sofas,” said Francesca, “are not meant for dogs. You
encourage him to spoil them. You never think of the covers
he ruins.”
“Oh, yes,” I said, “I do. I know the covers by heart.
Let me tell you what they are. There are two brown
herons apparently feasting on red azaleas, blue convol-
vuluses (or convolvuli, if you prefer it) and yellow melons.
It is an intricate and beautiful picture of heron-life, when
the world was a younger and a better place.”
“It was not designed for dogs,” she said.
“There,” I said, “you go again. For my part, I believe
the inventor intended his pattern to be completed by a dog.
It was his last picture. He had meant to weave in a dog
somewhere, but death came upon him before he had time.
‘Put a dog with the herons,’ he murmured with his last
breath, but they did not understand him. And now this
dumb animal of ours takes up a great artist's thought and
completes it.”
“Covers it with mud,” she said.
“Completes it,” I repeated. “That dog teaches us all a
lesson. Francesca, do you know who said that 2"
“Yes,” she said, “it was NAPOLI:ox, but he did not
speak of furniture.”

more, I will not allow—”
“You must not,” she said, “be too Napoleonic. Such
an attitude is improper in a modest household like ours.
You were going to say 9."
“I was going to say that I will not allow myself to
speak harshly to you, even if you fail in sympathy with the
natural desire of a dog to avoid draughts."
“Draughts?”
“Yes, draughts. You will find if you lie down on the
floor that it is a mass of draughts.”
She bent herself to the carpet. “There isn't a vestige of
draught,” she said.
“Not there, Francesca,” I cried.
And, what is
“That's the only
draughtless spot in the room. Try close to the door. Lie
down there with your face on your paws. Look out! The
butler's coming.”
“He isn't.”
“No. I invented him; but you don't do it as well as
the dog.”
“You are too clever this morning,” she said.
“It is a way I have,” I said.
“And that being so,” she continued, “I have determined
to resign all my household duties into your hands.”
“Francesca,” I said, “you overwhelm me.”
“Poor dear,” she went on, talking softly to herself, “it is
a very hard morning for him to begin on."
“No matter,” I said; “I am ready. Only tell me what
I have to do, so that I may note it down on paper.”
“Food first,” she said. “You will start with the cook.”
“Oh, but that's delightful!” I said. “Do you know,
Francesca, that it has been my one ambition to interview
Mrs. Pears officially? I have caught glimpses of her when
the children have had Christmas trees, but now I shall
really know her.”
“That's capital,” said Francesca.
luncheon and dinner, you know."
“Yes,” I said, “we will lunch on beefsteak and kidney
pie, roly-poly pudding, and, just to celebrate the occasion,
a Welsh rarebit.”
“An excellent meal for the children,” she said. “Alice
and Frederick particularly will revel in it. But there might
not be any kidneys.”
“No kidneys' " I said.

“Then,” she said, “you must think of the servants, and
you must order dinner for us. But I will not interfere with
you further.” -
“Oh, yes,” I said, “do interfere with
to. I like it. I'm not like some. I
“Well then,” she said, “after Mrs. Pears you must see
nurse. She's dissatisfied about something. And the
housemaid wants to consult you about linen; and Bain
has a list of garden things he wants to buy; and the
boot-boy's mother is going to call at 11 o'clock to plead
the cause of her son, who has done something abominable
with a catapult; and after that you'll have to sit by Muriel
and Nina while they practise; and there'll be lots of other
things turning up as you go along. Away with you now
to your work, and whatever happens keep a brave heart
and a smiling face. I shall stay here to look after the
dog and muse on the mutability of human affairs.”
“Francesca,” I said after a pause, “I have been thinking
this matter over, and I have come to the conclusion that
things had better go on as they are.”
“I thought you'd think that,” she said.
“The duties you propose to me, though various, are
slight and unimportant. I should perform them too well
and too quickly, and I should thus put a slur on all your
past activities. You would never be able to look me in the
face again. I cannot bear that thought. Go and busy
yourself about the hive while I stay here and guard your

A show for the idle and curious giving,
Crude calipash stiffens and crude calipee,

With horny eyes glazing, with flippers' faint gesture,
They've laid him—awaiting a summons inside,
Where the chef and his satellites stand in white

In the chatter around him the monkeys that quarrel

THE EASTER BONNET.
A ComEDY OF A PARCELS LIFT.
Miss Selina Lightfoot to Violette et Cie.
Easter Sunday, 1911.
DEAR MADAM, I am greatly dis-
appointed not to receive the Marie
Stuart bonnet which you promised me
faithfully should be here on Saturday
evening. The result is that I have had
to attend church in my old one, thus
breaking a habit now many years old
of wearing new things on this day.
But what troubles me more is your
failure to keep your word, for that has
never happened before.
Yours truly, SELINA LIGHTFoot.
Violette et Cie to Miss Lightfoot.
(By hand.) Easter Tuesday.
DEAR MADAM, Your letter is very
surprising, for our messenger-boy, who
brings this, positively assures us that
he placed the bonnet in the parcels lift
to your flat on Saturday at about 5.30.
As the box was too large for the lift he
took out the bonnet and wrapped some
silver paper round it.
We are Yours obediently,
Violette ET CIE.
Miss Lightfoot to Violette et Cie.
Easter Tuesday.
DEAR MADAM, I of course accept
the word of your messenger. He seems
a very nice honest sort of boy; but
unfortunately I cannot verify it as I
should like to, as the lift has stuck in
the flat above; and as the occupants—
an elderly gentleman and his servant—
are away for the Easter holidays we
cannot get in to liberate it. If, as I
cheerfully believe, the bonnet is in this
lift, I will obtain possession of it on
their return.
Yours truly, SELINA LIGHTFoot.
Miss Lightfoot to Mr. Browell.
(To await arrival.)
Easter Tuesday.
Miss Lightfoot presents her compli-
ments to Mr. Browell and begs to draw
his attention to the fact that the
parcels lift has been stuck in his flat
ever since his departure, to the great
annoyance and inconvenience of the
other tenants. Will he kindly have it
put right immediately? If by any
chance a parcel in silver paper should
be in the lift Miss Lightfoot would be
glad to have it.
Mr. Rupert Browell to Miss Lightfoot.
Three days later.
Mr. Browell presents his compli-
ments to Miss Lightfoot and begs to
say that he exceedingly regrets that
the lift should have behaved so incon-
siderately during his absence. It is
now mended. Mr. Browell has plea-
sure in sending Miss Lightfoot the
silver paper parcel.
Miss Lightfoot to Mr. Browell.
The same day.
Miss Lightfoot presents her compli-
ments to Mr. Browell and would take
it as a favour if he would inform her if
the fish which has been occupying the
lift for the past five days with her
parcel belonged to him.
Mr. Browell to Miss Lightfoot.
The same day.
Mr. Browell presents his compliments
to Miss Lightfoot and begs to state that
the fish was a haddock ordered by his
housekeeper before she was aware that
both he and she were going away for
Easter.
Miss Lightfoot to Violette ct Cie.
The same day.
DEAR MADAM, I find that, as I
anticipated, your boy was quite truthful.
The bonnet was in the lift; but by a
sad mischance the lift contained also
a haddock, which, since it was there
some days, has saturated the bonnet
with the odour of fish. Do you think
anything could be done to put it right,
and ought not the owner of the flat

DEAR MADAM, If you will send the
bonnet we will see what can be done.
Probably a new lining will serve. In
any case we agree with you that it is
hard that the expense should fall on
you. Yours faithfully,
Violette ET CIE.
Miss Lightfoot to Mr. Browell.
The same day.
Miss Lightfoot presents her compli-
ments to Mr. Browell and begs to
inform him that her bonnet has been
rendered unwearable by spending five
days in the company of his haddock
in a restricted space. Miss Lightfoot
would be glad to know what Mr.
Browell proposes to do about it.
Mr. Browell to Miss Lightfoot.
The same day.
Mr. Browell presents his compliments
to Miss Lightfoot and greatly regrets
that her bonnet has been rendered un-
wearable, but he suggests that the
proper person to approach would be
the landlord, who is responsible for the
lift being kept in working order. It
was not Mr. Browell's purchase of a
fish that was irregular, but the failure
of the machinery which moves the lift
freely up and down.
Miss Lightfoot to Violette et Cie.
The same day.
DEAR MADAM, If, as you think, a
new lining will meet the case I agree
to that being done; but I know that
I shall always feel conscious of the
bonnet's aroma, even if it has none, and
I shall wear it only in the streets,
omnibuses, &c., and never when calling,
and never, of course, in church. Please
tell me what the cost of the lining will
be. Yours truly,
SELINA LightFoot.
Miss Lightfoot to Mr. Browell.
Two days later.
Miss Lightfoot presents her compli-
ments to Mr. Browell and begs to
inform him that the landlord denies
responsibility. According to his letter
he is surprised that Mr. Browell should
leave his flat for so long with a fish in
the liſt. Miss Lightfoot has ascertained
that a new lining to her bonnet, the
least that can be done to it, will cost
four shillings, and she begs to suggest
that Mr. Browell should discharge this
account.
Mr. Browell to Miss Lightfoot.
The same day.
Mr. Browell presents his compliments
to Miss Lightfoot and begs to say that
he considers the landlord's reply evasive.
At the same time he cannot acquit him-
self of a certain negligence in the matter
of the fish, and he therefore begs that
Miss Lightfoot will allow him to defray
the cost of a new bonnet and dispense
with the injured one altogether.
Miss Lightfoot to Mr. Browell.
The same day.
Miss Lightfoot presents her compli-
ments to Mr. Browell and begs to thank
him for his extreme courtesy in the
matter of the bonnet and the fish.
Mr. Browell to Miss Lightfoot.
A week later.
Mr. Browell presents his compliments
to Miss Lightfoot and would like to
inquire if she is a “Patience" player,
because if so he would greatly esteem
the privilege of calling upon her to
explain a very fascinating variety known
as “The king stops the way,” which
she possibly may not know and which
comes out only once in very many
times.
Miss Lightfoot to Mr. Browell.

QUITE unshaken by the realists, Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD

fluence The Mating of Lydia (SMITH, ELDER), tyrannical,
sinister, italianate, combining a passion for antiques with
the worst excesses of rack-renting and unrighteous evict-
ment, would have been just the fellow for Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE to get his knife into; as it is, a timely shot in the
dark—and the pacified CHANCELLoR will rake in colossal
death-duties, whilst the estate, handed over through the
generosity of the heir to the wicked virtuoso's disowned
| daughter, will be merged with that of Lord Tatham, type
of all that is best in our ancient aristocracy. The Mating of
Lydia is dowered with Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD's accustomed
dignity of style, painstaking if not too intimate characterisa-
tion, and wealth of unconcealed knowledge. (Did you know
that certain Cumbrian dalesmen still preserved the ancient
“yan-tyan-tethera" and so on for “one-two-three" in
counting their sheep?) Lydia is a slightly advanced—but,
oh, so slightly advanced—young woman who sketches the
|Cumberland scenery. Wooed ardently by young Lord
Tatham she prefers Claude Faversham, before whom a
moral struggle lies. Agent and heir-expectant of the
Byronic miser, he has to decide whether he will break with
him if he cannot persuade him to repair the insanitary
| cottages that fester on his domains. Enough to say that
|Virtue triumphs in the end, as it did in the brave days of

Perhaps when I have proclaimed myself as this great
while past one of the most zealous admirers of “GEoRGE A.

produce one very small bone for picking between us. It is
not that I in the least object to his recapturing the first
fine careless rapture of his funny stories by repeating them.
I do not. Indeed, I myself could be after reading them
every day for a whole year and more, the way I would still
be amused at the hinder end of it. What I do think
unnecessary is that he should call his new book Doctor.
Whitty (METHUEN), when that plausible hero is so obviously
Dr. Lucius O'Grady and no one else. Moreover, not only
does it contain at length the episode of the local band
and the National Anthem, but the other characters of
Ballintra tally exactly with those of Ballymoy, namely,
Colonel Richardson with Major Kent, Thady Glynn with
Timothy Doyle, and so on, each with each. The artist of
the picture-wrapper seems to have felt this as much as
I did, for his Dr. Whitty is as like Mr. CHARLEs HAwTREY
as makes no difference. So why not have added the Regan
episode and sold it as the book of the play ? However,
this once stated, I have only to record as usual my delighted
appreciation of Canon HANNAY's engaging hero, his wiles,
his geniality, and his happy economies of the truth. So
long as the reverend author continues thus successfully
not to leave gaiety all to the laity he may call his
characters by what names he pleases and be sure of a
welcome from me.

[MARCH 19, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
It is asserted by those in the know that a book, to have
any chance of a remunerative circulation nowadays, must
be a novel, and the blame for this is attributed, with some
confidence, to the depraved taste of the modern public. As
one of the accused I resent the imputation and reply that if
authors would treat us with less contempt we should be
even more free with our money. Take the case of C. N. and
A. M. WILLIAMSON; there is no doubt that the peculiar gift
of these brilliant collaborators is the writing up of motor
tours in a style inimitably vivid and light-hearted. As long
as they continue their offer to put us in a car and give us
a run over any part of the earth, no one will refuse the lift.
Why then overload the caboodle with an alien plot of
fictitious passion and adventure? Had The Love Pirate
(METHUEN) been entitled The Californian Tour and been
written as such, I should have been the last person to be
disagreeable about it—it was the best of bons voyages; but
the alleged virtues of Nick Hilliard and the Princess di
Sereno, their loves and escapades, could not convince and
might bore even a child. All the end and most of the
middle of the story were apparent as soon as one read the
beginning. I have no doubt that the authors' intentions
outstanding triumph of this remarkable miniature. Such
and such things are thought and said and suffered by the
human boy, and such and such wounds he deals, unwillingly
and half-wittingly, to those he loves. And, to be frank, I
find this George Tracy worth all the Stalkies on the one
side and the Eric Littlebylittles on the other of the modern
novelists' galleries of odd and even boys.
It seems to me that the STANLEY WEYMAN traitor-hero is
rather vieux jeu. At first, like ping-pong, he was piquant
because he was new. But now we know all about him.
He comes from Paris. To save his neck or fill his depleted
purse he has agreed to spy upon the noblesse, of which he is
an off-shoot, and not till the last chapter will his gallantry
and his misfortunes overcome the scorn with which he
inspires the blue-blooded damsel whom he fain would wed.
In Skipper Anne (HopDER AND SToughton), Miss MARIAN
BowFR has tried to break new ground by making NApoleoN
send her young gentleman of France to England, to the
home of the English tutor who had married his Royalist
aunt and become the father of the necessary Royalist
maiden. It was a case of “your honour or your life.” Of

will be many such.

Mr. CHARLEs MARRIOTT's fine craftsmanship, his faculties
of sensitive observation and fastidious selection increase (as
is seemly but none too common) with the ripeness of his
experience. There are a thousand-and-one charms in The
Catfish (HURST AND BLACKETT) and not a page over which
one does not murmur, “How true!" or “How jolly!” or
“By Jove, that is so!" The Catfish, “the demon of the
deep,” is, apparently, to cod as a cat to rats—uncomfort-
able but extraordinarily stimulating. Yet the very delicate
portrait of Mary Festing, who, herself passed by, loves and
understands and mothers George Tracy, the hero, ill
deserves such a label under it. I make bold to say that
it is the only wrong thing in Mr. MARRiott's book. The
rest is sheer delight. The story is just the development
of this central character of George, with so much of the
lives and thoughts of others as shall serve to illuminate it,
and the author has handled his theme with an admirable
restraint. With a few deft touches he has presented quite
a dozen and a half of sentient, articulate, lovable people.
He has dared to see and to state the beauty that is in life
touched, yet unclouded, by sorrow, but not made squalid in
the neo-realist manner. George Tracy is too much alive,
one would say, to be a portrait; he is the creation of an
affectionate student of his kind. He remains interesting
to the end, which is marriage. But his childhood is the

his perfect knowledge of English from his bi-lingual relatives
for more than two hundred pages, during all the time, in
fact, that he was living in their house. I'm afraid, in the
language of the Halls, I don't think. Apart from that, I
find the story rather too obvious. And there are chap-
ters, if you will believe me, with the headings, “The Plot
Thickens,” and “The Green-eyed Monster.” But people
of a less blasé condition of mind than myself will find that
the book is pleasantly written and not unexciting.

2. Through the destruction of the turf on Plymouth Hoe, Drake
had been prevented from playing his historic game of bowls.
3. Corrosive acid had been poured on the letter inviting William of
Orange to England.”
“An Athens telegram to-days says the Crown Prince and the

Though much I love you, O my land (Great Britain),
And patriot ardour streams through all my pores,
Yet there are moments when I'm badly bitten
With a desire for alien shores.

Pure joy to pay my taxes; yet at times
I can with comfort, for a little spell, fare

When squalls of rain, in fact, and blizzards squealing
Usher the amorous prime of Spring.

INFORMATION.
OUR conversation had turned to the topic of gifts for
children, and I gathered from a remark made by Eric Baynell
that in his opinion the very best toy for a boy of five was
a lettrick sinnle. I hesitated for a moment or two, and then,
confessed quite openly that I did not know what a lettrick
sinnle was; adding, by way of excuse, that I was getting
on in years and that, so far as I was concerned, the toy-
age was a thing of the distant past. - i
Eric Baynell made no attempt to conceal his views of my
ignorance; he looked at me with wide-open eyes, amazed
and even pitiful. Then he ran upstairs to find his own
lettrick sinnle, just to show me. It proved to be a really
fascinating toy: when you pressed the button the arm fell,
ºnd when you pulled the lever it rose again, as often as not.
}: was as nearly like a railway signal workcd by electricity
as a toy could be. i - . . . . As i
This incident gave Eric an opening which he could not
ignore, and my educatión began. In handing me his
father's box he told me what a cigarette exactly was and
how to work it. He felt rather sorry, I think, for this poor
* . . . . . .
ºfool who had strayed in for tea, and his enthusiasm for
enlightening the ignoramus knew very few bounds.
“You mustn't put it in your pocket relse it'll get all
bendy. You put one end in your mouth—watch Daddy,
he can do it; not too far in—yes, that's about right. Now
you put a blaze at the other end and the smoke will come,
and it'll keep on coming-and coming until there's only a
little bit of sigga-ette left, and you must throw that away.”
“Throw it away ? Why be so wasteful?” I asked.
“But you must 1” exclaimed Eric in some alarm. “If
you don't, the burn will get in your mouth.”
While I smoked he entertained me with an account of
his visit to the Zoo on the previous day. He explained just
what the Zoo was, and gave me a few tips about the giraffe
and his appearance. He also describcd his father's lawn-
mower and roll-top desk. Then his eye, wandering round
for something else to tell me about, fell on the piano.
“That's the piano,” he said. I indicated my astonish-
ment. “I’ll show you how it works if you like,” he said.
“You have to open it first. Thank you. Then you press
these white things with your fingers until the music comes
out. That's liow it's done.” -
“And the black things? I suppose they're just to make
a bit of a pattern,” I suggested.
“Oh, no, they make noises too, when you knock them;
but the black music isn't very nice, I think.”
“I say,” he said presently, “wouldn't you like to come
upstairs and see Baby? He's very interesting.”
“Baby's asleep, dear; better choose another time,” said
his mother.
“Well, p'raps we had.
He works much better when
he's awake, you know.”

DND of THE LITTLE SEAsoN.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--I gave a little
dinner the other night at the Recherché
for Twirlinski, whose dancing has been
easily the most outstanding feature of
the Little Season. My sweet thing, if
you've never seen his performance of
“La Matinée d'un Baºuf,” you've never
really lived It's not exactly what ces
autres call dancing—choregraphic poem
is its proper name. He wears an ox's
skin and horns, and grazes, and finds
a red handkerchief in the field and
tosses it, and gives a wonderful bellow
on middle C, and a kick, my dear child,
that's an absolute stroke of genius !
A great sob of joy went through the
house when that kick was given.
Off, Twirlinski is quite charming,
with a most interesting point of view,
which he develops in broken English
and chipped French. We can none of
us quite tell what colour his eyes are.
Babs says they're brown. I say they're
blue. After an enormous amount of
coaxing we got him to give some lessons
in the new kind of dancing, which
expresses the emotions of animals. I
learned the dearest little dance, “La
Demi-heure d'un Agneau,” in which I
express the feelings of a lamb when it
first sees a leaf of mint. I wear the
darlingest white fleecy dress, and dear
Twirlinski says my performance proves
me to be “Artiste jusqu'au bout des
ongles / " Babs and some others also
learned of him and, when we were
pretty perfect, of course we began to
look about for a charity. When one's
taken up something new and looks
specially charming doing it, always the
next move is to find a charity that
wants help! But all the charities were
bagged, I found. Iºach one I thought
of, I heard that some wretches were
giving a kick-up of some kind in aid of
it. At last I'd an inspiration: the
street-kerb sellers — those wonderful
creatures one glimpses as one drives
through the poky parts of town, stand-
ing in rows on the kerb with trays full
of songs and toys and things hanging
round their necks—what do they do
when they can't do it any longer? And
there was my charity | The Superan-
nuated Street-Kerb Sellers! I simply
longed to help them We would hire
a theatre—or some dear manager would
lend us one—and give our dance-poems.
I threw myself into it with all my
extraordinary energy. I was to do my
“Demi-heure d'un Agneau; ” Babs was
to give “The Sad Chrysalis and the
Joyous Butterfly” (she's all swathed
up in brown gauze as the Sad Chrysalis,
and, in strictest, strictest confidence,
my dear, there's a good deal more of
the Sad Chrysalis than the Joyous
Butterfly about the whole perform-
ance!); several others were going to
help; and dear Twirlinski himself had
promised to appear. Just as every-
thing was getting into train Beryl
Clarges came rushing round one day
and said, “What's this I hear about
your giving a performance for the Super-
annuated Street-Kerb Sellers? They're

give my Miracle play, ‘The Seven

DRAMATIC NEWS.
ENcouraged by the example of the
Baron HENRI DE Rothschild, who has
recently written a drama named Craesus,
--- quite a number of eminent
publicists are engaged on
classical and historical
dramas, in which the auto-
biographical note is agree-
ably sounded.
Perhaps the most inter-
esting of these ventures is
the five-Act drama, Cleon, on
which Mr. LLoyd GEORGE
has been engaged for some
time past. Holding with
some high modern authorities
that THUCYDIDEs’ portrait of
the Paphlagonian tanner was
distorted by party prejudice,
it has been Mr. LLoy D
GEORGE's aim to present
this great democratic patriot
in his true colours, viz., as
a generous and warm-hearted
humanitarian who was al-
ways ready to take up the
cudgels for the masses against
the tyrannous exactions of
the robber oligarchs. -
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL
is collaborating with the
Baron DE Forest in a fan-
tastic opera entitled Proteus,
in which the name part is
sustained by a chameleonic
hero, whose kaleidoscopic
opportunism is crowned with
success, to the complete dis-
comfiture of the representa-
tives of an effete and Pro-
crustean consistency.
Mr. Asquith has just completed the
scenario of a classical morality play
entitled Orpheus. According to his
version of the legend, which differs
slightly from that given by LEMPRIERE,
Eurydice, resenting her husband's re-
fusal to allow her to play duets with
him in public, throws in her lot with
a gang of wild Thracian women, known
as the IIayxuporrióes, who ultimately tear
the unfortunate minstrel in pieces to
slow music.
Mr. J. A. PEASE's contribution differs
from those of his colleagues in being
modern in title and treatment, and is
a frankly humorous extravaganza en-
titled Where Ignorance is Bliss ; or,
Iºunciman and Dunciman.

THE obiter dicta of great men having
been exhausted by repeated citation in

A few recent specimens of these are
here appended:—

Hardly any public man will dare to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TRAGEDY IN LITTLE.
THE great question of the day is,
What will become of Sidney? When-
ever I think of him now, the unbidden
tear wells into my eye . . . and wells
down my cheek . . . and wells on to
my collar. My friends think I have a
cold, and offer me lozenges; but it is
Sidney who makes me weep. I fear
that I am about to lose him. -
He came into my life in the followin
way. -
Some months ago I wanted to buy
some silk stockings; not for myself, for
I seldom wear them, but for a sister.
The idea came suddenly to me that
any woman with a brother and a birth-
day would simply love the one to give
her silk stockings for the other. But of
course they would have to be the right
silk stockings—the fashionable shape
for the year, the correct assortment of
clocks, and so forth. Then as to
material—could I be sure I was getting
silk, and not silkette or something in-
ferior? How maddening if, seeing that
I was an unprotected man, they palmed
off Jaeger on me! Clearly this was a
case for outside assistance. So I called
in Celia. - *
“This,” I said to her, “is practically
the only subject on which I am not an
expert. At the same time I have a
distinct feeling for silk stockings. If
you can hurry me past all the embar-
rassing counters safely, and arrange for
the lady behind the right one to show
me the right line in silken hose, I will
undertake to pick out half-a-dozen pairs
that would melt any sister's heart.”
Well, the affair went off perfectly.
Celia took the matter into her own
hands and behaved just as if I were
buying them for her. The shop-
assistant also behavcd as if I were.
Fortunately I kept my head when it
came to giving the name and address.
“No,” I said firmly to Celia. “Not
yours; my sister's.” And I dragged
her away to tea.
Now whether it was because Celia
had particularly enjoyed her aſternoon;
or because she felt that a man who was
as ignorant as I about silk stockings
must lead a very lonely life; or because
I had mentioned casually and errone-
ously that it was my own birthday
that week, I cannot say; but on the
following morning I received a little
box, with a note on the outside which
said in her handwriting, “Something
for you. Be kind to him.” And I
opened it and found Sidney.
He was a Japanese dwarf-tree—the
merest boy. At eighty or ninety,
according to the photographs, he would
be a stalwart fellow with thick bark on
his trunk, and fir-cones or acorns (or
lightning.
whatever was his speciality) hanging
all over him. Just at present he was
barely ten. I had only eighty years to
wait before he reached his prime. . .
Naturally I decided to lavish all
my care upon his upbringing. I
would water him after breakfast every
morning, and (when I remembered it)
at night. If there was any top-dressing
he particularly fancied he should have it.
If he had any dead leaves to snip off, I
would snip them.
It was at this moment that I dis-
covered something else in the box—a
card of instructions. I have not got it
now, and I have forgotten the actual
wording, but the spirit of it was this:
IIINTs on THE PROPER REARING AND
BRINGING-UP of A JAPANESE
Dwarf-TREE.
The life of this tree is a precarious
one, and if it is to be successfully
brought to manhood the following rules
must be carefully observed—
I. This tree requires, above all else,
fresh air and exercise. -
II. Whenever the sun is shining, the
tree should be placed outside, in a
position where it can absorb the rays.
III. Whenever the rain is raining,
it should be placed outside, in a position
where it can absorb the wet.
IV. It should be taken out for a trot
at least once every day.
W. It simply loathes artificial light
and artificial heat. If you keep it in
your drawing-room, see that it is
situated as far as possible from the
chandelier and the gas-stove.
VI. It also detests noise. Do not
place it on the top of the pianola.
VII. It loves moonlight. Leave it
outside when you go to bed, in case the
moon should come out.
VIII. On the other hand it hates
Cover it up with the
canary's cloth when the lightning
begins.
IX. If it shows signs of drooping, a
course of massage will generally bring
it round.
X. Dut in no case offer it buns. .
Well, I read these instructions care-
fully, and saw at once that I should
have to hand over the business of rear-
ing Sidney to another. I have my
living to earn the same as anybody
else, and I should never get any work
done at all if I had constantly to be
rushing home from the office on the
plea that it was time for Master
Sidney's sun-bath.
So I called up my housekeeper, and
placed the matter before her.
I said: “Let me introduce you to
Sidney. He is very dear to me; dearer
to me than a-a brother. No, on
second thoughts my brother is perhaps
—well, anyhow, Sidney is very dear
to me. I will show my trust in you
by asking you to tend him for me.
Here are a few notes about his health.
Frankly he is delicate. Dut the doctors
have hope. With care, they think, he
may live to be a hundred-and-fifty. His
future is in your hands.”
• My housekeeper thanked me for
this mark of esteem and took the card
of instructions away with her. I asked
her for it a week afterwards and it
appeared that, having committed the
rules to memory, she had lost it. But
that she follows the instructions I have
no doubt; and certainly she and Sidney
understand each other's ways exactly.
Automatically she gives him his bath,
his massage, his run in the Park.
When it rains or snows or shines, she
knows exactly what to do with Sidney.
But as a consequence I see little of
him. I suppose it must always be so;
we parents must make these sacrifices
for our children. Think of a mother,
only seeing her eldest-born for fifteen
weeks a year through the long period
of his schooling; and think of me,
doomed to catch only the most casual
glimpses of Sidney until he is ninety.
For, you know, I might almost say
that I never see him at all now. As
I go to my work I may, if I am
lucky, get a fleeting glance of him on
the tiles, where he sits drinking in
the rain or sun. In the evening, when
I return, he is either out in the moon-
light or, if indoors, shunning the
artificial light with the cloth over his
head. Indeed, the only times when I
really see him to talk to are when Celia
comes to tea with me. Then my house-
keeper hurries him in from his walk or
his sun-bath, and puts him, brushed
and manicured, on my desk; and Celia
and I whisper fond nothings to him. I
believe Celia thinks he lives there !
As I began by saying, I weep for
Sidney's approaching end. For my
housekeeper leaves this week. A new
one takes her place. How will she
treat my poor Sidney 2 The old card
of instructions is lost; what can I give
her in its place? The legend that
Sidney's is a precious life—that he
must have his morning bath, his run,
his glass of hot water after meals 2
She would laugh at it. Besides, she
may not be at all the sort of foster-
mother for a Japanese dwarf-tree. . .
It will break my heart if Sidney dies
now, for I had so looked forward to
celebrating his ninetieth birthday with
him. It will hurt Celia, too. But
her grief, of course, will be an inferior
affair. In fact, a couple of pairs of
silk stockings will help her to forget
him altogether. A. A. M.

And the fact that the sack was still full of copper completely
deceived the thieves.

THE SILENT TEAR.
They had always imagined their
uncle to be a very poor man. He
lived in a little house and spent no
more upon himself than was absolutely
necessary to keep in existence the part-
nership between his soul and his body.
When the news of his illness reached
his three nephews they behaved each
after his own manner. - -
George, the eldest one, who was
possessed of a genuine sympathy and
affection for the old man, wired in-
structions to a noted specialist to pro-
ceed at once to his uncle's bedside.
Having purchased a stock of delicacies
and nutritive jellies and wines he drove
round with them personally, to ensure
that they should arrive in time. For
many years past he had sent him
presents of little luxuries. This he had
done anonymously, out of respect for
the proper pride of his poor relative.
When he reached the house he was
relieved to find that the doctor had not
mentioned his name.
William, the second nephew, hastened
to his uncle at once. He, too, had
rendered many little kindnesses to the
old man. These had been inspired not
by any charitable motive, but by a
firm belief that even the small amount
which his uncle could bequeath to him
would be more useful in the future
than nothing at all. When he arrived
in the sick-room he sobbed loudly be-
hind his handkerchief and reminded the
suffering man of the many benefits he
had received from his (William's) hands.
Peter, the youngest nephew, looked
on the whole business as a confounded
nuisance. His uncle had been no ex-
ception to his general rule of loving
himself only, and he regarded sick-bed
scenes, off the stage, as being intoler-
ably boring affairs. However, as he
happened to be passing the house on
his way to the station, he decided to
look in for a minute or two.
The uncle recovered and, but for his
being knocked over by a taxi shortly
afterwards, might have lived for many
eal'S.
After his death it was discovered that
he had been in reality an extremely
wealthy man. By his last will and
testament he left every penny of his
fortune to his nephew Peter.
George was grieved, not because he
desired the money, but because he would
have valued some small recognition of
the affection he had always felt for the
dead man.
William was furiously angry. He
regarded the money and time which
he had expended on the old gentleman
as a good investment gone wrong. He
turned savagely to Peter and said,
“What have you done to deserve this?
George and I have shown nothing but
kindness to our uncle, while you have
neglected him utterly and have lived
your own selfish life. Why should you
fawn upon him during that illness and
persuade him to make a new will in
your favour?”
“As to that,” replied Peter, “George
was kind to him because it gratified
his generous nature; you were kind to
him because it gratified your greedy
instincts; and I was selfish because it
gratified my selfishness. As to fawning
on him, I can assure you that I didn't
do anything of the sort. Why he
should leave me all his wealth is a
complete mystery to me.”
“What did you say to him 2" de-
manded William sceptically.
“Say? I was in too much pain to
say anything. I'd got a bit of grit in
my eye as I opened his door. I just
shook his hand, said I was awfully
sorry to hear he was seedy, and rushed
off, half-blind with the beastly thing,
to the chemist's round the corner.”
Then the three brothers sought to
discover an appropriate moral for this
little story. But they failed.

ES S E N C E OF PA R L I A M E N T.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
Joaº on
J
House of Commons, Monday, March
17.—Rarely, if ever, has the hollowness
of Party pretension to purity of pro-
cedure been more cynically admitted
than to-night. Exhibition made com-
F. by unveiling not of one side but
oth. Business of sitting was to allot
remainder of Session up to close of
financial year, which happens a fort-
night to-day. PREMIER moved reso-
lution appropriating whole time for
Government business, an arrangement
involving some inversion of practice
dealing with Consolidated Fund Bill.
Opposition bursting with patriotic
indignation. Here was another proof
of the inherent iniquity of the Govern-
ment. As Cousin HUGH put it, “They
have reached that stage in vice when
vice is loved for its own sake.” Bonn ER
LAw, amid loud cheers from the Oppo-
sition, saw in the procedure a fresh step
in that degradation of Parliament going
on ever since a Liberal Ministry, fatal
fruit of successive General Elections,
came into power.
As for BANBURY, nothing less than
an Amendment would soothe his per-
turbed feelings. He accordingly moved
“That this House declines to sanction
any proposal further arbitrarily to
#, hºa/4 malaº
..º.º.º.º.
# 84*.*
*4-
HOW TO “BRIGHTEN’” THE HOUSE.
curtail discussion of Supply and of the
various stages of the Consolidated Fund
Bill as a violation of the Constitutional
rights of the House.”
Thus was battle set in array. So
strong the righteous anger of Oppo-
sition it seemed possible that in its
flaming fire, its unquenchable zeal, it
would eat up the Government, majority
and all.
Before ten minutes had sped, lo!
a strange thing happened. PREMIER
admitted that course he invited House
to adopt was at variance with custom.
But there was a precedent for it. In
1905, when DRINCE ARTHUR was
Premier and right honourable gentle-
men on Front Bench opposite were his
colleagues, precisely the same thing was
done. Having demonstrated in detail
strictness of analogy he came to crown-
ing turn of comedy.
“The Resolution,” he said, “was
very strongly opposed by the Oppo-
sition of the day. I do not think any
one spoke more strongly against it
than I did myself.”
“With his usual adroitness,” as
BoNNER LAw ruefully confessed,
PREMIER had by this admission taken
the wind out of the sails of the
4nºwº,
ºw
enemy's barque. Hunting up Hansard
for report of what took place this time
eight years ago, Bon NER had gleefully
jotted down passages from Asquith's
speech in which he denounced PRINCE
ARTHUR's resolution as “marking the
degradation of the House of Commons
. . . transforming it into a mere
automatic machine registering the will
of the executive.”
Had meant when PREMIER sat down
to rise and confound him with reha-
bilitation of these vituperative ghosts.
Effect marred by PREMIER's admission.
Nevertheless something to have the
authorised text recited. Read it
accordingly. Speaker being Asquith
it followed as matter of course that no
living man could more forcibly denounce
the course that PRINCE ARTHUR's
successor to the Premiership was to-
day recommending. As for BANBURY's
Amendment it turned out that it was
“conveyed" from JoHN REDMoND, who
moved it on PRINCE ARTHUR's Resolu-
tion of March, 1905. -
That nothing should be wanting to
perfection of the farce, John DILLON
got up and announced that “the Irish
Nationalist Party will support the
PREMIER's motion with the firm con-

viction that by doing so there is
nothing inconsistent with their honour-
able record as defenders of free speech.”
ln the end, the proposal submitted
by PRINCE ARTHUR eight years ago and
then hotly denounced by Liberal Oppo-
sition and Irish Nationalists was by
their combined forces carried by 227
against 120, what time PRINCE ARTHUR's
men, now in opposition, wept scalding
tears of shame and indignation at this
criminal tampering with constitutional
custom.
What a world this is
Business dome.—Government appro-
priate all time of House to 31st instant
inclusive.
Thursday.—When CHARLEs LAMB
was at the India Office he was noted,
among other things, for irregularity in
the hour of arrival at his desk in the
morning. A man of high principle,
sterling honesty, he, as he once ex-
plained, made up for coming late by
going away early. To-day House on
verge of Easter holiday varies the
procedure. It came early (SPEAKER
took the Chair at 11 A.M.) and it got
away early, adjournment taking place
on stroke of five o'clock.
Arrangement avowedly made to give
Members residing in distant parts of
the country opportunity of reaching
their homes before holiday is quite
over. In some cases this end may not
be achieved without difficulty. Easter
recess this year is more conveniently
calculated by hours than by days.
SPEAKER rising at five o'clock this
afternoon will resume the Chair on
Monday at 2.45 P.M. Irony of situation
sharpened by consideration of fact that
this so-called recess includes customary
Saturday half-holiday, to say nothing
of Sunday.
House of Lords manages things
differently. When, as has happened
since Session opened, they have no work
to do they don't potter around making
believe to be busy. They just shut up
shop and go off to enjoy life. Yet call
of duty, when sounded, finds them
ready, aye ready |
Sounded once this week with remark-
able result. When they last met they
formally adjourned till 28th inst.
Probably not one in ten thousand Men
in the Street knows that they actually
held a sitting this week. Nevertheless
they did, and a rare sight was presented
to those in secret of intention.
Occasion arose upon necessity for
reading a second time a batch of
private Bills. There were fifty-four in
all, involving great public interests and
millions of money. On the Woolsack,
unrobed and not bewigged, sat Lord
ATRINSON, whose mordant wit de-
lighted the House of Commons whilst
- - -
he was yet with us, whose gaiety has
for years been eclipsed by the sombre
shadow of the Upper Chamber. In
the Commons the quorum necessary for
discharge of public business numbers
forty. In the Lords comparative level
of quality runs so high that three
Members suffice. And here they were
all in a row—Lord MoULTON and Lord
SHAw, whose memories are kept green
in the Commons; Lord DoNough MoRE,
Chairman of Committees in succession
to the lamented Lord ONSLow, fitly
completing the necessary trio. With
due formality the Clerk at Table read
in succession titles of the Bills. Lord
ATKINsoN, with automatic regularity
and precision, put the question: “That
this Bill be read a second time. Those
that are of that opinion say, “Content,’
the contrary, ‘Not content"; the ‘Con-
tents' have it.” - ,
Next, please, Mr. Clerk at the Table.
When the fifty-fourth Bill was reached
and passed Lord ATKINSON remarked,
“The House will now adjourn,” and
the four Peers walked forth, not a smile
on their noble countenances. -
It was magnificent; also, as will be
seen, it was business. * -
Business done.—Commons adjourn
for Easter recess.
LOOKING FORWARD.
IN the not too distant future a day
came when all the jokes gave out. It
had been threatening for a long while
and at last it came. The whole stock
was absolutely exhausted; no one was
left who could make a new joke; no one
was left who did not know the old ones.
The result was that the people, forced
upon seriousness, grew so critical of
affairs and so vigilant as to their rights
and wrongs that the statesmen laid
their heads together to see what could
be done to restore the semi-obscurity
in which it suited them best to operate.
“Could we not import some foreign
jokes?” one grey-beard inquired; but
there were two objections to that, one
fiscal and the other that foreign jokes
always threw up half their fun during
the crossing.
“No,” said the Prime Minister at
last, “what we must do is this: we
must arrange to segregate a number of
babies every year and bring them up
in such seclusion that no kind of a joke
can ever get to them, and then, when
the time is ripe for them to enter the
world, they will constitute a body of
responsible adult persons to whom the
story of the curate's egg, the brick under
the hat, and the riddle about the chicken
crossing the road are absolutely new.
Thus shall England be herself again.”
And it fell out exactly as he said.
ADJUSTMENTS.
I wish I could make up my mind
before leaving London just how long I
want to stay. I never can. That is
the weak spot of this coupon system.
It's a fine comprehensive system in its
way, I don't deny. One starts upon
the campaign armed at every point,
relieved in advance of all harassing
problems of barter and exchange. At
its best it can cover a sleigh-drive or a
cup of coffee in a station restaurant,
though for my own part, until one can
get coupons for drinks, for the purchase
of blotting-paper and wax matches, and
for having one's hair cut, I cannot con-
sider it to be wholly adequate. And
tipping by coupon is not practised yet
to any great extent. But the trouble
is that no reasonable person ever knows
how long he wants to stay in Switzer-
land, and whenever he adds on another
week he is almost certain to have to
move out of his room. For these little
instruments irrevocably fix your exits
and your entrances, and while you
have been enjoying its hospitality your
room has been booked by someone else
—in an office in London—who arrives
one fine day to drive you out, at the
point of the coupon, so to speak.
It is just this necessity of moving
from one room to another that makes
my life a burden in the Alps. You see
there is a good deal to be done before I
can get my room adjusted to my re-
quirements, and I simply hate to leave
it when I have got it right. Much as
one regrets the use of underhand
methods, most of these adjustments
have to be carried out by stealth, for
lack of coupons to cover one's minor
necessities. And I never like to give
the servants extra trouble when they
are so busy. -
In the first place, I always have to
have an additional table. This is
generally obtained under cover of dark-
ness from an empty room on a different
floor. Of course one must expect re-
prisals, and for this reason it is well
either (1) to secure the second table by
padlock and chain to the leg of the bed
or (2) to disguise it effectively. Then
there is the case of the bath-towel,
which can be obtained without any
difficulty by the simple expedient of
taking a hot tub. But it must be kept
under lock and key. Ink will be found
in the salon, which is generally un-
occupied during the dinner hour. I
was once held up by the concierge as I
conveyed it up in the lift. But know-
ing as I did that ink is an awkward
thing to snatch at, if it comes to a
scuffle, I made no reply whatever to his
protests. (And here I would remark
that it is of no small advantage in the

light has one pleasant peculiarity. It
goes on all the time, and it is not
etiquette to turn it off, except on really
brilliant days. But that does not com-
pensate one for the miserable quality
of the illumination of the bedrooms.
Your first business is to make a careful
and detailed inspection of the public
rooms. You may find it disheartening.
In many of them the lights will be
either quite out of reach or protected by
massive cut-glass globes which make it
| impossible to get at them. But at last,
if you persevere, it is probable that in
some secluded little writing-room or
corner of the lounge you will come
upon an unprotected bulb of great
power and brilliancy that is within
reach. It remains to effect an ex-
change. This is not always so easy as
it looks, for you must choose your
moment, and if you wander about
| waiting for your chance, with the bulb
| from the bedroom up your sleeve, you
are leaving the bedroom itself defence-
less. If it is discovered to be in the
dark suspicions will be aroused. After
some years of experience, I find myselſ
that the best plan is to have a bulb in
hand. This is simply annexed, at the
outset, from the far end of a remote
passage. You keep it waiting in your
pocket—though you have to be careful
if you are out ski-ing—till your oppor-
tunity comes. Then you silently and
swiftly substitute it for the one you
have marked down. When you have
in turn transferred that one to your
bedroom, you will still have an extra
bulb in hand, which can be used in
the same way when you have to move
your room. You take your light along
with you.
Believe me, there is no room that
can be made more comfortable than the
average room in a Swiss hotel. But it
does take a little care. I have been
fortunate this year in sticking to Num-
ber 34 from the day when I first arrived
many weeks ago, and as I have been
in a particularly acquisitive mood I am
bound to say, on looking round, that I
have a lot of nice stuff about me. I
fancy there will be a great scene on the
day after my departure, when it comes
to the sacking of Number 34.

IT'S AN IDL WIND
Now that the prolonged taxi strike is
practically over, it may be interesting to
give one or two facts which it has sug-
gested to a correspondent's imagination.
This correspondent, we understand,
is the person who first communicated
to the newspapers the exact dimensions
that St. Paul's Cathedral would have to
be enlarged to in order that its dome
might accommodate the moon, and the
value of anything he writes will there-
fore be appreciated by our readers.
The commissionaires and hotel porters
of London (he says) have a vastly
increased chest measurement per man
as a result of the prolonged blowing of
whistles during the strike. The average
enlargement is 4.227 inches, or in the
aggregate a distance which, if traversed
in a taxi, would cost the hirer 1s. 4d.,
exclusive of extras.
The restfulness and quiet of the Em-
bankment during the past few weeks
have produced a remarkable effect upon
the men whose daily task it is to
control the barges that pass up and
down the river. Several of them have
become poets (an increase, to be exact,
of 99.168 per cent. upon the total
available figures for the past twenty-
five years), and quite early in the strike
one of them was heard by a member of
the National Liberal Club to remark to
his mate, “What a charming morning!”
which shows a clear advance upon the
customary vocabulary of these humble
workers. -

A LONDON STREET scENE WHEN THE FREAK ADVERTISING MotoR GETS REALLY GoING.
THE VERY MODERN TRAVELLER.
[A nightmare of the near future, suggested possibly by witnessing
“The African Hunt’’ on the Holborn Bioscope.]
YoU want to witness the deeds I did
In the far-off Afric jungle
With the late lamented Dr. Kidd 2
It was not by a careless bungle
That I came alone from the vasty veld
After a long fight stern and bloody,
Alone, with the films tucked under my belt
And the monstrous spoil of a tawny pelt
That lies to-day in my Tooting study.
Turn on the moving pictures then.
(They are turned on.)
There is your humble servant
Starting forth for the lion's den
When the tropical dawn was fervent;
Notice the way I pound the grass,
No one could possibly call me “Slow Toes,”
Hot on the trail, with the sun like brass.
And what about Dr. Kidd 2 You ass,
The Doctor was taking these beautiful photo3.
Now we have reached the fateful spot
By the shores of the Jubbjub River;
I raise my rifle, prepared to pot
(Observe how the poppadums quiver).
Now is the lion leaving his lair;
Notice the way, at this ticklish juncture,
The wind of the desert is ruffling his hair—
Dut what is the dot that appears just there?
I have fired, of course. 'Tis the bullet's puncture.
Still he comes with increased chagrin ;
Once more I have raised my rifle,
When the Doctor shouts, “What a splendid scene!
Just stop where you are a trifle.”
Staunchly I answer, “Right, old pal; "
I think of the white cliff walls at Dover;
I care not a jot for the animal;
You have never seen, but to-day you shall,
A lion knocking an Englishman over.
Helpless I lie. The monstrous cat
Grins wide; when, lo! he has spotted
A movement of Dr. Kidd's. My hat!
He knows he has been snapshotted
Straight for the camera mark him swerve
(The films just here are extremely vivid),
Till Dr. Kidd has a lapse of nerve—
He bunks from his post. You will now observe
A bioscope artist being chivied.
For I have sprung to the gaping breach,
I have seized the camera's shutter;
Notice the lion's stupendous reach,
Long odds for a sporting flutter.
Diddled him. Dodged again. Encore.
Collared. I knew I had spotted the winner.
Dr. Kidd is, alas, no more.
And now for our Series No. 4,
The felis leo enjoying his dinner.
(The pictures end.)
A lion gorged is an easy prey,
The rest was a simple matter.
I crawled and potted him there as he lay
Torpid and slightly fatter;
I skinned his carcase and homeward won,
And although the papers have passed some
strictures
I rest content with my duty done,
For I know I have taken the best, bar none,
Of the earth's kinematographic pictures. Evoe.
ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE CHEQUE.
ONCE upon a time there was a wealthy philanthropist
who went about offering strangers a bearer-cheque for £100.
And first he spread it out before the eyes of a small child,
who, after looking at it for a moment, said, “Please give
me a penny; " and then he approached a serious young
man, who thanked him excessively, but declined on the
ground that he wanted to conquer the world unassisted
and alone. And then there came along towards him a man
in the middling years of life, to whom was the bearer-cheque
for £100 likewise tendered; and, looking at it with a merry
suspicious eye, the man in the middling years of life said,
“Ah, yes, I know those haves,” and passed on his way with
a jaunty assurance. And then the philanthropist held it
out to an old, old man, who snatched it with fervour.
“Within the past three days 300 waiters have joined their section
of the union and 500 corks have joined theirs.”—Daily News.
It will be a dramatic moment when the 500 corks come out
together.

BURGLARY UP-TO-DATE.
PROVIDING THE CLUE.
THE PRESSED CRITIQUE.
(Show Sunday.)
I KNow very little about Art and
almost nothing about the more terrible
modern complications of the malady,
but the other day William insisted on
dragging me off to see the work of
some painter whom he professes to
admire. Striking the towing-path at
Westminster, we worked our way up-
stream to the pretty riparian purlieu
where the man resides and entered his
studio, which ought to have been served
by a lift, and which struck me as being
singularly ill-furnished for the reception
of guests. I carefully leaned my um-
brella against the wall and it gave a
little sigh and tumbled down. I then
took off my hat and coat and placed
them in a dark corner on what appeared
to be a small table with a very pleasingly
patterned mosaic-work top.
I was thereupon led to the centre of
the room, where the artist, who did not
seem to have changed the upper part
of his boating costume, eyed me for
some moments so searchingly that I felt
convinced he could see the return half
of the ticket to Askalon which I had in
my right-hand waistcoat-pocket. After
this, and quite without provocation on
my part, he suddenly switched round
the rack. I have called it a rack, but
I believe the proper trade term for it is
an easel; anyhow, it had fixed upon it
an object which I could see at the first
glance was not only highly and freshly
coloured, but also done entirely by
hand.
1 waited. Nobody seemed to be
going to do anything about it, and it
was evident that I was expected to
speak. Obviously, if I betrayed signs
of consternation or sympathy the man
would be annoyed; a too enthusiastic
admiration, on the other hand, might
cause me to be suspected of insincerity,
which I hate. The best course appeared
to be a kind of jocular and polite com-
mendation, uttered in such a voice as to
suggest a considerable intensity of con-
cealed emotion. “That's capital,” I
said; “capital.” (As a matter of fact
I really thought it would have been—
under a more enlightened code of laws.)
After that I paused. It did not seem
to be fair that I should have to do all
the work, out of training as I was and
tired with my long walk; but no one
answered my gambit, and William
looked at me so sternly that I knew
I should have to speak again.
In the old and happier days it was
always possible to recognise with a start
of pleasure some faint likeness between
any specimen of plastic art and the
object it was intended to represent.
Nowadays, of course, no more humili-
ating taunt could be levelled at a
conscientious artist, and I was not
going to give myself away like that.
So I pointed at last to what looked
like a copper coal-scuttle in the midst
of the purple foliage at the extreme left-
hand bottom corner of the canvas, and
said doggedly, “I’specially just here.
Hot Stuff that.”
There was along pause. Then William,
who was holding up one fist in front of
his face as if he thought the picture
was going to give him a nasty jab in
the jaw, suddenly began to talk. He
said a good deal about the relativity of
values, about keys and compositions,
about bravura and pianissimo (I am not
absolutely sure of his exact words, but I
think I have them correct), about the
interdependence of homogeneity, about
the essence, rag-time, the summum |

bonum and the Pragmatic sanction, and
wound up his harangue by placing his
hand over the coal-scuttle (my coal-
scuttle) and saying, “Excellent, excellent
—except for that—I do think you
ought to cut that out.”
Not a little chagrined I moved away.
As I cast my eyes round the studio
they suddenly fell on a little picture in
a rather obscure place, a picture that
looked easy, a still-life study of a blue
vase with some sunflowers in it.
Coming back to the artist, I called his
attention to the thing. “I say, I do
like that,” I said, and I did. “That l”
he answered, shrugging his shoulders
and turning back to William,_* That!
Oh, that was left here by the chap who

THE YEAR.
Dolly came into the smoke-room and
coughed in an important way. One or
two lucky men near the door stole out.
The previous night Dolby had taken up
and pulverised the proposal that local
rates should be a charge on ground-
rents. Dolby had demonstrated con-
clusively, in a speech of three-quarters-
of-an-hour's duration, that his rates,
£38 14s. 6d., could not be paid out of
his ground-rent, £22 10s. 0d., Q. E. D.;
but the other users of the smoke-room
thought it might have been demon-
strated more quickly.
“We are bought and sold,” began
Dolby solemnly. “For eighteenpence
any member of this Cabinet would sell
his country.”
“I shouldn't think of offering
Edward GREY more than one-and-
three myself,” said Bailey.
“The signs of the times are most
ominous,” continued Dolby, declining
to be drawn into a discussion of the
relative values of Ministers. “I am
looking forward to 1926.”
“Do you think we shall have some
decent weather then 2" enquired Sellars.
“It is the Danger Year. Then we
shall e only fifty-four Dreadnoughts;
Germany will have forty-six. Is a
majority of eight sufficient 2 I put it
to you as reasonable men: what shall
We do then 2 ”
“Dredge the North Sea,” suggested
Bailey. “It’ll need it badly.”
“Hang it, old man,” said Austin,
who was in the sanguine mood induced
by backing two winners, “won't the
Colonies buck up and help us? They're
good stuff.”
“Let us suppose that Canada gives
us six, Australia four, and New Zealand
and South Africa two each—well, it
doesn't save the situation, for it is
obvious to every thinking man that the
Dreadnoughts belonging to Spain,
Turkey, Chili, and probably China,
might be placed at the disposal of
Germany.”
“The Republic of Liberia will back
us anyhow,” said the invincible optimist,
Bailey. -
If he hoped that Dolby would prove
that Liberia had no Dreadnoughts he
was sadly disappointed. Fixing him
with his eye, Dolby said, “Now we
come to armoured cruisers.”
“I haul down my flag,” cried Bailey;
“I give in to the Teutons; but don't let
the armoured cruisers open upon me.”
“We shall only have a majority of
six to four in them,” proceeded the
merciless Dolby, “As thinking men,
what do you make of that? What
does BERESFORD saw 2 " . . .
“He said everybody else was all
wrong. He might even say you were
wrong, Dolby,” replied Sellars.
“Now in the matter of torpedo-
destroyers — what is the margin of
safety there? I appeal to you as an
Englishman, Charters.”
“I’m not an Englishman.
Welsh stamp-licker.”
“Turning again to submarines,” con-
tinued Dolby, “we are utterly behind.
And hydroplanes—we have six to defend
this Empire. Who dares say that six
are adequate?”
No one dared say anything. A faint
hope spread through the room that
Dolby had finished with the Navy.
Dolby looked round the room trium-
phantly. “Now I'll recapitulate my
arguments to show that 1926 is the
critical year.”
Charters nobly threw himself into
the breach and faced the foe.
“I’m looking forward to 1950,” he
said calmly.
“You think that by then we'll be
able to avenge the defeat of 1926?”
“That wasn't exactly in my mind.”
“Then why 1950? I do not grasp
your point.”
“Because with any luck you'll be
dead then, Dolby.”
Dolby spends his evenings in the

discussion is impossible in the smoke-
room. His first break—on Welsh Dis-
establishment—is reported to have
lasted thirty-seven minutes and reduced

WOOLCOMBIS WOOD AGAIN.

Though to the world it seems fictitious

So off I set to seek in Woolcombe Wood
That baby unicorn (see recent issue").
All afternoon I rummaged bush and

I chirruped softly this way and the
other,
Till, when my confidence was getting
thin,
I saw, through lichened trunks, the
baby's mother i -
A mongrel-looking brute, with tufted
tail; -
Her hide was white, but weather-
worn and grimy;
Her horn was scarlet-tipped, and, like
a flail, ->

by me.
She bleated harshly, like a thing dis-
tressed,
And while I stood, as curious as may
be,
It dawned upon me that she shared
my quest—
The mother, too, was searching for
the baby.
Through tangled groves that bleating
came and went,
Importunate, monotonous, depress-
ing,
Till aſſat once she thrilled with quick
content
And nuzzling sounds of unicorns
caressing.
Though maids have power the unicorn
to tame— - -
Or so we read in legends of roman

claim,
So home I trudged, deciding not to
chance it.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. GEORGE RUSSELL has a happy knack of inventing
quaint titles for the volumes in which are garnered for the
instruction and delight of posterity his contributions to the
contemporary Press. His latest, Half Lengths (GRANT-
RICHARDs), contains only a moderate proportion of snippets
a newspaper column long and is to that extent better than
some of its predecessors. The more generous space afforded
by monthly magazines has given fuller opportunity of
doing justice to his themes. The volume opens with a
striking appreciation and comparison of two Cardinals,
NEwMAN and WiseMAN. Better still is the study of the
character of the late Duke of DEvoNSHIRE, who, as Lord
HARTINGTON, through troublous times maintained at its
highest level the tone of English Parliamentary life and
statesmanship. The characteristics of the first Lord
CoLERIDGE and the only HENRY LABouchERE are sketched
with light but informing touch. Best of all, where all is
good, are the miniatures of the WILBERForces, “a family
which for a hundred-and-thirty continuous years has served
England with soul and speech.” The founder was the
emancipator of the slaves. One of his sons was SAMUEL,
Bishop of Oxford, of whom Mr. RussBLL contrives to write
without quotation of an alliterative nickname, which over
a trivially-minded but numerically large circle has done
i much to obscure the qualities and achievements of 3 great
man. One of Bishop WILBERForce's sons, Archdeacon of
Westminster, to-day lends dignity and spiritual grace to
the chaplaincy of the House of Commons. The chapter on
Lord WolverHAMPTON is invested with the pungency of
a gay spitefulness. It was, I believe, originally written
for the Life of the statesman better known as HENRY
Fowler, compiled by a dutiful daughter, which shows how
Mr. Russell's humour occasionally borders on the reckless.
If, wandering over Polynesian Seas, you overheard some-
body say, “Taloſa!” to somebody else, and the second
party replied, “Jorana!” would you immediately understand
that the last speaker came from the island of Huahine?
You would not ? Well, Mr. JACK LoNDoN would. As far
as I can gather from A Son of the Sun (MILLS AND BooN),
the Polynesian Seas are as familiar to him as Fleet Street
to me. He knows that if you are disorderly in the Tivoli
at Apia, it is Charley Roberts who throws you out; that, at
Goboto, it is the unwritten law that white men must wear
trousers; and a thousand other facts of a similar nature.
He is a Polynesian Encyclopædia, and he presents his
knowledge to the public through the medium of a series of
short stories, dealing with the adventures of one David
Grief, a trader. The man himself is colourless, but the
adventures are hereby certified to be of the finest quality.
For sustained excitement, “The Devils of Fuatino” easily
heads the list, but I enjoyed almost as much the broad
farce of “The Feathers of the Sun.” In the former story,

David Grief) on a lofty peak. . B. cannot come down with-
out being shot; but, on the other hand, A. cannot leave the

directly under B.'s peak, and B. has a collection of dynamite

A. do? or, for the matter of that, B. 2 For solution, see

prised to hear that Myles had to negotiate a vast deal of
trouble before he was able to say to Joan Farrant, “With
you beside me, the whole world is my kingdom and you my
queen.” I can just manage to believe in this severely tried
hero, but I did from time to time find occasion to wonder
whether he was not allowing himself to bear rather too
many brunts; and his creator seems also to have thought
that he was a little too perfect, for at the very end of the
story she admits, with an abruptness that surprised me,
that he was not immaculate. Miss YouNG writes in a most
vivid manner, and her book can be warmly recommended
to anyone who is likely to be exhilarated by the spectacle
of a great fight against misfortune.
Mrs. ELINon GLYN has achieved some results in the past,
but I have my suspicions that she did so rather by good
luck than by good management, if her new volume is to
be taken as the production of her mature genius. The
title-story of The Contrast (DUCKworth) is a not very
wish it adorned a better
plot. John March, the
British Resident in a
native state, met Lynne
Ashburton on the voyage
to Bombay, fell in love
with her, and finally, in
order that she should be
legally provided for, mar-
ried her, though, for a
not very obvious reason,
the ceremony was kept
a profound secret, and
made no change in their
relations. After a while,
however, Lynne got
bored with this and
sailed for England, leav-
ing a note to tell March
that she had married
Lord Dorrington, and
that he'd better hold his

enlivening conversation
between a benedict and
his mistress, disclosing
no new thoughts on the
situation and showing
no new characteristics in
the parties, except a ten-
dency in the lady to a
domestic virtue alien to
the class. The “Point
of View" is the sort of
story that anybody might
write, but most people
wouldn't, not because
they dared not, but be-
cause they hadn't the
time to waste. All that
the Canon's niece, the
Bishop's Chaplain and
the spurious foreign
Count said, thought and
did has been said,
peace about the former
little affair. Which he did ; and that was his “silence.”
And then, years afterwards, when he had fallen in love
with somebody else, whom he couldn't marry without
being a bigamist and couldn't undeceive without smash-
ing the Dorringtons' heir, it quite casually turns out that
Lynne had been married to yet another husband before she
met March. Well, I have often been impressed by “the
silence of men,” but I found the silence of this much-
wedded woman simply staggering. For all that, and
despite some irritating mannerisms and affectations (ex-
emplified by such phrases as “an official reception was
a very lion's mouth of ennui," and others equally uneasy),
I should call the book well worth reading for its graphic
pen-pictures of Indian scenes and character, drawn by one
having an obviously first-hand acquaintance with Empire-
13uilders.
Tor the sake of Judges and other guileless people, I ought
to say that the letters of the title of Myles Calthorpe, I.D.B.
(John LANE), do not represent a distinction given for services
to the state, but stand for Illicit Diamond Buyer. Yet a
glance at the picture of Myles, on the cover of the book,
will convince you that, although he might be a fast and
tricky wing three-quarter he could never wittingly have

thought and done a
thousand times before in books. “Fragments” is un-
doubtedly the best of a bad lot. I cannot say that I was
greatly pleased when Sir John called Winnifred “his
darling white dove,” but there was about that bird at least
a touch of the ingenuous which was very refreshing.
Mr. E. C. BENTLEY is shrewd enough to know that the
cxperienced reader of a novel dealing with a murder will
inevitably suspect from the start the person with the best
alibi. That is to say, if a millionaire is found shot on his
lawn the probability is that the culprit is the private
secretary who, setting out before the tragedy takes place,
spends the night motoring to Southampton—six hours
away—and duly reports his arrival there. Mr. BENTLEY
sees that this is expected of him, so he accepts the situation
and does not make very much of a mystery of that part of
the narrative, though he packs the investigations of Trent,
his amateur detective, full of exciting ingenuities. The real
interest of Trent's Last Case (NELsoN) centres round the
motive of the crime, and only when you get to the last three
or four pages do you find that, after all—— But to tell
that here would be to spoil an excellent story, told with a
rare distinction. I wish Mr. BENTLEY would relate some of
Trent's earlier cases, or let him take up some more as a
post-nuptial hobby.

BRIGHTER CRICKET.
“You heard me quite well, Mary. Cricket. That was
what I said. I shall take up cricket again. No, I'm not a bit
too old. Nobody is. You can have all sorts of cricket, you
know, Mary. There's the cricket you teach your children,
and there's village cricket, which was once played on
village greens with the Squire and the Rector looking on
and all the boys joining in the sport, and the blacksmith
(there was always a blacksmith) hitting three or four
almighty swipes and then getting bowled by a silly lob;
and there's school cricket and club cricket, and country-
house cricket, and county cricket, and university cricket,
and lots of other cricket—soldiers' cricket and sailors'
cricket. Doesn't it make you think of hot days, and the
jolly smell of the pads, and the crisp grass, and the taste
of shandy-gaff out of a long glass? Don't say shandy-
gaff's not your tipple, Mary. It's really everybody's
tipple, and you'll learn to like it some day. Bless me,
how it gurgles down! -
“Mary, I hit an eight once. I give you my sacred word
of honour I did—fully run out it was and no overthrows.
Don't ask me how I did it. Nobody knows how he does
these things. They just happen. This happened in a
House match at school. I suppose the ball picked out the
one place on the bat and the bat got the ball on the very
nick, and away it went and away we went, and before the
ball got to the wicket we'd run eight. That's the sort of
memory that'll stay you up when you come to your last
gasp and wonder if you couldn't have done things better.
“There was a chap at Cambridge–Smith was his name;
it really was and whenever I hear the word “Fenner's ' I
can see him quite plainly walking about with his quick
step and hear him shouting out, ‘Card of the match,
gentlemen.' It all comes over me like a dream. I wonder
if he's at it still. Perhaps he's selling cards for some
great match in the Elysian fields. We were all young then,
Mary, and we took things as they came, and we didn't
mind sitting and watching and watching, for it's the best
game in the world to watch. - *- ~, -----.
“What do they want to brighten cricket for? Cricket
isn't an old tin-can or a musical comedy or a pleasant
Sunday afternoon. Cricket's a jolly deliberate affair, with
good sound rules for keeping it so and preventing the
hustlers from getting hold of it and ruining it. Cricket's
like life. It spreads out and you’ve time to turn round in
it and room to take your ease and look forward to things.
It bores you, does it? That just proves how right it is.
You want thrills and shocks and ecstasies and corybantic
danees—but that's just what you won't get in cricket,
thank heaven. : Yes, you’re quite right. You have heard
me mention CoppeN and his three wickets at the end of
the match, but that was an exception. You can't arrange
a team to be all Cobdens, and if you could you wouldn't
get your thrills all the time. Besides, you couldn't stand
it if you had it all vicissitudes of that kind.
“But I'll tell you another thing. Cricket's one of our
few surviving English institutions. When you're travelling
abroad and think of England what comes into your mind?
I'll mention one or two things. There's breakfast—fried
soles and bacon and eggs with marmalade to top up with.
There's wearing knickerbockers and comfortable boots in
the country. There's going to the Derby. It doesn't
matter a bit if you've never gone to Epsom in your life.
When you're abroad you'll begin to think of the Derby as
one of the things worth seeing. I've seen a meek little
Professor in Constantinople simply pining for the Derby.
And then there's cricket—you can't transplant it. French-
men and Germans and Russians won't play it, but it suits
us, with its profoundly interesting tediousness, its science,
its skill, its clean neatness, its white flannels and its smooth
green turf. Down with all nonsense about brightening
it, say I.”

ONCE upon a time there was a patch of dog violets
growing on a bank in March. They were very beautiful
but they had no scent, and the country people, knowing
this, passed them by. Day after day the flowers heard
scornful remarks about themselves. “They're only dog
violets,” said one of the knowing country people. “Don’t
bother about them,” said another. “I know where there's
real violets,” said a third ; “come on 1 ''
likes to be overlooked and despised, even though attention
should mean destruction, the dog violets were very unhappy.
“As if perfume was everything!” they said; while one of
them went so far as to declare that she always found the
scent of the other kind of violet overpowering. “A strong
scent is so vulgar,” she added. “Yes,” said another, “and
so are rich colours. Pale tints are much more artistic.”
One day the princess came driving along in her gold
coach from the royal city near by, and seeing the patch of
flowers on the bank she gave orders for the carriage to stop.
“Oh, how beautiful!” she said, for, being a princess, she
had never seen violets growing before; she had seen only
tiger-lilies and camellias and smilax and Maréchal Niels.
“How beautiful!" she cried as her lord chamberlain brought
her a great bunch. “They're only dog violets,” he said,
for he was well versed in all lore; “they have no scent.”
“The darlings!” she cried. “It wouldn't matter if they
had, I’ve got such an awful cold; ” and she pressed them
to her white bosom, where in an ineffable rapture of pride
and content they swooned away.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FAIRY TALE.
ONCE upon a time there was a man
called James Carmichael, and he was a
miser. Like all misers, he could not
help it; but, unlike most misers, he was
not really very rich, for he was too
careful. He saved everything, even
tram-tickets, which he used as book-
markers, and old envelopes, on which
he wrote letters to people who did not
matter. He had an office high up in a
big building; it was very small and he
had only a few clerks to help him;
when there was any more work to do
he did it himself.
Now it happened that some people
who were sorry for old bachelors asked
James Carmichael to dinner on Christ-
mas Day, and as this did not cost him
anything he went. He disliked it very
much at first, but in the end he quite
enjoyed it, and when he got home he
fell asleep in his chair. And while he
was asleep a dwarf appeared and
talked to him. The dwarf was very
cheerful and very rude, and he would
not go away until James Carmichael

had given him a promise. The promise
was that for a whole week he would be
kind to the people whom he disliked
most, and the people he disliked most
were Travellers, who used to come to
his office and try to sell him things
which he did not want. He hated these
people so much that he was frightened
of them; they were never allowed to
see him, and there was a brass plate on
the office door telling them to go away.
But when he went back to the office
after Christmas he had the brass plate
taken down, and the Travellers soon
began to come in.
On the first day he bought a type-
writer and three bunches of lavender
and a packet of hooks to hang coats
and hats on ; on the second day a lady
sold him enough soap to last the office
for a year, and he had to give a lot of
Christmas-boxes and subscriptions.
He found that when these people
came in and made speeches to him, he
could not refuse them; he bought an
atlas, and two waste-paper baskets,
and a directory. So it went on, until

THE gifted writer who presides over

curious fears of men who are accounted
fearless. “Personally,” he observes,
“with no pretence to special bravery,
I would rather grapple with a mad dog
than take in my hand a live sparrow
or any such harmless animal that—
squirms.”
As the result of inquiries addressed
to a number of intrepid and eminent
public characters, Mr. Punch is enabled
to lay before his readers the following
interesting revelations of idiosyncrasy—
Mr. ALGERNoN Ashton writes: “In
spite of the views of a recent musical
essayist in The Times, I would rather
face a mad bull with no other weapon
than a tuning-fork than listen for five
minutes to a Rag-time march.”
Sir HENRY HoworTH sends a long
communication on the subject which
we have been obliged to condense.
The gist of it is that he would rather
grapple single-handed with a mammoth
than write a letter to The Times con-
taining fewer than 2000 words.

PREMATURE PROGRESS.

(Drivers and conductors of the horse tramways at Orford
went on strike on Easter Monday for improved working
conditions).
FROM change to moving change the world goes on,
Even at Carfax nothing keeps the same,
For Daphnis is not—Daphnis, who would ply,
Urging his antic trolley fleet as flame,
His prancing coursers up and down the High
Unwearyingly, is gone;
Evanished only now the casual bike,
The hansom and the taxi throng the Corn;
Rusted the metal tracks, the grooves forlorn,
For Daphnis and his friends are out on strike.
Runs it not here, the route from Cowley Road 2
And ofttimes punters on the flowery Cher,
Lifting their hands to wipe away a midge,
Have watched the progress of his stately car
Mounting the steep ascent to Magdalen Bridge;
And oft with joyous load
Of married dons have we beheld it fill
(Speaking just now of the North Oxford branch)
Or emptying from its top an avalanche
Of female undergrads, from Somerville.
But sudden on a morn of wind-swept March,
When term was o'er and all the men were down,
And daffodils were selling fairly cheap
But sparslier bloomed the academic gown,
Something aroused the tramcars from their sleep.
They stopped—they stuck like starch:
A rumour went upon the breeze, a cry
Of things that happen here in London town,
And each conductor mused, his punch laid down,
They blooming well strike: blooming well strike I.
Too swift reformerl wherefore art thou out 2
Soon shall the high mechanic pomps come on,
Electric road-cars with suspended wires
The business tutor and the commerce don,
The hurrying Change that echoes and perspires,
And stocks in flagrant rout;
Then shalt thou learn what labour movements ale
And hope to paralyse our industries,
Mass-meetings underneath the Wychwood trees
And full reports in the pink evening Star.
Till then forbear: our feverish unions spurn,
As some grave scholar in his morning shect
Espies an education paragraph
Saying the classic tongues are now effete,
And hands it, smiling, to his better half:
And both without concern
Resume their breakfast of uncrumpling eggs
Like fallen blossoms in the bacon's shade,
Pass and repass the amber marmalade
And drain the immortal coffee to its dregs,
So thou too, Daphnis, to thy task again!
Emerge and travel on the dreaming rails,
And trot the unpermitted lorry out
When morning lights the sky or evening pales
Still bearing the indomitable scout;
Shake out once more thy rein,
And snatch the platform and resume thy load
Of lady shoppers from the muslin marts
And young light-hearted Masters of the Arts
And set them down upon the Banbury Road. Evor.
LITERARY GOSSIP.
(By Our Tame Twaddler.)
Sir Castor Royle, the famous sportsman author, recently
made a remarkable journey to the basin of the Bongo. He
and his comrades passed through the gorge of Umpi as well
as the impenetrable forests of Gobolu, inhabited by cannibal
pygmies, gorillas and cuneiform quaggas. Sir Castor has
written a charming account of his experiences under the
title, How I Became a Cannibal. The book will be shortly
published by the firm of Mandible and Champ, but cannot
be recommended to persons with weak digestions—at least
so says Mr. Goodleigh Champ, who is a man of iron
constitution. -
The interesting series of articles on the golf-links of Tibet,
which recently appeared in The Chimes, will shortly be pub-
lished in book form by PUTTMANs. In an interesting preface
the author, Mr. Isaac Newton, explains how, when he was
commissioned by the editor to go to Tibet to write about
its golf-links, he expressed some scepticism as to whether
they existed at all, but that the Editor cheerily reassured
him at once by saying, “What matter? You can always
fall back on the GRAND LAMA.” As it turned out, golf is
strictly forbidden by the municipal authorities in Lhasa,
but this did not prevent Mr. Isaac Newton from writing a
series of breezy letters on the costume, poetry and cookery
of the country. Mr. Newton has added fresh lustre to the
somewhat tarnished laurels of his forgotten ancestor.
The Grand Duke Melchior is about to join the ranks of
golfing littérateurs. For some years past he has kept an
accurate record of every game he has, played, with the
number of strokes to each hole, witty remarks made by his
caddies, etc., and these narratives, profusely illustrated with
snapshots by the Grand Duchess, have now been embodied
in a volume with the attractive title, From 150 to 100; or,
How I Brought My Handicap Down to 20. Being a strictly
veracious man the Grand Duke has not refrained from
giving the objurgations and expletives wrung from him in
moments of anguish, but in deference to the feelings of the
gentle reader these are all printed in Russian characters.
Mr. Phil. Jungsen, the famous author of Essays of a
Quick Luncher, The Shingles of Pain, and other books
that count, has written a philosophical treatise which
Chickweeds will soon issue under the title of The Life
Precious, in which the writer maintains that self-respect
can be maintained only by those who have mastered the art
of expressing themselves with serenity, clarity and pontifical
finality. Mr. Roland Chickweed, in an open letter to the
Press, affirms that the book has moved him to frequent
tears; and to any one who knows that redoubtable publisher
the assertion speaks volumes for the soul-shaking quality
of Mr. Jungsen's prose. The volume will be bound in limp
moleskin and will contain a portrait of the author in fancy
dress as Caesar Borgia.
Mr. Lemuel Poff, to whom we shall be always grateful
|for his vivid romance, The Man with the Single Spat, has
completed a new novel which the Odders will shortly
publish under the alluring title of The Rotters. Mr. Odder,
who ought to know, declares that it is the most arresting
study of miasmatic decadence that has yet appeared in
English. Mr. Poff, it should be remembered, is the author
of that memorable reply to a critic who begged him to
abstain from excessive realism. “Why,” he gaily observed,
“all my books are Bowdlerized–or at least Baudelairized.”

The palms, the huts were sleeping,
When suddenly I all but screamed—
Part of my shoe was creeping !

A meshed and interwoven track

House of Commons, Easter Monday.
—Whilst London makes holiday at
Hampstead and eke at Greenwich the
faithful Commons, like the whining
schoolboy with his satchel and shining
morning face, creep unwillingly to
school at Westminster. Story set afloat
that the Opposition have arranged
ambush, meaning at unexpected mo-
ment to swoop down and defeat
Government on snap division. Only
their fun. Fair muster on Ministerial
Benches; Opposition camp practically
deserted.
Notable absence discovered when, on
looking towards the Chair, Members
find it occupied by DEPUTY SPEAKER.
Universal sorrow on hearing explana-
tion that the SPEAKER has met with
motor accident, spraining his right
wrist and compelling temporary retire-
ment. Nasty accident, but does not
chill glow of native humour. SARK
tells me that since coming down to
House he has received a note from
SPEAKER's house, evidently dictated.
By the typed signature JAMEs LowTHER
is written “his mark.”
As SARK says, not the first time this
been done. Mr. Lowther made his
mark long ago as Chairman of Com-
mittees, cutting it deeper when he
came to the Chair. No light task to

sustain traditions of that lofty pedestal.
Success requires possession of rare
qualities seldom centred in an indi-
vidual. Mr. LowTHER, occasionally
tried in difficult circumstances suddenly
sprung upon the Chair, has never been
found wanting.
In spite of slack attendance (perhaps
by reason of it) great stroke of business
accomplished. First Order of Day,
Report of Vote on Account for trifle
exceeding thirty-four million sterling
for Civil Service and Revenue Depart-
ments. Vote for reduction formally
moved with object of raising debate on
various Labour questions. Not pressed
to a division and money asked for
granted.
Army votes came next, making pro-
vision for 185,600 men of all ranks
comprising land forces. Bit of a breeze
between JoyNson-Hicks and WAR
MINISTER on subject of aeroplanes.
After long silence under charges of
traitorous neglect of National safety in
matter of military aviation, SEELY the
other day confounded hostile critics by
plain tale showing that so far from
being behind other nations in this
respect the country is for its own
special purposes actually ahead of
possible rivals. For a while this gave
pause to patriots rooted in conviction
that in no conceivable circumstances
can their own country chance to be on
the right path.
To-night JoyNSoN-Hicks out again
on the old hunt. SEELY stated that
the Service had at its command 101
aeroplanes of the highest capacity and
efficiency.
“Yes,” said JoyNsoN-Hicks shrewdly,
“but can they fly?”
For a moment this inquiry cast
damper over House. DURNING-LAw-
RENCE, looking on from Distinguished
Strangers' Gallery, remembered that in
line of thought and turn of phrase it is
not quite original. In slightly differing
form BAcon used it in a famous scene
from King Henry IV.
“I can call spirits from the vasty
deep,” Glendower boasted.
“But will they come when you do call
for them?” retorted practical-minded
Hotspur. (War Office has at command
101 flying machines. But can they
fly?)
Confidence re-established by SEELY's
emphatic reply and vote agreed to
without division.
Business dome.—A good deal.

returned for Kendal, presented himself
to take oath and seat. Caution of

he selected for bodyguard two of the
tallest, most stalwart Members. Cir-
cumstances of his election peculiar.
Standing as Candidate wearing the
colours of a Party which, as Lord
DERBY said the other day, is firmly
re-united on Tariff Reform question, he
declared himself a Free Trader, and was
straightway renounced by the Party
Organisation. His reception conse-
quently dubious in .3ticipation.
Walking up to Table between CAVEN-
DISH BENTINCR and SANDERSON.—Duke
of York Columns of the Unionist Party—
his figure, unduly stunted by contrast,
was at least safe. When thus escorted
he crossed the Bar, there burst forth
a demonstration without parallel in
memory of oldest Member. The
CoLoREI, had not only beaten off the
Liberal Candidate, but had increased
the Unionist majority. Following
ordinary practice, here was established
claim to a Party welcome even warmer
than ordinary. . . . -
Opposition remained ominously dumb.
Uncanny silence was, after almost im-
lº pause, broken by hilarious
burstofeheering from the Ministerialists,
echoed from benches below Gangway
opposite crowded by Irish National-
ists. Cheering, mingled with laughter,
continued during the march to the
Table; renewed when new Member
was introduced to SPEAKER and retired
to find a place among the silent ranks
of the Opposition. ſ: - .
CLERK of THE House unexpectedly
rounded off excellent bit of fooling. As
soon as Member for Kendal disappeared
Orders of the Day were called on. Sir
CourTENAY ILBERT, rising, named the
first on list— -
“Mental Deficiency Bill.”
This one of those little jokes whose
subtlety, inexplicable to outsiders,
hugely delights Members. To attempt
to dissect it would be hopeless. There
it was. Tenewed roar of laughter
burst forth. Joined in by Opposition,
it exceeded in heartiness what had gone
before. -
Business done.—Consolidated Fund
Bill read a second time. FoEEIGN SEC-
RETARY seized opportunity of making
important statement heralding speedy
settlement of War in the Balkans.
Wednesday.—“Such larks,” as Joe
Gargery used to say to Pip in their
confidential chats.
House met in anticipation of hearing
the WINSoME WINSTON expound his
Naval policy for forthcoming year.
Benches crowded, notably on Opposi-
tion side. Before WINSTON rose
Ministers thought it well to get the
Consolidated Fund Bill through Com-
mittee stage. A mere formality.
On position had had full run on Second
Reading. So with light heart House
got into Committee.
“Clause I.,” said the Chairman. “The
question is that Clause I. stand part of
the Bill.”
Ministerialists hardly took the trouble
to cry “Yes!" Of course it would be
agreed to, seeing that it is the opera-
tive clause without which the Bill must
be dropped and the whole services of
the State, civil and military, come to a
standstill. Sharp on the perfunctory
“Yes | " of Ministerialists followed
thunderous cry of “No!" from the
massed ranks in Opposition.
The new boy from Kondal.
Sudden light broke over Treasury
Bench. Trapped again! Opposition
evidently mustered in full number.
Ministerialists, not suspecting danger,
were at the moment actually in a
minority. If division were forthwith
taken the Government would be de-
feated, and must go, carrying with
them the tottered fabric of their ini-
quitous schemes.
Booth, fresh from protecting
ATToRNEY - GENERAI, in Committee
Room from , attack by DENNIson
FABER, saved the situation. If division
could be delayed for half-an-hour,
even fifteen minutes, the straggling
stream of Ministerialists would add
sufficient force to swamp the Opposition.
Even as he spoke, amid useful inter-
ruption which undesignedly helped to
serve his purpose, it seemedit was already
achieved. IILINGworTH, running in from
Whips' room, was understood to bring
tidings that the majority was assured.
“To mak siccar,” as the Scottish
chieftain explained when he went back
to thrust his dirk in the throat of the
king's enemy already slain, MASTERMAN
rose to add a few words. Interposition |
met by angry cries from gentlemen
opposite who saw their triumph slip-
ping away. These merged in roar of
execration when MASTERMAN scornfully
alluded to “some things too discredit-
able even for a discredited Opposition.”
There followed uproarious scene,
ended by a division which gave the
Government, but latcly in extreme
peril, a majority of 39. º
After this it was something of an
anti-climax for MooRE of North Armagh
to get suspended for describing action
of MASTERMAN as “a piece of disgraceful
trickery,” and for ALBERT MARKHAM,
not to be out of the joy-ride, to
beseech honourable gentlemen opposite
“not to make the House of Commons
into a pot-house.”
On successive divisions Government
majority ran up to 113 and 133. Order
reigned in Westminster. But eight
o'clock had struck when, in a com-
paratively thin House, WINSTON rose
to make his long-expected speech.
Business done.—Consolidated Fund

THE ADDRESS.
HAROLD is one of the very worst
imbeciles I have ever met.
I don't say this merely because I
happen to live with him, but after a
long course of infallible proofs.
My friend Mrs. Weston gives dances,
but in other respects she is quite nice.
I dined there three weeks ago and was
secured for one of her dances. As I
was going away, she said:
“Can you bring another man with
Ou ?”
I thought a moment. “Yes,” I said,
“I will bring Harold, alive or dead.”
“Give me his name and address, then,
and I’ll send him a card.”
Harold believes that he has given up
| dancing. When he received the card
| he looked as if his past had risen and
! struck him in the face.
When I ex-
plained, I thought he was going to do
the same for me.
“I’m sorry,” I said, “but I've
promised you now.”
“You talk as if you were my god-
fathers and godmothers,” he said
bitterly.
“No,” I said, “only your fairy god-
mother. One man can't do every-
thing; but I assure you both Mrs.
Weston and her dances are charming,
and as for the supper, recherché isn't
the word for it.”
“I’m glad of that,” said Harold,
“for it is a bad word.”
Finally he consented to go.
I spent the next ten days asking
Harold whether he had answered the
invitation. On the eleventh he actually
began toying with some notepaper. I
was just going out when this occurred,
but I stayed to dictate a nice apologetic
little note about his having just got
back from Switzerland, and wrap it up
in a neat envelope.
As I went out he shouted after me:
“What's the address 2'"
Our cards had been lost and I have
never remembered an address in my
life. I have only one answer to such
questions.
“Look it up,” I said, “in the
Telephone Directory.”
When I came back he had an air of
guilty self-satisfaction.
“Did you post that letter, Harold 2"
I asked sternly.
“I did,” said Harold.
Some days later I found a letter on
Harold's plate from the KING. It was
marked “Returned Postal Packet.”
Harold came down at last; and his
face as he opened it was a study of
innocent wonderment.
“Gracious !” he said.

He handed the contents to me, and
I looked. It was a rather tired-looking
letter addressed as follows:—

after all; but I very nearly took him

“THE HAPPY ISLAND.”
(4 Memory, in Two Scenes, of
Mr. J. B. FMGAN's play
at His Majesty's.)
SCENE I.-A IRoom in Andrew Rem-
mington's house. Andrew and his
Wife are discovered chatting over
their coffee.
Andrew. By the way, dear, if you
can spare me a moment, I should just
like to tell you about my island.
Clair (bored). Why?
Andrew. Well, dash it, the audience
has got to know somehow. Besides,
you invested that hundred for me in
Aerated Breads so cleverly when I was
away that I have decided to consult
you in all my business affairs in future.
Clair. Oh, go on. -
Andrew. Well, briefly the situation is
this. There's a pitch-blende mine in
this island, and if I could only get the
natives to work it I could make millions.
But they won't; they're afraid of it.
I tried for eight months to make them,
and it was no good. (Coming closer to
her.) But, darling, a very strange
thing happened to me in those eight
months. I don't know if it was some-
thing in the air . . . or in the pitch-
blende . . . or what, but I found that
I loved you. Clair, dear-
Clair. Don't be absurd, Andrew. You
njust know it's useless.
Andrew (gripping her by the arm).
Useless? What do you mean? (His
mind working rapidly.) Ha! You love
another! I guessed as mºch. Some-
body rang you up from the Bath Club

there to persuade them that he is a
god. Then he could make the men
obey him. (Apologetically.) It sounds
silly, I know.

SCENE II. — The Island. At the
entrance to a cave leading into
the mine, an enormous stone idol
stands, reminding one faintly, of
various friends. Derek is dis-
covered with his two companions
—Baxter, an engineer, and Hall,
an artist.
Derek. I think all is ready now, if
you will kindly summon the natives.
As soon as they are here, I shall blow
the idol up with dynamite and emerge
mysteriously from the cave. The
illusion will be helped by the fact that
the natives have not yet seen me; and
they will take me for a god.

[APRIL 2, 1913.
ON THE BEAUTY OF HAVING
TWO DENTISTS.
I Used to employ them alternately,
with the strictest impartiality. I may
say that I have never had the slightest
preference for one over the other, Ad-
mittedly, A. has a much better selection
of magazines in his waiting-room, and
I also prefer his conversation, which is
remarkably intelligent. But B. fully
compensates for that by the excellence
of the view from the window opposite
his chair, and, besides, he takes two
daily papers. I first gave up the
alternative method when B. came to
grief over a golden crown which he
jammed on to one of my back teeth,
driving it home with a hammer at con-
siderable personal inconvenience to me.
When it came off at the end of three
weeks, I should, of course, have gone
back to B. . It was his crown, and it
was his business to see it through. But
I was annoyed about it, and I went to
A. It appeared that he had a very
poor opinion of gold crowns. After that
I introduced a method of recognising
merit, which seemed to me perfectly
fair to both of them. On the whole
I may say that it has worked well.
Whenever either of them can put me
right for a clear run without toothache
for six months or more—I have abom-
inable teeth—I go back to him on the
next occasion. But if the run is less
than six months I go to the other.
You will observe that the scoring is
rather after the style of that adopted at
Racquets or Fives. You are “in” just
as long as you can keep on making
ints. -
A. and B. are of course quite un-
known to each other. I maintain the
strictest reticence with each of them as
to my dental adventures with his col-
league. Even in the case of the crown
I offered no explanation as to how it
had got there. But I always like to
observe the eager way in which they
begin by making a hasty survey of my
mouth to see what has happened there
since they last inspected it. And I
always imagine them—amiable as they
both are in temperament—to be won-
dering why it is that in the intervals
between my visits I allow some in-
competent bungler to interfere. Per-
haps one or other would protest, but
then of course they don't know who it
is. It might be the greatest swell in
the trade—I mean to say one of the
leading specialists.
The upshot is that my teeth are well
looked after. Ignorant as the two
rivals are of the precise method of
scoring, they are both jolly keen to
score. They hunt out every vestige of
decay in my mouth and pounce upon
the slightest discrepancy. And if one
of them can find a hole that has been
missed by the other, he simply gloats.
I sometimes fear that this healthy
competition may be carried too far.
I mean to say that there is a danger
that they will begin stopping sound
teeth as a precautionary measure, for
fear the other fellow will get hold of
them. I don't want to accuse either of
them of being mercenary, but you see
I am a sort of little gold-mine to any
dentist. -
And then I like to observe their
little differences in style and tempera-
ment. A. is eminently dashing and
vigorous and scores rapidly all round
the mouth. He likes to have three or
four teeth in hand at the same time,
covering up one while he visits another.
He is never sure about B.'s stoppings.
He doesn't think them durable. He
sometimes puts in some punishing
work with the drill, but he always
makes a point of giving you due notice
before he hurts you. B. hurts you first
and then apologises; he hasn't the
same pluck. He is afraid that if he
gives you any warning you will get out
of hand. He is a very sympathetic,
cautious, plodding sort of fellow, and
he is never sure about A.'s stoppings;
he doesn't think them durable. If he
has a fault it is that he is altogether
too fond of that beastly little wire, like
a pipe-cleaner, with which he prods for
hidden nerves.
It depends partly on one's mood.
There are days when I can thoroughly
enter into the bustle and exhilaration
of A.'s impetuous attack; there are
days when I would rather entrust
myself to the soothing hand of B.
The score is 5 all at present and the
game is 7 up.

THE CHEMIST'S DREAM.
THREE stars shone out with a baleful
glare, - -
Scarlet and green and blue, ,
And a medley of perfumes smote the air,
Lavender, musk and rue.
And the chemist shook, for a nameless
fright
Harried his evening walk,
And his face grew pale in the ghostly
light,
Like camphorated chalk.
He was sick to death, he was sore afraid,
For he knew from his sense of smell
That he'd come to the dread phenacetin
glade
Where the Haemogoblins dwell.
Swift and light as the wind-blown chaff
They crowded the path he trod,
With a shriek of joy and a ghoulish laugh
That cracked like a senna pod.
He heard the patter of elfin shoes,
As he fled in that breathless sprint,
And he felt the grip of a deſt-flung noose
Of salicylic lint.
They have trussed him tight with boric
gauze -
To a eucalyptus tree,
With a looſah gag betwixt his jaws
And a bandage round his knee.
Cold ran his blood as a toilet cream,
And the sweat like a perfume spray,
When he saw the glycero-phosphates
gleam
And the trail of powders grey.
And he thought with grief of the life
he'd led,
Of his homoeopathic pills,
Of the times he had stolen a doctor's
bread
Prescribing for coughs and chills;
Of the poor little babes who tossed and
turned
In their eagerness to toothe,
Diminutive mites who yowled and
yearned
For syrups that really soothe.
And he groaned as he thought of the
stout and spare
Who'd sampled his make-shift stuff,
Of the bald old colonels who hoped for
hair
On the strength of a printed puff.
Then away to covert the goblins race,
But the chief of the pygmy band
Draws near with a smile on his wizened
face
And a nightlight in his hand.
The fuse is fired, the flamelets start
On their journey of spark and smoke—
When just at the really crucial part
The chemist suddenly woke.

our BookING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. JEFFERY FARNoL is the Red Queen. Never have I
been hurried along in such amazing fashion as I was by the
author of The Amateur Gentleman (SAMPson Low), who,
taking me with one hand, and Barnabas Barty with the
other, showed how the son of John Barty (ex-champion of
England and landlord of “The Coursing Hound") came in
for a legacy of seven hundred thousand pounds, went forth
from his home and, confuting his father's prophecy, became
not the least of the Regency bucks. Egad, Sirs! but we
went the pace. Foiled villains, now aristocrats, now cut-
purses, fell away behind us like hoof-spurned mud; romantic
assignations, rescues of the fair, we took in our easy stride;
Bow Street runners shouted helplessly in our wake; we
diced, we steeplechased, we duelled, for all but six hundred
pages without a pause for a lemon or a sponge. And, oh,
the brave spirit and the air of it all. Mr. JEFFERY FARNoL
flicks aside probability with an elegant handkerchief; he
takes a coincidence as easily as a pinch of snuff. He
arranges to restore a long-lost daughter or frustrate a
murder between two mouthfuls of a mighty round of beef.
Well, well. And if we didn't see Barnabas Barty walking
arm-in-arm with the First Gentleman in Europe at the end,
we married him at least to the fairest lady in England, and
what more do you want than that? But I can tell you I
was devilish out of breath before it was done.
In The Combined Maze (HUTchINson) Miss MAY SIN-
CLAIR has given us a story of sombre and relentless realism,
set in the unpromising scenery of Wandsworth and of
Southfields, that “Paradise of Little Clerks.” That the
lower middle classes may furnish as good a theme as you
can want for high romance she abundantly proved in The
Divine Fire; but here she rejects all beauty of imagination,
except in the character of one girl, a sort of serious Wendy,
who mothers the young man of the book. This hero, a
shining light of the Polytechnic Gymnasium, belongs to a
type hitherto, as far as I know, unexplored. A keen and
clean-hearted enthusiast for physical culture, with definite
ideals of “decency" and a profound contempt for all forms
of “flabbiness,” he is the last person you would expect to
fall under the fascination of a merely erotic woman. Yet
he commits this error; and, foreseeing the possible result
(as they never do in books or on the stage), he insists,
against her will, in trying to repair his mistake by marriage.
In the end his very virtue, assisted by the worst of luck, is
his undoing.
I am so familiar with Miss SINCLAIR's power of projecting
herself, by sheer force of imagination, into circumstances
of which she cannot have had any personal knowledge that
I was quite prepared for her to give me a very probable
account of the sort of event in which I am certain that she
never took an active part—namely, a hurdle-race. But
for once her creative gift was at fault. I can assure her,
from experience, that in such competitions a runner's
attention is too closely fixed upon his immediate purpose
to be distracted by the waving of any woman's handker-
chief. Perhaps she will also accept my authority for the
statement that there is no tram-line that goes to Putney
Heath. But these are very small trifles; and for all that

One defect, however, she retains. In her passionate anxiety
to be masculine at all costs, she is apt to overlook the best
feature of the male mind—its regard for reticence.
The house-party that Arnold Calthrop, assembled at
Monkshill must have been a singularly unpleasant one for
everybody, but more especially for Madeline Newmarch.
The position was that Arnold and his wife Lily detested
each other, but, in order that sufficient show of respect-
ability might be kept up to allow of his inclusion in a
Radical Cabinet, they had agreed to join forces for this
entertainment. Now Lily, who, besides being a fool, drank
heavily, had taken a violent fancy to Madeline and insists
that the latter's presence was the only thing that would
keep her responsible during the week. The trouble was
that Madeline, as nice a woman as need be, had already
fallen violently in love with Calthrop and he with her. So
there you are What should M. do? I may add that
the situation occurs in The Right Honourable Gentleman

Mr. E. F. BENSON keeps us learned clerks very busy, but,
as far as I at any rate am concerned, he is welcome. He
has an almost uncanny and certainly delightful insight into
people's mental insides and, except that he can never deny
himself an aristocratic lineage or two, he deals in those
commonplace souls with which for the most part we have
to live and which we want to understand. There are plenty
of them in The Weaker Wessel (HEINEMANN), and there is
also a very disturbing element in the less usual Harry
Whittaker, the brilliant dramatist. Meteoric success in any
line is an easy and frequent affair in novels, but in his case
it is amply justified and compensated; his greatness is not
thrust upon him but is part of his nature, his weak and
vicious self. The unswerving affection of his wife, a virtue
admirable in life but dullish to contemplate in the ordinary
way, is made remarkable here by her intimate knowledge of
his failings, his love of the bottle and the other woman in
particular. Eleanor is as startling, yet credible, as Harry
up to a point; it is only when she takes to the stage and
leaps into immediate and remunerative popularity herself
that one begins to have one's doubts of her. This she should

a telegram on the first morn-
ing! What came of it all I
won't reveal; the interest is
so well kept up by a suffici-
ency of unexpected incidents
that I should be spoiling
your pleasure. There is at
least one character, Calthrop
himself, the ex-Conservative
who became a Radical-
Socialist, that seems worthy
with one's enjoyment of Mr.
BENSON's deft analysis of a
gifted author's exterior and
interior circumstances, a
thing which everyone who
has ever set pen to paper
(and who has not, nowa-
days?) will thoroughly ap-
preciate. There are, Ireckon,
about 132,650 words in the

he has done very well; while the attitude of his country
neighbours towards the “traitor” is wholly realistic.
Considering that Mr. FRANKFort MooRE's latest book
is almost wholly concerned with Miss FANNY BURNEY’s
Evelina, he is perhaps justified in calling it Fanny's First
Novel (Hutchinson). I assume, of course, that Mr.
BERNARD SHAw, as a matter of courtesy, was invited to
attend the christening. I have so often praised Mr.
MooRE's books that I feel licensed to make a complaint
about this one. Why then, in the name of an admirer of
Miss BURNEY, does he represent her brother as a mere
buffoon 2 Poor JAMEs, with his “nautical” wink and clap-
trap, is nothing more nor less than a figure of fun, and of
very insipid fun at that. In telling the story of the pro-
duction of Evelina Mr. MooRE succeeds in conveying the
excitement of a first creation, but for the rest he is little
more successful in his attempt to make fact into fiction
than most novelists are in trying to make fiction read as if
it were fact. I like him best when he is not dealing with
the “delightful circle which includes such interesting per-
sonages as Mrs. Thrale, Dr. Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds,
David Garrick,” etc.; but that does not prevent me from
advising those who are inquisitive about Miss BURNEY to
read this novel—always provided that they have never had
the curiosity to read Miss BURNEY herself.

We suspect that the chief objection to his being despatched
with the Catholic priest came from the Austrian Consul.

A SAD BUSINESS.
“LISTEN to this, Francesca,” I said.
“Will it take long?” she replied. “Because I happen to
be very busy.” - - *
“And that,” I said, “is just what you ought to be if you
are to appreciate what I am going to read to you.”
“Come on, then,” she said; “let us get it over quickly.”
“I am not sure,” I said, “that I like that tone. It does
not strike me as sympathetic.” - -
She opened her eyes wide, parted her lips, and yearned
forward towards me. “Now,” she said, “you can proceed.
I am brimming over with sympathy. Let me hear your
sad story and do what I can to comfort you.' ... --
“Do not glare at me,” I said. “You discompose me.
There, that's better. What I am going to read to you is
from The Daily News. It is an interview with Mr. H. E.
MoRGAN, and it is all about the sorrows and sufferings of
business men.” - - -
“But Tom doesn't suffer much,” she said. “If he has
sorrows he conceals them well.” - :
“Is your brother Tom a real business man 2'' I said.
“Yes,” she said. “He is on the Stock Exchange. He
knows a lot about shares and debentures, and he plays a
great deal of golf. He also shoots pheasants and disapproves
of the Government. Oh yes, I am sure Tom is a business
man, and a high-spirited one.” . - - - *
“But,” I urged, “he may have a secret sorrow all the
same. Even while he plays leap-frog with his companions
in the Stock Exchange a canker may be gnawing at his
vitals. His jests may be a mask. You know the clown
when he leaves the theatre and goes home—” - -
“My brother Tom is no clown,” she said with dignity.
“You must not catch me up like that,” I said. “How
do you know that he is not the saddest man in the world
when he is away from you in his lonely home?" -
“I cannot say,” she said. “I have not yet been lucky
enough to see him when he was away from me.”
“Incorrigible one,” I said. “You are pleased to be
merry. Now listen to Mr. H. E. MoRGAN. The article is
headed, “The Business Man as Hero. How he is Hampered
by his Womankind.’” -- - - -
“But Tom,” she said, “has no womankind. Tom is a
bacheldore, like Mr. Peggotty.” -
“We will leave out Tom and Mr. Peggotty,” I said, “and
we will devote ourselves to Mr. MoRGAN.” -
“No,” she said, “I will not devote myself to Mr. MoRGAN.
I will do much for you, but not that.”
“Francesca,” I said, “you shall not escape me. You
shall hear what this man says.” -
“I have been pining to hear it for half-an-hour,” she
said, “but you have refused to gratify me.”
“Then listen,” I said, “and tremble. Let me see, where
is it? ‘Marconi scenes'—no, it's not that. “Europe's
determination'—dear me, where Ah, here it is. Now
then for Mr. MoRGAN. These are his burning words: ‘I do
not ask that the business man should be coddled or kept in
cotton-wool, but I do maintain that hitherto he has had far
less than his just share of feminine support and sympathy.'
There, Francesca, what do you say to that?”
“It is most touching,” she said; “but is that all?”
“No,” I said, “worse remains behind : “When a barrister
gets his first brief, a doctor his first case, or when an artist
sells his first picture or a novelist his first book, his wife is
full of pride and joy." Is that true?”
“It may be,” she said; “but are they not all a little
young to be married ? You sold your first book long before
we met. I had no chance to be full of pride and joy.” "
“No, but you would have been, wouldn't you? Listen
again: “But when a business man gets his first “rise,”
which has, perhaps, cost him one cannot say how much
brain-power, energy and industry, he usually gets scant
appreciation from his wife. No man has to plough a more
lonely furrow than the average business man making a
career for himself.’” -
“I cannot bear much more of this,” said Francesca,
wiping her eyes. “It is most pitiful. But I shouldn't have
been like that. If you had been an average business man
and had got your first “rise' I should have spread a feast
in your honour. I should have talked of your brain-power
to everybody. I should have given the children a treat,
and should have explained to them the energy and industry,
yes, and the goodness of their father, for you are good—I
mean, you would have been good if you had been an average
business man, but as it is you are merely a writer, and—”
She broke down and sobbed.
“Thank you, Francesca,” I said. “You are slightly
confused, but you have a kind heart. I will now finish
with Mr. MoRGAN: ‘Many mothers would prefer to see
their daughters married to a failure in any of the more
showy professions than to a successful business man * …
“Mamma isn't like that,” said Francesca.
“Please do not interrupt: “Sisters are always glad for
their brother to pilot them about if he happens to be a
soldier or a sailor; but if he is merely in an office they
show no such desire.' Is that accurate 2"
“Well,” said Francesca, “there's something in it. We
do like sailors and soldiers even when they're not in
uniform. They're more ready to pilot, you know, and
they've got more time. They give their minds to piloting,
and the business man thinks it a bore. Still, business men
can be very agreeable. They've generally got lots of money,
though they don't throw it about like sailors and soldiers.”
“That may be,” I said; “but how shall we answer Mr.
MoRGAN ?” . . . ~~ . . .

not business men and we’ve no right to speak.” R. C. L.

LiveLY sympathy has been expressed
in many quarters with President Wood-
Row WILson in his toilsome endeavours
to secure suitable diplomatic repre-
sentatives for the United States at
the principal European capitals; but
this sympathy will be heightened ten-
fold when the public learns the inner
history of these negotiations. It is
generally known that Dr. ELIOT, ex-
President of Harvard, and Mr. OLNEY,
the Secretary of State in Mr. CLEVE-
LAND's Administration, aged respectively
79 and 80, both declined the honour;
but the English Press knows nothing
yet of President WooDRow WILSON's
previous conscientious efforts to secure
men for these posts who by their age
and dignity would specially appeal to
the Old World.
We have it on the best authority that
he applied to GEORGE BANCROFT (born
in 1800) and NATHANIEL HAwthor NE
(born in 1804) before making overtures
to Dr. ELIOT and Mr. Oil NEY ; also that

descent, and is animated by the keenest
sympathy for Irish Nationalist aspira-
tions. For him, therefore, to accept
the post of Ambassador at St. James's

provision of alcoholic beverages was
inevitable. Lastly, he was far too
young to accept an appointment which

THE UNSETTLER.
I HAD been house-hunting, of course
vainly, and after a long wait succeeded
in getting a fly at the village inn to
drive me to the nearest station. I don't
say I had seen nothing I liked, but
nothing that was empty. As a matter
of fact I had seen one very charming
place, but every window had an infernal
blind in it and the chimneys were
sending up their confounded smoke;
and I was in a vile temper. None the
less, when a little man in black suddenly
appeared before me and begged to be
allowed to share my cab (and its fare),

of course, sound her.” “I’ll give you
twenty-five pounds,' you say, “if you

in. The agent sends for me and tells
me the story; and I set to work. The
old lady has got to be dislodged. Now
what is it that old ladies most dislike? I
ask myself. It depends, of course; but

“Yes. It's not a profession

But you differ from other persons in
being unwilling to believe that you

my opportunity. You return to the
agent and tell him that the only house
you liked was (say) a white one at
East Windles. “It was not one on

(A Tragedy of the Line.)
OF Ceres blent and Dionysus' bloom,
Offspring of vineyards and the harvest sun,
I bought it in the Rhyl refreshment-room,
A plain sultana bun.
For this some English farmer ploughed the plain,
For this men toiled beneath an Orient flag;
My purpose was to munch it in the train
Out of a paper bag.
So far so good. I laid it by my side,
Meaning to browse at leisure, and to know
What beauties of the harem, laughing-eyed,
Lurked in the screen of dough.
Oh snobbery! Oh sad self-consciousness!
Into my carriage, whilst I still delayed,
Climbed, with exceeding care about her dress,
A glorious English maid.
I marked her face, I marked her queenly guise,
I marked her hat, and “What,” I whispered, “feed
Off bun before those proud patrician eyes—
I dare not do the deed.
“What if she lifts perchance her Norman nose,
As who should say, “A churl of loutish kind,
He eats his food from paper bags!’” I roso,
I left my targe behind.
I rose and went into the corridor
And found a carriage sacred to the pipe.
The bag? The paper bag?' 'Twas not my store;
Some proletariat type
Had left it on the seat, a cast-off shame;
I found it when I took the train at Rhyl.
Ugh ! the vile object. Stations went and came
And I grew hungrier still. . . . .
We stopped at Chester. I went softly back,
Hoping against all hope the girl had flown,
And, after long pain and exhaustion's rack,
Love might resume its own.
Alas, no luck. The maiden still was there.
I grasped my courage then in either hand.
My bun, my little bun' I did not care—
Death gnawed beneath my band.
I turned my eyes towards my former place,
Then reeled and turned again; she still sat on,
That haughty charmer with the proud, cold face,
Yes, but my bag was gone!
Nothing betrayed the marble of her cheek;
Only on one red lip—ah, horror dumb–
Stern with the old disdain that left me weak,
Trembled a lonely crumb. Evoe.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AN INsurANCE ACT.
Of course I had always known that
a ſnedical examination was a necessary
| preliminary to insurance, but in my
own case I had expected the thing to
be the merest formality. The doctor,
having seen at a glance what a fine
strong healthy fellow I was, would look
casually at my tongue, apologise for
having doubted it, enquire genially
what my grandfather had died of, and
show me to the door. This idea of
| mine was fostered by the excellent
testimonial which I had written myself
| at the Company's bidding. “Are you
suffering from any constitutional
disease?—No. Have you ever had
gout?—No. Are you deformed?—No.
Are you of strictly sober and temperate
habits?–No,” I mean Yes. My replies
had been a model of what an Assurance
Company expects. Then why the need
of a doctor?
However, they insisted.
The doctor began quietly enough.
He asked, as I had anticipated, after
the health of my relations. I said
that they were very fit, and, not to be
outdone in politeness, expressed the
hope that his people, too, were keep-
ing well in this trying weather. He
wondered if I drank much. I said,
“Oh, well, perhaps I will,” with an
apologetic smile, and looked round for
the sideboard. Unfortunately he did
not pursue the matter. . . .
“And now,” he said, after the
hundredth question, “I should like to
look at your chest.”
I had seen it coming for some time.
In vain I had tried to turn the con-
versation—to lead him back to the
subject of drinks or my relations. It
was no good. He was evidently de-
termined to see my chest. Nothing
could move him from his resolve.
Trembling, I prepared for the en-
counter. What terrible disease was he
going to discover?
He began by tapping me briskly all
over in a series of double-knocks. For
the most part one double-knock at any
point appeared to satisfy him, but
occasionally there would be no answer
and he would knock again. At one
spot he knocked four times before he
could make himself heard.
“This,” I said to myself at the third
knock, “has torn it. I shall be
ploughed,” and I sent an urgent mes-
sage to my chest, “For 'eving's sake
do something, you fool. Can't you
hear the gentleman 2" I suppose that
roused it, for at the next knock he
passed on to an adjacent spot. . . .
“Um,” he said, when he had called
everywhere, “um.”
“I wonder what I’ve done,” I
thought to myself. “I don't believe
he likes my chest.” +
Without a word he got out his
stethoscope and began to listen to me.
As luck would have it he struck some-
thing interesting almost at once, and
for what seemed hours he stood there
listening and listening to it. But it
was boring for me, because I really
had very little to do. I could have
bitten him in the neck with some
ease . . . or I might have licked his
ear. Beyond that, nothing seemed to
offer.
I moistened my lips and spoke.
"Am I dying?” I asked in a broken
WOlce.
“Don’t talk,” he said. “Just breathe
naturally.”
“I am dying,” I thought, “and he
is hiding it from me.” It was a
terrible reflection.
“Um,” he said and moved on.
By-and-by he went and listened
behind my back. It is very bad form
to listen behind a person's back. I did
not tell him so, however. I wanted
him to like me.
“Yes,” he said. “Now cough.”
“I haven't a cough,” I pointed out.
“Make the noise of coughing,” he
said severely.
Extremely nervous, I did my cele-
brated imitation of a man with an
irritating cough.
“H'm h’m h’m h’m l’’
“Yes,” said the doctor. “Go on.”
“He likes it,” I said to myself, “and
he must obviously be an excellent judge.
I shall devote more time to mimicry in
future. H'm h’m h’m ! . . .”
The doctor came round to where I
could see him again.
“Now cough like this,” he said.
“Honk! honk 1"
I gave my celebrated imitation of a
sick rhinoceros gasping out its life.
It went well. I got an encore.
“Um,” he said gravely, “um.” He
put his stethoscope away and looked
earnestly at me.
“Tell me the worst,” I begged.
“I’m not bothering about this stupid
insurance business now. That's off,
of course. But—how long have I?
I must put my affairs in order. Can
you promise me a week?”
He said nothing. He took my
wrists in his hands and pressed them.
It was evident that grief over-mastered
him and that he was taking a silent
farewell of me. I bowed my head.
Then, determined to bear my death-
sentence like a man, I said firmly, “So
be it,” and drew myself away from
him.
However, he wouldn't let me go.
“Come, come,” I said to him, “you
must not give way;” and I made an
effort to release my hand, meaning to
pat him encouragingly on the shoulder.
He resisted. . . .
I realised suddenly that I had mis-
taken his meaning, and that he was
simply feeling my pulses.
“Um,” he said, “um,” and continued
to finger my wrists.
Clenching my teeth, and with the
veins starting out on my forehead, I
worked my pulses as hard as I could.
“Ah," he said, as I finished tying |
my tie; and he got up from the desk
where he had been making notes of |
my disastrous case, and came over to
me. “There is just one thing more.
Sit down.”
I sat down.
“Now cross your knees.”
I crossed my knees.
knee with the side of his hand.
My chest may have disappointed
him . . . He may have disliked my
back . . . Possibly I was a complete
failure with my pulses . . . But I
knew the knee-trick.
This time he should not be dis-
appointed.
I was taking no risks.
before his hand reached my knee, my
foot shot out and took him fairly
under the chin. His face suddenly
disappeared.
“I haven't got that disease,” I said
cheerily. A. A. M.
THE CUCKOO.
THE cuckoo, when the lambkins bleat,
Does nothing else but sing and eat.
The other birds in dale and dell
Sing also-but they work as well.
When daisies star the April sward
His eggs he places out to board,
That when his nursery should be full
He may not be responsible.
When other birds, from rooks to wrens,
Good husbands are and citizens,
The cuckoo's little else beyond
A captivating vagabond.
The other birds who dawn acclaim,
Their songs are sweet but much the
Same ;
The cuckoo has a ruder tone
But absolutely all his own.
Now where's the bard that it would
irk -
To eat his meals and not to work?—
And it's prodigiously worth while
To have an individual style.
So I would be the cuckoo bold
And loaf in meadows white-and-gold,
And make a song unique as his
And shirk responsibilities.

ONCE UPON A TIME.
| THE LATER EDITION.
ONCE upon a time there was a man
who now and then liked a little flutter
on the Turf. Rarely did he win, but he
did not risk much, and he had probably
as much fun for his losses as he would
have obtained in any other way and
not much more expensively. Well,
after a long and dreary winter of
steeplechasing and hurdling, in which
he took very little interest, the flat
season at last opened again and all the
world was full of talk of the Lincoln-
shire Handicap; and “the curtain being
rung up on the Carholme,” and all the
old tropes of sporting journalism were
trotted out; and in common with most of
the male population of the British Isles,
and not a few women, this gambler was
exercised in his mind as to what would
win. There was a very large field–
over twenty horses—to pick from, and
since none of them had done anything
since November, and much may happen
to a horse during the winter, the race
was exceedingly open, nor was the
decision made any easier by the con-
flicting advice of the prophets and the
sons of the prophets, each of whom had
a different fancy. So he made up his
mind to choose for himself, and, after
much searching of heart and the
destruction of many telegraph forms, he
at last despatched to his commission
agent a message desiring him to back
Cuthbert both ways for five pounds,
and having done this he resolutely
forgot all about the race until the boys
began to shout the result in the streets.
Even then he declined to be hurried,
but with a great affectation of apathy he
bought a paper, and when he saw that
his own Cuthbert, child of his pre-
science, was first at 100 to 6 you could
have knocked him down with an osprey,
for this meant over £100 in hand. He
retired to his club and let his mind run
on what he would do with it. There
was a little picture at CHRISTIE's in the
Friday's sale which had much attracted
him—he could now have that; and the
new limited edition of KIPLING; and
an anonymous tenner to one or two
needy friends might be managed; and
the new billiard-cloth could be assured
—all through the gallant efforts of the
brave Cuthbert. He also wrote a few
letters announcing his success, and then
leaving his club very happy in mind, he
was met by another newspaper-boy
bearing a placard which said, “Lincoln
Handicap Sensation,” and, idly buying
this, the man discovered that the brave
Cuthbert had been disqualified and
was now utterly discredited and last
of all, and a miserable impostor named
Berrilldon was first, so that, instead

OFF steep Snaefell the wind comes cool,
But in the sun the stacks are steaming,
And on the lawn a furry pool,
Three lazy dogs that lie a-dreaming;
When suddenly, beside the hedge,
Near the blue iris fast uncrinkling,
A hare steps on the grassy edge,
His brown bright eyes with mischief twinkling.
No pursy meadow-hare is this
To fall a prey to plodding beagles;
He is a mountain hare, I wis,
And trains himself in dodging eagles;
Straight for those dreaming dogs he goes,
And as he lightly vaults them over
Flips with contemptuous pads the nose
Of bold Ben Gunn or Jack or Rover!
Away he pelts straight up the hill
With springing steps that never slacken,
A flash of red along the fell,
A running ripple through the bracken;
Light as a blown leaf on his feet
And swifter than a scudding swallow,
While the three dogs in breathless heat
With one wild howl of “Banzai''' follow.

Panting perspiringly behind
A stout and middle-aged retriever.
O craft that doubles in the gorse,
O speed that skims the open reaches!
What jokes beside the water-course,
What merry japes among the beeches!
The fells with sun and shadow hued,
The larches gay with April bunting,
And both pursuers and pursued
Delirious with the joy of hunting.
But joys are fleeting ! Pussy feels
His friends behind too blown to rally,
And with a pitying kindness wheels
Back to their own, their native valley;
Plumb on their sacred lawn he halts — -
A sight to drive a true dog crazy! |
Tumbles two saucy somersaults
And exit, fresher than a daisy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, March
31.—Looking round more than half-
empty benches at Question-time it
seems impossible that the Session, but
a few weeks old, can hold out to
Whitsuntide. As a rule, whatever may
befall as an average sitting drones along,
there is full attendance at Question-
time. Treasury Bench is thronged by
Ministers eager to give as
little information as possi-
ble in adequate number of
words. LEADER of OPPO-
sITION and his colleagues
are temporarily united in
search for opening to trip
up Government. Through
the Question-hour (which,
by the way, lasts only \
forty-five minutes), no one
knows what may turn up.
Consequently all are in
their places ready to be
interested or amused.
Peculiarity of to-day's
situation is singular absence
on part of Leaders. The
hungry sheep look up and
are not fed. To begin with,
SPEAKER is represented by
Deputy. Two Members on
Front Opposition Bench
represent flower of the ex-
Ministry. The PREMIER, to whom
customary bunch of Questions are ad-
dressed, is out of hearing. CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER is engaged in
apostolic work recorded by St. Paul,
Ephesus being represented by the
Marconi Committee - room upstairs.
The PostMASTER-GENERAL is in the
same arena. Even MASTERMAN, whose
capacity for answering Questions de-
signed with baffling intent is super-
human, extends his week-end.
Hicks-JoyNSoN–or is it JoyNSoN-
Hicks? In the early days of Minis-
terial colleagueship the late MARKis
used to complain that he never knew
whether Old Morality was H. W.
SMITH or W. H. However precedence
runs, the Member for Brentford was
all over the shop. The SPEAKER, who
cannot be accused of niggardliness in
the matter, has drawn the line at six
Questions as a maximum allowance
for a single Member. Hicks-JoyNSoN,
subtlely grouping four under two head-
ings, managed to evade the regulations
and put eight. His activity did little
to relieve depression that settled down
upon House. As one swallow does not
make a summer, so a hyphen linking
two surnames does not involve double
capacity for commanding attention.
Effect of situation upon Mr. GINNELL
comically embarrassing. Appropriated
considerable portion of Question Paper
with a Shorter Catechism of diversified
interest. Had as usual, necessarily in
ignorance of nature of Ministerial reply,
drafted in manuscript sheaf of Supple-
mentary Questions “arising out of that
lºw: These he prefaced by ad-
dressing “Mr. Speaker.” Correcting
himself with grave deliberation he sub-
stituted the formula, “Mr. Deputy-
This, regularly repeated
Speaker.”

through a course of interrogation,
occupied some time. But time is
matter for slaves and, true Britons
slaves.
Business done.—Report Stage of the
Navy Estimates agreed to without
division.
Tuesday.-The measure of success
attendant on eruption of KEBTY-
FLETCHER was not such as to encourage
“Self-confessed vacuity.”
(Mr. DENIsos FABER.)
all, House of Commons never will be
fresh effort in same direction. It cer-
tainly had the charm of the unexpected.
This the third session of the Member
for Altrincham; as far as one re-
members, his maiden speech was made
to-day when he suddenly fell upon
CHANCELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER and
tried to rend him. His acquirements
as a linguist are among the proudest
appanages of the Liverpool provision
market. Since he came to Westminster
he has been silent in five languages.
This afternoon burst forth
in one, and straightway
made a Parliamentary repu-
tation.
Began with inquiry set
forth on paper desiring to
know from the CHANCELLOR
o F THE Exc H E QUER
“whether there are any
emoluments or allowances
attached to his office other
than his salary.”
On face of it question
suggested to penetrating
mind of DENIson FABER
that suspicion of there being
“something behind" which
stirred its self-confessed
vacuity when he came across
the ATToRNEY - GENERAL's
cable message to his brother
in New York, “I hope that
by the time you come back
the Coal Strike may be
finished.” Whether the mind of CHAN-
CELLOR of THE ExchEQUER was dis-
turbed by similar suspicion is not
known. He contented himself with
short rejoinder in the negative.
It was here that KEBTY-FLETCHER,
to the amazement of House, erupted.
Had Vesuvius on a summer evening,
after long period of quiesence, broken
forth in flames and streams of boiling
lava, the immediate neighbourhood
could not have been more astonished.
“Arising out of that reply,” he
said, “is not the right honourable
gentleman's salary sufficient to pre-
vent him wrongfully and improperly
gambling 2 ”
Evidently more to follow, but whether
KEBTY meant to finish the sentence in
German, Latin, or a dialect of the Slav
tongue, no one knows. Loud shout of
“Order | Order! ” boomed from Minis-
terial benches. SPEAKER interposed
with obvious remark that the further
question did not, as alleged, “arise
out” of Minister's reply and was there-
fore not in order. LLoyd GEORGE leapt
to his feet and, regarding his assailant
with flashing eyes, invited him to “come
outside.” Of course didn't put invita-
tion in this precise form. That its
plain meaning.
KEBTY rose respondent to the chal-

lenge. SPEAKER on his feet again
insisting that if Member for Altrincham
had further questions to ask he should
put them on the Paper. Evidently
didn't think a man with such com-
mand of language was to be trusted
to speak on spur of moment. , KEBTY
bobbed up and down like parched pea
in frying-pan. Whenever he rose a
howl of execration came from benches
opposite. “Snob. Snob!” they shouted.
“Cad! Cad!” Whereto well-wishers
on Opposition benches, with fuller
command of syllables, responded,
“Marconi!” “Whitewashing!”
Worse than the uproar was attitude
of the SPEAKER. KEBTY's pale lips
moved as iſ he were translating a select
passage from a foreign classic. That
all right, since not a syllable could be
heard. But whenever, after contact
with the frying-pan, the parched pea

popped up, the SPEAKER was also on
his legs and KERTY dropped down.
Strangers in the Gallery, brought up
to respect what they were taught to
regard as “the first body of gentlemen
in Europe,” looked round uneasily.
Began to think that by some strange
mistake they had strayed into what
ALBERT MARKHAM last week described
as “a pothouse crowd."
SARK, who is reaching the status of one
of the oldest Members and reveres the
memories of forty years of close intimacy,
refrains from habit, sometimes perhaps
obtrusive, of interposing frivolous re-
marks on the episode. Jealous for the
dignity and high traditions of the House
he discerns in it fresh testimony to the
deplorable decadence that has marked
its proceedings during recent months.
Eruption subsided as suddenly as it
had broken forth. Business went on
as if nothing out of the way had
| happened.
Business dome.—Alarums and excur-
sions. Incidentally motion that House
should go into Committee on Civil
Service Estimates agreed to. At end
of eight hours SPEARER left the Chair.
Two minutes later everybody left the
House. Sitting adjourned.
THE VERNAL EQUINOX.
WHEN I have got a song to sing,
No power on earth can stop it;
And this, you must admit, is Spring
When bluebells do (or ought to) ring
And Edwin whispers “Ting-a-ling!”
And Angelina, “Drop it!”
When songsters ought to have their
fling,
And lovers ought to pop it.
For are not questions things to pop
And is a song a thing to stop?
Ten years ago I loved a piece
Whose Christian name was Mary;
She was a stout attorney's niece
And swore our love should never cease;
But oh! when uncles are obese
Then are they most contrairy.
When this one whistled for the p'lice
Myself, becoming wary,
Remarked, upon a second thought,
To cease, perhaps, was what it ought.
| |The constable was big and blue,
His views were most decided. . . .
And, now whenever Spring is due,
I thank my stars, as so would you,
If you had got a star or two
And you had fared as I did.
(One's stars will always see one through
If one will but be guided.)
But what I thank my planets for
Is keeping me a bachelor.
“But what,” you ask, “ of Mary,
pray ?”
Another man bespoke her,
Whom she, upon her wedding day,
Was pledged to honour and obey
And even love him in a way,
Although he was a Broker.
But as for him, I've heard him say
He's half a mind to choke her.
“But what has this,” you ask again,
“To do with Spring?” I will explain.
Though Spring's the time when love
is ripe
And ready for the gleaning,
When Corydon assumes his pipe
And, giving it a thoughtful wipe,
Croons lays of an erotic type
But little inner meaning—
'Tis then that husbands feel the gripe
And misery of cleaning.
A wife, they tell me, is a thing
That one is best without in Spring.

SPRING SPORTS.
[“The customary spring sports are being
largely indulged in.”—The Margate Cor-
respondent of “The Daily Telegraph.”]
WHEN you have regretfully put your
skis back into their box, packed your
skates into a brown-paper parcel once
more, and put the bob-sleigh into cotton-
wool for the summer, you may cheer
up, for there are still the spring sports
at Margate to be done.
Donning your sand-shoes and cala-
bash pipe, you emerge from the board-
ing-house after breakfast, sniffing up
the invigorating east wind as you go,
and proceed to the jetty. Everybody
spends the morning on the jetty.
Some of London's most titled people
are daily to be seen at the slots there.
Men well known in commerce, art, law,
and the services take very seriously
their daily recreation of working the
| automatic machines with which a far-
seeing enterprise has so plentifully
endowed this bracing resort. It is told
of Lord B. (with what amount of truth
we do not know) that in a single
morning he had no fewer than five out
of fourteen pennies returned to him, so
great was his skill.
For the more ambitious sportsman
there is the fishing, which is always to
| be obtained here, whether the water be
rough or smooth. A morning's catch
| may vary from seven ounces to three
and a quarter pounds.
The afternoon is passed by the
| habitués of the place in the healthful
exercise of standing by the flagstaff.
The rules are very simple; the only
condition of the game is that the player
must not hold on to anything or lean
against anything; he may have his
face or his side or his back to the wind,
just as he pleases; all he has to do is
to stand for one minute. The winners
| receive handsome bottles of cough-mix-
|ture, neuralgia cure, and other suitable
gifts.
The evening during the spring sports
season at Margate is spent by visitors
There are
certain police regulations which are
restrictive to some extent; but it is
generally found that after the rigours
of the day in this healthy and ex-
hilarating atmosphere, where, although
the sun may perhaps be shining with
great brilliance, the coldness of the east
wind is in no way mitigated, the pastime
of the Time-table problem is the most
| popular. The successful competitor is
rewarded by catching the quick train
home on the following morning.
More Hunger Strikes.
“The cer tre-half neglected to fecd her
inners."—Hockey Field.
AT THE PLAY.
“The GREAT Adventure.”
ILAM CARVE, the great artist, was a
shy man who shunned society. He
wandered about the Continent, attended
solely by a valet and two moles. The
moles lived just beneath his collar.
One day (as all the world knows now)
the four of them returned suddenly to
England, and at the very moment of
arrival Albert Shawn, the valet, died.
Owing to a misunderstanding the
three survivors were assumed to be
Albert; and in the evening editions the
death of Ilam Carve, England's greatest
artist, was sadly announced. Ilam, too
shy to go through the bother of correct-
ing the mistake, let it be; the valet
was buried in the Abbey; and Ilam and
Ilam Carve (Mr. TIENRY AINLEx). “I am
about to take my tie off. This being England,
the curtain will be lowered for a minute while
I do so."
his two moles started a new existence
as Albert Shawn.
But the three of them were not
alone for long. Soon after his funeral
Ilam married Jamel Cannot, the dearest
little woman, who cared nothing for
art but could manage a house. For
two years they all lived happily to-
gether. Then the secret began to
come out. To prevent a lawsuit over
one of his pictures (recently painted and
apparently, therefore, a forgery) Ilam
was urged to reveal his identity. How
could he establish it to the satisfaction
of a man who knew nothing of art 2
. . . Quite right. The two moles.
Without wishing to make a moun-
tain out of a mole-hill, I could wish that
Mr. BENNETT had managed his final
scene somehow else. He makes very
good fun of the idea of identifying an
artist by his neck rather than by his
work, but this does not excuse him for
falling back on such an artifice. Any-
way, could Cyrus Carve possibly have
recognised or even have remembered
his cousin's moles after twenty-five
years? I have been trying to recall
the exhibits in this line on the necks
of my childhood's friends, and my mind,
I fear, is an entire blank.
However, these are trifles. It is the
characters of Ilam and Janet which
make the play. Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT
owes much to Mr. HENRY AINLEY and
Miss Wish WYNNE. As it happened,
I read the play before I saw it, and it
was amazing to find how real and living
a person Mr. AINLEY could make Ilam ;
wonderful how delightful even the most
ordinary remarks of Janet sounded from
the lips of Miss WYNNE. Which had
the greater triumph I cannot say; they
were both superb. With their help
Mr. BENNETT has given us a very
pleasant entertainment at The Kings-
way Theatre. And there is no reason
why he should not give us many more;
for his dialogue is always pleasant and
easy and his stage-craft amply sufficient
for his needs. But as a satirist he is
rather ingenuous. Indeed at times he
gives one the idea that he has only
just discovered London . . . and finds
it all very strange. M.
THE STRONGER LINKS.
“WE should be near the eighth green
now,” I said, as we panted up the slope.
“There is a guide-post just on the top
of the hill, and -confound it !” The
post had suddenly revealed itself just
on the top of my nose. It was very
dark.
“Never mind your silly nose,” said
Cicely unfeelingly. “How far are we
from the green 2"
“Turn to the right,” I answered.
“A little further . . . further yet . . .

There was a muffled shriek from the
pot-bunker, and I knew that my nose
was avenged.
“Don’t trouble about getting all the
sand out of your mouth,” I advised her.
“Some people eat grit with every meal,
you know. It's considered to be bene-
ficial to the digestion. Have you ever
noticed how a dog . . . Ah, here's the
flag.”
“Get out one of the bottles,” whis-
pered Cicely excitedly.
“Take it,” I said. “I have come
with you in fulfilment of a rash promise,
but I absolutely decline to take any
part in the actual destruction of the
greens. Heaven forbid that I should
ever be guilty of such sacrilege.”
In the darkness I heard the pop of a
cork, followed by a gurgle and the faint
splash of a liquid. Then a glimmer of

Cicely, as we made our way stumblingly

and at the same time putting a check
on the selfish pleasures of men.”
“And women,” I added.

There was a deep sigh as the last
drop clucked out of the last bottle on
to the sixteenth green. Cicely had been
strangely silent for some time.
“After all,” she said discontentedly,
“I don't really know that I'm glad.
Golf is rather a jolly game, isn't it?”
“More than a game,” I suggested.
“An absorbing pursuit.”
“I’ve had some good times on the
links, too,” she said wistfully.
“Do you remember that foursome at
Seamouth, when you had to hole out a
twelve-yard putt for a win, and did it?”
“Don’t,” she pleaded. “Do you
think it does advance the Cause to
destroy golf greens?”
“On the contrary,” I replied, “I’m

convinced that it has precisely the
opposite effect. I regard the proceeding
with utter abhorrence.”
“Then I think you're perfectly horrid
to have let me come,” she burst out.
“Why didn't you stop me?”
“Stop you! I might as well have
tried to stop a runaway motor-'bus.
So these are all the thanks I get for
undertaking all this discomfort and
risk out of mere Quixotic chivalry !”
“I wish we hadn't done it,” she
moaned. “I wish to goodness we
hadn't done it now.”
“That's all right, Cicely,” I said
cheerfully. “I rather expected this.
That's why I emptied out your corrosive
acid before we started, and filled the
bottles with water.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“ALL IN A GARDEN FAIR.”
I KNEw a man, a mild and cheerful soul,
Whose fancy cherished for its earthly goal
A garden of his own. For many a year
His villa with its cat-run in the rear
And one smut-blackened tree were all he had,
But some good neighbour's garden made him glad,
And sun and rain and every plant that grows,
The modest daisy no less than the rose,
Were his close friends; and he would stroll about
Admiring how the things were coming out,
And fruits and flowers and every singing bird
A friendly envy of his neighbour stirred;
And oft he'd quote, meandering round the spot,
“A garden is a lovesome thing, God wot l”
Then came a day when fortune, cruel-kind,
Gave him the very garden to his mind,
Grateful he cried, “Sweet pleasaunce all my own,
No hireling hands shall tend thee, mine alone!”
And casting off his coat, as I've been told,
He sallied forth to tend his precious mould.
The seasons came and went, and, on a day,
It chanced I journeyed down my old friend's way,
And thought to find him, in some happy hour,
A blissful Adam in his Eden bower. -
I called, and from his flower-beds in he came,
But aged he seemed, with bended forfm, and lame,
It would appear he'd lately sprained his back
Lugging some seed-potatoes in a sack.
“Well, and how goes the garden, friend?” I said.
He eyed me with suspicion, shook his head,
And put me off; some blighting chance, 'twould seem,
Had dimmed the lustre of his former dream,
And, as within that earliest home of ours,
A fatal serpent lurked amid the flowers,
He, too, had sighed, with all who goalward strive—
“Better to journey hopeful than to arrive.”
- -
A genial soul of old, on great and small
He used to smile, and found some good in all;
But now what hates fill that once friendly mind
Of slugs and mice, birds, boys, weeds, wet and wind
He dreams of deadliest poison for the rats
And sets wire-nooses for his neighbours' cats;
While that small daisy-friend of days gone by,
She gets the weed-destroyer in her eye.
Once, did a blackbird deign from that sole tree
To flood the backyard with its minstrelsy,
Raptured, with good AQUINAs he would cry,
“Hark, ‘ubi aves, ibi angeli !’”
Now, at the first notes, all his thoughts are set
On cherries plundered 'neath their guardian net;
Or let a bullfinch pipe, and, with a frown,
“My buds!” he cries, and grabs his shot-gun down.
No fat-filled cocoa-nut now tempts the tits,
They, too, nip buds and must be blown to bits.
Once, though the rain were pelting cats and dogs,
Turning that neighbour's flower-beds to bogs,
He d quote (who is it?) with a cheerful voice,
Smiling, “If heaven sends rain, why rain's my choice' "
But let heaven try it now, and hear him shout,
“Confound the wet—washing my seedlings out !”
Once, a sun-worshipper, he'd bask and brown
A month on end; now, let the sun beam down
For one blest week, he scowls and fags about,
Weighed down with watering - pots, and drats the
drought. -
So day by day he casts indignant eyes
Upon each changing aspect of the skies;
And every night before he goes to bed
Bangs the barometer and shakes his head—
A worn disproof, whate'er its inward grace,
That “honest labour wears a lovely face!”
Poor chap! I know now when I look on you
Why “Mary, Mary" so “contrairy” grew :
Still, rain or shine, the primal curse holds out:
Who tills the earth pays the old price, no doubt.
But, ere that ban a kindly soul can sour,
And blight for good your joy in fruit and flower,
And lest the clay you're made of, some ill day,
Hurl down the hoe and curse its fellow clay,
Be wise, good friend, before it grows too late,
And let the jobbing gardener through your gate.
THE THRUSH'S SONG.
DEAR SIR,--I am a naturalist of considerable (local)
repute, and my latest self-appointed task has been the
study of bird-songs, and their translation, as far as possible,
into human language. It may interest you to know that
my researches have enabled me to disprove the popular
fallacy that the Turdus musicus (common song thrush)
warbles his roulades and cadenzas for the allurement and
gratification of his mate. This is not the case, for, far from
being of an amorous nature, the vocal outbursts of our
speckled-breasted songster are nothing more or less than
a caustic criticism on the manners and appearance of his
hated rival on the next tree but one.
In submitting my translation herewith, I beg to mention
that my garden is situated within the ten-mile radius, where
the birds sing with a slightly Cockney accent.
First Thrush.

If any of your readers are inclined to doubt this inter-
pretation, I merely ask them to step into any London park
or garden and test its accuracy for themselves.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Boy Scouts Beyond the Seas (PEARSoN) is the outcome
of Lt.-Gen. Sir RoberT BADEN-Powell’s “recent tour of
inspection among the Boy Scouts, not only in our overseas
dominions, but also in the United States, Japan and China,”
and in several European countries. The book should, I
imagine, appeal urgently to those for whom it has been
written, and, at any rate, I can vouch for the fact that it is
a wondrous mine of information. Do you, for instance,
know what the word “buccaneer” originally meant, and
can you explain why the kea is an extraordinarily
unpleasant bird? Then again I discovered that Sir
RoBERT is “generally up before half-past five,” and this
was also news to me. I think, however, that to tell a
Boy Scout that “a fathom is six feet" is or ought to be—
rather unnecessary. The narrative is interspersed with
little quips—I can hardly call them jokes—which are
apparently intended to help the reader's digestion. That
they did not assist mine is probably just as it should be,
and I am very content to believe that Sir Robert under-
stands to perfection both the matter that Boy Scouts
ought to have and the manner in which they must have it.
I solemnly curse that kindly disposition, innate in all
reviewers, whereby they are prompted to say a good word
for all and sundry and are left with no adequate means of
advertising real achievement when they come across it. I
would at this moment be re-possessed of all the superlatives
I have squandered that I might spend them in the praise
of Mrs. BELLoc LowNDEs’ Studies in Love and in Terror
(METHUEN). That title not only indicates exactly what the
reader may expect to find inside the cover but it is typical
of Mrs. LowNDEs' method of getting to business. When
less gifted authors would have searched high and low for a
captivating phrase, she is content quietly to explain the
position, and this, when you come to think of it, is what
authors as well as titles are for. Mrs. LowNDEs fulfils her
purpose excellently; having read her, you say, not “What
a way she has of expressing things I " but, “What things
she has a way of expressing !” Yet her art, if it is hidden,
is there; for her style, which no one would examine but a
critic, is found upon such examination to be exquisite. Of
five faultless stories, the first, “Price of Admiralty,” is
perhaps the best; the situation of Jacques de Wissant,
Mayor of Falaise, bound by his public duty to pay honour to
the brave dead, who is at that moment first known to him to
be his own wife's lover, is a masterpiece of irony in conception
and exposition. The four which follow lack only the striking
novelty of the first; their circumstances are more familiar,
but otherwise their merit is the same. Indeed and in short,
the stories have been to me, and must be to all who read
them, five very thrilling experiences.
Never having read He Who Passed, I am unable to claim
any share in the pleasant things that its author says of the
critics of this work, in dedicating to them her latest pro-
duction, The Life Mask (HEINEMANN). As I understand,
however, that the one was supposed to be fact, while the

| no power should make me
anticipate the manner' of
other is admittedly fiction, I have no hesitation in calling
the latter the better of the two. Comparisons apart, more-
over, The Life Mask struck me as being a highly remark-
able novel, with a plot both striking and original, and
written in a style quite distinctive and charming. Like
all stories whose theme is “wrop in mystery,” it is
difficult to criticise without revealing the secret and thus
depriving the author of her chief effect. This I will cer-
tainly not do. From the moment of your introduction to
Anita, the girl-widow, living apparently in hiding as the
guest of her devoted old nurse, and haunted by dreams of
| some hideous tragedy that has ruined her life, you naturally
want to know what this was. For Amita, pleasure is
supposed to be over; there is nothing before her but to
| exist unnoticed and, if possible, forgotten.
| thinks otherwise, and takes her charge to Spain, where, in
| an exquisite old garden, the inevitable man appears. He
and Anita are lovers at sight; but there is still the sinister
But old Sarah
and horrible secret as a barrier between them. Perhaps
the secret itself is so obvious that I might have betrayed it
with no great harm to your -
enjoyment. But the final
removal of the barrier—ah !
this. I shall just say that
seldom, if ever, has a tale
given me so genuine a sur-
prise or such an unex-
pectedly creepy sensation.
And of course, looking back,
that explains everything. It
certainly makes a haunting
end to an unusual book.
It is very hard to know
what to make of Henry
Kempton, officer in the
English army, who bounds
as it were from the brain
of Ever.YN BRENTwood and
The Bodley Head. The
son of a plebeian furniture
dealer, he is consumed with
writer, except Mr. W.
Pension Officer. “WELL, MICHAEL, so You 'RE LIVING YET 2 "

YEAR.''
but there is a certain rude force about many of the scenes
that made me not nearly so much distressed by these
deficiencies as I felt that I ought to be.
There are those who object to Mr. PETT RIDGE's humour
on the ground of its unvarying Pett-Ridgidity. They
complain that it tends to become mere stereo. It is true
that it has not a very wide range; but, on the other hand,
it seldom fails to sparkle and be exhilarating; and I for
one have no quarrel with a bottle of champagne because it
resembles other bottles of champagne which may have
come my way. The PETT RIDGE joke is constructed on a
formula easy to understand but hard to imitate. It looks
simpler than it is, Thus, in his latest work, a Super-
intendent, discussing the tracking of certain evil-doers,
says to the bungling station-detective, “Will you keep your
eyes open, Sergeant—,” pauses and adds, “ and look out
for another berth.” That sort of thing seems tolerably
easy, yet the fact remains that Mr. PETT RIDGE is the only
W. JAcoBs, who does it even
— passably well. It is the
humour of unexpectedness,
a polished version of that
which earns the music-hall
cross-talk comedians their
vast salaries. All of which
is leading up to the state-
ment that, if Mr. PETT
RIDGE's other collections of
sketches have pleased you,
you will like Mired Grill
(Hodder AND Stoughton).
You may find one or two
stories in the book hardly
worth reprinting, but the
majority are of a quality
deserving the dignity of
stiff red covers. “The Rest
Cure" is perhaps the best
of the fifteen, with “Loose
Cash" a good second; and,
as for the book as a whole,
I quote Mr. PETT RIDGE's
waiter, “You may not like
an ambition for social pro-
gress not unlike that of GEORGE GIssiNg's tragical figures,
and, on the advice of a duke's daughter whom he hap-
pens to meet at a very mixed garden party, enters the
24th Hussars. In this regiment, which seems to be all
at twenty-sixes and twenty-sevens, he falls under the
influence of Major the Honourable John Carados, a
soldier whose immorality and cynicism are only equalled
by his fearlessness and efficiency. When this gentleman
commits suicide through disappointment in a sordid love
affair, Henry follows the advice of his idol to the extent of
obtaining the W.C. solely in order to advertise himself, but
is too cold-blooded to experience sentimental emotion and
becomes engaged to Lady Violet Ravenscroft without having
a particle of affection for her. The problem before the
writer appears to be to make him sufficiently human to
satisfy the demands of romantic heroism. The difficulty is
solved by the curious expedient of making him suddenly
cast aside his asceticism and betray his troth to his fiancée,
at the beginning of the Boer War, with a Dutch woman who
aims at playing the rôle of Jael and leads Henry and his
regiment into a trap in which most of them are assassinated.
Grievously wounded, he is forgiven by Lady Violet, and the
novel ends happily on this agreeable note. The grammar
of this book is almost as improbable as some of its incidents,
all of it, but what you
don't care for you can easily leave.”

THE WAR. -
THE girl who helped in the opposite flat was talking to
the porter on the ground floor landing:— - - - - - -
“All I can say is, I wish this 'ere war was over and done
for, but I suppose if it wasn't the war it'd be somethin'
else. Father and Uncle Bill do get that 'ot with one
another whenever they meets, I wonder they care to go on
visitin', but father says 'e's got 'is family feelin's and Uncle
Bill says 'e won't never give us up, 'im bein’ mother's only
brother and 'avin' a nice little bit o' property—'ouses, you
know, and that kind o' thing. So there they go quarrellin'
and 'avin' a scrap, and next day or the day arter they're
both as lovin' as a pair o' saints in a winder.
“Last time it was all about LLOYD GEORGE, and the
finished up by father chuckin' a sossidge at Uncle Bill's
face—ah, and not missin' him neither. 'E's a good un to
aim is father, and when it 'it Uncle Bill it went squelch,
and Uncle Bill got more supper than 'e bargin'd for. Well,
they made up that little bit o' business through father
writin' to Uncle Bill and sayin' 'e forgot at the moment
'e'd got a sossidge in 'is 'and, and 'e 'oped it would be took
in the sperit it was offered; and Uncle Bill answered on
a lovely sheet o' paper with 'is monnygram in blue at the
top, a W and a S all mixed up together like, to stand for
William Sampson, and 'e said 'e wasn't one for bad blood
between brothers-in-lor, but 'e was sorry about the waste
of a good sossidge, and this oughter be a lesson to all
of us not to let our angry passions git in the way of our
friendships, and as to the apolligy 'e accepted it and would
come round soon and smoke the pipe o' peace.
“Well, 'e come o' Sunday night just as mother and me
was clearin' up supper, and father says, “Bravo, Bill,' 'e
says, ‘you’re a man o' your word,' and Uncle Bill says that
nobody's ever found Bill Sampson backward in that way.
“I’ve come arter supper,' 'e says with a laugh, “so's not to
git mixed up with the eatables this time,' 'e says. “It might
be a pork-pie next, and that ain't so soft as a Sossidge,’ and
then we all 'ad a good laugh—all except father, and 'e did
'is bist to jine in. Father's a very generous man, but 'e's
proud, and I could see 'e didn't relish Uncle Bill illudin' to
the little contrytemps—that's what Uncle Bill called it in
'is joky way. It's the same as what we call a rough and
tumble. i . . . . . . .
“Father and Uncle Bill lit their pipes and then they got
to work on their talkin'. They started about the war, and
father 'e says, “I don't 'old with this 'ere naval deming-
stration,' 'e says. “I’m for the Montynegroes,' 'e says, “and
I don't see what call we’ve got to put no pressure on 'em.
They're little uns,' 'e says, “but they're plucky, and I can't
abear to see them big bullies set about them. That ain't a
proper use for our Dreadnoughts.' . . . . .
“‘That's all very well,’ says Uncle Bill; ‘but you're
forgittin' the balince o' power.’ - “.
“‘What's that?’ says father. -
“‘It’s this,' says Uncle Bill. “Supposin' you was to go
and grab 'old of a pot o' money that don't belong to you x
“‘’E'd never do that,” says mother. ‘’E ain't one o'
that sort.’ * . . . .
“Ah, but I'm supposin'," says Uncle Bill. “It's only
'ipothical,' 'e says, or some such word as that. “I’m not
really sayin' 'e'd ; for to pinch what don't belong to 'im.'
“And you'd better not, Bill Sampson,’ says father.
“But let's 'ear a bit more about this 'ere balince o' yourn.'
“‘Let's say as I pinched the money,' says Uncle Bill.
‘Well, if we wos both Great Powers and you come along,
you'd 'ave the right to make me give you 'alf on it.'
“‘Is that the lor?’’ says father. . .
“‘That's the concert o' Europe,’ says Uncle Bill.
“Then,’ says father, “I don't want no more o' your
concerts. I’ll 'ave no second.’elpin' o' that dish. I'm a
Montynegro, I am, and I don't care 'oo 'ears me say it.’
“But,’ says Uncle Bill, ‘the Austrians are mobilisin'
their army.' - -
“‘Let 'em mobilise,’ says father. ‘They won't 'urt no-
body but theirselves. They're all talk.’.…
“They're not the only ones,’ says Uncle Bill. “There's
others can do a bit o' talkin' too." -
“‘Meanin' yourself, I suppose,’ says father.
“‘No,' says Uncle Bill, ‘meanin' you.’
“‘Now, look 'ere, Bill Sampson,’ says father, ‘I’ve 'ad
too much o' you and your balinces and your concerts o'
Europe. You're enough to make a monkey cry with your
bullyin' nonsense. If you can't argue no better than that,
go and do it somewhere else.' -
“Uncle Bill give 'im a look, and then 'e put on 'is'at and
went out o' the door; but 'e 'adn't bin gorn more 'n 'alf a
minute before 'e puts 'is 'ead in agin and shouts, ‘Abar

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE REsolute SPIRIT.
ONCE upon a time there was in the
Suffolk village of South Highbolt a
Tudor grange. It was richly timbered,
with vine leaves carved on its barge-
boards, and it had a great hall with
a roof-tree springing from a cross-beam
of massive stoutness, and a very beauti-
ful pilastered gallery, and altogether it
was such a house as, although damp
and insanitary, sends romantic travellers
into ecstasies. But it had come upon
evil days, and having been bought
cheaply by a speculative London
builder had been sold by him at an
enormous profit to an American pluto-
crat, and—a minute plan of all having
been prepared—was now being taken
down with great care, every brick, stone
and beam numbered, to be
re-erected in the American
millionaire's estate on the
banks of the Hudson as a
garden hostel for his guests
and a perpetual reminder of
a country older and more
beautiful than his own.
Now it happened that,
like most Tudor granges,
this one was haunted. Ever
since the year 1592, when
a wealthy heir apparent,
named Geoffrey, had been
poisoned with a dish of toad-
stools by his spendthrift
younger brother, more than
anxious to upset the ex-
asperating financial pro-
visions of primogeniture,
and their sister Alice had 1–
unconsciously partaken of the same
dish, Alice and Geoffrey, as well as
could be managed in their disembodied
state, had devoted themselves to the
old home and the discomfort of its vari-
ous successive inhabitants; and their
dismay was intense on seeing its com-
ponent parts gradually being packed
into a series of trucks, to be drawn to
some distant spot by a traction-engine.
To demolition pure and simple they
were accustomed. Many were the
neighbouring mansions, most of them
also haunted, which they had seen
pulled down, and not a few rebuilt; but
it was a new experience to observe a
house bodily removed they knew not
whither, nor could they discover. In
vain were other ghosts consulted;
none knew, not even the youngest.
The point then was, what was to be
done? for Geoffrey and Alice were
divided in opinion as to their duty, Alice
considering that her first allegiance was
to the structure, and Geoffrey that his
was to the site.
“It is our family home,” said Alice;
“marry we must go with it, no matter
where.”
“Nay, sister,” said Geoffrey, “that
were foolish. We are Suffolk ghosts—
more than Suffolk, South Highbolt
ghosts—and here we ought to stay.
Suppose it is going to London—how
then 2 You are far too simple and
countrified for the great city. The
others will laugh at you.”
“Let them,” said Alice, “I care not.”
“Wait till you hear them,” said
Geoffrey, “all sensitive as you are
Anyway, here I mean to stay.”
“But how foolish l’” said Alice;
“for surely, Geoffrey, you would not
haunt nothing? What use could that
be? How can you make nothing creak 2
or blow out candles when there are
none? or moan along passages that do
not exist? or wring your hands in
Extract from a letter to an editor. “I THANK You For THE
of YoUR columns.”
South Highbolt at casements that are
elsewhere 2''
“True,” replied Geoffrey, “but I can
carry on the mechanism of haunting
just the same. I can gibber where
the old home used to stand, as many
another honest Suffolk ghost, ay, and
Essex and Norfolk ghosts too, I wis,
are doing at this moment. I belong to
the village and shall stay here. I hate
travel. No doubt to create anything
like the sensation to which I have been
accustomed will be difficult, but I can
do my best. Even the poorest efforts,
however, will be better than accom-
panying a traction - engine along a
public road in broad day—verily a de-
grading occupation for the unlaid spirit
of a fair lady.”
“Circumstances alter cases,” Alice
replied. “I conceive my duty to be to
yondcr wood and stone. Nothing shall
shake tºe. Wherever they go, there go
I also.”
“And I too,” said Geoffrey, “am
adamant. South Highbolt is my home
and never will I leave it.”
It therefore happened that when the
time came for the road-train to leave,
every vestige of the house being packed
away, Alice took a tearful farewell of
her brother and crept dismally into the
last truck with a bibulous brakesman,
and either such was her melancholy at
leaving home or such the completeness
of his potations that she caused him
not a single tremor all the way to
Harwich, where a vessel was waiting
to convey the grange to America. It
was when Alice realised this and took
up her abode in the stuffy hold as near
to the roof-tree as she could nestle that
her courage first began to fail, for she
was a bad sailor; but once again duty
triumphed. . . .
It was on the first night on which
the re-erected Tudor grange was opened
as a hostel for the millionaire's guests
– that Alice was placed in the
3 delectable position of realis-
ing that the consciousness
of having been virtuous is
not always the only reward
of a virtuous deed; for she
had hardly waved her arms
more than thrice, or uttered
more than three of those
blood-curdling shrieks
which dated from the mo-
ment when her suspicions
that the fungus that she had
just swallowed so greedily
was not a mushroom but
a toadstool assumed an
air of fact, when Professor
|Uriah K. Bleeter, one of
mosºmºrry" most determined foes
of the American Society of
Psychical Research and all
its works, sprang through his bedroom
window to the ground below, taking
with him the sash and some dozens of
diamond panes.
And now the Tudor grange, even
emptier than it had been for so long in
England (since America is a greater
country), is once more for sale, pre-
ferably to a Suffolk landowner; and the
millionaire who bought it lives entirely
on his yacht.
From a police-court case headed
“Furious Driving ” in The Cromer
Post:—
“Police-constable Woodcock said he saw
defendant drive the horse over three-quarters
of a mile of road in twenty minutes. When
he stopped defendant the horse was trembling.”
A chill, no doubt.
“It is a fact not generally known that
sailors who are off the southern coast of South
America, and are in want of water, make for
the mouth of the Amazon, where they can
procure fresh water 200 miles from the coast.”
Recall News.
It seems a long way to go for a drink.

ORIGINS.
THE Select Committee on Motor
Traffic dangers, whatever the results
of its investigations may be, has at
least made a splendid start. It has
already earned the gratitude of all
antiquarians by the flood of valuable
light which it has thrown on the vexed
question of the origin of the Rule of
the Road. One of the witnesses has
pointed out that the rule came into
being “about the time when men
carried swords, so that they could
seize their weapons with their free
hand and turn round and defend them-
sclves against attacks from behind.”
We may now confidently look to the
Select Committee, in the course of the
sittings that are yet to come, to en-
lighten us upon the origin of other
curious customs—equally closely con-
nected with the dangers of motor traffic
—which have grown up almost im-
perceptibly among us.
Does the custom, for instance, of
walking on the outside of the pave-
ment when in the company of a lady
date—as we have always supposed—
from about the time when ladies took
an interest in shop windows?
Is it true—as we have good reason to
believe—that the custom of shaking
hands when acquaintances meet dates
from about the time when men con-
º
§º
sidered it prudent to keep the other
fellow's right hand out of mischief until
they saw how he was going to take it 2
Are we right in supposing that the
custom of knocking at a door before
entering—obviously an old survival—
dates back to about the time when most
private residences were protected by a
portcullis, on which you had to knock
pretty hard if you wanted to make your
way in 2
These are moot points, some of them
perhaps more moot than others; but
there is no doubt at all in our mind
that the custom of dressing for dinner
dates back to about the time when the
Court of CHARLEs II. encouraged luxury,
and no one dreamt of getting out of bed
before that hour of the day; and it
is interesting to note that the custom of
using umbrellas dates back to about the
time when they were first introduced.
We hope that if witnesses before the
Select Committee have any more solu-|
tions to offer they will at least be free
from ill-natured criticism. It
already been pointed out that the Rule
of the Road on the Continent is the
reverse of what it is in this country;
but that circumstance is due, we under-
stand, not so much to the fact that
swords were never carried in France
or Germany, as to the fact that all
foreigners in the Middle Ages were
notoriously left-handed.

WILLIAM'S SECRET.
[A study in the methods of Mr. WILLIAM
LE QUEUx, whose new book, “Mys-
teries” (WARD, Lock & Co.), leaves
ws cold.]
THE mystery of the astounding events
which startled all Europe a few years
ago has never been elucidated, therefore
now for the first time I will relate the
facts, which will astonish many.
It was a beautiful evening in Sept-
ember, and London was, as is usual at
such times, empty. I had received my
customary invitations from the Nobility
to shoot over their preserves, but I had
decided to remain in the Mecca of all
Englishmen, London, in the hope that
some astounding adventure might hap-
pen to me. Therefore it was that I was
seated alone with my revolver in the
smoking-room of the Devonshire Club
on a beautiful evening in September.
Suddenly the door opened and my
old friend Baron Banana came in. I
had frequently dined with him on his
yacht at Monte Carlo, therefore I knew
him well." -
“Good evening, Caro Barone,” I said
with a gay smile, for he and I had
always been great companions and had
sometimes lent each other money.
“My friend,” he said, putting his
hand on my shoulder and twirling his
moustache despairingly, “I want you
to do something for the Czar of Russia.”
At these words his face went the colour
of ashes.
“What is it 2." I asked hoarsely.
In an instant three low-looking de-
termined men in dark tweed overcoats
burst into the room, each with a loaded
revolver covering us.
“The papers,” muttered the first of
| them thickly, levelling his revolver
unhesitatingly at Baron Banana's neck,
“give me the papers!”
Without a word I handed him The
Times, The Daily Telegraph, The West-
minster Gazette, The Morning Post and
The Daily Chronicle. -
The ruffian, who had a big black
beard and elastic-sided boots, blanched
visibly, and turning again to my friend
Baron Banana angrily pressed his
revolver, which was loaded to the hilt,
against the Baron's elbow.
“Give me the secret papers,” he said
in a hoarse whisper to my friend.
“They were stolen from me yester-
day,” said my friend Baron Banana,
with whom I had often dined on his
yacht at Monte Carlo.
The ruffian went as pale as ashes.
Without a moment's hesitation he dis-
charged his deadly weapon at the
ceiling. Immediately I fainted.
When I recovered consciousness two
years later, I found myself to my
amazement lying in a sumptuously-
furnished cabin. Therefore I went on
deck and found that I was on a mag-
nificent steam-yacht off the coast of
Algeria.
Suddenly the most beautiful girl I
have ever seen appeared on deck and
glided towards me. In less than a
month we were the greatest friends.
“I adore you,” I declared passion-
ately one evening, taking out my
revolver and raising her hand to my
lips. -
“Hush,” she murmured in a hoarse
whisper. -
Two weeks passed, and I was stand-
ing on deck one morning when she
came suddenly towards me, her beauti-
ful face the colour of ashes.
“What is it?” I asked hoarsely.
She handed me a packet of papers.
“Take these,” she said, “and give
them to Popoff, the Chief of the
Police in Warsaw,” mentioning the
name of the most dreaded detective in
Russia, Paul Popoff. “It is a matter
of life and death.”
“Whose 2" I asked anxiously.
“Yours,” replied the beautiful girl,
whose name I found out afterwards was
Maritza. - -
Immediately I swooned.
::: ::: ::: ::: ::
I must have been unconscious for six
months. When I came round I found
myself to my astonishment in the deep-
est dungeon of the dreaded Schüsselburg,
from which no prisoner ever returns
alive. I made up my mind that my
last moment had arrived, and drawing
my revolver decided to sell my life
dearly. -
Suddenly the door of my cell wa
opened, and my old friend Baron Banana,
with whom I used frequently to lunch
on his yacht at Monte Carlo, was kicked
in by one of the guards.
“How are you, my dear old chap 2"
I said, for his face was as pale as ashes.
“The papers?” he said in a hoarse
whisper.
We drew out our revolvers, for we
were resolved to sell our lives dearly, if
the guards interrupted us at this
moment.
“I am Paul Popoff,” my friend Baron
Banana went on, mentioning the name
of the most dreaded detective in Russia.
Immediately I drew out the packet,
which Maritza had given me, from the
lining of my waistcoat.
Without a word the Baron opened
the packet with the greatest eagerness.
Suddenly he gave a cry. The packet
contained, not the letters he had hoped
for, but a deadly bomb
Both our faces went the colour of
ashes.
Then there was a loud explosion—
and I knew no more.
::: : :: :k -:
When I recovered consciousness I
found myself, to my intense surprise,
in the Barnes mortuary. As may be
supposed, I desired to remain in that
place not an instant longer than was
necessary, therefore I escaped by the
window. Having a few shillings still
left in my pocket, I took a taxi to Scot-
land Yard in order to clear up the
mystery of my friend Baron Banana
and the beautiful Maritza, whom I still
loved with all the intensity of my soul.
At Scotland Yard I waited for three
weeks, when suddenly the door opened
and there entered a man whose presence
there rendered me speechless.
It was Paul Popoff, the most dreaded
detective in Russia.
He noted my amazement, and, laugh-
ing as he advanced towards me, ex-
claimed : -
“Now that we meet here, allow me !
to introduce myself under my real
name. I am the German Emperor.”
At these words my face went the
colour of ashes. -
“Then who is Baron Banana?” I
asked in a hoarse whisper.
In an instant he drew his revolver
and handed me a packet of papers.
Immediately I swooned.
::: :: ::: ::: >}:
One word more. Not many weeks
ago, while walking along the Strand, I
noticed a short bearded man coming
out of a Cinema Palace. At the same
moment our eyes met. Instantly his
face went the colour of ashes and he
jumped into a taxi.
It was the Czar of Russia!

DEAREST MILLY,+You will of course
expect me to tell you all about the latest
modes. Well, to begin with, Goose
and Edwin are showing some really
charming Turners for evening wear.
This firm’s “Fighting Téméraire,” in
old gold net over blue chiffon with a
dash of rose, would look exceedingly
well on anyone who was not afraid of a
little colour. There are also some quite
too delicious Whistlers (including an
“Old Battersea Bridge" that would be
the very thing for half-mourning), the
soft shades of which make them
especially suitable to very young
blondes.
I was immensely taken, too, with a
wonderful Napier Hemy, in dark navy
merino, the skirt made billowy, with a
bodice of tulle clouds, which has been
ordered for a smart yachtswoman.
More fragile is a “June in the Austrian
Tyrol" aſternoon confection, of green
and blue velvet, with which is to be
worn a Hobbema “Avenue” hat of
brown straw, trimmed with absolutely
straight uprising plumes, like the trees
in the famous original.
I hear that Messrs. Egalité, of Regent
Street, are making a feature of a special
line in ready-made Leaders; the coat
and skirt of the popular russet and
green being finished off with a dainty
toque in various sunset shades, the
whole giving the effect of masses of
foliage caught by the last rays of
evening.
A propos of this firm, I should tell
you that Mrs. Blank Dash, the wife of
the well-known artist, created quite a
sensation in Bond Street last week by
appearing in the smartest of tailor-
made costumes of hand-painted canvas.
Everyone was admiring the delightful
je-me-sais-quoi blend of colouring; but
only now am I able to publish the fact
that this was really due to the material
employed being the Academy rejecteds
of the lady's husband. Messrs. Egalité
were of course responsible for this
triumph; and I am told further that,
in order to keep abreast of the latest
movement in fashion, they have opened
a branch establishment in the King's
Road, where customers desirous of
obtaining the real Chelsea cachet can
have their own materials made up
within a stone’s-throw of the studios
supplying them.
Next week I must write to you about
the new designs in oil-painted coats for
wct weather. Yours,
Louise.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, April 7.
—For some months a war-cloud has
lain ominously low over the East of
Europe. From its component parts,
rare in complexity, full charged with
electricity, there would follow
on explosion a conflict by the
side of which the wars of the
past century would seem to
be but skirmishes. Avoid-
ance of this appalling cal-
amity is, according to ad-
mission frankly made in tho
Chancelleries of Europe,
largely due to the sagacity
and confidence - inspiring
character of the British For-
eign Minister. Without
putting himself forward with
intent to assume a position
of prominence Sir Edward
GREY's right to presidency,
alike at gatherings of tho
Ambassadors and at con-
ferences of representatives of
the Allies, has been instinct-
ively recognised and geno-
rously acknowledged.
Rising to-day in crowded
House, hushed to state of
anxious expectancy, he made
characteristically frank state-
ment disclosing current situ-
ation. At a moment when,
Turkey beaten to her knees,
peace seemed assured upon
terms fairly distributing the
spoil among the victors, Montenegro
asked for more and defied the Powers
whose carefully worked-out scheme of
settlement reserved Scutari for an auto-
nomous Albania. This attitude was
significantly answered by a naval de-
monstration, in which two British ships
took part, our Admiral finding himself
in command of the International Fleet
cruising off the coast of Montenegro.
The agreement between the Powers
respecting the frontier of Albania was,
Sir Edward GREY said, reached after
long and laborious diplomatic effort.
“Arrival at such agreement was essen-
tial to the peace of Europe, and in my
opinion it was accomplished only just
in time to preserve that peace between
the Great Powers.”
It might be supposed that this state-
ment, solemnly made by a man who
never indulges in gasconade, would
have given pause to the little clique
below Gangway on Ministerial side
Who rather fancy themselves as authori-
ties on foreign affairs, whether affecting
China or Timbuctoo. On the contrary,

their counsel, MASON proposed to move
adjournment. “In view of the enormous
and very delicate interests involved"
PREMIER gravely deprecated discussion
at present moment. In accordance with
high traditions that exclude critical
questions of foreign policy from Party
polemics, LEADER OF OPPosition, amid
cheers from his own side,
heartily agreed. Demand for
leave to move adjournment
nevertheless pressed. Chal-
lenged to show how far it
was supported sixteen Mem-
bers stood up. As forty is the
minimum number necessary
for such enterprise as Mem-
ber for Coventry was bent
upon, application refused.
Business done. — Attempt
of tail of Ministerialists to

with crisis in Eastern Europe
baffled.

CELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER

Tuesday. — Useful object-
lesson presented in connection
with Bill abolishing privilege
of Plural Voting. A measure
of first-class importance, it
might, had it been introduced
in ordinary old-fashioned way,
have occupied whole sitting.
Minister in charge would have been
expected to make prolonged speech.
There would have been equally lengthy
discourse from Front Opposition Bench.
Members above and below Gangway on
both sides would have chipped in, and
so the night would have worn away to
reach the same inevitable conclusion.
|Under Ten Minutes' Rule it was all
over, including division, well within the
half-hour. Ten Minutes' Rule so called
because Standing Order in question
says nothing about ten or other pre-
cise number of minutes. It simply
directs that when a motion to bring in
a Bill be made “the Speaker if he
thinks fit may permit a brief explana-
tory statement from the Member who
moves and a Member who opposes the
motion.” House has agreed that ten
minutes is fairly sufficient time for such
explanation. Hence the nomenclature
of the Rule and the establishment of
general belief that a limit of ten minutes
is definitively ordered,

case is to some extent analogous to the
Ten Minutes' Rule, since he is com-
monly called “Jack” because he was

christened Joseph ALBERT, with his
eye on the clock, compressed admirably
lucid statement within space of ten
minutes. F. F. SMITH, overstepping
the limit by a hundred seconds or so,
was pulled up by murmurs from
punctilious gentry below Gangway op-
posite. -
For practical purposes Ten Minutes'
Rule might with exceedingly few ex-
ceptions be applied to introduction of
allº Bills. Extended debate on First
Reading stage is worse than wasted
time. It is frequently misleading, since
Members are discussing proposals they
have not yet had advantage of con-
sidering i. studying in print their
precise terms. Second Reading stage
presents full opportunity for such de-
bate.
When it comes we shall probably
hear something about F. E. SMITH's
objection to the Bill that “it
loads the dice against the Oppo-
sition as a party.” As SARK
points out, if the imagery be
accepted it follows that through
all these years during which
the principle of Plural Voting
has been operative the dice have
been loaded against Liberal can-
didates at elections.
Business dome.—Bill for Abo-
lition of Plural Voting read a
first time by 303 against 177,
Ministerial majority running up
to 126. -
I'riday.—Questions addressed
to Ministers, more especially
those put by Irish Members,
occasionally throw vivid flash of
light upon social life in remote
country districts. In form of series of
questions addressed to PostMASTER-
GENERAL, SHEEHAN told stirring story
of exploits of auxiliary postman JAMEs
M'SweenEy, of Carriginimma, County
Cork. It reads like a chapter from
LovER's IIandy Andy. According to
SHEEHAN, in addition to common-
place duties pertaining to post office,
Mr. M'SweeNEY takes active part in
public life of Carriginimma. He is
the local parish secretary of a secret
sectarian and political order known as
the Board of Erin, A.O.H.
Whether these letters are initials
familiar to the initiated or merely an
exclamation was not disclosed.
Meetings of this secret society have,
it is asserted, been held in the local
post office, whose affairs are adminis-
tered by Miss M'SweeNEY. Having
a day off | was Sunday, March 23)
this terrible though auxiliary post-
man “organised a political invasion
from Macroom and Ballyvourney upon
the Carriginimma Catholic Church.”
Worse still, he is, it appears,"frequently
guilty of neglect of duty in the delivery
of letters by attending funerals of the
members of his order during official
hours,” a practice which certainly must
involve a measure of inconvenience in
business circles.
The INFANT SAMUET, not easily taken
aback, shielded himself from attack by
reading official vindication of JAMEs
M'SweeNEY's general character. Irish
Members not to be put off by this.
WILLIAM O'BRIEN, with his instinctive
dislike of secret societies (such as the
Land League, for example), thundered

As though my ribs were roughly

Long time I pondered o'er the thing,
For, truth to tell, it made me qualmy.
Could it, I wondered, be the Spring?
Was I in love or going balmy?

In heart and head, until, despairing,
I cast one look towards my feet—

THE MOTOR-BUS HANDRCAP.
IT was a Saturday afternoon and
Bill and I were in sore need of amuse-
ment. Hyde Park oratory we had
found overrated. Our respective clubs
had seemed to consist of nothing but
silent bald heads. So at Hyde Park
Corner we parted, and I, in accordance
with our pre-arranged scheme, stepped
on to a bus going along Piccadilly to
Liverpool Street. It was not long
before I made the acquaintance of the
conductor, at that time a man of honest
appearance and no doubt unblemished
character.
“Conductor,” I said, “I have a friend
and his name is Bill.”
The conductor, though by now he
may be silent and reserved, as is the
way with those who have regrettable
pasts, was at the moment inclined to all
the outspoken candour of sweet
innocence. He told me that he
had many friends and that most
of them would answer to the
name of Bill.
“But this Bill,” said I, “is
relevant.” (The man's jovial
expression sobered down a little.
I think he misunderstood me to
mean that Bill was a parson.)
“He is at this moment being
carried as fast as bus can carry
him up Park Lane. Arrived at
the Marble Arch, he will travel
viá Oxford Street to Liverpool
Street. Arrived there, he will
return with all speed, but vid
Piccadilly, to Hyde Park Corner.
I, on the other hand, am
scheduled to return to that im-
portant spot vić Oxford Street and
Park Lane. In other words, it is a
circular route and we are travelling it
in opposite directions. For private
reasons, including a liquidated sum of
money, it is urgent that I should be
back at Hyde Park Corner first.”
Leaning over the side, he shouted
a few cryptic words to the man at the
wheel. Clearly these two had the
racing instinct and a pride in their
bus. Ncc, as my old friend VIRGIL
used to say, mora. -

The Strand is slow-going on a
Saturday afternoon, but I had cvery
hope that we should make up time

I loathe two people so much and on so
short an acquaintance as I did the two
British matrons who stood in the
middle of Fleet Street and barred our
progress with waving umbrellas. It
was possible but, we decided, imprudent
to pass through them, so we delayed
our rush and they delayed it more.

on board, they sat just in front of me,
less by design than by reason of the
suddenness of our start, and their sub-
sequent conversation, which I could
not help hearing, made me sweat with
dismay. It disclosed an awful state
of affairs. So I hastened down-stairs
to interview the conductor before he
should interview them.
“My friend,” I whispered to him,
“this bus is going to Piccadilly.”
He demurred.

I was back at the starting and
winning post, Hyde Park Corner, just
in time to see Bill emerge from a
taxi-cab. - - -
“I attribute my downfall,” said he,
on being confronted, “to two old
women.”
I asked for particulars.
scriptions seemed familiar.
“When I got on to my return bus
at Liverpool Street,” he continued,
“and saw the old things sitting on top,
I should have known that they put no
value on their own time and would not
hesitate to waste mine. But it was
such a nice-looking bus and the genial
conductor wore such an unscrupulous
look.”
I asked for further particulars, and
this time the descriptions left no room
for doubt. -
“At Piccadilly, after two previous
attempts, in which they changed their
minds when they had stopped the bus,
they got off.”
“As they of all people were entitled
Their de-
| to do,” I murmured.
“But not where everybody else gets
off. No, they must have a stop to
themselves. Worse, they must keep
us all waiting while they had a long,
long chat with the conductor.”
“Perhaps,” I suggested, “they had
cause to remonstrate with him 7”
“Not they. For when, being able
to tolerate the delay no longer, I left
the bus, they were thanking him in the
most emphatic and profuse terms for
their pleasant ride. Indeed,” he added,
as he handed over the amount of our'
bet, “the last I saw of them they were
tipping the fellow.”
I pocketed the wager. “In my
opinion,” said I, “it has been from
first to last a most disreputable affair,
from which no one, save the ladies,
emerges without shame.
Bill's only regret, on being en-
lightened, was the thought that, if he
had not been detected over the taxi-
cab scandal, he would probably have
confessed voluntarily.
“The annual match between the Oxford
and Cambridge teams last week at Hoylake
resulted in a tee.”—Dublin Evening News.

NEIGHBOURS.
IT is not, generally speaking, amus-
ing—even for a musical critic—to be
in bed for a week in a Swiss hotel in
winter. Yet I was well entertained
by my friendly intercourse with Mr.
Arthur W. Brooks, next door. IIis
portmanteau was sent to my room by
mistake on the evening of my arrival.
That is how I discovered his name,
but I never wittingly beheld his
features. Still our rooms were only
separated by a locked door, and I came
to know a good deal about Arthur W.
Brooks. - - - -
His principal characteristics appear
to be a catholic taste in music and an
inveterate habit of whistling while he
is dressing for dinner. That is how
we got on terms almost of intimacy
with one another. It was on the
Tuesday evening that I first became
aware of a beautiful rendering of
ChopIN’s “Funeral March " creeping
solemnly through the key-hole. This
was followed, after a suitable interval,
by a brief and brilliant selection from
Carmen. I felt that applause in any
form would be out of place, and yet I
wished to show my appreciation in the
most delicate manner possible. I am
no mean whistler myself. I have even,
in my day, whistled to my own accom-
paniment at a Band of Hope concert.
So I replied tentatively, unobtrusively,
with the opening bars of the “Frei-
schutz Overture.” I had not advanced
very far when the gong sounded and
he went down. I thought he might
have waited. On the Wednesday I
began to keep a record in the form of a
diary, which follows:—
Wednesday might.—Brooks came up
early, having, perhaps, got wet through
tobogganing. We plunged at once into
BEETHoveN's Symphonies. He gave
a really fine synopsis of the principal
themes of the “Eroica.” I replied with
the slow movement of the Fourth. I
thought I should have him there, as it
is not so generally known, but to my
extreme pleasure he went on to the
Scherzo with the utmost promptitude.
We then took the “C Minor,” dividing
the movements between us, Brooks
being a little shaky on the last. The
gong found us on the point of attacking
the “Pastoral.” -
Thursday night.—More BEEThoven.
Brooks is quite sound on BEETHovEN,
though I did not at all care for his
reading of the slow movement of the
Seventh Symphony. It was abomin-
ably dragged. I must try to put him
right about that. -
Friday evening.—I have been won-
dering all day as to what is his attitude
on STRAUss, and as soon as he appeared
I opened upon him with a selection
from the duet from “Elektra.” (Pretty
difficult, of course, but I had been prac-
tising.) I do not think he recognised
it at first. The silence seemed a little
strained. But as I worked up to my
climax he began very suddenly to knock
things about all over the room. There
was such a row of rattling crockery
and the violent splashing of water that
at last I found it impossible to proceed.
An awkward pause followed, when he
had managed to silence me. I thought
I would try him once more. . But
before the end of the second bar I
heard the door bang and steps in the
passage. I hope I have not offended
him. I must keep off STRAUss.
Saturday.—Brooks was quite him-
self again to-day. He actually opened
in the morning, as he was dressing,
with a most spirited rendering of one of
SCHUMANN’s “Novelettes.” Afterwards
we dipped into TschAIKowski, BERLIoz
and MAcDowelI. In the evening we had
a delightful session devoted exclusively
to motives from “Parsifal " and the
“Ring.” I perceive he is a Bayreuther.
Sunday.—A very awkward thing has
happened, resulting almost in a breach
between us. I find to my horror that
Brooks is an admirer of MENDELssoHN.
It has been a great shock to me. He
began without any warning on the first
movement of the “Italian Symphony.”
I nearly leapt out of bed. I coughed,
I rocked to and fro, at last I hammered
on the door. But the persecution went
on. In every moment of silence he
began again. He tried the “Songs
Without Words,” and I had to smash
the wash-basin before breakfast brought
me relief. The trouble about Brooks is
that he can't take a hint.
Monday. — Brooks is evidently
ashamed of himself. He has returned
to BEETHoveN, as being quite uncon-
troversial ground, and we had a long
wrangle over that slow movement.
I fear I failed to convince him. He
always listened patiently when I gave
him the proper tempo, but as soon as
I stopped to take breath he replied by
repeating the passage at his own pace.
I cannot but regret that we should
have parted thus at variance.
Tuesday.—I suppose he went with
the early train before I was up.
Anyhow, after having been out of my
room in the afternoon I began this
evening quite hopefully with a BRAHMS
Sonata. I waited long for a reply, and
then suddenly there fell upon my out-
raged ears a raucous strain which I
believe to be a popular song of the day,
entitled, “We All Go the Same Way
Home.” I cannot stay on with Brooks's
successor. I wonder if the doctor
would let me travel to-morrow 2
Should these words ever meet the
eye of Brooks, I should like him to
know that I am quite prepared to
waive our differences on STRAUss and
MENDELsson N, but he is wrong about
the slow movement of the Seventh.
He ought to admit that.

THE HOLE STORY.
“SYLVIA,” I called, “do you know
the story of the two holes in the
ground 2" Of course, it is a very old
story, but Sylvia is a new audience.
“No. Do tell me, please.”
“Well, well.”
Sylvia climbed up on my knee and
settled down comfortably. “Now you
can tell it me,” she said.
“But I've told it. It's, Well, well.
Two holes in the ground.” -
“Yes 2 "
“You know what a well is, Sylvia?
It's a hole.”
“I had a weeny wony hole in my
sock yesterday.”
“Yes, but this is a hole in the ground,
just about big enough to put a pail in.
And there's water at the bottom, and
when you put the pail down it. comes
up full of water. You know. Like
Jack and Jill. That's a well.”
“Yes. And you're going to tell me
a story about it?”
“It's about two holes in the ground,
and the story is, Well, well. You see,
a well is a hole in the ground, and
Well, well is two holes in the ground.
It's a sort of joke.”
“Yes,” said Sylvia.
“Now you tell it to me.”
“Tell you a story?”
“Yes, tell me a story about two
holes in the ground.”
“I don't think I know one.”
And there I had to leave it.
A day or two later I heard her
talking to her brother.
“Do you know the story about the
two holes in the gwound?”
“ No.”

MUSICAL NOTES.
THE interest excited by the appear-
ance of the “Red Caruso" at the
Alhambra has naturally stimulated the
competitive instinct, and it is pleasant
to think that lovers of coloratura will
be gratified during the coming season
by a number of interesting débuts. In
fact, as Sir HENRY Wood wittily re-
marked the other day, the new fashion
threatens to put an entirely different
complexion on the musical situation.
The proprietors of the Bolosseum
have been so fortunate as to engage
the famous Albanian singer, Ilka
Sandansky, who is perhaps best known
under the engaging sobriquet of the
“Pink Patti,” Mlle. Sandansky being
an Albino as well as an Albanian, and,
what is more, the only Albino who is
also famous as a singer. Her peculiar
physique confers peculiar advantages
on her, as she recently admitted in an
interview with a representative of Le
Ménestrel. “No one knows my age,
and no one ever will. I looked exactly
Native. “THAT I 'AVE, PLENTY or UN."
Native. “THEY BE MAINLY THURE YET.”
and I shall look no older if I live to be
ninety.” Mlle. Sandansky's voice is a
rich soprano of a peculiarly glutinous
timbre, recalling the delicious Carlsbad
plums of thirty years ago; and she is
equally good in the rôles of Rosina and
Juliet. The great ambition of her life
is to play Brünnhilde at Bayreuth, but
unfortunately Madame WAGNER has a
strong prejudice against Albinos.
Miss Topsy Umslopogaas, the re-
nowned Nubian contralto, is known
throughout Central Africa as the
“Black Butt,” although in stature she
falls short by several inches of the
famous English singer. Her voice
is a sumptuous and sonorous organ
of encyclopaedic volume and velvety
quality, and her recitals at Addis-Abeba.
were always attended by the Emperor
MENELIK until his health failed. The
announcement that she has been en-
gaged to appear at Covent Garden in
the part of Amneris arouses the most
lively anticipations, and Sir H. RIDER
HAGGARD has taken a box for her début.
Miss Umslopogaas, we may add, has
a charming literary gift and has written
a delightful autobiographical poem
which begins:–
“They call me the Black Butt,
I play on the sackbut,
The cymbals, the harp and the drum.”
During his recent tour in New
Guinea Mr. Bamberger captured several
pygmies and brought one back with
him to London. The diminutive savage
has developed an extraordinary talent
for the piano and will shortly make his
appearance at the AEolian Hall under
the nom de guerre of the “Pocket
Paderewski.” The P.P. is of a beautiful
bronze tint with a magnificent head of
hair. We understand that M.Sc.BIABINE,
the redoubtable Russian composer, has
written a wonderful fantasia for the
new performer, which he has entitled
“Fantasia Fuzziwuzzia, or Lc dernier
Scri.” Additional interest is lent to
the event by the fact that Sir Pompey
Boldero, Mr. Bamberger's father-in-law,
has kindly consented to turn over the
pages for his son-in-law's gifted pupil.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PONSONBY.
OTHER people walk out of the palatial
tube exit at Holland Park with an easy
carriage and a fear-nobody air. But
with me it is different. I glance fur-
tively to left and right, pull my hat
down over my eyes, and slink hurriedly
into the street like a man who is wanted
by Scotland Yard. This is not because
I have committed any crime, but
because two or three hundred yards
away from the station lives Ponsonby.
I hate, I fear Ponsonby.
When I went to dine with him a few
weeks ago, I had not seen him since we
were at school together; but even in
those days the madness was growing
up within him, so that I anticipated
the worst. I remembered that he used
to collect photographs of engines. I did
not suspect, however, how far things
had gone with him subsequently.
He came out into the hall to meet
me, and almost before I could take off
my overcoat, “ Hullo ' " he said, “how
did you get here 2"
It was necessary to be calm.
“Ponsonby,” I replied, “we were
boys together. Is it not wonderful to
reflect that even now, as we speak,
the map of Europe, which in child-
hood's days we used to trace illegally
by holding it up to the same window-
pane, is undergoing alteration. Servia,
I remember well, a delicate mauve.
And Bulgaria, Bulgaria 7 m
“Did you come by Tube?” said
Ponsonby, interrupting me rather
rudely.
“My wife,” I said loftily, “happened
to be using the aeroplane this evening.
She is attending a Women's Suffrage
meeting.”
“The Tube | " shrieked Ponsonby
madly, “the Tube | Just fancy, he
came by Tube! Come and look here.”
He pulled me roughly into his study,
and, oblivious of the fact that the soup
was already growing tepid on the
dining-room table, hunted out a Brad-
shaw, an A. B. C., and a chart of the
Underground Railways of London. It
looked like a vertical section of the
human body. In a heated oration
lasting some twenty minutes, he proved
to me conclusively that the cheapest
and quickest way to get to his house
from Hampstead Heath (that is the
mountain fastness where I reside) was
to take the North London Railway to
a little village in the provinces called
Willesden Junction, and change there
for Uxbridge Road.
I said “Yes,” meekly, and we had a
pleasant little dinner together, during
which the conversation turned, so far
as I remember, on a recent alteration
in the time-table of the South-Eastern
and Chatham Line between Gravesend
and Victoria. After dinner we discussed
the improved Saturday service to
Ponder's End, and in a rather lyrical
flight Ponsonby sketched the possibility
at no very distant date of the con-
struction of a new bay at Waterloo.
(If it ever happens, Ponsonby will be
the first, I feel sure, who ever bursts
into that silent bay.) -
When I got up at last to go, “Wait
a minute,” he said, “I’m coming with
you; I've got a letter to post.”
“Can't I do it for you?” I said
hopefully. But Ponsonby was obdurate.
He took me firmly by the shoulder and
marched me, shrinking and reluctant,
to Uxbridge Road Station. I went in.
I walked to the booking-office. I felt
like a French aristocrat in the time of
the Terror. The little hutch was my
guillotine. Then a light dawned.
“Can you change half-a-sovereign 2."
I said to the clerk, and looked round
swiftly over my shoulder. Ponsonby
was gone.
I gathered up my silver, turned up
the collar of my overcoat, and made
a bold, successful sprint for Holland
Park. -
The fact is, I like the Tube. It is
warm, for one thing, and there are
little notices and arrows stuck up
everywhere, so that a cow could hardl
go wrong. I like the liſt. I like the
comfortable feeling of my warm familiar
strap. I like the smell. I like the
motion. I like looking at the people's
spats. But now, whenever I go to
Holland Park (and unfortunately, as it
happens, I have to go there pretty
often), I feel like a suspected criminal.
I have a dreadful feeling that Ponsonby
may be º near, spying
upon me. Uxbridge Road hangs round
my neck like an albatross.
And yet, after all, why shouldn't I
use the Tube if I want to ? England is
a free country. And it is not as if Pon-
sonby had shares in the North London
Railway. No. It is just Bradshaw
mania. And of all forms of lunacy
Bradshaw mania is the worst. For one
thing, there is no telling when it may
become dangerous. I rather suspect
Ponsonby of having a ticket-punch
concealed about his person, and it is
principally to warn the public that I
have written this truthful narrative.
If any reader of it should chance to fall
into conversation with a stranger, a
dark sinister man with a wild gleam in
his eye, who suggests that the proper
way to get from Putney to the Bank is
to get on to the Lancashire and York-
shire viſi Sheffield, and change at
Blisworth Junction for Hartlepool and
the Severn Tunnel, let him have a care.
For that will be Ponsonby.

IT is told of the painter DAVINCI,
Being once unemployed for a span,
At the menace of poverty's pinch he
Sought work at the Court of Milan.
Having shown himself willing and able
To perform on the curious lyre,
He presented the Duke with a table
Of the talents he proffered for hire.
“I can raze you a fortress,” it ran on,
“Quellcastles, drain ditches and moats,
Make shapely and competent cannon,
Build aqueducts, bridges and boats;
In peace I can mould for your courts a
Few models in marble or clay
And paint the illustrious SFORzA
With anyone living to-day."
LEONARDO is dead, they asseverate,
He has left no successor behind,
For the days of the specialist never rate
At its value the versatile mind.

She shall dwell on DE QUINCY's Con- |

And no class-room shall boast of a

When her classical pupils rehearse
Their prose, which is modelled on
CICERo,
And their more than HoRATIAN verse.
She shall lead them to love CIMABue,
To distinguish with scholarship ripe
'Twixt the texture of CLAUSEN and

And the values of Collier and CUYP.
Nay, all Blyth shall reflect her ability
As its brushes acquire by her aid
South Kensington's pretty facility
Or the terrible strength of the Slade.
Yes, her duties are diverse, and this 'll
Suggest to each candidate why
They should read LEONARDo's epistle
Before they sit down to apply;
For his style is itself a credential,
Though truly he has not a tithe
Of the qualifications essential
To the Senior Mistress of Blyth.

THE RECENT RESTAURANT STRIKES MAY BE THE MEANS OF INDUCING SEVERAL MID-WICTORIAN waiteRS TO EMERGE FROM THEIR
retire MENT.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. Edwin PUGH's Punch and Judy (CHAPMAN AND HALL)
is capital fun, and I have enjoyed reading it very much.
But I did not think I was going to. At first, plunged into
that grim and moving episode of Punch's attempted murder
of the Coss baby for its own good, I could only believe that
I had got (if you will forgive me) into the wrong PUGH.
But it was all right really. After that untoward beginning
the author's buoyant optimism asserted itself triumphantly,
and the characters were the same brave and humorous
Londoners whom the author has so long taught us to expect
from him. Even the unwanted baby died naturally, and
enabled its father to get drunk on the insurance money.
He, I may say, is one of the characters that do not appear,
but are only spoken of. Those whom you meet personally
are, with very few exceptions, sufficiently amiable. Punch
himself, the Soho gutter-snipe, with his pale face and
the big nose that earned him his name, is jolly enough
to be worthy of it. His match-making, on the simple
Shakspearean formula of false-report, is pure joy. All the
action of the tale takes place in Soho; and those who know
Mr. PUGH's art will not need to be told how well he has
caught the lively spirit of the place, the clatter and scent of
the little restaurants, the interminable traffic of the narrow
streets, the polyglot babel of the inhabitants. If I have a
word of complaint, it is that the story produces, perhaps
unavoidably, an effect of episodes rather than a concerted
whole; episodes humorous or tragic, the anarchists, the
affair of the pistol and the Prime Minister, and others—all
excellently well told, but a trifle detached. For this reason,
the species of general rally, in which all the characters
come on in the last chapter, and say their little tags pre-
paratory to living happily ever after, struck me as artificial.
But who cares? The interest and jollity of the book are
what matter, and they are genuine enough.
The Determined Twins (HUTCHINson) are simply Mr.
JEPsoN doing on paper what he would love to do, but
daren't, in his own person on the heights of Notting
Hill. Lady Noggs in her day pulled chairs from beneath
elderly gentlemen, made apple-pies in the beds of unsuitable
suitors, led trembling Prime Ministers into the nastiest of
quagmires; so now do Violet and Hyacinth Dangerfield.
“I've called myself Lady Noggs long enough,” says Mr.
JEPson; “I am now in that capacity upon the boards of a
London theatre; watch me therefore as the Determined
Twins.” Watching him, then, I am bound to confess that
his antics have not quite the freshness of humour that once
was theirs. My sympathy is, in spite of myself, on the side
of Captain Baster whose brushes were in his bed and whose
body was in the mud. Had Lady Noggs invented the Cat's
Home and trailed a piece of cloth with valerian upon it all
about the country roads, then I am sure that it would have
amused me; but now I cannot resist the feeling that the
Dangerfields have been forestalled, or perhaps, more
accurately, that I have seen Mr. JEPsoN laughing at his
Cat's Home already somewhere else. Then the incident of
the German princess and her rescue by the twins needs a

delicacy of touch that is exactly Mr. KENNETH GRAHAME's
but is not at all Mr. JEPSON's. Whilst Mr. JEPSON is amused
by the snoring of stout ladies and the apoplexities of stout
gentlemen the pathos of the little princess slips timidly
away. In short, although I must confess that The Deter-
mined Twins have, on occasion, made me laugh, they have
not made me laugh very often—and on their next appear-
ance I do not think that I shall laugh at all.
The author of The Surgeon's Log, writing of what he
knows in The Night-Nurse (CHAPMAN AND HALL) of the
routine, the excursions and alarms, the heroisms and the
littlenesses of hospital service, has made an exceptionally
interesting story. It is true that he provides no sufficient
reason for the estrangement of Dermot Fitzgerald, senior
house surgeon, and Nora Townsend, nurse; but in this
fashion of artificially corrugating the courses of true love
our author is following quite a number of more experienced
must be confessed that his hand is heavy indeed. “The
distinguished surgeon left for the Irish metropolis” is his
too typical phrase for sending a specialist to Dublin.
You
will have difficulty in believing that this and similar
pedantries are by the writer of the wholly delightful chapter
in which the customers of Mary Hannagher meet in her
little shop for the settlement of a betrothal.
I am a stern, rough, rugged man, and I can bear most
of the minor ills of life without wincing; but there is one
thing that cuts me to the quick, and that is a split infinitive.
Miss UNA SILBERRAD, on the other hand, appears to love
these mangled horrors. Keren of Lowbole (CoNSTABLE), her
latest book, is congested with the severed bodies of what
might have been lively young infinitives full of health and
vigour. Sir James Belton, for instance, puts his pleasure
first “and all else so far after as to seldom have strength
left to attend to it,” while Betsy Shipp actually “wiped her
eyes to so soon lose the second daughter... Yet none of
craftsmen. One has, I suppose, to accept this kind of
thing under protest as a F- - -
part of the game; but
nothing could well be
better than the way he
manages to convey the
hospital atmosphere, the
splendid efficiency and
precision of the work,
the queer undercurrents
of impulse and emotion
controlled by quasi-mon-
astic discipline, or some-
times not controlled, with
results that make the
warp and woof of his
narrative. The hero's
hospital is in Dublin
City, and he also takes a
spell of fever duty in a
tiny country town. The
author, whom one as-
sumes to be an Irishman, - == ---,

these militant outrages
on the plate-glass win-
dows of English grammar
bole for me. It is a
leisurely book, which
depends for its interest
less on its story than on
its atmosphere and its
subsidiary characters.
Indeed, I would far rather
attempt a précis of a
musical comedy than try
to set down in a few
words the actual plot of
Keren's adventures. She
wanders through the
pages, an attractive

canny eyes and a curious
intimacy with the wild
things of the forest,

casualness of his countrymen. It is the work of a man
who can see the depths and significance of the simple life
around him and can write a love story with imagination
and without too cloying a sentimentality.
The house of METHUEN would seem to be establishing a
corner in Irish fiction. The latest example is Unconventional
Molly, by Joseph ADAMs, which the publishers are good
enough to tell me on the wrapper is a romance “where love
and jealousy, tragedy and comedy are brought into play.”
This is such a friendly lead that I am deeply sorry to be
unable to follow it; but the fact remains that I myself
found the story part of the book more than a little dull.
The young hero, who rents a West of Ireland shoot, cap-
tivates the peasants, falls in love with the daughter of a
neighbouring squireen, and finally reveals himself as the
missing heir to the local landowner, is never more than a
lay figure in the foreground of Mr. Joseph ADAMs' sketches
of Irish scenery. Let it be said at once, however, that
these are excellent. And there are some genre studies of
peasant life, fairs and evictions, legends and merry-makings,
that could hardly be bettered. It is only where the author
seems to have considered himself under the irksome necessity
of producing romance that his spirit failed him ; and here it
sometimes by Tobiah, a
Dissenter. ... Somewhere towards the end you will find the
Last Will which restored Zacchary to the fortune of which
his wicked step-mother had deprived him; and all through
the book you will chuckle, as I did, over the excellent humour
of Tobiah. Add to these things that sympathetic knowledge
of human nature which marks all Miss SILBERRAD's work,
and you have an extremely readable historical novel.
Dirers Colours (CHAPMAN AND HALL)—a collection of
short stories and poems by MAUD G. MEUGENs—is based on
the idea that life is a colour-scheme blended of many tones,
but that each separate incident and abstraction has a colour
of its own. Thus, according to Miss MEUGENs, grey stands
for tears and renunciation, rose colour for happiness, yellow
for fame, crimson for hate, and green for repose and healing.
Personally, I think much nonsense is talked by people who
say, for instance, that Wednesday is brown and the number
eight pink, and so on. But, except that I had not previously
thought of dead white as properly suggestive of cruelty, I
find that my ideas of the meanings of colours agree very
closely with those of Miss MEUGENs. And I like her stories.
For all of them, especially those labelled white, yellow, and
rose, are imagined with charm and told with much delicacy
and literary feeling. - .

[APRIL 23, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GETTING MARRIED.
I.—THE DAY.
PROBABLY you thought that getting
married was quite a simple business.
So did I. We were both wrong; it is
the very dickens. Of course I am not
going to draw back now. As I keep
telling Celia, her Ronald is a man of
powerful fibre, and when he says he
will do a thing he does it—eventually.
She shall have her wedding all right;
I have sworn it. But I do wish that
there weren't so many things to be
arranged first.
The fact that we had to fix a day
was broken to me one afternoon when
Celia was showing me to some relatives
of hers in the Addison Road. I got
entangled with an elderly cousin on the
hearthrug; and though I know nothing
about motor-bicycles I talked about
them for several hours under the im-
pression that they were his subject.
It turned out afterwards that he was
equally ignorant of them, but thought
they were mine. Perhaps we shall get
on better at a second meeting. How-
ever, just when we were both thoroughly
sick of each other, Celia broke off her
gay chat with an aunt to say to me—
“By the way, Ronald, we did settle
on the eleventh, didn't we ?”
I looked at her blankly, my mind
naturally full of motor-bicycles.
“The wedding,” smiled Celia.
“Right-o,” I said with enthusiasm.
I was glad to be assured that I should
not go on talking about motor-bicycles
for ever, and that on the eleventh,
anyhow, there would be a short inter-
ruption for the ceremony. Feeling
almost friendly to the cousin, I plunged
into his favourite subject again. .
On the way home Celia returned to
the matter.
“Or you would rather it was the
twelfth 2 ” she asked.
“I’ve never heard a word about this
before,” I said. “It all comes as a
surprise to me.”
“Why, I'm always asking you.”
“Well, it's very forward of you, and
I don't know what young people are
coming to nowadays. Celia, what's
the good of my talking to your cousin
for three hours about motor-bicycling?
Surely one can get married just as well
without that 2 ”
“One can't get married without
settling the day,” said Celia, coming
cleverly back to the point.
Well, I suppose one can't. But
somehow I had expected to be spared
all this bother. I think my idea was
that Celia would say to me suddenly
one evening, “By the way, Ronald,
don't forget we're being married to-
morrow,” and I should have said
“Where?” And on being told the
time and place I should have turned
up pretty punctually; and after my
best man had told me where to stand,
and the clergyman had told me what
to say, and my solicitor had told me
where to sign my name, we should
have driven from the church a happy
married couple . . . and in the carriage
Celia would have told me where we
were spending the honeymoon.
However it was not to be so.
“All right, the eleventh,” I said.
“Any particular month 2"
“No,” smiled Celia, “just any month.
Or, if you like, every month.”
“The eleventh of June,” I surmised.
“It is probably the one day in the year
on which my Uncle Thomas cannot
come. But no matter. The eleventh
let it be.” .
“Then that's settled. And at St.
Miriam's 2"
For some reason Celia has set her
heart on St. Miriam's. Personally I
have no feeling about it. St. Andrew's-
by-the-Wardrobe or St. Bartholomew's-
Without would suit me equally well.
“All right,” I said, “St. Miriam's.”
There, you might suppose, the matter
would have ended; but no.
“Then will you see about it to-
morrow?" said Celia persuasively.
I was appalled at the idea.
“Surely,” I said, “this is for you,
or your father, or—or somebody to
arrange.” - . -
“Of course it's for the bridegroom,”
protested Celia.
“In theory, perhaps.
not the bridegroom personally. His
best man . . . or his solicitor . . . or
. . . I mean, you 're not suggesting
that I myself— Oh, well, if you
insist. Still, I must say I don't see
what's the good of having a best man
and a solicitor if Oh, all right,
Celia, I'll go to-morrow.”
So I went. For half - an - hour I
padded round St. Miriam's nervously,
and then summoning up all my courage,
I knocked my pipe out and entered.
“I want,” I said jauntily to a sexton
or a sacristan or something, “I want
—er—a wedding.” And I added, “For
two.”
He didn't seem as nervous as I was.
He enquired quite calmly when I
wanted it.
“The eleventh of June,” I said. “It’s
probably the one day in the year on
which my Uncle Thomas—— How-
ever, that wouldn't interest you. The
point is that it's the eleventh.”
The clerk consulted his wedding-
book. Then he made the surprising
announcement that the only day he
could offer me in June was the seven-
teenth. I was amazed.
But anyhow
“I am a very old customer,” I said
reproachfully. “I mean, I have often
been to your church in my time.
Surely x - -
“We’ve weddings fixed on all the
other days.” . . . .
“Yes, yes, but you could persuade
somebody to change his day, couldn't
you? Or if he is very much set on
being married on the eleventh you
might recommend some other church
to him. I daresay you know of some
good ones. You see, Celia—my—that
is, we're particularly keen, for some
reason, on St. Miriam’s.” .
The clerk didn't appreciate my sug-
gestion. He insisted that the seven-
teenth was the only day.
“Then will you have the seven-
teenth 2" he asked.
“My dear fellow, I can't possibly
say off-hand,” I protested. “I am not
alone in this. I have a friend with me.
I will go back and tell her what you
say. She may decide to withdraw her
offer altogether.”
I went back and told Celia.
“Bother,” she said. “What shall
We do 2 ” - - *
“There are other churches. There's
your own, for example.”
“Yes, but you know I don't like
that.
on the seventeenth 2 ”
“I don't know at all. ... It seems an
excellent day; it lets in my Uncle |
Thomas. Of course it may exclude
my Uncle William, but one can't have
everything.”
“Then Will you go and fix it for the
seventeenth to-morrow 2 ”
“Can't I send my solicitor this
time?” I asked. “Of course, if you
particularly want me to go myself, I
will.
living at St. Miriam's nowadays.”
And even that wasn't the end of the
business. For, just as I was leaving
her, Celia broke it to me that St.
Miriam's was neither in her parish nor
in mine, and that, in order to qualify
as a bridegroom, I should have to hire
a room somewhere near.
“But I am very comfortable where
I am,” I assured her.
“You needn't live there, Ronald.
You only want to leave a hat there,
you know.”
“Oh, very well,” I sighed.
She came to the hall with me; and,
having said good-bye to her, I repeated
my lesson.
“The seventeenth, fix it up to-
morrow, take a room near St. Miriam's,
and leave a hat there. Good-bye.”
“Good-bye. . . . And oh, Ronald !”
She looked at me critically as I stood
in the doorway. “You might leave
that one,” she said. A. A. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHECKMATING TIME.
[Lately observed in the course of a time-
honoured manoeuvre conducted by the black
rooks.]
Philip and Rachel—I put the gentle-
man's name first because they are rooks,
and that, I take it, is the convention in
bird society—are setting up house
together. When I say “setting up
house” I mean it literally; but per-
haps I should say that they are re-
storing an old historical residence which
they have got cheap. Obviously there
is nothing suburban about Philip and
Rachel. Their idea is a good old
English rookery of the best period,
with a few select neighbours within
a talking radius of a mile or so and an
eligible view of me in the (human)
house opposite.
I think I understand Philip's motives
in the matter of matrimony. He's had
a pretty thin time of it during the
winter, getting rotten grub and all
the rest of it; so at last he sat out
with Rachel in a quiet furrow—they'd
met at several ploughed fields during
January and done all the new hops to-
gether—fetched her a Neapolitan worm
and then pulled himself together like
a rook and put it to her. After that,
of course, he had a certain amount of
business at the Gray's Inn Rookery
(which he said was jolly well named),
and when that was done he and Rachel
were free to go house-hunting.
Not least pleasant among the many
amenities of rook life is the wedding-
present convention. Ah, my friends,
what a lesson do they teach us humans!
Let us try to read it. But must I
repeat all the old commonplaces about
the duplication of wedding-presents?
(No, I'm afraid I mustn't.) Suffice it
to say that, supposing Susan and I are
going to be married, the Charleses of
this world send me a dozen bread-
knives, and the Thomases of this world
a dozen chestnut-toasters, bought off-
hand and perfunctorily; and mean-
while I am left to cope unaided and
without sympathy with the builders
and carpenters who have sworn to
make a new thing of the old manor-
house I have acquired, wondering if
I can possibly go to the expense of
another cartload of bricks to build that
game larder against the south façade
which Susan has set her heart on.
How different it would be if Charles
drove up in his motor, the tonneau
bursting with bricks, and cried cheerily,
“Here, my dear old pal, is your game
larder Give me a trowel and I’ll soon
show you!” And if Thomas arrived in
his brougham, hugging a load of mortar,
and with a pile of slates on the opposite
seat 1 Could I but see them, keen as
mustard, top-hats laid aside, wrestling
with the bathroom pipes and only
pausing to wring me by the hand and
say, “I’m a confirmed bachelor myself,
but my heart goes out to you in your
new life. Anything I can do—any-
thing !” Wedding-presents of bricks
and mortar and enthusiastic assistance
'Tis a duplication devoutly to be wished.
Such is the lesson of the rooks.
Philip's and Rachel's friends all turn up
with the same sort of present and the
same enthusiasm in the work of restora-
tion, and Philip and Rachel are pleased
with every fresh bit of stick they receive.
“Hurray !” says Phil—I can see him
at it now—“here's old Percy with
another bit. Who'd ha’ thought it?
Percy, you're a sportsman | We were
just wanting some more straw. It'll
come in handy for the dining-room
chimney.”
Then he sits on an adjacent bough
and says, “Shove it in, dear old chap!
Put it where you like.”
That seems to be Philip's general
idea—to sit alongside of Rachel and
talk brightly to his friends and relations
while they do all the work.
“That's a jolly bit of old oak,” he
says to Cousin Amy, a sentimental old.
maid who does nothing but bustle
backwards and forwards with contri-
butions. “Where did you pick that
up 2 x - -
Cousin Amy blushes (a rook's blush
is a sort of purply-blue affair). “I’ve
had it put by for a long time,” she
confesses. “I always thought it might
come in for you and dear Rachel.”
“That's a good'un " cries Philip.
“I’ve only known her a couple o'
months. Haw-haw-haw l’’ And he
simply shrieks with laughter.
Then Rupert comes staggering up
with a young scaffolding-pole, and
everyone stops work to cheer him. He
drops it several times; but what does
that matter to a willing young chap like
Rupert 2 Down he goes in a series of
vol-planes, and never rests till he's got
it safely to its destination. (I think I
see Charles, when his bread-knife gets
lost in the post, moving heaven and
earth to recover it, or buying me
another His way would rather be to
pretend that something he'd never sent
had got lost, and to slang me for not
acknowledging it.)
“Now then,” says Rupert, “where
shall I ram it in 2 ”
“I think the basement wants
strengthening a bit,” says Philip,
putting his head on one side and
considering.
“Or, how about the drawing-room
floor 2 ” chips in Rachel. “A few extra
joists wouldn't do it any harm.”
They talk it over among themselves,
and then Rupert jabs it in, nearly
spitting old Uncle Benjamin, who is
already nursing his gout in the best
bedroom.
Uncle Benjamin—a distinguished
old soldier who has been in many of
the wars—swears freely. . . .
And so it goes on. The service of
Hymen is not, as with us, a sort of
ghoul's carnival, but a social function
in the best sense, a national sport
indulged in by all the nice people.
How else should Rupert, that young
exquisite, toil about all day with
assorted timber, which, he explains,
was chucked at him for an old

that fine old patron of the turf, keep

the noble Gothic foundations added to
and at last o'ertopped by the stately
pile. -

The other night I made sure the
house-warming was taking place. As I
lay sleepless I heard the full tide of
hospitality surging from the lately
completed house of Philip and Rachel.
Many a rousing chorus was borne to
me on the strong night wind, and now
Cousin Amy would hold the field as she
quavered out “The Stately Homes of
|England" in her old-world voice, and
now Percy would give his fine rendering
of “Cras amet qui nunquam amavit.”
As it happens, I was wrong. The
next morning there were the Gothic
foundations in their original propor-
tions. The rest of the stately pile had
been scattered to (and by) the four
winds. Were they, then, sounds of
lamentation which I had heard? Not
a bit of it ! It was the rook version of
“Are we down-hearted ?” As I looked
out of my window, there were Philip
and Rachel still together on the bough,
once more instructing the indefatigable
Percy and Rupert and Cousin Amy and
all the rest of 'em. Even old Uncle
Benjamin had already re-established
his armchair in the basement.
“Shove it in, dear old chap!” said
Philip, as Rupert came staggering up
with a young scaffolding-pole. . . .
“But not quite so much jerry-building
this time,” I think he added.

PIFFLE ABOUT PENMEN.
Mr. Horace Mewlett is about to
publish a volume of verse to which
he has give the alluring title of Lyra
Felina. As he remarks in his Fore-
word, “Hitherto no attempt has been
made to express the true inwardness of
those poignant ululations—those cris
de coeur which are amongst the most
thrilling of the voices of the night in a
great city.” He adds that he hopes no
one will ask him whether these poems
are vitiated by the pathetic fallacy, but
that if they do he has no intention of
answering them. The book is dedi-
cated to the Marquis of Carabas, and
will be shortly issued through the firm
of Catter and Wall.
You may, if you like new poetry,
remember a volume which appeared a
few years ago, entitled “Falsetto
Flutings.” It was written by Mr.
Jasper Didham, a quite young man,
and combined ingenuous candour with
a remarkable mastery of technique.
Since then Mr. Didham has married a
poetess, and a joint volume from their
pens is now promised by Messrs.
Tootill, under the attractive title of
“Didhams.”
Miss Dorothy Scoop's many friends
assembled last Saturday afternoon to
do her honour at a stand-up tea at the
Diana Club. The occasion for the
festivity was her forthcoming marriage
which will remove her from London to
Alaska, where her husband runs a seal-
farm. Miss Scoop hopes to turn the
local colour to profitable advantage
in her next novel, the title of which
is provisionally fixed as “An Arctic
Mermaid.”
It is curious that no history of Bootle
and Chowbent has everyet been written.
The omission is now to be remedied by
a volume from the pen of the Lancashire
archaeologist, Mr. Enoch Earwaker,
who has compiled a stirring chronicle
of the historic happenings which have
lent lustre to these euphoniously named
towns. The book will be published by
the Dinwiddies.
Dr. Salubry, the great eupeptic ex-
pert, has just completed a study of “The

“Jack and Jill” series of cheap mono-
graphs. It describes the origin and

ONCE UPON A TIME.
- | THE WATCH.
ONCE upon a time there was a man
who in a moment of foolishness gave
ninety and odd pounds for a watch.
It was a musical watch, and small
children's faces lit up when they heard
it; but none the less after two years
he came to the conclusion that money
would be more useful. So he put it in
its beautiful velvet and leather case and
took it back to the shop and asked the
stately gentleman behind the counter
to buy it. But the stately gentleman
said that he never did anything like
that, but would exchange jewellery for
it. And then the man took it to a
dealer whose one avowed desire was
the purchase of old watches, and this
dealer disregarded the musical part of
it altogether, as well as the detail that
it kept time, and offered merely the
price of the gold. And then the man
took it to various other dealers, and the
highest offer that was made to him
was less than a third of the original
price, and in disgust he thrust the
thing back into his overcoat pocket,
and hated all men, and realised to the
full once more (as every decent fellow
must, now and then) what a gulf is
fixed between buying and selling, buyers
and sellers. And that being the day
of the Boat Race it followed that in
Leicester Square his pocket was picked
and the watch disappeared. And when
by chance he discovered his loss his
face brightened, and he began to take
a kindlier view of life, and “So that 's
settled,” he said.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Monday, April 14–
Les beaua, esprits serencontrent. Noble
Lords meeting to-day concerned them-
selves with Ancient Monuments. Bill
introduced by BEAUCHAMP. Whereupon,
there being no other
business on hand, the
House, consisting of
half-a-dozen peers,
forthwith adjourned.
“Hardly worth while
putting on wig and
gown and fetching out
Purse-bearer from the
domestic circle,” said
LoRD CHANCELLOR.
“Sometimes get a little

believe of work. Oh,

that man of war,
SANDys, brings in his
Conscription Bill, sets
his squadron in the field,
and straightway sounds
strategic retreat.”
Renewed talk about
little affair that, since
Session opened, has
spread vague feeling of
perturbation. Coming
back to their duties Peers find them-
selves, by thoughtful attention of Board
of Works, provided with adressing-room.
Accommodation primitive since days of
Magna Charta. KING JoHN's barons
riding down to Westminster used,
according to contemporary record, to
stack their armour and lances in Palace
Yard, the police on duty undertaking
to keep an eye on them. Suddenly,
sharp on passage of Parliament Act, in
near anticipation of introduction of
so-called Reform Bill designed to
complete work of disintegration, the
House of Commons, egged on by the
Government, voted a sum of £195 for
a dressing-room.
“There's more in this than meets
the eye,” said NEwTo.N, his mobile
countenance sicklied o'er with the pale
cast of apprehension. “Something
about it akin to the tactics of the
farmer who, at approach of Christmas,
delights unwary flocks of geese and
turkeys by unwontedly generous feed-
ing. They may call it a dressing-room.
It really is what HALSBURY would call
“a sort of 'Preamble to a Bill depriving

school I was taught in a foreign
language to distrust the Greeks when
they brought gifts. I do so now.”

Bill, Government accepted an amend-
ment moved by Cousin Hugh. BAN-
BURY, resenting action that would have
effect of easing progress of the measure,
suggested that Cousin Hugh was
“acting in collusion with the Govern-
ment.” --- . . . . . .
No such paradoxical accusation has
been made since on a day in the last cen-
tury NEwdEGATE, stung by WHALLEY's
insinuation that he, pillar of pure
Protestantism, was in secret league
with the Pope of RomE, retorted by
declaration of belief that WHALLEy,
an equally energetic champion of the
true faith, was a Jesuit in disguise.
It stung Cousin HUGH to the quick.
Lost not a moment in repudiating the
charge. Explained that, so far from
having been led astray by the blandish-
ments of the Government, he was the
seducer, not they. --The intervention of
the Parliamentary King's Proctor was
accordingly made upon total miscon-
ception of the facts.
Encouraged by toleration from the
Chair in matter of disorderly language,
Cousin HUGH tried another flight.
| “The Member for the City of
London,” he said, “is a hypocrite in
this matter, for no one is more prone
to compact with the Government
than is he. The difference
| between us is that he prac-
tises his vices in secret behind
the SPEAKER's Chair, whereas
I declare the truth openly
across the floor of the
House.” - -
BAN BURY, not easily
abashed, had no retort ready.
Several Members made note
of the fact that it is within
the rules of order not only
for one Member to describe
another as a Parliamentary
King's Proctor, but he may,
unrebuked, fling at him the
taunt of being a hypocrite.

OUR FESTAL ANNIVERSARIES.
[By one who is not very good at them.]
“To-MoRRow,” I said, “is April 23rd
—Primrose Day.”
“So it is,” exclaimed Cicely. “How
nice l’”
“I scarcely like to confess it,” I
added hesitatingly, “but to tell the
honest truth, Cicely, I don't really
know the origin of Primrose Day. Of
course I'm aware it's some kind of
national festival, but precisely what, I
can't say.”
“No more can I,” admitted Cicely, to
my relief. “That is to say, I'm not at
all sure, but I think it's connected in
some way with Lord RoseBERY and
the Derby.”
“For my part,” said I more confi-
dently, “I fancy it is associated with
ST. GEORGE, the Patron Saint of Eng-
land. When you come to think of it
the rose is the emblem of ST. GEORGE.
Primrose, of course, comes from a
Latin root—the word, I mean, not the
flower. Prim should properly be Prime,
signifying First. And here, I venture
to think, we have support for my
theory. Years ago it would have been
difficult, if not impossible, to produce
real roses in England much before
April 23rd, and thus the
prim or first rose would
naturally be adopted as the
symbol of -"
“Let's ask somebody,”
interrupted Cicely.
“Right-o!” said I.
“Do you happen to know,
Bllen,” I enquired of the
Cook, “why April 23rd is
called Primrose Day ?”
“I don't for certain, Sir,”
she replied, “but I have heard
it's something to do with
SHAKSPEARE.” -
“There may be something
in this,” I remarked to Cicely.
“SHAKSPEARE, you remem-
ber, wrote those beautiful
lines:
Primroses,
That come before the swallow
dares . . .”
“Daffodils!
cried Cicely.
“Alice would know, I expect,” added
Cook, “because she's a member of the
Primrose League.”
“Of course 1" cried Cicely. “What
duffers! We might have guessed it was
connected with the Primrose League.”
“I understand, Alice,” I said, when
we had found her, “that you are a
member of the Primrose League. That
being so, you can probably tell us why
April 23rd is called Primrose Day?"
Daffodils!”

HOW TO CELEBRATE
ST. GEORGE'S DAY.
(Which, Mr. Punch begs to inform his
millions of English readers, falls on
April 23rd.)
A Royal Commission shall be ap-
pointed to decide, once for all, who the
Saint really was. Only pure-blooded
Englishmen and genuine Cappadocians
to constitute its membership.
The preponderating Celtic element
in the Cabinet shall retire at their own
expense to their respective and original
sheilings and fastnesses for the day,
and give England a rest. The CHAN-
CELLOR OF THE ExchEQUER, however,
in consideration of his surname and
comparatively straitened means, shall be
allowed an excursion ticket to Criccieth.
In view of the fact that, according to
the latest returns available, all but 921
out of the 12,862 men who recruited
for the Navy in 1911 were born in
England, journalists shall be permitted,
just for once, to speak of the English
Navy, without calling down upon their
heads a sheaf of excited protests from
correspondents beyond the Border.
The wearing of a miniature rose in
the button-hole, at any rate in the
early morning and twilight hours of
St. George's Day, by those who can
muster up sufficient courage and
patriotism, shall not be construed as an
affront to the cosmopolitan inhabitants
of London and West Ham.
The police-court test, pro hac vice,
for those ardent spirits who may be
suspected of over-festive loyalty to
their patron saint, shall be the recital
of the well-known formula modified,
namely, “English Constitution.”

“WELL,” said Francesca, “here we are at last.”
“I cannot deny it,” I said. “It is dreadfully true.”
“Do you want to deny it?” she said.
“Yes, Francesca, I do. My whole soul yearns to deny
it; but in face of what has happened even my soul cannot
manage it.” * * * .*.*
“And yet,” she said, “your soul is a very fiery particle,
too fiery, I should have thought, to be snuffed out by a
mere railway journey to the sea-side.”
“Francesca,” I said, “much is permitted to you, but I
cannot allow you to refer to that railway journey again.”
“Pooh,” she said, “what was the matter with it 2."
“How many times,” I said, “did we have to collect and
count the children? How many miles did we have to walk
along platforms in order to find seats in compartments that
were already crammed 2 Why were those two respectable
old gentlemen so angry when Frederick trod on all their
toes? Why did I have sandwiches and sherry for luncheon 2
It is a disagreeable and an unusual variety of luncheon.
Why am I still covered with crumbs 2 Why did we leave

“And why,” she said, “have I married a sphinx? If
you have any more riddles in your mind now 's the time to
get rid of the lot.” - -
“Is this,” I said, “your courtesy 2"
“No, it's my common sense.”
“Ha, ha!” I said, laughing bitterly. :
“And,” she continued, “you'll just have to make the
best of it. Besides I may as well tell you at once that you
will have to sleep in the little room that looks out on the
back. We cannot arrange it in any other way.”
“I knew it,” I said. “It has been so whenever we have
all gone to the seaside together. ... I have always been
squeezed into the little room that looks out on the back.
All lodgings at every seaside are alike in this: the father of
the family is compelled to look out on the back while his
wife and children gaze upon the sea.”
“I can put Frederick in with you if you feel lonely,” she
said.
“No,” I said, “I think I will do without Frederick. IIe
is capable of waking at six A.M.”
“He always does,” she said.
“And he would expect me to tell him a story. I can do
much, but I cannot tell a story to a child at six A.M.”
“It would be good for you to try just once,” she said.
“I think not,” I said. “And, besides, it wouldn't be a
satisfactory story. Frederick wouldn't like it. He is getting
| very particular about his stories. He told me to-day he
| was tired of wishing-caps.”
“You might make it a magic ring by way of a change.”
“We exhausted all the possibilities of a magic ring long
ago,” I said. “And dragons and fairy queens are also
taboo. No, on mature consideration I will deny myself
the pleasure of having Frederick in my room. I will leave
him to you.”
“That,” she said, “is like your generous nature. I accept
your gift.” -
“And you must promise,” I said, “not to throw Frederick
| in my teeth afterwards. You take him with your eyes
He is a free gift, and you must not look him in the

- “I will take Frederick off your hands,” she said, “and

“But tell me,” I said, “where are the children 2"
“They are upstairs,” she said, “unpacking. Do you not

“Are they unpacking my things?" I said.
“They probably are,” she said. “I promised them that
as a treat.”
“You promised them that l” I exclaimed. “But this is
madness. How can three girl-children and a boy unpack

thing else. My socks will go astray. Francesca, you do

“Oh,” she said impatiently, “what does it matter at the
seaside? Listen,” she continued, as a burst of merriment
was waſted to us from upstairs; “they are playing with
your big bath-sponge. Would you be so heartless as to
interfere with their innocent pleasure?”
“They will get wet through,” I said.
“Everybody gets wet through at the seaside.”

“ Winkles will have to be taken out on the wettest days.
Dogs must be exercised even when children stay at home;
and you,” she said, “are the one to do it.”

NATURE KNOWLEDGE.
THE teacher was serious-minded and
very conscientious. The lesson was
“The Frog”—the protoplasmal begin-
nings of froggie being exhibited within
a glass jarful of water, which stood
upon a table before the class. The
room was stuffy and the class in a
state of passive resistance to learning—
all except Tommy Bangs, aged seven.
Tommy, who up to now had never
learned anything if he could possibly
help it, sat staring at the glass jar
with all his soul in his eyes. Teacher
looked at him attentively. Was this
a case of the stupid scholar at last

concentrate upon Thomas.
“You see this mass of gelatinous
substance full of little black dots 2'"
“Yes, ma'am.”
“These black dots are eggs.”
Thomas looked incredulous.
“Now, what are they, Thomas?”
“Eggs,” replied Thomas, obedient
though unbelieving.
“Correct. Well, in process of time
these eggs are—now what do you think
happens to these eggs in process of
time 2"
Uneasy silence on the part of
Thomas.
“Come,” said Teacher. “They are—”
“Boiled,” with sudden inspiration.
“No, no,” said Teacher hastily;
“they are hatched.”
“Hatched,” murmured
apologetically.
“Yes, and out come some queer-
looking creatures with big heads and
flat tails. They are called tadpoles.
Now"—very impressively—“the tad-
pole grows, little legs begin to show,
gradually the tail vanishes, and what
do you think at last comes out of the
water?”
“A—a duck.” Thomas was evidently
unable to get away from the poultry
farm.
“Oh no, Thomas. I will tell you.
A frog. Now, isn't that wonderful ?”
Subdued expressions of astonishment
from the class and a deep sigh from
Thomas, looking as if he could ask for
more information if he dared. Teacher
turned to him kindly.
“You are interested, Thomas 2."
“Yes, ma'am.”
“That's right. I shall cultivate
your taste for nature knowledge. Is
there anything else you would like me
to tell you?”
Thomas
“Yes, please, ma'am.”
“Then just ask,” said Teacher, much
gratified. “Don’t be afraid. What do

AT THE PLAY.
MR. FoEBEs-RoBERTson's FAREWELL
SEASON.
IT is established that JULIUS CAESAR,
besides being a bit of a soldier, wrote
elementary Latin prose for the use of
preparatory schools. But neither of
these accomplishments could ever make
him an adequate mouthpiece, on the
stage, for the philosophy of Mr.
BERNARD SHAw; and the author of
Caesar and Cleopatra, with his notorious
flair for the right medium, recognised
the Triumvir's limitations. Later, on
looking through his original version, he
seems to have felt that this defect in
his protagonist was a source of weak-
ness in the play; that, though Brittanus
threw off a certain amount of easy
satire on the future inhabitants of the
barbarous island that he came from,
there was not enough of SHAw in it.
So he has introduced a prologue (pur-
porting to be the utterance of the god
Ra) which is a sort of sketchy upper-
fifth-form lesson on the history of the
period, punctuated with ridicule of the
Philistines on the other side of the
footlights. Only gods and school-
masters can do these things, knowing
full well that the rules won't let you
answer them back.
It is the old posture. Mr. SHAw still
stands on his head as depicted by Mr.
MAx BEERBoHM on revisiting the haunts
of his early manhood. For the rest, the
play remains an audacious medley of
mock-historical comedy, farce, panto-
mime and melodrama. There is the old
lighthearted disregard of facts—as in
Caesar's paternal and ascetic attitude
to the girl Cleopatra ; there is the old
blend of laughter and blood—as in the
horror, which is not tragedy, of
Flatateeta's death, when, after
affording an interminable lot of
fun to the author (if not to us)
in the matter of her name, she
has her throat slit before Caesar
has got the hang of it. All the
same the playkeeps thefreshness
of its frivolous improbability,
though I doubt if anybody but
Mr. Forbes-Robertson—and
he only on a farewell course—
could have filled Drury Lane
for so slight a spectacle.
Though he made no attempt
to disguise his sad lack of bald-
ness (non Caesaris illa casaries)
he somehow always looked the
part. His vein is, of course, a
high seriousness, but he brought
a very light touch to the treat-
ment of Caesar's mood of holiday
excursion. Miss G E R TRU DE
ELLIoTT was best in the earlier F
scared little flapper; when the savage
in her came out, Miss ELLIOTT had no
more use for her unstaled girlishness.
Of the minor characters, Mr. IAN
RoBERTson was pleasantly solemn in
the part of Brittanus; Mr. Cookson
gave a note of distinction to the royal
tutor, Theodotus; Mr. Scott-GATTY

was a brave and buoyant Apollodorus;
and Mr. LACY as the ranker Rufio was
at least robust. I should have liked
a lot more of little Ptolemy, though
I missed Master Tonge in that de-
lightful prompted speech of the boy-
king. Over the others, as over the
scenery, I draw a veil of genial reticence.

or drunk, seeing or blind, in love or in
despair, he was equally persuasive. Of
course, his chances were a little too
easy. Drunkenness is always popular
on the English stage, and blindness
never misses its appeal. -
It was curious how, in the super-
fluous prologue where Dick has his
preliminary spell of blindness, the band-
age on his eyes and the covering on
his crown seemed to make Mr. FóRBEs-
RoBERTson's golden voice unrecog-
nisable. It seems as if the magic of
his tones is dependent upon an exposure
of the top half of his head.
The tragic ending of Mr. KIPLING's
original version has been modified. It
is no longer The Light that Failed, it
is The Darkness that Succeeded, or
rather it would have been if Maisie's
love for him had come about through
Dick's loss of sight. But apparently
her change of heart occurs before she
learns of his tragedy; and we are led
vaguely to suspect that she was pro-
posing in any case to fall back upon
love as a solace for her art that had
failed. Whatever her motive, poor Dick
was happily too blind to see through it.
Miss GERTRUDE ELLIOTT made the
best of the rather unsympathetic part
of Maisie. But the strongest support
came from Mr. AUBREY SMITH as
Torpenhow. His solid presence, as
always, was a steady source of confi-
dence. Miss OLIVE RICHARDson as
Bessie was sufficiently vicious; the
trouble was to discover the charm in
her that attracted Torpenhow. Miss
ADELINE BourNE did more than justice
to her anonymous description as The
Red-haired Girl. The vermilion of her
wig would have abashed a flamingo.
Mr. Scott-GATTY as Cassavetti once
more shone among an indifferent
lot of supernumeraries, of whom
the stodgy and sonorous Mr.
PERCY RhodEs (Nilghai) was
perhaps the least excusable.
I understand that Signor
PUCCINI came all the way from
Pisa to see Mr. For BEs-RoberT-
son in this play, the actor's
engagements making it im-
possible for him to study the
musician's convenience and
appear in Tuscany. If the
composer of La Fanciulla del
West shared the feelings of the
popular element in Mr. Forbes-
IłoBERTson's audience he was
well rewarded for his exertions.
Dare we hope that in The Light
that Failed he will find the
stuff for an opera (IRiccardo in
Egitto?) and that we shall
presently be whistling the
Italian for “ What Maisie
Knew" 2

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE are parts of Stella Maris (John LANE) that show
the art of Mr. W. J. LocKE at its very best—delicate,
tender, high-fantastical. There are also parts in which it
might almost be classed with the melodrama of commerce,
and others that come dangerously near the simply senti-
mental. Take him for all in all, however, Mr. LocKE can
blend a mixture of romance and realism more nicely than
perhaps any other living writer; and the result, if unequal,
is delightfully stimulating. Moreover, Stella Maris has the
advantage of two excellent and unhackneyed ideas. On the
one hand, Stella herself, the seemingly hopeless invalid,
into the dream-life of whose guarded room no idea of pain
or sorrow is allowed to penetrate—restore such a being to
everyday life, plunge her, a woman in years, less than a child
in experience, into the battle of realities, and what will
happen? This is one, the more beautiful, of the two motives
of the book. The other concerns a man who, married in
name only to a human horror whose cruelty to a child-
servant has resulted in public scandal and imprisonment,
himself adopts the victim in an effort at reparation. What
came of this experiment of John Risca with the little drudge
Unity; how he and Walter Herold, the actor, both loved
and tended Stella, at first with the passionate pity of strong
men towards a suffering child, later with another kind of
passion, and which of them won her in the end, all this
you shall find out. On the last point I was myself in
doubt—a rare experience—up to the very page that settled
the matter. On the whole, a charming and moving story,
told in a style that at times rises to actual beauty. I make
Mr. LocKE my felicitations and thanks. -
Miss MARGARET WATson purports to write of village life,
but if she should cast her mind back over the events of her
story, His Dear Desire (SMITH, ELDER), she must herself be
astounded at their number and magnitude. Most of the
villagers were at one time or another on the verge of sudden
death, and one at least of them succumbed to it. Another
was the victim of violent dipsomania; a third was guilty of,
among other things, embezzlement; a fourth was appre-
hended for a supposed murder, and of the others those
who were not put in jeopardy by the fire at the Hall
were involved in the financial crash of a local Building
Society. Hardly a day passed in Clayford and the neigh-
bourhood but an incident occurred which would have
engaged the best part of the attention of the British press,
and yet the inhabitants were with it all the most simple
and unsophisticated people in the world. These weighty
affairs, mark you, were but side issues, briefly noticed and
contrived merely to demonstrate character; the central plot
was quite other and consisted in the love of Emily Dormer for
the dipsomaniac, the passion of the pseudo-murderer for his
mill, and the pervading and prevailing humanity of Parson
Power, matters much less stupendous but much more con-
vincing. The truth is that Miss WATson has done excellently
with her village but gone all wrong with its life. She has
done what so many amateurs, if I may use that expression
without offence, do; she has studied life as it is, and life
as it is depicted in the lower grade novel, contemporaneously,
and has got the two mixed up. This has proved unfortunate

but not, I am glad to say, fatal. If the constant recurrence
of the incredible tends to destroy the charm of a very human
book, it does not wholly succeed. Some country folk emerge
from the turmoil unscathed and delightfully unspoilt.
I am positively appalled by the number of young men
who appear to be going about in contemporary fiction
paying what seem honourable addresses to heroines, only
for these distressed damsels to discover in the next chapter
the existence of insane wives. The thing seems to be
becoming an obsession with our novelists; and the latest
victim is Miss Isabel, SMITH, whose Nevertheless (ALSTON
Rivers) tells it all over again; not badly, but hardly well
enough to invest so worn a theme with any special interest.
By the way, why Nevertheless, I have been unable to dis-
cover; the tale might just
as well have been ‘ called
But, or Well, well, or (and
with some excuse in the
behaviour of the chief
characters) Tut-tut. These
protagonists are Sara Gale
and one Martel, fellow-
inmates of an old suburban
mansion turned into a kind
of boarding-house. Because
Martel had a clear-cut pro-
file, no manners, and a
general way of wiping the
ground with his female
society, Sara (who was
evidently a disciple of Jame
Eyre) loved him. So she
really need not have been
so much astonished to hearl
of the lunatic wife, as afore-
said. But she was. Then
of course Martel asked her
not to mind about man-
made laws, and Sara, after
holding out till almost the
end of the book (even en-
during the horrors of an
evangelical boarding-house
at Eastbourne, described by
the author with much zest)

men can die of too much tropical Asia, and how it is not
only natives that sometimes are driven to run amok and to
cast off the shackles of officialdom and civilization, and
become just their revengeful, cruel, savage, primitive selves.
But that is only because they are affected by their environ-
ment, which is gradually being changed for the better by
the self-sacrifice of these very men. Some day the bad old
past will have gone altogether, to the great advantage of
all concerned. And meanwhile it has given us Malayan
Monochromes.
Although I have not read a vast majority of the fifty or
sixty books that stand to the credit of “KATHARINETYNAN,”
I make bold to say that none
of them can be more fragrant
than Mrs. Pratt of Paradise
Farm (SMITH, ELDER). The
farm possessed a garden of
the lavender - sweet - pea-
rosemary kind, a splendid
view, old furniture—in fact,
everything that mortal man
could want, except a bath-
room. And then-crown-

tained Mrs. Pratt herself.

My salaams to Sir Hugh CLIFFoRD. He has lived a good
part of his life in the Straits Settlements, and knows a thing
or two about them. As a writer he has the true “Maga"
touch, which is often, I think, at its strongest when it
draws, for us stay-at-homes, the lives and thoughts of the
dark-skinned races at the outposts of the Empire. In his
Malayan Monochromes (John MURRAY) the shadows are as
dark as REMBRANDT would have painted them, as dense as
the impenetrable forests of the Peninsula. For his high
lights he uses only the warm red of blood, that turns black
almost as soon as it is shed, whether it has flowed in
Malayan or English veins. As I read his stories, es-

(By one in search of the perfect hermitage.)
My tastes are modest and my needs are small —
Three bright and lofty chambers (parquet floor),
Each thirty feet or so by twenty-four,
With bathroom (entered from an airy hall)
Where hot and cold habitually run;
And such a set of aspects that the sun
Laves me in light the whole day long. That's all.
They must be central—somewhere like Pall Mall;
In touch with London's throbbing heart, or hub,
And fairly near the Athenæum Club
And restaurants; yet silent as a well,
For here no taxi-hooters must intrudo
To jar upon the meditative mood
Or operate against the Muse's spell.
For service—just one handmaid, nice and neat;
A valet, soft of foot; a chef of wits
For homely dinners based upon the Ritz;
And, at his post abutting on the street,
A liveried page to brush me for the Park,
Vigilant of my wants, yet slow to mark
What ladies most affect my fair retreat.

And for inclusive rent I’d gladly pay.

THE BURNING QUESTION.
Should smoking be allowed in the auditorium of
theatres?' That is the question which is agitating London,
Sir ARTHUR WING PINEno and Mr. SHAw. * *
Sir Sidney Lee writes: Sir ARTHUR PINEno's suggestion
entails merely a return to a fine old custom. Smoking in
theatres, like Polar exploration, was a common Elizabethan
practice. Personally I am with SHAKSPEARE in preferring
the aroma of tobacco to the perfume of asphyxiated flowers
which generally fills the air of the stalls. As the Swan
said, “Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.”
Mr. HAMMERSTEIN writes: I am convinced that my failure
to run opera in London was due to my omission to supply
tobacco in the auditorium. If I had my time over again
and attempted once more to popularise good music I should
inscribe above the proscenium the Virgilian motto, Ludere
calamo agresti (which, I am told, may be translated, “To
amuse oneself with the rustic pipe”), and I would present
every member of my audience with a high-class Clay (a
Churchwarden, not a Henry). -
Mr. BERNARD SHAw writes: I am strongly in favour of
smoking in theatres. I recently implored my audience
not to laugh at me, and a pipe or a cigar between their
lips would probably stop their hilarity far more effectually
than anything I could say. -
Mr. GoRDON CRAIG writes: I am quite indifferent on this
subject. Nothing that could happen in any ordinary
theatre nowadays could possibly have a deteriorating effect
on the Drama.
Dr. SALEEBY writes: The ideal conditions for smoking
are exactly those which obtain in the modern theatre. The
body should be at ease and the mind at rest. Any intellectual
effort at once diverts the nicotinous juices from their
mission (which in these ideal circumstances they accomplish)
of correcting the tendency of the hypercutaneous corpuscles
towards excessive excoriation.
Mr. P. A. VAILE writes: The only objection I have to
smoking in theatres or elsewhere is that not one man in
a hundred and not one woman in a thousand knows how
to do it. From his earliest childhood the Englishman is
taught to smoke on principles which are scientifically
unsound. In addressing the pipe, for instance, the pressure
for the in-draught should be applied upwards from the
chin, and that for the out-draught downwards from the
nose, the head being kept rigid and the neck being used as
a pivot to counteract ...op-spin. In practice all professional
smokers do this, but they are unaware of it, and in
teaching they advise exactly the opposite. Messrs.
Glamon and Suckstein (who, by the way, are strong
supporters of smoking in theatres) recently tested this
under my direction with a specially devised quick-firing
pneumatic hookah fitted with ball-bearings.
Mrs. ELLA WHEELER WILCox distils the essence of sanity
in the following illuminating quatrain:—
The man who cannot concentrate his mind
Upon the dramas of the BARD of Avos
Without reliance upon Nicotine, you'll find
Is probably an intellectual craven.
Little TICH says: I am all in favour of people smoking
so long as they confine themselves to Little Tichinopolies."
Mr. CHIozzA MoREY pronounces strongly against tobacco
in theatres on economic grounds. The money wasted on
cigarettes alone by the youth of the country would, he
maintains, be sufficient to defray the additional cost of fixing
the starting age of old age pensions at 65 instead of 70.
Mr. MASTERMAN, on the other hand, has the greatest
belief in tobacco as promoting equanimity and diffusing
an atmosphere of placid contentment so desirable in an
audience. He continues, “I do not think I am violating
any pledge of secrecy when I say that, had it not been for
the demands of National Defence, the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER would have made provision in his Budget for
the supplying of free cigarettes to all occupants of the pit
and gallery in our theatres.” . -
Mr. ALFRED AUSTIN writes: I can endure tobacco in
Veronica's green-house, but not in the theatre." As a great
poet remarks:— - * - - - * * *
“It is the most malevolent of deeds * *
To choke fine flowers of speech with noxious weeds.” -
Mr. J. M. BARRIE : I express no opinion beyond this—
that if smoking is permitted the tobacco must be the right
brand. You know quite well which it is. . . . . . .
Mr. ALFRED BUTT : I like to see the audience in full blast
when PAvLovA dances, but it would give me little pleasure
to witness a similarly contented body of persons at a musical
comedy. - - - - -
Psychic communication with certain of the illustrious
dead having been set up—we will not say how, but possibly
through the agency of the Elysian Marconi Company
(shares not yet on the market)—the following opinions on
the great questions have been elicited:—
Sir WALTER RAL:IGH: The notion takes me. If it be
good (as I hold) to drink tobacco, then is it good to drink
it wherever you may be. Moreover, there are, I am told,
certain plays and players that would be rendered more
decent if a cloud of Virginia intervened between ye spectator
and ye stage.

At noon the little fellow slipped away.
Please take him back,
Dut do not say, “Tut, tut, a nasty crack;"
Decause he had none. Of your guidance lorn,
Faint for the loving hand that soothed and nursed,
His spirit to the shadowy realm was borne
The fifth time, I believe, since Jan. the first ;
And every swound
Meant cash to you; your black arts brought him round.
That little flower-like face, that poor pale ghost,
How often have I looked and yearned to him;
Yet always he preferred you as a host,
Always, deprived of you, his voice grew dim.
He pined for you;
Take him, and tell me, Merlin, was it “flu"?
Toy with the curly hair-spring of my pet
And smile the old smile that he understands,
And put the dice-box in your eye and set
In motion once again the fluttering hands;
Poke him about
And prod his works up; give him malt and stout;
But never more return him. Let him be
Here at the very hub of temporal power
And hearken to his friends eternally,
And know what trustful glances, hour by hour,
On you they fix,
Following your will like sheep—with strong calm ticks.
And now and then I will return and sit
And nurse him for a moment in your shop,
And ask him how he is and if he's fit,
And turn the little screw round at the top,
And muse anon
On those wild times we had in brave years gone.
And if you like it, Merlin, when I come,
For food and lodging and for oil and wraps
I will disburse to you a trifling sum;
And, thank you, now you mention it, perhaps
You too might make
Some gift to soothe my dole. Ten bob I'll take.

nomenclature. When the holidays
came they fled together to the sea-side.
Gay and debonair, they were known
to every landlady on the South Coast.
The Post Office—father of us all—still
pleads with them to come back to
the neglected boarding-houses. At
Christmas it offers charades at Margate.
At Midsummer it reminds them that
there are bathrooms and motor-garages
at Brighton and Bournemouth.
Quest and his sister, Miss Quest,
were devoted to railway shares and to
each other. I think—though of this I
am not sure—that they were twins.
If Quest bought a share in the Cale-
donian, his sister went round next day
and bought another. Once Quest was
persuaded by a friend to buy a share in
a furniture company. Loyal to the
core, Miss Quest resolved that they
should flourish or perish together. She
also bought a share. They were not
ruined, but they were disappointed.
Afterwards they stuck to railways.
The Post Office has never forgotten
their passionate attachment. It often
sends them letters—always in pairs.
The letters are exactly alike inside and
out, save for the names—“Miss Quest,”
“Septimus Quest, Esq." Usually they
are fascinating documents, all about
railways. But sometimes there is a
sly little dig about that adventure in
ſurniture.
There were four of the Nicklins.
Mrs. Nicklin was colourless. She was
overshadowed by her children. Even
the Post Office is vague about her. It
hesitates between “Mrs.” and “Mr. or
Mrs.”
Young Nicklin, known in the Post
Office as “James S. Nicklin, Esq."—
“Sammy," to his friends—was a dandy.
He was very particular (I gather) about
his clothes. His hair was resplendent
but getting a little thin. His friends
must have twitted him, I think, about
a slight tendency to corpulence, and in
all probability he was greatly annoyed
about this. The Post Office sends him
occasional copies of “Men's Wear,”
and bright little booklets about hair
preparatiºns. It implores him—ma-
licious old jester—to try a physical
culture school.
Miss Nicklin went about with her
father. Her brother was too busy to
worry about her. They were very keen
about literary societies, especially those
with a Celtic fringe. The Post Office,
with its usual good feeling, always
addresses them conjointly as “Mr. and
Miss Nicklin." -
There are other ghosts. Symons was
19n intimate terms with His Majesty's
|Government. The Post Office speaks
of him respectfully as “O.H.M.S.”
Miss Clauston once went to an evening
class. The Post Offic knows this and
never ceases to regret that she didn't
keep it up. It remembers too the
penny packet of nasturtium seeds that
her brother bought, heaven knows
how many years ago. It sends him a
reminder every year. Occasionally it
sends a sports catalogue to “Master
Pottle.” He may be married now with
a boy of his own, but the Post Office
clings affectionately to the memory of
the sturdy young rascal it once knew.
It remembers the fads and tastes of
everyone—of Miss Green who liked
sherry, and J. Brown, Esq., who in-
clined to Irish whiskey; of Miss Black
who adored sale lists, and Mr. White
who preferred book catalogues.
Some day I shall leave this flat.
For a week or two the landlord will
vaguely regret “a good tenant"—and
then he will forget. The milkman will
cease to recall my habits. The book-
binder will think no more of my end-
papers and about not sprinkling the
edges.
But I know—and there is comfort in
the thought—that when all others have
forgotten, the Post Office will remember.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GETTING MARRIED.
II.-FURNISHING.
“By the way,” said Celia suddenly,
“what have you done about the
fixtures?” .
“Nothing,” I replied truthfully.
“Well, we must do something about
them.” . º -
“Yes. My solicitor—he shall do
something about them. Don't let's
talk about them now. I've only got
three hours more with you, and then I
must dash back to my work.”
I must say that any mention of
fixtures has always bored me intensely.
When it was a matter of getting a
house to live in I was all energy. As
soon as Celia had found it, I put my
solicitor on to it; and within a month
I had signed my name in two places,
and was the owner of a highly-resi-
dential flat in the best part of the
neighbourhood. But my effort so
exhausted me that I have felt utterly
unable since to cope with the question
of the curtain-rod in the bath-room or
whatever it is that Celia means by
fixtures. These things will arrange
themselves somehow, I feel confident.
Meanwhile the decorators are hard
at work. A thrill of pride inflates me
when I think of the decorators at
work. I don't know how they got
there; I suppose I must have ordered
them. Celia says that she ordered
them and chose all the papers herself,
and that all I did was to say that the
papers she had chosen were very
pretty; but this doesn't sound like me
in the least. I am convinced that I
was the man of action when it came to
ordering decorators.
“And now,” said Celia one day, “we
can go and choose the electric-light
fittings.”
“Celia,” I said in admiration, “you're
a wonderful person. I should have
forgotten all about them.”
“Why, they're about the most im-
portant thing in the flat.”
“Somehow I never regarded any-
body as choosing them. I thought
they just grew in the wall. From
bulbs.”
When we got into the shop Celia
became businesslike at once.
“We'd better start with the hall,”
she told the man.
“Everybody else will have to,” I
said, “so we may as well.”
“What sort of a light did you want
there 2'' he asked.
“A strong one,” I said; “so as to be
able to watch our guests carefully when
they pass the umbrella stand.”
Celia waved me away and explained
that we wanted a hanging lantern.
It appeared that this shop made a
speciality not so much of the voltage
as of the lamps enclosing it.
“How do you like that 2" asked the
man, pointing to a magnificent affair
in brass. He wandered off to a switch
and turned it on.
“Dare you ask him the price?” I
asked Celia. “It looks to me about a
thousand pounds. If it is, say that
you don't like the style. Don't let him
think we can't afford it.”
“Yes,” said Celia, in a careless sort
of way. “I’m not sure that I care
about that. How much is it 2."
“Two pounds.”
I was not going to show my relief.
“Without the light, of course?” I said
disparagingly.
“How do you think it would look in
the hall ?” said Celia to me.
“I think our guests would be en-
couraged to proceed. They'd see that
we were pretty good people.”
“I don’t like it. It's too ornate.”
“Then show us something less
ornate,” I told the man sternly.
He showed us things less ornate.
At the end of an hour Celia said she
thought we'd better get on to another
room, and come back to the hall after-
wards. We decided to proceed to the
drawing-room.
“We must go all out over these,”
said Celia; “I want these to be really
beautiful.”
At the end of another hour Celia
said she thought we'd better get on to
my workroom. My workroom, as the
name implies, is the room to which I
am to retire when I want complete
quiet. Sometimes I shall go there
after lunch . . . and have it.
“We can come back to the drawing-
room afterwards,” she said. “It’s
really very important that we should
get the right ones for that. Your room
won't be so difficult, but of course you
must have awfully nice ones.”
I looked at my watch.
“It's a quarter to one,” I said. “At
2.15 on the 17th of June we are due
at St. Miriam's. If you think we
shall have bought anything by then,
let's go on. If, as seems to me, there
is no hope at all, then let's have lunch
to-day anyhow. After lunch we may
be able to find some way out of the
impasse.”
After lunch I had an idea.
“This afternoon,” I said, “we will
begin to get some furniture together.”
“But what about the electric fit-
tings? We must finish off those.”
“This is an experiment. I want to
see if we can buy a chest of drawers.
It may just be our day for it.”
“And we settle the fittings to-
morrow. Yes 2 ''
“I don't know. We may not want
them. It all depends on whether we
can buy a chest of drawers this after-
noon. If we can't, then I don't see
how we can ever be married on the
17th of June. Somebody's got to be,
because I've engaged the church. The
question is whether it's going to be us.
Let's go and buy a chest of drawers
this afternoon, and see.”
The old gentleman in the little shop
Celia knew of was delighted to see us.
“Chestesses? Ah, you 'ave come to
the right place.” He led the way into
the depths. “There now. There's a
chest—real old, that is.” He gave it
a hearty smack. “You don't see a
chest like that nowadays. They can't
make 'em. Three pound ten. You
couldn't have got that to-morrer.
“I knew it was our day,” I said.
“Real old, that is. Spanish me'ogany,
all oak lined. That's right, Sir, pull
the drawers out and see for yourself.
Let the lady se?. There's no imitation
there, lady. A real old chest, that is.
Come in 'ere in a week and you'd have
to pay five pounds for it. Me'ogany's
going up, you see, that's how.”
“Well?” I said to Celia.
“It's perfectly sweet. Hadn't we
better see some more?”
We saw two more. Doth of them
Spanish me'ogany, oak lined, pull-the-
drawers-out-and-see-for-yourself-lady.
Half-an-hour passed rapidly.
“Well ?” I said."
“I really don't know which I like
best. Which do you?” * .
“The first ; it 's nearer the door.”
“There's another shop just over the
way. We'd better just look there too,
and then we can come back to decide
to-morrow.”
We went out. I glanced at my watch.
It was 3.30, and we were being married
at 2.15 on June 17th.
“Wait a moment,” I said, “I’ve
forgotten my gloves.”
I may be a slow starter, but I am
very firm when roused. I went into
the shop, wrote a cheque for the three
chests of drawers, and told the man
where to send them. When I returned,
Celia was at the
pulling the drawers out of a real old
mahogany chest which was standing
on the pavement outside.
“This is even better,” she said.
“It's perfectly adorable. I wonder if
it's more expensive.”
“I'll just ask,” I said.
I went in and, without an unnecessary
word, bought that the t too. Then I
came back to Celia. It was 3.45, and
on June 17th at 2.15 Well, we
had four chest 5 of drawei's towards it.
“Celia,” I said, “we may just do it
yet.” A. A. M.
I'd
have sold it for four pound to-morrer.”

CHARIVARI.
PUNCH,
OR THE LONDON
ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE WASEFUL.
ONCE upon a time a little company
of the wild flowers of Spring found
themselves together in a vase. It was
the first time that many of them had
met; for although they came from the
same district, indeed the same copse,
and had heard of each other's character-
istics, they had grown up too far away
from each other for conversation, and
flowers, of course, cannot walk. It was
therefore with peculiar interest that
they now examined each other and fell
a-talking.
There was naturally a little hesitation
at first, for social grades must be pre-
served; but they were so tightly packed
in the vase, and for the most part so
forlorn at their fate, that barriers soon
disappeared, and the oxlip ceased to
despise the cowslip, and the cowslip
was quite nice to the primrose, and
the purple orchis almost dropped his
aristocratic drawl when talking to the
bluebell.
The purple orchis, who was not only
a heavy drinker but rather a bully, was
the only one who was not unhappy to
be there. “I knew I should attract
attention soon,” he said; “there were
, so few of us and we're so noticeable.
By Jove, this tipple's delicious !” and
he took a long draught.
“Please don't push so,” said a small
voice at his side.
“Why, what's the matter?” the
orchis asked. “You anemones are
always such weaklings.”
“I’m afraid I feel rather faint,”
replied the anemone. “I’m not strong
at any time, it's true, and just now, no
matter how I stretch, I can't quite
reach the water. I'm afraid that little
girl put me in the vase rather care-
lessly; her hand was a little too hot,
too.”
“Or else”—the orchis laughed—“or
else I’m getting more than my share.
Ha, ha!”
“Surely,” said a cowslip to a bluebell,
“there were more of you in the little
girl's hands when we left the wood?”
“Alas, yes,” said the bluebell.
“Most of my closest friends were
picked too, and I hoped we were all
coming along together so that we
might at least cheer each other as we
perished. To die in a crowd is easier,
I have always heard. But for some
reason or other which has never been
explained to me bluebells seem to be
more easily and more often thrown
away after being picked than any other
flower; and all my companions must
have suffered that common fate.”
“It is quite true,” said the cowslip.

I have again and again seen bunches
of bluebells forsaken by children. How
is it, I wonder? It is not as if they
were ugly; although blue is not every-
one's colour.”
“Perhaps,” said the cuckoo-spit with
a touch of sarcasm, for he disliked the
cowslip, “it’s because you can't make
tea of them.”
“No,” said the oxlip, who was
looked up to as something of a sage by
reason of his strength and his many
eyes, “it is because bluebells are so
much more beautiful when they are in
a wood among greenery than when
they are packed together in a human
hand, and the human hand suddenly
realises this and drops them in dis-
appointment.”
“Thank you,” said the bluebell with
a sigh of content.
“The wonder,” the oxlip continued
with a glance at the cuckoo-spit, “is
that some flowers are ever picked at
all.”
Silence followed, broken by a little
sigh. It was the dying anemone's last
breath.

MAHOLI, your pawl you're the fellow for me,

With your neat little snout, and your fine pair of eyes,
And your soft coat of fur, and your air of surprise,
As if you were puzzled to know how the deu-

In the realms that you left when you went aboard ship, oh,
You're missed by the rhino and mourned by the hippo;
And the elephant, munching his rice or his sago,

There are beasts left in plenty, but none, it appears,
Who can please all the others by folding his ears.
And now that you're with us–mirabile dictu !—
Will our looks and our clothes and our bearing afflict you?
When we come to the Zoo shall we soothe or alarm you?
Will our features offend or our converse disarm you?
I know only this: if we talk you to tears
You can always get even by folding your ears.
Henceforth I shall practise for clubs and such places
This method of moving the flaps of our faces;
And when I am pinned by a bore or a boress
With second-hand jokes or with story-book stories,

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Monday, April 21,–
After period of what was practically
self-effacement noble Lords assemble
for a field-day. Flags are flying, drums
beating, trumpets blaring. Appointed
business Second Reading of Army
Annual Bill. Opportunity seized to
renew attack, opened on Thursday, upon
home defence policy of the Government
in general, the Territorial Army in par-
ticular.

himself again. Costume of Lord Chan-
cellor, with which irony of fate invests
him, obviously unsuited for military
manoeuvres. But he wears his wig with
a difference and wraps his gown about
him as if it were a martial cloak. One
fancies there is visible recrudescence
of the historic Napoleonic curl culti-
vated when he represented War Office
in the Commons. It may be merely
accidental arrangement of front frill of
full-bottomed wig. That a detail.
No mistake about temporary trans-
formation of the man of law into man
of war.
Peculiar interest attached to speech
of Wiscount MIDLETON leading attack
on Government on vital question of
state of preparation for war and posses-
sion of adequate means to carry it on.
Recognised that he speaks as one having
authority, not as an amateur critic.
He was a member of the Government
responsible, after long possession of
office, for state of the Army called upon
fourteen years ago to save the Empire
threatened by President KRüGER's
Territorial Forces. For a period
darkened by densest cloud of disaster
in the field he was in personal control
of the War Office. What he has to
say upon present state of the Army,
what counsel to give for its improve-
ment, are matters worthy of closest
attention.
With sickening of heart noble lords
heard the anxiously awaited verdict.
The ST. John BRODRICK of Boer War
days had looked round upon con-
dition of Army under present Adminis-
tration, and behold ! it was hopelessly
bad. Since HALDANE framed his scheme
in 1907, the peril confronting the
Empire had increased, whilst means
of grappling with it had diminished.
“What is the noble Wiscount at 2 ”
snapped LoRD CHANCELLOR, evidently
touched to the quick. “What does he
want? Does he want us to go back
to the condition of things in 1903? If
he does, does anybody else want us to
do it?”
Rather a nasty one that. But LoRD

with back to the wall (to be precise, to
the Woolsack), presently overwhelmed
by combined onslaught. Strong
language used. CURzoN described
NAPoleoN B. as “the greatest master
of copious irrelevance the House of
Lords has ever known.” DENBIGH
hurled at him declaration that in the
matter of national armament “all the
slackers, funkers, wasters and loafers
are on the Liberal side.” AMPTHILL
protested that the Government “trifled
and fooled with the vital question.”
This storm, through which whistled
a flight of bullets, seemed to lead to
crushing defeat of a criminal Govern-
ment equally ignorant and impotent.
But at approach of dinner-hour the
signal “Cease firing!” sounded,
and at twenty minutes past eight
The old warrior leads the attack.
(Viscount MIDLETON.)
House adjourned. Second Reading
of Army Bill agreed to without
division. -
Business done.—In the Commons
Collection of Taxes Bill read a third
time and passed. Members sat up late
with the Suffragettes released on licence.
Amongst many amendments moved in
Committee on Prisoners' (Temporary
Discharge for Ill-Health) Bill, McCURDY
proposed to omit its application to a
female prisoner who had been forcibly
fed, “unless such feeding had been with
her consent.” After puzzling some time
over this prime bull from Northampton,
Committee sent it to grass by 229 votes
to 49.
House of Commons, Tuesday.—LLOYD
GEORGE's speech this afternoon ex-
pounding Budget marked striking
change of fashion in respect of concep-
tion and fashioning of leading feature
of the Session. Time was when the
Chancellor was at infinite pains to
endow the uninviting figures of his
financial scheme with the grace of
oratory and the charm of scholarship.
Above all there was a peroration, and
an expectant House would have felt
itself defrauded had this not been forth-
coming.
LLoyd GEORGE's speech, delivered
to audience falling something short of
number usually mustered on such
occasions, was a plain business state-
ment, comparatively brief, superlatively
lucid. Nothing in the way of perora-
tion as commonly understood. Wily
CHANCELLoR had another card up his
sleeve, and at proper moment triumph-
antly played it.
When, his task accomplished, he
seemed about to resume his seat, he
pulled himself together and proposed
to answer his own question, “What
have the Government done since they
came into office?” Amid resounding
cheers from delighted Ministerialists,
their hearts already cheered by an-
nouncement that, in spite of increased
expenditure approaching seven millions
in excess of actual revenue of 1912–13,
no new taxes would be imposed, he
totted up the sum.
To begin with, reversing practice
established and pursued by late Govern-
ment, instead of borrowing to meet
increased expenditure on Naval and
Military works, leaving posterity to
pay the bill, it is provided for out of
revenue of the year. Taxes on food
have been reduced by five million
pounds. Taxes on small incomes and
agricultural cottage repairs have been
lessened by half that sum. An addi-
tional twelve millions sterling has been
provided for National Defence; whilst
twenty millions have been expended in
making easier the lot of the aged poor,

Gudge's shop. He, poor fellow, is half
demented, and I am told his wife is
now beating him for his negligence in
not putting up the shutters. I hope
you now understand that what you
thought was washing were signals of
distress.”
I said nothing to Phyllis about these
letters; women, I have found, do not
appreciate the finer shades of diplomacy.
With a calm eagerness I awaited the
landlord's next letter. It came soon
and it was to the point. Steps, it
appeared this time, were to be taken at
once, and in the latter part of his note
he went so far as to cast doubts on my
veracity. A solicitor to whom I showed
it said that if it had been on a postcard
it would have been actionable. I
determined to make a courteous and
dignified reply. These were its terms:–
“You appear to be under the im-
pression that washing is hung out to
dry in the garden of Cactus Cottage.
I have twice endeavoured to remove
that impression. Let me now make a
final effort. Had you, last Tuesday,
passed our pleasant and capacious
garden (18ft. by 12ft.) you might reason-
ably have said to yourself, ‘That is a
clothes-line and those are (or that is)
washing.” What would have been the
real facts? Early in the morning an
enormous flock of seagulls (a white
bird, as you know) came and surrounded
the house. It was impossible to drive
them away; it is no use saying 'Shoo,
shoo,' to a hundred birds at a time.
There they were and there they re-
mained all day. Why they came so
far inland is a point of great ornitho-
logical interest. The long spell of cold
wet weather may have something to do
with it. Or can seagulls be changing
their habits and becoming inland
birds? I trust this matter is now ex-
plained and laid to rest for ever.
Yours, etc.”
To my disappointment he made no
reference in his reply to the seagulls
(of whom I was rather proud). All he
said was, “Your tenancy terminates on
25th inst. No further correspondence
is desired.”
This was rather rude, but it takes
two to make a quarrel and only one to
make a correspondence, so I wrote him
a farewell letter:—
“DEAR SIR,--I see with pain that
you refuse to accept any of my
numerous explanations. I am sorry,
genuinely sorry, because I should have
liked to give you some more, and I
really think they got better and better.
However, my conscience is clear and
I shall depart with pleasure to some
YOURSELF.”

I read this letter to Phyllis. She had
forgotten all about the whole subject.
“What is it 2 ” she said. “Is it a

“It’s a business letter,” I said, “one
of the best I ever wrote. It's to the
landlord.”
“Well, I'm glad you've given him
notice. But what does it all mean 2 ”
“It means,” I said, “that England
is a free country, and that we can hang
out our washing where we like.”
“I knew that already,” said Phyllis.

ROSE-TIME.
Mr. Harold Honeybunn, of “The
Bulbuls,” Syringa Lane, Meadowsweet
Avenue, Surbiton, sat in his study
surrounded by a sea of catalogues and
Sunday papers opened at the adver-
tisement pages. He was frowning
portentously.
“What's the trouble 2" asked Mrs.
Honeybunn, descending from the
nursery.
“I’m trying to decide what roses to
plant in the garden,” he explained.
"It's very difficult to make up one's
mind. Listen to this, my dear. ‘Gold
Medal Rose. Snaggs's Champion of
Europe. The most sensational rose
ever produced. Its truly entrancing
colour is a deep militant orange-ver-
milion-sunflower, shading to the most
exquisite tinges of pearly-opal peach-
blossom. Guaranteed unfadeable, un-
breakable, unapproachable. Our colours
never run Price 29/- a dozen.’”
“It sounds all right.”
“Yes; but listen to this next adver-
tisement: “Roses. A world's wonder!
The most thrilling product of horti-
cultural science Wilks's Glory of the
Globe. Its colour is indescribably
beautiful, starting with the tenderest
shades of tropical dawn; deepening to
a dreamy, creamy, satin-pink salmon;
and then strengthing to a robust straw-
berry-maroon-scarlet. Its scent can
only be compared to a bouquet of
honeysuckle, verbena, heliotrope, opo-
ponax, jockey club and crème de menthe.
Beware of crude imitations listed by
unscrupulous dealers as unfadeable.
We guarantee our roses as rain-proof,
wind-proof, hail-proof and burglar-
proof. Price 28- a dozen. Make it
two guineas, and we throw in a lawn-
mower.’”
“Have them sent on approval,” sug-
gested the practical Mrs. Honeybunn.
“They don't mention on approval'
in the advertisements.”
“All the more reason for asking for
it.”
“Very well, my dear, I will. I'll
write also for Mungo's Guinea Collec-
tion of Tip-Top Novelties. Listen to
what you get for the guinea: ‘Emperor
of the Sahara, Crown Princess Cecilie
of Hohenzollern, Omar Khayyam's
Delight, Götterdämmerung, Rêve des
Amoureux, Mrs. Albert Mungo, Giuli-
etta's Balcony, Butterflies' Banquet,
H.T.’ What does H.T. mean 2''
“Highly tempting,” suggested Mrs.
Honeybunn.
“Perhaps so. And they include ‘the
very extra special, three star, treble nap
Lloyd-Georgiana, the most audaciously
flavoured rose ever produced. These
nine roses would cost you three guineas
from any other dealer. Beware of
imitations, because they are grown only
by ourselves and are fully protected by
provisional patents. Write at once,
and do it now !' . . . Isn't that a fine
lot? The only one I don't fancy is
Mrs. Albert Mungo. Perhaps they
would send another Rêve des Amoureux
instead.” --
“You might ask. In any case, have
them sent on approval.” -
“I wonder if they send roses that
way?” mused Mr. Honeybunn, reach-
ing for the pen and ink.

They didn't. “Cash with order” was
the business motto of Messrs. Snaggs,
Wilks & Mungo. They wrote him to
that effect. -
Mr. Honeybunn sent cash.
The two - and - three - quarter-dozen
plants came by return of post.
He unwrapped them proudly in front
of Bodlin, the jobbing gardener of
Meadowsweet Avenue and vicinity.
Bodlin carried the wisdom of ages in
his wrinkled countenance. Bodlin
sniffed—a sniff from which there was
no appeal.
“Why, what's the matter?” faltered
Mr. Honeybunn.
“Why didn't they tell me you was
going to order roses?” returned the
garden expert.
“Why should I? They're all ex-
pensive, guaranteed roses. This is a
Snaggs's Champion of Europe; that
one is a Glory of the Globe; that one
is a Butterflies' Banquet. H.T.,” added
Mr. Honeybunn in a vain effort to
impress Bodlin.
“You can't grow them on this garden
soil—not to do yourself any credit,”
came the Caesarian decision.
Mr. Honeybunn's jaw dropped. “Oh!”
he offered. -
“You ought to have stuck to the
good old varieties, like Cabbage and
France and Dorothy Perkins. They're
hardy. These"—Bodlin waved them
away with Napoleonic finality—“these
don't suit you. Send 'em back, is my
advice.”
“But I've bought them.”
“You mean that you paid for 'em
before you knew whether they suited?”
“Yes,” confessed Mr. Honeybunn.
Bodlin looked worlds of wisdom.

That evening, Amy returned from a
London shopping expedition burdened
with small parcels and flushed with
success.
“The greatest bargain you've ever
seen " she announced triumphantly.
“What is it 2" asked her husband.
“A Paris model. Creamy-white,
with just a simple aigrette of salmon-
pink. The most daring, the most
delicious hat you've ever seen 1 At
Madame Fantine's in Bond Street.
Sale price—I got it for two guineas'
They've promised to send it to-
night.” - -
“There's a parcel just arrived—it's
been taken upstairs.”
“Then come and see me try it on.”
Mr. Honeybunn watched the trying-
on process with judicial gravity.
“Well?”
“It’s pretty enough in its way,”
answered Mr. Honeybunn with an un-
conscious assumption of the Bodlin
manner, “but it doesn't suit you.”
“Look again!"
“It doesn't suit you,” came the
Napoleonic decision. “Send it back,
is my advice.” -
“Oh "
“Of course it's not paid for yet?”
“But it is.”
“You mean to say you've paid for
a hat before you knew whether it
suited you?” - -
“Yes,” confessed Mrs. Honeybunn.
“So you must go to Madame Fantine's
to-morrow and get them to take it
back.”

“You must say there's been a
sudden bereavement in the family and
I can't wear colours.”
Mr. Honeybunn pondered over this
brilliant idea for some moments.

make the very same excuse about the
roses?”

DEAR, by fond experience taught,
I can do what you expect,
Almost always read your thought,
Follow you when you reflect.
When you wear a tragic pose
And a mallet in your muff,
Well I know your thoughts are those
Of the Pankian Suff.
When I see your dear eyes turn
To the glass above the grate,
Then I know you fain would learn
If your hair is still on straight;
Or that haply thus you seek
(Rather anxiously) to know
If the dimple on your cheek
Keeps its status quo.
Still at times you baffle quite
All my trained deductive art.
Take, for instance, yesternight,
When you led that fatal heart;
Were your thoughts of summer dress,
Or the beauty that's the bard's?
This alone was plain to guess—
They were not of cards.

AN OLD HOUSE.
GREAT Rome was raised on hill-tops
Seven,
In pomp to all the winds of Heaven
Her brazen eagles flew;
I know an old house in a hollow,
Its white walls harled with good
Scots halling;
Here haunts at dawn the gossip
starling, -
Here comes the first returning swallow
When skies are egg-shell blue.
Great Rome she walled eternal glory—
The fame that rang in camp and story
, Still to her stones belongs;
The old house shadows — quaint and
fragrant—
A garden famed for stocks and roses,
Where, when asummer evening closes,
Old borders bloom, half-guessed and
vagrant, -
Like echoes of old songs |
Great Rome she wardened miles of
marches; -
From Afric's palms to Albion's larches
Her clamorous trumpets went ;
Here are for its sedate controlling
But some few scores of sunny acres
Fruitful and fair, content as Quakers,
Spanned in a Sunday morning's strolling
To the wood-dove's lament
Great Rome, high - hilled, all roads
reached to her;
Her conquering sons who served and
knew her
In pomp returned again;
The old house dozes in its hollow,
Fulfilled of gentle ghosts and graces
Come back to haunt remembered
places,
As comes the first returning swallow,
In sunshine and in rain.

end, long deferred, grew sadly ema-

MILLETT and Mr. FRED KERR were on
the stage, even if they only prattled
about the lateness of the dinner-hour,

Mr. GoDFREY TEARLE, back in his
element as Percy Robinson, promoter of
strikes and terror of the landed party,
played with a restraint which went far
to mitigate the obviousness of things.
Mr. MATURIN, in the rare figure of a
young ducal nut, was pleasantly fatuous.
In the midst of menaces of a universal
railway strike and the defeat of his
party at a local election, like a true
golfer he remained unmoved, except
by the fear that his game might be
affected. The ruling passion was strong
even in sleep. Waking from a slight
snooze taken before dinner, he broke it
to us that he had had a nightmare.
“I dreamt,” said he, “that Robinson
had altered the rules of golf'." In this
connection I must warn Mr. MATURIN
that the next time he plays a golfer he
must try to keep his head from wagging
so much, if he doesn't want to be
suspected of a handicap of twenty-four.

to blame for whatever atmosphere of

with.
The talk, though trivial enough at
times, was never dull, but there was
need of relief in the matter of the
excellent scene—always the Morning |
Room at Lord Chislehurst's. The
Duke, who was apparently living in the
family, seemed to be bored by it too;
and you can easily understand how
inconvenient and embarrassing it was
for the demagogue to have no accommo-
dation for his courtship except the
house of his natural enemy. The
title, The Cap and Bells, had nothing
whatever to do with the piece. It was
just the sign of a neighbouring inn
where the demagogue put up; and he
took life far too seriously to be credited
with a penchant for the society of
professional jesters. But a hostelry
with a name like that might well be the
resort of the author, Mr. VANSITTART,
for he has a very pleasant wit, and I
look forward to making its better
acquaintance before long. O. S.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The Arnold Lip (MURRAY) is a story about a family.
Nowadays the family has become the favourite butt of the
satirist; its head especially has had inexpensive fun poked at
him by a score of modern novel-writers. Mr. C. E. LAwRENCE
does not do this; though one feels that he would rather
like to, if it were not for his sense of fair play. This same
sense has, I think, been the undoing of the book as an
entertainment. You cannot write impartially and honestly
about dulness without some danger of being infected by it,
and the Arnolds, from father downwards, were a dull crew.
The bright spot of the family, and Mr. LAwRENCE's pet,
was Hugh, who left the too-comfortable paternal nest in
order to seek life and adventures of his own in reading for
the Bar. The chief adventure that befell him was the
adoption of the infant of his laundress's unmarried daughter.
Not unnaturally this worried the family a good deal. The
“Arnold lip,” one may say, curled significantly. All this
time old Anthony (Arnold père, called “Sir Anthony” from
his pomposity) was living the respected life of a prosperous
stockbroker—with a new revolver in the drawer of his
writing-table. The moment I heard about that revolver
I scented financial disaster ahead. Also one of the chapters
is called “Crash.” So now you know. It is a moving and
strangely-written chapter, but just what happens in it is
not mine to say. Mine only is it to praise the sincerity and
restraint of the story; though I admit that it seems some-
times a little overburdened by these good qualities.
... The longer one lives in London the less one knows about
it, and many of us would be wholly ignorant on the subject
but for the tit-bits of information that we pick up from
time to time from our country visitors. I am surprised and
delighted to find that the man who really does know all
about it has lived there for twenty-five years at least. His
name is Mr. WILFRED WHITTEN, and his book, A Londoner's
London (METHUEN), is the perfect combination of instruction
and amusement—instruction, because in three hundred odd
pages he makes the reader master of London's geography
and history; amusement, because he has an anecdote to
tell connected with every street, road, square, gardens,
terrace, place, lane, walk, circus, park, gate, green, rye, bec,
town, hill, vale, wood, grove, avenue and bush in it. As
may be gathered, the reminiscent details are many and all
must prove useful to the practical reader. Thus, when in
future he walks with his godson in Islington, he may tell
him that Dalby Terrace was so called to perpetuate the
memory of the inventor of the public-house beer-engine, or
when, as he strolls down Bond Street with his smart niece,
he is asked, “Why Bond Street, uncle?” he may satisfy
her curiosity and humble her pride by telling her that it is
named after its founder, Sir THOMAs Bond, who lived at
Peckham. Later in the day he may, over the wine and
nuts, regale his delighted guests with stories about every
statesman, general, author or pickpocket that ever frequented
town. My only complaint against Mr. WHITTEN is that he
is too much laudator temporis acti; if London had been
diligently conserved after the manner he desires, it would by
now be a moribund antique instead of a living entity.
(For myself I can see good even in the Red General
Juggernaut.) But I must conclude with a word of praise
for the fact that he never once refers to his subject as
the “metropolis,” which shows in what a right spirit he
approaches it.

aloofness from fact.
One of Mr. Punch's contemporaries publishes each week
photographs of men and women who have accomplished
remarkable feats, under the heading, “People to whom we
take off our hat.” I would strongly advocate the immediate
inclusion in this series of Mr. J. Huntſ, Y McCARTHY “for
having written a novel of 340 pages, and not a dull one
among them, with only four characters in it.” The entire
action of Calling the Tune (HURST AND BLACKETT) is sus-
tained by Wickliff Hersham, Gregory Winbush, his daughter
Gondoline and the young gentleman who called himself
Charles Trevor. Charles was “a fine specimen of a sturdy,
well-set-up, healthy, vigorous young Englishman, moulded
on the pattern that has helped to make our island what it
is.” Why, then, in a moment of sudden emotion, did he,
who stated proudly that “English was good enough for
him, all round the clock and every time,” exclaim, “Gott in
Himmel !” 2 Yes, you are right. Charles was really a
German spy, and he frequented Mr. Winbush's house for
drawn. Mrs. Fremant, the woman who sacrifices every-
thing to her unpractical husband; Sara, her daughter,
the central figure of the love theme; and Starkey, the
dwarf chemist, whose devotion to these two twice brings
him within measurable distance of wilful murder—all
are individuals. Perhaps more than any, though, I
liked her whom one might call the villain, poor Mrs.
Bultele, fighting for her churlish son against long odds
of sympathy. These are but four out of a crowd whose
lºguinºnº you will find worth making. Miss SIMPsoN
has, in short, written a tale distinctly above the average,
which would have been even better with more care. This,
for example, might have prevented her from marrying off
an elderly governess to a suitor who was a house-master at
Rugby and “means to have a school of his own now,” a
statement that displays some unfamiliarity with the niceties
of scholastic precedence.

His ears and sense of touch enjoy facilities
Of an unusual kind.

sort. - " * -
It has always been a dull affair at the best, and this

much talk of the need of brighter cricket, we were
particularly anxious to render the match more attractive.
But nobody had any ideas. -
However, we got our brighter cricket all right.
briefly, is what happened. :
All the buckles, we found, had been removed from the
club pads. - ; :
A quantity of plaster of Paris had been placed in the
wicket-keeper's gloves. As usual, he held his hands under
the tap before putting on the gloves, and the latter had
subsequently to be removed with the aid of a chisel.
The new ball exploded with terrific force the first time
it struck the ground.
The bowling screens collapsed simultaneously, revealing
a number of scurrying females and two large flags inscribed
“Votes for Women '''
And then we had to abandon the game and rush to
extinguish the fire in the pavilion.
This,
HOW TO STIMULATE PLAY-GOING.
SIR,--To my mind the solution of this problem will be
found in the movement towards the fusion of audience and
actors so well begun by Professor REINHARDT, and continued
by the managements of our popular Revues. Instead, how-
ever, of confining the artistes to a few isolated processions
through the stalls, let them be encouraged to mingle freely
with the spectators. The knowledge that certain seats
in—say—the Dress Circle would carry with them the
privilege of a heart-to-heart talk with the heroine over the
problems of the play, should do much to stimulate bookings.
Moreover, let the system already followed at the Duke of
York's during Peter Pan time be carried to its logical con-
clusion—bring every part of the theatre into the picture.
Thus, during a cowboy or highwayman drama, attendants,
properly attired, might demand sixpences for programmes
at the point of the pistol. At the bars fire-water might be
sold under similar conditions. After all, the change would
not be very great, and the effect would be enormous.
Yours, etc., ALL THE WoRLD A STAGE.
SIR,-Look at the matter from a practical and common-
sense point of view. Why do the public flock year after
year to our great Summer exhibitions? To contemplate
pyramids of somebody's soap, or to investigate the mysteries
of native crafts? No, Sir; what draw the real crowds are
such attractions as the Razzle-Dazzle or the Bumpety-Bang.
In 6ther words, the certainty of personal discomfort and
the probability of actual damage." Let us then apply this
principle to theatre-goings. Some of our present establish-
ments, it is true, go a certain way in this respect; but more
could be done. For example, let some mechanical arrange-
ment be fitted to the seats, so that (in addition to flying
up, as now, and letting down the unwary occupant who has
risen to let others pass—an excellent idea of its kind) they
may at uncertain intervals fling the spectators into the air or
otherwise maltreat them. 'Sow the auditorium with barbed )
wire and electric shocks; conceal tacks in the cushions, and ;
install water-sprinklers in the most unexpected places. You
will find that, so treated, the most unlucky theatre will pay
handsome dividends. . Yours, etc., MARTYR.
P.S.—I see I have not suggested that the refreshment †
served at the bars might be worse and more expensive. It !,
is useless to hope for this.
SIR,-What is wanted in theatres is more for the money. º
Let the prices remain the same, but the performance com-
mence at six instead of eight, and last till midnight. Thus,
with shorter intervals, room would be found for the inclusion
of certainly two, and perhaps three, long plays and a front- |
piece. We hear a great deal of the number of master-works
that never see the footlights; my suggestion would give
everybody a chance. Yours hopefully, AUTHoR of SixTY.
SIR,-Nothing puts me into a worse temper than to see
people smoking, eating, or (especially) drinking on the stage,
when I in the audience want to and can't. I am convinced ;
that the failure of many modern plays is due to the jealousy
and irritation caused § this. Fortunately the remedy is ;
simple. Make the spectators in the truest sense participants;
let no meal, drink, or cigarette be consumed upon the stage
without similar refreshment being simultaneously offered
to the house. Indifference will then be a thing of the
past. Yours, A PRACTICAL MAN. ;
SIR,-To make play-going agreeable the extract from the
LoRD CHAMBERLAIN's Regulations should be altered to “the
Safety-curtain will be lowered once at the commencement
of the performance, and remain down to the end.”
Yours, etc., CYNICUs.

MEMOIR OF A CELEBRATED JOKE.
I was a youngster of eighteen or twenty-two
When, I remember, the Joke had its birth;
Now there are other jokes, good ones and plenty too,
Raising their merited tribute of mirth;
But this particular Joke, by the merriment
Which it evoked during week after week,
Proved itself more than a jesting experiment—
It was unique.
Those were the days when the heavy tragedian
Drew the big pay and the popular cheer;
Nothing was thought of the merry comedian–
He was considered the smallest of beer.
Then came the Joke; the comedian's salary
Rose at a bound with his palpable hit;
Night after night he drew shrieks from the gallery,
Roars from the pit.
Well it is known that, as fast as the ferry can
Cross the Atlantic, our national japes
Forthwith are seized by the ruthless American
Journals and published in different shapes.
So with the Joke; sheer insanity was it or
Midsummer madness that folk were beguiled?
Anyhow, even the weary compositor
Wearily smiled.
Europe was merged in a flood of hilarity;
Paris became something gayer than gay;
Spaniards approved It and out of their charity
Told It to Moors who live over the way;
Russia and Turkey enjoyed It; like phosphorus
Flaming in brilliance and frothy as yeast,
It was transported right over the Bosphorus
Into the East.
Onward it sped to the isles of the Andaman
(Spirits and health of the convicts improved),
On to Japan, too, where even so grand a man
As the Mikado was visibly moved;
Passed through the deserts of desolate Tartary,
Welcome it found in Canton and Amoy,
Lightened the business of traffic and bartery—
Made it a joy. -
So the whole world was convulsed—till a bigger or
Mirthfuller pleasantry rose in its place.
Now, when I tell the Joke, never a snigger or
Chuckle engages the listener's face;
But in a style that is highly censorial
Someone says, “Chestnut !” and few will agree
That It deserved even this for memorial,
Written by me.
So the young jokes in their present prosperity
Must not suppose that their glory will last;
It is their doom to be mocked by posterity,
Flung to the Limbo of jokes of the past;
Yet to have lived for a season so sportively,
Though at the end you may cumber the earth,
Better this fate than to perish abortively,
Strangled at birth.

THE WERSATILITY CHAMPION.
ALTHough August is still far distant
The Daily Graphic, taking time by the
fetlock, has put forth one of those
engaging feelers which usually do not
obtrude until the silly season is born.
Who, it asks its many readers, is the
most versatile man?
The following letter, expressing very
reasonably and, we think, convincingly,
the claims of Mr. C. K. ShortER, the
well-known littérateur and Editor of
The Sphere, seems to have come to our
office by mistake; but it is so readable
and to the point that we make no
apology for having appropriated it:—
LITERATURE AND ATHLETICS.
SIR,-Allow me to tell you once for
all who is the most versatile man living.
It is Mr. SHORTER, as
to draw attention to his remarkable
influence on both BEETHoveN and
ALFRED MYNN and his amazing asso-
ciation with GEORGE STEPHENSON, re-
sulting in the construction of the first
locomotive.
Meanwhile Mr. SHORTER always
found time for literary friends, and
SHELLEY, BYRON and WoRDsworth
could never see enough of him. With
NELson he sailed several times, and
it was by his advice that the great
admiral, on becoming a peer, added
BRONTÉ to his title. NAPOLEoN he also
knew, but somehow—the fault either
of NAPOLEoN or Mr. SHORTER, no one
ever quite knew which—they did not
get on very well.

him), and Mr. MAx PEMBERTON, J.P.,
—known, and very properly, as “The
Revue King.”
All is fish that comes to Mr.
SHORTER's net. He found it as easy
to be witty with WHISTLER as senten-
tious with TUPPER ; and on his week-
end walks through Wales with GEoRGE
Borrow he kept up his end with spirit,
and few were the tinmen he did not
fight or the gipsy girls he did not
chivalrously befriend.
Having for many years taken all
knowledge for his province Mr. ShoBTER
naturally has not had so much time for
versatility as in the earlier phases of
Mr. SHORTER, how- his remarkable and stimulating career,
ever, bore no malice, and when, much but he still drives off the tee with an
later in life, after a delightful first visit accuracy and power equalled only in a
dream of John BALL; still
I will proceed to demon-
strate.

Passing to France for

of call for all scholars of what-
ever grade. At the outbreak of
the Revolution Mr. Short ER left for
Weimar, where he acquired that know-
ledge of the German tongue which has
made him justly famous; and was
instrumental in adding many fine
passages to the works of GoFTHE, who
often expressed the opinion, to EcKER-
MANN and others, that but for CLEM
(as he called his English friend) he
would not be where he was.
During this time Mr. ShortER's
other activities were immense, for he
has never believed in brain work alone.
“Mens sana in corpore sano,” he fre-
quently quotes, and it is not a mere
idle phrase either. As an oarsman, a
fives player, a fencer and a duellist with
pisto's he was held in the highest
esteem. Yet it is hardly necessary to
mention his Newdigate and his Nobel
prizes, both of which he took when still
in his teens; more to the point is it,
since we are on the topic of versatility,
to Spain in 1913—for he has always
been an indefatigable and daring tra-
veller—he spent a few hours in St.
Helena, he was heard to remark,
thoughtfully, on regaining his vessel
(the one, by the way, with which he
won the America Cup), “A great little
man A great little man "
Nor did he allow his comparative
failure with NAPOLEoN to prejudice him
in any way against the French. On the
contrary, he maintained relations of the
greatest cordiality with DUMAs, HUGo,
GEORGE SAND, LAMARTINE and MAR-
GUERITE ANDoux; and this, be it re-
membered, often at times when England
and France were anything but friendly.
CERVANTES, of course, he never met,
but nothing but the iron hand of time
could have kept them apart. In Eng-
land, such has been the catholicity of
Mr. ShoBTER's sympathies that he has
been intimate with such different men
of genius as Lord MACAULAY, the fasti-

MUSINGS FROM MORECAMBE.
WE have received a letter from a
correspondent who has had the good
fortune to attend the Competitive
Musical Festival at Morecambe. He
is full of admiration of the prodigies of
musical valour achieved by infants,
boys, girls and adults, whether individ-
ually or collectively, for the patience of
adjudicators, and the splendid results
of a movement which will always be
associated with the name of the late
MARY WAKEFIELD. Yet he cannot resist
the temptation of indulging in a little
criticism in the form of suggestions for
a series of supplementary prizes on the
following lines:—
Prize I.-For the adjudicator who
gives his award with the minimum of
superfluous comment and irrelevant
facetiousness.
Prize II.-For the composer of a
new madrigal or part song which is
not suggestive of an equal admixture of
treacle and olives.
Prize III.-For the referee in the
tenor solo competition who listens to
more than fifteen competitors with the
least loss of equanimity.
Prize IV.-For the conductor who
thinks more of poetry than pitch.
Prize W.-For any song-writer who
will set to appropiate music a lyric
more futile than the following:—

GETTING MARRIED.
III.--THE Honey Moon.
“I KNow I oughtn't to be dallying
here,” I said; “I ought to be doing
something strenuous in preparation for
the wedding. Counting the bells at
St. Miriam's, or varnishing the floors
in the flat, or Tell me what I
ought to be doing, Celia, and I'll go on
not doing it for a bit.”
“There's the honeymoon,”
Celia.
“I knew there was something.”
“Seriously, Ronald, what are you
doing about it?” -
“Thinking about it.” :
“You haven't written to anyone
about rooms yet?”
“Celia,” I said reproachfully, “you
seem to have forgotten why I am
marrying you.” . . . . . :
When Celia was browbeaten into her
present engagement, she said frankly
that she was only consenting to marry
me because of my pianola, which she
had always coveted. In return "I
pointed out that I was only asking her
to marry me because I wanted some-
body to write my letters. There opened
before me, in that glad moment, a vista
6f invitations and accounts-rendered all
answered promptly by Celia, instead
of put off till next month by me. It
was a wonderful vision to one who (very
properly) detests letter-writing. And
yet, here she was, even before the
ceremony, expecting me to enter into
a deliberate correspondence with all
sorts of strange people who as yet had
not come into my life at all. It was
too much. º - -
“We will get,” I said, “your father
to write some letters for us.”
“But what's he got to do with it?”
“I don't want to complain of your
father; Celia, but it seems to me that
he is not doing his fair share. There
ought to be a certain give-and-take in
the matter. I find you a nice church
to be married in-good. He finds
you a nice place to honeymoon in-
excellent. After all, you are still his
daughter.” - -
“All right,” said Celia, “I’ll ask
Father to do it. ‘Dear Mrs. Bunn, my
little boy wants to spend his holidays
with you in June. I am writing to ask
you if you will take care of him and see
that he doesn't do anything dangerous.
He has a nice disposition, but wants
watching.’ Something like that.”
I got up and went to the writing-
desk.
“’ſ can see I shall have to do it
myself,” I sighed. “Give me the
address and I'll begin.”
“But we haven't quite settled where
we're going yet, have we?”
said
I put the pen down thankfully and
went back to the sofa.
“Good | Then I needn't write to-
day, anyhow. It is wonderful, Celia,
how difficulties roll away when you
face them. Almost at once we arrive
at the conclusion that I needn't write
to-day. Splendid! Well, where shall
we go? This will want a lot of
thought. Perhaps,” I added, “I needn't
write to-morrow.” .
“We had almost fixed on England,
hadn't we ?” , -
“Somebody was telling me that
Lynton was very beautiful. I should
like to go to Lynton.”
“But everyone goes to Lynton for
their honeymoon.” -
“Then let's be original and go to
Birmingham. “The happy couple left
for Birmingham, where the honeymoon
will be spent.’ Sensation.”
- “‘The bride left the train at Ealing.' .
| -
More sensation.” -
“I think the great thing,” I said,
trying to be businesslike, “is to fix the
county first. If we fixed on Rutland,
then the rest would probably be easy.”
“The great thing,” said Celia, “is to
decide what we want. Sea, or river,
or mountains, or—or golf.”
At the word golf I coughed and
looked out of the window.
Now I am very fond of Celia—I
mean of golf, and—what I really mean,
of course, is that I am very fond of
both of them. But I do think that on
a honeymoon Celia should come first.
After all, I shall have plenty of other
holidays for golf . . . although, of
course, three weeks in the summer
without any golf at all Still, I
think Celia should come first. -
“Our trouble,” I said to her, “is
that neither of us has ever been on
a honeymoon before, and so we've no
idea what it will be like. After all,
why should we get bored with each
other? Surely we don't depend on
golf to amuse us.” i
“All the same, I think your golf
would amuse me,” said Celia. “Besides,
I want you to be as happy as you
possibly can be.”
“Yes, but supposing I was slicing
my drives all the time, I should be
miserable. I should be torn between
the desire to go back to London and
have a lesson with the professional and . . .
the desire to stay on honeymooning
with you. One can't be happy in a
quandary like that.”
“Very well then, no golf. Settled?”
“Quite. Now then, let 's decide
about the scenery. What sort of soil
do you prefer?”
When I left Celia that day we had
agreed on this much : that we wouldn't
bother about golf, and that the
mountains, rivers, valleys, and so on,
should be left entirely to nature. All
we were to enquire for was (in the
words of an advertisement Celia had
seen) “a perfect spot for a honeymoon.”
In the course of the next day I heard
of seven spots; varying from a spot in
Surrey “dotted with firs,” to a dot in
the Pacific spotted with—I forget
what, natives probably. Taken together
they were the seven only possible
spots for a honeymoon.
“We shall have to have seven honey-
moons,” I said to Celia when I had
told her my news. “One honeymoon,
one spot.” -
“Wait,” she said. “I have heard of
an ideal spot.” -
“Speaking as a spot expert, I don't
think that's necessarily better than an
only possible spot,” I objected. “Still,
tell me about it.” -
“Well, to begin with, it's close to the
sea.” -
“So we can bathe when we're bored.
Good.” - - -
“And it's got a river, if you want to
fish—” ‘
“I don't. I should hate to catch a
fish who was perhaps on his honey-
moon too. Still, I like the idea of a
river.” . . . .
“And quite a good mountain, and
lovely walks, and, in fact, everything.
Except a picture-palace, luckily.”
“It sounds all right,” I said doubt-
fully. “We might just spend the next
day or two thinking about my seven
spots, and then I might . . . possibly
. . . feel strong enough to write.”
“Oh, I nearly forgot. I have written,
Ronald.” - . .
“You have?” I cried. “Then, my
dear Celia, what else matters ? It's a
perfect spot.” I lay back in relief.
“And there, thank 'evings, is another
thing settled.”
“Yes. And, by the way, there is golf
quite close too. But that,” she smiled,
“needn't prevent us going there.”
“Of course not. We shall just
ignore the course.” -
“Perhaps, so as to be on the safe
side, you'd better leave your clubs
behind.” -
“Perhaps I’d better,”Isaid carelessly.
All the same I don't think, I will.
One never knows what may happen
and at the outset of one's matri-
monial career to have to go to the
expense of an entirely new set of clubs
would be a most regrettable business.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, April
28.-After long series of exciting inter-
ludes Man in Street began to forget
existence of Marconi Committee. Re-
garded it as played out. This afternoon
burst forth in quick flame of wrath
exceeding all that had gone before.
Witness in chair, in that vague casual
manner with which, in fashion un-
familiar to English public life, charges
calculated to ruin promising careers
have been levied against Cabinet
Ministers, hinted that there was a
third whose name had been “men-
tioned in the City.” Suspicion aroused
that he had used his official position
to obtain information respecting pros-
pects of Marconi enterprise, and had
secretly speculated upon it. Of course,
witness did not believe there was any
truth in this rumour, any more than
had predecessors in the chair who
dealt with the names of the CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER and the ATToRNEY-
GENERAL. Could not even name his
authority. But there you were. Just
mentioned it by the way, as who
should say, “A fine day,” or (under
other circumstances), “How very wet.”
Would rather not name the Minister
implicated; but if Committee insisted?
Well, it was the FIRST Lord of THE
ADMIRALTY.
WINSTON sent for, and he came.
Burst into chamber like a tornado. In
swift succession of wholesome if stormy
gusts destroyed the frail fabric of
“flimsy gossip, unsupported tittle-
tattle,” as he scornfully described it.
Having, in measured terms whose
precision and circumstantiality brought
into stronger light the fumbling charge
levelled against his honour, denied
that at any time, in any circumstances,
directly or indirectly, he had had
any interest in Marconi shares, he
added: “If anybody, at any time, has
said I have, that person is a liar and
a slanderer. If anybody has repeated
this statement and said he has no
evidence and he believes it to be false,
but that there it is, the only difference
between that person and a liar and a
slanderer is that he is a coward in
addition.”
The MEMBER For SARK delighted.
“It was,” he remarked, “time this
was said. No one could have said it
better. LLoyd GEORGE and RUFUs
ISAACs, properly anxious to dispel
lingering doubt as to falseness of
charges not made but insinuated, were
a little too meek in their demeanour,
a trifle too concerned to make full dis-
closure of their private affairs in
satisfaction of malignant curiosity.
WINSTON, in fashion that would have
delighted his father, took the anony-
mous slanderers by the throat and
shook the breath out of their bodies.
Pity he didn't turn up three months
ago. He would have made swift end
of the sorry business, as he has done
to-day.”
SARK, who is rather proud of his
recollection of episodes in English
History reluctantly acquired in school-
days, finds in the incident with the
story of which House and Lobby are
ringing the most dramatic scene in
Parliamentary record since CROMWELL
WINSTON STRANGLES A CANARD.
With acknowledgments to Mr. ALBERT
Hodge, sculptor of “A Mighty Hunter”
(No. 1821) at the Royal Academy.
dropped in at Westminster, spoke dis-
respectfully of the Mace, and dissolved
House of Commons.
“Longo intervallo, of course,” he
admits. “Still you get the sudden
impulse, the swift movement and the
paralysing effect.”
Business done.—Marconi Committee
begin to think it has had enough of it.
On Wednesday motion will be made
that it “doth forthwith proceed to
consider its Report.”
House of Lords, Tuesday.—Noble
Lords coming back to work after yester-
day's exhausting sitting of five minutes
rewarded by hearing instructive paper
read by MonTAGU of BEAULIEU on
subject of Military and Naval Aviation.
Successor to new peerage in ancient line
heremains “John Scott" to a wide circle
of admiring friends. Aviation's artful
aid a comparatively new attraction for ||
him. Outside matters of high State
policy he made his mark as one of the
earliest advocates of motoring. 'Twas
he who gave the late KING Edward his
first ride in the conquering car. When
he took to the new means of road
conveyance it was regarded as a reck-
less temptation of Providence. Wives
viewed with mixed feelings the depar-
ture of their husbands on an excursion.
They were united in apprehension that
they might never see them any more—
at least not bodily intact.
John Scott was the first man who
drove into Palace Yard in a motor car.
It is striking evidence of the frame
of mºnd with which the novelty was
regarded at that not far distant time
that when he made a second attempt
he was stopped at the gate by the
police. To-day four-wheelers and han-
soms have hopelessly driven off and
the Yard resounds with stentorian sum-
mons of “Tax-ee” by police on duty.
Sighing for new worlds to conquer,
John Scott, with the enthusiasm of
perpetual youth, now gone in for
aviation. This afternoon moved for
elaborate return showing the number
of dirigibles, aeroplanes, hydro-aero-
planes, possessed by the chief countries
of the world, including Great Britain,
as usual in these matters, so patriots
put it, lagging in the rear.
As BEAUCHAMP, replying for Govern-
ment, meekly said, Why should the
Department prepare returns? The
noble lord had himself supplied one
whose fulness could hardly be exceeded.
He would certainly refer the matter to
the War Office and would ask them
whether they were able to enlarge on
information supplied by questioner.
Seemed to think this not probable.
What John Scott doesn't know about
aeroplanes is not worth teaching in an
elementary school.
Business done.—In Commons, third
debate on “the People's Budget.” Much
talk but little fight. Resolutions im-
posing Tea Duties and Income-tax
agreed to without division.
House of Commons, Friday.—When
newly-elected Member for Shrews-
bury arrived to take the oath there
was forthcoming striking evidence of
the strained condition of Members
supervening on exceptionally prolonged
attendance at Westminster. Safely
delivered at Table (with some difficulty
to his escort by reason of his persistence
in halting at the wrong spot to repeat
obeisance to the Chair) the Clerk as
usual handed him copy of the Bible
and form of oath. Instructed to hold
the former in his right hand he uplifted
it at arm's length above his shoulder
as if about to discharge cricket ball with

high delivery against the opposing
defence, or thereabouts.
This early impression swiftly gave
place to another more disturbing. As a
student of modern Parliamentary man-
ner, was BUTLER LLoyd about to dis-
tinguish himself on the very threshold
of his Parliamentary career by chucking
the book at the head of the CHANCELLOR
of THE Exchequer seated on the
Treasury Bench with folded arms, un-
conscious of peril? -
RoNALD McNEILL the first to recog-
nise contingency. His natural personal
interest in the procedure attracted
general attention. Scene at Table

with air of listening intently to
recital of the oath, keeping one
eye fixed on the uplifted right
women waste so much time—in thrash-
ing out the irrelevant at the expense of
the essential. Now had we been two
females we should have committed a
fundamental error in the preliminary
division of labour. We should have
allotted one to the other certain definite
and distinct departments. You, for
example, might have undertaken the
replenishment of the larder, while I was
responsible for the mathematical and
literary labours attendant upon the
week's washing. What would have
been the result 2 We should each have
felt that we could do the other's work
better than our own, and it would have
our respective duties, and yet, should
the old lady take a fancy to one sock,
or desire a linen collar as a memento
of our patronage, you cannot blame me
and I have no word to say against you.
That is where the male mind scores so
over its female counterpart. It is the
triumph of method over unreasoning
routine.” -
“It's organisation in the little things
that is the secret of our success.”
“Exactly—or ratherin the apparently
little things. Now a woman doesn’t
realise that the tiniest nut in an

the noise which the machine emits

THE TRIUMPH OF METHOD.
“I THINK, Peter,” I remarked,
“that we may congratulate ourselves
upon the way in which things have
turned out. It is true that at first we
both made sundry little mistakes in
household matters, but for the last six
months we have reduced our manage-
ment to a fine art.”
“And therein lies our success,” he
replied. “Housekeeping is a fine art.
It is usually, and quite erroneously,
considered to be a form of unskilled
labour. It is also generally supposed
to be one of those matters which lie
entirely in the province of the other
sex. Like most things which women
do well, it can be still better done by
men when they set themselves seriously
to the task. The male mind is able to
grasp the broad general outlines of a
division of labour without the necessity
of eternal discussion over the trivialities
of respective tasks. That is where

proudly, “my male mind at

THE river ran unheeding; .
The cuckoo made his mock;
The big trout wasn't feeding;
I drowsed beside the lock;
It might have been the weather,
It might have been the stream,
Or p'raps the two together .
That made me dream a dream.
I dreamt a dream of Maytime,
Of hawthorns white as snow,
The village green at playtime
A hundred years ago;
A dream of bow and fiddle
And dancing on the green,
A maypole in the middle,
The finest ever seen.
The maids were red as roses
That took each ribbon rope;
The lads who held their posies
They shone with health and soap;
Dach lass had got her lover,
Save one I did espy
As plump as any plover,
As sweet as cherry pie.
I slipped an arm around her;
The fiddles called to me;
As light of foot I found her
As e'er a lass could be ;
We danced it, and the same was
Most wonderful to tread;
I asked her what her name was,
And, “Hephzibah,” she said.
The fiddlers were in fettle;
Too soon the dance was done;
I sat her on a settle,
All dimpling in the sun;
I found for her a fairing,
This pretty maid of mine,
A kerchief for her wearing,
And cake and cowslip wine.
I said, “My dear, I love you
Most tender and most true;
You little, pretty dove, you,
Oh, won't you love me too?”
White lids the blue eyes' beaming
Swift shadowed as I spoke;
'Twas then—so much for dreaming—
'Twas then that I awoke.
The cuckoos still were calling;
In amber, jade and pearls
The splashing weir was falling,
To spin in silver swirls
As gaily as a dancer;

I never had your answer,

THE RETURN.
HAving a moral duty and a delicate
task to perform, I marched up the
marble staircase and through the big
glass doors. “I have come,” said I,
“to have a chat with somebody.”
The man behind the counter (it was
a big counter and there were many men
behind it, but only one of them took
any real fancy to me)—the man behind
the counter (though perhaps that de-
scription does inadequate justice to a
very superior clerk in a very superior
insurance company's very superior head
office)—the man behind the counter, if I
might perhaps just be allowed to finish
this sentence, as good as told me to
chat on.
“It is about some trousers,” I began.
“Trousers ?" said he, raising his
eyebrows, but dropping them again
almost immediately.
“Yes," said I, “a pair of them.
Twins, I might say, and so alike that
| you could not tell tº other from which.
But then you did not often get the
chance, for they were inseparable and
always went about together. . As often
as not I went with them, but there
came a day when they made up their
minds to go out into the world
alone.” -
I gave him his opportunity, but he
had nothing to say. So I continued:
| “How well I remember that Friday
| evening when we parted company It
| had been a heavy day in the City, and
| I was due to be in the country for the
| week-end. I left them to rest and
| recuperate in my flat. When I returned
| on the Monday they were gone. The
| affair did not attract much attention at
| the time; the British public was either
ignorant or apathetic. We ourselves
thought little enough of it until it
suddenly occurred to me that they were
heavily insured.”
At that word the man showed his
first signs of beginning to sit up and
take notice. Up till then he had been
very busy adding up figures in a ledger
while I talked.
“It was when I recollected,” I said,
“that I was paying you twenty-five
shillings a year to cover fire and
burglary risks that the suspicion of
foul play first crossed my mind. The
more I thought of the matter the more
sure did I become that they had been
made away with. Knowing you would
be interested, I wrote and told you all
You answered that my com-
munication was to hand and was re-
ceiving attention, and had I any clues?
I replied that I hadn't, and if I had
they were poor substitutes for trousers.
And eventually you agreed to contribute
to the erection of a fac-simile of the
dear departed upon the very site they
used to occupy.”
The man leant right across the
counter and examined me thoroughly.
“To cut a long and painful story short,”
said he, “you have come to show us the
fac-similes. On behalf of my Company
I express our hearty appreciation. And
now, since to continue it would only
be to harrow your feelings, we might
perhaps consider the interview at an
end.”
I trust that at the critical moment I
showed no signs of confusion. “No,”
I answered, “Er—no; these are not
the fac-similes. But if you are really
interested I will tell you what they are.
It is a longish history, but I have felt
that you are entitled to the whole of it,
if you insist.” * - - t
I paused. I continued pausing while
he added up another column of figures
and added it up again. It must have
come the same both times for he sud-
denly lost interest in it and returned
to Ine and the trousers. - *
“As you were saying
observed.
“I was remarking,” said I, “on the
transient nature nowadays of mysterious
disappearances, eloping vicars and so
forth. Subsequent investigation as
often as not reveals a state of circum-
stances very different from that deposed
to in the first impulsive statement of
the bereaved; the persons said to have
disappeared not only have not been
made away with but have not, in fact,
disappeared. It is much the same with
trousers.”
His attention, which had been
momentarily stimulated by my allusion
to eloping vicars, fell off again and he
started on yet another column, but,
stolid fellow though he was, whom no
passionate tale of tragedy could long
distract from his arithmetic, he be-
came interested when I produced thirty
shillings and put them thoughtfully on
the counter.
“What's this for 2 " he asked.
“Conscience money,” I said briefly;
but, seeing that he wanted some sort of
explanation to lay before his Board of
Directors, “it is like this,” I concluded.
“Some little time ago your Company
was kind enough to give me money to
buy myself the lower half of a new suit.
Circumstances have arisen in which I
think it is true etiquette for me on my
part to make a similar present to your
Company."
Naturally enough he asked for the
name of the generous donor.
“On the whole,” I said with a mag-
nanimous air, “I would prefer to remain
amon.”
Thereupon I, and the trousers,

THE OPTIMIST.
BILLY is very brave. He knows not
the meaning of the word fear, especially
if it takes the form of timeo, and as for
the word pogéo, I don't believe he can
do a thing with it. To his invincible
courage Billy adds an unquenchable
optimism. He is fond of telling people
that he really enjoys cold baths; that
very frosty weather invigorates him, and
very hot weather fills him with health;
and that the world, contrary to the over-
whelming verdict of popular opinion, is
not actually going to the dogs. But
Billy has his weak spot. A dentist
scares him to death.
The moment I saw Billy last Monday
I realized that something was wrong.
His face was grim—tragic. It looked
as if he had been face to face with one of
the great facts of life—love or death or
poverty or indigestion. I stopped and
spoke to him sympathetically.
“Billy,” I said, “was it a filling?”
“I suppose it may have been,” said
Billy. He seemed glad to see me, but
he spoke very calmly, as men speak
after an accident in which there has
been great loss of life. “They tipped
me horizontal in the chair,” he said
gravely; “they strapped me to one of
my own teeth; they probed me to find
which part hurt most; after they had
found it, they tore a great jagged hole
there with the electric torturer, and
filled it with a cartload of putty; and
then they said, ‘That's all we have
time for to-day. Come in for a wedge
to-morrow and we'll take it out the day
after and meddle with the putty the
day after that. Then next Saturday
afternoon, if it's nice sunny weather,
we may have a chance to get round to
this great big painful fellow that's
dying by inches up in the back of your
head.’”
Billy mused. “To-morrow, and to-
morrow, and to-morrow,” he quoted
bitterly. -
“Come, come, Billy,” I said. “Pull
yourself together. You are an optimist.
Try to see the bright side of the
thing.”
“I suppose there is one,” said Billy
meditatively. And at last I saw the
old gleam of cheerfulness in his eye.
“I have it,” he clied. “Perhaps the
thing has its use after all. In these
days of disarmament and universal
peace, our young men will become pink
and mild and flabby unless we offer a
substitute for war. The substitute is
ready: for the heroism of the battle-
field the heroism of the dentist-chair.
There's romance for you!”
Somehow I wasn't convinced. “It
won't go,” I insisted. “Romance is
dead. Chivalry is dead. I fail to see the

glamour of dentistry. Your optimism is
misplaced.”
But Billy stood enraptured with his
own idea. The smiles broke out all
over his face like a rash. “Think of
it,” he cried, “the war of the next
century—the call to the front—the
young men going out one by one from
the comfortable waiting-room, with its
piled magazines and pleasant news-
papers, to—they know not what 1

“IT's a funny thing,” said the girl who helped in the
Flat, “’ow you seem to be goin' along quite smooth one
minute, with everybody smilin' at you and thinkin' what
fine people you are—you know what I mean—and the next
minute suthin' 'appens and you're out in the middle of the
street chasin' after your umbrellor or your 'at and all the
motor-'buses a-top of you. That's the sort o' thing that
'appened to Mrs. Wortle when she took a lodger; not
through 'er meanin' of it, o' course, but sudden like, jest as
if she'd got into the wind and it took 'er orf of 'er legs, as
the sayin’ is. We shouldn't 'a' minded that so much, but it
ketched father and mother too before it 'ad done and give
'em a nawsty slap. - - -
“Mrs. Wortle lives next door to us: she's seen better
days. She often drops in on mother and tells 'er about the
great things she used to do—'Ampton Court Palis, or the
‘Spaniards' at 'Ampstead 'Eath, and sultana kikes and
'am sangwiches, no end of a set-out all the year round, if
you can believe what she says. Mother plays up to 'er and
sets 'er goin'. 'Mrs. Wortle, she says, “tell us the story,'
she says, ‘about Mr. Wortle ketchin' the perliceman a crack
o' the jor'; or, ‘Won't you oblige us with that bit about
Mr. Wortle and the bottle o' chempine when the cork
wouldn't come out?' and then the old girl winds 'erself up
and orf she goes so 's you can't stop 'er. She says it does
'er good to talk about the times when there was always
a ten-pun' note to spend and no questions asked.
“Well, she made up 'er mind to take a lodger, and a
fortnit ago come next Friday she got one. A Bo'emian 'e
was, a brown-lookin' man with no end o' black 'air on 'is
'ead, and a black mustarch and a lot o' white to 'is eyes.
'E worked for a cabinet-maker and played the guitar, but
'is name I can't rightly misremember. It was like sneezin'

so I give it up. O' course 'e couldn't talk English beyond
sayin' 'Ow de do, or God save the King, or cawſy and milk,
and that don't tike you far. Then 'e'd go off in 'is own
Bo'emian, and that sounded sorter silly to me, like cats
quarrellin'; but all furriners is like that. 'Ow they ever
get along at all is more 'n I can understand.
“This Bo’emian 'ad a monkey with him, a bit of a thing
no bigger'n a puppy-dcg, the funniest little atomy you ever
see, all chatter and mikin' fices, as you may say. It
snuggled in 'is coat and seemed as clever as a Christian.
It took Mrs. Wortle all of a nonplush when she set eyes on
it, and at fust she said she couldn't 'ave a monkey lodgin'
in 'er 'ouse. She was sure Mr. Wortle wouldn't 'a' liked it
if 'e could 'a' come from the grave—them was the words
she said. But when the Bo'emian set the little feller down
and 'e got to work pertendin' to ketch fleas in the mat
afore the fireplace, and then turned ’ead over eels all round
the room, she give in. She said it was enough to mike a
cat larf. -
“It was a Friday when the Bo'emian come in to

Mrs. Wortle told us she'd lost a phortygraft frame, brass

to put a picture of Mr. Wortle in it, but 'e got the dropsy

Conveyed by garden plots, wherein is raiséd
The surely crescent mint.

Wake no response within your ample chest;
You have your private and conclusive reason
For liking Winter best.
To-day, when winds blew chill, we walked the faster;
When we reached home again, a gentle cough
And sadly plaintive look accused me—“Master,
Our parlour fire is off.”
Yet, since your sense of etiquette is rigid,
You stayed awhile with me, crouched on the floor;
Long shiverings shook you; and then, semi-frigid,
You snuffled at the door.
I opened, and with anguish almost human
You left the hearth-rug home of your desire,
And toddled off to Cook, that thoughtful woman,
Who always has a fire.

As a reviewer I could wish that every book were as short
as The Open Window (CHAPMAN AND HALL), except The
Open Window itself. In whatever capacity I had read it, I
must have found too fleeting a pleasure in Mr. E. TEMPLE
THURSTON's note-book of a country parson, a diary senti-
mental in the best sense of that word. One may write of
flowers and birds with the utmost delicacy and grace, and
may touch upon the sorrow of a dying wife, and an only
daughter leaving for a far corner of the world, with a
melancholy the most quiet and restrained, and yet may
leave the reader suspicious of effeminacy and clamorous
for the virile and robust. Mr. THURSTON's humour and
humanity have kept him admirably clear of this fault. He
has avoided that maudlin hypersensitiveness epidemic in an
age of literature which is possibly too little sympathetic
with the small boy, whose catapult, on page 133, brought
down the bullfinch, and too much inclined to dote upon the
sweet lady who, at page 135, buried that bullfinch in her
garden and put up a little gravestone to remember it by.

doing it, that was his business and a matter he must
account for to others than officious passers-by.

is yet so pleasant and modest about it that the difference

are pretty and dainty, but lack definiteness and substance.
There is, however, one astonishing exception, the oddness
of which I attribute to some fault in the reproduction. It
is just intelligible that the gentleman who on the cover is
shown to be looking through the open window should be
in striped pyjamas, but there is no excuse for his having
the face of an unmistakable negro and amºhabitual criminal

produced in the dialogue; later you will note with interest
that the explanatory passages are also written in the same
style. I fancy that Mr. JoHN Fox, Jr. (by the way, why
Jr., and who is the other cne?) enjoys a reputation in
God's Own Country which has escaped me over here. I
hasten to add that if so it is thoroughly deserved. The
story of a vendetta among the mountain settlers is told in
a way that grips attention by many qualities. It is also an
extraordinary history for twentieth-century readers to hear
of their own times and a so-called civilized country. Because
the boy Jason's father, a Hawn, had apparently been shot
by one of the Honeycutts, it seems to have been indisputedly
Jason's mission in life to even the score. The final scene,
in which the two aged heads of the rival houses encounter
in a pass, and batter each other with enfeebled fists till the
loss of their spectacles and the arrival of the now reconciled
sons put an end to the fray, is one that lingers in the
memory for its grim humour. When the author came

that is the drawings of Mr. HAROLD CoPPING, whose
single illustration is alone well worth the price of the
book.
Several people, wanting dif-
ferent magic doors opened to
faith, to love, to fame, to wealth,
say “Open Sesame " in the
novel of that name by B. PAUL
NEUMAN (MURRAY); and for
some the miracle happens, for
others it simply doesn't, which
is the orthodox way of miracles.
The most interesting failure is
that of William Henry Porteous,
destined for the Church and
choosing to be a healer and to
run a church of his own. It is
a curious, a clever, and, so far
as one has data for judging, a
sound study of a flat, pompous
young man with some strange |
gift of personal magnetism but
no sincerity of conviction or
depth of character, who succeeds
in his first healing ventures,
but fails in his public test,
bringing down his reputation,
his health and “the Church of
the Gifts” in a common ruin.
I can't think, however, that it
is an artistic achievement to
give so much of this poor
victim's conversation when his
wits are gone. The task of
extracting pathos out of this
kind of horrible inconsequence
is surely too easy to be worth
doing. Perhaps it isn't quite
fair to assume that an author's
best portraits are photographic
studies from actual life, and so
to seem to deny the faculty of
creation, but Félicité Gaye, suc-
cessful milliner and wife of a
business man unsuccessful to
the point of dishonesty, is too
good to be untrue. Hard, cyni-
cal, brutally outspoken, she is
without faith and without hope,
except that she may wear her
mask to the end and face the
utterly feared adventure of death
without breaking down. Mr. NEUMAN has shown a very
signal skill in the delineation of these two portraits which
hang in a notable gallery with many others. But “hang” is
not quite the word. They walk, very much alive. It is the | thing very near the complete “prigoist.”
One thing I should have liked more of, and kind. They succeed fairly well in making me forget that
the letters are written in cold blood by themselves for the
eye of the public. Almost they persuade me to believe that

ITALY To AUSTRIA.
[The following remarks are ready for delivery to Austria in case she
reverts to her original intention of undertaking the noble task of
Albania's reconstruction.]
O DUAL one, whose love has often sent a
Thrill through our marrow, chewing memory's cud,
Mindful of days inscribed in pure Magenta,
The colour (loosely) of our confluent blood;
O bound by bonds of holiest alliance,
One of a triplet, Europe's mailed police,
Who at the trembling nations fling defiance
As deadly guardians of the gates of Peace;
Rumour arrives that you, O Austria-Hungary,
Stung by desire of sweetness and of light,
Propose to plunge your martial ironmongery
Into Albania's mess and put it right.
Your record as a Christian civilizer
Stamps you for that high quest supremely fit,
Yet we should love (by leave of WILLIAM KAIs ER)
To join you in the job and do our bit.
How cleverly we handle heathen races
Let Tripoli be witness; well she knows
That, if our voice but breathe o'er desert places,
Almost at once they blossom like the rose.
So where you go we too intend to follow,
Bringing to arid scenes the smile of May,
Playing, in fact, the rôle of second swallow,
Earnest that Spring has really come to stay.
And, should a very natural lust for booty
Nestle beneath your altruistic airs,
We'll gladly undertake detective duty
Or halve the scandal for you, going shares.
In fine, if someone—not a local bandit—
Is bound to do this sacrificial work,
With or without a European mandate,
And 'tis a task you feel you may not shirk;
We hardly like to let a sister nation
Tackle alone so perilous a “sphere";
So you may count on Rome's co-operation;
We shall be there all right. Good-bye, my dear.
- O. S.
THE GRATUITY.
I was, of course, in no way responsible for the waiters
at the Bullionberg. Yet, because Millicent and her mother
were dining with me, I experienced an uneasy feeling of
guilt at the shortcomings of our particular attendant.
Perhaps in his own land he was a strolling minstrel.
I cannot vouch for the musical part of him, but, with
the exception of a plumber, who once worked for me
within the speed limit of his union, I have never seen a
man take longer over doing nothing.
I tried kindness. I tried sarcasm. I tried firmness.
I tried persuasion, hauteur, wrathfulness. I tried every-
thing. The waiter, on the contrary, did not try anything.
He succeeded where I failed.
Millicent assured me that she in no way minded the
| interminable intervals so excellent (she said) for the
digestion. Millicent's mother perjured herself in turn by
remarking that, the variation in temperature between luke-
warm coffee and a tepid ice being small, they were less
detrimental to the teeth.
“Deeds spake ever louder than words,” I replied
gratefully. “Therefore, instead of apologising to you, I
will make up for this fiasco by inviting you to dine with
me at the Tiny wee in Soho.” -
“Agreed But I do so want to hear you tell the head-
waiter all the things you have been saying about him.”
“No. Deeds again. It is the custom of the Bullionberg
not to tip your own waiter but to slip a half-sovereign into
the hand of the chief-of-staff on leaving. This evening, as
a mark of my disapprobation, I intend to present him with
a shilling instead.” |
“You daren't.” -
“Daren't!” I protested, and glanced uneasily at the
head-waiter. He caught my eye, smiled politely, and
sauntered towards our table. l
“You daren't,” repeated Millicent. “There is not a man
living that dare offer a shilling tip at the Bullionberg. He
will telepath it all over the building. The waiter will
trip you up as you leave; the cloak-room man will brush
your hat round the wrong way; and the commissionaire
will jam your thumb in the door of your car.” -
“I don't care,” I remarked defiantly.
“Well, here he comes,” she whispered.
straight in the eyes and give him
well-chosen words !” * * - -
He bowed as we rose to depart, and for some time I
stood fixing his eye with mine in stern, unrelenting silence.
It was not a long time. Perhaps a second—perhaps less.
Meanwhile I directed my gaze at his second shirt stud.
“I should like,” I said, “to state that I am excessively
dissatisfied with the performance of the waiter responsible
for this table.” . - - - - -
“I beg your pardon, Sir?” -
I repeated my sentence. He repeated his.
“The waiting here is rotten,” I explained. “Not only
were we left waiting between the courses, but the food,
with the exception of the ices, was cold when it did come.”
“You are not satisfied, Sir?” 4.- .
I felt that I was losing ground before his suave urbanity.
My small stock of courage was ebbing so fast that I was
forced to take immediate action. “I have the habit,” I
said, “ or perhaps I should say the vice, of presenting large
gratuities on these occasions.” I groped in my pocket for a
shilling. “There—take that. It is only a tenth part of
what you would have got if the attendance had met with
my approval.” ... ". :
He gazed at the coin and his cheeks flushed. He
stiffened himself up and bowed. “Sir," he said, “if you
will honour the Bullionberg with your presence on some
future occasion I shall hope to see your satisfaction recorded
by the presentation of the handsome gratuity which your
generosity usually prompts.” • * *-*
I retired hastily. I would have preferred to have my
hat brushed the wrong way; I would rather have faced
even his scornful wrath than this polite sarcasm.
Millicent, however, took a different view of his conduct.
“It wasn't sarcasm,” she said. “It was real admiration of
your courage. You are the only man living who has
dared to give him a nominal tip and he showed his respect
for your bravery by treating you with the deference he
would accord to a national hero. Peter, I am proud of you!”
Some day I may tell her. On my return home I dis-
covered that, in the confusion and agony of the moment, I
had given that confounded head-waiter a sovereign in
mistake for a shilling.
And now I can never dine at the Bullionberg again.
In my dreams I see him standing by the door, his face
aglow with expectancy, while behind him hovers the
swiftest-footed waiter on the whole staff.
“Now look him

PICKWICK FOR PARIS.
THERE may have been a French
translation of Pickwick for many years,
but it has only just come my way. As
with many another book in that alluring
but difficult tongue, I owe its possession
to the enterprise of Messrs. NELson,
j who, not satisfied with reducing the
price of novels in this country and
} causing us to bang our sevenpences at
| every railway station, have now carried
! the war to the Continent and are
making many even of the best foreign
publishers look exceedingly out-of-date.
| Before me lies Aventures de M.
| Pickwick, par CHARLEs DICKENs, in the
| traduction de P. GROLIER, who should
at once be made a member of the Boz
Club, with all the honours that go with
| that state; while English schoolmasters
in search of a manual by which the
French language may be read to their
pupils without tears should make a
| note of this book. -
I do not say that the translation is
perfect, but it will do. There may be a
lack of the finest raciness, but very
much of the immortal work has crossed
| the Channel successfully. Sam Weller's
curious substitution of the letter “V”
| for the letter “W" disappears, for
| instance. M. GROLIER was not up to
| that. And certain of his idioms go too
or are diluted. To give an example.
Sam, investigating the contents of the
| picnic hamper on the occasion of Mr.
| Pickwick's undue partiality to cold
punch, addresses the Fat Boy as “Young
| touch-and-go.” M. G.Roll ER turns this
to “jeune évaporé.” The Fat Boy, I
may remark, becomes “le gros garçon."
(without capitals), and his famous
speech to old Mr. Wardle, “I wants to
| make your flesh creep,” is watered
down to “Je veur vous faire frissonner"
Turning on to the delectable Eatanswill
passages (no effort being made by
M. GROLIER to Gallicise the name of
that borough) we meet Mrs. Leo Hunter
as Madame Chasselion.
Now and then, but not often, M.
GROLIER translates with an excess of
zeal, as when Captain Boldwig's com-
| mand to his men, “Wheel him [Mr.
Pickwick] to the devil,” becomes
“Roulez-le d tous les diables.”
| But let us look at a more extended
| passage. Here is Mr. Jingle's account
of his friend Sir Thomas Blazo's cricket
match, and of course cricket alone, with-
out any of these breathless trimmings,
would be inexplicable enough to the
ordinary French reader. “It must
have been rather a warm pursuit in
such a climate,” was Mr. Pickwick's
observation. Mr. Jingle then assures
him that it was. Thus:

That last passage in the dialogue is
a disappointment. In the deathless
English page it runs (as everyone will
remember), “Poor Quanko—never re-
covered it—bowled on, on my account,
bowled off, on his own—died, Sir.” -
But M. GROLIER cannot be blamed
for this. Jingle and Sam Weller talked
exclusively for Anglo-Saxons, if ever
men did. They are no more conveyable
into French than ARISTIDE BRUANT
or Yvette GUILBERT into English.
But Mr. Pickwick—he plants his foot
on the soil of La Belle France quite as
firmly as on that of his native land. I
congratulate the many French readers
to whom Messrs. NELsoN's enterprise
is now introducing him.

MUSICAL NOTES.
THE gratifying announcement that
Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE will
appear on the operatic boards, during
Mr. BEECHAM's season, in STRAUss's
Ariadne at Naros, has not only caused
musical and dramatic circles to vibrate
with a thrill of anticipatory pleasure,
but it has precipitated a number of
similar decisions on the part of other
eminent servants of the public. In
Sir HERBERT BEBRBoHM TREE's case,
however, the plunge had already been
prepared by his impersonation of BEE-
THoveN, in which he developed alto-
gether unexpected talent in the character
of a lightning composer.
Perhaps the most notable of these
débuts is that of Sir
GEORGE ALEXANDER, for
whom a one-act opera
has been written by
LEoNCAvALLo, in which
he will sustain the rôle
of Alessandro Scarlatti.
SCARLATTI, it will be re-
membered, composed no
fewer than five hundred
cantatas and one hun-
dred-and-twenty operas,
and in the course of the
opera, which occupies
about thirty-five minutes,
he will be seen composing
about two-hundred-and-
fifty of these works, with
the assistance of a new
instrument called the
Wireless Pianofortina.
Sir GEORGE will wear
the costume of the period,
including the famous

Granville Bantock, Mr. Josef Holbrooke,
and Dr. Brian O'Looney.
The statement that Signor CARUso in
receiving £42,000 for sixty performances
in America has established a new record
in artistic remuneration has elicited a
strongly-worded protest from Mr. Bam-
berger, the famous violinist, and son-in-
law of Sir Pompey Boldero, F.R.S.L.
Mr. Bamberger points out that during
his last tour in South America not only
did his receipts average £750 a per-
formance, or about 7 per cent. higher
than Signor CARUso's, but he also con-

I MANOEUVRED Charles into the lowest
of the easy-chairs, and then assumed a
tactical position (or is it strategic 2–I
never know) on the hearth-rug.
“So, Charles,” I said, beaming down
on him blandly from my vantage-
ground, “you find yourself at a loss
in a little matter of social strategy—or
tactics, Charles, if you take my fine
distinction—and you come to me for
advice. So-ho, my son l’’
With the help of a latch-key, a three- |
penny-bit and a cigar-cutter, I contrived
a little jingling business in my right-
hand trouser pocket. Charles is a year
my junior, and he had to accept my
offensive attitude because he needed
my help.

“not wanting to marry
either of her daughters,
I'm getting myself into
a false position by going

tions to dinner - parties

things when one's

“Well,” I replied,
after thinking it out,
“the thing seems to be
to take a sheet of note-

write: ‘Mr. Charles Car-

Mr. CYRIL MAUDE's invasion into the
realm of the lyric drama will be con-
fined to the ballet, in which he will
appear with the Russian dancers under
the alias of Tschukla Maudkin. He is
already studying the language diligently
and has attained considerable pro-
ficiency in the Cyrillic character under
the famous Bessarabian Archimandrite,
Igor Hopskotchky.
The visit of a famous violinist to
Wormwood Scrubbs prison last Sunday,
when she played to some of the inmates,
has been attended by some altogether
unexpected results, several hundred
amateurs having volunteered their ser-
vices in a similar capacity. The matteris
receiving the most careful consideration

“Of course not,” I said kindly.
“That is merely a recognised façon de

“You mean,” said Charles intelli-
gently, “that it's only an excuse. But
that 's just my trouble. I want a way
of declining that isn't already recog-
nised. Just to express your regrets,
giving no real reason, because the only
reason is ungivable, is a contemptible,
cowardly thing to do. But that's what
I shall be driven to. Nowadays every
excuse in the world has become fishy,
and none of 'em are red herrings.”
I surrendered the hearth-rug impul-
sively and sat down beside him,

way smooth for you. The golden rule in
refusing invitations is to accept them—
promptly and with fervour.”

“Well?” I asked, metaphorically
arching my back for a caress, as Charles
dropped in to see me some time later.
“You perfect ass!” said Charles;
from which I deduced that he had
made a mess of things.
“Do you mean to say that you
managed to arouse suspicion?” I ex-
claimed.
“The trouble of it is, I can't be

GETTING MARRIED.
IV.-SEAsoNABLE PRESENTs.
“I suppose,” I said, “it’s too late to
cancel this wedding now 2"
“Well,” said Celia, “the invitations
are out, and the presents are pouring
in, and Mother's just ordered the most
melting dress for herself that you ever
saw. Besides, who's to live in the
flat if we don’t 2 ”
“There's a good deal in what you
say. Still, I am alarmed, seriously
alarmed. Look here.” I drew out a
printed slip and flourished it before her.
“Not a writ? My poor Ronald !”
“Worse than that. This is the St.
Miriam's "bill of fare for weddings.
Celia, I had no idea marriage was so
expensive. I thought one rolled-gold
ring would practically see it.”
It was a formidable document. Start-
ing with “full choir and organ ” which
came to a million pounds, and working
down through “boys' voices only,” and
“red carpet” to “policemen for con-
trolling traffic—per policeman, 5s.,” it
included altogether some two dozen
ways of disposing of my savings.
“If we have the whole menu,” I
said, “I shall be ruined. You wouldn't
like to have a ruined husband.”
Celia took the list and went through
it carefully. -
“I might say “Season,’” I suggested,
“ or “Press.’”
“Well, to begin with,” said Celia,
“we needn't have a full choir.”
“Need we have an organ or a choir
at all? In thanking people for their
kind presents you might add, “By the
way, do you sing 2' Then we could
arrange to have all the warblers in the
front. My best man or my solicitor
could give the note.”
“Boys' voices only,” decided Celia.
“Then what about bells 2 ”
“I should like some nice bells. If
the price is ‘per bell' we might give
an order for five good ones.”
“Let’s do without bells. You see,
they don't begin to ring till we’ve left
the church, so they won't be any good
to us.”
This seemed to me an extraordina
line to take. • ,
“My dear Celia,” I remonstrated,
“the whole thing is being got up not
for ourselves, but for our guests. We
shall be much too preoccupied to appre-
ciate any of the good things we provide
—the texture of the red carpet or the
quality of the singing. I dreamt last
night that I quite forgot about the
wedding-ring till 1.30 on the actual
day, and the only cab I could find to
take me to a jeweller's was drawn by a
camel. Of course it may not turn out
to be as bad as that, but it will certainly
be an anxious afternoon for both of us.
And so we must consider the entertain-
ment entirely from the point of view of
our guests. Whether their craving is
for champagne or bells, it must be
satisfied.”
“I’m sure they'll be better without
bells. Because when the policemen call
out “Mr. Spifkins' carriage,' Mr. Spif-
kins mightn't hear if there were a lot
of bells clashing about.”
“Very well, no bells. But, mind
you,” I said sternly, “I shall insist on
a clergyman.”
We went through the rest of the
menu, course by course.
“I know what I shall do,” I said at
last. “I shall call on my friend the
Clerk again, and I shall speak to him
quite frankly. I shall say, ‘Here is a
cheque for a thousand pounds. It is
all I can afford—and, by the way, you'd
better pay it in quickly or it will be
dishonoured. Can you do us up a nice
wedding for a thousand inclusive?’”
“Like the Christmas hampers at the
Stores.”
“Exactly. A dozen boys' voices, a
half-dozen of bells, ten yards of awning,
and twenty-four oranges, or vergers, or
whatever it is. We ought to get a nice
parcel for a thousand pounds.”
“Or,” said Celia, “we might send
the list round to our relations as
suggestions for wedding presents. I'm
sure Jane would love to give us a
couple of policemen.”
“We'd much better leave the whole
thing to your father. I incline more
and more to the opinion that it is his
business to provide the wedding. I
must ask my solicitor about it.”
“He’s providing the bride.”
“Yes, but I think he might go further.
I can't help feeling that the bells would
come very well from him. “Bride's
father ºriº"A peal of bells.’
People would think it was something
in silver for the hall. It would do him
a lot of good in business circles.”
“And that reminds me,” smiled Celia,
“there's been some chat about a present
from Miss Popley.”
I have come to the conclusion that it
is impossible to get married decently
unless one's life is ordered on some sort
of system. Mine never has been ; and
the result is that I make terrible mis-
takes—particularly in the case of Miss
Popley. At the beginning of the busi-
ness, when the news got round to
Miss Popley, I received from her a
sweet letter of congratulation. Know-
ing that she was rather particular in
these matters I braced myself up and
thanked her heartily by return of post.
Three days later, when looking for a
cheque I had lost, I accidentally came
across her letter. “’Evings!” I cried.
“This came days ago, and I haven't
answered yet.” I sat down at once
and thanked her enthusiastically.
Another week passed and I began to
feel that I must really make an effort
to catch my correspondence up; so I
got out all my letters of congratulation
of the last ten days and devoted an
afternoon to answering them. I used
much the same form of thanks in all
of them . . . . with the exception of
Miss Popley's, which was phrased
particularly warmly. -
So much for that. But Miss Popley
is Celia's dear friend also. When I
made out my list of guests I included
Miss Popley; so, in her list, did Celia.
The result was that Miss Popley received
two invitations to the wedding . . .
Sometimes I fear she must think we
are pursuing her.
“What does she say about a present?”
I asked. f
“She wants us to tell her what we
want.”
“What are we to say? If we said
an elephant—”
“With a small card tied on to his ear,
and ‘Best wishes from Miss Popley'
on it. It would look heavenly among
the other presents.”
“You see what I mean, Celia. Are
we to suggest something worth a thou-
sand pounds, or something worth nine-
pence? It's awfully kind of her, but it
makes it jolly difficult for us.”
“Something that might cost anything
from ninepence to a thousand pounds,”
suggested Celia.
“Then that washes out the elephant.”
“Can't you get the ninepenny ones
now 2 ” -
“I suppose,” I said, reverting to the
subject which most weighed on me,
“she wouldn't like to give the men's
voices for the choir 2"
“No, I think a clock,” said Celia.
“A clock can cost anything you like—
or don't like.”
“Right-o. And perhaps we'd better
settle now—When it comes, how many
times shall we write and thank her for
it 2 ''
Celia considered.
think,” she said.
::: :k ::: :: :
Well, as Celia says, it's too late to
draw back now. But I shall be glad
when it's all over. As I began by
saying, there's too much “arranging ”
and “settling” and “fixing” about the
thing for me. In the necessary nego-
tiations and preparations I fear I have
not shone. And so I shall be truly
glad when we have settled down in our
flat . . . and Celia can restore my
confidence in myself once more by
talking loudly to her domestic staff

COMPENSATION AT LAST.
I HAVE lived to bless the name of
Mr. DAVID LLoyd GEORGE. Let it be
recorded in deathless ink.
A few days ago I was introduced to
a man named Wilverley. This morning
I met him in the street, and he greeted
me with a friendliness which at once
aroused my suspicions.
“Good morning, Mr. Smith,” he 9/
cried. “I hope you are perfectly fit?”
“So, so, thanks,” I admitted grudg:
ingly. Was it concert tickets, I won-
dered, or fountain pens, or a loan?
“What a lovely morning!” he con-
tinued, waving his hand patronisingly
towards the heavens. “Beautiful
morning !” -
“Pretty fair," I replied, “considering
all things.”
And then I saw what it was. Pro-
truding from his breast pocket was .
folded paper, upon the top of which I
could distinguish the words “Insurance
Company.” -
“Well, good-bye, Mr. Wilverley," I
said, “I must be getting on to the
office.” -
“Good-bye, Mr. Smith,” said he
“Oh, by the way,” he added, “are you

ESSENCE OF PARLIA-

(ExTRAcTED FROM THE DIARY of
Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Monday,
May 5. — Lord NEwton's con-
spicuous success as a Parliament
man is result of education in
several schools. To diplomacy
he gave six years of a young life.
He was trained in War by the
Imperial Yeomanry. Best of all,
he sat in the House of Commons
for thirteen years. With ex-
ception of Lord RosBBERY, ever a
star apart, and Lord LANSDow NE,
handicapped by circumstance, all
prominent peers have served
apprenticeship in rough-riding
school of House of Commons and
have benefited accordingly.
Lord HALSBURY has certain
dominant qualities constitution-
ally congenial to the hereditary
Chamber. To complete the fit-
ness of things he ought to have
been born to a coroneted crib.
As it is he stands almost the
last survivor of that full-blooded
courageous Conservatism which
sixty years ago was the very life

succession of courses resulted in
its being thrown out, the passing
of the Parliament Act, and the
present position of the long pre-
dominant partner in the legislative
firm.
Lord NEwton, being, as he
said to-night, “of abnormally
modest disposition,” has since
he went to the House of Lords
worked more obscurely. In his
too-infrequent speeches he brings
to a jaded atmosphere wholesome
whiffs of House of Commons'
manner. However dull debate
may be, when he rises to continue
it instant change is wrought.
The sun shines where of late
leaden clouds prevailed. His
humour is inclined to be mor-
dant but is not therefore less
acceptable. Noble lords who
bestow the decórous tribute of a
smile upon peers disposed to
make merriment have more than
once been known to laugh heartily
at Lord NEwTo.N's quips and
cranks. Withal he is a man of
business, as is testified by the
success with which he piloted

himself at odds. Foreign SECRETARY's
response to this lament equally touch-

WALTER LoNG crowned an episode
peculiar to, perhaps only possible in,
the House of Commons. Amid general
cheering he paid tribute to “the fine
courage and unruffled dignity with
which the PRIME MINISTER had faced
opposition of a kind that was a
discredit and a disgrace to the whole

MARJORIE ON THE TURF.
I was considering a voluminous brief
when the telephone rang.
“Yes,” I said.
“Is that you, Dick 2" said a girl's
WOlce.
“I’m not sure,” I replied guardedly.
“Who is that 2 ''
“Me, Marjorie, your cousin. Your
father was my mother's brother, you
know.”
“Enough,” I said. “Good morning,
Marjorie.”
“Good morning. I say, Dick, do
call in on your way home. It's busi-
ness, most important.”
“Business 2 ”
“Yes, I'm in an awful hurry now;
good-bye.” -
I returned to the brief, marvelling.
Marjorie, I reflected, was a butterfly;
business, on the other hand, was
business.
I pondered on the matter for the
rest of the morning; in the afternoon I
was nearly worried about it. Eventu-
ally the day passed.
It was about half-past six when I
arrived at my Aunt's house. Marjorie
met me in the hall and conducted me
mysteriously into the drawing-room.
“Now,” she began, “I’ve got a
brilliant idea. You'll never guess it.
I'm going to put my new Summer hat
on a horse.” She smiled at me.
“What on earth for?” I asked rather
shortly.
The drawing-room is an uncomfort-
able room, and my Aunt doesn't allow
smoking.
“A bet, of course.”
“It seems rather futile. The horse
will probably ruin your hat. He'll
shake it off and trample on it.”
“Don’t be absurd," said Marjorie.
“I’m going to back a horse with the
money for my new hat.”

EPISTLE TO THOMAS BLACK,
CAT TO THE SOANE MUSEUM.
PARDON, dear Sir, if with intrusive pen
I would remind you that we met last week;
Not that you showed me any favour then,
Nor that I have forgot the infernal cheek
You tendered to your fellow-citizen,
Wailing your yellow eyes, where black and sleek
You graced the hearth-rug in the glittering gloom
Of Sir John SoANE's be-mirrored breakfast-room.
Which snub to soften, an official leant,
Hinting, behind his tactful fingers, that
It was but seldom that you quite unbent,
Being almost a statutory cat;
If not retained by Act of Parliament
(As is your noble shrine) at least you sat,
Kept up by twenty shillings and tradition,
As part and parcel of the exhibition.
For when (he added in an undertone)
Each Reynolds, Fuseli and Bartolozzi,
Hogarth and Lawrence was bequeathed by SoANE
With Roman marbles and Athenian pots, he
Begrudged to leave them lifeless and alone,
So, having ranged them in appropriate spots, l.c

His last word in Domestic Architecture.
Thus far Authority. Now, might I ask it,
How came you, Thomas, by this lofty station
From kittenhood and the maternal basket 2
Was there, perchance, some stiff examination
Such as tests candidates whose pleasant task it
Is to advance the cause of education—
In places advertised you often see 'em,
On outside pages of The Athenæum ?
And how were you appointed 2 Was it fate or
The cat before, some mid-Victorian mouser,
Leſt you the seat Death bade him abdicate, or
Did hirelings kidnap you like Kaspar Hauser?
Did rich relations canvass the Curator
And the Trustees on your behalf 2 Allow, Sir,
Some little light to dawn upon the mystery
Of Thomas Black his entrance into History.
Oh! happy he for whom does not exist
Our later London—that superb disaster,
Who, in his Georgian hermitage has missed
Our schemes of girders overlaid with plaster,
Who has not met a Post-Impressionist
Nor heard a maniac acclaimed a master,
But sits with those who draw their weekly salary
Soothed by dim models of the Dulwich Gallery
For, be their outlook dull, at least ’tis clean.
Not so the cat's, whose whole existence spent is
In some half-lighted haunt of the obscene—
The studio of that modern idle 'prentice
Who thinks he has the trick of Hog ARTH's spleen
(Of course he's twice the draughtsman) if his bent is
To paint that vice with intimate elation
Which Hog ARTH limned, apart, with detestation.
All this you're spared; and so you might have paid
Some courtesy to those—a very few—
Who come, withdrawn from that exterior shade,
To spend an hour with sanity and you;
And when you saw that I had gladly stayed,
Not closed your eye-lids and our interview,
But told me what the contents of each case meant
And let me come with you to see the basement.
Yet, after all, you know your part; doze on:
You are no common cat, you rather seem,
If not the incarnation of Sir John,
To be at least the creature of his dream;
Visitors enter, sign their names, are gone—
You stay, the centre of his classic scheme.
Blink not an ear for me—'t were not expedient–
But let me rest, Dear Sir, your most obedient.

THE Club Annual Dinner Season has
now opened, and our special repre-
sentative sends us his report of a ver
notable function which he attended last
night. We have pleasure in publishing
his account of the proceedings, as they
appear to have been organised and
carried out in a manner so appropriate
as to serve as a model of what such
entertainments should be:—
MEssrs. STARCHAL AND SELFGRove.
The members of the mixed hockey
club attached to this well-known
emporium held their annual dinner and
soirée at the Remnant Gallery on the
15th, when an altogether enjoyable
evening was spent.
The rooms were tastefully and appro-
priately decorated for the occasion, even
the gas-brackets being supplied with
mantles. The floral scheme was carried
out in stocks.
Punctually at 6.3 the company sat
down to the following menu:—
Chiffons.
Crêpe de chine
Torchon.
Mannequins.
Sauce mousseline de soie.
Le dernier cri.
Panne. Tulle.
Eau de nil. Suède.
After dinner the hockey president,
who plays at full back, gave the annual
address, his thesis being that “one half
often doesn't know how the other halves
live.” Incidentally he discussed the
famous Pass of Killiecrankie. On one
side it had been urged that the pass
was a clean and beautiful one; on the
other, that it couldn't be called a real
pass, the extremists holding that Killie-
crankie never passed at all.
During the address there was a cry
of “Fire!” It appeared that some of
the new spring shades were blazing,
but owing to promptness in turning on
the open-work hose little or no damage
was done.
The proceedings concluded with a
capital concert and dramatic entertain-
ment. Among the items most applauded
were The Song of the Shirt, feelingly
sung by Miss Black (Blouses); The
Inch Tape Rock, a powerful recitation
by Mr. Lapels (Ladies' Tailoring); a
scene from Measure for Measure, ex-
cellently enacted by the young ladies
of the Combinations Department; and
the evergreen quartette, White Sales,
they never grow weary, in the chorus
of which all present heartily joined.
Altogether a most enjoyable time
was spent, and everyone left in high

garden,
Please, your pardon,
But I've waited for the train for nearly
five-and-twenty minutes,
And I've seen our only porter shoo the
little olive linnets
From the apple-blossom's petals,
While the smooth and shiny metals
Run all empty up and down,
To and from the Town of London—
London Town,
And what else is there to do
If I may not talk to you?
Now there's something in your restful
yellow tawny,
Soft and lawny-
Looking faces that can calm a rather
righteous irritation,
And your scent, with tar and sunshine,
fills our humble little station
With a country smell and proper

And that gold could never buy,
Though you search the shops of Lon-

For 'tis home and May and mirth,
So 'tis all that's best on earth !

villain of the piece, and Miss Beatrice Western,
as the villainess, were rewarded for their
efforts by many kisses from the audience,
which showed that they acted their respective

Alas for an age where vice is so
popular.

THE MOUSE TRAP.
“You never can tell,” said the girl who helped in the
Flat, “when a man's going to mike a fool of 'isself. Some
on 'em does it young—I've known a tidy few like that,
comin' messin’ about the 'ouse, or oglin' the front door, or
tryin' to mike love to the parlour winders when they fancy
you're a-settin' belind them, and you ain't near the plice.
It seems a silly wye to go on, don't it, but they will do it
and you can't 'elp yerself. Then there's others, old men, I
mean, that's gone on all their lives mikin' money—ah, and
investin' of it too—and gettin' their 'eads bald with all the
wise things they've bin plannin' at, and it all goes pop
sudden-like jest as if they'd bin a bottle o' ginger beer and
all the 'idden foolishness comes foamin' out. If you don't
stop 'em in time they'll go on till they're empty.
“We've 'ad a example o' that in our own fam’ly, and the
man as give the example was Uncle Bill. O' course you'd
never'a' thought it of 'im, 'e's that venrable-lookin', with a
great gold chain 'angin' acrorst 'is weskit and a long black
coat and shiny boots. You can always tell with your eyes
shut when Uncle Bill's walkin' anywhere, 'is boots creak
so. Father says a small 'ouse ain't no good to Uncle Bill.
'E wants a palis to show 'isself orf in, bein’ sich a creaker
as 'e is. But there, when you come to be a matter o'
seventeen stone you must 'ave a bit o' shoe leather under
you to keep you up, and a man as 'as got 'ouse property
and money put away I reckon e' can afford to mike a noise
and nobody ain't goin' to throw it up in their fices, as the
sayin' is. Besides, Uncle Bill's gettin' on in life. Father
says more 'n sixty autumns 'as passed over 'is 'ead and took
what's left of 'is 'air; but Uncle don't mind. 'E used to say
'e's never wanted to be nothin' but a bacheldore, and as
'e's never gone courtin' e' 'asn't 'ad to worry 'isself about
lookin' as smart as some.
“Since we 'ad that little trouble about the Montynegroes
we 'adn't seen much of Uncle, and we didn't know what
'e 'd bin up to. 'Owever last Sunday mornin' 'e sends a
letter round to mother sayin' as 'e'll come round and drink
a cup o' tea if agreeable, and there was a poscrip marked
“privit and confident’ to say 'e was 'opin' to bring some one
with him, but 'e won't tell mother 'oo it is till they meet
fice to fice, when 'e's sure they'll mike a good impression
on theirselves. As soon as she reads it mother shouts out,
“The ole fool's bin got 'old of by one o' them designers—I
know the sort—and she'll 'ave the banns called afore we
can lift a 'and to save 'im.' Father larfed and said, if so, it
was a judgment on Uncle Bill for not 'avin' bin married
afore; but, any'ow, mother oughtn't to 'oller before she knew;
p'raps Uncle Bill was meanin' to bring the Duke o' DEvoN-
sHIRE or the Archbishop o' CANTERBURY to 'ave a taste o'
mother's tea-kikes. Father always is one for 'is jokes when
'e's in a good temper.
“Well, when tea-time come we was all on the gog, as
you may say, and we 'adn't bin settin' there for more 'n
a minnit afore we 'eard Uncle Bill's boots a-creakin', with
another pair o' boots pit-pattin' along with 'em. ‘’Oo was
right 2' says mother; but she couldn't say no more, for
Uncle Bill come in and walks up to mother and says
quick and whisperin' like, ‘I’ve brought Miss Mumbles.
She's—well, you'll see what she is when you see 'er. You
and 'er's sure to 'it it orf.”
“‘Bring 'er in,’ says mother quite proud and cold, and
Uncle goes out and fetches Miss Mumbles in. My eye, but
she was one for colours—dark blue silk dress and red ribbons
and a 'at with a long feather and a grey perlisse—you never
see sich a set-out. Forty if she was a day she was, but she
'ad a fine 'igh colour and larfed very pleasant and took 'er
tea with 'er gloves on jest like a lidy.
“At first there warn’t no talk—jest a word or two about
the 'orrid weather, and what would the Suffragettes be up
to next, and 'ow well the Queen was lookin'; but arter a
bit father began to dror out Uncle Bill, and 'e set to work
on 'is politics in fine style, and father pertendin' to agree
with 'im, and Miss Mumbles settin' there and admirin' 'im.
At last Uncle Bill begun to think 'e was mikin' a speech
and 'e banged on the table and opened 'is mouth, and
before you could say ‘pip' 'is false teeth, the 'ole set of 'em,
dropped out on the table in front of 'im. “You’ve lorst
your mouse-trap, Bill,’ says father, and Uncle Bill ketches
'em up and pops 'em in agin. But 'e was too late. Miss
Mumbles 'ad seen 'em, and she give a shriek and called out
that she never could a-bear false teeth, and then she goes
orf into 'igh strikes. 'Ow we got 'er and Uncle Bill away
I can't rightly say, but Uncle come round the next day and
told mother 'e'd done with women, and if 'e'd known 'ow
false they was 'e'd never 'a' took up with 'em. It made
father larſ till 'e cried. 'E ain't got over it yet.”
FUTILITY.
Now dawns the annual poetic prime,
When, for some reason, every bardic breast
Thrills to a flow of fresh and fruitful rhyme,
And be it said, to some extent, that I'm
No better than the rest.
I too, like these, would make the echoes ring;
Like theirs, my fleeting hopes wax free and fine;
Only, as soon as I begin to sing,
My Muse inevitably runs to Spring;
And there I draw the line.
Whate'er the theme by which my heart is stirred,
Epic or excerpt from the Daily Press,
It matters not; before I write one word,
Thoughts of a cuckoo or some silly bird
Doom me to nothingness.
And, tho' I crush them down and strive for hours
To turn my well-known grace and famous ease
On to the job in hand, my noblest powers
Are chilled by a stern need to sing of flowers
Or, just as likely, trees.
'Tis a strange thing, this influence in the air;
In point of fact, this month that men call sweet
Makes no appeal to me. I do not care
For the young growth that others hold so fair,
Or birds, except to eat.
Dut there the fact remains. With each new day
I want to sing; I feel inclined to soar;
And when my dearest dreams are thrown away
I am annoyed. I find much fault with May
For putting in her oar.
To give a poet's Muse an upward shove,
Then hold her down, is neither good nor wise;
Of course there still remains the topic, Love;
But that 's the very subject which, above
All others, I despise. DUM-DUM.

Jon ES HAS JUST MADE ONE OF HIS BEST Jokes IN A DENTIST's WAITING-ROOM.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
AMONG writers of good fiction I should call that clever
lady, Mrs. HENRY DE LAPASTURE, the most entirely feminist.
Mothers are perhaps her favourites, but in all her stories
Place auw Dames is the prevailing motto. I found this
note as strong as ever in her latest, though at first sight
you would naturally expect a book called Michael Ferrys
(SMITH ELDER) to be chiefly about Michael Ferrys. Later
you find that it is much more about the women who were
in love with him. There were three of these, or four if you
include the rather battered sentiment of Mrs. Carseleigh—
an admirably suggested character, by the way, whom I
should have liked in greater detail. The others were
Winefride, to whom he was engaged, her young sister
Thekla, and Edith, who loved him most of all, and should
have secured the prize if I had been consulted. But you
must not imagine Michael himself to be a mere lay figure.
Far from it. The struggles of this ingenuous and engaging
young millionaire between love and honesty are admirably
true and human. The trouble was that Winefride came of
an old Catholic house, and couldn't marry Michael unless
he moved over to her own faith. Michael had no religion
at all, except a kindly optimism, and wouldn't pretend,
even to marry the lady of his heart. You observe that the
author has here a difficult and delicate task; I think no
one could find offence in her treatment of it, which is both
fair and honest. I liked the last pages enormously; they
are a model in the art of suggestion and restraint. A
pleasant story, laid among somewhat graver issues than
most, but none the less attractive.
If the author of The Ambassadress (HEINEMANN) had not
assured us that his name is WILLIAM WRIOTHESLEY, one
might have suspected him of belonging to another gender,
so womanly is his interest in his heroine's tea-gowns (a
“lovely loose-draped diaphanous thing,” “a long loose
drapery thing”), and so marked is his lack of reticence on
sex-matters. Indeed, one story that he wantonly drags in is
of so strange an impropriety that it must have escaped his
pen in a moment of extreme emasculation. The scenes are
chiefly laid in Berlin, where Mr. WRIOTHESLEY seems to have
had a nodding acquaintance with Embassy circles. Of side-
lights on their official aspect we get little, but a great deal
of gossip on the part of the womenfolk, whose wit, if we
may judge by samples, he sadly overrates. A cosmopolitan
(he has visited Venice and even gone so far afield as the
Acropolis), he enjoys a greater command of foreign tags of
speech than of his own language, in which he permits him-
self certain solecisms—“acquiescence to,” “accredited "
for “credited,” “to lay off her things.” But a worse blot
on the book is the character of the alleged “hero,” Prince
Lichtenfeld. One would not have minded his being so
preposterous a cad if he had not shattered our faith in two
delightful and intelligent women, Alera, and her stepmother
the British Ambassadress; for it was past belief that the
one should fall in love with him and the other approve him
as an eligible. Ronalds, of the American Embassy, is a
pleasant utility man for whom the Ambassadress cultivates
a Platonic affection not without its charm, if only they had
subjected it to rather less analysis. Indeed, all through his
book the author encourages his people to talk too much,
and then at the end makes up for lost time by compressing
into a single chapter the solution of his problem, based on

the fable that “Ambassadors' daughters never marry.”
Here, her poor little brother Paul, an attractive figure, has
at the shortest notice to be paralysed in a motor accident
for the too obvious reason that Alera must somehow secure
a mission in life, if only as an amateur nurse. Apart from
the freshness of its scenes, Mr. WRIOTHESLEY's work has
the merit of promise rather than of achievement.
“Pipe on, Master Chance: be it sad or gay, I'll trip to
your measure.” So the old play, quoted by AGNEs and
EGERTON CASTLE on the title-page of their Chance the
Piper (SMITH, ELDER). But let me at once relieve the
anxiety of the public, or, as I suppose will be the case with
some, disappoint their - - -
hopes. There are no
rag - time measures in
this book. The stories
belong chiefly to the
seventeenth and eigh-
teenth centuries, to the
times of the Fire of
London and Louis LE
BIEN - AIM E, of the
French Wars and the
Revolution. Their
motifs are love and hate
and jealousy and re-
venge, in the days when
duels were as courtly
as the Pavane, and

chains at bleak cross-
roads. Later on there
are three that belong to
times nearer our own—
two in which the pip-
ing of Chance leads to
battle-fields in China
and South Africa; and
one, an Irish story, told
in a brogue that might
have come from the
pen of SYNGE or Lady GREGoRY, that begins with a wake
and ends with a wedding jig. This last is, I think, the best
in the book, not only because of its fidelity to truth in the
dialect, but because it is so unlike the authors' usual work,
as far as it is known to me. That perhaps sounds rather an
Irish compliment. But what I mean is that the way in
which they have seized the true Irish spirit, as well as
the true Irish talk, proves once more the versatility of
their gifts.

I remember being greatly pleased some time ago with
a book called The Little Green Gate; and now here are my
own words of praise confronting me from the page opposite
the title of Miss STELLA CALLAGHAN's new story, Vision
(CoNSTABLE). Naturally therefore I read Vision with an
interest almost paternal. I may say at once that the result
was by no means disappointing; Miss CALLAGHAN has again
shewn her power of writing an unusual story with grace
and insight. Perhaps the story itself is a little more con-

ventional than its predecessor; the young poet and dreamer
in contact with an unsympathetic world is a figure not
altogether new to fiction; but I question if he has ever been
portrayed with more understanding. Antony Wyatt is his
name. You are shown him in childhood, an alien in the
home of his bewildered and exasperated parents; at school,
the favourite of the one master who understands him, and
who takes him in the holidays to the beautiful old house
Glayde, where he meets the girl who is to play her appointed
part in his making. Throughout it is of course the figure
of Antony, appealing in his youth and dreams, for whom
your sympathy is demanded; though for my own part I
confess to sparing a little for the ordinary persons whom he
- bewildered. At the end,
having abandoned orbeen
deserted by everyone, he
“turned exultant to face
life.” We are never told
how ; and I felt here a
little like the parson and
his wife in Candida,
about whom the stage-
direction says, if I recall
it rightly, “They do not
know the secret of the
poet's heart.” Still, these
uncertainties and even
some villainously care-
less punctuation could
not spoil my enjoyment
of a very charming story.

the movement of his story. The struggle between a very
Protestant squarson and a young High Church parson (who
ultimately joins the Church of Rome) is not without interest,
but I should have squeezed more enjoyment from it if
Mr. CARADoc's sympathies with the younger man had not
been so obviously paraded. Rarely has a more insufferable
prig than the Rev. Sir Lucius Marples been drawn in
fiction, and the best that I can say for him is that to give
him a cobbler with no morals for his chief champion in the
fight was to handicap him unmercifully.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDO
|MAY 21, 1913.
CHARIVARI.
ON THE BAT’S BACK.
WITH the idea of brightening cricket,
my friend Twyford has given me a new
bat. I have always felt that, in my
own case, it was the inadequacy of the
weapon rather than of the man behind
it which accounted for a certain mo-
notony of low-scoring; with this new
bat I hope to prove the correctness of
my theory.
My old bat has always been a trier,
but of late it has been manifestly past
its work. Again and again its drive
over long-off's head has failed to carry
the bunker at mid-off. More than once
it has proved itself an inch too narrow
to ensure that cut-past-third-man-to-
the-boundary which is considered one
of the most graceful strokes in my
repertoire. Worst of all, I have found
it at moments of crisis (such as the
beginning of the first over) utterly
inadequate to deal with the ball which
keeps low. When bowled by such a
ball—and I may say that I am never
bowled by any other—I look reproach-
fully at the bottom of my bat as I walk
back to the pavilion. "Surely,” I say
to it, “you were much longer than this
when we started out 2 ”.
Perhaps it was not magnanimous
always to put the blame on my partner
for our accidents together. It would
have been more chivalrous to have
shielded him. “No, no,” I should have
said to my companions as they received
me with sympathetic murmurs of “Bad
luck,”—“no, no, you mustn't think
that. It was my own fault. Don't
reproach the bat.” It would have been
well to have spoken thus; and indeed,
when I had had time to collect myself,
I did so speak. But out on the field,
in the first shame of defeat, I had to let
the truth come out. That one reproach-
ful glance at my bat I could not hide.
But there was one habit of my bat's
—a weakness of old age, I admit, but
not the less annoying—about which
it was my duty to let all the world
know. One's grandfather may have a
passion for the gum on the back of
postage-stamps, and one hushes it up;
but if he be deaf the visitor must be
warned. My bat had a certain loose-
ness in the shoulder, so that, at any
quick movement of it, it clicked. If I
struck the ball well and truly in the
direction of point this defect did not
matter; but if the ball went past me
into the hands of the wicket-keeper an
unobservant bowler would frequently
say, “How's that 2." And an ill-
informed umpire would reply, “Out.”
It was my duty before the game began
to take the visiting umpire on one side
and give him a practical demonstration
of the click . . .
Put these are troubles of the past.
I have my new bat now, and I
can see that cricket will become a
different game for me. My practice of
this morning has convinced me of this.
It was not one of your stupid practices
at the net, with two burly professionals
bumping down balls at your body
and telling you to come out to them,
Sir. It was a quiet practice in my
rooms after breakfast, with no moving
object to distract my attention and
spoil my stroke. The bat comes up
well. It is light, and yet there is
plenty of wood in it. Its drives along
the carpet were excellent; its cuts and
leg glides all that could be wished. I
was a little disappointed with its half-
arm hook, which dislodged a teacup and
gave what would have been an easy
catch to mid-on standing close in by the
sofa ; but I am convinced that a little
oil will soon put that right.
And yet there seemed to be some-
thing lacking in it. After trying every
stroke with it; after tucking it under
my arm and walking back to the bath-
room, touching my cap at the pianola
on the way; after experiments with it
in all positions, I still felt that there
was something wanting to make it
the perfect bat. So I put it in a cab
and went round with it to Henry.
Henry has brightened first-class cricket
for some years now. -
“Tell me, Henry,” I said, “what's
wrong with this bat?”
“It seems all right,” he said, after
waving it about. “Rather a good one.”
I laid it down on the floor and looked
at it. Then I turned it on its face and
looked at it. And then I knew.
“It wants a little silver shield on the
back,” I said. “That's it.”
“Why, is it a presentation bat?”
asked Henry. r
“In a sense, yes. It was presented
to me by Twyford.”
“What for 2 ” -
“Really,” I said modestly, “I hardly
like Why do people give one things?
Affection, Henry; pity, generosity–
er * > -
“Are you going to put that on the
shield 2 Presented out of sheer pity
t x * x
“Don’t be silly ; of course not. I
shall put ‘Presented in commemoration
of his masterly double century against
the Authentics,” or something like that.
You've no idea, how it impresses the
wicket-keeper. He really sees quite a
lot of the back of one's bat.”
“Your inscription,” said Henry, as
he filled his pipe slowly, “will be either
a lie or extremely unimpressive.”
“It will be neither, Henry. If I put
my own name on it, and talked about
my double century, of course it would
be a lie; but the inscription will be to
Stanley Bolland.”
“Who’s he 2 ”
“I don't know. I've just made him
up. But now, supposing my little shield
says, 'Stanley Bolland. H.P.C.C.—
Season 1912. Batting average 116:34.'
—how is that a lie 2 ”
“What does H.P.C.C. stand for 2 ''
“I don't know. It doesn't mean
anything really. I'll leave out “Batting
average' if it makes it more truthful.
‘Stanley Bolland. H.P.C.C., 1912.
116:34.' It's really just a little note
I make on the back of my bat to
remind me of something or other I've
forgotten. 116:34 is probably Bolland's
telephone number or the size of some-
thing I want at his shop. But by a
pure accident the wicket-keeper thinks
it means something else; and he tells
the bowler at the end of the over that
it's that chap Bolland who had an
average of over a century for the
Hampstead Polytechnic last year. Of
course that makes the bowler nervous
and he starts sending down long-
hops.” :
"I see,” said Henry; and he began
to read his paper again.
So to-morrow I take my bat to the
silversmith's, and have a little engraved
shield fastened on. Of course with a
really trustworthy weapon I am certain
to collect pots of runs this season. But
there is no harm in making things as
easy as possible for oneself. . . .
And yet there is this to be thought
of. Even the very best bat in the
world may fail to score, and it might so
happen that I was dismissed (owing to
some defect in the pitch) before my
silver shield had time to impress the
opposition. Or again, I might (through
ill-health) perform so badly that quite
a wrong impression of the standard of
the Hampstead Polytechnic would be
created, an impression which I should
hate to be the innocent means of cir-
culating. - -
So on second thoughts I lean to a
different inscription. On the back of
my bat a plain silver shield will say
quite simply this:— .
TO
STANLEY BOLLAND,
FOR SAVING LIFE AT SEA.
FROM A FEW ADMIRERs.
Thus I shall have two strings to my
bow. And if, by any unhappy chance,
I fail as a cricketer, the wicket-keeper
will say to his comrades as I walk
sadly to the pavilion, “A poor bat
perhaps, but a brave—a very brave
fellow.”
It becomes us all this season to make
at least one effort to brighten cricket.

THE FOOD OF LOVE.
[Regular and hearty meals are recommended as a cure for love-sickness.]
| THERE's a weight on my day that is crushing me slowly
but surely,
On my night there's a burden that seems evermore to
increase,
And Icome, oh! my dear, tho' I'm feeling excessively poorly,
To appeal to your sense of proportion for timely release.
From the day that you answered me “No," with apparent
conviction
(And you haven't a ghost of a notion how frightful it feels),
I have turned, in the sinking that comes of internal affliction,
To the tonic and solace of hearty and regular meals.
In the morning I rise with a heart that is empty and hollow
To the task of sustaining myself through a profitless day,
But a fish and a steak, with some eggs, and an apple to follow,
Are but ashes within me as soon as I've put them away.
So I dwindle till luncheon, when sorrow has made me
voracious,
And again I endure till the afternoon teacake and cup;.
While, altho' I go nap at a dinner both ample and spacious,
The depression is on me before I can decently sup.
| Very hard, oh! my dear, is the day; but the night-time is
harder,
For I tumble in dreams and my slumbers are broken and
short;
If I walk in my sleep I unerringly go to the larder,
So intense is the natural outcry of love for support.
It is thus for two months that I've striven to conquer my
passion;
Not a meal have I missed nor a dish; but I honestly vow
That however the treatment has dulled my despair, in a
fashion,
I would sooner see you than my dinner, my love, even now.
So I pray you give ear to my pleading, for, little by little,
I'm acquiring, I fear, an habitual longing to eat;
And e'en now, for a man who was never a slave to his
victual,
I'm distressingly partial to pastry and things that are
sweet.
Then be kindly, my dear, or I tremble to think of the issue,
Of the end, if you cannot relent, that is looming in sight;
You were ever opposed to a superabundance of tissue,
And already I've gone up a stone and my boots are too
tight. DUM-DUM.

Summer Memories, 1912. Mr. Belturp
has been content to show us nothing
at all but the mastery of his brush
over his observation—and we are grate-
ful to him.
Realism can only be welcome when
it is as loftily treated as in Mr. Stirl-
wing's Rise or Fall 2–a Wire from
Throgmorton Street. Where few artists
could resist the temptation to pander
to sensationalism, Mr. Stirlwing (who
as a brilliant contributor to the Unionist
Press is equally facile with his pen as
his brush) has kept austerely to his
verities. The scene of this historic
picture is an interrupted Cabinet
Meeting. A secretary has entered with
a telegram, and the ATToRNEY-GENERAL
opens the envelope with trembling
hands. (We remember nothing so
masterly as this tremble since CAR-
Lotti's great picture, in the 1896
Salon, of The Earthquake at Lisbon.)
Various members of the Cabinet cluster
around him, forgetful of the Declara-
tion of War from Montenegro which
lies on the table. The ready-reckoner
in the hands of the CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchEQUER is indicated with amazing
technique. Equally powerful is the
double motif which deliberately forces
the attention from the tensity of this
central group to the stern chiascuros of
Viscount MoRLEY, sitting in stony
aloofness, the flushed and indignant
PREMIER, and the delightfully spon-
taneous irritation of the MINISTER of
For EIGN AFFAIRs, who has been ob-
viously disturbed during an exposition
of policy. Loath as we are to commend
any picture which “tells a story,” we
cannot deny the dramatic inventiveness
of this remarkable work, albeit that it
obtains what is best described as a
succès de Scandale.
Commendable again is the fiery
bravura of Mr. Angus McOban's sombre
little battle picture, “The Observer”
|pursuing a Mixed Metaphor; and the
sheer triumph of delicate whimsicality
over photographic commonplaces in
Mr. Herbert Cockayne's Central Peak
of the Caucasus—as seen from Chelsea.
It is lamentable that these pictures
we have approved are almost the only
works of the year that conform to even
those rudimentary canons of the painter,
that the object of his art should be to
surprise rather than to please, to be-
wilder rather than to gratify the senses,
to stimulate the educated modern desire
for a puzzle competition rather than
the philistine and Victorian craving for
mere vulgar beauty. Again and again
the critical perception is outraged in
this exhibition by such wilfully retro-
grade attempts as Mr. St. John
Palmer's Sunset on the Indian Ocean,
a meticulous reproduction, banally per-
fect in colour and spirit, of a crude
effect of Nature that can be seen by any
globe-trotter; or Mr. Parton Hobbs's
orthodox Magic of the Moonlight; or
Miss Sylvia Lortimer's Cattle at the
Ford, wherein the cattle are so like real
cattle and the water so alive with light
and movement that we left this year's
Academy with a feeling as regards
British Art that is akin to despair.
coming KINGs. .
THE following unofficial account of
some of the candidates for the throne of
Albania will, Mr. Punch feels sure, be
of interest and profit to his readers:—
Lord CURzoN of KEDLEston, who
has been approached by the deputies
in London, has neither declined nor
accepted the offer of the Albanian
throne. It is understood that he has
insisted on the following conditions,
which are receiving careful considera-
tion: The inclusion in his territories of
the Thracian Chersonese, to be spelt
Curzonese in future; and a salute of
199 pompoms on all public occasions.
The Italian candidate is, we under-
stand, Signor GIULio GARVINI, the
famous publicist and editor of the
Tromba della Sera. Signor GARVINI as
an unparalleled exponent of the lingua
Toscana is naturally much favoured by
the Tosks, but the Ghegs, the other
great Albanian tribe, regard him with
undisguised hostility. It is believed,
however, that he will conciliate them in
the masterly manifesto which he has
issued in seventeen successive issues
of his paper, and which GABRIELE
D'ANNUNzio has hailed as the supreme
emanation of cosmic pluriloquence.
The policy outlined in the manifesto
includes, (1) compulsory use of the
fustanella, (2) free instruction in the
cornamusa or bagpipes, (3) compulsory
signature of all leading articles,
(4) abolition of the dramatic censor. .
ship, (5) universal use of italic type.
Another formidable candidate, indeed
in some ways the most formidable of
all, is Sir GILBERT PARKER. Inter-
viewed last Saturday by a represen-
tative of The Prizrend Gazette, Sir
GILBERT is reported to have said that
he would cheerfully accept the responsi-
bilities of founding a Gilbertian dynasty.
provided he could count on the loyal
co-operation of his varied subjects. He
pointed out as a curious presentiment
of the position he was destined to fill:
that he wrote The Seats of the Mighty
no fewer than fifteen years ago. As
for his other qualifications he laid stress
on his early travels in the South Sea
Islands and his addiction to golf, a
game admirably suited to the climate
and configuration of Albania. A photo-
graph of Sir GILBERT PARKER in the
national costume, carrying a two-handed
battle-axe in his teeth, is being exten-
sively circulated in the blue Albanian
Highlands. -
Lastly there is Sir HERBERT BEER-
BoHM TREE, who bases his claim on
his all-round versatility. In a most
interesting interview with the Parlia-
mentary representative of The Daily
News Sir HERBERT remarked that
from earliest youth he had been a
great admirer of the heroic ScANDERBEG
and had mastered the two Albanian
auxiliary verbs, Kām, “I have,” and
Yām, “I am.” He agreed with HAHN,
the famous philologist, that the term
Shkíipetar, by which the Albanians
call themselves, was probably a parti-
cipial from shkyipoij, “I understand.”
Again, the Albanian language was ex-
tremely vocal, the climate was healthy,
and the sardines of Lake Scutari singu-
larly palatable.
the people, being convinced that they
might soon be mollified once they were
freed from the burden of an alphabet
containing fifty-two letters. Sir HER- |
BERT TREE then sang a little Albanian
song and went through some striking
exercises with a yataghan.

BRYAN's BREACHES.
MR. WILLIAM J. BRYAN's official tee-
total banquets at Washington, at which
nothing but water or unfermented wine
was consumed, have had the effect of
instilling courage into other public
hosts who were previously unready to
make their guests the victims of their
own fads.
Thus news comes from Foxington of
a recent dinner given by the Quaker
mayor of that ancient borough, who
believes that the oats which bear the
name of his pacific sect are the only
proper sustenance for man. Hitherto
when entertaining his fellow-townsmen
the mayor has provided whatever good
things were in season, but last week
nothing but oats was placed on the
table. These, it is true, were prepared
in a great variety of ways, but none
the less the result was somewhat
monotonous, and it is stated that
the suppers that were demolished later
in the evening by the home-returned
guests were Gargantuan.
Consternation reigned at the annual
Hunt Dinner in the Vale of Beedle
the other night when it was discovered
that the new Master, who is a con-
firmed three-bottle man of the old
school, had provided nothing but a
very powerful port for his guests and
had given strict orders that no other
liquid was to be served. Men who were
notorious martyrs to gout and who
looked upon port as a pernicious
poison were seen with their tongues
lolling out, victims of a terrible thirst.
Others, however, made a gallant effort
to absorb the obsolete fluid in the
required quantity and were removed in
ambulances.
Tidings of vegetarian and fruitarian
banquets given by devotees of those
cults also reach us. An especially
distressing case is that of the Inter-
national Society of Wrestlers and
Weight Lifters, who have just appointed
as their President an ex-Hercules of
great wealth who turns out to have
embraced the tenets of Mr. BERNARD
SHAw and Mr. EUSTACE MILEs with
remarkable fervour. The result is
that when the company, numbering
some hundred-and-seventy, including
HACKENschMIDT, MADRALI, and Mr.
SANDow, sat down, there was nothing
for them but nuts, tomatoes, biscuits,
and barley water. A vote was hurriedly
taken, the President deposed, and a
*
united and determined raid was made
on the Beefsteak Club.
But the worst effect of Mr. BRYAN's
relentless Amphitryoniclogic is reported
from Walls, in Yorkshire, where a Free-
mason, upon whom fell the duty of
entertaining a body of his fellows in
that mystery, confined the repast to a
menu costing only fifteen-pence a head,
that being, he said, the sum beyond
which his conscience could not allow
him to go. No man, he affirmed, ought
to spend more than that on any meal;
to do so was “sinful luxury and
gourmandising.” When remonstrated
with, he said that his conscience was
his master and Mr. BRYAN was an
excellent example:THow such a man
ever became a Mason is the puzzle;
but his determination in the matter
has given a tremendous fillip to avarice
all over the East Riding.

THE HERO OF THE HOUR.
(An attempt to introduce a new style of cricket-reporting, suitable to an age where every effort has to be made to revive
popular interest in the County tournament.)

Honour the idols of the blade and pill;

Of takings at the till.
Cricket, you know, is dead because the batter
Will stick his leg in front of breaking balls;
Save for a few staunch souls (and these may

The despots, not the thralls.

As Surrey ever had, yet spite his chaff

Straight from his tram he sauntered to the wicket,
I should say turnstile. Little did he care
For shibboleths of style; he came for cricket.
His light-blue optics had the sea-dog's stare;
Weather deters some sportsmen—Alf could stick it
Frowning alike and fair.
Fond of his glass, too, yet no feckless lover,
Lest deep potations should impair his thought;
He liked the huge hit hovering like a plover,
The stumps knocked out; and when the strain
was taut
Never a bumpball flew to slips or cover
But Alfred cried, “Well caught !”
And many a tale he had of old-time hitting
By long dead heroes of a doughtier bat:
Officials at the entrance smiled, admitting
The well-known figure, now a trifle fat
(But tough and stalwart still) from years of sitting,
Topped by the brown straw hat.
And now shall Alfred leave us? Not if twaddle
Tuned to the motley lyre can keep him warm ;
He is the happy warrior, he can swaddle

It is admirable, unique. You say,
“No, no.” I reply, “Yes, yes.” Both
of us have the inner feeling that I am
the more accurate. So much, Sir, for
the amenities.
I have now to approach your good
self upon a matter of business. Cer-
tain of us upon the Continent are
intending to make a military display of
some realism and magnitude in this

of us invaders may be in jeopardy, or
at least we must be subjected to con-
siderable annoyance and grave incon-
venience, unless we have the protection
of your Scotland Yard. It is for that
I am instructed to ask.
I venture to enclose a plan, showing
our proposed route of triumph, the
spots marked in red being the suggested
sites for the more impressive turns of
our programme. May I ask that this
route be adequately patrolled by your

SPEEDING UP.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-My attention,
as they say, has been called to an
interview in which a “director of a
West End shop" has imparted to the
Press his views upon the question of
stealing from shops. It seems that “a
prominent draper” has made a list
of some of the tricks of the shop-lifter
by way of showing his remarkable
ingenuity. Now, Sir, this sort of thing
cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.
As a successful shop-lifter of fully thirty
years' experience, perhaps I may be
allowed a few words of criticism. For
really the methods here referred to,
although some of them may have been
!practised at one time by the trade,
are no longer employed by any self-
; respecting member of the profession.
They are obsolete, worked-out, perhaps
I may say mid-Victorian. He speaks
of a “bag which sucks up the desired
article when placed upon it,” of “paste
in the hollow of the foot.” (placed, I
presume, on the counter), and so on.
Possibly such devices may still linger
in out-of-the-way corners of the
| Provinces, but I doubt it. Then he
, revives again—it came back to me as
a welcome memory of my very earliest
'apprenticeship—the worn old expedient
of the pet dog (with a pocket in its
collar) which has been trained to make
for home as soon as its burden has been
secreted. Well, well ! we cannot afford
to stand still in our business, and
methods have advanced a good long
way since those old days.
It was when some of our big stores
first opened roof-garden restaurants
that the carrier pigeon came into
vogue. One makes him swallow
diamonds and then lets him loose during
lunch. I have also employed white
mice. One of their best characteristics
is their faculty for running under
counters and into the back recesses of
shelves, and I have seen them trot up
my leg into my pocket with a five-
pound note or a gold pin in their
mouths quite unobserved (one wears,
of course, white trousers). There was
a pal, I mean a colleague, of mine who
used to dip their feet in bird-lime and
then make them potter about among
the jewellery. But that was a sticky
business at the best.
The fountain pen with a powerful
magnet in the nib was much used at
one time. You had only to lay it down
casually on the counter and it collected
things. And a little automatic trap
in the point of the elbow, which one
rested casually against the article
desired, had a fair run of success.
Then I used to employ at one time
a sort of lasso of invisible silk for
gathering in pianolas. . . .
I am not, it must be understood, the
wish the public to know that we are
not so miserably lacking in initiative as
this interview would seem to suggest.
As a matter of fact these methods also
are obsolete. I myself am working on a
new plan, still more elaborate perhaps,
but wonderfully effective. I simply
select the article that I want to take
home, pick it up when no one is
looking, and put it in my pocket.
I am, dear Mr. Punch,

AT THE PLAY.
“THE SEVEN SISTERs."
IT takes the liberty of calling itself
a “comedy,” by the same licence that
they use at the Gaiety. It is in fact a
musical comedy with the music mostly
away—a loss for which the absence of
a chorus makes full compensation. It
differs, too, from musical comedy by
the fact that the plot is actually
intelligible. This is not to say that it
is also reasonable; indeed, of the three
ruses employed by Count Horkoy to
achieve the marriage of the three eldest
daughters of Widow Gyurkovics, so as
to clear the way for his own wedlock
| with the fourth, two at least were a
waste of ingenuity, since the lovers
needed no pressure. But it was some-
thing to see what the author was
driving at, even if his trick of creating
difficulties for the sake of overcoming
them was frankly transparent.
The scene is Hungary where the bands
come from. As for local colour, it is not
for me, or the Censor, to complain of
the spectacle of a Colonel of Hun-
garian Hussars who gets drunk at a
fancy - dress ball and introduces a
| Lieutenant of Reserves (in the same
| condition) into the dormitory of his
four or five sisters-in-law in the middle
of the night; for both the author
and translator of the play (presumably
designed for local consumption) are
Hungarians, and between them they
should know what is expected of native

i behaviour.

That good actor, Mr. NorMAN TREvoR
(to whose excursion into management
I heartily wish success), was a sound
master of the ceremonies, and kept
things going whenever he was there to
look after them. But the most arresting
figure was Miss LAURA CowIE as the
fourth sister, a remarkable flapper of
sixteen-and-a-half years, whose exotic
beauty must have distinguished her
even among the storied belles of Buda-
Pesth. As she was required by her
mother to dress and behave like a child
of thirteen-and-a-half (so as not to
stand in the way of her elder sisters'
prospects), one looked for a certain
amount of sophistication. But it was
overdone. For all her girlish agility,
the innocent wonder in her big eyes,
and her length of visible stocking, this
Mici was a very precocious young per-
son, well advanced into the age of indis-
cretion. But if Miss Cowie could not
completely disguise her own striking
personality it was still a clever perform-
ance. Perhaps she was at her best
when her quick brain went into her
feet in a charming Hungarian measure,
which she danced with the greatest verve,
It was rather sad to see Mr. EDMUND
MAURICE playing a fire-eating, dram-
drinking, jealous old Colonel of farce,
after his recent performances in serious
drama, but his fine intelligence gave
distinction to a commonplace part.
Mr. SAM SoTHERN, as a blackguard
who in his moments of insobriety
strongly resented blackguardly conduct
in another, was very amusing in the
trappings of a Roman lictor, and might

gladdest eye in all Savoy-Hungary 1”
have done great execution with his
axe upon the timorous Caeur-de-Lion
of Mr. THESIGER if his deeds had been
as big as his words. By aid of a
pleasant stammer Mr. THESIGER con-
trived to sustain the part of an amorous
and Toots-like youth of no particular
consequence.
For a family of sisters so prone to
marriage it was difficult to find an
ineligible; yet there was one such in
the person of Toni, a sort of village
idiot, played with extraordinary facial
probability by Mr. BERTRAM STEER,
though his accent seemed to suggest
that he had “coom from Sheffield.”
Finally, Miss MARY RoRKE, as the
mother of many dowerless daughters,
handled her offspring with a fine sense
of maternal obligations.
Indeed, all the cast did its duty
well; and yet I cannot honestly say
that the piece went with a roar, as

people do at amateur theatricals; but I
doubt if there was a strained midriff
in the whole house. It was not that
the fun was bad; only that it was mild
and that there was scarcely enough of
it. In these respects the play reminded
us of WoRDsworth's We are Seven ;
but there the similarity ended, and,
with the best will in the world, I
cannot predict that the popularity of
Mr. TREvoR's production will ever
come into serious rivalry with that

of course has no bearing on current
politics, is a gifted young lady, the
daughter of a retired General of Artillery,
who writes under the pen name of
Messalina Murgatroyd, and is considered
by Mr. C. K. Short ER to be our great-
est female novelist since CHARLOTTE

Another political novel of engrossing
interest is The Rival Renegades, which
is promised us shortly by Mr. Hodley
Bedd. The two principal characters
are Colonel Jack, Wise and Churston
Winchill, both of whom have crossed
the floor of the House and obtained
high office shortly after the transference
of their allegiance. Mr. Hodley Bedd,
has put forth, makes it perfectly clear
that the novel cannot in any way be
regarded as a roman à clef, the verbal
resemblances in the names of the chief
characters being due to pure coincidence.
Mr. Hugo Slazenger, the author, has
already a dozen volumes to his credit,
his first work having elicited a cordial
tribute of praise from MEREDITH, PATER,
and Mr. JAMEs Douglas, who pro-
nounced him to be the greatest satirist
since JUVENAL.
A fascinating novel of theatrical life
will shortly be issued through the firm
of Doyly and Mush, entitled Crichton

are entirely imaginary, the chief rôle
being assigned to a wonderfully gifted
actor - manager named Sir Herbert
Shrubb, who late in life loses his speak-
ing voice and goes on the operatic
stage, to the mingled consternation and
delight of the musical public. The

in the opinion of Mr. C. K. ShoBTER,

The heroine of Miss Moira Kiralſy's

of the book is The Greatest Woman
in the World, and the heroine's name
is Coira Miralſy. But we have the
most positive assurances from Mr.
Street that the story is not an auto-
biography, in proof of which assertion
it is enough to mention that Coira is
represented as being twenty-eight years
of age, while Miss Moira Kiralſy has
never been more than twenty-six since
the South African War.

THE action (to which we referred last

forces with Mr. THOMAS BEECHAM to
produce the opera Ariadne in Naros

Thus we have it on the worst
authority that Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER's
forthcoming revival of The Second Mrs.

takes her to a musical comedy. The
composition of this novelty, which will
be given in its entirety, has been
entrusted to fourteen distinguished
specialists, and its production will be
supervised by Mr. GEORGE EdwardEs.

the erection of a Picture Palace. The

CELEBRATED TRIALS.
I.—REx V. MULLINs.
THE prisoner in this case, which was tried yesterday,
before Mr. Justice Welbore, was one Adolphus Mullins, of
Dunkeld Villa, Lavender Grove, Balham. He was charged
on an indictment with that he being a person of full age
had refrained from tendering himself or being accepted as
a witness before the Marconi Committee. Counsel for the
Crown were Sir Horace Biff, K.C., and Mr. Joinder. The
prisoner defended himself.
It appeared from the opening statement of Sir Horace
Biff that the prisoner, whose age was stated to be twenty-
eight, was employed as managing clerk to a firm of ac-
countants, whose names for obvious reasons we prefer to
withhold from publication. He had had ample warning of
the results certain to follow if he continued recalcitrant.
His employers had more than once adjured him not to
imperil a good salary and a respectable position; his friends
had urged him to be a man and get the business over, and
Sir ALBERT SPICER, the Chairman of the Marconi Committee,
had with his own hand addressed to him four notices com-
manding his presence in the Committee-room. It was not
necessary in such cases to send more than two notices, and
it would be seen therefore that prisoner had been treated
with exceptional indulgence. At the present moment there
were only six other cases of a similar nature awaiting trial,
and in five of these the defendants were confidently expected
to make due submission. He mentioned this to show with
what universal alacrity British subjects all over the world
had obeyed the new statute enforcing their attendance before
the Committee. The prisoner was evidently a man of ob-
stinate, he might almost say of Savagely obstinate, character.
It would be proved that he had thrown Sir ALBERT SPICER's
notices into the waste-paper basket, accompanying this
deeply regrettable act with words tending to bring the
Committee into contempt. He had actually been heard to
say that the members of the Committee were busybodies—
Prisoner (interrupting). As a matter of fact I said they
were ——
His Lordship (severely). Hush, prisoner. Do not aggra-
vate the painful position in which you are placed. You
will have an opportunity at a later stage of giving evidence
and of calling witnesses, if such there be, on your own behalf.
Prisoner. Oh, all right. Have it your own way. I only
thought—
His Lordship. What you thought is of no importance.
Cogitationes non debent admitti.
Police Constable Malting was the first witness. On
Thursday, April 17, he went to prisoner's house at Balham
armed with a warrant. Prisoner was having dinner. On
seeing witness he said, “Halloa.” Witness then arrested
him and gave him the usual warning. Prisoner said,
“It's this Marconi rubbish, I suppose. If you can find
my cheque-book you're cleverer than you look.” Witness
then searched the house and found four notices from Sir
ALBERT Spicer in the waste-paper basket. He now pro-
duced them.
Cross-eramined (by Prisoner). Had no grudge against
prisoner. Had never asked prisoner's mother for a pot of
ale. Did not know the lady and didn't want to.
The Prisoner. I protest.
His lordship cautioned the witness. If he did not know
the lady it was impossible for him to say whether he
wanted to know her.
At this point a woman sitting in the back of the court
and understood to be the prisoner's mother called out that
the constable was no gentleman. She was removed kissing
her hand to the judge.
Witness, continuing, said he had tendered himself as a
witness to the Marconi Committee. All the members of
the Metropolitan Police had done the same. Did not know
when he would be called. Perhaps in two or three years.
His Lordship. It is useless to pursue this line of cross-
examination. The witness has only done his duty as an
Englishman under the statute. -
Other witnesses proved that the prisoner had habitually
abused the Marconi Committee, going so far as to say that
the whole thing was a nuisance. He had also concealed
his cheque-book and pass-book, thus contravening section 10
of the statute. -
The Prisoner called no witnesses, but went into the box
and made a long and rambling statement in the course of
which he appealed to Magna Charta and the Petition of
Right. He also hinted that his lordship himself had not
given evidence before the Committee or tendered himself
as a witness.
His Lordship. I am excepted in the schedule which
applies to Lunatics, Field Marshals, Admirals of the Fleet,
Judges of the High Court and persons of no fixed habitation.
The Prisoner then said that he didn't know what English-
men were coming to and, leaving the witness-box, resumed
his place in the dock. º
His lordship in a brief summing-up reviewed the evidence,
and the jury, without leaving the box, returned a verdict of
Guilty on all the counts.
His lordship, speaking with evident emotion, said the
prisoner had had a thoroughly fair and impartial trial. The
jury could not consistently with their oath have returned
any other verdict. This kind of conduct must be put a
stop to. The sentence of the Court was that the prisoner
be condemned to ten years' service as assistant secre-
tary to the Marconi Committee, to be followed by three
years' detention in a wireless signal station in one of
the Falkland Islands.
THE CULT OF THE REALLY HEROIC.
WHEN I was plucked and my unbending sire
Showed me the door without a grain of pity,
I wrote some verses on paternal ire
Which, I am proud to think, were very witty;
And thanks to this, the last of all his wiggings,
Managed to pay my first week's rent in diggings.
I did not falter when my dove, my dear,
Refused me, and my heart was knocked to flinders;
I piled the pieces over Cupid's bier
And raised some sort of Phoenix from the cinders—
A bilious Bird of Humour, rather skinny;
But, anyway, it brought me in a guinea.
And when my stuff recoiled upon my head
In dark profusion, pretty nearly blighting
My best endeavours after daily bread,
I cursed my gods—but put the curse in writing:
Stanza by stanza turned my bitter burden
To some gay jest, hoping to gain some guerdon,
And now, O merry Muse! when downright ill,
Supine beneath the influenza demon,
I tell you I foresee a doctor's bill,
We can't give way, we've got to put some steam on ;
Fortes pejoraque passi—we've been through more
Troubles than this. Come, turn the thing to humour !

THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST SHOP-LIFTERS.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I soleMNLY accuse Mr. MAURICE HEwlETT of obtaining
sympathy under false pretences. This is my case. There
are few things that make a stronger appeal to me than
studies of the mystic, of strange visions, and of glimpses of
half-human dwellers by wood and hill. And as no writer
can treat these with a surer touch than Mr. HEwleTT, I
exulted greatly to find them within the covers of Lore of
Proserpine (MACMILLAN). Moreover, they were combined
with yet another favourite theme of mine—the memories of
lonely and introspective childhood. I may say at once that
several of the essays, or stories, in the book were all that
my anticipation had painted them. I liked, for example,
“The Boy in the Wood”—in spite of some hateful detail—
for its quality of honest inexplicability. Also, I shivered
deliciously over the tale of “The Fairy Wife,” with its fine
working up to the shattering climax of the storm. These
things were all excellent. And then suddenly I was faced
with the picture of a crowd of anxious Londoners meeting
at night in Hyde Park to worship a Telegraph Messenger
whose name, supplied by a sympathetic policeman, was
Quidnuncil Here I confess myself baffled. Does Mr.
HEWLETT only intend the somewhat obvious allegory, or is
he being mystical or farcical, or what? The thing, like the
others, is strikingly and cleverly told; the impassioned
appeals from the crowd, the aloofness of the uniformed boy,
are seizable and real. But by so much the more did it, in
NERVOUs BUT ABSOLUTELY INNOCENT CUSTOMER MAKING A FEW PURCHASE8.
this connection, irritate me. A dealer in the occult may
whisper and frown as much as he likes; he may even leer
a little, should the special nature of the horror demand it;
but he must never, never wink. The result is bound to be
confusion and disillusionment.
English political life, as Mr. Ford MADox HUEFFER under-
stands it, is at once too tedious and too sordid for superior
persons to have anything to do with. For this reason
Mr. Blood, a gentleman of great wealth and long pedigree
but no sort of manners, having a mild curiosity to witness
the spectacle of a meteoric Parliamentary career, naturally
| chose some viler body than his own for the experiment.
Mr. Fleight (HowARD LATIMER) was a millionaire soap
boiler of Semitic extraction who had taken a good University
degree but was apparently unable to soar without the in-
fluence of Mr. Blood to pilot him. Accepting this curious
aeronautical convention, I confess that for a great many
pages of Mr. HUEFFER's latest book I thought that I was
in for the best piece of farcical satire that has been written
since Mr. Clutterbuck's Election. Later on, however, we
seemed to strike an air pocket, or whatever it is that aviators
do. For surely Mr. Fleight, if he was to justify the
rapidity of his start, should have become at the very least
a Cabinet Minister. Yet at the end of the novel he has
only just, and that by a lucky accident, attained to the
dignity of an M.P. What is that for a millionaire under
patronage whose pathway is everywhere soaped for him 2 |.
The fact is that Mr. HUEFFER finds himself so much interested
in his scornful and amusing criticism of our habits, our
politics and our Press that the fun and the movement of the
plot are compelled to suffer for it. But there is a great deal
of happy burlesque scattered about in Mr. Fleight, and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[MAY 21, 1913.
there are some very jolly characters. Especially do I like
Miss Macphail, the German editress of The Halfpenny
Weekly, and Cluny Macpherson, the poet, who goes about
reciting his sonnets and making in a high-pitched voice
such remarks as this: “I knew a nasty fellow called Doe,
whose aunt always toasted the late Queen in China tea,
and she had a sister who bred Newfoundlands.” There
was, in fact, a lot to laugh at before we planed down,
but exactly what it was all about please don't ask me. I
am still in the air as to that.
Any book about life on the other side of the bridges that
comes with the explicit recommendation of Mr. ALEXANDER
PATERSON will show the fine qualities of sincerity and
reality, for he speaks as one having the authority of know-
ledge and not as many scribes with an equipment of
imaginative theories. He has written a characteristic
preface to Halfpenny Alley (SMITH, ELDER), by MARIORY
HARDCASTLE, a nurse whose pictures of the folk to whom
she has ministered have been cleverly worked up from the
uncles, aunts, cousins, ultimately (and most happily) fathers
—rush at him, scream at him, pinch him, kiss him, dress
him, undress him, applaud him, abuse him. From the
tumult emerges at last the consciousness that Antoine is
ill; the babel is silenced; for the sake of his health he is
conveyed to bracing wildernesses, and the six hundred pages
are at an end. Then, if the reader has had the courage
demanded of him, incidents and figures do emerge. A grand-
father, a composer, a doctor—all, for their very haphazard
appearances, amazingly lifelike. But the virtues of Miss
SIDGwick's method are to be best observed in retrospect.
The Laurensons (CoNSTABLE) leaves me unenvious of the
girl who is adopted into a large family of distant and male
cousins, for apparently she will want to marry two or three
of them, and the same number will want to marry her, and
the end will be confusion. Alice, of course, put her money
on the wrong Laurenson (Clive by name), not knowing that
he had a natural gift for bolting. He left her on the very
day of the wedding, and the main interest of the story lies
notes of her diary. She
has the power of visua-
lising and vitalising the
characters which she has
observed with the preci-
sion of a perfect sym-
pathy and a real affec-
tion, and has many
touching things to say
of the kindliness and
courage of the alley
dwellers. A sort of forced
optimism, if I may so
call it, seems to colour
the outlook both of the
author and of the writer
of the preface. I think
it must be a protective
device assumed against
despair in the discourag-
ing work to which both
have set their hands.
A TEST FOR NUTS.
in the fact that his flight
led him to a Jesuit esta-
blishment. This place,
we are told, is “not
drawn from any com-
munity in the United
Kingdom,” a statement
I find no difficulty in
believing. Clive's trick
of bolting was not, how-
ever, to i. cured by the
Jesuits, for even after he
had taken his vows he
once more took to his
heels. It was this second
bolt rather than the first
that made me very sorry
for Alice, for in the in-
terval she had divorced
him, and when he turned
up again was comfortably
married to his brother.
For on the evidence here
set forth there is but too little cause for optimism. Rather,
a vision of illimitable expense of spirit in a waste of squalor
too horrible for anything but anger or tears. Not all the
humour in the world can really lighten the picture, but it
is splendid to see so brave an attempt to do so.
Miss ETHEL SIDGwick entitles her new novel, Succession
(SIDGWICK AND JACKSON), a “biographical fragment,” and
as this “fragment” consists of nearly six hundred very
closely printed pages her ideas of a novel of proper length
must be Chinese. Here, in this sequel to Promise, she
displays a fine and most excellent courage, but she also
demands courage of her reader. Her method of explana-
tion and illustration reveals itself as the most accurate
report of what is, to the innocent reader, unimportant dia-
logue, and this dialogue throughout the six hundred pages
flows about the small person of Antoine Edgell, musical
genius, sometimes engulfs him altogether, sometimes recedes,
leaving him high and dry and pitifully scared. To the
reader it is as though Miss Sidgwick had suddenly opened
a door upon an exceedingly noisy family of mixed nation-
ality. There the family are—bewildering, hasty, irritable,
real as anything, but needing most certainly some sort of
explanatory footnotes. But footnotes are not for Miss
SIDGWICK. Antoine is a genius whose physical strength
gives way again and again, whilst the family—grandfathers,
Having saved Clive from
the Jesuits, Mr. R. K. WEEKEs is content to leave him;
but I think that he should (for Alice's sake) have seen
him through just one more bolt. The book is very well
written and can be recommended to those who are not likely
to find offence in its religious point of view.
It is a curious thing that when publishers print on the
paper wrapper of a novel a little paragraph summarising
its contents they should so often draw attention to features
which on investigation prove not very attractive, and say
nothing about those which are. Thus it is claimed for Miss
JEAN WEBSTER's Daddy Long-Legs that it has a “dramatic
and altogether unexpected" ending, and I can only say
that if Messrs. HoDDER AND STOUGHTON did not foresee the
finish half-way through they can't be nearly as intelligent
as I am. No hint is given of the really good part of the
book. Fortunately for me, my interest did not depend on
|any attempt at mystification, but on the intimate description
of an American girls' college.
I fancy that a good many
of us know very little about this quite attractive phase of
American life, and I am sure that Miss WEBSTER’s charming
picture of it would have gained more admirers if the para-
graph on the cover had said something about it. I can
only hope that Miss WEBSTER has plenty of readers who
know her too well to be dependent on information conveyed
by a wrapper.

THE MYSTERY OF GORDON SQUARE.
SYNopsis of PREvious CHAPTERs.
Roger DANGERFIELD, the famous
barrister, is passing through Gordon
Square one December night when he
suddenly comes across the dead body
of a man of about forty years. To his
horror he recognises it to be that of his
friend, Sir Eustace Butt, M.P., who
has been stabbed in seven places. Much
perturbed by the incident, Roger goes
home and decides to lead a new life.
Hitherto he had been notorious in the
London clubs for his luxurious habits,
but now he rises at 7.30 every morning
and breathes evenly through the nose
for five minutes before dressing. f
After three weeks of the breathing
exercise, Roger adds a few simple
lunges to his morning drill. Detective-
Inspector Frenchard tells him that he
has a clue to the death of Sir Eustace,
but that the murderer is still at large.
Roger sells his London house and
takes a cottage in the country, where
he practises the simple life. He is
now lunging ten times to the right, ten
times to the left and ten times back-
wards every morning, besides breathing
lightly through the nose during his
bath.” : t: , • * : * ~ * :
One day he meets a Yogi, who tells
him that if he desires to track the
murderer down he must learn concentra-
tion. He suggests that Roger should
start by concentrating on the word
“wardrobe,” and then leaves this story
and goes back to India. Roger sells
his house in the country and comes
back to town, where he concentrates
for half-an-hour daily on the word
“wardrobe"; besides, of course, perse-
vering with his breathing and lunging
exercises. After a heavy morning's
drill he is passing through Gordon
Square when he comes across the body
of his old friend, Sir Joshua Tubbs,
M.P., who has been stabbed nine times.
Roger returns home quickly, and de-
cides to practise breathing through the
Cal's. - : ,
CHAPTER XCI.
Preparation. -
The appalling death of Sir Joshua
Tubbs, M.P., following so closely upon
that of Sir Eustace Butt, M.P., meant
the beginning of a new life for Roger.
His morning drill now took the follow-
ing form:—
On rising at 7.30 A.M. he sipped a
glass of distilled water, at the same
time concentrating on the word “ward-
robe.” This lasted for ten minutes,
after which he stood before the open
window for five minutes, breathing
alternately through the right ear and
the left. A vigorous series of lunges
followed, together with the simple
kicking exercises detailed in Chapter
LIV. ,
These over, there was a brief interval
of rest, during which our hero, breathing
heavily through the back of his neck,
concentrated on the word “dough-nut.”
Refreshed by the mental discipline,
he rose and stood lightly on the ball of
his left foot, at the same time massag-
ing himself vigorously between the
shoulders with his right. After five
minutes of this he would rest again,
lying motionless except for a circular
movement of the ears. A cold bath, a
brisk rub down and another glass of
distilled water, completed the morning
training.
But it is time we got on with the
story. The murder of Sir Joshua Tubbs,
M.P., had sent a thrill of horror through
England, and hundreds of people wrote
indignant letters to the Press, blaming
the police for their neglect to discover
the T assassin. Detective - Inspector
Frenchard, however, was hard at work,
and he was inspired by the knowledge
that he could always rely upon the
assistance of Roger Dangerfield, the
famous barrister, who had sworn to
track the murderer down.
To prepare himself for the forth-
coming struggle Roger decided, one
sunny day in June, to give up the meat
diet upon which he had relied so long,
and to devote himself entirely to a
vegetable régime. With that thorough-
ness which was now becoming a
characteristic of him, he left London
and returned to the country, with the
intention of making a study of food
values. -
1 CHAPTER XCII,
Love Comes In.
It was a beautiful day in July, and
the country was looking its best.
Roger rose at 7.30 A.M. and performed
those gentle, health-giving exercises
which have already been described in
previous chapters. On this glorious
morning, however, he added a simple
exercise for the elbows to his customary
ones, and went down to his breakfast
as hungry as the proverbial hunter. A
substantial meal of five dried beans
and a stewed nut awaited him in the
fine oak-panelled library; and, as he
did ample justice to the banquet, his
thoughts went back to the terrible days
when he lived the luxurious meat-eating
life of the ordinary man-about-town; to
the evening when he discovered the
body of Sir Eustace Butt, M.P., and
swore to bring the assassin to ven-
geance; to the day when
Suddenly herealised that his thoughts
were wandering. With iron will he
controlled them and concentrated fixedly
on the word “dough-nut" for twelve
minutes. Greatly refreshed he rose
and strode out into the sun.
At the door of his cottage a girl was
standing. She was extremely beautiful,
and Roger's heart would have jumped
if he had not had that organ (thanks to
Twisting Exercise 23) under perfect
control.
“Is this the way to Denfield 2 " she
asked.
“Straight on,” said Roger.
He returned to his cottage, breathing
heavily through his ears.
CHAPTER XCIII.
Another Surprise.
Six months went by, and the mur-
derer of Sir Joshua Tubbs, M.P., and Sir
Eustace Butt, M.P., still remained at
large. Roger had sold his cottage in
the country and was now in London,
performing his exercises with regularity,
concentrating daily upon the swords
“wardrobe,” “dough-nut,” and “wasp,”
and living entirely upon proteids.
One day he had the idea that he
would s'art a restaurant in the East-
End for the sale of meatless foods.
This would bring him in touch with
the lower classes, among whom he
expected to find the assassin of his two
oldest friends. . . . . .
In less than a year the shop was a
tremendous success. In spite of this,
however, Roger did not neglect his
exercises; taking particular care to keep
the toes well turned in when lunging
ten times backwards. (Erercise 17.)
Once, to his joy, the girl whom he had
first met outside his country-cottage
came in and had her simple lunch of
Smilopat (ninepence the dab) at his
shop. That evening he lunged twelve
times to the right instead of ten.
One day business had taken Roger
to the West-End. As he was returning
home at midnight through Gordon
Square, he suddenly stopped and stag-
gered back.
A body lay on the ground before him!
Hastily turning it over upon its face,
Roger gave a cry of horror.
It was Detective-Inspector French-
ard! Stabbed in eleven places !
Roger hurried madly home, and de-
vised an entirely new set of exercises
for his morning drill. A full description
of these, however, must be reserved for
another chapter.

UNREST IN THE CRICKET
FIELD.
THE prevailing spirit of unrest in
cricketing circles bids fair to be exas-
perated by the new controversy as to
whether the left-hand batsman should
be barred. Personally I am against all
this barring business. Once we start
barring things in cricket we shall never
know whether we are playing under the
“Marquess of Queensberry” or the
“Billiard Control” rules. And what
about the ambidextrous man?
If the Wopplestone Wanderers had
short-slip if I had been left-handed)
had not interposed his knee. For a
moment it looked as though the peculiar
arrangement of the field had lost me
four runs. It was all right, however,
as we had the presence of mind to run
four whilst the fielders were trying to
find out if the man's leg was broken.
When they got him into the pavilion
the doctor confirmed my view that there
was nothing quite broken and that the
man was making an unnecessary fuss.
The Wopplestone peopleseemed to think
that I had done it on purpose, though
I explained that I had no idea that he
I need not describe our innings in
detail. Their slow bowler never found
his length, if he ever had one, and the
fast bowler refused to get off the
pavilion table. The change bowlers
were not on the day worthy of the
name of bowlers. The whole side
seemed upset. Brockletops and I did
pretty well what we liked.
When we had made 215 for 3 wickets
I declared the innings closed. Brockle-
tops had the satisfaction of being not
out. Whatever Brockletops says, I
am ready to swear that I did not know
that his score was then exactly 99.
been certain whether I was
left-handed or right-handed
the annual contest between
that club and Murkytown
might not have been dis-
continued. I do not believe
that all the unpleasantness
was due to my idea of
bowling fast “full tosses”
at the top of the stumps.
I captained the Murky-
town team. I had been
trying my full toss theory
at the nets. Our regular
Captain was batting at the
moment and did not recover
in time for the Wopplestone
match. I won the toss and
exercised a captain's privi-
lege of going in first.
I never stated that I was
a left-handed batsman. If,
because I took guard like
a left - handed batsman,
the Wopplestone Captain
jumped to the conclusion
that I was going to bat
left-handed and placed his
field accordingly, I cannot
see that I was to blame.
There is no rule as to how
a batsman must take guard.
I need not have taken
guard at all. Nor, so far as .
Hº!
A FIGURE OF SPEECH.
“CoME on, SAM ; we 'RE GoING 'oME. DRAw stumps.”
Anyhow, I disapprove of
making a fetish of centuries.
Ninety-nine runs are very
nearly , as useful as a
hundred. Even, if another
- |run would have entitled
|Brockletops to receive a
| bat I think that club
Nº cricket should be played in
a strictly amateur spirit.
: Although I am in favour
of reasonable reforms I am
not so self-opinionated as
to depart unnecessarily
from ancient tradition. I
accordingly again exercised
the prerogative of my office
|and started the bowling. I
exploited my full toss
theory. I do not think
that I was in any way to
blame because the first ball
did not swerve in the air
quite so much as I expected
it to do. Anyway I was
not responsible for the fact
that the first batsmen was
a short fat man, nor
that he presented the full
breadth of his anatomy
to the ball. All said and
done, it only hit him in the
wind. In the most sports-
man-like manner I offered
I am aware, is there any rule that an
ambidextrous man must declare whether
he will bat left-handed or right-handed.
As a matter of fact I am really right-
handed, but no bigot, on the matter.
I can both bat and bowl fairly well
left-handed.
The Wopplestone slow bowler started
trundling to me. I could not be ex-
pected to know that my turning round
just as he reached the wicket would put
him off. I do not believe that it was my
action that caused him to bowl a slow
full pitch. I daresay that I should
have hit it just as hard as I did if I had
played it left-handed. It is true that
in that case it would have been to the
off instead of to leg. The ball would
easily have gone to the boundary
if short-fine-leg (he would have been
was their champion fast bowler. I also
pointed out what a silly thing it was to
put a man in such a position if they
wanted to use him for anything else,
especially if the other man was going
to bowl slow full tosses to leg.
After that they wanted me to declare
whether I would bat right-handed or
left-handed. I naturally refused. As
they pressed the matter I eventually
said that I expected mostly to bat right-
handed but declined to bind myself.
Just to show that I was not bigoted, I
played the next ball left-handed. The
bowler was still uncertain of his length
and a slow long hop only just missed
short-square-leg's head on its way to
the boundary (he would have been

handed, as they seemed to expect).
to allow him to continue his innings
later on, when he was feeling better;
but he decided to go on feeling ill.
It was entirely the next man's own
fault that my first ball hit him behind
the ear. There was absolutely no
necessity for him to have ducked his
head. I am given to understand that
about three days afterwards, when he
learnt for the first time that he had been
given out l.b.w.., he had a relapse. I
still think that our umpire's decision
on the subject was correct.
If the wicket-keeper had taken the
next ball in his hands instead of on his
instep, I should have accomplished
what would have been a moral hat
trick. Not content with missing what
was, after all, a fairly simple catch, and
so spoiling my bowling analysis, he

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
insisted on going into the pavilion to
bathe his foot. Consequently I was
put to all the bother of finding some-
one else to take his place.
I soon got rid of the man who had
been missed. I slipped in attempting
to bowl an extra fast one, and the bats-
man was completely deceived by the
ball unexpectedly bouncing.
The next man was sillyenough to come
in without batting-gloves. The first time
that I hit him on the fingers settled him.
If a man has not got more sense than
that he ought not to play cricket.
The Captain then came in. This
fellow, besides being no sportsman, was
a coward. He stood about a yard from
the wicket and made stupid chops at
the ball. He was lucky enough by this
unorthodox method to deflect the ball
several times through the slips.
We might have had quite a difficulty
in getting rid of him if I had not had
the resource suddenly to bowl the ball
with my left hand. It was not a very
good ball, but the man who said that
it bounced five times was guilty of
exaggeration. The batsman only made
a feeble attempt to play it and was
bowled. He was inclined to be un-
pleasant about it, but could produce no
rule against the bowler's delivering the
ball with either hand without warning.
I still maintain that he had not even a
moral grievance. He might, it is true,
have insisted on taking fresh guard,
but an inch or two one way or the
other can make no difference to a man
who adopts a stance about a yard from
the wicket. He could not follow this
argument, though I spent some time
explaining it to him with diagrams.
After the defeat of their Captain the
rest of the team seemed to lose heart.
As no one else came out to bat, we
allowed a good two minutes a man
before putting the wicket down. I
think that the rest of the side were
rightly entered in the score book “run
out,” except, perhaps, the man who
could not get off the pavilion table.
“Absent, hurt” would no doubt be the
technical description in his case. The
effect, anyway, was the same, as I
suppose that, strictly speaking, I could
not count them in my analysis. It was
absurd that in the circumstances I was
only credited with three wickets. It
was an easy win, and personally I
thoroughly enjoyed the game.
We understand(from his Master of the
Robes) that Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER
hopes to improve upon Mr. ARTHUR
BourcHIER's appearance in Crassus, and
has commissioned from the house of
Rothschild a play for which he has
himself suggested a title: The Trouser-
Craesus.

“No,” said Muriel in her decisive

MORE ACADEMY ENCOURAGE-
MENTS.
(Being a composite plagiarism of some
of “Mr. Punch's " contemporaries.)
A FURTHER visit to the Academy
discovers a few works of merit that
escaped our first notice. Amidst the
clash of simpering portraiture, jejune
“story-tellers,” and trivial idylls of
moor and sea, the jaded eyesight finds
rest and peace in Mr. John Sturdue's
study of still life, The 9.3 taking in Milk
Cams at Redhill, or the same artist's
breezy, yet restrained, treatment of
perspective in The Tube near Dover
Street—a delicate landscape that has
been carelessly hung next to Mr.
Harris Weimber's somewhat fantastic
Ichthyosauria coming down to water:
South Harrow, purchased, we under-
stand, by the District Railway as a
companion to their well-known posters
of the unexplored regions to which they
invite the tourist. -
Despite a topicality better suited to
the cinema than Burlington House,
Mr. Lionel Fraber's Two on a Tower,
depicting a recent affair at the Monu-
ment, has qualities that deserve a more
permanent theme. Mr. Fraber has
indeed approached his subject with a
robustness that makes one almost glad
that no other sense but vision is needed
for the interpretation of this joy day
of Femininity. Another “Suffragette”
picture, wherein the morale of this cause
is strongly portrayed, is Mr. Frank H.
Burnish's The Militant's Home. The
sternest opponent of the wider utility
of women will feel some twinges of
conscience before this grim interior,
with the unwashed crockery and un-
kempt children. The despair of the
husband is however sufficiently obvious
without the rather glaring label for
Timbuctoo on the trunk that he is
packing.
Those of our younger artists who
fritter their talents on endless and
depressing replicas of fishing vessels
and other subjects “en plein air" are
earnestly recommended to study Miss
Barbara Fellhurst's great canvas,
brooding over Room IV. with its note
of the Tragedy that is eternal. No-
body, until they have seen this Last of
the Hundred Dozen —the Sandhurst
Tuck-shop at Curfew, would believe that
a mere bun, waiting for its end, could
be invested with such stoical dignity.
Looking at that quiet figure, touched
with some purple of the sunset that is
its first and last, one feels that not in
vain have its oven-mates gone down.
Miss Fellhurst uses no cheap device
of the stricken field; she harrows us
with no horrors of war. But somehow
she tells us that there is internal discord
among the gallant cadets. Two of them
only advance upon that lonely figure
—the last of the buns. The artist has
shown us a problem as old as the hills,
appetite against repletion—and she
leaves us to guess where the victory
lies.
AN ANGLO-FRENCII MIS-
UNDERSTANDING.
EDMUND is a thoroughly good sort,
but oh, so shy. The least little thing
suffuses him with embarrassment; the
most imaginary prominence confounds
him. Some day I suppose he will get
married by proxy after an engagement
by special licence. There can hardly
be a more bashful man in all London.
Well, one day lately, when I was
going out of town, Edmund came into
a post-office with me. It is a large
office with, I should say, a valuable
good-will, but it is not one of your
hurried City places. The oligarchs
behind the counter are dignified and
discriminating. You are scanned and
passed for probity, and tastefully-
printed stamps are presented to you
(you know the way) as certificates of

I went over to the bustard-holes and
wrote a telegram. “Edmund,” said I,
“will you hand this in while I write
some more ? Ask her if it matters its
being in French. Here's a bob.”
Edmund took it. I heard him ask
and I heard the reply—“French is
admissible.” Edmund, delighted to be
in order, flicked the form under the
rails, quite briskly and audaciously for
him, without reading it.
The young woman examined it and
immediately shot an outraged look upon
Edmund. He began to blush; I knew
he was wishing he had glanced at it
first. “Oh, can I–er—” he said,
“er—perhaps you've not quite got the
French . . . misleading language, I
always think—er—should I? . . .” The
young woman said, “Sir!” and banged
the form over the counter to Edmund
with a stamp. He read it.
It was addressed to my favourite
hotel and I myself find the French of it
excellent and clear. It ran : “Arrive

THE
N. sº fs
DEPOPULATION OF RURAL ENGLAND.
Sir Roger Duplessy, Bart. (came over with the CoNQUEROR). “I see THAT Poor old HUGH R1coch ET HAs BRoREN UP His ESTATE
AND is of F to CANADA.
IN THE COUNTY 2’’
A RIVAL FOR CARUSO.
THE facts and figures bearing on the
| anatomy of Signor CARUso published in
The Daily Mail of May 20 (writes a
musical correspondent) are no doubt
| exceedingly interesting. But the con-
tention that his sound-box represents
| the supreme perſection of structure and
resonance must be resolutely combated
in the interests not merely of truth but
of patriotism. I have just witnessed
the examination of Mr. Chester Huth,
the famous Anglo-Israelitish baritone,
by Dr. Samuel Soper, F.R.C.S., the
illustrious and disinterested laryn-
gologist of Wimpole Street, and have
his permission to publish the memor-
andum in which he embodies the results
of his examination.
Dr. Soper begins by observing that
Mr. Chester Huth's facial angle ap-
proximates more closely to the confor-
mation of the Piltdown skull than that
of any other musician he has ever ex-
amined. “Perhaps the most striking
single feature,” he continues, “is the size
and the elasticity of his cranium. He is
not only markedly prognathous, but his
forehead exhibits the quality of bulbosity
in an extraordinary degree. The occi-
put, the sinciput and the cerebellum
are all equally developed, but, what is
more, they are capable in moments of
emotion of such an amount of dilatation
that he is obliged to wear hats of
different sizes, varying from 6% to 81's.
“The resonance of his cranium again
is altogether abnormal. Struck smartly
with an ivory paper-knife it gives out
a middle C of fine timbre. Another
point is the extraordinary curve of his
nose, which, when measured from the
top of the upper lip to a spot midway
between the eyebrows, is at least half-
an-inch longer than that of the famous
statue of Moses by MICHAEL ANGELo.
This accounts for the superbly nasal
tone which Mr. Chester Huth is able
to elicit in moments of passion.
“Another interesting feature about
this remarkable artist is the unequalled
opulence of his capillary equipment.
The average man has about 15,900 hairs
on his head, but Mr. Chester Huth
has upwards of 30,000. His follicular
system is of an unusually vigorous
kind, and the pigmentation wonder-
fully healthy. Brushed with an elec-
tric brush his hair crackles freely and
gives out a pale-blue flame, at which
a cigarette can be lit or the time be
read on a watch in the dark. This
is a scientific fact which accounts to a
great extent for the magnetic influence
which Mr. Chester Huth exerts on
susceptible audiences of a mattoid
diathesis. His chevelure is fine, silky
MY DEAR MoTHER, Iss'T IT Aw FUL TO REALISE THAT YoU AND I ARE ABsoluteLY THE ONLY PEOPLE LEFT
in texture but extraordinarily strong,
and I am assured that an admirer who
became the fortunate possessor of a
small lock made a cast out of it with
which he landed a 24lb. salmon.
“I see it stated that CARUso merely
by expanding his lungs is able to push
a large Steinway concert grand piano-
forte several inches along the carpet.
On trying a similar experiment with my
6-cylinder 80-h.p. Jones-Joyce Limou-
sine, Mr. Chester Huth shot it a hundred
yards along the kerb, to the conster-
nation of a one-legged crossing-
sweeper, who narrowly escaped death.
“The secret of Chester Huth’s pos-
session of the volume and sonority of
Niagara combined with the penetrating
timbre of the gorilla's higher register
lies, in my opinion, largely in , the
extraordinary beauty of his Eustachian
tube — the passage connecting the
pharynx with the middle ear—which
in his case measures at least a sixteenth-
of-an-inch longer than that of PAGANINI,
who previously held the record.”
It only remains to be added that Mr.
Chester Huth is as generous as he is
gifted, but that Dr. Samuel Soper has
no intention of accepting remuneration
for his task, which he performed for
pure joy of anthropometry and with no
idea that he was advertising the great
baritone.

LATEST FROM THE HIVES.
[Owing to an epidemic in the Somerset
apiaries, we learn from The Pall Mall Gazette,
human bees have to be appointed to carry
pollen for the purposes of cross-fertilization.
Otherwise there would be a shortage of cider
in Somerset this year.]
THE announcement of the employ-
ment of “human bees” in . Somerset
may give relief to the anxious minds of
the cider-manufacturers, but it has
caused consternation in other quarters.
The remarkable intelligence of the bee
has by some subtle means communi-
cated to hives all over the country the
fact of this introduction of blackleg
labour, and these resorts of our most
industrious insect are simply buzzing
with excitement. Naturally there is a
great deal of anger expressed, and
a new and sinister meaning has been
given to the term “beeswax.”
“Down honey-sacks ' " is the cry of
the more ardent agitators. We are
privately informed that in one hive the
honeycomb is being surreptitiously filled
with corrosive acid. Another hive con-
tains distinct signs of an explosion
having taken place, and although no
about there is little doubt that the
Y.H.B.S (Young Hot-headed Bees) are
responsible for this. One hive-keeper,
who has a great reputation for handling
his bees without being stung, was badly
bitten last Sunday while entertaining
a small house-party, from which it is
feared that the gnats are rising in
league with the bees. .
Whatever sympathy we may feel for
the denizens of our apiaries, we feel
still more for M. MAETERLINCK. He,
poor man, is in despair. His publishers
insist that his Life of the Bee, in order
to remain the leading authority on the
subject, must now have an appendix.
“I don't see how I can get this
appendix into less than five volumes,”
he exclaimed pathetically to a friend.
The proprietor of the Somerset hive
desires us to make known that he can
receive no more applications for the
post of drone, as that department was
filled some days ago.

ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE TWO PERFUMEs.
ONCE upon a time there was a
common, and on it a cottage had been
built with a high bank beside it, and
on this bank grew a lilac-tree whose
branches hung very near the path, and
below the lilac was a great mass of
rich brown wall-flowers.
Looking up one afternoon the lilac
saw a wayfarer approaching. I hope
he will notice me and stop, she thought;
for she had but a short time of blossom,
and she knew it, and it gave her
pleasure to be courted and praised.
“There's some one coming,” she
said to the wall-flower. “He looks
rather interesting. I think he'll stop.”
“If he does,” said the wall-flower,
“it will be for you. I've been going
on too long. They're all tired of me
by now.”
“I don't agree with you,” said the
lilac. “I wish I did. This one looks
to me as if he would be keen on both
of us. I tell you he's nice.”
“Let's have a bet,” said the wall-
flower. “I bet you that he pays more
attention to you than to me.”
“Very well,” said the lilac ; “and
I bet he pays more attention to you.
How much 2"
“Two bees,” said the wall-flower.
“Done,” said the lilac as the man
reached them.
He was a middle-aged man, with a
kindly face, and he knelt down by the
wall-flowers and took a long draught
of them.
Immediately his years left him and
he was a boy again. He thought
himself in an old garden. The walls
had toad-flax between the bricks. There
was a tortoise in the greenhouse. The
lawn was very bare where he and his
brothers and sisters played too much
cricket. All along the front of the
house was a bed of wall-flowers, and
in a chair by the window of the dining-
room lay a lady sewing. Every now
and then she looked up and smiled at
the cricketers. “Well hit !” she would
say, or “Well caught !”
Whenever any of them were out
they ran to her for a second and kissed
her—not long enough to interrupt the
game, but just to let her know that she
was the most beautiful and adorable
creature in the world.
The man's eyes filled with tears.

always bring back this scene, and this

| of one man and of one woman”
AT THE PLAY.
“CROESUs.”
“CHARITY,” says M. Rochebrune in
the play, among other less memorable
aphorisms—“Charity, like golf, is a rich
man's game.” And, though I don't
presume to guess who it is that is going
to pay for his fun, I should say that the
production of such a play as Baron
HENRI Dr. Rothschi LD's Craesus was
also a rich man's game. Certainly, with-
out pretending to follow the obscure and
complex litigation of which this comedy
(or was it a tragedy?) has been the
subject, most of us concluded that it was
hardly worth fighting about, and that
it is not likely to live very long after the
temporary effect of its loud advertise-
ment in the courts—unpremeditated, no
doubt—has worn off. “Count no man
happy till he is dead,” was the legend-
ary remark of SoLoN to the original
CROESUs; and perhaps an early demise
will be the happiest ending of the
| chequered career of Croesus II.
“It is easier for a camel to go through
| the eye of a needle than for a rich man
| to enter into the kingdom of Love.
This — for even the demi-momde can
| adapt Scripture for its purpose—was
| the labelled motive, none too fresh, of
the play. But the sympathy which is
claimed by multi-millionaires on the
| plea that they cannot gain affection
| pure from mercenary sentiment is never
| very heartily accorded.

the penalty. In the case of Comte
| Sorbier our sympathy was the more
| grudging because the woman on whom
he lavished his wealth was only his
mistress, and therefore at perfect liberty
to move on, when she chose, into more
entertaining pastures. A vague hope
of reconciliation was held out to us;
for did not Grandval, the Abdiel of the
company, hint that a rich man has not
failed if he can keep the true devotion
IBut
nothing came of it so far as the woman
was concerned. True, she returned
from her escapade, alleging that her
heart had always remained true to her
Sorbier; but she imposed neither on
him nor on us.
Meanwhile Craesus had been harbour-
ing the illusion that by a disguise of
his identity he might rivet to himself
the disinterested affections of a true
woman. Such a treasure he thought
he had discovered, where a less child-
like and confiding nature might never
have looked for it, in the person of a
midinette. The masquerade was very
simple. He just changed into an old
jacket, light overcoat and popular slouch
hat, carefully guarded in a patent safe,
which must, I presume, have been the
chief feature of the scenery which Mr.
Bourch iER was so anxious to retrieve
from the other party in the case. So
we were suddenly transported from the
smartest circles of Parisian fashion into
a boisterous scene of low life in Bohemia,
and never got back again. As the cur-
tain rose upon the last Act, with its
half-dozen or so of perfectly new
characters, I thought there must be
some mistake. I admit that I was a
little dazed by a change in my own
social condition, for by the courtesy
of a friend I found myself admitted to
the dignity of the stalls, after having
had a foreshortened view of the first
two Acts from a free seat in the Upper
Circle.
ſº
º
%-
Sorbier (Mr. ARTHUR BourchIER) setting
out to be loved for himself—not for his hat or
coat.
However, the ultimate appearance of
Craesus made it clear that this Act was
part of the play. A very long dialogue
ensued between him and the midinette
of his choice, from which we learned that
she had been the object of attentions
on the part of a vieux marcheur, who
had offered her his protection and the
luxury of an appartement, which she
innocently proposed to accept without
any idea that the result might be of
a compromising nature. Acting on
this information, Sorbier disclosed his
identity (an obvious dramatic chance
sadly manqué), and paid her off hand-
somely and to her complete satisfaction.
So ended the play on the knell of
another lost illusion, and Baron HENRI
DE Rothschi LD had achieved at least
one of the high purposes of drama—to
purify the heart with pity. For who
could view with dry eyes the poignant
spectacle of a millionaire left for the
moment without a mistress |
Mr. BourcHIER, snatching a brief
respite from the dusty purlieus of the
law, played the part of Sorbier as easily
as if he had just emerged from a rest-
cure. In the lighter passages, especially
in the Second Act, where he dealt tersely
with a variety of beggars, he was ex-
cellent, but did not altogether succeed
in suggesting a figure of romance.
Of Madame GABRIELLE DoRzIAT’s
performance as Marcelle it is difficult
to judge, for she spoke a Gallicised
English. The blend of this with the
native English (Cockney and other)
of the rest of the cast, though in her
case it was unavoidable if she had to
play the part at all, produced the same
effect of absurd incongruity which one
suffers in plays adapted from the
French when some isolated character
adopts broken English for the purpose
of local colour. She played with
vivacity but without any very peculiar
grace. Whether she might have moved
us more if she had let us see her in the
new gown which her milliner brought
for her, none can say, for, after retiring
to try it on, she never appeared in it.
Here again the author raised hopes,
only to dash them to the ground.
From the others we got no very
fresh ideas about Parisian esprit. Mr.
SPENCER TREvoR was perhaps most at
home in his favourite part of a senile
buffoon. In the other section of the
play Miss MARJoRIE WATERLow, as
the over-innocent midinette, did her
best to be nearer nature than the part
allowed, but she was not quite equal to
the strain of so improbable a situation
and so much dialogue to go with it.
I am not sure that little Miss Joyce
Robey (Toto), whose business was to
enjoy her supper at a miniature table
d part, did not do as much justice as any-
body to Baron HENRI DE Rothschild's
design.
How far his play was a personal cri
de capur I am too discreet even to con-
jecture, but I permit myself respectfully
to hope that life has its compensations
for him—compensations unknown to
the ordinary playwright. O. S.
“Wanted, two Bull Terriers, must be well
bred and fond of goats.”—Advt. in “Buenos
Aires Standard.”
Our own bull-terrier simply dotes on
anything with a beard, but, alas! he is
not well bred.

June 15th. –In anticipation of
memorable meeting Barons arrive
early. Bob Fitz replete with new suit
of armour of civilization, whether as a
sign of his leadership or merely to grace
unprecedented occasion not altogether
evident. Quite in accordance with
traditions of House for assembly to
assume almost holiday air, no doubt
due in part to sylvan surroundings of
Runnymede.
“Jolly little spot,” said DE QUINCY,
calmly fishing for a bluebottle lodged in-
side his leader's gorget. “You don't get
bluebottles and buttercups and all that
sort of thing in Westminster Hall.”
Nothing in his bearing, or even in BoB
Fitz's, to indicate imminence of deadly
struggle to resist destruction of Con-
stitution, said struggle, moreover, forced
on Barons during hard-earned Recess
succeeding feudal service.
Temper of assembly somewhat
changed on arrival of OUR John and
commencement of full debate. Still,
Barons tolerably at ease in anticipation
of big majority at division. STEPHEN
CANTUAR appeared in his place at side
of OUR John, but SARK, with accustomed
eagle eye, observed him to greet BoB
Fitz with friendly wink.
Order of day consisted of discussion
of Articles of Barons. As expected,
OUR John declined all debate and con-
fined himself wholly to obstruction,
complaining of “unprecedented effront-
ery of tyrannical majority in com-
pressing debate on matters vital to
constitution to extent of discussing
forty-eight clauses in single sitting.”
BoB FITz, in course of brief reply, re-
ferred to OUR John's refusal to discuss
matter when ample time had been
allowed. Temper of latter not improved
by secession of STEPHEN CANTUAR in
strong speech favouring summary
acceptance of clauses. Debate con-
cluded by Bob Fitz's significant
closure of his vizor. . - - - -

HORS DE COMBAT.
ON the Wednesday I wrote:– “Dear
Marjorie, do you remember the snap
with which my heart broke when, some
five years ago, you told me that, much
as you liked me, you yet intended to
marry Jonathan 2 You don't 2 Nor

and shoot big game? Come, come;
surely you cannot have forgotten my
saying that I would pit my little
strength and cunning against some un-
tamed monster and more than half hoped
that the monster would win 2 This atti-
tude impressed you very favourably at
the time, and you were all for being on
with me again and off with Jonathan
until be said, ‘Don’t you believe about
that monster,' or words to that effect.
Well, to show that I have forgiven you
both, I want you to come and stay the
week-end with me at my hermitage and
be introduced to the monster, which, I
am sorry to say, has lost.—Yours, still
alive but unhappy, Charles.”
On Friday morning I found a letter
| waiting for me, which, with an in-
stinctive thrill, I tore open. “Dear
Sir," it ran, “we beg to give you notice
that your water supply will be cut off
at the main from 9.0 A.M. till noon on
Sunday next.—Yours faithfully, The
Pelborough Waterworks Co.” In the
aſternoon I had a wire from Marjorie
| and Jonathan accepting. -
On the Sunday morning I rose at my
usual time, 8.30, and an hour later was
joined by Marjorie at breakfast. This
| was our first meeting alone since the
Crisis. -
“Cyming straight to the point,” said
I, “do you still think you have the
right man for husband 2"
“I want,” said she, evading the
question, “to see the monster.”
“You have seen it once,” said I, “but

you that there is no more angry and

Marjorie sniffed. “If you mean that
big copper thing in the bathroom . . .”
“I do,” said I. “Have you ever
met one so easily infuriated 2"
“I have never met one at all,” said
she. “In our walk of life such things
do not occur, or, if they do, occur in

should I ?”
It appeared that when Marjorie sees a
tap with HoT on it, it is her custom to
turn it on without setting fire to it,
however much mechanism there may
be behind it. There is something to be
said for this course. True, the result
is a cold bath, but even that is more
comfortable than what happens to you
if you set fire to the mechanism without
first turning on the tap. In the one
case you lose your temper and sulk; in
the other the geyser loses its temper
and bursts.
“And so,” I said, “all's well that
ends well,” and I returned to my sub-
ject, asking her if, now she knew the
way in which we geyser-tamers take
our lives in our hands every morning,
she still persisted in regarding Jonathan
as the better man. To evade the ques-
tion she resorted to one of his beastly
legal phrases. “That,” said she, “is
res judicata.” . . . º
I helped her to a poached egg and
myself to two. “On the contrary,”
said I, “it is now sub judice.” -
“What I meant,” she said, “is that I
have married him, and there is an end
of it.” -
“What I meant,” said I, “is that he
is now being put to the ordeal of fire
and water, and that may be the end of
him.” She looked almost anxious.
“That same geyser which you affect
to despise, having given in to me, is now
testing the intrepidity, strength and
cunning of Jonathan. If he turns on
the water before he turns on the gas, he
will eventually emerge victorious from
the bathroom door and you will live
happily and proudly with him for ever
afterwards. If he lights the gas before
he fills the tank with water, he will pass
out through the window and you will
want another husband. It is quite
exciting for all of us, isn't it 2 " I stuck
my fork into a poached egg by way of
illustrating what was probably hap-
pening to Jonathan at the moment.
“This,” I hissed, “is my r-r-revenge.”
After a pause, “Your difficulty,” said
Marjolie, “is that a fat, round, red face
cannot easily be made to look sinister.”
I smiled at her malevolently. “Don’t
talk so loud,” said I, “we may miss the
explosion."
She rose.
I beckoned her back to her seat.
“Between ourselves,” I said, “there is
a patent arrangement which prevents
you turning on the gas before you
have turned on the water tap."
I declared, “you cannot
“No, why
She sighed and sat down. “I am
glad of that,” she murmured, “for
Jonathan is a good fellow in the
main.”
Thereupon I lost all interest in
Marjorie and poached eggs. “Good
heavens,” I said, leaping up, “I had
forgotten all about the main.”
:: – :k - x: :: , :
The most casual glance into the
bathroom showed that it had been
vacated in a temper. Jonathan I dis-
covered in his bed. -
“I can see your face,” I said, “but
where is the rest of you?”
At this moment Fac Totum (my
menial staff) entered with a tray con-
taining breakfast. Never an emotional
man, he was singularly unmoved at
this juncture.
“You might have guessed,” said I,
“that I should forget all about the
Waterworks.”
“I did, Sir. I took the liberty of
warning Mr. Roper when I called him.”
I looked at Jonathan's face. It was
an exclamation mark.
“And you might have guessed,” I
continued severely, “that he would
forget all about it.”
“I did, Sir. I took the further
liberty of cutting off the gas at the
main also.”

I went down to report to Marjorie.
“It is all over and your husband is in

previously drawn its claws, and later
subdued its fighting spirits by putting
it on a low diet. Jonathan, however,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CELEBRATED TRIALS.
II.-R.Ex. V. PENNYcook. w
This case, which has excited great interest among mem-
bers of the theatrical profession, was brought to a con-
clusion yesterday. The prisoner, it will be remembered, is
a dramatic author. Twelve years ago his play, Courtship
and Courage, was produced at the old Hilarity Theatre and
enjoyed a great measure of success, running for two hundred
nights. After that came A Woman's Heart, which has been
described as the apotheosis of happy domesticity, and this
was followed by Horner's Thumb, which was played to
crowded houses in 1904. In 1905, however, the Act for the
Prevention of Cheerfulness in Theatres was passed and the
prisoner found that the stage had been very properly closed
to such productions as were associated with his name. He
had, it was admitted, signed the statutory declaration
undertaking to refrain from writing anything that might
“tend to produce merriment, smiles, laughter, exultation,
gaiety, happiness, warmth of feeling, friendship, marriage
or family joy"; but he had never loyally accepted the new
conditions and had on more than one occasion been warned
by the inspectors appointed under the Act that his conduct,
if persisted in, would inevitably result in making him
amenable to severe penalties. He had, however, neglected
these well-meant remonstrances, and on March 2nd he
had handed the MS. of a new play, entitled Wedding
Bells, to Mr. Charles Greef, the manager of the New
Depression Theatre, with a view to its acceptance and
production. Mr. Greef had, as in duty bound, given
notice to the police, and the present prosecution was the
result. - º
The chief witness for the Crown was Mr. Alfred Ernest
Dumps, the head of H.M. Bureau of Dramatic Experts.
Mr. Dumps deposed that he had read Wedding Bells care-
fully. In his opinion it constituted a gross infringement of
the Act. To begin with there was no Lancashire scene in
it. This was a very grave matter. Indeed, none of the
characters could be said to belong to a manufacturing
district, nor did they show the least contempt for the
conventional ideas of matrimony. For instance, in Act I.
the Squire's son made love to the daughter of the village
blacksmith, whose physical strength and fits of anger were
insisted on in such a way as to give one some hope of what
might ultimately happen. But it all came to nothing, for
in the next Act, the girl, who had throughout shown a great
distaste for being without marriage lines, allowed herself to
be married to her wealthy adorer at a London registry
office, and in the last Act, in deference to old-fashioned
local scruples, the marriage ceremony was repeated in the
village church. There was thus a double offence. The
second marriage gave rise to what he could only describe
as a scene of perfectly abandoned cheerfulness. There were
slippers and rice in it. The postilion was undoubtedly
a comic character and would produce laughter. The
atmosphere was one of gaiety.
Mr. Justice Sparkles. What does the postilion say?
The Witness. Mostly “Gee-woa” and “Hold up, there.”
He also cracks his whip.
The Judge. I suppose that would make a horse laugh.
(Loud sighs, instantly suppressed.)
His lordship said that this was not a theatre.
was permissible here. (Loud laughter.)
Cross-examined by Mr. Chaffinch, K.C., the witness said
that he had held his present appointment since the Act was
passed. His salary was £5,000 a year in addition to fees.
The business had greatly fallen off, most people having
reconciled themselves to the provisions of the Act. Had
never written a play himself. Might have thought of doing

so when he was young. Could not remember a play named
Lady Jellico's Jewels, stated to have been written by him.
Mr. Chaffinch. I call for its production. - - -
The Witness. It cannot be produced without my leave.
The Judge. The learned counsel wishes it to be produced
in Court, not in a theatre. (Laughter.)
Mr. Chaffinch. This is very serious. -
The Judge. If that is so it will not help you, Mr. Chaffinch.
Mr. Chaffinch. I was alluding to the witness's evidence,
my Lord, not to the alleged play.
The MS. of Lady Jellico's Jewels was brought into Court
under a strong guard and handed to the jury. . .
The witness, continuing, said he now remembered the
play. It was written by his uncle.
Mr. Chaffinch (sternly). I thought we should drag it out Í
of you. - -
Various witnesses were called in the prisoner's defence,
but their evidence merely showed that he was habitually of |
a gloomy and morose disposition.
His Lordship, in summing up, pointed out to the jury
that no evidence worthy of the name had been given to
rebut the very grave charges brought against the prisoner.
What had been said as to the prisoner's disposition was,
unfortunately for him, not to the point. It was well
established that many gloomy men had written mirthful
plays. During the Victorian era it had been observed that
clowns, who were wont on the stage to compel laughter by
means of red-hot pokers and strings of sausages, displayed
extreme melancholy in the privacy of the domestic circle.
Poems had been written on this incongruity. No doubt
the jury had heard of GRIMALDI (loud laughter). The
prisoner might well be a sad fellow (renewed laughter) and
yet write a viciously comical play. They had heard the
evidence of a great expert on the subject of the prisoner's
play, and it was for them to say what they thought about it.
The jury found the prisoner guilty, with aggravating cir-
cumstances, and he was sentenced to a month's confinement
in the stalls of a repertory theatre.
The prisoner declared that he couldn't survive it, and was
then removed in charge of two powerful managers from
Manchester and Glasgow.

REINHARDT STARTED IT, BUT IT DON'T SEEM TO ME DEMOCRATIC.
WHAT'S THE GALLERY DONE THAT IT SHOULD BE
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE was once a man who used to go to a famous
restaurant and dine sumptuously off fine linen and hors
d'acuvres. That is a course which you might take
with Lord MILNER's introduction to The Nation and
the Empire (CoNSTABLE), the collected edition of his
speeches compiled by his friend, Mr. CHARLEs Boyd. If
you treat the book in that fashion you will not go empty
away, for the reasoned declaration of the faith that is
in him is the work of a State's man if ever there was one,
and gives a vivid and complete picture of the new and
true Imperialism. But, if you take a proper pride in the
great little country to which you belong, you should keep
The Nation and the Empire by you, and study with care
the addresses that Lord MILNER has delivered on platforms,
and in places where they debate, in South Africa, Canada,
and the Mother Country. In his devotion to the principles
of Preferential Trade it may seem for the moment as if he
had put his money on the wrong horse. But you never can
tell. If I may express the late HIGH CoMMIssionER for
South
RoBERTs, I should say that the Progressive councillor is not
more anxious than he that the bodies as well as the minds
of children should be the care of the State, nor the Field
Marshal that its young men should be able as well
as willing to guard it with their lives. Besides the
desirability of these two objects the most lively impression
left upon my mind by the study of Lord MILNER's speeches is
the picture of a possible Second Chamber, in which none but
Africa in terms of Sir John BENN and Lord
great questions of Imperial Unity and Imperial Defence
will be discussed by none but Imperially-minded men. At
present we possess two Houses of Parliament, in one of
which Lord MILNER and many others like him cannot sit;
in the other they have practically no legislative power left to
them. Some day, perhaps, we shall change all that. But
meanwhile we are wasting, as these speeches and the whole
of Lord MILNER's public life show, a great deal of good
material. -
If ever I visit the United States (which, without undue
prejudice, I hope to avoid doing) and find myself in any
difficulty, I have quite made up my mind upon the best
course of action. I shall sit down right where I am on the
side-walk, and await the advent of some large and managing
female, homely but with a heart of gold, who will banish
all my troubles and generally play Providence, finishing up,
as like as not, by marrying me to an exquisite heiress. I
base my touching faith in this phenomenon upon a wide
experience of American fiction, where she now appears the
most popular and frequent figure. Her latest embodiment
is as the heroine of Martha By-The-Day (GRANT RICHARDs),
the chronicler of her doings being Miss JULIE M. LIPPMANN.
I hardly think I need tell you the list of these doings,
because you are probably already familiar with them or
their like. Sufficient to say that when Claire Lang, a
young girl, “well-born but friendless” (to quote the cover),
found herself one rainy night on a street-car without so
much as five cents to pay the fare, she gave the first
opportunity in the book to Martha Slawson, the big, kindly
Irish charwoman, who happened to be on the same cº

Martha paid the conductor, rescued Claire from a grasping
landlady, introduced her to her own crowded and strenuous
home—and the rest was plain sailing. To those who like
their stories short, happy, and with lots of molasses, this
may be cordially recommended. To the others, not.
I see that one of my fellow Learned Clerks, reviewing an
earlier novel by Miss SHEILA KAYE-SMITH, said, “If I were to
state exactly the position which I believe this author will
take among the great masters of English fiction, you might
accuse me of exaggeration." After reading Isle of Thorns
| (Constablº) I will commit myself to a similar opinion.
Isle of Thorns is amazingly good. It has all the virtues,
from a swift, dramatic narrative to the occasional humorous
word or line which lightens up the whole page in which it
appears. . The characters are drawn with that apparent
absence of effort which is the conscientious novelist's reward
for hard work. The book reads so easily that I feel sure
that Miss KAYE-SMITH was quite exhausted when she had
finished writing it. From cover to cover it contains not
a slipshod line. The Isle — -

stand why gipsies go about singing, “Oho! ohol ohol ohol"
as they do in what Mr. Baboo Jabberjee would call the
“somewhat musty" ballad of Gipsy John (if my memory
serves me rightly). In their position I should do the same
myself. And yet-surgit amari aliquid—something respect-

said Mrs. Cortelyon to Itaphael, as they chatted over their

Mr. Cortelyon and me don't hold with that. You'd be
surprised, young man, if I was to tell you the sphere we've
moved in and the people we've shaken hands with. Mr.
Cortelyon and I are most particular as to the company
we keeps; we have seen better days.” Isle of Thorns, in
a word, is the book you have been looking for. In the
inspired language of the great republic in which I write
these lines, it has the punch.
In Napoleon Boswell (SMITH, ELDER) Mr. HERBERT
H. MALLEsoN shows plainly an almost insolent familiarity
with gipsy life. He is apt to break suddenly into rich
Romany: “Besh alé jukul.” That is the sort of remark
which Mr. MALLEsoN may make at any moment during
a casual conversation; but dordi / dabla 1 mi duvel ! as we
say in the caravans, it certainly has a fascination, this
site pangs of joy and
terror felt in the pursuit of a very first love or the
execution of a very first shave. The philanderer is
none other than Wee MacGreegor, grown a little older,
a little more intelligible in his speech and perhaps even
a little more charming ; passing from dalliance to
dalliance, and ultimately, in the psychological spasm of
his soul's grande passion, spending penny after ſº. on
frivolous and unuseable lead-pencils in order to occupy and
keep on occupying the attention of the lady behind the

Mr. J. J. BELL's skill in suggesting the character

TO A VERY ORDINARY MAN,
who, having failed to make any impression as a bachelor,
has now secured, in the person of his new wife, a dazed
admirer of his intelligence, and treats hºr accordingly.
Two months of “wedded bliss" had fared
(I use the phrase to custom dear)
Since in those solemn rites I shared
That closed your celibate career,
When, Francis, at your kind request,
I came to eat your mess of pottage,
And brought (unasked) an eye to test
Your scheme of love-birds in a cottage. , 's
Dinner produced the signs I sought: .
Our trio prattled gay and free;.
But when the theme demanded thought
Your best remarks were made to me;
I gathered, though you loved her much
(And love, of course, was all that mattered),
You wished she had a lighter touch
For picking up the pearls you scattered.
You did not patently expose
This private yearning, need I say?
For men conceal their inward woes
And seldom give their wives away;
Indeed, when we discussed apart
... What things to praise and what disparage—
Weather and Edward GREY and Art—
There was no mention made of marriage.
Yet I divined the subtle change. - - --
When mixing with our world of men
Your wit had shown a modest range,
Nor soared above the average ken;
And now you owned—and this was odd–
An audience (guaranteed by Cupid)
That took you for a little god, -
And, in return, you found her stupid! -

She may be so; but that conceit
Comes with a sorry grace from you—
Prom one whose wife salutes his feet - - -
With deference well beyond his due ; -
, Rather be glad her brains are small,
. . . For would she (pardon my acidity)
. Ever have married you at all
-: But for her gift of sweet stupidity ? O. S.
“The complete, well perhaps we had better not say complete, as
we can hardly believe that a change so sudden and unexpected has
been full and complete, but the result of the inquiry on Tuesday
night is a surprise to many people to find that after all ‘We have

Some further hints, on the subject of dress and diet, will
doubtless be appreciated in view of the authority attached
to the experts cited. . . . k
Lord Court.NEY of PEN with writes: “When the shade

Lord MURRAY of ELIBANK, in a supplementary dispatch
from Bogotá, recommends white drill pantaloons, a scarlet

Sir HENRY Howorth lays stress on abstinence from hot

TWO I’AVILIONS AND A CHURCH ! ''
FURTHER GLIMPSES OF CARLYLE.
(Being a hazy memory of Mr. PERCY
FITzgEIRALD's article in “The Com-
temporary Review.")
BEFoRE it is too late let me put on
record my personal recollections of the
Wise Man of Chelsea, for, with the
exception of Mr. FRANK HARRIs, I am
the only one of his intimate friends
that is still here. Between us we
know all. If I am less frank, reader,
forgive me.
Chelsea is no longer what it was.
All, all are gone, the old familiar hats.
In vain does one search its streets for
any of the Titans. We are all pygmies
now—pygmies.
Dear John ForstER, the great and
good, it was he who introduced me to
the Sage. “I send you Percy,” he wrote
to him, “a man you must know.” For
ForsTER always used the imperative
method. CARLYLE's niece was im-
| mensely kind to me, but she broke her
promise. She promised me one of the
Sage's churchwarden pipes, but it never
came. How could it 2 A pipe is an
| impossible thing to pack... And yet is
it 2 because, if so, how did CARLYLE's
own pipes get to him 2
We had all kinds of odd ways
of talking together in our Set. For
example, wishing once to inform the
Sage that I had passed him recently
in the West End, I put it thus: “Sir,
I think I crossed you lately nigh Bond
Street.” As it happened I was mis-
taken, for CARLYLE replied, “No, no,
ye didna. That were my brither—he
not unlike me.” Observe the curious
construction, as of a foreigner learning
English. In his books he could write
grammatically and even well; but in
conversation with his intimates, as you
notice, he suggested Prince Lee Boo.
His Doric was equal to every tax
put upon it. The great and good JoHN
ForstER became in his mouth equally
“Fooster,” “Foosther” and “Foors-
ther.” “My dear Percy,” I remember
ForstER once saying to me in his
hospitable mansion at Palace Gate—so
hospitable that we had to bring our
own cigars—“can't you do anything
with Thomas [CARLYLE] to make him
pronounce my name more consistently 2
It gets on my nerves, and you know
what happens then.” But nothing that
I said to the Sage was of any effect.
“Hech, hech, hech,” was all he would
reply. “Puir wee blitherer! Hech,
hech, hech 1” It was really rather
serious, for the good and great ForsTER
in a state of nerves was something
terrible. All Palace Gate rocked ;
chimneys fell; the rooks in Kensington
Gardens left their trees. Our beloved
BRowNING at last could stand it no
longer, and left the Set. A year or
so later the poet said to me, “Seen
ForsTER” I never see him now,” and
he was gone before I could reply to
the gracious query.
Of ForstER more ought to be known,
for he was great and good. I have
some priceless letters from him. In one
he says— -
The best way to get here is by the omnibus.
In another he draws attention to the
bad weather with a fine touch of vivid- |
neSS-
Isn't the rain terrific 2
But since CARLYLE's name is at the
head of this article I must really pay
more attention to him. “My guid

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
A LUCKY CUT.

DEAREST DAPHNE,-For your special
behoof your Blanche is going to become
an author and tell you a little happen-
ing of the moment as a short story,
strictly based on fact, as people say:—
holding her court. “A great lady, is
she 2. A duchess, and a leader among
the leaders? But not too great a lady
to take my £5,000” (“Mine,” corrected
Mr. Golding-Newman, sotto voce), “and

frightened by her

The opportunity chanced to be quite
handy. A number of well - known

fearful husband of hers in tow. She's
heading straight for you.”
When the Golding-Newman woman
had approached quite close to the group,
Pansy Shropshire turned and bestowed
upon her about the smallest nod of
which a duchess's head is capable,
together with half an inch of her
famous smile, and a cool, careless word
or two of greeting. But neither nod,
smile, nor words of greeting were re-
turned. The pretty face that didn't
matter at all looked steadily, icily,
without the least recognition, at the
pretty face that mattered so much—and
Mrs. Golding-Newman swept past and
mingled in the crowd.
“But what an extraordinary per-
formance, dearest!" said Lady St. Neots
to the duchess. “What does the little
person mean by it?”
Pansy only laughed and shrugged her
shoulders. “How can one say what
she means? The ways of such people
are past finding out.”
“I’ve done it now !” gasped Mrs.
Golding-Newman, as she threw herself
back in her car. “I don't care! It
was worth the £5,000, though I've
killed any tiny chance I may have had
of ever getting into Society 1" But
there she was mistaken.
|
“My sweet thing,” said Veronica
St. Neots to me next day, “I simply
must know this little outside person
who gave dear Pansy Shropshire the
cut direct at the opera last night. You
never saw a cleaner cut, Blanche—quite
to the bone ! Really, you know, it was
rather great. Several of us saw it, and
we all say we must know the little
person. It was positively too funny
for words to see our dear Pansy look
almost quite a little foolish for one small
moment ' "
“How lovely . " I said.
know the little person too!”
And that is how Mrs. Golding-New-
man's social success began. Once more
she is in her box at the opera, but
to-night she's perfectly right. She has
eaten of the fruit of the Mayfair Tree
of Knowledge of What's Done and
What isn't Done. She has learned the
preacher's lesson—that there is a time
to cast stones away and a time to
gather stones together—and put them
on 1 She knows that for an opera less
than three years old, with Trillini
singing, she must wear her very newest
evening gown, with no bodice worth
mentioning, and her all-round tiara,
and her rivière, and her sun and her
stars, and her rope of black pearls, and
“I must
everything that is hers. The little
outside person who gave dear Pansy
Shropshire the cut direct has become
almost quite the fashion, and if you
want her at your parties you must be
some one who counts; and you must
give her pretty long notice too, for she's
asked everywhere and is immensely
particular as to what she accepts' Our
dear Pansy has good-naturedly offered
the little person her congrats on
her success and the coup d'éclat that
led to it that night in the vestibule of
the opera-house. “It was quite a clever
idea of yours,” she said.
So there sits Mrs. Golding-Newman
in her opera-box, and once more it is
the long interval, and Everyone is call-
ing at Everyone's box, and the corridors
swarm with the right kind of people.
But no longer is the Golding-Newman
box unvisited. No, indeed It 's so
full of people who matter that Mr. G.-N.
has hardly room to thrust his hands
into his pockets and yawn, and his
hopes of the box being given up and of
his being able to “swop opera for a
good variety show" have dwindled to
nothing. And that, my dear, is the
true inwardness of why a recent Out-
sider has become an Insider.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.

“WITH IN THE LAW.”
[Without prejudice to a very pleasant enter-
tainment at the Haymarket Theatre.]
ACT I.
Edward Gilder's office at “The Em-
porium.” Sarah, his secretary, is
discovered.
Enter Smithson, a shop-walker.
Smithson. I just looked in to say
how dreadful it was that Margaret
Taylor should be a thief. Ten blouses,
seven petticoats, one-half pair of silk
hose, twenty-nine pairs of
Sarah (hastily). Yes, isn't it sad 2
Such a nice girl, too.
[Erit Smithson. Enter Edward
Gilder and his solicitor, Demarest.
Gilder. Well, so Margaret Taylor is
committed for trial. Excellent.
Demarest. All the same, I can't help
thinking she's innocent.
Gilder. Why?
Demarest. Well—er—she said so . . .
and she's the heroine of the play ... and
what with one thing and another. . .
Gilder (amazed). But the things were
found in her locker! -
Demarest (with superiority). My dear
Gilder, when you've been on the stage
a little longer, you'll know that, the
more innocent a heroine is, the more
things are found in her locker. But
look here, she wants to see you. Will
you bail her out 2 Say the word and
I'll go to the police-court at once and
fetch her here. (Gilder nods reluct-
antly.) Good man' [Erit.
Gilder (to Sarah). Now for a heavy
morning's work. Hullo, who's this?
[Re-enter Demarest with Margaret
Taylor.
Demarest (breathlessly). I've been as
quick as I could, but you know how
slow the law is. Now, we'll leave you
two together. [Frit with Sarah.
Gilder (sternly). Well?
Margaret (earnestly). I've come to
tell you how to stop these thefts. Mr.
Gilder, give your girls a living wage
and they won't need to steal. How
can we keep body and soul together on
fourteen shillings a week 2 We're on
our feet all day in the shop, and
Gilder (seriously alarmed). Good
Heavens ! Is this a GALsworthy play 2
I had no idea. I thought it was
just–(consulting programme) – ah, I
was right. (In great relief) Look—it's
adapted from an American play by
FREDERICK FENN and ARTHUR WIM-
PERIs. (Soothingly) So you see how
absurd it is to talk like this.
Margaret (penitently). I know. I
won't do it again. What I really
meant to say was this. (Melodrama-
tically) Beware, serpent, for in the next
three Acts I will have my r-revenge |
CURTAIN.
Act. II.
Margaret's flat. It is two years later,
and Margaret is the head of a gang
of criminals; two of whom, Joe
Garson and Agnes Lynch, are dis-
covered conversing.
Garson. I love her |
Agnes. But she is always carrying
on with Dick Gilder. What's her game,
I wonder.
Enter Margaret.
Margaret. Well, any callers?
Garson (gloomily). That detective
from Gilder's. I believe he's on our
track.
Margaret (brightly). But the law
can't touch us! All our crimes are per-
fectly legal. That last little blackmail
business was done quite respectably
through solicitors.
Agnes (aside). From the things that
have been said about solicitors in this
play, I can't help feeling that one of
the authors doesn't like them.
Garson. Well, if that detective comes
here again I shall shoot him with my
patent silent pistol. (Takes it out.)
I'll show you. What shall I shoot?
Margaret (eagerly). The green vase.
It was a Christmas present from grand-
mamma. (It falls to pieces.) At last !
How splendid—I mean, how careless
of you. Well, any other news?
Garson. Jim Wade says there's a
wonderful tapestry in old Gilder's
library, and he knows a shop where
they'll give us a million pounds for it.
We're going after it to-night.
Margaret (nobly). Never! It's against
the law.
Garson (annoyed). You know, dear,
I really think you'd get more sympathy
from the audience if you did illegal
things which were morally right rather
than immoral things which are legally
right. Besides, you know you want
your revenge on old Gilder.
Margaret (crossly). Perhaps you'd
like to write the play yourself? (Stiffly)
As a matter of fact, I married Dick
Gilder this morning. That's my revenge
on Mr. Gilder. I have made him my
father-in-law.
Garson. Personally I still think I
should prefer the million pounds.
CURTAIN.
ACT III.
Gilder's Library.
Gilder. Well, what have you done 2
Cassidy (the detective). Listen To-
night Margaret Taylor's gang will
come here to burgle the house. She
will be arrested and sent to penal
servitude; and — er—(lamely) as soon
as the Majority Report of the Divorce
Commission becomes law your son will
be free.
Gilder. Good. Then I shall toddle
off. It's half-past eleven.
Cassidy. Yes, do; the gang may be
here at any moment. Burglars want
to get to bed so early nowadays.
|They go out, and the stage is in
darkness. Enter Garson and Wade.
Garson. Well, I suppose they're all
in bed by now. H'sh, what's that?
Enter Margaret.
Margaret (dramatically). I've come
to save you ! You mustn't steal the
tapestry ! It's against the law. (With
strong common sense) Besides, it will
probably be my husband's some day.
Naturally, one doesn't want to lose a
million-pound tapestry.
Enter Dick.
Dick (surprised). Help!
Margaret. It's all right, dear. I've
come to send them away. (With sudden
suspicion) Dick, where did that tapestry
come from ? Bayeux, or the Tottenha
Court Road 2 -
Dick. Tottenham Court Road, dear.
You don't say you've come to steal
the tapestry & Heaven bless you!
Garson (sternly). Wade, have you
betrayed us? You dog, take that.
(He fires, and Wade collapses.)
Dick. Quick Give me the pistol.
(Takes it from him.) If this play is to
go on, I must be falsely accused.
Enter a Scotland Yard Inspector.
Inspector. Richard Gilder, I arrest
you for wilful murder.
Dick (pretending to be much dis-
tressed). Bother.
CURTAIN.
ACT IV.- The Flat.
Enter Demarest.
Demarest. Dick is remanded on bail.
All the same, I can't help thinking
he 's innocent.
Margaret. Really, this is just like
the First Act.
Demarest. Yes, I once thought you
were innocent too. But now
Margaret. Well, I can prove that I
never stole those things. Look, here's
a confession from the girl who did.
Demarest. How very satisfactory.
Now Mr. Gilder will apologise to you.
Enter Garson.
(Parson. And I can prove that Dick
never shot Wade. Because I did.
Demarest. Better and better.
Enter Dick.
Dick. And if only Margaret will tell
me that she has learnt to love me since
the second Act then all will be well.
Margaret. Dick, I couldn't tell you
a lie; I do.
Demarest (thoughtfully). I wonder
why she couldn't tell him a lie. It isn't
illegal.
Dick. My wife' (Embraces her.)

So you think of the white dog-roses,
Dear Charles, in the lap of June,
When you do drop off into dozes
At your desk of an afternoon;
You fancy you see the leaping trout
In the long dark pool as the day draws out,
And you turn from the telephone's ugly spout,
And the price of some share in the market gives place to
the stock-dove's croon.
That is all very well for the City,
Where sentiment still lives green,
And it sounds most awfully pretty,
But I cannot imagine the scene:
Lush dells where the early nightingale sang
And the dog-rose bloomed with a glittering fang,
They are done with, Charles, they are clean
gone bang,
They are phantasies unremembered by The Topical Magazine.
Our brains are a finer tissue;
We build for a future day;
You will notice in this month's issue
An article dealing with hay;

We passed it for press in the front of March,
And the girl on the cover (my hat! she was arch),
When the frost set type on the window, we broidered with

Where rollick the tiny chicks,
And the harvest of nuts and peaches
By favour of Ceres mix,

For we're tackling the August number.

How softly that
Without there is noise of 'buses
And noise of the creaking wain,
And a silly old bluebottle fusses
Inside on the window-pane;
And the sky is rimmed by a hundred roofs
And round and about is a litter of proofs
Stamped deep with the stamp of the devil's hoofs,
But beyond, through the noise of printers, loud roars the
ineffable main.
And the cornfields are bright with poppies;
Behold how they wink and burn!
And the leaves on the sun-parched coppice
Are dusty, and dim the fern;
And two months on, O Charles, when you pine
For heathery moors or the open brine,
Your visions will still be quite different from mine,
For our Grand Double Xmas Number will then be our
chief concern. Evoe.

on landing at various ports, he was
received by the authorities with some
show of ceremonial welcome. Here
and there a gun has gone off and a flag
of welcome run up at masthead.
This does not satisfy the punctilious
mind. OLIVER Twist (Dulwich) asks
for more. After some expenditure of
midnight oil he drafted a question
addressed to SECRETARY OF WAR
demanding to know “if, under the
regulations of the War Office, the
First Lord of the Admiralty is entitled
to any special ceremonial recognition;
if so, what is the nature of the same;
and, if there is no such special recog-
nition, whether he will take steps to
ensure that the high position occupied
by the First Lord of the Admiralty is
adequately recognised.”
Might reasonably be expected that
representative of Government would
readily, gratefully, grasp this hand
stretched across sea of Party politics.
And what response does SEELY make?
Casually reads from paper: “This matter
is governed by paragraphs 1807 and
1810 of the King's Regulations. There
is no intention of amending them.”

I dreamed that Mr. HANDEI, Booth

I dreamed that bold BEN TILLETT was

I dreamed I heard LLoyd GEORGE in

I dreamed that Mr. MASEFIELD wrote
a novel all in prose,

opening to the close.

TAKING THE PLUNGE.
AT seven o'clock I climbed out of
bed and looked anxiously at the
weather. The sun was shining from
a cloudless sky and the breeze was
soft and balmy. From a chestnut-tree
a thrush cried cheekily, “Get up, you
lazy beggar! Get up, you lazy beggar!"
I put on my swimming costume and
dressed hastily on the top of it. “Good
boy!” remarked the thrush encourag-
ingly as I stepped into the street; and
fluttered off to tell his wife about it.
I breathed deeply and happily; surely
this was the ideal morning for the
first bathe of the season.
But somehow the world seemed
changed when I reached the front.
The sun still shone brightly, the sky
was still cloudless, the breeze was still
soft and balmy, but the sea looked wet,
with that nasty cold wetness sugges-
tive of drowned men. By-and-by, when
I was bending over the desk, it would
become warm and inviting, and more
fortunate people. . . .
I went into the tent and began to
undress. But my enthusiasm had com-
pletely died out. Instead of throwing
off garment after garment with the speed
of a music-hall performer, I lingered
dubiously over buttons and things.
Why not go back? I asked myself.
Why not postpone it for another week
or two? There was no compulsion
about it. I was my own master. After
all, a man must be a fool to do a dis-
agreeable thing for no reason.
On the other hand, I reflected, the
first plunge was always beastly, and
I knew from experience that the sooner
one got it over the better. And what
would those people on the beach think
of me if I turned back now 2
A mood of reckless daring came
upon me suddenly. Without giving it
time to fade, I dashed out of the tent
and ran towards the sea at top speed.
The few early promenaders gave me
a mighty shout of encouragement.
I sm!!ed my acknowledgments and
fairly hurled myself into the water.
Br-r-r-r, it was cold ! I swam out
desperately a dozen yards, turned, and
headed for the shore, gasping. Another
terrific shout went up as I reappeared
on the sands. Good fellows ' They
recognised a plucky act when they saw
it. I waved my hand.
And then I realised that I was still
wearing my shirt.

ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE DEVOUT LOVER.
ONCE upon a time there was a fox
who fell in love with a pretty little
vixen. He called her Sweet Auburn,
and in the small hours, when all the
world was asleep, they went for delight-
ful strolls together and talked a deal of
pleasant nonsense.
One day she casually mentioned her
approaching birthday, which chanced
to be on May the 15th; and when he
expressed his intention of giving her a
present she said she would like nothing
so much as gloves.
“What colour?” he asked.
“Purple,” she said; and he agreed.
“With white and purple spots in-
side,” she added; and he agreed again.
“And lined with glistening hairs,”
she called after him; and he agreed
Once more.
When, however, he told his mother,
the old lady was discouraging. “They're
not out yet,” she said, “fox-gloves
aren't.”
His mother was a widow. An un-
fortunate meeting with the local pack
had deprived her for ever of her beloved
chicken - winner. She had however
brought up, with much pluck and
resource, her family unaided.
“You’ll never get them by the 15th,”
she added, “that's a fortnight too early.”
“But I must,” replied her son, with
the impetuosity and determination of
youth.
“You’ll never,” said his mother.
Undismayed he set forth and searched
the countryside for fox-gloves. He
found many plants in various early
stages of growth, but none even
approaching the right condition for
exhibiting their stock-in-trade.
“What did I tell you?” said his
mother, and the day drew nearer.
He extended his travels, but in vain,
until one morning, at about a quarter
to five, when he ought to have been at
home again, he came upon a stalk
which actually had buds on it. Care-
fully marking the spot he rushed back
with the news.
“But how can blossoms be ready in
four days?” he asked his mother.
“Intensive culture,” said the old
lady. “There's nothing but that.”
“I don't know what you mean,”
said her son. -
“Of course not ; you're only a child.
It means you must supply heat and
mourishment. You must curl your
warm body round that stalk every
evening as soon as the sun sets and lie
there without moving till the sun's up,
and you must water the roots with
your tears. On no account must you

“THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN " AND
“ARIADNE IN NAxos.”
THE distinguished actor-impresario
who controls the destinies of His
Majesty's Theatre would have had
more of all our compliments for thinking
of bringing over to us Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme—The Perfect Gentleman,
as Mr. MAUGHAM elects to translate it—
if he hadn't so freely mislaid the good
man on the way. Sir HERBERT TREE's
passion for buffooning tended to obscure
the original (and his own talent) and
thereby set the whole comedy, or, rather,
the selected part of it, in a false key.
For the Jourdain I remember,
snobbish, ignorant, credulous
certainly, is altogether a simpler
and pleasanter fellow, is not sure
enough of himself to be anything
like so boisterously vulgar, yet
remains every bit as funny. Sir
HERBERT was often nearer to
Sir Gorgius Midas than to ſº
Jourdain. There were many
outrageous gags and a general
clamour and restlessness of
movement. Sedulous of
“action ” in this crude sense,
Sir HERBERT is unmindful of
the equal and opposite reaction
—on his audience or a silent
part of it. Where a gesture or
is brought forth or an acrobatic
mournful thoroughness. Most
surely improvisation in the idiom
and atmosphere of another age
But the veteran
actor takes a genuine pleasure
in these exercises, and surely
no one of the audience could
have enjoyed the jocund rout so
thoroughly.
Mr. PHILIP MERIVALE as Dorante in
his brave blue suit, and Miss NEILSON-
TERRY in her gay brocade, made a very
pleasant, pretty and appropriate pair.
Mr. Roy Byford pulled his lesson of
the Masler of Philosophy out of the
general racket into some sort of reason-
able shape, while the tailors' pas de
quatre was entirely satisfactory. Herr
Richard STRAUss's brilliant incidental
music nourished high expectations of
his Ariadne in Naros (to Herr voN
HoFMANNSTHAL's libretto), which was
to take the place of the original
“ballets" and “Turkish ceremonies.”
It is built on a pleasantly fantastical
idea. Jourdain, who provides the
opera for his aristocratic friends, orders
that harlequinade and opera shall pro-
ceed together to save time. The
piece of acting of the evening was the
musicians rave, and surely could have
carried their point by explaining that
titled people do not have it so. OW-
ever they conveniently forget this old
trump card, so we find poor Ariadne
(Fräulein Eva voN DER OSTEN) on
her desert Naxos anything but lonely
by reason of the intrusive sympathies
of Zerbinetta and of Harlequin, Scara-
muccio, Truffaldino, and Brighella, her
four lovers. Tactfully disregarding their
existence she sings (divinely) with in-
terruptions, till Bacchus, who had, I
think, from his towels, been bathing in
the neighbourhood, arrives in his canoe
and consoles her. The really spirited
generally unresponsive fowls perched
on branches R. and L. to wake to life
and begin to bow; nicer still of one of
them to strike work and to need coaxing
back to life by an attendant. These
things help the guileless convention of
Opera. And I had some fun out of
wondering whether Bacchus (Herr
MARAK) or Ariadne would be the first
to get a flickering piece of golden snow
well in the mouth in the middle of a
top note. - 6.

CELEBRATED TRIALS.
III.-REx v. BASKERVILLE.
THE prisoner in this case was Henry Satterthwaite
Baskerville Bones Baskerville, who was charged with
having (1) expressed his disgust at the Bunny Hug;
(2) written a letter denouncing the Turkey Trot and the
Tango; (3) displayed a complete ignorance of the Boston;
(4) with having, contrary to the statute, endeavoured to
dance a waltz and a polka; (5) with being a suspected
person found loitering with intent to commit a quadrille.
The Court was crowded with débutantes, chaperons,
duchesses, marchionesses, ticket-holders for subscription
dances, men about town, and young dancers of both sexes
from the suburban districts. Mr. Mazy, K.C., and Mr.
Lighto appeared for the Crown. Prisoner was defended by
Mr. Hobnail, K.C., and Mr.Triptrain; while Mr. Zweipfennig
held a watching brief for the dancing editor of The Times.
At the opening of the court Mr. Justice Onestep made an
earnest appeal to the public to restrain the expression of
their feelings during the course of the proceedings. No
doubt the prisoner was charged with the commission of
very heinous offences, but it was a salutary principle of
English law, thereby differentiating it favourably from the
law—if, indeed, he might so term it—of foreign countries,
that every man must be presumed to be innocent until he
was proved to be guilty. He begged the jury to concentrate
their minds on the evidence and to forget anything they might
have heard or read which could in any degree prejudice
them against the prisoner. He thought it right to make
this preliminary appeal because he knew that the case had
excited profound interest amongst all classes. -
It appeared from the opening statement of Mr. Mazy
that the prisoner was a member of an ancient and most
respectable family settled in the Midlands. He had been
educated without any special discredit at Eton, and had
thence proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford. His studies at
this seat of learning had, however, been curtailed owing to
an incident which affected one of the authorities. A tutor's
oak, had, in fact, been painted over with a bright vermilion
colour, and the prisoner, having failed to explain his
possession of a paint-pot and brush, was rusticated, or, in
other words, expelled from his college. He had then
removed to London, and for a year or two had taken partin
the pleasures of the town. It would be proved that he had
frequented balls and had very often danced waltzes. He
(the learned counsel) did not say this with the intention of
bearing hardly on the prisoner. The jury would remember
that in the days of which he spoke such dances were still
permissible, there being, strangely enough, no legislative
enactment to prevent them.
His Lordship. Autres temps autres mours, Mr. Mazy.
Mr. Mazy, K.C. No doubt, my Lord, that would be so.
The learned counsel, continuing, said that he himself,
and, if he might presume to say so, his Lordship also,
looked back with horror upon a misspent youth. Their
eyes, however, were now open, and they realised their fault,
though that fault was due to ignorance. At that time, in
short, nobody in England had heard of the new dances,
and no blame could attach to those who danced the old
OneS.
His Lordship. It was customary at one period to burn
witches. - -
A member of the public. And a good job, too.
His Lordship. Remove that man.
The man having been duly removed, Mr. Mazy proceeded
to say that at the age of twenty-two the prisoner had left
England for Africa, where he had remained for eighteen
years. He had been heard of in places as widely separated
from one another as Nigeria, Basutoland and Uganda.
Last year he had suddenly come home and had renewed
his intimacy with some of his old friends. One of these,
Lady Richard Ragg-Tempest, happened to be issuing in-
vitations to a dance, and sent the prisoner a card. He
came, but after the first dance he expressed himself to his
hostess in violent terms of condemnation with reference to
what he had seen. Failing, naturally enough, to obtain
any satisfaction from her ladyship, he shortly afterwards
left the house. On the following morning he was arrested,
after a violent struggle, in which two dancing masters were
seriously injured. -
His Lordship. How do you propose to prove the animus
Saltandi 2 We know that bene or male does not matter,
but the amimus is essential. - -
Mr. Mazy. In his letter of acceptance the prisoner stated
that he was eagerly looking forward to the party and |
intended to dance every dance. That letter is in court and
will be produced. - -
The first witness was Lady Richard Ragg-Tempest. Her
ladyship gave her evidence with great reluctance. She
deposed that after the first dance, which was a Boston
varied by Bunny-Hugs, Turkey Trots and Tangoes, the
prisoner came up to her and said these things were an out-
rage and wouldn't be tolerated in Uganda. He also said
he had tried to waltz and polk to the ridiculous tune, but
had failed, mainly owing to the unwillingness of his
partner. - -
His Lordship. She deserves the thanks of the com-
munity. --
Witness, continuing, said she reasoned with the prisoner,
having known him in his younger days, but found it useless.
Mr. Hobnail, K.C. (in cross-examination). Was he serious?
The Witness. He was so serious that I thought he must
be joking.
fter several other witnesses had been examined, Mr.
Hobnail, who announced his intention of calling no evi-
dence, made an eloquent speech in defence, and his Lord-
ship summed up at great length. The jury, were away for
half-an-hour. When they returned the foreman said their
verdict was “Not guilty,” with a rider strongly recom-
mending the prisoner to mercy. Before the Judge could
stop him he said this was a compromise agreed to by all of
them. - - -
His Lordship (to the prisoner). You have been lucky in
having a middle-aged and merciful jury. Let this be a
warning to you. You are discharged.

I confess to a prejudice, based upon painful experience,
against transatlantic fiction. I admit this the more readily
because I am about to prove that, confronted with work of
real and outstanding merit, it becomes a thing of naught.
Unfortunately such occasions are rare. The more honour
then to Virginia (HEINEMANN), before whose compelling
charm I have had the pleasure of unconditional surrender.
Miss ELLEN GLAsgow has not so much written a story—
though this also-as created a single character, complete
in absolutely human form. Virginia herself, as girl, wife
and mother, one seems to have known as a personal friend;
to have admired her youthful beauty, and seen it change
and develop into the matured charm of the woman. Other
women, or I am mistaken, will specially appreciate her.
The history of her life I do not propose to tell you, beyond
saying that it is one in which emotion plays the part of
incident. Nothing in the remotest degree sensational ever
happens to her. Quite early in the book she marries the
lover of her choice, Oliver, the romantic young playwright
whose mission in life is to regenerate the American drama,
hendingly believes. Then children come, and (when Oliver
has cynically abandoned his dreams) prosperity; and one
day Virginia finds that, in thinking more of her nursery
than her husband, she has lost him. But she has still her
son.
tenderness of its telling is beyond praise.

If American novels are going to display such quality as this,
their historical definition as “dry goods” will become
meaningless. -
You get quite a fine impression of an amazingly vital
personality, “a great-hearted, simple, lovable and fiery
soul,” in Mr. ARTHUR CoMPTON-Rickett's William Morris,
which Mr. HERBERT JENKINs publishes in a pleasant
volume. It presents a view taken from outside the charmed
and privileged circle of MoRRIs's old acquaintance and is
therefore not without a new interest. If you have to pass
through a little veil made of the parenthetic diversions of the
literary gentleman marshalling his knowledge and com-
parisons, you'll find there are intimate, even trivial, records
of fact, which help to build up the composite portrait of
this poet, painter; dyer, dreamer; printer, weaver; revolu-
tionary, tradesman, friend, which his admirers will have no
difficulty in accepting. Never, surely, was man so dowered
with divers gifts without any touch of charlatanry or
amateurishness. The author is at some pains to trace
the influences that worked on MoRRIs, and the compiled
synopsis of events, literary and political, in parallel with
a mission in which his wife vaguely and quite uncompre-
the stages of his subject's life, is interesting and valuable.
“Less the artist than the artist-citizen,” is happily said in
reference to the genuine altruism which illuminated MoRRIs
and which is so rarely a characteristic of the artist. He
was indeed a big man, not wrapped up in his own bright

And we don't readily tire of hearing about him. But I wish
that the fastidiousness which made Mr. CoMPTON-RICKETT
write “tenour” had saved him from the deadly “pheno-
menal,” and “phenomenally.” -
Miss HAMILTON has in Mrs. Brett (STANLEY PAUL) a
subject of a most difficult delicacy, and, although her tale is
interesting and human from the first page to the last,' I do
not think that she has slain her dragon; but I like the
directness and simplicity of her treatment. Her four
characters, Mr. Brett, Mrs. Brett, Judith Brett and Peter
Dampier have that free, spontaneous movement that proves
them to be something more that the puppets of a novelist's
toy theatre, and I am especially grateful to her for not
insisting too stridently on her Indian background. Occa-
sionally soñeone will say, “Syce Tattoo lao 1" and of
course polo and punkahs decorate the scene; but there is
a fine reticence in her sharp and disciplined method. She
gives us a picture of two women, mother and daughter, and
finds her situations in the attempt on the part of the mother

Her answer was, “Oh dear, yes, very much, very droll

say? I sought no farther. The P.'s have now got the
book, and like it very much; their niece Eleanor, has
recommended it most warmly to them—she looks like a
rejected addresser.” Surely this strikes a human note, to
which no one who has ever spoken of a favourite book in
unworthy company can fail to respond.
The Reverend Albert Thompson, in Pity the Poor Blind
(CoNSTABLE), was “the son of a musician who had married
beneath him or, more strictly, of a piano-tuner who had
become wedded to an actress.” He took to the Church in
London as a means of self-advancement, and relied less on
any deep-seated belief than on his inherited gifts of a rich
deep voice and dramatic gesture. Berenice Chote was the
daughter of a loose and lively house in a village on the
Dorset coast, as far apart in every way from the parson as one

who, having been badly treated by the daughter, finds, to
his own surprise, that he loves the mother, once defeated

HAMILTON. Nevertheless, Mrs. Brett is a book that deserves
success for its humanity, its humour and its restraint.
Though so much has been written and read upon the
same theme, I am glad to welcome The Life and Letters of
Jane Austen (SMITH ELDER) as another contribution to our
knowledge of one of the most attractive figures in literature.
Naturally Messrs. W. and R. A. AUSTEN-LEIGH’s book is
one impossible of criticism in a paragraph. One can but
say that it is a good book, preserving much of the quiet
charm of its heroine—and leave the matter there. Largely,
of course, it is based upon the well-known Memoir (by the
father and grandfather of the present writers); but there is
also much new matter. The sub-title of the volume is
“A Family Record,” a note that is emphasised to the point
of unconscious humour by the Preface, in which the
authors acknowledge, with a quaint air of proprietorship,
the public interest in their famous relative. For the matter
of the contents, quotation is the only comment.
however content myself with only one brief extract from
a letter written by JANE to her sister CAssan DRA in 1813:-

and his sense of atmosphere is such that one feels and
resents the change of air when the history takes one, for
a time, from Kilridge to town. As for the story, any
attempt to epitomize it here would be as futile and mis-
guided as the process of compressing one's whole existence
(and that of many other people) into a three-line-to-a-day
diary. It is a slice of variegated and vivacious life, leading
to ends you might not expect but must eventually accept;
moreover it is a worthy successor of the author's earlier
work, A Corner of Harley Street, published a year or so ago
but by no means yet forgotten.

THE SITTING BARD.
[Lines addressed to one of the officials who charge you a copper
for your chair in St. James's Park.]
FELLow, you have no flair for art, I fear,
Who thus confound me with the idle Many—
The loafer pensive o'er his betting rag,
The messenger (express) with reeking fag,
The nursemaid sighing for her bombardier—
All charged the same pew-rate, a common penny.
I am an artist; I am not as these ;
He does me horrid despite who confuses
My taste with theirs who come this way to chuck
Light provender to some exotic duck,
Whereas I sit beneath these secular trees
In close collaboration with the Muses.
To me St. James's Park is holy ground;
In fancy I regard these glades as Helicon's;
This lake (although an artificial pond)
To Hippocrene should roughly correspond;
Others, not I, shall make its shores resound,
Bandying chaff with yonder jaunty pelicans.
All this escaped you, lacking minstrel lore.
'Tis so with poets: men are blind and miss us;
You did not mark my eye's exultant mood,
The inflated chest, the listening attitude,
Nor, bent above the mere, the look I wore
When lost in self-reflection—like Narcissus.
Else you could scarce have charged me for my seat;
I must have earned an honorary session;
For how could I have strained your solid chair,
I that am all pure spirit, fine as air,
And sit as light as when with wingéd feet
Mercury settles, leaving no impression ?
Well, take your paltry penny, trivial dun
And bid your chair-contractors freely wallow
In luxury therewith ; but, when you find
Another in this hallowed seat reclined,
Squeeze him for tuppence, saying, “Here sat one
On June the fifth and parleyed with Apollo.”
O. S.
LES AFFAIRES soNT LES AFFAIRES.
I HAVE met a business man—one whom the French call
an homme d'affaires—one who is careful before laying out
his money.
I was waiting for my train near the book-stall when a
staccato voice attracted my attention. The owner of the
voice was in appearance slightly exotic, but he spoke perfect
English.
“I want a newspaper,” he said.
“Yessir,” said the young man behind the counter.
“Which one 2 ”
“Well, what have you got?”
The young man quickly ran through a list of them.
“Not so fast, young man, not so fast! Say them again
more distinctly.”
The young man obeyed somewhat ungraciously.
“That's better. And now what are their prices?”
“They vary from twopence to a halfpenny.”
“Twopence seems a lot; why, I could get four halfpenny
papers for that.”
The young man did the calculation in his head, and said,
“That is so, Sir.” -
“Well, let me look at all of them.”
“Pardon me, Sir, but that is not usual.”
“What?” cried the customer. “You expect me to
purchase goods without examining them—to buy a pig in
a poke 2 I've never heard anything so preposterous in my
life. I shall tell your firm. They ought to know the way
you conduct their business. I am acquainted with one of
your directors.”
Personally I did not believe this last statement.
opinion it was merely bluff. However the young man
credited it. He told a boy to take a copy of each of the
papers and to lay them out on the table in the waiting-
room. The customer, mollified, did not move yet.
“Tell me,” he said—“you are an expert. Which paper
do you recommend ?”
In my
“Well, Sir,” said the young man, “it depends on your
politics.”
“Haven't any. And do they keep to the same politics |
every day?”
“Many of them, Sir.”
“And which contains the most words 2 ”
“Well, The Times and The Telegraph, I should say.”
“How many words are there in The Times?”
“Couldn't say, Sir.” -
“Couldn't say! Couldn't say! I should hope this is the
only business in which a man knows nothing of the goods
he deals in. Do, please, give me your attention.”
“Sorry, Sir, but that was an old customer I had to serve.”
“It's more important for you to get a new one. The
old one will remain a customer from force of habit. Can
you tell me this? If I were to get the four halfpenny papers
instead of the one twopenny one, which would fetch the
more as waste paper afterwards?” -
“Can't say I have ever considered that, Sir.”
“Good heavens ! Talk of efficiency! And what about
the news? Which contains the best news? I am especially |
interested in news from Scotland, Greece, the United States
and the Holy Land.” ; :- .
This was interesting, as it confirmed my theory as to the
mixture of blood in him. . . . . .
“Well, Sir, you'll see them all in the waiting-room.”
“That, anyhow, is a businesslike answer,” said the auto-
crat, and he went and had a look at them.
He spent quite half-an-hour there. It was wasting my
time horribly, but I resolved to see the thing through.
The man interested me. When he had extracted the honey
from all of the papers he emerged with The Times in one
hand and a halfpenny paper in the other.
“Look here,” he said, “I like this Times, but I have
discovered a misprint in it. In the circumstances, shall we
say a penny for it?” -
“Sorry, Sir, but that would be against orders.”
“Very well, then—it’s your affair—I shall only be laying
out a halfpenny with you. This paper is a halfpenny, isn't
it 2 ”
“Yessir.”
“Ah, but stay a moment. Supposing I pay cash for it?
Surely I don't have to pay as much as the man who only
pays once a quarter. If I pay cash you have my money to
play about with at once.”
“Very sorry, Sir, but I cannot take less than a half-
penny.”
“Oh, very well, then, we won't argue about that, but I
wish you could find me a copy with a better impression of
this print of ‘Dngland's Most Beautiful Actress.’ I’m
interested to see what her face is like.”
Just then a train came up, and he said, “Well, never
mind that—only if my wife does not like the paper I shall
expect you to exchange it for another to-morrow,” and he
flung down his halfpenny and was gone.

THE GREAT TUBE.
THE question of the Channel Tunnel
is again becoming acute. Mr. Punch,
following the enterprising lead of The
Daily Graphic, has made a number of
enquiries of public personages as to the
pros and cons of this scheme.
The answers are subjoined:—
Col. SEELY : I am in favour of the
Tunnel, both in peace and in war. In
peace it offers a rapid means of transit
from England to France and France to
England, without the discomforts of
sea-sickness; in war—but the idea of
CRAGANour : It will be sure to need

Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE: I can
think of no bond more likely to cement
the Anglo-French entente— next, of
course, to a magnificent English render-
Sir THOMAS LIPTON: I disapprove of
the Tunnel. Anything that substitutes
However, if you must have it, may the
best tube win
Mr. C. GRAHAME-WHITE: To tunnel
is to retrogress. Let there be a con-
stant supply of flying machines at
Dover and Calais continually making
the passage in a few seconds. My
friends among aviators are so con-
vinced of the superiority of this means
that they express their willingness
themselves to convey all the pretty
actresses from England to France or
France to England.
Sir Edwin DURNING - LAwrence,
Bart. : I cannot begin to focus my
intelligence on the scheme so long as
the starting-point is the falsely-named
Shakspeare Cliff.
The Rev. W. A. Spoon ER, Warden of
New College: Many years ago, after a
rough crossing, I warmed a strong fish
that I might live to see the Tannel
Chunnel. That fish has never waded
from my heart.
Mr. John REDMoND: Anything that
promotes the Union of Hearts is sure
of my support. But I think that a
“boreen” under St. George's Channel
should come first.
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT : The Channel
Tunnel scheme is a great adventure,
but personally I have no desire to be
buried alive.
Mr. W. BEACH THoMAs; I hope the
tunnel, if it is ever completed, will be
utilized for the growing of mushrooms,
an industry in which all good agricul-
turists are deeply interested.
Sir HENRY Howorth : The notion of
boring the Channel appeals to me
immensely. I am not without the hope
that the Editor of The Times will give
me facilities for assisting in this noble
work.
Mr. ALFRED Noyes: The late Sir
LEwis MoRRIs is said to have composed
a good deal of “The Epic of Hades”
in the Underground. The Channel
Tunnel may give us a new DANTE and
a finer “Inferno.”
Mr. MAURICE HEwleTT : As the
author of Earthwork out of Tuscany
and The Scooping Lady I am naturally
much interested in all schemes of
excavation.
Mrs. ANNIE Swan (the Scottish can-
didate for the laureateship):—
Though leagues of foam-flecked and tempes-
tuous Ocean

So, dear, have you and Nurse con-
spired
In secret, and all eyes evaded,
Till you can boast yourself attired
Unwatched, uncounselled and un-
aided ?
Perfect in button, tape and hook,
You've learnt the knack, you come
to tell us,
And while you turn that we may look
I own I am a little jealous
That she has taught you with success
How to assume your frock and
shed it,
That you have learnt the art to dress
And Abigail's is all the credit.
Yet my devotion has its will,
Nor can I lightly yield to Nurse all
The praise, for I have prompted still
A spiritual dress rehearsal;
On your soft hair a helmet placed,
Pastened your breast-plate like a
bib on,
And tied the Truth about your waist
Where she is proud to tie your
ribbon. -
Each has her task, decorous, sweet:
Fair, to surpass your friends, she
made you,
While for your hidden foes' defeat
I in your Pauline arms arrayed you.
For, though you tire of sash and gown
And fold them up for good, there's
no day
When these, that I have made your
Own,
Shall be a burden or démodés.
Yet, though the clasps endure, I know
I'll wish our handiwork were neater
When at celestial gates you show
The well-worn harness to ST. PETER.

THE SIGN.
ONCE upon a time there was an inn-
keeper who, strange to say, was unable
to make both ends meet. Nothing that
he tried was any use: he even placed in
the windows a notice to the effect that
his house was “under entirely new
management,” but that too was in
vain. So in despair he consulted a
wise woman.
“It is quite simple,” she said, as she
pocketed her fee. “You must change
the name.”
“But it has been ‘The Golden Lion'
for centuries,” he replied.
“You must change the name,” she
said. “You must call it “The Eight
Bells'; and you must have a row of
seven bells as the sign.”
“Seven 2" he said; “but that's ab-
surd. What will that do?”
“Go home and see,” said the wise
WOIn turn.
So he went home and did as she
told him. -
And straightway every wayfarer
who was passing paused to count the
bells, and then hurried into the inn to
point out the mistake, each apparently
believing himself to be the only one
who had noticed it, and all wishing
to refresh themselves for their trouble;
carts and carriages drew up; motorists
stopped their chauffeurs and, with the
usual enormous difficulty, got them to go
back; and the joke found its way into
the guide-books.
The result was that the innkeeper
grew as fat as most of his class, lost
his health and made his fortune.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
COUNSEL’S OPINION.
My hostess was one of those women
who are prepared to be ignorant upon
every subject and only too anxious to
be enlightened. When it comes to the
inch I hope I may marry such a one;
I shall have lots to tell her.
“You are a man,” she said as we
came to the end of dessert, “ of decided
opinions.”
“Few of which are reliable,” I told
her, “but many of them I impart to
simple and trusting clients for pay-
ment.”
She asked to be enlightened. “When
I air my views to a solicitor,” I told
her, “it costs him two pounds four
shillings and sixpence a time. Had
you been other than you are, this
evening's talk would have cost you
upwards of a hundred pounds.” I
assured her, however, that I was glad
she was not a solicitor.
“Why?” she asked.
like them 2 ''
I held up pious hands of horror.
“There is no class more adorable and
more worth getting to know ! But,” I
added, “the matters over which they
elect to brood are so very dull. Only
this day I have been instructed to con-
centrate my week's thoughts upon the
dismal story of a garnishee.”
“And what,” she asked, “may a
garnishee be?”
“That was the very question I
asked myself. To my enquirer I said
aloud ‘that my lengthy experience had
taught me how much they needed look-
ing into. I would advise later.’”
She made signs of rising. “You
barristers,” she said, “are dreadful
people.” She cast her eyes round
the table, then turned to me with
one last unscrupulous smile that
amounted almost to a wink, as she
indicated a slightly bald youth at the
far end of the room. “He is a
solicitor,” she whispered, “if that is
any use to you.”
“Thank you,” said I, “it is.”
“Don’t you

Had the Bar Council seen me filling
his port glass for him, its suspicions
would have been instantly aroused.
No man, it would have argued, could
have conceived an affection at first
sight for such an object without an
ulterior motive, and I should have been
accused of brief-hunting.
afraid, up to something much worse
than that.
“They tell me,” said I with great
deference, “that you are a solicitor.”
“I am,” he said. “What are you?”
This was a little sudden. “ 13etween
ourselves,” I said, lowering my voice,
“I am a garnishee.”
I was, I am.
His look was slightly mystified but
otherwise non-committal. “Tell me,”
I said, “is that a dreadful thing to be,
or something rather nice?”
He was one of those fledglings fresh
from the final examination, than whom
not even Lord MoULTON of BANK
knows more of the written law.
Naturally he told me all about garn-
ishees and naturally he made it even
duller than it need have been. I was
about to yawn, when it occurred to me
how I might make even more use of
him.
“I let me,” I suggested, “tell you my
life story and call your attention to the
sordid and complicated situation in
which I now find myself,” and, making
myself the hero of it, I poured into his
willing ear the facts of my case.
“Now,” I concluded, “will you give
me your opinion ? It will be of great
value to me.”
I purposely said “great" value. I
thought it impolitic to admit the exact
worth at which I hoped to retail it.
He wore rimless pince-nez, which gave
him a wary look. I attribute his next
remark to a desire to live up to that
look rather than to innate lack of
manners. “Do I understand,” he
asked, “that you are consulting me
professionally in the matter?”
I found myself, under the influence
of a full-bodied wine, saying that I was,
and agreeing that he should write me
on the matter. Little as I know of
the law, I am aware that a solicitor's
letter costs but six and eightpence, and,
little as I know of arithmetic, I have
reason to believe that if I buy an
opinion off one solicitor for six and
eightpence, and sell it to another
solicitor for two pounds, four and six-
pence, I have a margin of profit of one
pound, seventeen and tenpence. So I
took his promise to write to me and
gave him mine to pay him his six and
eightpence.
“Six and eightpence,” he observed
with great pedantry, “and disburse-
ments.”
“Well,” said my hostess, when I
got to her later, “did you profit by my
hint 2 ''
“To the extent, " I explained, “ of
one pound, seventeen shillings and ten-
pence, less what he called disburse-
ments, but you and I would call a
penny for the stamp."
The daring plan was misconceived.
I cannot recommend it to others. Not
that there was anything wrong with
the fellow's opinion; indeed, after
joining up one or two of the split in-
finitives, I was able to use it verbatim
as my own. It was the disbursements
that thwarted me, as I learnt on
perusal of his second letter.
Dear Sir (it ran),
Re Garnishee.
We thank you for your letter, and
note that our communication to you on
the above matter gave satisfaction and
cleared up your difficulties. In en-
closing our professional account in the
matter, amounting to a total of two
pounds, eleven shillings and threepence,
we would mention for your information
that two pounds, four shillings and
sixpence is the usual fee paid to a
barrister for an opinion. You will,
of course, readily understand that we
did not deem it prudent to advise you
in the matter without laying the facts
before our counsel. A cheque at your
convenience will oblige.”
I am now engaged in endeavouring
to satisfy myself, unprofessionally, on
another intricate question —Is the Bar
an overpaid or an underpaid profession?
The matter is not frce from grave
doubts; there is much to be said for
both contentions.

THE ORDEALS OF THE
OPULENT.
SoME of the sufferings which well-
born and delicately nurtured persons
are now condemned to endure by the
eccentricities of our social system are
graphically described in a recent number
of The Daily Mail. Thus it is narrated
in the issue of May 30th how, under
the portico of a theatre in Charing
Cross Road, three young women “in
sheeny, filmy frocks waited for twenty-
five minutes before they could get a
cab to take them home . . . . Hundreds
passed, all full. Finally, they had to
get the commissionaire to go off and
hunt. Even so, it was twelve minutes
before they were on their way home.”
It is hard to discriminate between
degrees of suffering because so much
depends on what Professor Pupeson so
admirably calls the “temperamentality”
of the sufferer, but we doubt whether
in all the annals of torture a more
appalling ordeal has ever been recorded
than that recently endured by Sir
Halbert Bond, the great financier and
publicist. Sir Halbert, it should be
| explained, had had a most trying day.
He dictated to his shorthand writer for
an hour before breakfast. Between
breakfast and lunch he attended three
company meetings. After lunch he
smoked only one Magnifico Pomposo
cigar and took only two glasses of
Grand Marnier with his coffee before
going down to the House of Commons.
There he remained till 7.30, focussing
his massive brain on the basic interests
of the country. Hurriedly returning
to his mansion in Berkeley Square, he
dressed and repaired to the Blitz Hotel,
where he was giving hospitality to
several Peruvian magnates. The enter-
tainment passed off without mishap
until the “Sorbet ’’ was served, when,
Sir Halbert, who was engrossed in
conversation with Señor Tortuoso, inad-
vertently swallowed the contents of the
glass at one gulp. The effect of such a
mistake, as anyone will readily admit
who has had the misfortune to make it,
is painful in the extreme, and Sir
Halbert's suffering, though borne with
stoical fortitude, was most distressing
to witness, Señor Tortuoso observing
that in all his long experience of the
Putumayo he had never witnessed a
more terrible spectacle than the sight
of his noble host gasping for breath
and ejaculating at intervals in a
strangled whisper, “Old brandy.” On
inquiring at Berkeley Square just before
going to press we were immensely
relieved to hear that Sir Halbert had
had a quiet night and hoped to resume
his normal diet almost immediately.
Widespread sympathy is felt in
land-taxing circles with the Baron de
Chaudfroid in the distressing accident
that befell him while motoring back
from a successful labourers' meeting in
his constituency. Baron de Chaudfroid
was as usual driving his magnificent
200-h.p. “Fafner” at a high rate of
speed, when in a dip of a narrow side
road he was charged by a flock of sheep
and delayed for twenty-three minutes
until his chauffeur had extricated the
fleecy assailants from the wheels.
Not only was the Baron made nearly
half-an-hour late for his dinner—which
always affects his digestion—but, as
though to add insult to injury, the
farmer who owned the sheep brought
an action in which he claimed and
gained £50 compensation for the loss of
his sheep, which, as the Baron's counsel
convincingly showed, had practically
committed suicide.
“The Foreign Secretary, however, entered
a few moments later and took a seat in the
centre of the table, having the Greek, delega-
tion on his left and the Ottoman delegation [.
on his right.”—Standard.
No doubt his posture was a concession
to Oriental etiquette.

The lips that shamed the cherry's hue
With chocolate dabs across 'em.
She taught me first what love may mean,
The heart-felt passion and the full

expenditure upon improvements
or repairs. It appears that those

possession of Rowland HUNT. Distinct
basic resemblance, happily diversified
by individual characteristics. Of the
two, the MAD HATTER takes wider range
of view, encompassing the universe in
his observation. RowLAND is disposed
to concentrate attention upon defects of
the PRIME MINISTER, the vagaries of
the FIRST Lord of THE ADMIRALTY,
and the indiscretions of the HoME
SECRETARY. -
These watch - dog services are con-
sistent with tendency to attack Parlia-
mentary Leaders which first centred
upon him attention of the House. At a
time when PRINCE ARTHUR was entering
upon duties of Leader of Opposition
consequent on General Election of
1906, the Member for Ludlow, like
another “Man from Shropshire” accus-
tomed to make incursion on the Court
of Chancery whilst case of Jarndyce v.
Jarndyce was in progress, suddenly
attacked his esteemed Leader. House
roared with laughter at incongruity of
situation. PRINCE ARTHUR, contrary
to his recognised habit of scorning to
notice such little incidents, had the
rebel's name struck off list of Unionists
receiving whips. For a while RowI.AND
was in dire disgrace. He lived through
it, and has since exclusively devoted
attention to right honourable gentle-
men on Treasury Bench.
MAD HATTER, whilst a good party-
man safe when division bell rings, is
accustomed to doubt the perfected
wisdom of his leader,
MINISTER. His intimate acquaintance
with personages and policies all over
the world naturally reveals to him
weak spots. Whether (to cite cases
submitted by him at a single sitting)
he wants to know “if HEINRich
GRossE, sentenced at Winchester to
three years' penal servitude, is a
German subject”; “whether a number
of Finnish pilots have resigned their
| duties”; “whether the PRIME MINIS-
TER is aware that British armament
companies doing work on contract for
the Government have a total share
capital of 31% millions”; whether he
knows that “allegations have been made
both in Germany and this country”; or
“whether the FINANCIAL SECRETARY To
THE TREASURY can explain the delay in
printing and circulating the Return on
Education,” he invests the query with
air of gravity that sometimes obscures
his meaning.
SPEAKER, asked whether one of the
questions here summarised was in order,
frankly replied, “I have not the faintest
idea to what the honourable gentleman
refers,” declaration of ignorance in which
the PREMIER concurred.
Severe snub like this would have shut
up some men for a month. Merely
the PRIME ||
incites MAD HATTER to further en-
deavour. Members laugh at him. Has
heard himself genially referred to from
Opposition Bench as “the buffoon of
the House.” But after all, there is
method in his madness. A compara-
tively new Member, he early discovered
that cheap and easy way to obtain
notoriety is to direct questions person-
ally to the PREMIER. Addressed to

A fire was a fire. A fight was a fight.

collar-bones, eight ribs, a tibia, an

There was evidence as to the nose,
now that the journalist noticed it more
observantly.

fallen star with a certain melancholy
relish. “The public like a hero with

HAMLET.
A Character Study.
As to Hamlet's forbears or his earlier
days I know nothing, nor am I greatly
concerned. When I met him he was
already old—unimaginably old—and
grim and gaunt withal; he dwelt in a
livery stable in a small Scotch town,
and it was on his back that I made my
first essays in horsemanship. I do not
say he was agreeable to ride, but
neither, I daresay, would he recall me
as particularly pleasant to carry. 1
only hope I did not hurt him half as
much as he often hurt me.
In those long and blistering hours of
agony I came to know him with a
curious intimacy. He used to walk
along—and always on the wrong side
of the road—with an air of mild ab-
straction tinged vaguely with remorse;
when I sawed at his mouth, which was
as iron or adamant, he smiled tolerantly
and did nothing. Then would come
the riding master's, “Now, gentlemen,
if you'll just shorten your reins we'll
trot for a bit,” and with that a horrid
spasmodic chuckleshook Hamlet's gaunt
frame; he cocked one ear devilishly; he
champed his bit and whisked his tail,
and then with a sort of colossal hic-
| cough—as if, I used to think, he were
changing gear rather roughly inside—
he “trotted.” Uphill he rolled and
downhill he slid, and all the while his
action would remind one of those fasci-
| nating movements made by British
seamen while dancing the hornpipe.
I believe the operation is known as
“hoisting one's slack.” That is what
Hamlet seemed always to be doing,
first on one side and then on the other.
A hitch and a kick, a hitch and a kick—
that was his notion of trotting. He
was always far in the rear, and always
perfectly pleased with himself and per-
fectly cheerful about it, and perfectly
immovable. And when the “trot ” was
at an end he would glance round at
his tortured rider with an expression
| incredibly free from malice and yet
incredibly full of a fiendish delight.
I don't know who named him, but
there was not a little of the moody Dane
in his starved soul. He had a rolling
and poetic eye, capable of unsuspected
depths of philosophical speculation, and
by the aid of this and a curious twitching
º, of his unbeauteous mouth he achieved
the gift of expression. For a long time
I thought he was only making faces
at me, but gradually I grew able to
interpret. In the stable he used to
lounge about in his box like some old
bore in a club armchair, and all the
time his face flickered and worked like
a cinematograph. I don't believe he
ever saw a racecourse, but I know he
dreamt of them, for when the clank of
buckets floated in from the yard, with
scraps of the strange jargon of the
sporting press, he would draw himself
up and scrabble with his feet in the
straw. “Two to one, Hamlet,” the
Ring shouted in his dreams; “six to
four, Hamlet ; evens, Hamlet !” And
then Hamlet leading them all into the
straight, and tearing away past the post
amid roars of joy. Ah, well! After all,
GEORGE THE THIRD believed himself a
hero of Waterloo; so why should not
poor old Hamlet win a Derby in his
dreams ? -
Sometimes I think he realised that it
was not true, and that he was no better
than an old fool, and then there would
creep into his tired eyes a wistful look.
“Just once,” he seemed to say, “just one
real good time.” And then would come a
flash of resolution and out would go his
heels in a way that sent the splinters
flying. “I will have my day,” it meant.
Well, he did. - . . -
It so chanced that the local Terri-
torials went into camp that year at
Blair Atholl, and Hamlet and I went
with them. He was very good and
very docile all through three long
summer days, but sometimes I caught
that flashing resolution brightening his
eyes in a way that boded trouble. He
used to stand soaking himself as it were
in the scent of pine and heather and the
cool music of the Garry, and more than
ever he seemed to be communing with
things that were not of this world.
Something in these long drowsy days
must have told him that his chance
must come soon now or never, and I
am sure that his Derby-dream was
always with him.
But on the third evening a great army
of cloud came marching down upon us
from Badenoch, and the dusk fell to an
accompaniment of muttering thunder.
About midnight the storm broke with
a blaze of lightning and a merciless
downpour of rain. I was battling my
way down the horse-lines with a lantern
when, on a sudden, the neigh of a horse
rose twice, like a trumpet-call, above
the roll of the thunder. Somehow I
knew the voice for Hamlet's, even before
the pandemonium broke loose; for in
a minute tethers were snapping all
round and pegs flying from their hold
and about forty horses came down the
lines like an avalanche. They were led
by a great gaunt black devil with
streaming mane and eyes of fire, going
in great shapeless leaps and roaring all
the time like a blacksmith's bellows.
It was Hamlet holding Walpurgis and
winning his Derby once again.
Heaven knows what spirits rode with
him that night upon the storm. We
got in the rest after a couple of profane
hours in the rain, but Hamlet was not
to be found. A shepherd saw him about
daybreak tearing round and round a
field all by himself, and a surfaceman
on the Highland line swears that he
took a five-foot fence like a Grand
National winner. Eventually a patrol
of Boy Scouts found him about eight in
the morning in a field near Struan very
dejected and the moody Dane once
more. He came back like a lamb.
Poor devil! He had his night; but
he came back coughing, and he coughed
himself out of this world in a fortnight.
I suppose no one thinks of him now as
anything but a raw-boned, unlovely
beast, pounding along behind all the
rest, patiently and stupidly hitch-and-
kicking through the mud. But for the
sake of the kind and cheering look he
used to give one when the ride was
over, the genial cock of the eye that
softened the riding-master's profanities
—above all, for his bold dreams and his
big heart, I like to remember him as
something more.

“Yis, he wor a great lump of a chap

his garden plot talking to old Joe
Sherrington.
“I wor stood here smokin' a pipe
arter my dinner, same as I am now,
and he come up to me as bold as yow
like, and he say, ‘Good mornin', Giles,'
he say. “Good mornin', Brown,' I say.
He ſared wholly stammed at that. “My
name eent. Brown,' he say, “And mine
eent Giles,' I say, “so we're both
wrong." Wool, he laughed like what
yow expect 'em to laugh in Lunnon,
and he say, ‘Will yow take a drink?'
Wool, I di'n't want to make he angry,
and you know Tuesday wor a warm

they 're been talkin' so much about in
the newspaper? They tell me yow du
nothin' but talk scandal in these parts.'
“Du they 2' I say; “then they're doin'
it theirselves, that's plain.'
“But I want to know for a par-
tickler reason,’ he say. “The fact is
I'm a butcher by trade and I'm
tired o' town life. I want to set up
a little meat business in the country,'
he say; but if there is a thing I'm
afeared of, that's scandal. I ha' had

CELEBRATED TRIALS.
IV.-REx v. ADAMson.
THE defendant in this case was the Rev. Hercules
Adamson, described as Vicar of Little Pottleton, Bucks,
forty years of age, a married man with a family of ten
children, two of them being twins of tender years. He
was brought up on an indictment the main count of which
was that he, being a British citizen of mature age and sound
mind, had not in the past five years reported himself at the
National Institution for Nervous Breakdowns and had
never, as a matter of fact, absented himself from his ordinary
avocations during the statutory period of one month in
every year for the purpose of taking a rest-cure in ac-
cordance with the regulations thereunto made and provided
by the Nerve Commissioners in the exercise of the authority
delegated to them by the Act (GEORGE W., 10, cap. 4) for
the Prevention of Undue Health, generally known as the
Ailments Act. The prosecution was conducted by Mr.
Moper, K.C., and Mr. Trimble. Prisoner was defended by
Mr. Soundy. The court was crowded with nerve-specialists,
nurses, attendants from private hospitals, psychological
experts and interesting invalids in various stages of in-
voluntary convalescence. A pathetic incident was provided
by the attendance in court of prisoner's aged mother, who
had intended to appeal for the prisoner on the ground that
he had suffered in early youth from a period of considerable
robustness, from the effects of which he had never quite
recovered. As it appeared, however, that she was in the
enjoyment of all her faculties, could read small print with-
out glasses and made a habit of walking two miles un-
attended before breakfast every morning, the Judge decided
that it was impossible to take her evidence.
Prisoner was brought into court in charge of two power-
ful nurses from the Central Rest-Cure. He preserved a
cheerful demeanour and appeared to be totally unconscious
of his serious position.
From Mr. Moper's opening speech it appeared that
Adamson, after a career of unbridled athleticism at Rugby
and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he is said to have
stroked his College boat and played Rugby Football for the
University, took his degree in the Theological Tripos. In
spite of the earnest intercession of his tutor and the Senior
Dean of the College he resolutely refused to submit to an
agrotat, and was examined in the ancient manner by means
of papers set to him in the Senate House. After a period
spent as curate in an East-end parish, where he was said to
have gained an unfortunate reputation as a skilful boxer, he
was appointed to the benefice of Little Pottleton, his income
being £200 a year, together with an Easter offering of vary-
ing amount. Here he became a violent advocate of open
windows, walking tours, seaside camps for boys, athletic
meetings, hockey matches, and of the strenuous life generally.
Indeed, much as he (the learned Counsel) regretted it, it
would be proved in evidence that this man, who was in a
position to give an example and was looked up to with
respect by his parishioners, had never known what it was
to enjoy ill health.
Mr. Soundy. That is not strictly accurate, my Lord. I
protest against such attempts to excite prejudice. I have
evidence to show that the prisoner was at one time under
the influence of chicken-pox, and a year later acquired a
certain amount of mumps.
His Lordship. Chicken-pox and mumps can hardly be
called an answer to the charge. Being involuntary they
are at the most pleasing incidents.
Mr. Soundy. The prisoner obtained a severe attack of
measles after purposely exposing himself to infection from
his younger brother.
His Lordship. That might help you were it not for the
fact that measles are expressly excluded by the Act.
Mr. Moper, continuing, said he did not wish to press
hardly on the prisoner. He was willing to give him such
credit as might lawfully accrue to him from his measles,
but he must point out that the gravamen of the charge
was really the abstention from a rest-cure, coupled with
the complete neglect of any nervous breakdown. The
State in its beneficent wisdom had made ample provision
for the creation and accommodation of invalids, and every
citizen ought to realise, as nearly all citizens did, that it was
necessary to be ill, and that a violent predisposition to
undiseased strength was an offence of the gravest description.
Witnesses were examined and boro out the learned
counsel's opening statements. They all spoke with con-
siderable esteem of the prisoner, but feared he must have
been misled.

business of various clubs and institutions, visit the distressed,
play cricket when possible, and generally look after the [
affairs of his parish.
His Lordship. We cannot go behind the Act. No excep- |
tions are there allowed. Other vicars have submitted.
Prisoner. Possibly they have nerves. I never had any.
IIis Lordship. The more unfortunate you.
The jury eventually returned a verdict of guilty, but with-
out intent.
His Lordship said the prisoner was evidently one of those
desperate characters who were apt of their own motion to
defy the law. A man in his position should have been
amongst the first to hurry into a nerve hospital. Possibly
the jury might have felt that this public exposure was a
sufficient punishment for such a man. He himself could
not take that view. The sentence of the Court was that the
prisoner be deprived of his benefice, be confined for ten years
in a bath-chair with a respirator over his mouth, and be
compelled to describe his symptoms three times a day to a
pathologist.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE is a growing fashion of mother-heroines; and of
this I am personally rather glad, since I like to fancy
myself something of an expert in mothers. But they need
to be written about very well. Fortunately this is the
case with the latest example, Mrs. Morel, the central
figure of Sons and Lovers (Duckworth). The title gives
you the whole matter of the tale. Will a man be more
earnest and devoted as son or as lover ? Mrs. Morel's
three boys answered the question variously. Arthur, who
was good-looking but not much else, hardly matters.
William, the eldest, was somewhat quaint in his courtship;
having become engaged to a young person who believed
herself his social superior, he used to come home and abuse
her roundly to his shocked parent. However he died,
leaving the whole interest of the book, and of Mrs. Morel,
to concentrate upon Paul, the youngest. If Paul was
unfortunate in his sweethearts, he was very heartily to be
congratulated upon his mother. In the first part of the
book—which I infinitely prefer to what comes later—
Mr. D. H. LAwRENCE has shown very movingly the affection
and comradeship between these two. Incidentally also he
has given us a picture of a collier's home that is either
drawn from personal experience or imagined with quite
amazing penetration. There are touches—the child in bed
watching the light swing across the ceiling as the miners
go by with their lamps, is one I recall at random—that
have the intimacy of memory. And throughout Mrs. Morel
herself is a real joy. Perhaps this is why I objected so
strongly to the painful realism of her end. I think indeed
that, if I had my way, the book should consist only of Part
One, and the other would never be missed; there is value
and to spare without it.
The Adventures of a Newspaper Man (SMITH, ELDER)
have not, I am afraid, moved, entertained or informed me
to any great extent. Mr. FRANK DILNOT does not appear
to have led a life any more adventurous than my own; if
anything, it is the other way on, for what to the average
man must have been such insignificant and frequent events
as not to be worth worrying about excite him to a frenzy
of turgid journalese. He plunges into cabs, hurls himself
through doors, and is pulsating and tense in the most
ordinary circumstances; constantly he is engaged in writing
up the commonplaces of every-day experience in that peculiar
language employed by the blood-and-thunder novelist to
describe incidents of the turbulent and sinister sort. I
do not so much attack Mr. DILNOT and his colleagues as
defend the older school of newspaper men, whom he appears
to despise, and I, with great submission, admire. The
impudence upon which he insists in the present-day jour-
nalist is not necessarily the best substitute for the soundness
of his forerunners; and, though it is a useful and, I un-
grudgingly admit, a clever feat to get five minutes ahead of

the other fellow with an item of news, the men who achieve
it must not rely on that alone and be wholly devoid of a
sense of humour, style and proportion if they are to claim
superiority in merits and power over the journalist of the
other type, of whose printed opinions the influence is still
felt. The book contains a résumé of many recent cries of
the halfpenny press, a number of rather pointless anecdotes,
a personal observation of the Russian people not without
interest, and a rather ridiculous study of Lord North CLIFFE,
who deserves a more intelligent summing up than this:
“Ruthless and merciless is he. . . . He sees things, and he
knows not why he sees them.”
These prophetic novelists seem a vastly uncomfortable
set. Times without number they have smashed, deluged
and devastated our poor earth. The latest to join the doleful

the previous four hundred pages or thereabouts he had been
a member of the secular priesthood of Ireland, and, allow-
ing the usual discount for odium theologicum, Mr. GERALD
O'DonovaN makes out an exceedingly plausible case for the
blackness of that particular body. Ignorant for the most
part and sordidly self-seeking, they are opposed, according
to this writer, to all the best interests of Erin, and are the
real enemy of Home Rule, the best chance for that measure
lying apparently in the modernism which aims at dairy
co-operation, the revival of Gaelic, and a certain amount of
tolerance in religious thought. I'ather Ralph, a brilliant
youth destined from early boyhood for the Church, became
gradually disillusioned by the system of his theological
seminary and the characters of his bishop and superior
priest, and finally revolted when the “lamentabili sane”
decree appeared to destroy all possibility of reform. The
author writes so well that personally I am sorry he did not
treat me to a novel instead of a thesis in romantic form;
but I have little doubt that his book will figure in the
- — catalogues of most of
our circulating libraries.

was in the old pre-pestilence life. Thrale settles down as
joint-leader of a feminine community at Marlow. As for
the young butcher, the less said of him the better. An
absorbing and amusing tale, which I liked best in the mock
realism of the early chapters, where the coming of the
plague and the general disintegration of ordered society
are told in delightful fashion. Later I seemed to feel that
the magnitude of the situatich he had created weighed upon
Mr. BERESFORD to the detriment of his art. The arrival of
a liner from America full of men could only be regarded as
an evasion, and a cowardly one at that. But its appear-
ance, and the race on bicycles of hero and heroine to meet
it at Southampton, provide an excellent final thrill.
On page 493 the eponymous hero of Father Ralph (MAC-
MILLAN) “took up his clerical collar and looked at it
curiously. He smiled as he thought of how he had dreaded
laying it aside: and now there was only a sense of escape
from bondage, of freedom.” I have noticed a good many
lines in Anglican neck-linen about which I believe I should
have felt like that if I had ever been compelled to put them
on; but Father Ralph of course was speaking with a
spiritual significance about the yoke of Rome; for during
matic this man undoubtedly meant business, and so it
is a little disappointing to be switched off suddenly to
Ilfracombe, and for some time to lose sight of him. Not
that things were unexciting in Devonshire, for very soon
a remarkably fine game—of “hunt the pebble,” if I may call
it so—was in full swing. This pebble is the key to the
story, and in the pursuit of it Mr. CHARLEs STERREY piles
sensation upon sensation, making it the foundation-stone
of the most bewildering plots and counterplots. Our old
friends the stupid local police are once again trotted out for
ridicule, but this time I found them a welcome relief from
the bloodthirsty ruffians who baffled them. And I am
also grateful for my introduction to the Polish Countess,
who was, without flattery, a superb fiend. When I ulti-
mately discovered that the Siberian convict was married to
this diabolical woman I ceased to wonder at the ferocity of
his oath. A love-interest is provided for those who want
it, but Mr. STERREY devotes more attention to his criminals
than to his philanderers, and it is only as an amazing
sensationalist that he can be recommended.

For that large smile which is your native dower
To petrify this swarm of scandal-mongers.
We would not have you hurry, MURRAY,
But things at home are just as hot as curry.
We picture you out there the slave of toil

Among the gushers, doing deals in oil,
Not for your own ends but for Messrs. PEARSON's;
We know your motto, fixed as fate,
Was ever “ Duty first ; let Pleasure wait ; ”
Yet, could you read what even Liberals say
Of truths extracted like reluctant molars,
You would not linger longer, not a day, -
But fling yourself across the estranging rollers,
Cutting the prior claims of Quito

For your appearance in our First Report
Occurs by proxy only; but I've reckoned
You'll be in time (D. W.) to share the sport
And have your viva voce in our Second;
Meanwhile, en route, our wireless stations
Shall flash you any further revelations.

Of testimony kindly sent by cable,
The spoken word is always nicer;

I'M a burglar. -
I say, I'm a burglar. There is no catch in it. My
occupation, when I am at liberty to follow it, is burglariously
breaking and entering dwelling-houses with intent to commit
a felony therein.
I am the man of whom you are afraid by night. I also
am the man who is afraid of you by night. You are always
hearing me moving about down stairs, when in fact I'm
elsewhere; I am always hearing you moving about upstairs,
when in fact you are asleep. It is nervous work for both
of us, isn't it 2
Or rather, I used to be a burglar. It was in consequence
of a remark addressed to me by a man named Hodgkinson
that I gave up the business. Do you know the Hodgkinsons
of 199, South Audley Street, W.? No? No more do I,
but nevertheless I thought I might while away an hour
or two at their house as well as anywhere else.
The servants having gone to bed when I arrived, I had
to unpack my bag myself. It is a whim of mine to do this
in the dark—a foolish whim, perhaps, as I always end
by dropping something and breaking something else. One
has to be a burglar to learn what a lot of glass there is in
the world ready to create a disturbance on the slightest
provocation.
“Who are you?” called out Hodgkinson from above.
I thought it was no good answering that I was a burglar.
He would not have sympathised, so I let the remark
pass.
“What are you doing down there?” he continued.
Think as I would, I could not hit on an evasive answer;
besides, my throat was curiously dry and did not lend itself
to conversation. But this Hodgkinson was bent on
conversing, so he went back to his room and explained to
his wife how right everything was in this best of worlds.
His wife, however, was clearly of opinion that she had
heard something, and, as I proceeded with my work not
without trepidation, she was even more certain that she had
heard something else. No doubt she was right; there was
certainly plenty to hear. So back came Hodgkinson,
determined to extract some information out of me.
I confess to being then a little nervous and almost upset
upon realizing that here was Hodgkinson coming down-
stairs. For all I knew, he carried a revolver; and I had
heard dreadful accounts of the lengths to which house-
holders will go in their dangerous business of householding.
I had an instinctive feeling that, pleasant place though
199, South Audley Street, W., might be, it was no place
for me. Even as I was seriously thinking of changing my
address, the hall was flooded with a brilliant light. I hate
too much light, for it gives me a headache; so that
decided me, and I moved towards the door.
Meanwhile this Hodgkinson, if you will believe me,
heaved a sigh of intense relief. “Oh 1” he said, “it’s only
you, is it?”
Only
Then he tried to be severe. “You have no business to
give us such a fright,” he continued. “We thought you
were a Suffragette.”
I retired once and for all from 199, South Audley Street,
W. and the profession in disgust.

“HAMMELINE,” I said sadly, “it is
now twenty years since at the call of

“Booty,” interjected Hammeline
with all a woman's shamelessness.
“Twenty years,” I harked back,
“since I came across and fought at
Senlac.”
“I have always taken your word for
it,” said Hammeline, “that you were
not still sea-sick on the day of the
battle.”
“Being informed that I had pouched
a goodly demesne,” I -
continued, ignoring her,
“you rashly packed up,
put the seneschal on
board wages, and fol-
lowed me hitherward.
You have told me at
intervals ever since that
your action was not pre-
mature. Well, Hamme-
line, I now find that we
should be doing better
with our three acres and
a cow in dear old Nor-
mandy. I understand
from this cartel,” I said,
handing it to her, “that
we are going to be taxed.”
“Taxed 2’ demanded
Hammeline. “What on
earth for 7”
“Because of our land,”
I said bitterly—“‘The
land, the land on which –
we stand,’ as we used to sing in the
dear old days when ‘the King gave
the land to the Normans.’”
“On the simple understanding that
they should fight for him when required,”
said Hammeline indignantly.
“Of course,” I said; “but, since there
haven't been any wars to speak of, it
appears that another sort of quid pro
quo will be extracted from us.”
“Oh, well, of course,” said Hammeline
decidedly, “we simply shan't pay, and
there's an end of it.”
“An end of us,” I said. “I think
you had better read the cartel,
Hammeline. An estato duty man is
coming to assess us on Friday. He
calls himself a commissioner, so that
means that he will expect to dine with
the family.”
Hammeline called the scrivener and
got herself posted in the contents of
the cartel.
“This is the man,” she said at last,
pointing triumphantly to a twirly part
of the document. “His name is Rolfgar
du Nord. Don't you know anything
against him 2 He's one of us, of
course.”
“Of course,” I said. “But I'm
afraid he must be since my time. We
can't square him—unless you know any
details of his career, Henry,” I con-
tinued hopefully, turning to our faithful
scrivener.
“I fear, my lord,” said Henry, “that
Sir Rolfgar du Nord is in the main
line of descent from Sir Kay de Calais
—an excellent family and a blameless
youth.”
“I wonder if he's still unmarried,”
said Hammeline.
“What has that got to do with it?”
I said irritably. “The point is that

no more avoided than Domesday.”
So saying, I took her hand in mine,
and, standing together in the glow of
the westering sun, we looked far abroad
with eyes grown dim on the acres of
our goodly heritage, where our Saxon
serfs were busily ploughing our—that
is, their-ancestral soil.
“Ah, Hammeline,” I said softly,
“we are growing old, and poverty
stalks towards us. We cannot afford
to feed so many mouths. I shall be
obliged to hang a few of the scullions.”
When Rolfgar du Nord and I rode
forth to view the lands, Maude came
with us, by the special request of her
mother. And ever the minx rode at
the saddle-bow of Rolfgar and prattled
as she rode.
“You see,” she said, “the difficulty
is that we really don't know which are
our lands, and which aren't. Things
got so mixed at the time of the
Conquest, didn't they 2 And now all
these people who've been saying the
land was theirs ever since will say it's

fields belong to Aelfred the Saxon, and
you mustn't think they don’t, just
because we help him with his harvest
now and then. You can spell his
name with a simple “A,” she continued
quickly, turning to Rolfgar's scrivener.
“The diphthong is pure swank.”
Rolfgar laughed good-humouredly
and bade the scrivener make a note
of it.
“The fact is,” said I, seeing (if I may
so phrase it) how the land lay, “the
poppet knows as much about all this
as I do. Shall I leave her to do the
honours, Sir Knight? I have a knave
or two to chastise. See you at dinner.”

them to it.

us) that I was no longer

thought myself.
“All the same,” said
Rolfgar, when we were
alone together, “I was
given to understand that
you'd done yourself
rather better over the

|He paused inquiringly.
| “It’s a bit awkward,”
I confessed, “and it
worries me; for I am
naturally concerned
about the future inter-

Rolfgar flushed. “Ah,” he said
eagerly, “what you want is a young

ONCE upon a time there was a daisy
who conceived a fierce passion for
another daisy a few inches away. He
would look at this daisy hour after
hour with mute longing. It was im-
possible to tell his love, because she
was too far off, for daisies have
absurdly weak voices. They have eyes
of gold and the most dazzling linen,
but their voices are ridiculous.
One day by happy chance a bronze-

and the daisy saw it passing from one
to another of his companions, settling
for a few moments on each. Bronze-
the daisy to the condition of an ane-
mone, the bronze-wing settled right on
his head.
“Good afternoon,” said the daisy.
“You're just the person I wanted to
see.”
“Good afternoon,” said the bronze-
wing. “What can I do for you?”
“Well,” said the daisy, “the fact is
I have a message for a lady over there.
Would you take it 2."
“With pleasure,” said the bronze-
wing; and the daisy whispered a loving
message to him.
“Which one is it 2 " he asked, when
ready to start.
“How can you ask? Why, that beau-
tiful one just over there,” said the daisy.

It was an idea, however, that could

“Yes?” said the bronze-wing eagerly.
“In return we will refuse the atten-
tions of other visitors; all our honey
shall be for you. All our energies shall
go to providing you with the best.”
“Done,” said the bronze-wing.
“Better make a start at once,” said
the card. “Here's another message
for that lady;” and he whispered
again; and off the bronze-wing flitted.
He was soon back with the reply,
which turned the edges of the daisy's
ruff pinker than before.
“Now tell her this,” said the daisy.
“But what about the rest of the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MARVELS OF THE METROPOLIS.
THANKs to the courtesy of our con-
temporary we are enabled to print the
following selection from the correspond-
ence which will appear in the forth-
coming number of The Dictator:-
THE BIRD AND THE BALL.
SIR,-While playing golf lately on
the Hanger Hill course I had an ex-
traordinary experience which may per-
haps interest some of your readers.
As I was lofting my approach to the
second hole you may imagine my
astonishment when I saw a bird swoop
down, seize the ball in mid-air and
carry it off. The really extraordinary
point about the episode remains yet to
be told. The bird was a Nuthatch, and
the golf-ball was a Colonel.
I am, Sir, OFFLEY PHIBBS.
“Luneville,” West Ealing.
[We are delighted to print Mr.
Phibbs's well-authenticated anecdote.
What renders the feat of the bird so
remarkable is that a nuthatch is such
a small bird. But size is no criterion
of strength. The Hamals, or porters, at
Constantinople are often quite small
men, though one of them has been
known to carry a grand piano on his
back.-E.D., Dictator.]
NoRTH LONDON Novel.TIES.
SIR,-The variety of wild birds
frequenting the metropolitan area has
been illustrated by your Hampstead
correspondent. May I contribute my
own experiences, derived from my resi-
dence in Harringay ? On April 1st, I
saw two red-shanked bandicoots settle
on my asparagus bed. On April 19th,
at 4.30 A.M., I distinctly heard the note
of the lesser pilliwink, though I failed
to see the bird itself. Finally, on May
2nd, I saw a flock of almond-crested
macaroons flying at a great height over
the º Athenaeum.
Yours, SAPPHIRA MUNCHAUSEN.
Hotel Splendide, Mendar,
Corea, Crete.
[Miss (or is it Mrs. ?) Munchausen's
record is profoundly interesting. Per-
sonally, we had hitherto associated
macaroons exclusively with confec-
tionery, but journalists live and learn.
The bandicoot is described in The
Standard Dictionary as “a rat-like
perameloid marsupial of Australia";
in this case they presumably made their
way to Harringay from the docks.
How admirably expressive a name the
pilliwink is ' Assuredly the old bird-
namers were masters in the art of
Onomatopoeia.-E.D., Dictator.]
A TALKING Owl.
SIR,--The following story of the
intelligence of an owl, for which my
whole family are prepared to vouch,
will, I trust, find a corner in your
esteemed journal, of which I have been
a constant reader for the last eighty-
five years, having been born at Thames
Ditton in the year 1814. Some months
ago I trapped a fine young owl in an
elm tree which grew in my garden in
Pimlico, and gave it lessons in talking.
Owls will soon acquire an extensive
vocabulary if fed on macaroni and
dormice, and they never use bad lan-
guage. Indeed, one lesson was sufficient
to break my pupil of the bad habit of
saying “To who " instead of “To
whom.”
I am, Sir, Yours, etc.,
JonAH Swallow.
The Green House, Peckham Rye.
[It is always a pleasure to print one
of Mr. Swallow's letters, which abound
in the mellow wisdom of age combined
with the alert sympathy of perennial
youth. It is curious to learn on such
good authority of the fine moral of
owls. Can any of our readers explain
why parrots, on the other hand, are so
passionately addicted to ornamental
execration ?—ED., Dictator.]
A CAT AND BIRD FIGHT.
SIR,-While recently walking in the
Euston Road I was astonished to see,
perched on the summit of a piece of
monumental masonry, a full-grown
capercailzie defending itself in resolute
fashion against the attack of a large
Persian cat. As I had an important
engagement in the City I was un-
fortunately unable to witness the result
of the conflict, and on calling at the
monumental mason's house next day
could gain no information on the sub-
ject. Is it possible that I was suffering
from an optical illusion ?
I am, Sir, Yours, etc.,
AUGUSTUs Twigg.
The Bungalow, Wapping.
[The capercailzie is seldom seen in
these isles except in the Highlands.
We cannot help thinking this was a
Siberian bird which had escaped from
cold storage. The animosity of the
Persian cat was probably due to racial
antipathy, inflamed by recent events at
Teheran.-ED., Dictator.]
The Toy Dog Craze.
“Miss Asquith appeared in a charming
gown of mauve moiré, the corsage composed
of mauve chiffon embroidered in mauve, green,
and pale pink, gracefully draped and caught
with a shaded purple puppy.”—The Standard.
The Prime Minister Masquerades.
“Mr. Asquith wore a striking and beautiful
black gown with sphinx embroidery graduated
below the waist and terminating with hand-
some tassels.”—Western Mail.
SELLING THE DUMMY.
I MET Christine accidentally at the
bottom of the Haymarket.
“You !” I said.
“From top to toe,” she said. “What
a good guess!”
“Yes,” I said; “and I have guessed
something else, too. You are coming
to tea with me.”
“Ought I?” said Christine.
“There is little doubt about it,” I
said. “In fact, it is written in the
Book of Fate.”
“Not in my pocket edition,” said
Christine, drawing a little silver-backed
tablet from her muff and reading:
“Dressmaker, 4. Tea, with Charles,
4.45.”
We were now opposite the Inglenook.
“Capitall” I said. “Come in here.
Charles is sure to be here.”
“I’m sure he won't; he is waiting
for me elsewhere.”
“London is full of Charleses,” I said.
“Did you say muffins, tea-cake, or
toast 2 ”
We were firmly seated now, and I
was tackling very strongly.
“Muffins and crumpets,” said Chris-
tine, “then I can really forget Charles.”
“I had already forgotten Charles,” I
said. “He is now at Oxford Circus
eagerly scanning each Bayswater 'bus
as it comes in sight; or,” I added, “he
is keeping another appointment.” It
was mean, but everything counts in
love. Besides, it didn't matter; Chris-
tine was too busy to notice it.
It was at this point that I suddenly
remembered that when I met Christine
I had just paid away £2 7s. 3d. for
some shirts and other things. Had I
enough money to pay for the tea 7
I felt furtively in my pocket. Sixpence
and three coppers!
“Come,” I said, “let us leave this
place.”
“You’ve been looking at picture post-
cards,” said Christine. “I’m certain
I saw almost those very words on one
yesterday. Why should we leave 2
I'm just getting into my game.”
“I’ve taken a dislike to the wall-
paper,” I said evasively. “Besides,
my conscience is pricking me about
Charles.” -
Outwardly I was calm, inwardly all
was strife and turmoil.
“Christine,” I said, “observe me
closely. Do I look like a man in need?”
“Poor man, help yourself to a
crumpet.”
“Seriously,” I said, “can you lend
me five bob” I can't pay the Food
Tax.”
“Abs. imposs,

“To think,” I said, “that I cannot

“Charles,” said Christine severely,
“would not have done this evil thing.”
“Any way,” I said, “they can't tear
the muffins from us. You have seen
to that.”
Christine sighed.
“There are ways,” I said, “dark and
devious ways, known only to a chosen
few, of extricating oneself from such
quandaries.”
“You can't hurry out absent-mindedly
with the bill in your hand here,” said
Christine. “You pay the waitress, not
at the desk.”
“I must fall back on cards,” I said,
taking no notice of her. “It is a pity
that all those in my case at the
moment are other people's. Ah!” I
said, glancing over them, “here is one,
with the Athenæum Club on the corner.
This should keep Scotland Yard at bay

She did not move.
“Leave me,” I said, “to face this

finished tea 2"
Christine ignored my remark, though
it was meant kindly.
“I shall stand by you,” she said.
“May I hold your hand,” I asked,
“when the supreme moment arrives?
I am just going to ask for the
Manageress.”
“I shall stand–er—just near the
door,” said Christine, “in–in case ->
While Christine was standing by

waited the coming of the Manageress.
Happening to feel in the left-hand top

When I rejoined Christine, she said,

“My dear child,” I said, “what do
you mean? I paid the bill, of course.
I was only testing your courage.”
“I shall have tea with Charles next

trousers conveniently roomy

the ablest, most successful

his time, talents and energies
to what he honestly believes
to be the welfare of his
country. For this reason his
biting sarcasm, his thunder-
ing denunciation of Home
Rule and all concerned in its propaga-
tion were, with one deplorable exception,
listened to on the Ministerial Benches
with respectful forbearance.
Nevertheless they gave tone to debate

he concluded with pious fervour,
“I commend them all to God.”

enthusiastically cheering the PREMIER
as he passed out.
Business done.—Home Rule
read a second time.
Friday.—“Lycidas is dead!" Not
ere his prime but in its very fulness,
which makes the sudden end more
tragic. On Monday, when House was
crowded in anticipation of renewal of
long waged fight round Home Rule
for Ireland, news came that GEORGE
WYNDHAM lay dead in a Paris hotel.
The Irish question was intimately
bound up with the threads of his
political life. A sudden turn fatally
entangled them, arresting forward pro-
gress that seemed to lead to loftiest
plane of political ambition.
A cynical fate that news of his sudden
cutting off should have enforced prelude
of personal regret on part of PRIME
MINISTER and LEADER of OPPosition
rising to confront each other across the
Table on the war-worn theme. It was
chivalrous attempt to solve this ques-
tion whilst he was still Chief Secretary
for Ireland that roused Ulster to storm
of resentment before which the descen-
dant of Lord Edward FITzGERALD fell,
not to rise again to his former position.

manner, and might, had life been
spared and his Party recaptured their
old predominance, found his fortunes
re-established. But
Comes the blind Fury with the abhorrèd
shears -
And slits the thin-spun life.
PRINCE ARTHUR, who in faltering
voice echoed the PREMIER's lament,
“Silver-tongued Augustine.”
(Mr. BIRRELL.)
spoke of his lost friend's “great literary
and imaginative powers, which had
never received their full expansion and
their full meed of praise, perhaps their
full theatre in which to show them-
selves.” GEoRGE WYNDHAM, the public
are apt to forget, if indeed they ever
knew, was, in addition to being a
statesman, a poet and a prose writer of |g
distinction.
Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.

Not enough for us. One billiard-room

From an Examination Paper:-
“The Renaissance was inaugurated by the
invention of printing and of gunpowder which
put an end to the Middle Ages.”
“Ceci tuera cela,” as Victor HUGo said
of printing in relation to architecture;
but gunpowder is, of course, still more
effective.
A WEAPON.
“Who was that ?" demanded my
wife as I returned to the luncheon
table after seeing my visitor off at the
garden gate. -
“It was a railway man.”
“It didn't look like a railway man.
It was much too splendid.”
I glanced carelessly at a card which
I still held in my hand.
“He came from the head office,” I
remarked, trying not to lay any stress
upon the fact. But I ought to explain
that we live in a very quiet way and
this sort of thing does not often happen
to us. As I anticipated, my wife was
considerably impressed.
“Do you think he was a Super-
intendent or something?”
“Either that or a General Manager,"
said I. -
“What did he want?”
“It was purely a business matter,”
said I. “I don't suppose it will
interest you. The water at the station
cottages has been condemned and he
wished to consult me about a new
supply. They want to tap our pipe at
the top of the lane and take it from
there.”
“Cheek 1" said my wife, bridling.
(I think that is what they call it. My
wife often does it.)
“I don't know,” said I mildly, “that
it need necessarily be classed as cheek.
We happen to have the only decent
supply in the parish and I don't
suppose he can get it anywhere else."
“So you mean to tell me,” said my
wife with much deliberation, “that
he waits till we have brought water
down off the hill at enormous expense
and then calmly has the face to sug-
est 1 *
“I didn't tell him he could have it.”
“Well, I should hope not.”
“But I don't see why he shouldn't,”
I added. -
My wife suddenly launched into a
denunciation of the Great Scottish
Railway. “It's just like them ' " she
said. “They never will do anything
for themselves. They won't build
cottages or repair the old ones, and you
know perfectly well that you have had
trouble for years about their polluting
the stream that goes through the
meadow, and the station is filthy and
not properly lighted, and they lost that
portmanteau of Uncle Robert's seven
years ago, and the train service is
abominable and getting worse.”
“There's plenty of water to go
round,” said I, “and of course they
will have to pay a reasonable price for
it.”
“Reasonable!" said my wife scorn-
fully. “This isn't a case for anything

reasonable. Why, can't you see that
you have got them in your power at
last 2 ”
“How 2 ”
“They must have the water. Don't
you see that you can squeeze them 2"
That gave me food for thought.
There was something arresting in the
idea of squeezing the Great Scottish
Railway Company. And, as I have
said, we live in a quiet way.
“What did you say to the man?”
“I said I would consider it and let
him know.”
“Well, write and tell him that if he
will stop the London express—”
“I don't suppose that that is his
department, exactly.”
“Nonsense. The whole thing must
hang together. Come into the other
room and work it out. People can't
expect water for nothing.”
On looking back upon it now, I see
that my wife succeeded in over-riding
my better judgment that afternoon.
I am not by nature a blackmailer.
The following was the schedule of our
minimum demands:–
º An annual royalty of £6 17s. 9d.
to be paid—being a poor interest upon
my outlay in bringing the water from
the hill.
(2) The London express to be stopped
by signal on due notice being given.
(3) Full compensation for the loss of
Uncle Robert's portmanteau.
(4) Seven new lamps to be placed at
the end of the platform in the station
and duly maintained.
(5) The short cut from our house
along the line to be legalized.
“But we mustn't be too selfish about
it,” said my wife at this point. “I
wonder if we should put in an eight-
hour day for the porters?” We did
not include that, however, but de-
manded repairs for the station cottages.
There came a postcard in reply,
announcing the arrival of our esteemed
favour. And after that there was a
long pause. I wrote once asking if a
decision had been arrived at, but had no
reply. After five weeks we began to
compromise. I wrote and said that I
would not press for more than five
station 1amps. Ten days later we
threw over the cottage repairs and the
short cut. There was still no reply,
and the strain was telling upon us.
Even my wife became more conciliatory.
“Uncle Robert's portmanteau will
have to go,” she announced one
morning at breakfast.
“As a matter of fact,” I pointed out,
“as long as we can get our royalty
it means that the Great Scottish is
paying for our water supply. Don't
you think—”
“They must stop the London ex-
press,” said my wife severely.
A week later, without saying any-
thing to my wife, I wrote and with-
drew our remaining stipulations except
Number One. The truth is that I had
seen in the distance something going
on at the station that I didn't like the
look of.
After another month we heard from
the General Manager at last. He
wrote to say that the new artesian well
was working satisfactorily, and under
the circumstances he need trouble me
no further in the matter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CURE.
WHEN Richard and Henry came
back from Brittany last week I had, of
course, heaps of things to tell them.
I pictured to myself their happy up-
turned faces, their ready smiles, their
enial interest. -
But I had forgotten the curse of the
Returned Traveller; I had forgotten
that the chief cause of nostalgia is the
passionate desire to inflict a tale of
petty happenings on long-suffering
friends at home; I had forgotten–I
have forgotten what I had forgotten.
They began with their adventures—
the crossing, that was pronounced by
the sailors to be the worst since the
winter of ’79; the waiters, who had
answered halting French in flowing
English; the price of English tobacco,
and, on the contrary, the price of
French wine; together with a tedious
résumé of trifling dangers and difficulties
of transport. - " -
When my interest visibly flagged,
they produced from their pockets tram
tickets from Dinard, French matches
from St. Malo, and lumps of mortar
from the walls of Dinan keep.
Next day they began to unpack the
picture postcards, and I left the house
in a hurry. I felt somehow that
Richard was going to describe them as
an interesting record of an enjoyable
trip.
I stayed away all the afternoon.
Late in the evening I returned with an
air of secrecy and pockets crowded with
mysteries.
Richard and Henry looked up from
a map of France.
“Where have you been 2" asked
Henry casually. I strode to the fire-
place, turned my back on it firmly and
began :
“I have been abroad (sensation) to
Shepherd's Bush (derision), and now
that you have quite finished the relation
of your interesting, your very interesting
adventures, I'm sure you will be glad
to hear of mine.”
I began with the adventures—the
curiously shaped train that had stopped
at every station; the humorous re-
partee of the apple-barrow man to the
chauffeur outside the terminus—a little
story which as I told it lost but little
through my having forgotten the
repartee itself; my difficulty in using
one ticket on two trams, although the
total distance covered did not exceed
half a statutory kilometre.
I produced the ticket and passed it
round, and then hurried on to other
trophies. One middling large lump of
brickwork from a wall adjacent to Worm-
wood Scrubbs Prison; one receipted bill
from an Italian restaurant where I had
consumed a custard áclair and three
feet of the finest spaghetti; one small
packet of Shepherd's Bush tobacco,
which I had brought back without
paying an excessive duty.
I then passed to my postcards.
They were, I am sorry to say, only
perfunctorily enthusiastic over two
really artistic photochromes of the
Cinema do Luxe and the Electric Palace.
These failed to grip them, even when I
translated the title of the former for their
benefit, and waxed exegetical over the
finer points of their early Georgian
construction.
But I had yet a trump.
“This,” I said, “is the free library.
Its architecture speaks for itself. But
this card has an interest over and
above the building.”
“A biplane?" asked Richard sadly.
“If so, you've bought the wrong card.
It's not in this one.”
“I spoke figuratively,” I said.
“Actually, the interest is that rather
good-looking young man standing to
the left of the gate. No, it isn't me,
Henry. I said ‘rather good-looking.'
Now I must ask you to cast your
minds back to June, 1910. No doubt
you will remember seeing a poster of
Suburban Opinion : “Shepherd's Bush
Reader Wins £102 13s.5d, in Muddles."
Well, this is the Shepherd's Bush
reader. I bought the card from the
man himself; indeed, I had quite a
long talk with him. He set up in the
stationery line, and throws himself in
with all local photographs he has
taken.”
They were now so dispirited that I
was able to unveil a map of the district
and spread it on the table without
evoking a protest. But when I took
out a box of pins with red, white and
blue china tops the worms turned. By
the space of several minutes they said
hard and unjust things to me; and,
though there is peace once more, we
do not mention Shepherd's Bush now-
adays.
Neither, however, do we make refer-
ence to Brittany.

CALCULATED ARGUMENT.
[“The youngest child of a family is hard to
convince. His is the accumulated experience
of his elders.”—Recent Novel.]
SHE seemed . . . well, let me put it
thus
(My Muse has ever tact in plenty):
I feared her years were thirty plus,
While mine were barely five-and-
twenty.
And so, although my callow heart
Went out to her in fond devotion,
I wondered if 'twere wise to start
The moving of the usual motion.
A horror filled my heart with gloom—
Lest she should reach the sere and
yellow -
While I was still in fairish bloom,
A reasonably youthful fellow.
“Be still,” I said, “O tongue, refrain,
What time my subtle mind engages
In schemings that will ascertain
Approximately what her age is."
Thenceforward when she spoke to me
I only dealt in contradiction;
In disputatious causerie
I struggled to convey conviction.
We argued bacon versus ham,
Pink against purple (this for blouses),
The motor-'bus against the tram,
Commodious flats and country houses.
Were she a Pethick, I would Pank
(Really my views were of the oddest);
I found a gentle charm in swank
Merely from knowing she was
modest ;
But, spite of all that I could do,
My rhetoric with reason glowing,
I could not make her take my view
On any single subject going.
Then o'er my heart there swept a wild,
Wild wave of joy that strangely
moved it;
She plainly was a youngest child,
My failure to convince her proved it.
I knew her brother (twenty-nine);
My hesitating love grew firmer;
In pleading tones I breathed, “Be
mine.”
There came no contradictory murmur.

ALB.
An Obituary.
ONLY an axolotl I Don't the mere
words bring tears into your eyes?
Only an axolotl, I repeat, and if you
ask me what an axolotl is I lay my
hand on my heart and reply that I
don't quite know. It is like a gold-fish,
but its colour is not gold, and scientists
say it is not a fish—an obvious error,
because it lives in water and dies in the
air. If you ate it (but please don't) I
think it would taste like a sardine.
Only an axolotl, I say again (we
are getting on), but his name was Alb
and he was the pearl and prince of
axolotls. Let me picture him as last I
saw him. He was, to the unapprecia-
tive eye, of plain if not ugly appearance.
The large flat nose (or rather head),
the two enormous ears (fins 2), the
somewhat rotund, mud-coloured body,
did not perhaps make for conventional
loveliness. Yet his features, though
hardly regular enough for perfect beauty,
had about them an expressiveness, a
charm, an—I know not what. They
grew on one.
Alb had simple tastes. An occasional
worm, perhaps a crumb, sufficed him
for breakfast; an occasional crumb,
perhaps a worm, formed his modest
lunch. Tea he disdained, and supper
he did not get. His bowl was furnished
neatly but not luxuriously with sea-
weed, moss, stones and all the appur-
tenances of gold-fishery. He spent his
working day swimming round and round
the bowl, sternly and methodically, from
ten to four. }. he never quite
realised that the bowl was round, but
always thought that if he kept on long
enough he would arrive somewhere.
If this is so, he was the most determined
character I know, and I think he should
be a lesson to us all.
But you will expect some anecdotes
of his sagacity. Living entirely in this
bowl he could not fetch his master's
paper or hold a savage burglar at bay,
or carry a collecting box for an inebriate
dogs' home. Yet he had intelligence
of the domestic kind. He had a perfect
passion for being read to. How often
have I seen Alb, his head protruding,
his fins cocked back, listening with a
rapt expression while his master read
some suitable extracts from The
Spectator. Once I could almost have
sworn he laughed.
If you asked him what he would like
to do to LLoyd GEORGE he rushed wildly
about the bowl. But as he did just the
same to every question (you prodded
him with a stick to make him answer)
this throws little light on his politics.
He would have been a wobbly voter,
would Alb.
Then there was Axiſ Picture to
yourselves a large, beautiful blonde
axolotl, perfectly built, svelte, graceful,
with the utmost of feminine charm.
Having done that, you will have Axi,
Alb's wife. She was worthy of him;
they were worthy of each other. Throw
a crumb to Alb and if Axi got there
first she ate it. Throw one to Axi and
it was the same—I mean it was vice
versa, mutatis mutandis. One evening
a strange axolotl was introduced to the
bowl, dark, beetle-browed, with a
sinister look. Next morning he was
found dead. There are dark pages in
the life of every axolotl.
But Alb is no more. I write these
few lines at the request of his owner,
an unworthy, a feeble appreciation
from one who knew him. When he
died there was not a dry eye in the
bowl. Nay, it overflowed. Nor was
that his only tribute. A very beautiful
Latin inscription was written for him.
“Poor Alb,” I said, as I perused it,
“poor, poor Alb!” It was a good bit
of writing, but it did not do justice to
Alb. Nothing could, Nothing will—
nothing—but pardon me, I grow
maudlin. I will desist. There was a
peroration; but no matter. Alb needs
no peroration.

ANY morning you may meet her
Where the sunlight gilds the strand
And the curlews rise to greet her
As she gallops o'er the sand,
Riding swift, as though a wager's
In the fore-front of her mind,
With a brace of breathless majors
Close behind.
Watch her dole the daily rations,
Watch her scan the butler's book,
Watch her foil the machinations
Of a swart and bearded cook;
Prouder than a queen, sublimer
Than a goddess, see her stand
With a Hindustani Primer
In her handl
When the swift and welcome gloaming
Shrouds the palm-trees and the huts,
And the bullocks, slowly homing,
Loom like ghosts across the ruts;
When the plantain (or banana)
Rocks to rest the drowsy midge,
She'll be up at the gymkhana
Playing bridge.
And it seems a little funny
That not one among us all
Ever danced the “Hugging Bunny”
Or the glad “Crustacean Crawl"
Till she came out East and taught us
Every trick of pose and gait,
Occidentalized and brought us
Up to date.
And our bungalows were gloomy,
There were bats behind the doors,
And the rooms were far too roomy
With their bare and shameless floors,
Till she burst upon our quiet
With her china and her prints,
With the reminiscent riot
Of her chintz.
Would you learn the gladness of her,
Catch the charm before it pass?
Ask the butterflies that hover
Emerald o'er the sun-burned grass;
Ask the paddy-birds that settle
On the crimson-flow'ring boughs,
Or the frangipanni petal
In her blouse.
And I would not have you grudge her
Any pleasure she may wrest
From the wilderness, or judge her
By the standards of the West;
She's a “bold, designing creature”
To the folk who know her least,
But to us—the saving feature
Of the East. J. M. S.
Wait till the Reign stops.
“As reported elsewhere, the Urban Council
on Tuesday evening sent a congratulatory
telegram to his Majesty King George IV., on
the occasion of his birthday.”

FORGOTTEN DEEDS OF VALOUR.
A DEPUTATION OF RESPECTABLE RESIDENTs of CAPREAE wait
ON THE EMPEROR TIBERIUS TO POINT OUT THAT HIS MIDNIGHT
Org IEs GIVE THE ISLAND A BAD NAME AND DEPRECIATE THE WALUE OF PROPERTY THERE.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHEN the Master of a College at Cambridge sits down
to write the story of one who held posts of great authority
in the University, intending readers may think themselves
justified in anticipating a work of academically dignified
dulness. In the case of “J.,” a Memoir of John Willis
Clark (SMITH, ELDER), by A. E. SHIPLEY, Master of Christ's
College, they will, however, be agreeably disappointed.
Mr. SHIPLEY has carried out his task in exactly the right
spirit of affectionate and admiring levity. Being himself
the Head of a House he does not disguise the painful fact
that “J." was consistently in favour of the abolition of
Heads of Houses, “though,” he himself adds, “I never
could see that the poor dears do much harm.” This book
is by no means a merely formal biography. It gives a
vivid and unconventional account of a very remarkable
man who was for many years the life and soul of Cam-
bridge, the adviser, the helper and the indefatigable friend
of many generations of dons and undergraduates. As our
public schools are supposed to produce character, so it may
be said that our universities have earned much fame by
producing characters. “J." was one of these. Everything
he undertook (and his activities were innumerable) he
did well in his own uncompromising way. He wrote books
on books, on architecture, on archaeology; he arranged the
Museum of Zoology; he was Registrar of the University;
he investigated libraries; he was for years the tutelary
genius of the A.D.C.; he was a teller of good stories
and a careful drinker of good claret; and he had bursts
of a Boythornian temper which, though terrific while
they lasted, endeared him the more, if that was possible,
to his friends. As I who write these lines remember him,
he was the embodiment of hospitality, good fellowship and
kindness. I thank the Master of Christ's for this pleasant
record of our common friend, and I recommend it warmly
to all Cambridge men.
When Mr. ALGERNoN BLAckwood, some years ago, first
told me about the ghosts that he had seen I was quite sure
that he was telling me the truth—I was horribly impressed.
Then he began to tell me about fairies, and I enjoyed his
revelations but doubted his sincerity. Finally, in his new
book, A Prisoner in Fairyland, I discover no sincerity and
only a little enjoyment. I hope that he will not write
about fairies again. His prisoner on this occasion is a
hearty middle-aged sentimentalist—ponderously affectionate
by day, ponderously imaginative at night. This gentleman
flies after dark with the simple stolidity of a Slightly; he
is accompanied by children whose sweetness and attempted
fun are painful to witness. “For the children,” we are
told, “night meant play and mischief; for himself it meant
graver reverie.” This “graver reverie” occupies over five
hundred pages, and I should be afraid to calculate the
numbers and numbers of descriptions of stars and moons
and night-skies that those pages contain. The truth is
that Mr. BLAckwood has nothing very new to tell us
about fairies; his narrative is slow in its movement, and
its characters—as, for instance, Minks, the secretary-are
spoilt by a sentimentality worthy of DICKENs. He has been
too long “a prisoner in fairyland,” and I believe that he

comedy. That indeed is
my, only ground of com-
plaint against Mrs. Hugh
FRASER and Mr. HUGH
FRA's ER, that, having
started a tale of pleasant
artificiality about a gay
cavalier, a charming
maiden, a kindly abbé, a
scheming servant, and in
short all the usual cast
for a costume romance,
they should suddenly
have turned to what is
almost tragedy. I felt
also that the pleasantly
prattling style, so well
suited to what the story
seemed about to be, was
hardly robust enough
when it came to omens
and shrieking *gills
and a villain with his
face smashed. All these
things you get before the
finish. The villain in question was M. Le Grange—the
personable young man to whom I had so taken in the opening
chapter—and his behaviour towards the little Héloïse was by
no means what I had hoped from his appearance. But in
the end, as you will see, he got his deservings; and perhaps,
as I had never believed in any of the characters save as
pleasantly-dressed figures in a tushery show, it need not
have worried me. Still, I admit I prefer that in an affair of
this fashion as little sawdust should be spilt as possible.
When four people find themselves shut up for eight days
in a quarantined house, it is perhaps unreasonable to expect
them to do anything very much except talk, and I ought,
no doubt, to have borne more patiently with the deluge of
conversation poured forth in these circumstances by the
characters in Middleground (MILLs AND Boon), the new
novel by the anonymous author of Mastering Flame. His
theme certainly lent itself to much conversation. The
position was as follows: Louis Pembroke was on the
point of eloping with Mrs. Comber. Enter Mrs. Comber to
chat over their plans. Enter John Brent, former lover of
the lady, to announce that he knew all; and on his heels
enter Mr. Comber, who also knew all, and wanted to know
what was going to be done about it. At this point the

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
DANCES AND DoGs.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,-Hostesses have
been up against a quite quite novel
difficulty this season—the scarcity of
girls at parties! Isn't that a deliciously
funny idea? It comes about through
some of the oldest inhabitants not
allowing their girls to do the Chim-
panzee Cuddle and the Mexican Mix-up.
The Duchess of Dunstable is one of
these, and poor Francesca and Frederica
have had a perfectly rotten time in
consequence. They were both asked
last week to a kick-up at Beryl Clarges',
where things are generally made to
hum. The old duchess refused, and
arranged to take them to a ghastly
scientific soirée-you know the sort of
fearful function—tea and coffee and
lemonade, and information while you
wait! Franky gave in meekly, as she
always does, but Freckles nursed rebel-
lious thoughts and planned deep plans.
Among old Dunstable's other moss-
grown habits and customs, she keeps
up the childish punishment of sending
the girls to bed early if they ever cheek
her or answer her back. At dinner on
the night in question, Freckles was
particularly argumentative, and the
more her mother repressed her the
more she wouldn't be repressed. At
last she flatly contradicted her stately
parent. The latter got out the frown
she keeps specially for Freckles and
put it on. “You know what your
punishment is,” she said after an
awful silence. “You will go straight
to your room on leaving the table.”
In due time she dragged off Franky to
science and sighs, and, as soon as they ||
were off the premises, Freckles, instead
of going to her penitential couch, put
on her prettiest dance frock and went
in a taxi to Beryl's, where she enjoyed
herself hugely. - -
Unluckily, old Lady Humguffin, who's
everybody's third cousin or first aunt
once removed, met the Duchess of
Dunstable next day, and said, “I looked
in at my great-niece, Beryl Clarges',
last night and found she'd a party of
young people. What extraordinary
dances they do nowadays, to be sure
I don't know when I've laughed so
much Your Frederica seemed particu-
larly au fait at a dance called the
Chimpanzee something-or-other.”
“My Frederica!!” gasped old Dun-
stable. “My Frederica was at home–
in bed '''
“I daresay you do,” rejoined the
Humguffin, who's deafer than twenty
posts; “but I think it's hardly wise
for you to do such violent dances at
your age.”
The engagement of Peggy Sandys,
the Ramsgates' younger girl, has come
as quite a great little surprise, except
to those behind the scenes. She came
out last wear and made an instant
Success. §. 's one of those girls who
happen now and then (your Blanche
was one of them once upon a time),
who are proposed to by almost every-
one, and are quite tired of saying No.
She has the young girl's funny trick of
having ideals and being in earnest, and
has let it be understood that the men
of to-day don't come near her standard.
Her granny, Popsy, Lady R., tells
people that, at eighteen, she was
exactly like Peggy herself. But, in
spite of the fearful prospect thus
opened, the girl goes her conquering
way. I can best describe her by telling
you that half the women say, “I can't
imagine what people see in that girl!”
and the other half say, “Pretty? She
hasn't a feature in her face, my dear.”
When those things are said on all sides,
you may know the lucky child has
quite quite got there ! Passe pour
cela. -
At a boy-and-girl dance at the Middle-
shires' one night, Peggy was doing a
sit-out with Lolly follyott (Ninny's
brother). Their chat began by Lolly
proposing once more and being refused.
Then they went on to talk Pekingese
—they're both ardent owners and
exhibitors of the little butterfly-dogs;
and so they got to the Age We Live In,
and Peggy pronounced it an age abso-
lutely incapable of heroism.
“Why, look at you all,” she said ;
“you men of to-day, compared with
the knights of old who died for their
lady-loves | "
“Don’t be rough on us,” pleaded
Lolly. “The knights of old got their
chance at tournaments and things, and
there ain't any real tournaments any
longer. But, if the idea is that we're
to die for you, you’ve only got to ask
us to cross the road—that 's almost
certain death now.”
But Peggy wouldn't listen. “The
age of heroism is dead,” she persisted.
“Not one of you is capable of an
heroic act.”
Next week was the Dog Show at the
Floricultural Gardens, Peggy Sandys
carried off everything with her peky-
peky, Ming-Ming the 23rd. The little
champion was quite the centre of
attraction, sitting thoughtfully in a big
satin-lined jewel-case, with mounted
police all round him and Life-guards
beyond the police—in case of foul play.
Peggy, dressed in muslin and smiles,
was seated near by, and Lolly came up
to congratulate her.
“Thanks awfully,” said Peggy.
“Yes, I'm frightfully proud and happy
to-day. But why aren't you showing
You've some good ones, haven't you?"
“Yes, I've some good ones,"
answered Lolly, looking wistfully at
Ming-Ming the 23rd and his mounted
police and Life-guards; “but I ain't
showing any of 'em to-day. I say.
look here, I wish you’d come to tea at
my place to-morrow and have a look at
'em—I'd like your opinion.” Peggy
said she'd go, and, as she's very
independent and quite a law unto her-
self, she did go.
“They're all nice little thingy-
things,” said Lolly, as he showed her
his doglets, “but Confucius is the best.”
Peggy darted forward to examine
Confucius; then she gave a scream
(if she'd lived fifty years ago she'd
have fainted), and turned upon Lolly.
“Why,” she gasped, “he's got all the
points—and more than all.” .
“Yes, I know,” said Lolly sadly.
“He’s got 'em all—and a bit over.
His eyes bulge a weeny bit more than
Ming-Ming's, as you see, and his brow
is a teeny bit more thoughtful; and
then he ’s the extra toes.”
“And yet you didn't show him 2"
cried Peggy. “Are you mad 2 ”
“No, Peggy, I ain't off my chump,"
said Lolly; “I didn't show him—
because -> -
A light broke on Peggy. “I see;
you didn't show him because you didn't
want him to cut out my Ming-Ming.”
“That's about the size of it,”
assented Lolly. “It's nothing to
make a dust about—I–I was glad to
do it—though it did want some doing.”
“I take back all I said the other
night,” cried the enthusiastic Peggy.
“The age of heroism is not dead! No
knight of old ever performed a greater,
nobler action for his lady-love than you
did in keeping back this angel from the
show, so that he shouldn't cut out my
Ming-Ming.”
And now Lolly and Peggy are

persons who try to spoil a pretty little
romance, and these creatures say Peggy
only accepted Lolly to be part owner

[JULY 25, 1913.
PUNCH,
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LIMITATION.
ONCE upon a time there was a trout
who lived in a stream much frequented
by anglers. But though he was of
some maturity and had in his time
leaped at many flies and grown sturdy
on them, they had always been living
creatures and not the guileful work of
man. Hence, although well informed
on most matters, of the hard facts of
fishing he knew only what he had
been told by such of his friends as had
been hooked and had escaped, and from
watching the ancient hooksmith of his
tribe at work in his surgery extract-
ing barbs. For, just as children stand
at the smithy door watching the mak-
ing of a horse-shoe, so do the younger
trout cluster round the hooksmith and
observe him at his merciful task.
This trout was in his way a bit of
a dandy, and one of his foibles was to
be weighed and measured at regular
intervals (as a careful man does at his
Turkish bath), so that he might know
how things stood with him. Fitness
was, in fact, his fetish ; hence, perhaps,
his long immunity from such snares as
half Alnwick exists to dangle before the
eyes of undiscriminating and gluttonous
fish.
But to each of us, however wise or
cautious, a day of peril comes soon or
late. It happened that on the very
afternoon on which he had learned
that he was fourteen inches and a
quarter long and turned the scale at
twenty-four ounces, the trout met with
a misadventure which not only was
his first but likely to be his last. For
seeing a particularly appetising look-
ing fly on the surface of the water, and
being rather less carefully observant
than usual, he took it at a gulp, and
straightway was conscious of a sharp
pain in his right cheek and of a steady
strain on the same part of his person,
pulling him upwards out of the stream.
Outraged and in agony, he dashed
backwards and forwards, kicked and
wriggled; but all in vain; and at last,
worn out and ashamed, he lay still and
allowed himself to be drawn quietly
from the water in a net insinuated
beneath him. In another moment he
lay on the bank beneath the admiring
and excited eyes of a man.
A pair of hands then seized him and
the hook was extracted from his right
cheek with very little tenderness.
It was at this moment that the trout's
good fairy came to his aid, for the man
in his eager delight placed him where
the turf sloped. The trout saw the
friendly stream just below, gathered
his strength for a last couple of despair-
ing struggles, and these starting him on
the downward grade, he had splashed
into the water again before the angler
realised his loss.
For a while the trout lay just where
he sank, motionless, too exhausted to
swim away, listening languidly to what
was being said about him on the bank
by the disappointel angler to a friend
who had joined him At length, having
collected enough power, he swam away
to safety.
That evening, you may be sure, the
trout had plenty to tell his companions
when, after their habit, they discussed
the day's events in a little crowd. There
were several absentees from the circle,
and two or three fish who were present
had swollen jaws where *hooks had
caught and broken away; while one
actually had to move about and eat and
talk with a foot of line proceeding from
his mouth, attached to a hook which
none of the efforts of the profession had
been able to dislodge.
“But the thing that bothers me,”
said our trout, as he finished the recital
of his adventures for the tenth time,
“is men's curious want of precision.
It is true they don't carry scales about
with them as we do, but they oughtn't
to make shots so wide of the mark. Not
with all their advantages, they oughtn't.
Look at their powers. Fishing rods and
tackle and false May flies are alone a
pretty good proof either that they have
too many brains or we too few ; but
then there are all the other things.
There's telegraphy and the telephone,
phonography and the cinema; there's
SHARSPEARE, photography, MICHAEI,
ANGELo, and all the rest of it. Surely
with such a record men ought to be
able to do a little thing like guessing
pretty nearly accurately the weight and
length of a trumpery fish ' Yet, while
I was lying there in the water getting
back my strength, I distinctly heard
the fellow who had had me in his
hands but had lost me, telling his
friend that I was two feet four if I was
an inch, and weighed not an ounce
under three pounds.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CH
ARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE FAUN.”
ONE is familiar enough with the case
of the Arabian djinn or of the Egyptian
mummy revived and projected into
modern stage-society, there to find
many inventions and modes of speech
and thought undreamed of in their
philosophy of the remote past. The
initial difficulty, for which a generous
allowance is always made by the
audience, is to give a colouring of
probability to the resurgence of these
antiques. Mr. KNOBLAUCH makes little
attempt to account for the survival of
his faun in the Italy of to-day; but
his appearance in England is explained
on the following grounds. He seems
to have been studying the works of
SHELLEY and, having acquired the
language, he comes over to England
to make the better acquaintance of a
country that produced a poet so con-
genial to a child of Nature.
His first experience does not promise
well, for the young gentleman from
whose geraniums he emerges has just
returned from dropping £70,000 at the
races, and obviously has little in com-
mon with the author of Hellas.
However, as soon as the faun has
doffed his unconventional skin-coat
and got a little accustomed to the
irritating coercion of twentieth-century
dress, he proceeds gaily enough to the
preaching of his gospel of Nature and
natural selection; and the rest of the
play—apart from some negligible dis-
tractions—is a sort of paganized
version of The Passing of the Third
I'loor Back.
There is an attractive freshness in
the idea; but I venture to think that
Mr. KNOBLAUCH has made one or two
errors of judgment. It is true that the
anthropomorphic imagination of the
Greeks, seeking a symbol for certain
forces of Nature, gave to the faun a
human shape. (The Greeks, of course,
called him a satyr, but the faun of the
Romans, a variety of their Faunus, god
of farmers, came to be identified with
the Greek type. Pardon this pedan-
try). But, if more or less human in
shape, in attributes he was animal;
and only less bestial than some of the
semi-deities, say, of Egypt, because he
represented those instincts of the ani-
mal world which come closest to the
primitive instincts of humanity. If,
therefore, we attached to the senti-
ments of Mr. KNoHLAUCH's faun the
only meaning that they could con-
ceivably have in a faun's mouth, the
topic all the time was animal instincts.
I am assuming, for the author's benefit,
that he intended his faun to illustrate
the more romantic aspects of love, but
he could hardly expect this conception
of the faun-nature to be accepted by
anyone who thought about the matter
at all, and certainly not by those
who reflected that such aspects were
barely recognised in ordinary life by the
ancients who created this type.
At the end, after arranging the best
part of the cast in couples on the lines
of natural selection, the faun is made
to say that he represented the joy of
life in all its forms; but it was clear
that he had really been insisting—not
without tact, I admit—on one form in
particular—the joy of animal attraction.
In a matter of detail, but a rather
large one, I think the author was at
fault in permitting his faun to play
BACK TO THE LAND.
Mr. MARTIN HARVEY (under cover) emanci-
pates himself from the bondage of civilisation.
the part of a racing tipster. How he
got the inside information which enabled
him to spot the winner for his patron
in every race that he touched I never
thoroughly understood. His unusually
nice sense of smell could hardly account
for this success; and I viewed with
scepticism the alleged activities of the
bluebottle which served as an inter-
mediary between him and the stables:
I do not, of course, cavil at this magic ;
my complaint is that, while in his
homilies he was denouncing the sin of
Worldly greed, he should have given so
much practical encouragement to specu-
lations on the turf.
Another slight flaw was found in the
Suffragette element, which served as
a side issue. It was rather vieux jeu.
The author seemed to have written his
play several years ago, and not revised
it in the light of the latest develop-
ments of militancy.
I cannot say that Mr. MARTIN
HARVEY in his skins recalled very
closely any known representation of the
faun in antiquity. Mr. FRASER OUTRAM,
who piped and danced in Mr. MAURICE
HEwleTT's Callisto, came much nearer
to the type. But as Prince Silvani (the
title assumed by the faun) Mr. HARVEY
suggested rather effectively the irk-
someness of human clothes to a creature
of the woods; and many of his move-
ments and poises were in the right faun
manner. And it is something to his
credit that the air he had of pure joy
in living, and making others live, lent
a note of innocence to what might
otherwise, without intention on the
author's part, have been unpleasantly
near to animalism.
Of the other Mr.
actors, FRED
LEwis bore with great good-nature the
reflections passed by the faun on his
rotundity. Mr. BASIL HALLAM was a
pleasant figure as young Lord Stonbury,
and went through the preparatory
stages of suicide—never a very eligible
subject for light handling—with suf-
ficient callousness. But, as no hero
ever kills himself in the First Act, we
allowed his courage a generous dis-
count.
Miss MADGE FABIAN, who played the
ultimate lady of his choice, gave an
excellent account of herself as a good
fellow with a fine disregard for senti-
ment; but I was very sorry for her
when she was required to confess the
latent instincts of sex by swooning in

assured her later that he had done it
vicariously on behalf of the man she
loved (who had not been consulted in
the matter), still it looked rather bad ||
at the time.
Both Miss MURIEL MARTIN HARVEY }
and Mr. STAFFORD HILLIARD (as a
futurist) threatened at the start to be
amusing, but they too became victims
of the faun's incurable passion for
pairing people off, and degenerated into
common romantics.
Up to a º the play was fairly
intriguing, for you never quite knew
what the faun was going to do next.

and a gay fantasy showed in some of
the decorations; but there were surfaces
also of rather dull plaster. Still the
freshness of the scheme remains, and I
thank Mr. KNoBLAUCH for that. O. S.

IUMINous LETTERs.
THE revision of our Imperial nomen-
clature suggestcd by Mr. HARcourt, in
his speech at the Corona Club on
Tuesday the 17th, has elicited a num-
ber of interesting letters from various
notable and notorious publicists.
Professor Sir HUBERT voN HER-

modestly deprecated the substitution of
“Lululand” for “The East African l’ro-
tectorate.” For my part I can see no
objection to the change. I should
certainly have adopted it in his place.
Captain CRAIG writes: As the re-
naming of portions of the Empire is
now being seriously discussed by the

I beg to suggest that the Orange Free
State Province might very fittingly be
re-christened “Carsonia,” to commemo-

altering the name of the former to

CELEBRATED TRIALS.
W. REx v. SLATTERY.
Martha Slattery, described as a spinster of no occupation,
was brought up on an indictment charging her (1) with
having wilfully abstained from setting fire to or otherwise
consuming or wiping out one of the statutory Golf Club
Pavilions built in pursuance of the provisions of the Act for
the Erection of Destructible Edifices; (2) with being an un-
suspected person found at large without intention to burn.
Mrs. Knightley, K.C., and Miss Stoker appeared for the
Crown. The prisoner was undefended by counsel.
Mrs. Knightley, in opening the case for the Crown, said
the prisoner came of a good Irish family, but had for many
years been settled in London, where she lived in a small
way on an annuity of £150. She spent her time and a part
of her income in advocating the cause of homeless dogs and
in taking occasional charge of certain nephews and nieces
of tender years whose mother had suffered the loss of a leg
in a motor-bus accident. Though she had had a good
education, having indeed resided for three years at Girton
College, where she had secured first-class honours in the
Moral Science Tripos, she had never taken any part in the
movement for the enfranchisement of women by violence.
She had refused to belong to the Flames Club.
Prisoner. 1 was never asked. They put me up for
election without telling me and then pilled me.
Mrs. Justice Catmus. What is “pilling” 2
Mrs. Knightley. “Pilling,” my Lady, is a process em-
ployed by certain clubs and similar associations for declining
the company of those whom they consider unworthy.
Her Ladyship. The word is not familiar to me.
Mrs. Knightley. That would be so, my Lady.
The Prisoner. It was like their impudence to pill me
when they knew that nothing would induce me to become
a member of their silly club.
Her Ladyship warned the prisoner that no good could
come of these interruptions, the only effect of which was
to damage her case. She (the learned Judge) was prepared
to give considerable latitude in view of the prisoner's not
having counsel to defend her, but there must be a limit to
indulgence, and that limit had now been reached.
Mrs. Knightley, continuing, said the prisoner had had
every chance. Many pavilions, country houses, and grand
stands had been placed at her disposal, but she had refused
to touch any of them, and had accompanied her refusal
with contumelious expressions which had seriously offended
many of her fellow-women. Her Ladyship would remember
that before the passage of the Act there had been formed a
benevolent society composed of those who, in the words
of JUSTINIAN, “suffragia sive combustione sive malleis
appetunt.” This society still existed, though with a
diminished sphere of usefulness, and its Committee had on
more than one occasion remonstrated with the prisoner on
her inactivity and lack of loyalty to the fundamental
principles of the Cause. It had all been in vain. She
might remind the ladies of the jury that under the provi-
sions of the Act two thousand pavilions were built every
year, the cost being a first charge on the Consolidated
Fund. It was necessary that all these should be duly
burnt before the 31st of December of each year, and the
combustionists were selected by inspectresses appointed
under the Act.

Mrs. Knightley. The Legislature recognised the high moral
value of such burnings and for that reason, as the preamble
stated, had decided to perpetuate them and make them part
of the normal life of the State.

levity is unbecoming. -
The prisoner addressed the Court at great length on her
own behalf. She said she quite realised the gravity of
breaking the law, but her principles compelled her, and
whatever the government might do to her she intended to
go on not burning pavilions to the end of her life.
After the Judge had summed up against the prisoner, the
jury immediately found her guilty, and she was sentenced
to a year's detention in the crater of Vesuvius.

OUR CANDID CRITIC
AT LAST SUNDAY's CHURCH PARADE.
THE fine weather encouraged a notable display of fashion |
in the Park on Sunday. Seldom have we seen anything
more ridiculous than the figure cut by Lady Southford,
who should know by this time that purple doesn't suit her.
Mrs. Freischutz called for no particular comment, but her
lanky daughter, Baba, should remember her size in shoes
before affecting a tight hobble. Colonel Dandrough was
hardly less humorous in a tight blue frock coat that would
have delighted the heart of GEorgE Robey. The Hon.
Mrs. Bargess evidently felt the heat, and, had her dress-
maker allowed her, would doubtless have patronised a chair.
Mrs. Dumbarton Scott was not in good voice, and probably
not more than half the people in the Park heard her inform
Captain Maddison (whose tie was an insult to the public)
that her husband had appendicitis. A ridiculous pug was
leading the Countess of Camperdown into all sorts of trouble,
and had it taken her right out of the Park it would have
shown intelligence as to what is not the correct costume
for a lady of fifty-five summers. Dear old Lady Titherinton
was gambolling among her many friends in a gown of crushed
strawberry, while Madame de Bouillon looked especially
foolish in a hat that might go far to upset the Entente.
There are some necks that make us thankful for the open
neck craze. Miss Ponter's is not one of these, and the two
Miss Croucher-Brownes should remember that, however
shapely theirs may be, Hyde Park at mid-day should not
be mistaken either for the Opera House or the Waters
of Trouville. Altogether an amusing pageant not without
its pathos.

A TEMPLE FLOWER-SHOW.
Not to go to the Temple Gardens
on one of these summer evenings to
see the Temple Flower Show is to
miss a feature of the London season.
I’ven though you dress in your best
and fill your pockets with gold, you
will not find it easy to get inside the
gardens; the fuller your purse and the
more glorious your rainent, the greater
will be your difficulty in gaining
admission. The Benchers have in
effect ruled that unless you are some-
thing under five feet tall, with clothes
whose glory has departed from them,
and with nothing in your pockets but
bits of string, cigarette pictures, portions
of knives and pencils, tin boxes, odd
buttons and treasures of that kind, you
must stay without. But you can see
through, and the whole show is visible
to anybody who does not mind keeping
his nose close against the railings.
Most of the flowers are wild. A
splendid crop of scarlet runners is on
view. One evening last week, I saw
one of them hit a four perilously near
to a K.C.’s window, and he ran them
out as if a policeman were behind him.
You will see climbers in great variety;
it is one porter's work to keep them
from going up the bank after the
fuchsias and geraniums. I caught sight
of a very pretty little creeping Jenny
taking cover behind a big tree on her
way “home,” while her pursuer sought
her in an altogether wrong direction;
and all this, remember, within sight
and sound of the L. C. C. trams.
“Rowsie, come 'ere, you norty girl,
'relse the gentleman 'll 'ave you,” called
a mother's help to her charge; and
thus I learned that one of the most
fascinating exhibits was a rose. Ladies'
slippers were not so plentiful as might
have been expected, the reason being
that to run barefoot upon the grass is
the pleasantest way. But away from
the groups, in a corner by herself,
surrounded, no doubt, by fairies which
she alone could see, there was a little
pink columbine, or my eyes deceived me!
Most of them are wild flowers, as I
have said. There are a few of the
more delicate kind, a little sickly-look-
ing, wanting care; but the more they
appear in this Temple show the wilder
they will become.
A little before seven o'clock is a good
rtime to walk from Fleet Street through
the Temple to see the show; do not
make it much later for fear that bedding-
out time should come and cut you off
from your enjoyment of the flowers.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtRAcTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, June 16.
—The MEMBER For SARK, whose sym-
pathies are as wide as his views are
impartial, is elate at new turn of
Opposition campaign. Never since
Parliamentary history was written has
a belated Opposition, weakened by
internal dissension, had such stroke of
luck as beneficent Fortune cast in its
way in connection with Marconi busi:
ness. Their management of unexpected
opportunity was equal to its unexampled
greatness. By skilful nursing, a cloud
no bigger than a man's hand grew to a
magnitude that bleakly overshadowed a
Ministry which, achieving the GERMAN
EMPEROR's desire for his country, had
long kept its place in the sun.
But, as SARK shrewdly points out,
“We can't go on for ever or even for rest
of session harping on one string. In
forthcoming debate the Marconi affair
will reach its climax. To persist in
trotting it out would have effect of
spoiling excellent game. ... The West
End draper having by dint of bold
advertisement done a fine thing in
Spring goods doesn't continue to exhibit
them through June and July. He has
a clearance sale, and with necessary
but slight alteration in text of adver-
tisement brings out his Summer goods.

another connection, may be counted

SHEE makes determined reconnaissance.
Invites PRIME MINISTER to appoint
Committee to examine books of stock-
broker who took advantage of native
simplicity of Master of ELIBANK “with
view of ascertaining whether invest-
ments of Party Funds had been made
in shares of Mexican Eagle Oil Com-
pany.” Gallant Major explained that
he was concerned by fact that this
Company “ had had and was now

circumstantial answers that don't
always turn away intelligent curiosity.
“There is,” he said, “no foundation
for story of investment of Party funds.
There has not been,” he added, “and
is not now any contract between the
Government and the Mexican Eagle
Oil Company.”
In ordinary business assembly that
would seem to knock the bottom out

personal resemblance to the illustrious

anything recognisable in the tone of
voice or manner of speech. The latter
unillumined by any spark of fire of
eloquence that glowed round the ora-
tions of his grandsire, especially when
there was a Church to be disestablished
and disendowed. The House, fairly
full, listened attentively to a modestly
planned, quietly phrased, well reasoned
speech, which obviously carried with it
the weight of sincerity and honest
conviction.

kept their majority up to ninety-

surprise and mortification in Ministerial
camp by frank criticism. He regarded
the measure as too relentless in its de-
structive provisions. Something like a
Cave was then formed. If its inmates
were still active and would go the
length of voting against Second Read-
ing Ministerial majority would suffer
useful set-back. .
GLADSTONE speedily undeceived them.
The compromise he and his friends sug-
gested last year had been rendered im-
possible. f
“The attitude of those representing
the Church on the other side of the
House,” he said, “has been one
of taking everything and giving
nothing. As friends of com-
promise we are bound to do what
we can against the Party most
opposed to compromise."
So the Cave crumbled in, and

having heard statements made
by AT To R N E Y-GENE RAI, and
CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER in
reference to purchase of shares

“accepts their expressions of
regret that such purchases were
made and that they were not
mentioned in the debate on Octo-
ber 11 last, acquits them of acting
otherwise than in good faith, and
tion brought against Ministers,
which have been proved to be
wholly false.”
Strategic move indicated by this
| resolution started yesterday, when
| BucKMASTER, following LoRD BoB, still
implacable in hostile criticism, moved
amendment to resolution submitted
by GEORGE CAve on behalf of Opposi-
tion. Exultant shout went up from
crowded Ministerial benches. It meant
deliverance from grave dilemma. Op-
position resolution cleverly couched in
form designed to net Ministerial bird.
As far as it went it probably broadly
represented general opinion. Whilst
regretting the Stock Exchange trans-
actions of ATToRNEY - GENERAI, and
CHANCELLOR OF ExchEQUER it la-
mented “ lack of frankness in their
communications to the House."
Difficult for Liberals to plump a
negative against declaration thus mod-
erately set forth. But Parliamentary
strategy is a game at which two can
play. CAve's card, at first sight bound
to win the trick, was trumped by
RYLAND ADKINs's with above result.
BoNNER LAw's good generalship in
selection of ground of attack followed
up by admirable choice of Captain to
lead it. GEORGE CAVE, a name not
familiar to readers of: Parliamentary
reports, is one of most precious assets
of Opposition in the Commons. Certain
to obtain high office in next Unionist
Ministry whenever, by , whomsoever,
formed. His speech justified his repu-
tation for lucid argument presented in
judicial form and manner. -
THE AMENDE.
(Sir RUFU's Is AAcs and Mr. LLoyd GEORGE.)
Excellent effect partly nullified by
HELMSLEY's performance in seconding
motion. Whilst audience, thronged from
floor to topmost bench of Strangers'
Gallery, waited for the accused to offer
their defence, the virulent Viscount,
with assistance of portentous bundles of
manuscript, stumbled along for three-
quarters of an hour saying nothing with
wearisome iteration of phrases.
ATToRNEY-GENERAL's speech, when
at length he found opportunity to make
it, was set in a minor key. For
one who, as he said in an eloquent
passage, had for a period of eight
months daily lived among his fellow-
men “conscious of the pointed fore-
finger” his manner was a little mild.
LLoyd GEORGE, following, whilst
equally submissive and regretful
acknowledgment of mistakes made, was
in more militant mood.
In opening sentence it seemed as
if he proposed to carry the war into
the enemy's country. Confession of
desire to “examine the traditions of
the past with reference to the private
connection of Ministers of the Crown
with trading companies holding con-
tractual relations with the Govern-
ment" seemed naturally to prelude
citation of leading case set forth in
Hansard, reporting debate on Address
in session of 1903. There it was
alleged, and not contradicted, that of
Government of the day thirty-
three Members, including eighteen
Cabinet Ministers, held between
them sixty-eight directorships.
On reflection the CHANCELLOR
sheared off, content to remain on
the defensive.
To-day manoeuvring for a place
takes fresh turn. It was PRINCE
ARTHUR who, in emergency re-
asserting his natural place as
Leader of Opposition, showed
the way. In speech equal to
highest effort of former days he
suggested that a form of words
should be adopted permitting
unanimous acceptance. PREMIER
eagerly held out hand to seize
the olive branch extended across
the table. There were consulta-
tions on Treasury Bench and in
his private room. New amend-
ment finally drafted, but, since
it did not express regret of the
House at conduct of Ministers
inculpated, BosNER LAw would
have none of it.
Accordingly, amid scene of in-
tense excitement, House divided;
Resolution quoted above was
carried and will be entered on
Journals of House.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I suppose the Novel with a Purpose to be infinitely the
most difficult of any form of fiction to bring to a successful
issue. It is so hard to mould a piece of special pleading
into the shape of art. One remembers, for example, that
unhappy work, Danesbury House, a story in which character
and plot are alike submerged beneath a flood of alcohol.
Mrs. FRANCIS BLUNDELL has been more fortunate. Her
Story of Mary Dunne (MURRAY) never makes the mistake
of sacrificing probability to purpose; and the result is
a tale all the more moving for its careful simplicity.
Much of what the writer wished to bring about, in the way
of punishment for the scoundrels whose victims are the
Mary Dunnes of real life, has already been done by recent
legislation; but the work is by no means over. I have
spoken of the book as designedly simple; its action is
confined almost entirely to three characters, Mary Dunne
herself, her peasant-lover Mat, and old Father Delaney, the
parish priest, whose simple credulity in obtaining for his
protégée a situation in England and handing over the girl to
a plausible stranger is the innocent cause of her tragedy.
Even Mrs. BLUNDELL has written no more poignant scenes
than that in which poor Father Delaney tries (and fails) to
tell the story of Mary's fate to her uncomprehending mother.
I felt when reading it an emotion of reverence for the writer

who has placed such gifts at the service of a noble cause;
it is a contribution that can hardly fail of its effect.
Before I read Dr. FITCHETT's story of Australia in the
making, The New World of the South (SMITH, ELDER),
I was, whether I knew it or not, at the mercy of any
enquiring child who cared to cross-examine me on the
subject. Had one of these dread searchers after truth
asked me how, why, or even when, we managed to attach
a continent to our Empire, I should have resorted to a
subterfuge and referred him back to his school-boy stories
of the bush, advising him that in this instance the truth
was duller than fiction. As usual in such cases I should
have been hopelessly inaccurate; for the story of Major
Johnston alone, a man who crushed one insurrection in 1804
and carried out another on his own account in 1808, leaves
the average fictitious hero standing, and the tales the learned
author has to tell of the actual careers of the bushrangers
are quite as startling as anything that has been imagined of
them. I approached the work with some reluctance, as
being confessedly historical and matter of fact; but in
supposing that I had something to contend with I reckoned
without Dr. FITCHETT. He has done all the contending, to
produce ultimately a book of the size and price of a novel
and also as easily read and digested. The dates and the
statistics are there, but are kept well in control. If it is
an Englishman's duty to his Empire to get to know it

thoroughly, and his duty to himself to do so in the most
comfortable way, here is the opportunity to begin or, as the
case may be, to finish. -
Having myself a nice taste in short stories, I was espe-
cially glad to welcome so choice a collection of them as
this that Mr. FRANK HARRIs has made under the title of
Unpath'd Waters (LANE). The author has long been
known as among the very few English masters of this
medium, and you will not have read one of the present
series without becoming happily aware that his hand has
not lost its cunning. There is a fine variety of styles and
subjects, but in each the same sense of distinction. Pro-
bably only the reticence of its treatment saves the first,
“The Miracle of the Stigmata,” from the risk of giving
offence; granted the situation, it is handled with exquisite
tact and delicacy. I have, however, a personal preference
for the stories in which Mr. HARRIs can give free play to
his somewhat caustic humour. Perhaps the best of these
| is “An English Saint,” in which the progress of a good-
looking fool, Gerald
Family spectres may always look to me for a cheery
welcome, and when I found that a brown dog was in the
habit of appearing to the Holts at disastrous crises in their
lives I settled down to an earnest perusal of Mr. HALLIw ELL
SUTCLIFFE's The Strength of the Hills (STANLEY PAUL), for
which, on the whole, I think I may say the merits of the
story rewarded me. There are dull patches in the book,
but not so many as to cause a reader to regret having
allowed himself to make the trip to Yorkshire, personally
conducted by Mr. SUTCLIFFE, who by this time has estab-
lished as clear a title to the Haworth Moorland as the
Holts had to Eller Beck Mead. The Strength of the Hills is
the old, but always readable, story of the sport-loving son
who turns his back on sport and goes to work at an
uncongenial but profitable task in order to wipe off a debt
of honour bequeathed to him by his dead father. When
Squire Holt, having duly seen the brown dog, passed from
this world, his son Roger, though not knowing shalloons
from plainbacks, which, as I need scarcely tell you, is like
not knowing tummits from oats, built a mill on Eller Beck
Mead, and did so un-

the book, selected, as
the catalogues say, to suit all tastes; I can only hope that
there may be many more from the same factory
In one respect, at any rate, The Law-Bringers (HopDER
AND Stoughton) is not short measure, for it is nearly four
hundred pages in length, and has about fifty lines on a
page. Mr. G. B. LANCASTER is also lavish of hyphens;
from curiosity I counted the crop on page 23 until I came
to “fine-tooth-combs" and did not know whether it ought
to be recorded as a single or as a brace. The book is
concerned with the lives of the Royal North-West Mounted
Police of Canada, and so plentiful are the dangers through
which the two heroes have to pass that it is greatly to the
author's credit to have preserved them to the end. Relief,
however, from the prevailing atmosphere of jeopardy is
provided in the contrast between the characters of Tempest
and Heriot; indeed, I cannot help thinking that Mr.
LANCAstER is most in his element as a psychologist.
Tempest, with his terrific love for Canada, is a most
admirable study, and attracted me more by the workings of
his mind than by his feats of physical endurance. Never-
theless, we are given so many hairbreadth escapes that
readers who like their heroes to exercise themselves solely
between the frying-pan and the fire must not be alarmed
by my advertisement of Mr. LANCASTER's analytical gifts.
Horace Walpole's World (BELL), suspected some inade-
quacy in her treatment, for she has given her book
the alternative title of A Sketch of Whig Society under
George III.; but even as a “sketch" her book is hardly
justified. She has written certain amusing and well-
informed essays on such subjects as “The Ministers of
George III.,” “Society in France,” “Horry's Duchesses,”
and then clamped them together between two handsome
blue covers. These essays, however, obstinately refuse to
catch either the master of Strawberry Hill or his world.
To anyone who knows nothing of this period very little
solid ground is here to be obtained, whilst for anyone who
knows a good deal there is no fresh discovery nor novel
interpretation. I fancy that Miss GREEN wood has been
worried by the brilliance, the shining humour and vitality
of the famous Letters and has found so much that is
entertaining that she has been bewildered and has lost
the central theme that would have welded her sketches
together. Her pages are never dull, but they have not, at
the end, quite justified their existence. “HoRRY” has,
I think, eluded her, and, smiling, has remained always
just outside her vision. A word of praise must be given to
the excellent illustrations. I like especially the frontispiece,
which shows us the subject of the book more truthfully and
with a finer gaiety than all Miss GREENwood's pages.

MARCONI ECHOES.
It was Henley, and the luncheon-interval drew drowsily to a close.
On the flowery deck of a houseboat, side by side—indeed they had paired for the day—sat two of our statesmen,
full of meat and drink, and in a state of content which had dulled the last lingering doubt as to whether the
Legislature would be able to carry on without them. -
“I wish,” said the Radical, fanning himself with a copy of the anti-gambling Daily News, “I wish I could get
someone to give me decent odds against New College for the Grand.”
“My dear fellow,” said the Tory, “nobody bets at Henley. It is one of the few purely sporting meetings left
to this nation of sportsmen. You must have been reading the Majority Report of the Marconi Committee. It's all for
gambling among politicians. In future any Minister has only got to say that he's been having a flutter on the
Stock Exchange and he becomes entitled to a bucket of FALcon ER's best.”
“I don't see why Ministers shouldn't gamble if they want to. What have their private affairs to do with their
public duties?”
“Well, we pay some of them £5,000 a year not to.”
“No, we don't. We pay them salaries for the work they do. You'll tell me next that a Minister mustn't
marry because marriage is notoriously a lottery.”
“But you wouldn't have approved if HALDANE, say, when he was at the War Office, had married the daughter
of an Army Contractor, would you?”
“No; but then I couldn't have endured to see him marry anybody. To me, he is the perfect type of celibacy—
a lesson to us all !”
“But seriously—we'll grant that your speculating friends in the Cabinet meant no harm, but mightn't they
have been a little more frank about it all?”
“But they were frank. They admitted their mistake when they saw what a mess it had got them into. But
at the time—on October 11th–they naturally wanted to avoid the very appearance of evil. Appearances, as you
know, are so deceptive.”
“I noticed, by the way,” said the Tory, “that, though these Members confessed a sort of regret for their errors,

510 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [JUNE 25, 1913.
it was given out that, if a majority of the House expressed itself as sharing that regret, they were prepared to resign.
How do you explain that?”
“Oh, a very natural and pardonable vanity. They wouldn't care to have their own original views appropriated
by a lot of other people. Besides, when I cry Peccavi, I don't want you to answer, “So you have; I thoroughly agree
with you.’ On the contrary, I expect you to say, ‘Not at all, my dear fellow, not at all.’”
“Which is practically what the majority of the House did say. However, that chapter is closed as far as
Parliamentary verdicts go. But I will just add this parting thrust. When the rest of the scandal has blown
over, LLoyd GEORGE ought still to find his position rather embarrassing. I don't care whether he gambles in
American Marconis or Sumatra Rubber; the point is that you can't preach from pulpits about the horrors of
unearned increment after you've been doing a deal in speculative stock yourself. Unless, of course, he wants to
illustrate his discourses with an awful example in his own person.”
“But why,” asked the Radical, “should you insist on his practising what he preaches? Give me a man
of principles, I say, who knows how to lay down the law; and anybody else can carry it out. I never confuse the
legislative with the executive function. I agree with BRowNING's Ogniben, who had seen three-and-twenty leaders
of revolt. “Ever judge of men,' he says, “by their professions and not by their performance; which is half the
world's work, interfere as the world needs must, with its accidents and circumstances; the profession was purely
the man's own." No, I have no fears for LLoyd GEORGE's future. Besides, he wasn't speculating at all; he was
investing for keeps. He said so.”
“If he meant it for a permanent investment,” said the Tory, “he sold out rather soon—a couple of days or so
later, wasn't it? But take him at his word and say that he intended this speculative stock to be a source of steady
income for himself and family—then, in that case, I find him a shade too guileless. A man who claims to be such
a child in business matters is far too beautifully innocent for a Chancellor of the Exchequer who has to conduct the
financial affairs of the nation. Hullo! Who's the ancient Pierrot in the punt 2 ”
The Radical turned and saw a strange figure: obviously a sage, by his air of philosophical detachment
that contrasted curiously with the gay trappings of masquerade.
Conscious that he was the object of remark the Pierrot rose and addressed them.
“Pardon me, gentlemen,” he said, “if I have involuntarily overheard your conversation. I will not intrude
upon your political differences, for in these matters I make a point of preserving a nice impartiality. But you were
comparing speculation with investment, and here I have strong views of my own. I am in a position to recommend
to you something which is at once a sound investment producing high interest and also a speculative venture
promising a sharp rise in value. Permit me—”
Thereupon Mr. Punch (for his identity now shone very luminously through his disguise) exhibited, amid
a murmur of applause from the surrounding pleasure-craft, his
One jumbrel and forty-fourth tolume."
