COSMETICS: A QUESTION OF TASTE.
HE read his Daily Mail, as I and you,
And scanned the question of the moot cosmetic;
He lent a patient ear to every view,
The ethic, the eugenic, the aesthetic;
The revelations shocked him, for, in truth,
He was a prim variety of youth.
The solemn jeremiads of “M.D.”
And “Anxious Mother" had his approbation;
The sage that kept his anonymity
Beneath the veil of “Nature for the Nation”
Our hero liked. He frankly could not hide
His scorn of those that took the other side.
His sense of rectitude could never brook
The shameless pleas of unrepentant ladies;
To him, they had a Babylonish look;
He saw the cloven hoof, and thought of Iſades;
Yet the conclusion forced upon his wit
Was this, that every woman's doing it.
“Dut no,” he cried, “two rosy cheeks at least
Down to the paint-pot's lure have never knuckled!
Two ruby lips their charm have ne'er increased
With specious art!" His love o'erheard, and chuckled.
She winked a roguish eye, albeit chaste,
And said, “Dear boy! He has no sense of taste!"

Murdoch McGavin to R. Fordham.
- 7th April, 191–.
I have your favour of 3rd inst. in-
dicting me for keeping a dog without a
licence, and suggesting that I should
pay a fine of 5s. to stay further pro-
ceedings. It is true that I overlooked
this matter till 17th March, when you
sent me an official inquiry. I then
took out a licence and intimated the
fact to you. I can only assume that
the charge you make refers to the period
between 2nd Jan. and 17th March.
But as the alleged offence must be
purely a technical one I am at a loss
to understand why you should threaten
me with legal proceedings. It is
perhaps not a wholly irrelevant fact
that my dog died on 27th March, and
that I shall therefore be guilty of keeping
a licence without a dog for fully three-
quarters of the current year. If you
think it necessary to go any further in
this matter, I shall be glad to be
favoured with your observations on
these facts.
P.S.–If I am entitled to a relate for
the unexpired period of my licence,
perhaps you will be so kind as to refer
me to the proper form.
III.
R. Fordham to Murdoch McGavin.
10th April, 191–.
In reply to your letter of 7th April, I
may say that there appears to be no
doubt that an offence was committed.
That being so, the Board are acting
leniently in giving you the option of
IV.
Murdoch McGarim to R. Fordham.
11th April, 191—.
I have to thank you for your letter of
yesterday, and note that you are now
in some doubt whether an offence has
been committed. You say “there
appears to be no doubt,” which shows
that there is room for considerable
dubiety. In these circumstances I am
sorry I cannot agree with you in your
opinion that the Board is treating me
leniently. In my opinion the Board is
threatening purely vexatious pro-
ceedings against a regular taxpayer,
and the suggestion of a Compromise
Fine seems to come perilously near
compounding an alleged felony. You
have omitted to refer me to the proper
form of application for rebate on the
unexpired period of dog licenee, and I
shall be obliged if you will kindly do
this within ten days of the date hereof.
My wife wishes me to add that she
considers it heartless on the part of
your Board to write as you have one
so soon after the death of poor Ponto.
V.
R. Fordham to Murdoch McGavin.
13th April, 191–.
I have to refer you to my letter of
10th April, advising you that, in the
opinion of the Board, an offence has
been committed. The period allowed
for payment of the Compromise Fine
has now expired, but the Board will
accept the fine if sent within five days
from the date hereof.
VI. -
Murdoch McGavin to R. Fordham.
16th April, 191–.
I have your letter of 13th April and
note contents. I must remind you
that you have neglected, in spite of two
inquiries, to refer me to the proper
form of application for rebate on unex-
pired period of dog licence. This is not
in keeping with the usual courtesy of
your Department. If I am entitled to
repayment there would be a small
balance in my favour, even if the
Compromise Fine were legally exigible,
as I am advised that it is not. I make
out that the difference between three-
fourths of 7s.6d. and 5s. amounts to 744. |
This is, of course, without prejudice, and
is not to be founded upon by your Board
as an admission by me of the technical
offence you allege. I shall be glad to
hear from you at your convenience.

THE children of the Opposition

preparatory to acting their original,
topical, pastoral play, entitled The

“Oh! all right, then. Reggie'll have

“Not me,” said Reggie decidedly.
“I'm Carson, and don't you forget it.”
Stern martinet as he was, there
were occasions which rendered Harold
susceptible to the
eontraband articles. Pointing with
incriminating finger at the suspicious
object the Home-Ruler cried, "What
have you in that box, Sir Edward?”
“Rifles,” replied Sir Edward, with
commendable promptitude.
“Silly little ass. You don't say
“Rifles’; you say ‘Bananas' or “Pianos.’
Anything but “Rifles'!”
Then he repeated in the imperious
voice that suited him so well, “What

“Croquet mallets. You know they

“I think not, Sir Edward. Kindly

“Tie him up and brain him,” replied
the other bloodthirsty conqueror.
Meekly, with a smile that tried to
look sad upon his proud young features,
Mr. Redmond submitted to the tying-up
process. That done, his captors pro-
ceeded to burst open the case and
extract a hefty croquet-mallet. Sir
Edward, raising this on high, cast a
questioning glance at Lord Roberts.
The latter, with memories of a certain
lavish cinema display, slowly turned her

Mr. Redmond to turn quickly and for
one brief second to forsake his respon-

LORDS TEMPORAL.
WE have eight clocks, called after
the kind people who gave them to
us. Let me introduce you : William,
Edward, Muriel, Enid, Alphonse, Percy,
Henrietta and John—a large family.
“But how convenient,” said Celia.
“Exactly one for each room.”
“Or two in each corner of the
drawing-room. I don't suggest it; I
just throw out the idea.”
“Which is rejected. How shall we
arrange which goes into which room 2
Let's pick up. I take William for the
drawing-room; you take John for your
work-room; I take ->
“Not John,” I said gently. John
is— John overdoes it a trifle.
There is too much of John ; and he
exposes his inside—which is not quite
nice.
“Well, whichever you like.
on, let's begin. William.” .
As it happened, I particularly wanted
William. He has an absolutely noise-
less tick, such as is suitable to a room
in which work is to be done. I
explained this to Celia. -
“What you want for the drawing-
room,” I went on, “is a clock which
ticks ostentatiously, so that your
visitors may be reminded of the flight
of time. Edward is a very loud
breather. No guest could fail to notice
Edward.”
“William,” said Celia firmly.
“William has a very delicate in-
terior,” I pleaded. “You could never
attend to him properly. I have been
thinking of William ever since we had
him, and I feel that I understand his
case.”
“Very well,” said Celia, with sud-
den generosity; “Edward. You have
William; I have Alphonse for the
dining - room; you have John for
your bedroom; I have Enid for mine;
you—”
“Not John,” I said gently. To be
frank, John is improper.
“Well, Percy, then.”
“Yes, Percy. He is young and fair.
He shall sit on the chest-of-drawers and
sing to my sock-suspenders.”
“Then Henrietta had better go in
the spare-room, and Muriel in Jane's.”
“Muriel is much too good for Jane,”
I protested. “Besides, a servant wants
an alarm clock to get her up in the
morning.”
“You forget that Muriel cuckoos.
At six o'clock she will cuckoo exactly
six times, and at the sixth ‘oo 'Jane
brisks out of bed.”
I still felt a little doubtful, because
the early morning is a bad time for
counting cuckoos, and I didn't see why
Come
“oo” by mistake one day. However,
Jane is in Celia's department, and if
Celia was satisfied I was. Besides, the
only other place for Muriel was the
bathroom; and there is something
about a cuckoo-clock in a bathroom
which—well, one wants to be educated
up to it.
“And that,” said Celia gladly, “leaves
the kitchen for John.” John, as I think
I have said, displays his inside in a
lamentable way. There is too much of
John. -
“If Jane doesn't mind,” I added.
“She may have been strictly brought
up.”
“She'll love him. John lacks reserve,
but he is a good time-keeper.”
And so our eight friends were settled.
But, alas, not for long. Our discussion
had taken place on the eve of Jane's
arrival; and when she turned up next
day she brought with her, to our horror,
a clock of her own—called, I think,
Mother. At any rate, she was fond of
it and refused to throw it away.
“And it's got an alarm, so it goes
in her bedroom,” said Celia, “and
Muriel goes into the kitchen. Jane
comes from the country, and the cuckoo
reminds her of home. That still leaves
John eating his head off.”
“And, moreover, showing people what
happens to it,” I added severely. (Ithink
I have already mentioned John's foible.)
“Well, there's only one thing for
it; he must go under the spare-room
bed.”
I tried to imagine John under the
spare-room bed.
“Suppose,” I said, “we had a nervous
visitor . . . and she looked under the
bed before getting into it . . . and saw
John . . . It is a terrible thought,
Celia.”
However, that is where he is. It is
a lonely life for him, but we shall wind
him up every week, and he will think
that he is being of service to us. In-
deed, he probably imagines that our
guests prefer to sleep under the bed.
Now, with John at last arranged for,
our family should have been happy;
but three days ago I discovered that it
was William who was going to be the
real trouble. To think of William, the
pride of the flock, betraying us!
As you may remember, William lives
with me. He presides over the room
we call “the library" to visitors and
“the master's room " to Jane. He
smiles at me when I work. Ordinarily,
when I want to know the time, I look
at my watch ; but the other morning P
happened to glance at William. He
said “twenty minutes past seven." As
I am never at work as early as that,
and as my watch said eleven-thirty,
stopped. In the evening—having by
that time found the key—I went to
wind him up. To my surprise he said
“six-twenty-five.” I put my ear to
his chest and heard his gentle breath-
ing. He was alive and going well.
With a murmured apology I set him
to the right time . . . . and by the
morning he was three-quarters of an
hour fast.
Unlike John, William is reticent to a
degree. With great difficulty I found
my way to his insides, and then found
that he had practically none to speak
of at all. Certainly he had no regulator.
“What shall we do?” I asked Celia.
“Leave him. And then, when you
bring your guests in for a smoke, you
can say, ‘Oh, don't go yet; this clock
is five hours and twenty-three minutes
fast.’”
“Or six hours and thirty-seven min-f
utes slow. I wonder which would
sound better. Anyhow, he is much too
beautiful to go under a bed.”
So we are leaving him. And when
I am in the mood for beauty I look at
William's mahogany sides and am ||
soothed into slumber again . . . and
when I want to adjust my watch
(which always loses a little), I creep
under the spare-room bed and consult
John. John alone of all our family
keeps the correct time, and it is a pity
that he alone must live in retirement.

It is a regular habit—a kind of stock-

“Half - and - half,” said the plover.

the plover with a wink, “that it was
not the little lady herself who paid for
them. -
“So I laid again,” the plover con-
tinued, “and this time we pulled
through; and this very morning I've
been giving my family a lesson in
taking cover. The difficulty is to make
them keep their silly little beaks shut
when they're in danger: they will cheep
so, and that, of course, gives the show
away. Still, chicks will be chicks, you
know.” -

as taking furnished apartments and
paying for them, and such a thing as

MR. PUNCH'S SEASIDE
NOVELETTE.
[May be read on the pier.]
No. XCVIII.-A SIMPLE ENGLISH
GIRL.
CHAPTER I.-PRIMRose FARM.
PRIMRose Farm stood slumbering in
the sunlight of an early summer morn.
Save for the gentle breeze which played
in the tops of the two tall elms all
Nature seemed at rest. Chanticleer
had ceased his song; the pigs were
asleep; in the barn the cow lay think-
ing. A deep peace brooded over the
rural scene, the peace of centuries.
Terrible to think that in a few short
hours . . . but perhaps it won't. The
truth is I have not quite decided
whether to have the murder in this
story or in No. XCIX.—The Severed
Thumb. We shall see.
As her alarum clock (a birthday
present) struck five, Gwendolen French
sprang out of bed and plunged her face
into the clump of nettles which grew
outside her lattice window. For some
minutes she stood there, breathing in
the incense of the day; then dressing
quickly she went down into the great
oak-beamed kitchen to prepare break-
fast for her father and "the pigs. As
she went about her simple duties she
sang softly to herself, a song of love
and knightly deeds. Little did she
think that a lover, even at that moment,
stood outside her door.
“Heigh-hol” sighed Gwendolen, and
she poured the bran-mash into a bowl
and took it up to her father's room.
For eighteen years Gwendolen French
had been the daughter of John French
of Primrose Farm. Endowed by Nature
with a beauty that is seldom seen out-
side a novelette, she was yet as modest
and as good a girl as was to be found
in the county. Many a fine lady would
have given all her Parisian diamonds
for the peach-like complexion which
bloomed on the fair face of Gwendolen.
But the gifts of Nature are not to be
bought and sold.
There was a sudden knock at the
door.
“Come in,” cried Gwendolen in sur-
prise. Unless it was the cow, it was
an entirely unexpected visitor.
A tall and handsome young man
against a beam as he stepped into
the low-ceilinged kitchen.
“Good morning,” he said, repressing
the remark which came more readily
to his lips. “Pray forgive this intrusion.
The fact is I have lost my way, and I
wondered whether you would be kind
enough to inform me as to my where-
abouts.”
Recognizing from his conversation
that she was being addressed by a
gentleman, Gwendolen curtsied.
“This is Primrose Farm, Sir,” she
said. -
“I fear,” he replied with a smile, “it
has been my misfortune never to have
heard so charming a name before. I am
Lord Beltravers, of Beltravers Castle,
Beltravers. Having returned last night
from India I came out for an early
stroll this morning, and I fear that I
have wandered out of my direction.”
“Why,” cried Gwendolen, “your
lordship is miles from Beltravers Castle.
How tired and hungry you must be.”
She removed a lettuce from the kitchen-
chair, dusted it, and offered it to him.
[Dusted the chair, of course, and offered
some milk." Picking up a pail she
went out to inspect the cow.
“Gad,” said Lord Beltravers as
soon as he was alone. He paced
rapidly up and down the tiled kitchen.
“Deuce take it,” he added recklessly,
“she's a lovely girl.” The Beltraverses
were noted in two continents for their
hard swearing.
“Here you are, Sir,” said Gwendolen,
returning with the precious liquid.
Lord Beltravers seized the pail and
drained it at a draught.
“Heavens, but that was good!” he
said. “What was it 2."
“Milk,” said Gwendolen.
“Milk, I must remember. And now ||
may I trespass on your hospitality
still further by trespassing on your ||
assistance so far as to solicit your help ||
in putting me far enough on my path
to discover my way back to Beltravers |
Castle?” (When he was alone he
said that sentence again to himself, .
and wondered what had happened :
to it.
“I will show you,” she said simply.
They passed out into the sunlit
orchard.
over-ripe; beet-roots were flowering
everywhere.
“You are very beautiful,” he said.
“Yes,” said Gwendolen.
“I must see you again. Listen!
To-night, my mother, Lady Beltravers,
is giving a ball. Do you dance?”
“Alas, not the Tango,” she said sadly.
“The Beltraverses do not tang,” he
announced with simple dignity. “You
valse? Good. Then will you come?”
“Thank you, my lord. Oh, I should
love to l’’
“That is excellent. And now I must
bid you good-bye. But first, will you
not tell me your name?”
“Gwendolen French, my lord.”

lights. At the head of the old oak
staircase (a magnificent example of the
Selfridge period) the Lady Beltravers
stood receiving her guests. Magnifi-
cently gowned in one of Sweeting's
latest creations and wearing round her
neck the famous Beltravers seed-pearls,
she looked the picture of stately magnifi-
cence. As each guest was announced
by a bevy of footmen, she extended her
perfectly-gloved hand and spoke a few
words of kindly welcome.
“Good evening, Duchess; so good of
you to look in. Ah, Earl, charmed to
meet you; you'll find some sandwiches
in the billiard-room. Beltravers, show
the Earl some sandwiches. How-do-
you-do, Professor? Delighted you could
come. Won't you take off your
goloshes?”
All the county was there.
Lord Hobble was there wearing a
magnificent stud; Erasmus Belt, the
ſamous author, whose novel “ Dittel, :
A Romance” went into two editions:

of the Beltraverses—a headless sardine
on a field of tomato. As each new
arrival entered Lord Beltravers scanned
his or her countenance eagerly, and
then turned away with a snarl of dis-
appointment. Would his little country
maid never come 2
She came at last. Attired in a frock
which had obviously been created in
Little Popley, she looked the picture
of girlish innocence as she stood for
a moment hesitating in the doorway.
Then her eyes brightened as Lord
Beltravers came towards her with long
swinging strides.
“You’re here!” he exclaimed. “How
good of you to come. I have thought
about you ever since this morning.
--
There is a valse beginning. Will you
valse it with me?”
“Thank you,” said Gwendolen shyly.
Lord Beltravers, who valsed divinely,
put his arm round her waist and led

begged a polka of her.
“Let us sit this out,”
“Not here—in the garden.”
“Yes,” said Lord Beltravers gravely.
“Let us go. I have something to say
to you.”
Offering her his arm he led her down
the great terrace which ran along the
back of the house.
“How wonderful to have your an-
cestors always around you like this!”
cooed Gwendolen, as she gazed with
reverence at the two statues which
fronted them. -
“Wenus,” said Lord Beltravers shortly,
“and Samson.”
He led her down the steps and into
the ornamental garden, and there they
sat down.
“Miss French,” said Lord Beltravers,
“or, if I may call you by that sweet
name, Gwendolen, I have brought you
here for the purpose of making an offer
to you. Perhaps it would have been
more in accordance with etiquette had
I approached your mother first.”
“Mother is dead,”said the girl simply.
“I am sorry,” said Lord Beltravers,
bending his head in courtly sympathy.

though he too was hoping; and the
only three times that Thomas Ritson
had kissed her she had threatened to
| box his ears.
| “Lord Beltravers,” she began—
“Call me Beltravers,” he begged.
“Beltravers, I love you. I give you
a simple maiden's heart.”
“My darling!” he cried, clasping her
thumb impulsively. “Then we are
affianced.”
He slipped a ring off his finger and
fitted it affectionately on two of hers.
“Wear this,” he said gravely. “It
was my mother's. She was a de Din-
digul. See, this is their crest—a roeless
herring over the motto Dans l'huile.”
Observing that she looked puzzled he
translated the noble French words to
her. “And now let us go in. Another
dance is beginning. May I beg for the
honour?”
“Beltravers,” she whispered lovingly.
CHAPTER IV.-Exposure.
The next dance was at its height.
In a dream of happiness Gwendolen re-
volved with closed eyes round Lord Bel-
travers of Beltravers Castle, Beltravers.
Suddenly above the music rose a
voice, commanding, threatening.
“Stop!" cried the Lady Beltravers.
As if by magic the band ceased and
all the dancers were still. --
“There is an intruder here," said
Lady Beltravers in a cold voice. “A
milkmaid, a common farmer's daughter.
Gwendolen French, leave my house
this instant l”
Dazed, hardly knowing what she did,
Gwendolen moved forward. In an
instant Lord Beltravers was after her.
“No, mother,” he said, with the
utmost dignity. “Not a common milk-
maid, but the future Lady Beltravers.”
An indescribable thrill of emotion ran
through the crowded ball-room. Lord
Hobble's stud fell out; and Lady Susan
Golightly hurried across the room and
murder.
“What!” cried the Lady Bel-
travers. “My son, the last of the
Beltraverses, the Beltraverses who came
over with Julius Wernher (I should say
Caesar), marry a milkmaid?”
“No, mother. He is marrying what
any man would be proud to marry—a
simple English girl.”
There was a cheer, instantly sup-
pressed, from a Socialist in the band.
For just a moment words failed the
Lady Beltravers. Then she sank into
a chair, and waved her guests away.
“The ball is over,” she said slowly.
“Leave me. My son and I must be
alone.” -
One by one, with murmured thanks
for a delightful evening, the guests
trooped out. Soon mother and son
were alone. Lord Beltravers, gazing
out of the window, saw the 'cellist
laboriously dragging his 'cello across
the park.

Old John French sat beneath a
spreading pear-tree and waited. Early
that morning a mysterious note had
been brought to him, asking for an
interview on a matter of the utmost im-
portance. This was the trysting-place.
“I have come,” said avoice behind him,
“to ask you to beg your daughter—
“I HAVE come,” cried the Lady
Beltravers, “To Ask You

ladyship, “TO—”
John French wheeled round in amaze-
ment. With a cry the Lady Beltravers
shrank back.
“Eustace,” she gasped—“Eustace,

“What are you doing here? I came
to see John French.”
“What?”
She repeated her remark loudly
several times.
“I am John French,” he said at last.
“When you refused me and married
Beltravers I suddenly felt tired of

A beautiful double wedding was
solemnized at Beltravers in October,

sides, which partook equally of the

The INFANT SAMUEL, who knows
more about finance than the semi-

described the Irish policy of the Oppo-
sition as “a combination of kicks and
ha'pence.” Whereto Cousin Hugh,
perhaps irrelevantly, retorted, “In deal-

The pertinacious PIRIE, not waiting for
its report, introduces new form. House,
being in Committee on Scotch Estimates,
was as usual almost empty. Denizens
of other parts of still United Kingdom
have so high an opinion of business
capacity of Scotchmen that they in-
stinctively leave them to manage their
own business. The pugnacious PIRIE,
though not unconscious of the compli-
ment, resented its result. If English,
Welsh and Irish Members within call
in case of snap division would not sit
out the debate they should at least be
disturbed in their idle pursuits in tea-
room or on terrace. Accordingly at
half-past four, the very moment when
strawberries, cream and buttered buns
are in most urgent request, he moved
a count.
Members crowded in, “made a
House,” and straightway rushed off,
hoping to find remains of their inter-
rupted meal intact from alien hands.
: “Very well,” said the implacable
PIRIE. “At a quarter to six, I will do
it again."
And he was as good as his word.
At the hour named the tintinnabulation
of the bell announced another count,
which was followed by same sudden
rush and swift retreat.
Here is a new Parliamentary pro-
cedure that promises pleasing excite-

PASTIMES FOR M.P.'S.
THE recent Parliamentary Pigeon-
Flying Match proved such an enormous
popular success and was, we may add,
so eagerly supported by the illustrated
Press that it seems quite certain that
our legislators will not be content to
stop there. Our representative in the
Lobby last week met with only one
opinion on the subject, namely, that it
was a thousand pities that this sort of
thing had not been thought of sooner,
the more so as, in the opinion of many
experts, the precincts of Westminster
are curiously well-adapted to some of
our national sports and pastimes.
The promoters of the Rabbit-Coursing
Meet, which was to have been held
(in the event of an Autumn Session)
on the Terrace, have met with some
opposition, and it is feared that the
project will have to be abandoned. An
get through a short Bill legalizing the
Embankment as the scene of this
contest and closing it to all other traffic
during its continuance. It is thought
that even in the present congested
state of public business such a Bill,
powerfully backed as it will be and of
an entirely non-contentious nature,
should have no difficulty in reaching
the Statute Book. t
Meanwhile the Whips are being
consulted on the feasibility of intro.
ducing a new system of Pairs, by which
a whole team of contending members
of the Government and the Opposition
might be paired en bloc, in the event of
an important division threatening to
occur during a game of Rounders in
Parliament Square.
It is said that the movement in
favour of Ratting parties, with a terrier
and hockey sticks, along the waterside,
is by no means smiled upon by the
Government, and it is even asserted
that members of the Coalition have had
to sign an agreement not to join any
party for this sport unless it shali
embrace members of the Opposition in
a proportion of two to one, as a safe-
guard against “Snaps." On the other
hand the Cabinet is doing all it can to
foster the new interest that has been
aroused in the old round game of
throwing cards into a hat—with, of
course, Order papers substituted as the
regulation missile. This game may be
enjoyed, with a little ordinary circum-
spection, in the Chamber itself, and is
an admirable means of keeping one's
supporters on the spot.
There are still some old-fashioned
prejudices to be overcome. Hunt-the-
slipper has been forbidden in the Smok-
ing Room. But the new movement has
been enthusiastically received by the
Press photographers and it should do
much as time goes on to brighten the
lives of our members and relieve the
tedium of debate.

Dark oak upon the walls, upon the table
White napery, old silver, and red roses—
These o'er a garden where dream-borders shine
I build of dreams, and Stella comes to dine.
I do not set the cresset's sparks a-flitting
Down an Arabian dusk on hot winds roaming;
Softest electrics in an old French fitting

But, when a shadow-butler bends to ask us,

No roasted kid for us, no fatted suckling,
Whereof a Sultan eats in silken splendour;
We like clear soup, Scotch salmon, and a duckling,
And heaped red strawberries whose legions render
Enough for half-a-dozen helps at least
No conch shall blare, nor any nautch-girl's cymbal

We drink it on a terrace where the vagrant

DICKENS.
(Possibly by the author of the article on Balzac in a
recent number of “The Times Literary Supplement.")
This study, if indeed we may so term it, study being of
the mind impalpable, whereas something solid may not
unreasonably be expected to come of an addition of pages
to the number of not fewer than four hundred and fifteen
(and in this we do not, such being the custom, reckon
either preface or index), has, since it was not unknown that
Mr. Hickson was deeply engaged upon the work, been for
a long time in the so blandly nebulous region of expecta-
tion, and is now at last, its sails bellying with a favourable
wind, come into harbour. -
It may be well, as we set ourselves to tread its decks
and, with whatever of inspecting power we may possess, to
explore and classify the so carefully packed and labelled
cargo, to consider for not more than a moment and to
explain clearly what the good ship “Hickson"—and for the
word “good” we mako no apology—is not rather than is, this
method being not so much to aim a spear outside the target
or around or above or below it, but to the very heart and
centre of it, where you and we and they, too, may see it
quiver. We may leave out, as being superfluous, the mere
beginning and what next follows thereon as an immediate
consequence, largely conditioned though it be, we make
no doubt, by the reader's mind in grappling with the so
insistent problem of enumeration.
Thirdly, then, Mr. Hickson—and if w8 name him again
it is plainly with the respect due to one whose intellect,
not, indeed, merged into, but plainly attracted by, the fiction
(we underline that word) of DICKENs, has shown us
mellifluously, none the less, the old stage-directions and
tutti quanti of his subject—is not a tramp steamer
ploughing the ocean by an unfixed route ever at the mercy
of winds and waves and such other influences as an un-
charted sea may bring to bear, but a stately vessel, showing
by the mere magic of her predestined voyaging how closely
and how reasonably, seamanship as a science being
granted, a man with his limits of outlook may triumph
over what, for want of a better word, we may tentatively
term the elements.
Of the characters of DICKENs it must be said, and of this
Mr. Hickson to his credit is more than dimly aware, that
they move in orbits of their own and are subject, not to
such accidents as may properly be predicted of these orbits,
but to other quite extraordinary accidents having only this
in common with the ordinary accidents of human nature
that they happen and must necessarily be accepted as
having happened; but of this the great reading public has |
scarce other than the vaguest notion and cannot know that
they couldn't and didn't happen, but could and would be
and were described in such far better language than if they
had been what, in truth, they were never intended to be
and actually were not. Caught and imprisoned, now
thrust backward to a pillar, now forward with a quite
different poignancy to something imagined that might,
where all else was so remorselessly changeable, pass for
a post, are there yet not intervals, are there not spaces in
which it is still vaguely understood that Pecksniff was, in-
deed, a spirit not of compromise but of limitless mockery
transcendentally embodied for aversion and laughter? For

RHYME OF THE EVASIVE REVIEWER.
WHEN a novel that might disgust a Dago
Falls to my lot for a full review,
Or a sex-romance by a shrill virago
With a hero-cad and a heroine-shrew,
I'm far too gentle to crab or slate them
Or lay them out in the Bludyer style;
So I make it my aim to understate them
With the aid of euphemistic guile.
Though the plot and the dialogue are amazing
Enough to startle a Tosk or a Gheg,
And the hero's language is equal to raising
A crop of hair on a hard-boiled cgg,
I don't enlarge upon these shortcomings,
But I ladle the eulogy slab and thick
On the author's “freedom from hawings and
hummings,”
His “faithful portraits done from the quick.”
When the heroine jilts a dean for a tailor—
A Polish Jew with a terrible beak—
Or talks in a style that would shock a whaler
And raise a blush on a scavenger's cheek,
It were simply a verbal desecration
To call her a nasty little minx,
So I dwell on the fun of the situation
As the finest sport and the highest of jinks.
When a prosperous versatile impostor
In a number of rôles essays to shine,
I lend my pen the illusion to foster
That here is an artist who's all divine;
He may be only the minnows' Triton,
But I find that it generally pays
To lavish upon a bastard Crichton
The pap of an undiluted praise.
When a half-baked suitor for musical laurels
Composes a sloppy amorphous thing—
To a book of pseudo-exotic morals—
That is hard to play and ugly to sing,
Though the creature's Himalayan labours
Have only produced a melodic mouse,
With patriot pen I exhort my neighbours
To hail the fraud as a super-STRAUss.
When an underbred intellectual greaser
Has perpetrated a putrid play,
From which, in the days of a decadent Caesar,
. . The dregs of Rome would have kept away;
Though it's fit to turn a black man livid
I speak of its art in an awestruck tone
As “honest" and “brave" and “patiently vivid,”
And leave its dustbins and drains alone.
So over the gamut of gross evasion,
Day in, day out, I cheerfully range,
And use my gift of oily persuasion
To prove that the vile is only the strange;
For why should I strive to lift my brothers
Out of the clutch of their native mire?
Unsalaried tasks I leave to others;
No man can deny that I earn my hire.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE HAND OF FATE.
PEOPLE have called me inconsistent;
some people have gone so far as to say
meet in the presence of my heart, and
therefore I had never been able to dis-
cover which of the two was to be the
lucky one. After an encounter with
“Hello! ” said Olivia.
“Hello!" said Daphne.
“Are you there?" I suggested.
They both laughed. Honours, so far,
I am hopelessly inconsistent; but then, Olivia, the odds rose a shade in her were even.
some people. . . .
As a matter of fact and entirely with-
out prejudice, I have the artistic tem-
perament. It is only on this ground
that I can account for the fact that I
should love Olivia and Daphne at one
and the same time, or concurrently, as
we of the higher branch put it.
Olivia is very fair; I mean, of course,
fair of feature.
Daphne is dark and, from an allit-
erative point of view, I feel sure that
nothing could be heater. Daphne is
dark.
When I add that Olivia is tall and
cumbersome, whereas Daphne is petite,
you will readily deduce that the two
girls are distinguishable one from the
other.
And yet I loved them equally well.
In the absence of Olivia, Daphne
occupied the whole of my heart; con-
versely, in the absence of Daphne,
Olivia more than filled the vacancy.
It was a strange situation, even to
one accustomed, as I am, to the vicissi-
tudes of life.
Up to a few days ago, fortune had
favour; a subsequent meeting with
Daphne and the betting turned right
round. The betting turnel right round.
It was a strange situation. What-
ever people may have said of me (see
above), I am not lºcking in courage.
I decided that a joint meeting should
be arranged, accepting with quiet calm
the danger of the situation. I refer, of
course, to the possibility of my heart
being torn in doubt; in two, perhaps.
With consummate guile, I wandered
into the town on the day when the
largest local milliner was holding a sale.
In the most natural manner, and per-
fect snow-white spats, I strolled up and
down the High Street just outside the
milliner's. My scheming was imme-
diately successful. Before five minutes
had elapsed Olivia was on the scene.
“Hello!" she said, and my heart
leapt.
“Hello!" I replied with perfect calm.
Shopping?”
Olivia nodded. “"M."
I was just about to say something
witty, when Daphne emerged from the
shop. My handkerchief pocket quivered
“Shopping?" I enquired.
Daphne nodded. “‘M.”
In the short silence that followed
my excitement was tremendous. I was
just on the point of saying something
clever when Daphne interrupted.
“Well,” she said, “aren't you
going to congratulate us?” I looked at
her blankly.
“Us!" I exclaimed. “But you can't
both, you know. I mean, there can
only be one of you, and, as yet, I don't
know which.” I was getting a little
confused.
“My dear man, what do you mean?”
said Olivia. “Of course we can both,
you know.”
She patted Daphne's arm. “The
future Mrs. Banton,” she announced.
Daphne nodded to Olivia. “The
future Mrs. Merrilies,” she exclaimed.
And then I understood. Fortune
had shirked the task, and dealt with
them equally. There was to be no
lucky one.

AT THE PLAY.
“Boris GoDou Nov.”
Those who imagine from long and
bitter experience of Grand Opera that
singers cannot be expected to act,
should at once correct this error by a
visit to the Russian Company at Drury
Lane Theatre. Certainly M. CHALLA-
PINE's great performance is proof enough
that the possession of a voice is no neces-
sary bar to the highest dramatic gifts.
And a rare delight it was, after the cos-
mopolitan medleys of Covent Garden,
to hear a chorus singing their national
tongue in a national drama and wearing
their national dress as to the manner
born. May Heaven—if not Society—
reward Sir Joseph BEECHAM 1
MoUssorgsky's work calls itself a
Music Drama, and this means, of course,
that the dramatic element always had
its chance. The action, in fact, was
not there to illustrate the orchestra, but
the orchestra was there to interpret
the action. Yet the music in this play
of forty years ago still retains a certain
dominance over the drama, and a true
compromise between the two arts, as
shown, for instance, in PUccINi's La
Tosca, is still only foreshadowed. For
though the action is seldom delayed
for the sake of the orchestra (the few
superfluous moments that Boris wastes
over his dying are as nothing compared
with the interminable prolixity of
Tristan's decease), no sort of attempt is
made to give logical continuity to the
plot. The designs, for instance, of the
pretender Grigori are of the haziest.
He starts from nowhere in particular
and disappears into the inane. And the
various disjointed scenes, or “tableaux,”
are obviously selected without regard
to their part in the sequence of the
scheme, but largely for the musical
opportunities which they offer—here a
choral effect, there a casual folk-song or
a lament for a lost lover that nobody
has heard of.
It was impossible therefore to be
very greatly intrigued about the issue,
and this made it the more remarkable
that the dramatic intelligence of the
actors should have cast so strong a
spell over us. M. CHALLAPINE, alike
in his attitude of composed dignity
and in his moments of hallucination
induced by the madness of remorse, was
a splendid and noble figure. Next to
him I most admired the charm of
Mme. E. PETRENKO as the Tsarevitch's
Nurse. She did not reappear with the
others to take our plaudits, and I was
greatly tempted to shout “Nurse /
Nurse !” But the hour was getting
late and I feared that my neighbours
might suspect that it was my bed-
by M. ANDREEw as an old monk, and
indeed by everyone, though I found
M. DAMAEw (as Grigori) too nasal.
The music, naturally a little barbaric
in its louder colouring, was very poig-
nant in the simplicity of its tenderer
passages. At times it seemed curiously
to anticipate the flowing quality of
Madama Butterfly. -
Miss Rosa NEwMARCH's libretto was
much better than most operatic trans-
lations, and for the one-and-sixpence
you paid for it they threw you in an
astonishingly generous assortment of
misprints. One of the best that caught
my eye occurs in the duck-and-drake
song of the bonny widow:—
“Sweetheart mine for whom I wait,
Come console me
Quick, your bony widow woo.”
O. S.
THE DEADLY VIRTUE.
“You will go shopping with me to-
morrow, won't you?” said Betty, liſting
her head from his shoulder so that she
might look at him.
Percival started. It occurred to him
that Betty had fouled. He knew that
she knew that he hated shopping. To
visit shops in Regent Street with Betty
was to feel that he was a cypher—
something which Betty took along to
hang her parcels on, and as a foil to
her own stately appearance.
But Percival was bland and good-
tempered—he was probably one of the
best-tempered men who have ever lived.
“Er—well,” he said, “I'd just been
thinking that—that we hadn't done
any shopping for a long time. I'll be
delighted.”
Then Betty made a terrible blunder.
She took Percival's face between her
hands and said, “I knew you'd say
that. You're the best-tempered man
in the world. There never was a saint
with such a good temper.”
Now to be called good-tempered is to
be accused by implication of a lack of
all other qualities worthy of remark.
It is to be dubbed negligible, and Per-
cival did not like this.
“No,” he said, “no–I'm not like
that. I'm not good-tempered.”
Daintily Betty laid fingers upon his
lips.
“Don’t contradict me, dear,” she
returned. “Of course you're good-
tempered. It's the thing I like about
you best.”
“I’m not,” he told her, still smiling,
but with a suggestion of pain in his
voice. “I can't allow you to call me
that. Please withdraw the observation.”
“I won't,” said Betty. “I’ve said
that you have the sweetest nature any
man ever had, and it's true.”
“Betty,” he said, “you are dis-
appointing me. You call me good-
tempered while all the time I know
that I am not. I am cross-grained.
At the least thing I am ready to do
violence and to say terrible words. I
am the plaything of my passions. If I
have seemed suave and courteous, forget
it. It was only a mask. And now you
know the sort of man I am."
She did not. She still assumed that
he was starting some new sort of par-
lour game. So she stuck to her point.
“I know I'm right,” she said. “But,
anyhow, don't let's quarrel over it."
“I have no desire to quarrel,” he
frowned; “but I object to being called
names. I am not good-tempered. You
hear? I am the worst-tempered man
in London. I am like an east wind; I
am like a tornado; I am an unbearable
man.”
With a laugh, the first symptom of
mild hysteria, Betty moaned—
“You are not You are not l You
are good-tempered—sweet-tempered.
It's just because you are so sweet-
tempered that you won't admit it.”
That touched Percival on the raw.
“Be quiet!” he cried out on a note
of fury; “I won't stand it! Me good-
tempered. I, I mean. You don't
know me! Don't argue ! I say you
don't know me.”
Betty was in tears now. “You are
good-tempered,” she sobbed. . ." Goo-
good-tempered. You cou-couldn't do
an unkind thing—or s-say a harsh
word.”
Percival's face grew red, his eyes
fierce. Madly he seized an encyclo-
paedia from the table and crashed it
into the grate. The rattle of the fire-
irons roused him to an access of wrath.
“This is too much ” he shouted,
stretching a hand out for another book.
“I tell you I am not good-tempered.
I give you one last chance before we
part for ever. Am I good-tempered?”
She bowed her head.
Percival stalked up to her and glared
into her eyes.
“You persist?”
throatily.
Again she bowed her head. With
her right hand she fumbled at the third
finger of her left. Shakily she held out
the engagement ring.
“Yes,” she told him; “and please
go. I hear mother coming down.
I don't want her to see you in this
state.”
“I don't want to see her in any
state,” he barked. “Good-bye! I am
a bad-tempered man!”
In a moment he was outside in the
road. A little innocent dog came
trotting up to him. He kicked it aside

and strode on into the gloom.
Percival regarded her gravely.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Roger Rochford was the missing heir, or the claimant,
or something just as romantic, to the estate and title of
Westwood. Rosalind Wynnstay was the attractive niece
of the American millionaire who had rented the former.
So now you see what Rosalind in Arden (DENT) is about.
Anyhow, you see the end, for with protagonists so situated
it would be as much as a circulating library subscription is
worth not to leave them embracing on the last page. Mr.
H. B. MARRIOTT WATson seems to have been not only
sensible of this, but (I fancy) somewhat hard put to it to
provide them with six shillings-worth of obstacle to the
inevitable. Indeed, having practically finished his tale
when the lovers told their love several chapters before it
should be commercially due, he was obliged to invent a
number of quite tiresome persons, who (like the works of a
watch) have nothing to do with the case, in order that they
might chatter through a sufficiency of pages. All this is
only to say that I found Rosalind in Arden a dainty and
attractive, if not strikingly original, short story, spoilt by
expansion into a novel. Also the process seems to have
been hurried. As witness this:—“At the registered hour
he [Roger] was at Charing Cross to catch the boat train to
Dover. He paid no heed to his man, but recalled him
when he reached the Gare St. Lazare.” If the author had
paid a little more heed to his proofs this would never have
happened.
The first few strains of The Common Chord (MARTIN
SECKER) made my heart sink. For I found that PHYLLIs
Bottom E had apparently arranged for me to meet one after
girl living a Bohemian life alone in a studio, and a hand-
some young man; stupid but staunch, who loved her in
vain. I felt these were all people I knew well enough to
wish to avoid; which only shows once more the danger of
judging by appearances. It was the fast friendship between
Jean Ucelle, the French musician, and Jimmy Armstrong,
the sturdy Briton, which first showed me that Jean at
least must be unusual, and I soon began to realise that for
all his Gallic charm he had enough Saxon grit (for after all
he had an English mother) to gratify my insular prejudice.
Oh, and another thing. Jimmy, who might so well have
been handicapped in his rivalry for the love of Judith S.
Calvert by the possession of riches or noble birth, laboured
under no such unromantic disabilities, and in fact, on the
score of prospects, Jean was always giving away a pound or
two of weight; so that Judith, who was quite nice enough
for either of them, had a fair choice. Still, she naturally
enough chose Jean, though there were nearly some serious
complications over the artistic allurements of Sonia, the
great Russian dancer (need she have danced the swan
dance? Are there not swallows and humming birds?), for
whom Jean wrote the music which “caused him to arrive.”
In the end no one suffered much except Jimmy, and I am
afraid he was always cut out for silent self-sacrifice, so that
I did not greatly mind. Altogether, if PHYLLIS Bottom E
has used some familiar harmonies in building up her novel,
she has managed to arrange them with unexpected freshness,
and The Common Chord should on no account be lost.
Perhaps Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, author of the admir-
able Comiston and no tyro, therefore, in the novelist's art,
has, in The Inside of the Cup (MACMILLAN), let his sinceri-
ties run away with him. He crowds his stage with so many

them, to say nothing of getting comfortably acquainted.
His theme is the old theme of the generous and impatient
modernists of every age. Why preach (and finance) Christi-
anity and conduct lives and accept principles altogether
opposed to it? Why polish so assiduously the outside of
the cup 2 His hero, John IIodder, is a sterling parson in an
important Middle-West American city; his villains, Eldon
Parr, millionaire, manipulator and pillar of the Church,
with the satellites who stand in with the big man in the
same deals and worship in the same tabernacle. His heroine
is Eldon Parr's daughter Alison, a lovable character, admir-
ably drawn. The contending forces range themselves for the
contest—the big battalions of the dollars and the orthodoxies
on the one side, the modern ideas and the deep sincerities
on the other—with a precise definition which it is the
weakness of real life not to allow. If the eagerness of
the author's convictions shatters the respectable quality of
| detachment, his book will be none the less welcome to
those who are sincerely interested in the always recurring
on a young Englishwoman, married to a shrewd but stodgy
solicitor, when she comes suddenly in contact with a rather
fine and lawless dweller in the “foothills” of the Far West.
These two last are the Wilderness Lovers, and I found their
goings-on rather mawkish and Mr. PUNSHON's reasonings
thereon a trifle dull beside the breezy go-ahead movements
of the financier. , Still, there are the two things, and you
can make your choice which you will skip. There is very
good stuff in the book either way.
I found something stimulatingly colonial about Lu of the
Ranges (HEINEMANN). There is a fine quality of youth and
vigour in Miss ELEANor MoRDAUNT's writing that invests
with fresh interest the not very new story she tells. Lu
herself is as vital a heroine as you need wish. We first
meet her, the starving child-mother of two little brothers
on the Main Ranges, the three of them having been
abandoned by their parents. Then comes along Julian Orde,
wanderer, cynic, sentimentalist and incurable egoist (a figure
touched in with admir-
experiments with new
wine , and old bottles. |
And certainly here is a
tract which is neither
dull nor shallow.

six months for abstracting from the office petty-cash box the
wherewithal to back a horse which didn't win. Iłut beyond
that the mud which he keeps flinging at himself doesn't
stick. That, of course, is the obvious design of the author,
Mr. John BARNETT. He means you to think him the fine
fellow that he really is. Iłut this left-handed way of
drawing a hero, or rather of making the hero paint his own
picture, using the darkest possible colours for the shadows,
gives an irritating air of artificiality to the greater part of
the story. There is a delightful love scene at the end,
and nothing in the sinner's life becomes him half so well
as the manner of his leaving it as described in his own
words. But Mr. BARNETT sacrifices too much in order to
get his dramatic climax.
The Wilderness Lorers (HopDER AND STOUGHTON) makes
two entirely distinct appeals to the reader, though Mr.
E. R. PUNshoN has done his best—and a very good best—
to weave them into one story. First there are the doings
of an American millionaire who talks delightful Yankee and
is blissfully convinced that the angels are blind to the
misery his operations may cause so long as he endows a
church or builds a Sunday School with part of the profits.
Then there is a psychological study of the effect produced
becoming a popular idol
of the stage. Which of course is what happens; leading
up to the final scene, grimly moving, in which she again
meets Orde, and, dying, he commands her to dance again
for him as she did under the trees in their youth. There
is a plenty of other incidents; at some of them one might
perhaps sneer as melodramatic, but the whole effect is
undeniably robust. For this and for the character of Orde
I hail the book as one that promises well for Australian
literature.
The plight of Colonel SEELY's Territorial Cavalry, who
are not to be allowed to march past at the Royal Review,
finds a touching echo in the state of things at Carlsbad,
as set forth with considerable pathos in the local
Herald:—
“Some of our old cure-guests who use to come here regularly year
after year, will surely remind themselves of those donkey cavalcades,
which formerly walked through the whole town and how great the
pleasure always was for the strangers to take a ride on those donkeys.
They used to be quite a splendid specimen of donkeys and they
belonged to the town stud. These times seem to be finally over now.
Those donkey-cavalcades have totally disappeared. As far as they are
still alive, the bearers of this beautiful donkey period are to be found
in the town stable for donkeys. There are very few who live still
and it won't be long till also the last of their race will be dead.”

BETTER THAN A PLAY.
[Iines addressed to a waiter at a restaurant where they offer
facilities for theatre-dinners.]
NAY, rush me not, Antonio; let me savour
This coffee a la Turque at my slow ease,
And lap this blend of Benedictine flavour
Distilled by holy friars on their knees;
Bring me a brand of Cuba, green and balmy,
With gilded cummerbund and long and fat;
I have no play to see to-night, mom ami,
I thank my gods for that.
This hour to inward peace is dedicated;
To-night I will escape that captious mood
Which comes of healthy appetite unsated
Or else the bitter pangs of bolted food.
Lingering meals, with choice cigars for sequel,
Suit my digestive system better far;
I have seen many plays, but few to equal
A really good cigar. * --
And then compare the charges! For a scanty
Stall I must put my demi-guinea down,
Whereas this full and generous “Elegante"
Costs me the paltry stim of half-a-crown;
And, as I smoke it, I may hold a quiet
Duologue with myself, of fancy wrought,
Where no intruding mummers, making riot,
Distract my train of thought.
It is, I own, an honourable calling,
That of the histrion ; I respect his art;
The grind, I always think, must be appalling
Of getting such a lot of words by heart;
I would not seem, for worlds, to cast suspicion
Upon his shining claims; I but protest
He cannot stand the strain of competition
With one of Cuba's best. -

Begins, my good Antonio, to abate, - -

ONCE UPON A TIME.
Civilization.
ONCE upon a time there was a man who was tired of
hurry and fret and competition and politics and fashion
and modernity. Above all he was tired of newspapers.
“I will,” he said, “betake me to the wilderness for a
while and get back a little peace and simplicity.”
But the first thing that he saw on reaching the wilder-
ness was the office of The Wilderness Gazette.
From a circular:—
“Briefly, Pellidol is diacetylamidoazotoluol.” -
If the writer is really aiming at brevity, he must try again.
“Only one of the officers is now living who took part in the
‘Charge of the Light Brigade' at Balaclava; but there are probably
still 1,500 of the privates on earth who took part in that great
historical event.”—Greenwood (B.C.) Ledge.
THE CREATIVE GIFT.
[“A character will every now and then seem to take the bit between
his teeth and say and do things for which his creator feels himself
hardly responsible.”—WILLIAM Aircher.]
| THE budding dramatist looked again at the passage in
the Playwright's Manual. Yes, there it was in cold print.
“Once your characters are clearly in your mind,” he
read, “you can let them work out their own salvation.
They, not you, will construct the play. The late Clyde
Fitch used to insist that his characters often surprised
him by their actions.” -
The budding dramatist breathed hard. This was a new
gospel to him; he had been on the wrong track from the
start. Clearly the proper course was to individualize the
characters mentally, to decide on the opening scene, and
then to sit back in a receptive mood and record the actions
of the children of his party. At last he could begin on
To-Morrow, his great dramatization of Laziness; for already
the character of Lucius Doolittle was clearly in his head.
How, then, should the play open 2 Once this was decided,
he could liberate Lucius and let him go his own way.
At exactly eight o'clock the next morning a splendid idea
for the beginning of Act I. presented itself. Scene: Morning
in Lucius Doolittle's bachelor apartments. An alarm clock
heard ringing without. Lucius in his pyjamas emerges from
his bedroom door, and lighting a cigarette (character touch)
strolls listlessly toward the bath. A great beginning: true :
to every-day life and yet unusual. Not a soul in the
audience but would be startled into attention by the
insistent tinkle of the alarm. . What psychology | And
later, perhaps, the audience could actually hear Lucius's
bath running. Uncompromising realism'
Such was the budding dramatist's fever of excitement
that he could hardly wait to scramble into his clothes and to
pounce upon his bacon and eggs before beginning the work
of a lifetime. At last all was ready—his pen chosen, his
paper ranged before him. Trembling with excitement he
proceeded to focus his inner eye upon Lucius Doolittle,
who was to choose his own path through the piece
unhindered. Cautiously he wrote as follows: “Time—
early morning. Doolittle's apartments are in disorder.
Glasses and a half-emptied bottle stand on the centre-table;
beside them lies a pack of cards. There is nobody in the
room; Doolittle is obviously not yet up.”
The dramatist paused, and with a little gasp
ment set down these words:– --
“An alarm clock is heard ringing without.”
He waited, eyes shut.
“Now, Lucius, go it,” he murmured.
Somehow in his inner consciousness he could feel
Doolittle stirring, waking. What was the character saying?
Wait—here it was Slowly the dramatist's hand traced

The dramatist looked at the finished work doubtfully,
critically.

ANOTHER INJUSTICE.
BEING in the thick of a temporary
embarrassment, and having, as it
seemed, run upon the rocks at the
precise moment that all my friends
and relations had performed a similar
feat, there was nothing for it but to
seek professional aid.
On asking the advice of one to
whom all such mysteries are an open
book, I was directed to an upper room
in Jermyn Street.
The second floor, he had told me;
but when I reached it and found no
name on the door but plain
AARON BREITSTEIN
I felt convinced there had been some
mistake. For only that morning had I
not been reading about Lord NEwtoN's
Moneylenders Bill, the point of which
is that no moneylender at the present
time would dream of having anything
but a Christian — or, if possible, a
Scotch—name.
I was therefore beating a retreat,
when the door opened and I was asked
blond, muscular, snub-nosed and very
obvious Anglo-Saxon gentleman who
put the question I replied that I was
in search of one whose privilege and
pleasure it was to assist his fellows in
times of financial stress.
“Come in,” he said ; “that 's what
I'm jolly well here for.”
I held my swimming head.
“But,” I said, “how can you be a
moneylender when your name is Aaron

in such a business. You would call
yourself Graham or Moffatt or Bunty
or Archer or Rosslyn or Harmsworth
or Pearson. I know ; I have been
reading the aliases in the daily press
only this morning.”
“My real name is not Aaron Breit-
stein,” he said. “That's only my
business name.”
“What is your real name?” I asked.
“John George Albion,” he said.
“But if that's your real name,” I
replied, “you must be English, and

‘Scotchmen' when they have to revert
to their true style.”

I reminded him; “for you'll have to
change back too.” -

expect to be worried very much. Only

“True,” I said.

RURAL REVELRY.
(Wide Local Press passim.)
ON Friday last the annual outing of
the Titteringham Literary Society was
held in perfect weather, to the complete
satisfaction of all who were privileged
to participate therein. Hitherto the
members have fared forth on their
annual expeditions in horse - drawn
vehicles, usually of the waggonette
type, but on this occasion a new de-
parture was made, and the Society
availed themselves of the new and
commodious motor-brake recently ac-
quired by Messrs. Docking and Posh.
and his tactful execution of his chauf-
ferial functions elicited the warmest
encomiums, the list of casualties being
confined to one hedgehog, for which no
claim was preferred.
An excellent start was effected at
10.30 A.M. from the “Hammer and
Tongs Inn,” and in less than an hour
the splendidly upholstered vehicle,
gliding swiftly over the well-appointed
road, drew up at the entrance to New-
bottle Abbey. A special feature of these
excursions is the excellent practice of
allotting each place visited to a member
with special antiquarian knowledge.
On this occasion it fell to the lot of
Tipple, to discourse on the beauties of
Newbottle Abbey; and right eloquently
did he avail himself of his opportunities.
Mr. Tipple gave a short and masterly
sketch of the original Roman camp of
Novo-Bottilium, on the site of which the
Abbey was subsequently built by Goswy,
King of Northumbria. Later on, when
KING John was on his disastrous march
to the Wash, he was entertained with
lavish hospitality by the Abbot, and in
return for a magnificent dish of carp,
which were served up to the royal
epicure, the Abbey received the right |
to adopt the somewhat pagan motto of |
Carpe diem. Proceeding thence to
Stuttingford the party partook of an
excellent luncheon at the “Gray Goose
Hotel,” where mine host (Mr. Jonah
Bulpitt) literally surpassed himself in
the amplitude of the menu provided.
Before leaving Stuttingford on the
return journey, the Society spent a
delightful hour in the Free Library,
where Mr. Widgery Bamber, the
librarian, did the honours of the in-
stitution, and Mr. Theophilus Moult
delivered an interesting address on the
principal branches of local manufacture,
viz., cotton, linen, canvas for sails,
sacking, candlewicks, hats, axes, adzes,
spades, hoes, and sickles. The chief
articles of export, in addition to some
of the above, are wool, grain, butter,
bath-chairs, gunpowder, golf-balls, pig- ||
iron, crinolines (for Central Africa),
swoggles and bobbins.
of Mr. Hatherley Goole a vote of thanks
was passed to Mr. Moult for his lucid ||
and illuminating address.

tea provided for them on reaching ||
Tittenhanger at 4.45 P.M., Messrs.
Pottle and Sons, the well-known
caterers of Wigborough, having pur-

cicerone were greatly appreciated, gave

journey at the parish church of Great
Snoring, which the Rev. John Bluck
described as one of the stateliest monu-
ments of the Decorated Soporific school
of art. Within a mile of home the
complete success of the excursion was
very nearly impaired by a serious acci-
dent. Mr. Timothy Wanlip, junr., who
had partaken heartily of shrimps, was
suddenly seized with what Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE elegantly calls “cross-Channel”
symptoms, and fell from the box-seat.
Fortunately the brake had been fitted
only the day before by Messrs. Brackley
and Jeeves with a cowscraper, which
most efficiently prevented Mr. Wanlip,
junr., from being crushed under the
wheels. Restoratives were promptly
administered by our good friend Mr.
Hugo Trotter, L.P.S., and the home-
ward journey was completed without

“Do you happen to want,” I said to
Henry, “an opera hat that doesn't op?
At least it only works on one side.”
“No,” said Henry.
“To anyone who buys my opera hat
for a large sum I am giving away four
square yards of linoleum, a revolving
bookcase, two curtain rods, a pair of
spring-grip dumb-bells and an extremely
patent mouse-trap.”
“No,” said Henry again.
“The mouse-trap,” I pleaded, “is
unused. That is to say, no mouse has
used it yet. My mouge-trap has never
been blooded.”
“I don't want it myself,” said Henry,
“but I know a man who does.”
“Henry, you know everybody. For
Heaven's sake introduce me to your
friend. Why does he particularly want
a mouse-trap 2"
“He doesn't. He wants anything
that's old. Old clothes, old carpets,
anything that's old he'll buy.”
He seemed to be exactly the man I
wanted.
“Introduce me to your fellow club-
man,” I said firmly.
That evening I wrote to Henry's
friend, Mr. Bennett. “Dear Sir,” I
wrote, “if you would call upon me to-
morrow I should like to show you some
| really old things, all genuine antiques.
In particular I would call your atten-
tion to an old opera hat of exquisite
workmanship and a mouse-trap of
chaste and handsome design. I have
also a few yards of Queen Anne lino-
leum of a circular pattern which I
think will please you. My James the
First spring-grip dumb-bells and Louis
Quatorze curtain-rods are well known
to connoisseurs. A genuine old cork
bedroom suite, comprising one bath-
mat, will also be included in the sale.
Yours faithfully.”
On second thoughts I tore the letter
up and sent Mr. Bennett a postcard
asking him to favour the undersigned
with a call at 10.30 prompt. And at
10.30 prompt he came.
I had expected to see a bearded
patriarch with a hooked nose and
three hats on his head, but Mr. Bennett
turned out to be a very spruce gentle-
man, wearing (I was sorry to see) much
better clothes than the opera hat I
proposed to sell him. He became
businesslike at once.
“Just tell me what you want to
sell,” he said, whipping out a pocket-
book, “and I'll make a note of it. I
take anything.”
I looked round myspacious apartment
and wondered what to begin with.
“The revolving bookcase,” I an-
nounced.
“I'm afraid there's very little sale
for revolving bookcases now,” he said,
as he made a note of it.
“As a matter of fact,” I pointed out,
“this one doesn't revolve. It got stuck
some years ago.”
He didn't seem to think that this
would increase the rush, but he made
a note of it.
“Then the writing-desk.”
“The what 2 ''
“The Georgian bureau. A copy of
an old twentieth-century escritoire.”
“Walnut 2" he said, tapping it.
“Possibly. The value of this
Georgian writing-desk, however, lies
not in the wood but in the literary
associations.”
“Ah! My customers don't bother
much about that, but still—whose was
it 2 ” .
“Mine,” I said with dignity, placing
my hand in the breast pocket of my
coat. “I have written many charming
things at that desk. My “Ode to a
Bell-push, my “Thoughts on Asia,
In —”
“Anything else in this room?” said
Mr. Bennett. “Carpet, curtains --
“Nothing else,” I said coldly.
We went into the bedroom and,
gazing on the linoleum, my enthusiasm
returned to me.
“The linoleum,” I said with a wave
of the hand.
“Very much worn,” said Mr. Bennett.
I called his attention to the piece
under the bed.
“Not under there,” I said. “I never
walk on that piece. It's as good as
new.”
He made a note.
said.
I showed him round the collection.
He saw the Louis Quatorze curtain-
rods, the cork bedroom suite, the
Caesarian nail-brush (quite bald), the
antique shaving-mirror with genuine
crack—he saw it all. And then we
went back into the other rooms and
found some more things for him.
“Yes,” he said, consulting his note-
book. “And now how would you like
me to buy these?”
“At a large price,” I said. “If you
have brought your cheque-book I'll
lend you a pen.”
“You want me to make you an
offer 2 Otherwise I should sell them
by auction for you, deducting ten per
cent. commission.”
“Not by auction,” I said impulsively.
“I couldn't bear to know how much,
or rather how little, my Georgian
bureau fetched. It was there, as I
think I told you, that I wrote my
‘Guide to the Round Pond.' Give me
an inclusive price for the lot, and never,
never let me know the details.”
“What else?” he
He named an inclusive price. It was
something under a hundred-and-fifty
pounds. I shouldn't have minded that
if it had only been a little over ten
pounds. But it wasn't.
“Right,” I agreed. “And, oh, I was
nearly forgetting. There's an old
opera hat of exquisite workmanship,
which --
“Ah, now, clothes had much better be
sold by auction. Make a pile of all you
don't want and I'll send round a sack
for them. I have an auction sale every
Wednesday.”
“Very well. Send round to-morrow.
And you might—er—also send round
a—er-cheque for-quite so. Well,
then, good morning.”
When he had gone I went into my
bedroom and made a pile of my opera-
hat... It didn't look very impressive—
hardly worth having a sack specially
sent round for it. To keep it company
I collected an assortment of clothes.
It pained me to break up my wardrobe
in this way, but I wanted the bidding
for my opera-hat to be brisk, and a
few preliminary suits would warm the
public up. Altogether it was a goodly
pile when it was done. The opera-hat
perched on the top, half of it only at
work.
: :: : ::: . :::
To-day I received from Mr. Bennett
a cheque, a catalogue and an account.
The catalogue was marked “Lots 172–
179." Somehow I felt that my opera
hat would be Lot 176. I turned to it
in the account.
“Lot 176—Six shillings.”
“It did well,” I said. “Perhaps in
my heart of hearts I hoped for seven
and sixpence, but six shillings—yes, it
was a good hat.”
And then I turned to the catalogue.
“Lot 176–Frock coat and vest, dress
coat and vest, ditto, pair of trousers
and opera hat.”
“And opera hat.” Well, well. At
least it had the position of honour at
the end. My opera hat was starred.

It was generally understood in the

Salford, was studying social conditions
from a Radical point of view. Certainly
he took no interest whatever in the
fishing, and as the rest of us, for the time
being, took no interest whatever in any-
thing else our intimacy with him did not
ripen as it might have done. He seemed
to spend most of his time poking about
making deplorable discoveries, but he
was always most ready to talk when he
could find a victim. I came upon him
one sunny morning leaning against the
railing and gazing out across the loch.
“You know, I do feel for these High-
land shepherds,” he began. “Theirs
is a bleak, hard life.” And he sighed.
I gave him no encouragement, but he
went on.
“The population is leaving the
country; and can you wonder at it?
“where there might be and ought to
be a flourishing community tilling the
heather, the place is a mere solitude
given over to grouse and deer. Do you
see that little white cottage over there?

gillies was telling me to-day that the
shepherd's wife that lives there has
broken down completely—mental de-
pression — nervous collapse. Surely
that ought not to be.”
“Certainly not,” said I.
Mr. Ezekiel Thornton took a long
breath, and I knew that I was in for it.
“Twenty years ago her husband
took her over there as a bride, a
strong, healthy, buxom young woman
of twenty-three. And now it has come
to this ”
“But what went wrong?”
“Sheer loneliness,” he replied mourn-
fully. “She had no neighbours. There
is no road, not even a track to the
cottage. Week after week she never
saw the face of a stranger. There she
sat day after day, her husband away
on the hill, cut off from her fellows,
looking out across the steel-grey loch.”
There was a short pause, and then
he began to pile it on. “There she

brooding solitude year after year. And
now has come the inevitable collapse.”

In winter sitting late at night
I hate the artificial light;
In summer it is rather hard
To leave the sun in Palace Yard.
I have to go inside the place,
And hang about all day in case
The Tories spring a snap division
And then object to its rescission.

When there are nicer things to do,
That I should have to spend my day
In such a tiresome sort of way?

Our feet and perfect greens !
All worries we have left behind;
We are as free as air;
It would be difficult to find
A more contented pair.

Members! once you've been elected,
Always vote as you're expected,

To perambulate the Lobby;
Very seldom even try
To attract the SPEAKER's eye.

That was how—and still is yet—
Members reached the Cabinet.
But the lazy and unruly
And the sort who speak unduly,
Let them put aside the notion
They will ever get promotion.
Faithless and unwilling henchmen
Never will become front-bench-men,
And they cannot well complain
If Private Members they remain.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, June 30. — Lord
NEwton not only makes excellent jokes;
he passes good Bills. Already this
Session, whilst others talk and wrangle,
he has carried through a useful measure
dealing with the evils of betting. To-
day moves second reading of the
Moneylenders Bill. Not the
kind that Josiah or Abraham
would voluntarily endorse, even
with the prospect of something
more than the maximum of 5
per cent. interest which figures
modestly in their circulars. And
yet its provisions are so simple,
and the obvious marvel is they
were not earlier enforced.
All that Lord NEwToN asks is
that moneylenders shall describe
themselves as such ; that in
addition to their assumed names
they shall give their own; and
that their circulars shall be sent
only to such hapless students of
this type of literature as shall in-
dicate desire to have it supplied.
A flutter audible on certain
benches when, as result of in-
quiry, Newton told how these
honest traders, solicitous to add appear-
ance of respectability to shady busi-
ness, borrow names of noble lords
and flaunt them in place of their
own, invariably suggestive of Semitic
origin. For example, there are among
the tribe a BURTon, a STEwART (no
kinsman of LoNDoNDERRY or GALLo-
way), a ForTEscue and—here NEwToN,
smitten with genuine emotion, shud-
dered—a CURzoN. This indignity to an
historic assembly, which has not even a
preamble to recommend it, will be made
impossible by passing of the Bill.
“For example,” NEwton said,
glancing lightly from Ministerial Bench
to Front Bench opposite, from SECRE-
TARY of STATE For INDIA to LEADER
of OPPosition who confronted him,
“Moses and Aaron trading as CREwB
and LANSDownB will be obliged to dis-
close their identity.”
Prospect of deliverance from the pest
of moneylenders' circulars evidently
touched a chord of sympathy. The
MEMBER FoR SARK, who watched debate
from Commons' pen, bore personal
testimony to prevalence of the plague.
“Rarely a morning passes without
the post bringing me one or more of
these circulars,” he said. “Any day I
might, on ridiculously low terms, find
myself in possession of sums varying
from £100 to £20,000. No questions
asked ; no disclosure made. Just your
note of hand, and there's your money.
ago by my lamented friend LABBY,
I used to put the circulars in an
unstamped envelope and re-address
them to the sender, Moses or Aaron as
the case might be. Pictured to myself
their benevolent smile when, having
paid twopence for the missive expectant
of prey, they found their own circular.
“Am told this artless expedient is

counterchecked by hereditary wariness.
Orders have been given in all money-
lenders' offices not to take in unstamped
letters. What puzzles me is how these
fellows come to know of my straitened
circumstances, a condition of life the
privacy of which I jealously guard. As
they say at the War Office, the Admiralty
or elsewhere, when an embarrassing
document gets into the papers, there's
a leakage somewhere.”
THE STAIRS THAT BENN BUILT.
Business done.-Second Reading of
Moneylenders Bill passed without
division. Chorus of approval promises
swift and certain progress to Statute
Book.
House of Commons, 8.30 A.M., Thurs-
day.—After sitting that ran nearly the
full round of the clock House sleepily
adjourned. In other days, before Irish
Members found salvation, it was
a familiar incident in week's
work to go home with the milk
in the morning. Of late an
all-night sitting is so unusual
as to create some talk. Suggests
inquiry about reasonableness of
charging overtime. Labour
Members testify that when that
overloaded Titan, the British
workman, is required to stay on
after completion of a full day's
work he is paid per hour at
increased rate. Why should
there be one law for the dock-
worker and another for the
wage-earner at Westminster?
Talk of organising strikes if
demands on this score be ignored
by CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER.
Late sitting occasioned by
resolute opposition displayed
against Plural Voting Bill in
Committee. Earlier in afternoon there
was outbreak disclosing afresh electricity
in an atmosphere which through long
hours is dolefully depressing. Marconi
episode petered out and ARCHER-SHEE
not quite ready with his oil-can.
Accordingly, by way of filling up time,
Wol,MER, devoured with anxiety for
political purity, brings in Bill extend-
ing scope of Corrupt Practices Act.
Based upon incident occurring at
recent by-election at Leicester. Some
misunderstanding about communica-
tion to working-men voters as to view
taken by Labour leaders in the Com-
mons of interposition of third candidate.
WolMER with frankness of comparative
youth had already indicated his view of
transaction.
“A forged telegram,” he remarked,
when MAURICE LEvy, who transmitted
the message, escorted the new Member
for Leicester to the Table to take the
oath.
“A vulgar and insulting remark,”
LEvy described it.
Wolm ER, shocked at this language,
appealed to SPEAKER for protection.
Got more than he expected in shape of
stern reminder that his own disorderly
conduct had put him out of court.
Few minutes later the SPEAKER again
shortened unseemly episode by stopping
LEvy, who was on the point of what
would have been deplorable final retort

Friday.—The week has seen some-
thing more than irresistible progress
of Home Rule Bill, Welsh Church Dis-
establishment Bill, and Plural Voting
Bill towards Statute Book. Has wit-
nessed opening of new staircase leading
from dining-room lobby to Terrace.
Tendency of Parliamentary mind dis-
tinctly running in direction of stair-
cases leading anywhither so that they
lead away from the workshop where our
£400 a year is so arduously earned.
A few years ago new staircase was
built regardless of expense for use of
ladies going to tea on the Terrace or
dinner in the Harcourt Room. Extrava-
gance was the outcome of protest by
clique of misanthropes who complained
that, when they left enclosure on Ter-
race reserved “For Members only"
and tried to run upstairs in response to
sound of division bell, their progress
was impeded by what they called
“women” tripping downstairs, usually
occupying the whole of centre-way.
New staircase primarily for service
of Members; they are indebted to the
energy of WEdgwood BENN, repre-
sentative in Commons of Board of
Works. A First Commissioner (in this
case his deputy) is naturally desirous of

Members call it the “Harcourt Room.”
The new descent to the Terrace will be
known as the Benmachree Staircase,
a name which happily blends the
patronymic of the Minister with a com-
pliment to the Irish alliance with the
Ministry of the day. -
As BENN told a deeply interested
House, it is intended to decorate the
centre panel of the staircase with a
picture designed by SEYMoUR LucAs
representing “The Flight of the Five
Members.” Promise of much competi-
tion for places on the panel. As yet
no decision arrived at as to identity of
sitters for what is likely to be a stirring
picture of Members bolting downstairs.
All that has yet been settled is that, in
accordance with rule governing nom-
ination of Select Committees, two shall
be selected from the Ministerial side,
two from the Opposition Benches, with
one Irish Member.

spoke to them. “No holding him
to-day, I am afraid,” I murmured
apologetically; “the drought seems to
be in his blood.”
The girl stared and the young man
put up the forcing-frame which had
fallen from his eye during the recent
manoeuvres and positively looked nib-
licks at me.
“Oughtn't to allow them on the links
at all,” I heard him say, as I tried to
bolt the wanderer from the burrow
where he had gone to ealth.
He was quite steady after that,
until the eleventh hole, where, taking
advantage of the fact that I used a

and watched him. He travelled with
a low curly gait about ankle high, the
sort of shot that leaves cover-point
guessing every time. Rhododendron
and Glass-house were taking the flag
: out of the fifteenth hole, and they cut
him by a brisk leap into the air. I
could scarcely refrain from shouting

he replaced his stopper, and they both
deliberately turned their backs on me.
“I don't think I like those people,”
I said to James as I rejoined him ;
“they seem rather reserved.”
“I know the man a little,” said James,
and as luck would have it he was the
only occupant of the male compartment
of the club-house when we came in to
tea.
“Hullo, I'm afraid my partner
nearly damaged you this afternoon,”
said James; “he's very sorry about it.”
Then I made my third apology, and
the chap looked at me through his
glass as if I had been a green-fly.
This was unbearable. Hang it all, the
grievance was more mine than his. It
was obviously the gay, worldly appear-
ance of himself and his partner that had
tempted my ball away from its proper
courses.
I determined to be affable.
“Are you going to play another
round?” I asked him.
“No,” he replied coldly; “I am going
home. There's no safe place on these
links.” .
Very sadly indeed I ate an enormous
tea, and, whether it was the effect of
not know, but my first drive after-
wards had a huge slice upon it.
Almost at once it was obvious that
my ball would drop, not on the course,
but out of bounds in the road that runs
outside. A second later, as it hovered
in the air, it was clear that it was
extremely likely to hit a large open
motor-car coming from the club-house.
As a matter of fact it timed its descent
with extraordinary precision. I have
seldom seen two motorists look so
frightened. Simultaneously they leapt
into the air and flung themselves back
against the cushions. One of them, I
noticed, had a monocle in his eye.
His companion wore a fur coat, but
she had a kind of pink woollen garment
on her lap, and the adventurer fell
exactly between them.
I did not pursue them to reclaim
my property. Legally speaking, they
had no right to appropriate the ball;
yet, morally, I felt that they had
earned it. -

SCENE–A RESTA UIRANT.
[Both the Old and the Young Man
should look the picture of radiant
health, the Waiter should be very
genial, the Doctors pompous and
well-meaning, and the Voices should
be eactremely agitated.
Old Man. I am glad to see you are
taking Bingo's Life Preserver.
Young Man. Yes, I always take it, and
so do all my family. It is splendid stuff.
Old Man. And so cheap, too. Only
one-and-nine the small bottle, and
inferior makes cost two-and-nine or
even three-and-two. * -
Young Man (sternly). I avoid all
substitutes. Bingo's is the only true
and original life preserver. (Very im-
pressively). It saved the life of my aunt
at Cromer. - -
Old Man. How delightful.
Young Man. And my great-uncle,
who is ninety-eight, ascribes his robust
health entirely to Bingo. ---
Old Man (con amore). I am not at
all surprised. - -
Youmy Man. My grandfather lived to
be one-hundred-and-eleven with the aid
of the large bottle of Bingo, and then
he was only killed by a motor-'bus.
Old Man. Good.
Young Man. My liver, etc., etc.
Old Man (an hour later). You may
well say that.
Young Man. It is splendid stuff.
Old Man (after a pause). It is splen—

silence for a minute.) But tell me,
Abraham, how does your love affair

Young Man (assuming a lugubrious
crpression and hearing a profound sigh).
Alas! alas ! -
Old Man. Oh dear, does she refuse you?
Young Man. Refuse me? Aurelia 2
No, she loves me to distraction ; she
would go through fire and water for me;
but her father will not hear of an en-
gagement. He says I have no money.
Old Man. What an impasse!
Young Man. Aurelia has enough for
two, but she will not marry without
her father's consent.
Old Man. Why not? -
Young Man. She would lose her
money if she did. I don't know what
we shall do. Alas! (Weeps bitterly.)
Old Man. All this is very pathetic.
It affects me strangely. It is quite like
a play. (Restaurant band starts play-
ing “Hitchy Koo."). Ah, there is some
slow music. I think I will now weep.
(Does so.) [Enter Waiter.
Waiter. Another bottle, Sir? (Per-
ceives their situation.) Dear, dear, don't
take on so, gentlemen. Be British.
Waiter. Come, come, Sir, every cloud

Old Man (rousing himself). That's
true. I never thought of that.

Young Man. Send for a doctor.

hat, a stethoscope and a thing that
looks like a stiletto. They punch
the elderly gentleman about the ribs.

again. - [Erit.

Young Man. Ah, my Bingo. (Pulls
out his bottle and gives it to Aurelia's
Father, who at once shows some signs
of life. Slowly he returns to conscious-
mess; at last he rises, looks round him
and begins to dance about.)
Aurelia's Father. I feel very fit.
I would like a game of squash rackets.
Aurelia (shocked). Father.
Aurelia's Father (surprised). Why, it
isn't Sunday. Oh I I remember now.

young fellow. -

CAMPER'S LUCK.
WELL, yes, of course one is “roughing
it,” as they say. That is all right.
You don't expect a vagrant's life to be
a bed of roses. But I am not com-
plaining of the rules of the game.
Being no mean sportsman, I am always
prepared to rough it in a spacious,
weatherproof, well-ventilated and
luxuriously appointed caravan, with a
first-class stove, comfortable chairs and
a thundering good bed. The trouble
lies not in the inherent privations of
existence on tour—far from it. The
trouble lies in the ups and downs, the
undulations—if you take me—in the
run of luck. Even so, it would be all
right if one thing did not lead to
another. But it does.
They go in cycles, generally of about
twenty-four hours. If a day means to
be good it is not at all easy to spoil it.
And if it means to be bad you can't
cure it. It is simply the steady pre-
ponderance of good days over bad that
makes caravanning the finest holiday
in the world. But “when they are
bad" (like the little girl in the poem)
“they are horrid.”
You can nearly always tell them as
soon as you get up. The rubber bath
acts as a sort of rough index for the
day. If it behaves well you are pretty
sure to be all right. But if it begins
by flopping over when you are filling
it, and flooding the corner where you
keep the boots, and ends by turning
on you viciously as you are emptying
it out of a high window, you are in
for it. You must go forward in faith,
with no immediate hope, and with your
eye fixed bravely on the morrow. In
the meantime you may expect a bad
egg for breakfast, a heavy downpour
of rain while you are packing up, a
broken trace when you stick in the
gate, a mistake in the map, which
lands you into impossible country, a
lame horse. You will find you have
forgotten the corkscrew and left behind
your only pipe; the shops in the
village that you were counting on are
closed for the weekly half-holiday; your
letters have been sent to the wrong
place. You endure endless delays in
finding camping ground, because the
farmer has recently made the farm over
to his brother-in-law (just now at the
station with the milk), who has sub-let
the only possible field to the butcher,
who is at a market four miles off, and
(when he is found) can't move the
cattle unless he has permission to put
them into the meadow that belongs to
the aged schoolmaster, who is in bed
with a sharp attack of pneumonia and
can't be consulted. That is the sort of
And, as I have said, one thing leads
to another.
It is late at night and everything is
at last in order. It occurs to you, just
before turning in, that you will clean
the fish for breakfast. That will not
take five minutes. You go into the
kitchen, get a bowl, a sharp knife and
the bucket. In pouring the water into
the bowl you slip and flood the floor.
You mop it up, and then you must
wash your hands. You get a basin,
fetch the soap from the bedroom and
pour out more water. You wash your
hands. Very well, you return to the
fish. The candle has almost burned
out. You go and grope for another in
the locker, and have the misfortune to
get your hand into the blacking. You
light the candle, wash your hands and
return to your fish. But by degrees
you are getting deeper in. The candle
topples over. You had jammed it on
the top of the hot stump and it has
gone weak in the knees. You make a
grab at it. You are too late to save it,
but you knock something off the table
and can hear it dripping quietly in the
dark. You plunge fishy hands into
your pockets, but find you have no
matches. You have to go for them to
the bedroom, stepping on the lard en
route. You find that the dripping sound
was methylated spirit and it has con-
taminated the frying-pan. Very well.
You fix your candle. Everything is
getting pretty fishy by this time, so
you wash your hands. You return to
your fish. Then you try to wash the
frying-pan with cold water, and fail.
You must boil water, and you have no
water left. You light a lantern and go
for water to the spring (600 yards).
You propose to ignite the stove. It is
empty. The oil is beneath the van,
and it is now raining hard. You bring
the oil and upset the milk which some
fool had left on the step. You light
the stove; boil the water; wash the
pan; wash the floor; chuck away the
lard; wash your hands; put out the
stove; take back the oil and put the
fish in the frying-pan. It is now two
hours since you began and your net
loss is one quart of milk, a pint of
methylated spirit and a chunk of lard.
You see what I mean when I say that
one thing leads to another.
But then, if the morrow is a good day,
it will inaugurate a new cycle. The
fish will not, after all, taste of methy-
lated spirit. You will find enough
milk in the blue jug. As you empty
the bath out of the window, it will quite
gratuitously put out a rising confla-
gration where some one had set fire to
the old newspapers, and might have set
fire to the van. At breakfast, if you
will not break but it will kill a wasp.
As the day goes on itinerant butchers
and bakers will minister to you in the
nick of time. A preternaturally intelli-
gent postman will pursue you on a
bicycle with the lost letters. By taking
a wrong turning you are brought to the
most perfect camp of the tour in a
sheltered meadow by a winding stream.
One of the lamps of the stove goes out, -
while you are not watching it, and
thereby saves the sirloin from being
grossly overdone.
And late at night a sudden heavy
shower extinguishes the gramophone of
the party camped over the hedge,
FAU VETTE.
(A Toy Dog.)
FAUVETTE a dainty lady is;
Her life is hedged with luxuries,
Her room with richest tapestries.
Her garb is very fair to view;
She has a silken coat of blue,
And one of roseate satin, too.
In this attire her days are spent
Upon a couch of pleasing scent
'Twixt sleep and taking nutriment,
For which she has a silver dish
Served with the rarer kinds of fish,
Or breast of game, if she should wish.
She comes of high and ancient line;
Her birth, her breeding, are so fine
That she has won of medals, nine.
Such worth demands the greatest care;
Tho' sometimes, when the day is fair,
She will go forth to breathe the air.
Not doomed to walk, as others are,
She takes a drive, not fast or far,
Well guarded in a costly car.
For this she has a coat of fur
And goggles light as gossamer,
Lest wind or dust should ravish her.
And she, from this high post, looks down
Coldly, between a sneer and frown,
On the low mongrels of the town,
Who see her on her owner's lap,
And, stung by her derisive yap,
Would give the world to have one snap. ;
It may be, if some boarhound ate
The frail and shivering Fauvette,
Her mistress would be much upset.
For me, at an event so tristc,
I should not worry in the least,
I do so hate the little beast.
DUM-DUM.
A wit has applied the term “Lime-
wash” to Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's style

cELLOR's new private secretary is

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. OLIVER ONIONs is the latest expositor of the art of
what might be called the concurrent sequel. I remember
that, when he published the further history of Jim Jeffries
under the title of The Debit Account, I complained that
only those with some previous knowledge of his past could
make out what it was all about. In the present volume,
The Story of Louie (SECKER), he has been so far from
repeating this mistake that Louie's story is entirely and
absorbingly complete in itself; and only when about two-
thirds of the way through did I suddenly find myself in
familiar company. This many-sided consideration of one
history is a fascinating development of fiction, which may
however be overdone. Certainly the previous books had
given me no idea that there was so much in Louie. I am
inclined indeed to call her the most attractive figure in all
Mr. ONIONs' rather sombre company. Child of a runaway
match between an artist's model (who was also a pugilist)
and a lady of quality, Louie is throughout the true daughter
of such parents. She is a fighter, but she fights clean.
Her upbringing by a mother who is ashamed of her; her
attempt to earn independence at a gardening academy; the
episode of her early love and its consequences—all these
are so vividly told that, long before she met Jim Jeffries at
the Business College, Louie had become for me absolutely
according to the previous books, she had played but a sub-
ordinate part I now regarded exclusively as it concerned
her. On which, since it was presumably just what Mr.
ONIONs intended, I make him my felicitations, coupling
with them a gentle hope that he will now leave this some-
what depressing affair and tell us about another.
One of the chief attractions of that pleasant writer, Mr.
ARCHIBALD MARSHALL, is the natural and unvexed fluency
of style by which he communicates to the reader something
of his own atmosphere of ease and confidence. It may be
that in The Honour of the Clintons (STANLEY PAUL) the
narrative is at times a little too unstudied; that a little
more selection of detail might have strengthened it;
that the dialogue, always extraordinarily probable, might
with advantage have indulged our imaginations more freely;
but these are the defects of a sound virtue. The plot of Mr.
MARSHALL's clever story is concerned with a theft committed
by a lady at a country-house party. A hint of her guilt is
dropped rather early in the tale, but this matters less because
the theft and its exposure, though no doubt they provided the
author with his original motive for making the book, interest
us chiefly for their effect on the character of someone who
had no sort of hand in the crime. Pompous, dictatorial,
thoroughly satisfied with himself and the Providence that
has made him what he is, the Head of the House of Clinton
is suddenly asked to face this blow that falls upon his


human and real; so much so that the tragedy wherein,
family's honour, and in the test discovers an unsuspected

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. OLIVER ONIONs is the latest expositor of the art of
what might be called the concurrent sequel. I remember
that, when he published the further history of Jim Jeffries
under the title of The Debit Account, I complained that
only those with some previous knowledge of his past could
make out what it was all about. In the present volume,
The Story of Louie (SECKER), he has been so far from
repeating this mistake that Louie's story is entirely and
absorbingly complete in itself; and only when about two-
thirds of the way through did I suddenly find myself in
familiar company. This many-sided consideration of one
history is a fascinating development of fiction, which may
however be overdone. Certainly the previous books had
given me no idea that there was so much in Louie. I am
inclined indeed to call her the most attractive figure in all
Mr. ONIONs' rather sombre company. Child of a runaway
match between an artist's model (who was also a pugilist)
and a lady of quality, Louie is throughout the true daughter
of such parents. She is a fighter, but she fights clean.
Her upbringing by a mother who is ashamed of her; her
attempt to earn independence at a gardening academy; the
episode of her early love and its consequences—all these
are so vividly told that, long before she met Jim Jeffries at
the Business College, Louie had become for me absolutely
according to the previous books, she had played but a sub-
ordinate part I now regarded exclusively as it concerned
her. On which, since it was presumably just what Mr.
ONIONs intended, I make him my felicitations, coupling
with them a gentle hope that he will now leave this some-
what depressing affair and tell us about another.
One of the chief attractions of that pleasant writer, Mr.
ARCHIBALD MARSHALL, is the natural and unvexed fluency
of style by which he communicates to the reader something
of his own atmosphere of ease and confidence. It may be
that in The Honour of the Clintons (STANLEY PAUL) the
narrative is at times a little too unstudied; that a little
more selection of detail might have strengthened it;
that the dialogue, always extraordinarily probable, might
with advantage have indulged our imaginations more freely;
but these are the defects of a sound virtue. The plot of Mr.
MARSHALL's clever story is concerned with a theft committed
by a lady at a country-house party. A hint of her guilt is
dropped rather early in the tale, but this matters less because
the theft and its exposure, though no doubt they provided the
author with his original motive for making the book, interest
us chiefly for their effect on the character of someone who
had no sort of hand in the crime. Pompous, dictatorial,
thoroughly satisfied with himself and the Providence that
has made him what he is, the Head of the House of Clinton
is suddenly asked to face this blow that falls upon his


























human and real; so much so that the tragedy wherein,
family's honour, and in the test discovers an unsuspected

the author's grasp over
nobility. All the delicate phases of the struggle between con-
science and the instinct of self-preservation are analysed by
the author with the very nicest judgment. Mr. MARSHALL's
familiarity with the externals of this type has long been
recognised, but here he is not content with just a true
picture of life in a setting well-observed; he has attempted
a difficult problem in psychology, and brought a very sure
hand to his task. He has many admirers, and this new
book promises to add much to the stature, and even more
to the quality, of his reputation. - -
Let those who are fatigued by the novel of problem and
of purpose turn to How Many Miles to Babylon? (CoNSTABLE)
and seek refreshment. One is naturally chary of super-
latives when writing of a new novelist, but I can honestly
say that no “first book” has for many years impressed me
more than Miss IRWIN's. Mab, the heroine, is taken
through her childhood and school-days (which are most
vividly described), until she returns to her relations, who
on the downward path, haunted by what he might have
been, is in itself excellent. Unfortunately the author has
by no means done it justice in treatment. His characters
are like nothing on earth. I thought the Jew financier was
unreal enough, when, just for melodrama, he made an
appointment with the now ruined Ryderdale at midnight,
and dared his victim to murder him. Which the latter
promptly did, with sufficient ingenuity, by means of a
poisoned syphon. And then the Home Secretary—but no,
you must really find out for yourself how he came in an
easy winner in the race for incredibility. I have said just
enough not to spoil the story for those who like this sort of
thing, and to avert the danger of deadly boredom from those
who don't.

the flight itself, but one may well regret the attempt to
make so much of what is rather attenuated material. For
the rest, however, I am not only a captive to the curiously
delightful atmosphere of the book, but also an enthusiastic
admirer of the skill with which a most difficult character
has been handled.
I had always supposed that any fool could make money
in the late rubber boom. But apparently I was wrong.
This certainly was not the experience of Sir Derrek Ryder-
dale. But then he was the hero of The Lost Destiny
(STANLEY PAUL), and in many respects an exceptional man.
Things happened to him as they do not happen to ordinary
persons. For example, he had a visitation in a railway
carriage from an invisible voice (something like the gnat
and Alice) which warned him concerning his future. A
little later on a bold bad financier—possibly in active league
with the Evil One, but of this I am not certain—gave him
two hundred pounds to gamble with in return for half his
winnings during four years. So IRyderdale took the money,
and abandoned his alternative career as an Empire-builder
for that of a plunger. It was here that I detected the root
idea that alone saves Mr. C. WILLIERs STUART's story from

in none is the point fairly developed; the reader is informed
that such and such a thing happened but is not given to
understand why. There are, besides, two pervading faults.
In the first place the politics are bigoted. Many will agree
that Miss MANN's opponents are a misguided party, but
even they are not to be dismissed in such an offhand
manner. In the second place the few serious attempts at
characterization achieve little more than an unhappy class
distinction, feminine merits being confined to the upper
ten and masculine virtues to members of the Senior
Service. The three that remain are “The Setting Sun,”
an elegy; “Beetles,” a gruesome but delightful incident,
and “Medlars,” an incomparable jest. There is that about
the two last named that leads me to suspect that the author,
if she would subject herself to a process of ruthless self-
criticism and elimination, could produce a book of short
stories not unworthy of that great model, MAUPASSANT.
“It was decided that the members should endeavour to raise a
fund for a marble font by asking parents who had had their children

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 16, 1913.
LEAVES FROM THE BEERBOH M TREE
OF KNOWLEDGE.
[In friendly imitation of the first chapter—entitled “Our Betters”
—of Sir HERBERT TREE's recently published Thoughts and Aſter-
thoughts.]
WHAT is a gentleman? I once assisted at a banquet
which was graced by the presence of a number of actor-
managers. A humorist, called upon for a speech, addressed
the company as “Knights and Gentlemen!” The dis-
tinction is only superficial, for they have much in common.
A gentleman is one who does not care a coat-tail button
whether he is a gentleman or not; and a knight is one who
is so little concerned about his title that he would just as
soon be a baronet. - - -
Sweet are the uses of the University and the Public
School if your sole object is
“to merge in form and gloss
The picturesque of man and man.”
But I have never found that SHAKSPEARE, who was neither
at Oxford (like BENson) nor Cambridge (like ADRIAN Ross)
was the worse for that defect. The triumphs of the author
of “Endymion” were not won on the playing-fields of
Eton, and Robert BURNs could never have learned to write
“For a’ that ” at Harrow. - - -
My own ideal type is the peasant. I have often come
away a better man from holding converse with a yokel.
He is nearest to Nature. For one who has given his life to
Art such intercourse is a fine corrective.
I have spoken slightingly of University education. I
will do so again. My brother MAX has often complained
bitterly to me of the damage done to his genius by his six
years' residence (if I have got the period right) at Oxford.
Had it not been for the disabilities which he acquired at
that seat of learning so-called, he thinks, poor boy, that he
might have rivalled me as an actor. There is BourchIER,
of course. But it is not given to everyone to pass through
the University and still keep, as he kept, the divine spark
unquenched.
There are many kinds of snobbery. One might indeed
devote an entire book to the subject of snobs. It would
have made a good theme for THACKERAY.
To recur to the question of University education. You
will seldom find a sailor who has taken the degree of Master
of Arts at one of the Universities. Yet no class of men is
more keenly intelligent about splicing a rope or boxing a
binnacle. And why? Because they are constantly in touch
with the elements. On the other hand I have never known
a man to escape sea-sickness through wearing a University
ribbon on his hat. I think, without conceit, that I have
proved my point this time. * . . -
Self-respect is the very tap-root of the oak of indepen-
dence. But it must be watered with humour and manured
with modesty. Only the greatest—and therefore the most
modest—actors can afford to dispense with the limelight.
The curse of dramatic art is the publicity which it entails.
If I had my way the names of the cast should not be
given on the programme, and every actor should disguise
his own identity; so that at the fall of the curtain the stalls
would ask one another, “Which was TREE 2 ”
The Spirit of the Age is undergoing a sea-change. Put
your ear to the shell upon the shore and you will hear the
rumble of the on-coming armies of Liberty and Equality,
as they burst through the barbed wires of convention and
sweep away the landmarks of vested interests. That is
what I mean when I speak of a sea-change.
Too long have we been licking the boots of “Our Betters.”
But there is a cloud to every silver lining; and, when
to sacrifice the privilege of patronising “Our Worses.” We
shall all be on the same rung of the ladder—probably the
bottom one. -
Those who have never suffered from the disease of self-
consciousness will be left unaffected by the sea-change to
which I have referred. This applies peculiarly to the lead-
ing exponents of the drama. For the purposes of creative
Art we may have imitated “Our Betters,” but we have never
recognised them as such. A Duke or a Marquess—they
are all one to us. -
To strain after originality is to confess oneself a Philis-
tine. The note of genius is inevitability. How was it that
the late GEORGE WASHINGTON spoke the truth so ably? Not
because he was trying to distinguish himself from his
fellows, but because he couldn't help it. I knew a Hamlet
who wanted to be original about his dying. For weeks he
fell dead without distinction, and then, one night, at the
supreme moment, he slipped up on a banana-skin thrown
from the gallery—and brought down the house. One
touch of Nature often has this effect.
It was SHAKSPEARE who said, “To thine own self be
true.”. SHAKSPEARE could say almost anything better
than almost anybody else. Yet there have been other
great writers whom I could mention if I gave thought to
it.
and GoFTHE are names that occur to me. -
Two of the greatest developments of our era are Eugenics
and Boy Scouts. I remember once hearing of a congenital
idiot who accidentally severed an artery and, in the absence
of First Aid, bled to death. It was for lack of a Boy
Scout that he died; and it was for lack of Eugenics that he
was ever born. -
The minority of to-day becomes the majority of to-morrow;
and it is no less true that the majority of to-day becomes
the minority of to-morrow. Life is full of these strange |
paradoxes—if that is the word I mean. The rain falls equally
on the just and the unjust, but chiefly on the just, because
the unjust takes the just's umbrella. The only safe course
for the just is to shelter under the spreading chestnut Tree.
O. S.
PETER PIGEON.
THE pigeons dwell in Pimlico; they mingle in the street;
They flutter at Victoria around the horses' feet;
They fly to meet the royal trains with many a loyal phrase
And strut to greet their sovereign on strips of scarlet baize;
But Peter, Peter Pigeon, is in his cradle days.
The pigeons build in Bloomsbury; they rear their classic |
homes -
Where pedants clamber sable steps to search forgotten |
tomes; -
They haunt Ionic capitals with learnéd lullabies
And each laments in anapaests and in iambics cries;
But Peter, Peter Pigeon, how sleepily he sighs.
The pigeons walk the Guildhall, they dress in civic taste
With amplitude of mayoral chain and aldermanic waist;
They bow their grey emphatic heads, their top-knots rise
and fall
While clustering in the courtyard at their mid-day
dinner-call; -
But Peter, Peter Pigeon, he nods beneath my shawl.
The pigeons brood in Battersea; while yet the dawn is dark
Their reedy aubade ripples in the plane-trees round the
park;
They light upon your balcony, a brave and comely band,
Till night decoys their coral feet, their voices low and bland;
Meanwhile, Moses, Sophocles, DANTE, CERVANTEs
|
everybody is as good as everybody else, we must be prepared
But Peter, Peter Pigeon, his feet are in my hand.

Leslie (naughty, and sent into the hall to finish his dinner). “TELL THE PERson who 's
sERVING THERE's No ANSWER.”
CHANCE, THE FRIEND.
HE got in at Southampton West—a
retired Army man, I should guess, florid
and with a bristling sandy moustache.
All too soon he caught my eye. This
orb was not out for capture at the
moment; it merely rose inadvertently
from my book while I turned a page
and rested a fraction of a second too
long on the newcomer's countenance.
But it was enough. It was all he
needed, and in a moment he was off.
“With this wet wicket,” he said,
“Oxford ought to win.”
I said in reply as little as I could
and resumed my reading.
“That fellow, MELLE,” he went on.
He'll do the trick. Very artful, those
Colonials. Remember LE CouTEUR 2 ”
I had to confess to a recollection of
LE CouTEUR.
“RHoDEs scholar, you know. South
African, I believe, or was it New Zea-
I had no suggestion to offer, although
I knew that LE CouTEUR was neither,
but an Australian.
“Well, anyway,” he pursued, “he
was that kind of bowler, too. If
Oxford wins the toss they ought to put
Cambridge in after all this rain. I did
that once at Cheltenham, I remember,
and the other side thought I was mad.
But we beat them.”
I made such a determined dive at
my book that for a while he was mute.
Then he relented.
“Funny thing,” he said, “but I'm
sure to see old ToM Hobson at Lord's
to-day. I see him every Warsity match.
I once scored off ToM—he's a ground
bowler, you know. We were on tour,
and I bet him half-a-sovereign I'd
reach my hundred wickets before he
did. We got to ninety-eight all, and
then I took him off and put myself on
and made up the hundred. You should
have seen ToM's face | He said it
going to let him win if I could help it;
not likely. We have a laugh over it
every year. Are you a cricketer ?”
I said I had dabbled in the game.
“Nothing like it,” he said. “It's
the best game. I wish I wasn't too
old. Lawn tennis and golf for me
now; but just at the present moment
neither. The fact is I've crocked my-
self up.”
I had to ask how.
“Broke a muscle in my leg,” he said.
“Just as I was serving. Most ex-
traordinary sensation. Exactly as if
some one had thrown a stone and hit
me in the calf. As a matter of fact, I
looked round to see who had done it.
I'm going up to town now to see one
of those Swedish masseur fellows; but
not till they draw stumps at Lord's, of
course.”
The train stopping at Winchester
gave me the opportunity to buy a
paper and change my seat. Another
man getting in took mine, and I won-
dered how soon the chatterbox would
do it on him. He merely waited for
the train to start and then began.
“Not a very promising day for the
Warsity match?” he said.
The other agreed.
“You going?” he asked.
The other admitted that he was.
I then succeeded in getting into the
power of my book again and happily
lost some of the connecting links, the
next thing I caught being these words:
“But as a matter of fact I can't play
anything just now. I've gone and
crocked myself up. Broken a muscle
in my calf. Have you ever done that ?
The newcomer had not and hoped
he never would.
“Well, you never know,” he was
assured. “Lots of men have done it
this year. It is the most extraordinary
thing. Exactly as if some one had
thrown a stone hard and hit you. In
fact, I looked round to see who it was.”
At Basingstoke the newcomerchanged
his compartment and another traveller
entered and took the fatal seat, and he
too was put through it.
But now an unprecedented thing hap-
pened, which I ask no one to believe,
but which none the less is true. The
conversation had followed its usual
course—the weather, the wet wicket,
the Colonial bowler, the Cheltenham
triumph, the low subterfuge on ToM—
all as though I had not already heard
it twice; and I sat and marvelled at
such a want of delicacy of feeling, such
amazing hardihood and metallic insen-
sitiveness; because I am one of those
foolish creatures who are miserable for
an hour if they catch themselves telling

THE SEARCH FOR OLYMPIC TALENT.
A PATRIOTIC FARMER TURNS A FIERCE BULL INTO A FIELD IN OBDER TO TEST THE HURDLING POSSIBILITIES OF HIS FARM-HANDS.
The talker of the L. & S. W. R.
was, however, not like that, and on he
wont undismayed until he reached the
broken muscle. It was then that the
unexpected occurred, for no sooner did
the newcomer learn of the calamity than
he chipped in.
“Yes, I know what that is,” he said.
“I've done it too. Most extraordinary
sensation—exactly as if you'd been hit
in the calf by a stone!"
My talker, who had been all fussy
animation till then, suddenly petrified.
His mouth was open but no words
emerged. He scrutinised his vis-à-vis
with a cold and glassy gaze. Some-
how he seemed to scent a “plant" or
conspiracy, although knowing that there
could not be one, for collusion had
been impossible. He even glanced
suspiciously at me, as I could feel.
“Yes,” repeated the other, all un-
conscious of his Promethean theft;
--
“it’s the rummest feeling. Just here
—he touched his calf. “Exactly, as
I say, as if someone had thrown a stone
at you."
The conversationalist feebly ac-
quiesced and turned to his paper. The
other man turned to his paper, and we
had silence all the way to Vauxhall.
I swear this is a true story.
The worst of it is that it was pure
chance and could not be adopted as a
THE SEASON.
(To a Débutante.)

To dance, to flirt, to laugh, to shine
Like some new star;
To wear gay gowns and strange-dressed

And hats that make the people stare
Or say we are
Original, as it may be—
Yes, that, my dear, for you and me
The Season means;
But for the girls who shape our frocks,
Our headgear (and, maybe, our locks)—
Some in their teens
Perhaps, as we-the Season holds
Quite other things. Tucks, hems and
folds,
Gauze, silk and lace
They wield for us with close-eyed care,
White-faced and worn, so we be fair
And take our “place”;

Whose backs are bent that we may
please.
For us to stitch,
Their fingers fly or else their wheels;
Their very dreams build cotton-reels |

And cares not for their fading bloom.

Lest, as we flit from flower to flower,
Our honey will at last turn sour!
So, should we not
Remember, now we both are “out,”
When we (for trifles) pine and pout,
Or moan our lot,
That there are maidens still more sad
Who, were they bidden, would be glad

Willing, as we, like stars to shine,
To pick and choose

THE BIRTH DAY PRESENT.
“It's my birthday to-morrow,” said
Mrs. Jeremy, as she turned the pages
of her engagement book.
“Bless us, so it is,” said Jeremy.
“You’re thirty-nine or twenty-seven
or something. I must go and examine
the wine-cellar. I believe there's one
bottle left in the Apollinaris bin. It's
the only stuff in the house that fizzes.”
“Jeremy I'm only twenty-six.”
“You don't look it, darling; I mean
you do look it, dear. What I mean–
well, never mind that. Let's talk
about birthday presents. Think of
something absolutely tremendous for
me to give you.”
“A rope of pearls.”
“I didn't mean that sort of tremen-
dousness,” said Jeremy quickly. “Any-
one could give you a rope of pearls;
it's simply a question of overdrawing
enough from the bank. I meant some-
thing difficult that would really prove
my love for you—like LLoyd GEORGE's
ear or the KAISER's cigar - holder.
Something where I could kill some-
body for you first. I am in a very
devoted mood this morning.”
“Are you really 2” smiled Mrs.
Jeremy. “Because * x
“I am. So is Baby, unfortunately.
She will probably want to give you
something horribly expensive. Between
ourselves, dear, I shall be glad when
Baby is old enough to buy her own
presents for her mother. Last Christ-
mas her idea of a complete edition of
MEREDITH and a pair of silver-backed
brushes nearly ruined me.”
“You won't be ruined this time,
Jeremy. I don't want you to give me
anything; I want you to show that
devotion of yours by doing something
for me.”
“Anything,” said Jeremy grandly.
“Shall I swim the Channel? I was
practising my new trudgeon stroke in
the bath this morning.” He got up
from his chair and prepared to give an
exhibition of it.
“No, nothing like that.” Mrs.
Jeremy hesitated, looked anxiously at
him and then went boldly at it. “I
want you to go in for that physical
culture that everyone's talking about.”
“Who's everyone? Cook hasn't
said a word to me on the subject;
neither has Baby; neither has—”
“Mrs. Hodgkin was talking to me
about it yesterday. She was saying
how thin you were looking.”
“The scandal that goes on in these
villages,” sighed Jeremy. “And the
Vicar's wife too. Dear, all this is
weeks and weeks old; I suppose it has
only just reached the Vicarage. Do
has been quite démodé since last Thurs-
day.”
*well. I never saw anything in the
paper yx
“Knowing what wives are I hid
it from you. Let us now, my dear
wife, talk of something else.” -
“Jeremy Not for my birthday
present 2" said his wife in a reproach-
ful voice. “The Vicar does them every
morning,” she added casually.
“Poor beggar ! But it’s what Vicars
are for.” Jeremy chuckled to himself.
“I should love to see him,” he said.
“I suppose it's private, though. Per-
haps if I said “Press'—”
“You are thin, you know.”
“My dear, the proper way to get ſat
is not to take violent exercise, but to lie
in a hammock all day and drink milk.
Besides, do you want a fat husband?
Does Baby want a fat father? You
wouldn't like, at your next garden
party, to have everybody asking you in
a whisper, “Who is the enormously
stout gentleman?' If Nature made me
thin–or, to be more accurate, slender
and of a pleasing litheness—let us
believe that she knew best.”
“It isn't only thinness; these exer-
cises keep you young and well and
active in mind.”
“Like the Vicar 2 ”
“He’s only just begun,” said his
wife hastily. -
“Let’s wait a bit and watch him,”
suggested Jeremy. “If his sermons
really get better, then I'll think about
it seriously. I make you a present of
his baldness; I shan't ask for any
improvement there.”
Mrs. Jeremy went over to her hus-
band and patted the top of his head.
“In a very devoted mood this morn-
ing,’” she quoted.
Jeremy looked unhappy.
“What pains me most about this,”
he said, “is the revelation of your short-
comings as a wife. You ought to think
me the picture of manly beauty. Baby
does. She thinks that, next to the
postman, I am one of the-"
“So you are, dear.”
“Well, why not leave it? Really,
I can't waste my time fattening refined
gold and stoutening the lily. I am a
busy man. I walk up and down the
pergola, I keep a dog, I paint little
water-colours, I am treasurer of the
cricket club; my life is full of activities.”
“This only takes a quarter of an
hour before your bath, Jeremy.”
“I am shaving then; I should cut
myself and get all the soap in my eyes.
It would be most dangerous. When
you were a widow, and Baby and the
pony were orphans, you and Mrs.
Hodgkin would be sorry. But it would
self away from Position 5 to conduct
the funeral service * >
“Jeremy, don't l”
“Ah, woman, now I move you. You
are beginning to see what you were in
danger of doing. Death I laugh at ;
but a fat death—the death of a stout
man who has swallowed the shaving-
brush through taking too deep a breath
before beginning Exercise 3, that is
more than I can bear.”
“Jeremy 1"
“When I said I wanted to kill some-
one for you, I didn't think you would
suggest myself, least of all that you
wanted me fattened up like a Christmas
turkey first. To go down to posterity
as the large-bodied gentleman who in-
haled the badger's hair; to be billed in
the London press in the words, “Curious
Fatal Accident to Adipose Treasurer’—
to do this simply by way of celebrating
your twenty-sixth birthday, when we
actually have a bottle of Apollinaris
left in the Apollinaris bin—darling, you
cannot have been thinking.”
His wife patted his head again
gently. “Oh, Jeremy, you hopeless
person,” she sighed. “Give me a new
sunshade. I want one badly.”
“No,” said Jeremy, “Baby shall give
you that. For myself I am still feeling
that I should like to kill somebody for
you. LLoyd GEORGE 2 No. F. E.
SMITH 2 N-no. . . .” He rubbed his
head thoughtfully. “Who invented
those exercises?” he asked suddenly.
“A German, I think.” -
“Then,” said Jeremy, buttoning up
his coat, “I shall go and kill him.”

in Punch some examples of truthful

be spreading. We have before us the
following remarkable announcement of
a Tourist Company:—
A WEEK iN DELIGHTFUL EAUVILLE

(and certain additions which will be
apparent to those who read further).
SELECT PARTIES
(as select as can be expected in view of
the fact that nobody who pays the fees
is refused) will leave London every
Saturday evening until further notice
and return to London on the following
Friday morning.
(The advertised “week” therefore in-
cludes the days of departure and return.)
Charge (payable strictly in advance)—
£5 5s. 0d.
(This, however, means 3rd Class travel
throughout. For 2nd Class the ad-
ditional charge is £1; and for First
Class £2 5s. 0d.)
Accommodation is provided in a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FRoM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, July 7.
—“The Angel of Death is abroad in
the land.” Once again the PREMIER
stood at the Table in presence of a
crowded, hushed assembly, heads
reverently uncovered as if in the actual
presence of Death. It was only a few
weeks ago that lament was raised
for GEORGE WYNDHAM. To-day it is
the sudden cutting-off of ALFRED
LYTTELTON that makes the House of
Commons a house of mourning.
Points of resemblance make more
striking the close se-
quence of their deaths.
Both men were in the
prime of life; both when
last seen at Westmin-
ster were apparently in
full enjoyment of health
and strength; both,
having by sheer capa-
city won their way to
high place in the ranks
of their Party, seemed
to have before them a
long career of useful
work; upon both with
awful suddenness came
the end.
There was one notable
absentee from Front
Opposition Bench. It
seemed natural, indeed
imperative, that, as
happened in the case
of GEORGE WYNDHAM,
PRINCE ARTHUR should
add his wreath of
“myrtles brown with
ivy never sere” to the
garland laid by the
PRIME MINISTER on the
bier of his lost friend. Shrinking from
that ordeal he did not even trust him-
self to be present. It was left to the
titular LEADER of THE OPPosition to
voice the grief of ALFRED LYTTELTON's
personal colleagues on the Front Bench
and the sorrow of the Party he graced
and strengthened by his comradeship.
Not least arduous among the duties
pertaining to office of Party Leader
is that of from time to time paying a
tribute to the memory of a great man
dead. On an historic occasion DISRAELI,
called to fill the part, was so prostrated
by emotion that he inadvertently appro-
priated a purple patch from a funeral
oration by a French statesman, incor-
porating it in what was presented to
the House of Commons as his personal
lamentation. Mr. GLADSTONE was a
master of the art; so in differing styles
was CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN and is

SARK, who has political situation.
listened to a long succession of funeral
speeches delivered from either side of
the Table, testifies that for genuine
feeling, simplicity of construction and
exquisiteness of phrasing few have
equalled, none surpassed, the PREMIER's
brief speech, uttered with faltering
voice under strain of emotion that more
than once threatened breakdown.
As he said, ALFRED LYTTELTON “has
left behind him no resentment and no
enmity, nothing but a gracious memory
of a manly and winning personality, the
memory of one who served with un-
stinted measure of devotion his genera-
tion and his country.” That a sentiment

in which Members on both sides
shared. For the PREMIER, beyond the
common grief at the passing of one
“who of all men of this generation
came nearest to the ideal of manhood,”
there was the breaking of the link of
thirty-three years' affectionate friend-
ship.
Happy in a pure and healthy life
ALFRED LYTTELTON was honoured in
his death by rare eulogy spoken before
a responsive audience gathered on the
historic stage it was long time his
pleasure and his pride to tread.

Seems to show
that, in spite of angry difference on a
particular question, there exists between
Nationalist and Ulsterman a common
sympathy, a sentiment of brotherhood
jealous for each other's welfare.
Came up accidentally, as such things
frequently do. PREMIER having in
reply to question stated intention of
making new appointment to Laureate-
ship, Joyce rose from Nationalist Camp
with supplementary question.

deration be given to the undoubted

in MooRE, K.C. His
interjectionary contri-
butions to debate rarely
fail in leading to tem-
porary tumult. Only the
other week they led to
his own suspension from
service of the House.
As far as may be judged
from material supplied
by him to brief bio-
graphical notices ap-
pearing in customary
channels of information,
if modesty permits him
to claim special distinc-
tion over his fellow
Members in any parti-
cular, it is based on the
fact that he “stands
6 feet 4} inches in his
boots.” To have dis-
closure made that in
his own country he, in
common with another
MooRE of earlier date,
is recognised as a poet,
was agreeable surprise.
PREMIER took keenest interest in it.
“Perhaps the hon. gentleman,” he
said, addressing Joyce, “will furnish
me with a copy of the poems alluded
to.”
Incident temporarily distracted in-
terest from Plural Voting Bill. Useful
suggestion made from above Gangway
that specimens of the new MooRE
Melodies shall be circulated with the
Votes.

with ColoniaL SECRETARY, who de-
clined to gratify these eminent states-
men by repudiating action of South
African Government in repelling fierce
riot in the streets of Johannesburg.
Among the Standing Orders is one
specially designed to meet case of
divisions thus frivolously demanded.
It directs that after the lapse of two
minutes the SPEAKER or CHAIRMAN
may take the votes of the House or
Committee by calling successively on
the Members who support, and on the
Members who challenge, his decision
to rise in their places. Thereupon he
may declare the determination of the
House or Committee without a division.
It was evident that the patriots
THE BARD OF ARMAgiſ.
(Mr. W. MooRE, K.C.)
below the Gangway had very small
support for their pettish revolt. Indeed
doubtful whether if a division were
called they would have a single Mem-
ber to “tell.” The event proved that
they had seven. Had Standing Order
140 been invoked the undignified per-
formance would have been over in
appropriate manner within space of
three minutes.
“Why,” Members asked each other,
“did the SPEARER, invariably master
of a turn in the situation however
sudden and embarrassing, ignore the
weapon lying to hand?”
As may be expected there was
sufficient reason. Standing Order in
question requires that the minority
Members rising in obedience to
challenge from the Chair must have
their names taken down and printed in
the division list. As it turned out
they, in common with a family known
to WoRDsworth, were seven. They
former occasions, thirty-seven or even
more. In such case, so far from there
being saving of time, there would have
been loss, together with infliction of
undignified labour on the Clerk of the
House. Profiting by past experience
the SPEAKER took no risks.
Moral obvious. Either let the Stand-
ing Order be abolished or amended by
deletion of the provision that the names
of the frivolous persons must be taken
down. It serves no other purpose
than that of ministering to the vanity
and pursuit of self-advertisement that
actuate most of these exhibitions.
Business done.—Report of Plural
Voting Bill agreed to.
LYRA HYPOCHONDRIACA.
(A Chronicle of Cures, with Biography
of a Survivor.)
IN the distant days, when he first began
To ponder the state of his inner man,
He thought he had found in drugs and
pills
A remedy for all human ills.
He drank dry sherry— 'twas called
Montilla—
And dosed himself with sarsaparilla.
But that was only a passing phase,
And he shortly took to other ways.
For then was the time when the
medicos
Were running a boom in cheap Bor-
deaux–
A cool but terribly acid drink
With a bouquet akin to that of red ink.
The next of his hygienic lures
Was the ancient craze for water cures,
And as long as ever the temperance
tide rose
He spent his summers at various hydros.
But, in spite of the eulogy of PINDAR,
When the human throat is as dry as
tinder,
The blameless liquid that flows from
the pump
Is apt to give one the double hump.
So, when his doctor prescribed Glenlivet,
He found himself as right as a trivet,
And hoped to reach life's final coda
Accompanied by whisky and soda.
But here, it seems, he reckoned without
Regard for man's fell enemy, gout;
And, after a spell of dire disquiet,
Again was forced to remodel his diet.
He had to abandon all “prime cuts,”
He took to cutlets, but made of nuts;
And, like a little child in bibs,
Drank nothing stronger than cocoa nibs.
For three long years he underwent
This vegetarian punishment,
Then found (with SALISBURY) relief
In boiling water and half-cooked beef.
Next FLETCHER told him how to chaw
Until his single occupation
Throughout the day was mastication.
But since he could not quite afford
To throw all duties overboard,
And could not help himself, like SMILEs,
He took the counsel of EUSTAce MILEs,
And lived for nearly half a year
On plasmon and on ginger-beer.
Then, feeling for fresh adventure ripe,
He tried the barefoot cure of KNEIPP,
And dabbled in the morning dew
With others neither fit nor few.
Then for a while he placed reliance
In Mrs. Eddy's Christian Science,
Combined with lactobacilline
And copious draughts of paraffin.
But all these fads he has forsworn
And now professes himself re-born
And full of beans as the maddest Mullah
By dint of massage of the medulla.
In short, he's a full-blown osteopath,
But—tell it not in the streets of Gath—
Whenever a new cure comes along,
Whether it's gentle or whether it's
strong,
Such is the faith that fires and fills him,
He'll give it a trial although it kills
him.

BECAUSE I chanced to look up at the
exact instant of time when the illusion
was perfect, I could have sworn—for a
second or so—that the car, like some
swift grey beast, had sprung upon him
from ... with a low roar, gulped
him down whole and vanished, leaving
only a billow of swirling dust to mark
slowly settling dust that the car had
raised.
Then quite suddenly he turned to me.
“A fine car, that, Sir—magnificent.
One of the best I’ve ever been knocked
down by,” he remarked.
I had expected wrath, sorrow, lan-
guage—anything, in fact, but praise of
the car, and I think I showed my
surprise, for he smiled a faint, dusty

a moment later he sat up in the middle
of the road and peered about him,
blinking. A stammering crescendo yell
from the car's exhaust horn came back
to us through the drowsy dusty air, with
a curious effect of mockery—already
she was far off—and the tramp rose,
rather alertly for a tramp. He limped
over to my railings and, with one hand
clutching a post, stared down the road.
He gulped—a long, slow rise, decline
and fall of the “Adam's apple” that
was almost unnerving. He was collar-
less and slightly scrag-necked, so that
I got the full benefit of it.
“A narrow squeak,” I said.
He did not answer immediately. He
merely gulped once more, and, breath-

rather shyly. “Thinking . . . I find

“We parts company here,” he said
decidedly. “But before we parts I'm

he'd only try to learn to get ideas into
his 'ead. . . .”
The little drifter suddenly opened
the tattered rush fish-basket he carried,
disclosing a tightly packed mass of
withered, yellowish vegetable matter,
which he described as salad. His
comrade, the man without ideas, stood
limply by, listening with an extra-
ordinary appearance of guilt.
“I had to think out the idea of
having some salad yesterday,” said the
small drifter with a sort of bitter pride,
“ and I left it to him to get it in a
likely-looking road of houses in Brocken-
hurst, while I worked another road for
a bit of something to go with it. I
waited for him just outside the village
about two hours afterwards with a
knuckle of ham, four fairish crusts, a
heel of cold pudding, and a hand-out
of bread-and-cheese. Presently here
he comes moonin' along the middle of
the road, muttering to hisself. He
stops at me and ‘I’ve got it,' he says.
“Well done,' I says, thinking of salad.
‘Yes,’ he says, “what England wants
is a national wheat belt extending from
one end of the country to the other,
where she can grow her own wheat in
case of war,’ he says.”
“At the expense of the State, with-
out regard to the price of wheat,
imported or otherwise,” put in the first
drifter mildly. “You mustn't forget
the State subsidy.”
The little drifter turned to me with
a gesture of infinite despair.
“There, Mister,” he exclaimed, “now
you can see for yourself. He thinks
about wheat belts for England when
he ought to be borrying a bit of
salad. . . . Why, even when an old
party back by Rufus's Stone took a
fancy to him he couldn't do no good.
It was a mild-looking, peaceful old
party and they got talking together.
I watched 'em, and estimated the old
party would be worth a good shilling
to us, and perhaps more, if this philoso-
pher only used his 'ead and got an idea
to put up on the old party. I edged
up to 'em a bit, and I heard the old
party saying something about he
wished all the world was as peaceful
as the New Forest. But where me or
you would have agreed with him, Sir,
this ridiculous man answers the old
party very cold. ‘I’ve thought it out,’
he says, and I consider that the world
will never be at peace until England
has captured all the navies and made
'em all her own, and supports one
great navy at the expense of all the
navies—tax 'em in proportion,' he says;
and the peaceful old party snorted and
went away without a word or a
shilling!"
The tall drifter looked ashamedly at
his feet.
“He ain't got an idea in his 'ole
body, Sir," insisted the other excitedly,
“and yet I like the man. But we
parts company to-day. It would ruin
me to travel with him any longer.”
“I wouldn't mind so much his not
having no ideas in his 'ead,” continued
the small driſter, “but he ain't reliable.
He spoils chances of odd money that
a baby wouldn't spoil. And yet he's
lucky — he gets plenty of chances.
More than me—but he don't use 'em.
Up on the downs near Winchester a
gentleman, land-measuring or some-
thing, asked him to keep his eye on a spot
on top of the downs and signal to him
when the gentlemen reached the place.
Well, the gentleman climbed up the
downs about a mile and turned round
and waited to be signalled to. But he
never signalled a signal—he was staring
at the clouds in the sky, and he told
me afterwards that he was thinking of
a plan for rejecting - 1

drifter.
“–advertisements on to the clouds

“Searchlights, not cinematographs,”
protested the philosopher feebly.
“All the same,” snapped the small
drifter. “Craziness.”
He half wheeled to the road, hesi-
tated, glanced at the tall drifter with
a curious look that was half affection,
half contempt. “Comin’?” he said;
“I’ll give you one more chance—and
only one. And don't forget it!”
“Yes, John,” said the man without
ideas, and, with a shy nod in my
direction, followed his partner down
the road.
I watched them for a few moments.
Before they were out of sight the
philosopher, with his head bowed in
thought, had edged out into the exact
middle of the road again. . . .
He was a curious character, and I
believe it is quite possible that, some
day, he may even light upon a notion
that will make millionaires of them
both—provided that a motor does not
get him first. But I am quite, quite
certain he will never convince his
little partner that he has ever had an
idea in his life.

Wot I sez Is, IF A MAN AIN'T FULL BY
THE CRITIC IN THE CRADLE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I write to you
for sympathy and, if possible, advice.
An unfortunate spirit of discord is
stirring the hitherto unruffled atmo-
sphere of my home, The Nest, Trafalgar
Road, Shrimpville-on-the-Solent. In a
word, I am beginning to find myself
opposed at almost every point by my
eldest (indeed, I may add, my only)
son, aged four months. Thus I am a
staunch upholder of compulsory vacci-
nation and a staunch enemy of all
daylight-saving schemes, and on both
these vital questions, among many
others, he is in complete disagreement
with me.
It isn't that he says much, if you
understand me. To be accurate, he
communicates with us principally by
means of (1) a smile, (2) a sound not
unlike escaping soda-water, and (3) a
curious trick of waving his legs in the
air. This is where he gains his advan-
tage. It is impossible to argue with
him on his own ground, since I cannot
reproduce his syphon imitation and,
some years ago, I have lost the faculty
of conversing with my legs.
The worst of it is, he appears to
be undermining my influence over his
mother. I will quote a single instance.
Last Saturday evening after tea my
wife and I were sitting in the drawing-
room, while our son reclined in an
extremely unconventional attitude on
a sofa-cushion. I was explaining to
my wife how by really unexampled bad
luck I had been defeated in a match
that afternoon by a golfer with a handi-
cap of sixteen (my own handicap is
nominally twelve, though I frequently
play down to nine or even less).
Suddenly I became aware that my
son's face wore a distinctly sceptical
smile. I regarded him sternly.
“Do you mean to suggest,” I asked,
with a touch of hauteur, “that under
ordinary circumstances Jones is capable
of beating me?”
“Ssszzz,” he replied cynically.
“It is false,” I retorted.
He smiled and rapidly cut a perfect
eight in the air with his right leg.
“Baby grows more intelligent every
you, who a year ago would have
listened to my tale with a sympathy
so deep that I should probably have
acquiesced in her ordering a new hat
from Bond Street by the evening post.
I got up and left the room.
The truth is, Mr. Punch, I cannot
help feeling that my position in this
house is not what it was. Have you
any hints that might conduce to a
restoration of the status quo?
Yours brokenly,

"ALF-PAST TEN, 'I: AIN'T TRYING.”
THE CRITIC IN THE CRADLE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I write to you
for sympathy and, if possible, advice.
An unfortunate spirit of discord is
stirring the hitherto unruffled atmo-
sphere of my home, The Nest, Trafalgar
Road, Shrimpville-on-the-Solent. In a
word, I am beginning to find myself
opposed at almost every point by my
eldest (indeed, I may add, my only)
son, aged four months. Thus I am a
staunch upholder of compulsory vacci-
nation and a staunch enemy of all
daylight-saving schemes, and on both
these vital questions, among many
others, he is in complete disagreement
with me.
It isn't that he says much, if you
understand me. To be accurate, he
communicates with us principally by
means of (1) a smile, (2) a sound not
unlike escaping soda-water, and (3) a
curious trick of waving his legs in the
air. This is where he gains his advan-
tage. It is impossible to argue with
him on his own ground, since I cannot
reproduce his syphon imitation and,

some years ago, I have lost the faculty
of conversing with my legs.
The worst of it is, he appears to
be undermining my influence over his
mother. I will quote a single instance.
Last Saturday evening after tea my
wife and I were sitting in the drawing-
room, while our son reclined in an
extremely unconventional attitude on
a sofa-cushion. I was explaining to
my wife how by really unexampled bad
luck I had been defeated in a match
that afternoon by a golfer with a handi-
cap of sixteen (my own handicap is
nominally twelve, though I frequently
play down to nine or even less).
Suddenly I became aware that my
son's face wore a distinctly sceptical
smile. I regarded him sternly.
“Do you mean to suggest,” I asked,
with a touch of hauteur, “that under
ordinary circumstances Jones is capable
of beating me?”
“Ssszzz,” he replied cynically.
“It is false,” I retorted.
He smiled and rapidly cut a perfect
eight in the air with his right leg.

THE HICCUP.
WE met in a crowd, in fact at Henley Regatta. He
looked quite an old man, though I suppose he must have
been my contemporary—but even of this I am not quite
sure. He was trying to run with a race, had rushed
violently into me, and had panted a request for pardon.
Then a recognising look came over his furrowed face and
he did what all the recognisers do; “My dear old chap,” he
said, “fancy meeting you here! Now I bet you don't
remember me.”
I kept to the rules of the game, put on a look of bright
intelligence and said I remembered his face perfect'y, but
that for the moment his name had escaped me.
“Ah well,” he said, “it’s a good many years since we
met. Old tempus does keep at it, you know; he doesn't
spare any of us, does he? Though, for the matter of that,
you've kept your fig– (hic) wonderfully. Bother this

a motor-car on a bad road. It's indiges—(hic), you know,
an awful nuisance. Now I'll remind you of something that
once happened to (hic) and me, and then I'll lay a thousand

“It was in eighty—(hic)—no, it wasn't ; it was in
eighty—(hic-hic). That was the year in which I shaved off
my(hic), and I can fix it by that. You'd just begun (hic)
in the (hic-hic) and I was thinking of doing the same. It
was very hot weather and I remember you always wore a
white (hic) and patent leather (hic). It was the fashion
then. We weren't so careless about our dress as they are
nowadays. Why, I actually saw a man walking alon
(hic-hic) yesterday in a (hic) and a (hic), and nobody
seemed a bit surprised about it. Well, one morning I met
you in the (hic-hic) and asked you if you were going to
(hic) this year. You said, yes, you were, and would I join
the party. There was just one place left in the (hic) and
if I could manage to come you knew Mrs. (hic) would be
delighted. I said I didn't really know her, but you said
it didn't matter; you'd introduce me properly and look
after me, and it was sure to be all right. Just at that (hic)

“No, I don't know Belmore. You couldn't mistake the
man, once you'd seen him. He had a (hic) in the middle
of his (hic-hic) and twisted his (hic) frightfully when he
spoke. Anyhow, he came up and asked you if you had
room for him in your (hic) party. This was a facer, because
he was about as unpop— (hic) a man as you could find in
the whole of (hic). You began to say something about not
being quite certain as to going this year, as the health of
your (hic) was giving the family a good deal of anxiety, but
you'd let him know later on. However, he wasn't going
to be put off in that way and he started worrying you.
I thought it was time to help you, so I put in my oar and
said, ‘My dear' (hic)—I wasn't bothered with these infernal
hiccups then—'my dear chap,' I said, ‘can’t you see that
the whole thing's off this year? If (hic) can't undertake
it nobody else can. We'll hope for better (hic) next year.'
Before he could say anything there was a frightful clatter
which made us all jump, and a (hic) with his (hic-hic)
dangling on the ground came dashing along right on top of
us. You and I got out of the way just in time, but old
thingummy wasn't so lucky. It took him right plumb in
the (hic), and before you could say (hic-hic) he was sprawl-
ing on his (hic) and shouting for help. He wasn't much
hurt—just a few (hic) and a deepish (hic) on his (hic), but
great blessing for us, for he'd have ruined any party with
his (hic) and his (hic). That's the story, and now I'll
guarantee you remember me.”
But at this moment another race came past, and he was
swept away in a mob of running enthusiasts. When I last ||
heard him he was shouting at the top of his voice, “Oh,
well rowed (hic); you're gaining. Keep it (hic) and get

OUR REVIEW OF REVUES.
To the many and terrific attractions of “High ER UP,
THERE!” the dazzlingly successful revue at the National
Classical Theatre, is about to be added for one week only
no less a personage than ABDUL HAMID, ex-Sultan of
Turkey, who has been induced to leave his retirement for
one week for this novel engagement. The famous ci-devant
autocrat will recite in Turkish some of Mr. WILLIAM
WATson's choicest poetry, in a gorgeous Oriental scena
entitled “The Seraglio of Dubec.”
Although the Escurial is still filled to overflowing every
night by the noble and stimulating revue entitled “This
SIDE UP,” the indefatigable Messrs. Bonjour and Remercie
are continually endeavouring to paint their lily. For next
week they promise us an interlude by Etienne Soleil, the
champion French polisher, for whom a special setting has
been prepared by one of their numerous brilliant and witty
tame authors.
It is not, after all, true that KING ALFONso will appear
at the Monodrome during next week in a scene written for
him in the fabulously successful revue, “This WAY OUT;" |
but the ever alert management have obtained instead the
services of La Goulue, the ancient French dancer, now a
dompteuse famous in all the foires of France for her
“blessures terribles.”
The striking and gratifying success of the French revue
in London has decided the management to follow it with
the vivacious and brilliant piece from the Moulin d'Or
which took all Paris by storm last year. The title of the
forthcoming revue is “MossIEUR ET MADAME " ("Mr.
and Mrs.”).
Last Monday the all-conquering Gramodrome revue,
“OH ! OH ! HUGTIME 1" for which the “Revue King"
wrote his most brilliant libretto, not a word of which, we
understand, has ever been departed from (surely a great
triumph in an entertainment of this kind'), entered upon
its extra special edition. Among the most fascinating of
its “stop press” novelties is a burlesque of the Oxford and
Cambridge cricket match, with rag-time songs between the
overs, while Mr. Beerbohm Vienna, from Jamaica, gives an
exhibition of how the Mango should really be eaten.
The cast of a magnificent and superb revue at the Solace,
entitled, “RETURNED EMPTY,” is to be still further strength-
ened in a novel way by the addition of three troupes of rag-
time singers from America, each from a different Southern
state, whose speciality it is to sing all together, each of the
three troupes executing a different song. The effect is said
to be very startling, combining as it does the delights of

MR. JACK LoNDON is, I think, the most exhausting writer
I know. Lest this should be taken for other than the
genuine tribute I intend it to be, I had better hasten to
explain. What I mean is that he can bring physical hard-
ships and fatigue so convincingly before the reader that, for
my own part, I rise from some chapters of his writing
feeling as if I ached in every limb. I had this sensation
stronger than ever just now, after reading Smoke Bellew
(MILLs AND Boon). Here Mr. LoNDoN is back in that
Klondyke country that he has made specially his own, and
has already mined with such excellent results. Smoke
Bellew however has this to distinguish him from other
heroes of the district, that you make his acquaintance
while he is still a genuine chechaquo (I put in that word
because it sounds jolly and I have just learnt it—the mean-
ing is tenderfoot, or amateur, or what you will) and watch
the process of his gradual hardening. This is where the
aches come in. I defy anybody to read of Smoke's journey
to the Yukon, a chapter that deserves to be called an epic
of fatigue, without sharing the gensations of its hero. It
would, I am sure, give an appetite to the most dyspeptic.
Arrived, Smoke and his partner Shorty have of course
adventures in plenty, culminating in a breathless race with
dog-teams, that leaves them with half of a million-dollar
claim and the hero with a prospect of matrimonial bliss.
Myself I didn't care over-much for his prospective bride;
forgive her the trick by which—in the early stages of their
acquaintance—she had deprived Smoke and Shorty of the
results of their night march to Squaw Creek. But you do
not go to Mr. LoNDoN for wedding-bells. You go to him
for tales of endurance and for sheer breath-taking adven-
ture, and here there is no living writer that I know of to
equal him. He has them all beat.
I believe that Mrs. Coxon, whose new novel, April
Panhasard (LANE), has just held my attention, would have
found everything simpler had she not been determined to
enforce sprightliness in her characters. April Panhasard
herself is clearly a very nice agreeable woman, but she is
compelled to wriggle into wit every time that she opens her
mouth; and this compulsion, together with the fact that
“her hair in the shadowy light gleamed like a saint's aura,
burnished, mystical,” prevents her from showing the natural
simple side of her character. She goes into retirement
whilst her divorce case is proceeding, tells her neighbours
(all of them, by the way, as sprightly as herself) that she is
a widow, goes about with a young man, loves an American,
and of course starts the sprightly tongues wagging. Then
Mrs. Coxon obviously felt that this little plot was neither
long enough nor strong enough for three hundred pages, so
she brought in some characters out of an earlier novel of
hers, with a child who is prettily loquacious until he is
suddenly killed in the hunting-field. The child's death is
well written and shows one that Mrs. Coxon would write
a fine novel could she but allow her people to speak

and I doubt if Mr. LoNDON did either. I found it hard to
and act for themselves and could she avoid such sentences

as “A faint thrill of fear raced through her veins,” or “A
little sob escaped her, wrung from her full heart.” I like
her conception of her characters, but they are not given
any very interesting things to do and their emotions are
far too crudely stated.
Much is expected from a son of the man who wrote The
Life of Lord Macaulay. The reader need not fear disap-
ointment in taking up The Life of John Bright (CossTABLE),
º GEORGE MACAULAY TREVELYAN. His literary skill is
shown in connection with various episodes, notably in the
admirably condensed but vivid narrative of the Corn Law
League Campaign, culminating in the surrender of PEEL
and the establishment of originally obscure men like BRIGHT
and CoBDEN in the foremost rank of statesmanship, their
aid courted by both, camps. Disclosure is made of a
remarkable overture by DISRAELI when defeat of his Budget
of 1852 appeared imminent. Late on a December evening
“For heaven's sake, what is the matter? Let's hear it
and have done with it !” This is what I came near to
crying aloud many times during the early chapters of
James Hurd (HEINEMANN). But when I knew the horror
of course it was by no means done with. For deliberate
and unshrinking analysis of a hateful situation, commend
me to Mr. R. O. ProwsE. Of the great cleverness of his
book there can be no question; considered as an entertain-
ment, I would rather go to the dentist's than endure it
again. It is impossible to give an idea of it without reveal-
ing the plot; but this matters less since it is the treatment
for which it should be read by all who value artistry more
than good spirits. Well, then, James Hurd and his wife
Evelyn had one child, a boy of seven years, who, as the
result of an accident, had become maimed incurably both in
body and mind. And the parents, having for his sake left
the town, where they both enjoyed full and vigorous lives,
for the depths of the country, had nothing to do but brood
and develop suspicions

Club, asking him to

life this assumed some-

and estrangements and
hatreds. So at last one
day the father took the
boy for a walk to the
cliff-edge — and came
back alone. You could
hardly call it a pleasant
|story, could you? It
is told by a third per-
son, an old friend of the
unhappy parents, who
is staying with them;
and this particular
method adds a quality
of detached and almost
unemotional dryness to
the tragedy that makes
it far more horrible.
It is indeed a fine piece
of literary work, power-
ful, subtle, and sinister.
But I should be very
careful as to the per-
sons to whom I recom-
mended it.
Mr. GoAD has chosen
arrogance. An example is supplied in a remark he
made comparing his style of oratory with another's.
“When I speak,” he said, “I strike across from headland
to headland. Mr. GLADSTONE follows the coast line, and
when he comes to a navigable river he is unable to resist
the temptation of tracing it to its source.” There is truth
and force in this. But it is the sort of thing that had been
better said by somebody else.
Among other diversions, the author tells a capital story
about BRIGHT's famous citation of the cave of Adullam. A
French historian quoting it explained to his countrymen
that it was an “allusion à un passage de la bible. Adullam
avait woulu tuer David.” In a more familiar reference, Mr.
TREVELYAN is not so successful. Writing of Lord JoHN
MANNERs' couplet about “our old nobility,” he describes it as
“a Frankenstein that was to pursue its author through life.”
Alas, poor Frankenstein, ever condemned to be thus mis-
taken for his own petard after being hoist with it. Mr.
TrevelyAN's admirable work, invaluable to the student
of modern history, is illustrated by various cartoons
reproduced from Punch, who, amongst other services to
mankind, immortalized an eyeglass John BRIGHT never
a strange subject for the novel-form in The Kingdom
(HEINEMANN)—nothing less than the struggle for peace
and truth and perfect charity in the soul of a modern (and
something of a modernist) friar, Padre Bernardo. Those
who recognise this travail of a soul to be a legitimate and
vitally tragic theme will here welcome a treatment of it
which is marked by much sympathy and a quite exceptional
detachment. The devil's advocate has the fullest licence
notwithstanding that the author stands for the Catholic
point of view and for his saintly, sore-tried hero who finally
enters into his kingdom of self-conquest and peace. The
littlenesses, bigotries and misunderstandings of conventual
life are in particular suggested with a keen but not un-
charitable emphasis, and it would seem that so detailed an
impression could only be the work of one who had actually
passed through the routine and struggle of the life. The
secondary theme, the marriage of Orlando the singer,
Bernardo's friend, and Vittoria, his cousin, is well handled
so as to bring out the deep human sympathies of the friar.

MORE LEAVES FROM THE BEERBOHM TREE
OF KNOWLEDGE.
[In friendly imitation of Sir HERBERT TREE's recently-published
Thoughts and After-thoughts.]
EveRY true craftsman should take joy and pride in his
handiwork apart from the incident of wages. And here we
may learn a lesson even from “Our Betters.” There exist
men and women of the loftiest birth who are so enamoured
of stage-craft that they will actually pay large sums to be
allowed to play the part of walking gentleman and walking
lady. The words of the late Robert Louis STEveNsoN are
their cry: “Give us the guerdon of going on 1"
To get what they want is the peculiar faculty of the
English race. I once met an Englishman who had made
a successful tour through the Fatherland with the most
limited knowledge of the vernacular. He knew only one
word of German, and that was English. It was “Beer.”
Yet his needs were always satisfied.
When power passes from the hands of “Our Betters”
into those of the People—a risky translation, yet many such
have reached us from the original French—I shall look for
the reign of Universal Peace. I have an instinctive horror
of war. Apart from bloodshed—almost always a marked
concomitant of sanguinary disputes—war is the enemy of
Art, and distracts attention from the theatres.
I have in my time played the part of great and bloody
captains like Macbeth, but my heart was never in the work;
nor were my legs either. I would always sooner play
BEETHove N. BEETHoveN created; Macbeth destroyed.
Surely there is a difference here. -
The modern critic rails at the star-system. Yet it is one
of those eternal arrangements which have a heavenly origin.
You have only to look at the firmament on a fine night and
you will see stars. -
How often, as an actor-manager, have I envied mediocrity!
So gentle is the treatment it gets from the critics.
The actor is independent of recognised laws—the laws
that govern blank verse, for instance. He needs no educa-
tion and often gets none. He requires no tools or acces-
sories. The painter has his palette, the sculptor his chisel,
the poet his blotting-pad, the musician his loud pedal; but
the actor has just himself. ; :
AFTER-THoug HT.
I had forgotten that the actor from time to time makes use
of certain aids, such as grease and pigments and wigs and
costumes. Also of words, generally written by somebody else.
How stupid of me ! What would the greatest Hamlet be
without SHAKSPEARE 2
The latest hand-maiden of the drama is the gramophone.
It helps to correct the evanescence of the actor's triumphs,
permitting posterity to appreciate what might otherwise
appear incredible in the reports of the time. I myself have,
by request, done two gramophone records for the British
Museum—in the respective voices of Hamlet and Falstaff,
In a spasm of humour I once said that I was so nervous
that I spoke the speech of Hamlet in the voice of Falstaff,
and that of Falstaff in the voice of Hamlet. This statement
(fictional, of course, as humour so often is) was received
with scepticism by a critic who suggested that I had spoken
them both in the voice of BEERBoHM TREE. Even a
critic, it will be recognised, may be something of a humorist.
The absence of a “fourth wall” on the stage is no doubt
desirable for the sake of unbroken communication between
the actors and the audience; but it is destructive to that
complete illusion which is the end of all art, seeing that
very few actual rooms are constructed without this feature.
it at His Majesty's, and here I am happy, for once, in
enjoying the support of some of my most malevolent critics.
I have been accused, by a nameless writer, of overwhelm-
ing SHAKspeARE under an avalanche of irrelevant scenery.
My final answer to these criticisms is that my revivals have
paid. The ultimate test of all Art (and when I talk of Art
I exclude painting, sculpture, poetry, music, architecture,
&c., except as they are ancillary to the drama) is the
approval of the paying public.
In the setting of a play there must either be frank con-
vention or an attempt at complete illusion. If you cannot
reproduce the atmosphere of ancient Elsinore in the grave-
digger's scene, better have no scene at all.
Euston Road with its monumental masonry would be an
intolerable compromise.

BourchIER, or Cleopatra by me.
The effect of illusion can be produced by a combined
effort of imagination on the part of actor and audience.
Thus, if the actor imagines himself to be fat he appears fat.
It is true that when playing Falstaff I have used material
devices to produce the semblance of bulginess, but I could
have done it just as well out of my own imagination, only |
I did not want to put too much strain on that of my
collaborators in the pit.

future use, so far merge it, for the time, in that of his I
character that, after creating the illusion that he is a
corpse, it would be unthinkable that he should arise and
appear before the curtain to take the applause of the
groundlings. He would much rather that the audience
should go home under the impression that he is still dead.
And, after all, what is the applause of men to the true
artist 2 Dead to the world—for his illusory simulation of
death will have deceived everybody but himself—the pul-

Curved is the boko of Bond.

my type got up one morning with a
blank mind and said to himself, ‘What
human nature now needs is that thou-
sands of electric palaces should spring
up all over the world, in which ani-
mated photographic representations of
sentiment and melodrama may beguile
the tedium of life;’ and straightway he
invented the cinema. That is the best
kind of inventing. But, to give you
an example of the other kind, asbestos
grates were an accident pure and simple.
An inventor chanced to walk through
some catacombs and noticed a great
heap of skulls, and this instantly gave
him the idea of asbestos fuel. You
see the difference? The accidental in-
ventors may be useful enough, but
very little credit is due to them, whereas
the sociologically imaginative inventors
are conscious benefactors, and should
have pensions and statues.”
“And what are you at work on just

“I have,” I replied.
“And you have noticed,” he went on,
“that your host or hostess has always

acquit them of being so small-minded
as that; but one must consider the

“As to how it would affect the ser-

The point is that it might. But

suppose that some one could invent
a means by which billiards could be

“CELIA,” I said sternly, looking up
from my paper, “I have something to
say to you, child. Cease your trifling
for a moment; refrain for the nonce
from writing absurd messages on the
back of my collar, which can only be
read by others.”
“They'll tell you about it,” said
Celia, writing busily. “It's nothing
very private.”
“Really, I can't think why your
nurse allows you a pencil. Do you
know that this collar was quite clean
when I started wearing it, and that
there's nearly half the month to go?”
“I am rich,” said Celia. “I will buy
you a third collar.”
This gave me the opening I sought.
I put down the paper and turned
gravely to her.
“Don’t buy clothes for me, woman,”
I said bitterly; “buy them for your-
self. Heaven knows you need them.”
“I knew Heaven knew, but I didn't

I began to read:—
“‘There is an orgy of undressing
going on,’” I read, “‘and it shows
no signs of abating.” This refers to
women's clothes,” I explained—“‘an
orgy of undressing.’”
“Oh, the shame of it !” said Celia in
a shocked voice.
“‘Five years ago women still wore

stockings thick enough not to show the
colour of their skins, and sufficient—er

about the muscles of the legs, or rather

Any defence you care to make will be
given my most careful consideration.”
“Who is the Writer 2 ”
“It doesn't say. Just a woman.”
“Does she say what she wears when
she goes on to the top of a 'bus?”
“My dear Celia, you don't think
that anybody connected with The Times

“I only just wondered. Ronald, are

sarcastic—“because it's the fashion 1"
“Men are just as bad.”
“Oh, no, they're not. You don't
find men doing things just because
some absurd person in Paris tells them
to.” -
Celia looked at me thoughtfully.
“Supposing,” she said, “it was the
fashion to wear your tie all sideways,
do you mean to say you wouldn't do
it 2 '' -
“Of course not.”
“Then why are you doing it now 2 ”
Hastily and with as much dignity as
possible I straightened my tie.
“Talking about orgies of undressing,”
Celia went on, “the bottom button of
your waistcoat's undone.”
“It always is,” I said, smiling gently
at her ignorance.
“Oh, horror . "
“It's just a custom. One always—

I walked over to the glass and had
another go at straightening my tie.

“We are Liberals,” I said. “That

It leaves me cold. But, after all, I am
conscious of no gap in my intellectual
life. For I have found a splendid sub-
stitute.
I wish it to be understood that I
know nothing, literally nothing, about
the game of Base Ball. I have never
seen it, discussed it or heard it described.
My mind is entirely free from the
slightest vestige of information. And
thus the reading of accounts of Base
Ball matches becomes for me an exer-
cise of the purest romance.
before me vague compelling pictures,
opens up for me delightful avenues of
conjecture. And by now I am wholly
engrossed in this pursuit. I must
make it quite clear that I get my
reports only from the best and most
reputable of Transatlantic magazines,
where the question is soberly discussed
and the writing might almost be classed
as literature. But it stirs me all the
same. Who would not care to know
that “a teasing fly was sent perhaps
seventy feet back of the bag”? Per-
haps a certain element of slang does
creep in at times. At least I have
wondered if it is considered quite
elegant to speak of “the batter pushing
down a sacrifice bunt.” But I love to
try to imagine him doing it. Then it
is so refreshing to talk about “an
inning”—so unhackneyed. And there

not encouraged by a cheer. Behind

Front Opposition Bench. The House
had come to bury the Plural Voter,
not to praise him. With unconscious
dramatic instinct it assumed attitude
and expression suitable to melancholy
circumstance.
Though this was the underlying fact
there is no doubt that Mr. STANIER
contributed to prevalent depression.
At Question time he had not fewer
than six queries on the Paper dealing
with subject of swine fever. His inter-
rogations formed a series of chapters
succinctly chronicling condition of pigs
in Holland. They seem to have a
weary time in the Netherlands. It
will be remembered that in the educa-
tional schedule at Dotheboys Hall there
was regular recurrence of what was
known in the establishment as “Brim-
stone morning.” On such occasions
the boys, mustered in the school-
room, had administered to them in
due order large spoonfuls of brimstone
and treacle. ,
As Mrs. Squeers explained to Nicholas
Nickleby, “If they hadn't something or

observing in guttural Dutch, “I’m

never felt fitter in my life!” There,
ready at hand, is the equivalent of the
spoon and the bucket of brimstone and
treacle. He is straightway dosed.

On approach of division every seat was

(After reading about the curative power of colours.)
WHEN first I saw you, Thomas, and I noted
Your noisy headgear and your blatant tie,
The startling tints in which you went waistcoated,
Your socks' assaults upon the passing eye,
I murmured, “Here we have a nut indeed,
One of the good old Barcelona breed.”
I realised our suburb would be duller,
Its streets with paler radiance imbued,
Reft of your decorative scheme of colour,
But yet I've often wished the thing less crude,
Have often wished the dress that you put on
Less imitative of the Union John.
But now I know I may have been unfeeling
In thinking that you wished me to admire;
You may be only one whom need of healing
Has driven to medicinal attire.
You may feel my disgust, or even more,
When you assume “the mixture as before.”
If that be so, expressive of my sorrow
I dedicate these simple strains to you.
Say you forgive me, Thomas, and to-morrow
Drop me a line to tell me how you do,
With details, for I greatly wish to know

MY DEAR SIR,--I see that you are
interested in old churches, which em-
boldens me to invite your assistance
in connection with our St. Aloysius
Belfry Restoration and Completion
Fund. The total sum required is £750,
towards which we hawe collected up to
the present £62 14s. 744. and a gift in
kind of 1,000 bricks.
Although St. Aloysius cannot per-
haps accurately be described as “old”
in the sense of the term usually applied
to ecclesiastical erections, it was built
as far back as 1802. Moreover it is
credibly asserted that it stands on or
near the site of a Roman Temple
erected about the year 47 (I cannot for
the moment recall whether B.C. or A.D.).
Your love of birds prompts me to
add that three years ago a robin built
its nest in one of our organ pipes, and
in spite of grave inconvenience to the
organist we allowed it to remain for
several months.
In these circumstances may I confi-
dently solicit your help? Donations
should be sent to me and all cheques
should be crossed.
Yours very truly, P. PINKER.

[“Dulness has its penalties. Vivacity and courage have their certain victories."
I THANK thee, Times, for thy consoling phrase,
Though formerly men praised the grace Batavian;
But that was in the mid-Victorian days
Ere WALKLEY coined the epithet of “Shavian";
Ere we had learned to crown with lavish bays
Outlandish dancers, Spanish and Moldavian;
Ere NIEtzsche hurled into the black abysm
The crude insensate creed of Altruism.
How far it seems, that quaint, old-fashioned age
When people filled their albums with “confessions,”
And duly noted on a pinkish page
Their prejudices and their prepossessions;
With prudish zeal or puritanic rage
Rebuking genius for the least transgressions,
And always choosing BAYARD as their hero
Instead of CASANOVA or of NERo
So was it also with their heroines, who
Were stuffy when they were not suicidal,
Like Mrs. FRY, or that insipid crew
Who congregated round the sage of Rydal,
Or JoAN of ARC–poor things, they never knew
Us whose vivacity will brook no bridle,
Who give our Sundays up to bridge or snooker
And see no filthiness in any lucre.
I've never taken as my moral guide

GRACE DARLING, who, a lighthouse-keeper's daughter,
Aroused one night by shipwrecked sailors' cries,
Rowed out to save them o'er the stormy water;
The deed no doubt was brave, but was it wise
Judged by the one true test—the cash it brought her?
Besides, her social status was obscure;
There was no pathos in her dying poor.
The EMPREss DowAGER of CHINA–there
You had a woman lacking erudition,
Of dubious antecedents, but of rare
Attractions and implacable ambition,
Who let no scruples alter or impair
Her steadfast will; who never knew contrition;
While as for enemies or even bores
She lopped their heads off constantly in scores.
I hold that life lacks all refreshing fruit
When need of pelf produces melancholy,
But yields a prospect of unbounded loot
If only you are resolute and jolly.
In short, the impecunious, if astute,
May make an honest living out of folly.

Give flavour to the Cup of Life—like borage.

THE NEW MILITANCY.
Adolph Us had entered the smoke-
room with an intense look on his face.
I instantly retreated behind The
Daily Telegraph—which affords better
cover than any newspaper in England
—but he had sighted me.
“Just the very man I wanted to see,”
he exclaimed. “I particularly need
your advice.” And he sat down very
close beside me.
I never knew Adolphus when he did
not particularly need my advice. He
goes about the world collecting advice
and ignoring it. I have often thought
of advising him to ask my advice.
“You see I have always regarded
you as a level-headed man of the
world,” he began.
I looked as level-headed and worldly
as possible and said, “What is it, old
man?”
“It hasn't been formally announced
yet, but I'm engaged.”
“Ah! And you want to know how
to get out of it 2."
From his face I knew that I was
near the mark, but he protested.
“Certainly not,” he said. “It's
this way. I didn't know that she was
a strong politician. Of course she talks
intelligently about affairs—says that
LLoyd GEORGE ought to be banished to
Bogotá, and so forth—but she gave
me no reason to suppose that she held
exceptional opinions on politics. Well,
I took her in my car to-day to see an
old aunt of mine. When I brought the
car home again I found that she
had left her bag in it. It was merely
clasped, not locked, and it felt rather
heavy. I wondered if she had left her
purse in it. If so, I had better take it
back at once. If not, it could wait till
I saw her to-morrow. Well, I opened
it.”
“Letters from a rival?” I interposed.
“No, no. I am far too strong an
attraction. What I found was a ham-
mer and half-a-dozen pebbles.”
“My poor friend!” I said, and patted
him soothingly on the back.
“Now what am I to do?” asked the
unhappy Adolphus.
“There are various courses of action
before you,” I replied. “You can break
off the engagement at once. You can
say that as she proposes to go to
prison, she ipso facto proposes to desert
you. You can say that, if she burned
down the House of Commons or West-
minster Abbey after you were married,
your estate would be held responsible
for the damage. Another injustice to
man.”
“But I don't want to break it off,'
said Adolphus.
Husband and wife should
be as one. Go into the movement;
become an active militant. You're
quite a stone too heavy and a hunger-
strike would do you a world of good.
Besides, you used to have a fine throw-
in from the out-field. You're just the
man for the Strangers' Gallery.”
Adolphus shook his head. “It’s not
that I'm absolutely opposed to the
movement, but, frankly, I never cared
much for the idea of prison.”
“Coward. You want to save your
miserable skin. Why, when you're
married you may be glad of solitary
confinement. However, if you refuse
either to break it off or to become a
militant, my advice is to temporise.
Say nothing. Let sleeping dogs lie. Of
course in this case it's a woman, and
awake, but the principle's the same.”
“Thanks very much,” replied Adol-
phus. “I shall consider your advice
very carefully. I shall do nothing
hurriedly. Rely on me.”
The next evening he burst jubilantly
into the club library.
“Congratulate me,” he cried. “It's
all right. Have a drink!”
“Then she's made you join the
Men's League for Women's Suffrage,”
I said. “Well, you'll stand a hunger-
strike better than you would a drink-
strike.”
“I’ve not joined. She's all right.
There isn't a nicer girl in England. I
put it to her straight, and what do you
think she is 2 ”
I hate riddles about women, and
said so.
“She's just a militant anti-militant,”
cried the triumphant Adolphus. “She
just has a shy at any militants' windows
whenever she passes them.”
“And I dared to suggest that you
should break off your engagement to
this noble girl!” I exclaimed. “Adol-
phus, I ask your pardon, and will my-
self defray the charges of the refresh-
ment which you proposed. . . . My
toast, old man! “The future Mrs. Adol-
phus, and more power to her elbow !’”
with her.
“John Harris, of Trelill, St. Kew, was on
his way to Delabole slate quarries yesterday,
and on reaching the lower part of Pengelly,
collided with another workman (Mr. J. A.
Parsons). Harris was thrown into Mr. Dawe's
window, receiving several cuts.”

It is terrible to be left in a state of
CHAMELEON HENS.
EUGENIC theories are apparently
making headway in the poultry world.
The Daily Mirror of July 17 has it
that Mr. CHARLEs WorTHINGTON, of
Denver, Colorado, U.S.A., has doubled
the egg yield from his fowls by sur-
rounding them with gaudy colours.
He painted their town red and always
wore a red robe and mask while feeding
the hens. Some further experiments
by Mr. T. Thorne Baker, The Daily
Mirror scientific expert, with hens in a
scarlet environment, have resulted in
eggs with a distinct orange tint
Mr. Punch's own Oologist is not
going to take this challenge lying
down, or even sitting. He can pro-
duce an Orpington from the Bouverie
Street roof-chicken-run that is a perfect
chameleon at the game. During the
last visitation of a pea-soup fog her
eggs so harmonised in hue with their
surroundings as to be completely in-
visible when laid, and so could not be
found at all. He has a still more
sympathetic and intelligent bird in a
coop next the north-east chimney-pot.
This remarkable fowl, a black-and-tan
Congolese, has developed her chro-
matic sense to such a degree that she
promptly responds with the comple-
mentary tone to that presented to her
gaze for the time being.
On being shown, for example, the
office-boy's orange tie the other day,
she triumphantly weighed in on the
spur of the moment with a product of
royal purple.
We have, besides, a speckled Wyan-
dotte that has lately taken up Post-
Impressionism. Her speciality is cub-
oids and icosahedrons with pea-green
and vermilion cross-hatchings.
But we do not think it fair to press
these devoted creatures too far, or to
try practical jokes upon them, such as
a repetition of the classic instance of
the Scotch plaid and the too-imitative
chameleon. No Highlander, therefore,
in his native garb can be allowed to
inspect our elevated fowl-run. Nuts,
also, are requested to subdue their taste
in socks when on a visit.
The hen, however, who is most loyal
and most thoroughly imbued with the
genius loci is an adventurous bird who
fluttered down the other day into Mr.
Punch's own sanctum, and, after paying
her respects to a certain venerable
and venerated model figure, has ever
after laid eggs with a marked dorsal
protuberance. Zig-ZAG.

First Caddie (pointing with his thumb to another caddie further up the table, who is eating with his knife in his mouth). “Look AT
old BILL, GoING RAHND THE WHOLE course wiv 'Is IRON.”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Hunt the Slipper (STANLEY PAUL), by Mr. OLIVER MADox
HUEFFER, is the sort of book that must give pleasure all
round, and it is obvious from the swing of it that it was
something of a joy-ride to the author. Far be it from me
to attempt a précis of the plot, for never was an egg so full
of meat. To begin with, a splendid old Englishman, retired
general and active member of Quarter Sessions, sets out
to the States in search of a grand-daughter. To end
with, there are in New York the happiest possible termina-
tions of the many complexities, mostly matrimonial, that
ensue. One particular charm the tale has, that its characters
in turn tell their part in the first person and very naïvely
reveal themselves in the process. The J.P. starts it in
a spirit of almost pathetic restraint; a swindler and a
daughter of pleasure carry it on in a vein of tragic realism;
others give it a help along, and the irresponsible boy of the
piece ends it with a burst of laughter. What matter if that
ending be a shade too happy to be consistent with the
tragedy of the middle? As one of the narrators observes,
there is enough trouble in the world without harping on it;
and the chosen text of the book is, after all, true: “Il y a
des honnétes gens partout,” including, I feel at this moment
of completion, Mr. OLIVER MADox HUEFFER, myself, and,
no doubt, the reader.
The nicest thing about being a sporting novelist is that
you can jump a stone wall of improbability without chang-
testator had already done all he could to complicate the
course of fiction, you reckoned without Mrs. CoNYERs and
Sandy Married (METHUEN). By the will of an uncle,
Hildebrand Hannyside and Araminta Mellicombe were
obliged either to keep up a racing stable until they won the
Grand National, or to maintain their devout scruples,
Evangelical and High Church respectively, in comparative
poverty. By the same will Sandy himself was compelled
to supervise the Northlap stud until the blue ribbon of the
'chasing world (I hope I have that right) adorned it.
Northlap, it appears, is in England, but a water-jump like
the Irish Channel is nothing to Mrs. CoNYERs, so we swiftly
find that Sandy and his delightful wife have coaxed the
trainer to move their stable to Ireland, whither Hildebrand
and Araminta, bickering and suspicious, pursue them.
Once amongst the bogs and heather, Mrs. CoNYERs of
course is at home, and the atmosphere she creates would
rouse hunting-songs in the heart of a fruitarian. Even
Hildebrand and Araminta, infected by the general enthusi-
asm, buy themselves mounts, are badly and amusingly
cheated, ride to hounds, and attend the most extravagant
of race-meetings; and the rest of the characters live
entirely on, with or by horses, and sometimes all three at
once. How it all ended, how the great victory at Aintree
was won, and what happened to Hildebrand and Araminta,
you must find out for yourself. The book goes with a
gallop, and, if you think that the farcical fun poked at the
two unfortunate bigots is somewhat out of keeping with
the real comedy of Irish life which the authoress presents
both with freshness and enthusiasin, well, you shouldn't !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I have just returned from a delightful week-end. The
house, called Redmarley, is a charming old place, situate,
as the auctioneers say, in one of the most picturesque neigh-
bourhoods in the Cotswolds; so there was plenty of good
scenery. But my friends with whom I was staying would
make any spot happy. Ffolliot is the name of them, and
they are the jolliest, most companionable folk in the world.
Perhaps Mr. Ffolliot (who has nerves, reads WALTER PATER
and doesn't appreciate noise) might be a little bit in the
way; but, as he hardly ever leaves his study, that need
worry nobody. Mrs. Ifolliot is an angel—so pretty and
unselfish and sympathetic that it is no wonder that her
crew of delightful children simply adore her. I wish I had
time to tell you more about the children. Two of them are
practically grown up; indeed Mary astonished us all, at the
end of my visit, by becoming engaged to a nice soldier (just
when I myself was almost sure she would marry the young
Radical M.P. who so admired her—but it was better as
things happened). The others will miss her awfully when
she goes to India. Still, the house can hardly be dull, as
there are two delightful - -
infants growing up ; and
meanwhile there are the
Rugby twins, U2 and Buz,
to º things lively. We
had great fun one evening
when Buz dressed up as a
Suffragette and interviewed,
| young Mr. Gallup about
votes for women—and I
must say the latter took the
joke very well. But then
| everybody in or near Red-
marley is like that. Would
you care to meet them all
for yourself? Then buy

all so lacking in fibre that they had better have been
women.) Further, to condemn the whole British aristoc-
racy as “ill-bred,” and to applaud “the beautiful women
who by night walk up and down Piccadilly" as noble, if
guilty of some “childish naughtiness,” is too much. These
and its many other sweeping but half-baked ideas will not
commend the book, except perhaps to the Militants; and the
more shrewd even of them will not thank Mrs. HARRod for
this unconscious exposition of the absurdity and looseness
of which the feminine mind is sometimes capable when it
starts generalising.
I recommend Mr. CHRistoph E.R Stone's Letters to an
Eton Boy (Fisher UNwiN) to all true lovers of Eton. It
is one thing to write familiarly about the Wall Game,
St. Andrew's Day, Pop, Agar's Plough, Upper Club, Trials,
the Winchester Match, Lord's, Rowland's and all the rest
of it, and quite another to invest them, as he does, with the
right atmosphere. The boy who gets the letters is in his
last year. His chief correspondents are his worldly but

- rather uncle-ish uncle,

and so will others who can tolerate the sudden inter-

study of a young girl's soul, pure, passionate but immature;
| her encounters with every sort of man, and her occasional
metamorphosis into an eerie white hound. I do not com-
plain bitterly of the frontispiece, a portrait of Mrs. HARRod
at the age of eleven, nor of the quotation on the fly-leaf:
“Read it . . . It is so beautiful!” nor yet of the dedication,
“To my beloved son, Roy HARRod, Scholar" (as were so
many of us and mostly to our private shame). These
things and a certain affectation of style, imitative of the
Meredithian manner, may be forgiven in a work ingenious,
at any rate, if not clever. The trouble lies in its wholesale
and almost malicious attacks on humanity in general and the
masculine part of it in particular. As a sex we are learning
to bear with fortitude our detractors' trick of citing the
bully, the seducer and the common cheat as typical of us;
what we cannot stomach is the effeminate creature held up
out of place in a school story,
or, as perhaps I ought to say, rather unusual. For, as Mr.
Stone treats them, they are perfectly innocent and natural,
and they helped to produce some of Lettice's letters, which
are a delightful revelation of modern girlhood. Mr. Stone
has in fact woven into his book of school-life a pleasant
little picture of a healthy romantic attachment, without any
of the stale old nonsense of headmasters' daughters and the
like which makes one wonder if the writers have ever seen
the inside of a public school.

Bring up your billows, mile on mile,
Gathering speed from either pole
To pound on our deciduous isle !
Roll on, I say, but roll in vain
Never our soil shall feed your maw again.
Some years ago upon the strand
A British Monarch took his seat
And tried to make you understand
That you were not to wet his feet;
In safety, well behind the throne,
His Court encouraged this defiant tone.
You took no notice. On you came
(As he had been a barking pup)
Straight for his toes to swamp the same,
Till he removed them higher up, -
And to his courtiers cried, “What ho!
I said it was no use; I told you so.”
To-day a louder challenge rings
About our country's fretted base;
A nobler KNUT superbly flings
His glove in your erosive face;
Asquith himself arrives to bar - - -
Your moist advances, saying, “Sea, thus far !”
So shall “IBritannia rules the waves”
Mean that you mustn't undermine
Cliffs and marine hotels and caves
And things that overlook the brine;
So shall our empire o'er the foam
. . Begin where Charity begins—at home.
For lo! our KNUT shall break your ranks
With mole and groyne and granite wall,
And to the strange anaemic cranks
Who like to have their England small
This stout remark shall he address:
“She may be little, but she shan't be less.”

THE PERFECT cricketer.
XVIII.--THE CARE of THE Roller.
(Somewhat in the self-effacing manner of J. B. Hobbs.)
THE best of cricket is that, if you get to the top of the
tree, newspapers will pay you to write about the game and
other cricketers, even if you can't write. Of course, being
at the top of the tree is itself pretty good fun, especially to
a Surrey man, because at the Oval you can always count
on a friendly crowd, even if they do drop their aitches
a bit. And it's true that we give them the opportunity,
HAyward and me, to say nothing of HAYEs and Hitch.
Hero-worship never did anyone any harm, except perhaps
l
Now and then one gets a set-back, of course, and cricket's
a game where you expect it. In fact, it's no use playing
cricket at all unless you're ready for bad luck as well as
good. The best of us have our spells of bad luck—when
the ball's never bigger than a pea and the wicket's as
wide as a church door. Even W.G. (who has just had a
birthday, and I gladly hold out my hand to him to wish
him many happy returns, and I wish he was young enough
to be among us once more)—even W.G. could fail three or
four times consecutively even in his zenith. Personally I
have been somewhat out of luck during a week or two of
this season; however, I must admit that I was somewhat
surprised before the Gentlemen and Players' match started
at the Oval when I heard one man ask another, “What do
they play 'OBBs for 2 A bit out of form, ain't 'e?” “Just
a bit,” replied the other, “but they do say as 'ow 'e's
played for 'is fieldin’.” This seemed to me incredible talk,
and I was therefore not knocked all of a heap when I
found out afterwards that the two were genuine admirers
of mine, and had been put up to saying what they did by
one of my rivals.
What the public don't always understand is that a
cricketer is usually doing his best, or, at any rate, if he is
not doing his best he is doing something else which fully
occupies his mind. Once or twice lately even I have let a
ball get past me at cover; not in the least because I was
fielding badly, but because I was slightly absent-minded
through thinking of something else—an article for a paper,
perhaps, or a new way of playing a stroke. Yet some
foolish fellow in the crowd has groaned. Still the medal
has its other side, for only last week I had a letter for-
warded on to me at Lord's, and the writer asked me if I
would sell him the bat with which I had been making so
many runs. I didn't know whether to reply or not, because
it looked to me as if it might be a piece of sarcasm, and
one does not like to be “had "; but even if it is not I
can assure him that I never part with a good bat—indeed,
when I have done with a really serviceable weapon it is not
of much use to anybody. . .
Next week I shall go into the difficult question of the
best kind of rope to put round the pitch to protect it during
the tea interval. , - * .

DEAREST DAPHNE,-An outstanding
feature of the season just ending has
certainly been the evolution of the
bazaar. A few weeks ago somebody
had the bright idea of selling badges to
protect people from being bothered by
| sellers, but already that's vieux jeu.
At the Who's Who Fair (a prodigious
success, my dear, which brought in an
enormous sum for a most deserving
charity—I forget what) we charged five
shillings admission, and we sold little
ducky silk flags, with “I don't want to
buy anything" on them, at a guinea
each. We didn't trouble to stock any
of the stalls. Fact is, we've faced the
truth that ces autres only come to
bazaars to look at us. The sensational
feature was that we stall-holders wore
| as head-dresses our own family crests.
: Wasn't that a lovely idea of your
Blanche's ' And the loveliest part of
it was to see the crests of people who
haven't any My sweet thing, it was
| absolutely . The Bullyon-Boundermere
find her some sort of animal, and she
had it on her head carried out in black
velvet and gold. “Whatever is it
meant for?" I asked Norty in con-
fidence. “I should think it's a bounder
rampant," he said.
The outlying tribes came pouring
down from the heights of North and
South London and simply swarmed
into the Fair. They all bought the
little “Don't-want-to-buy-anything”
flags, and then they moved upon the
stall-holders en masse. For another
guinea any stall-holder was ready to
explain her crest and give a few par-
ticulars of herself. For two guineas a
five-minutes' chat might be bought, in
which we might please ourselves as to
whether we answered questions truth-
fully or not; but for five guineas we
pledged ourselves to stick to facts. It
was gorgeous! I heard someone who'd
duly planked down the guineas asking
Mrs. Golding-Newman (the newest of
the new people—she got there by the
flukiest of flukes 1) who she was and
what her crest meant. “I’m Mrs.
Golding-Newman,” she replied with a
good bit of pomp and circumstance;

ant de mager.” Wasn't that dilly?
Whatever the woman supposed she was
saying, it was utterly descriptive of her
efforts to be in the swim. Popsy, Lady
Ramsgate, was in great form and very
chirpy, till her head-dress, the Ramsgate
crest, two arms counter-embowed, the
dexter hand holding a knife and the
sinister a fork (the founder of their
family, you know, was Grand Carver to
HENRY VIII.), caught in the decora-
tions and got pulled off; and, oh! my
dearest and best, more than the head-
dress came off—and Popsy is doing a
rest cure! Before that catastrophe
happened she'd been telling questioners,
in return for their guineas, that she
was thirty-five, that she'd married the
late Lord R. when she was thirteen,
that she had an average of twenty
offers a week, but didn't mean to marry
again, that she loved dancing, and that
her favourite dance just now was the
Leapfrog Valse.

fought social race between her and

to her gamely. When the Golding-
Newman woman had Trillini to sing at
one of her parties, the B.-B. hit back
by getting Twirlinski to do his exquy
dance, “The p.m. of a Satyr,” at her
next affair. It was a regular ding-dong
race, and no one could spot the winner,
till Mrs. B.-B. came a most tremendous
cropper. Il en était aimsi. She gave
a big party, old Lady Needmore, as
usual, inviting the people and receiving
them, with the B.-B. in the offing.
The latter, not having much to do and
being obsessed with the notion of un-
invited guests (and really, my dear,
they've put in some strong work this
season!), kept a sharp look-out for these.
At last she felt sure she’d spotted one.

[“Atto-day's meeting of the British Medical
Association at Brighton, Dr. Kennedy, of Bath,
said he once placed a child one year old in the
sea, and it struck out and swam.”]
MASTER Bunting, who, it will be re-
membered, has just attained his first
birthday, this morning began his
attempt to swim the Channel. He
arrived early on the pier in his mail-
cart, and remained in rather over-
animated conversation with his parents
for some minutes. An enquiry by our
representative as to the prospects of
the attempt elicited from the dis-
tinguished swimmer a hearty goo-goo.
Master Bunting entered the sea at
9.1 A.M. He seemed somewhat dis-,
tressed on first contact with the water,

ting evening clothes,
leaning by the door of
the music - room, is

you are, M'ria!” said
her better half. So she
sailed up to the man:
“I am the lady of the
house; may I ask your
name?” “My name's
Snaggers,” answered
the man. “Just what
I should think it would
be / " said Mrs. B.-B.,
with cutting sarcasm.
“No person of that
name was invited, Mr.
Snaggers, so perhaps
you'll withdraw before –
I send for the police!” The man
shrugged his shoulders, laughed and
went away. At the end of the
evening Mrs. B.-B. said reproachfully
to Lady Needmore, “What a pity the
guest I most wanted to see didn't come!
I mean the big-game hunting earl
who's had such thrilling adventures.
I saw his name in your list—Lord St.
Aldegonde.” “Oh, Snaggers,” old
Needmore corrected. “But, my dear
woman, he did come ! I saw him. He
came rather late, after we'd left off
receiving 'em, and went away quite
soon, I believe. Here, somebody! Get
some brandy or something! Mrs.
Boundermere's fainting.” It was a
hard blow for her, as St. Aldegonde's
been quite a celebrity since his return
from his last big-game expedition,
owing to his having shot an enormous
creature called a mommaroo, that
everybody thought was extinct. But
I believe what she felt most cruelly
was that she didn't know St. Aldegonde

no use trying to do good in this wicked
world !
One of the new departures this
season has been that several popular
people have turned themselves into
companies. The first to do it was
Bobby Brillmore, who makes things
go so splendidly at dinners and dances
and country houses. And so, as old
Lord Brokeystone's allowance to his
younger sons is immensely tiny, and as
Bobby found life a harder problem than
even the hardest thinker does, while at
the same time he was simply snowed
under with invitations, he thought he'd
turn his popularity to account. And
now he's a company with offices in the
City and a trade motto that he cribbed
from Soap or Cocoa or something—
“Have him in your Houses"—and
anyone who wants him must take
shares. (Norty says the shares are
already quoted on 'Changel) Quite an
idea, isn't it? Perhaps I may follow
suit and become, Ever thine,
— and kicked a good deal,
but afterwards settled
down to a strong over-
arm stroke, which took
him through the sea at
a good rate.
Master Bunting was
accompanied by a tur-
|bine pram - boat con-
|taining his nurse (who
was seen to be reading
| Home Gloats as the
small vessel cast off), a
police officer (whose
duty it will be to con-
verse with Master Bun-
|ting's attendant), a
golliwog, a crib, a
gallon of milk, and
|several tins of Kidling's
| Food.
At 10 Master Bun-
ting partook of a half-
bottle of milk. His stroke then
became stronger. At eleven o'clock,
to afford him a slight diversion, a rattle
was lowered into the water, and the
intrepid swimmer amused himself with
this for a few minutes before resuming
his powerful stroke.
Later. 12.15.-Master Bunting is
still going strong. A few minutes ago
he howled for a spoonful of Kidling's
Food. The nurse, assisted by the
police officer, administered the refresh-
ment, and Master Bunting then pro-
ceeded.
At two o'clock the golliwog entered
the sea and accompanied Master
Bunting in his progress over the next
half-mile.
Latest news : Calais, 5.13 A.M.–
Master Bunting arrived here at 5.10
this morning. He was met by members
of the Oui-Oui Swimming Club. He

mersion and, after dictating a short

A somewhat similar experience befell
Madame PAvLova last Friday. While
she was flying in a biplane over
St. Albans, the famous damseuse
noticed an elderly man dancing a horn-
pipe in a backyard with extraordinary
vigour and élan. Peremptorily ordering
her pilot to descend, she persuaded the
dancer, a retired petty officer named
Gregory Hitch, to return with her in
the biplane to Hampstead. After two
lessons he was offered, and has accepted,
an engagement to appear in a nautical
ballet as a one-legged admiral with the
Russian company which is shortly pro-

which caused any difficulty was that
which imposed a change of name, but

a time, the other came again and stuck
to her gamely. When the Golding-
Newman woman had Trillini to sing at
one of her parties, the B.-B. hit back
by getting Twirlinski to do his eacquy
dance, “The p.m. of a Satyr,” at her
next affair. It was a regular ding-dong
race, and no one could spot the winner,
till Mrs. B.-B. came a most tremendous
cropper. Il en était aimsi. She gave
a big party, old Lady Needmore, as
usual, inviting the people and receiving
them, with the B-B. in the offing.
The latter, not having much to do and
being obsessed with the notion of un-
invited guests (and really, my dear,
they've put in some strong work this
season!), kept a sharp look-out for these.
At last she felt sure she'd spotted one.
“I’m certain,” she remarked to Mr.
I'm simply furious, chérie, with these
Balkan people for going on fighting.
At that little dinner I gave for the
Delegates when they were over here,
I'd such a lovely talk with them and
was sure I'd made a great impression.
“You simply must come to an agree-
ment,” I said to them. “Why shouldn't
you? What does it matter who the
places belong to? It's absurdl War
is all very well at first; it makes a little
change, and often gives us a new colour
or a fashion; but it ought to stop quite,
quite soon, or it becomes a bore; and you
may take it as a cert that the Great
Powers won't stand being bored l’”
And they were such darlings, and
seemed so pleased, and laughed so
much with me and with each other,
that I thought peace was assured. It's
THE WATER IBABY.
[“Atto-day's meeting of the British Medical
Association at Brighton, Dr. Kennedy, of Bath,
said he once placed a child one year old in the
sea, and it struck out and swam.”]
MASTER Bunting, who, it will be re-
membered, has just attained his first
birthday, this morning began his
attempt to swim the Channel. He
arrived early on the pier in his mail-
cart, and remained in rather over-
animated conversation with his parents
for some minutes. An enquiry by our
representative as to the prospects of
the attempt elicited from the dis-
tinguished swimmer a hearty goo-goo.
Master Bunting entered the sea at
9.1 A.M. He seemed somewhat dis-,
tressed on first contact with the water,
B.-B., “that common-
looking man in ill-fit-
ting evening clothes,
leaning by the door of
the music - room, is
one of those uninvited
creatures' I'll go and
speak to him.” “Right
you are, M'ria!” said
her better half. So she
sailed up to the man:
“I am the lady of the
house; may I ask your
name?” “My name's
Snaggers,” answered
the man. “Just what
I should think it would
be / " said Mrs. B.-B.,
with cutting sarcasm.
“No person of that
name was invited, Mr.
Snaggers, so perhaps

and kicked a good deal,
but afterwards settled
down to a strong over-
arm stroke, which took
him through the sea at
a good rate.
Master Bunting was
accompanied by a tur-
|bine pram - boat con-
|taining his nurse (who
was seen to be reading
| Home Gloats as the
|small vessel cast off), a
police officer (whose
duty it will be to con-
verse with Master Bun-
|ting's attendant), a
golliwog, a crib, a
gallon of milk, and
|several tins of Kidling's
| Food.
At 10 Master Bun-
you'll withdraw before
I send for the police!” The man
shrugged his shoulders, laughed and
went away. At the end of the
evening Mrs. B.-B. said reproachfully
to Lady Needmore, “What a pity the
guest I most wanted to see didn't come!
I mean the big-game hunting earl
who's had such thrilling adventures.
I saw his name in your list—Lord St.
Aldegonde.” “Oh, . Snaggers,” old
Needmore corrected. “But, my dear
woman, he did come! I saw him. He
came rather late, after we'd left off
receiving 'em, and went away quite
soon, I believe. Here, somebody! Get
some brandy or something! Mrs.
Boundermere's fainting.” It was a
hard blow for her, as St. Aldegonde's
been quite a celebrity since his return
from his last big-game expedition,
owing to his having shot an enormous
creature called a mommaroo, that
everybody thought was extinct. But
I believe what she felt most cruelly
was that she didn't know St. Aldegonde
no use trying to do good in this wicked
world !
One of the new departures this
season has been that several popular
people have turned themselves into
companies. The first to do it was
Bobby Brillmore, who makes things
go so splendidly at dinners and dances
and country houses. And so, as old
Lord Brokeystone's allowance to his
younger sons is immensely tiny, and as
Bobby found life a harder problem than
even the hardest thinker does, while at
the same time he was simply snowed
under with invitations, he thought he'd
turn his popularity to account. And
now he's a company with offices in the
City and a trade motto that he cribbed
from Soap or Cocoa or something—
“Have him in your Houses"—and
anyone who wants him must take
shares. (Norty says the shares are
already quoted on 'Changel) Quite an
idea, isn't it? Perhaps I may follow
suit and become, Ever thine,
ting partook of a half-
bottle of milk. His stroke then
became stronger. At eleven o'clock,
to afford him a slight diversion, a rattle
was lowered into the water, and the
intrepid swimmer amused himself with
this for a few minutes before resuming
his powerful stroke.
Later. 12.15.—Master Bunting is
still going strong. A few minutes ago
he howled for a spoonful of Kidling's
Food. The nurse, assisted by the
police officer, administered the refresh-
ment, and Master Bunting then pro-
ceeded.
At two o'clock the golliwog entered
the sea and accompanied Master
Bunting in his progress over the next
half-mile.
Latest news : Calais, 5.13 A.M.–
Master Bunting arrived here at 5.10
this morning. He was met by members
of the Oui-Oui Swimming Club. He
appeared little the worse for his im-
mersion and, after dictating a short
account of his early life to our repre-

THE SEARCH FoR olyMP1c TALENT.
THE squiBE INSISTs UPON HIS CLAY BIRDS BEING THRow N BY HAND IN THE HOPE OF DIscoverING A BoBN DIscus-THRow ER.
THE TREASURE-SEEKERs.
According to the New York Corre-
spondent of The Daily Telegraph, Mr.
OsCAR HAMMERSTEIN's talent for find-
| ing hidden musical treasure was recently
illustrated by the discovery of a useful
tenor in a rotund middle-aged plasterer
engaged on the building of the new
Opera House. LUIGI GASPARINI, for
| that was his name, was dragged forth
from a pile of bricks to the fire-engine
station close by, where his trial per-
formances led to a provisional engage-
ment for the chorus.
- Such episodes are interesting, but
they are of quite common occurrence on
both sides of the Atlantic. “Never the
lotus closes, never the wild fowl wake,”
but genius discovers itself to the eye
that is looking for it. Only last week
Signor Polacco, the famous conductor,
was passing by a cab shelter in the
neighbourhood of Covent Garden when
| he heard the strains of the Abendstern
from Tannhäuser issuing from the
| interior. Darting swiftly into the
shelter Signor Polacco discovered that
they came from the larynx of an elderly
i attendant named Annibale Sparagrasso,
| employed to peel potatoes for the cab-
men's midday meal. Sparagrasso was at
once haled off to Covent Garden, and in
years as understudy for the chorus in
a travelling company which is about
to start for a prolonged tour in Pata-
gonia, the Falkland Isles and possibly
Alaska.
A somewhat similar experience befell
Madame PAvLova last Friday. While
she was flying in a biplane over
St. Albans, the famous danseuse
noticed an elderly man dancing a horn-
pipe in a backyard with extraordinary
vigour and élan. Peremptorily ordering
her pilot to descend, she persuaded the
dancer, a retired petty officer named
Gregory Hitch, to return with her in
the biplane to Hampstead. After two
lessons he was offered, and has accepted,
an engagement to appear in a nautical
ballet as a one-legged admiral with the
Russian company which is shortly pro-
ceeding to Siberia. The only condition
which caused any difficulty was that
which imposed a change of name, but
his consent was speedily secured for the
adoption of the ingenious and euphoni-
ous alias of Gregor Hitchikoff.
Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM TREE, while
spending a recent week-end in the New
Forest, was in the happy position of
being able to combine recreation with
benevolence. He was lunching at
| Lyndhurst, when, from his private
banqueting-room, he heard a venerable
passages from Hamlet with extra-
ordinary fervour and charm. As the
result of a brief but affecting inter-
view, Jubb consented to accompany
Sir HERBERT in his motor to town and
has since been given the rôle of hero
in a new drama, Bacon's Boyhood, by
Sir Edwin DURNING-LAwRENCE, Bart.,
which will be produced at a matinée at
His Majesty's Theatre with Sir HERBERT
BEERBöHM TREE as Queen Elizabeth,
and the author as Philip of Spain.
No wonder that Jubb's grandchildren
are now saying that he is a made man.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S SEASIDE PAGE.
WHERE TO GO.
It has been well said by SHAKSPEARE
or one of our poets that we are an island
race. At this time of the year, when so
many of us are leaving the towns for
the purer ozone of the country, the
words come home to us with an added
significance. We are an island race;
and for that reason the thoughts of
every Englishman worthy the name
will turn first to the sea.
But what seaside resort shall he
choose for his holiday? That is the
difficulty. Fortunately the enterprise
of the Town Council of Congerville in
advertising in our columns enables us to
refer without prejudice to the charms
of this growing watering-place, and
thus perhaps to solve the doubt in the
minds of our readers. Congerville—or
“The Venice of the North,” as it has
been aptly called by the Mayor, owing
no doubt to the fact that both towns
are on the sea—is, to our thinking, the
ideal spot for a holiday. Within such
easy distance of London that the visitor
who does not like the place can go back
again on the same aſternoon (in the
opinion of many people its chiefest
charm), Congerville will be found to offer
unique attractions to the wearied town-
dweller; and we are convinced that its
charms need only to be sufficiently
advertised to become known to all.

How To BATHE.
I. On no account bathe immediately
after a heavy meal. By a heavy meal is
meant one weighing five pounds or so.
II. At most seaside resorts University
costume is insisted on. Fortunately it
is not necessary to have taken a degree
in order to wear this.
III. It is bad form while waiting for
your turn outside an occupied bathing
machine to make sarcastic remarks to
the gentleman dressing inside. How-
ever long he has been, such observa-
tions as “Mend your braces afterwards,
ducky,” are not in the best possible taste.
IV. Although in many places you will
find notices strictly forbidding you to
remove the foreshore, no objection will
be raised if you should chance to take
time swimming with the mouth open is
a habit to be condemned, particularly
off those coasts where small jelly-fish
(or Sea Tapioca) congregate.
W. Even if you cannot swim, you
can safely venture into deep water
with a pair of Phutman's well-known
“Eykanseeyou’s.” Swimming can, of
course, be taught quite easily on land,
but the positions which it is necessary
to assume are ungraceful, and if
practised in the dining-hall of your
hotel will probably cause comment.
It is better to learn properly in the sea
with the help of Phutman's popular
invention. -

If you are an inexpert swimmer wear

is notorious that crabs resent tickling,
and in a moment the crustacean will
fasten his pincers on your finger. The
laugh however is with you; for, with-
drawing your finger from the pool, you
find that you are taking the crab with
you; and with the aid of a tin-opener
you can afterwards, at your leisure, re-
move the captured beast and transfer
it to your killing bottle.
And finally, it has just been dis-
covered that starfish make excellent
and reliable compasses. Balanced care-
fully upon the ferule of a walking-stick
the intrepid animal will invariably turn
one of its feet to the north, the other ex-
tremities marking the remaining points
of the compass with equal accuracy.

FLORA AND FAUNA of THE BEACH.
A walk along the beach at Conger-
ville or any of our Southern watering-
places will reveal many unexpected
treasures which the keen collector can
add to his bag. One of the most com-
mon, and yet least understood, objects
to be found upon the sea-shore is the
Single Boot. One would naturally
expect to find them nesting in couples,
but for some unexplained reason they
develop best alone.
A very common weed growing round
our shores and flourishing particularly
at this time of the year is Father. It
grows horizontally; is anything from
five to six feet from head to toe; and
wears a paper over its face to protect it
from the sun. So numerous is it that
in some parts of the coast great care
has to be taken not to step on it. A
really good specimen will sometimes
rise in the centre to a height of two or
three feet, and thus afford ample shade
to the weary pedestrian.
On such obvious fauna as crabs and
starfishes it is not necessary to dilate at
any length; the most inexperienced
traveller is sufficiently familiar with
them. It may not, however, be known
that by far the best method of catching
crabs is to tickle for them.
The process is as follows: the object
of capture having been marked down
in a likely pool, the hunter lies at full
length upon the rocks and begins to
BEACH ETIQUETTE.
Etiquette at the seaside is naturally
not so formal as it is in London, and
acquaintances may be made on the
pier or in the sea much more easily than
would be the case in Mayfair. For
instance, it is permissible when bathing
to introduce yourself to a stranger
swimming near, on what would seem
in London the comparatively slight
excuse that his bathing-costume had
the same coloured stripes as your own.
Again, a genial remark may always be
made to an old gentleman fishing off
the end of the pier—an enquiry, to give
an example, as to whether he had
caught anything or, failing that, hoped
to catch anything.
Dress again is less rigid in its cast-
iron convention than it would be in
Belgravia, and the ladies of your board-
ing establishment will probably find that
a dressy blouse will be all that is required
in the evening. (The word “all,” of
course, is used in its comparative sense
only.)
Generally speaking, in short, life by
the sea will be found much more com-
panionable than life in London; and
though seaside friendships do not
always turn out as desirable as they
seemed at first, it may well happen
that you may make a life-long friend of
the man whom you first made acquaint-
ance with as you tapped the sea-weed
barometer together in the hall of your
away some of the sea. At the same

But, though her frenzy seems to sink
Before she grabs her swain-elect,
Though never in her wild, wild

She lures me captive to her charms
And bears me off (indeed, I think,
The lift-man would object);
Though unconcernedly she sets
Her hair in trim and pulls a cube
Of chocolate from her leather bag,
Sucks it, and opes her morning
rag,
And never for my fair face frets

rejection in speech notable for dexterous
back-thrust administered to his old
adversary, the whole-hogger on Tariff
Reform. Supporters of Bill pleaded
that question had been before constitu-
encies at last General Election, and
that in framing the measure Ministers
were obeying popular mandate. “Not
at all,” said SALISBURY. “If there had
been no proposal for taxes on food
before the electors in December, 1910,
every candid honest Liberal knows that
his party would not have won the day.”
It was towards close of debate that
Bishop of HEREFord rose from group
whose snow-white rochets cast upon
Benches below Gangway what HALS-
BURY, looking on, recognised as “a
sort of" halo. HEREFord did not go
so far as to support Second Reading.
All he asked was that, granted a Second
Reading, the Bill should go into Com-
mittee with intent to have its
blemishes removed.
By striking coincidence it
happened that in the Commons,
within this very hour, TIM
HEALY and WILLIAM O'BRIEN
had been assaulting John
REDMond in connection with
BIRRELL's Bill designed to hurry
up Land Purchase in Ireland.
Their patriotic passion paled its
ineffectual fire by comparison

horrible thought chills his

Ministers at outset volun-
teered full statement of
their private dealings in the matter, the
cloud would have blown over. Profit-
ing by this experience KENSINGTON
yesterday, as soon as Lord CHANCELLoR
took his seat on Woolsack, rose and
with proper penitentiary air made
clean breast of what CREwe playfully
called “his crime.”
To-day the Leaders of House and
Opposition, having been in consultation
overnight, delivered judgment. CREwB,
admitting absence of deliberately evil
intention, suggested, amid murmur of
applause, that it would “probably be
the desire of the House not to proceed
further in the matter.” LANSDown E
agreed, “if only,” as he shrewdly put it,
“for the reason that practically no

mission appointed to inquire into the
dark places whence the Jamieson Raid
emerged, he was accustomed, at ap-
proach of his usual luncheon hour, to
send out for a dish-load of ham sand-
wiches and a tankard of stout. Of
these he proceeded to make leisurely
disposition under the eyes of hungry
Commissioners.
The MEMBER For SARK is reminded
how, whenever he, HARcourt, LABBY
and others put a peculiarly ticklish
question, RHODES took an excep-
tionally large bite from the sandwich
sarily followed interval for masticating
the food preliminary to regained articu-
lation, a pause that, incidentally, gave
opportunity for framing suitable answer.
If CECIL RHoDEs thus publicly
lunched during process of critical
inquiry why should Members of Select
Committees be debarred from similar
privilege? A simple luncheon, with
a tankard or long tumbler according
to individual taste, a cigar or pipe to
follow, would do much to popularise
the daily meeting upstairs.

having three times definitely refused to
see them, was absent from his residence
when they called cannot be said to
have militated in any way against the
success of the visit, which has been so
great that it is generally understood
that the Scottish Deputation Season
has now begun.
The Deputation from the parish
councils of Strathbogie and district,
which will leave for London towards
the end of August to lay before the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER its
views upon the introduction of a mini-
mum wage for agricultural labourers,
does not seem to have been discouraged
by the information that Mr. LLoyd
GEoRGE will be on the Continent at
the date of its arrival. An extended
week-end ticket has been arranged for.
The Deputation representing the
got together at Fraserborough to wait
upon the FIRST Lord of THE ADMIRALTY
and discuss with him the prospects of
adopting the use of cod-liver oil in the
Navy, will reach London on the first
Friday in September. Names are
coming in very well, and it is con-
fidently expected that special railway
rates will be quoted. Curiously enough
Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL will be pay-
ing a visit to his constituents in
Dundee over that week-end.
The Deputation of Wee Free Elders
from Inverstrathbittock-on-Spey (to
call upon the SECRETARY FoR Scot-
LAND upon business that has not yet
been divulged), and that of the in-
habitants of the island of Tiree (to wait
upon Mr. John BURNs in connection
with their new town-planning scheme),
have apparently arranged to co-operate
in order to secure a reserved
saloon by the East Coast route.
It is announced that they cor-
dially homologate each other's
opinions.
A curious position has arisen
in Paisley, where a large and
influential Deputation has been
made up, which is expected to
leave for the South in October.
Every detail is settled with the
exception of the object of the
visit and members are complain-
ing that it is well-nighimpossible
for them to complete the pre-
paration of their speeches until
this point has been decided.
The Autumn Announcements
of the North British Railway
Company will, we learn, contain
an entirely new feature which,
is bound to prove popular. It is pro-
posed to issue “Deputation Tickets” on
certain dates in the course of the winter,
which—provided that a sufficient num-
ber of applications is received—will
carry with them the best of saloon
accommodation at a reduced rate.
The members of the original Woman's
Suffrage Party, who must be regarded
as the pioneers of the movement, have
been so much delighted with their first
experience that they are now arranging
to take this Deputation on tour.
Meanwhile, the enterprising London
photographer is quite awake to the
new possibilities that have been opened
up. (We do not, of course, mean the
Press photographer; he has done very
well out of it, but, as far as he is con-
cerned, the boom is over.) One leading
firm in Regent Street has already dis-
patched a traveller to the North, offer-
ing special terms for groups to be taken

in hand at the moment. There neces-

AT THE PLAY.
“THE BARRIER."
IF it had been an Italian opera
instead of an American melodrama, it
must have been called “La Fanciulla
del North-West.”
between the First Acts of Mr. HUBBARD's
play and Signor Puccini's music-drama
was inevitable, since the Drink-and-
General-Utility Store is the centre of
social life in these pioneer com-
munities. The title of Mr. REX
BEACH's novel refers to the invidious
bar of birth which threatens to keep
two lovers apart. The Girl of the
Golden N.W. is supposed to be a half-
breed. No one who cast even a cursory
glance at the charming face of Necia
(Miss MAY BLAYNEY) would have
suspected her for a moment of being
anything short of a whole-breed. As
a matter of fact her
parentage was white on
both sides, though, in the
case of her father, it was
not the whiteness of driven
snow, for his heart was as
black as ink. All comes
well in the end, though I
should have liked to see
her marry the picturesque
trapper who never worried
| about her birth, rather
than the U.S.A. Lieu-
| tenant who took some
time to get over it.
It is, I believe, con-
trary to etiquette on the
stage to keep a secret from
| the audience. Yet it was
not till quite late in the
proceedings that we got
at the facts of the death of the girl's
mother; and for a dark hour or so we
were allowed to harbour suspicion
about the career of her innocent foster-
father. He himself did not help
matters much by attempting a murder
before our eyes. Fortunately he missed
by six inches and eventually left the
boards without a stain on his character.
The facts came out in the course of
the best scuffle of the evening. The
situation was unusual and could only
have been possible in a tentative state
of society where Justice is compelled
from time to time to lift her bandage
and wink openly by the light of nature.
A deadly feud divided the girl's two
fathers—the real and the adoptive.
Each had a sorry record, true or false,
and the representative of law and order,
in the person of Lieutenant Burrell,
U.S.A. Cavalry, thought it most con-
venient to let them fight it out for
themselves with one revolver between
them. So he deposited it on the table,
But the resemblance

from it, and withdrew from the room
with the other revolver. In the heavy
rough-and-tumble which ensued when
the lamp had been knocked over, the
adoptive father does the villain to
death. Before going out to expire he
gives his case away in the course of
a brief, but luminous, dialogue. The
impression left upon me by this hurried
exchange of conversation was to the
following effect:-
Real Father. You shot my wife'
Foster-Father. Liar. You shot her |
Real Father. Liar. She shot herself

Another Alaskan novelty was pre-
sented in the casual procedure at
the meeting held for the promotion of
the No-Creek Mining Company on the
site of the claims—a wild scene in “The
Divide of Black Beer Creek.” The
villain had been careful not to peg out

a claim of his own, because he pro-
posed to usurp that of the girl on the
alleged ground of its illegality, and
nobody was allowed to hold more
than one. You would have thought
that, having meanwhile no part in the
property, he had no locus sedendi at the
meeting. Nevertheless, he went so far
as to take the chair and conduct the
business with a fine air of autocracy.
However, it is not for our sophisticated
intelligences to attempt to cope with
these savage anomalies; and, anyhow,
the matter was settled by arrangement,
the Lieutenant (as usual) suddenly cover-
ing the opposition with his revolver,
and making them hold up their hands.
Indeed the villain passed a good deal of
his time in this position, rather ludi-
crous when prolonged. But why, on
the present occasion, when he had a
revolver in one of his raised hands, he
didn't let it off in the face of his enemy
two feet away, I am unable to conjec-
ture. He was not troubled with

himself punctilious about shooting only
from the hip.
But, if there were things beyond my
Cisatlantic understanding, I under-
stood enough to see that, for what it
pretended to be, the play was something
more than passable. You will have
gathered that it was not lacking in
incident; and, though there were
longueurs in the love-making, which
did not suit our hero, the Lieutenant,
nearly so well as the revolver business,
the interest was strong to the last.
And, apart from the behaviour of one of
the minor characters, the performance
of Mr. HUBBARD's melodrama bore ex-
ceptionally few traces of the Surrey-
side tradition.
Miss MAY BLAYNEY was a piquante
heroine ; - Mr. MALcol M. CHERRY a
workmanlike hero; Mr. Rock (the
foster-father) as sound as his name;
and Mr. MATHEson LANG,
the French-Canadian trap-
per, extremely picturesque.
His broken English, with
a touch in it—so I thought
—of the negro quality,
was very effective; and as
extra-hero, of the sacrificial
kind, he won great favour
with the audience. Of the
rest Mr. HUBERT WILLIS,
in the part of No-Creek
Lee, was very good.
Altogether, a clean piece
of work, full of movement,
and far better worth seeing
than a great deal of more
pretentious stuff; and if
only our holiday invaders
are well advised I don't
see what's to stop the run
of it this side of October. O. S.

(With some slight assistance from “The
Westminster Gazette.”)
THE subject of the Presidential ad-
dress, always canvassed with eager in-
terest in scientific and lay circles alike,
has of course been long ago definitely
determined in its main outlines. Sir
OLIVER Lodge intends to take a survey
of the position of science generally.
Happily this scheme is sufficiently
elastic to allow of his dealing with a
number of topics which the academic
scientist would probably regard as taboo.
Amongst these, we understand, are the
Psychics of Golf, with especial reference
to the question whether it is legitimate
to hypnotise your opponent; Recent
Cranial Modifications in the Midlands
pointing to the ultimate triumph of a
Type distinguished for its high dome-
shaped Forehead; Interviews as an
engine for promoting University Exten-
sion; the Poetry of the Aztecs; the
Influence of Brown Boots on Telepathy,
and other cognate subjects. Thus
handled, the subject of his address is
obviously of sufficient breadth to afford
versatility and range of outlook on life
and its problems effective scope for an
oration as stimulating and exhilarating
as any delivered from the Presidential
Chair.
This engaging and unconventional
quality will also be found illustrated in
the programme of the various sections.
Of course the essentially scientific
element predominates, but a certain
latitude is allowed in the choice of
|subjects which is eminently calculated
to command the interest of even the
non-scientific mind.
Thus in the section dealing with
Economics and Statistics there will be a
remarkable debate on the cost of living.
Sir HENRY HoworTH will handle the
question of Prehistoric Working-men's
Budgets, Lord Court.NEY of PENwitH
will discuss the Finance of League
Football Clubs, and Sir W. RoBERT-
son NicoLL will read a paper on the
Kentish Coal Fields and their influence
on Nonconformist Journalism.

LAURENCE BINYon, Mr. MAURICE HEw-
LETT and Mr. EDMUND GossE will

Sir ALFRED Mond will deal in his Pre-
sidential Address with the Misuse of
Prehistoric Oil-wells for bathing by the
Troglodytes of the Caucasus, and Mr.
John MASEFIELD will read a paper on
the Etiquette of Cannibalism. The
Physiologists will have before them
such subjects as “The Cause of chronic
Hiccups among Caddies,” a “Study
of Oysters in Times of War,” and a
“Theory of the Behaviour of Guinea-
igs.”
In the Education section a variety of
intensely interesting subjects are down
for discussion. Amongst these we may
note “Champagne and Cigarettes in
the Holidays,” “Should Preparatory
Schoolmasters be on the Telephone?”
“A Plea for Administering Corporal
Punishment to Parents,” and “Ought
Left-handed Battingtobefncouraged?"
In short, the programme, whether
we consider its latitude or its longi-
tude, bids fair to be as nutritive as

we all wanted you to come.”
“No matter,” I said, “I feel like it to-day. I will carry

“We shan't want a table-cloth.”
“Is that wise, Francesca? A table-cloth gives an air
of aristocratic ease to the humblest feast. You shake your

you cutting the bread-and-butter and making the tea. . The

“I do. I am. And what is more, you are coming with

“We will see about that,” I said gloomily. “But first
let me tell you that Garden Parties don't exist. They are
Victorian. They are like Penny Readings and Literary

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Gracechurch (LoNGMANs) is one of those books that to
some readers may perhaps seem lacking in “sustained
interest,” but to others, of whom I myself am certainly one,
will have all the charm of true and remembered childhood.
It is the record of his own childhood's surroundings that
Mr. JoHN Ayscough tells in these short and simple annals
of a mid-Victorian country town. Exactly how far things
happened just so, and how far the art of the grown-up
novelist has improved upon the memory of the small boy,
it is not for me to say. Perhaps even Mr. Ayscough
himself is not altogether sure on this point—at least, so I
gathered from his entirely charming dedication, which, as
a model of such things, should not be passed unread.
Of the sketches or studies or stories (it is a little difficult
to find the right word for them) that the book introduces,
I liked best the group that centres in the Thorn family.
Especially do I recall the grim little picture that ends the
first of these, called “Sal Fish,” which tells how Fernando
Thorn ruined the hopes of his sister Kezia (who doted on
him, and expected the handsome lad to marry a friend of
her own) by wedding a girl who cried fish in the streets of
Gracechurch. The sudden shock destroyed Kezia's mental
balance; and we see her later, as the boy Ayscough saw
her, a middle-aged, over-dressed woman, “as mad as a
March hare,” sailing in to call on the triumphant sister-in-
law, “who presently would turn to look at her, without
interrupting her knitting, but with a full turn of her body
maybe.’ And Kezia would collapse.” Without doubt the
little Ayscough had an eye for the dramatic.
Collision (DUckworth) is Miss BRIDGET MACLAGAN's
second novel, and I wish that it had more of the simple
directness of her first. I am really confused as to what
happened between Gopi Chand, Maggie, Mr. Trotter and all
her other queer people who explored India together. Miss
MACLAGAN is very clever; she knows how to give you a
character's physical peculiarities with a mere twist of the
pen; but this makes the clouded confusion of the incidents
all the more to be regretted. I have, for instance, a very
clear idea of that powerful little monster, Mr. Benjamin
Trotter, and I feel that he should do most interesting things.
It is possible that he does; but the author knows more
about that than I do. In Maggie, again, I hoped that here
at last one would enjoy a human and glowing portrait of a
Suffragette, someone who was both real and interesting.
But no, the incidents in which she shared are veiled and
hidden.
It is, I believe, “atmosphere” that has made Miss MAC-
LAGAN so elusive. Atmosphere at any price always leads
to confusion in an Indian novel, because it is so strong and
highly coloured that it swallows up the characters in those
clouds of yellow dust of which we hear so much. In her
next book, when one of her characters inquires, “What's the
matter?” (they do so continually in Collision), she must
answer the question so that the reader can comfortably
settle down in his chair and know where he is. Miss
MACLAGAN is too clever a writer for hide-and-seek to be

in her chair, as she would say, “Fidgety to-day ! Full moon,
worth her while.

Happy-Go-Lucky (BLAckwood) is well-named, for Mr.
IAN HAY has never drawn a more irresponsible, irrepressible
hero than The Freak. I had indeed begun to endure this
youth very gladly, when (opposite page 106) I saw an
illustration of him by Mr. C. E. BRock, and my feelings
received a rude buffet. Until that moment it had not
occurred to me that The Freak could also be a nut, and the
difference between Mr. BRock's conception of him and
mine disturbed me not a little. Once over that difficulty,
however, I derived much amusement from a book which is
full of high spirits and high jinks. Mr. HAY must have
been in a holiday mood when he wrote Happy-Go-Lucky,
and seaside librarians will be tired of its name before the
summer is ended. The characters—save The Freak him-
self and Mr. Welwyn–are conventional enough, and so is
the theme of a rich and only son falling in love with a
dressmaker; but the treatment is Mr. HAY's, which is as
much as to say that it is slightly sentimental and very
diverting. I must add that, if Mr. BRock had not

[Some parts of the East Coast have been rapidly disappearing.]
V. V. in fact is a character which any writer might be proud
to father; and to have carefully cut out the sentimentality
which might have spoiled it is a considerable feat of re-
ticence. Perhaps, after all, the publishers were justified.
The Garden of Ignorance (JENKINs) has this quality to
distinguish it from most other books on the same topic,
that it really does deal with the gardening troubles of an
ignoramus, and trace his gradual progress (or, in this case,
hers) to the rewards of knowledge. Mrs. GEORGE CRAN
is the gardener; and, whether or not her story is wholly
a true one, and she did or did not in fact bring to her
garden so entire a lack of experience in the first place, she
certainly tells the tale of her education and ultimate
triumphs in a way that is both entertaining and helpful.
I liked especially the passage in which she relates how,
from the chance phrase of a guest, “What a paradise this
will be after you've worked at it two or three years,”
there was born in her mind the idea that “a garden was
a canvas on which to
paint a picture in flowers
and trees and winding
paths.” There is no
question that Mrs. CRAN
thoroughly enjoyed the
process; and the results
achieved appear—judg-
ing them by a number
of excellent photographs
scattered throughout the
volume—to have more
than repaid her efforts.
Thousands of garden-
lovers will rejoice in this
homely and practical
book, which is further
enriched by a useful
appendix on the various
| flowers mentioned in its
course, with hints upon
their treatment. I have

business magnate—someone called the Heths “improbable”
people—is intent on a successful marriage, with all the
insincerity and heartlessness that go to make for victory in
that ruthless quest. V. V.'s path crosses hers, menacingly

THE HOM BURG CURE.
As one that has high work to do—
To win a rowing pot or two,
To box till all is black and blue,
Or run a league against the ticker–
Will wean his flesh, by force of mind,
From pleasures of a carnal kind
Likely to spoil his second wind,
As pastry, jam and liquor;--
Or as a man about to sail
Beyond the missionary's pale,
Where insalubrious airs prevail
That turn the health and temper rocky,
Will take some prophylactic pains
To cope with tropic heats and rains
By introducing in his veins
A stream of streptococci;-
Not otherwise, my James, you go
Where Homburg's healing waters ſlow,
And doctors keep your diet low ; ;
With regimens of awful rigour;
Bravely resigned to kiss the scourge
Laid on your grosser self, and purge
Your inward parts, and so emerge
A masterpiece of vigour.
Deadly the strain that you'll endure
Of what is loosely termed a “cure"—
That process which renews the pure
And perfect type of lissome beauty;
Yet what a purpose!—to repair .
The tummy's annual wear and tear
And fit yourself once more to dare
The coming season's duty.
A noble sacrifice, I say,
And must, for one, admire the way .
We English spend our holiday
Practising deeds of self-denial;
I recognise the patriot's part
. . . And-cry from out an envious heart,
; : “Fair, winds attend you as you start
* . . To face this searching trial l’’
And, when in Town you take your meed,
I'll mark the vie de lure you lead,
Performing miracles of greed
With scarce a single pause for panting,
And think of how your strength was won
Where Homburg's loathéd waters run,
And say, “Such feats are never done
Except by prayer and banting.” O. S.
PERILS OF THE DEEP.
I HAVE made my will and arranged that Aunt Mary shall
become guardian of my white mouse “Itobert " in the event
of my not returning, for I am embarking on a hazardous
voyage. There are so many dangers which may prevent
my return. I have worked it out and find that my chance
is about 1:563 in a thousand of ever seeing home and
friends again.
The Company has very kindly sent me a list of the chances
to be faced; and I am determined to fare boldly forth to meet
loss of, or injury to, passengers from any of the following
causes (I quote from the conditions under which I sail):-
“The Act of God, the King's enemies, pirates, restraint of
Princes . . . barratry, collision . . . damage by vermin
. . . perils of the seas and rivers . . . defective stowage
. smell, insufficient ventilation . . . neglect of the
Company's officers, deluge and deviation.”
These are but a part of the many nicely-varied ways in
which I may end my short, but so far pleasant, life.
You, out of the kindness of your heart, will say, “Bold
adventurer. This is the stuff of which heroes are made. Is
it an air-ship venture, or does he voyage to Pernambuco
or Singapore?”
Nay, friend, my ticket is taken to Dublin by one of the
lesser known routes. Where I shall arrive is evidently
quite another question (see “Deviation"). Very possibly |
our gallant skipper, glancing at my ticket, will say, “No,
no, my lad, not Dublin. This voyage my health requires
a week-end in Japan.” Or the steward will have a brother ||
prospecting in Peru, and we shall simply deviate to see how
the world goes with him.
At any rate, you will agree that it is at best a hazardous
adventure, though, judging by the first danger on the list,
I gather that my captain is a man of religion.
“Pirates,” of course, in these days one is always prepared
for. But “Princes”? I always have said that a Prince
is a nasty risky sort of thing to meet at any time.
“Barratry”. I pass because I don't know what it means;
but how well it would sound on a tombstone!
Glancing on a little, we come to the dread words,
“damage by vermin.” Cockroaches, it seems, may be
encountered. Very possibly passengers are carried simply
to feed the brutes, and thus leave the captain and crew free
to discharge their duties unmolested. . . .
“Dangers of scas and rivers"? I wonder if last voyage
the captain took her up to Henley and was run down by
a can Oe. - - - -
“Defective stowage.” It looks as if my sleeping-com-
partment might be congested. I may find myself with the
live-stock (is it towards Ireland or away that pigs mostly
travel?), or with the frozen mutton which comes from
New Zealand. The latter association might be very
tolerable in sultry weather. The idea of a little frozen
leg of mutton lying in a corner of my cabin, clad chastely
in white muslin, has often appealed to me. -
“Neglect of the Company's officers.” Evidently I must
not count on my evening game of chess with the Bosun.
It will be a hard life indeed if no one is told off to
a. In use Ine. - -
And “Deluge.” This is annoying. Surely steamers
should tow an Ark on every voyage. Though in these
degenerate days we have no navigators to compare with
the devoted and adventurous NoAH, the sight of a comfort-
able, roomy Ark bobbing on the waves astern would give
timid travellers a feeling of great security.
Altogether, the prospect is very sinister. Yet I am an
Englishman. I come of a race of heroic and fearless tars.
With this thought to uphold me I take my life in my
hand and fare forth to encounter the perils of the Anglo-
Irish passage. -
A Song of Ninepence.
Sing a song of Ninepence, such a little sum,
Yet it means a whole day's outing from the slum;
Send it, then (and kind hearts should be gladly dunned)

was when telling it at lunch time to
McPherson, who is a friend of a clerk
in our office. I told it to him three
times, in order that he might see the

Upon consideration, I am bound to
admit that there is something in what
he says, and am sorry that I unwittingly
shocked his religious prejudices.
After McPherson had left, another

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AMONG THE ANIMALS.
JEREMy was looking at a card which
his wife had just passed across the
table to him.
“‘Lady Bendish. At Home,” he
read. “‘Pets.” Is this for us?”
“Of course,” said Mrs. Jeremy.
“Then I think “ Pets’ is rather
familiar. “Mr. and Mrs. J. P. Smith'
would have been more correct.”
“Don’t be silly, Jeremy. It means
it's a Pet party. You have to bring
some sort of pet with you, and there
are prizes for the prettiest, and the
most intelligent, and the most compan-
ionable, and so on.” She looked at the
fox-terrier curled up in front of the
fireplace. “We could take Rags, of
course.”
“Or Baby,” said Jeremy.
enter her in the Fat Class.”
But when the day arrived Jeremy
had another idea. He came in from the
garden with an important look on his
face, and joined his wife in the hall.
“We’ll
“Come on,” he said. “Let's start.”
“But where's Rags?”
“Rags isn't coming. I'm taking
Hereward instead.” He opened his
cigarette case and disclosed a small
green animal. “Hereward,” he said.
“Why, Jeremy,” cried his wife, “it’s
—why, it's blight from the rose-tree!”
“It isn't just blight, dear; it's one
particular blight. A blight. Hereward,
the Last of the Blights.” He wandered
round the hall. “Where's the lead 2 ”
he asked.
“Jeremy, don't be absurd.”
“My dear, I must have something
to lead him up for his prize on. During
the parade he can sit on my shoulder
informally; but when we come to the
prize-giving, ‘Mr. J. P. Smith's blight,
Hereward,” must be led on properly.”
He pulled open a drawer. “Oh, here
we are. I'd better take the chain; he
might bite through the leather one.”
They arrived a little late, to find a
lawn full of people and animals; and
one glance was sufficient to tell Jeremy
that in some of the classes at least his
pet would have many dangerous rivals.
“If there's a prize for the biggest,”
he said to his wife, “my blight has
practically lost it already. Adams has
brought a cart-horse. Hullo, Adams,”
he went on, “how are you? Don't come
too close or Hereward may do your
animal a mischief.”
“Who’s Hereward 2 ”
Jeremy opened his cigarette-case.
“Hereward,” he said. “Not the
woodbine; that's quite wild. The
blight. He's much more domesticated,
but there are moments when he gets
out of hand and becomes unmanage-
and I had to chase him through the
churchyard; that's why we're late.”
“Does he take meals with the
family 2” asked Adams with a grin.
“No, no; he has them alone in the
garden. You ought to see him having
his bath. George, our gardener, looks
after him. George gives him a special
bath of soapy water every day. Here-
ward simply loves it. George squirts
on him, and Hereward lies on his back
and kicks his legs in the air. It's really
quite pretty to watch them.”
He nodded to Adams, and wandered
through the crowd with Mrs. Jeremy.
The collection of animals was remark-
able; they varied in size from Adams's
cart-horse to Jeremy's blight; in play-
fulness from the Vicar's kitten to Miss
Trehearne's chrysalis; and in ability
for performing tricks from the Major's
poodle to Dr. Bunton's egg of the
Cabbage White.
“There ought to be a race for them
all,” said Mrs. Jeremy. “A handicap,
of course.”
“Hereward is very fast over a short
distance,” said Jeremy, “but he wants
encouragement. If he were given ninety-
nine yards, two feet and eleven inches
in a hundred, and you were to stand in
front of him with a William Allan
Richardson, I think we might pull it
off. But of course he's a bad starter.
Hullo, there's Miss Bendish.”
Miss Bendish, hurrying along, gave
them a word as she went past.
“They're going to have the inspec-
tion directly,” she said, “and give the
prizes. Is your animal quite ready?”
“I should like to brush him up a
bit,” said Jeremy. “Is there a tent or
anywhere where I could prepare him 2
His eyebrows get so matted if he's left
to himself for long.” He took out a
cigarette and lit it.
“There's a tent, but you'll have to
hurry up.”
“Oh, well, it doesn't really matter,”
said Jeremy, as he walked along with
her. “Hereward's natural beauty and
agility will take him through.”
On the south lawn the pets and their
owners were assembling. Jeremy took
the leash out of his pocket and opened
his cigarette case.
“Good heavens !” he cricd. “Here-
ward has escaped Quick! Shut the
gates' " He saw Adams near and
hurried up to him. “My blight has
escaped,” he said breathlessly, holding
up the now useless leash. “He gnawed
through the chain and got away. I'm
afraid he may be running amok among
the guests. Supposing he were to leap
upon Sir Thomas from behind and
savage him — it's too terrible.” He
moved anxiously on. “Have you seen
“He has escaped, and we are rather
anxious. If he were to get the Vicar
down and begin to worry him—”
He murmured something about “once
getting the taste for blood” and
hurried off. The guests were assembled,
and the judges walked down the line
and inspected their different animals.
They were almost at the end of it when
Jeremy sprinted up and took his place
by the last beast.
“It's all right,” he panted to his
wife, “I’ve got him. Silly of me to
mislay him, but he's so confoundedly
shy.” He held out his finger as the
judges approached, and introduced them

NOBLESSE OBLIGE 2
HoNEsty is all very well as a policy
but it is sometimes very bad manners.
If I had only known how unspeakably
straightforward and outspoken George
Nesbitt was in the matter of victuals
and drink I might never have taken
him and his wife on after the theatre
to supper at the only supping place in
London, and I certainly shouldn't have
handed him the wine list and her the
menu. I should have myself ordered
the table d'hôte supper and a bottle of
the best and given them no chance.
As it was, I left the choice to them,
with the implication that expense
was no object; and they took me at
my word—always a dangerous thing
to do.
Imagine my discomfiture, surrounded
as I was by the pink of Society, to see
George beginning at the wrong end of
the wine list |
“Your appointed task is to select a
wine,” said I, “and not to collect
curious information concerning mineral
waters and cigarettes.”
“Why wine,” asked George, “and
why not beer?”
“H'sh,” I interrupted him apprehen-
sively. “They might hear you.”
“And what if they do?” said George.
“Nay more, what if they see me?”
I asked, with horror, if he was aware
what he was saying. He spoke, he
assured me, and was about to act, with
the utmost deliberation. He had no
intention of belying his feelings or
denying his taste in order to impress
people who were really belying their
feelings and denying their tastes in
order to impress him. “I don't be-
lieve,” said he, “either in their air of
wickedness in general or their lust for
champagne in particular. That fat
jovial old gentleman over there, what
is he but a keen man of business who
has got rich by the most glaring in-
dustry, and would have got richer still
if he had not been unable to be un-
scrupulous. Do you think he deceives
me by smiling subtly as he drinks his
champagne? Does he do it because it is
his idea of pleasure? or in order to create
an atmosphere and conceal his sterling
qualities under a show of ultra-smart-
ness? And his daughter there, what has
she to do with the magnum ? Do you
think she really prefers these goings-on
to a glass of hot milk and an early
bed 2 . Even the lubricated youth by
her side, are his motives honest ? I
shouldn't be surprised to learn that,
when there are no appearances to keep
up and he is absolutely sure that there
is no one looking, he quenches his
thirst with shandy-gaff. As for us, are

“What has that to do with it 2 ” I
said. “If you drink shandy-gaff here,
I shall go.”
George resumed the wine list. “Ex-
pense is at least no object with you?”
“Nor,” said I proudly, “with any-
one else in the room.”
“With the others,” he waved a dog-
matic hand to include the whole room,
“expense is the sole object, but you I
take to admit that there are other
things to drink besides mere bubble,
and that the best of all liquids comes
out of a barrel. Waiter, we will drink
Pilsener, and so would everybody else
if only it was extremely expensive.”
To maintain my dignity before the
waiter, “There is no such champagne,”
George was not to be stopped. “I
want BEER. If it wasn't so late at
night I should want stout. Bring me
beer in a jug, and if anyone at a neigh-
bouring table demands an explanation

O Porpoise, gamesome beast and

You that were Liberty's true child

'Tis with mixed feelings that I gaze
On one well known in other days,
And much esteemed.
For, truly, of all ocean sights
You are the one that most delights
The sad, bored eye
Of him whose watch, horizon-bound,
Sees but the great deep stretching

And no land nigh.
'Tis sweet to mark you sport and

Taking the maddest kind of risk
From the sharp prow,
Yet, somehow, never cut in two;
How you escaped I never knew,
And don't know now.
And then to see you sprint, and skip
Light-hearted past the quivering ship
In idle cheer,
Or to engulf some hapless meal,
I know not, but the swiftest keel
Yes, porpoise, you're an agile thing;
The young bird in his pride of wing,
The cub, the pup,
The kitten, too, delight to sport;
But, as a rule, they cut it short
As they grow up.
But you—nor years nor weight can dim
The fire of that hilarious vim
With which you shave
The steely prow, and leap, and dive,
And generally look alive,
But never grave.
One would have bet, a thing so free
Would find his life one sparkling spree,
A constant game;
Even the dour and ravening shark
Would merely lend an added lark,
To dodge the same.

proceedings. Temperance was the order
of the day.
Committee witnessed an affecting
scene between BEAUCHAMP represent-
ing Government and SALISBURY leading
Opposition. There was about it some-
thing reminiscent of a once popular,
still vaguely famous, melodrama result-
ing in discovery of long-lost brother.
As conversation proceeded one almost
expected to see BEAUCHAMP bare his
right arm, disclosing the mulberry mark
which identified the strayed, loyally-
mourned kinsman. Stopping short of
that, Minister in charge of Bill publicly
thanked noble lords opposite, especially
the marquis, for their friendly attitude.
SALISBURY, brushing away a furtive
tear, acknowledged generosity of re-
marks thus made, but modestly depre-
cated excessive share of commendation
bestowed upon his unworthy self. The
PRIMATE interposing at this juncture,
the peers thought he was about to
pronounce a benediction. Instinctively
felt for their hats in which to bury
their faces. He however merely wanted
to say “how entirely he shared the
satisfaction that arrangement had been
arrived at, even if it were not com-
pletely satisfactory to the advanced
wings of those who represented two
sections of opinion.”
Here were Some Emotions. The
Moral not lacking. For the little more

hand the Lords presented object-lesson

Yesterday morning adjourned at a

night with Mental Deficiency Bill.
Another late sitting last night. Progress
blocked by little . of malcontents
on Ministerial side. Dulness of debate
illumined by solitary flash. New clause
moved abolishing death sentences in
cases of mental deficiency in criminals.
“I would sooner,” said WEDGwood
in reflective mood, “suffer the death
sentence than perpetual imprisonment
under this Bill.”
Scanty audience pricked up its ears.
Obvious that whichever alternative were
selected its adoption would necessarily
lead to a vacancy in the representation
of Newcastle-under-Lyme and the with-
drawal at Question time, and through
subsequent stages of a sitting, of a
persistent personality.
No one rose from either side to
procedure. Tacitly agreed to leave the
matter entirely in Mr. WEDGwood's
hands. - -

Mr. FELL picks up the hot potato.
Interesting conversation in smoking-
room to-day on subject of Members'
claims to pre-eminence in respect of
family antiquity.
SARK insists that the Member who
boasts the longest descent sits for East
Edinburgh. Careful study of the ques-
tion has convinced him that Mr. Hogg|E
is the lineal descendant of OG, King of
Bashan, who went out against the
ancient Israelites journeying forth from
the Wilderness.
Earlier in conversation ATHERLEY-
JoNEs drew attention to probability that
ATHERLEY is a modern variation on
ATHELSTANE, King of the West Saxons
and Mercia in the tenth century, later
crowned sovereign of all the English.
That he regarded as indisputable. But
when it came to reading Hogge for
OG, it was, if he might say so, going
absurdly beyond the extreme length of
the animal. Besides, as contemporary
chronicles record, the Israelites smote
OG, King of Bashan, his sons and all
his people, till there was none left
“That being so, how do you account
for Hogg E2" asked ATHERLEY with
that inflexible logic that marks alike
his Parliamentary and his forensic
addresses.
“I can't always account for him,”
said SARK, “especially when he goes
for the harmless SECRETARY of Scot-
LAND. All the same I am convinced
of his royal descent.”

“MR. AND MRs. HENRY HAwkINs ARE Now BAck IN Town AND INTEND To FURNISH THEIR NEw HoME IN THE HAcRNEY Road
witH objFTs D'ART Acquired DURING THEIR HONEY MOON.”
A LIGHT OFFENCE.
WE had just crossed a local Alp,
when Pilcott dismounted suddenly in
the lonely, pine-bordered road; and I
experienced a twinge of that unrea.
sonable sense of injury with which
the punctured sometimes inspire the
resilient.
But it wasn't that at all.
“I’ve had a feeling all day that there
was something I'd forgotten,” he said
blankly. “I forgot to fill the lamps!”
and he explained how he had emptied
them overnight, to clean them, and had
intended to refill them in the morning;
but — well, I suppose a Perpetual
Curate—that is Pilcott's métier—has
lots of things to think about.
His contrition was very proper. It
was, he owned, entirely his affair. He
had mounted me in the dewy morning—
since I was his guest and must be kept
amused—on the bicycle that commonly
goes district-visiting with his sister,
and, on his new and spirited all-black,
had given me a lead all day across a
stiff country.
“Now, what had we better do?”
he went on, in tones of suppressed
agitation. “Unless my watch is fast,
it's two minutes past Lighting-up
I pointed out that nature herself had
provided for the contingency by intro-
ducing a large and practicable moon
into the sky that arched our homeward
path.
“But it's past Lighting-up Time,”
he repeated, with such an air of simple
goodness as should have left me abashed.
But it didn't.
“Now, shall I ride back,” he con-
tinued with a brave cheerfulness, “and
get some oil?”
I thought of the Alp.
“Leave me, and turn Ultramontane?”
I said reproachfully.
“Or, as we shan't pass a house for
another six miles, shall we just walk 2"
“Ride,” I corrected him.
And then, standing in the pale moon-
light, he told me the story of Ernest
Gabbage. It was a true but unexciting
story. Ernest, a young man generally
of good principles, sang bass in the
village choir. But this did not avail
him in the hour of temptation. And
when he was ordered to pay half-a-
crown and costs for riding without a
light, Pilcott had had to lend him the
money till Saturday, and threw in a
homily with the loan.
“So, you see, I can't risk being
caught doing the same thing,” he said.
So we set our faces sadly to the
night.
We had not covered many leagues,
however, before I remembered that I
at least had not got to set an example
to Pilcott's parish. Indeed, it would be
rather presumptuous on my part . . .
I only rode at a gentle footpace. But
even the district-visiting bicycle's foot-
pace tried Pilcott. So I got off again;
and, at Four Ways Mark, Pilcott bared
his head to the night wind and stood a
moment in thought.
“I suppose,” he said, with a new
diffidence, with a note of apology that
I found touching—“I suppose cold
cutlets are all right—if-if there's a
salad.”
“Quite all right,” I conceded. “But
I shouldn't like—I mean, if you think
our delay will hurt the cook's feelings
in any way x - -
I watched him anxiously.
was, I think, an inward struggle. But
the priest conquered the man. We
went on again, footsore and dismounted.
“I had an aunt once,” I said pre-
sently, as we emerged on a heathy
plain, “a good woman, who believed
that if you felt that what you did was
right, and harmed nobody, why, then
there was no harm in what you did.”
There





Time.”
I stole a furtive glance at Pilcott's
“I’ve got to think of the example.”

face. Methought it looked pale and
stern in the white moonshine.
“But perhaps that is rank heresy," I
added hurriedly, urging in extenuation
that she was a Dissenter. --
On, on, and the road plunged into an
oak wood. How it happened I never
knew. Suddenly Pilcott was riding—
I was riding, with an uplifting of spirit,
with a lightness of heart that I had not
known since half-past eight. I breathed
an ampler air. I had become a wild
thing of the Forest—but with a human
appetite for cutlets. *
And then there was a scrunching
crash as four feet came to the ground
together. - -
We wheeled our bicycles forward.
“Good night, Williams,” said Pilcott
cheerily to the shadow that had re-
solved itself into a policeman. “A fine,
warm night.”
“Yes, Sir;"—and still our fate hung
in the balance. Oh, the slowness of
rustic speech – “good night, Sir,"
said Williams, the clement, the great-
hearted. -
There was an interval of chastened
silence.
“We got out of it better than
Ernest Gabbage did,” was my tactless
comment.
The Penitent said nothing.
“But of course,” I added with
sudden inspiration, “you can put half-
a-crown and costs in the plate on
Sunday.”
Pilcott heaved a sigh of relief. “I
certainly mean to,” he said fervently.
(But it was my idea.)
“And I,” I said, lifting myself de-
liberately into the saddle. “So that's
settled, and now we can have our
money's worth with a clear conscience.”
I don't know whether you can find
any fault with my argument; but, if
Pilcott did, he showed no outward sign
of sin, but ate his cutlets like a man
absolved.

“Those who are acquainted with the Ulster
Scot know that there is little of the jelly-fish
about him. He may be told that his ‘Coven-
ant' was rash, that it was unpatriotic—yea,
even that it is revolutionary—but he need not
be asked to tread it under foot.”
But that is the last thing we should
INSURANCE IN THE LOWER
SCHOOL. - s
OF course the whole thing has been
squashed now. That's the worst of
this place. It's simply no use having
ideas, and if you do get hold of a good
thing you may just as well chuck it
unless you can keep it dark. And all
the money had to be paid back—what
was left of it. That was a pretty com-
plicated affair to arrange to everyone's
satisfaction, for, as the Ape said him-
self, unexpired policies are tricky things
to value. It was the Ape who thought
of it, and as he has always been a
special pal of mine I was a good deal
mixed up in it from the start. I should
explain that he is an extraordinarily
brainy chap, the Ape. He simply sent
out a secret circular to say that he had
started an insurance company, and most
of the chaps tumbled to it tremendously.
He collected nearly five bob the first
evening. There was nothing that he
wouldn't insure you against (young
Forman, who was down with the flu,
took out a life policy), but his principal
lines were Insurance
(1) Against being licked.
(2) Against your rabbits dying.
(3) Against making a blob in a match
between forms.
(4) *. your watch stopping
efore the end of the term. (In
this case you had to prove that
it had been wound up the night
before in the presence of two
witnesses, which was rather a
nuisance.)
All that was pretty useful, as these
are the four things that chiefly worry
a chap at school. And later on he had
a ripping scheme on a sort of sliding
scale for insuring batting averages.
The Ape knew jolly well what he
was doing. As I have said, he is a
most extraordinarily brainy chap. He
was an excellent judge of risks, and you
never knew what sort of a premium you
would have to pay. Billy Turton had
to pay eightpence a week to insure
against being licked (which was paid
for at the rate of 1s. a licking, with a
bonus of 3d. if he got more than four);
but he took Little Mary—that 's Field
Junior—for a halfpenny a term. And
as for rabbits he absolutely refused to
take Billy's at any price at all. Which
showed his wisdom, because there was
some sort of infectious disease among
them that cleared out the lot before
half-term. The Ape did quite well out
of rabbits. He paid young Carey to go
round and feed them all in case their
owners forgot; and after Billy's epi-
demic he went about with a syringe and
I myself was simply insured up to the
hilt. It cost me a good lot, but I had
plenty of money at the beginning of term,
and after it was all fixed up I felt rip-
pingly snug and secure. I knew that
simply nothing could possibly go wrong
with me for the whole term, which is a
topping sort of feeling to have. It
didn't matter a bit if I left my new bat
out all night or had to sing a solo in
chapel or was bottom of the form and
got snarky letters from home or broke
rules or anything. **
The trouble is that you never really
know how things will turn out until
you try. As the term went on some of
the chaps who were insured against
being licked began to find that they
wern’t getting their money's worth.
And then there was a most extra-
ordinary outbreak of crime. The au-
thorities couldn't make it out at all.
Chaps went down town without leave
in batches of half-a-dozen at a time;
supper parties were held in the dormi-
tories; people were always climbing on
roofs, breaking windows, cattying the
house-master's fowls, missing roll-calls.
We really had a high old time for a
week or two, till Beardmore Minor
gave the whole show away. He had
just been licked for bringing a soda-
water syphon into form and spraying
Watkins Major over his shoulder, and
after he had had his six he was heard to
remark in a thoughtful kind of way,
“Well, that's ninepence, anyhow.”
And later on he confessed, under pres-
sure, that he simply had to be licked as
he had run out of jam for tea and
couldn't afford a new pot.
That was how it came out.

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOLIDAY PLANS.
July 24.—At last we have settled where to spend
our holidays. We are going to Les Sentiers, a most
delightful little place in Switzerland. The Mordaunts are
there and give a most attractive description of it. The
have promised to engage rooms for us at the Hôtel
Bertrand, which they say is much the best. After all this
uncertainty and discussion it is very pleasant to have fixed
everything. The children are overjoyed. They are now
practising the jodel in the garden.
July 25.—To-day I went to Cook's and bought the
tickets—very expensive. Was quite ashamed of myself for
asking so many questions about reserved seats in trains,
and sleeping cars, and restaurants, and customs, and
whether, if you travel second class, they admit you to
meals on the train or make you get out at stations and
eat there, which, as we are so many, would certainly make
all or some of us get lost. A dreadful fate, to be lost on
the Swiss frontier and to wander backwards and forwards
under perpetual customs' examinations. After about an
hour's talk with the gentleman behind the counter, with
everything or nearly everything settled and paid for, I
asked him about Les Sentiers. He said it was very popular
during winter, which was, of course, the best time, but if
we didn't mind the great heat during the day and the
chilliness of the nights we should perhaps be able to enjoy
ourselves. Some people, however, preferred Les Cailloux,
where the hotel was newer. Decided to say nothing at
home about Les Cailloux. As I came away I ran across
Battersby in Piccadilly. Told him I was off to Switzerland.
He said, “Wherever you go in Switzerland don't let anyone
tempt you to stay at Les Sentiers.” He then hurried off.
Wonder what they did to him at Les Sentiers. Mustn't
mention this at home either.
July 26.—Jack Moberley and Mrs. Jack motored down
and lunched with us. Told them where we were going.
They looked at one another and at first said nothing. Then
Mrs. Jack broke out and said she was too old a friend to let
us ruin our holidays by staying at such a dreadful place.
Jack chimed in and said it was the last place on earth and
he wouldn't be found dead in it. “Why the deuce,” he
added, “didn't you ask our advice? Now if you were going
to Les Cailloux it would be different. Everything's A1
there, but Les Sentiers is beyond conception for dulness.
You'll bore yourself stiff and the children will simply hate
it.” Unfortunately the children were present. After the
Moberleys had gone we held a family council and decided
to write to the Mordaunts and get them to countermand
rooms at Les Sentiers. On Monday I shall interview
Cook's and try to change our tickets for Les Cailloux. -
July 27.—Coming away from church this morning we
had a talk with Sir William and Lady Hartsley. Lady H.
said she was sure we shouldn't care for Switzerland in the
summer. In fact it was quite old-fashioned to go there
except for winter-sports. This was overheard by the
children, who have been under the impression that winter
sports go on in Switzerland all the year round. At luncheon
they all said they didn't want to go to Switzerland.
July 23,-Up to London and called again at Cook's. My
friend behind the counter not quite so friendly. Seemed
colder and more distant and tired more rapidly under my
questions. After a good deal of worry got tickets changed
for Les Cailloux. Lunched at the Club and found Erank
Naylor there. Told him we were going to Les Cailloux.
He said, “Then I pity you.” According to him it's a
terrible place. IIappened to meet Mrs. Nicholson in Bond
Street. She said, “Les Cailloux You'll be roasted and
been once, but never again for me.” This was a facer.
Told Alicia when I got home. She said, “Why go to
Switzerland at all? Let's go to the Isle of Wight.”
July 29–Up to London again, and called at Cook's.
Friend behind the counter tried to hide when he saw me.
Y | I got rid of all our tickets, countermanded all reserved
places, and, just to show there was no ill-feeling, took
tickets from him for Totland Bay. Wired there for rooms.
July 31.-No rooms to be had in Totland. Dare not
interview Cook's again. Shall throw the tickets away and
stay quietly at home. The children very despondent
and occasionally sarcastic. The Mordaunts wire to say
we shall have to pay a week for rooms engaged at Les
Sentiers.

THE fairway, I grant you, is shocking,
'Tis a nightmare of villainous lies,
Of speargrass that works through your stocking,
Of foul and importunate flies; -
The greens are “brunettes,” they are branded
With the trampling of bullock and horse,
And yet, to be thoroughly candid,
We're proud of our Gurrumpore course.
And why? Ask the vulture that track'd us,
Poised fearless o'er eyrie and bluff;
Ask the cobra that gaped through the cactus
At the sound of our laugh in the rough;
Go, stand where yon cataract crashes
In a passion of thunder and foam,
And ask of our jubilant mashies
If they yearn for the hazards at Home.
Though a tigress may happen to stalk me
Through the shadows of cañon and chine;
Though the yowl of her offspring may balk me
Of holes that were morally mine;
Shall my golf be upset by a trifle,
When “a tiger (or adult or cub)
May be gently removed with a rifle”—
Rule 1X, of the Gurrumpore Club?

The anthills that guard number three.
It's not a long course—you'll remember
The landslip just after the rains
That robbed us of half in September,

Though St. Andrews would greet it with mirth,
From the depth of our hearts we acclaim it
A course with no equal on Earth. J. M. S.

“SEA-BATHING DoESN'T suit EVERYBody.”—Medical Opinion.
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. ARNOLD LUNN, in The Harrovians º sets
out to write the school story as so many have done before
him. Any man who was ever a Public School-boy will be
struck by his realism and truth to life, but any man, on
the other hand, who is still a Public School-boy will call
the book “tosh" and will, no doubt, be right. Only a boy
at Harrow could have written a story of Harrow in a
manner likely to appeal to the present generation, and, as
he must have written it in a language unintelligible to the
outer world, the outer world must be content with Mr.
LUNN's record of Peter O'Neil as being the nearest to the
truth that it is likely to get. This Peter must certainly
arouse much interest, but whether he will get sympathy is
another question. Myself, never too tolerant of Radicals
even in later life, found the prevalence of them in a School-
house quite intolerable, and that this most priggish and
aggressive of them should be patted on the back for shirking
his games when a “new man,” and, when raised by his
scholarship to be Head of House, for using every legislative
and executive authority to humble and degrade the “Footer
Bloods” in the presence of the fags, was to me monstrous.
He badly wanted kicking, and, if he still lives, I feel sure
without knowing him that he wants it now more badly than
ever. Mr. LUNN, I gather, is all for the amelioration of the
lot of the small fry, the suppression of brute force and the
triumph of intellect over muscle as well at school as else-
where. Apart from my general belief that we suffer from
too much of the intellectual nowadays, I foresee no good
from the substitution in Public Schools of an aristocracy of
disagree with his opinions, I must give him credit for a
very fair and accurate and felicitous statement of the facts.
Always a timid starter with historical romances, I am
happy to say that my plunge into Before the Dawn (CHAP-
MAN AND HALL) was not half so chilly and caliginous as its
title had led me to fear. All the same, the book needed a
little courage and perseverance, in spite of the fact that
KATHERINE JAMEs, its author, had chosen for her back-
ground one of the most blood-warming episodes possible—
the Garibaldian struggle for a united Italy. I said back-
ground, but as a matter of fact it occupied the best part of the
stage. The interest of that tremendous revolution, of which
the writer has evidently made a most careful study, often
came near to obscuring her fictitious creations, instead of
bringing them out in relief, as a background should. Whole
chapters passed in which these young people were seldom
met with, and not particularly missed. To Philip Sinclair,
for instance, the English hero, I sometimes felt inclined to
say, “Sinclair—er—yes, I think I do remember your
name. Same school—er—m—excuse me, will you? I've
just got to go off and meet GARIBALDI;” and the ramifica-
tions of a plot which was concerned with a concealed will
and a mistaken identity, not to speak of other intrigues,
needed really more time than I was able to spare from the
pressing business of Italian politics and the siege of Rome.
None the less, I was glad to see friend Philip depart safely for
England with Monica Erskine, after they had both jeopar-
dised their lives for the sake of a country not their own.
Philip was a plucky fellow, if a trifle naif and over-credulous.
For he was mistaken surely in supposing that Mr. Punch
sent out a special artist to make funny pictures of the war,

brains for an aristocracy of beef. But, however much I may
and he shocked me severely when he said, reproaching

Mr. Whybrew's Princess (ALSTON Rivers) is one of those
stories that give you their argument in their title—at least
very nearly. I opened it in the confident expectation of a
strong, silent American millionaire, and a distressed Royalty
from one of those states that the rise of Ruritania has
made a little too frequent in fictional geography. As it
turned out, I was practically right, the main difference being
that the hero of Mr. HowARD C. Row E's novel is a north-
country Englishman; but he is just as rich and strong
and successful as the other type, and on the last page he is
left exchanging pet names with the Princess in the same
old way. One novelty is that the lady has in the meantime
ceased to be what one might call a practical princess, her
kingdom having become a republic. Also the villain of the
tale, Demetrios, reigning usurper of Transiola, is perhaps
even more villainously compounded than the generality of
his species. The way he

let me consolidate my faith. I do believe in Mr. CRA1G as
an artist and a reformer; I acknowledge that he has already
done great work; and, if it is the privilege of artists to
become at times a little intoxicated with their inspirations,
then that privilege I, very respectfully, concede him.
Upon first consideration I found The Red Mirage (MILLs
AND BooN) vastly dramatic and moving, but a second and
calmer thought prevents my passing it over without a
captious remark or two. It is eminently a story of the
hero and the heroine, the villain and the minx, and above
all the man of strength, silence and imperturbability. The
complications are infinite and adroitly contrived, and the
Sahara makes a fine background for the clash of arms and
passions involved. The atmosphere is wholly military, only
one civilian intervening to any practical purpose and then
to play the baser part. Army plans are stolen from time
to time, the dishonour and punishment are vicariously
suffered, and for the woman at the bottom of it there is
little need to search. I cannot say how accurate may be
- the representation of
| France's notorious Foreign
Legion, that last resort of
those who have lost every-
thing except the fighting
instinct. But it is very
graphic and plausible, and
it almost escapes one's
notice that this legion,
alleged to consist exclusively
of the dregs of humanity,
exhibits in its members little
else than the most pleasing
qualities of courage and un-
selfish generosity. Upon

for her on the bookstalls.
Towards a New Theatre (DENT) reveals Mr. GoRDON
CRAIG still proceeding in this desirable direction upon the
stepping-stones of his published works. There is this
quality about Mr. CRAIG, that, having said once what he
holds to be the truth, he never hesitates to say it again and
again; and always apparently with the same fine careless
rapture of conviction. Personally, I can only wish that I
believed in his drawings half as much as I enjoy looking at
them. In the present handsome volume forty of them are
reproduced at large. Some of these you may remember,
not long ago, at the Leicester Galleries; others are, to me
at least, new. Anyhow, the art of their creator has here
a fair trial. Art it certainly is; but, from the point of view
of practical stage-craft, upon my word I don't know that
one can say much more for it. I hope that this admission,
regretful as it is, will not make Mr. CRAIG righteously indig-
nant with me; for there are several instances in the book of
persons who have been compelled by their consciences to
object to this or the other design, on the ground that it was
too vague, or lacking in point—and the pages of the letter-
press are, so to speak, strewn with their corpses. Much of
this letter-press is highly amusing, some of it vexatious, as
shown by the way in which
she allows virtue and vice alike to go to such absurd lengths
and by her habit of letting her people analyse aloud both
themselves and each other in such strange phrases and at
such strange times. In making the charge I am myself
involved in it, for that I read the book with unaffected zeal
from cover to cover and never paused to laugh or even smile
at the contrast between it and real life.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOLIDAY HINTS.
THE Paris Correspondent of The
Daily Mail recently contributed to the
columns of that journal a full account
of the recommendations issued by Dr.
F. HELME to mothers leaving home for
seaside or country holidays. These
recommendations, however, are con-
fined entirely to a list of medicines,
including serum for snake-bites, phials
of morphine, etc. It has occurred to
Mr. Punch, always solicitous for the
welfare of the young, to supplement
this imperfect catalogue of
remedies with a number of
useful hints to parents and
guardians for grappling with
holiday emergencies. Or
greater convenience of refer-
ence, these are arranged in
alphabetical order.
ANIMALs, will D, ESCAPED
FROM M E N AG ERIE’s.—The
most satisfactory way of
dealing with this emergency
is to engage a lion-tamer for
the holidays and never allow
any of the young people to
go far afield without him.
In case of a division of the
party there should be one
lion-tamer for each group.
Failing this method, the next
best is summed up in the
rule: Never go for a country |
walk without a red-hot poker.
(The poker can be kept red-
hot in a specially constructed
Vacuum Calidus Case, which
can be purchased at Ram-
jach's.)
BULLs, MAD, MEANs of
sooth.ING. — No affectionate
parent should permit any ex-
cursion to be taken in pastoral
districts without providing at
least one of the party with a
bottle of chloroform or some
other powerful narcotic, in
case of attacks by mad or misanthropic
oxen. Some American millionaires have
gone so far as to retain the services of
an expert Spanish bull-fighter expressly
for the purpose of securing the safety
of their children and friends, but the
cost is prohibitive to most professional
Englishmen. N.B.-The best way of
administering the chloroform is to
drench the bag of a butterfly net and
then put it over the bull's head.
EAGLEs, How To REscue chILDREN
CARRIED off BY.—The eyries of these
birds being as a rule situated in well-
nigh inaccessible places, climbing-irons
are an essential requisite of the holiday
them with a small howitzer. Accurate
aiming is, of course, indispensable, as a
badly discharged bomb might hit the
child but spare its captor. On this
account it is perhaps preferable to lure
the bird away by the bait of some
specially appetising viands, such as
Sºviº, or Bombay Duck, or Lim-
burger Cheese.
GYPSIE8, PRECAUTIONS AGAINST. —
The large increase of the Romany race,
due to the immense spread of the
cult of Borrow, has been attended by

serious results in the way of the kid-
napping of children of wealthy parents
and holding them to ransom. To
guard against such disasters, it is
strongly recommended, (1) that all
children should be marked in indelible
ink with their names and addresses;
(2) that when left by themselves they
should be securely tethered by un-
breakable chains to absolutely im-
movable objects; (3) that where this
is impossible each child should be
provided with a powerful steam whistle
or siren to acquaint its parents as to
its whereabouts.
INsoMNIA, MEANS OF TREATING
highly desirable to include in the holi-
day outfit a harp, or harps, for the
purpose of soothing children to sleep.
Lists of pieces of a specially soporific
character can be obtained from any good
nerve-specialist. These are generally
known as Chlorales, varying in degrees
of intensity.
LIMBS, ARTIFICIAL.-A good supply of
false legs, arms and eyes should always
be laid in to meet the requirements
of adventurous children when holidays
are spent in rocky districts.
MoTo RIs Ts, ENTERTAIN-
MENT FOR YOUTHFUL.—The
irritation so generally felt by
the high-spirited youth at
obstacles to his progress will
be largely allayed if thought-
ful parents provide him with
pea-shooters and air-guns for
the regulation of tiresome
pedestrians, cyclists, poultry,
heep, dogs, etc. A very
retty game can be played
etween the occupants of the
two sides of the car, the
object being to see which
|can score most hits.
NoSE - BLEED, REMEDIES
For. — After all, the best
remedy for this common
summer complaint is the old
device of putting keys down
the patient's back. A bunch
= [of keys should accordingly
be taken for each member
of the party, varying in size
with the age and weight of
the individual.
OiL, FOR Rough PASSAGEs.
—In cases where families are

involve a sea passage in small
steamers, considerate parents

RAILWAY ACCELERATORs. – It is
often found that children who start
away from London in high spirits at
fifty miles an hour on some main line
route become impatient, fretful and
refractory when they exchange this
exhilarating speed for the slow crawl
of a local line. To meet this difficulty
parents will find it helpful to take with
them auxiliary engines to assist loco-

ger train at more than twenty miles an

such time as occasion arises for their
use, and then transferred to the rails.
The cost is extraordinarily small, con-
sidering the result on the temper of the
passengers, averaging only about £100
a journey (exclusive of initial outlay).
SHARK-BITEs, PRECAUTIONS AGAINST.
—Where bathing is indulged in it is as
well to provide juveniles with special
water-wear, made of chain-mail, to
resist the dental attack of these
dangerous mansters. To counteract
the access of weight, it is desirable to
have the chain-mail fitted with unsink-
able aluminium air chambers.

small portable stoves to restore caloric

(A rhyme of lasting value) and
Thought her a charming girl.
Not to embark on detailed praise,
Her voice was low and very sweet;
I liked her looks, her voice, her ways;
Her figure, too, was neat.
Her converse gave me evidence
Of an extremely active mind;
Here is, I said, a girl of sense;
This is indeed a find.
I will not say she took to me
As I to her, lest you should mock;
But it's the solemn fact that we
Got on like one o'clock.
The garments that I chanced to wear
Were new, and fresh as early May;
I luckily had had my hair
Cut on the previous day.
Happening gently to enquire,
She clung, I learned, to rural scenes
(As I do) and her doting sire
And thus she cast on me a spell
So rapid and of such a flame
That I had grown to love her well
Before the coffee came.
And when the ladies left their male
Companions to the wonted smoke,
I did not heed the cheerful tale
Nor chortled at the joke.
The customary talk of man
Just then allured me not at all;
I sat determining a plan
To ask if I might call;
And let my fancy play about
In dreams (ah me!) of wedded bliss,
Which, but for what occurred, no doubt
I had attained ere this.
But, when I saw her next, a blight
Fell on me with a sudden chill;
The maiden stood up to recite:
And I am single still.
DUM-DUM.

THE Missing cARD.
WHAT I say is this: A man has his
own work to do. He slaves at the
office all day, earning a living for those
dependent on him, and when he comes
home he may reasonably expect not to
be bothered with domestic business. I
am sure you will agree with me. And
you would go on to say, would you
not, that, anyhow, the insuring of his
servants might safely be left to his
wife? Of course you would ! Thank
you very much.
I first spoke to Celia about the insur-
ing of the staff some weeks ago. Our
staff consists of Jane Parsons the cook,
the first parlourmaid (Jane) and Parsons
the upper housemaid. We call them
collectively Jane.
“By-the-way,” I said to Celia, “I
suppose Jane is insured all right?”
“I was going to see about it to-
morrow,” said Celia.
I looked at her in surprise. It was
just the sort of thing I might have said
myself. -
“I hope she won't be unkind about
it,” I went on. “If she objects to
paying her share, tell her I am related
| to a solicitor. If she still objects, er—
| tell her we’ll pay it ourselves.”
“I think it will be all right.
Fortunately, she has no head for
figures.”
This was true. Jane is an excellent
cook, and well worth the £75 a year
or whatever it is we pay her; but
arithmetic gives her a headache. When
Celia has finished dividing £75 by
twelve, Jane is in a state of complete
nervous exhaustion, and is only too
thankful to take the nine-and-sixpence
that Celia hands over to her, without
asking any questions. Indeed, any-
thing that the Government wished
deducted from Jane's wages we could
deduct with a minimum of friction—
from income-tax to a dog-licence. A
threepenny insurance would be child's
play.
Three weeks later I said to Celia—
“Has an inspector been to see Jane's
card yet 2" -
“Jane's card?” she asked blankly.
“The insurance card with the pretty
stamps on.”
“No . . .
“You mean
“I was going to see about it to-
morrow,” said Celia. -
I got up and paced the floor.
“Really,” I murmured, “really.” I
tried the various chairs in the room,
and finally went and stood with my
back to the fire-place. In short, I
behaved like a justly incensed master-
of-the-house.
No . . .
Luckily.”
when I was calm again, “if we neglect
this duty which Parliament has laid
upon us?”
“ No.”
“We go to prison. At least, one of
us does. I’m not quite sure which.”
“I hope it's you,” said Celia.
“As a matter of fact I believe it is.
However, we shall know when the
inspector comes round.”
“If it's you,” she went on, “I shall
send you in a file, with which you can
cut through your chains and escape.
It will be concealed in a loaf of bread,
so that your gaolers shan't suspect.”
“Probably I shouldn't suspect either,
until I had bitten on it suddenly. Per-
haps you'd better not bother. It would
be simpler if you got Jane's card
to-morrow instead.”
“I will. That is to say, I'll tell
Jane to get it herself. It's her cinema
evening out.”
Once a week Jane leaves us and
goes to a cinema. Her life is full of
variety.
Ten days elapsed, and then one
evening I said At least I didn't.
Before I could get it out Celia inter-
rupted :
“No, not yet. You see, there's been
a hitch.”
I curbed my anger and spoke calmly.
“What sort of a hitch 2 ”
“Well, Jane forgot last Wednesday,
and I forgot to remind her this Wed-
nesday. But meat Wednesday x -
“Why don't you do it yourself?”
“Well, if you'll tell me what to do
I'll do it.” .
“Well—er—you just—you—I mean
—well, they'll tell you at the post-
office.”
“That's exactly how I keep explain-
ing it to Jane,” said Celia.
I looked at her mournfully.
“What shall we do 2 " I asked. “I
feel quite hopeless about it. It seems
too late now to do anything with Jane.
Let's get a new staff and begin again
properly.”
“Lose Jane?” cried Celia. “I’d
sooner go to prison—I mean I’d sooner
you went to prison. Why can't you be
a man and do something?”
Celia doesn't seem to realise that I
married her with the sole idea of getting
free of all this sort of bother. As it is
I nearly die once a year in the attempt
to fill up my income-tax form. Any
traffic in insurance cards would be
absolutely fatal.
However, something had to be done.
Last week I went into a neighbouring
post-office in order to send a telegram.
The post-office is an annexe of the
grocer's where the sardines come from
on Jane's cinema evening. Having
desperate resolve. I—I myself—would
do something.
“I want,” I said bravely, “an
insurance stamp.”
“Sixpenny or sevenpenny ?” said the
girl, trying to put me off my balance at
the very beginning. -
“What's the difference 2 " I asked.
“You needn't say a penny, because that
is obvious.”
However she had no wish to be
funny.
“Sevenpenny for men-servants, six-
penny for women,” she explained.
I wasn't going to give away our
domestic arrangements to a stranger.
“Three sixpenny and four seven-
penny,” I said casually, flicking the
dust off my shoes with a handkerchief.
“Tut, tut, I was forgetting Thomas,”
I added. “Five sevenpenny.”
I took the stamps home and showered
them on Celia.
“You see,” I said, “it’s not really
difficult.”
“Oh, you angel! What do I do with
them 2 ''
“Stick them on Jane,” I said grandly.
“Dot them about the house. Stamp
your letters with them—I can always
get you plenty more."
“Didn't you get a card, too?”
“N–no. No, I didn't. The fact is,
it's your turn now, Celia. You get the
card.”
“Oh, all right. I–er—suppose you
just ask for a-a card?”
“I suppose so. And—er—choose a
doctor, and—er—decide on an approved
society, and—er—explain why it is you
hadn't got a card before, and—er—
Well, anyhow, it's your turn now,
Celia.”
“It's really still Jane's turn,” said
Celia, “only she's so stupid about it.”
But she turned out to be not so
stupid as we thought. For yesterday
there came a ring at the bell. Feeling
instinctively that it was the inspector,
Celia and I got behind the sofa. . . .
and emerged some minutes later to find
Jane alone in the room.
“Somebody come to see about an
insurance card or something,” she said.
“I said you were both out, and would
he come to-morrow.”
Technically I suppose we were both
out. That is, we were not receiving.
“Thank you, Jane,” I said stiftly. I
turned to Celia. “There you are,” I
said. “To-morrow something must be
done.”
“I always said I'd do it to-morrow,”
said Celia. A. A. M.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GREAT LITERARY SENSATION.
DICKENS AND MRs. HARRIs.
FIND of VALUABLE LETTER.
WIEws of ExPERTs.
IT is Mr. Punch's privilege this week
to throw light for the British public
upon one of the most interesting secret
chapters in the history of our literature.
It will probably come as a surprise,
if not a shock, to our readers, howsoever
versed they may be in the byways of
bookland, to learn that one of the most
famous characters in Martin Chuzzlewit
not only had a prototype in real life
but in CHARLEs DICKENs's youth in-
spired him with the liveliest feelings.
It is common knowledge that
DICKENs was born at Portsmouth.
Whether or not the lady whom after-
wards he described for mankind as Mrs.
Harris was born there too, we cannot
say, nor indeed has research yet yielded
her maiden name; but the irrefragable
fact remains that at some time during
his adolescence the young genius soon
to dazzle the world as “Boz” expressed
the warmest admiration for a mysterious
lady unnamed, and all the evidence goes
to prove that it was she whom later in
life he rendered immortal in the pages
of Martin Chuzzlewit. There is no
direct evidence, but if ever circum-
stantial evidence spoke the truth it
speaks it here.
The letter which has been placed
in our hands is so surrounded with
mystery that we can say little that is
definite; we are not even at liberty to
state from what source it comes. Let
it suffice that we are ourselves satisfied
with the bona fides of the present
owners, who are beyond question the
descendants of Mrs. Harris, although
that is no more their name than it was
hers. DICKENs, the soul of honour and
delicacy, could never have used a real
name; nor shall we. At the most we
may say that the representatives of the
family are now residing in a picturesque
Spanish chateau, and that they have
placed in our hands this document,
hitherto so jealously guarded from the
public eye, to do as we like with.
Before coming to the letter itself let
us consider for a few moments the
character of Mrs. Harris. For one
thing she is never seen. All that we
know of her we know by hearsay. Her
friend, Mrs. Gamp (one of the leading
nurses of her time), testifies to her exist-
ence and her good sense and sympathy,
otherwise we should know nothing.
It is the same in the letter. Even as
a younger woman she still was mys-
terious. DICKENs seems to have treated
her rather as an ideal—shall we say a
Grail?—than as an entity of flesh and
a cºa", tº n -

that he wrote Martin Chuzzlewit, yet
he forgot nothing. Mrs. Harris, as he
then called the object of his early pas-
sion, is still vague, impalpable; but
through the vivid eyes of her friend,
Mrs. Gamp, we see her older, wiser.
The letter is dated April 1, 1828.
DICKENs, it will be remembered, was
born in 1812, and was thus in the
neighbourhood of sixteen—a notoriously
inflammable age.
We should premise that the italics in
it are our own; but were ever phrases
more significant read in the light of
after events? After perusing the letter
the reader will more than ever wonder
how it came to be preserved. Though
they may not be responsible for this,
the heirs of DICKENs are surely its
legal owners.
But here is the precious document:-

the presence of every woman. I do not
even know if you will get this letter,
since if I put no address on it how can
it ever reach you? And how can I put
an address if I do not know one? I do
not even know that you exist at all,
but it relieves my feelings to address
you thus. If ever I can make you
famous trust me to do so. At present
I am all at sea about my future, but
should I at any time take, as I some-
times dream of doing, to fiction, you
may rely upon being one of my dearest
heroines.

men whose opinion on everything is
so valuable, we are in the fortunate
position of being able to print a selection
of their comments.
Sir WILLIAM Robertsos NicoLI,
writes: “Since the BRONti bombshell
fell and proved once and for all that
CHARLOTTE did not invent her Pro-
fessor, there has been nothing so epoch-
making as the discovery of the
Dickens-Harris romance. As an old
student of Martin Chuzzlewit, which I
first read in a corner of the Manse
library at Fecclewonish, near Canter-
bury, in the green monthly parts in
which it was issued, I must confess
that the revelation is no surprise to me,
for there are words in which DickeNs
refers to this romantic lady which
either meant something or nothing.
But I can understand that to the mass
of readers the story will be startling.
The thanks of the whole world are due
to Punch for its enterprise."
Sir CLEMENT SHORTER writes: “Al-
students' discoveries, I must admit to
feeling a flush of excitement as I per-
used this absorbing letter. Probably
no one in either hemisphere has a finer
collection than myself of books relat-
ing to the wizard of Gadshill, which
occupy exactly eighty-three shelves of
the hovel in which I take shelter when
the toils of the day are done.”
Sir GILBERT PARKER writes: “As
one of the most prolific of modern
novelists may I say that the story of
the young DickFNs's infatuation for this
lady is well within the bounds of
credibility. Most youths destined one
day to enthral their fellows by the
magic of the written word would have
to plead guilty to similar periods of
enamourment. I recollect " [Next,
please.-ED.]
Mr. FRANK HARRIs writes: “An
absorbing narrative. . . . But she was,
strange to say, no relation of mine, nor
did I ever interview her.”
Mr. T. P. O'ConnoR, M.P., writes:
beats never found its way to paper. All
our ideas of DICKENs must be revised
by the light of this supreme discovery.”
Mr. HALL CAINE writes: “Weary as
I am from the task of putting forth
another earth-shaking romance, I may,
I trust, be excused from entering
minutely into this matter. It was my
privilege to know DICKENs personally,
and he always struck me as a man in
whose deep recesses in early youth a
fierce fire might have glowed, leaving
behind it such scars and cicatrices as an
unrequited passion is known by masters
of the human heart to cause. I say no
more, except that an analysis of certain
cognate effects of the emotion of love
will be found in my new novel, which
has just succeeded in getting noiselessly
born into a hard world."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PAGES FROM THE DIARY OF
A FLY.
(By our Charitariety Artiste.)
I
BACK in Town again, and, by Jove,
it's good to be there! Feeling some-
what run down, I decided, the other
day, to try the effect of a whiff of
country air. So I flew to Waterloo,
entered an empty first-class carriage—I
did not feel well enough for company—
settled myself comfortably in a corner of
the well-padded seat, and got out at the
first wayside station that took my
fancy. But Town for me; Country's
a rotten hole. . Nothing there but a lot
of stupid scenery and doltish animals.
Too many birds, too, making darts at
you. What their grievance against us
is I don't know. It was different with
a silly sow who snapped at me one day.
There is a saying, “If pigs could fly . . .”
The clumsy brutes can't, of course,
while we flies can pig-see us in a
confectioner's shop—and that's what
makes them jealous.
Taking it all in all, Country is an
unexciting, sleepy place, and I have no
use for it. So, feeling better, except
for a slight sore throat, I boarded a
train again this morning, and here I
am back again in dear old London. I
always travel by rail in spite of its
being a somewhat old-fashioned method
of locomotion—but I am a beggar for
comfort. A fly friend of mine went to
Brighton, the other day, free of expense,
sitting on a motor-car. But he had to
hang on like grim death all the time;
the thing went at such a pace that he
was more than once nearly blown off.
His poor eyes became so inflamed that
he was a sight for days afterwards, and
he caught the cold of his life.
I am staying at Lord Belchester's
mansion in Piccadilly. That is one
advantage that we flies enjoy. All the
best houses are open to us, and we can
leave when we get bored. I fancy I
shall stay here some time, for it is a
well-appointed house with a capital
larder, and the position is convenient,
being near to both St. James's and
Hyde Parks, which are so handy when
one wants a breather.
After a feed in the larder and a rest
on the drawing-room sofa, where I
sprawled at full length for over an hour,
I felt fit for anything. So I sought
out the house-dog, dear old Rover. I
found him trying to get to sleep in
the library. I did the most hazardous
things. I tickled his nozzle, and once
I sailed right through his open mouth,
he snapping his jaws just after I was
the other side of him. Once or twice
the dear old fellow tried strategy. He
into a sound sleep, hoping to catch me
that way, but naturally I saw the one
eye open. Finally I settled on the
lower part of one of the window panes.
He rushed at it, attempted to crush me
with his great fat paw, of course missed
me, but broke the window, cut his paw,
and no doubt later on got a sound
thrashing from his master.
After that I went and plagued a beast
of a yellow cat named Tabby Ochre, who
lay in front of the kitchen fire. This
was perhaps more enjoyable than dog-
baiting, for with a cat there is always
an element of danger, and that makes
it real sport. However, in spite of the
snakiness and celerity of her move-
ments, Tabby Ochre never got me, and
I left her in a deuce of a temper, saying
to myself, “Heaven save the mouse
who comes her way within the next
two hours.”
I think that my country trip must
have done me more good than I
imagined, I feel so well and fit and
frolicsome to-day.
I decided I would now go back and
chaff poor old Rover. So to the library,
where, however, I found much bigger
game. Asleep in a chair, with a book
in his lap—he is a well-known book-
lover—was my lord himself. He had
the most lovely bald head I have ever
hit upon. It is perfectly smooth and
shiny. It is astonishing how bald heads
vary. It is the exception to find one
without a blemish. Some of them are
most miserable objects, absolutely lack-
ing in polish and with unexpected
hillocks springing up here and there.
Lord Belchester has the perfect cranium
one might expect from a man of his
wealth and position. I had Winter
Sports on it—some of the finest skating
and tobogganing that have ever come
my way. My word, but my lord did
get angry! And what amused me was
that he was not a bit more clever at it
than old Rover. I’very now and then
he gave himself a violent slap on the
head with his hand, hoping I would go
pfutt under it, but, of course, I always
saw the hand coming, and he must
have got a sad head-ache. And he
threw his valuable book at me, missing
me but ruining the book. Finally he
rang the bell for his chief flunkey.
“Yes, m'lord?” asked that gloomy
functionary. “ Glanders, kill that
fly,” said his lordship. “Very well,
m"lord,” said Glanders. That made
me feel quite important. I was flat-
tered that this gorgeous and dignified
personage should be told off to have a
game with me, and I gave Glanders
a great time. He fell over a chair,
broke two valuable Chiny vases, and
finally when, out of sheer devilry, I
again, he lost his, and brought a hand
down on my lord's pate with such
force that the pompous ass was dis-
missed on the spot. Then, as the
game was beginning to pall on me, I
flew out of the window, through the
hole Rover had made, roaring with
laughter, into the sunshine.
In the open, as I flew along, I medi-
tated on men and their ways. How
impotent they are ' Size is by no
means everything. Why, these stupid
giants cannot even walk on the ceiling
or crawl up a wall. The smug self-
satisfaction of men amuses me when-
ever I think of it. I really believe they
consider themselves our superiors.
While I was pondering these things
I suddenly heard a voice behind me
cry, “Why, it's Leslie ' How are you,
dear? I haven't seen you for ages.”
I turned round and saw Editha, an old
flame of mine, of whom I had tired
long ago. I looked at her and won-
dered how I could ever have been in
love with her. She had fine eyes, it is
true, but bandy legs, and altogether
she looked a dowd; one of her wings
was actually in holes. “Do go away,
please,” I said, “I don't want to be
interrupted. I am thinking.” With a
sigh she dropped behind. Lord, how
she has lost her looks! And to think
that she was once known as “The
Merry Widow” Poor thing! What
is there about me, I wonder, that
makes me so confoundedly attractive
to the other sex 2 I suppose they like
me because I am such a dare-devil.
Still, it has its advantages. It enables
me to pick and choose, and, if it were
not that these lines may fall into the
hands of the young, I could tell a tale
or two of amours low and high.

THE LAKE.
“OH,” said Francesca, “that hurt.”
“I am sorry,” I said, “I had to slap your face. There
was a horse-fly feeding on your damask cheek.”
“But you needn't have slapped so hard.”
“Yes,” I said, “I need. These Swiss horse-flies are
desperate fellows. A mere handful of them can kill a cow.
Francesca, I would not have you perish in your prime.”
“But why,” she said, “are you stopping again 2 At this
rate we shall never get to Lac Lioson. Come, pull yourself
together. The children are far ahead out of sight.”
“Let them,” I said, “remain out of sight. They have no
families, no husbands, no wives, no five-franc pieces, no
heavy boots, no cares of any kind; and they have Arthur
with them. Arthur is the best of fellows. He will look
after them.”
“Get up,” she said, “and let us press on.”
“No,” I said, “not yet. In two minutes we will resume
our climb. It is the hard-boiled egg that is impeding me.”
“Which one 2'' she said. “You ate three.”
“The second,” I said, “was the largest. I think it is the
second. This will be a lesson to me never to eat more than
the first and third.”
“There,” she said, “Arthur's shouting back. He says it
is just round the corner.”
“I have learnt,” I said, “to distrust Arthur. We have
been climbing these precipitous ascents for more than an
hour, and, according to Arthur, the lake has been round
every corner. You must admit, Francesca, that the corners
have been most deceptive.”
“Are you going,” she said, “to make me ashamed of
having brought out a husband who cannot walk?”
“I will admit,” I said, “that, if you wanted the husband
who would walk to Lac Lioson in record time under a
broiling sun, then you brought the wrong one. The one
you have brought is an enjoyer of scenery, a smoker of
occasional cigarettes, a taker of his ease, a despiser of the
mad rush that is ruining human nature, a man, in fact, who,
having rested, is willing to push on gently.”
“Push along, then,” she said.
“I am not sure,” I said, “that “push’ was quite the
right word.”
“‘Drag,’” she said, “would have been better.”
“No, ‘move' was what I wanted. I will now move on
gently with you.”
“We shall never catch them up,” she said. “They're
miles ahead.”
“There you go, Francesca. Arthur says it is round the
next corner, and you say it is miles away. I refuse to make
any further concessions to this lake. From all I hear it is
not a real lake at all. It is a mere tarn, a silly little sheet
of water up in the mountains. We have plenty of tarns in
England.”
“But you're not in England,” she said. “You’re in
Switzerland, and you've come out with your wife and
family to see Lac Lioson, and if you hadn't sat down and
rested about a hundred times you'd have been there by
now. If only I had been a man—”
“That's just it,” I interrupted. “If you had been a
man you wouldn't have been so set on seeing this lake.
You would have let me rest without worrying me. You
wouldn't have made me carry all the girls' sweaters in case
they should find it cold at the lake. In fact you wouldn't
have wanted to see this ridiculous lake at all. But, being a
woman, of course you're quite different.”
“At any rate,” she said, “this is going to be your last
rest. When once you get off that tree-stump you'll have

Francesca, and get on to the children. You will find my

“I will never,” she said, “desert Mr. Micawber. Up
you get. That's it !”

been denouncing “baby-talk.” “Every bit of the foolish jargon
taught to babies nowadays will have to be unlearned some day,” he
said in a recent lecture. “The average father and mother, instead
of preparing their child for school, instead of establishing a foundation
for education and knowledge, do the very opposite.”]
THERE's a pucker in Frederick's forehead,
There's an ominous look in his eye,
And I fancy he's forming a horrid
And hasty decision to cry;
And it's oh for the syrup that's soothirg
To smother the imminent row—
For the prattle so potent in smoothing
The creases that wrinkle his brow !
But the power that rules over the cradle
Has started a novel crusade:
Henceforth, 'tis determined, a spade 'll
Be plainly described as a spade;
And baby, who'll shortly be burning
To win academical bays,
Shall skip the ordeal of unlearning
The lore of his nursery days.
No longer shall “diddums” and “poppet”
Our Freddie to peacefulness woo;
That language is dead—we're to drop it;
We’ve uttered our ultimate “goo”;
Though our temper he sorely should try by
A fixed disposition to weep,
He'll never be told to “go bye-bye,”
But simply requested to sleep.
In place of those fatuous fables
We lately prescribed for his pain
We'll recite him the multiple tables,
Or a list of the rivers of Spain;
He shall taste in his cot of the pleasures
He's destined at school to enjoy—
The tale of the weights and the measures,
Including the travail of Troy.
When he's cross, we shall bid him remember
The year CoEUR-DE-Lion was crowned,
And how many days hath September,
And how many pence make a pound.
Endowed with these generous riches,
He'll grow a remarkable lad—
Unless, ere he's put into breeches,
His brain-drill has driven him mad.

The Pot of Basil which Mr. BERNARD CAPEs has produced
with the assistance of Messrs. Constable is the sort of
plant which should thrive on idle summer beaches. Perhaps
you will be pleasantly intrigued (as I was) to meet on an
early page and anything more than a hundred and fifty
years ago a brave equipage lumbering up the high road
containing a handsome gentleman in uncustomary suit of
solemn but costly black. Very well then. This is an
Archduke incognito. And lo! at a turn of the pass appears
a vision of delight, apparently just a casual fair maiden of
the place in difficulties about a water-lily, but really the
destined princess, IsabelLA, granddaughter of Louis XV.
of France and daughter of PHILIP, Duke of PARMA. And
of course the Archduke must needs send a deputy to do his
wooing, one Tiretta, an honourable soldier-courtier with a
very pretty light tenor voice and a troubadour's gift of
improvisation, a sort of cross between Charles Wogan and
Paolo. Follows the inevitable tragic consequence, aided by
wretched mischances and very thorough and rather incredible
and insufficiently motived villainy on the one part and an
ingenuous lack of suspicion on the other. Mr. CAPEs is an
accustomed weaver of romances. Perhaps custom has staled
his form a little. I doubt if he would once have thought
that anyone even in the seventeen-sixties would say, “Hark
to that chink, Gaspare! A double silver ducat to line your
old breeches withall ” And I am inclined to wish that he
unhappy authentic ingredients of his romance, for the basil
need have had nothing to do with the case and seemed
forced rather than pleasantly fanciful. But Mr. CAPEs is
nothing if not allusive and one understands his temptation.
The Scarlet Pimpermel, you may be glad to hear, is at it
again. He was, I fancy, too profitable a servitor of the
Baroness ORCzY to be allowed to remain permanently in re-
tirement, however well-earned. His reappearance should be
for everyone's benefit, especially since it shews him engaged
upon such an excellent adventure as that set out in Eldorado
(HoddRR AND Stoughton). This time his objective is the
rescue of the Dauphin. “Could I, or anyone else, doubt for
a moment that sooner or later your romantic hero would
turn his attention to the most pathetic º in the whole
of Europe—the child-martyr in the Temple prison?” asks
one of the characters in an early chapter. Of course not;
no more could the Pimpernel's enormous public. So it is
well that their confidence has been rewarded. No one at
this time of day will be astonished to learn that the mission
is a triumphant success, and the little prince safely smuggled
over the frontier; for your Pimpernel is not the man to be
checked by so trifling an obstacle as historical accuracy.
The future course of events with the child is not indicated.
What is of far more importance is that the tale shows
Sir James Blakeney at his delightful best—witty, debonair,
and so resourceful that even when things look darkest the
reader can rest upon the comfortable assurance that all
will come right in the end. There were moments when,

sorely tried. Still I ought to have guessed that the
bandaged ruffian was really Mr. FRED TERRY--I mean the
Pimpernel—in disguise, because this sort of thing has
happened before. That I didn't is my tribute to a breathless,
improbable and most entertaining story.
There was once, you may remember, a gentleman named
STERNE who wrote a book called A Sentimental Journey.
Since then there have been others of like mind, such (for
example) as STEyENsoN, BELLoc, and plenty more whom I
could mention, but have forgot. The point about these
persons is that they all wrote books of easy-going travel,
and (which is the strange thing) wrote them in very much
the same style. There appears indeed to be a Common
Form in these matters. The latest exponent of it is
Mr. WILLIAM CAINE, whose book The New Foresters
(NISBET) is not only an interesting study for the stylist,
but incidentally as entertaining a record as you could desire
to read. Mr. CAINE, being, as is clearly apparent, of the
example of the compressed and unexpected. There is a
certain movement and fantastic vitality about this writer's
work even when, as in several of the examples collected
in this volume, it is brimful of defects of matter and faults
of style. And vitality is, after all, a better thing than
flawlessness.
“Hundreds of men,” says Mr. S. E. WHITE, in The Land
of Footprints (NELSON), “are better qualified than my-
self to write just this book." I commend his modesty,
and only wish that he had carried it a little further and
refrained from disparaging hunter-authors in general, an
invidious task to which he devotes the first chapter of his
book. But apart from this error of judgment I have only
one fault to find with him, and it is that he refers to his
comrades as B., C. and F. This reticence may have been
obligatory, but all the same I can never pretend to a very
human interest in a man who is cut down to a mere
initial; and when I was told that “B. had not yet killed
stuff of which adventurers are made, has hit upon a bright
his lion, so the shot was his,” I confess that my concern

determined with his wife to
explore only such side tracks
as were impossible to the
Destroyers. To this end,
having secured a small cart
and a moderately reason-
able ass, he started upon a
leisurely tour of the New
Forest, with such results as
are here set down. It is a

about the issue was largely
academic. On the other
hand I found unqualified
virtue elsewhere in Mr.
WHITE's reticence. He has
not revelled in details of
indiscriminate slaughter.

orchard near Minstead (I had to put that in), it will be a
pure delight. I should like to quote from almost every
chapter. What more could one say? Buy it at once.
“Richard DEHAN's" method hardly lends itself to short
story writing. It needs the elbow-room which it (and I)
emphatically enjoyed in Between Two Thieves. The Head-
quarter Recruit (HEINEMANN) is, I am afraid, a sheaf of not
very notably inspired or diverting pot-boilers, and their
author is less concerned with probabilities of situation and
character than any I have the honour to be acquainted
with. The stories set out, for the most part, on a gay
Kiplingesque note of genial allusiveness, but the plausibility
of that adroit model is not at command. Besides, “his
horses, his dogs, his guns, his hunters were discussed and
rediscussed by men at clubs, in Fleet ward-rooms and
garrison mess-rooms; ” “the adjutant said in a tone that
rang like bell-metal;” “the pale translucent hazel eyes of the
young lady flashed violet;" and these things, I imagine, are
no longer done, though they are well-known and convenient
ingredients for the wholesale manufacture of fiction. But
“The Fourth Volume,” the story of the wife who married
on his death-bed the hussar who had broken his back
a-hunting is, strangely enough, as short and as ingenious
bas, but really knows them. If Memba Sasa and Fundi
ever happen to come my way I shall feel that on their
side the ceremony of introduction has already been most
pleasantly performed.
In my experience there are two kinds of satisfaction to be
derived from a good detective story. One is a sense of
triumph when you have spotted the winning clue and find
that you are right; the other a sense of relief following the
solution of a mystery that has left you baffled till the last
page. In The Widow's Necklace (Duckworth) Mr. ERNEST
DAVIEs gives a taste of both kinds. Without claiming any
very deep skill in detection I was able to guess pretty early
in the story how the theft was accomplished, and I felt
continually desirous of kicking the slow official sleuth
because he didn't guess, too. I also had a correct suspicion,
not, I confess, unclouded by one or two incorrect ones, as
to the identity of the thief. But the finish was a complete
surprise to me, and I flatter myself that most of Mr. DAVIES's
readers—and he deserves a good many—will find themselves
in the same position.

THE PATRIARCHAL DRAMA.
THE statement that, at the beginning of Sir HERBERT
BEERBoHM TREE's Biblical play, Jacob (whom our great
histrionic epigrammatist is to impersonate) will be eighty-
six years of age, and at the end one hundred and six, has
caused a flutter in centenarian circles, for hitherto the stage
has paid very little attention to very old men. But, since
every new dramatic departure finds instant imitators, Mr.
CLARKSON has already laid in a large stock of venerable wigs
and beards.
Sir HERBERT's modus operandi for getting age into
him is most interesting. In his charming villeggiatura
he has been busy for some weeks on a monograph of
OLD PARR, which is said to bristle with good things; he
has exchanged his magnificent limousine for a bath-chair;
and his constant companion is a copy of De Senectute. So
great has been his success, at any rate superficial success,
that in the towns he passes through in his quaint conveyance
he is deluged with old-age pensions.
There is no truth in the rumour that Sir HERBERT has

THE NEW INTERVIEWING.
(With acknowledgments to “The Observer.”)
ANxious to glean some information regarding the forth-
coming production at the Novelty Theatre of Mr. G.
Bernshaw's much-canvassed play, The Girl from the Niger,
our representative called upon the famous manager, Mr.
Garville Banker, and put a few leading questions to him.
“Touching The Girl from the Niger–" began our inter-
viewer in an inviting tone.
“Who's touching her?” inquired Mr. Banker.
“—may I ask whether it is intended to give a realistic
stage-picture of the West African interior 2"
“You may,” was the encouraging reply.
“Of course the popular legend may provide the substance
of the story, or it may merely be treated in an allegorical
fashion ?” it was suggested.
“There are those alternatives,” said Mr. Banker.
“And I suppose you do not intend to introduce a
tiger on the stage?”
“Do you?”
“If an allegorical treatment is adopted it is possible
that the tiger may be designed to represent the retribution
that follows upon the prevailing feminine follies of the
age 2" insinuated our representative.
“The word “possible’ covers every eventuality that
may present itself to the imagination,” replied the talented
ampresario. -
“Do you think that an author should produce his own
plays, or that a professional producer should be universally
employed 2" was the next question. -
“I don't think,” replied Mr. Banker.
“Does Mr. Bernshaw agree with your revolutionary
stage methods?” -
“I’m afraid we shall have some rain after all,” said Mr.
Banker, rising and peering anxiously out of the window.
“I presume—”
“Quite so, you do.”
“And one would like to know how many scenes there
will be, and who are to act in the play, and whether the
incidental music will be of Nigerian origin 2"
At this stage of the interview, however, Mr. Banker
lapsed into a contemplative silence, first toying with some
papers, then looking at his watch, and finally ringing the
bell. Concluding that little further information was to be
obtained in this quarter and hearing a heavy footstep on
the stairs, our representative took his departure.
But to one who has known what it is to interview an
actor-manager like Sir HERBERT TREE about a forthcoming
production and to revel in the fine, free, generous manner
in which he keeps nothing back which he feels the public

A untie. “IF IT 's WHAT I THINK IT. Is, I DoN'T.” -
ONCE UPON A TIME.
“ EAST, WEST, HAME 's BEST.”
ONCE upon a time there was a little
girl who was taken to the Zoo by her
father. Her father's tastes were wholly
scientific; he paid five guineas a year
for the privilege of forgetting to give
| away Sunday tickets; he could add
F.Z.S. to his name if he liked; and
when he went in he asked for a pen,
instead of paying a shilling like inferior
folk. But the little girl was curiously
unmoved by the world's strange fauna,
whether elephants or snakes, and the
result was that she followed listlessly
and fatigued at her father's heels
throughout the expedition, while with
eager eyes he scrutinised this odd
creature and that, from the very post-
impressionist mandril by the Circle
gate even to the distant and incredible
camelopards.
The little girl, I say, was listless and
fatigued—with the exception of two
moments. For it chanced that as they
walked in solemn procession through
the house of the ostriches and the
emus and various cassowaries, each of
whom is named after his discoverer,
the little girl, loitering at his bars,
uttered a gasp of delight, for there,
all unconcerned and greedy, sat a tiny
English mouse, eating grain.
It looked at her with its brilliant
eyes, and nibbled as though there were
only two minutes of all time left for
refreshment; and, secure in the know-
ledge of the dividing bars, it refused
even to blink when she flicked her hand
at it. She never saw the Patagonian
Cavy at all.
“What is it 2 What is it 2 ” her
father impatiently inquired.
“Hush,” she said. “Do come back
and look at this darling little mouse.”
“Pooh-a mouse,” said her father,
and so strode on, eager to reach the
elusive apertyx. But not yet could he
do so, for at the very next compartment,
after she had dragged herself all un-
willing from this one, the little girl
stopped again, and again was absorbed,
not however in contemplation of the
Red-bellied Wallaby which resided
there and had been brought at great
expense many thousands of miles from
Australia for her benefit, but of the half-
dozen London sparrows which fought
and scrambled and gourmandized in
“Well,” said her mother when the
little girl returned, “and what did you
see that pleased you best ?” and the
little girl mentioned the mouse and the
sparrows, but chiefly the mouse.
And what of the mouse? “You
may call yourself a Patagonian Cavy,”
he remarked later in the evening, “but
it doesn't follow that you're everybody.
Did you notice a little girl with a blue
bonnet this afternoon 2 Just after tea-
time? The one that called her father
back to have another look? Well,
being a poor benighted Patagonian, you
don't, of course, know what she said,
but it wasn't what you think it was,
oh dear no. What she said was, “Do
come back and look at this darling little
mouse,” which merely,” the mouse
concluded, “again illustrates an old
contention of mine that the familiar
can often give points to the startling."
“The last general election appears to have
been in October, 1910. The Constitution pro-

a normal state of things exist, they ought to

course, be pleaded, with some plausibility,
that the condition is not normal.”—Times.

PAGES FROM THE DIARY OF
A FLY.

II.
WHEN Editha fell behind I was able
to resume my meditations on humanity.
I repeat it: I really believe these men
consider themselves our superiors. I
have often tried to think why. Possibly
it is because they are so proud of
having learnt to walk on their hind
legs for a longer time at a stretch than
other animals. Still, when all is said
and done, that is but a cir-º-
cus trick. And how petty
are these giants, and how
cruel ! Their hatred of us
is born in them ; it comes
out in their young; and it
is thanks to a little brute
of a boy of seven, who
actually tried to kill me
dead, that I have only three
legs. -
There are some who hold
that men are more humane
than they used to be. It is
just possible, though I find
it difficult to realise. It is
true, though, that I remem-
ber my maternal grand-
mother telling me one day
that, when she was a young
girl, it was a common sight
to see monsters walking
about the streets selling
things called Fly-papers,
diabolical contrivances
covered with some sticky
substance which were so
many death traps for us.
One would see hundreds
of flies on them either dead
or in their death agonies.
It was a gruesome sight

she suffered cruelly from .
rheumatism, and one day, when she
was dragging her poor tired limbs
laboriously across the road, a horrid
motor-car, which did not even blow its
horn, went clean over her.
Well, well, I pondered, these are
gloomy thoughts for so fine a day, and
I resolved to put them from me. Just
then I met a pal named Percy, and we
decided to go for a ride in the Row.
So we made our way thither, and each
mounted a horse and had the most
glorious gallop. It did our livers no
end of good. My gee tried to throw

and beneath these words was what I
at first took to be a lifelike portrait of
myself. I almost fainted with fright.
I immediately thought of Lord Bel-

lack of respect for him, had
he, I wondered, caused Lon-

on, photographed with—William Bales,

modestly refuse to take any credit for
the gallant rescue. As his holiday had

William was at odds with the world.
He was a romantic young man who
had once been told that he nearly
looked like LEwis WALLER when he
frowned, and he had resolved that his
holiday this year should be a very
dashing affair indeed. He had chosen

it did not do him justice.
“So you said before,” remarked Miss
Spratt. - .
“Well, it 's still true.”

pier. There was an old gentleman

limit) and a bunch of seaweed. William
felt that here was a wasted life; a life,
however, which a sudden kick and a
heroic rescue by W. Bales might yet
do something to justify. At the
Paddington Baths, a month ago, he
had won a plate-diving competition;
and though there is a difference between
diving for plates and diving for old
gentlemen he was prepared to waive it.
One kick and then . . . . Fame ! And,
not only Fame, but the admiration of
Angelina Spratt.
It was perhaps as well for the old
gentleman — who was really quite
worthy, and an hour later caught a full-
sized whiting—that Miss Spratt spoke
at this moment.
“Well, you're good company, I must
say,” she observed to William.
“It’s so hot,” said William.
“You can't say I asked to come
here.” -
“Let's go on the beach,” said
William desperately. “We can find a
shady cave or something.” Fate was
against him; there was to be no rescu
that day. -
“I'm sure I'm agreeable,” said Miss
Spratt. -
They walked in silence along the

cliffs, they came presently to a cave.
In earlier days W. Bales could have
done desperate deeds against smugglers
there, with Miss Spratt looking on.
Alas for this unromantic age It was
now a place for picnics, and a crumpled
sheet of newspaper on the sand showed
that there had been one there that
very afternoon.
They sat in a corner of the cave, out
of the sun, out of sight of the sea, and
William prepared to renew his efforts
as a conversationalist. In the hope of
collecting a few ideas as to what the
London clubs were talking about he
picked up the discarded newspaper, and
saw with disgust that it was the local
Herald. But just as he threw it down,
a line in it caught his eye and remained
in his mind— -
“High tide to-day–3.30.”
William's heart leapt. He looked
at his watch; it was 2.30. In one
hour the waves would be dashing re-
morselessly into the cave, would be
leaping up the cliff, what time he and
Miss Spratt—
Suppose they were caught by the
tide. . . . .
Meanwhile the lady, despairing of
entertainment, had removed her hat.
“Really,” she said, “I’m that
sleepy I suppose the tide's safe,
Mr. Bales 2 ”
It was William's chance.
“Quite, quite safe,” he said earnestly.
“It's going down hard.”
“Well then, I almost think * >
She closed her eyes. “Wake me up
when you've thought of something
really funny, Mr. Bales.”
William was left alone with Romance.
He went out of the cave and looked
round. The sea was still some way
out, but it came up quickly on this
coast. In an hour . . . in an hour. . .
He scanned the cliffs, and saw the
ledge whither he would drag her. She
would cling to him crying, calling him
her rescuer. . . .
What should he do then 2 Should
he leave her and swim for help? Or
should he scale the mighty cliff 2
He returned to the cave and, gazing
romantically at the sleeping Miss
Spratt, conjured up the scene. It
would go like this, he thought.
Miss Spratt (wakened by the spray
dashing over her face). Oh, Mr. Bales
We're cut off by the tidel Save me !
W. Bales (lightly). Tut-tut, there's
no danger. It's nothing. (Aside)

around his neck). William, save me; I
cannot swim
W. Bales (looking like Waller). Trust
round the point and obtain help. (Aside)
An Englishman can only die once.
Miss Spratt. Don't leave me!
W. Bales. Fear not, sweetheart.
See, there is a ledge where you will be
beyond the reach of the hungry tide.
I will carry you thither in my arms and
will then—
At this point in his day-dream
William took another look at the
sleeping Miss Spratt, felt his biceps
doubtfully, and went on—
W. Bales. I will help you to climb
thither, and will then swim for help.
Miss Spratt. My hero!
Again and again William reviewed
the scene to himself. It was perfect.
His photograph would be in the papers;
Miss Spratt would worship him; he
would be a hero in his City office. The
actual danger was slight, for at the
worst she could shelter in the far end
of the cave; but he would not let her
know this. He would do the thing
heroically—drag her to the ledge on
the cliff, and then swim round the
point to obtain help.
The thought struck him that he could
conduct the scene better in his shirt
sleeves. He removed his coat, and then
went out of the cave to reconnoitre the
ledge. -
Miss Spratt awoke with a start and
looked at her watch. It was 4.15.
The cave was empty save for a
crumpled page of newspaper. She
glanced at this idly and saw that it
was the local Herald . . . six days old.

TWO OF A TRADE.
THE moment Charles Meredith
entered our Temple flat, just after we
had finished our lunch, I knew that he
was in trouble and meant to carry it off
lightly. His face gave him away to
those who, like myself, knew him well.
Knowing, moreover, my Marjorie's
fatal gift of spotting my unconfessed
wickednesses, and her deadly habit of
not allowing me to carry them off
lightly, having also suffered much from
odious comparisons between myself and
this same Charles Meredith, I looked
forward to a pleasant ten minutes or so.
But I ought to have known that I am
never very far out of trouble myself
when Marjorie and trouble are about.
“I have come up to apologise to you,
Mrs. Shelley,” said he.
I waved a kindly hand at him.
“Don’t mention it,” I said airily; “all
is forgiven.”
Marjorie said she would endorse this
view, if she knew what the trouble was.
I begged Charles, as being the only
person who did know, to tell her.
After some hesitation, Charles began :
“The fact is that a long, long time ago
an uncle and aunt of mine fixed this
week-end for their annual visit.”
and aunts,” said I, “it seems that you
are entitled to the apologies.”
“We dare not put them off,” said
Charles, “and we have only one spare-
room.”
I had suddenly the instinctive feeling
of having not done something which I
ought to have done. Was it possible
that Charles had given me a message
for my wife which my wife had never
received? My worst fears were realized
when Charles proceeded to inform us
that his wife bitterly regretted having
to put us off. “Let us,” I said hastily
to Charles, remembering now exactly
what the message was that I had
omitted to deliver—“let us go back to
our respective chambers and resume
our work. It is high time, very high
time, that we were forgetting our
respective wives and devoting the
whole of our great minds to the affairs
of others.”
Marjorie got between me and the
door. “Put us off what ?” she asked.
“Didn't he tell you?” asked Charles,
pointing an accusing finger at me.
I interrupted. “If you ask me . . .”
Marjorie interrupted. “I was asking
Mr. Meredith. Yes, Mr. Meredith ?”
“If you ask me,” I continued, “he
probably didn't, but he will do so now.
despatched to you, which got lost in
transit. It was to the effect that the
Merediths would be delighted if we
would spend the week-end in their
Surrey home. The week in question
would have started ending to-morrow,
I believe. But now, since the uncle
and aunt have unhappily intervened,
shall we disperse without referring
again to the melancholy affair?”
“Really, John,” Marjorie began (I
suffer more from “really” than from
any other word in the dictionary). And
then to Charles, “Why, I ought to
have written to Mrs. Meredith days ago
to thank her for asking us, for of course
we should have loved to come. Of
course it doesn't matter a bit about
putting us off, and it was awfully kind of
you both to have thought of asking us.
But what does worry me is what she
will think . . . really, John.”
“What, again?” I said. But Mar-
jorie's face had now assumed the
familiar I-wish-I-had-married-some-
body-else expression.
“But that doesn't matter in the
least,” said Charles, with great hearti-
neSS.
“But it does matter,” said Marjorie,
with so much more that Charles's
bosom obviously burst with pride in

was the cleverest I have ever made in
my life. “Marjorie,” it ran, “you'll

Charles waved the suggestion airily

though we be, have met as bitter op-

he is in a hole and is trying to jump

“I shall most certainly write to Mrs.

“however incredibly monstrous the
explanation may sound.” -
The arrogance of Charles collapsed.
“I beg of you, as a favour to myself,”
he pleaded, “to do no such thing.”

If ever there was a time when

here presented. As Sir Edward pointed
out, up to outbreak of war in Balkans
last October, there had been universal
expectation that it would be the signal
for a clash of arms among the Great
Powers. Some would be unable to
keep out of it, and if one or more were
brought in it was impossible to say
how many others would follow. That
calamity, threatening the greatest war
since the days of NAPoleon, has been
averted. By common consent the

to know. Here seascape and landscape

which is which. Surely there is signifi-

concert parties, three bands, and a scenic
railway; and leave intending visitors to
judge for themselves. I should, how-
ever, add that on the morning after
last August Bank-Holiday no fewer
than seventy-five cases of alleged
inebriation were the subject of judicial
enquiry, many of them being accom-
panied by disorderly conduct. And yet
they say that the English take their
pleasures sadly. Not at Slushville!

HAPPY MoMENTS AT TRIPTON.
By the Deputy-Mayor of Tripton.
The only objection that I can see to
urging intending competitors for your
Million Pound Happy Moments to seek
them at Tripton is that it is so unfair to
all the others. It is impossible to be
anything else but happy at Tripton.
Why, we have a town-crier who is
enough to make a cat laugh. Why
“picturesque” bits they abound. What
about the old fish-market (or, to avoid
misunderstanding, I should rather say
the old market for fish)? Nor will
lovers of the artistic willingly neglect
such a spectacle as Sunset on the
Tram-terminus. So I extend a hearty
welcome to all and sundry. Even
should you fail—which is unlikely—
to secure the million, you will at least
have spent a happy time (and I hope
much else) at entrancing Tripton.
John BRowN,
Deputy-Mayor of Tripton.
HAPPY MoMENTS AT SANDBoRough.
By the Chairman Sandborough Council.
Salubrious Sandborough is so well
known as the chief health and pleasure
resort in the British Isles that any
attempt on my part to enlarge upon its
many advantages in a competition such
as the one that you are so generously
instituting would only be to gild the
already refined lily. Passing by, there-
fore, such adjuncts to true happiness
as our covey of Arabian donkeys (un-
equalled on the coast for speed and
comfort); our bathing beach, where at
high-water mixed bathing (or neat if
preferred) may be enjoyed with absolute
safety, the depth never exceeding twelve
inches; and our casino, boasting the
papers to be found in Great Britain, I
would draw attention to the important
fact that, if true happiness is to be found
in health, then Sandborough offers both.
For the past twelve months our death-
rate has been 1 per population, that
one being the local undertaker, who
died of starvation. Need I say more?
Remember the old phrase, “As happy
as a Sand(borough)-boy.” Come then
to Sandborough, and win the prize.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FRIENDLY WAITRESS.
Saturday, August 9th.-Arrived quite safely this after-
noon at Les Vallons, which is really one of the most beau-
tiful places in Switzerland. A grand view of valley and
mountains. Our hotel stands high and commands the best
of the scenery. Mary and Dorothy have become members
of the Tennis Club. Little Cynthia and Dick are, of course,
too young, but there is plenty of amusement for them in
other ways. In fact this is an ideal place for children, and
Edith and I are sure to have an easy time in looking after
them. There are several Russian and French families in
our hotel, all very stout and jolly-looking. We seemed
quite sylph-like in comparison with them. Curious how
foreigners nowadays run to fat. We all dined at the table
d'hôte in the evening. We were looked after by the head
waitress, who insisted on our taking a helping of every
course. She is extremely friendly and seemed hurt by the
mere idea of our refusing anything. It was a long dinner,
and the leg of mutton struck me as unnecessary after what
we had already eaten. Children a little flushed, especially
Cynthia. - .
Tuesday, August 12th.-At the table d'hôte luncheon
to-day, the two top buttons of little Dick's shorts gave way
with a loud report. Under the influence of our waitress he
had worked his way steadily through all the courses of the
luncheon, which had included chicken patties and Irish
stew and cauliflower d la crème. At the moment he was
engaged upon caramel pudding. The waitress was highly
pleased. She said he was increasing in weight d vue d'oeil,
which, indeed, is true of all of us. Mary and Dorothy not
so keen on their lawn-tennis as I should like. Edith's
skirts refuse to meet round the waist, and I myself am in
great trouble with my flannel trousers. Perhaps they have
shrunk in the wash. The waitress continues to urge us on
at every meal and we dare not offend her. Where will
this end ?
Thursday, August 14th.-Had intended to make a walking
excursion into the mountains to-day, but when the time for
starting came could not move family. Though it was only
10.30 in the morning they were all asleep in the drawing-
room. The Russian and French families prefer the smoking-
room. The Russian snore has a very penetrating bass note.
I cannot say I was displeased at the postponement of our
walk, for the mere idea of exercise under a hot sun was
most repulsive. Instead of exhausting ourselves by climbing
steep ascents we all sat and watched the tennis tournament.
Coming up hill afterwards to our hotel, Dick and Cynthia
fell down, and before we could stop them they had rolled
fifty yards to the bottom of the slope, where they lay, unable
to get up, till the English chaplain, who was passing, set
them on their legs and started them up-hill again. Edith
and I felt inclined to cry with vexation, but what could we
do? We could only sit still on a wall and hope for the
safety of our children. Mary and Dorothy told me after-
wards that they simply couldn't have gone down to the
rescue with the prospect of having to toil up again. We
hope this will be a lesson to Cynthia and Dick, but, like all
children, they are thoughtless. At dinner to-night three of
the buttons of my dress-waistcoat suddenly flew off, and ||
one of them hit a French General on the forelead. He was
much offended and said he had not the habitude to receive
blows of buttons on the face without demanding an explana-
tion. Mollified him with some difficulty. The misfortune
was entirely due to a poulet chasseur au riz which I had
intended to pass, but was not allowed to by our waitress.
Saturday, August 16th.-As a family we have put on eight
stone since we came here. Am afraid this is not necessarily
wearing apparel has had to be let out everywhere. Have
arranged to leave on Monday for home. Thank heaven,
only two more table d'hôte dinners. Our faces are all cheek.
If we could only have hunger-struck all would have been
well, but the amiability of the waitress made it impossible.
Wonder if the dogs will recognise us when we get home.
THE KING witH A SENSE of HUMOUR.
(A Fable for Parents and Guardians.)
LoNg years ago, in Puritania's realm,
A learned King stood firmly at the helm ;
A man of blameless and industrious life,
Devoted to his exemplary wife, :
A model father, generous and just,
In whom his subjects placed implicit trust.
And yet this paragon had two small flaws:
He was a slave to Logic's ruthless laws,
And owned a gift of humour far intenser
Than that of J. S. MILL or HERBERT SPENCER.
Yet all went well until that fatal year -
When, as the last days of July drew near,
At Puritania's greatest public school,
Where all her noble sons are taught to rule
Her subject races, of all hues and sizes,
The King arranged to give away the prizes.
The sun shone kindly from a cloudless sky,
And rank and fashion loyally stood by
As, guided by the Reverend Head, the King
Inspected practically everything;
And then, proceeding to the College hall,
Amid the cordial cheers of great and small,
Rewarded with gilt-edged and calf-bound tomes
The scions of his kingdom's stately homes.
Then as the last prize-winner sought his seat
The King, whose voice though guttural was sweet,
Addressed the boys, who checked their loyal din
Till you might hear the dropping of a pin.
He said it gave him pure and genuine joy
To watch the progress of the human boy,
Especially when every one was yearning
To beat his neighbour in the race of learning.
“I gather,” he continued, “from your Head
That you are all contented and well-fed;
That in these placid groves of Academe
Your life slips by like some celestial dream;
That, scorning luxury and slothful ways,
You lead harmonious and laborious days,
And never taste of bitter in your cup
Save at your periodic breakings-up.
Therefore, because your ardent courage falls
When you are exiled to your fathers' halls,
I have prevailed upon your worthy Head,
In recognition of the lives you've led,
To grant a boon as welcome as unilue
And lengthen term-time by an extra week.”
::: ::: -- a ::: ::: :::
Within three days the monarch's blameless life
Was ended by a young assassin's knife.
Yet there are British parents, I am told,
Who his audacious sentiments uphold,
Who mourn in secret his untimely doom
And offer furtive tribute at his tomb.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-So many of my
City acquaintances whom I have con-
sulted at lunch or in the train about
my new house have said, “You ought
to have an architect,” that I feel the
enclosed diary is of public interest.
Anyhow, it answers the objections
raised to my project of designing the
house myself. -
I enclose my card and am
Yours faithfully,
BALBUs.
June 9.—Feel this project of build-
ing myself a house biggest event in
my life. Am resolved to keep diary.
Sophronia says, “Mind you do keep it.”
I will. Architect calls himself Benson
Benson Friba. Odd name; but Sir
George Bilger, who recommended him,
writes that he is “the coming man.”
June 10.-Not much done. Did
not know architect's address except
that it was Gray's Inn Square, so
asked man with broom in Square
where Benson Friba's office was. Man
asked, “Is he a harshtect 2 " Have
taken liking to word. At entry of
house indicated by man found name
F.R.I.B.A. (i.e. “Fellow of the Royal
Institute of British Harshtects").
Sir George apparently thought “Friba"
a title of rank similar to Pasha. Found
my way slowly up to top floor, where
Benson nests in rookery of Fribas.
Some confusion as four names distri-
buted among three doors but identified
my harshtect's door at last and knocked.
Benson's office boy sits at a desk,
looks out of windows and taps for a
living with a pencil. He went to inner
door, came back, asked me to take seat
and resumed his tapping. Studied
framed picture titled “Proposed house
for F. Cheese, Esqr.,” and discovered
that bicycle accident in road was really
nursemaid with perambulator talking to
Arabian dwarf with turban and naked
scimitar. Bell rings and I am shown
into Benson's room. There are two
dusty silk hats on top of cupboard,
violoncello case and golf clubs in
corner, and Gladstone bag in middle of
floor. Benson Friba was in shooting
clothes. Nervous manner; pulls his
fingers and says, “I see, I see,” but does
seem to understand. Told him what we
wanted — i.e., library, drawing-room,
Brodie's patent self-cleansing lavatory
to larder window to keep out flies,
entrance hall with alcove at side for
billiard table (full size), study, boudoir,
squash racquet court at back and
scraper at entrance firmly fixed because
ours wobbled about and the man who
came to mend it did not do it properly.
Dining-room, of course, and kitchen, etc.
Friba listens nervously; says, “I see,
I see,” and then asks, “What style?"
“A thoroughly good style of house,”
I tell him. He means, however, what
style of architecture. “What building
do I particularly admire?" he asks.
“Westminster Abbey,” I tell him.
“I see.”
Friba then pensive; finally he says,
“The sort of house you want is a
Pseudo-neo-Grec house.”
“Do I?’”
“Yes.”
“Oh, all right.”
“Yes, you would like it.”
“Would I?”
“Yes.”
“Right; but don't forget the scraper
and the fly gauze.”
Friba makes note on blotting pad
and asks how much I expect to spend.

“Five thousand.”
“I see.”
When I told Friba we wanted French
windows to drawing-room he became
dejected. Says, “Then it can't be
Pseudo-neo-Grec.” He explains this at
great length. Seems to know what he
is talking about. I tell him “All right,
never mind the French windows, but
we want a big bay-window to library.”
“You won't like that,” he says.
“Why not?"
“Well, for one thing it isn't Pseudo-
! neo-Grec.”
He again explains at length.
dently he is right.
“Well, never mind the bay-window,
but we are very fond of oak beams and
carved gables,” I tell him.
“I am afraid that is out of the
question,” says Friba.
“Why?”
“Because it isn't Pseudo-neo-Grec.”
It struck me Friba was coming it a
bit strong, but he clearly showed me
we did not like beams and carved gables,
but only thought we liked them.
“All right; leave 'em out.”
My harshtect waxes enthusiastic as
we discuss the house. Says he will send
rough sketches and then we can talk
over details. Bid him good-bye. Then
go back, put my head in at the door
and say, “Lots of cupboards, please.”
Dxpect to hear “Pseudo-neo,” &c., but
Friba (who for some reason has begun
to undress) agrees at once. Good chap,
Friba. Have not told Sophronia about
windows and oak timbers. Shall make
most of cupboards.
July 16.—Sketches came by second
post. Fine-looking house, but very
strong and unpleasant smell. Don't
understand plans yet. Cannot find any
scraper. Only one cupboard.
July 18.—Have solved plans at last.
Triba has drawn them upside down.
No scraper, though ; and can't see fly
gauze. Sophronia discovered three
more cupboards, then had to give up
owing to smell of paper. No conserva-
tory, no racquet court, no verandah.
Can't understand. Billiard-alcove only
fourteen feet square. We cannot make
out what thing like starfish in kitchen
yard is. No linen-room. Have written
Friba asking why no verandah or con-
servatory or racquet court.
August 13.—No reply from Friba.
Hear he is in Scotland. Have written
asking estimate of cost. Sophronia
has discovercd another cupboard.
Starfish proves to be pattern of
paving.

A DEBT OF HONOUR.
By her unhappy machinations my
sister-in-law has landed me in hot
water again, and I am in need of
advice. For if, on the one hand . . .
but perhaps I had better first give you
the facts and then you can judge for
yourselves.
One Sunday in April I was sitting
in her drawing-room waiting for her
to offer me some tea. For the last
twenty minutes I had been throwing
out hints, which passed, however, un-
heeded. Frances does talk so.
“This morning,” she said, breaking
out afresh after a momentary lull, “this
morning I saw—what do you think?”
“A man holding a mug,” I suggested
hopefully.
“No. Down in the waterside meadow
I saw a swallow. Aren't you glad it's
the spring again 2"
“Are you sure it wasn't a labourer
making a noise that looked like a
swallow 2 " I asked, with grave mis-
givings. “Spring doesn't really begin,
you know, till I’ve ordered my fancy
vests.”
“My dear boy, where is your nose?
Can't you smell that it's spring in the
air, in the earth, in the trees—every-
where 2 ”
I took a sniff, just to humour her.
“I can only smell the spring-clean-
ing,” I said, “and it always upsets
me.”
I sighed and went on with my thirst.
“Now that spring is upon us once
more,” she persisted in the voice of one
with a mission, “there's something
I've been wanting to speak to you
about.”
She paused. I cast my mind hurriedly
back over the interval since last I had
seen her. What had I been doing
now 2
“It's this,” she said impressively:
“it’s quite time you thought seriously
of settling down. Everybody says so.”
“Don't move. I'm very comfort-
able, thanks.”
“You know very well what I mean.
Think how nice it would be,” she went
on in mellifluous tones, “to have
someone always to love and protect,
someone to welcome you at night and
talk to you when you're lonely.”
I thought about it.
“I don't see much in it,” I said.
“Nothing has been fixed up definitely,
I hope—not for a day or two 2"
“Don’t be so absurd . "
“Upon my word, I don't know,” I
replied. “Since you all seem to have
made up your minds about it. Produce
the bride, then. Where is she? Why
keep her skulking in the background 2
Frances gave a mysterious smile
which annoyed me.
“Please understand,” I pursued, with
some heat, “I’m not going to get
married for anyone, unless I like. And
at present I don't like. . Besides,
I can't afford it,” I added a little too
hastily.
“What? With—why you're not in
debt again already ?”
“Er—technically—you see,” I pro-
ceeded to explain, “it’s the buttons.
They keep on coming off. And so—
what happens x -
“How much do you owe your tailor
this time?” She eyed me severely as
she spoke. My mind never works
really well when people stare at me,
and my memory is not what it was.
“I f-forget for the moment. But I
dare say I could find out for you.”
“And I suppose there's a lot more
besides 2"
“Er—now you come to mention it,”
I began.
“I thought so. Then it's certainly
time you had someone to look after
you,” she announced with decision.
“That's not what you said just
now, you know. You promised me
that I was going to have the looking
after somebody. That's not fair.”
“I shall see about it at once.”
“Give me till tea-time,” I pleaded;
“I’m very thirsty.”
“Now I know the very girl for you.
She's pretty, has a nice disposition,
and is easily pleased.”
“I ask you for tea,” I complained,
“and you give me a wife. Why is
there all this delay ? What are we
waiting for 2 It seems to me this
house isn't properly managed.”
“You must get to know one another.
I think you'd make a very good
couple.”
“I should only tread on her toes,”
I urged.
“Well, you shouldn't be so clumsy,”
she replied. -
I sat up suddenly and gave Frances
a piece of my mind; and there's more
where that came from.
“I’m not clumsy. On the contrary,
I'm said to be exceedingly graceful.
If the truth were known, I believe you
tell them to put their feet under mine
on purpose so as to give them a
secret hold over me. I'm not clumsy.
Clumsy " " and I laughed with a hollow
mirth. -
“Her name is Gwendolen,” said
Frances, “Gwendolen Hope. Pretty
name !”
“A very nice name,” I agreed.
“I’m glad you like it, because
“I like it so much,” I put in
pleasantly, “that it seems a pity to
teen thousand.”

Is nothing ready for me?”

“Because,” she continued, rising and
ringing for tea, “just now I heard a
knock at the door. I have asked her
to tea, and I think here she is. Now"
mind you behave yourself!”
So that was why . . . . I jumped
up in alarm, preparing for flight, but it
was already too late. The door opened
and the bride-elect was shown in. She
might easily have been worse; in fact
she was really rather pretty. She wore
a white serge tailor-made frock, well-
shaped shoes, and brown silk stockings,
which I like. Yes, she might very well
have been worse. But in choosing a
wife, especially the first, one has to be
careful. And yet, dear friends, so in-
scrutable are the workings of destiny
that, be as careful as you may, things
have a way of turning out otherwise, in
spite of every precaution. Being an
actual eye-witness, I will try to explain
to you exactly what happened. What
happened was this. You know those
cups they have nowadays, those sense-
less, precarious things with no balance
to speak of 2 Well, I was handing her
her third. I was taking particular
pains over it, for I knew that Frances'
eye was upon me. Another inch and
I was practically there. And just then
(to this day I cannot sufficiently ac-
count for it) something (I don't know
what it was) suddenly gave way
the muscles of my arm. For one
awful moment . . . . “I’ve done it,”
I whispered, turning bloodlessly to
Frances. “Look!” and I pointed to
Gwendolen's lap.
If the good creature had only had
the presence of mind to sit still ! A
girl at all handy with her needle could
easily have let in a new piece, and
nobody would have been any the wiser,
excepting ourselves. But no. Rising
quickly and without thought she spread
it. And, whereas a small concentrated
pool would have represented all the
mischief done, many tributaries of tea
flowed down to the floor in every
direction, and the skirt was to all in-
tents spoilt. I did what I could. I
gave her my handkerchief and a spoon,
and knelt down to point out the worst
places. But unless she is not very
particular, which I doubt, she will never
want to wear it again. It is such a
mistake, I do think, for mothers to
allow young and inexperienced girls to
wear white, especially white serge.
Frances was obliged to lend her a cloak
to go home in.
And now the question remains, what
is the correct thing to do? According
to Frances, having gone thus far and
compromised myself, I must go further.
The dictates of honour, she says, com-
pel me to offer to buy the young person
an intolerable liberty unless I first
asked her hand in marriage. And I
am bound to admit there is something

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Nothing about Mr. HALL CAINE's latest novel impresses
me quite so much as its ruthlessness, the ineluctable vigour
of its advance. He is a bloodhound on the trail of pathos,
stretches octopus tentacles of coincidence, out of the pigeon-
holes of memory plucks like a hawk every topic of recent
interest, from the story of Marie Claire to the foibles of the
| Smart Set, from the Minority Report on the Divorce Com-
| mission to the discovery of the South Pole, and sweeps them
| all onwards to the great and final thrill. Mary O'Neill,
: the heroine of The Woman Thou Gavest Me (HEINEMANN),
educated in a convent, was forced into a marriage of
“suitability” with the dissolute profligate Lord Raa (situate
on the Isle of Ellan, wherever that may be), refused to be
his wife in more than name, was humiliated because he
flaunted his mistresses in her face, found no sympathy from
Church, relations, or law in her struggle for freedom, and at
last, just before he sailed for Antarctic parts, gave herself
to her life-long lover, Martin
possession of which she is, like the rest of us, inwardly
conscious. So doing, she affords Mrs. CHANNoN the oppor-
tunity of knocking the bottom out of all the nonsense which
is current with respect to the Writing and publishing of
novels, and the real position is nicely summed up, with a
simple directness and many sly touches of humour, as
between the publishers and the authors, the point being
that if there are some knaves amongst the former there is a
much larger proportion of fools among the latter. In the
title, moreover, we have a double entente; there is another
profession, more conventional but no less honourable, open
to Miss King. Men who still believe in real women, and
real women who still believe in themselves, must find in the
conclusion of this pretty story an element of peace and
quiet very welcome in these sexless days. To those to
whom I dare not, for reasons above given, recommend the
draught as a thirst-quencher, I advise it with some con-
fidence as a soothing medicine of a most pleasing nature.
HAVE you ever encountered one of those depressing little
Conrad. When she found
that she was to become a
mother she fled to London,
suffered, starved, and in order
to keep the child alive was
just about to earn the wages
of infamy on the night when
Martin (whose ship was re-
ported lost) arrived in Lon-
don. “‘Yes, the very next
man who comes along,' I
thought.” The next man was
Martin. . . . The elements
and supernatural omens are
pressed with equal relentless-
ness into the awful march.

of divorce, a “vast concourse

volumes published in the
early part of the last century
(and still to be met with on
second-handbookstalls, or the
topmost shelves of circulating
libraries) called usually by
some such title as “Irish Wit

it would be unkind to suggest
too close an analogy between
these and Knockinscreen Days

must confess that Mr. JACKSON
C. CLARK's book did remind
me of them more than a little.
The trouble, I take it, for all
writers of Irish studies is that,
the Irish being accepted as a
race of comedians, some show
of Wit and Humour has to be
somehow got into all anec-
dotes about them. On the

Poor bird.
With regard to Miss King's Profession (MILLS AND Boon),
I am in the same position as if I had come across an
excellent brew of home-made lemonade, a liquor which,
| however good of its kind, I should hesitate to press upon a
stranger of whose taste in drinks I had no knowledge.
There are those who neither have nor desire to form
acquaintance with such a mild beverage. Myself, though
no literary teetotaler, I found the book most refreshing.
Mrs. FRANCIS CHANNoN writes of schoolgirls and primarily
for schoolgirls; in her ingenuous and innocent plot virtue
of the more homely sort triumphs all the way. But if the
tale is not intoxicating it is by no means flavourless; the
career of Miss King, so far as it consists of Work with her
Pen (always capitalized), is most lively and cannot but
prove amusing and instructive to all who Write, have
Written, or mean to Write. This young lady, having dis-
tinguished herself at school by composing essays elegant in
style and agreeable in sentiment, settles down with serious
purpose and at regular hours to develop that talent, of the
(reproducing one of four
There are a hundred-and-sixteen chapters in The excellent drawings to be found within) which presents a
gentleman in a farmyard being knocked down by the rush
of several pigs, while a small boy flourishes a blackthorn
in the distance. This is very typical of the ground of my
complaint. I could have been far more entertained with
the doings of Mr. CLARK's characters had they been less
obviously out for laughs at all cost. As it is, his pictures
of life in an Ulster village have at least a topical interest;
more especially in such examples as that which describes
the celebration of St. Patrick's Day in a Protestant neigh-
bourhood, and what came of it. As for Jimmy McGaw,
however, whom the publishers describe as “a manservant
with original ideas,” I can only regret that I found his
originality too farcical to be amusing. This was my mis-
fortune and not my fault. It is ill dogmatizing about
humour. Very possibly other readers may be more happy:
so I will leave it at that.
Financial Candour.
From a circular:-
“Quite a good number of our customers have taken advantage of
this gilt-edged investment, which we can with every confidence recom-
mend as a stock for those who wish their money placed so they will
have no further trouble with regard to either the principal or interest."

[AUGUST 27, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SPREADING WALNUT-TREE.
WE were having breakfast in the
garden with the wasps, and Peter was
enlarging on the beauties of the country
round his new week-end cottage.
“Then there's Hilderton,” he said;
“that's a lovely little village, I'm told.
We might explore it to-morrow.”
Celia woke up suddenly. -
“Is Hilderton near here?” she asked
in surprise. “But I often stayed there
when I was a child.”
“This was years ago, when Edward
the Seventh was on the throne,” I
explained to Mrs. Peter. -
“My grandfather,” went on Celia,
“lived at Hilderton Hall.”
There was an impressive silence.
“You see the sort of people you're
entertaining,” I said airily to Peter.
“My wife's grandfather lived at Hilder-
ton Hall.
spoken about this before. It would
have done us a lot of good in Society.”
I pushed my plate away. “I can't go
on eating bacon after this. Where are
the peaches”
“I should love to see it again.”
“If I'd had my rights,” I said, “I
should be living there now. I must
put my solicitor on to this. There's
been foul play somewhere.” .
Peter looked up from one of the
maps which, being new to the country,
he carries with him.
“I can't find Hilderton Hall here,”
he said. “It's six inches to the mile,
so it ought to be marked.”
“Celia, our grandfather's name is
being aspersed. Let us look into this.”
We crowded round the map and
studied it anxiously. Hilderton was
there, and Hilderton House, but no
Hilderton Hall. -
“But it's a great big place,” protested
Celia. -
“I see what it is,” I said regretfully.
“Celia, you were young then.”
“Ton.”
“Ten. And naturally it seemed big
to you, just as Yarrow seemed big to
WoRDsworth, and a shilling seems a
lot to a baby. But really by
“Really,” said Peter, “it was semi-
detached.”
“And your side was called Hilderton
Hall and the other side Hilderton
Castle.”
“I don’t believe it was even called
Hilderton Hall,” said Peter. “It was
Hilderton Villa.”
“I don't believe she ever had a
grandfather at all,” said Mrs. Peter.
“She must have had a grandfather,”
I pointed out. “But I'm afraid he
never lived at Hilderton Hall. This
is a great blow to me, and I shall now
Celia, you should have ||
I drew my plate back and Peter
returned his map to his pocket.
“You’re all very funny,” said Celia,
“but I know it was Hilderton Hall.
I've a good mind to take you there
this morning and show it to you.”
“Do,” said Peter and I eagerly.
“It’s a great big place 3.2
“That's what we're coming to see,”
I reminded her. ..
“Of course they may have sold some
of the land, or—I mean, I know when
I used to stay there it was a-a great
big place. I can't promise that it 2 x
“It’s no good now, Celia,” I said
sternly. “You shouldn't have boasted.”
Hilderton was four miles off, and we
began to approach it—Celia palpably
nervous—at about twelve o'clock that
morning.
“Are you recognising any of this?”
asked Peter. -
“N-no. You see I was only about
eight x -
“You must recognise the church,”
I said, pointing to it. “If you don't,
it proves either that you never lived at
Hilderton or that you never sang in the
choir. I don't know which thought
is the more distressing. Now what
about this place? Is this it?”
Celia peered up the drive.
“N-no; at least I don't remember
it. I know there was a walnut-tree in
front of the house,” … ."
“Is that all you remember?”
“Well, I was only about six—'
Peter and I both had a slight cough
at the same time. , -
... “It's nothing,” said Peter, finding
Celia's indignant eye upon him. “Let's
- - º
go on.” -
We found two more big houses, but
Celia, a little doubtfully, rejected them
both.
“My grandfather-in-law was very
hard to please,” I apologised to Peter.
“He passed over place after place
before he finally fixed on Hilderton
Hall. Either the heronry wasn't
ventilated properly, or the decoy ponds
had the wrong kind of mud, or 91
There was a sudden cry from Celia.
“This is it,” she said. -
She stood at the entrance to a long
drive. A few chimneys could be seen
in the distance. On either side of the
gates was a high wall.
“I don't see the walnut-tree,” I said.
“Of course not, because you can't
see the front of the house. But I feel
certain that this is the place.”
“We want more proof than that,”
said Peter. “We must go in and find
the walnut-tree.”
“We can't all wander into another
man's grounds looking for walnut-trees,”
I said, “with no better excuse than that
asked down here for the week-end and
stayed for a fortnight. We –”
“My grandfather,” said Celia coldly,
“lived here.” . . .
“Well, whatever it was,” I said,
“we must invent a proper reason.
Peter, you might pretend you've come
to inspect the gas-meter or the milk
or something. Or perhaps Celia had
better disguise herself as a Suffragette
and say that she's come to borrow a
box of matches. Anyhow, one of us
must get to the front of the house to
search for this walnut-tree.”
“It-it seems rather cheek,” said
Celia doubtfully.
“We'll toss up who goes.”
We tossed, and of course I lost. I
went up the drive nervously. At the
first turn I decided to be an insurance-
inspector, at the next a scout-master,
but, as I approached the front door, I
thought of a very simple excuse. I
rang the bell under the eyes of several
people at lunch and looked about
eagerly for the walnut-tree.
There was none.
“Does Mr.—er—Erasmus—er—Per-
cival live here 2 " I asked the footman.
“No, Sir,” he said–luckily.
“Ah ! Was there ever a walnut—I
mean was there ever a Mr. Percival
who lived here? Ah Thank you,”
and I sped down the drive again.
“Well?” said Celia eagerly.
“Mr. Percival doesn't live there.”
“Whoever's Mr. Percival?”
“Oh, I forgot; you don't know him.
Friends,” I added solemnly, “I regret
to tell you there is no walnut-tree.”
“I am not surprised,” said Peter.
The walk home was a silent one.
For the rest of the day Celia was
thoughtful. But at the end of dinner
s to brightened up a little and joined
in the conversation.
“At Hilderton Hall,” she said sud-
denly, “we always * x
“H'r’m,” I said, clearing my throat
loudly. “Peter, pass Celia the wal-
nuts.”
::: :: * : :: :
I have had great fun in London this
week with the walnut joke, though
Celia says she is getting tired of it.
But I had a letter from Peter to-day
which ended like this:—
“By the way, I was an ass last
week. I took you to Banfield in mis-
take for Hilderton. I went to Hilderton
yesterday and found Hilderton Hall–
a large place with a walnut-tree. It 's
a little way out of the village, and is
marked big on the next section of the
map to the one we were looking at.
You might tell Celia.”
True, I might . . .

“Sir, the conduct of Ministers,
degraded, corrupt and incompetent as
it is in all spheres, is peculiarly base in
the domain of sport. We see foreigners
unchecked, untaxed, subsidised by their
respective Governments, enter our
competitions and carry off our treasured

to continue. I put aside with contempt
the fallacy that we regain the value of

emphatically that unless foreign com-

Derby. When the turf was nationalised
I predicted that corruption would creep
in even with the sport of kings. This
year there chanced to be an Italian
runner for the Derby. It was fairly
obvious that Ministers wished it to
win. They could not hide their love
for the foreigner. I state with regret
that the CHANCELLOR of THE Ex-
CHEQUER and the ATTorn EY-GENERAL
received racing tips from the trainer of
this foreign horse. The trainer was
the ATToRNEY - GENERAL's brother.
And I may say that if there is any in-
tention of promoting the right honour-
able gentleman to the important post
of Judge on the Government race-
courses”—(The Chairman: “Order,
order. That question hardly arises on
this vote.”)—“in any case this tip

now I must explain. I have made no
fortune. I am a poor man. The horse
ran thirteenth. And, to show that I
was not actuated by motives of personal
gain, let me state publicly that I have
not yet paid the bookmaker.” Loud
Ministerial cheers.)
“I am content to leave it at that.
We see the highest legal authority of
the Crown accepting racing tips. We
see England's CHANCELLOR of THE
ExchequER, who should be the acutest
financier of the country, squandering
his money on ‘also rans.’ Would Mr.
GLADSTONE have done that?”—(Oppo-
sition shouts of “Never.”)—“Would
even the present PREMIER, enemy of the
Empire as he is, deliberately use his
position to back also rans'? I doubt
it. Would he, if he had made a specu-

“GENTLEMEN, THE DRAMA!”
A MEETING of dramatists to consider
Mr. CYRII, MAUDE's suggestion that
play-writing should be systematically
taught in schools has just been held
in the operating theatre at Guy's
Hospital. Mr. WALKLEY was in the
Chair, and he was supported by some of
including Mr. MAx PEM-
BERTON, the Revue King.
Mr. MAUD E was also
present.
In his opening re-
marks Mr. WALKLEY said
that his own opinion was
that everything that the
budding dramatist need
know was contained in
the Poetics of ARISTOTLE.
(Groans.) The misery
of gentlemen present, he
added, did not alter the
fact. He was born lisp-
ing ARISTOTLE's name,
and if ever he died, which
was unlikely, no doubt
it would be with ARIs-
ToTLE's name on his lips.

wholly owing to the absence of Mr.
MAUDE's scheme of instruction. Hence-
forward he saw no reason why any
play should fail. It was not as if
personality counted, as in other forms
of art, or as if a sense of life was neces-
sary. (Cheers and counter-cheers.)
Mr. GRAN ville BARKER denied that
the writing of real plays could be
taught. Only genius, he held, could
produce plays sufficiently true and drab
to empty the theatre; which was, he
said, the aim of all conscientious crafts-
men. Mere entertainments no doubt
could be knocked up, but not first-class
plays of the order indicated. (At this
moment a painful sensation was caused
by Mr. Shaw's sorrowfully leaving the
room.)

agreed with every word that Mr.
MAUDE had said. Play-writing could
be taught and should be taught—in
fact, he had done something to teach it
himself, as readers of his “How to do

in The English Review, would remember.
All that was needed was a clear-headed
expository instructor, an apt pupil,
paper, pen and ink. If they had a few

Sir ARTHUR PINERo paralysed the
company by asking in what way his

had he attended a class for dramatists.

and sarcastic triumph.

hours on any play, however masterly.
(Sensation.) The idea of teaching play-
writing was only one degree more ab-
surd than teaching cricket. (Oh! Oh!)
Sir JAMEs BARRIE wished Mr. MAUDE's
project every success. Nothing could
be easier, he held, than to teach suc-
cessful play-writing. In Mr. MAUDE's
words the pupils “would have exercises
in dialogue, and would be taught con-
ciseness, crispness, and how to make
points. Then they would learn the
construction of a play, openings, cur-
tains, and all the vital matters which
spell the difference between failure and
success.” Well, Sir JAMEs asked, what
could be simpler than that? Crispness
and point were, of course, at any one's
service, and the circumstance that so
somewhat fatigued from his efforts in
dramatising the Old Testament and
satisfying Mr. BRookEIELD with his
tact and discretion, offered to teach
play-writing to any pupil in six months
—“provided he had the mind.” (Mr.
CYRII, MAUDE : “I forgot that.")
Mr. GALsworthy agreed that play-
writing could be preceded by much
useful learning; but it was not the
learning of the schools but of the hard
grey world. Coal mines, factories,
prisons, mean streets—these were the
proper training-ground of the drama-
tist. (Cries of Help!)
Mr. CECII, RALEIGH urged that Mr.
GALsworth Y had omitted the best

PAGES FROM THE DIARY OF
A FLY.
(By our Charivariety Artiste.)
III.
My narrow escape from a watery
grave brought on another fit of nerves,
and I quietly left the room and crawled
upstairs and lay down on the library
sofa again. Is it, I wonder, an un-
lucky house? There are such things.
I may leave to-morrow.
What a deal of tragedy there is in a
fly's life, if one comes to think of it.
Few of us—only, I should say, an
infinitesimally small proportion—die in
our beds. Death is always lurking at
our elbow. For example, each winter
hundreds of thousands of us—all, in
fact, who cannot manage to get to the
Riviera—perish of cold. Something, I
cannot help thinking, might be done to
prevent this appalling mortality. I
have seen moths, for instance, in expen-
sive fur coats. If they can do it, we
ought to be able to do it. But it is
rather of the sudden deaths—the violent
ends—that I was thinking. Take my
own family. I have already mentioned
the cases of my poor mother and
her mother before her. My paternal
grandfather, when asleep in an arm-
chair, was sat upon by a man weighing
eighteen stone. My brothers and sisters,
Frank, George, Mary, Daphne, Joyce,
Patience and Iris, when mere young-
sters, were all trapped in treacle, and
my father perished in an heroic attempt
to rescue them. A spider got my dear
sister Ermyntrude, and birds ran off
with Dulcie, Clarence, and Stephen.
Guy—powerful fellow though he was—
had his spine broken by a horse's hoof.
Marmaduke was pulled to pieces before
his mother's eyes by a brat of a boy.
Then there was the case of Reginald.
Reginald was our black sheep, and con-
sequently his mother's favourite. He
took to drink. It was perhaps scarcely
his fault. He was egged on by others.
It began in a small way. Out of curi-
osity he looked into a public-house one
day. Some men there gave him a drop
of beer. Apparently it amused them to
see him intoxicated; the thought of it
is sufficiently humiliating. The liking
for strong drink grew upon Reg., and
he became a public-house loafer. He
would even steal beer. One day—pos-
sibly he was under the influence—he
missed his footing on the inside wall
of a tankard, fell into a half of bitter,
and—it is almost too gruesome to tell—
was swallowed by a bricklayer—with-
out even enjoying the wasp's satis-
faction of stinging the fellow as he went
down. He left 51 widows and 3,071
children; for Reginald, in spite of his
some and taking fellow. By a mere
chance the tragedy was witnessed by a
friend of ours who happened to be on
the bar counter at the time, and he
gave us a full account of the affair—
including a description of the coughing,
spluttering, and swearing of the dirty
toper who became, so to say, the grave
and monument of my poor brother. It
nearly killed my mother, and made
teetotalers of such of us as had hitherto
been in the habit of taking a drop now
and then.
Another of my family perished
through over-eating. My half-sister
Geraldine had the good fortune, as she
thought, one afternoon, to be the only
fly imprisoned under the muslin cover
over the cakes in the window of a con-
fectioner's shop. It was the oppor-
tunity of a lifetime, and Geraldine
made the most of it. But it was her
undoing. She gorged and gorged and
gorged. Then suddenly she felt a rush
of blood to the head, there was a loud
report, and then no more Geraldine.
Thus does misfortune dog our foot-
steps. And what about the “mysterious
disappearances " ? There have been
hundreds of these in our family. Some
few may possibly be explained by
elopements, but the great majority
point to a violent end. Not always,
though. An old friend of mine—I had
known her in her maiden days—lost|
one of her youngsters. Again he was
the black sheep and the favourite—I
don't pretend to understand these
things—and the mother wore her-
self to a skeleton searching for
him. One day, just as she was think-
ing she must give up the quest as
hopeless, she spotted the young gentle-
man in a butcher's shop. “My dearest,
dearest pet !” she cried as she rushed
towards him. “Hulloa, Mother; fancy
meeting you !” said the callous young
beast, licking his chops and scarcely
looking up. That is your modern young
fly! He left home, he had the good taste
to tell the old lady, because he found it
dull there and the restrictions irksome,
and it was only with the greatest diffi-
culty, and after a promise had been given
that nothing should be said if he came
in late at nights, that Master Archibald
was persuaded to return home !
Still, that was an exceptional in-
stance. The mysterious disappearances
which are so common with us are too
horrible to contemplate . . . .
There is a question which I often
think about. What becomes of us
after death 2 Some say currants, and
there is an end of us. I don't believe
this. I believe we become angels—for
we can fly. I wonder . . . .
In the act of wondering I fell asleep.

“No ; isn't that purfectly lovely 2
Such true British taciturnity. Dear,

To the lavender man Sadie proceeded
to explain: “We want a record of that
lovely old cry of yours. We're from
the other side; but we know all about
lavender; how it's grown at a place
called Mitcham, and all you lavender
men live there in a sort of little settle-
ment to yourselves, just as your fathers
and grandfathers did before you; and
you've learned the dear old chant from
generation to generation, your father
teaching it to you and his father teach-
ing it to him, and so on way back till
it's enough to give anyone brain fever
to think of it! It's a purſectly purfectly
sweet notion' And the fact that you
don't answer anything I say to you is
just right—shows what a true, genuine
British lavender man you must be.”
“‘Fine capacity for silence,' to quote
fechan, Scotland, and Chelsea, London,”
ut in “Pop.”
“Well, now,” went on Sadie, “that's
what we want of you—a record of this
splendid old chant, that's come down
from father to son through the cen-
turies. You'll come to the Savoy Hotel,
Strand, and sing it good and hard into
a phonograph—and you might add a
few particulars of the life at the
Mitcham lavender settlement and how
far back you can trace your descent
from the original old lavender men,
and we'd give you seven dollars—or,
say a pound and a haf, British money.
Take it or leave it.”
“'Scuse me, lidy,” interrupted an
expert in bottles and bones, who had
stopped pushing his barrow in order to
listen, and now drew up, “but it ain't

“‘Guess this vurry man's ancestors

hearkened to it before ever they thought

quoted “Pop" musingly, as the taxi
sped away again on its suburb-sampling
mission. “Another illusion knocked
out, baby-child . "
“Don’t rub it in, Pop!” pleaded
Sadie; and then, with a sudden move-
ment, she threw all her recently-pur-
chased lavender into the road. “Perish-

charm and intelligence the precocious

the relief-humour was of the thinnest.
Mr. FRED KERR, as Grimshaw, did

Mr. and Mrs. Ross and their particular
friend, Mr. Grimshaw, were on a shoot-
ing trip in Central Africa. One fine
day a rhino charged the first-named.
The native who was carrying his rifle
threw it away and fled. Mr. Grimshaw
at once discharged his piece at the
monster, and at the same moment Mr.
Ross ran across the line of fire and
intercepted the bullet. Mr. Grimshaw,
having received his friend's dying con-
fidences, married the widow, and
gave out for convenience that the
deceased had perished of fever. His
conscience was quite clear as to the
accidental nature of Ross's death, and
fortunately the lady, who witnessed
the episode, was in a position to sup-
port his view.
All, then, might have gone moderately
well in the home circle but for the fact
that the extinct sportsman had left be-

his step-father and reports him at home
as a base deceiver leading a double life.
Grimshaw, persistently noble, declines
to clear himself at the cost of his dead
friend's honour—always a good line
for heroes of the stage. But the family
doctor, who knows all and is sensible
enough to recognise that a living lion
is worth any number of dead dogs,
gives the secret away.
It is patent that every step which
the boy takes to expose what he
imagines to be his step-father's baseness
and duplicity only brings him nearer
to the loss of his own ideal. Like

he has much to learn in voice and

(With grateful acknowledgments to the Parliamentary Repre-
sentative of “The Daily Chronicle,” the lines that
follow being little more than a metrical version of the
subjoined passages from his Review of the Session.)
[“The Liberal party has had its ups and downs in the past Session,
and on a few occasions it was confronted with very embarrassing, not
to say perilous, situations. From all of them, under the cool and
skilful guidance of the Prime Minister, it emerged not only without
discredit, but with added strength—indeed, fortified and purified by
the discipline of adverse circumstances. . . . . . Mr. Asquith has
mastered the secret of getting profit for his Ministry out of circum-
stances of peril. . . . Mr. Asquith is an Englishman to his finger-
tips. Yet this typical Englishman has succeeded in winning the
unqualified devotion of the Irish Nationalists. At the banquet given
to the Prime Minister by Mr. Redmond, the warm-hearted Irishmen
were almost swept off their feet by a thrilling passage in Mr. Asquith's
speech in which he acknowledged his gratitude to “my Irish com-
rades.' . . . Next to the Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George has
bulked largest on the Parliamentary stage. His daring and supple
genius has been of inestimable value to the Liberal party. He was
winged for a time by the wretched tracasseries of the Marconi affair,
but quickly recovered.” -
After noting Mr. LLoyd GEORGE’s “apostolic fervour” for social
reform, the writer goes on to describe Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL's
“param on oil fuel" as a remarkable performance, enlarges on the
exceptional humanity of Mr. McKENNA, the “flowering out" of
Mr. MASTERMAN into a first-class Parliamentarian, and the all-round
competency of Sir John S1MoN, “who shines with equal lustre in the
House of Commons and at the Courts.” In a previous issue he dilates
on Mr. T. P. O'Connor's championship of the small nationalities,
especially the Armenians.]
WE Liberals in the twelve-month past have had our ups
and downs;
We basked awhile in Fortune's smile, and wilted 'neath
her frowns;
Yet, though this arduous discipline our grit has sorely
tried,
We've issued from the ordeal completely purified.
Our wonderful PRIME MINISTER full-throatedly we bless
For turning to our profit each Ministerial mess;
He pilots us through perilous seas, where surging billows
boil,
But hitherto has never lost his little can of oil.
Besides, he has no maggots in his massive English brain;
He's free from thrills and Celtic frills, he's sturdy and he's
Sane ; -
Yet when he called the Irishmen at REDMoND's festive
board
“My comrades,” from O'CoNNor's eyes the teardrops
freely poured—
O'Connor, ceaseless eulogist of all that's chic and smart;
Who takes the poor Armenians to his all-embracing heart;
Whose loving human kindness, saponaceous and serene,
Reaches the lactic level of the richest margarine.
Next to our priceless PREMIER, I must essay to paint
The superh' man virtues of our Cambrian super-Saint;
Who joins the lion's daring to the slither of the eel,
With his “apostolical fervour" and his Athanasian zeal.
Immune from all the weaknesses that hamper common
Dukes,
He thrives upon exposure and he battens on rebukes;
And, the deeper that he flounders in the mud of ill renown,
The more insistently he claims to wear the martyr's crown.
Next comes the only WINston, whose exuberance is such
That we cannot eulogize it or disparage it too much;
His Marconi exhibition was magnificent, of course,
Still, after GEORGE and Asquith, he's quite our brightest
jewel,
And we all admired his memorable “pacan on oil fuel,”
Whose far reverberations cheered Lord MURRAY of Peru
On his journey from Bolivia to the wilds of Timbuctoo.
Of the admirable RUFUs 'tis perhaps enough to say,
As a man and as a brother, that he's perfect in his way.
While MASTERMAN, whose unction is exuded with such tact,
Is quite the shoving leopard of the great Insurance Act.
Though SIMON's not so simple as his surname might sug-
est,
And the way the Tories praise him stirs misgiving in my
breast,
Though he scorns to bluff and bluster or indulge in cheap
retorts,
Still “he shines with equal lustre in the Commons and the
Courts.” -
The facetiousness of BIRRELL is alone worth twice his
screw;
And a dilatory magic gilds the utterance of CREwe ;
JoHN BURNs's self-assurance is unshattered up till now,
And HALDANE still can perorate the hind-leg off a cow.
Last comes the mild McKENNA, so tremendously humane,
That to stamp upon a beetle gives him agonising pain,
And with such a noble passion for veracity imbued .
That he beats the best achievements of an amateur like
Froud E.
In fine, however sketchily the Liberal artist paints
The variegated progress of his heroes and his saints,
He cannot fail to recognise that, though severely tried,
Their spiritual nature has been wholly purified.

“This,” said Francesca, “is your excursion, and I refuse
to bear any responsibility for its consequences.”
“Consequences !” I said. “What consequences can
there be?”
“I have already,” she said, “got a blister on my right
foot, and my throat is choked with dust.”
“I admit that, in a sense, these are consequences, but I
am bound to point out that you must bear them yourself.
I cannot change feet or throats with you.”
“I don't want you to,” she said with dignity; “but why
have we hired a carriage?”
“We have ordered a carriage,” I said, “in order that it
might precede us as we ascend these steep Swiss roads. It
makes a dust; but what of that 2 It is a comfort to know

“For all the good we've had out of it, it might just as
well not have been there,” she said. “Two hours have
gone by since we started and we have not been in it for
more than ten minutes.”
“And that is due to the kindness of our hearts. We cannot
bear to inflict unnecessary suffering on the horses.”
“Then we should have left them in the stables.”
“No, for then we should not have had the beautiful
consciousness of self-sacrifice. It is for the sake of the
horses that your foot is blistered and your throat parched.
Let this thought console you as you limp through the dust.”
“But you,” she said, “have no such consolations; and
that is what annoys me.”

“Then there's the coachman,” she said. “Why doesn't
he get off his box and walk sometimes?”
“He is a fat coachman,” I said, “and, once on the box-
seat, he prefers to stay there. Though I am myself a slim
man, I can understand his preference. Perhaps his doctors
have told him that carriage exercise is good for him.”
“In that case he ought to pay us thirty francs instead of
our paying him.”
“I will mention it to him,” I said, “if you like; but I
do not think he will look favourably on the suggestion.

“What I am asking myself,” said Francesca, “is why
we came out on this excursion at all.”
“We came,” I said, “to see a glacier.”
“Pooh 1” she said. “What is a glacier?”
“A glacier,” I said, “is a sea of ice." That is to say, it is
not the sort of ice that you know. It is made of snow.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE. . . .
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Used though I am, more particularly in novels, to those
who do, or talk of doing, Big Things, I have never before
met so large and mixed a company devoted to this vocation.
There is no doubt, of course, that the class of which Sir
GILBERT PARKER writes in The Judgment House (METHUEN)
did much, if not most, of the bringing about and carrying
through of the Boer War, but I cannot think that the
Magnates of the Rand or the Officials of Diplomacy set
about the business in quite the large, direct and melo-
dramatic spirit of Rudyard Bing and Ian Stafford. They
must have given some thought to details; some trifles must
have obtruded themselves upon their notice, causing them
to show impatience or irritability, to laugh or at least smile;
even at such a crisis the tension of the situation and the
facial muscles of those who conducted it must have relaxed
a little once or twice in a period of some years. On this
part of the affair I speak without authority, not knowing
by the light of nature, nor having been told with any exact-
sent a wire saying they must part for ever, becomes even
tedious. Yet Mr. CYRII, HARcourt has written an engaging
fantasy, which, though it never convinced me, has many
delightful moments. In other words, Mr. HARcount the
plot-inventor will probably owe the success of his book
entirely to Mr. HARcourt the dainty stylist. Heavily
treated, his theme would have been intolerable.
I read The Power Behind (HUTCHINsoN), by M. P. WILL-
CoCRs, with deep interest, as a novel quite out of the
common run. Much of it I have since read a second and a
third time, partly from delight in its many beauties of style
and diction and descriptive power, and its thoughtful analysis
of life, and partly with the wish to get a clearer understanding
of its author's design. In the second of these aims I con-
fess to have fallen short of success. The girl who is the
chief figure is brought into close relationship with three
men. She was adopted first of all by an old West Country
doctor and naturalist, who in his youth had been the loved
but rejected lover of her French grandmother. Then she
was secretly married by a masterful young astronomer, who
ness in the book, how
Magnates are created or
of what Diplomacy (always
with a big, big D) consists.
The social and criminal
elements of the story are,
however, open to the criti-
cism of the man in the
street. As to the former, I
would arguethat the smart
and plutocratic set of
London is herein credited
with a brilliance and
breadth of mind not its
own; as to the latter, that

disillusionment into her

All this is straightforward
enough, and is worked out

made of it. But the important thing for his many
admirers is that Sir GILBERT has written another novel;
and nothing that I have said can alter that fact. At the
worst, I shall only expect a few of them to agree with me
that, while his book is by no means wanting in wit, it would
have been much better for a touch or two of humour.
I think I have seldom met with a more obvious example
of the short story masquerading as a novel than The World's
Daughter (LANE). The first two parts of the tale, which
take one hundred and sixty-five pages to tell, are all about
the events of one day. True, it was an extremely crowded
day. In the morning the hero met the heroine quite
casual-like at a railway station. The heroine was missing
trains, and the hero, who was a perfect stranger (and a far
from imperfect hustler in such matters), said, “Come along
for a pic-nic with me instead,” and, a few minutes later,
“I love you.” They were in the train by this time, and the
rest of the book is devoted to the pic-nic and what came of
it. Incidentally one may say that it was a somewhat com-
prehensive outing, involving a bathe in a stream, two
accidents—by dive and bicycle—and a night in a friendly
cottage. But no one need be really alarmed. The pro-
prieties, though strained almost to breaking-point, do just
hold. This is rather more than I can say about the plot,
But I feel dimly that there is a power—that Miss
WILLcocks has a power—behind it, that I have not fully
grasped. And to some extent I think that is her fault
and not mine. Her canvas is overcrowded with people
and ideas. In the title of nearly every chapter there is an
abstract thought large enough in itself to furnish material
for a separate novel. In this respect her book is inclined
to be vague and baffling. But then so is life, with its good
in ill and its ill in good. And because The Power Behind
is a fine picture of life it seems to me a book that is very
well worth reading. -
Miss MostR}son's The Strictly Trained Mother (MURRAY)
is a gentle chronicle of rather smaller beer than is likely to
suit the general palate. The story of Mrs. Betterton, ruth-
lessly managed out of all liberty by her competent daughters
and breaking away from home to go and stay with a grand-
child, cannot be said to provide matter that is morbidly
exciting. The old lady's portrait has been done with skill
and sympathy but the daughters' outlines are not free from
a rather crude exaggeration. There are no doubt many
managing folk who would do well to read this little study
of results; though they might only say, “I quite agree!" or
“How ridiculous!” without making suitable inferences.
For the rest of us I cannot honestly say that there's quite

(A SILLY SEAson SYMposium.)
SIR,--I was touring through the Western Counties on
my 180 h.-p. Mércèdes when I reached the cheery little
town of Blickhampton. I stopped at the leading hotel,
“The Blue Boar,” and told the landlord that I proposed
to dine there. Knowing that he would scarcely have a chef
at so small an establishment I suggested the following
simple menu-an omelette Russe, veal cutlets à la Main-
tenon, half a brace of grouse, and any simple sweet his
cook could supply. To my amazement he replied, “You
can have chops, or steaks, or bacon and eggs.” I told him
notice in Carcassonne and Nijni Novgorod, and his answer
was (I give it verbatim), “You may get them things in
America, but we ain't asked for a dinner once in a month.”
The more one tries to simplify the task of the country
hotel-keeper the more pig-headed and obstinate he becomes.
Yours truly, A CITIZEN of THE World.
SIR,--I have been making a five days' tour of your island,
visiting all its points of historical interest, the ancestral
home of the WASHINGTONs, the residence of BENJAMIN }
FRANKLIN’s great-aunt, and the gaols inhabited by the
persecuted Pilgrim Fathers before they started to make the
greatest country the world has ever known. At not one of
your local inns have I ever found more than a single bath-
room. At the Astor Hotel, New York, there is not a
single bedroom without four bath-rooms, and the suites
rented to multis always have ten. Even the cheap hotels

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I am always anxious to do the gentle-
manly thing, but, though my mater has got a book about
Etiquette, it doesn't say anything about flying, which is
what I am worried about. I hope you won't mind my
asking your advice, because I know if I told my own people
they would immediately knock the whole thing on the
head. I have sixpence per week pocket-money, and, as I
am dead keen on flying, I have saved up the two guineas
which is the lowest price for flight at Hendon (no reduction
for children). It has taken ages to do it, including tips,
but I don't grudge the money. The awkward part is I
have just got the exact sum, and I wonder if you are
supposed to give the driver sixpence for himself, like you
do a taxi 2 That would mean waiting another week; but
I want to do the proper thing, especially if it's GRAHAME-

THE INGENIots MR. FARNBorough-SMYTHE HAVING INvested THE RIsiNG TENNIS-NET, IIIs wife Is GIVING A series of Most
DELIGHTFUL RECEPTIONS AT THE 34TH MILESTONE, PortsMoUTH Road.
A LUCKY ESCAPE.
SoME people are not like others; I
am one of them. To most men the
refusal of a proposal is, in sporting
terms, a knock-out blow. A refusal
by Diana is, I should think, the worst
possible. And yet I merely smiled, and
with some appropriate, light, half-
humorous remark I turned the con-
versation into other channels.
I almost think Diana was the more
affected of the twain. -
No one would have guessed that the
well-groomed, debonair man, chatting
so gaily with his beautiful companion,
had just been refused by her. But he
had ; and perhaps the incident defines
my character more clearly than many
words.
That evening I sat up very late,
thinking. Suddenly I reflected that
Diana was a woman, and it is the privi-
lege of women—nay, even a proof of true
womanhood—to change their minds.
Diana in time must change her mind.
I met her two days later and im-
mediately started to change it. Diana
is, however, very clever.
“If you're going to propose,” she
said, “don't.”
I did. After all, what are a few
Following this incident Diana be-
came very alert. When we encountered
she somehow or other kept me at bay,
and, if necessary, took to flight. But
she found in myself a foeman worthy
of her steel.
“Hello!” I said, one morning.
“Doing anything on Friday?”
“No,” she replied, falling into the trap.
“Like to get married ?" I suggested,
and was so pleased at having got past
her guard that I hardly noticed her
mind had not changed.
“Ah, well,” I thought. “Some day
I shall catch her when her mind is
wanting a change ; then we shall see.”
Eloquent appeals were out of the
question; my proposals had to be
short and to the point. I flatter my-
self that, at times, I was original. The
culminating effort was a telegram (reply
paid) as follows: “What day would
suit 2"
The reply (paid) was very terse:
“None at all.”
I felt it could only be construed in
one way. And then I had a sudden
inspiration.
Some people are not like others, and,
as I told you, I am one of them. With
me thirteen is a lucky number. My
thirteenth attempt would bring me luck.
already put the question eleven times.
Only two more tries were needed.
The twelfth was a clever piece of
acting. I rang up Diana on the tele-
phone, disguised my voice, and then
proposed like lightning. Then I sat
down to consider my next move. The
thirteenth proposal was to be successful;
it ought to be exceptionally good.
For two days I thought very care-
fully, but no idea came to me.
On the third day I received a letter
addressed in Diana's handwriting. I lost
my breath. Had she anticipated my
thirteenth proposal and accepted? With
trembling fingers I tore the envelope
open; a dainty sheet of notepaper fell
out. Quickly I seized and read it.
Then I winced as in great pain.
Blindly I groped for the telephone.
Even her number was engaged. Even-
tually I was put through.
“Diana,” I said, “you can't marry
Denholme. Throw him over. I'm
proposing for the thirteenth time: six
times more than Robert Bruce, and my
lucky number.”
“Sorry,” said Diana, “I never change
my mind.”
And then I realised that thirteen
was indeed my lucky number. I had
had an escape. Diana was no true

words wasted ?

A brief calculation showed that I had

[In the fear that the Ulster cause has not
been sufficiently advertised lately, the author
begs to offer this little sketch, at the opening
of a new dramatic season, to any manager
patriotic enough to take it.]
The scene is laid in the private house
of Mr. James McSmith, a hard-headed
Belfast linen manufacturer. Mr. and
Mrs. McSmith are seated in the
library, a commodious room, fur-
mished on the north wall with a large
photogravure of Sir EDWARD CAR-
son and Mr. BonAR LAW shaking
hands, on the east wall with one of
Sir EDWARD CARson and Mr. F. E.
SMITH shaking hands, and on the
west wall with one of Sir EDWARD
CARson and Lord CHARLES BERES-
Ford shaking hands. The south wall
has been removed for the convenience
of the audience, but actu-
ally it bears a large
photogravure of Sir ED-
WARD CARson and Lord

mantelpiece is a snapshot
of Mr. James McSmith
himself signing the cove-
mant.

It is, as the Marquis of Mull ob-
serves in his impassioned appeal to the
public in last Saturday's Daily Terror,
one long tale of British disgrace and
decrepitude. That we are a musical
nation cannot be denied. Our ballad
concerts, our street organs, our devo-
tion to the banjo, the concertina and
the penny whistle proclaim it on every
side. We have pledged ourselves to
compete at Vienna, and yet with only
a brief year in which to prepare our-
selves nothing has been done to select
or train representatives. To expose
ourselves to a repetition of the defeat
which we underwent in 1910 is not
only humiliating but dangerous. It
advertises our weakness and lends
impetus to the Chauvinistic policy of
the other Powers. In short, by neglect-
ing to organise victory we disregard a
most effective insurance against in-
vasion.
The Marquis accordingly appeals to || ||
the nation to raise a sum of £500,000
to enable the Executive Committee to
and preparation of British representa-
tives. The amount, he admits, is con-
siderable, but it will be a magnificent
investment and will be repaid a hundred-
fold in national prestige and security.
The scheme involves the appointment
of 1,000 “talent-searchers” to scour
every corner of Great Britain, Ireland,
the Isle of Man and the Scilly Isles.
Suitable competitors, when thus se-
cured, will be sent to specially equipped
training colleges, where their preparation
will be systematically carried on under
the supervision of the best experts.
Thus, for example, candidates for the
heavy-weight Wagnerian prima donna
prize will be segregated in Dietetic
Sanatoria, where they will be subjected
to a process of intensive nutrition by
which a stone weight can be put on in
a fortnight.
Another of these colleges will be
exclusively devoted to the cultivation
of luxuriant chevelures by a process of
constant immersion in hot baths of
petroleum. Another and a very costly
department of the process of prepara-
tion is the equipment of poor singers
with costumes, jewels, pet dogs and all
the other indispensable paraphernalia
of prima donnahood. A special school
of journalism, again, will have to be
maintained for the instruction of com-
petitors for the Musical Criticism prizes
in the whole vocabulary of eulogy and
obloquy. There will also have to be
High Note, Low Note, Deep Note and
Long Note Gymnasia. There must be
an Academy for the promotion of
Epileptic Conductors. And, as the
Marquis of Mull eloquently remarks,
all this will cost money.
The Marquis of Mull concludes his
stirring appeal with a request that all
subscriptions may be sent to him at
the Fitz Hotel. The list has been
headed by £5,000 from the proprietors
of The Hairdressers' Gazette, £2,000
from the Marquis himself, £1,000 from
the Duke of Swankerville, £500 from
Messrs. Hufenvogel and Fleischheimer,
the great petroleum refiners, and 1/-

As 'ow ’E KNAWEd MoRE'N I KNAwed, so I says, “HouT.’”
“A SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION."
DEAR SIR,-Before making a few
remarks upon your interesting series
entitled, “Pages from the Diary of a
Fly,” I should like to explain my
motives in writing to you at all. They
are twofold. In the first place, as a
naturalist of, I hope, some distinction,
I want to discuss the matter scienti-
fically. And, as the victim of certain
misguided people who, under the im-
pression that I was a confirmed dip-
teramaniac, caused me, some years ago,
to be placed in a home for the mentally
unsound, I wish to prove my complete
and unquestionable sanity by a course
of didactic reasoning the infallibility
of which you will be bound to recognise.
Assuming, as I do, that your alleged
contributor hails from the Calypterate
Muscidae family, we are reduced to a
choice of two species, viz., the Blow-fly
or “Bluebottle,” and the Musca domes-
tica or common “house-fly.” My
knowledge of the whole order Diptera,
to say nothing of certain details in the
narrative under discussion, leads me to
suppose that the writer belongs to the
latter of the two sub-families. Very
which is this: that no Musca domestica
yet born can assimilate coherent and
veracious ideas such as are put forward
in this Diary; and, further, that, were
any fly possessed of this capacity, he
would find the difficulty of transferring
those ideas to paper, if not utterly
insurmountable, at least far greater
than you evidently suppose.
One moment, Sir! “Tush,” I hear
you say, “there it is in black and white.
We have the fly's word for it. And,
moreover, how can any naturalist,
however eminent, make such a compre-
hensive negation concerning the think-
ing capacity of an insect 2"
Every word that I have written, Sir,
I can thoroughly substantiate. Let me
give a brief outline of my own humble
researches. Though in the main of
antivivisectionist principles, I have
made various experiments upon the
brain of the Musca domestica, in every
case unsuccessfully. Being forced to
the reluctant conclusion that nothing
new was to be gleaned from within, I
set to work on the inductive plan.
Having obtained a healthy specimen,
one entirely free from empusa and not
long emerged from the pupa state, I
with the view of broadening out my
pupil's imitative ability. In one in-
stance only did I achieve any real
measure of success. Occasionally,
after clapping my hands and chuckling
for some minutes, I had the satisfaction
of seeing him simulate the emotion of
glee by rubbing his front legs together.
But that was all. Often, in trying to
make him rear on his hind legs, I not
only became stiff from my own exertions,
but experienced considerable hoarseness
from incessant reiteration of the word
“up.” His intellect, if any, seemed
quite impenetrable. For hours I was
in the habit of reading to him select
passages from Baedeker, Horace and
Bradshaw without response. Only a
week ago I subjected my theory to an
exhaustive test. Having obtained
another excellent specimen, I regaled
him with the first reminiscences of
your small contributor. If you will
believe me, Sir, his eyes showed no
flicker of interest. But not content with
this as a convincing proof of defective
receptivity, I established what was
almost a foregone conclusion—that he
was entirely unable to produce decipher-
able hieroglyphics. I went to the trouble

well. I now come to my contention,
and expense of having a diminutive

silver pen made for him, one-eighth of
an inch long. It was relatively easy
to procure the pen: but to make him
hold it was a very different matter.
First I placed it between the adhesive
pads of his front feet whilst he was
rubbing them together. The only result
was that he immediately desisted from
his occupation, and the instrument fell
with a tiny clatter on to the sheet of
foolscap I had provided for him. Next
I tried the lobes of his proboscis, but
these seemed sadly lacking in tenacity.
Not to be beaten too easily, however,
I dispensed with the manufactured
article and dipped the lobes themselves
in a bottle of ink. This turned out to
be an unfortunate move, for, instead
of making any attempt to transfer his
thoughts to paper, he contented himself
with sucking up the fluid with evident
relish, thereby inflicting upon himself
an attack of what I took to be acute
indigestion. At any rate the malady
has incapacitated him from experimental
work for several days. Although I intend
going into the matter more thoroughly
when my patient has recovered, I think
I have said enough to convince you
that this so-called Diary, far from being
of the Diptera family, is some spurious
production of the genus Homo.
Yours in sympathy,
OCTAvius GRUBBE (ex) F.R.S.
P.S.—During a further perusal of
your current issue, I have just noticed
the words “Byour Charivariety Artiste.”
This, of course, proves that you your-
self were not the victim of an imposture,
and stultifies the main purpose of this
letter, which I nevertheless forward to
you for the sake of its scientific interest.

ROCKS AHEAD.
[The City of London Public Health Depart-
ment have issued a circular in which it is
stated that the custom of rocking babies in
cradles is a wrong one and should be
abolished.]
UNREST continues to prevail in in-
fluential infant circles owing to the
threat of the elders to withdraw cradles,
and a force of 4,000 fathers had to be
called out during the small hours to
quell threatened insurrections. The
men were not able to return to bed
before daybreak. It is clear that the
paternal authorities are uneasy and
dread an outburst at any moment.
At a meeting of infants held in Little
Bunting protested against their being
deprived of a privilege which had been
theirs as babies since the days when
their poets had first sung. They would
remember that imperishable line— -
“When the wind blows the cradle will rock.”
He was a Pro-cradler, as he had always
been. Perhaps he was not so young as
he once was, but, if they would allow
an old infant, with eighteen months'
experience of the ways of the world, to
advise them, they would solemnly
register a determination never to go
to bye-bye without a good rocking.
The . Procession of Babies made its
way through the principal streets last
evening. Banners were carried bearing
such inscriptions as-
“THE HAND THAT DoESN'T Rock THE
CRADLE DoESN'T RULE THE WoRLD.—
YoU CAN'T HAVE IT Both WAYS."
“Rock Us IN THE CRADLE of
The DEEP IF You LIKE, BUT
RoCK Us.”
Later.—At a meeting of Parents
called specially last evening it was
agreed to urge the Public Health
Department to withdraw their circular.
It is confidently expected that the

the work of any enlightened member
babies will come in without delay.

“TALKING of doctors,” said Roley-
stone, “their job isn't as easy as it
looks. I know—I was once a doctor
myself—ship's doctor—for two whole
days. I was coming back from a
country in South America where
you must be either a ‘doctor' or a
‘colonel.’ I nominated myself 'doctor.”
“Doctor' allows a greater margin of
prevarication than ‘colonel.” There are
several kinds of doctors and you don't
have to elect which kind you will be.
“I didn't ask the agents to book my
passage with this prefix to my name,
nor did I ask my misguided friend to
introduce me to the ship's officers as
“Doctor.' Anyhow, I couldn't have
foreseen that the resident medico would
take sick leave in his bunk and that I
should be appointed to his duties. I
might have made a full disclosure to
the Captain and so escaped from an
equivocal position, but more eminent
men than I have fallen into a similar
error.
“On the whole I managed fairly

turned out to be a vegetarian. If the
Lascar whom I treated had not had
the sense to jump overboard, I might
have been in trouble over his death
certificate. As it was, the man was so
obviously drowned that a certificate
seemed hardly necessary. I have
always had a feeling that I should like
to know what the stuff really was that
I gave him. That it did nothing to
soothe his last hours I am certain, but
whether it was actually fatal in itself
I shall never know. These uncer-
tainties are very harassing.
“I was somewhat nonplussed when
they brought a girl to me who had a
finger sticking out at the back of her
hand at a most absurd angle. She
seemed surprised when I asked her
how long it had been like that. It
appeared that she had, a few minutes
before, unintentionally sat down on the
deck and had found her finger that
way when she got up. Under these
circumstances it seemed to be up to me
to do something about it. By a dis-
ensation of Providence, as I was
LET's
believe they call 'setting’ it, the thing
suddenly resumed the normal. It was
lucky that I had not actually diagnosed
a compound fracture, as I had intended.
The girl seemed quite relieved and
grateful when she saw all the fingers
on her hand in a row again. It was
rather a nice hand, and it was some
time before I felt that it was safe to let
it go.
“I still stick to my opinion that
that steerage passenger was merely
suffering from sea-sickness. I know
enough about doctoring to be sure that
appendicitis is only found in first or
second-class passengers who can afford
to pay biggish fees for operations. I
am glad that I refused to operate or to
assist the ship's surgeon in doing so,
when he got well. As it turned out,
the woman was still alive when they
carried her ashore.
“However, I freely admit that it
would have saved my colleague trouble
in the end if I had found all the pieces
of china, which were imbedded in
another patient's head before I applied
bandages. But then even steerage

passengers ought to know better than

should not have told her that she was
suffering from ‘periostitis of the cardon

man who came on board at Lisbon
began to take an interest in me. He
bored me considerably. I could not
see that it was any business of his
where I had studied medicine. It was
certainly careless of me to tell him
at different times on the same day that
I was a ‘London' man and a ‘Guy's '
man. I do not profess that my expla-
nation was very convincing. I said
that I thought it was elementary know-
ledge that ‘Guy's ' was in London.
“Finally he had the bad taste to
expose a nasty motley-looking arm in
the smoking saloon and to ask me what
I thought of it. To get rid of him, I
said that it looked to me as much like
incipient beri-beri as anything. It did,
though I never met beri-beri. This
had the effect of clearing the smoking
saloon. It also seems to have given
rise to a general feeling throughout the
ship that he was an uncompanionable
person. It was only when the Captain
wanted to know more about it that I
discovered that he was a well-known
attack of blood-poisoning. I tried to
make out that I really knew all about
it and that I was only pulling his leg,
but the ‘dressing' had, so to speak,
come off me. My popularity began to
wane from that time, and a faint-
hearted attempt to get up a testimonial
for me met with a cold and unsympa-
thetic reception.”

ONCE upon a time there lived and
flourished in a small city a worthy man.
He was devoted to his native place; he
loved its streets and stones, its strange
odours, its smoke, its high rates, its
indifferent water supply, its clubs and
cafés and everything about it. Nothing
could induce him to leave it even for
the briefest period. In vain did the
railway companies spread their Holiday
Arrangements before his eyes; he re-
turned with the more satisfaction to his
favourite seat overlooking the central
square.
And then one day the King of that
country, who was full of capricious
impulses, issued a decree that no
one in this little city should ever
leave it again, under pain of fearful
penalties.

BE WITH THE CHILDREN, COMPLAINING THAT SHE IS ALWAYS TIRED ; As IF OUR DARLINGS WEREN'T ENTERTAINING HER ALL DAY LONG.”
THE PHOTOGRAPHY THAT
TELLS.
“EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY.”
LAST year Charles Edward Lartington
spent his holidays with a friend on the
Norfolk Broads.
By profession he was a bank clerk—
teller, in fact, at the Plumboro’ branch
of the Northern and Southern Bank—
and, being in receipt of about one-half
of the salary with which Plumboro'
commonly credited him (for the directors
expected their officials to keep their
appearances up and their expenses
down), he had that year, as on many
preceding years, been unable “for
family reasons” to take the Swiss tour
sketched out for him by Mrs. Twemlow,
as also the Norwegian cruise suggested
by Mr. Aislabie.
By nature he was very much like
most of the other hirers of boats at
Wroxham, a good sort of a fellow in
his way, neither brilliant nor dull, a
little weak, a little dissatisfied; in
short, just one of the crowd which the
camera of publicity, directed at the
egregious, gets so hopelessly out of
focus, but which forms the background,
member of it, the backbone of the
country.
So Lartington and his friend set out
each morning for their leisurely life on
those slow-moving waters with pro-
visions, camera and pipes. It was not
a yacht they had hired, but a skiff; for
Lartington enjoyed the sculling. His
friend, being a photographer of no
mean order, lay back in the stern of
the boat and kept an eye open for
subjects. This attitude of non-inter-
ference with another's pleasure is often
observable on rivers.
One hot day they lunched off pork-
pies and bottled beer and, in the after-
noon, Lartington, having landed his
friend for the purpose of stalking wild-
fowl with the camera, pulled up-stream
alone. It was with a certain exultation
at his sense of mastery that he rowed.
Here, in the boat, he was director and
worker in one ideal combination. What
his mind directed his body effected, and
for his every stroke there was some-
thing definite to show. How different
from the Plumboro' bank! There they
wanted only the workers, the steady,
reliable, trustworthy men—men who
were painstaking, men who could follow

That started him off on a new train of
thought, of thick-headed duffers who
had been at school with him and had
long since passed him in the race for
wealth. That was the bitterest part of
all and made him feel almost anarchical.
And then a new thought struck him,
and he began to think harder and
deeper, so that his friend had to shout
to attract his notice.
“Cheer up, old man,” he said, as
Lartington drew into the bank. “What
are you thinking so deeply about 2
Stay there and I'll take you before the
sun goes down.”
Now, had Charles Edward Lartington
possessed the gift of prescience, or had
had ten minutes more to complete his
train of thought, it is probable that he
would have refused; but, being just a
little vain and just a little vacillating,
he did as he was told.
“That's it,” said his friend; “better
take your hat off, though. Now look
this way.”

WHOM I ASKED OUT OF PURE KINDNESS TO
THE PHOTOGRAPHY THAT
TELLS.
“EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY.”
LAST year Charles Edward Lartington
spent his holidays with a friend on the
Norfolk Broads.
By profession he was a bank clerk—
teller, in fact, at the Plumboro' branch
of the Northern and Southern Bank—
and, being in receipt of about one-half
of the salary with which Plumboro'
commonly credited him (for the directors
expected their officials to keep their
appearances up and their expenses
down), he had that year, as on many
preceding years, been unable “for
family reasons” to take the Swiss tour
sketched out for him by Mrs. Twemlow,
as also the Norwegian cruise suggested
by Mr. Aislabie.
By nature he was very much like
most of the other hirers of boats at
Wroxham, a good sort of a fellow in
his way, neither brilliant nor dull, a
little weak, a little dissatisfied; in
short, just one of the crowd which the
camera of publicity, directed at the
egregious, gets so hopelessly out of
focus, but which forms the background,
member of it, the backbone of the
country.
So Lartington and his friend set out
each morning for their leisurely life on
those slow-moving waters with pro-
visions, camera and pipes. It was not
a yacht they had hired, but a skiff; for
Lartington enjoyed the sculling. His
friend, being a photographer of no
mean order, lay back in the stern of
the boat and kept an eye open for
subjects. This attitude of non-inter-
ference with another's pleasure is often
observable on rivers.
One hot day they lunched off pork-
pies and bottled beer and, in the after-
noon, Lartington, having landed his
friend for the purpose of stalking wild-
fowl with the camera, pulled up-stream
alone. It was with a certain exultation
at his sense of mastery that he rowed.
Here, in the boat, he was director and
worker in one ideal combination. What
his mind directed his body effected, and
for his every stroke there was some-
thing definite to show. How different
from the Plumboro' bank! There they
wanted only the workers, the steady,
reliable, trustworthy men—men who
were painstaking, men who could follow
nitely, interminably; but talent!
That started him off on a new train of
thought, of thick-headed duffers who
had been at school with him and had
long since passed him in the race for
wealth. That was the bitterest part of
all and made him feel almost anarchical.
And then a new thought struck him,
and he began to think harder and
deeper, so that his friend had to shout
to attract his notice.
“Cheer up, old man,” he said, as
Lartington drew into the bank. “What
are you thinking so deeply about 2
Stay there and I'll take you before the
sun goes down.”
Now, had Charles Edward Lartington
possessed the gift of prescience, or had
had ten minutes more to complete his
train of thought, it is probable that he
would have refused; but, being just a
little vain and just a little vacillating,
he did as he was told.
“That's it,” said his friend; “better
take your hat off, though. Now look
this way.”
The photograph turned out to be one
of those lucky snapshots which the
professional photographer can seldom






and, in the opinion of each individual
hope to take. Lartington was not trying
out instructions automatically, indefi-

to look like a bank manager, nor a
repertory actor, nor a jolly fellow, nor
a bookish prig. He looked just like the
man everybody in Plumboro' knew, yet
with his “How-will-you-take-it, notes-
or-gold 2" air entirely gone. It showed
him, as someone said, “away from the
counter”; a little preoccupied perhaps,
and disguised by his boating flannels,
but still Lartington. His friend evi-
dently possessed a good lens, for the
empty beer bottles and a paper-bag,
with “A. Smith, Confectioner. Pork
Pies a Speciality,” printed upon it,
were plainly visible.
Everybody seemed pleased with the
photograph, particularly its author,
who printed several copies.
Eventually it got into the papers.
In fact, it was there that I saw it; and
it was the newspaper photograph and
the explanatory note beneath it that
first made me aware of Lartington's
existence. .
Poor fellow ! They caught him at
Liverpool trying to pass as an emigrant
with most of the gold tightly wedged
in his trunk. It was a third-class
steward, an assiduous reader of The
Daily Snapshot, who saw through his
disguise and told the police. He was
suitably rewarded. His Lordship,
having sentenced Lartington to five
years' penal servitude—for embezzle-
ment he said, but really for being photo-
graphed—commended the steward's
smartness in court, and the bank pre-
sented him with £10 (which made him
miss four successive boats). A not
wholly disinterested photograph, which
showed him clutching his favourite
paper (with its title very conspicuous),
gladdened the homes of several hundred
thousands of Snapshot readers; none
more so, perhaps, than that of Charles
Higson, the Stockton-on-Tees agent of
a hire-purchase firm, who had been
looking for this same steward (under
another name) for the last two years
in connection with several unpaid in-
stalments on a vanished piano.
“Fashions and Fancies.”

speaking of the new skirt, says, “Made

THE GAMBLER.
No, it has nothing to do with Mar-
conis. You will be thankful for that.
The hotel was full of grumbling guests.
The smell of wet umbrellas penetrated
to the remotest bedroom. The pro-
prietor, who had assured us that never
in the records of his establishment had
rain continued for two consecutive days,
had gone into dishonoured retirement.
People tapped the barometer and read
in yesterday's papers the approach of
disturbances from the Bay of Biscay,
Iceland, the Balkan Peninsula, and the
Women's Social and Political Union.
The golfers had talked themselves
hoarse about the defects of the links.
The fishermen, who only two days
before—unscrupulousfellows—had been
longing for a steady rain, were now
grumbling that it would take a week to
get rid of the flood-water.
The optimist was arguing in the
smoke-room that because the oak had
come out before the ash, or the ash
before the oak-he wasn't quite sure
which—abnormally fine weather was
about to set in. But every one knew
that the optimist was wearing a pair of
the head - waiter's trousers, having
drenched all his own garments. The
pessimist argued that the presence or
absence of icebergs in or from the
North Atlantic proved conclusively
that we were to have a cold, wet,
miserable summer. We all hated the
optimist for his irrational optimism,
and the pessimist for his irrational
pessimism.
Then a mild old gentleman incurred
wide-spread unpopularity by remarking
that this weather would be the making
of a lawn he had just had laid down.
And then the stout man, who stood
at the window cheerfully watching the
downpour, turned round and addressed
the company. -
“You should have insured your
holiday weather as I have done. As
there must have been a fifth of an inch
of rain yesterday and the same to-day
I get my expenses for the week.”
“A fifth of an inch 2 There's been a
fifth of a foot ” said the optimist.
“Of a yard,” said the pessimist.
The general feeling was that whilst
the optimist absurdly underrated the
downpour, the pessimist was inclined
to exaggerate.
“That being the case I'm in clover,”
said the stout man, rubbing his hands.
“I get this week for nothing, and I can
take another week when the weather is
more settled. My forethought has
justified itself. I paid a guinea and
I shall draw ten.”
Black hatred filled the hearts of
“Do they take your word for the
weather?" enquired the pessimist
scornfully.
We all felt that no
company could be so foolish.
“No, it is decided by the meteoro-
logical reports in the papers.”
One by one we left the smoke-room.
The presence of that degraded being
who gambled in sacred things like
holidays was as repulsive to us as
that of a Stock Exchange gambler must
be to Dr. CLIFFord. We stood in the
hotel porch watching the golden rain
(Daily Mail copyright) pouring money
into the pockets of a miscreant.
“One comfort,” said the optimist,
“these insurance companies generally
do you.” - * *
We felt that the dishonesty of insur-
ance companies was a thing to be
thankful for.
It was at dinner-time next day that
the London papers arrived. The opti-
mist opened his paper and gave a cry
of delight.
“Another anti-cyclone,” sneered the
pessimist.
“Listen,” said the optimist. “Here's
the weather report for Saturday and
Sunday: “Caergwyle-on-Sea, Saturday.
Showery. Rainfall -042. Sunday:
Passing showers. Rainfall 031.”
“It's a fraud,” said the stout man,
banging the table.
Twenty people explained to him at
once that showers were awfully local
and that the district rain-gauge might
have been left comparatively dry. The
optimist declared that no doubt the
rain-gauge had sprung a leak. But the
general opinion was that there must
be no gainsaying the scientific authority
of rain-gauges. The stout man left by
the night train to dispute the point
with the insurance company.
Whether the figures really were 4-2
and 3-1 inches of rain and were deemed
incredible by the meteorological authori-
ties, or whether the local council thought
it more expedient to modify the facts, I
know not; but we all felt thankful for
this providential set-back to that most
repulsive of men, a holiday gambler.

At the hurricane pace of a minute a mile, as only a long

Into and out of the bushes he pierced like a shooting star;
And now he thundered around us, and now he was whirling far.
And the little dog gazed till he seemed amazed, and then
he took to it too ;
With shrill notes flung from his pert pink tongue right
after his friend he few;
And the long legs lashed and the short legs flashed and

“THE investment itself,” George
continued, “is a comparatively trifling
one. But look at the possible results.
By purchasing only one ticket, you
may in a moment become the possessor
of no fewer than sixty thousand pounds.”
“But it's a hundred thousand to one
that I don't win it,” I said.
“The advantages,” he replied, “are
not, of course, limited to one prize only.
The others vary in amount from fifty
francs to five thousand pounds. There
are one thousand prizes of fifty francs
alone. Fifty francs,” he repeated,
making a hasty pencil calculation on
the back of an envelope. “Why, that's
two pounds in our English money. I

I spare you the rest. He went
through it all over again. So finally I
gave him his sovereign, as he knew
where to buy the beastly things.
“You won't regret it,” he confided to
me at parting. So far from regretting
it, I thought I had bought his silence
cheaply at a sovereign, and, of course,
dismissed the whole preposterous idea of
foreign lotteries from my mind at once.
Somehow or other, one dismissal
did not seem to be sufficient. The very
next day, when Angela came to lunch
(Angela is my property), I fell into a
muse. It had suddenly occurred to me
what a much better lunch I could have
given Angela if only the sixty

quired Angela. “You look very
worried.”
“Oh, nothing,” I replied. “Business

Then Jack Chalmers came to see me
in his new car—one of those long, ter-
rifying, very latest cars that arouse
immediate covetousness. Now with

I abandoned the idea of dismissal
and plunged headlong into my new
vice. Every moment of leisure, and
some others, were occupied for weeks
afterwards with careful calculations.
Judiciously invested, the amount would
bring in quite a tidy income. First
in the list of expenses would come
charities (say a tithe); that would
only be right, considering how I had
acquired the money. The other items
were wonderfully various, including
such objects as an emerald necklace
(for Angºla), a cabinet of cigars (for
me), a yacht, a new hat (for me again),
and an estate (roughly speaking, for
tions should be too sanguine, I would
momentarily lay aside the calculations
on the sixty thousand basis, and sup-
pose for the nonce that I had only
won the five thousand pound prize.
That would curtail the possibilities—
but it couldn't be helped, I would have
to make the best of a bad job. The
fresh list dropped the emerald necklace
and the estate as being out of the
question. But all my plans were
thoroughly cut and dried, and in readi-
ness for either contingency.
Then, one day, I actually rang George
up. I talked of the weather, and then
said carelessly:
“By the way, that old lottery of
yours—when do the results of the
wretched thing come out?”
“One day more,” he said; “results
out to-morrow. I can come round to the
Club before dinner and let you know, if
you like; I'm having a wire sent. To
my mind, it's an excellent investment.

trying day and a sleepless night.
The following evening I waited
anxiously at the club for George. I
had made up my mind how to receive
him. I would be reading The Globe,
nothing being further from my thoughts
than lotteries. Then, when he came
in and said, “You have won the sixty

By Jove, you were quite right then,

I settled myself down in a chair in
the smoking-room with The Globe all
ready. The nervous tension of the last
forty-eight hours had been great, and
in utter exhaustion I began to doze.
But my brain continued to make cal-
culations — on a larger scale than
anything hitherto attempted. More
judicious speculation, in which George's
advice proved invaluable, gradually in-
creased my fortune to gigantic pro-
portions. I became the owner of ten
hotels, four theatres, seventeen news-
papers, a huge tract of timbered land
in Canada, a few South American
diamond mines, and a fleet of yachts.

I shALL not easily forget the delightful revelation of a new
power that was given me by Mr. CoMPTON MACKENziE's
Carnival. Ever since then I have been waiting anxiously
for its successor, and it is now a great pleasure to find, after
one uncertain moment, that Sinister Street (SECKER) con-
firms and heightens my estimate of its author. The one
uncertain moment came to me in the early pages, while I
feared lest Mr. MACKENZIE was going to let his Balzacian
method run away with him; but this was only before the
charm of the subject had taken hold of me; afterwards I had no
more complaints. There are indeed aspects of this book that
I should find it difficult to overpraise; its marvellously
minute observation, for one, and its humour, and above all
its haunting beauty both of ideas and words. These gifts
are brought to the telling of something that has not, I
think, been told before, or at least not in this fashion—the
education of a London schoolboy, so different from the
cloistered existence of his contemporaries elsewhere.
Michael Fame is a figure to love, because he is of the very
small company of boys in books who are entirely human.
He grows before our eyes, as with an almost passionate
honesty the author traces every detail and influence of his
development. I do not know if the result will prove to be
a popular novel, and I do not care; what I do know is that
as a study of the education of character it is already a
masterpiece; and that I look forward to Michael's career at
Oxford (which we are promised in January) with as much
interest as if I were going up myself. It is not my habit
lightly to prophesy fame; but after these two books I am
prepared to wager that Mr. MACKENZIE's future is bound
up with what is most considerable in English fiction.
I have always this difficulty when confronted in book
form with a story which I have already seen as a play—that
I find it exceedingly hard to believe in the reality of those
episodes that take place, so to speak, off the stage. The
others are a very different matter; there I have my own
recollection to support the author's statements, especially
in the case of a play so delightfully well acted as was this
that Mr. GEORGE BIRMINGHAM has now published as a
novel under its original title of General John Regan
(Hodder AND SToughton). For example, when Mary Ellen
enters in the first act—I mean chapter—Mr. BIRMINGHAM
really need not have bothered to tell me that she was
adorably pretty, and that as she saw the motor-car “ her
beautiful brown eyes opened very wide. Her mouth opened
slightly and expanded in a smile. A long line of the black
transferred from the kitchen kettle to her cheek reached
from her ear to the point of her chin. It was broken as
her smile broadened, and finally part of it was lost in the
hollow of a dimple which appeared.” All this is quite
firmly fixed in my delightful memory of Miss CATHLEEN
NESBIT. Conversely, when Dr. Lucius O'Grady is here
described as riding furiously away on his bicycle, I am un-
able to banish a suspicion that it carried him no further
than the wings. Still, I would not have you suppose from
this that the present version of the affair does not make a
highly entertaining novel. It does. If you have been un-
fortunate enough not to meet it already at the Apollo
Theatre, you can read about it here, and chuckle con-
tinuously from page the first till “the curtain drops” on the
last. That these words are a quotation seems to show that

time in telling us about his discovery of Paris, his bills, his

I am not the proud possessor of an ancestral estate, but
I have always flattered myself that I should feel and do all
the right things if I were, so that CoNSTANCE Holme has
given my self-esteem a sad fall in Crump Folk Going Home
(MILLS AND Boon). To the de Lyndesay family, who be-
longed to Westmorland, and whose ramifications and re-
lations recall some Highland clan in the days of BosNIE
PRINCE CHARLIE, the estate of Crump was scarcely less
than a fetish. To walk across the park resolved itself
almost into an act of worship, and whatever form of
harakiri seemed good to any member of the sept would
cheerfully have been performed for the sake of the land.

able to picture him in an attitude so conducive to a
sense of well-being; but I am still more glad that the style
of his instruction permits his readers also to assume the
same comfortable posture; for easy writing does not always
mean easy reading. I cannot say—since I have never
caught him in the flagrant act of composition—whether
the Professor, with his writing-pad on his knees, was in a
position to reach, without rising, a considerable library of
books of reference. If not, then I confess myself over-
whelmed by the versatility of his erudition. His topics
range from Glaciers to Sea-squirts; from “Fatherless
Frogs” to “Pre-historic Petticoats; ” from New Guinea
Pygmies to the Galloping Horse in Art; from the Origin
of the Soul to the Extinction of Turtles. Here is matter
for all tastes. And as for the manner of it, the author
writes as he would talk, repeating himself if he wants to,
digressing and meandering at his own sweet will, but
always keeping to the happy middle way between the
preserves of the pedant and the hunting-grounds of the
popular writer. And through it all runs a pleasant savour
of what I hardly dare to call humaner studies. I like, too,
his way of suggesting that, while making due allowance for
my state of darkness in relation to science, he assumes that
I possess intelligence of a sort. He has a chapter that
a distinctly brighter Crump, with curse, cedar, mother-
in-law and misunderstanding all removed at once. Till
then I had hardly felt that Crump could be called an
asset, so greatly was the atmosphere of storm and gloom
and necessity insisted on throughout, and so heavy seemed
the Lyndesay yoke. Yet they would all stop and admire
the Crump scenery for hours, or stoop down (almost) and
kiss the turf at any time. It seemed a preposterous obses-
sion of the soil for its own sake apart from most of the
things it usually stands for. Still, Crump was Crump;
there is no getting away from that; and for those who were
born to Crump the very name spelled balm. An ordinary
fellow like myself would probably have tried to get it altered.

PoETS AT BAY.
A PAMPHLET by Mr. EDMUND GossE,
C.B., on “The Future of English
Poetry,” has caused so much disturb-
ance in the best poetic circles that
a mass meeting was recently called to
debate the great critic's conclusions.
Objection was principally taken to his
contention that the poets of the future
will disdain the ordinary forms of
speech and will refrain from celebrating
natural objects on the ground that
everything that can be said about their
obvious beauty has been said. “Future
poets,” says the gifted Librarian of the
House of Lords, “will seek to analyze
the redness of the rose [not “nose," as
in an unfortunate misprint], and will
scout, as a fallacious observation, the
statement that the violet is
blue. All schemes of art

The chairman then proceeded to read
a letter from Dr. Roi ERT BRIDGEs,

said. There was no doubt whatever
that mere—pettiness had had its day.
What the poet of the future needed
was a hard-bitten vocabulary drawn
from experience of rough-and-ready life,
no matter how squalid. Realism was
the thing. “Give your readers——,”

Mr. RUPERT BRookE said he was one
of the young guard. His particular
line was emotion. He had in fact
written a volume chiefly of love poems,
but he was bound to confess that his
interest in love was principally the
conviction that it was certain to end.
He defied any little boy in a grammar
school to write anything that would

Mr. MARSH, in his opening remarks,
said that he was, he supposed, peculiarly
qualified to take the chair, since he was
the editor of The Book of Georgian
Verse. (Loud applause.) It was called
Georgian, he said, because all the
poets in it were born in the reign of
Victoria and educated in the reign of
Edward VII., and most of the poetry
| was written before GEORGE W. came to
the throne. None the less, Georgian
was a good title, especially as the word
had no eighteeenth-century connota-
tion. (Renewed cheers.) He had made
a close study of modern verse, he
continued, and was satisfied that a
return to simplicity might occur at
any moment, and that when it did

part I believe that upon the arrival of

will follow, and that the combination
of old-fashioned words is no more
exhausted than the combination of the
notes of the piano. (Loud enthusiasm.)
In my opinion,” the letter concluded,
“there are few less profitable tasks
than the attempt to forecast the trend
of the arts, since a genius may at any
moment appear, to blow conjecture sky-
high." (Renewed applause, and not a

PENNY WISE.
YoU see, there are two stations:
| Blackhaven Harbour and Blackhaven
Central. The train for Ellam starts at
the first and passes through the second.
When I say passes through, of course
Trains on the Ellam
branch stop at all stations and between
most of them.
As we arrived at the Harbour Station
with thirty minutes to spare, Charles
suggested walking in to the Central
| Station. -
“Why?” I asked.
“It will pass the time away.”
“That can be done automatically,”
I protested.
“It will be exercise.”
“I’d rather do some Swedish drill
in the refreshment room.”
“It will save a penny.”
“Charles,” I said, “my forefathers
occupied the throne of Scotland, but
you cannot tempt me thus. When I
am on my holidays I never think about
anything less than threepence.”
“Come on,” said Charles illogically.
He fascinated me with a walking-
I came on.
But my worst fears were realised.
As the engine flies, it is, I believe,
half-a-mile onward from Blackhaven
Harbour to 131ackhaven Central. As
we fled it might have been anything
up to fifty miles, if Charles had not
admitted after ten minutes that he did
not know the way. Inquiry only
served to acquaint us with unblissful
truths. In the first place there was
the river Wurzel. You have to go
along the street by the Wurzel till you
come to a bridge. But it must be the
right bridge. In the second place there
is the cemetery. Somehow I had
known that there would be trouble with
a cemetery. You have to walk round
three sides of it because the fourth side
is the railway, where one is prosecuted.
I rather expected a swinging barrel
and a water-jump, but apparently the
Corporation hadn't quite finished laying
out the course.
Charles remained insolently cheerful.
His conversation concerned itself with
pennies, their origin, history, and fu-
ture; with great men who had started
life with a penny arduously scraped
with stories of banks which had averted
closure by an odd penny; with the
purchasing power of the penny in
the sixteenth century. He was just
looking forward to the day on which
a first-hand copy of The Times would
be purchasable for a penny when we
reached the Central Station, in time
to see the Ellam train disappearing
slowly but firmly into a tunnel.
“It is true,” said Charles, “that by
wasting time we might have got to
Ellam two hours sooner. But you
must not forget that the fare from the
Harbour Station is sevenpence, where-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GOLF FOR HEROES.
A HUGE, grim man in tweeds, with
the jaw of a gladiator, sombre, smould-
ering eyes, and a pair of crutches, who
was standing outside the granite-built
clubhouse, pointed out the secretary
with, I fancied, a boding, rather sinister
look.
“You have played so long upon your
rather easy local links that you seek a
change—something a little more trying,
a shade more difficult—and have heard
that the Shadow Valley Links have
been laid out especially to accommodate
those who like their golf made strenu-
ous?” said the secretary, a bland,
ber at the moment. Do you cultivate
the pull at all? I should not advocate
that shot just here. The hole is a
great favourite with heroic golfers.
Mr. HENRY LEACH admires it so much
that he has written seventeen different
articles about it.
“This is the sixth. You see, the
green is well guarded. Yes, they are
bull-terriers—four of them. Fierce 2
Oh, so-so—moderately. It is possible
to hole out without risk, but one needs
to approach very accurately. Hardly
a fair test, I think, because some men
have an inborn dislike for dogs. We
meet that, however. We provide long
you. It is loosened by a magnetic-
hydraulic device, patented by me.
You see the avalanche—up there,
straight overhead. Good imitation of
snow, is it not ? Rather expensive,
but one cannot have really heroic golf
without paying for it, obviously. We
call this the Excelsior Hole. Mr. P. A.
VAILE considers that the cliff is not
sufficiently under-cut to allow the
correct amount of over-spin to the
avalanche. I begged him to play the
hole for himself, but he was of the
opinion that it was hardly necessary;
he relied upon his calculations, he said.
Personally I think he was wrong; we
regularly bag our two brace a
easy-mannered, enthusiastic gen-
tleman. “Quite so; you have
done well to come here. You must
let me show you round the course.
I am very proud of it—extremely
proud. Yes, I designed it; every
detail of the laying-out was com-
pleted under my personal super-
vision. I came to the conclusion
that, for really ambitious players,
golf generally was too safe, sim-
ple, dull—trivial, in fact. But
we are not trivial here. One's
nerves must be more or less in
order if one is to play a good round
on the Shadow Valley Links.
But you will see for yourself.
“I think we need not waste
much time over the first hole; it
is comparatively simple. The
bunkers seem rather formidable 2
Oh, one would hardly say that—
the wasps' nest inside each of
them makes it a tolerably inter-
esting hole, but hardly formid-
able. I beg your pardon 2 Oh,
yes—wasps, I said. Three nests
—one in each bunker. When a
ball trickles into the bunker it
automatically sets into action—
“Now, HoRACE, STOP THAT wrigg LING ABOUT AND walk
PROPERLY.”
month at this hole.
“That one with the red flag is
mined in every direction—in six
places, to be exact. We use the
old-fashioned black blasting pow-
der; we find it slightly more
effective than gun-cotton. It is
fatal to slice there. Mr. BERNARD
DARWIN thinks it is a very
amusing hole. He wrote quite
airily about it.
“But you must not imagine
that we have neglected the ladies.
We are not so ungallant as that,
I hope. Indeed, no. Upon the
tenth and sixteenth greens are a
number of small holes of de-
cidedly menacing appearance.
Round about these are sprinkled
baited mouse-traps and rat-traps.
This is for the moral effect. If
a lady makes a bad putt a circuit
is completed and an electric cur-
rent causes a number of mice to
pop fiercely in and out of the
holes. We have found it very
successful. We use snakes also
—sparingly, curled up in certain
of the holes. The size of the
hole, of course, is a draw-back.
One rather leans to rattlesnakes;
gentle and sustained action—a
patent stirrer and poker attached to the
nest, so that the wasps are more or
less ready to receive the player when
he arrives to play out. We use hornets
at the fourth hole—it is much more
awkward to be bunkered there.
“This is one of the longer holes—a
good hole. We call it the Great Surprise.
There are no bunkers, you see. It is a
clear fairway from tee to flag. Easier
than the fourth, you think? Ah, but
one has to keep straight because of the
pitfalls. The safe fairway is only four
yards wide. Either side of that, here
and there—dotted about, don't you
know—are concealed pitfalls, with lids
—trapdoors—covered with real grass,
of course. They work on the dead-fall
principle, and contain water or tar—five
water, six tar. Only two are staked;
steel rakes, so that a badly played ball
can be raked out of the bull-terrier
zone. One forfeits the hole in that
case, naturally. You see some of the
finest approaching in the world at
this hole. Oh, yes, they are safely
fastened; each dog can only work
within the limits of its string—unless
the string snaps. The posts flimsy 2
Oh, I don't know. Do you think so?
We have had no complaints. (Ah,
Cerberus, old boy; there you are.
Down, sir; the gentleman is not yet
a member.) Don't mind him; he's
a little petulant to-day.
“Now, this is really chic, the twelfth.
The green is under the cliff, as you see.
One positively must play a good shot
here; a slovenly stroke is sharply pun-
ished. Put your ball anywhere but on
the sudden ringing of their rattles would
test the composure of a putter admir- |
ably. Unfortunately rattlesnakes run
large. A pity; but I am giving some
thought to the point, and hope soon to
overcome the little difficulty.
“Of course, the idea is really in its
infancy. You must not expect too
much at first. It is not easy to make
golf really heroic, but we shall improve.
We welcome suggestions, too. If you
have an idea at any time—” he spoke
absently, musingly, his eyes fixed
rather vacantly on a building close by
which looked ominously like a cottage
hospital.
“I think you have it all very com-
plete,” I said. “But there is one thing,
perhaps, though probably it is merely
an oversight on your part. It would

AT THE PLAY.
“Joseph AND His BRETHREN.”
THE production of Joseph and his
Brethren—a play in four Acts by Moses
and Louis N. PARKER—marks (I am
told) an epoch in theatrical history,
the Bible being recognised henceforward
as fit material for the English stage.
This recognition may take a load off
the minds of actor-managers, pro-
ducers and playwrights, but it leaves
me cold. My temperature, however,
being a matter of no public interest I
will not dwell upon it, but, instead,
will try to find the reason for the en-
thusiasm of the faculty.
The story of Joseph is known to
everybody. It is a simple story enough;
and though the method which Joseph
adopts to reveal himself to his brothers
when they come to Egypt for corn has
more than a touch of the
theatre about it, yet, told in
simple Biblical language,
its very naïveté makes its
appeal. Thestory of Zuleika
is known chiefly to Mr.

marked Joseph as her prey
from the moment when she
bought him for twenty
shillings at the pit's mouth,
played the scorned villainess
so thoroughly that twelve
years later she was still
plotting to stab him by
the hand of another. Not
unnaturally her husband
Potiphar was there to over-
hear the plot (for it is
unthinkable that so good a
plot should not be overheard by some-
one), and Zuleika's eyes were put out
to the accompaniment of a thrilling
scream and the fall of the curtain on
Act IV., Scene 3.
Very well; now call Joseph by any
other Jewish name—Jimnah, say;
imagine that the story of Jimnah was
also invented by an Englishman, and
let us all go to see the great Eastern
production Jimnah and Zuleika in
four Acts by Louis N. PARKER. What
would be the result 2 Well, of course,
the play would not have a chance.
Not all the skill of Mr. Joseph HARKER
(scenery), Mr. ADoLF SchMID (music),
Mr. PERCY MAcquoid (costumes), and
Sir HERBERT TREE (overseer) could
save so absurd a melodrama.
So perhaps that explains the enthu-
siasm of the profession. Joseph and
his Brethren will be a success, but it
will be a success because it rests upon
a Biblical story; it could never stand
on its own merits. That it can have
any evil effect on the spectator, that it
not believe for a moment; though the
Censor apparently has believed so for
years. But, on the other hand, I do
not see that it is going to do any good
—either to the stage or to the public.
Yet it may have this effect; it may
send people to the Bible to see how
much of the story comes from Genesis
and how much from Mr. PARKER. And
having read the story of Joseph they
may stray backward or forward a
little. If they stray backward they
may come to this verse—
“And Jacob served seven years for
Rachel; and they seemed unto him but
a few days, for the love he had to her.”
Then at least they will understand
the difficulties of a collaboration in
which one author writes like this and
the other like Mr. PARKER.
Joseph was excellently played by
Mr. GEORGE RELPH, and as Jacob,
Sir HERBERT TREE had a small part
which gave him no difficulty. But I
was most taken with Judah and Simeon,
and particularly Judah. Mr. HUBERT
CARTER made the first scene extra-
ordinarily lifelike, and his delivery of
that fine speech from the forty-fourth
chapter of Genesis was a triumph. I
don't know what authority Mr. PARKER
has for making Simeon the villain of
the piece, but Mr. H. A. SAINTSBURY
gave him something more than the
ordinary Adelphi touch.
“THE WILL ''
AND
“THE ADoRED ONE.”
I have now had twelve hours in
which to wonder what went wrong at
the Duke of York's on the first night,
and I have come to the conclusion that
it was Sir J. M. BARRIE’s own fault.
He started too well.

plaining lately what happens to a play

The fourth play,

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I have been
recently delighted to read—in the
London Letter of one of our leading
newspapers—a statement with regard
to glow-worms which should not be
allowed to escape notice. “A well-
known Member of Parliament,” says
the writer, “informed me some time
ago, that he was constantly in the
habit of using a number of these
luminous insects in his nursery in place
of the ordinary night-light.”
May I say, without undue vanity,
that it is many years since I first be-
gan to make a study of the practical
efficiency of insects, and that I have
found them of use to me in a great
variety of ways? I have myself kept
a tame glow-worm for some months
which has rendered me splendid service

Edwin. “OH, MOTHER, Look AT THose NAUGHTY MEN QUARRELLING.
THE PURPLE DRAGON.
I suppose it is not once in two years
that I drop into an auction room, but
when I do go I invariably make a fool
of myself. It is a queer coincidence.
Ursula, my dear wife, is the sweetest-
tempered woman in the world, but if
there is one thing that does provoke
her more than another, it is quite
certain to be the thing that I have been
doing, or leaving undone, when I return
from an auction.
The other day, however, I thought
myself safe. To begin with, my presence
at the sale was partly accidental. No
one having sent me there, there were
no commissions that I could exceed or
coveted bargains that I could let slip—
matters in which I had often been
proved liable to error. I had been away
from home for three weeks, and having
an hour to wait at our market town
owing to the breakdown of the car that
should have met me, I was strolling
about at a loose end, when I saw the
sale going on, and went in. That I
think clearly shows that for what
followed I was not personally to blame.
Anyhow, it seemed at first as though I
were in luck. I hadn’t been inside the
place five minutes before the man in
shirt-sleeves began carting round some-

like a flash. I saw then that it must
have been inspiration that had sent me
into the sale-room that afternoon, to
encounter a treasure for which I had
ransacked Europe (more or less) in vain.
The auctioneer was letting off some of
his usual patter about rare old Oriental
porcelain, but this didn't concern me.
I had seen in an instant what the thing
really was—the long-sought fellow to
Uncle Dick's purple dragon.
You can fancy if I was excited or not.
The other dragon, the mate (if I may
so express myself) of this one, had been
a present to Ursula from her uncle at
our wedding; and for years we had
tried to find its companion. The thing
had at last begun to get on Ursula's
nerves, so much so that I had heard
her express actual distaste for our lonely
monster, and even a wish to destroy it.
But of course now it would be different.
It appears to be a rule about china that
two horrors make a beauty; I don't
profess to understand these matters
myself, but I have observed this.
So I began to bid. One of the reasons
for my dislike of auctions is that they
make me nervous. I can never hear
my own voice naming a figure without
the sensation of going extremely white
about the lips. Whether I do so really
or not is another matter; I have never
Also the backs of my hands tingle.
Thus it requires a considerable exercise
of courage on my part to bid at all.
“Now then, gentlemen,” said the
auctioneer, “make a start. For this

guineas for this exceptionally * x
“Five,” said a stout man, immediately
below the table. (“This,” I thought,
“is excellent; I shall get it dirt

The auctioneer rewarded him with a
smile of encouragement. “Thank you,
Sir. Five guineas I am bid. Five
guineas for this—I beg your pardon,
Sir, pounds. Five pounds only. What
improvement on five pounds?”
He looked round the company, and
his eye caught mine. Possibly my lips
moved, but I am uncertain; at all events
some subtle telepathy seemed to have
been established between us. “Six
"pounds,” said the auctioneer (though
how he knew is a mystery). “Six
pounds offered.”
“Seven,” said the stout man.
“Eight,” said the auctioneer, after
another glance at me.

apparently a dealer.

SLINGING IT ABOUT.
PLAIN WORDS To PolicEMEN.
(In the gentle manner of Mr. ARNOLD
WHITE in “The Daily Express.”)
WE have got them on the run. Their
hair is on end, great clammy beads of
sweat are on their brows, and with the
light of panic in their eyes they are
sprinting for the horizon; they are
fleeing before their doom—the muddied
Ministers who have torn the Constitu-
tion into shreds, despoiled the Church,
sung psalms while they wallowed in the
slime of speculation, insulted the KING,
and sent up the price of bacon.
And with them is the Editor of The
Dictator. The Editor of The Dictator
is an accomplished writer, but he has
dared to oppose his faint-hearted
counsels to the clarion call of the men
who wield the bludgeon, and who exult
fiercely at the sound of their horrific
weapons beating the air. When I told
him last week that his politics were
pig-wash, he attempted no reply. He
too has donned his running-shorts and
is showing a clean pair of heels to the
advancing host. But the heels of
Ministers are far from clean. They are
befouled with thick mud. There is mud
all over their traitorous bodies, and they
shall stick in it all the days of their life.
In previous articles I showed how
the Separation Bill, if passed into law,
would split the Army and the Navy.
This week we have to consider its no
less cataclysmic effect upon the police
force. The finest thing in boots is a
British policeman, fixed and rooted in
the determination to preserve the peace.
Shall these stout souls be ordered to
trample upon the inalienable rights of
the Ulstermen, to coerce them into sub-
mitting to govern themselves? I do
not know a single policeman who would
not rather swallow his truncheon than
apply it to the heads of men, women and
children who are fighting for the price-
less heritage bestowed upon them by
the Act of Union. In Ulster, they tell
me, even the infants are in arms. And
why? Because they know that Home
Rule has in store for them convulsions
more terrifying than any of the natural
ills their tender flesh is heir to, and
because the stench of the Ministerial
slime-pits has turned their stomachs.
Shall the knee of the British policeman
be pressed into their innocent backs?
Calmly and dispassionately I say that
the very thought is a shrieking outrage
upon all instincts of decency, and that
the feet of any policeman who for one
moment harboured it would be a dis-
grace to their leather.
The temper of the force is one of the
most vital factors to be reckoned with

subject. What does Mr. McKENNA
know about the police he is supposed
to have under his control? He has a
slight superficial knowledge of the
manipulation of processions and the
cost of helmets; but of the soul of the
police he knows no more than my
aunt's tomcat. If he imagines that
this patriotic body of men is going to
stoop to the dirty work of running in
Ulstermen, the doors of Colney Hatch
are yawning to receive him.
There are some delicately nurtured
people (such as the Editor of The
Dictator)—men who put on a clean
collar every morning and dress for
dinner—who say that the KING should
sign the abominable Separation Bill,
and who would thus wash their finniky
hands of the consequences. The poli-
ticians who would thus stand calmly
by and see the Empire dynamited are
man and his multitudinous affinities.
If the cooks of England are willing
that the burly arm of the law, which
has so often essayed the circle of their
waists, shall be laid upon the shoulders
of the most loyal of His Majesty's
subjects, then in Heaven's name let the
KING sign, and let the cooks stew in
their own juice. But everybody who
is not a victim of the verbal staggers
(like the Editor of The Dictator) knows
that the goddesses of the kitchen will
not allow this atrocity, and it is this
knowledge that makes the faces of our
muckrake Ministers turn ghastly pale
beneath their coating of mud.

A PERSONALITY.
ANY lawyer will elaborate to you, if
you will let him, the root idea of
companies. When he explains that
the principle is the creation of a new
persona, which is the company as
distinct from the individuals it com-
prises, you will look very knowing,
murmur, “Ah, yes, of course,” and
wonder privately whether the speaker
himself sees any sense in the words he
is using. It is not till you come to
pick a quarrel with a company that
you realize the soundness of the
lawyer's observations and discover how
elusive is this persona of the company,
and how little it has to do with the
individual personae upon whom you
endeavour to fix the blame.
Our back-to-work train was already
half-an-hour late at Exeter, yet there
was no single person I could get hold
of and say, “You’ve done this; what
in thunder do you mean by it?”
There were only innumerable porters
and ticket collectors, guards and a
bookstall boy unanimous upon one
subject, that nothing would induce the
train, once having started, to stop
again before it got to Cheltenham.
“Next stop, Chltnm ' " they repeated,
getting more heated and determined
about it every time. But even on this
point they were wrong, wrong by about
twenty-five full-stops and as many
commas. They had reckoned without
the signals, and signals at holiday time
do not believe in too much rush. My
carriage happening to stop opposite a
signal-box, I took the opportunity to
go into the matter with its occupant.
“You ought,” I told him, “to be
ashamed of yourself, carrying on like
this.”
Affably but finally he explained that
he was not to blame. The explana-
tion was dull and familiar; I do not
repeat it.
The guard walked along the track in
order to join in our conversation. I
tried him. “You ought to be ashamed
of yourself,” I told him. The guard
also had his defence ready and gave it
smilingly. “As the engine - driver
appears to be unoccupied,” I continued,
“you might just ask him to step this
way and hear what I think of him.”
“Old Bill?” said the guard. “Why,
he's as anxious to get home to his
º as any of us. You can't blame
lim.”
“Then who the deuce can I blame 2"
I asked.
You see what I mean 2 If it had
been the other way on and the Com-
pany had been employing me to do a
you may be sure that a definite persona
would have emerged to abuse me for
doing it so badly. Why then, as I put
it to the inspector at Cheltenham
eventually, why shouldn't such a one
be put forward for me to abuse?
The inspector (having disclaimed
liability) assured me that the Com-
pany's one object in existence was to
give satisfaction.
“Bah!" said I (I had seen the word
in a book).
The inspector could only suggest
that at Birmingham, where all com-
modities are to be had, including
Railway Magnates in top hats, I might
get what I wanted. With no great
confidence I waited for Birmingham
and a top hat. “Now, Sir," said I, at
last having cornered an overdressed
official, “I trust that you are heartily
ashamed of yourself.”
He regarded me calmly. “You
refer,” he suggested, “to the lateness
of this train, of which I have already
heard some mention 2''
“I do indeed,” I cried bitterly.
He looked as one about to fight, but
on second thoughts he seemed to
appreciate the depth of my feelings
and to decide upon another attitude.
“I can only say,” he declared, “that
I am very, very sorry about it.”
“It is no good your being sorry,” I
sniffed. “I desire to find the person
who is to blame and make him sorry.”
He blushed; he appeared very nearly
to weep. “I,” said he, “I am to
blame.”
I was at first incredulous, but being
assured on the point, I told him in
what opinion I held him, what course
I proposed to adopt with regard to
him, and what end I hoped would
overtake him, when, reported, disgraced
and dismissed, he crept solitary and
broken into the outer darkness. It was
a five minutes' speech, but the pleasure
of it was ample compensation for the
suffering of many hours.
Upon being assured that I had dealt
with the subject in all its many aspects,
my friendly enemy asked me if there
was anything else he could do for me.
“Tell me,” said I pleasantly, for I
was now, if exhausted, on good terms
with the world again, “how came you
to make the train behave so badly 2
How, I mean, do you influence its
movements one way or the other ?”
“I?” he queried. “I” ”
“Yes, you. Without prejudice, what
exactly have I been reprimanding you
for 2 What was it which neither the
signalman, guard, engine-driver nor
inspector could do to expedite the train,

a loss. “I have nothing to do with
trains. My business is with passen-
gers.”
“But what are you?" I asked.
“The Responsible Official,” he said.
“But what are you employed to do?"
I pressed.
“To listen, mostly.”
“Speaking quite technically,” I said,
“what are you for 2"
“To blame,” he said. “I mean, to
be blamed.”
Since then I have always travelled
by this line, whenever its trains and I
are bound for the same destination; I
have frequently deviated from the
straight way, have even on occasion
adapted my destination for the purpose.
The most important and real con-
venience of railway travelling is to have
an official ever ready to accept in
person a responsibility which he may
in fact have done nothing to deserve,
always prepared to look upset and
downcast when I swear to him that
nothing on earth shall ever induce me
to be a passenger on his line again.

(Being an essay in the modern psycho-

the present-day taste.) -
Book I.-HUBERT SELECTs A TIE.
HE entered a shop in the Burlington
Arcade to buy a tie. To be accurate,
he did not enter it so much as he was
drawn into it. He wanted to buy a
tie, but he had not utterly and finally
decided that he would purchase it at
that particular shop. Indeed, for a
fraction of a second he hesitated in the
very doorway. An almost sub-acid
intuition warned him that the whole
current of his life might depend on
the particular shade of the tie he
selected.
A fly buzzed. It was an ordinary
fly, not different outwardly from a
million other flies. Yet the convolu-
tions of its brain could not be exactly
like the convolutions of its million
fellows. The path in which it flew
was inevitably different from the path
which any other fly would have taken.
It alighted on a purple tie. If the tie
had not been of a soul-arresting purple,
it might have flown elsewhere. Some-
where back in the aeons of ages a
Purpose had decided on this concatena-
tion of circumstances.
Hubert followed the fly. He ex-
amined the tie. He brought his whole
faculties of mind to bear on the

the light. The purpleness changed

from a challenging militancy to a

to him as a Parable of Life. He would
have said so to the shop-assistant, had
not a flooding intuition warned him
that this automaton of the mart might
misunderstand the inmost significance
of his thought.
“The very latest shade,” insinuated
the assistant. He was a small man, or
rather youth, with a moustache which
appeared to have been forced beyond
its natural development and gave the
suggestion of social striving doomed
to eventual impotence. He lived in
Fulham. It was three miles from the
Burlington Arcade. He reached his
mart daily by motor-'bus, buying a
twopenny ticket of an unassertive blue.
Sometimes he took 'bus No. 42, and
sometimes 'bus No. 19. He had no
preference in the matter, for such was
his temperament. He cared nothing
for where the 'bus proceeded after it
had deposited him at Bond Street—or
rather, eight yards to the eastwards of
Bond Street — and continued on its
journey. His stunted imagination

“The very latest shade,” insinuated
the assistant.
“H'm,” said Hubert non-committally.
He searched into the eyes of this fellow-
human, groping for the sympathetic
understanding his soul craved for. He
tried to dissect a fellow-soul with the
inadequate lancets of his vision. He
would have liked to discuss that tie
from the point of view of aesthetics, of
ethics, of morals, of philosophy, of
metaphysics, of pragmatic neo-Bergson-
ism. He would have liked to engage
in a discussion which could have
embraced the universe and the stars
and the purpose of creation. Yet he
faltered, and examined the tie anew.
The assistant was a sordid being.
After half-an-hour he fidgeted. He
wanted to sell Hubert a tie, and that
was the limit of his present ambition.
He could not realise the epochal
significance of Hubert's decision. He
lived in Fulham in a little semi-detached,
two-storied house where he occupied a
rear room on the upper floor. .
(Description of the room occupies four
pages solid without a paragraph.)
“H'm,” repeated Hubert at the end
of thirty-four minutes of thought.
“Three-and-six,” said the assistant.
It was an ill-judged observation.
What did it matter to Hubert whether
the tie were three shillings, three-and-
six, or four shillings? Sixpence more
or less would not ruin his finances; but
a shade of purple more or less might
shatter his soul. It might sear his
ego with an ineffaceable brand of
emotion. True that he could not see
the tie when it was knotted into place,
except by straining his eyes downwards
over his 34 inch wing collar, but the
effect nevertheless would be all the
more crassly dangerous. It would
catch his eye from the glass of a shop-
window or the mirror of a taxi-
suddenly, thunderously, with the force
of a planetary collision.
He was torn with doubts. Another
ten minutes passed. The assistant
whispered discreetly to a fellow-trades-
man at the rear end of the shop. Out
of the tail of his eye Hubert caught
the clandestine converse. It disturbed
him rudely. He felt that they were
mocking at a momentous decision far
beyond their dwarfed understandings.
How petty the world was — how
hideously alone. A barrier of glass,
steel-strong, separated him from his
fellow-beings. It had always been the
same. He recalled the days of his
cradle. . . . (Ten pages of cradle-

insinuated the assistant.
His crude impatience shattered the

the shop.

which is to conduct a rather poor creature of a man to the

about the inception of this idea; and the First Night, with
its rapturous applause promising success for what turns out
to be financial failure—this betrayed the man of theatrical
experience in its author. Later, I thought the hero's wit a
trifle less active and personal than of old. It was certainly
a fine idea to snatch victory from defeat by engaging the
head of the Militants to speak three lines in the languishing
poetic drama—but somehow I had looked for something
even more startling. However, the quest of the saving
suffragette takes Machin on an amusing dash to New York
(where his experiences, with motors, hotels, and the like,
seem to have been oddly similar to those of Mr. ARNOLD

| | I could hardly tell you
| wild things that happen
| accepting the commis-
optimism of Penelope, for although it has never been my
happy fate to meet such a determinedly plucky and cheerful
woman (or man) in the flesh, it is cheering to read of those
who can never see the clouds because of the rifts in them.
Men in this novel do not amount to very much, if we except
Mr. Tuppy, who by trade was a comedian, but by instinct
seemed to be a professional “turner-up" whenever Penelope
wanted him. Another man, called The Incommu, was well-
named as far as I was concerned, for I never got a clear
conception of him. If, however, Miss Cole has failed a
little with her men, she has succeeded most thoroughly in
drawing the characters of Penelope and her nieces, and I
am glad to recommend the book to those who like to be
mildly intrigued but not violently excited.
Captain Corbeau's Adventure (HUTCHINson) was of the
sort that begins on a snowy night in mediaeval Paris, with
a penniless soldier of fortune, a fair lady, and a mysterious
message. However, the message was but the first of many
mysteries, not the least of which to me was the fact that
what was obviously the
able London gatherings to which no one but unpleasant
people ever seems to be invited, and the glittering and
artificial Eastern scenery in which palms, sunsets and
distant music have so important a place. But, above and
beyond these things, The Way of Ambition (METHUEN)
does make a real attempt to grapple with the psychology of
an artist who has in him a little genius, a little self-con-
fidence and a little humility, but not enough of any of these
qualities to drive him to carve out his career for himself.
Mr. HichENs' hero is not a very attractive character and
his wife is positively unpleasant; but the reader, if he cannot
be honestly interested in Mr. HichBNs' people, is carried
away by the things that happen to them. The final scenes
concerned with the production of an opera in New York are
as noisy, as theatrical, as nerve-shaking as though one were
actually present and personally involved. I hope that in
his next novel Mr. HichENs will, in addition to his deft
technique and brilliant dialogue, give us some characters
who are attractive not only as puppets in a skilful fable but
also as human beings whose histories are not limited by the

creepy things with bats and red-fire in order to frighten a
| young and beautiful maiden into some course of action about
which I am regretfully vague. Indeed, my chief complaint
against the whole affair is that it works up to a breathless
but empty climax, in which, I found myself too muddled
to understand what anybody was doing, or why. Perhaps
this was my own fault. For I can hardly believe that those
| clever persons, Mrs. HUGH FRASER and HUGH FRASER,
whose craft I have before now praised, would wilfully leave
me in such obscurity. Yet I read every word of the book.
Of these, by the way, there are rather less than one expects
of a novel, but quite enough to contain a good florin's
worth (the net price) of swashbuckling , and mystery;
indeed, somewhat less of the latter would have been an
advantage. - -
Mr. HichENs in his new book is concerned with the effect
that an ambitious wife may have upon an unambitious
husband. As is usual with him he is quite frankly occupied
with the sensational thrills to be obtained from his theme
and cares more for the excitement of some situation skilfully
contrived than for the human spontaneity of his characters.
He gives us, of course, some of the properties that he has used
before, and I recognise the mysterious Eastern musician
ponds for love of him,
and he insists on diving in and fishing them out; strong men
mock him and he hurls them out of windows. There is
indeed a general air of unsubdued accomplishment about the
whole environment that put a heavy tax on my credulity.
I scarcely believed that little Alice MacComie, a gay and
pleasant enough young lady, should easily beat, apparently
playing level, the champion of Portrush G.C., and that too
with just a driver and a cleek! Nor did I find either her or
V.V.-Vivid Vivienne, the music-hall star and Sandy's be-
loved—quite as irresistible as alleged passim. Most difficult
of all to believe was the gentleness of Mr. CRoCKETT's quite
astonishing gentlefolk. Indeed I fear that his ready skill
has betrayed him into just writing the first things that came
into his head. It must be noted, for the avoidance of
epidemics, that V.V., having been already twice this season
independently employed as a pet name, is no longer available.

A CENSORIAL SYMPOSIUM.
The action of the libraries in laying a semi-ban on certain
novels has drawn down on us a flood of criticism, comment
and suggestion. We print the following letters as perhaps
the most representative of enlightened public opinion –
ANGEL FACEs.
DEAR SIR,--The notion of banning books on the score of
morality is absurd and a sure sign of reaction. It is
impossible to define morality. Besides we have the positive
assurance of all the authors who have been banned that
their motives are moral and that they are entirely on the
side of the angels, and obviously they know best. Their
photographs prove it. Anything more cherubic than the
countenance of Mr. Max Abel, one of the victims, it would
be impossible to imagine. A man with such a name and
face is no more capable of leading people astray than
Mr. NorMAN ANGELL or
MEAT v. The MILLENNIUM.
DEAR SIR,-Of all the books which injure the community
none are so dangerous as those which inculcate unsound
dietetic principles. The greatest offender of all was DickeNs,
who habitually glorified indulgence in butcher's meat, plum
pudding, turkey and spirits. Under an enlightened Govern-
ment his works would be all placed on an Indez Erpurga-
torius and a ban laid on all-writers who failed, in their
allusions to food, to insist on advocating a fruitarian or
vegetarian regimen. To attack novelists on the score of
morals is to get hold of the wröng'end of the stick. When
men give up meat the Millennium will advance with leaps
and bounds. . . .
I am, Sir, yours faithfully, IEUSTACE SMILEs.
The Right STUFF.
-DEAR SIR,-If we are to boycott books, for Heaven's
sake let it be those which profess to help people instead of
"...# them to help themselves. What we want is men
of backbone and independence, not a race of doormats
Wim and 3Grit,
testimonials as to their valub from Sir Prescott Knight,
the famous actor-manager, Archdeacon Tinkler, and Mr.
‘HARRY THAw, copies of which I enclose. -
Yours faithfully, ERNEST 13LATHERwick.
P.S.–Can you suggest any means by which I could get
my books banned 2. I understand it has a marvellous
effect on their circulation. -
-** * * * *
*
A GoLFER's GRowL.
DEAR SIR,-May I suggest, as the question of restricting
the circulation of undesirable books has now assumed the
dimensions of a conflagration, that a limit should be
placed upon the number of treatises dealing with style
in golf. Personally I should be quite content that not
more than six should be allowed in circulation at the same
time. As matters now stand the members of my family
alone possess eighteen volumes dealing with grip and stance,
with the result that in every instance their handicaps have
been raised. - - Faithfully yours,

AUTUMN MANOEUVRES—THE MOUNTED ORDERLY CORPS.
WE ARE GLAD TO LEARN THAT, IN VIEW OF THE SHORTAGE OF ARMY HoRSES, THE AUTHORITIES ARE AT LAST RISING TO THE
occASION ; see “FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONs,” PART 1, PAR. 20:-“ORDERLIEs . . .
MAY BE MoUNTED on ANIMALs.”
GREAT F00TBALL CONCILIATION
SCHEME.
PROPOSED CoNFERENCE.
IN athletic circles the sole topic of
conversation is the proposal of Lord
Burnlaw to call a Conference for the
purpose of ending the long and distress-
ing antagonism between the Rugby
Union and Association games by con-
sent.
Briefly summarised, the proposals
which he submits as the basis of the
Conference amount to a compromise,
according to which running with the
ball and collaring will be allowed till
within a distance of sixty yards of the
goal on either side, while goals can
only be scored by kicking into the net;
the shape of the ball to be rhomboidal,
and the game to be played in goloshes,
cricket pads and fencing masks.
Provincial, Scottish and Welsh opinion
as expressed in the messages of our
local correspondents shows that there
| is little enthusiasm for the project.
South WALEs.-Leading footballers
| throughout the district regard Lord
Burnlaw's suggestion as wholly im-
practicable. His motives and sincerity
| are not called in question, but it is
| pointed out that the concessions
demanded of either side go far beyond
Ovate Bards are solid in their adhesion
to the oval ball, and Professor Grif-
fiths of the South Wales University
declares that the rhomboidal form
advocated is incompatible with the
genius of Wales.
EveRTON.—Lord Burnlaw's pro-
posals are greeted with modified ap-
proval in the centre of the Toffee indus-
try. The concessions to the Association
game are admitted to be considerable,
but it is strongly held that League
finance would be imperilled by a com-
promise. Alderman Badger is of
opinion that the risks of refereeing
would be greatly increased. As matters
now stand, no referee can insure him-
self at ordinary rates.
LoNDoN.—Mr. Adrian Stoop, the
famous Harlequin, refrains from criti-
cising the scheme until he has seen a
trial game played, but is of opinion
that it would be improved from the
spectacular point of view if the players
wore accordion-pleated shorts and used
a small gas balloon instead of a ball.
DUBLIN.—The proposals are treated
with indifference in Gaelic athletic
circles. If the proposed amalgamation
indicated any approximation to the
rules of Gaelic football, it would be
another matter. Mr. Kickham, a pro-
minent Sinn Fein leader, denounces
hybrid combining all the weaknesses of
two puerile pastimes long discarded
by the virile youth of Erin. Mr.
LARKIN has also expressed his dis-
appointment.
SKIBo.—Mr. Carnegie has addressed
a letter of sympathy to Lord Burnlaw,
expressing his entire approval of a
scheme calculated to mitigate the
brutality of a game which tends to
foster militarism and retard the advent
of international peace.
Another Forthcoming Apology.
“Mrs. Cavendish Bentinck, who had kindly
consented to speak, was prevented from doing
so, and what might have been a dismal failure
turned out a very successful venture.”
The Common Cause.
“Marie Hart, a school girl who turns the
scale at fifteen stone, has been kidnapped from
her home at Galesburg, Illinois.
“It will pay you, when considering any-
thing electrical, to consult T. S.—, Electrical
Engineer and Contractor.”
Burton Daily Mail.

she turned the scale at twenty-five
stone we should havo consulted him.

THE DIVISION.
For the most part of the year I am
on excellent terms with myself, but
in the beginning of September there
always comes the split. There is some-
thing about the mere thought of walk-
ing up partridges which sets me against
myself, puts me beside myself: you
have only to place me in a line of guns
at the bottom of a field of roots and
you have in the clothes and the body
of the one Me two separate individuals,
by no means friendly enough to be so
close to each other.
cians call this a phenomenon, which
gives it an air of importance, and de-
scribe it as the divorce of Mind from
Matter, which adds the romantic touch.
With a word of sympathy for poor old
Matter, I leave it at that.
Mind would behave as becomes a
divorcée and go away al-

for heaven's sake, let us put down the
gun and keep quiet.”
“Beg pardon,” says Matter, a little
upset, “but you'll note we didn't fire.”
“Only because we had the thing on
‘Safe,’” answers Mind angrily. “That's
a clever way of going about things,
isn't it? Do, do let us pull ourselves
together a bit. Suppose that had been
a partridge, how late should we have
been if we ever got off at all? They're
looking at us and beginning to wish
they hadn't . . . Well, well, well. 1"
Matterlooks round hurriedly. “Why,

our gun just like anybody else and

about that, Mind? Pretty bright of
us, wasn't it?—I mean, we did make a
noise, at any rate, didn't we?”
“We weren't much more than half-
an-hour late,” comments Mind with
bitter sarcasm.
Matter takes a deep breath and throws
the chest out. “Next time,” it says
very firmly, “we-are-not-going-to-be-
late. You just wait and see.”
“What's the use of talking like
that?” says Mind. “You know as well
as I do that we are hopelessly incom-
petent.”
“Next time,” repeats Matter, even
more firmly, “next time we-are-not...”
“What's the use of talk-
together it would be so
much easier all round. But
it stays to carp and criticize,
and this year the result has
been worse even than usual.
We—that is, I—took up
our place in the line and
the word was given to
advance. Immediately the
trouble began. “Now
then,” whispered Mind,
“are we ready, are we all
ready? Come, come: it's
no use carrying our gun on
our shoulder; we shan’t be
able to find it when we
want it, and then, of course,
it will be too late. . . . And

pointing to a disappearing
bird.
“Sorry,” says Matter, and
shoots.
“Oh,

real partridge . . .” -
“Next time,” interrupts
|Matter, “we are Not going
to be late. I'm not listening
to you; I'm concentrated
elsewhere.”
“Well, you'd better

it's nothing. All right, go ahead:
what are we waiting for? Do let's
go ahead . . . and don't let's point our
gun down the line; can't we see the

For goodness' sake stop those fingers
clutching the stock nervously; we
must have some of them standing by
to work the triggers.”
“Very good, Sir,” says Matter, mak-
|ing a show of special alertness and
going through the movements. You
may be sure that if a bird had got up
at that particular moment all would
have been well, except with the bird.
But birds are wary, they don't get up
at particular moments.
“Now don't let's get thinking about
the next fellow's spats,” continues Mind,
after an interval. “Anything may
happen at any moment and it's a
thousand to one we shall be too late
for it when it does. We must keep

know. We're just standing still and

Mind, if it can be conceived, shrugs
its shoulders and sniffs in disgust.
“Well, it's too late now,” it says, “and
I suppose we're done for. If we are
paralysed, then we are paralysed and
there's no more to be said about it.
All I'm thinking is that it was a pity
to go and spend three pounds on a
game licence for a paralytic. . . . Sup-
pose we might as well finish the walk

what on earth are we going to do now?”
“Shoot,” says Matter, and shoots.

says Mind. . .
“Ay,” says Matter, “I told you we
weren't going to be late this time.”
“We're early, you juggins,” says Mind.
“Early 2” asks Matter, feeling a sud-
den dread. “But only a second at the

SWALLOWS.
THE train has left the hills behind
And South we're flying fast,

grind,

That holidays are passed;"
And on the humming wires that flow
Between the posts that flit,
Regardless of the G. P. O.
Assembling swallows sit.
They sit, the signal and the sign
Of days of done delight,

A-busking them for flight,

[“The golf craze has been greater this
autumn than in any previous year. Nobody
is quite safe from the fever. It seizes those
who mocked at it, and pays no respect to sex
or age. As a rule, a holiday resort might as
well dispense with food and water as with a
golf course.”
London Letter, “British Weekly.”]
IT should now be possible for resorts
of the smallest attraction, even if they
have never before been considered in
the light of holiday centres, to draw
the custom of visitors. All that has to
be done is to set up a golf course, and,
when the more celebrated links become
overcrowded, as they must soon do, the
opportunity of the new bidders for
custom will come.
SINKCHESTER.—The water supply has
been cut off since May, and water can
now only be obtained by carrying it in
buckets a distance of three miles. This
fact, and not the coal dust with which
the atmosphere of our town is laden,
accounts for the blackened faces of the
thousands of golfers whom our famous
links continue to attract into our midst.
So great is the demand for rooms

that hundreds of well-known players
are content to sleep in the pit workings.

AT THE PLAY.
THE ST. JAMES THEATRE.
EveRYBoDY knows the story of the
little girl who complained that “one
poor lion hadn't got any Christian; ”
I can remember how I laughed—(“Ha,
ha!”)—when I heard it. There is
another good story of Daniel in the
lions' den, not quite so well known;
to the effect that when the King came
to see Daniel in the morning and
asked him how he had got on, Daniel
answered that he had been a little
troubled by lions; to which the King
replied indignantly, “Then you must
have brought them with you.” There
are also current some excellent jokes
about cannibals and missionaries, one
of the most popular being the retort of
the cannibal that, even if he wasn't a
Christian, at any rate he had Christian
blood in his veins. As I said above,
“Ha, ha!” For a joke about anything
so serious as death or religion begins
to be funny even before one tells it;
in the same way that the entrance of
the Vicar's fox-terrier into church starts
one giggling long before it joins its
master in the pulpit.
Mr. SHAw is quite funny in Androcles
and the Lion, but if he had any purpose
other than this I did not see it. Certain
passages in the play seemed to indicate
a view that the early Christian martyrs
were not necessarily brave or good,
but merely proud. At least they died.
Personally, I am quite sure that I

a horrid feeling that if the Bernardus
Shavius of the day had, before entering
the arena himself, tried to persuade me
that I was really the braver man and
the better Christian of the two, I should
not have believed him.
Mr. O. P. HEGGIE was remarkably
good as Androcles, and Mr. Edward
SILLwARD was a delightful lion. They
had a particularly funny turn with the
Emperor (perfectly played by Mr. LEoN
QUARTERMAINE) in the last scene, which
might have well been encored. This
reminds me that Mr. SHAw has just
announced again that he does not like
the audience to indulge in rude laughter
at his plays. I am sorry, but on this
occasion I simply could not help it. If

(A tale of the Duke of WESTMINSTER's

IT is befitting, is it not,
That I should tell you frankly what
Temptations of the baser sort
Beset the devotees of Sport?
Our hero, Herbert Henry Smith,
Was born with muscles, wind and pith
Enough to win the foremost place
With ease in any cycle race.
One object from his boyhood up
Fulfilled his soul—to hunt the cup,
And all the prizes which he won
(No idler he who rode for fun)
He'd realise, invest and lend
And flourish on the dividend.
Such was the man, as you'd expect,
Collectors hastened to collect.
Collecting sportsmen is a line
In which the most expert combine
Discernment, wits, persistence, dash,
With readiness to part with cash.
The early bird, who has in view
The worm it means to cotton to,
Must not rely for its success
Entirely on its earliness,
But, bluffing boldly once or twice,
The victim asks for. Wily worms
Negotiate for stiffish terms.
Was Herbert hired, then 2 Not at all;
He was no low professional.
“I scorn,” said he, “all sordid sums;
But posts in Sports Emporiums,
Remunerative sinecures
Which keep men rich but amateurs,
I might consider. Verb. sap. sat.”
He let the matter stand at that,
Nor later asked what money's worth
Was spent in getting him a berth . . .
And thus we find him at his prime
The leading sportsman of his time,
Secure, by his own competence,
In independent affluence.
Who could foresee for such a blend
Of perfect parts so bad an end?
So hard a bargain did he drive
And with such subtlety contrive
The business side of his affair,
That friends remarked, “You have
the flair
For commerce in your soul, my lad,
If anybody ever had 1"
A little pleased, himself, the fool
Began to find his office stool
A pleasant hobby. Bit by bit
He grew, alas, so fond of it
That more than hobby it became,
To concentrate upon the pot,

Unseen, but strong, temptations lurk;
As some for Drink, so he for Work
Conceived an overwhelming lust,
And left his bicycle to rust!

THE DESCRIPTIVE THEATRE
PROGRAMME.
MR. PUNCH cannot help feeling that
the efforts of the serious school towards
the Brightening of British Drama would
be materially assisted if the depression
induced by some of the more popular
forms of production were dissipated by
means of a descriptive programme,
similar to that in use at concerts. He
respectfully submits a sample of what
he proposes, applied to a drawing-room
comedy obsessed by an actor-manager
with melodramatic tendencies:—
ACT I.
The play opens with a short prelude
of minor characters, during which the
main theme is stealthily introduced.
Some light fluting is interspersed with
a few heavy notes, which gradually
assume the predominance. The motif
is touched upon, and a few incidental
explanations furnished.
This practically comprises the First
Act (or movement); but a climax is
provided by a gradual agitato of all the
subordinate parts, whose tonic value
we now perceive to be at the point of
ment culminates (with a swift series of
arpeggios) in the entrance of the actor-
manager. The minor embellishments
at once fade away as the actor-manager
momentarily strikes the dominant. The
curtain falls. The main theme is not
developed.
ACT II.
This Act is full of movement and
force. The dominant is resumed at the
outset and never relinquished. The
actor-manager takes up the burden of
the heavy notes suggested at the be-
ginning of Act I., and interpolates them
into the main theme, which is now
fully developed. He also imputes the
motif with some vigour.
The strain is temporarily relaxed in
favour of some warblings of a lighter
character, there being no departure
from traditional technique in this
respect. Almost immediately, how-
ever, the main theme is again resumed
by the actor-manager, who, working
infinite variations upon it, leads it up
to a strident climax full of subtle sug-
gestion for the Third Act, the harmonic
minors meanwhile providing a muted
under-movement suitably subservient to
ACT III.
This opens with a brief chorale for
mechanical instruments, an interlude
which is quickly succeeded by a stormy
scena, the sinister character of which
finds the actor-manager quite at his
best. There follows a long and tender
passage, very sweet and contagious,
which the actor-manager sustains on a
lofty note to the running accompani-
ment of the principal lady. Interwoven
with this is the main theme, and from
it is gradually evolved the grand finale,
heralded by the universal entrance of
all the parts.
The grand finale, which is very
effectively interrupted by a fine aria
for the actor-manager, gathers together
all the threads of the main theme,
explains the motif, and finally resolves
itself into an assortment of cumulative
duets, on which the play closes.
“I hope that the gentlemen who worked so
hard last season to put the League in working
order will not be downhearted, but will have
another try, and will keep in mind the old
story of King Alfred and the spider.”

CONCERNING WILLIAM SMITH.
I LIKE William Smith. I do not
know him but I like him. What is
more extraordinary perhaps is that he
evidently knows me intimately and
loves me. Romantic attachments are
rare nowadays.
I met William in this way. On
opening my letters one morning I saw
at the head of a letter an engraving of
a noble, if side-whiskered, face. It
impressed me at once as that of a
kindly, thoughtful gentleman, and I
began to read his letter with interest.
It ran—
turn up but dear old William again.
“This time,” I thought, “I have hurt
the dear fellow. He will surely say
something about that envelope.”
Did he 2 Ah, how I misjudged him.
His letter ran—
MY DEAR MR. Jon Es, Lumbago is
frequently the forerunner of Bright's
disease and diabetes. It means pain,
collapse, prostration, DEATH. There is
only one hope for the sufferer. (Here
William once more wandered to Yuca-
tan.) Consider your wife and family.

Smith never replied? I did think he
would at least have sent a wreath, or
a few stamped envelopes for the widow.
Perhaps he was too overcome to write.
And now that I am defunct (officially)
I have a strange longing to meet
William in the flesh. Suppose some day
I see that thoughtful, side-whiskered
face in the Tube I shall certainly intro-
duce myself. Not, of course, as Jones.
I shall whisper in his ear, “Are you

“Yes, dear me, I ought to know you;

reply, “William, I am the Mexican
MY DEAR SIR,-As a fellow-
sufferer from that intensely
painful complaint, lumbago, I
have pleasure in calling your

Then came a page describing
William's agonizing attack of

brought tears to my eyes), and
an account of the miraculous
herb with which a Mexican
cacique cured him. William,
with great and considerate kind-
ness, offered me the complete

opened a letter and found William
staring at me. I feared he had written
about the little matter of the stamp,
but I did not know the lofty-minded
William. This time he was more inti-
mate. He began—
DEAR MR. Jon Es, From the de-
scription you give of your symptoms
I have no doubt that you are suffer-
ing from lumbago of an aggravated
type.
Then came a little more about Yuca-
tan (William, like many other men, is a
little lengthy in describing his travels),
an offer to send me the complete course
at half-price—fifteen shillings now—
and another stamped envelope.
I used my dear friend's stamp, and
then, such is the ingratitude of man-
kind, I forgot him.
He did not enclose a stamped enve-
lope. I feared my friend had begun to
doubt me. What was I to do? Either
I must send 10s. 6d., and I have a
constitutional objection to parting with
money, or else I must relieve William's
agonizing anxiety about me. It seemed
to me best to end the matter. Better
one sharp shock than corroding care.
So I wrote—
MY DEAR MR. SMITH,-You will, I
am sure, be grieved to hear that your
old friend, Mr. Jones, expired in agonies
of lumbago this morning. His last
words were, “William Smith—Yucatan
—half-price.” I know that this will
be a bitter blow to you. Still you
have this consolation: you warned him
faithfully of his danger.

because fourpence is being deducted,
much against my wish, from my salary
every week, it somehow seemed scarcely
fair to expect him to devote all the
resources of his skill and training to
the business of making me well.

came to visit me in an expensive motor

of me with the minutest care, I felt still
more keenly that my fourpence a week

THE CHILDREN'S GYMKHANA.
It was the man in the white suit who organised the
Children's Gymkhana for us, as he organised nearly every-
thing else that helped to make pleasant our stay in the
Swiss valley. The project, once started, leapt and bounded
towards success. There were no subscriptions. Nobody
went round with a list and offered to make you a Vice-
President for twenty francs or a member of the General
Committee for ten francs, or a full member of the Associa-
tion for five francs. Indeed, there was neither General
Committee nor Association. The man in the white suit
waved his wand, invited a friend or two to luncheon, and,
lo, the Children's Gymkhana 'sprang into vigorous existence.
Of course it was understood that there were to be prizes—
prizes for both sexes and all ages of childhood liberally
interpreted to include boys and girls of fifteen. When once
this great fact of prizes had been grasped a tremendous
excitement began to seethe throughout the valley, and all
sorts of possible competitors set to work to train and
practise. There was a sensible diminution in the receipts
of the tea-shop. For several days cakes of all sorts lay
under a dreadful ban. Cakes with cream in them were held
up to special execration as being “bad for the wind.” An
incautious Swiss roll might easily take an inch or two off
your high jump, and “three-eyed Dick” (our pet name for
an agreeable sort of jam biscuit) would be sure to ruin any-
body's chance for the girls' three-legged race. No sterner
exhibition of the true athletic spirit has ever been seen.
At last the great, the wished-for day arrived in a gor-
geous panoply of sunshine, and the nations began to gather
together on the field of prowess. There were English
children, American children, French children, Dutch child-
ren, Russian children, German children, Belgian children,
a Babel of conflicting tongues and diversified animation, all
held together and reduced to order by the man in the white
suit and his select band of stewards. A jollier or a more
eager crowd could not be met anywhere—this at least was
the opinion of the proud and anxious parents who sat round
the course in various positions of vantage and shouted
polyglot encouragements to their young braves. Dimitri
and Etienne, the sturdy sons of a Colonel in the TsAR's
body-guard, were there; there, too, were Edgar, Arthur and
Lewis, fresh-faced representatives of British boyhood, and
John aged six and Billy aged five, who were to compete in
the race (eighty yards' handicap) for children over five and
under ten, and who now were eyeing one another with a
jealous interest, each computing the athletic points of his
sturdy rival. There were two Peggies and two Betties.
Nancy and Rosie and Joyce and Helen had entered for
most events. Nancy and Rosie are poetesses in their off
moments, but now they were thinking of their feet rather
than their rhymes, and indeed showed a most stubborn and
pedestrian determination to excel in bodily effort. And,
finally, there was our little French friend, “The Blob.”
“The Blob" is a great character, a very round and sturdy
little boy of twelve, in shorts and stockings. His face is
plump and smiling, his body is thick-set, his legs are those
of a conqueror. Good nature and friendliness shine from
him as light shines from the sun, and his temper is imper-
turbablo. His real name is Le Poix, but, when first he
arrived at the tennis courts seeking a game, somebody, see-
ing him, said, “Who's that funny little jolly blob of a
fellow 7" and the name, taken up by the English boys,
whose sworn friend he has become, stuck to him. Now it
is, “Blob, will you make up a four 2" or “Blob, will you
his name comfortably and without a shadow of protest.
He too, as I say, was there to defend the honour of his
nation and to show what élan really means. His efforts in
the high jump were magnificent. He looked like a foot-
ball flung gloriously at the bar—which, by the way, was
a string weighted with a tennis ball at either end. “The
Blob" did his best, but a tall youngster of fourteen from
Haileybury proved too much for him and everybody else.
Splendid, too, was the race for girls over ten and under
twelve. They got away to a capital start, but soon strung
out. They tore round the course, their hair streaming in
the wind, so many comets unpredicted by KEPLER or
HALLEY, until at last the Peggy comet gleamed to the
front in a panting spurt and won the desperate race. Other
encounters, too, there were, and, for diversion, we had a
three-legged race and an egg-and-spoon race. Never were
beheld such complicated falls as the three-legged race
provided. It is a marvel that any limbs survived unbroken.
The two poetesses, securely bound together and thundering
along like two young Clydesdales turned out to grass, came
through their shattered rivals and carried off the double
prize. As for the egg-and-spoon race, I need only say that
the eggs were mercifully made of chalk. Otherwise the
course must have been converted into an omelette d l'herbe,
a Gargantuan omelette fifty yards long by ten wide!
All this time the organiser of victory, the CARNot in the
white suit, was, as it seemed, in every part of the field,
planning, ordering and executing with a busy vigour that
assured success. And near the middle of the course, at a
table, sat a kind lady having at her feet a large box con-
taining the prizes. These she allotted as the sports went
on, selecting for each event the particular prize which she
thought would be most acceptable to the winners. Thus
every winner was delighted when at last the distribution
came. Indeed it seemed to be a magic box, inexhaustible
in appropriate prizes, so that, when all the firsts and seconds
had been satisfied, there still remained consolation prizes
for nearly all the rest. We wound up a memorable cosmo-
politan day with cheers for everybody, including three of
the best for the man in the white suit. R. C. L.

No, Sir, the whole proposition
smacks (to use an appropriate expres-

hand, if you choose to show sufficient
foresight as to open a fund, yourself,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE DIFFICULTIES OF BEING
A MOTHER.
WHEN Eustace and Adeline came to
us, aged three months and very weak
on their legs, they cost seventeen-
and-sixpence, with a shilling extra for
packing, and we thought them very
dear at the price. That is a year ago.
Now Adeline is an older and a sadder
duck.
It happened this way. When the
shiny days came of the opening year,
Adeline made up her mind to have a
family. She took to absenting herself
mysteriously, and one day we found
six greeny eggs in quite a nice place.
The six became eight, and the eight
ten, and the ten twelve, and we began
to ask anxiously whether Adeline didn't
consider it any part of her duty to sit
on them. When she had made it
thirteen, for luck, she made it clear
that she didn't, by becoming quite
regular for meals again; so we took
away her eggs and gave them to a
broody hen. The broody hen had the
tomato-house to herself for three weeks
and five days, during which she never
moved except when we moved her to
see how the eggs were getting on, and
on the sixth day in the fourth week,
towards evening, she was rather sud-
denly found to be sharing it with nine
active ducklings, who didn't surprise
her in the least. But what was our
heroine doing all this time 2 Well, if
you must know, our heroine had started
all over again on another family, in a
new place. I suppose she took a dislike
to the first lot, or to the first place, or
something. At least, those were the
theories. But Eustace or somebody
must have told her that she had
left out the most important part, for
this time she took her job much more
seriously. She only came off it once a
day, at five o'clock precisely, and then
we always thought she would choke
herself, because all the time she ate she
fairly screamcd with self-importance
and anxiety to be off, or I suppose I
should say to be on. I should also tell
you that she had stopped at six this
time; I suppose Eustace had suggested
moderation.
And now for purposes of clearness I
shall have to speak of Family Number
Two and Family Number One. Even
then it is as complicated as a novel by
ARNoLD BENNETT. For one morning,
at breakfast time, at the end of the
third week and the fifth day, Adeline
came paddling down the river with a
perfect little flotilla, all asking if break-
fast was ready. It wasn't quite perfect,
though, because there were only five
in the squadron, and as there was
nest she must have lost one on the
way down to breakfast. The armada
suffered another loss directly after break-
fast. It happened like this: obeying
her instinct to take her family to the
finest possible pastures, she set off down
the river ever so far, and when she
came back she had only four. I think
she must have noticed something this
time, because Eustace was sent off in
a great hurry downstream, and , he
didn't come back until the evening, but
he hadn't found anything.
And now, reader, we must go back a
little and see for a moment what Family
Number One is doing. (You remember
—the nine.) It is being sat upon by
its foster-mother. But what is this?
How unaccountably has it dwindled !
Yes, they all lived for a week, and then,
whether it was that with years of dis-
cretion came questioning doubts as to
whether the broody hen really was their
mother or whether their house wasn't
so good for little ducks as it was for
little tomatoes, one by one thcy took to
dying, quite regularly, one a day, almost
as though someone had told thcm the
story of the nigger-boys. On the day
before the Second Family’s “arrival,
Adeline's First Family was down to two.
And she had never seen it! From her
subsequent conduct I imagine, if she had
seen it, she would have regarded the
whole thing as a great mistake. She
would have taken the line that she
didn't ever mean that first lot to be a
family, because she had thought of a
better one.
It is time to say that this is going to
be a tragedy. It is going to have a
Recognition scene, just like EURIPIDEs,
and then it is going to end in the most
complete and utter tragedy. But before
that comes there is going to be one
happy scene, so you may read a little
further. Adeline's Second Family
arrived on a Saturday, and the next
day was a Sunday—the first of the real
shiny Sundays. You should have seen
her with that Second Family Eustace
took himself off for the whole day;
I suppose he felt he had done as much
the day before as could be reasonably
expected of him. She was as happy
with the four of them and as pleased
with herself as though four was the
perfect number and she had taken great
pains to trim it down to four. She
dived, and the four dived, she went
ashore and cleaned herself, and the four
went ashore and cleaned themselves,
and then she sat and just looked at
them in the sunshine while they chased
the water-spiders who were enjoying
their own little day. We prepared the
scene of confrontation. There were two
ducklings of her own flesh and blood,
weeks in the tomato house. But, bless
you, Adeline gave one look at the bank,
where a great clucking was coming
from, and decided that it was no wonder
a mother like that had such hideous
little children. She wouldn't have
anything to do with them. The recog-
nition scene had been a failure. ,
All that day we said at intervals to one
another that if their life was going to
be a short one it had been merry
anyhow. The next morning they were
still four. They ate their breakfast as
usual. In the evening three little
bodies were high-and-dry in some thick
Scum where the fish-net is, and Adeline
was looking surprised to have only one.
I suppose she had obeyed those instincts
of hers again and taken her family to a
perfectly splendid pasture which had
choked three of them. I don't think ||
she noticed anything seriously wrong
until the next morning. Eustace (who
had turned up again, looking not quite
sober), and she and it were taking
breakfast together. Now I must intro-
duce you to Jack Hearne. There is
nothing irrelevant in this; he is not the
Middlesex bowler; he is a heron, and
that is his proper name in this county.
Before this fatal Tuesday I should have
introduced him to you as a tame heron.
Now it is impossible. For Jack Hearne,
walking past on the way to his own
breakfast, finished off Adeline's Second
Family at a mouthful. We think, we
like to think, it was a mistake on his
part. Herons will act so rashly. But
that doesn't bring back Adeline's
Second Family. She finished her
breakfast and turned round and dis-
tinctly noticed it had gone. Her grief
is terrible. We don't think she would
have noticed anything wrong if Jack |
Hearne had left her with her one. But ||
now she sits all day on the river-bank ||
and refuses to be comforted. -
You will notice that this is an almost
perfect tragedy because there is the
element of hope left at the end. For-
timbras and Horatio, of her First Family,
still live. Will she ever recognise them,
or will she go on mistaking them for
chickens, until, taking heart, she begins |
her own task of motherhood all over
again? We do not know; we only |
know that we do not any longer think

with the addition of a shilling extra for ||

WHAT I chiefly felt about With Drums Unmuffled (MILLs
AND Boon) was that it was the work of an author with a
considerable gift of expression, much charm of manner, and
(here at least) insufficient matter upon which to employ it.
L. A. BURGEss gives upon the title-page no indication of
sex, but I will make a bold shot for it that the writer is
feminine. Her title itself—at first somewhat obscure—has
reference to the military practice of marching back from a
funeral to the accompaniment of some lively tune. There
is indeed a pleasantly service atmosphere about the whole of
the simple tale, which concerns the life and mild loves of a
group of persons stationed at Gibraltar. There are two
heroines, the young army nurse who tells the stoly, and
Susan Pickle, the country-bred nursery-maid of Major
Tracey's little daughter. Each has her romance, that of
the former running so uneventfully smooth a course that
the author has been forced to fret it with quite the thinnest
and most artificial misunderstanding that I ever remember.
..] Susan's is a different affair; she is indeed far the most
clearly individualised character in the book, and her devotion
to the unworthy cad whom she loves is told with a sympathy
that makes me expect considerable things from L. A.
BURGESs in the future. For the present, however, she has
written just a mildly pleasant tale, one that may be gently

Mr. NEviNson's Essays in Rebellion (NISBET) are con-
cerned with all manner of vital things that divide serious
folk, from war to the hunger of the poor. It is a gallant
little book such as might be expected from one who has
taken his life in his hands in sundry quixotries of the last
twenty odd years. There are two keynotes. One from
Goethe: “For myself, I am happy enough. Joy comes
streaming in upon me from every side. Only, for others,
I am not happy.” The other is contained in the parable of
“The Catfish,” which serves as the first of the essays. Now
the catfish used to be put in the tanks of the East Coast
fishing boats in order that his lively and stimulating activi-
ties should keep the cod in health, which else were observed
to fall torpid and arrive for market flabby and unwholesome.
Mr. NEvinson is an excellent catfish, a genuine rebel radical
with opinions cut to no mere party pattern. He pours out
a fine scorn on the complacent type that welcomes rebellion
—after the successful event. For himself he is content to
be champion of all unpopular causes, of all subject peoples.
This very consistency of his attitude is a defect of his
generous qualities. He sees life too symmetrically, as a
matter of sheep and goats in their divided pens. For in-

become a combined war between the classes of various
countries between whom there is a feeling of sympathy and
common interest.” And this sentence involves a good deal
of what is most characteristic in the thought of this latter-
day rebel. There are many good things in this book, grave
and gay. It is really a compliment to the author to note
that the grave are the more effective. Most of all I would
commend “The Heroine,” some extremely apposite thoughts
concerning FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE, to those who have the
temperamental hatred of new things.

she merely gets in the way, and, every time there is a
sudden loud knock at the lodging-house door, it is only her
tiresome lover come for a purpose no more sinister than to
pay his irrelevant respects. I was not allowed to be present
at any of the murders; I was not even introduced to one of
the murdered; how then can I be expected to say a kind
word for a murderer who was not suspected or arrested and
did not cause anyone else to be suspected or arrested in his
stead? I regret to have to add that the author who has so
trifled with my affection for the gruesome is no other than
my admired Mrs. BELLoc-LowNDEs.

customers to settle down to bibulous evenings. The Old
Time Before Them neither harms nor improves its author's
reputation, and doubtless it will provide a fund of amuse-
ment for those who are not weary of the shrewd sayings
and rather grim humour of the Dartmoor natives.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
*| THE ORDER of THE BATH.
“WE must really do something about
the bath,” said Celia.
“We must,” I agreed.
At present what we do is this.
Punctually at six-thirty or nine or
whenever it is, Celia goes in to make
herself clean and beautiful for the new
day, while I amuse myself with a razor.
After a quarter-of-an-hour or so she
gives a whistle to imply that the bath-
room is now vacant, and I give another
one to indicate that I have only cut
myself once. I then go hopefully in
and find that the bath is half-full of
water; whereupon I go back to my
room and engage in Dr. HUGH pe
SELINcourt's physical exercises for the
middle-aged. After these are over I
take another look at the bath, discover
that it is now three-eighths full, and
| return to my room and busy myself with
| Dr. ARCHIBALD MARSHALL's mental
| drill for busy men. By the time I
iſ have committed three Odes of HoRACE
to memory, it may be low tide or it
| may not; if not, I sit on the edge of
| the bath with the daily paper and read
| about the latest strike—my mind occu-
|ipied equally with wondering when the
| water is going out and when the 'bus-
men are. And the thought that Celia
is now in the dining-room eating more
than her share of the toast does not
console me in the least. -
“Yes,” I said, “it’s absurd to go on
like this. You had better see about it
to-day, Celia.” - sº * -- - -
“I don't think—I mean, I think—
you know, it's really, your turn to do
something for the bath-room.” :
“What do you mean, my turn ?
Didn't I buy the glass shelves for it?
You'd never even heard of glass
shelves.” ºf
“Well, who put them up after they 'd ||
been lying about for a month 2" said
Celia. “I did.” . . . . . . . .
“And who bumped his head against
them the next day? I did.”
“Yes, but that wasn't really a useful
thing to do. It's your turn to be useful.”
“Celia, this is mutiny. All house-
hold matters are supposed to be looked
after by you. I do the brain-work; I
earn the money; I cannot be bothered
with these little domestic worries. I
have said so before.” - -
“I sort of thought you had.”
You know, I am afraid that is true.
We are, indeed, often having these
little arguments as to whose turn it is
to be useful. We had one about Jane's
insurance card. Celia got it in the end,
but only after I had been very firm
about it.
“After all,” she said, “the drinks are
“Hock, perhaps,” I said; “soapy
water, no. There is a difference.”
“Not very much,” said Celia.
By the end of another week I was
getting seriously alarmed. I began to
fear that unless I watched it very care-
fully I should be improving myself too
much. - ** *
“While the water was running out
this morning,” I said to Celia, as I
started my breakfast just about lunch-
time, “I got Paradise Lost off by heart
and made five hundred and ninety-six
revolutions with the back paws. And
then I had to shave myself again.
What a life for a busy man "
“I don't know if you know that it's
no—”
“Begin again,” I said.
“—that it's no good waiting for
the last inch or two to go out by itself.
Because it won't. You have to — to
hoosh it out.”. - - -
'." I do. And I sit on the taps looking
like a full moon and try to draw it out.
But it's no good. We had a neap tide
to-day and I had to hoosh four inches.
Jolly.”
Celia gave a sigh of resignation.
“All right,” she said, “I’ll go to the
plumber to-day.” *
“Not the plumber,” I begged. “On
the contrary. The plumber is the man
who stops the leaks. What we really
want is an unplumber.” . . . .
- - - - j
We fell into silence again. --
“But how silly we are "cried Celia
suddenly. “Of course!”
“What's the matter now?”
“The bath is the landlord's business!
Write and tell him.” -
“But--but what shall I say?” Some
how I knew Celia would put it on to
‘me. . . * --
“Why, just—say. When you're pay-
ing the rent, you know.”
“I—I see.” • * - -
I retired to the library and thought
it out. I hate writing business letters.
The result is a mixture of formality and
chattiness which seems to me all wrong.
My first letter to the landlord went
like this:—
“DEAR SIR,--I enclose cheque in
payment of last quarter's rent. Our
bath won't run out properly. Yours
faithfully.”
It is difficult to say just what is
wrong with that letter, and yet it
| is obvious that something has hap-
pened to it.
It isn't right. I tried
again.
“DEAR SIR,-Enclosed please find
cheque in payment of enclosed account.
I must ask you either to enlarge the exit
to our bath or to supply an emergency
door. At present my morning and
evening baths are in serious danger of
My third attempt had more sting in
it:—
“DEAR SIR,-Unless you do some-
thing to our bath I cannot send you a

Otherwise I would have. Yours faith-

At this point I whistled to Celia and
laid the letters before her.

“But you're so abrupt,” she said.

I tried again, with this result— :

THE prominence attached to a recent

an agriculturalist has elicited a digni-
| fied and striking letter of protest from
| Mr. Boldero-Bamborough (formerly
| Bamberger), the famous violinist, who
| has recently incorporated his father-in-
law's name with his own and slightly
| modified the latter by deed poll. “I
| see it stated,” observes Mr. Boldero-
| Bamborough, “that CARUso is the pos-
| sessor of several large estates in
| Tuscany, including º farms at
| Bellosguardo; that he is building an
art gallery in the eighteenth-century
style to house his collection of statuary,
and that another of his country houses
is surrounded by sixteen farms, each
containing a piano.

from this statement is that such
prosperity is exceptional in a musician.
noble profession to which I am proud
to belong. Loath as I am to obtrude
my personal affairs on the public—not
only from my own ingrained aversion
from advertisement but in view of the
fastidious self-suppression of my wife,
née Polyxena Boldero, and my father-
in-law, Sir Pompey Boldero, F.R.S.L.
—I have no choice but to make known
the following facts:—
“My property includes an estate of
5,000 square miles in New Guinea, a
rubber plantation in the Solomon
Islands, a mine in Alaska, an elephant
ranche in Central India, a deer forest
in Sutherlandshire, a tobacco farm in
Tipperary, and fifty farms in Norfolk.
The management of the latter I keep
under my own supervision, the pro-
duce including thousands of tons of
tomatoes, turkeys, Bombay ducks,
milk from the cocoa-nut plantations,
broad beans from the Broads and
many thousands of gallons of goose-
berry wine. I think it only right to
add that not only is there a cottage
that every cow-byre is fitted with a
pianola and every pig-sty with a
gramophone.
“At my residence, Bamborough
Towers, near Thetford, there are three
butlers, fourteen footmen, thirty-six

“My silver swimming-bath measures

decorated with porphyry columns, with
a ceiling painted by SIGISMUND GoFTZE,
is the largest in the world. My press-
cutter is an M.A. and Litt.D.
“I feel it necessary to repeat, though
it is most painful to me to do so, that
my father-in-law is Sir Pompey Boldero,
F.R.S.L., whose name is a household
word in the most fashionable salons
of Mayfair.

[SEPTEMBER 24, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE wingED victory.
THE question is, What becomes of
the mosquito when you are hunting
for him? (I say “he,” although, of
course, there are supporters of the
theory that mosquitoes are Militants.
But I know he is a he, and I know his
name, too: it is, for obvious reasons,
Macbeth.)
This is my procedure. I undress,
then I put on a dressing-gown and
slippers, and, lifting the mosquito cur-
tains, I place the candle inside -
them on the bed. Then, with
the closest scrutiny, I satisfy
myself that there is no mosquito
inside, as indeed Eleanora, the
handmaid, had done some hours
earlier, when she made the bed.
“Niente, miente,” she had assured
me, as she always does. None
the less, again I go carefully
round it, examining the net for
any faulty hanging which might
let in an insect ascending with
malice from the floor.
This being done, I creep
through, blow out the candle
and go to sleep.
I have slept perhaps an hour
when a shrill bugle call, which
I conceive in my dreams to be
the Last Trump, awakens me,
and as I awake I realise once
again the melancholy fact that
it is no Last Trump at all but
that there is, as there always is,
a mosquito inside the curtains.
Already he has probably bitten
me in several places; at any cost
he must be prevented from biting
me again. I sit up and feel my
face all over to discover if my
beauty has been assailed; for
that is the thing I most dread.
(Without beauty what are we?)
I lie quite still while I do this,
straining to catch his horrid song"—
again; and suddenly there it is so near
that I duck my head swiftly, nearly
ricking my neck in doing so.
This confirming my worst fears, there
is nothing for it now but to lift the
curtains, slip out on to the cold stone
floor, light the candle, and once again
go through the futile but necessary
movement of locating and expelling a
mosquito.
That there will be none to expel, I
know. - - - -
None the less I crawl about and
peer into every corner. I shake the
clothes, I do everything that can be
done short of stripping the curtains,
which I am too sleepy to do. And
then I blow out the candle for the
second time and endeavour to fall asleep
worst, and I turn no hair.
But this time it is more difficult:
Macbeth has performed his pet trick
too thoroughly. At last, however, I
drowse away, again to be galvanised sud-
denly into intense vigilance of dread by
the bugle shrilling an inch from my ear.
And so once again I get up and once
again the pest vanishes into nothing. . . .
The next time I don't care a soldo if
he is there or not, I am so tired; and
the rest of the night is passed in a
half-sleep, in which real mosquitoes or
imaginary mosquitoes equally do their
OUR BARBER TAKES UP GARDENING.
And then,
some years later, the blessed day dawns
and another Italian night of misery has
passed; and, gradually recognising this
bliss, I sit up in bed and begin to tear
away at the fresh poison in my poor
hands and wrists, which were like
enough to a map of a volcanic island
in the Pacific yesterday, but now are
poignantly more so.

am conscious of a motionless, black
speck on the curtain above me. . . .
It is—yes—no—yes—it is Macbeth.
I agitate the gauze, but he takes no
notice; I approach my hand, a move-
ment which in his saner moments he
would fly from with the agility of
electricity; he remains still. He is
I examine him minutely and observe
him to be alive, and the repugnant
truth is forced upon me that he is not
merely drunk but drunk with my blood.
That purple tide is alcoholic; and his
intemperance has been his ruin.
There is only one thing to be done.
I have no paltry feelings of revenge;
but his death is indicated. The future
must be considered. And so I kill him.
It is done with the greatest ease. He
makes no resistance at all, but merely,
while dying, salutes me with my own
blood. It is odd to have it thus
spread before one.

get up, feeling no triumph.
Then, going to the glass, I
discern a red lump on my aris-

THE CURTAIN-RAISER.
SIR,-The discussion raised
by the recent substitution at a
West End theatre of variety
turns for the usual first piece is
being briskly maintained. One
writer in the Press claims that
it should surely be possible for
the dramatist to invent some
means by which the interest of
his play can be so divided as to
be enjoyed by late arrivals, no
matter at what period of the
action they take it up. May I,
as a writer of many one-act
plays, respectfully put forward
my proposed solution of this
problem? On a system of
equable exchange it is frankly
borrowed from the music halls.
The essence of the idea is a

ations in the curtain-raiser.
reaching his stall all that the fashion-
ably tardy spectator has to do is to
consult his watch, refer to the cor-
responding time on the programme,
and be at once en rapport with the
dramatic position. What could be
more simple? I call my proposal the
“You Can Start Now” system, and
am confident that it only needs to be
tried to be generally adopted. An
example is enclosed.

:
THE AUTHORS’ STRIKE.
THE action of the libraries in placing a modified ban on
the circulation of certain novels has led to an unexpected
development. Yesterday morning the leaders of the Authors'
Union, after a sitting which had lasted all through the
night, decided by an overwhelming majority to advise their
members to down tools. The advice was instantly followed.
At 10 A.M. Mr. John GALsworthy threw his inkstand, his
penholders and three boxes of “J” nibs out of the window
into the street below, where they were picked up and
secreted by an admirer of the novelist. At the same hour
Sir GILBERT PARKER publicly burnt his typewriting machines
and dismissed his corps of typists, while Mr. ARNOLD BEN-
NETT, after having torn into twenty strips his relief map of
the Five Towns, put on his fur coat, entered his motor-car,
and set off to Hampstead to join a peaceful picket organised
and commanded by Mr. W. B. MAxwell. Similar scenes
were witnessed in most of the novel-factories of the Metro-
polis and the adjoining suburbs. The female section of the
Union has been very busily employed in arranging pro-
cessions and embroidering banners. Some of these are of
a most tasteful design. One bears the words, “No more
Mud from Mudie,” surrounded by a laurel wreath. Another
is emblazoned with an excellent and terror-striking portrait
of Mr. HALL CAINE set in the midst of a circle of realistic
flashes of lightning. Below this is the appeal (red letters
on a black ground), “Who would be Free must smash
Class B.” -
The strike, it should be stated, is not primarily directed
against the publishers, but it is difficult to see how these
can remain neutral. Mr. John MURRAY, interviewed by
our representative, declared that he sympathised warmly
with the Libraries. The strikers, in his opinion, have com-
mitted a serious mistake and must fail for lack of funds.
None of his own men, he says, has so far shown any
intention of ceasing work, and he believes himself to be in
a position to guarantee a regular supply of all sorts of books
during the autumn. On the other hand Mr. John LANE,
when interviewed in Vigo Street, expressed himself in severe
terms in regard to the rash action of the Libraries. He
ridiculed the idea that strike pay will not be forthcoming.
Mr. LANE thought the public did not, perhaps, sufficiently
appreciate the fact that there were two sexes in the
world.
At 4 P.M. a mass meeting was held in Trafalgar Square,
which was packed with a huge crowd of prosperous and
well-fed strikers. On the outskirts a brisk business was
done by the sellers of Mr. HALL CAINE's autograph, count-
less specimens of which found purchasers at the starvation
price of a guinea apiece. After Mr. A. C. BENson had been
voted to the base of Nelson's column much enthusiasm was
caused by the appearance of a contingent of sympathetic
poets headed by Mr. John MASEFIELD, who brought with
him in a covered van a newly-arrived consignment of briny
oaths and a sailor's glossary in ten volumes. It was stated
that Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPs, Mr. LASCELLEs ABERCROMBIE
and Mr. EzRA Pound had intended to be present, but a
sudden attack of afflatus, a most distressing illness to which
they are occasionally liable, had confined them to their
homes. All three, however, sent a message expressing
warm sympathy with the movement and pledging them-
selves to abstain from the publication of verse until the
demands of the men were conceded. “We may not,” they
wrote, “be able to control the poetic impulse so far as to
prevent ourselves from thinking in metre, but we shall
certainly write nothing down.” This declaration, when
read to the meeting, was received with loud cries of “The
When calm had been sufficiently restored Mr. A. C.
BENSON, standing on a platform constructed entirely out of
books written by himself, opened the proceedings. It was
not for him, he said, to pass any harsh judgment even on
the proprietors of circulating libraries. What they had
done spoke for itself. A wrong had been committed, and, as
the Bishop of Kamschatka once observed to him, wrong must:
be righted before anything valuable could be undertaken."
He (the speaker) had not read the books complained of, but
that very fact made it possible for him to take an impartial
view. Moderation was all very well, but even those whose :
lives were a round of limpid tranquillity could join with
others who were moved to action by a sense of intolerable
oppression. He had much pleasure in proposing a reso-
lution pledging those present to support the strike by a
voluntary royalty of fifteen per cent. on the selling price of
their books, thirteen to count as twelve, together with ten
per cent. on American and Colonial sales.
At this point Mr. BERNARD SHAw drove up in a Roman
chariot. He was closely guarded on one side by Mr. G. K.
CHESTERTON, mounted on a Suffolk Punch, and on the
other by Mr. HILAIRE BELLoc, who rode a horse stated to
have been purchased from a French battery of artillery.
Mr. SHAw, having removed Mr. BENsoN from the chair,
proceeded to describe himself as a martyr, but was himself |
immediately flung from the platform by Mr. BELLoc, who
danced on him, and Mr. CHESTERTON, who fell on him.
Mr. BELLOC then attempted to propose a resolution con- ||
demning Judaism in politics, while Mr. CHESTERTON de- |
nounced the Insurance Act, and the meeting broke up in
indescribable confusion.
Later.—It is reported that some of the publishers, acting
in concert with the Libraries, have decided to import three
hundred American novelists of both sexes in order to break
the strike. Pickets have been sent to all the ports to per-
suade these blacklegs to return to their own country, and
the worst is feared.

A TEST CASE.
AT the Central Criminal Court, before
Mr. Justice DARLING and a Special
Jury, George Duncan (thirty), who gave
his address as Hanger Hill, Ealing,
pled not guilty to the charge that,
at Muckle Brighrae, N.B., he had
wickedly and feloniously broken a
valuable record, the property of Alex-
ander Sanders Elshioner Cattanach,
commission agent in Glasgow. Owing
to the exasperation of public sentiment
in Muckle Brighrae and adjacent parts
of Scotland, it had been deemed ex-
pedient to remove this case to a calmer
atmosphere, and Mr. Justice DARLING
consented to preside, on receiving a
hearty and unanimous requisition
signed by the Press Association and
other eminent news agencies. The
Special Jury was composed of six
minor golf professionals, and the
amateur champions of the South-
West of Ireland, Bohemia, East Rut-
landshire, Buganda, Bessarabia and
St. Kilda.
Mr. MARSHALL HALL, K.C., who
prosecuted, had objected to JAMEs
TAYLOR as jurors, on the ground that
they had been accessories before, during,
and after the alleged offence. They
were accommodated in the well of the
court, which was free from casual
water. The court was crowded, and
Mr. Justice DARLING explained at the
outset that if anybody laughed before
he, the learned Judge, came to the
point of a joke it would be necessary
to have it—the court, not the joke
(loud laughter)—instantly cleared. Mr.
F. E. SMITH, K.C., appeared for the
accused. The Provost of Muckle Brig-
brae held a watching brief for himself
and the Publicity Committee of the
Muckle Brighrae Town Council.
Mr. Alexander Sanders Elshioner
Cattanach said in evidence that he was
the holder of the record which the
accused had broken. He had acquired
the record—a 72—six years ago, and
with any ordinary luck it would have
been a 70, two full brassie shots having
stopped on the lip of the hole. Though
he did not know the accused personally,
he believed that Duncan had a grudge
against him, for two years ago he had
attempted to break complainer's record,
Magistrate. “How Is THAT 2"
Duncan had gono back to Muckle Brig-
brae, and by going round in 67 had
broken complainer's record and made
it of absolutely no value as a family
heirloom, and totally useless to com-
plainer as an asset in the commission
business. As a consequence of Dun-
can's conduct witness's orders had
already fallen 35 per cent, and he was
now seeing managing-clerks instead of
principals. He would lose by Duncan's
conduct socially as well as in his busi-
ness. He had been known among his
friends as Brigbrae Cattanach, but they
used that name now in a jeering way.
Men who used to take a third from him
now wanted to play him level. This
was a serious matter for any business
man in the West of Scotland.

Mr. SMITH. A stymie, m' lud, is the
fortuitous juxtaposition of two balls on
the putting green, so that the one
nearer the hole is in line with and
obstructs the path of the ball further
from the hole, it being essential to the
emergence of the condition of stymie-
faction that the balls should lie more than
six inches from each other, measured
from the nearest protrusion or depres-
sion on the circumference of each ball.
[At this point JAMES BRAID fainted
and had to be carried out of court
by THOMAS BALL and JoHN HENRY

locking grip.
Mr. SMITH, I submit, m' lud, that
there is no case to go to the jury. The
alleged Cattanach record, upon which
the charge against my client depends,
itself depends upon evidence that is
partly fraternal and partly venal and
accused joined them, the Provost of
Muckle Brigbrae, producing a copy
of “Funny Cuts" from his um-

take a seat on the Bench, and at
once consented to do so.
Mr. MARSHALL HALL. M'lud, I am
pleased to say that the prisoner has
consented, on the advice of his pro-
fessional friends, to plead guilty to an
error of judgment, and in these circum-
stances, and in view of the undertaking
which I have obtained from himself
and his friends, the Crown will not
press for a conviction. (Loud applause.)
I may say that I welcome this con-
clusion to proceedings which have been
conducted, so far as the defence is
concerned, with the scrupulous fairness
and moderation in statement which
are so characteristic of my friend.
Mr. SMITH, I have to thank my
friend for sentiments which I heartily
reciprocate. My client is willing to
admit that in going round the course
and his professional brethren
should abstain from playing at all on the
championship courses of South-West
Ireland, Bohemia, East Rutlandshire,
Buganda, Bessarabia and St. Kilda.
Mr. Justice DARLING.. I shall for-
ward this recommendation to the pro-
per quarter. The accused is discharged.

lated on stepping down from the

excitement was aroused by the
eccentric behaviour of an Aberdo-

Until, the grand finale gained,
It wound up rather well.
Then to a neighbouring typist-maid,
Well pleased I took my lay,
And, being in a hurry, stayed
To bring the lines away.
And she my precious bantling bore
Where other maidens wrought,
And, through the half-closed inner door,
I watched her; till I thought—
“This must be quite a change for her
Whom dull MSS. irk,
Not often thus can wit confer
Such glamour on her work.”
And so I stood, and looked to see
How, in this pleasant case,
My sparkling points should presently
Irradiate her face.
But not so ; even when she came
Where they most brightly shone,
Just near the end, 'twas all the same—
Stolid she hammered on.
“Ah, wait,” I thought, “that last line

But up she jumped, and all she said

IT is possible that the question
whether Leonora, the heroine of one of
| Sir JAMEs BARRIE’s new plays, should
have murdered the man who insisted
on the railway carriage window being
kept open, will be a topic for discussion
for some time to come. The Pall Mall
Gazette is emphatically of opinion that
some other and less serious crime should
have been committed, the capital charge
being hardly suitable for comic treat-
ment. And it is certainly the case
that, had Leonora committed larceny
or forgery, or even blackmail, instead
of murder, there might have been a
happier laughter inspired by the play.
At the same time, for another person
to keep a railway carriage window open
when one wants it closed is a serious
offence and merits a severe punishment.
It is only equalled by that of a person
who closes the window when one par-
ticularly wants it open.
On the other hand a correspondent
writes: “Leonora did a great wrong.

little daughter, who was suffering
from a severe cold, was an unhappy
error. I have it on the authority of
the medical press that for a cold,
especially bronchial catarrh, fresh air
is the only adequate specific. I do not
know whether Sir JAMEs BARRIE makes
it clear that the child was suffering
from bronchial catarrh, but, unless he
definitely states that it was another
kind of cold, I think that we may
assume that the malady took that form.
When the little girl got home she
would have found that the open win-
dow had greatly benefited her. It was
a pity, therefore, that Leonora pushed
her child's would-be benefactor on to
the line.”
Another correspondent, whose views
are different, writes: “Every morning
I have the misfortune to travel to town
with a man whose obstinacy causes me
support Leonora heartily in her action.
My only criticism is that a better
victim might have been found.”
A third writes: “But was it murder?
The man wanted fresh air, and to that
end he kept the window open. Leo-
mora, being an intelligent woman (the
author, I think, makes that fairly clear),
argued that he would have still more
fresh air if the door also were open,
and for his good she opened the door.
A little further contemplation (it was,
but the work of a moment) caused her
to conclude that the lover of fresh air
would find more outside the door than
in the carriage. She, therefore, acted
for his good.”

A ROGUE IN GRAIN. amacher experts' Come now, sir, then 2" was all I said.
I stood for some time outside the
dealer's shop, displaying an altogether
fictitious interest in its altogether
fictitious antiques. At intervals of five
minutes 1 swallowed a dose of tonic in
tabloid form. Finally I pulled myself
together and went in.
“I have come,” I said to the pro-
prietor, “about that chair which I
bought.”
If I had any romantic notion that he
would behave like Macbeth at the sight
of Banquo's ghost, I was promptly
brought back to earth.
“That Chippendale chair,” he
amended briskly. “Yes, Sir. You sent
it back. I have it in the yard if you
want to look at it again.”
I didn't ever want to look at it again.
The thing was a fake. An expert had
told me so. . . . But I wanted its
former owner to be confronted with it,
so I followed him into the yard, hating
him immensely. He had what he him-
self might have described as a bow
front and baroque features. Also, I
knew that he knew that he knew far
more about antiques than I did.
But I had been told quite positively
that the chair was a fake. . . .
He looked at it tenderly.
“As nice a article o' furniture as any
gentleman could wish to 'ave in his
library,” he apostrophized it.
I produced his invoice.
“Genuine eighteenth-century Chip-
pendale arm-chair,” I read tentatively.
“Certainly, Sir.”
“I propose one of two amendments.
Either “genuine twentieth - century
Chippendale chair,' or ‘imaginary
eighteenth-century chair with Chippen-
dale and other features.’”
I had prepared this speech before-
hand, together with the cold, acid
tone which should have accompanied
it. Which should have accompanied
'i it. . . .
: “In other words,” said the dealer,
| with a deliberate straightforwardness,
| “-let us be plain about it, Sir, if you
please—you mean that I've set my
'and to that invoice, thereby perpetu-
: ating a fraud?”
i- “Oh–er—I didn't mean that, " I
| protested. “A—a mistake, perhaps.”
If it was I who was mak-
| ing the mistake, my attitude was an
| awkward one to get out of. I oughtn't
to have condemned him unheard.
“A mistake ' " he exclaimed scorn-
fully. “Me! But I see what it is.
You've been got at by one of these
'ere ‘experts,' 'aven't you, Sir?”
“Well—er—a friend of mine,” I
said. “He knows quite a lot about
what did 'e tell you was wrong with
this piece? Before I alter the invoice
I 'ope you'll substantiate your state-
ments asperative to its authenticity.
Under English law even a antique's
innocent until proved guilty.”
He was rallying me in a humorous,
indulgent sort of way, and I felt an
awful worm. But I had to say some-
thing.
“The point is,” I began, “Chippen-
dale never made a chair like that—er
—did he 2" -
“Perhaps not another like that, Sir,"
said the dealer gravely. “Of course,
that chair's a rarity—and charged for
according, I admit.” -
There was no doubt the man was
honest, or he'd never have said a thing
like that. - -
“I see,” I said. “I see . . . . The
fact is,” I continued, by way of candid
apology, “I thought—I mean I was
told—it oughtn't to have an Adam vase
in the back splat.” - -
“No, it oughtn't!" agreed the dealer
ecstatically. “By all the accepted
ideas, it oughtn't I tell you, that
chair proves something. It proves,” he
continued enthusiastically, “that Adam
got his inspiration not direct from the
classic furniture periods, but vid
Chippendale. That chair's what I call
a missing link. It'll come to be talked
about.” -
“By Jove! will it really 2” I cried.
“Well, what about the Gothic work on
the rest of the back 2 And the Chinese
legs?”
These had been other counts in the
expert's indictment. But I made it
clear that I was only asking for in-
formation, I was perfectly satisfied.
“Both Chippendale features,” said
the dealer gravely.
“But—er—in the same chair?” I
queried.
“It looks like it, don't it? I don't
care for it myself—seems a mixture of
styles to my mind—but you can't
blame me for what Chippendale chose
to do. He was a master cabinet-maker;
I'm only a dealer.”
“Of course!” I agreed. “I suppose
it's the same with the feet. They're
Louis Quinze, aren't they 2"
“Now I ask you, Sir,” he demanded,
“did Louis Quinze come before Chip-
pendale or after 2"
I was unable to tell him, and anyway
there was no need. It was perfectly
obvious that in either case one of them
had drawn his inspiration from the
other. And the more incongruous the
decoration seemed—by all the accepted
ideas—of course the rarer it made the
“Very good,” he replied with dignity,
and we returned to the shop.
Then he was so ill-advised—for it
was what I dreaded, feeling that I
deserved it—as to begin a sermon.
“'Aving, I 'ope, convinced you of my
bomá fide,” he began, “I don't deny
that I feel 'urt by your suspicions. Of
course there are dishonest dealers, just
as there's dishonest gentlemen. If I'd
been one of them, I don't deny that
there's other features about that chair,
over and above what you noticed, that
might 'ave give rise to doubt. I don't
mind pointing them out. The lack of
freedom in the curves, for instance—
the modern look about the fretwork—
the state of preservation.”
Wasn't he carrying his candour
rather beyond the bounds of reason 2
“As a matter of fack the lack of free-
dom in the curves is a most useful
indext in determining the date of the
article. It shows that this chair was
manufactured while Chippendale was
in mourning for the death of his partner,
'Aig. I'm sorry about the fretwork.
I touched it up here and there myself,
because it was a bit dilapidated. I
wouldn't have done it if I'd known my
word was going to be doubted. I
bought the chair off an old lady that
'ad just discovered it in an old cupboard
in the panelling of 'er 'ouse. That's
why it's preserved so well and kept
its polish. She found Chippendale's
original bill for it, too, and I wish
more than ever now that she 'adn't
burned it.”
I had been convinced, perfectly con-
vinced. But now . . . in the per-
sistence of his endeavour to climb the
very topmost pinnacle of virtue, I felt
that he was toppling. . . toppling. .
“I see you 'ave nothing to say,” he
resumed. “I know I’ave no remedy
against these aspersions which 'ave
been made. I'm only a dealer. But
speaking to you as a gentleman, Sir, in
a way which l'ope you will understand,
I make bold to say that your way of
doing business is Not Cricket, Sir–
Not Cricket !”
It was too much. On the instant
he tumbled into the abyss of discredit.
Again I pulled myself together, telling
myself that I was an Englishman, whose
sires had ſought at Lewes, knowing that
it was but for an instant, remembering
that the door was close at hand.
“You needn't send the chair," I
said quickly. “For, speaking to you in
a way which I hope you will under-
stand, I can only say that your way of
doing business is Not Chippendale." |
I grasped the handle of the door.

ENGLAND ON THE UP-GRADE.
It is truly gratifying to learn that
something can already be written off
the tale of national disaster recently
recited by the Duke of WESTMINSTER.
A great many championships, it is true,
have still to be regained, but newspaper
reports during the past week show that
a splendid beginning has already been
made. Not only has a new world's
record for the 100 yards (Admirals')
been set up, but a number of other
competitions held at various centres
afford convincing evidence that the
charge of national decadence is to say
the least premature.
At Tunbridge Wells last Friday the
annual sports of the British Bathchair-
men was held with resounding success.
The great event of the day was the
three-mile bath-chair slow race with
octogenarian patients, in which regard
is had not only for the time occupied but
the comfort of the persons propelled.
After an exciting race the prize was

27 minutes 333 secs. without a single

mated Society of British Bathchairmen
have forwarded an application to the
Olympic Committee for a grant of
£10,000.
The inter-county meeting of the
National Wasp-Shooting Association
passed off with great éclat at Yealmpton
last Wednesday. The shield, presented
by the Worshipful Company of Bee-
keepers, was won by the Devonshire
team, who used the new cyanide of
potassium pop-gun with deadly effect.
The Olympic Fund Committee have
unanimously decided to award a grant
of £15,000 to the N.W.S.A.
The annual meeting of Merry-go-
round proprietors took place at Clacton-
on-Sea on Saturday. The competition
for the most sonorous steam-organ was
won by Messrs. Bolsover and Gedge,
of Hull, whose organ, fitted with a

made to Mr. Snodland to enable him

“INTERLoPERs.”.
IF a young author wants something
on which to flesh his satire-tooth he
could hardly choose a safer subject than
Eugenics. The public is not likely to
have its most sacred feelings lacerated
by ridicule of this latest religion. On
the other hand, he must not expect
that the fun to be got out of it is going
to be uproarious. Indeed, the picture of
Jack Chisholm protesting against his
wife's absorption in the two healthy
children he had given her, and her neg-
lect of all further interest in him as lover
and comrade, was quite a serious one.
For he was bound to seek consolation in
the love of some other woman
whose “life he could fill"—a
much more vital thing, in his
eyes, than the mere begetting
of sound children.
And it is with just such a
companion that we (and his
wife) find him in the Second
Act against a background of
Italian lake. The discovery—
rather crudely constructed — is
irksome to him, for he has an
incurable taint of conjugality.
Returning to London, he is .
made to confront his wife in
full family conclave—a scene
that recalled Mr. STANLEY
Houghton's Hindle Wakes, but
with a change of milieu that
made it hopelessly improbable.
Here, in an eloquent tirade
addressed to the secretary of a
Eugenic society, a lady-friend of
his wife's, he declares himself
sick of all this enthusiasm for
the younger generation and the
future prospects of the race.
What had posterity done to
Unfortunately the interest of all this
was largely academic. The author's
theories might intrigue us, but not the
personality of his puppets. I, for one,
found so little attraction in the wife—
and, of course I was not meant to
find much—that I entertained no con-
cern whatever about the issue.
Indeed there was only one brief
interlude in which I felt that I was
looking at life and not at the drama-
tisation of an idea. This was when
Mr. CAMPBELL GULLAN introduced a
delightful breath of reality into the very
minor part of a Scotch election-agent
who mistook the candidate's mistress
for his wife.

that was the sole end of her existence
she might just as well—and even better
—be a savage or a cow. He declines
to return to his home, and settles in a
bachelor's flat, keeping up his liaison
with discretion.
But the atmosphere of London differs
from that of an Italian lake and does
not encourage irregularity in the life
of a candidate for political honours.
Chisholm lacks, too, the Bohemian
spirit and a natural gift for impropriety.
His mistress—une vraie amoureuse,
who can easily replace him at a pinch—
recognises that he still hankers after
domestic felicity, and so, in the course
of the usual interview between the

why he doesn't want to return home,
and is made to express himself in these
ponderous terms: “I shall have the
daily irritation of living in an alien
atmosphere,” I would just as soon hear
|Mr. TREvoR say it as anybody else.
To those who recalled Mr. DENNIs
EADIE's performances in Mr. GALs-
worthy's Justice and other strenuous
plays, it was something of a shock to
find him, as the wife's brother, in the
rôle of a casual cynic, saying smart
things with here and there a word of
worldly wisdom. Indeed at first he
seemed a little contemptuous of his part
and had an air of insincerity; but this
wore off and one grew to believe in him.
Miss MIRIAM LEwBs, in the part of
Chisholm's lover, showed strong natural
something, I think, from Mrs. PATRICK
CAMPBELL, but also, I fear, from lesser
models. She might be a great actress
if she could keep away from the stage.
Miss WEEDEN as Mary, had an
uncongenial part, but that did not excuse
her staccato manner. Of the rest, Miss
Gwyn NE HERBERT, as Margaret Chis-
holm's mother, was adorable, and Mr.
MALLESON gave a clever little sketch of
a eupeptic crank.
I hinted that the fun to be got out of
a satire on Eugenics was not likely to
be uproarious. Yet the subject clearly
lends itself to a certain salacity; and
the suggestiveness of the dialogue in
the Third Act, where the wife's sister,
a brazen flapper on the eve of marriage
(played with great gusto by
Miss RISDON), discusses the
relations of married people,
vastly tickled the pit. i
On the whole I should like to
what I understand to be his
first production. If his work
improves as his play improved
in the course of its progress,
his success should be assured;
for he has many wise and happy
thoughts in his head, if he can
only find the right excuse for
their utterance.
“THE House of TEMPERLEY.”
I have just assisted at a
most delightful Cinematograph
Exhibition of Sir ARTHUR ConAN
Doyle's popular drama. As a
play of action (pugilistic) it is,
of course, admirably suited to
the new art which the London
Film Company have brought
almost to perfection. To those
—and in moments of bitterness
I have been of their company—
who contend that the ideal play would be
one in which the actors were not per-
mitted to speak, this show should be a
pure joy. Never was better acting
done by Mr. BEN WEBSTER, Mr.
CHARLEs MAUDE and the rest of the
cast, excellent right down to the tip of
its tail. For with no words to say
they had to rely on gesture and facial
expression—the true tests of the actor
—and these they employed with the
most commendable economy. O. S

I THINK I should like Thorley Weir (SMITH, ELDER), if for
no other reason, for the unique personality of its villain.
As a matter of fact there are several other reasons, but
Craddock remains the greatest. I question if Mr. E. F.
BENson has ever done better character-drawing than this
of the mean-souled, middle-aged egoist. The delightful
thing about him is that even at his wickedest he is never
wholly free from some quite human lapses into nice feeling.
He is in short a real person and not a malevolent machine,
as are so many of the naughty in fiction. I can't tell you
all of what he does, because that would be to give away the
whole interest of a somewhat slender plot. But his occu-
pation in life, and the main source of his comfortable
income, was speculating in genius. You take me? If there
were new men with plays or pictures going unrecognised,
Craddock would encourage them by taking an option on
their future output at a figure that his business acumen told
him would become exceedingly cheap. Amongst others
for whom he did this was the painter, Charles Lathan, who
was so grateful and lovable that, even while he swindled
and slandered him, Craddock could not help a secret
admiration for the boy. Another of Craddock's speculations
was Frank Armstrong, the dramatist, whose fortune he
made, and who wasn't in the least bit grateful, but detested
him for it in a manner that was cordially returned.
Perhaps you don't yet see where the villainy comes in 2
a simple tale of well-observed characters in a delightful
riverside setting. And, if you also find, as I did, that your
sympathies are not wholly on the side of wronged virtue,
that will not perhaps lessen your enjoyment.
In the detective story the author's business is to make
mystery and yours to unravel it if you can. You are being
played with ; but you know that it is a game of hide-and-
seek in which you are invited to join. In The Devil's
Garden (HUTCHINson) Mr. W. B. MAxwell plays by him-
self; he has a secret and keeps it for over two hundred
pages, and it is only when he shocks you by the sudden
exposure of it that you become aware that there ever was
a secret at all. You were given to understand that a cer-
tain man had died by accident, whereas he had really been
murdered; but the murderer had ſound sufficient trouble in
the infidelity of his wife (palliated after the murder which
avenged it) to account for most of his subsequent heart-
burnings and eccentricities of conduct; and so the reader
harbours no suspicion. Now I should not complain of
Mr. MAxwell's having his fun to himself—the prospect of
making the reader jump with surprise; the joy of indefi-
nitely delaying that surprise. But I do complain that in
the meantime he should not have provided us with a little
more entertainment to go on with, since we could have no
share in his own sport, aloof and Olympian. For, to be
candid, there are in the centre of the book vast tracts of
dull country; trivialities that seem to contribute nothing of
any purpose; chapter after chapter that begin with an

excellent animation of the opening pages may have made
me too sanguine of adventure; anyhow, I had to be content
with a very masterly analysis of character, for nothing
further happens till the very end. There is, it is true, a
most dramatic account of the process of the murder and
the paralysing terror that followed; but this is all merely
retrospective. The author could not at the same time have
the fun of keeping his murder a secret for years and years
and also the satisfaction of thrilling us with suspense over
the immediate action of it.
Mr. MAxwell, does not trouble himself much about his
style, which is simple and inornate; he relies upon an
unflinching realism, and seeks to create an atmosphere by
insistence on details whose cumulative effect is more recog-
nisable than the method of their selection. The Devil's
Garden is a book to be read twice; once for the surprise
and once for appreciation of the author's irony and his
clever handling of circumstances now first seen in their
true significance. And if this review is bound to spoil your
surprise, well, you can omit the first reading and go straight

“to so limit the King's authority,” “to always put him,”
“to slowly continue their walk,” “to very plainly urge,"
and “to now and then make some remarks,” are the speci-
mens that I have culled from its pages, and there may be
others, though I think not, for I have read it with the care
that it deserves. Apart from these instances of her feminine
defiance of modern convention, her book is singularly free
from blemishes. In writing the story of CROMwFIL and
CHARLEs I. it would be very easy to adopt a partisan spirit.
That danger she has successfully avoided. The failings
and virtues of the two characters are plainly and fairly
stated, without any tendency to over-much blame or praise.
Another striking feature of her story is that, as far as I can
see, every single character in it is historical; there is thus
none of the contrast between real and imaginary persons
which so often jars in books of this kind. Conversations
and thoughts she has, of course, invented, but so skilfully
and with such fine taste and such enlivening touehes of
sound, colour, movement, atmosphere, weather and even
smell, that they always seem to be the real thing. : I con-
— gratulate Miss Bow EN on
having made a human and
original story out of material
so well-worn. At the same
time I venture to very plainly
urge her to now and then
refrain from maltreating in-

that swarms with black-beetles, knowing that there is no
one in the wide world who desires her presence, expecting
to hear anon the sounds of her drunken mistress's return :
that chapter is a fine piece of realistic writing, and it is
as dramatic as it is truthful. Especially admirable is
the manner in which Mrs. SIDGwick enables her heroine
to experience every variety of service without straining
coincidence or appearing hasty in her development of the
ory. Finally, one is left with the overwhelming con-
ion that Mrs. SIDGwick's own servants must have the
most delightful time. I hope that Priscilla realises her
good fortune.
Miss MARJoR1E Bowen has apparently been consorting
with the Pirate Captain in Peter Pan. In her new histori-
cal romance, The Governor of England (METHUEN), she
splits her infinitives in the most merciless fashion. “To
authoress was supposed to be
cultivating in her arboreal plot. Flirtation, political am-
bitions and the foundation of a quarterly review, entitled
“The Amphitheatre,” of advanced and “precious" tendencies,
and costing a *. a copy (I seem to see the gold pouring
out upon the bookstalls), occupied for the most part the
minds of the set in which George and Ella Pardew (he a rich
retired manufacturer and she a beautiful butterfly) moved.
The book purports to be the impressions of Ella's secretary,
garden-mistress and confidante, and almost lady's maid,
Bettina Gale, who finally, by one of those chances rare
in actual life, inherits the place in whose garden she has
been playing the hired Pomona, and marries a brisk young
army aeroplanist with a desperately facetious turn of phrase.
Bettina seems to have been a person of admirable tact,
capacity and charm, but, somehow, I never got interested
in her (I think the authoress took my sympathy too much
for granted), and the whole novel left me feeling rather
as if I had been in the maze at Hampton Court than on
the spacious lawns of Kew.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SPORTING SPIRIT.
LIKE to the tar (in CoIERIDGE) who
Contrived with glittering orbs to freeze on
The stranger at the wedding feast,
I love all sorts of bird and beast,
And cannot think what I should do
Without them—in the shooting season.
But first of things that fly or run
I love the hare to mere distraction;
I love him roast, I love him jugged,
But best I love him lying plugged,
When it has been my private gun
That put his trotters out of action.
Great is the partridge as he flies
(A natural gift) across the clover;
But often, brooking no delay,
He is a field or so away
Before you grasp the thought that lies
Beneath the simple phrase “Mark over !”
Good is the pheasant; fully fed,
He makes a most superb objective;
But so magnetic is his tail
That it attracts the deadly hail
Which should have hit him in the head,
Where blows are always more effective.
I like the bunny; but he lacks
A sense of sport: he swerves and dodges; . .
Seldom runs straight—the honest plan—
Nor keeps the open like a man,
But, even as your weapon cracks,
Enters the low haunts where he lodges.
But, oh the hare In him I trace
A nature nobler than the rabbit's ;
Big as his body (which is large
And gives the eye an ample marge)
He scorns, as something rather base,
The coney's too-secretive habits.
He nests beneath the open sky - * *
Just where the larks compose their carols;
Sits up that you may have no doubts
Of his immediate whereabouts,
Then runs as straight as any die,
An obvious butt for both your barrels.
And that is why I love the hare
Better than all and praise him louder;
To me he represents the pure
And perfect type of amateur,
With whom I'd always gladly share
My last remaining pinch of powder. O. S.
A Welcome Change.
“The marriage arranged between Mr. Charles Bayley and Miss
Violent Brett will take place quietly at Motihari.”—Statesman.
Important Ruling by the House of Lords.
“The Chairman of Committees: Before the Motion to read the Bill
a third time is taken, I would ask your Lordships to make three
small Amendments, which I can assure you are practically nothing
more, except in one case, than setting right misprints. In page
52, line 4, the words “to prevent effectually ” should read “to
effectually prevent.”—Hansard.
After this official pronouncement we are wondering if it is
legal to under any circumstances, and if so which, use an
MINISTERIAL MISFITS.
MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL, on the occasion of his recent
visit to Buckingham, has elicited a stern rebuke in the
current issue of Men's Wear. The evidence is unanswer-
able, being that of the camera, which shows him “wear-
ing a square felt hat, stiff linen collar with large wings, a |
bow necktie, a lounge coat with flap to the outside breast
pocket, kid gloves, and trousers which look like a cross
between a pair of riding breeches and of woollen pants,
the pants part having large creases at the lower part of the
leg. To complete this extraordinary rig-out, the right hon.
gentleman thought it a fit and proper thing to put on a
pair of button boots. These boots are the worst iniquity
in an iniquitous conglomeration of unsuitable clothing; they
positively make one shudder.” -
We regret to say that Mr. CHURCHILL is not the only
sartorial offender in the Cabinet. Paradoxical as it may
appear, by far the greatest outrages against the laws of
fashion are committed by one who as a rule is scrupulously
particular in his attire—Mr. LULU HARcourt. In him the
old saying, Corruptio optimi pessima, receives a new, a pain-
fully vivid, illustration. Clad as a rule with a meticulous
correctitude, Mr. HARcourt is subject to occasional fits of
slovenly eccentricity, in which he “goes Fanti” in his dress.
The last time he was seized in this way was when he was
out grouse shooting on the Yorkshire moors. To the horror
of the other members of the party he appeared in a pair of
gray flannel trousers, a frock coat and a straw hat. Worse
still, he had dispensed with a collar and wore a pair of white
tennis boots. The Baron DE Forest, who was one of the
party, was so much upset that, although a strict teetotaler,
he had to be revived with a stiff tumbler of sal volatile and
ammoniated quinine, while Lord LONSDALE felt obliged to
send a telegram of protest to the GERMAN EMPEROR. It is
generally felt that the doom of the Cabinet cannot be long
delayed when prominent Ministers behave in this way.
Only last week Lord HALDANE was seen at a dinner-party
wearing a white tie with a turn-down collar! And more
than once Mr. SAMUEL has been suspected of wearing a
dicky secured with a couple of postage stamps.
Pick of THE LITTER.
BEAGLE puppy, a fortnight old,
Squirming sluggishly in the straw,
You're only conscious of warmth and cold
And the chastening pat of a parent paw.
Fat as butter, liver and white,
. Stern and shoulder as black as jet—
Pick of the litter? Perhaps they're right.
Rather early to say as yet.
Well, you come of a worthy pair,
Punter and Priestess, two of the best—
Punter, who'll sing to the line of a hare
And hold it longer than all the rest;
Priestess, who collars the leading place
From find to finish, from cast to view—
If you've got your mother's manners and pace,
Her nose and her bone and her ribs, you'll do.
Mottled barrel of puppyhood,
Nuzzling muzzle cool and wet,
Next year's pride of the pack (touch wood)–
Rather early to say as yet.
Grim distemper may lurk ahead;
Deadly “yellows” may lay you low;
Perish the thought—we'll hope instead

who had said she wanted to go to

doing that, but I didn't always do it at

once, right in the middle of the traffic,
and got off his seat and came round to
me and wanted to know what the so-
and-so I thought I was playing at.
“It's all right, old thing,” I said. “I
only want a little practice. We'll have
lunch at Ealing Broadway, so hurry
up and get a move on you.”
He went back and got such a move
on him that he nearly ran over a
policeman. It was partly the police-
man's own fault. He stood in the
road pointing out that there was some-
thing the matter with the 'bus; it was
infringing some regulation or other.
Worse than that (so he said), it was
and
happening. I went round to him.
“Look here,” I said to him, “I can
see what you're trying to do—you're

and then he relapsed into an unsociable

“Look here, my man,” I said; “I’ve
got a bit of a temper myself, but I'm
thankful to say it isn't a sulky one.”
He was better after that.

A SYMPATHETIC STRIKE.
THERE was one little item of news in
connection with the labour troubles in
Dublin the gravity of which has, it
appears, been entirely overlooked. It
was communicated by The Daily Mail's
correspondent, who, speaking of the
spread of the strike to the farm labourers
in the neighbourhood, foreshadowed in
a stirring passage the coming of a period
of agricultural chaos. All work was at
a standstill, and not only that, but
unthatched stacks were rotting (he
announced) for want of thrashing and
turnips were decaying in the fields.
Our text, so to speak, will be found in
these last striking words, and especially
in the unprecedented behaviour of the
turnips.
At first we were frankly incredulous.
We found it hard to believe that turnips
in the month of September (when they
may generally be counted upon to make
their greatest growth) should thus, in
defiance of Nature's laws, have sud-
denly begun to waste away; and our
own stacks, whenever we have had
the good fortune to possess any, have
usually endured for several weeks with-
out much damage, even if they were
unthatched. Still, the idea haunted us;
we could not dismiss it from our mind.
We felt that it should be looked into,
and at last we despatched a Special
Correspondent to investigate upon the
spot. To-day we are able to give his
report—a report, we may say, which
has profoundly moved us.
“I have made my way [he writes]
through many acres of decaying turnips,
whose odour was almost insupportable,
to a small farm-steading seventeen miles
from Dublin, where I have found a re-
markable state of affairs. I may say
at once that the extent of the damage
has been, if anything, underestimated.
I set to work without delay upon a
careful investigation. The first thing
that attracted my notice was a heap
of fire-wood near the back door. It
was entirely covered by purple fungi,
attributed by the farmer to the fact that
it had not been dusted for several days.
I next took a look at the supply of
linseed cake in the barn, which I found
in an advanced state of disintegration,
much of it already having crumbled to
dust. But perhaps the most surprising
discovery that I made, and one that
immediately banished my scepticism,
was when I put my head into the
hay-shed. After watching carefully for
some minutes I came to the amazing
conclusion that the hay was slowly
evaporating, and the farmer assured
me, with tears in his eyes, that he had
lost nearly two tons since the beginning
—ATSR, 1-Tit-,

sty the poor fellow laid a hand on my
arin.
“‘Don't go in there,' he said.
“There's trouble among the pigs."
“And indeed it was easy to see that
something was the matter, for I came
at once upon a large litter which ap-
peared to be in a state of intoxication.
“‘It was the fomented barley,' the
farmer explained. “We can't keep
barley these days. Come this way; I
want to show you the blight on the
clover. . . .’”
With these grave words from our
correspondent before us we can only
say that we hope that long before this
report appears in print the labour
troubles in Ireland will have come to

have reached us that the sympathetic

vegetable kingdom. Cows are already
giving buttermilk in some places, while
hens are persistently laying last week's

doubt that Trade Unionism has found
a valuable ally and a new and most
powerful weapon.

THE STUMBLING BLOCK.
HENRY was practising niblick shots
when I looked in at his flat the other
morning, and he had just made a clever
recovery from the waste-paper basket
as I came into the room.
“That settles it,” I said. “I was
going to offer to take a stroke a hole
next Monday; now I shall want two.
Henry, I've got a letter for you; the
porter gave it to me as I came up.”
Henry took the letter, glanced at the
writing and threw it on the table.
“I don't think that's quite polite,” I
said. “You should read letters which
I take the trouble to bring you.
Besides, Williams and I That is
Williams on the sofa, isn't it 2 How
do you do, Williams? We are naturally
eager to know who your correspondent
is.”
“It's from the solicitor to my land-
lord, if you want to know,” said Henry.
“That sounds very depraved. An
ordinary solicitor is bad enough; a
a solicitor to one's landlord * >
“You can read it if you like,” said
Henry, and he gave me the letter.
“He’s never very interesting. And
you can pay the rent too if you like.”
“Excuse me, Williams,” I murmured,
as I opened the letter. “Tut, tut,
this is more than interesting, this is
epoch-making.”
“What's the matter?”
“Listen. It's from the solicitor to
the Westminster Incorporated Building
Society.”
“My landlord, Wibs.” -
“Quite so. 'Dear Sir, This is to
inform you that, as from September
29th next, Shakspeare Mansions is
the property of the Liverpool Estate
Syndicate. Take notice that from that
date all rents should be paid to the
Liverpool Estate Syndicate, and not to
the Westminster Incorporated Building
Society. Yours faithfully, John BATEs.'
Henry,” I added solemnly, “Wibs is
no longer your landlord.”
“Well, what of it?” said Henry.
“Quite so,” said Williams. Williams,
I ought to have said before, lives below
Henry. There is only one other flat in
the building, and that has been empty
for some time.
“What of it?” I cried. “Henry,
Williams, my dear friends, don't you
see what has happened 2’
Williams tried to look as if he did,
but obviously didn't.
“My brothers, this is what has
happened. By a corrupt bargain be-
tween John Bates and the Liverpool
Estate Syndicate you have been sold to
Liverpool. For years you have been
loyal to the Westminster Incorporated
peace under the rule of Wibs; you have
paid your rent cheerfully * >
“Not cheerfully,” said Williams.
“You have paid your rent loyally to
Wibs. Are you now to be robbed of
your birthright? Are you to be handed
over to the domination of Liverpool?
All we ask,” I went on with great
emotion, “is to remain beneath the
flag of Westminster; to continue to
pay rent to the Westminster Incor-
porated Building Society; not to be
placed under the heel of a Liverpool
landlord. All we demand—”
“Why ‘we 2 said Henry.
don’t live here.”
“True. But there is a precedent for
saying ‘we.’ Speaking as a barrister,
I associate myself in this matter with
my clients. And, gentlemen,” I went
on, “there is also a precedent for what
we are about to do. We are about to
form a Provisional Govérnment.”
“Hear, hear,” said Williams.
“What we propose to do is this.
We propose to keep Shakspeare Man-
sions in trust for the Westminster
Incorporated Building Society until
such time as Wibs is ready to take it
over again. Meanwhile we will collect
the rent for him, pay the rates, repair
the crack in Henry's geyser and arm
ourselves against any attack on our
liberties. My friends, are you with me?”
Williams reflected for a moment.
“Suppose they send policemen against
us?” he asked.
“They will never dare, and if they
did would a Westminster policeman
consent to arrest a fellow Westminster
man? He would eat his truncheon
rather. All we ask——”
“You’re not going to say it all over
again 2" said Henry in alarm.
“You’ll be very lucky if you only
get it twice,” I said stiffly. “As your
leader in this revolution I do all the
talking. When the Provisional Govern-
ment is set up I shall be your president.”
“Then I shall be the Finance Com-
mittee,” said Henry.
“That only leaves the Army unfilled.
Williams shall be our gallant army.
I shall be photographed taking the
salute from him. He has a bowler hat
already; all he wants is a bandolier
and an indemnity fund. If you are
arrested, Williams, your family will be
compensated—supposing they think it
necessary. Meanwhile, what about
lunch 2''
“Whoever takes the rent we must
eat,” said Henry. “Come along.”
The Provisional Government put on
its hats and went out to lunch. It
returned, somewhat torpid, two hours
later. The Finance Committee sank
into the sofa and the Army stretched

I say that we are inflexibly resolved
never to pay rent to Liverpool. We

covenant to that effect, and none signed
it more willingly than myself who do
not live here and will never be asked to

its resolution to remain loyal to West-
minster, and so long as we are united
our liberties cannot be assailed. We

There was a sudden surprising noise
from the ceiling—a noise like “Hitchy- |

“What's that, Williams ?” I asked
quickly.
“The man above. He's got a pianola.”
“I didn't know there was a man
above. I thought the flat was empty.”
“He hasn't been in long. He's come
up from Liverpool, the porter says, to
see life.”
“Oh!" This altered matters a good
deal. The President left the revolving
bookcase and walked up and down in
anxious thought. At last he came to his
decision. “Williams,” I said sorrow-
fully, “the revolution is off; the Pro- |
visional Government is dissolved; the
Army is disbanded.”
“Oh, I say ! Why?"
“A revolutionary government must
be whole-hearted, united. It can wage
civil war against the enemy, but it
cannot face a civil war within itself.

united in its resistance to Liverpool

LAPSES OF TIME.
“WHEN (if ever) you have finished
your lunch,” said Marjorie, “we have
an important meeting to attend on the
village green.”
“If,” I said, drawing to a conclusion,
“if I am to address your feudal tenants
on the Land Question I must have a
liqueur with my coffee.”
George, be it said, though he is at
once Marjorie's husband and the local
squire, was at the moment elsewhere.
Behind my week-end invitation there
now appeared to be this ulterior motive,
that I should act as his understudy on
this Saturday afternoon.
“We are due to take part in the
village sports,” explained Marjorie.
“They don't really want us, but would
be hurt if we didn't join in.”
“But I have left my cycle and my
egg and my spoon behind me in Lon-
don,” I protested.
Marjorie took a large silver watch
from the mantelpiece and handed it to
me graciously.
“Thank you kindly, ma'am,” said I,
with a rustic curtsey. “To receive the
first prize before the race is run is to
be relieved of all anxiety from the start.”
Marjorie took me up quickly. “There
First, that it is a loan; second, that
George, its owner, sets great value by
it; third, that it is a stop-watch. Are
you to be trusted with its manipula-
tion ?”
“Anybody can stop a watch,” said I
haughtily.
“But the difficulty is to start it,”
was Marjorie's significant reply.
Arrived later at the village green I
at once associated myself with the
Parson and the Publican, who held the
tape between them. They had little to
say to me, so I turned to Marjorie and
discussed the political situation. “We
have before us,” I said, in an eloquent
whisper, “the Church, the Licensed
Trade and the Landed Interest united
by a common bond. Is not this our
opportunity to strengthen George's
position against the assaults of the
Single Taxer?” My flow of words was
suddenly interrupted by a pistol shot,
exactly a hundred yards away.
“Are you hurt?” I asked her
anxiously.
She pointed to the onrush of some
half-dozen natives. “Are you ready to
stop the watch?” she asked breath-
lessly.
“Quite,” said I, starting it.
The first heat of the hundred yards
took even less. As to the Final there
was some dispute as to who had won.
When it was settled and I was free to
resume my particular business, I dis-
covered that the time for that was
three minutes, forty-five and four-fifth
seconds, an ample period which was
rapidly increasing. Marjorie wasn't at
all pleased about it. “But you mustn't
expect too much of mere rustics,” I
told her.
Before they started the mile she took
my watch off me, and the villagers,
having lost confidence, also got another
timekeeper of their own. Marjorie
blamed me very much and explained,
with illustrations, how simple it was to
work. She was still explaining when
they finished the first lap of the mile.
On her attention being called to this
fact she blushed and made a sudden
movement, on which I commented as
follows:—“Ah, yes,” I said, “it’s all
very well starting to time it now, but
you'll find yourself in difficulties when
they get to the finish . . . unless you
can get them to run an extra lap for
ſou.”
y When the finish was achieved she
went very straight to the other time-

watch, which, however, the other time-
keeper was not allowed to see.
“Five minutes, five seconds and a
fifth, lady,” he said. . -
“Oh, well, you may be right,”
she after the briefest pause. “I make
it five minutes and five seconds exactly.”
And she set the watch back at once
to zero. The villagers were obviously
leased. “There!" said Marjorie to me,
“that's how it ought to be done!”
Feeling that the honour of London
was at stake I determined to retrieve
the position. But there was only the
obstacle race left, and nobody seemed
interested in the timing of that. Mar-
jorie, being thoroughly pleased with
herself, was easily induced to address
the assembly in conclusion. Not till
she was surrounded by a ring of ex-
pectant yokels did she realize that,
when one rises to make a speech, one
is without a single friend, that even
one's nearest and dearest are against
one. Having begun and ended in con-
fusion she turned for support to me,
who stood just behind her.
I held the stop-watch prominently in
view. “Twelve seconds and a bittock,”
I announced in my most official voice,
and for once the villagers' sympathies
said
HUMANER LETTERS.
The plays of the moment seem to
be curiously provocative of public cor-
respondence. Last week attention was
drawn to the misgivings of certain
members of Sir J. M. BARRIE’s audience
(who, by the way, when next they visit
The Adored One, will find all their
troubles gone), and now we seem to be
in for heated discussions on others.
Here, for example, is no less an
epistolary warrior than the Hon.
STEPHEN ColeRIDGE (unless we are
misled by our correspondent's style and
attitude) on the track of Androcles and
the Lion :-
“Sir, [he writes] it is incredible to
me that such a notoriously humane
person as Mr. BERNARD SHAw should
derive fun from the spectacle of a dumb
animal in agony, as he does in the
opening scene of his otherwise amusing
trifle at the St. James's Theatre. To
drag the King of Beasts into a piece of
stage mummery at all is offensive; but
to exhibit him in the throes of pain is
unpardonable. What kind of effect
can a cynical display such as this have
on a house full (or partly full) of un-
thinking pleasure-seekers? Will it be
his operation on the poor creature's
foot, never even dreams of an anaes-
thetic 2 Not that that would make it
any better in reality, as all readers of
my letters to the Press are aware; but,
at any rate, earnest would be given of
some hope of alleviating suffering. But
no, and there is nothing for me but to
give up also Mr. SHAw, who hitherto
has been wholly on my side in my war
against callousness. Now, alas, he too
goes.”
A propos of the new musical comedy
at the Shaftesbury, the advent of which
was made such a secret by the manage-
ment and the Press, an anxious house-
holder asks:—
“Is it not more than a little tactless,
not to say unfortunate, that the title,
The Pearl Girl, should be given to a
new frivolous production at the moment
when a great legal case involving a
number (sixty-one, to be precise) of
pearls of extraordinary value is sub
judice” Surely any other stone would
have done as well for the purposes of
the stage—sardonyx, chrysoprase, opal,

EXTRACTS FROM THE JOURNAL
OF AN OSTRICH.
My First Day.—I am successfully
lmatched.
While my shell was yet unbroken
I had decided I would write my life
history at the earliest opportunity; for
I believe few ostriches follow a literary
career. I am the youngest of my eight
brothers and sisters; and, as my shell
was a thick one, I was naturally rather
exhausted when I had my first peep of
my family and our home. It is a
comfortable though unpretentious nest,
merely a dent in the ground, and around
it is a sort of fence made from the old
shells we children came out of, and
some eggs which haven't hatched.
Mother always lays some extra eggs,
so that Father may have something to
play with when he takes his turn at
sitting. Yes, in our family these things
are properly divided. You see, an
ostrich egg is so precious, it must be
sat on for six weeks. Our mothers sit
in the daytime because their feathers
are a greyish brown, the colour of the
ground, and thus they can't easily be
seen by intruding humans. For the
same reason, our fathers, being black,
sit at night.
Mother says that we chicks had an
often take his place on the nest at four
in the afternoon (three hours before his
time) so that Mother should be able to
slip over the hill and have a chat with
the ostrich hen who lives there and
who hasn't any eggs to look after.
Our Mother seems rather fond of
society. She wears such lovely feathers
and carries her neck at a perfect angle.
My Second Day.—I have a tragedy
to write of to-day. How pitiful that
my young life should be saddened
almost at the outset ! Early this
morning, as soon as Mother had tidied
up our broken shells, she and Father
took us out walking in the long grass
quite a distance from home. Mother
was teaching us the right weeds to eat,
and my eldest sister—the beauty of our
family—was with Father a little way
off. We heard Father say, with great
delight, that he had found just the sort
of rusty nail his gizzard had required
lately. In fact, he came across to tell
us about it. Mother, after listening
for some time, her head thrown to one
side and a curiously sleepy expression
in her eye, which meant, I fancy, that
she had heard quite enough about
times before, suddenly raised her head
and, interrupting him in the middle of
a sentence, shrieked, “Where's Pru-
Father's digestive arrangements many
Father, looking rather ashamed,
hurried back to where he thought he
had left her; but Prudence had dis-
appeared. My parents spent some
time hunting for her, but as they are
both short-sighted and Father was
continually discovering a different blade
of grass beside which he would declare
positively he had left her, it was hardly
surprising that our dear Prudence's
place was empty at lunch-time.
My Third Day.—Yes, I have decided
this world is a disappointment. There
seems so much discord. I feared this
the moment I hatched, and now am
certain. Still, one must worry through
it somehow, I suppose.
Father and Mother can never agree
whether china or old nails make the
better digestive foods. They frequently
spoil my sleep arguing about it at night.
Two more of my brothers are lost.
They were having a kicking match just
outside Father's feathers late last night,
and we fear a jackal must have picked
them off.
Our Farmer came this morning and
said several very impolite things to
Mother when he saw some of us were
missing, just as though it was not his
business to see we were properly pro-
tected What a curious species these

Three Weeks Later.—I have a terrible
occurrence to chronicle to-day. Father
and Mother have been plucked. This
is one of the reasons we hate all humans.
They take our beautiful feathers and
give us the trouble of growing more,
just so that their females—who appar-
ently can't grow feathers themselves—
may wear ours on their heads!
Our parents look so curious without
their long wing and tail feathers; and
we shall be shockingly short of bed-
clothes. I have registered a solemn
vow never to allow anyone to cut my
feathers off. By the way, they really
are shaping very becomingly. I shall
be a pretty figure of a cock.

We passed a hollow which Nancy
pointed out, saying it would be a good
site for a nest. Queer how the minds
of even intelligent hens always run on
nests! She giggled rather, too.

me an egg in the hollow. Said it was

A Month Later.—The last few weeks
have been a happy time. Nancy thinks
with me in all things. Truly, she is a
hen of exceptionally good taste.
The hollow is now full of eggs, and
there is a ring of them outside, remind-
ing me of my old home and making
me vaguely uneasy. But still I could
never be expected to sit on them. For
one thing, my legs are too long.

wretched eggs all night. I find I can

forget himself so far as to allow a
couple of complete strangers to take
possession of half the table which,
between the hours of six and eight, I
have learnt to consider exclusively my

lapse from duty was quite inexcusable,
I know. And yet I have forgiven him.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
F-
A GREAT REFORMER.
Miss Toovey has deserved well of
the public in writing an authoritative
Life of her maternal uncle, the late Mr.
Emanuel Porpentine, whose demise a
year ago at an almost over-ripe old age
occasioned such widespread regret; for
this is pre-eminently one of those Lives
of Great Men which are sent to remind
us that with a little luck we may all
hope to pilot our own careers to a
similarly sublime altitude. In five
hundred and seventy-three well-printed
pages, enlivened with a unique series
of portraits of the great inventor from
the age of two upwards, Miss Toovey
has given us a fascinating narrative,
and has at the same time raised a
handsome monument to cne whose
name has been writ not in water but
in indelible ink on the pages of his
country's social annals.
The name of Porpentine is famous for
all time as that of the original inventor
of the moustache-cup. In millions of
British homes to-day the solid (or
rather liquid) comforts of the breakfast-
table and the more elegant amenities of
afternoon tea are strikingly enhanced
by the employment of this beneficent
device. But how many of those who
possess what a gifted wiiter has pic-
turesquely described as “mouth-frills,”
and who must be grateful every day of
their lives for the protective ingenuity
of Mr. Porpentine's invention, are aware
of the vicissitudes and public obloquy
it experienced before it attained to its
present-day popularity ? With deft
fingers the curtain is liſted on the
thrilling events connected with its birth,
and we are given a lively presentment
of the great struggle and of its heroic
protagonist. -
“A man without moustachios,” says
Miss Toovey in an arresting Foreword,
“is like beef without mustard"; and
this infectious enthusiasm for her hero's
most distinguishing feature gives the
book a peculiarly engrossing interest.
Quite early in his adolescence Mr.
Emanuel Porpentine boasted an un-
usually heavy and handsome pair of
what his biographer calls “man's
crowning glories.” A native and a
leading citizen of Mugshead, where his
father had been one of the founders
of the Postdiluvian Primitive Chapel,
until his fortieth year he was abso-
lutely unknown to the great mass of
his countrymen, although his striking
personality, combined with the posses-
sºon of a fruity and full-bodied bass
voice, had already made him a local
celebrity. Miss Toovey draws a vivid
word-portrait of Mr. Porpentine as he
appeared at this time:—
rotundity that was no more than agreeable.
He carried his weight well, and the habit he
had of rising on his toes as he walked gave
him an appearance of elasticity and perfect
balance that removed all suspicion of heavi-
ness. He was accounted a good, if deliberate,
dancer. . His eyes and what could be dis-
cerned of : his initial chim betokened great
determination of character, and he had a way
of twice repeating everything he said that lent
a wonderful force to his most commonplace
utterances. His complexion, again, was rich;
but it was his moustachios that singled him
out as a man in a million. With their golden
pride challenging the world, as it were, and
almost completely veiling the lower part of his
face from the public view, he seemed a verit-
able Viking returned to life. A contemporary
statistician estimated that if each single hair
were joined end to end they would reach from
the Mugshead Infirmary to Temple Bar. But
mere figures of this kind, however accurately
calculated, can convey no idea of the brilliant
and luxuriant growth of the virgin forest that
flourished beneath Mr. Porpentine's well-
modelled nose.
Like ARCHIMEDEs, N Ewton, and
other celebrated pioneers of research,
Mr. Porpentine made his momentous
discovery by accident. It should be
mentioned that, after four decades of
consistent celibacy, he had betrothed
himself to the lady who subsequently
became the partner of his triumph.
Miss Euphemia Gussett—such was the
name of his clect—was a woman of
remarkable character, and, although
she brought all the appreciation of her
sex to bear upon the unique quality of
her future husband's caresses, she took
firm exception to salutations performed.
just after he had been partaking of
liquid nourishment, portions of which
had a way of adhering to the well-
developed ſeature so effectively described
above. In fact, she firmly refused to
embrace him on these occasions at all
until he had devised some method of
preventing the contamination. “Evi-
dently,” observes Miss Toovey in one
of those epigrammatic asides that make
her volume one long surprise-packet,
“the young lady was of opinion that
kissing goes by flavour; and, when
the consequences of her ultimatum are
considered, few will censure her fastidi-
ousness.” -
Mr. Porpentine, who was not of a
disposition to brook such an abrogation
of a fiancé's privileges, spent anxious
days and sleepless nights in vain efforts
to tackle the problem. The solution
came suddenly one morning at break-
fast. At this important meal he was
in the habit of reading the local news-
|. and on the morning in question,
eing deeply engrossed in an article
which contained the daring suggestion
that Mugshead should be provided with
a drainage system, he liſted his coffee-
cup to his lips without removing his
eyes from the paper. By accident the
top of the cup became partly covered by
ing for the passage of the fluid, while
at the same time his moustache was
amply protected from contact there-
with. In a flash Mr. Porpentine's
discerning mind grasped the possibilities
of this fortuitous revelation, and the
invention of the world-renowned appli-
ance that was destined to bring him
fame and fortune was practically
accomplished there and then.
The appearance of the moustache-
cup on the market was hailed at first
with almost universal derision, and in
scores of lampoons and vitriolic news-
paper articles its inventor was held up
to public ridicule. Even sermons were
preached against it. : But gradually
Mr. Porpentine succeeded, by unlimited
grit and pluck, in wearing down all
opposition, and in a few years' time he
had the satisfaction of reaping a rich
material reward from his benevolent
enterprise. . . * .
We cannot leave the volume without
some reference to the intimate glimpses
of domestic life with which Miss Toovey
furnishes her readers. - Besides being a
chivalrous husband, a devoted father,
and a striking figure of a man who left
a deep impression wherever he moved,
Mr. Porpentire was endowed with a
fund of sterling wisdom that frequently
rose to the level of wit. Some of his
obiter dicla are well worth recording.
“Poverty,” he was fond of remarking,
“is no disgrace; neither are the mumps.
But both are ridiculous.” He had a
healthy contempt for all unproductive
work. Once he was discussing poetry
with a friend, who ventured the obser-
vation that “poets are not made.”
“And as a rule,” rejoined Mr. Porpentine,
“they make nothing.” On another
occasion a young and unknown writer
who aspired to the hand of his only
daughter was pulverised with the retort:
“Sir, we Porpentines need no quills."
To the end of his days he preserved the
same unaffected bonhomie that had, as
a young man, made him the darling of
Mugshead Society, and his death caused
a wide gap in the circle of his many
acquaintances. As his biographer
rightly observes, he has left footprints
on the sands of time which it will be
very difficult to obliterate.

AT THE PLAY.
“MARY GoFS FIRST.”
IT is just as well for Mr. HENRY
ARTHUR Jones that Miss MARIE TEM-
PEST's personality is so popular that it
is of little consequence what she plays
in. She has only to bunch her lips and
blink her half-closed eyes and a rap-
turous public is content. Still she
must have something to say, and so
Mr. Jones has manufactured for her a
four-act comedy on the rather thin
theme of envy, spite and malice in the
matter of the Honours List. Of course
not every house in London was open to
him, for the actor-manager who still
belongs to the order of the Great Un-
knighted, and is therefore free to ridicule
the methods by which titles are con-
ferred, is a rare figure. But this is
Miss TEMPEST's season at The Play-
house and there he was safe.
For a play that is just meant to
amuse, and makes no appeal to the
intelligence, Mary Goes First began
very heavily. In the two scenes of the
First Act there was scarcely a smile.
Later on, as it became more frankly far-
cical, there were moments that invited
to laughter. But in the mutual jealousy
of a pair of provincial female snobs
there was never enough fresh stuff for
a whole evening's work. -
Still I learned something about loca
manners. In the best suburban circles
of Warkinstall you introduce a medical
guest as Dr. So-and-so of Harley Street.
And you go in to dinner like this: your
host gives his arm to the leading lady,
and then pauses for a brief dialogue.
At its conclusion the butler announces
dinner, and you all move off. This is
relatively simple. But things are com-
plicated when the claims of the leading
lady (wife of new knight) threaten to
be usurped by those of Another (wife of
new baronet). In the play the former is
taken ill and has to undergo a rest cure
in the cloak-room. Compelled at last by
her husband to mount to the drawing-
room, she bursts into a flood of tears,
and, refusing consolation, rehearses
her woes before an embarrassed com-
pany. The dinner grows colder every
minute (and I, for one, colder still).
No solution is at hand, and it looks as
if we shouldn't even get away to sup-
per, when the new queen of Warkin-
stall has an inspiration. She offers
her own arm to the ex-queen (who is
on the stout side), and, to evade the
vexed question of precedence, they stick
in the door together.
It is unusual for two dinners to be
given in one play by the same host to
the same guests. A pronounced varia-
tion in the procedure was therefore
seems to have recognised this. Cer-
tainly no one who witnessed the
remarkable preliminaries of the second
of these two meals had any right to
complain that the dramatist lacked in-
vention. For my part, I am conscious
of having done a great injustice to
provincial society. I see now that its
annals are not nearly so colourless as
I supposed.
Most of the fun—a little antiquated,
some of it—turned on Lady Dods-
worth's wigs and complexions, which
were made the object of libellous com-
ment by Mary Whichello, who went so
far as to say that her rival looked like
an “impropriety.” It was the concrete
suggestion underlying this term that

provoked the infuriated husband to issue
a writ. But at the last moment the
injured party declined to seek satis-
faction in the courts, for fear that she
might be required to exhibit to the jury
the artificial aids to beauty which had
provoked the alleged libel. All this
was good matter for a brief farce, but
nothing more.
MARIE, of course, was first past the
judge's box (as I am confident she
would have been if her case had come
into court), and Mr. GRAHAM BRowNE
was a good second. Of the rest it may
be said that they “also ran.” This was
no fault of Mr. FRANCE (as Whichello)
or Mr. MUSGRAVE (as Sir Thomas Dods-
worth, Knt.). The behaviour demanded
of the former was too extravagant for
comedy, and the latter was a figure
which might have come straight out of
DickFNs in his worst mood of insistent
overstatement.
ARTHUR JONES's trifle seems to have
taken the wilful fancy of the public,
which is probably what he wanted; so
that he can easily do withott my best
flattery.
THE LITTLE REVENGE.
ToM, when, your holiday ended, home-
ward you wended to town,
Flaunting a face that the breezes had
bronzed to the orthodox brown ;
Proudly you prattled of Plashville,
almost as though you'd alone
Called into being its mud-flats, blest
them with bilgy ozone.
Choking my yawns with an effort,
Tom, I allowed you to prate,
Merely remarking (inside me), “Just let
the imbecile wait;
I too shall have a vacation, I'll have
a tale to reveal,
I too will show a proboscis brazenly
starting to peel.”
Well, I've been wallowing lately far
from the taxi-cab's roar,
Out where the rag-time was ringing
down the salubrious shore;
Fishermen (splendid in oilskins) filched
me my food from the sea;
Only last Monday your Herbert ate

them remarks to a friend, “Perhaps Pratt knows at least
one little bit about Life by this time.” If I know Amory,
I feel that he does, poor fellow. It has taken Mr. ONIONS
some time to tear himself away from the great Jeffries
murder-case; but no one can say that he has done it half-
heartedly. The Two Kisses is one long laugh from be-
ginning to end. I have seldom read a book so crammed
with quotable passages, so full of admirable thumb-nail
sketches of character. I defy anyone with a sense of
humour not to revel in Mr. Wellcome, Mr. Edmondson, and
the other dwellers in the boarding-house, “Glenerne.”
Best of all, perhaps, though he comes into the book too
late, is Mr. Miller, the American publicity expert of
Hallowell's Stores—that “noo edifice" which he was de-
termined to run on “noo methods.” I hope Mr. ONIONs is
going to make a practice of writing his books in threes.
I want at least two more volumes about the people of The

in novels, was less exacting in this instance even than
usual; none of the people concerned had seen the

the vaguest idea what he ought to look like. Moreover,
they were astonishingly willing to accept the first claimant
for the post without insisting on any substantial proof of
identity, an attitude difficult to understand in the next-
of-kin. Much point was indeed made by Mr. Edwin PUGH
of the necessity of the understudy's possessing one brown
eye and one blue, but none of the relatives and friends
thought to observe the colour of either eye of either Sir
Theodore until the so-called Tommy, at a later stage, insisted
upon it. Even when they did look they do not seem to have
been very much impressed. They accepted the impostor off-
hand and refused to part with him when the genuine article,
upon a second and wiser thought, asserted himself. In
such circumstances it was not to be expected of the impostor
that he should voluntarily sacrifice ease and affluence and
return to Southwark Bridge. . . . Certainly there is little
that is new and less that is true in The Proof of the
Pudding (CHAPMAN AND HALL), but I am equally certain
that there is no harm and plenty of fun in it.

THE WORLD'S WORKERS.
THE BARLEY-sugar TwistER.
It is not uncommon to speak of this or the other book as
being “redolent of the soil,” but I think I never met a story
in which the soil played a more actual and conspicuous'
part than it does in O Pioneers 1 (HEINEMANN). It is a tale,
as you may just possibly have guessed from the title, about
the settlers in a new country, and a vigorous, earthy and
altogether unusual tale it is. The name of the writer, Miss
WILLA SIBERT CATHER, is unfamiliar to me, but I daresay
she has a transatlantic reputation, and, if so, it is certainly
deserved. Her story is of a family of Swedish folk, pioneer
settlers in Nebraska, and their early hardships; how, under
the leadership of the girl Alexandra—left guardian and
controller of her brothers by a far-seeing father—these
troubles were overcome; and of the later prosperity that
came to the little clan in consequence of her management.
There is also thrown in a rather belated sensation in the
latter pages—jealousy and a double murder; but somehow
I could not be greatly moved by this. Nor could I reconcile
the very attractive coloured illustration of a fashionably
dressed young lady with my own conception of the practical
and hard-working Alexandra. But these are minor matters.
What really counts is the vivid sympathy with her scene
that Miss WILLA S BERT CATHER (if I may say so with all
respect, what remarkable names these American novelists
do have 1) clearly possesses; it has enabled her to convey
-- - - - an impression of the
land, both wild and
tamed, which alone
would suffice to confer
distinction on her work.

consciously, all adjacent male hearts, and is finally folded
in the arms of the benevolent baronet, Forcus; while
Bessie, bold and brazen, setting her cap at all and sundry,
failing in every duty, is left with the dull, disastrous
draper, Boult, for her portion. I can never bring myself
to believe that in a given household there can long
be any doubt as to which of the inmates is in love with
which of the callers, but our author makes a liberal use
of such mystifications. And, by the way, I wonder if
Mrs. Day would have said, “Environment has told on
Bessie,” so many years before the popularising of the
Darwinian jargon? And I also wonder whether the author,
writing (on p. 193) Reggie for Bernard, is really visualising
her scenes very keenly, or is just turning out so many
thousand words of wholesome story, somewhat over-
weighted with gloom, rather arbitrarily or (one might put
it) negatively dated, such as will ruffle no library censor's
breast, will please many of Mrs. MANN's admirers and will
disappoint a few who know her capable of better and less
“phenomenally ” facile stuff.

ARE GOLFERS SNOBBISH?
THE charge of snobbishness brought
against golfers by ABE MITCHELL (late
Mr. ABE MITCHELL) is one that has
aroused quite as much interest as it
deserves. Whatever grounds the emi-
nent professional may have for his
complaint, there appear to be reasons
for both agreement and disagreement
with his opinion.
One of our little band of special
investigators has been making a few
inquiries on a popular holiday course
in the South of England. “Golfers
snobbish?” exclaimed one breezy player
with whom he discussed the question.
Why, only
the other day—but you're not smoking.
Have one of mine—half-a-crown for
three, they cost, and worth it. Well,
as I was saying, only the other day I
played with a young chap down here,
and what do you think he was 2 A
bank clerk. Well, you know, I never
| said anything, not even when he beat me.
And we had a drink together afterwards,
just as if he was one of my own class.
Here's another instance: last Tuesday
I sent my caddie to ask a gentleman if
he would play with me—a very ordinary-
looking gentleman too. We got on
very friendly until the ninth green.
Then I asked him how many he had
five. Now I had been watching him
closely, and knew it was six, and I told
him so. I also told him to be careful
how he counted. Well, he took it quite
calmly; he even apologised for his
mistake—and yet, after the game was
over, I was informed that he was Lord
Dormy. Of course, when I saw him
next day I went up and apologised.
Not a bit snobbish, you see. No,
MITCHELL's prejudiced. No use
attaching any importance to these
working men—I know them. Let me
see, what paper did you say you
represent? Oh, do you? Well, let me
give you a lift in my car.”
“Certainly, I consider golfers an
intensely snobbish class,” said a
thoughtful-looking young man who
was searching for a ball among the
heather beyond the fourteenth. “For
instance, those two men who have just
gone through would have helped me
look for my ball if they had been
gentlemen, instead of shouting so
rudely. I had an experience here
three weeks ago which bears out
MITCHELL's complaint. I arrived late,
and only one player was waiting. So
we agreed to play together. My handi-
cap will, I hope, soon be 24; his, I
believe, was 6. After all, as I said to
him, a difference of eighteen is not
serious—it might be more. He was a

ºw
tried him with SHAw, the principles of
vegetarianism, eugenics and other topics
upon which intellectual persons may
converse, he was silent. I happened to
mention that my father was a draper,
and that, I believe, must have pre-
judiced him against me, for he has
never offered to play with me since,
and, indeed, appears to wish to avoid
me. But one of the biggest snobs
down here is a person with a woollen
jacket. You may have seen him. I
happened to get in a good brassie shot
one day—better than I expected—and
it fell rather near him. It may have
even struck him. That is how I first
noticed him. He is an offensively
snobbish and uncompanionable person,
in my opinion.”
From the Rules of Winchester Foot-
ball:—
“No player may back up a kick made by
one of his own side or play the ball in any
way, unless he was behind the ball at the time
when it was kicked, or has afterwards gone
back behind the point from which it was
kicked, or has since been kicked by a player of
his own side."
The most likely of these three saving
conditions is that he will be kicked by
a player of his own side for backing up
too soon—thus automatically (as it

taken, and he said he thought it was
were) becoming “onside" again.

seen simultaneously on the other side. The obvious house
for it, the Scala, did not compete.
The new revue at the Opprobrium, which has been called

| features. Among these is of course the wonderful staircase,
on which five hundred carpenters were at work night and
day. Another feature is a procession of the smartest dressed
men in London, wearing all the latest things in socks, ties
and waistcoats, who walk through the house from stalls to
gallery and then round the parapet of the dress circle singing
“The Glad-rag Rag.” All the company is American, but
there are a few vacancies still for programme-sellers, for
which English actors and actresses are invited to apply.
In addition to the very remarkable staircase effect which
is offered at the Delirium, on which no fewer than eight
hundred carpenters have been working, the new revue,

from the gallery to the stage, by which the performers

money could tempt from the United States, all wearing
different kinds of fur, the price of each being fixed to it
in legible figures. Orders for similar articles are received
in the box-office during each performance. The manage-

A TRUNK CALL.
LAst Wednesday, being the anniver-
sary of the Wednesday before, Celia
gave me a present of a door-knocker.
The knocker was in the shape of an
elephant's head (not life-size), and by
bumping the animal's trunk against
his chin you could produce a small
brass noise.
“It's for the library,” she explained
eagerly. “You're going to work there
this morning, aren't you ?”
“Yes, I shall be very busy,” I said
in my busy voice.
“Well, just put it up before you
start, and then if I have to interrupt
you for anything important, I can
knock with it. Do say you love it.”
“It's a dear, and so are you. Come
along, let's put it up.”
I got a small screwdriver, and with
very little loss of blood managed to
screw it into the door. Some people
are born screwists, some are not. I am
one of the nots.
“It's rather sideways,” said Celia
doubtfully.
“Osso erry,” I said.

I took my knuckle from my mouth.
“Not so very,” I repeated.
“I wish it had been straight.”
“So do I; but it's too late now.

largely to the screwdriver. Besides
elephants often do have their heads
sideways; I've noticed it at the Zoo.”
“Well, never mind. I think it's very
clever of you to do it at all. Now then,
you go in, and I'll knock and see if you
hear.” -
I went in and shut the door, Celia
remaining outside. After five seconds,
having heard nothing, but not wishing
to disappoint her, I said, “Come in,”
in the voice of one who has been
suddenly disturbed by a loud “Rat-tat.”
“I haven't knocked yet,” said Celia
from the other side of the door.
“Why not?”
“I was admiring him. He is jolly.
Do come and look at him again.”
I went out and looked at him again.
He really gave an air to the library
door.
“His face is rather dirty,” said Celia.
“I think he wants some brass polish
and a-and a bun.”
She ran off to the kitchen. I remained
behind with Jumbo and had a little
practice. The knock was not alto-
gether convincing, owing to the fact
that his chin was too receding for his
trunk to get at it properly. I could
hear it quite easily on my own side
of the door, but I felt rather doubtful
whether the sound would penetrate
the elephant—roar, bark, whistle or
whatever it is—I have never heard,
but I am told it is very terrible to
denizens of the jungle. Jumbo's cry
would not have alarmed an ant.
Celia came back with flannels and
things and washed Jumbo's face.
“There!” she said. “Now his mother
would love him again.” Very confi-
dently she propelled his trunk against
his chin and added, “Come in.”
“You can hear it quite plainly,” I
said quickly.
“It doesn't re–rever—reverberate—
is that the word 2" said Celia, “but
it's quite a distinctive noise. I'm sure
you'd hear it.”
“I’m sure I should. Let's try.”
“Not now. I'll try later on, when you
aren't expecting it. Besides, you must
begin your work. Good-bye. Work
hard.” She pushed me in and shut
the door.
I began to work.
I work best on the sofa ; I think
most clearly in what appears to the
hasty observer to be an attitude of
rest. But I am not sure that Celia
really understands this yet. Accord-
ingly, when a knock comes at the door
I jump to my feet, ruffle my hair, and
stride up and down the room with one
hand on my brow. “Come in,” I
call impatiently, and Celia finds me
absolutely in the throes. If there
should chance to be a second knock
later on, I make a sprint for the writing
desk, seize pen and paper, upset the ink
or not as it happens, and present to
anyone coming in at the door the most
thoroughly engrossed back in London.
But that was in the good old days
of knuckle-knocking. On this parti-
cular morning I had hardly written
more than a couple of thousand words
—I mean I had hardly got the cushions
at the back of my head comfortably
settled when Celia came in.
“Well?” she said eagerly.
I struggled out of the sofa.
“What is it?” I asked sternly.
“Did you hear it all right?”
“I didn't hear anything.”
“Oh ' " she said in great disappoint-
ment. “But perhaps you were asleep,”
she went on hopefully.
“Certainly not. I was working.
“Did I interrupt you?”
“You did rather ; but
matter.”
“Oh, well, I won't do it again–
unless I really have to. Good-bye,
and good luck.”
She went out and I returned to my
sofa. After an hour or so my mind
began to get to work, and 1 got up and
walked slowly up and down the room.
The gentle exercise seemed to stimulate

corner of the room, I took it up (my
brain full of other things) and, drop-
ping a golf ball on the carpet, began
to practise. After five or ten minutes,
my ideas being now quite clear, I was
just about to substitute the pen for the
putter when Celia came in.
“Oh ' " she said. “Are—are you
busy 2"
I turned round from a difficult putt
with the club in my hand. .
“Very,” I said. “What is it?”
“I don't want to disturb you if you're
working x -
“I am.”
“But I just wondered if you—if you
liked artichokes.”
I looked at her coldly.
“I will fill in your confession book
another time,” I said stiffly, and I sat
down with dignity at my desk and
dipped the putter in the ink.
“It's for dinner to-night,” said Celia
persuasively. “Do say. Because I
don't want to eat them all by myself.”
I saw that I should have to humour
her.
“If it's a Jerusalem artichoke you
mean, yes,” I said; “the other sort,
no. J. Arthur Choke I love.”
“Right-o, Sorry for interrupting.”
And then as she went to the door,
“You did hear Jumbo this time, didn't
you?”
“I believe that's the only reason you
came in for.”
“Well, one of them.”
“Are you coming in again 2"
“Don’t know,” she smiled. “Depends

“Right,” I said. “In that case
There was nothing else for it; I took
up my pen and began to work.

Celia. At present, although Jumbo is
really mine, she is having all the fun
with him. And as long as Jumbo is
on the outside of the door there can
never rise an occasion when I should
want to use him. My idea is that I
should unscrew Jumbo and put him on
the inside of the door, so that I can
knock when I come out.
And when Celia wants to come in
she will warn me in the old-fashioned
way with her knuckles . . . and I
shall have time, to do something
about it. A. A. M.

IT’S THOROUGH AS DOES IT.
AN American cablegram states that
a wealthy citizen of Auburn, N.Y., has

“He has taken this method of becoming

his experiences in his prosecution of

regularly he was committed by a judge
who is an intimate friend of his. He
will remain thirty days in the prison,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. CARRUTHERS.
PICKING up a paper a fortnight or so
ago I read this: “Never find fault with
or criticise your husband directly. If
you dislike his ways, criticise the same
thing in another person, and your hus-
band will be likely to take the hint.”
Let me say at once that this is not
true. He is unlikely to take the hint,
as I can prove. Nor is it wise counsel
either. On the contrary, it is fraught
with danger, and my advice to all wives
is to have nothing to do with it, but,
when they have fault to find, to find it
in the good old-fashioned style—right
out.
Listen.
For the moment I was taken with
the idea, and decided to try it. Henry
(my husband) has not a few vexatious
ways that get on my nerves, one of
which is rising from the table directly
he has finished his meal, no matter at
what stage I, who am a slower eater,
happen to be. Having previously said
nothing about this I chose it as my
opening experiment.
“I lunched with Mrs. Carruthers
to-day,” I said casually at dinner.
“Did you?” Henry replied. “Is it
a nice house?”
“Quite,” I said.
“And what is Carruthers like 2 " he
asked. (I may say that Mrs. Carruthers
is a new acquaintance.)
Now, as a matter of fact, Mr. Car-
ruthers was not there at all; but
obviously this kind of corrective treat-
ment demands inventive power in the
corrector or it cannot go on; for how
is one actually to find men with all
one's husband's bad habits?
“Oh,” I said, as non-committally as
possible, “the ordinary kind of man.
But he has one detestable mannerism.”
“Only one?” Henry answered easily.
“One very noticeable one to-day,” I
replied. “He got up and left the table
directly he had finished.”
“While you were still eating?” Henry
asked with interest.
“Yes.”
“The low swine!” said Henry; and,
even as he said it, he threw down his
napkin and sauntered off, although I
had but just begun a pear.
What was I to do? In the ordinary
way I should have drawn attention to
his own inconsistency, but the paper
so particularly said that direct means
were to be avoided; and I therefore
sat on dumb and enraged.
A day or so later I tried again, and
again I employed Mr. Carruthers as
my terrible example.
Henry has a very annoying—more

I said that I had recently made her
acquaintance.
“You'll love her,” said Mrs. Wyse.
“Such a dear! And such a sad life

I began to feel vaguely alarmed.
“Yes,” Mrs. Wyse repeated, “you'll

“But not her husband,” Henry re-
plied, with a laugh. “We shall never
love him—not with that deadly way he
has of leaving the table directly he has
finished gobbling his food and all his
other little tricks. Oh no, not Car-

she said at last. “You are not likely

And now what chance have I to take
any line at all about anything my
husband does?

banned; new plays are produced and
withdrawn; there are earthquakes, fires
and fights in foreign parts. Yet yester-
day The Megaphone announced on its

GOLF.
(With full acknowledgments to our
illuminating contemporaries.)
I.—THE ART of LoNG DRIVING.
THERE is no doubt that the player
who can drive a long ball from the tee
gets further than his less fortunate
confrére who is a short driver. Much
has been, and will be, written on the
art of long driving. How is this
desideratum of all followers of the
Royal and Ancient Game to be attained?
That is what I am about to tell you.
Some men when going all out for a
long one from the tee play their ball
with a little pull on it; others merely
drive a straight ball down the middle
of the course. Anyway, as I have said,
the player who hits a long ball gets
further than the one who hits a short
ball, and consequently he needs a
shorter shot to reach the green with
his second.
Speaking of reaching the green
reminds me of two of the most remark-
able shots I ever witnessed. I was
playing for the Championship of Texas,
U.S.A., in 19–. My partner was
Mr. “Slick” Samson, the celebrated
professional amateur. At the 14th he
pulled his drive into the rough. When
we came up to the ball it was neatly
cupped in a lark's nest which contained
four eggs. Now I am betraying no
previous greens, Samson had been put
off by the incessant singing of a sky-
lark, and had missed holing three 25 feet
putts in succession: a most unusual
thing for him. I therefore expected to
see him take his revenge by lifting nest,
eggs, and ball all on to the green
together with his niblick. But I was
disappointed. Instead, he took his
mashie and played the ball with such
nicety that it landed dead within 2 feet
of the pin, and the eggs remained in
the nest unbroken ; not even cracked.
Strange to say, the other remarkable
shot was made by the same player on
the same course. The game was all
square at the 17th. We both had good
drives at the 18th ; but Samson had
the misfortune to find a rabbit-hole, his
ball lying about 8% inches inside the
front entrance. Here was a quandary
It was the only rabbit-hole on the
course, and had been constructed sub-
sequent to the drafting of the local
rules, so that no provision was made
for this contingency. If he picked up,
it meant losing the match. He walked
forward, towards the green, with a
worried look on his face. Then, return-
ing, he took his niblick and hit with
tremendous force. The ball disappeared

can, our undisguised amazement when it
bolted out of Brer Rabbit's back-door,
about 5 yards from the green, and came
to rest within 2 feet of the pin. (If I
recorded the exact distance—6 inches
—many golfers might be tempted to
doubt my veracity.) Needless to say,
I lost the hole and the match.
But I am digressing. I merely
mention these two shots because I am
trying to get a good length with my
article, which reminds me that “The
art of long driving” is the subject
under discussion. Well, I hope that,
after a careful perusal of these few
practical hints, you will find that you
are consistently getting a longer ball
from the tee than you did formerly.
If you succeed in doing this you will
experience a feeling of true satisfaction.
Next week I hope to publish [in
another journal.-E.D.] a few hints on
“The art of approaching.”
“Promoters of all kinds of public meetings
and entertainments should assimilate the
lesson contained in the appended extract from
an appreciative letter addressed to the Editor
of this Journal. The writer, a consistent and
persistent advertiser, cvidently knows a good
thing when found, and, quite unsolicited by
us, has written as follows:–

John looked important and mys-
terious. “The fact is,” he announced,
“Eva and I are going to get married.”
“Ah!" said I, “so that is why you
got engaged, is it?”
“Yes. Three weeks to-morrow. We
shall want a parson, a bridesmaid or
two and a best man. There is work
for all. Will you help?”
“What will it cost me?” I asked.
“You know, you have omitted to men-
tion the other things you want and, I
have no doubt, mean to have. Look
here—will you take five shillings in
cash and the rest by monthly instal-
ments 2'"
John protested that he would be
quite content with my mere blessing,
so fine a fellow was I (as I am).
“Good,” I said. “But then there is
always Eva's point of view. Hadn't
we better get straight to business?
What about a sugar-siſter?”
“It's awfully kind of you, old boy,
and there is nothing we should have
liked better. But Eva and I intend to
live quite simply, and we feel that the
six sugar-siſters we have already re-
ceived will see us through.”

aloud. “We shall want a house and

The function was a complete success,

I can never be too grateful to Eva
for choosing so charming a Chief
Bridesmaid as Gladys, for I take it
that, whatever she had been like, it
was my duty (as Best Man) to fall in
love with her. I opened the subject
by complimenting her on her choice
of a First-Thing-in-the-Morning Tea-
service, which I considered much
superior to the other three samples of
the same convenience appearing among
the numerous and costly presents.
“Let's go and look for yours,” she
said, but 1 felt that what I had to say
could best be said in a more private
corner.
“Probably they couldn't hold back

led her apart. . . . The result of our
conversation was such that I foresaw
that a schedule of our own would be-
come necessary at a later stage. So I
felt I could not do better than make a
list of the presents that John and Eva
had received.
When John had recovered from his
wedding, I thought that it was high
time to be getting on with my own.
So I called upon him.
“I have here,” I said, “a list . . .”
“Splendid,” he answered, with a
great show of enthusiasm. “If you
will forgive an experienced man ad-
vising you, I may say that the whole
question of conjugal happiness depends
entirely upon what you drink and
when. Have you, for instance, a First-
Thing-in-the-Morning Tea-service on
your list?”
“We have,” said I.
John was inclined to be jubilant, but
Eva, who was standing by and has a
better memory for detail, checked him.
“We have never ceased to be grateſul
for Gladys's delightful gift,” said she.
“I don't know what we should do
without it.”
I think that perhaps John did know,
but he had learnt wisdom in this short
time and said nothing.
“Have you a sugar-siſter on the
list?” asked Eva, tentatively.
“Six,” said I. “But perhaps I
ought to tell you that it is in some
ways a peculiar list and contains only
the things we can do without.”
“Does it even include,” asked Eva
in desperation, “the handsome marble
timepiece John's Uncle Frank gave
us?”
“Underlined in red ink,” I stated,
“and marked with an asterisk by way

John tumbled to it at last. “It
looks to me,” he said, “as if we shall
have to buy you something.”
I deprecated this extreme measure.
“No, no. Our list doesn't include
everything you had given you.”
Eva brightened visibly. I think she
had the foolish hope of getting rid of
the antimacassars of the faithful

“We haven't included the cheques,”
I explained. “If you're pressed for

On Tuesday last my partner and I
were earnestly discussing the latest
phases of the Insurance Act when there
occurred a gentle tapping at the door
marked “PRIVATE.” My partner went
deathly pale, but having paid my tailor
the previous week and sent a post-dated
cheque to the Gas Company, I rose
with an easy grace, opened the door
and closed it behind me. I found my-
self in the passage—I usually do on
these occasions, so was not particularly
surprised at the scenery—and facing
a charming girl of about twenty-two,
as near as I could judge. She smiled
sweetly; I bowed. In her hand was
one of those small yellow leather cases
that people of either sex so often carry,
big enough to hold night-gear and a
tooth-brush, or possibly a couple of
small bombs.
As my fair visitor continued to smile
and say nothing, I mentally ran over
the list of people I ought to know and
don't always recognise, but I couldn't
place her.
“It's no good,” I said. “I’m sorry.
I ought to remember you, but frankly
I don’t l”
Still she smiled.
“I say, you know,” I said, “you
might let me into the secret.”
At last she made an effort to speak
but failed; so, fearing that she was
very nervous, I said cheerfully—
“Do you mind coming round to the
outer office; there's no one there, and
we can have a heart to heart talk about
this little matter?
“Now,” I said, when she was seated,
“are you a niece who has grown out
of all recognition ? If so, I will fall
on your neck. I adore my relations,
especially those who are strangers to
me. Can I say more?”
At last her voice managed to force
its way through the pearly portals, and
she spoke.
“Do you wear–er—neckties 2"
As I happened to be wearing my
tennis-club tie—and the Ealing Ram-
blers' tie is universally execrated by
the question seemed unnecessary.
“Well, yes,” I said, “funnily enough
I do, when I don't forget to put one on.”
Almost unconsciously I put my hand
to the tie enclosure.
THERE are two outside doors to our|.
jealous outsiders for its obtrusiveness—
see,” I said with one of my most
brilliant smiles.
Her eyes followed the direction of
my hand and she smiled again, rather
broadly I thought.
Then she began to fumble with the
clasp of the leather case. Her hand
shook. Clearly she was a beginner.
“Allow me,” I said. “If you have
a tie to pit against mine I will accept
the challenge.”
“What I want to show you,” she
said, “is not so—er—striking, but much
more wonderful.”
She opened the case, exposing two or
three dozen neatly-folded neckties, and,
running her finger lightly over an
octave or so, selected a black silk one
with a purple leit motif.
“There,” she said, holding it poised
lightly in her left hand.
“Well, what about it 2 " I said.
“Very nice design, certainly, but * x
“Wait,” she said, making a swift
movement with her left hand and gently
stroking the tie with her right,
I thought I must be suffering from
myopia; in place of the purple spots
were white triangles, parallelograms
and other geometric shapes dotted
about on the black silk. Before I had
time to express my astonishment the
sorceress executed two more feats of
legerdemain, the colour and shape of
the pattern changing with each feat.
“Look here,” I said, trying to
suppress my excitement, “if you can
teach me to perform these mysteries
and your terms are not too high, I will
have one of your conjuring outfits.”
“Eighteenpence,” she said briefly,
laying the tie on the table.
I turned it over and over. Each end
had a different pattern on each side or
face of it—four neckties for eighteen-
pence!
“This,” I said, “is the greatest thing

IF I am not mistaken a good many people besides old
Anglo-Indians will delight in Miss S. MacNAUGHTAN's Snow
upon the Desert (Hodder AND SToughton). At the end
of the story the young married woman who is its chief
character—
Like snow upon the desert's dusky face,
Lighting a little hour or two—is gone.
But before she goes to meet old Charon, in spite of her
occasionally sharp or rather reckless tongue, in spite of her
carelessness about public opinion and the damning fact that
a brilliant young V.C. had first sent in his papers and then
shot himself because his love for her had broken his career
and his heart, she had done far more than ninety-and-nine
just persons to make life happier and smoother and more
amusing for her fellow countrymen and countrywomen.
“She came out here,” says the author, “when she was very
youthful, very full of courage, and with her beauty and her
great charm to refresh us, and we loved her and blamed
her, found fault with her, and could not do without her.
We were not always merciful to her, but perhaps that need
not be remembered now. At one time she was perhaps one
of the most prominent figures in India, and certainly the
most admired.” And yet her life was a tragedy. To me she
stands as a type of English womanhood in India, of the
courage and sadness and self-sacrifice that so often accom-
pany the apparently selfish pursuit of pleasure of that
glittering exile. I speak of her as if she were a real person,
which perhaps is the case. That, at any rate, is the effect
her characters are wonderfully alive, as if indeed they were
not only types but realities. Some of them are very lovable, |
some, like their author, are distinctly humorous, and their
story makes a clean, wholesome and refreshing book.

Of mediaeval schemes and plottings,

a novel as I have ever read. Oliver “desired a permanent
base on which to build his life,” and, after several un-
successful attempts to find it, gave up the struggle and,
following the advice of MARCUs AURELIUs, “walked gravely
and handsomely into the other world.” Nothing of any
moment brightened his life, and nothing of any moment
brightens the story of it. He is so constituted that women
do not interest him, nor religion, nor art, nor even the
intellectual atmosphere of Hampstead. He tries them all

in turn and they fail to grip him. The experiment of
thinking for an instant of anybody except himself he omits
to try. It is a pity, for it might have made all the differ-
ence. The question whether it was worth while to write a
three hundred and sixteen page novel about this extra-
ordinarily futile young man is one that need not be dis-
cussed. Mr. HoRSNELL has done it, and done it so well
that it is only occasionally that he allows the reader to be
irritated. The irritation comes in the retrospect, when
I have just enjoyed a most pleasant and very inexpensive
holiday in Venice and St. Petersburgh with Mr. Rothay
REYNoLDs as my guide, and only wish the story of The
Gondola (MILLS AND BooN) were as fascinating as its
atmosphere. The author of My I?ussian Year has used
his knowledge to such good purpose that the setting of his
tale is quite excellent, and I fear to seem a little insensible
of benefits bestowed if I suggest that the only reason 1
can find for the laying of the opening scenes in Venice is
He
would have done better for the construction of his book if
he had laid them in St. Petersburgh. But, even so, The
Gondola remains an attractive love-story of the old-fashioned
type. For one thing it has done me the rare service of an
introduction to a charming Polish countess, for whose
acquaintance I am peculiarly grateful. So accustomed
have I grown to the abnormally wicked Polish countesses
of modern fiction that it was difficult at first to believe in
one wonders why the author
should have concentrated
his attention upon Oliver
when, with his gift for
character and his minute
observation, he could have
dealt equally well with some
more stimulating hero.
Suppose we were playing
a game in which I told you
the characters and setting
of a book, and you guessed
the author. Well, with re-

bably exclaim, “A. C. BENson,” and win. If, however,
I had not been interrupted I might have gone on to tell
you much more about the book: for example, that it is
not a volume of meditations, but a real story, with several
admirably studied characters, and a hero and heroine
who marry. To be sure the action is less physical than
emotional, but that you would expect; and I suppose there
are few writers who can convey thoughts with a surer and
more delicate touch than Mr. A. C. BENsoN. Throughout
I was fascinated by two things—his sense of atmosphere,
and the skill with which he has presented the point of view
of “forty and a bittock” when confronted with youth.
Howard Kennedy, the central figure, is drawn with an
extraordinary sympathy and minuteness; in his amiable
but lonely college existence, his courtship, and the sorrow
and consolations of his married life, the man is wonderfully
human. There are other characters, too, which I should
like to praise in detail—a most actual undergraduate for one,
and his father, whose loquacious enthusiasm on every possi-
ble topic is a thing of pure joy. Watersprings, in short, is
exactly the story, tender, introspective and lovable, that
Mr. A. C. BENsoN's countless admirers will most thank
Welsh valley, finds unaccountable sinister influences at
work; strange accidents happen to men and machines,
and a despairing depression of spirits settles over him.
The mountains, the river, and the trees seem to him to
have a threatening life, and the visionary Welsh shepherd,
Morgan, “of the blood of Morgan Ap Owaine,” quite simply
accepting the fact that they have, drives home the stark
reality to the terrified consciousness of this prosaic Glasgow
man. He finds the diary of his predecessor, who, more in
harmony with the spirit that moves in the undergrowth,
has found the peace of death. With Forsyth the thing
brings a decline to intemperance and despair, Destiny, like
Caliban upon Setebos, choosing to act in this arbitrary way.
Perhaps the authors had no strict right, as story-tellers, to
leave suspended and unexplained the episode of wild
Meredith's sacrifice of a sheep in the circle of stones on Pen
Savaddan. But they have woven a convincing tissue of
eeriness with the plausible suggestion of an esoteric know-
ledge which an unlearned reader may not challenge.

cussed. Mr. HoRsNELL has done it, and done it so well
that it is only occasionally that he allows the reader to be
irritated. The irritation comes in the retrospect, when
he had laid them in St. Petersburgh. But, even so, The
Gondola remains an attractive love-story of the old-fashioned
type. For one thing it has done me the rare service of an
introduction to a charming Polish countess, for whose

bably exclaim, “A. C. BENson,” and win. If, however,
I had not been interrupted I might have gone on to tell
you much more about the book: for example, that it is
not a volume of meditations, but a real story, with several
admirably studied characters, and a hero and heroine
who marry. To be sure the action is less physical than
emotional, but that you would expect; and I suppose there
are few writers who can convey thoughts with a surer and
more delicate touch than Mr. A. C. BENson. Throughout
I was fascinated by two things—his sense of atmosphere,
and the skill with which he has presented the point of view
of “forty and a bittock” when confronted with youth.
Howard Kennedy, the central figure, is drawn with an
extraordinary sympathy and minuteness; in his amiable
but lonely college existence, his courtship, and the sorrow
and consolations of his married life, the man is wonderfully
human. There are other characters, too, which I should
like to praise in detail—a most actual undergraduate for one,
and his father, whose loquacious enthusiasm on every possi-
ble topic is a thing of pure joy. Watersprings, in short, is
exactly the story, tender, introspective and lovable, that

and a despairing depression of spirits settles over him.
The mountains, the river, and the trees seem to him to
have a threatening life, and the visionary Welsh shepherd,
Morgan, “of the blood of Morgan Ap Owaine,” quite simply
accepting the fact that they have, drives home the stark
reality to the terrified consciousness of this prosaic Glasgow
man. He finds the diary of his predecessor, who, more in
harmony with the spirit that moves in the undergrowth,
has found the peace of death. With Forsyth the thing
brings a decline to intemperance and despair, Destiny, like
Caliban upon Setebos, choosing to act in this arbitrary way.
Perhaps the authors had no strict right, as story-tellers, to
leave suspended and unexplained the episode of wild
Meredith's sacrifice of a sheep in the circle of stones on Pen
Savaddan. But they have woven a convincing tissue of
eeriness with the plausible suggestion of an esoteric know-
ledge which an unlearned reader may not challenge.

How THE LIBERALs GoT THERE.
[" Liberalism has been successful because in all its quarrels it tries
patiently to understand and make allowances for the sincere point of
view of the other side.”—Mr. Winston Churchill's speech at Dundee.]
MEN of the City of Marmalade,
Stern by nature and sweet by trade,
Every morning you hear new tales
How Victory sits on the Party's sails;
Has it ever occurred to you to guess
What is the secret of our success 2
Here are the facts: we have always tried
To get at the sense of the other side;
We have made allowances all along
For what is sincere, though plainly wrong;
Ever we say, as we fight like hell,
“They don't know better, but may mean well "
A typical case. My old friend GEORGE,
When he went, all out, for the ducal gorge—
What was the burning thought that lay
At the back of his head down Limehouse way ?
He was taking the landlord's point of view;
He was making allowance for blood that 's blue.
So with his great Insurance Act,
Marked by the most amazing tact.
Counsel he took with the Tory camp -.
On the vital question of licking the stamp,
And constantly racked his fertile brains
To appease the Unionist Mary Janes.
Similar care we have freely spent
In the matter of Disestablishment.
Before we fully arranged to wrest
To secular use the Church's chest,
"We took incredible pains to find
Whether the Clergy would really mind.
The Chamber of Peers is another case
Where we sought to save the enemy's face.
We might have prescribed a deadly cure
For the scandal of primogeniture;-- * ~ *
But we simply suspended its doom in air -
By a brief Preamble—and left it there. , ,
So it has been with the Home Rule Bill: . .
We have patiently sought, and are seeking still,
Though Ulster's wrongs are the merest myth,
To make allowance for F. E. SMITH,
And pleaded for grace (from yonder skies)
To see the picture with CARsoN's eyes.
Enough ' To assume a kindly tone **
With those who honestly err; to own
That even a Tory's heart may be
Just possibly human—there you see
The methods that made us what we are,
And how we have climbed so fast and far.
So now I have told you all about
A thing you'd never have guessed without;
It's my own idea, and I don't suppose
That anyone else in the Party knows;
Certainly Asquith hasn't yet

“Oh, but I should soon get her into a receiving humour.

and she would be deeply interested, and the whole thing
would go off splendidly. Do let me try.”
“I tell you,” she repeated, “it’s no good.
“WHAT!!” I said convulsively.
“Shouting,” said Francesca, “won't alter it.”
“Another dream shattered,” I said. “Who wouldn't
shout at the disappearance of so fair a vision ? Why, oh
why must she go?”

AUTHORS DISCUSS CHINA.
TURKs DISCUSS AUTHORs' IDLUMIN-
ATING UTTERANCEs.
As a result of the clarifying effect on
public opinion of the recent discussion
of the ethos of the Turk at the Authors'
Club, a debate of authors on the China-
man was held at Caxton Hall last
Friday, Mr. CHARLEs GARVICE again
presiding. In his introductory remarks
the Chairman observed that although
he had never personally visited China,
he had attended a performance of The
Yellow Jacket and preferred Mandarin
to Seville oranges. Men of letters, he
continued, would always regard China
with sympathy in view of the stimu-
lating effect of opium on the genius of
DE QUINCEY and CoI.ERIDGE, though
water.
Mr. JoHN GALsworthy was
not present, but he wrote a
letter, which the Chairman read,
to the effect that, if it could be
authoritatively ascertained that
most Chinamen married the
wrong woman first, he would
extend his patronage to the race.
Otherwise China was no place
for a conscientious English
novelist.
| Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT also
wrote stating that he had not as
yet gone very deeply into the
matter of China, but when next
he had half-an-hour to spare he
would devote it to the compo-
sition of an article instructing
the Chinese in all the duties
of life.
Mr. BANISTER FLETCHER,
F.R.I.B.A., who apologised for
they had taken to China instead of
Indian tea the cause of Home Rule
had progressed by leaps and bounds.
Again, Ireland was famous for its
ginger-ale, the raw material for which
was principally imported from Canton.
Speaking for himself, it was one of the
greatest disappointments of his journal-
istic life when the late DowAGER EM-
PREss of CHINA declined to contribute
an account of her early life to the
columns of P.A.P.
The Mayor of WESTMINSTER paid a
handsome tribute to the efficiency of
the municipal administration of Pekin.
That city was far ahead of Kensington,
Was this economy necessary? Was
it not rather an insult to the 450
millions of patient Orientals now ruled
by YUAN SHIH-KAI ? He was no scare-
monger, but if ever we were confronted
by a Yellow Peril it would be largely
due to such acts as these.
By way of supplement to this
interesting debate we may give a brief
summary of the speeches made at a
meeting held in Constantinople last
week to discuss the tone and tendencies |
of British authors, with TALAAT BEY |
in the chair.
TALAAT said that the time had come
to decide whether the importation of

Ottoman Empire.
AHMED RIZA said that what
was wrong with the British
authors was their lack of idealism.
There were exceptions, of course,
but the worst of it was that the
few idealists were pessimists to
the core. Take GALsworthy,
for , instance, who had given
such a fine picture of the
English aristocracy in The Patri-
cian, but whose later works
gave him (AHMED Riza) the
pure plp.
ENVER BEY, while admitting
his indebtedness to HERBERT
SPENCER, deplored the decadent
spirit which animated most
English novelists, with the ex-
ception of the Brothers HocKING
and the Baroness ORCzy.
HILNIC PASHA followed on
similar lines. The censorship
the lateness of his arrival, ex-
plaining that he had been detained by
a dress-rehearsal at the Gas Congress,
delivered an exhaustive address on the
of motorists. Such a thing would not
be tolerated in Pekin.
Mr. W. B. MAxwell, said that China

food for thought.
Mr. SILAs K. HockING, who followed,
said that it was a commonplace of

liked there; but the melancholy result
was that very little was published.
Why this should be so he could not
imagine.
Mr. FILsoN YouNG observed that he

mobility of China. Yet they had aban-
doned the pig-tail, and the Deputies at

from the moral point of view Turkish
romances were above reproach, whereas
in England the great majority of
novelists were engaged in a carnival of
competitive impropriety.
DJAVID PASHA noted the extraordinary
inconsistency of British authors, who,
while criticising the domestic morals of
the Turks, yet encouraged them in their
writings. He understood that one of
the most popular works recently pub-
lished in England was entitled, Some

AUTHORS DISCUSS CHINA.
TURKs Discuss AUTHORs' ILLUMIN-
ATING UTTERANCEs.
As a result of the clarifying effect on
public opinion of the recent discussion
of the ethos of the Turk at the Authors'
Club, a debate of authors on the China-
man was held at Caxton Hall last
Friday, Mr. CHARLEs GARVICE again
presiding. In his introductory remarks
the Chairman observed that although
he had never personally visited China,
he had attended a performance of The
Yellow Jacket and preferred Mandarin
to Seville oranges. Men of letters, he
continued, would always regard China
with sympathy in view of the stimu-
lating effect of opium on the genius of
DE QUINCEY and CoI.ERIDGE, though
they had taken to China instead of
Indian tea the cause of Home Rule
had progressed by leaps and bounds.
Again, Ireland was famous for its
ginger-ale, the raw material for which
was principally imported from Canton.
Speaking for himself, it was one of the
greatest disappointments of his journal-
istic life when the late DowAGER EM-
PREss of CHINA declined to contribute
an account of her early life to the
columns of P.A.P.
The Mayor of WESTMINSTER paid a
handsome tribute to the efficiency of
the municipal administration of Pekin.
That city was far ahead of Kensington,
Was this economy necessary? Was
it not rather an insult to the 450
millions of patient Orientals now ruled
by YUAN SHIH-KAI ? He was no scare-
monger, but if ever we were confronted
by a Yellow Peril it would be largely
due to such acts as these.
By way of supplement to this
interesting debate we may give a brief
summary of the speeches made at a
meeting held in Constantinople last
week to discuss the tone and tendencies
of British authors, with TALAAT BEY |
in the chair.
TALAAT said that the time had come

Mr. John GALsworthy was
not present, but he wrote a
letter, which the Chairman read,
to the effect that, if it could be
authoritatively ascertained that
most Chinamen married the
wrong woman first, he would
extend his patronage to the race.
Otherwise China was no place
for a conscientious English
novelist.
Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT also
wrote stating that he had not as
yet gone very deeply into the
matter of China, but when next
he had half-an-hour to spare he
would devote it to the compo-
sition of an article instructing
the Chinese in all the duties
of life.

AHMED Riza said that what
was wrong with the British
authors was their lack of idealism.
There were exceptions, of course,
but the worst of it was that the
few idealists were pessimists to
the core. Take GALsworthy,
for instance, who had given
such a fine picture of the
English aristocracy in The Patri-
cian, but whose later works
gave him (AHMED RIzA) the

DNVER BEY, while admitting
his indebtedness to HERBERT
SPENCER, deplored the decadent
spirit which animated most
English novelists, with the ex-
ception of the Brothers HockING
and the Baroness ORCzy.
HILNIC PASHA followed on
similar lines. The censorship
in Turkey was purely political;
from the moral point of view Turkish
romances were above reproach, whereas
in England the great majority of
novelists were engaged in a carnival of
competitive impropriety.
DJAVID PASHA noted the extraordinary
inconsistency of British authors, who,
while criticising the domestic morals of
the Turks, yet encouraged them in their
writings. He understood that one of
the most popular works recently pub-
lished in England was entitled, Some
Earperiences of an Irish Harem.
Ultimately a resolution was unani-

with the Libraries Association in Lon-

THOUGHTS.
THINK, when you sleep
And slip alone into a world of dream,
That fairies creep
Up to the darkling house by glow-
worm gleam ;
And then kind-eyed
They cast delicious spells at your bed-
side,
And take you in their keeping
When you are sleeping.
In and out and round about, while
moonshine is peeping
Through the dimity curtains on the
- floor and counterpane,
Puck with his fairy broom is furbishing
and sweeping,
And all the rest in the dimpsey light
are dancing, ring and chain,
Cross hands and down the middle
and cross hands again.
Think, when you wake
And blink your eyelids at the morning's
blue,
That fairies slake
Their dainty thirst upon the garden dew,
And tell the flowers
To dress and give them breakfast in
their bowers,
And set the sunbeams shaking
When you are waking.
Here and there and everywhere, when
broad day is breaking
They troop into the garden, very
eager to be fed.
If the dew is not delivered, what a fuss
they will be making!
But at last they wander back into
the wood and go to bed,
With yawns of gapy gossamer, each
fairy sleepy-head.
Mr. BIRRELL, in acknowledging the
receipt of the freedom of Glasgow,

to have escaped his memory.

Beginner. “I woSDER what THE CLUB 's LIKE I ought To HAVE USED HERE 2 NoNE of THESE SEEM QUITE RIGHT!”
SPEEDING THE LINGERING
GUEST.
SoME remarks which appeared in a
leading provincial newspaper the other
day upon the “concentrated essence
of hospitality” which is extended at
modern week-end shooting parties may
perhaps have been received with resent-
ment by certain society hostesses con-
cerned. “Modern hospitality,” it was
explained, “is quite shameless in fixing
the hour of arrival and departure for
guests; in some country houses the
hint is conveyed by the tiny cake
of “visitor's soap” in the bedrooms,
symbolical of the brief time guests are
expected to stay.” One has always
had a feeling that that is the sort of
thing that ought not to be given away
in the press, but as our contemporary
has made a start in this direction we
may perhaps take the opportunity of
discussing the subject more fully.
The system of the symbolical soap
does not always work quite so smoothly
as one might think. There is a story
now going the rounds of an old gentle-
man, quite incapable of consciously
committing a faua pas, who neverthe-
less made himself extremely unpopular
at a well-known country house in the
as the whole truth was known, he was
completelyexonerated. It happened that
the housemaid, in preparing his room,
had carelessly left behind her a large
slab of household soap, on which the
old gentleman worked away for several
weeks, never dreaming that he would
be expected to leave before he reached
the end of it. One cannot, however, so
easily excuse a certain Army officer,
who now finds all doors in society
closed to him. For it is said that he had
committed the unpardonable gaucherie
of ringing for more soap.
But symbolical soap as a means of
getting rid of one's friends is rapidly
going out. Involving as it does the
personal habits and tastes of the various
guests it has been found altogether too
rigid in its operations. Some hostesses,
too, prefer a more direct hint and sim-
ply cut off the food supply; but this
is not done at the best houses. It is
considered more delicate to disturb the
even tenor of the guest's tranquillity
by a series of slight but cumulative
impediments.
Thus he will find that his morning
tea is stone cold; that the fire in his
bedroom is allowed to go out at 9 P.M.;
that only one of his boots has been
- blacked. If these fail there are other
Midlands by grossly outstaying his wel-
and more drastic means, for the modern
it is a question of speeding the linger-
ing guest. He will find a Bradshaw
beneath his pillow, or, if he has brought
his motor, hischauffeur will beinstructed
to hang about in unexpected places
waiting for orders. Sometimes the car
is even brought round and kept waiting
at the front door.
In the case of extreme obtuseness,
further steps may sometimes have to
be taken. The delinquent will find
that he has to unpack his bag several
times a day and to be continually
retrieving his golf-clubs from the front
hall, where they arelying in conspicuous
readiness for his departure. And at
last, when he goes up to his room to
make ready for luncheon, he will be
shocked to discover that the blinds are
down and the carpet up, while a couple
of workmen are busy with the electric
light. Then it will come home to him.
The game is up and he must go.
But it must not be supposed that he
will be made to suffer any embarrass-
ment in his farewells. The modern
hostess is the very impersonation of
tact.

turned the corner.
“You’re just the man I want to see,”
he said. “I want your advice.”
“You won't take it,” I replied. “No
one ever does. But come in here any
way.” I drew him into a doorway.
“It's like this,” he said. “I want
to know how to reply to a letter I've
had from the Earl of Frocester.”
“An earl!” I exclaimed. “Things

“Well,” I said, “that's simple enough.

“No,” said George, “I didn't.”
“Why not?” I asked.

here, am I ?”
I assured him he was not—very much

“And you would have said that my

“I should think so,” I said.
“Well,” he said, “other people had
had letters of invitation like this a full

me to counter that.
“Oh, well,” he said, “never mind;

all, that's of some importance in the

“Most certainly,” I said.

THE KAISER becomes more and more
like Sir Joseph Lyons every day. We
all know that he paints pictures; so
does Sir Joseph. The KAISER can do
deadly work with the pen; and Sir
Joseph also is a writer. The KAISER
preaches; and even Sir Joseph has
been known to hold forth. Now we
are informed by The Daily News that
the KAISER owns a café; and still more
so does Sir Joseph Lyons. His
IMPERIAL MAJESTY, we understand,
occasionally drops into his own
restaurant for a little light refreshment;
and here again, if our information is
correct, he follows the great English
restaurateur's example.
“If KAISER WILHELM is going
seriously into the business, however,”
Sir Joseph is alleged to have said to a
representative of the Press the other
day, “I am sorry for him. Forty to
fifty per cent. profit is not so easy to
make in these days.”
“But supposing he employed good
musicians and gave orders for his own

thoughtfully out of the window, as if
the pools of memory had been stirred,
—“no, even then he might fail.” And
he sighed. We did not know before
that Sir Joseph was a composer also.
Whilst on his tour of enquiry, the
representative of the Press was authori-
tatively informed that there was no
truth in the rumour that APPENRoDT was
only an alias of the GERMAN EMPEROR.
An incident which might have been
attended by alarming results took place
in the Imperial establishment a few
days ago (writes our Berlin Corres-
pondent). A gentleman entered and
sat at a table. The waitresses were
gathered together by the coffee-urn
busily putting each other's brooches
straight. After waiting ten or fifteen
minutes, the customer rang the bell on
his table, whereupon a young waitress,
who had only recently joined the staff,
approached him slowly. She stood by
his table looking at the reflection of
herself in a mirror. “A small cup of
coffee and some biscuits, please,” said
the customer. Without a word she
her colleagues with some playful re-
mark, and presently came back to the
customer to fling before him half a
pork pie and a glass of ginger beer.
"No, my child,” he said kindly, “I
want coffee and biscuits.” “Then
why couldn't you say so?” asked the
waitress crossly. At this juncture a
young cavalry officer sitting at another
table, who had with difficulty re-
strained his feelings during the incident,
sprang to his feet, drew his sword, and
would have felled the unhappy at-
tendant to the linoleum. But the
neglected customer rose and with an
imperious gesture stayed him. “Sheath
your sword, my gallant one,” he said;
“you mean well, but we must not have
bloodshed here. This is a respectable
establishment. Do you hear, Sir? Put

PRE-NATAL INFLUENCE.
THE publicity given by The Daily
Erpress to the life-history of EUGEN-
ETTE, the super-baby of Hampstead,
whose parents prepared for her arrival
by undergoing a careful course of mental
and spiritual exercise, has brought us
a host of letters from correspondents
who give the results of their own
essays in this branch of Eugenics. We
select a few of the most interesting
cases that have been brought under
our notice:—
Burble Cottage, Bilgewater.
SIR,-Before our darling Egregia
was born my wife and I made a
complete study of the works of Mr.
HALL CAINE. The result is that now,
at the age of eleven months, Egregia has
begun to express her thoughts with
fluency and distinction, while her sense
of morality is wonderfully developed.
Her favourite plaything is a pen, and,
while displaying a healthy contempt
for teddy-bears and dolls, she invariably
refuses to go to bed unless accompanied
by the bust of SHAKSPEARE, which
during the daytime reposes on the
principal bookcase. I may mention
that she has converted the library into
her nursery, and it is a significant
fact that on entering that apartment
yesterday I found her absorbed in
The Woman Thou Gavest Me, over
parts of which she was busily engaged
in pouring the contents of the inkpot.
Yours faithfully,
THEoPHRASTU's KNIBBs.
The Acorns, Flowery Way,
Crankley Garden Suburb.
DEAR SIR,-Believing as I do that
the perfect life is only attainable by a
strict adherence to vegetarian principles,
I spent the months preceding my son's
birth in daily communion with the
products of Mr. EUSTAcE MILEs, Mr.
G. B. SHAw, and other leaders of the
same school of thought. Carrots (as
we call him, though his baptismal
name is Bernard) is now seven months
old, and whenever he has been put to
the test he has refused meat in the
most uncompromising fashion. He is
a strong, healthy lad, and takes an
unaffected delight in the physical and
breathing exercises which he is set to
perform every morning. Intellectually
he shows the greatest promise, and
from certain expressions, as yet in-
distinct, which I have heard him let
fall, I believe he will develop into an
accomplished linguist. This I attribute
to my own customary diet of French
beans, Brussels sprouts, and Spanish
nuts. Yours sincerely,
365, Contango Terrace,
West Hampstead.
SIR,--I am willing to wager that my
firstborn, Montagu, is the most business-
like baby in the kingdom. His mother
and I took care of that. Before he
arrived she used to come down to my
office every day and go through the
books, and when I mention that I am
a financial agent in the West-end of
London you will appreciate what this
means. Montagu already knows what's
what. I recently gave him some coins
to play with, in order that early in life
he should become familiar with the
value of money. The other day I
handed him a shilling and asked him
to change it for me. He solemnly
counted out eleven pennies and pushed
them towards me; the other penny, of
course, he had kept for himself as
commission. He can already do sums
in simple interest (from sixty per cent.).
I enclose my business card in case you
or any of your friends should wish to
consult me, and remain,
Yours obediently,
EPHRAIM MonTMORENCY.

DEAR SIR,--The wife and I are both
staunch Unionists, and have thrown
ourselves heart and soul into the Anti-
Home Rule movement. A few weeks
after the opening of the present
campaign, during which we attended
scores of meetings, our baby girl, whom
we have named Effie Carsonia, made her
appearance. She is of a fierce fight-
ing disposition, and from the moment
of her birth has never ceased to declaim
day and night. The light that comes
into her eyes when she is shown a
Union Jack is beautiful to see. I regret
to say, however, that she is now suffer-
ing from an ulsterated throat.
Yours faithfully,
PATER AND PATRIOT.
Portland.
SiR,-Unfortunately for myself, I
happened to be born shortly after the
discovery of the great Bank Swindle
of '64. Doubtless my parents, who
took a deep interest in current affairs,
were full of it at the time, and this
explains certain defects in my character
which have always caused me great
pain, and which I have never been
able to eradicate. Perhaps now that
attention has been drawn to this
important subject my case will be
investigated scientifically, and steps
will be taken to have me removed from
my present uncongenial surroundings.
Thanking you in anticipation,

MUSICAL OMENS.
Miss LILIAN GRANFELT, interviewed
by The Pall Mall Gazette on the subject
of her forthcoming appearance in Mr.
RAYMOND Róze's Joan . of Arc, tells
an interesting story of an incident
which befell her in her student days at
Paris:— . t
“One day I was riding on horseback
with some Scandinavian students when
my horse shied and bolted. My hat
flew off, my hair came undone and fell
round me in streams, but still I held
fast and would not let go. The people
who saw me shouted, ‘Bravo, Jeanne
d'Arc l’ and it was, I think, a sort of
sign that I should one day be the creator
tf the Maid of Orleans in this opera.”
Inquiries made of various luminaries
of the musical world show that these
premonitions are of comparatively
frequent occurrence.
Mr. Boldero-Bamborough (né Bam-
berger), the famous Scoto-Semitic
violinist, writes from Boldero Towers
to point out that in his early infancy
the nursery rhyme to which he was
always lulled to sleep by Madame Bam-
berger was “Hi diddle diddle, the cat
and the fiddle.” It should be mentioned
that Mr. Boldero-Bamborough possesses
a very fine Persian cat called Beethoven,
because of its addiction to Moonlight
Sonatas.
M. JEAN DE REszkE, in a recent inter-
view with a Polish journalist, describes
the curious omen which befell him when
attending a public elementary school in
Podolia. “One day,” remarked the
great tenor, “I was playing tipcat
with some of my schoolmates on the
banks of a small lake, when, in the
ardour of the game, I lost my balance,
fell into the water, and being unable
to swim would probably have been
drowned but for the timely assistance of
an old swan, which seized my waist-
band with its bill and brought me to
the shore. The schoolmaster, who had
been summoned by the cries of the boys,
shouted out, “Buck up, Lohengrin l'
and for the rest of my schooldays I
went by the name of the rôle in which
I was subsequently destined to win
some of my most resounding triumphs.”
Madame MELBA is fond of telling a
curious story of her schooldays at the
High School at Mazawattee, which
foreshadowed her success on the lyric
stage. On her arrival at the school with
several other new - comers the head-
mistress asked, “Which of you is Nellie
Mitchell?" and the future prima donna
replied with ungrammatical emphasis,
“Me, me.” As a result she was at once
nicknamed “Mimi,” in accurate antici-
pation of her ultimate identification

LAMENT FOR THE BUTLER.
[It has recently been stated that, owing principally to the increasing
charges on land, the butler is vanishing from the social system.]
ATTEND, ye peers, to this my painful coil;
Ye squires and high manorial lords, attend,
Whom the harsh taxes on your native soil
Compel to stint, and rudely recommend
A stern frugality that sees no end,
While I, with dirges due and measures low,
Deplore your butler, who has got to go.
For he was wonderful. His matchless mien,
So calm, ineffable and full of rest,
Would have done honour to the purest dean.
Unsmiling, at the board the noblest jest
Awoke no echo in that stoic breast;
Nay, frequently 'twas not without a qualm
Of daring that one tipped his ample palm.
And in that rite how well he would compare
With the awed donor. Not for him the spell
Of fluttering coyness, but a wavy air
Of one who, from his loftier height, would quell
All doubts with “Peace upon you, it is well."
Gold only was his metal; that full port
Forbad all coinage of the baser sort.
He was a thing of ornament, a sun
With satellites in his reflected ray;
These worked that he might see that it was done;
Only with pious hands he would convey
The wine from the deep cellar where it lay,
And tend, and serve it with full care, and beam
Forth on the board, immobile and supreme.
A sun. And whence he rose none ever knew.
We think he was not made of common earth;
Surely that classic presence never grew
(Saye to its full convexity of girth);
Fully equipped, he must have sprung at birth
Like Pallas; for in truth 'twould half destroy
His wonders had he been a human boy.
Haply—we may not know—he did but come
From some dim far isle in mysterious seas
Where dwell the favoured race of butlerdom,
And little baby butlers bloom at ease,
Austere, grey-whiskered, with small cellar-keys;
Till in a faery bark they seek the shore
Of gilded Mammon and return no more.
But times wax hard. And he, the stay and prop
Of many a proud demesne, must disappear.
His lord will mourn him; guests who come to stop
Will to his memory drop a kindly tear.
Pert maids, of undeniably trim cheer,
Will ply his gentle task and save expense,
Yet never reach his storied eminence.
Then, butler, pass; tho' not without regret,
Thy nest, no doubt, is feathered, and I see
Those chambers in the West, which thou wilt let,
And prosper, and from every care be free
Save one, which may be safely left to me:
Thou shalt not be forgotten, for all time
Being made famous by this deathless rhyme.
DUM-DUM.

SPARING OUR FEELINGS.
The recent softening action of Sir JAMES BARRIE has
led to still more developments of the new “Drama with-
out Fears." A new Act is to be added to the enormously
successful drama Sealed Orders, in which it will be
explained that all the horrid happenings of battle and
bloodshed, airships and assassination, are in reality but the
disordered imaginings of the (supposed) burglar who drinks
the drugged wine (not poisoned) in Act I. What actu-
ally took place was that a party of high-spirited young
people had arranged a mock burglary, with no felonious
intent whatever, through the roof. One of them, overcome
by huskiness, drinks the wine that has been treated with
a soporific but quite innocuous powder, and dreams the
rest of the play. It is to be hoped that the new Act,
which shows him wakening none the worse, and the
restoration of the dismissed clerk, will go far to dissipate
any doubts that might have been formed concerning the
perfect niceness of everybody concerned.
Actuated by a kindly anxiety lest the feelings of the
audience should be unduly harrowed by the spectacle of a
too-realistic lion, the management of the St. James's Theatre
have now made arrangements by which the beast shall
appear before the curtain and address the spectators, saying
that he is no such thing, but a man as other men are, and ||
indeed telling them plainly that he is Mr. SILLwARD, the
actor. It is reported that Mr. BERNARD SHAw has been
induced to take this suggestion from a fellow dramatist

perfunctory and respectable. The Mar-
quis, who was justified in expecting
something a little more troublant, didn't
attempt to conceal his boredom, but
just walked through the dance, keeping
up a continuous flow of conversation.
Mr. HARRY IRVING was con-
tent to play his villainy in a low
key, and made no very strong
bid for unpopularity. He acted
with an easy skill worthy of

Disgusted Sportsman. “MissED AGAIN |
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE long suspected that there are two Miss MARY
CHOLMONDELEYs, and the publication of her new novel,
Notwithstanding (MURRAY), confirms my suspicion. One
Miss CholMondELEY is an entirely delightful person. She
rejoices in country scenes—some village with its parson, its
old maids, its rectory and its rooks, its school and green, its
manor house with the squire, and its inn with the gossips.
Such scenes she describes supremely well, and I enjoy im-
mensely her own enjoyment in the doing of it. There is
in her new novel a chapter that contains the very best
description of a village choir-practice that I have ever read,
and indeed all the homely humorous scenes in Notwith-
standing are pictures of quiet English life that neither Miss
MITFoRD nor Mrs. GASKELL have excelled. But, alas, there
is also the other Miss CholMondeley. This is the lady
who gave us the melodrama of Red Pottage and of Prisoners.
In those books she had herself to some extent under control,
but in Notwithstanding she revels gloriously. Her story
depends upon at least a dozen most elaborate coincidences;
upon conversations either just overheard or just missed;
upon four characters who are either paralytic or insane;
upon a wicked nurse who marries the idiot son in order to
obtain the property; upon a will which is lost and found
with a quite bewildering iteration; and finally upon the
most convenient fire in all fiction—a fire that burns, with
I CAN'T HIT A THING.

I'LL HAve To GIVE IT UP!”
Why is Miss CHOLMONDELEY so determined upon a manu-
factured and incredible plot? No one wishes for melo-
drama when so many real and convincing delights are
offered. I beg of her to dismiss once and for ever her
Surrey-side collaborator.
It was happily inevitable that Mr. G. F. BRADBy (whose
Dick contained one of the most delightful studies of boyhood
in modern fiction) should sooner or later write an exclusively
school story. The Lanchester Tradition (SMITH, ELDER) is
however unexpected in that its protagonists are not school-
boys but schoolmasters. I must say that the relative
novelty of this is welcome; and it may at once be added
that it proves Mr. BRADBY well qualified to deal shrewdly
with his own kind. One feels on every page that the book
is the work of one who knows thoroughly what he is writing
about—not to say one who has taken an unholy and impish
joy in a good deal of it. Certainly the peculiar atmosphere
of a public school community, that strange blend of idealism
and pettiness, courage and futility, could not have been
conveyed with more truth than in this story of the new head-
master of Chiltern and his difficulties. Many of the
characters are clearly portraits, though, I suspect, composite
ones; they are certainly all very much alive, from
Mr. Flaggon, the head, down to Tipham, whom he imports
as the latest product of Cambridge culture—with results
somewhat devastating to the senior staff. Mr. BRADBY,
has a gift of phrase that I have admired before (there is, for
great precision, the exact corner of the will that the hero example, a definition of English oratory that is alone worth
and heroine desire it to burn. How hopelessly are the quiet the sum charged for the book) and an ironic humour none

book that, though its chief appeal will be to the specialist,
provides the general public with a sufficiently entertaining
story, and some valuable instruction. The expert will read
it with emotion—of various kinds.
I believe that the worth of a novel could be at once dis-
covered from a glance at the handwriting in which it was
originally composed. I do not, however, anticipate that the
publishers, even for the purpose of testing my theory, will
take to reproducing authors' works in facsimile, for what is
most readable in print would probably prove least legible in
manuscript. Mr. A. Scott CRAVEN writes, I suspect, in a
diminutive and scholarly hand, giving a pleasing effect from
a distance but proving undecipherable on closer inspection.
Further, his written page must, I think, be noticeably
darkened with frequent erasures, many a word having been
altered many a time. There is that in The Fool's Tragedy
(SECKER) which makes me wish that he had dictated it to
an impatient and bullying stenographer, insistent on speed,
regardless of diction and intolerant of any later revision; in
which case a meticulous sense of style would not have been
allowed to interfere with the flow of a ready inspiration.
He has a fine type of fool,

affair between his daughter and the ratheringenuous young
man who has been chosen to chronicle his life, my enthu-

shadowing memory of the dead man. This is perhaps what
the authoress intended, and yet I cannot help feeling that
a dead sinner, even though he is expiating his evilness in
another world, does not make a wholly satisfactory character
for romance. As with all books that I have read written
by Roman Catholics the trail of the tract is everywhere
clear in this one; but in fairness it must be added that, like
nearly all novels that are the work of Roman Catholics, it
is written exceedingly well.
It is an odd paradox that stories about real persons and
events should always be harder to believe than those that
are entirely imaginary. But the fact remains, and I was
conscious of it just now when reading The Rescue of Martha
(EIUTCHINsoN). Everybody knows what good rousing
romances Mr. F. FRANKFoRT MooRE can make up out of
his own head. Here, however, he has gone to actual
the brilliant thinker, the
restless, sparkling theorist
detached from and incapa-
tions, and the tragedy is
developed in the most
politely known as “reduced.”
The situation is acutely felt
and acutely impressed, and
real. All that is wanting
to make the book great is
the spontaneity which I
feel has been suppressed.

happenings; the theme of
the book is a reconstitution
and an explanation of the
shooting of MARTHA REAY
by JAMEs HACRMAN. It is
a sufficiently sordid story;
and the reader, who will
rejoice to find Mr. MooRE
again in that eighteenth-
century period that he knows
and handles so well, may be
excused for wishing that he
had chosen a more fragrant
episode. Of its three chief

I could forgive as an amia-
ble diversion, but it is a more serious flaw that the
dialogue should be stilted. One conversation, as a result
of which the chief speaker incurred suspicion of practical
immorality, was so much edited that it was rendered and
still remains (to me, at any rate) meaningless.
Mr. Blake of The Bab Ballads was, as no doubt you
| remember, a regular out-and-out hardened sinner, and
“quite indifferent as to the particular kinds of dresses
| That the clergyman wore at the church where he used to go to pray.”
His latitudinarianism, however, obtained a measure of
| toleration from his biographer which is not extended to
| Horace Blake (HUTCHINson) by Mrs. WILFRID WARD.
That gentleman, a dramatist of unsurpassed genius, but a
| militant atheist and by all standards a thorough bad lot, is
introduced to us when under sentence of death from an
incurable disease, and at the zenith of his career as an
iconoclastic but popular playwright. Leaving at home his
wife, who worships his intellect though she understands his
character, he goes to St. Jean des Pluies in Brittany with
his daughter in order to take what must be his last holiday,
and falls under the spell of the religion which had been his
in childhood, so that he dies shriven and in the arms of the
Church of Rome. He had previously given orders that the
last act of his cleverest and most provocative play should
protector—there is none for
whom very much sympathy can be claimed. I am not sure
that I didn't find my lord the best of the trio—he was at
least free from cant. Still, such as it is, the story is told
with an engaging bustle; and the eighteenth-century atmo-
sphere is excellently preserved. The scenes move before one
like a series of contemporary prints—more delicate in treat-
ment than in subject. But, after all, this is only another
way of praising Mr. MooRE's mastery of his medium, a
task happily superfluous. So I will let it go at that.
“‘Mr. Claude Grahame-White is now making a flight with a pas-
senger,” shouted the megaphone man as ‘Claudie' banked gaily over-

HOW CAN THEY AT THE PRICE 3
HAve you tried the shilling table d'hôte luncheons 2
I only discovered them last week. And ever since I have
been wondering whether it's some kind of philanthropic
institution or a business move.
This morning I treated my friend Grumpson to a shillings-
worth, and I believe he has come very near to solving the
problem for me.
I will briefly describe the lunch and its effect on Grumpson.
Picture him sitting there contentedly after demolishing the
first course. I watch him furtively, and marvel at the
cheapness of it all. I know Grumpson of old. He is an
epicure of the first water. Nothing but the best satisfies
him. I myself have not quite sunk to the inclusion of
appreciate good cooking and edible food. The management
is most considerate, and refrains from blazoning the absurd
price of this feast upon its menu cards. I do nothing to
defeat this tactful reticence, for I think that a knowledge
of the facts might tend to mar Grumpson's enjoyment.
Besides, he is rather fond of twitting me about what he
politely terms my excessive economy. -
I sit, as I said, furtively watching him, wondering the
while how on earth they can do it at the price. Mind you,
this is an anxious time for me. The whole adventure is
an experiment on my part, for I owe Grumpson a luncheon,
and a restaurant of this kind may be rather a handy thing
to have up one's sleeve for these occasions. Yet apparently
I need have no fear. The fish proves just as excellent as the
hors d'oeuvre, and the entrée is simply delicious. Grumpson
usually talks through an indifferent meal, treating the act
of mastication as a mere bodily necessity. Now lie says
nothing, but his facial mirror reflects the satisfaction
within. - -
The service, again, is nothing short of perfection. Our
waiter is the essence of competence, and though the
place is full we suffer no inconvenient delay between the
courses. We arrive at the cheese and biscuits after a sweet
that I know happens to be one of Grumpson's particular
weaknesses. He attacks his Stilton with undiminished gusto.
Finally coffee is served—of so fine a quality that the aroma
of it might well cause the mouth of a Sultan to water.
It really is a wonderful meal. *-
Carelessly, yet with a note of triumph in my voice, I |
remark: “Well, what do you think of it, Grumpson?” He
drains his cup and beams upon me. “Excellent, old chap! |

SIR,--In an age when the setting aside of convention
and time-honoured British custom is all too popular (due,
in my opinion, in great measure to the present so-called
Government), it has been delightful to read of the incidents
attending the wedding of Prince and Princess Arthur of
Connaught last week. I was so glad to see in the pictures
that (all unknown to the happy pair, I am given to under-

should be. It has given equal pleasure to read that both

THE PREVENTION OF CRIME.
The Holophole, Sidcup.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Convinced by
long experience that prevention is
always better than cure, I venture to
lay before you the following simple but
absolutely efficacious scheme for check-
ing the manufacture of criminals.
It is based on the evidence invariably
given by the police as to the articles
found on offenders when being searched
after their arrest.
These articles are always as under—
(1) A silver English half-hunter
with Albert.
(2) Two pawntickets.
(3) 4}d. in bronze.
The fact that these articles are
always discovered in the pockets of
law-breakers points irresistibly to the
conclusion that they exercise a malign
influence on the possessor. Eliminate
them and you will eliminate crime.
I accordingly suggest that a short
Bill be introduced into Parliament
rendering it a penal offence for any
jeweller to sell a silver English half-
hunter together with an Albert. A gun-
metal watch with a gold chain, if you
like, or a half-hunter with a leather
strap, or any other combination of
metals and design than the one pro-
scribed.
Secondly, the Bill should forbid
pawnbrokers ever to issue two tickets
to the same client—one or three or
Mabel (reciting hymn at bed-time). “

LET MY FRIENDS BE ALL FORGIVEN ;
BLEss THE SINs I LovE so well.”
Thirdly, it should either suppress the
bronze penny and halfpenny, or substi-
tute some other amalgam or metal.
If Mr. LLoyd GEORGE had only
arranged to give ninepence for four-
pence-halfpenny, instead of fourpence,
this clause might have been unneces-
sary, but as matters stand it is in-
dispensable to the efficacy of the Bill.
I have other schemes for the amelio-
ration of humanity which I hope to lay
before you on a future occasion. For
the moment I confine myself to the
suggestion outlined above, and am

HOW TO APPEASE ULSTER.
SIR,-May I, through you, bring
before your Radical contemporaries of
the daily and weekly press a perfectly
infallible method of making Ulster and
Ulstermen happy and reconciling them
to Home Rule 2 -
I have noticed that no true Ulster-
man has the least objection to being
called a traitor, a bigot, a sedition-
monger, a potential rebel, or anything
of that kind. Indeed, he seems to revel
in it. But if you laugh at him or ridi-
cule his plans, his armies or his leaders
he becomes purple and all but inarticu-
late with passion, and any attempt at
argument is thenceforth wasted on him.
That being so—your-
must have noticed it
we believe him to be a good rider and
the possessor of a venomous tongue.
He is an iron embodiment of unalter-
able devotion to principle, and, when
fighting begins, he is sure to be found
wherever the bullets are thickest. The
presence of such a leader in the field is
worth 10,000 men.
“Yesterday there was another review
of militant traitors before KING CARSON.
It is said that there were 12,000 men
(including Mr. F. E. SMITH) on parade.
This is obviously an understatement
put forth with the view of lulling the
Government of the country into a false
security. Our own information is that
as many as 50,000 men in the flower
of strength and manhood marched past
THE VILE CORPUS.
[A provincial schoolmistress recently applied
for the loan of a baby from the local work-
house for several hours weekly to enable her
to give practical lessons in the washing and
dressing of infants. It is to be hoped, how-
ever, that there will not be a repetition of the
grim tragedy described in the following lines.]
HE was only a workhouse baby,
A poor little creature, left
In a railway cloak-room, or, may be,
From natural causes bereft;
But his fame shall for ever be written
In letters of purest gold,
For he lived and died like a Briton,
And thus is his story told:—
On Monday to school he was taken
And
shamelessly stripped of his
clothes—
An insult designed to
yourself—I suggest
that Radicals should
change their tactics.
In future, when Sir
EDwARD CARson, with
F. E. SMITH in attend-
ance, reviews his forces,
instead of belittling the
attitude of the leader
and depreciating the
character and number
of the army, they should
write of them after this
fashion:—
“These men are trai-
tors of the very worst

it is too late. Their plain duty is to

leaders of this dreadful movement.
Otherwise we see no alternative except
a prompt submission to traitors who
are prepared to drench the land with
blood.”

I have seen the scutcheonless knight oppose Sir Brian
To the sound of an old tin tea-tray beaten “off”;
I have seen the charger that carried Richard the Lion;
I have marked the trough
That stared between every rib-I could almost hear him

Of tavern beds, I wis, on his homeward way.

Hands off! or I fling myself down on the courtyard

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“UNDER ENTIRELY NEW
MANAGEMENT.”
I KNow a fool of a dog who pretends
that he is a Cocker Spaniel, and is
convinced that the world revolves
round him wonderingly. The sun rises
so it may shine on his glossy morning
coat; it sets so his master may know
that it is time for the evening biscuit;
if the rain falls it is that a fool of a dog
may wipe on his mistress's skirt his
muddy boots. His day is always
exciting, always full of the same good
things; his night a repetition of his
day, more gloriously developed. If
there be a sacred moment before the
dawn when he lies awake and ponders
on life, he tells himself confidently that
it will go on for ever like this—a life
planned nobly for himself, but one in
which the master and mistress whom
he protects must always find a place.
And I think perhaps he would want a
place for me too in that life, who am
not his real master but yet one of the
house. I hope he would.
What Chum doesn't know is this:
his master and mistress are leaving
him. They are going to a part of the
world where a fool of a dog with no
manners is a nuisance. If Chum could
see all the good little London dogs,
who at home sit languidly on their
mistress's lap, and abroad take their
view of life through a muff much bigger
than themselves; if he could see the
big obedient dogs, who walk solemnly
through the Park carrying their
master's stick, never pausing in their
impressive march unless it be to
plunge into the Serpentine and rescue
a drowning child, he would know what
I mean. He would admit that a dog
who cannot answer to his own name
and pays but little more attention to
“Down, idiot,” and “Come here, fool,”
is not every place's dog. He would
admit it, if he had time. But before I
could have called his attention to half
the good dogs I had marked out he
would have sat down beaming in front
of a motor-car . . . and then he would
never have known what now he will
know so soon—that his master and
mistress are leaving him.
It has been my business to find a
new home for him. It is harder than
you think. I can make him sound
lovable, but I cannot make him sound
good. Of course I might leave out his
doubtful qualities, and describe him
merely as beautiful and affectionate;
I might . . . . but I couldn't. I think
Chum's habitual smile would get larger,
he would wriggle the end of himself
more ecstatically than ever if he heard
himself summed up as beautiful and
it, for I get carried away when I
speak of him and I reveal all his bad
qualities.
“I am afraid he is a snob,” I con-
fessed to one woman of whom I had
hopes. “He doesn't much care for
what he calls the lower classes.”
“Oh 2 ” she said.
“Yes, he hates badly dressed people.
Corduroy trousers tied up at the knee
always excite him. I don't know if
any of your family—no, I suppose not.
But if he ever sees a man with his
trousers tied up at the knee he goes
for him. And he can't bear trades-
people; at least not the men. Washer-
women he loves. He rather likes the
washing-basket too. Once, when he
was left alone with it for a moment,
he appeared shortly afterwards on the
lawn with a pair of well, I mean
he had no business with them at all.
We got them away after a bit of a
chase, and then they had to go to the
wash again. It seemed rather a pity
when they'd only just come back. Of
course, I smacked his head for him;
but he looks so surprised and reproach-
ful when he's done wrong that you
never feel it's quite his fault.”
“I doubt if I shall be able to take
him after all,” she said. “I’ve just
remembered * >
I forget what it was she remembered,
but it meant that I was still without
a new house for Chum. -
“What does he eat?” somebody else
asked me. It seemed hopeful; I could
see Chum already installed.
“Officially,” I said, “he lives on
puppy biscuits; he also has the toast-
crusts after breakfast and an occasional
bone. Privately, he is fond of bees.
I have seen him eat as many as six
bees in an afternoon. Sometimes he
wanders down to the kitchen-garden
and picks the gooseberries; he likes
all fruit, but gooseberries are the
things he can reach best. When
there aren't any gooseberries about,
he has to be content with the hips
and haws from the rose-trees. But
really you needn't bother, he can eat
anything. The only thing he doesn't
like is whitening. We were just going
to mark the lawn one day, and while
we were busy pegging it out he
wandered up and drank the whitening
out of the marker. It is practically the
only disappointment he has ever had.
He looked at us, and you could see that
his opinion of us had gone down.
‘What did you put it there for, if you
didn't mean me to drink it 2 " he said
reproachfully. Then he turned and
walked slowly and thoughtfully back to
his kennel. He never came out till
next morning.” -
shall have to think about it.
you know.”
Of course I knew what that meant.
With a third dog-lover to whom I
spoke the negotiations came to grief,
not apparently because of any faults
of Chum's, but because, if you will
believe it, of my own shortcomings.
At least I can suppose nothing else.
For this man had been enthusiastic
about him. He had revelled in the tale
of Chum's wickedness; he had adored
him for being so conceited. He had
practically said that he would take him.
“Do,” I begged. “I’m sure he'd
be happy with you. You see, he's not
everybody's dog; I mean, I don't want
any odd man whom I don't know to
take him. It must be a friend of mine,
so that I shall often be able to see
Chum afterwards.” -
“So that—what?” he asked anxiously.
“So that I shall often be able to see
Chum afterwards. Week-ends, you
know, and so on. I couldn't bear to
lose the silly old ass altogether.”
He looked thoughtful; and, when I
went on to speak about Chum's fond-
ness for chickens, and his other lovable
ways, he changed the subject alto-
gether. He wrote afterwards that he
was sorry he couldn't manage with a
third dog. And I like to think he was
not afraid of Chum—but only of me.
But I have found the right man at
last. A day will come soon when I shall
take Chum from his present home to
his new one. That will be a great day
for him. I can see him in the train,
wiping his boots effusively on every new
passenger, wriggling under the seat and
out again from sheer joy of life; I
can see him in the taxi, taking his one
brief impression of a world that means
nothing to him; I can see him in
another train, joyous, eager, putting
his paws on my collar from time to
time and saying excitedly, “What a
day this is : " And if he survives the
journey; if I can keep him on the way

to try; if I can get him safely to his

dirty, always smiling, always in the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
“LABBY.”
By Toby, M.P.
IN writing the Life of his uncle,
HENRY LABoucherE, Mr. ALGAR
THoRold enjoyed the advantage of
having for his subject one of the most
interesting men of the nineteenth cen-
tury. He has lived up to rare oppor-
tunity. The portly volume presents a
vivid portrait of the man and an en-
lightening record of his work. In dis-
criminating study of the character and
genius of his old chief, Mr. BENNETT,
who in succession keeps the sacred
lamp of Truth burning in Cartaret
Street, arrives at the conclusion that
“the best work of LABoucherE's
life was done as a journalist.” That
life was so varied in its course, so
starred by conspicuous success in
divers walks, that it is difficult to
decide wherein it reached its highest
excellence. A scholar at Eton, a
student at Cambridge, a gambler, a
roué contemplating avoidance of
starvation by accepting a proffered
place as croupier at a Monte bank in
Mexico; doorkeeper in a circus; pro-
moted to a line in the bill in the
character of “The Bounding Buck of
Babylon,” wearing pink tights with a
filet round his head, extorting admira-
tion by the springiness of his standing
jumps; companion of Chippeway In-
dians hunting buffalo; attaché at several
Embassies in both hemispheres; editor,
newspaper proprietor, lessee of a
theatre, friend of Bismarck, Member
of the House of Commons, on conversa-
tional terms with PADDY GREEN in the
palmy days of Evans's, later admitted
to the intimacy of Mr. GLADstone—
here is a career more nearly recalling
chapters of Monte Cristothan the annals
of a rate-paying resident in Old Palace
Yard, Westminster.
The universality of LABouchere's
character was testified to by the range
of his correspondents. The bursting
over political parties of the thunder-
bolt of Home Rule, directed by the hand
of Mr. GLADstone in 1886, created pro-
found, in many places irreparable, rents
in ancient friendships. Absolutely
devoid of feeling of resentment (save
in one case) “LABBy "preserved all his
old intimacies. Not the least interest-
ing chapters of a book of high historical
value are those devoted to reproduction
of his correspondence in 1885–6. He
was a sort of friendly, convenient,
pillar-box into which men taking a
hand in a critical game of politics
dropped their missives. A strange
conglomeration it was. Amongst the
contributors were Lord Rose BERy,

would have refrained from joining the

On the Saturday night preceding
GLADSTONE's speech winding up debate
on the Second Reading, “LABBY,” a
little fatigued by his patriotic efforts,
withdrew for a brief period of well-
earned rest, comforted by assurance
that Monday night would see his labours
crowned with success. When Monday
came Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, CAINE and
others in the secret, sat expectant whilst
GLADSTONE spoke, waiting for the words
that would re-establish unity. For
reasons never understood, certainly
never publicly explained, they were not
contributed to the end brought about
by the General Election of 1892. The
spoils to the victor. It was antici-
pated, by none more surely than by
LABouchERE, that he would receive at
Mr. GLADSTONE's hands Cabinet office.
For personal reasons in high quarters,
about which “LABBY's" own testimony,
cited by Mr. ThoroLD, leaves no doubt,
his claims were overlooked. Another

incentive to this new departure was the
| bitterness of his resentment against his
| old friend and companion dear, now a
pillar of strength in a Cabinet presided
over by Lord SALISBURY. As a rule, he
had no personal resentments. Sublimely
imperturbable, he lived in a serene
atmosphere undisturbed by what any-
body said, did, or thought about his
actions or his motives. He made up
for this indifference by concentrated
hostility to the statesman he in 1886
was accustomed to address as “My
dear Chamberlain,” whom he now
invariably alluded to as “Joe,” import-
ing into the monosyllable an indescrib-
able note of half-amused scorn and
reprobation. Since Mr. CHAMBERLAIN
was a member of the Conservative
Government the more urgent was the
call to wreck it.
No one more effectively than “the

had in fullest possession the qualities
that would have made him a dangerous
enemy on the flanks of the Leaders of
the Liberal Party in the House of

his way. Towards the end of a
long life's labour he was growing
tired. His indomitable spirit was a
little soured by repeated disappoint-
ments. But he was faithful to the end,
voting steadily with his Party and,
when necessary, coming to their help
with still sparkling speech.
Unexpectedly abandoning his throne
in the Smoking-Room of the Reform
Club, round which would gather a rapt
circle of listeners, quitting his cherished
companionship with the House of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[October 22, 1913.
ONE TOUCH OF NATURE.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-As to the clerks
of the Inland Revenue, or whatever it
may be, with whom all of us have
been in correspondence at one time or
another, they are not what they are
supposed to be. You know the sort of
correspondence I mean: the righteously
indignant on the one side and the
coldly pedantic on the other—the sort
of letter-writing in which you score
all the points at first but the clerk gets
his postal order in the end. It is not
generally known that these clerks are
by nature men and not machines, and
it will be scarcely believed that they,
ruthlessly oppressive as they are in
their demands, have their off-moments
when they are positively human. Such
has been my recent discovery.
The controversy, a lengthy one, con-
cerned itself with the matter of a dog that
had everything a dog could want except
a licence. I will not trouble you with
the details, since you had a dog-licence
case in your pages a little while ago
and may be tired of the subject, but
will admit to you at once, what I ad-
mitted to the clerk bit by bit, that the
law was undoubtedly on his side, and
I was prepared to obey it eventually,
when I had had my fill of heated
dialectics. You will readily believe
that I got the best of all the repartee
from start to finish, and that I thought
of some unanswerable arguments for
the abolition of clerks in general and
Revenue clerks in particular; in short,
that I succeeded, as all of us do succeed,
in making the fellow sit up before I
climbed down. So long as the battle
was waged in his territory I won all
the way (except as to the booty), but
when he came out of his defences
and took me on in my own country
| he showed an entirely unsuspected
humanity which, I must confess, de-
feated me utterly.
My country is Edgbaston, where I,
together with many others whose work
lies in Birmingham, live. If we spend
the most of our day in that city we
prefer in our late evenings and early
mornings to forget its existence; what-
ever we may be when at work, in our
leisure we are of Edgbaston and by no
means of Brummagem. Yet that clerk
would persist in addressing me at
| “Edgbaston, Birmingham.” Having
suffered several envelopes so addressed
there came a time when I could bear it
no longer, and I demanded that the
offence should be withdrawn, failing
which I should instruct my solicitors to
| take proceedings. To describe Edgbas-
| ton as Birmingham, as I pointed out,
| was a cruel and calculated lie. He
the 10th inst, and your observations re
Edgbaston noted,” and addressed that
envelope to “Edgbaston, near Birming-
ham.” Though I resented the “near"
almost as much as the original sin he
refused to budge from his attitude, and
up to the very end so addressed me.
When the correspondence was draw-
ing to a close and the time had come
to pay I enclosed my cheque, and in a
covering letter spoke more frankly to
that clerk than he or any colleague of
his had ever, I am sure, been spoken to
before. Which done, I commanded him
to send me merely a formal receipt for
the money and never to address a word
to me again. In due course the receipt
arrived, accompanied by no letter in
reply to mine, and the envelope it came
in was addressed, “Horatius John-
son, Esq., “The Pines,' Edgbaston, very
near Birmingham.”
Following a lengthy period of frigid
politeness, that one touch of red-hot
temper, Sir, wrought such a change in
my feelings to the man that I wrote
forthwith, begging permission to call on
him when next I came to London, and
asking him meanwhile to accept as a
small present from an admiring friend
the dog in dispute, which I was for-
warding under separate cover.
- Yours faithfully,
H. Johnsox.
A BRILLIANT PHANTASY.
IT often happens that I am asked out
for the evening—music or what not—
and accept “with pleasure,” because it
is so much easier than refusing. Very
well then. : When the day comes, I
wish I hadn't. I arrive home to dinner
on the night and feel I don't want to
turn out at all. By the time dinner is
over I am really angry. I leave the
house in a bad temper; reach the house
of my hosts in that condition, and pass
a thoroughly enjoyable evening. . .
This has occurred not once, not twice,
but several times.
Last Monday I made a casual arrange-
ment to drop in at the Penby's on Wed-
nesday after dimner.
On the morning Iarose with a weight
on my mind.
“What is it?” I thought.
With the cold bath, my brain cleared,
and I remembered; we had to go to
the Penbys.
“Dash!” I said.
The rest of the day calls for no com-
ment. It passed. - - - - - -
On my way home I suddenly had an
idea. Once at the Penbys I should
probably enjoy myself. It was the fact
of having to go that was worrying me.
So I reasoned with myself. - -
“What we must do,” I said, “is to
imagine we're not going out. After
dinner we sit quietly by the fire. Then
I suddenly decide to take a stroll. You
join me, and we happen to pass the
Penby's. ‘Let us turn in here,' I say;
and there we are.”
Edith looked at me compassionately.
“If it amuses you, I don't mind,” she
said; “but in the first place the draw-
ing-room fire isn't being kept in, and
in the second place I'm not doing any
strolling; I've ordered a taxi.”
That, as I explained, was mere
quibbling. As long as we maintained
the right spirit all would be well.
As a matter of fact, Edith made
things very difficult for me. She gave
the maids audible instructions not to
wait up for us, and enquired twice
about the latchkey.
I set my teeth and acted magnifi
cently. -
When the taxi drove up I was
reading.
“Hello! what's this 2 " I exclaimed.
“A taxi ride 2"
“Don't be silly,” said Edith;
you got the key?"
Half-way down the drive I sat up
quickly.
“By George,” I said, “why not call
on the Penbys? They're often asking
us to drop in.”
I seized the speaking - tube and
whispered the address to the driver.
He nodded rather brusquely.
As we drove up to the house I sur-
passed myself. “I wonder if they'll
be in,” I said.
Curiously enough they were not.
Somehow I had misunderstood Penby;
the invitation was for quite a different
evening.

A SPAS M OF GRATITUDE.
HE was reading the paper while
crossing Fleet Street. He had got to
a paragraph about the Lion Sermon,
which had been preached on the pre-
vious day in a City church in memory
of a 17th century Lord Mayor who
was saved from a lion in the Arabian
desert. There was a hoarse shout, a
hand grabbed him and dragged him
back, a motor-bus thundered by, and a
policeman said, “Another inch, Sir,
and you'd have been under it.” “Near
go,” said a postman. After similar
remarks from the crowd, he began to
realise that he had narrowly escaped a
nasty death.
He walked very solemnly along tho
pavement near to the wall. “I will,”
he said—“I will institute a Motor-bus
Sermon.” It seemed to be the least he
could do.
It did cecur to him a little later that
sermons are not so popular nowadays
as they used to be; and it was while
waiting for his train that the idea of
an organ recital instead occurred to
him. It would be the more suitable
because he, the founder, was fond of
music. Yes, it should be a musical
to remember, of course, that organ
recitals appeal to rather a restricted
class; that point required consideration.
By the time the train reached St.
James's Park he was beginning to
feel that a combination of a kind of
Morality play with good music would
be just the thing.
Such a play might be more expensive,
perhaps, than an organ recital; he
would not like to begin any memorial
that would be too costly to continue.
He must remember that he was not
really wealthy. Another idea that
came to hirn, after leaving Earl's Court,
was that a refined literary-musical
recital, by a really capable performer,
would present less difficulties.
Anything he decided upon must
necessarily cost money. He did not
mind that so very much ; but there
would be legal formalities to be ob-
served, so that the thing should be on
a proper footing, and every year there
would be the difficulty of choosing the
right person to do whatever thing he
decided upon (if he should decide) to
mark his gratitude.

squarely and without sentimentality,

leaving the station when he hesitated.
He had been thinking of music; an
idea struck him. He had nothing

knew his wife had no engagement. He
stepped lightly into a telephone call-box.

KERR, older than his wont, was very
perfect as Sir Joseph Juttle, but the
part lacked variety and the good things
did not come his way. I make exception
however of one bright thought that
occurred to the Radical Knight. He
stipulated that his contribution to the
party funds should be invested in his
own firm. Miss Lotti E VENNE was his
lady, and I have never seen her in better
form. She played with exceptional re-
straint, steadily refusing to slip into
farce. There was something very hu-
both; you have their son, in a
“crack cavalry regiment,” with a
record of dirty work to his name;
you have a guardsman (Old Eton-
ian) with themanners of a hog; you
have a South American adven-
turer with no morals; a noisy
politician with an eye for the
party funds; and, for the rest, an
unspeakable crew of snobs who
condescend to take the hospi-
tality of the parvenus for the sake
of the chorus girl's society or
anything else they can get. You
will guess that she doesn't need
to be very noble to stand out in
pretty sharp relief against such a
background. -
Indeed, she is almost super-
fluously admirable. For love of
the shady soldier she forces her
way into the heart of his mother
(a dear, vulgar, old soul) by intro-
ducing a few titled undesirables
into her very domestic ménage;
she gets her man into Parliament
against his will; she secures for
from the South American adventurer;
and from the same villain she abstracts
(by threatening him with a bottle of
smelling-salts, which he takes for
vitriol) certain compromising docu-
ments which might have landed her
lover in gaol; and finally she gets per-
mission to marry this hopeless object.
Well might she say to his parents, as
she does with the utmost candour,
“I’m the only live person you've ever
met.”
There was a moment in the play
when it looked as if a red herring was
to be drawn across the trail of the
chorus girl's career. Sir Joseph and
Lady Juttle had arranged to give a
dance for their Queen's Gate circle, and

son's own attitude towards parlia-

loathed the idea of being shot into
what he regarded as a monkey-house,
and did his best to lose the election by
telling his supporters just what he
thought of them. Unfortunately this
only gave him a name for original
candour, which followed him into the
House. Waking up, dazed with the
sleep of boredom, he would often wander
into the wrong Lobby, and thus confirm
his reputation as a free-lance who
would have to be reckoned with. This
was very pleasant fooling, and alto-

rather refreshing, though now and

MRs. HUMPHRY WARD shows in The Coryston Family
(SMITH, ELDER) that she has not lost the art of diverting
us with the intelligent marionettes which she manipulates
so adroitly from the wings of her decorous little stage.
Lady Coryston, having tyrannised her husband into an
earlier grave than was strictly necessary, chiefly because he
had once dared to vote against her convictions, is left to
perfect the disintegrating process upon her family and
dependents. She meets with a fine sporting opposition
from her eccentric first-born, who develops ideas of his own
distinctly out of harmony with the smoother traditions of
his class. The truculent dowager promptly disinherits him,
a proceeding which is condemned as distinctly bad form
in the distinguished circles in which the Coryston family
moves. And when Arthur, her second and favourite, elects
to fall obstinately in love with Enid Glenwilliam, daughter
of the deplorable Chancellor of the Exchequer who had
begun life as a colliery check-weigher, all Lady Coryston's
heavy guns are trained on the impossible position. Enid,
however, an attractive, clever, but, as you would guess, not
quite satisfactory person, routs the ridiculous great woman
—this concession to the forces that are ruining the country
being no doubt made in the interests of an enlightened
impartiality. The fourth member of the family, Marcia, falls
in and out of love with an unusual variety of high church-
and a highly developed ecclesiasticism is cleverly portrayed,
and more convincingly than would at first sight seem
possible. One cannot readily absolve Mrs. WARD of the
charge of writing with some excellent purpose. Could it
in this instance possibly have been to show by the horrid
example of Lady Coryston the terrible condition to which
voteless political women are reduced 2
Everyone knows the strange way in which the characters

increasing quantity, takes any greater pleasure in it than
did his predecessors in their small and comparatively crude
library. These profound reflections have been evoked by
certain beautiful volumes now issued by Messrs. HEINEMANN,
and more immediately by one of them, The Adventures of
Akbar, written by FLORA ANNIE STEEL and illustrated by
BYAM SHAw. I fancy I am right in supposing that King
Akbar has before now served as hero to one of Mrs. STEEL's
Indian stories; here, of course, she tells only of his child-
hood, and tells it in a style modulated to a youthful audience.
So far as a grown-up reviewer can judge, its appeal should
be certain in the quarter to which it is addressed, for
it provides plenty of adventures and escapes; two jolly
animals who again and again preserve their young master;

and Akbar himself invariably comes off victorious over his

enemies. For an added excellence there is a slave boy
named Roy, who is obviously and delightfully destined to
“turn out to be somebody” before the final chapter. All
this has been illustrated by Mr. BYAM SHAw with pictures
of the right Oriental magnificence in crimsons and gold,
just such pictures as the youthful eye (which appreciates
liberality in such matters) will most enjoy. Altogether
this experiment in “STEEL without tears,” if I may call it
so, is a distinct success, and should make a host of new
friends for its author among the Empire-builders of the
future.
News from the Duchy (ARRowsMITH) is very good news,
and appropriately enough I received it in the same week
in which the old charter was restored to Fowey. If I
know my Q, it is not too much to hope that in the near
future we shall hear his version of the proceedings which
have been taking place in “Troy Town.” Novelists
imported from “up along " may invade the Duchy and
persecute it with floods of ink, but however fatigued some
mental and physical, of the vicar of a small village in the
wilds, dead and deadening as such villages are. The Rev-
erend Herbert Binstone had been forced into holy orders by
a masterful mother with the view of succeeding to a family
living. It takes Mr. Court.NEY just two pages to present
the reader with a complete picture of the victim's attitude
towards life during the years of his early manhood. In
one sentence, “He accepted his fate with a certain non-
chalance, varied at times with signs of repugnance and
revolt,” he gives us the equivalent of a dozen chapters of
the ordinary novelist. I seem to see some of our leading
Marathon performers at work on those “signs of repug-
nance and revolt.” To my mind “A Priest in Israel" is
the gem of the collection; but each of the others, from the
story which gives the book its title to the little sketch,
“Herodias' Daughter,” is distinguished by the same
masterly sureness of touch.
Anyone can quote you tags from “Montrose's Love-Song”

how many people know

was not a woman but a

he fought 2 I suspect
that there are one or two
other things about this
reat soldier and most
gallant and loyal gentle-
man that the general
reader has either never
learnt or has forgotten.
For that reason, amongst
others, I commend to

tone and style. “Pipes in Arcady” would screw a smile
out of the morosest of misanthropes, and will remain in
the memory of normal people as a perpetual provocation to
laughter. Taking the volume as a whole I cannot remember
| to have found Q in better form.
There are two ways of writing a short story. The first,
the recognised method of the popular magazines, is to start
with an arresting incident, give the reader a fillip with
another arresting incident at about the half-way mark, and
to dismiss him, content, with yet another incident which
brings the story to a full stop. The second, and more
artistic—though the other method has produced some good
work—is to treat the short story as a novel in little, and
o about your business soberly and without “curtains.”
Mr. W. L. Court.NEY favours the second method in his new
book, The Soul of a Suffragette (CHAPMAN AND HALL). It
is possible that you may find the alliterative title jar upon
you, as I did, but I do not think that you can fail to enjoy
the contents of the book. Mr. CourTNEY's restraint is
admirable. He never takes a hundred pages to say what
he can say in ten; and that seems to be almost a lost art
nowadays. A good instance is to be found in his story, “A
master. His history is right enough, but his way of telling
it gives his book the fascination of a romance. It is a stirring
tale of tremendously plucky fighting, generally against heavy
odds, and always, save once, triumphant. Also it makes you
feel that you understand the man and his contemporaries—
ARGYLL, HUNTLY, and the rest—even without the aid of
the excellent portraits reproduced in the volume. I con-
gratulate Mr. Buchan on the way in which he has made
these men live, even though one of the vilest of them all
happens to be my own ancestor. But most of all I am
grateful to him for his picture of MontRose, in his way,
I suppose, as fine a Scotsman as ever lived.

GAME AND GOLF.
To the Editor of “Punch.”
DEAR SIR,-" Supposing,” says the
CHANCELLoR, “you turned the whole of
a Highland deer forest into a golf
course.” (He got mixed in the next
sentence and talked of people shooting
over it; but that is quite excusable
when you think how an audience gets
into his head.). Now, I should like
him to know that not only did we
convert an uncultivated deer park at
Richmond into a golf course, but we
added features which cannot fail to be
of the greatest moral benefit to our
members. Many of them are so devoted
to duty that they can seldom find time
to go abroad and see an Alp; year
after year they used to miss the unique
spiritual advantages which accrue from
contemplation of nature in its more
sublime and uplifting aspects. So we
provided for this defect by the creation
of mountainous scenery, range upon
range, in the neighbourhood of every
hole. The effect of this has been
appreciably to raise the moral tone and ||
culture of our members.
Yours faithfully, Mid-Surrey.
DEAR SIR,-What is all this talk of
LLOYD GEORGE's about golf as a natural
! attraction for brain-workers from the
Stock Exchange? Is it implied that
no intelligence is required of those who
shoot game? Let me tell this political
bagman that it takes more brains to
pick off a couple of brace out of a covey
of driven partridges, or to get within
shooting distance of a stag (let alone
hitting him), than to push a little rubber
ball into a hole with nobody to stop
you. Yours indignantly,
SportsMAN.
HoNour'D SIR,--I was makin a bit
extry the other day doin a turn of
beatin for Squire, when down the road
comes one of these luksyoorious motor-
cars. As a rule I ain't got much use
for your rich Lunnon folk as comes
messin up the place with their dust
and smell, but this time I sees who it
is, knowing him from his carrykaturs.
I touches my cap to him, bein Mr.
LLoyd GEORGE, who as my interests
at eart. I'd hev given a lot to be
lowed to stop him and arst him a
question or two. Frinstance, what's
this here forestation he talks about 2
Would it be the same as wot Squire
does, takin a bit of useless land and
puttin in a plantation for his birds? Our
Radical Member he says that it can't
be the same, coz anything to do with
pheasants must be wrong. Anyways,
it's difficult for country folk to unner-
stand these things same as the Lunnon
thing or two if I could hev ad an eart
to eart talk with Mr. GEORGE in his
motor. Yours respekful, Hodge.
DEAR SIR,--The CHANCELLOR has
spoken in praise of golf, but has he
realised the drain that it makes upon
the resources of the brain-worker? I
refer to the iniquitous charge for golf-
balls, which still stands at the same
figure—two shillings and sixpence—at
which it stood when rubber was four
or five times its present cost. Ninety-
six millions of golf-balls are purchased
every year, at an expenditure of twelve
million pounds, yielding a profit of
eight to ten million pounds to the
bloated capitalists who manufacture
them. This sum would go far to re-
place the damage done to crops by
pheasants.
Yours, on the verge of ruin,
- A Poor MAN.
P.S.—I have no means of checking
the above figures, which came out of
my head, but I give them for what they
are worth.
SIR,--I once had a job as a market
gardener near a big town. I liked the
pay all right, but the work was on the
heavy side. Well, a syndicate come
along and buys up all the market
gardens and acres and acres of cultivated
land and turns them into a golf course.
I lost my job, but I sees my chance of
chippin in as a caddie. I gets a decent
wage what with tips and that, and me
and my mates has the best part of
every day for lyin about and doin a
bit of gamblin in a sort of a cow-shed.
There ain't many softer jobs goin, and
the life suits me nicely. I wouldn't
change with a brother of mine who's
got a stiff billet as a game-keeper. His
pay's good, and he's got a kind master
and a nice cottage, but he has to do
more work than I should fancy, and no
picture palaces of an evening. And
now that Mr. GEORGE tells me what a
dirty business this game-keepin is,
compared with the noble sport of golf,
I pities my brother from my heart.
Give me my blind-alley, I says, and a
good conscience.
Yours obedient, CASUAL CADDIE.
DEAR SIR,-Has Mr. LLOYD GEORGE,
I wonder, ever heard of the deer forest
owned (or rented) by the Municipality
of Glasgow 2 I don't ask if he has
ever seen it, for he admits that he has
never seen one of these deer forests
that he knows so much about ; but
has he ever heard of it? I have.
I have often stalked in the neighbour-
hood, and many a time I have
shuddered to picture the scenes of
desolation that must have occurred at
sants driven from their happy homes
where they had previously earned an
honest competence by the sale of white
heather; their desolate hearths laid
waste by flame; their sporrans flung to
the winds; the music of their bag-pipes
rendered dumb. But let that pass. It
is for the future prospects of the sturdy
race that I tremble when I think of
the possible realisation of Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE's dream; of “six hundred
thousand” subscribers let loose on
the hill with lethal weapons — not
counting his “eighteen thousand work-
men who would shoot regularly over
the deer forest on payment of half-a-
crown a year.” The carnage would be
awful. Ulster would be nothing to it.
I speak of human lives, not of stags.
Indeed, my only solace is the thought
that these serried battalions of sports-
men would be certain to push the
astonished deer across the march into
the forest of my host.
Yours, with mixed feelings,

That the Fortunate Isles and the Vale of Avilion
Are dumped at Olympia. Do.”
And Lilian said, “Thos,
Happy thought !” and it was;
But that very same day it occurred to a million
Intelligent Londoners too.
There were hangings and curtains and carpets and ranges
For kitchens, and cauldrons and pots,
And vacuum-cleaners and servant-exchanges,
And toys for the infantile tots.
There were homes of the Russ
Which would not do for us;
There was furniture taken from futurist granges
At Hanwell and similar spots.
There were baths with gold taps and a malachite stopper,
And one with a card that explained
It was open to all who expended a copper
To fill it and try it. But, trained -
As we were in the rules
Of Victorian schools,
Neither Lilian nor I thought that that would be proper,
And so we severely refrained.
There were rooms which suggested the time when the
slattern
Should trouble no longer, and all
Should be comfort and peace in the empire of Saturn,
And “Lilian,” said I,
“I could drop. Let us buy
That brace of armchairs of a willowy pattern,
And rest by the side of this stall.”
But Lilian said “No." The implacable faces
Of constables frowned. With a sob
We turned us away from that palmy oasis
And went and had tea for a bob.
That was helpful, no doubt,

Through the ranks of the ravenous, squealing for places,
We all but expired in the mob.
“This is closer,” said Lil, “than the bell of a diver.”

LATEST FASHIONS IN WEDDINGs,
DANCES AND PHOTOGRAPHs.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--There's quite a
little feeling just now for being married
in the City, especially if one's forebears
have had anything to do with trade, or
the old City Companies and so on. The
power and prestige of the City, Norty
tells me, are being threatened in a most
odious way by certain persons, and the
least we can do, to stem the tide and all
that sort of thing, is to take some notice
of the City, and be married there some-
times.
The best done City wedding, so far,
has been Evangeline Merewether's (the
Exshires' second girl) to Billy Flum-
mery. The founder of the Exshire
family was a City pickle ~
merchant and Worship-
ful Master of the old
Picklemakers’ Com-
pany, and he founded
the family by inventing
apickle of which QUEEN
ELIZABETH said:
“Marry comeup,Master
Merewether, thou hast
given us a new joy with
our victuals l’’
The wedding was at
St. Anne's-Picklebury,
where the old pickle-
makers always went on
Sunday, a wonderful
old church, built by
WREN or somebody. It
had been brightened up
a bit inside, and was all
done with capsicums,
and jerkins, and doub-
loons, and those other wonderful old
vegetables they used to pickle. “Olga "
had very cleverly hinted at City interests,
royal approval, and successful pickle-
making in the cut, hang and trimmings
of Evangeline's bridal gown. Instead
of posies, the bridesmaids carried little
gilt baskets of small red pickling-
cabbages. The wedding-breakfast was
at a City hotel and we drank the dear
old City toast, “All friends round St.
Paul's,” and when we got back into
civilised regions again we all felt we'd
done great things for the City at what-
ever cost to ourselves |
Nowadays, you know, at every possi-
ble function one must dance oneself or
be the cause of dancing in others, as
SHAKSPEARE says. The sweet Peruvian
dance, the Inca Shuffle, and the equally
lovely Bolivian Bollyooma are the
dances of the moment, and, as the
Inca Shuffle has 500 steps and the
Bollyooma 700, and people who mean
|THAN Y” START SWANKIN' IT ON THE PENNY CHAIRs
them both, one's time is pretty full.
Special shoes have to be worn, of
course. For the Inca shuffle one wears
them with collapsible heels, as some
of the steps are done without heels and
others with, while for the Bollyooma
the heels are placed right in the middle
of the soles, so that one can do those
delicious teetotum twirls. Part of the
Bollyooma is done on all-fours, and
for this one has the dearest little hand-
shoes, which, of course, must match
the other ones.
When Peggy Sandys and Lolly fol-
lyott were married last week at St.
Hilary's, the Ramsgates sent out cards
for a Bollyooma wedding, and Popsy
Lady Ramsgate has been giving a
series of Bollyooma dinners, a different
step for each course, and the all-fours
step for the dessert; and now the poor

old-fashioned people call a more united

PUNCH,
A FALLEN STAR.
I MET him in Hyde Park. He was
alone, sitting on one of the penny seats.
I subsided into the next, wondering
how soon his people would join him.
Meanwhile I glanced at the paper. -
Sitting there idly reading, and now
and then stealing a glance at him, I
was conscious of two things: one that
he was asthmatic, and the other that
he was profoundly unhappy. That he
should be asthmatic was, of course,
to be expected, but I did not like his
melancholy.
Time passed, and no one arrived to
look after him, and my paper was
finished, and then, as I folded it up, he
spoke. “Good afternoon,” he said.
- Why I was not astonished to be thus
addressed by a pug dog I cannot say,
but it seemed perfectly natural. “Good
afternoon,” I replied.
“It's a long time,” he said, “since
you saw any of my kind, I expect?"
“Now I come to think of it,” I re-
plied, “it is. How is that?” .
“There's a reason,” he said. “Put
in a nutshell it's this: Peeks and
Poms, or, if you like, Poms and Peeks.”
He wheezed horribly. ---. .
I asked him to be more explicit, and
he amplified his epigram into Pekinese
and Pomeranians. - Q-
“They're all the rage now,” he ex-
plained; “and we're out in the cold. If
you throw your memory back a dozen
years or so,” he went on, “you will
recall our popularity.” -
As he spoke I did so. In the mind's
eye I saw a sumptuous carriage and
pair.'s The former was on C-springs,
and a coachman and footman were on
the box. They wore claret livery and
cockades. The footman's arms were
folded. His gloves were of a dazzling
whiteness. The horses flung out their
forelegs as though they lived on golden
oats and champagne. In the carriage
was an elderly commanding lady with
an aristocratic nose; and in her lap was
a pug dog of plethoric habit and a face
as black as your hat.
... My poor friend was watching me
with streaming eyes. “What do you
see ?” he asked.
I told him.
“There you are,” he said; “and what
do you see to-day? There, look 1"
... I glanced up at his bidding, and a
costly motor was gliding smoothly by.
It weighed several tons, and its tyres
were like circular pillows. On its
shining door was a crest. The chauf-
feur was kept warm by Russian sables.
Inside was another elderly lady, and in
her arms was a russet Pekinese. -

“So you see what I took away with
me,” he continued after a noisy pause.
“It wasn't only pugs that went, you
see. It was carriages and pairs, and
the noise of eight hoofs all at once,
and footmen with folded arms. We
passed together. Peeks, Poms and
Petrol took our place.”
I sympathised with him. “You
must transfer your affection to another
class, that's all,” I said. “If the nobs
have gone back on you, there are still
a great many pug-lovers left.”
“No,” he said, “that's no good; we
want chicken. No, we had better
become extinct.” He wept like a
number of syphons all leaking together.
“But that 's not what worries me
most,” he resumed. “The thing that's
on my mind is the loss to literature. The
novelists of our time—and we had a
long innings—knew our worth. When
they drew a duchess with her ebony
crutch-stick and all the rest of it, they
saw that her constant ally, her Grand
too. They made us too fat very often,
but they did not forget us. We shall
never find our way into novels any
more. We are back numbers.”
At this moment the man who has
charge of the chairs came up for my
penny, and when I looked round the
dog had gone. I gave the penny.
“I'm afraid I must charge you two-
pence,” the man said. -
I asked him why.
“For the dog,” he said.
“But it wasn't mine,” I assured him.
“It was a total stranger.”
“Come now,” he said; and to save
trouble I paid him. -
But how like a pug!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UNCLE EDWARD.
CELIA has more relations than would
| seem possible. I am gradually getting
to know some of them by sight and a
few more by name, but I still make
mistakes. The other day, for instance,
she happened to mention Uncle Godfrey.
“Godfrey,” I said, “Godfrey. No,
don't tell me—I shall get it in a
moment. Godfrey . . . Yes, that's it;
he's the architect. He lives at Liver-
pool, has five children and sent us the
asparagus-cooler as a wedding present.”
“No marks,” said Celia.
“Then he's the unmarried one in
Scotland who breeds terriers. I knew
I should get it.”
“As a matter of fact he lives in
London and composes oratorios.”
“It's the same idea. That was the
one I meant. The great point is that
I placed him. Now give me another
one.” I leant forward eagerly.
“Well, I was just going to ask you
—have you arranged anything about
Monday ?”
“Monday,” I said, “Monday. No
don't tell me—I shall get it in a moment.
Monday ... He's the one who
Oh, you mean the day of the week?”
“Who’s a funny?” asked Celia of
the teapot.
“Sorry, I really thought you meant
another relation. What am I doing?
I'm playing golf if I can find somebody
to play with.”
“Well, ask Edward.”
I could place Edward at once.
Edward, I need hardly say, is Celia's
uncle; one of the ones I have not yet
met. He married a very young aunt
of hers, not much older than Celia.
“But I don't know him,” I said.
“It doesn't matter. Write and ask
him to meet you at the golf club. I'm
sure he'd love to.”
“Wouldn't he think it rather cool,
this, sudden attack from a perfectly
unknown nephew 2. I fancy the first
step ought to come from uncle.”
“But you're older than he is.”
“True. It's rather a tricky point in
etiquette. Well, I'll risk it.” -
This was the letter I sent to him:—
“My DEAR UNCLE Edward, Why
haven't you written to me this term 2
I have spent the five shillings you gave
me when I came back; it was awfully
ripping of you to give it me, but I have
spent it now. Are you coming down
to see me this term 2 If you aren't you
might write to me, there is a post-
office here where you can change postal
| orders. - - -
| “What I really meant to say was, can
you play golf with me on Monday at
Mudbury Hill ? I am your new and
we met. Be at the club-house at 2.30,
if you can. I don't quite know how
we shall recognise each other, but the
well-dressed man in the nut-brown suit
will probably be me. My features
are plain but good, except where I fell
against the bath-taps yesterday. If
you have fallen against anything which
would give me a clue to your face you
might let me know. Also you might
let me know if you are a professor at
golf; if you are, I will read some more
books on the subject between now and
Monday. Just at the moment my game
is putrid.
“Your niece and my wife sends her
love. Good-bye. I was top of my
class in Latin last week. I must now
stop, as it is my bath-night.
“I am, Your loving NEPHEw.”
The next day I had a letter from my
uncle:—
“My DEAR NEPHEw,-I was so glad
to get your nice little letter and to hear
that you were working hard. Let me
know when it is your bath-night again;
these things always interest me. I
shall be delighted to play golf with you
on Monday. You will have no difficult
in recognizing me. I should describe
myself roughly as something like
Apollo and something like Edmund
Payne, if you know what I mean. It
depends how you come up to me. I
am an excellent golfer and never take

Celia confidently. “He's—well, he's

At 2.30on Monday Iarrived at the club-

people appeared, but none seemed in

there was still no available uncle. True,
there was one unattached man reading
in a corner of the smoke-room, but
he had a moustache—the sort of heavy
moustache one associates with a Major.
At three o'clock I became desperate.
After all, Celia had not seen Edward for
some time. Perhaps he had grown
a moustache lately; perhaps he had
grown one specially for to-day. At any
rate there would be no harm in asking

THE INFINITUDE OF COMMONPLACE.
By A WILCOx-worshipPER.
[“The charm of her verse is in itself a sufficient refutation of the
ridiculous assumption that the appeal of poetry has passed. There
may have been poets who have essayed to sing in a more sublime
strain. But the very fact that Mrs. Wilcox points us to the infini-
tude of the commonplace proves how completely she has identified
herself with what must be the mission of all art, and especially poetry,
in the future.”—R. DIMSDALE STocKER.]
(The gifted authoress speaks.)
I will be kind. Though idiots often madly
Rush in where expert angels never tread,
I will endure their wild incursions gladly
And cheerfully bind up each broken head.
There is no vital use in being bitter;
There is no joy in acrimonious jeers;
There is more virtue in a simple titter
Than in a wilderness of clever sneers.
I will be strong. There is no room for weakness.
The feeble folk go to the wall at length;
And I should never have achieved uniqueness
But for a brain of quite colossal strength.
Yet must Fnever use it as a tyrant,
Or trample on the unobtrusive toad,
But rather stimulate the young aspirant
To tread with fearless feet the upward road.
I will be sane. Although a bard has written
Great wits to madness closely are allied,
Madmen at large, or men by mad dogs bitten,
Are deleterious to the countryside.
But short of madness there are many mortals
Who frequently betray a mental twist,
And, if they entered an asylum's portals,
I will be sweet. Though salt is sometimes tonic
There is no balsam in the boundless brine,
And in a soil where saline streaks are chronic
The kindly fruits of nature peak and pine.
Mine be the noble task to chant and chirrup
In numbers honey-sweet for man's relief,
To ease the cosmic ill with soothing syrup
And sugar-coat the acrid pill of grief.
I will be good. The high-born and the haughty
By sin are whelmed in dark, untimely doom;
NAPOLEON, though magnificent, was naughty,
And closed his life in exile and in gloom.
Great prelates, too, unworthy of the mitre,
Have smirched their fame by deeds of ill report;
And SAPPHo, though a meritorious writer,
Would not, I think, have been received at Court.
I will be great. Some lives are all sedateness,
And some like sabres in their scabbards rust,
And some tremendous souls are born to greatness,
And some again have greatness on them thrust.
My place is with the third; sent as a healer,
To mitigate mankind's momentous lot,
I shall endure, the only ELLA WHEELER,
When even MARTIN TUPPER is forgot.

ONCE UPON A TIME.
WASTE.
ONCE upon a time there were three
toadstools. They were not the fat
brown ones like buns with custard
underneath, or the rich crimson ones
with white spots, or the delicate purple
ones. They were merely small white
ones, a good deal more like mushrooms
than it was quite fair to make them.
They sprang up within a few inches
of each other, and with every moment
added to their stature, and, as they
grew, they discussed life in all its
branches and planned for themselves
distinguished careers . .
The eldest was not more than eighteen
hours old, which is a good age for a
toadstool, when an angry boy on his
way home from the village school
kicked him into smithereens for not
being a mushroom — which is the
toadstool's unpardonable sin.
The younger brothers, watching the
tragedy, vowed to fulfil their destiny
with they prepared a placard that ran
as follows (in a form of words which
was not perhaps strictly original, but,
like most of the jokes at which audiences
laugh, was none the worse for that):-
To THE NobiLITY AND GENTRY
of ToADLAND.
YOU WANT THE BEST SEATS.
WE HAVE THEM.
Having placed this notice in a pro-
minent position they waited.
For some time nothing happened,
and then an extremely portly and
aristocratic toad, with eyes of burning
amber and one of the most decorative
waistcoats out of Bond Street, waddled
towards the expectant brothers, read
the advertisement, and sat heavily
down on the nearer of them. I need
hardly say that the stool was crushed
to pieces beneath his weight, while the
toad himself sustained, as the papers
say, more than a few contusions, and
was in a disgusting temper.
small girl, who had been sent out by
her mother to pick mushrooms, added
the surviving brother to her basket with
a little cry of triumph. “What a
beautyl" she said, and hurried home
with the prize.
But her mother was very sharp about
it. “Do you want us all in our graves?”
she said as she picked the toadstool up
and flung it into the ashbin.
“And not even the satisfaction of
poisoning any one!” he murmured as
life left him.

The Birkenhead News:—

MR. PUNCH'S F00TBALL EXPERTS.
ALTHough Mr. Punch has watched
with sympathy the spirited policy of
one of his contemporaries in employing
such authorities on the winter game as
Lady HELEN For BEs and Mr. PETT
RIDGE to report football matches, he
feels that the scheme is capable of
development. There are others able
and willing to let the public have pen-
pictures of the game they love so well.
Graphic accounts of last Saturday's
matches by some of his own corps of
| special reporters are appended:–
- BERMoNDSEY. HoRNETs
- - W. -
HANLEY Wolves.
D-v-D L.; G--RGE.
Hornets 2.* Wolves 0.
I am a comparatively
poor man, but, if I were half
as poor as the work in
front of goal of the Hanley
Wolves, I should be tempt-
ed to give up the Stºck
Exchange altogether as too
risky. It was this, com-
bined with the spectacle of
that great track of unculti-
vated land (land which
might have been congested
with happy and prosperous
agriculturists), that spoiled
my Saturday afternoon.
And this is going on all over
the country, while British
labourers emigrate to
America. I spoke to a
---
between these two football - centres
with ever-increasing activity. In 1909,
the Tigers spent £3,501 19s. 3d. on
their front line. Newcastle replied by
purchasing Scotsmen to the value of
£4,002 18s. 5d. In 1910, Newcastle
paid over six thousand pounds for
backs of the Dreadnought class. The
Tigers responded by laying down a new
goal-keeper at a cost of well into the
seventh thousand. And so it has gone
on ever since. Now, the proposal
which I put forward in the name of
His Majesty's Government is simply
this. Let Plymouth say to Newcastle:
“If you will put off buying centre-
forwards for twelve months from the
ordinary date when you would have
opened negotiations with the slave-
dealers, we will put off buying half-
backs in absolutely good faith for exactly
the same period.” That would mean'

serve, so long will this inane state of
things continue. Women are not per-
mitted to become members of First
League teams. What is the result 2
Idiotic and ineffectual struggles like
Saturday's at Leytonstone. These
footballers do not know the rudiments
of warfare. Not a single member of
either eleven carried with him on to
the field a bomb, a horse-whip or even
a hat-pin. There was an autocratic
official who, I believe, is known as the
referee. I saw this man blow his
whistle and refuse to allow one burly
player a goal which he had scored.
What did the player, the craven, do?
Did he hunger-strike, like a man of
spirit 2 No, he took it lying down.
For the rest, the Hotstuffs wear rather
sweet shirts, pink relieved with a green
insertion; and the Tuesday Afternoons'
goal-keeper has a nice face.

THIS charming and bril-

Binns, and forms an agree-

tors. In many cases whole families

I saw ten reporters huddled together
in a single room. I have no remedy to
suggest. I merely mention the facts.

The pointless struggle between these
two great teams, the third in three
successive matches, encourages me to
think that the time is now ripe for
some sane arrangement for the reduc-
tion of excessive armaments. For
that there would be a complete holiday
for one year between Plymouth and
Newcastle. The relative strength of
the two teams would be absolutely
unchanged.

The crude exhibition of masculine
fatuity which attracted 30,000 pre-
judiced males to Laytonstone on Satur-
day ended, as one might have foreseen,
in a result which was no result—a
result as negative and fruitless as the
Government's opposition to the Cause.
A pointless draw, I heard it called by
one man. Another, a moment later,
stated that each side had secured a
point. Can anything better illustrate
the futilities and contradictions of this
man-made sport 2 As long as football
is confined to one sex, as long as Man
Wealthy, cultivated, - and
accomplished, Mr. Binns has travelled
everywhere and met everybody—at
least everybody who is also somebody.
His recollections range from Mr. GLAD-
ston E to LoLA MonTEZ, and they have
the merit of being expressed in an
admirably vivid style, as the following
extracts will abundantly prove. For
example, when Mr. Binns asked Mr.
GLADsToNE whether he was an Anti-
Semite, the G.O.M. replied, “How could
I be when my name is a translation of
Gluckstein and my favourite fish is
salmon?” And yet there are those
who say that Mr. GLADSTONE had no
sense of humour!
Mr. Binns, staunch republican though
he is, is never happier than when he is
discussing royal or imperial personages.

book than the following touching anec-

OUR TAINTED EDUCATION.
A correspondent who signs himself
“Paterfamilias,” but whom we believe
to be nothing of the sort, writes to
protest against the introduction of
politics into the school teaching of the
present day. “The English History
lesson,” he very truly says, “has long
been a medium for disseminating the
particular political opinions of the
teacher; and, in arithmetic, sums in-
volving a mental struggle with exports
and imports are, in my opinion, to be
gravely suspected. I need hardly add
that a vast amount of criticism of the
War Office can be introduced into half-
an-hour's lesson in geography. And
the evil continues to spread.

once a strong letter to her school-
mistress, objecting to the unloading of
this pernicious political nonsense on to
the immature intelligence of a child of
tender years, and a somewhat curt
reply came back to the effect that it
was not politics at all, but hygiene !
“Yesterday my son came home from
school full of new facts about what his
schoolmaster is pleased to call natural
history. But, Sir, only a brief question-
ing sufficed to reveal that under the
guise of nature-study my child is learn-
ing some of the most dangerous political
doctrines of the day, especially those
relating to the foodstuffs in favour
among the feathered dwellers in our
woods and copses.
“Hygiene and natural history, for-
sooth ! Ten minutes in almost any
railway compartment in the country

“No, Francesca,” I said, “I will not.”
“What, you won't take your medicine?”

“But is that wise ?”
“No, it is probably the height of folly, but I am beyond
caring for that. I have a gnawing pain in my—Ow-ow,

Francesca, I had expected better things of you.”
“But Dr. Willett said it would relieve you.”
“How can he know 2 " I said. “I have had one dose of
his hateful fluid, and I'm sure it has thrown me back a

any rate, can feel what it does to me. It gives me cold

interest.

“Then this is the moment for smoothing your pillow and
helping you to put on your flannel jacket.”
“You shall smooth my pillow, if you like; but you shall
not speak of my old rowing coat as a flannel jacket.”
“Certainly not,” she said, “if you object. We women
have no sense of the dignity of things, have we?”

“If you think so, Francesca, you deceive yourself. I

That stands to reason.”
“I know,” she said. “It is a shame.”
“Yes, it is. I wonder why I of all men should have

Dinners, you know, and champagne and port. I'm told
they're all deadly.”
“And that,” I said, “shows how you misjudge me.”
“But you have had some dinners, you know.”
“Only one a day, and that a meagre one.”
“And you have drunk some port and champagne.”
“A thimbleful here and there,” I said. “How can that
matter?”
“I will not have Dr. Willett thrown in my teeth.”
“Well, he has to examine your tongue, you know.”
“Francesca, your jests are ill-timed. I want you to
realize that my gout is not rich man's gout, due to excess
in eating and drinking. It is poor man's gout, due to
under-ſeeding and over-working and worry.”
“They all say that,” said Francesca. “Sir William Bowles
is most emphatic about his gout, and Charlie Carter always
tells me he can't make out why he should have it, living
such a simple life as he does.” -
“There you are, you see. The men who ought to know
best all agree with me.”
“Not a bit of it,” she said. “They both said they quite
understood why you had the gout, with your City dinners
and all that.”
“I despise them and their opinions.”

“That's just it,” I said. “He’s too intelligent. He has

(A Hint to Young Men.)
I NEveR loved the baleful briar-wood,
Nor longed for any herb but asphodel,
Dut then they said it did the system good,
Nerves and all that. I bought a pipe—and fell.
Pale and alone I sucked the sacred reed;
I drew deep breaths, and chunks of fragrant weed
Swept through the orifice, a good old feed,
And golden juice from some perennial well.
A cold, cold sweat stood wanly on my brow,
Yet still I plied its vile unnatural cause.
While hardened smokers came and showed me how,
And took great pains to tell me all their laws—
How such a herb was fit for men more skilled,
And such was mild, or hot or opium-filled;
I hated it—and them—and yet, weak-willed,
Held ever some foul tube between my jaws.
For, while I hated, habit held me tight,
Till soon I saw the essence of the show
Was, after all, to keep the thing alight—
And why need that impair the vitals so?
One can have all—the something hard to chew,
The something (not too difficult) to do—
Yet never draw the fatal juices through,

Nor die of smoker's heart. You simply blow.

Saturday, October 25th, 1913.−The
reference made by Mr. LLoyd GEORGE,
in the opening speech of the Land
Campaign, to the serious depredations
made by pheasants has brought me a
huge mass of correspondence. I under-
stand that among economists this state-
ment is generally regarded as the most
arresting and important item in all
that terrible indictment. But I am
myself more closely in touch with
sportsmen and naturalists, who also
have much to say upon the subject.
I have, for instance, a letter from a
Highland Laird who writes (from his
castle on the Wee Wheen Saft Estate,
near the Yetts of Drumtoolie):– “The
habits of black-game in this district
have often been a source of considerable
surprise to visiting naturalists. During
the month of September they would
seem to subsist almost entirely upon a
diet of mushrooms, and they frequently
approach quite close to the house in
But reformers are beginning to feel
that some compensation is due to the
school-children who, if they cannot
bring home to their mothers the cus-
tomary supplies, will naturally be
deprived of their winter ketchup.”
“Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's statement
does not surprise me in the least,”
writes “An Old Naturalist” from Bally-
folly, Co. Down. “Anyone who has
ever seen the wild duck in this district
gathering up the butter-cups on the
lawn after a shower of rain will have
no difficulty at all in accepting it.”
“Small Holder" writes from Kent to
the effect that he has never suffered any
inconvenience from pheasants; and the
CHANCELLOR, in his opinion, is entirely
upon the wrong tack. What he wants is
adequate protection—or compensation,
or both—in the matter of the depreda-
tions of badgers. It is perfectly heart-
rending, he says, to observe them at
work, digging up potatoes.
“Let the whole matter be fully
can tell you I am running up a pretty
bill for scarecrows this season.
Business is becoming almost impossible
owing to the prevalence of coveys of
grouse in the strawberry beds.”
That the CHANCELLOR's powerful
words have not been spoken in vain is
already made sufficiently clear by the
sudden and startling advance in the
price of wire-netting.

“BETweFN SUNSET AND DAWN.”
“THE GREEN CocKAToo.”
SEven hours by the directions in the
programme —actually less than two
hours by stage reckoning—seem, per-
haps, a short allowance of time for a
man to make his first acquaintance
with a woman, become intimate with
her to the length of Christian names,
propose elopement, change his mind,
and then stab her fatally in the back.
But things move fast in a doss-house,
where the hesitancies and circumlocu-
tions of ordinary life are apt to be
ignored; and matters may be still
further accelerated when one of the
parties happens to be mad.
The real trouble was that nobody,
except, perhaps, the madman himself,
was in the secret of his mental estrange-
ment. Looking back, one recognises
certain indications of it; but at the time,
unfamiliar as we were with the accepted
manners of a doss-house management,
we assumed that the opprobrious
terms in which Jim Harris addressed
his mother, constantly offering to
“wring her neck,” represented
the ordinary filial attitude towards a
gin-sodden parent in these circles. I
admit that a drunken acquaintance of
his did hint that Jim was an eccentric,
but as, at the same time, he referred
contemptuously to his habit of reading
+ books, we merely took this to be the
author's satire upon a society in which
a taste for culture was regarded as a
sign that its owner was not all there.
Some, again, might have suspected
his sanity when he was prepared with
an easy conscience to run away with
another man's wife, but was put off by
the fact that she had told her husband
a lie about his feelings for her. Per-
sonally, I trace no indication of mad-
ness in this nice distinction on a point
of honour. Indeed, I found so much
method in the madness of his final act
that it seemed to me the most reason-
able solution of the difficulty. It was
impossible to let her return to the
savagery of her legal husband; and,
since it was unthinkable that she should
| be allowed to go on the streets, the only
alternative was that he should go off with
her, a scheme from which her instincts
had always revolted, and which had
been abandoned by him on the ground
of her proved capacity for lying. So he
killed her, in the certain knowledge
that he was saving her from a life of
horror or shame, and in the vague hope
that he was sending her straight to
heaven, and might possibly follow her
by way of the gallows.
One was reminded of the spiritual
BRowNING's poem, Porphyria's Lover,
where the girl's soul is saved by the
killing of her body:-
‘‘I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
In one long yellow string I wound
Three times her little throat around
And strangled her.”
Mr. NoFMAN McKINNEL has become
so habituated to the brutal method, of
which he is a past master, that he finds
difficulty in relaxing his facial muscles
to the semblance of amorous infatua-
tion. But this only lent an air of

naturalness to what, in the play, pur-
ported to be a first essay in love-
making. It seemed to me a very intel-
ligent performance, but then—and I
say it without boastfulness—experience
has given me no standard of doss-house
manners to go by. Mr. EDMOND BREON,
as Bill Higgins, the drunken husband,
looked the part to admiration. Miss
ADA KING was an astoundingly lifelike
figure as Mrs. Harris, and, whether
or not the name was chosen by design,

Here we did not simply say, “This
looks like a clever piece of play-acting,
a tour de force in something outside the
common experience”; rather we felt,
by an intuition which responded to her
own, that she had merged her person-
ality in that of the woman, body and
soul.
The Green Cockatoo, a “grotesque”
in one Act, which followed this grim
little tragedy in the “Grand Guignol”
vein, was the name of a subterranean
tavern in Paris which the aristocracy
used to frequent for the joy of meeting
various desperadoes, who recounted the
story of their crimes. Actually they
were just innocent mummers who
flattered themselves that they were
imposing upon the credulity of their
audience, though the habitués of the
place had, of course, got beyond the
stage of deception.
Among the actors is a certain Henry,
who has just married a notorious
courtesan of the stage, and proposes
to lead the simple life with her in the
provinces. He comes in to tell how he
has found his wife intriguing with the
Duc de Cadignan and has killed that
nobleman. The old hands in the stage-
audienceregard hisperformance as avery
fine sample of histrionics; but socircum-
stantial and probable is his story that
we in the other audience are left in
doubt whether he has not been giving
us a slice of actual life. Meanwhile
Henry learns from the evidence of an
actual criminal (who happens to find
himself in this atmosphere of imagined
crime and can't get anyone to listen to
his true tale of murder) that at least
a part of his story is true: that his
wife has indeed been unfaithful to him.
At this moment the alleged corpse
enters, less concerned about his love-
affair than about the Revolutionary mob
that holds the streets outside. Henry
at once plants a knife in his betrayer's
back (Mr. McKINNEL's second mortal
blow with the same weapon in the
same quarter of the anatomy during
the course of one evening), and in the
popular enthusiasm provoked by the
announcement of the fall of the Bastille
his act is regarded as a sound and
citizenlike piece of work.
An excellent little drama, full of
colour and movement, and with a nice
ironic blend of comedy and tragedy,
but perhaps rather complicated and
overcrowded (there are two-and-twenty
characters) for a one-Act play. O. S.

Though some of his novels are better than others there
is no such thing as a bad novel by Mr. H. DE WERE
STACPooDE. He seems incapable of those side-slips which
mar the smooth career of most authors. Just where on the
list I should place The Children of the Sea (HUTCHINson) I
hardly know. In some ways it is the finest piece of work
he has ever done. Very few novelists could have treated
so horrible a central idea with the same delicacy. It is
extraordinary how, without weakening his story in any
way, he contrives to avoid grossness. For this reason, I
think I should place the book at the head of his list, con-
sidered purely as an example of the art of writing. On the
other hand, I have enjoyed reading some of his other works
a good deal more. Perhaps “bracketed first" is the best
decision. Of the three books into which the story is
divided, I liked the first best, which is set in the Sea of Japan,
and culminates with the adventure which ultimately wrecked
the life of Erikr Ericsson, of the cable-laying ship, the
President Girling. There is nobody like Mr. STACPoole for
conveying scenery and atmosphere in a few sentences; and
he is at his best in his descriptions of the strange colony of
sea-women among the sand-hills by the Japanese telegraph
station. Iceland is the scene of Books Two and Three;
and here the author, though just as successful in handling
his material, has less attractive material to handle. It is
in the second book that Schwalla, the cousin of his ship-
has something of the quality of a saga. It is great with a
greatness in keeping with its background of sea and rocks
and ice; and over it broods the ever-deepening shadow
of the final tragedy. If ever there was a story devised to
inspire pity and terror, this is it. I do not recommend the
book to those who demand a happy ending from their
novels; and I doubt whether it will have the popularity of
its predecessor from the same pen, The Order of Release;
but there can be no two opinions as to its artistic merits.
Tide Marks (METHUEN), by MARGARET WESTRUP (Mrs.
SYDNEY STACEY), is more ambitious than a delightful work
by the same author entitled Elizabeth's Children. That
earlier book had, I think, a quite unusual vein of humour
and sentiment, and the characters concerned were nice
human people who moved and spoke in a very real amusing
world. But now I am afraid that Mrs. STACEY wishes to
advance in her art, and I suspect that the simple humours.
of Elizabeth's Children seem to her very tame and common-
place beside the vagaries of her new heroine. The lady in
question is, to quote the publishers, “the child of a gipsy
mother and an ascetic father,” and she has inherited, of
course, a quantity of temperament which she splashes about
upon the rocks and moors of Cornwall. It is regrettable
that Cornwall lends itself rather too readily to loose colour
and haphazard passion, and I am beginning to feel that
its use as a background in the novels of the day is very
often a confession of weakness. In any case, the sea and
the gipsy mother and the ascetic father have proved quite too

and unsatisfactory a creature as ever ate pilchards. The
author is happier in less exotic company, and I hope that
in her next book she will give us one of her own delightful
studies in ordinary human beings rather than an imitative
portrait of a girl who is both unpleasant and unreal.
Of all the female, not to say feminist, stories that ever I
read, Gold Lace (CHAPMAN AND HALL) seems the most
entirely characteristic. So much so that I question whether
the mere male reviewer is qualified to appreciate the nuances
of Miss ETHEL. Col.BURN MAYNE's conception. There is
really nothing whatever in the story but atmosphere; that,
however, seems to me to be fairly well done. It is by no
means a pleasant or exhilarating atmosphere, but that is
not the point. The scene of it is a small garrison and
naval town in Ireland (you can fairly easily supply the
original of it for yourself); and the story, such as it is,
treats of the relations between the migrant Service visitors
and the resident youth and beauty of the place. Miss ETHEL
Col.BURN MAYNE writes,
scarify (the occasions are rare) he does not dip his pen—I
crave pardon for varying my metaphors; but what are
metaphors meant for if not to be varied?—he does not dip
his pen in vitriol, but in the no less deadly mixture of his
subject's own egotism, vanity, ambition and unwarranted
self-respect. If he compares Mr. ST. Loe STRACHEY with
Pecksniff it is only because Mr. STRACHEY himself has, in a
moment of what may be called unctuous recklessness, made
that very comparison. “To Mr. and Mrs. Webb,” says
Mr. GARDINER in another essay, “we are statistics. We are
marshalled in columns, and drilled in tables, and explained
in appendices. We do not move to some far-off divine
event, but to a miraculous perfection of machinery and a
place in decimals.” . The book is full of these agreeable
flashes of literary lightning.

the damsels of Rainville independence and the art of

characters, my own impression was of a good light comedy

In Pillars of Society (NISBET) Mr. A. G. GARDINER gives
us a second selection from his portrait-gallery of the cele-

that leads to bludgeon-work has no attraction for him.
If, for instance, fate had imposed on him the duty of doing
Mr. Blank's work as editor of The IRoaring Review, it is
safe to assume that he would have carried his task through
with perfect efficiency and despatch, but he would not have
left on his readers the impression that they had been
taking part in a low public-house brawl. It is fortunate
for Liberals that their champion in the personal style of
journalism should have so strong a sense of literary courtesy
that, when occasion requires, he can polish off his foe with
a series of rapier-thrusts that leave the victim smiling in

off-moments he shot recklessly and indifferently, sat with
insecurity in his saddle, ate voraciously, swore copiously, lost
his temper often, and cracked the poorest and most dismal of
jests. Luckily his greatness was such that it does not suffer
by so intimate an exposure of his minor habits, and the
biographer, no mere detractor, but a loyal, if scrupulous
admirer, is alive to this. It may have been his deliberate
intention to emphasise the god-like attributes of his subject
by setting them against a background of human weaknesses;
if this be so, Mr. LE SUEUR has succeeded in his purpose and
committed a peculiarly noble act of friendship, seeing that
it was the habit of Mr. RHoDEs, ever generous with his
own possessions, to make lavish distributions also from the
not too complete wardrobes of his secretaries. This one
in particular has reason to believe that what was once his
best dress-coat is at the moment adorning the back of a

revenge, but has paid a proper tribute to the memory of
his master, hero and despoiler.

SHOCKING EXAMPLES.
[“The presentment of a case by means of
'shocking examples'—Mr. Lloyd George's
most trusty weapons—is clearly in the highest
degree fallacious.”—The Times.
NoTE.—In the shocking examples that
follow, the author does not claim to present
a case against any partieular class; nor are
they examples of the iniquity of any particu-
lar system; but that doesn't make them any
less shocking.] - - - - - -
THE REFoRMED" LANDLORD.
THERE was once a landlord (I sup-
press his name and locality) who owned
a suburban property and had grown rich
on improvements made by his tenants.
But, being shown the error of his ways,
he determined to be a better man. And
on the expiration of certain three leases
which the tenants did not wish to renew
he let the properties for a period of
fourteen years to A, B, and C, with
the undertaking that at the end of that
term he would demand no compensation
for improvements, but, on the other
hand, would himself recoup the tenants
for their outlay. Further, he nobly
refused to put into the leases any har-
assing conditions that might limit his
tenants in the development of their
respective properties. And A turned
his house into a fever hospital, and B
started a brick-kiln, and C set up a fish-
manure business. And after the lapse of
twelve months all the surrounding yearly
tenants left the neighbourhood, and no
one would take their houses, and the
landlord was reduced to great straits.
...And at the end of fourteen years A, B,
and C demanded compensation for im-
provements and also for the goodwill of
their respective establishments. And
the landlord is now in the workhouse.
THE MAN who BIT THE HAND THAT
- FED HIM.
There was once a poãcher (you are
not to ask me his name) who died. And
the duke whose game he had poached
(he also shall be anonymous) took pity
on the orphan child of the deceased, and
had him educated at a distance, so that
his father's record should be no re-
proach to him. And the boy imbibed
knowledge so well that he grew up to
be a Socialist. And returning to the
scene of his birth he preached the doc-
trine of the wickedness of landlords at
the very gates of his benefactor. And
having thus convinced the neighbouring
tenants that all landlords, and notably
dukes, were the seed of the devil, he in-
duced them to migrate. And by an active
boycott and the employment of other
forms of peaceful persuasion, he made
the vacant tenancies very undesirable.
And the land passed out of cultivation;
and the duke, being in great difficulties,
forced sale. And it was bought by a
gentleman from the Stock Exchange,
who turned it into a golf course.
And the duke is now engaged in the
logging trade in Saskatchewan. But
in recognition of his good work the
poacher's son has received an appoint-
ment as an itinerant lecturer on the
evils of the feudal system.
THE RAILwAY THAT weNT CHEAP.
There was once a Chairman of a
Railway (which I will not specify),
and he contrived by very careful
management just to make ends meet
and give a modest return to the share-
holders. And there were strikes, and
the wages of the company's employees
had to be raised to prevent further in-
convenience to the great travelling
public. And the rates on the company's
land went up, and the public demanded
better and better accommodation and
faster and faster trains and more and
more of them, and he said: “I’m
afraid we must charge our passengers
a slightly, higher price or we shall be
insolvent.” And the Government said:
“No, you mustn't; on the other hand you
must reduce your charge for farmers'
merchandise.” And the Government
also said: “We insist on better arrange-
ments for the safety of your employees.”
And all this cost a great deal, and the
price of the shares went down and down.
| And then the Government said: “We
will nationalize your railway.” And
at this threat the shares went further
down and further down; and when they
had got as low as they could the Govern-
ment bought the railway. And it was
considered a very clever deal. And the
Government had many new posts to
offer, and they awarded several situa-
tions as porters and brakesmen to the
old shareholders. -
THE Doctor's GooDw11.L.
There was once a doctor (who shall
be nameless), and he sold his practice
to a young man from the country, to
whom he represented its value as £400|
per annum. But he did not mention
that the chief source of his income was
the case of a patient, an old lady
alleged to be incurable, whom for years
he had been in the habit of attending
daily at a fee of one guinea. And the
new doctor was very honest, and by the
end of three months he had completely
cured the patient, and in consequence
was himself a ruined man.
THE CONVERTED EMBEzzler.
There was once a Nonconformist
Minister (he shall remain incognito)
whose stipend was derived in large
measure from the pew-rents. And he
had a man-of-all-work who cleaned
his bulbs. And one day this man
embezzled two spoons and a fork, the
property of his master. And this
came to the knowledge of the Non-
conformist Minister, who spoke to him
as man to man upon the vice of petty
larceny, and then, having a very kind
heart, forgave him. And this treat-
ment had so softening an effect upon
the character of the man-of-all-work
that he adopted a religious life and
began to preach in the open air. And
his favourite spot for preaching was on
a common adjacent to his master's
tabernacle. And so popular and per-
suasive was his manner of preaching
that he quickly drew away, the regular
congregation whose pew-rents supported
the pastor. And when I last heard of
the reverend gentleman he was in sore
plight, and talked of entering Parlia-
ment for the sake of the salary.

WHAT'S IN A NAME?
I said to myself in a confident tone:–
“The lady I marry (and keep)
Must not be distinguished by beauty
alone, -
For beauty is only skin deep.
I know I should tire of a doll in a day;
For something more lasting I'll look.”
And then in my usual provident way
I married Amelia Cook.
: : -
Deceived by her name, I imagined the
girl
My passion would duly requite
By making my days one continuous
whirl * * -
Of epicurean delight. " .
By way of a dowry I begged her to bring
A copy of Beeton, her book.
Oh! I thought I was doing a sensible
thing . - . .
In wedding Amelia Cook, .
Alas for those glorious visions of mine
I find that the lady can show
No shadow of skill in the cookery line,
No deftness in dealing with dough.
My high expectations are knocked on
the head ; ; -
Dyspepsia's come to supplant
The hopes that I cherished the day
that I wed --
Amelia Cook; for she can't.
From an interview in The Daily
Dispatch —
“This subtle proposal of orchestral con-
certs for the poor is but the thin edge of
the wedge to gradually freeze out the new
organisation with the assistance of the rate-
p lyers' money.”

thin end of a red herring drawn across

“I say, MADDICK, You AND JENKINS HAVE GOT A FAIR walk-over IN THE Foursomes THIs AFTERNoon.”
“My DEAR FELLow, IT's A THousAND TO ONE AGAINST Us. WHEN I PUT HIM -ox THE GREEN HE PUTTS ME of F AGAIN."
THE NEW WAY WITII
LANDLORDS.
(By a Labouring Man.)
My landlord had sent me a neat little.
| document, “To quarter's rent due
September 29th–912 10s. 0d.” He is
a trifle too punctual in these little atten-
| tions. Now were I landlord I should
occasionally show sympathy with my
| tenants by forgetting a quarter-day. I
know that I could easily forget quarter-
days. I give you my solemn word of
honour that were it not for these little
reminders I should not know a quarter-
day from an ordinary day.
Generally I send the man a cheque,
and at the same time put up a petition
that the bank-manager may be in a
kindly frame of mind when it is paid in.
This time (after Bedford and Swindon) I
merely sent him anote asking him to call.
He came in with the genial smile of
one who is (or imagines he is) about to
draw money and shook hands quite
affably. Then he produced a fountain-
pen and began to scribble a receipt.
“Wait one moment,” I said. “I
think you will admit that England's
chief glory is her literature.”
“Yes, yes,” he replied, prematurely
producing a stamp.
“At present,” I continued, “literature
competition is telling. Inferior pro-
ducts from the Isle of Man have
glutted the market. Besides, the
weather this summer has been un-
favourable to literary production. It is
impossible to work on fine golfing days.
Now you will admit that the foundation
of literature is the dwelling-house?”
“Yes,” he answered, and courageously
licked his stamp.
“It stands to reason. The house is
a prime necessity. One must have a
house as a place for the return of manu-
scripts. You couldn't expect the
postman to deliver them to a field or a
golf-links, could you?”
“No,” he said dubiously.
“I am glad you follow me. You will
perhaps further agree with me that any
financial shortage caused by literary
depression must be transferred to you.
I propose to deduct for that at the
rate of £25 per annum, or £6 5s. 0d.
for the quarter. Now comes the im-
portant question of the living wage.”
He stared blankly at me.
“At all events the dependants on
literature are entitled to a living wage.
Without the services of my cook I
should starve. The production of litera-
ture would cease. She demands an
advance of 10s. a month, and the house-
maid requires a sympathetic advance.
£3 for the quarter. This, of course,
must also be passed on to you.”
“Why?” he asked feebly.
“Because you are the landlord. But
I am forgetting the great question of
the housing of the literary classes. Am
I to work in a chilled, cold, miserable
condition? Is my intelligence to be
numbed by unfavourable conditions?”
The landlord looked at me as if it was
his intelligence that was being numbed.
“Therefore,” I concluded emphatically,
“I deduct £3 10s. 0d., the cost of the
new gas-stove for my writing-room.
Now if you will kindly hand me that
receipt you have so thoughtfully pre-
pared and the small sum of five shillings
we shall be square.” - -
And then, I deplore to relate, the
landlord, who is a Vice-President of a
Liberal Association, used disgusting
language about putting the bailiffs in.
“Evict me?” I cried. Evict me be-
cause I am a follower of LLoyd GEORGE”
The Commissioners will never tolerate an
eviction for political reasons. This, Sir,
is free England.” And I showed him out.

Up in green envelopes at two-and-six ?

And sometimes eat young birds. Ah, who can tell

But Death absolved these things and, strewing spice,
Made toilet apparatus of thy mop.
And now less high, and now with no demur,
Far other now than when the yelping cur
Bayed thee, I purchased at a chemist's shop
This tuft of votive fur.
And stout has been its service. Oft and often
For toil half over (ere the steel cut in),
For fangless bristles that embraced my chin
With amorous claspings and with suds that soften
And make the beard more kindly, I have poured
Libation to thy soul, thou beast adored,
Who moist'nest hard lips with the hair that tames !
There sprout no hairs like those the badger keeps
To curb men's stubble when the daylight peeps,
Lest their saluted consorts whimper, " James !

And none of what wild kisses went to smother
The unprofitable harvest of the night
Shall fade from my remembrance. Gentle sprite,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOHN UPJOHN.
THE LATEST LITERARY SENSATION.
John Upjohn is not a Frenchman.
To the despair of MARIE CLAIRE,
ANToNIN DUsserre and others as yet
undiscovered he is a mere Englishman.
I will admit that it took me a dickens
of a time to find him. The blue eyes
were the difficulty—that and the shy-
ness. I found plenty of them in humble
positions who could write; in fact the
difficulty would have been to find any-
one who could write occupying anything
but a humble position. But they would
have-looked all wrong in the photo-
graphs and would almost certainly have
come to London, smoked cigarettes and
visited picture palaces, if I had made
them famous, instead of remaining
meekly at the forge or the plough or
the wood-chopper.
I found John in Blankshire. It is
necessary thus to disguise the name
of the county that John may not be
bothered by reporters. I am deter.
| mined that he shall not be lionized,
for when spoken to he always runs.
When I brought him up to see his
publisher (also mine) to discuss terms,
we had to lock the door of the room to
keep him with us. Even then he spent
the whole time butting at the panels.
That night, so pleased was he to be
back in Blankshire, he slept with the
plough in his arms.
Yes, John Upjohn works on a farm.
A farm — hayricks, rabbits, poultry,
midges, wasps, nightingales, sheep,
cows, cider and all that. It is an
amazing thing. No wonder they sneer
at me at my club when I tell them. I
often tell them. Those whom I have
taken the most pains with are the most
obstinate. One friend of mine not only
refuses to believe in John Upjohn but
refuses to believe there is such a thing
as a farm. This is absurd. There are
farms. Just as there are suns and
moons and stars. But I am afraid I
am falling into John Upjohn's style.
Let me tell you something of his life.
He rises at three, washes the sheep at
four, bathes the hens at five, hard-boils
the eggs at six, breakfasts on hay and
oil-cake at seven, brews cider at eight,
grows hops at nine, sings ragtime to
the bees at ten, shoots starlings off the
fruit-trees at eleven, digs potatoes at
twelve. His afternoons are much the
same, save that the horses, pigs and
cows are washed instead of the sheep.
But you know the routine. When
nothing else occurs to him, he ploughs
—and then does some more ploughing.
What first prompted him to write
would be difficult to explain. Perhaps
it was because his master, the farmer,
leg of the kitchen table was called
Select Female Biographies, and the one
they tore papers out of for spills was
A Guide to Conchology. Seeing these
about must have fired his ambition.
At first he contented himself with
mere mural monographs. The earliest
of these is in the hop oast and has
been glazed over and photographed. It
reads “Pie Powder and Proper Pride,
Scissorwitch and Cambridgeshire.” It
shows a taste for alliteration but has no
other literary value. Genius had hardly
rumbled then.
At the age of twenty-five we find him
writing in a memorandum-book. On
the one side he would enter his wages,
which were two shillings per week.
On the other he would record the
expenditure. Thus:—
- £ s. d. 4 s. d.
Erned . . . . 0 2 O Lorst ... 0 13 6
Carry forward 0 12 6
Totcl 0 13 6
There is a mistake here, as you will
discover by adding the items in the
first columns. Six and nothing are six.
He has the pence right. But twelve
and two are fourteen. He has thirteen.
Thirteen from fourteen is one. So that
he is one out. We who are educated
may sneer, but you must remember that
this simple fellow was never at Eton or
St. John's, Leatherhead, and to get only
one out when your education has been
confined to five or six years at a parish
school is no mean achievement.
Later in life we find something more
than a mere record of financial opera-
tions in this well-thumbed book. Some
of the entries are almost diaristic. For
example:—
“Went for boss with hedge hook and
got lamd.”
At first sight it would seem that
John, annoyed with his employer, had
attacked him with a hedgehog. But it
does not do to entirely mistrust (John
would say mistrust entirely) the young
genius's spelling. Enquiries extending
over several weeks revealed the fact
that in John's neighbourhood there is
such a thing as a hedge hook. It is a
long weapon used for trimming hedges,
and John, in his naif way, had no
doubt planned to behead his employer
with it.
It was not till he reached the age of
thirty that he attempted a connected
narrative. This took the shape of a
letter to a village tailor:—
DEAR SIR,-When will my cloathes
be reddy? I reckon our side ought to
win Saturday.
Yours truly, John Upjohn.
You note the reticence, the domes-
Well, the book is all like that. Just
simple. When you have read it you
will feel like eating grass and n:co ng
like “a grave, kind cow.” You will
feel uplifted, stop the cat's fish, cut
down the housekeeping and go and see
Diplomacy.
Anyway you can't help being better.
The price will be only three shillings
and sixpence (including my preface and
a full-length photograph of me and
John), and the publishers are, of course,
Messrs. Bilge and Bluff.
THE FAME OF cHARLoTTE.
Who Charlotte was we may not know.
We meet her in the pleasant ways
Of an old book of long ago,
A memoir of the Georgian days,
Of courts and coaches, routs and
lays;
And, postscript to a lady's letter,
We find the simple, touching phrase,
“Poor Charlotte's chilblains are no
better.”
It sweetly comes across the years
Like some old simple song and
quaint
Borne softly to our jangled ears
Fragrant and fresh, and ah, how
faint.
Yet all who lack the modern tain;
Of hard and callous thought, will
quicken
In sympathy with that complain',
By which poor Charlotte's feet were:
stricken.
A shadow of a gentle name,
She passes, never to return;
Her maiden age, her slender fame,
We find not, howsoe'er we yearm.
Only she had—'tis all we learn—
Two loyal friends (of good position)
Who showed a mutual concern
About their Charlotte's sad condition.
No doubt she mildly lived and died,
A grey-toned lady, fair and sweet,
Much honoured by the countryside,
Precise in all her ways and neat;
She shunned the cold, and loved the
heat;
And, by the customs of Society,
Held all light comments on her feet
An act of grossest impropriety.
O irony of vain repute!
O bitter ſame that makes a slave
Of him who starts the long pursuit,
Nor wins the goal for which men
crave.
Full many a gallant heart and brave
Has missed the crown for which he
lusted ; -

Learns her renown, and turns dis-

Old Sportsman (escaping out of danger zone). “WHEN I subscribed To THE OLYMPIC GAMES TALENT FUND I ExPECTED othea
PEOPLE To Do THIS sort of THING FOR ME.” -
How GENIUS works.
THE great vespertinal publicist, Mr.
FILsoN YoUNG, has been combating the
notion that the excellence of literary
work varies in a direct ratio with the
clearness of the atmosphere. With
him fine weather engenders idleness,
while in foul weather he can settle
down contentedly to the assiduous com-
position of his most illuminating italici-
sations. This momentous revelation
of the mentality of a great writer has
suggested a comparison of the methods
of other eminent luminaries of the lite-
rary firmament. - -
Mr. GALsworthy finds the creative
impulse most active in sleet or heavy
rain. As a preparation for composition
he finds nothing so stimulating as to
be towed slowly in a bath-chair round
Wormwood Scrubbs prison on a moist
November afternoon.
Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT, while claiming
to be impervious to the weather, admits
that the quality of his work varies con-
siderably with the conditions and the
place in which it is composed. The
ideal spot for creative work he finds to
which he dictates through a tube to a
typist located in the saloon. This
position, he finds, gives him a sense of
detachment and exaltation which is
indispensable to the -artist. When,
however, the scene is laid in the Five
Towns, he prefers to potter about his
garden, with his amanuensis within
earshot but concealed behind the shrub-
beries. -
Mr. Robert HICHENs, unlike Mr.
FILson YouNg, is never so fertile in
ideas as under the blazing sun of North
Africa. Much, however, depends on
costume, his favourite attire being an
Arab jibbah, with a green turban, and
sandals of cream-laid crocodile skin.
One of the great advantages of writing
in the desert, he points out, is that you
never require any blotting-paper. For
emotional passages he finds the gait of
the camel, or, better still, the dromedary,
peculiarly stimulating.
Mr. ALGERNoN Ashton, recalling
Swift's genial remark that the happi-
est faces were to be seen in mourning
coaches, observes that the constant
contemplation of the emblems of our
mortality is the best antiseptic to pes-
best letters and his most hilarious
musical compositions have come to
him in churchyards. As he puts it:—
“When my mood is propitious to joking,
When my temper is blithe and serene,
I hie me instanter to Woking,
Or Kensal's funereal Green.”
Contrariwise, the spectacle of a harle-
quinade always acts upon him as a
“depressant.” Indeed, it was while wit-
nessing a pantomime at Drury Lane that
he began the composition of his famous
crematorio, “The World in Ashes.”
“The tubgoat Volunteer tried to render
assistance, but ran against the Hero's
propeller.”—Yorkshire Evening Post.
Our own pet tubgoat Algernon would
not have butted in so impulsively.
“SIR,-Re Mr. Fortune's letter in your
last week's issue, surely it is well known that
the apparent increase in the size of both the

WHAT MUSIC MEANS.
SPEARING of “the musical side” of the
production of his new opera, Joan of
Arc, to a representative of The Daily
Chronicle Mr. RAYMond Róze declared
himself very satisfied with the cast.
“My prima donna, by the way, is an
expert horsewoman, in fact she has often
broken in horses, so that she will be
quite at home in the saddle when she
rides on to the stage. Horses, I may
say, are used in several scenes of the
opera.”
Mr. RAYMoND Róze's very proper
insistence on the possession of athletic
and sporting qualities as essential to the
success of the purely “musical side" of
his opera has been very well received in all
quarters. It is understood that a famous
jockey has approached Mr. RAYMoND
Róze with a view to his writing an
opera on the subject of MAZEPPA, in
which he should be entrusted with the
title rôle. The jockey—who does not
wish his name to appear for the
present—has no musical ear and prac-
tically no voice (thus differing widely
from Mr. Róze's prima donna), but, as
he points out, in such a part a mastery
of the art of equitation is far more
important than mere vocal fluency.
Besides, the part could easily be sung
“off” by a substitute, just as Sir
HERBERT TREE is able vicariously to
perform prodigies of musical valour on
the violin, or indeed any instrument.
Hardly less interesting is the pro-
position which has been made to
Mr. HARRY HIGGINs of the Opera
Syndicate by a retired engine-driver

intimated his readiness to undertake the
principal rôle for a suitable remunera-
tion. On being informed, however, that
the hero was not an engine-driver but
a sailor, the old man expressed his
opinion of WAGNER with more vigour
than politeness.
On the other hand, Mr. HIGGINs has
favourably considered the application
of eight young ladies, who have re-
cently obtained their pilot's certificate
at Brooklands, to take part in the last
Act of Die Walküre on hippo-aero-

WE are glad to observe that the bare

Editorial comment has been received by
our Press with a universal cry of horror
and indignation. In this connection a
Society paper would like us to state
that the following passages, about to
appearin its pages as news or comments,
are the honest expression of Editorial
conviction, uttered for the good of the
reading public; and that, if it should
happen that the same issue contains
paid advertisements of the firms there
referred to, this is just one of those
strange coincidences which cannot be
accounted for.
“A CHARMING RESTAURANT.
All the world lunches and dines at

so excellent a restaurant should surely
be more widely known. I have patro-

but I can truly say that the Réclame
stands alone. Its generous proprietor,
the ever-courteous Monsieur Pousse,
provides a marvellous eighteenpenny
table d'hôte. No wonder the success
of his enterprise is colossal, and such
famous men as Lord RoseBERY, Mr.

HINTS ON SELECTING A
- IBOWLER.
THE straw hat has run its course for
1913, and if not too sunburnt and
battered for future use has retired to
winter quarters. But there is really no
close season, no “on and off" licence,
for the bowler in this country. One
should always be included in a gentle-
man's répertoire, and the choosing of it
is a serious matter not to be lightly
undertaken.
The offices of some of the firms
devoting themselves to the planning
and erection of bowlers are plain of
exterior; others are ornate and the
windows decorated with full-size models
bearing such legends as:— -
|The Lºrest. |Newest share.
| STYLISH. |
On entering the establishment you
prefer, you will probably be approached
by the Wendor or his agent, who, on
your requirements as to price and
accommodation being made known, will
at once bring forward cases containing

(very nutty this one for country week-
ends), the No-brim (to speak of), the
Skyscraper, and the One-storeyed or
Bungalow type.
If you are foolish or weak enough to
be guided by the Wendor, you will
probably leave the place wearing a sort
of pent-house that will be the butt of
your friends and acquaintances, or one
of last season's designs that did not
“get off.”
But, if you are a knowing buyer,
on seeing a likely, serviceable-looking
edifice, you will say, “Please allow me
a few moments alone with this one.”
Once by your two selves, act with
firmness and decision. After pressing
down or drawing in as well as you can
your cranial excrescences, place the hat
carefully on your head, on whatever
part you prefer to wear it, but don't be
satisfied merely because you think you
look well in it. After observing the
effect of it from every point of view,
remove the hat and inspect it carefully
from basement to roof. Turn down
the leather skirting inside and examine
the structure on which the dome is
supported. Make sure that the two

carefully the inscription on the ceiling.
Test the acoustic properties and see
that the proper means of ventilation
have been provided. Your hair will
strongly resent a stuffy, ill-ventilated
hat, and may show a desire to leave

When you have thoroughly investi-
gated the interior of the premises turn
your attention to the exterior.
Examine the ribbon decoration
running round the building just above
the balcony. This should be of the
best ribbed silk, and the bow should be
well and truly laid against the left wall,
not at the back. Note any careless
workmanship with a view to a possible
reduction in the price.
Last of all, administer a few blows to
the crown. If dust flies out you know
that the structure is old and insanitary.
Should dents or cracks appear in the
roof or walls, rejoin the Wendor at once,
mix the hat up amongst the others you
have rejected, and ask to see a few

TO AN OLD FRIEND.
MY DEAR old CHAP,-I simply can't help writing to
you... I want to tell you again how enormously I enjoyed
meeting you again this morning aſter all these years. Do
you know, I had almost forgotten your very name (your
fault, old man, for keeping yourself away from me), and
then, almost before I could think about it, there you were,
just the same clever, refined, abbreviated, sly fellow that
you used to be. That was, indeed, a meeting.
You wouldn't tell me where you had been or what had
been happening to you. Were you wise in that? I should
have sympathised, you know. I should have said to myself,
“Dear old Verb. Sap. Sat. has had bad luck. His gold mine
in South Africa has gone wrong, or they haven't been kind
to him in South America, or they wouldn't give him a job
in Uganda, and he's had to retire from the glare of the
world and live a very quiet life. But now that he's recovered
a bit and got out again we must all be good to him and try
to make it up to him a bit.” Something of that kind I
should have said, and then I should have taken you to
The Cock and given you a brace of sausages on mashed
potatoes, and we should have wandered about Fleet Street
and tried to recall some of the old scenes and the old faces
from that past in which everybody knew you and far too
many used you for their own purposes. One old man with
a fishy eye and a very shiny frock-coat did seem to recognise
you after we had parted. “There's something about that
fellow,” I heard him muttering, “that reminds me of old
ALL THE BEST PEOPLE ARE DoING IT."
ago.” I could have enlightened him, but I judged it better
to hold my tongue.
It wasn't only Fleet Street that knew you in the happy
past. Peers quoted you; solicitors mentioned you in their
letters. I have heard the Colonel of a cavalry regiment
boast of his acquaintance with you after mess, and all the
young subalterns were much impressed, declaring that the
old man knew a thing or two and it was no use trying to
get the better of him. But, of course, all that's over long
ago, and perhaps it's foolish of me to remind you of it.
By the way, I wonder if you could tell me anything about
Quis Custodiet, another old friend of ours. I saw him last
a very long time ago sitting close to a magistrate who was
sentencing a policeman for an aggravated assault on a
costermonger, but since then I've heard nothing of him.
If you ever knock up against him remember me to him.
And now farewell. We may never meet again, but I
shall often think of you.

[November 5, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ELUCIDATION.
(After the manner of the Parliamentary
Correspondent of “The Daily News.")
ALREADY the rural districts are agog.
The CHANCELLOR's great message has
come home to the highways and hedges
and roused at last from their patient
apathy the toilers of the soil. Further,
we have no doubt at all that they will
be considerably more roused when we
have had an opportunity of explaining
what it means. Let us examine the
proposals. .
It is recognised that the Minimum
Wage is the pivot. The Provision of
Cottages, in the same way, may be
said to be the lever; it would perhaps
not be inapt to describe Security of
Tenure as the driving-wheel of the new
machinery of the land. º
Dealing first with the question of a
Minimum Wage (for until the labourer
is enabled to pay an economic rent for
his cottage, a financial price for his
bacon and a commercial contribution
to his Christmas Goose Club no advance
in any direction is possible) it may be
said at once that payment in kind must
go the way of other feudal impositions.
We must have daily cash for daily toil.
Let there be no mistake about that.
Mr. LLoyd GEORGE's figures regarding
the shortage of cottages (which have
appalled the nation) next call for com-
ment. It is now freely admitted that
the State must step in with no uncertain
hand—that is, no uncertain foot. The
provision of 120,000 cottages, which is
contemplated as a first instalment,
would provide, as far as one can judge,
something like the same number of
homes. That indeed is manifest, but it
involves the purchase of land. Cottages,
it is recognised, must have something
to rest on ; they cannot be suspended,
however much the shooting tenant
might prefer that arrangement as
causing less disturbance to the ground
game. Now, it is intended to build
four cottages to the acre, so that for this
purpose the amount of land required
would be, roughly speaking, 30,000
acres. At a cost of £50 an acre this
would come to £1,500,000. Let us
suppose that the Board of Agriculture
can build at the rate of £150 for each
cottage. Very well. This means
£18,000,000, or, including the ground
to build thereon, £19,500,000. In any
case there must be no turning back.
The figures given of the increase in
the number of game-keepers (which
have staggered the community) must
next come under review. It is recog-
nised that when the pheasant and the
fox are no longer free to gorge them-
selves to repletion upon the food of the
out of employment. The problem is
best understood in conjunction with
security of tenure. A little imagination
will show that as soon as the farmer is
safe against summary eviction (a fear
which to-day casts a shadow on many
a homestead) he will be encouraged to
spend his money more freely upon the
small amenities of his house. To give
only one instance, it will be—for the
first time, mark you—well worth his
while to order large quantities of note-
paper stamped with his address. Calling
cards may even come into vogue in
some places. Then he will be able to
launch out into more expensive wall-
papers. He will no longer grudge to
measure his rooms for carpets. All
this means work. And in the great
revival of rural industry that is thus
to come the labour of the superfluous
game-keepers will soon be absorbed.
Gun-makers are also alarmed, as I
learn by personal investigation in the
proper quarter, but surely without
cause. It is the peculiar virtue of the
new proposals that every one is bound
to profit by them. We may confidently
look for a sharp revival in the gun
trade, when farmers come to arm them-
selves against the hordes of weasels and
sparrow-hawks which will appear to
prey upon their beans and clover as
soon as the game-keepers are with-
drawn. At least that is the opinion in
Fleet Street, whatever may be felt in
the rural communities.
Finally it may be asked, Where does
the landlord come in 2 He will, of course,
have to be content with less rent, less
power over his property, less game.
But with an opulent and contented
peasantry at his very gates he will be
relieved from the present odious neces-
sity of providing Christmas rabbits and
winter blankets; from all that vast
degrading traffic in tips and doles upon
which his position so largely depends.
There must be no turning back. A
new spirit is sweeping through the
villages. The Motherland is rocking
with excitement.
SHOULD RIVAL POLITICIANs
DINE TOGETHER 7
THE report of Lord WILLough BY DE
BROKE's announcement that he will not
dine with Mr. WINSTON CHURCHILL, and
of his protest against dining at all with
one's political enemies, is causing some-
thing like social revolution in our midst.
In order to meet any difficulty which
the new custom might create, it has
been suggested that the hour of dining
should become a fixed political principle,
like tariff reform or the nationalisation
of landlords or the keeping of people
proposes that Conservatives should
adopt 8 P.M. as their hour for dining,
that Liberals should dine habitually at
7 P.M., and adherents of the Labour
Party at 1 P.M. or thereabouts, and
Irish Nationalists never. . |
Yet there are family and other ties.
between people of opposite opinions.
which cannot thus be severed; and,
even if connections of this sort are not
definitely asked to dine, it will still be
felt, by such as do not see altogether
eye to eye with Lord WILLough BY DE;
BROKE in his decision, that some
courtesy should be shown to them.
To this end a new fashion in invita-
tion cards is likely to arise. Lady,
Primrose-Dame will send a card to:

But we hope it is not too late for
Lord WILLough BY DE BROKE to be

interfere with the pleasures of the table.
We beg him to reflect on the bitter
disappointment that might be caused to
many if his example should rob them
of dining occasionally with a lord.
There is, of course, the type of man who
declares that food would only choke him'
if taken in the company of a political
enemy; but he must not overlook the
fact that there is always a possibility of
his enemy, from like reasons, being:
choked. Again there is the fear that
at the dinner-table your hated opponent
might perform the significant ceremony
of helping you to salt; but this act could
always be responded to with pepper.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I may say at once that Mr. FRANCIS GRIBBLE's The
Romance of the Cambridge Colleges (MIPLs AND Boos) is
an agreeable book, and that Cambridge men will do well
to add it to their libraries. To be sure, Mr. GRIBBLE
is himself an Oxford man, but he avows the dreadful fact
with a candour that disarms criticism. And, after all,
the book speaks—I might almost say chats—for itself. I
am not sure that it would be easy to justify the word
“Romance" in the title. It seems to me not to express
quite accurately the manner in which Mr. GRIBBLE deals

came along the real man, not a better man, not a nicer
man, but just the man. So there was nothing to be done
but to follow the gleam in Julius Pole's eyes. Unhappiness
comes of it, and Angelina, always sincere and pure in heart,
makes amends. And I don't like that part of it so well as
her childhood, her early love passages, and her first letter
to St. Mary of Egypt—her later correspondence was more
self-conscious. And it was very nice to be reminded by the
“little naked baby doll of pink soap,” which papa Peachey
gave Angelina to comfort her in some childish sorrow, of a

of the strange characters who
have always abounded in Cam-
bridge and whom no Royal
Commissions and no legislative
reforms can utterly abolish or
destroy. But a string of anec-

lina's consoler once very, very
dear to my own young heart.
As a warm admirer of Mr.
MARRIOTT's work I would gladly
have opened the flood-gates and
dotes, however well told (and * Zee& wa praised Subsoil (HURST AND
Mr. GRIBBLE tells them ex- 24.4%: BLACKETT) without reserve, but
cellently and with gusto), is not
precisely equivalent to what
most of us understand by “Ro-
mance.” However, they make
pleasant reading and thus satisfy
to a large extent what must have
been the author's desire, and is
certainly that of his readers.
I commend very highly Mr.
GRIBBLE's gift of literary tact.
It is well known, for instance,
that members of St. John's
College have a nickname—at
any rate, they used to have one;
erhaps the more delicate sus-
ceptibilities of our own day have
swept it away. Still, there it
was, and Mr. GRIBBLE was
bound to mention it. He per-
forms his task with an allusive
discretion which cannot offend - -
even the most patriotic and
sensitive Johnian. Finally, I
must congratulate Mr. GRIBBLE
on having been able to escape
for a time from the narration
of the more or less scandalous
love affairs of celebrated ladies.
To these his fluent pen has
been largely devoted, and I can-

my trouble is that his book
pretends to be a romance, and
is really a very clever essay
upon painting. It deals too
much with minds and too little
with morals to be a popular
success. Nevertheless by
thoughtful people who are in-
terested in the connection be-
tween life and art it has simply
got to be read, for however
violently they may dissent from
the views expressed by Saffery,
the novelist, and Hugh Suther-
land, the painter, they must
admit that Mr. MARRIOTT is an
eloquent champion. The tale
itself suffers from the defect
that at the outset it is im-
possible not to guess the ending.
No sooner have you discovered
the author's point of view than
you know that Sutherland and
his fiancée Sylvia Bradley must
drift apart. Mr. MARRIOTT's
characters, though their conver-
sation is almost bewilderingly
instructive, are not puppets;
they are without exception
admirably drawn; all the same,

not help thinking he is better
occupied when telling anecdotes of the Cambridge colleges.
I have just met a very dear and charming girl, Angelina
Peachey, in the pleasant pages of Set to Partners (HEINE-
MANN), and I want to know why nobody ever seriously
introduced me before to her creatrix, Mrs. HENRY DUDENEY.
Angelina had a grandmother who was no better than she
ought to be, but a good deal prettier than she might have
been according to the table of chances in these matters, and
Angelina, it was prophesied, would take after her. Well,
she did and she didn't. She had learned from a delightful,
plain Irish Catholic maid how serious and big a matter
being in love was, and how it was a dreadful thing to
marry except for love.

THE WOMAN TURNS.
(Being the protest of a novelist's wife against the modern
method of regarding love as a subject for surgical or
pathological treatment.)
THERE was a time ere middle age had chided
The ardours proper to the Spring of life
(This period, roughly speaking, coincided
With our initial stage as man and wife),
When you would write of Love—its tears and
laughter,
Of lovers' quarrels cancelled by a kiss,
Of wedding chimes and then, for ever after,
- Unmitigated bliss. . .
I liked it; others may have deemed it twaddle;
Not such it seemed to my adoring eyes;
I liked to see you as the hero's model,
Myself the gushing heroine in disguise;
It pleased me, when perusing those romances,
To feel that our experience, yours and mine,
Though duly broidered with creative fancies,
Furnished the main design.
But now you follow fiction's later fashion;
You take your operator's knife and dig
Into the palpitating heart of Passion,
And vivisect it like a guinea-pig;
As one who probes the more obscure diseases
You ask yourself (his symptoms closely scanned)
Whether the patient ought to try sea-breezes
Or have his brain trepanned. -
Calmly you diagnose this heavenly miracle,
Treating it like a measle or a mump
13y methods scientific or empirical—
A patent plaster or a stomach-pump;
The wine that glows in Love's empurpled chalices,
Which once you sketched in complimentary terms,
Is now subjected to a sharp analysis
And shown to reek with germs.
No doubt your attitude's disinterested;
You gaze aloof, with speculative poise;
But women's hearts, you know, are not invested
With that detachment which the male enjoys.
Anyhow, here is matter made for furious
Thinking, and I who once, like Love, was blind,
Am taking notice now, and getting curious
About my state of mind.
At first I held the whole affair outrageous,
But now I too grow sniffy in the nose;
I find your air of Harley Street contagious,
I emulate your pathologic pose;
And, after careful inward consultation,
I apprehend that what you hint is true—
It must have been some mental abel ration
That made me marry you! .

A MODERNISED “PUNCH AND JUDY.”
I AM told that “ Punch and Judy" is losing its hold on
the Public. If so, I cannot help thinking that the fault must
lie in the drama itself. It does not treat the problem of
marriage with the insight, the psychological subtlety which
a cultured and intellectual audience expects in these days.
And its characters are all too low in the social scale to be
interesting or sympathetic to any intelligent spectator.
However, it only needs a little effort to bring it into touch
with modern requirements—and here is my little effort:-
ScFNE–The usual scrt of thing.
Judy, Lady Punch ſenters. She wears a white “peignoir”
and a boudoir cap with lace frill. Her face is of a remark-

Judy (looking straight before her). I don't know ! I
don't care / So long as it isn't Home 1 . i -
Lord J. (waqqing his head with reproof). Don't like to
hear you talkin' like that, Lady P. Sounds as if you and
poor old Punchie had had a row or somethin'—what?
Judy. He never will have a row ! That's what makes
him so absolutely unbearable ! That—and his perfectly
awful hump! --
Lord J. But I say, you know—he had that hump when
you married him. I remember noticin', when I was his best
man, how doocid round-shouldered he was gettin'!
Judy. I was so young then. I never in the least realised
what it would mean to be wedded to a hump for the whole
of my life! Oh, why, why aren't girls told more about
these things? ... -
Lord J. Dunno, I'm sure, Lady P. Still, hump or no
hump, he's a toppin' good feller, don't you know? What
I mean to say is, there's no sort of harm in him 1 :
Judy (bitterly). There's nothing worse you could say!
Lord J. Well, he seems to be comin' this way, so I'll say

AN OUT BURST.
I HAD been to the Rutland Gallery
to see the Yiddish pictures. As I went
in, an official took my stick from me
and gave me a number for it.
“Can't I keep it?” I said, for I like
its support.
He pointed to a notice saying that
the relinquishment of sticks and um-
brellas was compulsory, and I gave it
up. I suppose that the idea was that
I might be a Suffragist, and desire to
prove my fitness for exercising the
vote by pushing my ferrule through
a masterpiece. Anyway, I gave it up
without another word.
I give the able-bodied custodian six-
pence for being in the same room in
which my hat and stick repose. That
is all they do. They don't brush my
hat or do anything for me. I can't
give them nothing, much as I should
like to, but they can easily do nothing
in return. And now you flaunt this
saucer of money at me to suggest that
I should pay you. Well, I'm done
with it.”
He grew restive, as indeed he might,
but kept silent.
“Now look here,” I said, “if this

for doing nothing would not be so de-

As dusk fell, the streets about the
beleaguered building began to assume
an even more deserted appearance.
Here and there, sinister figures lurked
in the shadows or crept furtively from
one hiding place to another. Every
few moments the orange glare of a
searchlight from some neighbouring
tower swept the roadway from end to
end. . . .
Near the threatened citadel itself
silence, oppressive and ominous, pre-
vailed. The long blank wall, broken
only by a small and
| secret-looking door, over
which flickered a solitary
lamp, exposed its taci-
turn surface to the world,
jealous guardian of the
rºysteries within. But
somewhere out of sight
was unwinking watch-
fulness; behind every
loop-hole and embrasure
men stood armed and
waiting, as they had
waited night after

And now, the hour
was at hand. Silently,
out of the brooding
shadows, strange and
shrouded forms took
shape, moved, and
passed. Whispered chal-
lenges were heard, and
countersigns. One by
one the muffled figures

intervals of scrutiny,

Of Dionysus born and Deuced Rot!
Be thou presented not
Even by Edw-RD-s (GEORGE) and
FR-HM-N (Cholly);
Seek out some rustic stage
Where bumpkins still admire the
good old wheeze
And the sad valses please;
There for the ebon pit and high-
browed gods,
Who understand thy nods,
Reserve these pranks that erst were
London's rage.
But come, thou Nymph of the inept,
In Paris a Révue yelept
(By us translated a Review),
Whom Piffle, if the tale be true,
With Bosh and several children more
To undiluted Bunkum bore;
Or whether (this perhaps is right)
The soul of Bowery, taking flight,
With coy Lutetia carried on
In furnished rooms near Paddington,
| Chucked her chin, and cried, “Ar Har!”
And, linked with her by Registrar,
Bequeathed us thee, an offspring fair,
Haste thee, Honey, don't forget
Tights and teeth, a brand-new set,
Jokes in far from dubious taste,
And gowns not all too straitly laced,
Fashioned by what creators bold
The programme hath not left half-
told. .
Cast your bridge across the stalls
And weave no plot, because that palls.
Come, and loose from glittering fang
All the latest New York slang,
And, hugging closely, lead with thee
Turkey Trot and Tango Tea;
And, if these joys I rightly class,
Oh give me a perpetual pass
To love thee and to live with thee
And evermore thy patron be;
To hear the Yankee accent rise
That tears the canvas in the “flies,”
And see the girls display their charms,
Not much of wit, but legs and arms;
Whilst the coon, with lively din
And well-pied pants, comes prancing
1Il.
Then to the spicy nut-made chaff
And chunks of cinematograph,
And turns from music-halls, but worse,
And notes of unmelodious verse,
Such as, I ween, had raised the roots
Of tufted elms and scared the brutes;
And Pluto's self, if he had heard
Had changed his purpose and set free
For comfort's sake Eurydice.
These things if thou canst surely do,
Enchant me still, sublime Review.

IN A GOOD CAUSE.
LAst year Mr. Punch published an
appeal from The Children's White Cross
League on behalf of the sufferers from
the London Dock Strike. Another
appeal now reaches him from the same
quarter; and this time it is for the
starving women and children of Dublin
that Mr. Punch's readers are asked to
open their generous purses. Heventures
to recall the legend that runs beneath
his cartoon in which he asked help for
the wives and children of the London
Dock Strikers: “Come, Madam,” he
there says to Charity, “you will not
ask where the blame lies: you will
only ask how best you can help.”

[November 12, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FINANCIER.
It is nearly two years ago that I
began speculating in West African
mines. You may remember what a
stir my entry into the financial world
created; how Sir Isaac Isaacstein
went mad and shot himself; how Sir
Samuel Samuelstein went mad and
shot his typist; and how Sir Moses
Mosestein went mad and shot his type-
writer, permanently damaging the letter
“s.” There was panic in the City on
that February day in 1912 when I
bought Jaguars and set the market
rocking. . - -
I bought Jaguars partly for the rise
and partly for the thrill. In describing
my speculation to you eighteen months
ago I find that I dwelt chiefly on the
thrill part; I alleged that I wanted to
see them go up and down. It would
have been more accurate to have said
that I wanted to see them go up. It
was because I was sure they were
going up that, with the united support
of my solicitor, my stockbroker, my
land agent, my doctor, my architect
and my vicar (most of them hired for
the occasion), I bought fifty shares in
the Jaguar mine of West Africa. º.
When I bought Jaguars they were
at 1–11's. This means that— No,
on second thoughts I won't. There
was a time when, in the pride of my
new knowledge, I should have insisted
on explaining to you what it meant,
but I am getting blasé now; besides,
you probably know. It is enough that
I bought them, and bought them on
the distinct understanding from my
financial adviser that by the end of the
month they would be up to 2. In that
case I should have made rather more
than forty pounds in a few days,
simply by assembling together my
solicitor, stockbroker, land-agent, etc.,
etc., in London, and without going to
West Africa at all. A wonderful
thought. -
At the end of a month Jaguars were
steady at 11's ; and I had received
a report from the mine to the effect
that down below they were simply
hacking gold out as fast as they could
hack, and up at the top were very
busy rinsing and washing and sponging
and drying it. The next month the
situation was the same; Jaguars in
London very steady at 11's, Jaguar
diggers in West Africa very steady at
gold-digging. And at the end of the
third month I realised not only that I
was not going to have any thrills at
all, but (even worse) that I was not
going to make any money at all. I
had been deceived.
* ---
ago, I left the story of my City life.
A good deal has happened since then;
as a result of which I am once more
eagerly watching the price of Jaguars.
A month or two after I had written
about them Jaguars began to go down.
They did it (as they have done every-
thing since I have known them)
stupidly. If they had dropped in a
single night to #, I should at least
have had my thrill. I should have
suffered in a single night the loss of
some pounds, and I could have borne it
dramatically; either with the sternness
of the silent Saxon, or else with the
volubility of the volatile—I can't think
of anybody beginning with a “V.” But,
alas! Jaguars never dropped at all. They
subsided. They subsided slowly back
to 1—so slowly that you could hardly
observe them going. A week later they
were #3, which, of course, is practi-
cally the same as 1. A month after-
wards they were #3, and it is a
debatable point whether that is less or ||
more than . . Anyhow by the time
I had worked it out and discovered that
it was slightly less, they were at ; },
and one had the same trouble all over
again. At : ; I left them for a time;
and when I next read the financial
column they were at 3:, which still
seemed to be fairly near to 1. - And
even when at last, after many months,
I found them down to $ I was not
seriously alarmed, but felt that it was
due to some little local trouble (as that
the manager had fallen down the main
shaft and was preventing the gold
being shot out properly) and that, when
the obstruction had been removed,
Jaguars would go up to 1 again.
But they didn't. They continued to
subside. When they had subsided to
# I woke up. My dream of financial
glory was over. I had lost my money
and my faith in the City; well, let
them go. With an effort I washed
Jaguars out of my mind. Hence-
forward they were nothing to me.
And then, months after, Andrew
came on the scene. At lunch one day
he happened to mention that he had
been talking to his broker. -
“Do you often talk to your broker?”
I asked in admiration. It sounded so
magnificent.
“Often.”
“I haven't got a broker to talk to.
When you next chat to yours, I wish
you'd lead the conversation round to
Jaguars and see what he says.”
“Why, have you got some?”
“Yes, but they're no good.
cigarette, won't you?”
Next morning to my amazoment I
got a telegram from Andrew. “Can
get you ten shillings for Jaguars. Wire
IIave a
It was really a shock to me. When
I had asked Andrew to mention Jaguars
to his broker it was solely in the hope
of hearing some humorous City com-
ment on their futility—one of those crisp
jests for which the Stock Exchange is:
famous. I had no idea that his broker
might like to buy them from me.
I wired back: ; Sell fifty, quick.”
Next day he told me he had sold them.
“That's all right,” I said cheerfully;
“they're his. He can watch them go
up and down. . When do I get my
twenty-five pounds?” To save twenty-
five pounds from the wreck was won-
derful. . . . . . - -
“Not for a month; and of course you
don't deliver the shares till then.”
“What do you mean, “deliver the
shares'?” I asked in alarm. “I haven't
got the gold mine here; it's in Africa.
or somewhere. Must I go out and—”
“But you've got a certificate for
them.” - - - -
My heart sank.
“Have I?” I whispered.
lord, I wonder where it is.” .
I went home and looked. I looked
for two days; I searched drawers and
desks and letter-books and safes and
ice-tanks and trouser-presses — every
place in which a certificate might hide.
It was no good. I went back to
Andrew. I was calm. . .
"About these Jaguars,” I said casually.
“I don't quite understand my position.
What have I promised to do? And can
they put me in prison if I don't do it?”
“You’ve promised to sell 50 Jaguars
to a man called Stevens by the middle
of next month. That's all.”
“I see,” I said, and I went home
again.
And I suppose you see too. I've
got to sell fifty Jaguars to a man called
Stevens by the middle of next month.
Although I really have fifty fully
matured ones of my own, there's
nothing to prove it, and they are so
suspicious in the City that they will
never take my bare word. So I shall
have to buy fifty new Jaguars for this
man called Stevens—and buy them by
the middle of next month.
And this is why I am still eagerly
watching the price of Jaguars. Yester-
day they were 3. I am hoping that
by the middle of next month they will
be down to 4 again. But I find it diffi-
cult to remember sometimes which way
I want them to go. This afternoon, for
instance, when I saw they had risen to

I went out and bought some cigars on

A suggestion was thrown out the

side by side with schools for mothers,
there should be similar institutions for

pay more attention to the development
of the coming race. We are happy to
say that this project has already been

SAMUEL THE SUPERCILIOUS.
SAMUEL lives at the top of Regent
Street, close to a rather select post
office. The first call I made upon him
was at two in the morning. “Samuel,
old thing,” said I, “give us a stamp.”
It is worth while remarking that, had
Samuel been a company promoter or
a performing elephant, of neither of
whom is it reasonable to ask a postage
stamp at two in the morning, it would
still have been discourteous on his part
to throw my penny on the pavement.
As I took pains to point out to him, he
was there for the very business on
which I approached him. Stamps
were what he had to sell, and for two
pins I would take his number. I con-
cluded with the remark, possibly ill-
advised, that he was a Jack-in-uniform.
“Bent or battered coins,” said
Samuel, “will not be accepted.” I
picked my penny up and brushed it
carefully. It was an old penny, worn
with honest service, and bore the Order
of the Ship and Lighthouse. This, as
I pointed out to Samuel, was a dis-
tinction and not a disability. “When
you are old, Samuel,” I said, “I will
write things about you to the news-
escape the public eye; your unfitness
for the Civil Service shall be duly
advertised, and for the present just you
leave my pennies alone.”
It was then that a policeman passed,
so I went home and did not see Samuel
till the following night. This time I
fed him with the newest and thickest
and shiniest penny in Marylebone,
which he promptly threw in the mud.
“That settles it,” I said. “I report
you to-morrow. I should send off the
complaint now if only I could get a
stamp out of you. . . .”
“Can't you read?” asked Samuel in
a snappy tone. “The notice says plain
enough that I'm empty.”
Last Sunday night at half-past eleven
—not, I think, an unreasonable hour—
I paid Samuel my third visit. He was
not looking so bright and perky as
usual, so I determined to give him no
loophole for rudeness; and, after wish-
ing him a pleasant evening and lots of
business, I produced a painfully re-
spectable penny (late Victorian) and
handed it to him.
He bit it once, and then pushed it
back to me. “Come, come,” said I,
“you know very well there 's nothing
“That's as may be,” said Samuel
with a sickly scowl; “but there's
something the matter with me. I'm
out of order, as you might have known
if you'd troubled to look.”
So the victory at present is with
Samuel, the slot machine. And I have
yet to discover whether it is my pennies
he objects to, or myself, or if he is
merely touting for half-crowns. :
But if he is malingering (as I strongly
suspect, for all his symptoms of dis-
order) and happens to be an insured
person under the Act, let me point
out to Samuel that one of the panel
doctors for his district is a second
cousin of mine.

At the moment of writing, the weather
is not very appreciably colder, and we
therefore continue to receive accounts
of robins' nests in motor-bonnets, prim-
roses by the river's brim, and goose-
berries on Dartmoor. But the most
poignant communication we have had
is from a husband in Chiswick. “I
wrote to you last week to say that in my
garden I still have blooming violets, so
mild is the weather; now I beg to in-

of three acres is bounded on
the north by the Marquis
of Bungay, on the east by
Sir Granville Toots, on the

rounded by the best game
preserves in England.
Cabinet Ministers are
always doing their best in
my locality to diminish the
deadly game plague. The
crack of guns and the click
of cameras are heard all day
long. I make a small, but
appreciable, addition to my
income by charging way-
leaves for Tatler snap-
shotters as they rush from
one shooting party to
an other. I have spent
much money on the culti-
vation of my land. Little
patches of rye and barley
are spread all over it, and
it is encircled by a ring of
mangolds. Till this season
I have enjoyed excellent
sport. The pheasants
escaping from the battues
around me congregated on
my little haven of peace.
I assure you that when I
went shooting myself it was
necessary to carry an um-
brella to shield one from
the falling birds.
But now, alas, these
greedy game-kings have
erected fences of wire-
netting twenty feet high
around their preserves.
They have taken labourers
from the productive work of
tilling the soil and stationed them
round my borders to “hish" back any
pheasant which desires to pay me a
friendly visit. My melancholy mangolds
stand unpecked—that is good blank
verse, by the way. Base gamekeepers
taunt me over the boundary as they go
their rounds. And I have arranged my

THE LAST SMOKE.
“I HAVE made up my mind,” I said.
“Absolutely and irrevocably 2" said Francesca.
“Yes, absolutely and irrevocably.”
“I'm glad to hear that,” she said, “because sometimes,
when you've merely made up your mind, you've gone back
on it, you know.” -
“What strange language is this?" I said. “How can a
man go back on his mind? Minds do not lend themselves
to that sort of thing.” - -
“Don’t they?” she said. “I know one that gives itself.”
“Francesca,” I said, “we will not quibble any more.
I want you to realise that I have made up my mind to
give up smoking.” I paused to watch the effect of this
announcement. Nothing happened. The clock went on
ticking. The Pekinese dog continued to snore. Francesca
did not cease to sew. * -->
“I have decided to give up smoking,” I repeated.
“Well,” she said, “there's nothing in that.”
“Nothing in that?” I cried. “The whole world is in it.
Here am I, changing the entire course of my life, sacrificing
something that is very dear to me, deciding to make myself
extremely miserable, and you sit there doing a piece of
absurd plain sewing and tell me there's nothing in it. It's
| enough to make a saint selfish.”
“We won't worry about saints,” she said; “they don't
| come into the question.”
“There you go again,” I said; “you refuse to allow me
| the least little bit of credit.”
“All I wished to point out was that this is the tenth
| time to my certain knowledge that you've decided to give
up smoking.” -
“What of that?” I said. “If it's a good thing to do
you can't do it too often. And, anyhow, the other nine
| times weren't nearly so strong and determined as this one.
| This, Francesca, is the real thing.”
“And that, I suppose, is why you are at this moment
| smoking a cigarette.”
“Francesca,” I said, “you have an eagle eye. Nothing

last farewell ?” .
“I am defending the gentleman against himself," she
said.
“But the gentleman doesn't want to be defended by you.

smoking unless he smokes an absolutely final cigarette 2"
“You've done that,” she said.
“No,” I said, “it was intended to be the last, but, when
you refused to watch it, it became the last but one.”
“We'll put off the last indefinitely,” she said. .
“Well,” I said, “you can have your old work-basket
back, and you can keep my cigarette box, and I'll give up
smoking—not voluntarily, but under compulsion—under
your compulsion, remember—and whenever I feel wretched
about it and pine for a smoko and can't get it I shall put
it all down to you.” - -
“I refuse to be intimidated,” she said.
“I'm not intimidating you. I'm merely telling you
what kind of a happy home we're going to have unless you
give me back my cigarettes and allow me to give up
smoking of my own free will and in my own way."
“Take your old cigarettes,” she said; “I’m sure I don't
want them. Only don't you ever talk to me again about
the weakness of women.” -
“Francesca,” I said, “you have done a noble action.
Observe, I take one—only one—cigarette out of the box.
I close the box and push it away, for I have done with it
for ever. I now light the one cigarette—puff—puff—and
there you are. I've given up smoking at last, and I've
done it entirely for your sake—because you did want me to
give it up, didn't you? You felt I was smoking too much,
and you couldn't help trying to save me, could you ? And
now you've saved me.”
At this moment tea was announced.
“Come on,” said Francesca cheerfully, “let’s go into the
drawing-room and give up aſternoon tea for ever and ever,
absolutely and finally. It's all ready.” R. C. L.

Must 'a' gone a-hunting morts of years ago;
When the beaver whistled, when the aurochs ran,
Must 'a' been a-hunting when the world began.
For I half remember (tusk on kingly tusk)
How I've seen the mammoths moving through the dusk,
Mammoths all a-marching, terrible to see,
Through an awful oak-wood glooming ghoulishly.
Shadows huge and hairy, as the day was done,
Somehow I remember, walking one by one,
Bulls grotesque and solemn pulling boughs in halves,
Running 'neath their mothers little idiot calves.
Lumping through the oak-swamp, vast and dim and grey,
I have watched the mammoths pass at dusk of day;
Through the quaking hollow, through the tree-trunks
stark,
Gleams of mighty ivory breaking up the dark.
That's the way I dream it, that's the way I know,
Must 'a' gone a-hunting years and years ago,
For I've seen the mammoths—'tisn't you that could—
Moving like cathedrals through a dreadful wood.

THE advertisement manager of the

They entered. They were dazzling
in frock coats and tall hats, but a few
of the younger bloods wore tweeds to
show that they belonged to a new and
more flexible generation.
“What can I do for you?” the
manager asked.
“It's like this,” said the spokesman.
“It is now November. What we want
is that the public mind should be
imbued as early as possible with the
idea of the approach of Christmas.”

little uncertainly. “Not Christmas
purely as Christmas, but Christmas as
a season for the exercise of unwonted
generosity.”
“But that is the general conception
of it,” said the manager, “is it not 2"
“It may be, but we have reached
a period in the world's development
when one cannot say a thing too often
or too emphatically.”
“Yes,” said another of the younger
bloods, “what we want is the importance
of this Christmas generosity jolly well
rubbed in, don't you know?”
“Precisely,” said the spokesman.
“Now, a series of articles and reminders
from you would do wonders for us. A
paragraph here, a column there, point-
ing out that present-giving is to be
more than ever fashionable.”
“Yes,” said another of the tweed suits,
“a list of nobs seen yesterday in Bond
Street and Piccadilly, don't you know?
A word as to what Lord Lummey is
giving the Marchioness of Milkshire.
“Because,” said a fourth, “there's
nothing that bucks up the ordinary
ruck of people so much as knowing that
they're in a nutty movement. That's
what we want you to do. To keep on
hammering away for the next few weeks
at the Christmas-present rage. To
make generosity the thing. Nothing
more. It's quite easy.”
“Will you?” asked the spokesman.
“It might be done,” said the manager,
“as it's not beyond the bounds of possi-
bility. But what . . .”.”
“Our society has plenty of funds,”
said the spokesman. “We wish to put
the thing on a commercial basis.”
“Ah,” said the manager, “then I
daresay something may be done. After
all, it is a season of friendliness and
good cheer, is it not? Liberality should
be rampant then, if ever it is. Good
afternoon; good afternoon. You will
hear from me very shortly.”

possible conversation, you will know

“Exactly,” said the spokesman a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“The PURSUIT of PAMELA."
THE lady was both pursuer and pur-
sued. The hero she was after (with an
ingenuousness often found on the stage,
and in this case said to be due to
her upbringing in the back-blocks of
- America) was that pleasant waster,
Alan Greame; the villain after her was
her newly-acquired husband, John
Dodder. Pamela had not met the
elderly and repulsive Dodder for six
years before their marriage, and she
had become his wife simply to escape
from the back-blocks. However, their
wedded life was quite happy until
five minutes after the ceremony;
when, having presented her with a
cheque-book, and told her that she had
plenty of money of her own (“Bride-
groom to Bride—a cheque-book”), John
Dodder tried to kiss her. Indignantly
Pamela jumped on her horse and rode
away with the cheque-book. I suppose
(though we are not told so definitely)
she rode to the nearest bank, and I
should much have liked to be present
at the cashing of the ingenuous
Pamela's first cheque – “Pay Me
£1,000”—by the even more ingenuous
bank manager. But no matter. The
great thing was that she embarked with
a suitable wardrobe for Honolulu, and
on the boat met Alan Greame. Under
the impression that she was a widow
Alan made love to her, and under the
impression that marriage ceremonies
meant nothing (except perhaps cheque-
books), Pamela made love to him. Of
course, as soon as he heard of John
Dodder he was all remorse; and in
order not to compromise her—which
was an expression Pamela did not
understand — he escaped to Japan.
Pamela followed. Again, in her in-
genuousness, she offered herself to him;
again, determined not to take advan-
tage of it, he withstood her. They
parted for ever; she shamed and angry,
he miserable.
So far, excellent. The first two Acts
make a delightful entertainment. Mr.
C. B. FERNALD has provided Greame
with an extraordinary number of good
things to say, and no one can say them
so effectively as Mr. DENNIs EADIE,
no one respond to them so charmingly
as Miss GLADYs Cooper. Mr. FERNALD
is a man of wit; I take off my hat to
him. But in the last two Acts he
becomes more serious, and reluctantly
I put my hat on again. (I hate writing
in a hat.)
Act III. of this geographical play
finds Pamela at Hong-Kong. She
may as well go there as anywhere
else—particularly as her visit serves
to introduce us to a delightful Chinese
gentleman, Mr. Azooxia Sheko; but
it is a shock to find that Greame
is there too. You'll never guess why.
He is starting on a Polar expedition;
and in order to come on in this Act he
starts from the port to which Pamela
has fled. By this time he has thrown
his morals overboard; and, when he
accidentally comes across Pamela, he
throws the expedition overboard too,
and suggests that she should come to
Italy with him. However, Mr. FERNALD
will have to get Italy into some other
play, for Pamela refuses. Poor dear,
she only wanted a little persuasion, and
I was longing to shout to Alan, “Pick
her up in your arms, man, and carry

her out.” But the cold-blooded Pole
explorer only stood and said sternly,
“Once more, are you coming or are you
not?” No wonder she hesitated. Even
John Dodder could have wooed her
better than that.
A poor Third Act; and the Fourth
was as poor. It is three years later, and
Alan, returning from the Polar Expedi-
tion where he had been “staggering
along the sky-line with a comrade on
his back" (these details never sound
impressive in a theatre), is dying in
Canada of inanition. His pulse is only
sixty when it really ought to be
seventy. (I need hardly say that I
immediately got out my watch and, as
well as I could in the dark, tried to
time my own pulse, which, to my
horror, seemed aboutfifty-five.) Pamela,
now a widow (of course), follows him;
and there is a long scene in which,
standing behind his sick chair, she
pretends (with only an occasional dis-
guise of voice) to be his new nurse. By-
and-by she tells him who she is, and
then he jumps up and embraces her.
It is obvious that his pulse will now
get back to seventy . . . and I am
glad to say that, with the lights on, my
own got back safely to seventy-two.
It is a pity that a play which began
so well should have ended so badly.
The acting is good. Mr. DENNIs EADIE
does not make a passionate lover, but
perhaps Alan could never have been
that. In other respects he was excellent.
Miss GLADYs Cooper surprised me;
I had no idea that she could make such
a true and pathetic figure of the Hong-
Kong Pamela. She played beautifully
throughout in a long and difficult part. I
must say a word for Miss AYA YAMADA,
a charming little Japanese actress with
nothing to say and a most attractive
way of not saying it. Not quite nothing,
though, for she had learnt a little English
in the last two Acts and could make it
sound entirely delightful. Having my
hat still on I take it off again to Miss
GLADYs Cooper; and once more to
Mr. FERNALD's wit. I hope that one
day it may play round a scenario
more worthy of it. M.
A TRIER.
I'M only five foot and a bit;
My name as a flapper was “Plumpie;”
And, between you and me, I admit
My shape's still a little bit stumpy;
But oh! I've a passion
For up-to-date fashion,
And such is my craving for “chic'
That I load up my figure
With all that's de rigueur
And pass in the crowd, with a kick.
My muff makes the other girls sulk,
It's almost as big as myself;
My furs are enormous in bulk,
They stand from my chest like a shelf;
But I leave them untied
For fear they should hide
My neck, in the lowest of W’s,
Unveiled by a fichu,
And that's why (a-tishu)
I often give vent to a sneeze.
My hat covers most of my face,
I only see out of one eye;
My stockings are gossamer lace,
My heels are prodigiously high ;
My skirt clings and tapers,
Prohibiting capers
In spite of the orthodox slit;
In short, from shoe leather,
To top-gallant feather,
I'm doing my best to be It.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE is a “reading without tears,” but it is not the
reading of this book, Scott's Last Expedition, published in
two volumes by SMITH, ELDER. The first volumo gives us
the journals of Captain Scott; the second, the reports of the
journeys of other members of the Expedition. There is
courage and strength and loyalty and love shining out of the
second volume no less than out of the first; there were gallant
gentlemen who lived as well as gallant gentlemen who
died; but it is the story of Scott, told by himself, which
will give the book a place among the great books of the
world. That story begins in November, 1910, and ends on
March 29, 1912; and it is because, when you come to the
end, you will have lived with Scott for sixteen months,
that you will not be able to read the last pages without
tears. That Message to the Public. was heart-rending
enough when it first came to us, but it was as the story of
how a great hero fell that we read it; now it is just the
tale of how a dear friend died. To have read this book
is to have known Scott; and, if I were asked to describe
him, I think I should use some such words as those
which, six months before he died, he used of the gallant
gentleman who went with him, “BILL" Wilson. “Words
must always fail me when I talk of him,” he wrote ;
“I believe he really is the finest character I ever met—
the closer one gets to him the more there is to admire.
Every quality is so solid and dependable. Whatever the

WILsoN, if Scott says so, for he knew men; but most of it
is also true of Scott himself. I have never met a more
beautiful character than that which is revealed unconsci-
ously in these journals. His humanity, his courage, his
faith, his steadfastness, above all, his simplicity, mark him
as a man among men. It is because of his simplicity that
his last message, the last entries in his diary, his last
letters, are of such undying beauty. The letter of consola-
tion (and almost of apology) which, on the verge of death,
he wrote to Mrs. Wilson, wife of the man dying at his
side, may well be Scott's monument. He could have no
finer. And he has raised a monument to those other gallant
gentlemen who died—WILSON, OATES, BowFRs, PvaNs.
They are all drawn for us clearly by him in these pages;
they stand out unmistakably. They too come to be friends
of ours, their death is as noble and as heart-breaking.
And there were gallant gentlemen, I said, who lived—you
may read amazing stories of them. Indeed, it is a wonderful
tale of manliness that these two volumes tell us. I put
them down now ; but I have been for a few days in the
company of the brave . . . and every hour with them has
made me more proud for those who died and more humble
for myself.
Few readers of Punch should at this date require an
introduction to Mr. ANTHoNY DEANE, but if such there be
I have here a volume of little papers brought together

These shrewd appreciations so accurately and fully describe
the personages named that his two portly volumes—Lord

seem almost superfluous. Nevertheless the reader endowed
with leisure will find himself well rewarded by devoting it
to a close study of them. Steeped in knowledge of the
Georgian epoch, Mr. LUCAS has produced a work that will
have permanent value among English histories. If a fault
may be hinted at, it is that so full is his wallet of biographical
and critical scraps that he is inclined to be too generous in
distributing them.

and Agatha, the beloved of Daniel. Upon Number One

Three, with a horsewhip if necessary, as to his intentions
before undertaking the burden of his sins and giving the

shows that pressure would probably have induced him to
do the proper thing; and you may be sure that Polly would
have been happiel with a brute, who had at least wronged

“THE LOVE LETTERS OF
A DUCHESS.”
AMAZING SELF-REVELATIONs.
By the courtesy of the Editor of The
Tinglish Review we are enabled to
present our readers with a few choice
extracts from the next instalment of
the Love Letters of the Duchess of
Bilgewater now appearing in that fear-
less and exuberant periodical. It is
the boast of the Editor that every
article in his Review is true to its name
—that it makes the reader “tingle with
ecstatic spirituality.” How nobly he
fulfils this vaunt may be gathered from
the subjoined extracts. We would gladly
quote the entire instalment, did not the
laws of copyright forbid. It should be
explained that the Duchess of Bilge-
water is the nom de guerre of a beautiful
lady who has recently been sojourning
in Egypt with her husband, and that
the letters are addressed to a famous
politician, detained in London by his
Parliamentary duties, whose arrival she
is shortly expecting. -

“I am sitting, Beloved, in the pergola
of the Pandemonium Hotel in my
thinnest X-ray mainsook clothes, writ-
ing in our love book for you, gazing on
the Pyramid of CHEoPs, the poinsettias
and the bougainvilleas, while you, poor
dearest, are toiling for your Party at
by-elections, growing more grey and
haggard with each speech. . . . --Some-
times you assume an entirely boyish
aspect, but when you are tired your
face becomes strangely dimmed, and
your raven hair seems silvered all over
instead of only faintly touched with grey
—a touch that perhaps contributes to
the extreme distinction of your appear-
ance and enhances your resemblancé
to GEORGE ALEXANDER. . . But, to
return to flowers, the Lilium auratum
is to me the most enthralling of all
things that grow. Its scent is the
most passionate thing I know, except
the curve of your lips and your proud
petulant nostrils. (You must come!)"

“HichENs—you remember our going

all genuine philanthropic effort evokes.
The man who can make two smiles
grow where one grew before is rightly
entitled to be regarded as a public
benefactor, and to label my cousin
may occur to individual tastes. The
cruel hoax is taboo, and the vulgar
practical joke is actively discouraged.
Any member, for instance, who balances
a wet sponge above his hostess's bed-

We could see our victim vainly racking
his brains to try to remember who on
earth the strange couple could be who
seemed to know him so well, whom he
did not recollect ever having previously
laid eyes on. He must finally have
come to the conclusion that he had
probably made our acquaintance on
board ship or in some Swiss hotel, and
that his memory had played him false,
for by the time he was within ten
yards of us he had made up his mind
to do what was apparently expected
be safely asserted that in the
course of a brief and appar-
ently otiose existence Cousin
George has done more than
most of his contemporaries
to augment the sum of human
happiness. As the result of
his persistent labours, light
and laughter have invaded
many of the earth's darkest
and most desolate places,
while innumerable lost and
broken souls have found fresh
comfort and courage in the
contemplation of his face-
tious activities.
It is now some ten years
since George was inspired
with the brilliant notion of
forming what he called a
Society for the Promotion of
Human Gaiety, and it would
be no idle boast to claim that
during the whole of this
happy decade the Society has
fully earned the title so felicit-
ously conferred upon it by
my cousin at its inception.
Like all successful institu-
tions the S.P.H.G. (to give it
its popular name) is con-
trolled by a small and select
committee, of which I am
the Managing . Secretary,
while my cousin is the Vice-
President, and to his aged 1 - -
mother have been entrusted the duties George and I have always regarded
of Honorary Treasurer. The fact that publicity as an essential concomitant of
Mrs. Biffin is partially blind and success, and in the crowded street we

of him, and his face lit up
with a polite but somewhat
nervous grin of recognition.
This was, of course, the
signal for George and me to
assume a look of frigid hos-
tility, and, glaring ferociously
at the unfortunate man, as
though indignant at his im-
pertinence, we passed him
coldly by. It was pathetic to
watch our victim's genial
|smile freeze upon his lips;
and, when he looked round |
and saw us smiling at some-

seemed inclined to kick him-

this process with different

the while with the conscious-
ness that we were supplying
our various victims with
stories to tell to their wives
when they reached home, and

colour into many an other-

A strong gale was blowing
round the base of Nelson's
Column, and, as we stationed
ourselves at the breeziest
corner of the plinth, my
cousin and I foresaw that we should
not have long to wait before carrying
out the second part of our morning's
programme. In less than ten minutes
a particularly violent gust of wind swept
down the square and, as we had hoped,
lifted the hat from an old gentleman's
head and bore it gracefully away to-
wards Charing Cross. Before its owner
had time to start in pursuit I was at his
elbow and had placed a delaying hand
upon his shoulder.

while the truant hat careered madly
across the path of approaching omni-

DEAR SIR,-On behalf of his Grace
the Duke of Swankington we beg to
remind you that the lease under the
terms of which you occupy premises
in Swank Street, W., granted by us
twenty-one years ago, will expire on
September 29th next, and we have to
state that we shall be happy to renew
it on the following very reasonable
terms, viz.:
The rent to be increased by £1,200
per annum.
As you are aware, the value of the
premises has greatly appreciated since
your occupancy. The new stone face
which you have added is an improve-
ment which alone justifies us in asking
this small additional sum in rent. Your
installation of a modernised electric
lighting system has also added so much
to the value of the premises that we are
not satisfied that we are doing ourselves
justice in the matter. Still, as you are
an old tenant, we should wish to treat
you as generously as possible.
Yours faithfully,
Mr. John Smith to the Swankington
Estate Office.
DEAR SIRs, I have received your
letter and I'm going to tell LLoyd
GEORGE. Yours faithfully,
J. SMITH. .

SIR,-We beg respectfully to acknow-
ledge your letter, and sincerely apologise
to you if anything we said therein gave
you cause for anxiety. Having care-
fully reconsidered your case, we have
decided not only to remit the proposed
increase but to reduce your rent by
one-half. Hoping to learn that you
are not proceeding to take the extreme
step indicated in your letter, we beg to
remain, Sir, Yours respectfully,

[NovKMBER 19, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A BREATH OF LIFE.
This is the story of a comedy which
nearly became a tragedy. In its way
it is rather a pathetic story. -
The comedy was called The Wooing
of Winifred. It was written by an
author whose name I forget; produced
by the well-known and (as his press-
agent has often told us) popular actor-
manager, Mr. Levinski; and played by
(among others) that very charming
young man, Prosper Vane – known
locally as Alfred Briggs until he took
to the stage. Prosper played the
young hero, Dick Seaton, who was
actually wooing Winifred. Mr. Levin-
ski himself took the part of a middle-
aged man of the world with a slight
cmhonpoint; down in the programme as
Sir Geoffrey Throssell, but fortunately
still Mr. Levinski. His opening words,
as he came on, were, “Ah, Dick, I have
a note for you somewhere,” which gave
the audience an interval in which to
welcome him, while he felt in all his
pockets for the letter.
quite easily while feeling in one's
pockets, and it is much more natural
than stopping in the middle of an
important speech in order to acknow-
ledge any cheers. The realisation of
this, by a dramatist, is what is called
“stagecraft.” In this case the audience
could tell at once that the “technique”
of the author (whose name unfortun-
ately I forget) was going to be all right.
But perhaps I had better describe
| the whole play as shortly as possible.
The theme—as one guessed from the
title, even before the curtain rose—was
the wooing of Winifred. In the First
Act Dick, proposed to Winifred and
was refused by her, not from lack of
love, but for fear lest she might spoil
his career, he being one of those big-
hearted men with a hip-pocket to
whom the open spaces of the world
call loudly; whereupon Mr. Levinski
took Winifred on one side and told the
audience how, when he had been a
young man, some good woman had
refused him for a similar reason
and had been miserable ever since.
Accordingly in the Second Act Winifred
withdrew her refusal and offered to
marry Dick, who declined to take
advantage of her offer for fear that she
was willing to marry him from pity
rather than from love; whereupon Mr.
Levinski took Dick on one side and
told the audience how, when he had
been a young man, he had refused to
marry some good woman (a different
one) for a similar reason, and had
been broken-hearted ever afterwards.
In the Third Act it really seemed as
though they were coming together at
One can bow.
Mr. Levinski took them both aside and
told the audience a parable about
a butterfly and a snap-dragon, which
was both pretty and helpful, and caused
several middle-aged ladies in the first
and second rows of the upper circle to
say, “What a nice man Mr. Levinski
must be at home, dear!”—the purport
of the allegory being to show that both
Dick and Winifred were being very
silly, as indeed by this time everybody
but the author was aware. Unfor-
tunately at that moment a footman
entered with a telegram for Miss Wini-
fred, which announced that she had
been left fifty thousand pounds by a
dead uncle in Australia; and, although
Mr. Levinski seized this fresh oppor-
tunity to tell the audience how in
similar circumstances Pride, to his
lasting remorse, had kept him and some
good woman (a third one) apart, never-
theless Dick held back once more, for
fear lest he should be thought to be
marrying her for her money. The
curtain comes down as he says, “Good
bye . . . Good ber—eye.” But there
is a Fourth Act, and in the Fourth
Act Mr. Levinski has a splendid
time. He tells the audience two para-
bles—one about a dahlia and a sheep,
which I couldn't quite follow—and
three reminiscences of life in India;
he brings together finally and for ever
these hesitating lovers; and, best of all,
he has a magnificent love-scene of his
own with a pretty widow, in which we
see, for the first time in the play, how
love should really be made—not boy-
and - girl pretty - pretty love, but the
deep emotion felt (and with occasional
lapses of memory explained) by a
middle-aged man with a slight embon-
point who has knocked about the
world a bit and knows life. Mr.
Levinski, I need not say, was at his
best in this Act.
I met Prosper Vane at the club some
ten days before the first night, and
asked him how rehearsals were going.
“Oh, all right,” he said. “But it's
a rotten play. I've got such a dashed
silly part.” -
“From what you told me,” I said,
“it sounded rather good.”
“It's so dashed unnatural. For
three whole Acts this girl and I are in
love with each other, and we know
we're in love with each other, and yet
we simply fool about. She's a dashed
pretty girl, too, my boy. In real life
I'd jolly soon * >

“you're not going to fall in love with

good advertisement. Anyway, it's a
silly part, and I’m fed up with it.”
“Yes, but do be reasonable. If Dick
got engaged at once to Winifred what
would happen to Levinski? IIe 'd
have nothing to do.” -
Prosper Vane grunted. As he seemed
disinclined for further conversation I
left him.
:: × : : :
The opening night came, and the
usual distinguished and fashionable
audience (including myself), such as
habitually attends Mr. Levinski's first
nights, settled down to enjoy itself.
Two Acts went well. At the end of
each Mr. Levinski came before the
curtain and bowed to us, and we had
the honour of clapping him loud and
long. Then the Third Act began. . . .
Now this is how the Third Act ends—

the stage . . . and after a little natural
hesitation the curtain came down.
Behind the scenes all was conster-
nation. Mr. Levinski (absolutely furi-
ous) had a hasty consultation with the
author (also furious), in the course of
which they both saw that the Fourth
Act as written was now an impossi-
bility. Poor Prosper, who had almost
immediately recovered his sanity, trem-
blingly suggested that Mr. Levinski
should announce that, owing to the
sudden illness of Mr. Vane, the Fourth
Act could not be given. Mr. Levinski
was kind enough to consider this
suggestion not entirely stupid; his own
idea having been (very regretfully) to
leave out the two parables and three
reminiscences from India and concen-
trate on the love-scene with the widow.
“Yes, yes,” he said. “Your plan is
better. I will say you are ill. It is
true; you are mad. To-morrow we
will play it as it was written.”
“You can't,” said the author gloomily.
“The critics won't come till the Fourth
Act, and they'll assume that the Third
Act ended as it, did to-night. The
Fourth Act will seem all nonsense to
them.” -
“True. And I was so good, so much
myself, in that Act.” He turned to
“Or there's another way,” began the
author. “We might—”
And then a gentleman in the gallery
settled it from the front of the curtain.
There was nothing in the programme
to show that the play was in four Acts.
“The Time is the present-day and the
Scene is in Sir Geoffrey Throssell's
town-house,” was all it said. And the
gentleman in the gallery, thinking it
was all over, and being pleased with
the play and particularly with the
realism of the last moment of it,
shouted “Author!” And suddenly every-
body else cried “Author / Author "
The play was ended.
I said that this was the story of a
comedy which nearly became a tragedy.
But it turned out to be no tragedy at
all. In the three Acts to which Prosper
Vane had condemned it the play
appealed to both critics and public;
for the Fourth Act (as he recognised
so clearly) was unnecessary, and would
have spoilt the balance of it entirely.
Best of all, the shortening of the play
demanded that some entertainment
should be provided in front of it, and
this enabled Mr. Levinski to introduce
to the public Professor Wollabollacolla
and Princess Collabollawolla, the fam-
ous exponents of the Bongo-Bongo,
dance which was soon to be the rage
of society. But though, as a result,
the takings of the Box Office surpassed
all Mr. Levinski's previous records, our
friend Prosper Vane received no prac-
tical acknowledgment of his services.
He had to be content with the hand
and heart of the lady who played
Winifred, and the fact that Mr. Levinski
was good enough to attend the wedding.
There was, in fact, a photograph in all
the papers of Mr. Levinski doing it.

FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.
THE Ape and I wrote the whole of the
first number ourselves, but after that
we used to take outside contributions,
only of course we made chaps pay to
get their things into the paper, except
advertisements. We found we had to
pay for them or we shouldn't have got
any, and a paper looks rotten without
advertisements. It was called Bilge,
and it came out whenever we had
enough money to pay the printer.
Later on we got old Clarke—he's the
Fourth Form master and he really was
pretty decent about it—to guarantee the
thing up to ten bob, and then we could
go to press on the off-chance of selling
enough copies to make up the amount.
The Ape invented a splendid motto
that was always put at the top of the
front sheet : “What the Lower School
thinks to-day the Sixth will think
to-morrow.” . ... . "
He always put in a good deal of news,
of course. When the Under Fifteen
team played the Lunatic Asylum he
had an account running to at least two
columns; and then he used to put a
rotten little paragraph in a corner
called “Other Matches,” just giving
the scores of the First and Second. Of
course that made them rather mad.
we got so much of it that we put up
our prices; but I am not sure that we
got the best stuff in that way, because,
as I pointed out to the Ape, the chaps
that have the most money aren't always
the best poets. It doesn't follow, I
linean. - --
But the chief object of the paper wa
to show up abuses, which the Ape says
is the highest mission of the Press.
One of the Ape's best ideas was his
series of Character Studies of the
Prefects. They used to make it sell like
hot cakes sometimes. He called them
“The Man of the Week,” and they were
supposed to be interviews. "They were
frightfully clever and sarcastic, but the
Ape is an extraordinarily brainy chap.
After a time the prefects hardly dared
to touch him, because if one of them
licked him he used to put in little
snipey paragraphs about his batting
average or his voice (if he was in the
choir) or the colour of his hair. And
then he often got licked again for
cheek. - -
Of course the whole thing was sup-
pressed at last. That's the worst of
this place. They can't stand hearing
the truth. The Ape had started a new
column called “Things they do better
in Other Schools.” Of course he didn't
know anything about other schools, but

always using “impute”), “but it is a
coincidence that the whole of the funds
of this newspaper, amounting at the
time to 3s. 5d., should have disappeared
on the same day on which Mr. Binks,
our late Third Form master, sailed for
America.”
That finished it. The Ape will have
to try to think of something else.
From a Baboo letter received from
an applicant who was selected for the

THE HAT-HUNTER.
DEAR MR. EDItoR,--I know you
iunch. These facts do not escape me.
I have even imagined your doing it to
rhyme and bringing the matter to a
logical conclusion by amplifying your
name into Mr. Puncheon, I also know
that you do it sometimes at the Inner
Temple Hall, and have actually seen
you informing a bored and apathetic
clerk at the pay desk what you have
eaten (this between you and him, in
with his hat on, But some casual
person, noting the fact, chaffed him
about it. “Hallo,"old man! are things

is very sensitive. The bare suspicion
of his deliberately keeping his hat on
to identify himself with the brisker
practices and to suggest the inference
that he could only just snatch time for
lunch and none for removing hats, was
repugnant to him. He gave up trying
to avoid the problem and returned to

seen to it when he came in that both |
were together. -
The other day he nearly had an acci-
dent. He informed Baxter, just before
the decisive moment, that he was de-
pending on him, for Baxter can, he
says, always find his own hat on the
unconscious impulse of the moment.
But the responsibility of having to find
two hats unmanned even Baxter, and
as the two stood or fell together there
must have been a double disaster but
for a bit of luck. “Ah "

Templars who arrive in
hats and remove them for
luncheon purposes place
them on a side table, unless
they are lucky enough to
secure one of the few pegs.
Among these said Templars
are, as often as not, myself
and my friend Carr.

said Carr to the also hatless
and now nervous Baxter,
“that 's mine; I can tell it
by the ribbon; ” and he
grabbed at a hat which,
though it turned out to be
Baxter's, nevertheless put
him on the line of his own.
To-day Baxter told us
about it at lunch, and placed
Carr in another difficulty.
He was at the moment
relying on me; but to get
up from the table with me
now might be to make me
aware of my responsibility
and possibly lead to my
bungling the affair. So he
lay low and let me go out
alone. Then, having closely
watched my movements, he
followed me, hoping for the
best. Alas, it was a mis-
placed hope.
I am told that the sight
of him walking helplessly
up and down twenty feet
of top-hats (four or six deep)
was melancholy in the ex-
treme. It must also, to
those hat-owners who did
not know the scrupulous
and conscientious nature of
Carr, have given ground for
considerable anxiety. At
any rate, I met him later,
moving across King's Bench
him in conversation on this very sub-
ject of hats and he became so engrossed
in describing his method of identifica-
tion that he forgot to carry it out. It
was only by thinking backwards, by
past meal and looking inside every hat
that could possibly be said to be
opposite that site, that he ever found
it again. . .
That event alarmed Carr. He posi-
tively refused for a while to speak to
any of us between the doffing and the
donning of his hat.

CONCERNING PHEASANTS.
THERE is not going to be anything about mangel-wurzels
in these notes, though there will be remarks about other
matters which do not, at first sight, seem to concern
pheasants. Leaves, for instance. Everybody who goes
out to shoot pheasants must be prepared with his little bit
of leaf-lore. This is approximately how it goes:–
1st Gun. It's quite extraordinary how the leaves hang
on this year. Standing in covert you can't see the birds
till they're right on top of you.
2nd Gun. It's the same all over the country. I was
shooting in Blankshire the day before yesterday and there
was hardly a leaf off any of the trees.
1st Gun. It's these mild autumns that do the mischief.
What we want is two or three nights of sharp frost and a
gale of wind on the top of that.
2nd Gun. The weather isn't what it used to be.
1st Gun. No, you're right there.
So much for leaves. Next let us take the subject of
luncheon. It is, I think, reasonably accurate to say that at
1.15 the thoughts of all the guns begin to turn irresistibly
to the question of luncheon. Are we going to lunch after
this beat, or is there—deadly notion—to be another beat
before we are allowed to devote ourselves to eating? The
keeper always wants just one more beat. The sportsmen
always want to eat. A good luncheon puts even the worst
shot on easy terms with himself. But what is a good
luncheon? I answer without hesitation: Irish-stew is a good
luncheon; so is hot-pot; so is beef-steak pudding or pie. A
really good lunch must show a lot of steam, and the potatoes,
whether peeled or in their jackets, must be large. Cold
ham or tongue may come in as a second course, but the
backbone of the luncheon must be hot—hot and steaming.
And there should be tartlets (preferably with jam in them)
to finish up with. It is hardly credible how much elderly
sportsmen—I do not call them old, for in these days we
must call no man old until he is dead—how much they
relish jam tartlets. Battered men of the world, who might
be supposed to have out-grown the delights of their boy-
hood, may be seen munching jam tartlets with evident
satisfaction at any shooting-luncheon. By way of these
sweets they return to a pristine simplicity of taste, and may
be heard, while their mouths are clogged with strawberry
jam, telling innocent little anecdotes about shooting-boots
or gaiters, or the man who killed a rabbit and a woodcock
with the same shot, or the special malignity of the
| pheasants in deciding to swerve instead of flying straight
and giving an honest jam-eating gun a fair chance. Swerve
in pheasants is an inexhaustible topic.
Another by-product of a shooting-luncheon (when it
takes place in the keeper's cottage) is the discussion of the
keeper's artistic taste. They all love to decorate their walls
with cheap German coloured prints. Imagine a picture of
a ferociously black-bearded and be-whiskered gentleman
dandling on his knee a fair-haired, blue-eyed child in a
sailor suit. In another the same or a similar gentleman is
teaching the child his letters. The first picture is called
“His Moter's Eyes” (the letter “h” coming after “t" is
Teutonically neglected) and is intended to show that Black-
| beard once had a beloved and blue-eyed wife for whom he
| is now in mourning. The second picture is, perhaps,
entitled “In the Moter's Place" and indicates the same
domestic tragedy. Now in real life, if the keeper chanced
to meet Blackbeard, he would call him “a poor furriner,”
and despise him accordingly. Meeting him, however,
through the medium of art, he is affected to the very depth
of his honest velveteen soul, and learns lessons of hope and
consolation from the dreadful prints.
A GENTLEMAN OF THE HOUSE-TOP.
THE light beneath the bushel was never popular with
the disseminators of literature, but we have had to wait
many years for such a desperate signed appeal as the pub-
lisher of a certain new work of sentiment has just put forth.
It runs thus, except that the blanks represent the name of
the book, and the name of the favour-asker is at the end:—
“A REQUEST.
is a book with a spell, and it has an appeal
so tender that it is difficult to read it without tears.
Yet there is laughter in its pages, and to the
despondent it contains a great lesson on the little-
ness of losing courage. -
radiates a nobility of spirit which seems all
too rare to-day, and I hope that everyone who likes
to spread the news that a good book has come into
the world of literature will help me to make it
known.”
Since few persons, not even the devisers of revues, are
more imitative than advertising publishers, we now know
what to expect. Something like this, for certain:-
THIS CONCERNS YOU IDEEPLY.
DEAR FRIEND,--I want you to know that I have
just finished reading a book called , and I cannot
rest until you and in fact all the world have read it too.
It is nothing to me that I am also its publisher and
shall not do badly out of it if it succeeds. The sole
reason that I want you to read it is that it is a pure
and tender evangel of joy, and it will make you feel
better. Also it will here and there make you roar
with laughter, just as this advertisement could never
do. Yours in all good will, NASHILEIGH Eve.
That is the fairly thorough style which we may count on
very shortly seeing. But there is something more snappy
also to be done with a new book that has to be got down
the public's throat at any cost. Thus:—
HERE, You !
There 's only one book worth reading at this
moment and it is called Now then 2
NEvelEIGH Ash.
Finally there is the really unctuous:–
HEART TO HEART.
My brethren, do you want to read the most ex-
quisite and intimate story in the world? Do you
want to weep and smile by turns and feel as though
you were the darling of the gods, and the heir of the
ages, and the pick of the basket, and the leader of the
modern Athens all at once 2 Because if you do
I have the very thing for you. It is called ; and
I implore you to sing its praises near and far, talk
about it at dinner, ask for it at every bookshop and
bookstall, and generally make it boom, as I too am
endeavouring to do. What does The Short Cham of
Literature say about it in his Littery Letter? He
says that the author “has, if I am not mistaken, pro-
duced an undying classic.” And how can The Short
Cham be mistaken 2 So I beseech you to let the
book do you good, make you feel all nice inside, and
force you to force it on others. AsHILEIGH NEve.

They saw that the banisters trembled,

He bought (on my recommendation)
This house without their approbation.

AT THE PLAY.
“MAGIC.”
You can do almost anything with
fairies, but the difficulty is to find
anything to do which hasn't been done
before. Yet here is Mr. CHESTERTON,
in a trial enterprise on the stage, bring-
ing the freshness of his own immortal
childhood to Sir JAMEs BARRIE’s well-
exploited field, and treating it as virgin
soil. And his sanguine faith in the
inexhaustibility of its treasures has
been justified. Perhaps the most
charming feature of a delightful enter-
tainment was the author's little speech
at the end. With a modesty unusual
in dramatic circles, Mr. CHESTERTON
disclaimed all merit as a maker of
words. His play he regarded as an
amateur piece of work; he had no gift,
he said, for composition, whether done
for the columns of a paper or for the
back of a postcard; but he did pride
himself upon his opinions, and of these
he was anxious for us to approve.
But with the best desire in the world
to oblige him, it was impossible for us
to determine which his own opinions
were among the variety to which his
characters gave vent. On the question
of miracle and magic we were given
choice of some half-a-dozen attitudes,
including the clerical-orthodox, the
blasphemously sceptical, the calmly
scientific, the innocently credulous, the
devilishly supernatural; and the only
solid satisfaction to be got out of this
medley of opinions (I speak for us
other common people, and not for Sir
OLIVER Lodge, who sat there in his
stall, towering above us, body and spirit)
came from the exponent of No. 5, who
concluded that it was better to marry a
concrete girl than to go on debating
about the impalpable. Even this was
not completely satisfactory, for it
meant the shattering of our faith in
the credulous maiden who used to
take her Irish temperament out into
the Park after dark and talk with the
spirit-folk. For it turned out that the
largest of the fairies with whom she
had consorted (returning from this
communion with the rapt face of a
mystic) was not a real fairy, and that
she had recognised him, all the time,
for a man.
He is, in fact, no other than the con-
jurer (known as The Stranger) whom the
girl's uncle (a duke) has commissioned
to perform before the household and
“brighten things up.” But he is no
ordinary conjurer, for in the course of
learning the tricks of his trade he has
caught a few germs of the Black Art
and can do the most uncanny feats.
The girl's young brother, fresh from a
where he has shed his faiths and illusions
and become clever enough to tell you,
very blatantly, how everything is done,
permits himself to behave towards the
conjurer in a most contumelious manner.
In revenge this Master of Magic ex-
hibits his Black Art, and one of his per-
formances—the turning of the colour
of a doctor's lamp, half a mile away,
from red to blue—is so inexplicable that
the boy's intellect becomes unhinged.
Nothing can save him except to learn
how it was done. So the conjurer in-
vents, for his private ear, a natural
cause for what was really the result of
devilment, and so the sceptic is restored
to sanity. Probably he was told that
this changing of light upon a little disc
at the back of the scenery had been
arranged in collusion with the property-
man. Certainly that was my own un-
aided interpretation of the mystery.
Indeed, Mr. CHESTERTON's apparatus
was quite simple and, though he may
speak with disparagement of his play
as the work of an amatcur, there was
true professional art in the way in
which, without ever doing anything
very magical, he kept his audience
thrilled with the sense that there was
magic in the atmosphere, and that
something thrilling might happen at
any moment. Here he was greatly
assisted by Mr. FRANKLIN DYALL, who
played The Stranger, and even in the
thickest of the argument never lost his
air of inscrutability. Mr. DYALL does
nothing without thought, and I can only
suppose that so intelligent an actor
remains rather stagey in his manner
for good reasons of his own.
The old gentleman who lent his house
and grounds for the purposes of the play
was described as The Duke. I do not
think this was because, like WELLING-
ToN, he overtopped all other contem-
porary dukes, for he was the most
improbable of Graces. I can only
suppose that Mr. CHESTERTON must
have made him a duke simply because
strawberry-leaves, like wurzels, are in
the air just now. Mr. FRED LEwis,
with his jolly rotundity, did not make
him any less improbable, but he got
great ſun for us out of the Duke's in-
consequent association of ideas and his
habit of giving the same pecuniary
support to the Pros and Antis of every
social movement.
The part of Dr. Grimthorpe fitted
that irreproachable actor, Mr. WILLIAM
FARREN, as close as his own skin. As
the Rev. Cyril Smith, Mr. O.P.HEGGIE's
rather wooden and unemotional style,
with its suspicion of provincialism, gave
perhaps a stronger force to his argu-
ments than if they had been coloured
by gifts of refinement or fanaticism.
done better justice to the lesson he
delivered from the Book of Job as an
example of a magic more irrecoverable
than the greatest of Biblical miracles.
Of the younger people Mr. Lyon EL
WATTs, though he was not quite the
“little, little boy” of his description in
the play, still seemed rather too juvenile
for so fluent a command of blasphemy;
and Miss GRACE CROFT, as his sister,
did very little beyond looking intense
and taking herself and Mr. CHESTERTON
very seriously—except in a certain
passage to which I shall refer in a
moment.
I think, by the way, that the little
“Prelude" scene, with the gentleman-
fairy talking spells in the moonlight,
and the young girl hanging upon his
unearthly wisdom, might well be
omitted. The meagre information here
given to us, chiefly touching the popular
error as to the size of fairies, did not
quite compensate for the long, long
wait in darkness while the scene-shifters
put up the Duke's interior. And, after
all, we might have guessed that, for this
night at least, the little people would
be as large as life or larger; for is not
Mr. CHESTERTON also among the
fairies 2
The audience on the first night
seemed chiefly made up of superior
people, concerned to show themselves
connoisseurs of the Chestertonian man-
ner. They laughed swiftly and know-
ingly when Mr. SHAw's name occurred.
I hope I laughed in some of the right
places, but I might easily have laughed
once in a wrong one and so shocked my
reverent neighbours. It was where the
girl Patricia comes to the conjurer, in an
agony of apprehension, to implore him
to reveal the way in which he had done
his lamp-trick; otherwise her brother
was bound to go stark mad. “Instead
of which " the conjurer proceeds to
make love to her, and she to respond
playfully. In her light-hearted oblivion
she prattles of domestic prospects-
how, as his wife, she will darn his hat
and cook his goldfish for dinner—and
even goes so far as to make an old joke
about poached rabbits. This joke, of
course, was not the funny part. The
funny part (undesigned) was the fact
that the girl, in a spasm of self-interest,
had totally mislaid her mission; had for-
gotten that, all the time while she was
getting engaged and making littlejests,
there was her brother (we had heard
his groans whenever the door opened)
writhing on a bed of incipientimbecility,
I have just refreshed my memory of
this remarkable passage by reference
to the published version of the play;
It improves on closer acquaintance, and

It is strange, after so long an interval, to be shown once
again the cruel and grotesque beauties of Mr. HARDy's
world. In this collection of stories, A Changed Man
(MACMILLAN), I have received the impression of life
isolated and remote, sometimes sharply unreal, sometimes
almost naively arranged for unhappiness, always arresting
and provocative—that world that was, it seemed, finally
closed with the tragic history of Jude the Obscure. The
life that Mr. HARDY reveals has in it some of the unsuspi-
cious credulity of a child. There are here old wives' tales
about dukes and corpses, graves at the cross-roads, fair and
unfaithful wives, that have about them a strangely simple
trust and confidence. By kitchen fires on Egdon Heath
such tales have for many years been told, and the grand
reality of rocks and moor beyond the lighted windows gives
the Duke and Alicia and the Dairymaid a spectral contrast
that causes the narrator, in the full flood of his story, to fling
a glance over his shoulder. “The Grave by the Handpost,”
“What the Shepherd Saw,” “The Duke's Reappearance,”
betray this same glance. On Egdon, by night or day,
anything may occur, and here, in these pages, wild desolation
and primitive history have their overwhelming effect. It
is finally the simplicity that remains; and, as always in
Mr. HARDy's world, it is a simplicity that is huge and
tragic but never artificial nor self-conscious. These tales
were there before Mr. HARDy, and they of themselves chose
him as their interpreter to the world; and very wise they
Were.
It is not often that the public-school novel (as opposed
to the school story) has an original central idea. As a rule
the author is content to take a small boy without any
particular characteristics to distinguish him from other
small boys, and describe his life at whatever public school
he, the author, happens to know best. Mr. CHARLEs
MANN), has been more ambitious. He has hit on the
excellent idea of making his hero the last of a super-athletic
family. Mr. Rumbold had been a member of “one of the
best elevens Granby ever had,” and four of his sons had
established such a Rumbold tradition at the school that,
when Joe, the youngest, went there and began to show a
disposition to be head of his form instead of a marvel at
football, there was something more than mere consternation
in the family; and only the discovery that this black sheep
had the makings of an excellent long-distance runner pre-
vented Mr. Rumbold from taking him away from Granby
in disgrace. Eventually Joe displayed other gifts, so that
on the last page we find him receiving from his father the
following compliment: “I'm afraid you will never get a
Blue at Oxford, but all the same it may be worth while to
send you there.” To my mind, the best thing in an admir-
able book is the subtlety with which the characters of the
four great brothers are drawn. They appear but seldom,
yet it is quite easy to see that Pads is a thoroughly good
sort, that Bingo has the worst kind of swelled head, and
that Flip and Jumpy are so magnificent that they can
hardly be treated as human beings at all. If Mr. TURLEY
has a fault (which is very doubtful), it is that he is apt to
allow his sense of caricature to run away with him. But,
after all, it is not a serious fault, and it is certainly one of
which other school story-writers with a sense of humour
have been guilty. It should be unnecessary to add—but I
do it for the benefit of any curious reader who does not know
this best of school-chroniclers—that the Rumbold portraits
come straight out of Mr. TURLEY's own head, and are not
drawn from the members of any well-known athletic family.
After begging Mr. EDEN PHILLPotts to come out of his
groove I should indeed be an ingrate if I did not thank him
for the leap he makes in his new book, The Joy of Youth
(CHAPMAN AND HALL); for he has left his Dartmoor rustics
and landed rather plumpingly upon people of lineage and
inherited traditions. Devonshire is still the background of

his instant subjugation of his host is followed by that of the
reader. But it is not till later that you will relish the full
significance of the book's title, and see that Publius was
not the only irresistible boy whose arrival set a peaceful
neighbourhood by the heels. Another, not carrying a straw-
hat and a Gladstone bag, but a pair of wings and a bow-
and-arrows, was certainly present upon the station platform
when Publius introduced Bill Fennel to Mrs. Swift, his
travelling companion. Mr. WILLIAM CAINE has in short
written a love-story, and as captivating a one as I remember
to have read this great while. Joan Swift was a youngish
widow, pretty, appealing and moderately well off, who had
come to Berwick Evias to lodge in the cottage of an old
nurse. Naturally, Bill Fennel, who was the middle-aging
squire of the place, fell in love with her at sight, the more
so as there was another romance maturing at the time
between his sister and a genial young neighbour. So the
four of them, and that jolly Publius, had the time of their
lives, till something happened. Of course, it had been
bound to come. There was an occasional air of mystery
ing her varied career—in the
humble home of her youth, amidst the entourage of the
famous American novelist, Mrs. Northmere, in the glittering
world of Monte Carlo, and behind the scenes at the opera–
but in all of them with a light-footed agility almost rivalling
that of her Volscian namesake, self-possessed, adequate and
triumphantly facing the buffets of the world. I ought to
add that Miss GERTRUDE HALL made me feel as if I had
witnessed all these scenes and met all these people myself,
and since I have not for a long time past come across º
more vivid personality in fiction than that of Camilla I
have every hope that the crowd of readers will overlook
her numerous peccadillos and follow the rapid flight of her

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SODA-WATER SIPHON.
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,--I make no
apology for addressing you on the
subject of my Soda-Water Siphons,
because you, Sir, are accountable for
what I have gone through. You will
recall that not a great many weeks ago
you protested, by the pen of a con-
tributor, against the reiteration on our
Insurance Cards of the term, “The
week commencing.” Well, ever since I
can remember I have been galled, Sir,
and made sore and restive by the sub-
stitution, not only of “commence” for
“begin,” but of “assist" for “help,”
“sufficient" for “enough,” etc., etc.,
etc., etc., and, I may add, that my
resentment is quite apart from a private
conviction that I pay for these popular
refinements of my mother tongue when
I pay the Education rate. You may
judge, then, how firm is my habit of
self-suppression when I say that for
more than seven years I have, without
revolt, endured as right-hand companion
at my dinner table a Soda-Water Siphon
bearing the inscription :-
THIS syPHON
Is THE PROPERTY of
J AM E. s. Wo D D LE,
The Arcade Grocery,
Which irº Not returned in reason Able
TIME will, BE chargED 2s. 6d.
Your protest, Mr. Punch, Sir, fell like
rain on the arid soil of my compliance;
it was like leaven in the dough of my idle
acquiescence. I burst into leaf. I rose.
It was easy to decide that the proper
thing to do was to write to my grocer.
To speak to him would be to humiliate
him in the presence of his new bacon-
cutter. On the other hand, if I wrote, he
could read and hide his blushes behind
the little screened desk where (as I
happen to know, for I once drew a
cheque there) he uses a potato as a pin-
cushion. -
Having decided to write I simply
took a pen and wrote, courteously
adopting his illiterate way of spelling
the word Siphon :-
“SIR,-Referring to your Soda-
Water, I observe that the Syphons bear
a printed notice to the effect that if the
Syphon is not returned it “will be
charged half-a-crown.' It is clearly
impossible to exact a fine from a Soda-
Water Syphon. Why not therefore
alter the label? Yours faithfully,
J. M. PABSLIP.”
Mr. Woddle's reply came next day,
skewered to a Stilton cheese with a pin.
It was written on very thin paper with
a very hard-pointed pen.
“SIR,--I am in receipt of your
charge the Syphons 2s. 6d. when not
returned. We are obliged to do so in
order to protect ourselves. Soliciting a
continuance of your esteemed favours,
Yours respectfully,
JAMEs WooDLE.”
I hastened to reply.
“DEAR SIR,-You have misread my
letter. I quite agree that you must
protect yourself against loss of your
Syphons, but why not say on the label
that I–the user—will be charged half-
a-crown 2 You cannot possibly mean
that the Syphon will be charged half-a-
crown. Pardon my writing to you on
this subject, but in point of fact the
wording on the label causes me some
annoyance. Yours faithfully,
- J. M. PABSLIP.”
By return of post I got Mr. Woddle's
answer:-
“SIR,--I am in receipt of your
esteemed communication. I can only
repeat that when Soda-Water Syphons
are not returned they will be charged
2s. 6d. I have no intention of charg-
ing you for your Syphons. We used,
at one time, to make this charge
universally, but it was unpopular and
we found it unnecessary with our large

I could not obviously let the matter
rest there, so I sat down and laid
myself out to settle the thing for good
and all." - -
“MY DEAR SIR,” I wrote, “Please
do not misunderstand me. I fully
realise that you must reimburse your-
self in the event of your Syphons not
being returned to you; that is only
fair and reasonable. What I object to,
if I may say so, is that on the printed
label you clearly state that the Syphons
will be charged half-a-crown, and this
is an absolute impossibility. If you
read the label you will see that the
relative ‘which refers to the Syphon.
Surely this is clear. What you mean
is that, if for any reason the user
(myself, for instance) fails altogether,
or unreasonably delays, to make due
restitution of any Syphon or Syphons
to you (the rightful owner), then you
reserve the right, in the event of its not
being returned in reasonable time, to
exact from him (me, for instance) the
payment of the sum of two-and-sixpence
t
what you mean. Then why not say it?
The continued publication year after

the bacon next morning?— .
“SIR,--I am duly in receipt of your ||

prised that a gentleman should continue
to make complaints when a satisfactory
explanation has been offered. If my
Syphons are not returned they will be

so that gentlemen may know before-

know why, after all these years, a

It was impossible to do more than I
had done. It also seemed unreasonable
to go on ordering Soda-Water from
Woddle. ... I had grounds for reconsider-
ing this decision, however, whem, the

RHYMING SLANG.
“How's the bother and gawdfers ?”
I heard a porter in Covent Garden ask,
by way of afterthought, loudly of a
friend from whom he had just parted.
“Right as rain,” was . the shouted
reply; and I went on my way in a
state of bewilderment as to what they
were talking about. What was a
bother and what a gawdfer? I could
think of nothing except possibly some
pet animal, or a nickname for a mutual
friend. In a higher commercial rank
they might have been gold mines.
| Among soldiers they would have been
officers. I asked a few acquaintances,
but without any result, and so made a
note of the sentence and dismissed it
until the man who knows should arrive.
In course of time I found him. He
knows because he has -
had a varied career in
both hemispheres, even
to the navigation of
tramp steamers, and is
able and ready to talk
with anyone. Conver-
sational ease and natur-
alness in every class of
life are pre-eminently
his. He has seen some
strange things too, in-
cluding the hanging of
women, and he has
swapped stories with
both STEvENson and
MARK Twain. To-day
he is journalising in
London; to-morrow he
may be off again for
'Frisco, Sydney, any-
where. That is my man.
“What are a bother and agawdfer?”
I asked him.
“A wife and kid, of course,” he said.
(“Of course !” Think of saying “of
course" there.)
I looked perplexed, and he added—
“Rhyming slang, you know. Wife is
‘bother and strife.” Kids are “God
forbids.' And then, according to the
rule, the rhyming word is eliminated
and the others are the only ones used; ”
and we settled down to discuss this
curious development of language and
the Londoner's mania for calling
nothing by its right name.
Some one said recently, when a
member of the company had accused
America of having no poetry, “What
then is her slang?” And he was right,
American slang is poetry, her poetry.
It is descriptive, vivid and full of
images. But no such certificate can
be given to rhyming slang, which is
without any reason at all and, after the
rule referred to above has been put in
only principle it has is a perverse
passion for obliquity.
When an American is asked a ques-
tion for which he has no answer, and
he says, “Search me,” he is emphasising
in a striking and humorous way his
total lack of information on that point.
When he calls a very strong whisky
“Tangle-foot,” he indicates its peculiar
properties in unmistakable fashion in
the briefest possible terms. When the
same man sees a notoriously intellectual
person and exclaims, “Another high-
brow,” he at once calls up a picture of
SHAkspeaRE, Mr. HALL CAINE, Sir
OLIVER Lodge, or some other domed
cranium associated in our minds with
literary pursuits. His slang is essen-
tially pictorial. But when a Londoner
asks another after his “bother and
gawdfers,” there may be a certain
THE JOY-TOUR.
Super-Cargo (with delight). “I SAY, THESE CRoss-MARKs on THE ROAD MAP
DON'T MEAN SECONDARY OR BAD, ONLY VERY PICTURESQUE, so WE CAN LET HER
RIP.” (They do, as usual.)
asinine funniness in the remark, but
there is neither cleverness nor colour.
He might as well have said wife and
kids, whereas, when Americans use a
slang word, it is because it is better
than the other word.
Ordinary London slang has few
merits. “Nut,” for example, carries
no picture with it. Nor does it explain
itself. “Swank” happens to be a good
word, but it is not descriptive. In
American slang every phrase, like the
advertisement pictures, “tells a story.”
But if we condemn ordinary London
slang for its dulness, what shall we say
of rhyming slang? Only this, that the
Englishman should blush for it. The
silliness of it is abysmal. Look at this
sentence: “So I took a flounder to the
pope, laid my lump on the weeping,
and did a plough.” That is quite a
normal remark in any public bar. It
means that the speaker went home in
a cab and was quickly asleep. Why?
Because a cab is a flounder and dab ;
head is a lump of lead, a pillow is
a weeping willow, and to sleep is to
hiº the deep. A certain bibulous |
and quarrelsome peer was told by a
cabman that he hadn't been “first for I
a bubble.” It was probably only too
true; but what do you think it means?
It means that he hadn't been First of
October for a bubble and squeak:
reduced to essentials, sober for a week.
All this and more my friend told me.
Here are some anatomical terms. The I
face is the Chevy, from Chevy Chase; I
the nose is I suppose, this being one of
the cases where the whole rhyme is
always used; the brain is the once
again, shortened to “once”; the eye is
a mince, from mince pie; the hand is
bag, from bag of sand; the arm the
false, from false alarm. The oesophagus
(so to speak) is the Derby, or Derby
- Kell, from one Derby
Kelly; the garment
that covers it is the
Charlie, from Charlie
Prescott; but who these
heroes were I have not
discovered. A collar is
an Orford, from Oxford
scholar. Nothing, you
see, is gained by rhym-
ing slang; no saving in
time; and often indeed
the slang term is longer
than the real word, as
in tie, which is all me,
from all me eye, and
hat, which is this and
that in full.
Your feet are your
plates, from plates of
meat; your boots are
your daisies, from daisy |
roots; your teeth are your Hampsteads,
from a northern common; money is
don't be, from don't be funny; the
fire is the Anna, from Anna Maria.
Whisky is I'm so, from I'm so frisky;
beer is pig's ear in full; the waiter is
the hot, from hot pertater; and so forth.
And these foolish synonyms are really
used too, as you will find out with the
greater ease if (as I did) you loiter in
the Dolly. “In the Dolly?” you ask.
Oh, if you want any more information
let me give it: in the Garden—Covent
Garden, from Dolly Vardon.
But what I want now to know is
the extent of the rhyming vocabulary
and the process by which new words
are added to it. Supposing, for example,
it was felt that Mr. BERNARD SHAw had
to be referred to in rhyming slang,
who would decide that he was to be
known as, say, Holdyer, from hold yer
jaw 2 Who would invent that term
and how would it gain currency? That
question my friend could not answer.

fashion. A sleepy look is said to be .
taking its place.)
I READ it on the printed page;
It stood out sharp as fate,
That that wide smile, so long the rage
With ladies of the lighter stage,
Is doomed and out of date.
Those steady lips that served to show
Twin rows of glittering white,
The canines well exposed, as though
The artist meant to put below,
“Be careful, for I bite,”
Henceforth, if what men say is truth,
Are wholly banned and barred;
Of all I've loved from early youth
There will not be a single tooth
On any picture card.
My comrades charge me not to weep;
For, tho' the smile be doomed,
In place thereof a look of deep
And calmly idiotic sleep.
Even now is being boomed.
But how could such a thing atone
To my distracted heart? -
'Tis worse. I do not sigh alone
For that long smirk so tried and
known;
I mourn the fall of Art.
For lack of truth I hold a sin
Of infinite degree;
There was some colour for the grin;
But where the sleepy look comes in
Is one too much for me.
Nay, judging by the strenuous way
In which these damsels make
Their noble matches, one would say
That, far from being sleepy, they
Are very wide awake.

OUR ANNUAL MASSACRE.
Major Hertingfordbury telegraphed :
“Delighted. Will 1,000 cartridges be
enough 2"
To which I replied: “Thanks very
much. Will last me nicely for season.”
Jim sent a post-card : “Right. Sup-
pose it's going to be like last year.
Lunch at 1.02 ''
The weather was excellent. So was the
lunch. I pointed out that they should
make the most of what might prove
easily the best feature of the day, and
we got off about 2.30 P.M. Jarge, the
gardener, scraped his boots on a spade,
slung the potato-sack–I should say,
game-bag—over his shoulder, whistled
to Spider, and followed us as soon as
his pipe was well alight. Jim stared
at the dog in an extremely offensive
manner, but said nothing.
Any idea of walking the rough field
in line for a rabbit was frustrated by
the spaniel. I had left strict orders for
him to be taken a long walk in the
morning and, if possible, to be
thoroughly tired out; but the brute
had kept a good bit in hand, and we
were all well blown before we got him
on a lead. This delay gave time for a
maid from the house to catch us up
with the news that the men had finished
cleaning out the ashpit and would like
to see the master before they went. I
sent a verbal honorarium, pulled the
shoot together, and started off again.
We spread out through the allotments,
the occupants courteously ceasing work
to note our passage, and entered the
stubble.
There was a great deal of stubble,
acres and acres of it, with only one
precious patch of roots into which
we hoped to chivvy the birds—when
found. We walked and walked; had a
breather; walked again, and at last
came upon them. A covey of thirteen,
all full-feathered in the wing, strong in
the leg and keen-eyed. Unluckily they
found us a fraction of a second sooner
than we did them and hopped over a
hedge. We nipped round and chivvied
cautiously up wind. I was afraid that
Spider's breathing as he bore on the
leash would put them up. We breasted
rising ground and saw them. They
saw us, too, and began running towards
the station-sidings, where we had lost
them last time. Jim and I doubled
back and round to cut them off. An
engine shrieked and the birds got up
wide to swing round behind us . . .
down with a turn of wing in the far
meadow. The first chivvy was a
failure.
At this point Major Hertingfordbury
came up and asked whether we in-
tended driving at all, as, if not, his
man could take his second gun and his
stick back to the house and see to a
few details on the car. Jim said the
birds were a bit wild, but how would
it be now to send Jarge well round
behind them, casual like, to push 'em
back on to our ground, we keeping low
in the ditch 2 Jarge said that, knowing
Grierson's cowinan, he thought it might
be done and that without offence, if
anyone would take on Spider for a bit
and the light held up.
It worked all right. The covey
winded him the moment he crept
under the stile into the meadow; they
seemed thoroughly roused now and got
up squawking their loudest. They
made a wide circle, shied at the sidings,
and finally settled in the roots. It
was the moment of the afternoon.
Jarge returned breathless and beaming.
There was no time to shake hands.
We gave Spider back to him ; then,
the Major in the centre, Jim and I on
the flanks, pale, grim, and at the ready,
we stole up. The swedes were high,
our hopes higher. . . .
I still think we might have got them
but for sheer bad luck. Jarge trod on
a rabbit, hit at it with his stick, and
missed it. The spaniel barked himself
free and plunged into the chase with
all the pent-up ardour of the last two
hours. His idea seemed to be that if
he only jumped high enough and came
down hard enough, listening for a
moment between whiles, he might stun
something before it could escape. Like
a porpoise at play, he leaped on before
our outraged eyes and raucous voices.
Well out of shot, sudden as pantomime
demons, the birds rose around him.
Far down the valley they skimmed—
were seen as specks against the setting
sun as they rose to the river . . . then
no more.
We filled our pipes and walked home
in silence. As I stopped behind to close
the gate there was a pattering of feet,
and out of the darkness came Spider.
In his mouth was a rabbit. It just
saved us from a blank day.
One hesitates to accuse any class of
men of cowardice, but the following
extract from The Post Office Guide
seems to point at least to vicarious
timidity on the part of our postal
officials:– “Packets containing liquids,
greasy substances, or live bees can be
sent to countries in the Postal Union.
They must be made up so that they
can be easily opened for purposes of in-
spection, with the exception of packets
containing live bees, which must be
enclosed in boxes so constructed as to
allow the contents to be ascertained
without opening.”
GOOD NEWS FOR RUPERT.
(Suggested by an inspiriting paragraph
wpon a recent exhibition which stated
that a reaction against lururious and
effeminate apparel for toy-dogs had
set in.) -
So long as Poms and Pekingese
And lordlier tykes, mayhap, than these
Would go to Bond Street tailors,
And every day adown the road
One saw exotic reptiles towed
In fancy suitings a la mode
And Homburg hats or “ sailors,
I also did my humble best
To have my Irish terrier dressed
In fairly decent clothing,
Lest some proud darling on a chain,
Attached to Beauty's chatelaine,
Should point the forepaw of disdain
And flout him as a low thing.
I could not give him patent boots,
Nor all the gear of hats and suits,
That made these playthings too pert;
But what my humble means allowed
(I may be poor, but I am proud),
That none might scorn him in the
crowd,
I freely gave to Rupert.
A thickish coat of homespun twecd,
A cap to save his ears at need
From that brute of the vicar's,
Large-brimmed, because he fights with
cats,
Two pairs of purple-coloured spats
To guard him from the bites of rats,
And two of football knickers.
Yes, that was all. Yet I may say
He jibbed at even this display,
He simply loathed his swathing;
You should have seen his coat, by Jove,
On days when he decreed to rove,
His Tyrian gaiters turned to mauve
By dint of frequent bathing.
But now the edict issues forth—
Let it be barked from south to north—
Fashion has changed her habits;
The hat, the gown, the sock, the snood
Have sunk into desuetude,
The stout goloshes may be chewed
As substitutes for rabbits.
And Rupert—with what conscious pride
He prances at his master's side
And leaves him at his daily 'bus;
A freer, but a happier hound,
And (gentle ladies, gather round)
I think quite adequately gowned
In puris naturalibus. EvoB.

| THE SUPER-AGITATOR.
So long as Mr. JAMEs LARKIN con-
tinues his timid and half-hearted
methods he will never gain that full
publicity and approval which he so
much desires. Only the weaklings were
impressed by the manner in which, on
his return to freedom, he staggered
Dublin, shook Ireland, and made threat-
ening grimaces at Great Britain. A
really competent agitator would have
staggered the earth, shaken the solar
system and shot ink into the Milky
Way.
A Daily Mail writer has told us that
“if Larkin at a public meeting is given
the lie direct he jumps from the plat-
form and hits his accuser on the jaw.”
Surely that is a totally inadequate
method of dealing with such an amazing
contretemps. A really strong man would
take hold of the chairman and hurl him
at his accuser, striking that unhappy
person on both jaws and also giving
him a thick ear.

been in prison must come out again,”
LARKIN is reported to have said. But
give us a thorough agitator, he would
have ordered the recall of all the Irish
who had settled down comfortably in
the United States; he would have wired
at the same time to the Channel Fleet
to be off Dublin at daybreak and await
orders for proper treatment of the em-
ployers; and in the meantime one of
his assistants would have forwarded
instructions of different kinds to the
Lord Mayor of LoNDoN, Mr. ANDREw
CARNEGIE, the GERMAN EMPEROR, the
Lord CHIEF JUSTICE, and even Mr.
John REDMoND himself.
As a matter of fact, LARKIN has been
merely toying with his task. It may
not be true that the ideal strike-leader
never sleeps; but he should be of the
stuff that demands to be wakened
every hour so that nobody else may be
allowed to rest. At midnight the at-
tendant rouses him. “Time to wake,
Sir,” he says, keeping his jaw well out
Asquith that I want a Cabinet meeting

great one; and he settles down to sleep

engaged, call out the telephone opera-
tors"—and so the night would drag on.

THE
“FULL-STEAM "
OPTIMIST.
ſ"The real tempest is over, and, although the wind may be shrieking through the rigging, although the waves may still look
a little angry, the sky is clear, the glass is rising, and we know in a very, very short time we will be in calm water.’’
- From a speech at Birmingham by Mr. Icdmond, author of the new nautical phrase, “Full steam ahead."]
THE worst is over, the storm is done,
The clouds have all rolled by:
Notice how nicely beams the sun
Out of a nice blue sky;
Long have we been the blizzard's sport
Till hope was as good as dead;
But now we are pounding straight for port
At the word “Full steam ahead ' "
The wind (there's some of it still) may blow
And the waves rise ridge on ridge,
But the Cabinet's stoking down below
And I am on the bridge;
Yes, I am the Captain of this stout ark,
A mariner born and bred;
And the mercury's soaring like a lark
As we go full steam ahead.
There never was such a loyal crew :
There's trusty bosun TIM ;
There's mate O'BRIEN, as true as true—
I'm terribly fond of him;
Rather than quarrel with friends so old,
This I would do instead:—
I'd clap 'em in irons down the hold
Asquith and WINSTON, too, I like,
Excel'ent stokers both ;
They neve, would think of going on strike
And breaking their briny oath;
They may prattle of rocks that leeward lurk,
Charted a bloody red,
But they soon get back to their bunker-work
When I shout “Full steam ahead.”
Thus in these poor brief seaman's rhymes
Broadly I've shown the gist
Of the hopeful signs of the present times
That make me an optimist;
There's no sting left in the beastly foam;
We can die (if we must) in bed;
For everything points to a clear run home
As we forge full steam ahead.
O loud and long will the welcome be
(And it's going to come quite soon)
When we cross the last reef (No. 3)
Into the still lagoon;
Already I hear the local smiles,
For which we have toiled and bled,
Dreak on the greenest of Blessed Isles



















As we drive full steam ahead.
As we plunge full steam ahead. O. S.

STUDIES OF REVIEWERS.
I.—THE OMNIscient DGoTIST.
(With acknowledgments to DR. ARTHUR
LYNCH, M.P.)
BIsMARCK once told me of an evening
at Von RANKE's. The great historian,
then in his eighty-fifth year and hard
at work on his Weltgeschichte, was
asked whether he thought elegance of
style was of vital importance in his
branch of letters, and replied, “No
more than your favourite mixture of
champagne and stout is essential to
the making of the German Empire.”
I have been reminded of this story
by the perusal of Post-impressionist
Musings by our excellent friend, Orlando
Wambley. The volume revives in my
mind the old conflict of the Nominalists
and Realists, DUN's Scotus, THOMAs
AQUINAs and BonAvRNTURA, ARIs-
ToPHELEs the Trapezuntine, Psittacus
Ambulator, and, above all, Corcorygus
the Borborygmatic, to whom Wambley
is the most perfect modern analogue.
I will only say, whatever you read,
never allow your epistemological bias
to deflect your mind from the conceptual
basis of an altruistic empiricism. We
are all post-impressionists nowadays,
but, as BERG son once remarked to me,
when I criticised his gelastic hypothesis,
the difference between “post” and
“ante” is an arbitrary convention. As
he wittily observed, “even a postcard
can be antedated.” SAPPHo was a
post-impressionist, so were PAUL the
Silentiary, CoNFUcIUs and HoKUsAI,
whom I once met at Prince Ito's
bungalow on the slopes of Fujiyama,
where Hokus AI, the Baroness ORCzY
and Mr. WALTER SAVAGE LANDoR had
taken refuge during a protracted earth-
quake. I mention these names, not to
emphasize the range of my acquaint-
ance, but simply to illustrate the
advantages of foreign travel. It is true
that GIBBoN, whom I knew intimately,
once observed, “Conversation may
enrich the intellect, but solitude is the
true school of genius,” and my friend
FILSON. YoUNG, who once lived for
seventeen weeks in a lighthouse, is a
living example of the truth of the
saying. But genius can be gregarious
too; witness GoFTHE, Xoch IMILCo the
Aztec philosopher—with whom I once
spent a delightful fortnight at his
châlet at the foot of Ixtaccihuatl-and
BUNYAN, whom, alas! I never met.
Personality is the true antiseptic of
literature, and in this vivifying quality,
I regret to say, the work of our excellent
friend, Wambley, is somewhat to seek.
Thus, though he gossips cheerfully of
BAUDELAIRE and BARBEY D'AUREvii.I.Y,

them all, look in vain for anything that
recalls the many hours spent in their
stimulating company. Not one word
is said here of PATER's moustache, or of
BAUDELAIRE's green socks, or BARBEY’s
wonderful nankeen pantaloons.
I often marvel why it is that in such
a book as Wambley's, the product of
an esoteric cénacle of choice spirits, the
application of the craniometrical test
should be conspicuous by its absence.
I know that the Italian anthropologist,
SERGI, has led a revolt against metrical
methods of all kinds. I am content to
take my stand under the banner of
Poupinas the French, and Blödiföl the
Hungarian, expert. SKobe LEFF, who
taught me scouting, had practically no
back to his head. PERICLES's head was
compared to a sea-squill or sea-onion,
which has a large acrid bulbous root.
And that brings me to the important
point that all first-rate genius is bulbo-
cephalic. SKoBELEFF was only partially
bulbocephalic—that was the tragedy of
BERY said to me at Plevna, “Skobel EFF's
spheno-maxillary angle is little better
than a gorilla’s.” I think WAMBERY
went too far, as he often did, but to
eliminate this aspectof geniusaltogether,
as our excellent friend Wambley has
done, is even more reprehensible. For,
in spite of all the fatuities of the
so-called phrenologists, we can never
get away from the basic fact that
genius varies in a direct ratio with the
cubical contents of the cranium. When
I offered myself as a pupil to HAFFRINE
he said nothing, but took up my hat,
and, seeing that the size was 8%,
accepted my application forthwith.
Still, I admit that this in no way
justifies my venturing to sit in judgment
on a pundit like Wambley. But I feel
that the foregoing remarks may be not
without their interest to those who
recognize that, in letters as in life,
personality is the paramount asset, and
that the louder the personal note is
struck in journalism, the more resound-

THE ROUT OF THE THEORIST.
For a full minute the excitement was
simply tremendous. The ball kept bob-
bing about in the mouth of the goal
amid a perfect frenzy of kicking legs
and twisting bodies, behind which the
goal-keeper danced on his toes in an
agony of apprehension. Then, all at
once, it shot clear and landed at the foot
of our outside right, who without hesi-
tation raced with it down the field. We
were saved again -
“I am ready to wager, Sir," said the
little man º, next to me, “you
were not aware that you were gripping
the edge of the seat just then as if your
very life depended upon it.”
“Well, 'what about it?" I asked
coldly. “It's a perfectly natural action
at such a time.” -
“Just my point!" he cried brightly.
“I always say it is in moments of great
emotional stress or excitement that the
power of atavism reveals itself. Ages
and ages ago our ancestors, living in
trees, had to be gripping the branches
all day long. Their lives, in fact, did
depend on a tight grip. And so, when
you got violently excited just now, you
simply reverted. You grasp the idea 2"
I tried hard not to listen to him.
The play had again reached an acutely
interesting stage. Sanderson, our out-
side left, had just forced a corner, and
was about to take the kick himself.
“Now do just look at that l” cried
| the persistent voice in my ear. “Another
| really remarkable proof of my theory.
Did you notice how the player moistened
his hands? What possible, what con-
ceivable reason could he have for doing
that, since he is about to kick the ball,
not to pick it up 2 Atavism, I assert,
my dear Sir, simply atavism. Far back
in those days of tree-dwelling, of which
I spoke just now, our ancestors would
naturally moisten their hands before
some great effort—a more than usually
long spring, let us say—in order to
ensure a good grip. Now, you observe,
when called upon to make a supreme
effort . . .”
He was cut short by a shattering
| roar of applause as our inside right
dodged skilfully round the opposing
| backs and sent the ball whizzing past
the helpless goal-keeper. One ex-
citable spectator in our neighbourhood
snatched off his hat and hurled it high
into the air.
“Here we have another remarkable
example of reversion,” continued the
little man when he could make him-
self heard. “Ages and ages ago our
ancestors, as you know, wore no
clothes. Gradually, very gradually,
they acquired the habit of covering
stances. Now, I think, after a little
reflection, you will admit it to be more
than probable that a covering for the
head, or hat, was the last article of
clothing to be adopted, and this being
so it is naturally the first to be dis-
carded by our friend when, in his
emotional moment, he experiences this
overpowering instinct to revert to the
primitive state of mankind.”
Just at this point the referee gave a
foul against one of our side, and in the
torrent of abuse and exhortation which
followed I missed the concluding words.
But he had by no means finished.
“Now let us consider the manifestation
of anger,” he went on imperturbably as
soon as the noise had exhausted itself.
“Ages and ages ago . . .” -
I turned upon him in desperation.
“So far as I understand you,” I
interrupted, “you assert that in a
moment of supreme emotion a man's
actions are determined by atavism, that
he does precisely what a primitive man,
or monkey, if you like, would do in
similar circumstances.”
“Not quite as I should have put it,”
he replied, “but still you have the idea.”
“Very well, then,” I went on. “I
am going to prove that you are wrong.”
“Good" he replied, rubbing his
hands delightedly. “This is really most
interesting.”
“You were about to deal with the
manifestation of anger,” I continued.
“Lſ your theory were correct, a man's
instinctive act in a moment of intense
irritation and annoyance with another
man would not be to snatch out a pistol
and fire at his tormentor, or to draw a
dagger and stab him, but simply to
seize hold of him and attempt to bite
him, or possibly to double up his fist
and hit him between the eyes, even
though he realised perfectly well that
the effect of this would be trifling
compared with the effect of other
measures he might take.”
“Exactly,” cried the other. “You
could hardly have chosen a better
example.”
“You are wrong,” I repeated, opening
the big pocket-knife which I always
carry, and leisurely testing its edge on
my thumb. “Ages and ages ago our
ancestors may have been satisfied . . .”
But he was gone.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“GREAT CATHERINE.”
THE best form of charade is that in
which, having chosen your word—e.g.,
“PUNch”—you proceed in dumb show
to act episodes in the lives of famous
people whose names begin with the
letters of the word. Thus you would
have five characteristic scenes wherein
figured in turn Pompey, ULYSSEs, NERO,
CHARLEs I., and HANNIBAL–or any-
body else who occurred to you. Per-
haps, very late one evening, having
already used up CHARLEs I. and II.,
CRomwell, CANUTE, and JULIUS CAESAR,
the name of CATHERINE might occur to
you—CATHERINE II. of Russia. It is
doubtful whether you would consider
any incident in her life to be sufficiently
well known to a mixed audience to
need no words to explain it, but anyhow
it would amuse you to try. After all,
charades are only meant to amuse
the actors; the audience is there at
its own risk.
At the Vaudeville the other night I
felt that Great Catherine must have
started life as a family charade. The
incident represented was probably that
in the fourth scene, where Catherine
tickles a trussed-up English prisoner
with her foot. She mentions casually
that this is her favourite torture,
and if (as is quite likely) history men-
tions it too, then it would be a scene
which an audience of Mr. SHAw's
friends, better-read than myself, might
easily recognise. Possibly Mr. SHAw
himself played the small part of A
Cossack Sergeant.
And then next morning, so I picture
it, the jolly charades of the previous
night came back to Mr. SHAw, and
in particular the fun which they had
got out of “C for CATHERINE.” “If
only we had been allowed words, we
could have had a lot more sport with
it.” Idly he played with the idea in his
mind, giving first himself a few words
as the Cossack Sergeant (including a
joke about his “sweetbread,” subse-
quently used three times) and then
allotting an occasional speech to the
others. Gradually his ambition for it
increased ; by the afternoon he was
refreshing his memory at his encyclo-
paedia (CAN–CLE); by the evening the
whole thing was planned out in his
mind. Next morning saw him at work.
Great Catherine (he wrote). A thumb-
mail sketch of Russian Court Life in the
XVIII. century. In Four Scenes. And
before he went to bed it was finished.
So only can I explain Mr. BERNARD
SHAw's new play at the Vaudeville. I
am sure it amused him to write it;
I am sure it would amuse him to act
selfish. He must think of the amuse-
ment of others. That the English
have an elementary sense of humour
is probably his opinion. Captain
Edstaston, of the Light Dragoons, is
shown us as a very solemn gentleman
until the Russian name “Popoff" is
mentioned, when he goes into fits of
laughter; and no doubt when Mr. SHAw
himself (in Caesar and Cleopatra) got
so much ſun for us out of the mis-
pronunciation of Ftatateeta's name he
was purposely writing down to the
English level of humour. But there
are people in his audiences who are
not entirely English—people also who
have some feeling for Mr. SHAw and
a great admiration for his genius. It
is a pity to disappoint them.
To Mr. NorAIAN McKINNELL I owe
most of my laughter; as Prince Potem-
kin he was delightful. Mr. EDMOND
BREoN played excellently as the Eng-
lish captain, being particularly good in
his last speech, and Miss GERTRUDE
KINGSTON was the Empress Catherine
to the life. (Not that I ever saw the
Empress Catherine, but I feel now as
if I had.) It is only fair to say that
Great Catherine is preceded by Between
Sunset and Dawn, a play which of itself
demands a visit to the Vaudeville.
“IF WE HAD ONLY KNowN.”
The characters that pleased me most
in Mr. INGLIs ALLEN's play were
Meeks and A Loafer. Meeks was a
Scots maid-of-all-work who spoke,
through the medium of Miss JEAN
CADELL, with a fine native accent and
a pleasant directness of expression.
A Loafer, though he caused nearly all
the subsequent trouble by omitting to
post a crucial letter, was only on just
long enough to state, and reiterate, to
Meeks his opinion that she was a
“dirty general servant.” But these
two smaller parts served to recall the
reputation that Mr. INGL1s ALLEN made
long ago in literature for the observant
humour which he brought to his
dialogues of the highways and byways
of humble life.
If it were not the recognised ambition
of every humorist to be taken seriously
one might have been surprised at his
choice of such a theme as the de-
liberate avoidance of fatherhood and
motherhood. There are grave subjects
which yet lend themselves to a light
treatment; but this is not of them, if
offence is to be escaped. Mr. ALLEN
started lightly, but when once he had
entered on the domain of gynaecology
and obstetrics he found little chance
for humour, and had all his work cut
out to spare us unnecessary embarrass-
as could be hoped. For the rest, I
think that conscientiousness was his
prevailing virtue. When he thought
that dull and futile things would be
said in real life he never hesitated to
make his characters say them. I am
afraid that this is a virtue which he
will have to slough if he means to go
far with a British audience.
If it is a test of a good play that it
should arouse sympathy in the hearts
of the audience I think Mr. ALLEN has
here failed of complete success. One
can imagine oneself deeply moved by a
father's emotion in the deadly waitin
hours before the birth of his first child,
but unfortunately the exhibition of
stupid and vulgar misunderstanding
between husband and wife in the First
Act (though no doubt the wife could
plead the excuse of her physical con-
dition) had permanently disabled me
from taking more than an academic
interest in their subsequent histories.
Then again I am always annoyed when
a woman shows a morbid hesitation—so
rare in real life and so common in books
and plays—about letting her husband
know that she is to bear him a child,
though here again there was an excuse
for the wife in the play, who understood
that her husband did not regard his
income as warranting this luxury.
Thirdly it was never explained to us
why she should choose to consult a
lady-doctor whose male friends were
offensive. In fact we received the im-
pression (too clearly to lose it later,
when the author wanted us to) that the
heroine was half prude and half vixen,
and in consequence the question of her
fate in child-birth left me brutally cold.
Still, when all is said, I must credit
Mr. ALLEN with an honest and not un-
dignified attempt to glorify parenthood
as the brightest joy of married life and
the most satisfactory solvent of its
difficulties.
The jealous irritability of the wife
in the First Act seemed to suit Miss |
MARY JERRold's gifts better than the
subsequent pride of maternity. Mr.
MALcolM CHERRY, as the husband, was
sincere within his limitations; and Mr.
RUDGE HARDING, as a medical amicus
curiae, went meritoriously through some
very trying alternations of humour and
homiletics.
Miss MADGE McINTosh, as the
mother-in-law, bore the unrelieved ban-
ality of her utterances as if she enjoyed
it. Mr. PERCEvaL CLARK began funnily
as a parenthetic observer of life, but his
chances tailed off. Finally Miss AIMEE |

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN the modern literature of humour Mr. STEPHEN LEAcock
is what the Harlequins used to be in Rugby football. He
takes risks. Sometimes he will try for a joke where a more
cautious man would have perceived that no joke was. But
far more frequently he will extract humour of the finest
kind from absolutely nothing, and score, so to speak, a try
from his own goal-line. In his latest book, Behind the
Beyond (LANE), he is in brilliant scoring form. I can see
Behind the Beyond breaking up many homes; for no family
will be able to stand the sudden sharp yelps of laughter
which must infallibly punctuate the decent after-dinner
silence when one of its members gets hold of this book.
It is Mr. LEAcock's peculiar gift that he makes you laugh
out loud. I am a stern, soured, sombre man, one of those
people who generally show that they are amused by a faint
twitching of the lip; but, when Mr. LEAcock's literal
translation of HoMER on page 193 met my eye, a howl of
mirth broke from me. I also forgot myself over the inter-
view with the photographer. As for “Behind the Beyond”
itself, the sketch which gives its title to the book, it is the
last word in polished burlesque. I cannot say that this
book has actually displaced Mr. LEAcock's Sunshine
Sketches of a Little Town in my esteem, for that classic
created a new world for me and has a place of honour of
its own on my shelves. Sunshine Sketches was super-
his best. But I respectfully submit that that isºworth
four-and-sixpence of anybody's money. -
Mr. BoHUN LYNCH is a bold man. I do not know
whether there actually exists any family called Tibshelf,
but, if such there be, these are days in which they might
quite possibly bring an action for defamation against the
author of Cake (MURRAY); because the whole plot of his
tale hangs upon the unpleasantness of being called Tibshelf.
I must say I agree. It seems to me a quite beastly name;
but of course this is a pure matter of opinion. In Cake
there are some wholly charming persons called Luffingham,
who own a delightful old house as picturesque as themselves,
but not enough ready cash to support it. To them comes
the chance, through a will, of wealth attainable only on
condition of calling themselves Tibshelf. Well, of course it
wouldn't be exactly a happy exchange; but I do think that
Mr. LYNCH makes too much fuss about it. To him evidently
a Luffingham by any other name would by no means smell
so sweet. However, his characters seem to have been of
my opinion; for half-way through the book you find them
basking contentedly enough in the affluence that this name
of Tibshelf confers. They, in short, eat their cake with an
appetite. And, after all, the ingenuity of their creator was
to find a way in which they could falsify the proverb and
still have it. What that way is I shall not explain; though
indeed the plot of this story is not to be compared with the
pleasant way in which Mr. BoHUN LYNCH tells it. He has

LBAcock. The present volume is merely Mr. LEAcock at
the gift of a chatty and yet witty style that forces you to

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A UNITED FAMILY.
(Dedicated with best regards to the Chief Secretary.)
[At the last performance in his orgy of oratory at Bristol, Mr.
BIRRELL is reported to have said:— -
“During the last two days the Cabinet have sat for a considerable
number of hours. I have been present at those deliberations, and
all I say is—dismiss from your minds any notion that there is any
difference of opinion. We are one and all behind the Prime Minister.
. . . We are a united Government.”
Subsequently, in addressing the National Liberal Federation at
Leeds Mr. Asquith endorsed this allegation of perfect unanimity.]
THINK not that I would lightly play
Like a buffoon or comic mime
With this grave theme that night and day
Has tasked my manhood's serious prime;
Others may choose to trifle, but
It is not so with Bristol's BIRRELL,
Who owns that Ireland is a nut
That might unnerve the stoutest squirrel.
Nevertheless I plead excuse
If, just for once in all this while,
I let my solemn features loose
And lapse into a pensive smile ;
I cannot help it when I meet
With men who think (oh, how erroneous!)
Our dovecote up in Downing Street
Might possibly be more harmonious.
I have been there and taken part
In high debate, and so I know,
And I assure you, on my heart,
'Twas “like a little heaven below; ”
There was not one at that bright board
Who mutineered or even muttered;
When AsquitH spoke we all encored,
We echoed every word he uttered.
Though on the platform GREY invites
The conversazione's aid,
While RUNCIMAN, with lesser lights, -
Cries “Blood l’’ and bares his infant blade;
Though various voices float through space
From dulcet coos all down the gamut
To roarings in a DEVLIN bass
(“Sure, who's afraid of Ulster, damn ut!”)—
Yet on my conscience I protest,
And for a token, as I speak,
I lay this hand upon my chest,
This tongue against my bulging cheek—
I swear (and, when I swear, you've got
Something that you may safely trust in)—
We are a most united lot ;
Believe me, Truly yours, AUGUSTINE.
O. S.
Bishop Boyd CARPENTER as reported in The Times:—
“Instead of saying to the children, “You shall not do this or
that,' they should say, ‘You should keep the whole of that great
organism which God has put into your care, with its delicate forces,
physical, moral, and intellectual, in such a state of healthful
activity that they shall be combined in your own individuality in
such sort as to be real powers for good through the whole length of
your days.’” -
Harold (continuing to pull the cat's tail). “What did you
HOW WE LOST A LITTLE DOG.
I MAY say that, for better or for worse, our house is a
doggy house, and there is always a considerable amount of
cheerful tail-wagging going on in it. Amongst others who
have dedicated to our use their genius for friendship and
affection we reserve a high place for Soo-ti, a dusky little
Pekinese who for two years has been our gay and insepara-
ble companion. I have spoken of him before. To-day I
propose to relate a crisis in his existence.
Soo-ti has all the engaging characteristics of his race.
He is shaped on a leonine model, heavily maned, broad-
headed, thin in the flanks; his nose turns up most per-
versely, and his eyes are large, luminous and expressive.
He is a compact embodiment of all the obstinacies, inde-
pendences and humorous wilfulnesses that have always
been found in spaniels of his breed. His courage is
tremendous. He faces a cart-horse, a mastiff or a motor-
car with equal coolness and disdain, always walking by
preference along the centre-line of whatever road he happens
to be on, and refusing to budge for vehicles of any descrip-
tion. How he escapes destruction I cannot understand;
but there seems to be amongst coachmen and carters and
chauffeurs in our district an agreement that he is to be
considered a sort of policeman's hand, and, when his airy
impudence is seen swaggering along, traffic stops and even
butchers' carts delay the delivery of joints in order that
Soo-ti may walk unscathed. - - -
Such, then, was and is Soo-ti, endeared to us by much
wickedness and many virtues, and not least by his infinit-
esimal size. He is, indeed, an absurdly small compendium
of all that is great and glorious in dogdom. With one little
hand a child can lift this tiny mass of faith and arrogance,
of devotion and defiance, into the air, hold it out at arm's
length and deposit it on a sofa cushion, where, after its
three ritual circlings, it goes to sleep and becomes a mere
little black blot on its soft bed. We had watched Soo-ti
grow up from puppyhood, but he had never seemed to
become larger, and whenever we spoke to him or thought
of him it was in terms of diminutiveness.
Now it happened that some eight weeks ago, Soo-ti was
suddenly, and without being in the least aware of it, pro-
moted to the honourable state of being a father—“Sire” is,
I believe, the technical term. A puppy was assigned to us,
was duly invested (in absentia) with the name of Puk— F
short for Puk-wudjie—and was yesterday fetched away
from its agitated and protesting mother to its new home in
our midst. We were all gathered to receive it, and when,
released from its basket, it was set down upon the floor there
was a universal shout of joy and admiration. It was an ador-
able ball of soft and seemingly boneless black fluff, so small
that a man's coat pocket could easily contain it, and, save
for a white shirt-frill and four sets of tiny white toes, it was
the born image of its father, who, as it chanced, was not
present when it was unpacked. It began its new life with
enthusiasm, licked whatever hand or cheek it could lay its
coral tongue to, waddled about the room or turned itself on
its back, submitting to everything that fate might decree for
it, got up and gave three short prances that brought it into
collision with an armchair, sat down gravely and looked out
upon this perplexing world from its blue puppy eyes, laid
offerings of overwhelming and undying affection at every-
body's feet, and altogether behaved as if it realised its import-
ance without being in the least abashed by its lack of size.

his inspection, turned away and took no further notice.

“It's— No, it can't be,” said Rosie.
“It must be No, it isn't,” said Peggy.
“It's Soo-ti,” said John. “He’s growed up.”
“It is Soo-ti,” they all shouted together. “How big

As a matter of fact, it was Soo-ti, but, by contrast with
the atom to which we had been devoting ourselves, he had
grown in our eyes to proportions so gigantic that for a
moment we had seen a retriever in his place. And even
to-day we have failed to reduce him to his normal size.
Something we managed to effect by taking him for a walk
with the Great Dane, but as soon as he came home and
found himself in the same room with Puk he began again
to swell visibly, and now he is once more a big dog. The
pretty graces that belong to the very small seem through the
presence of his son to have dropped from him. In short,
we have lost our little dog. But we still hope that, when

As though, behind it, I elude his vision;
If I were robbed before his eyes or slain,
He would clean on with unimpaired precision;
In short, with the first action of his wrist,
I simply cease by some means to exist.
It stands to reason that, my light grown dim,
My peace destroyed, my business dislocated,
I'm forced to take an interest in him

I've thought his mien a studied insult—yet
At other times I've hoped it's etiquette.

plain, blunt Englishman, and I'm not

persecuting me?
Mr. Wu. Please explain.
Mr. Gregory. Three weeks ago my
son disappeared. Now I don't say
Basil is a nice boy, but I happen—er,
his mother happens to be rather fond
of him. We miss him—that is to say,
she misses him—well, anyhow, he is
missed . . . at times. But that is
not all. Yesterday one of my ships
went down ; to-day my coolies have
already struck three times in five
minutes—no, you needn't look at that
clock, it doesn't go—have struck three
times in five minutes for higher pay.
Worse than this, my manager, who is
supposed to do a good deal of the work

of this office, has adopted of late a
play of facial expression and a wealth
of gesture which reminds one of the
worst excesses of the transpontine
stage. He can't say the simplest thing
in a natural way nowadays. I feel
convinced, Mr. Wu, that you are behind
all this. It's annoying enough to lose
a son, but to lose a good boat and a
valuable manager as well—it's simply
unbearable. -
Mr. Wu. How can I be behind all
this, Mr. Gregory? To take one case,
how can I be responsible for your
manager's extraordinary behaviour?
Mr. Gregory (reasonably). Well, after
all, you're producing the play, MATHE-

cartridges and hands them to him.) I

pocket.) Now then, Mr. Gregory ! (He
presents the revolver at his head.) Kindly

Mr. Gregory (overwhelmed by this
sudden turn of fortune). Confound you!
You have got the better of me by your
devilish Eastern cunning, but you can-
not cow my English spirit. I will not
ring the bell. (Rings it.) What do
you want my wife for? (Enter Murray.)
Murray, send Mrs. Gregory in.
[Mrs. Gregory comes in, and Gregory
goes reluctantly out, leaving his
wife alone with Mr. Wu.
Mr. Wu. Mrs. Gregory, I can help
you to find your son. Mr.
Gregory doesn't know how to
talk to a gentleman, so I have
sent for you instead. If you will
come to my house this evening
at six I will tell you my plans.
No, you needn't look at that
clock, it doesn't go.
Mrs. Gregory. Oh, Mr. Wu, if
you could find my son for me, I

[DECEMBER 3, 1913.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WELL DONE!
After the enormous success of his de-
scription of a football match for “The
‘Daily Mail,” the Dean of Manchester,
the Right Rev. Bishop Welldon, is, we
understand, so enamoured of sporting
journalism that there is no holding
him. Hence the following article on a
billiard match which “Mr. Punch" is
privileged to print:-
As I crossed Leicester Square I ob-
served that not a few persons, equally
interested with me in the delicate mani-
pulation of ivory balls over a verdant
cloth, were making their way towards
the Grand Hall, and it seemed to me
that such a crowd, all sober (at any
rate, to the decanal eye), all well
dressed and well behaved, all honestly
interested in a competition of skill, were
creditable representatives of English
manhood.
The match, I may say at once, was
admirably contested. The play was
fast and even throughout. There was
not a dull moment, and now by one
player and now by the other the marker
was kept busy. -
For the benefit of those readers who
have never seen this fascinating game
I should explain that it is played on a
large green table by two players, each
armed with a long stick called, if I
may venture to say so, a cue. The
balls are three in number, two the
colour of lawn sleeves, and one, I regret
to say, recalling the hue of a Cardinal's
hat. One of the balls is a pure white,
the other, alas! my brethren, is spotted.
Ah, if only we— [Kindly keep to
the game, dear and right reverend Sir.
—ED. PUNCH.] The object of each
player, if I may put it thus crudely, is
to get the better of the other,
It was borne in upon me that bil-
liards, although I do not, I think,
recommend it as a pastime for school-
boys, would seem to be rising as cricket
is in danger of falling in popularity.
It must, I fear, be acknowledged that
cricket as it is now played is a less
attractive game than it used to be. The
faultless excellence of the pitches, the
accuracy of the bowling, and the prac-
tice of aiming at making a century by
any means, however tedious, render
cricket over after over an exceedingly
dull game to watch. None the less the
two games are strangely alike. Both
require, if I may say so, a green ground.
The ball at cricket is red. Now that
I come to think of it, the similarity
here seems to cease.
One word as to the spectators. The
crowd at Saturday's match showed, I
think, the true sporting spirit. They
applauded good play with almost equal
impartiality, whether it was the play
his rival. There was no unseemly
wrangling, no jumping on the table, or
stealing the chalk, or breaking the cues,
or displacing the balls, such as might
have occurred if – well, if manners
were less under control. Watching
them I was proud to be an English
amateur journalist.
As I surveyed the game I could not
help remembering similar contests in
which I had taken part myself in the
old days, when the Headmasters of the
great public schools had an annual
billiard tournament. I remember, as
though it were yesterday, a break of
5 (3 off the red and 2 by a superb
white winner) which I compiled in my
heat with the Headmaster of Eton,
and I could not help thinking that it
is a pity that the particular stroke by
which I used to effect most of my
scoring plays so small a part in the
first-class game. It is not easy to
describe it in print, but I may call it, if
a metaphor from another but less laud-
able English sport—that of racing—may
be permitted one, a stroke by Wrong
Policy out of Fortunate Chance. I re-
member during one of these matches,
when my favourite stroke was more in
evidence than usual, the Headmaster
of Winchester, an inveterate wag, said
that one of my cannons was too good
for such a commonplace name. “It
is a major cannon,” he said, “and
ought to be called a dean.”
And so, the necessary points having
been reached or some other cause
bringing the game to a close, I came
away breathing a silent prayer that all
English games might be equally well-
managed, and somewhat regretting that
I had not ascertained what players the
match was between or for how many
points. [That doesn't matter, my lord;
we have an ordinary common fellow to
do that. The scores were, INMAN 14063,

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
SouL-PANGS AND OTHER DIVERSIONs.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--The new thing
to suffer from is soul-pangs. Quite
almost everyone is having it. It's not
illness—and it's not nerves—it's just
soul-pangs. You begin by wondering
about things; then you go on wondering
about things; then you get disgusted
with people; and after that you get
disgusted with yourself; until at last,
in very bad cases, you get to asking
questions of yourself, and even of the
furniture in the room when you're
alone—such questions as “Why?” and
“What?” and “How?” and “Is every-
thing?” and then, dearest, you're in for "
it and must have a soul-doctor.
Soul-doctors aren't always, or even
often, real doctors—they're generally |
people. For instance, Lord Exshire and
Sir Gervase Oldacres have each made
quite a little reputation as soul-doctors.
When you consult one of them you
tell him that you've unusual feelings,
You !
and he tells you you haven't.

pangs! I'm wondering about things—
and I'm questioning myself—and I'm
absolutely thinking—I'm in an im-
mensely fearful state | " and the soul.
doctor looks into your eyes and holds
your hands firmly and says, “No
you're not; " and presently, my dear,
Jou're not l Isn't it simply marvellous? |
Sir Gervase Oldacres has been even
more successful than Lord Exshire with
his cases. I don't know that he'd
actually a greater gift, but Exshire has |
been hampered in his cures by his wife.
Anne Exshire will go with him to his
cases, and when he looks into the eyes
of the case and holds her hands Anne
pushes in and says, “Can't I do that?” |
There is a story that just as Exshire |
was willing away, with his eyes and ||
hands, the soul-pangs of a particularly
obstinate case Anne burst into the
room and slapped her!—and the soul-
pangs came back worse than ever.
Sir Gervase Oldacres had no wife to
interfere with his use of his gift, and |
he's done wonders. You notice, I said

particularly concerned about one of his
patients, Mrs. Meekly, a cousin of the
Flummerys, the quietest, most mouse-
like little nonentity of a widow. Hers
was a really terrible case. Not only
had she all the usual soul-pangs, but
she was thinking quite a quantity about
her husband who died a whole year
ago, and sometimes even remembered
quite vividly what he was like! We
persuaded her to consult Sir Gervase as
a soul-doctor, and he said it was the
most difficult and obstinate case he had
yet tried his will upon. When he was
holding her hands and willing with all
the power of his eyes (the traditional
Oldacres' eyes, large and grey with
black eyebrows), she still kept on saying
she could see her dear husband and
hear his voice, in spite of the soul-
doctor's reiterated “No, you can't.”
But it has turned out, my dear, that
she was right after all, for by-and-by
their engagement was announced, and

soul-pangs now / And, as no soul-doctor
can do anything in his own case, and,
of course, wouldn't ask help from a
rival, I suppose there's no hope for the
poor dear man.
I gave a dear little lunch party for
Mr. Tim Flanagan when he was in ||
London. Everyone was charmed with
him. He looked so really chic among
all the monotonous well-groomed people
around him. After lunch he went out
on the balcony and began to address
the passers-by, and soon there was an
immense mob outside. We all crowded
up to the windows to hear him, and he
was simply enormously amusing ! He
told the crowd what he'd had for lunch,
and he asked how dared we live in such
luxury; and he somethinged the lunch
and the wine; and he said we didn't
heed the writing on the wall, and was
a great mansion like the one he was
speaking from to be left in the posses-
sion of a man and a woman and some
flunkeys 2 No, it wasn't And he
invited any of the crowd who felt like
it to come right in and live in our
house and take whatever they wanted.
And the crowd laughed and cheered
again, and then the police dispersed
to come in and have tea, as his clever
speech must have made him very
thirsty. And all the lunch people
stayed to tea too, and before going
away they perfectly overwhelmed me
with congrats on having given such a
charming afternoon.
There's another burst-up at the
Thistledowns'. We're all quite a little
sorry about it. Fluffy, poor dear thing,
is a very much misunderstood little
woman. Only a short time ago, you
know, things were patched up there,
and there was a reconciliation, and
they arranged to live happy ever after.
They gave a very cheery reconcilly
dinner-dance, and we all gave them
presents, and altogether it was quite a
happy little second wedding. Their
gifts to each other were too sweet for
words. He gave her a complete set of
baby-tiger—coat, cap and muff. (Baby-
tiger is the last syllable of the last
word! To get even one baby-tiger costs,
I hear, several natives' lives, and such
a set as Fluffy's must account for dozens
of the little stripers. Of course, one's
sorry for the poor natives, but it gives
baby-tiger a cachet above all other
peltry.) Really and truly, my own
Daphne, I don't think I ever envied
Thistledown at the Newmarket Hough-
ton in her new set of baby-tiger. Her
cap had the baby-paws in front and the
tail sticking straight up at the back,
and the effect of eyes was got by two ||
immense topaz hat-pins. Her reconcilly
gift to him was a gold match-box with
her smile on the lid, surrounded with
brilliants, So everything seemed quite
comfy and charming at the Thistle-
downs', till one week-end Lord T. was
running over to Paris tout seul. Jack,
Hurlingham, Doody St. Adrian, and
some other men that he knew got into
the boat-train with him, and presently
Thistledown, preparatory to lighting
up, took out his new match-box, looking
complacently, no doubt, at . Fluffy's
smile on the lid. The box proved to be
empty, however; there was nothing
behind the smile—(some people have
said the same of Fluffy herself). Jack
and Doody and the others, seeing T.'s
matchless condition, simultaneously
took out their own match-boxes, prof-
fered them, then suddenly recollected
themselves and pocketed them again
in a hurry—but not before Thistledown
had seen them. My dear, every one of
those boxes was gold, with Fluffy's
smile surrounded with brilliants on

them, and I persuaded Mr.Tim Flanagan

windows and will enjoy accounting for
these. Which reminds me: we mustn't
forget to square the Police with a
promise of a share in the booty, must
we?) It will take us all the morning
and the first part of the afternoon to

perhaps, prefer it so. The objection is,
however, the number of guns, and I

STUDIES OF REVIEWERS.
II.--THE AUTobiographical.
This charming volume of literary
studies by Mr. Desmond Jubb has a
peculiar interest for me, because it
recalls that period—the happiest of my
life—in which I was privileged to be
his comrade and fellow student at
Balliol College, Oxford. For, in truth,
I can say more than Virgilium vidi
tantum. I not only saw Desmond
Jubb at lectures in Hall and on the
tow-path, where his clarion tones rang
out above all his contemporaries during
the torpids and eights, but I belonged
to the same wine club and wore the
same waistcoat-buttons. I shall never
forget the first time that I met him.
It was in the Michaelmas term and I
had returned a fortnight late, owing
to a rather severe attack of German
measles, from the sequelae of which
I still suffer in the shape of slightly
impaired hearing of the right ear. I
was hurrying out of college to order
some more brown 'sherry, a beverage
to which in those days I was much
addicted, when I ran violently into a
handsome young man with a high
forehead, wearing a rather outré tie.
I should explain that he was a fresh-
man, while I was already in my fourth
year; yet in this collision he at once
assumed the position of a senior,
gravely rebuked me for my precipitancy,
and then with irresistible bonhomie
invited me to lunch at Goffin's. Goffin's
shop, I should explain, was renowned
in those days for its marvellously fine
pork-pies, of which I was immoder-
ately fond, and I found that my new
acquaintance rendered equal justice
to their succulent qualities, albeit
not apparently endowed with the
same undefeated digestion as myself.
The conversation that took place is
indelibly imprinted on my memory.
I remember Jubb's observing what a
remarkably protean animal the pig
was, inasmuch as an entirely different
quality attached to various portions of
his anatomy, ham differing from bacon
and pork from brawn. He confessed
that the mere mention of pig's feet
filled him with horror, in which I
cordially concurred. That exquisite
fastidiousness which is so marked a
feature of these essays had thus already
declared itself. He was rather shocked
at my drinking shandy - gaff, while
admitting that the name had always
interested him. On this occasion, I
remember, he partook of cherry-brandy,
to correct, as he put it, the exuberance
of the pork-pie. He smoked two or
three cigarettes afterwards, and I
noticed that they were Russian, of the
THE SPARTAN MOTHER.
ettes had not yet come into vogue. He
told me that he got his ties from the
famous London house of Fraternity
and that they cost him 7s.6d. apiece,
and he was surprised to hear that I
only paid 1s. 11; d. for mine at Charity
Bros.
At the time, of course, I was not
aware that I was entertaining a literary
angel, and yet I felt that I was
exchanging ideas with one of the most
versatile and engaging of my fellow-
students. He was so perfectly frank
and ingenuous, so ebullient and yet so
reserved that I had a sub-conscious
feeling he must be marked out for
exceptional greatness. Desides his
taste in ties, I remember that he never
wore a mackintosh, though curiously
enough in wet weather I have often
seen him in goloshes. He resented
moment of expansion, addressing him
as “old chap,” and his replying, “I am
neither old nor a chap,” and when I
begged his pardon he kindly said,
“Granted, but don't let it happen
again.” At our wine club he always
sat at the other end of the table,
so that I seldom had the oppor-
tunity of speaking to him on these
occasions.
Unfortunately, I was obliged to leave
Balliol in the middle of my fourth
year owing to an attack of pernicious
squifies, and I have never met Des-
mond Jubb again. Our paths have lain
apart, but I was never surprised at
his meteoric rise to eminence in the
literary firmament, and I welcome this
charming volume as a rich fulfilment
of the early promise that he gave in
what I may call, not his salad, but his

FUTURISTIC FUN.
(Notice from “The Daily Iconoclast" for
November 21st, 1923.)
At last London has a “real theatre of wonder and of
records” on the principles laid down by the great Founder
of Futurism, Signor MARINETTI And, by a singular coinci-
dence, this notice appears exactly ten years to-day from the
date of publication of his epoch-making article, “The Mean-
ing of the Music-Hall,” in the columns of our contemporary
The Daily Mail 1 Needless to say that the entertainment
last night at the Pallidrome Theatre of Varieties was re-
ceived with delirious enthusiasm. Considerations of space
forbid us to mention every “turn" individually; we can
only particularise a few, though there was none that failed
to fulfil Signor MARINETTI's condition of success—the pro-
duction of “Futuristic wonder.”
The “synthetic combination of speed with transforma-
tion,” which, as he has taught us, is one of “the dominating
laws of life,” was luminously illustrated by a phenomenally
stout entertainer who with lightning rapidity peeled off
several successive garments of startlingly Futurist hues,
until he eventually revealed himself as a living skeleton,
an “absorbing and decisive symbol" which excited the
“torrents of hilarity” that the Master mentions as one of
the peculiar products of the Variety Theatre. Then, as
Signor MARINETTI so nobly recommended, “heroism and a
strong and healthy atmosphere of danger” were furnished
for the delighted spectators by a lofty trapeze act with bars
that had been so effectually soaped that one of the gymnasts
fell about sixty feet, fortunately landing on a member of the
orchestra who, till that moment, had been performing on
the ophicleide.
Next we were entranced by an artist who gave lifelike
imitations of a Buff Orpington hen being run over by
a motor-car, a beetroot in a state of incipient hysteria, and
a debased half-crown, thereby exemplifying what the High
Priest of Futurism terms “the profound analogies be-
tween the animal, vegetable, and mineral worlds, and
human beings.”
Following him came a couple who were described with
some aptness as “knock-about comedians,” and of them it
is only justice to state that, in Signor MARINETTI's memor-
able phraseology, “they pleasantly fanned the intellect
with a network of sprightly wit, doltishness, and foolery of
the deepest kind, till they insensibly urged the souls of their
hearers to the very edge of madness, and to participate
noisily in queer improvised dialogues.”
After that a highly instructive exhibition of another of
the dominating laws of life—“the interpretation of rhythm."
—was afforded by a lady who performed an impromptu and
daringly unconventional dance in a costume that, when
perceptible, was exquisitely diaphanous.
Then the two “Synthetic Sisters,” strangely seductive
with their Futurist green hair, blue necks, violet arms, and
orange chignons, sang a duet which, to quote once more
the illustrious Futurist philosopher, “brutally stripped
Woman of all the veils that mask and deform her,”
to the unspeakable edification of all the “adolescents and
young people of promise” present, for whom, as Signor
MARINETTI holds, “the Variety Theatre is the only school
to be recommended.”
But perhaps the wildest furore was evoked by a Topical
Singer, who, fulfilling what the immortal MARINETTI
declared to be the function of such artists, “explained
in swiftest, most striking manner the most mysterious,
sentimental problems of life and the most complicated
political events.” And all by a refrain that was a little
The “mechanical grotesque effects,” too, of an American
Eccentric, and his “methodical walk round after each
verse,” were deeply significant of things in general.
Sketches were interspersed—and such sketches | We
can give them no higher praise than to say that each and
all achieved the Marinettian ideal of “destroying all that is
solemn, sacred, earnest, and pure in Art,” and “decom-
posing such worn-out prototypes as the beautiful, the great,
and the religious.”
Altogether an historic evening. A show the like of which
this Metropolis has never before seen, palpitating with the
actuality and originality that are still so deplorably lacking ||
on the regular stage. And the audience, all of them imbued
to their finger-ends with “the new sensibility,” simply
“ate" it. There was nothing stupidly passive or static
about them—except in the case of spectators whose stalls
had, in accordance with Signor MARINETTI's recommenda-
tion, been liberally smeared with seccotine. - -
Owing to the fact that the Box Office had followed
another suggestion of his and sold the same seats to ten
different persons, there were, as he correctly predicted,
several “rows” during the performance, as “immense”
as the most unreasonable Futurist could wish for.
Perhaps, however, he was less inspired in the advice to
“allot free seats to ladies and gentlemen who are notoriously
cranky"—a practice which, we think, might well be aban-
doned in future. It is a regrettable fact that the inmates
of private lunatic asylums who had been given compli-
mentary tickets maintained a comparative self-restraint and
decorum that might well have damped the spirits of their
neighbours, had the latter been less completely under the
sway of what Signor MARINETTI aptly described as “the
great Futuristic Hilarity that shall rejuvenate the face of
the earth.” F. A.

Garkin and Larvin were wonderful men,
Each with an energy equal to ten;
Each was endowed with superlative vim,
Each was addressed by his cronies as “Jim.”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
If you care to hear a wise and kind old lady talking
pleasantly of the many interesting folk she has known
during a long and distinguished life, make haste to put
yourself in communication with Lady RITCHIE, who will
speak thus to you From the Porch (SMITH, ELDER). Wel-
come as this volume will be to all who love men and things
of good report, it can be greeted by none more warmly than
by Mr. Punch, for whom the name of the writer must
always recall some of his proudest associations. Lady
RITCHIE does not tell us much in the present book about
her great father, but there are many others of the famous
dead of whom we obtain new and happy pictures. For my-
self I found a peculiar interest in the paper called “Charles
Dickens as I remember him.” Here there is one little pen-
portrait that I cannot resist transcribing. The writer is
telling of the time when the families THACKERAY and DICKENs
were opposite neighbours in Paris. “One day I specially
remember, when we had come to settle about a drawing-
class with our young companion K. E. [DICKENs' daughter],
her father came into the room accompanied by a dignified
person—too dignified, we thought—who came forward and
made some solemn remark, such as Hamlet himself might
have addressed to Yorick, and then stood in an attitude in
the middle of the room. The Paris springtime was at its
height, there was music outside, a horse champing in the
road, voices through the open window, and Mr. Macready,
for it was he, tragic in attitude gravely waiting an answer.
suddenly responding with another attitude and another
oration in the Hamlet manner, so drolly and gravely, that
Macready himself could not help smiling at the burlesque.”
Does this little extract show you the original charm of the
book? I hope so. -
When your small nephew or niece replies to your question
on the subject of Christmas presents that he or she would
like a book this year, do not rush off to the nearest book-
shop and hunt through the shelves devoted to juvenile
literature, for that way madness lies. It is not good for
any uncle to be confronted suddenly by that blaze of colour.
Just stay at home and write to the shop as follows:
“DEAR SIR,-Kindly forward me at once Mr. H. DE WERE
STACPoole's adventure story, Bird Cay (WELLs GARDNER,
DARTON). One of Mr. Punch's Learned Clerks informs me
that it is an admirable story in every way.” Mr. STACPooDE
is, of course, at his best in describing stirring deeds in tropical
surroundings; but never before have I received so vivid an
impression of the atmosphere of those distant seas. His story
deals with a search for treasure buried on a desert island;
and when I say treasure I mean treasure—great chunks of
gold in brick form. The hero is a boy who stows himself
away on the treasure-hunting ship and has the satisfaction
of being the one who succeeds in actually unearthing (or
unsanding) the gold. It is this part of the book which
I count on to attract the young nephew. The story is a
little reminiscent of STEvenson's masterpiece; but, after all,
what does that matter? And if the villain is a shade dis-
appointing to admirers of John Silver he is nevertheless





Mr. Dickens seemed to have instantly seized the incongruity,
a pretty good villain, so that's all right.

Mr. MACDoNAGH has left nothing more to be said by known not to exist); how, when he had got it and made
later historians about The Reporters' Gallery (HopDER AND
Stoughton). In exhaustive, as distinct from exhausting,
manner he deals with the subject from two points of view
—the first, historical; the second, personal. Possibly the
latter part of his work, for which he is qualified by twenty-
five years of experience in the gallery, will be the more
popular, though the former has abiding interest, being the
result of painstaking study of the relations between Press
and Parliament going back to Stuart days. One of the
ordinances governing debate in the House of Commons
enjoins that a Member on his legs must not direct his speech
to the House or to any section of it. “This rule,” Mr.
MACDoNAGH testifies, “is as often broken as it is observed.”
Its breach is commonest in the case of Members rising from
one or other of the Front Benches. The Speaker in the
Chair is close at hand;
them and below the Gangways as far as the Bar. Strictly
to obey the order it would be necessary for them to turn
their backs on their audience. Instinctively it is their habit
to present that view to the Speaker's eye. Mr. GLADSTONE
their audience is seated behind
such a prodigious success of it that he could educate his son
to be a fine gentleman, that son won most events at the
school sports at Walshaw (a fictitious spot) by reason of his
having trained on the cinder track behind The Fighting
Cocks (a very actual public-house). Let it, however, not
be thought that Mr. Wouil's interest is purely local; his
observations, apply to all parts of the country wherever
is known that invaluable and never-to-be-sufficiently-
legislated-for entity, the working-man (Hear, hear), whom
he exposes and shows to be no better then the rest of
us (Shame). I was, I must say, surprised to find a son of
this so humbly originating cobbler almost entangled in a
dashing divorce case; but the fault of improbability is less
with this novel than with the others which have always
taught me to associate the pastimes of responding and
co-responding exclusively with the higher and less innately
virtuous classes.
On page 135 of The Pilgrim from Chicago (LoNGMANs)

I suppose, because he felt

merits of this quarter when, being forbidden to enter
the House, he addressed it from the Bar. The interest
of reporters in this matter is direct. Their gallery being
immediately over the Speaker's chair, speech addressed in
obedience to the rule reaches their ears. They suffer even
more than the Speaker when a Member turns his back on
the Chair. This is one of the particulars of Parliamentary
proceedings that Mr. MACDoNAGH makes clear to the under-
standing of the man in the street. I have touched upon
only one detail of his work, but the whole book is alluring,
and I advise every student of Parliamentary reports to get
it and read it through. He will find it equally entertaining
and instructive.
Most readers will thank Mr. GEORGE Wouiſ, for his
delightful Sowing Clover (LoNG), but such as live in
South Staffordshire will do so with a touch of suppressed
irritation. In a particularly graphic book he has done a
particularly tiresome thing, and that is, while making a
great point of his topography, to call some places by their
own and others by assumed names. He should have dealt
impartially with the whole Black Country, disguising all
or none; as it is, the native Black must be upset to read
how John Wittongate, the cobbler, made a house-to-house
canvass for work from Salop Street, Wolverhampton (which
pretence. In short, the
Chicago gentleman bored me. I felt all the time that
if I had the author to myself, content just to point out
things of interest and let me enjoy them, I should
spend a much happier time than as eavesdropper to the
frequently rather vapid conversation he exchanges with his
American friend. Perhaps I am ungracious. No doubt
there are many persons (I have a suspicion of their nation-
ality) who will prefer this method of imparting knowledge,
and for whom the cliché, so painfully frequent in Mr.
TEARLE's pages, will have no terrors. As it is for these
that the book has obviously been written its success should
be assured. It is only fair to add that even the most fasti-
dious reader will find in it a wealth of engaging speculation
and discovery, of which the scene is largely, though not
solely, London. Hunters of the Dickensian snark should
especially appreciate this book, above all for its wholly
admirable photographs, many of which deal with spots
that Mr. TEARLE has identified in the novels. He has
done this so cleverly that only the presence of the third
party aforesaid prevented me from being properly grateful.

should AN AUTHOR TELL;
It was a memorable morning on
which I found myself, in the waiting-
room of Mr. Silas K. Joshfeller's Variety |
Agency. Again and again I had as-
sured myself that, if one parson could
wake up the music-hall world with a
problem sketch, there was no reason
on earth why another member of the
Church should not meet with almost
equal success. So that my natural tre-
pidation was leavened by a measure
of self-confidence. And yet I had an
uneasy feeling that the little collection
of music-hall artistes saw me coming—
in the slang sense. Two men especially
I singled out, and I could have sworn
that I at once became the subject of
their whispered conversation. One of
these I took to be an American. He had
the usual sartorial features, including
a low-crowned felt hat, a suit not quite
as broad as long, and a pair of in-
describable boots. His companion was
a big Irishman, and appeared to be a
member of the hatless brigade. I
any man with such very musical hair
could well afford to dispense with head
covering.
With my wideawake and the book
of my sketch in one hand I was just
about to tap on the door marked “Pri-
vate ’’ with the other, when the Ameri-
can called out politely,
“Say, excuse me. I think you'll
find Mr. Josh feller's busy just now.”
“Oh, thank you,” I said, taking a
step in the speaker's direction and
realising that I had committed some-
thing approaching a breach of etiquette.
“How thoughtless of me,” I went on,
setting out to be friendly. “Of course,
all you ladies and gentlemen are also
waiting for an interview.”
“Waal, he's naat an easy man to
see,” replied the American. “I should
say a variety agent is somethin' like
your Aarchbishop of CANTERBURY to
git right hold of.” *
“Er—yes. With regard to the ARch-
Bishop,” I said, “I have never had the
pleasure. But I've no doubt it's an
apt comparison. Perhaps you could
tell me if they deal in sketches here?”
“I could naat. Sketches are naat in
my line. ... I'm a comedian. But see
here. What is this sketch you've
gaat? Is it sensational, cahmedy, or
What 2 ” ; , , , -
“Oh, it's—it's a problem sketch.”
“Is ut funny?” asked the Irishman.
“Oh, no. Quite serious,” I said.
Here was an opportunity of gaining an
unbiassed opinion, and, encouraged by
their interest, I showed them the script
and related the story in a few words.’
- “Sir,” said the American, when I had
finished, “that show would cause a riot
on a cannibal island.” 2 * *
“Ye'll be aſther wantin' a fortune
for ut?” asked the Irishman. .
“Oh, no. Quite a modest sum would
content me,” I said. “But I'm very
gratified to think you like the idea.”
“I’m thinkin' ut'll revolutionise the
music-halls,” said the Irishman. “Ye'll
want to use great caution the way ye
dispose of ut.” -- - - - - ,
“Yes, Sir ' " added the American.
“And listen here. I caan't let a man
of your cloth rush into vaudeville
without a woird of preparation, and
without tellin' you that there's some
store of disillusionment waitin' for any
stranger. All around you'll find things
are unreal. You'll see Hindoos that
are white men, Chinese that are Yanks,
comedians that caan't make you laaf,
and angelic-lookin' women that are
naat. For instance, if you've weighed
me up at all you guess I'm Amurrican.
Sir, you think I'm a genuine Yank.
Waal, I'm naat. I was born in Brixton,
and never been out o' this country. But
tell me you ain't shocked at that. Is
it not deception ? Do you, as a cloirgy-
man, think it's right?”
“The question you put me is a diffi-
cult one,” I answered after a moment's
thought. “I have come here to find
an opening for my sketch, and I realise
that if I join the ranks of your pro-
fession I must conform to its customs.
On the whole, I am inclined to take a
rather broad-minded view. - Perhaps if
I myself were in any way connected
with the Church—but, as a matter of
fact, I'm not.” -
The Brixton-American burst into a
roar of laughter at this statement.
The Irishman merely smiled a peculiar
smile and nodded his head. I some-
how felt very elated. It was as if I had
already proved my worth in another
sphere. The only tiny midge in my
ointment was the thought that the
Brixton-American combination rather
tended to detract from the originality
of my own enterprise. -: t
“You see,” I went on, trying to
speak with indifference, “if a real
parson can do this kind of thing, and
cause a public sensation with the help
of his clerical position, there seems to
be no reason why a bogus one should
fail. And I have no doubt that the
sight of a clergyman will considerably
impress a man of the variety agen
type. Now don't you, as music-hal
artistes, consider my idea rather in
genious?...Don't you think that, comi
pared with the ordinary ruse, it savours
of originality?” . . . . . i
* “Oh, say, I think it's cute,” said th
Brixton-American, and laughed: again
“Shpeakin' for meself,” remarked the
Irishman, the lines about his mouth
hardening - in a quite unaccountable
manner, “I’ll admit that yer cunning
does not appeal to me... There's de-
ception and deception. And ut's the
public, and not the agents, that ye’ve
got to deceive. Maybe if I was a
music-hall artiste—but I'm not. I'm
an agent. Me name's Silas K. Josh-
feller.” . . . . . - - - -
“Really 2” I said. “I hope you
will forgive my unfortunate intentions
towards yourself.” * -
“Ach! Your intintions and my

It has long been felt that something
should be done to facilitate the eating
of asparagus in public. There is noth-

only encloses the thumb and first finger,
and may be left in the finger-bowl if
preferred. Supplied in dozens. A most
appropriate and topical Christmas gift,

tennis shoes or parasol—till the proper

(NotE.-It has been suggested to us
that it might be a little awkward for
the diner - out to come to the table
wearing an Asparaglove when there
was no asparagus provided. This diffi-

by hostesses printing in the corner of
invitation cards the one word “Aspara-

and need not obtrude itself. N.B.-

“Do you tango?” asked Miss Hop-
kins, as soon as we were comfortably
seated. I know her name was Hopkins,
because I had her down on my pro-
gramme as Popkins, which seemed too
good to be true; and, in order to give
her a chance of reconsidering it, I had
asked her if she was one of the Popkinses
of Hampshire. It had then turned out
that she was really one of the Hopkinses
of Maida Vale.
“No,” I said, “I don't.” She was
only the fifth person who had asked
me, but then she was only my fifth
partner. -
“Oh, you ought to. You must be
up-to-date, you know.”
“I’m always a bit late with these
things,” I explained. “The waltz came
to England in 1812, but I didn't really
master it till 1904.”
“I'm afraid if you wait as long as
that before you master the tango it
will be out.” -
“That's what I thought. By the
• time I learnt the tango, the bingo
would be in. My idea was to learn the
bingo in advance, so as to be ready for
it. Think how you'll all envy me in
1917. Think how Society will flock to
my Bingo Quick Lunches. I shall be
the only man in London who bingoes
properly. Of course by 1918 you'll all
be at it.”
“Then we must have one together in
1918,” smiled Miss Hopkins.
“In 1918,” I pointed out coldly, “I
shall be learning the pongo.”
My next partner had no name that I
could discover, but a fund of conversa-
tion.
“Do you tango 2 " she asked me as
soon as we were comfortably seated.
“No,” I said, “I don't. But,” I
added, “I once learned the minuet.”
“Oh, they're not very much alike,
are they 2”
“Not a bit. However, luckily that
doesn't matter, because I've forgotten
all the steps now.”
She seemed a little puzzled and de-
cided to change the subject.
“Are you going to learn the tango 2 ''
she asked.
“I don't think so. It took me four
months to learn the minuet.”
“But they're quite different, aren't
they 2"
“Quite,” I agreed.
As she seemed to have exhausted
herself for the moment, it was obviously
my business to say something. There
was only one thing to say.
“Do you tango 2 " I asked.
“No,” she said, “I don't.”
“Are you going to learn ?”
it in Paris naturally led me to
“Ah!” I said; and five minutes later
we parted for ever.
The next dance really was a tango,
and I saw to my horror that I had
a name down for it. With some diffi-
culty I found the owner of it, and pre-
pared to explain to her that unfor-
tunately I couldn't dance the tango,
but that for profound conversation
about it I was undoubtedly the man.
Luckily she explained first.
“I’m aſ raid I can't do this,” she
apologised. “I’m so sorry."
“Not at all,” I said magnanimously.
“We'll sit it out.”
We found a comfortable seat.
“Do you tango?” she asked.
I was tired of saying “No."
“Yes,” I said.
“Are you sure you wouldn't like to
find somebody else to do it with ?”
“Quite, thanks. The fact is I do it
rather differently from the way they're
doing it here to-night. You see, I
actually learnt it in the Argentine.”
She was very much interested to hear
this.
“Really 2 Are you out there much 2

She was a very difficult person to
talk to. Her relations seemed to spread
themselves all over the place.
“Perhaps that is hardly doing justice
to the situation,” I explained again.
“It would be more accurate to put it
like this. When I decided—by the way,
does your family frequent Paris? No?

the tango, the fact that my friends

“The night is yet young, Norah.

brushes and a cigar-cutter.”

“Good. We'll do the new Fleet
Street movement together, the scissors-

and do the scissors, and I'll—er—stick

“Can't you really do any of it at all,
and aren't you going to learn?”
“I can't do any of it at all, Norah.
I am not going to learn, Norah.”
“It isn't so very difficult, you know.
I'd teach you myself for tuppence.”
“Will you stop talking about it for
threepence?” I asked, and I took out
three coppers.
“ No.”
I sighed and put them back again.
It was the last dance of the evening.
My hostess, finding me lonely, had
dragged me up to somebody, and I and
whatever her name was were in the
supper room drinking our farewell soup.
So far we had said nothing to each
other. I waited anxiously for her to
begin. Suddenly she began. t
“Have you thought about Christmas
presents yet?” she asked.
I nearly swooned. With difficulty I
remained in an upright position. She
was the first person who had not begun
by asking me if I danced the tango
“Excuse me,” I said. “I'm afraid I
didn't—would you tell me your name
again?”
I felt that it ought to be celebrated
in some way. I had some notion of
writing a sonnet to her.
“Hopkins,” she said; “I knew you'd
forgotten me.”
“Of course I haven't,” I said, sud-
denly remembering her. The sonnet
would never be written now. “We
had a dance together before.”
“Yes,” she said. “Let me see,” she

“GEORGE, old man,” said James,
drawing up his chair to my end of the
table, after Christine had gone out and
left us to our male pursuits, “I want a

I handed him the decanter and pre-
served a non-committal silence. The
sudden prominence of the phrase “old
man" in his conversation led me to
expect the worst.
He pulled his chair even closer and
stretched out an affectionate hand
towards me. I placed a cigar in it,

STUDIES OF REVIEWERS.
III. THE NEw ART CRITIC of
- THE TIMEs.
AMoNGST recent exhibitors at the
Neo-British Art League there are few
more arresting painters than Mme.
Strulda Brugh, yet even she has never
chosen a more radiantly intractable
theme than that of her “Pekinese
Puppies” (92). Her method is flatly
antipodean to that of the Congestionist
school represented by M. Pipposquillace
in that she deanthromorphizes her
scheme of pigmentation into nodules
of aplanatic voluminosity.
It is perfectly obvious that by the
evaluation of the subliminal factors
and the substitution of rhomboidal for
conical elasmobranchs, each bounded
by its own laminated penumbra, a
sense of pragmatic
serenity should result
as contrasted with the
stark jocosity of the
Congestionists. But it
is still more obvious
that if you press this
hypothesis to its logical
extreme and introduce
the whole-tone scale
of colour into a poly-
phonic pattern where
only conjunct chro-
matic progressions are
available, the conflict of
the equal and the un-
equal temperament
resolves itself into a tes- .
situra so rarefied that º

Mr. Marcellus Thom exhibits a large
fresco, “Sardine Fishers in the Adriatic"
(99), executed in creosoted truffle-stick,
which is a masterpiece of suppressed
yet dignified antinomianism. Wonder-
ful though the drawing and the inter-
filtration of co-ordinating paraboloids
are, it is the psychological content of
the picture rather than its direct
presentative significance which affects
the solar plerus of the enlightened
onlooker. The whole atmosphere is
summarised and condensed in a cir-
cumambient and oleaginous aura. We

commenced to destroy dust, and so
people lost faith in it.
My Clement—I call him my Clement
because he owed me all his prospective
income—although a loyal piano-tuner,
had tried his hand at several minor
pursuits. He failed at them all, which
does seem to bear out in a way the
truth of that superstitious old couplet.
Ah, I remember it now. It goes:–

perfectly well what the next word is.
It rhymes with one of those places
where QUEEN ELIZABETH stayed for
one night only, and in shape it is like
a banana. But the actual word escapes
me. However, I will think of it
presently. (If you're gone, I'll send
it to you on a postcard.)
Well, Clement tried for one thing to
be a dramatist. He wrote a play about
three generations. This was how he
mapped it out:—
Act I.-Pithecanthropus, 400,000 B.C.
Act II.-Anthropus, 1913 A.D.
Act III.-Hyperanthropus, 400,000 A.D.
His idea was to get someone to do
Act I., someone to do Act II. and SHAw
to do Act III., and give them a propor-
tion of the royalties. It all stopped at
the idea, however, and perhaps it was
as well.
Clement was in many ways unlucky.
In fact he used to say to me, “Sir, I
have an unlucky number.” This was
fourteen. There may be nothing in it,
but he died on the 21st (which, after
all, is ; of 14), had seven children
(which, after all, is # of 14), and was
exactly fourteen months in arrear with
the rent. Fourteen was his unlucky
break at billiards. He couldn't get
past it. He'd either make fourteen or
twenty-eight (which, after all, is just
twice fourteen) or something a mere
trifle more or less. There may be
nothing in it, of course, but he be-
lieved in it, poor chap, and he's gone
now. I remember his saying to me
when borrowing money, “Fourteen
pounds will be enough, Sir, but it's
unlucky. Make it fifteen.” I never
refused. For the sake of one pound
why deny him his whim?
I never knew such a happy family
man as Clement Clingenpeel. Some-
times he would even speak to his wife
at dinner, and her eyes would light up
with admiration and affection. When
he threw anything it was never the
bootjack. He would amuse the children
for hours by shaking the coppers out
of their money-boxes, and on their
birthdays he would measure their height

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHIARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S OWN INDIAN POET.
It is well known that Mr. Punch desires to keep abreast
cf all such literary movements as may clevate humanity by
purifying the more obvious emotions and throwing a veil
of poetry over the expression of thought. It is plain
that this object cannot be properly attained without the
possession of at least one highly qualified Indian poet ready
at all times to break into verse (or, as some might say, to
drop into poetry) on every subject that may conceivably be
treated through the medium of metre. Such an assistant
Mr. Punch has at last secured. It is not necessary that
this gentleman's name should be divulged. Mr. Punch's
word is a sufficient guarant e both for the poet's existence
and for his unimpeachable good faith in the discharge of
his poetical duties. Moreover, it is not to be supposed
that Mr. Punch would be willing to pay the substantial
honorarium to which he has committed himself unless
he had previously satisfied himself that his poet was the
genuine article.
After much consideration Mr. I'unch has decided not
to publish his poet's effusions in the original. It is a
characteristic of true Indian poetry that it should be as
effective in a prose translation as in its own language. It
is only necessary to add that Mr. Punch's corps of trans-
lators has all the best Rabindranath qualifications, and
that ther work may be depended upon to convey to English
readers all the simple mysticism and the plaintive out-
pourings which distinguish the votaries of the Indian muse.
In order to prove that he is not talking at random or
attempting to mislead his readers, Mr. Punch ventures to
append two specimens of his poet's work.
I.
A WomiAN IN THE Moon LIGHT.
The moon is shining as moons have sometimes shone
through hours that would otherwise have been devoid of
light. O pale moon, what art thou shining upon and
what becomes of thy beams when they have completed
their work of shining? Does the quiet pool absorb them 2
Nay, the pool sends them back with renewed brilliance.
Does the buffalo in the pasture fill his mouth with them
and use them as a cud to be chewed placidly 2 Not so,
for he has grass, which for the buffalo is better and more
palatable than moonbeams. Who then is this walking
with silver feet through the sleeping village 2
It is a woman, and to her the moonlight is as a home.
She has knees and ankles and arms—think of it, O my
heart : knees and ankles and arms. Silver bangles are
on her wrists and her hair is dusky with the kisses of the
south wind.
She approaches and her eyes gaze into the night.
What does she see in the night? Does she see my love
in the night while I myself am concealed behind the
wall? O wall of my safe concealment, let me cling to
thee while she passes.
O my fair one, thy veil is as an enchantment and the
turn of thy shoulder breathes mystery.
The moon has faded, and thou, too, last vanished, but
I will return and sing thy praises.
II.
TIE FLow ING OF THE RIVER,
My beloved is poised upon the river-bank with a
delicate poising. Waſt your favours to her, ye breezes,
and make her fair with all your gifts of beauty. If she
be not beautiful how shall she be sung 2 But she is
beautiful, with one foot dipped in the cool surface of the
When the soul is young it sings like a bird in the top-
most branches of the tree. Sing, thou careless bird, and
my soul shall sing too. But my soul can do more than
sing. My soul can fly, bearing a message. My soul can
skim along the river and can kiss the moist toes of her
dipped foot.
Lo, she raises her foot, for she has felt the kiss, though
it was light as the rustle of the tamarisk. Canst thou
kiss like that, O hard-beaked bird 2
The foregoing specimens are, in Mr. Punch's opinion,
sufficient for his purpose. Not only will they be appreciated,
he feels sure, by all readers who have refused to close their
minds to the appeal of a poetry which is at once sersuous
and refined and passionate and restrained, and which, with-
out sacrificing sound to sense, tends to raise those who read
it far above the harassing conventions of a life lived in
these islands; they will also, he has no hesitation in say-
ing, bring conviction to the soul of the most hardened and
contemptuous cynic.
THE SHIP'S KITTEN.
It was a barque that dropped down the river
For the Indies or the Isthmus, and it rained a bit and blew;
She had a cargo of deals to deliver
And the Tower Bridge was liſted to let her go through ;
“Hoo-oo,” said the syrens, “hoo-oo" and “hoo-oo,”
“The Ark she got her anchor up when early fell the dew";
Dut the little ship's kitten it stated to mew 1
When they got to the Bay the cook's bell tinkled,
Though the big seas they tumbled and the big seas they
rolled,
And through the rain squalls a lone beam twinkled,
Flashing and wheeling at night-time to behold.
“Ser-wosh,” said the great seas so black and so bold,
“The Ark made heavy weather we have always heard it
told";
And the little ship's kitten it let its tea get cold!
But when they got to the calm I'duator,
The sun was setting crimson, very hot and heathenish,
And the stars turned over, and the moon grew greater
Low on the yard-arm like a big gold dish ;
“Swish,” sighed the little seas, “ser-wish” and “ser-wish,”
“The Lord He sent an olive-branch to them that did
languish ";
And the little ship's kitten it caught a flying-fish.
And when they got back from the Indies or the Isthmus,
The Isthmus or the Indies, whichever they'd been at,
They'd not seen the Thames since t'other side of Christmas,
And the Tower Bridge rose end-ways that lay down so
flat ;
“Hoo-oo,” said the syrens, “how's that 2" and “how's
that 2 ''
“We've sailed the Flood a twelve-month and we're fain
for A 'arat,”
And the little ship's kitten had grown to a cat'

Small Daughter of Fortune (as third trolley goes by). “I REALLY THINK, MUMMY, IT MUST BE soMEBody's BIRTHDAY.”
THE WILL.
Mr. Gannaway was an elderly mer-
chant who lived in one of the large
outlying towns in the South of London.
Let us call it Troydon. Every day he
went up to town by the 8.43; every
evening he returned by the 6.15. His
house was only a few yards from the
station.
Mr. Gannaway was an ordinary per-
son in most ways, but he had a
peculiarity. He could not bear noise,
and day by day he noticed that the
Troydon railway men were becoming
noisier. The porters and inspectors
banged the doors with more abandon
than of old, the engine-drivers let out
steam with a more shattering roar and
whistled louder than they had ever
done, while the shunting at night had
become an outrage.
Mr. Gannaway did not want to leave
his house, nor was he sufficiently
superior to other people's laughter to
adopt ear-flaps, as HERBERT Śrºscºn
used to do, on the platform and in the
train. He therefore, like a wise man,
hit on a ruse . . . -
“Do you happen to have seen to-
more talkative of the inspectors one
morning.
“No, Sir," he said. “I’ve got it, but
I haven't had time.”
“There's a curious thing in it that
ought to be interesting to some of you
here,” said Mr. Gannaway, and passed
On.
The inspector took the earliest oppor-
tunity of searching the paper for the
item. He found it at last under the
heading
TRoydon RESIDENT's STRANGE WILL.
The article ran thus:–
“A legal correspondent, who states
that he is committing no breach of
etiquette in thus divulging information
acquired professionally, tells us that he
has just drawn up a very interesting
will for an infirm and elderly lady who
occupies rooms in a house on the out-
lying Rawson Estate. So much did
she once suffer from nerves due to
reckless noises made by various forms
of workmen—clumsy railway porters
who bang doors that could as easily be
shut quietly, careless engine - drivers
who overdo their whistling and make
their brakes scream, and so forth—to
health in the past years, that she has
determined to devote some of her great
wealth to an attempt to abate this
nuisance.
“Believing that charity should begin
at home, she has set apart a consider-
able sum as the nucleus of a fund, the
interest on which is to be distributed
every Christmas by the station-master ||
among the railwaymen of Troydon if,
in the opinion of six regular passengers
to be selected by him, the improvement
in the noise nuisance merits it. Other-
wise the money is to be applied to
other purposes which she names.
“Since making this will,” the article
ended, “we regret to hear the lady was
taken worse and now lies in a pre-
carious state, so that the provisions of it
may too soon be operative.”
“That's a bit of all right,” said the
inspector, and passed the news about
for the rest of the day. The result was
that the station gradually became a
much more civilised place and Mr.
Gannaway has lost that worried look.
The lady is still alive. Every effort
to find out who she is has failed; but
the railway staff believe in her abso-
lutely, which is more than Mr. Gann-

LUCK.
Thou that hast baffled many an earnest thinker,
Strange Power, whose wayward fancies none may
guess, -
That canst o'errule the great, or idly tinker
With trifling men in equal freakishness,
Thou that dost one hour ban, another bless,
More dour than thunder, brighter than the sun,
O Luck, O sovereign Luck, thee to address
Has long been my desire, mysterious one,
And now, I think, I see my way to get it done.
I am not of the narrow heirs of Science
Who, with a high contempt that nothing awes,
Deny thee flatly, in serene defiance
Of aught that reigns beyond her formal laws;
Who, when they profit for no seeming cause,
Ascribe it to their own deserts and skill,
Yet, when some looked-for gift eludes their jaws,
Turning, they mourn their luck with right good will,
Nor bless thee for the good, but damn thee for the ill.
And there be some who, finding thee capricious
Beyond all hope, assume a cold neglect
Of thy dark forces which, if thou wert vicious,
Would rouse thee probably to some effect.
I join them not; nor yet that wider sect
Who, viewing thee in undisguised alarm,
Offer their worship with an awed respect,
With strict observance due and solemn charm
Which, if it does no good, they hope will do no harm.
These in their little lives are ever flustered
By signs and portents sombre as the tomb;
They find them in a magpie or the mustard;
Upon their path a ladder casts a gloom
As of a cypress; some there are for whom
The dawn of Friday has an evil eye,
And Thirteen is a number great with doom;
There is no rite too strange for these to ply,
And they might save their time for all they get thereby.
For I, that long have sought thee in thy doings,
Have noticed how the wildest votary came,
For all the pious ardour of his wooings,
Out in the end to pretty much the same
As he that paid no honour to thy name.
Here thou wouldst frown, and haply there wouldst smile,
And one would lose, or win, his little game,
Till I, that searched thee out, for quite a while
Had well-nigh giv'n thee up, thou wast so volatile,
Yet there is this wherein I judge thee surely.
For thou art female; by these very traits
Female, and therefore one may swear securely
Ripe to be wooed, if one could only raise
The proper system. I for many days -
Iſave pondered on this matter, and I ween
That thou art tired of too obsequious ways,
And seekest, even as seeks a weary queen,
Simply by way of change, a decent 'twixt and 'tween.
Wherefore I step me forth to woo thy favour.
Withholding not thy fair and rightful due,
I do not with crude flatteries beslaver
Thy sick and female soul, as others do.
The rites that I enjoin are strict but few—
Enough to win thy notice, not to pall:
I turm my coppers when the moon is new ;
No peacock plumes affront my sober hall
Thus, then, O Luck, to-day I lay before thee
An opportunity thou long hast lacked
To pour thy horn on one that does not bore theo
Or hold thee light, and is, in point of fact,
A worthy object for some graceful act.
I would not specify the royal boon,
But leave it to thy dormant sense of tact;
Fame, Love, and Money make a good Triune;
These would suffice at first; and kindly send them soon.
DUM-DUM.
A FREE EXCHANGE OF VIEW.
I ovo IIT to say at the start that Robinson and I are not
the leaders of our respective political parties, but we share
with them some of the foibles of our common humanity.
“Hadn't we better sit down and talk this matter over
together, and try to come to some agreement?” said
Robinson, as he got up and put on his overcoat. -
“The sooner the better, the sooner the better,” said I,
and left the room very hurriedly.
I saw him again next day, for our trams met on the
Embankment. I was pleased to notice that he had not
forgotten his conciliatory proposal, for just as we passed
each other he leaned over the top and called out, “When
shall we meet 2"–but unfortunately he was out of ear-
shot while I was still trying to find the place in my diary.
It was Saturday afternoon before I came across him
again. I was playing to the 13th hole, and as he was
bunkered at the 9th I cannot have been more than 50 yards
away. “What about that talk?" I shouted. I saw the
sand fly vigorously and his mouth move, but I am a
purist in these matters and do not consider an expletive
as good as an appointment. -
Later in the evening he passed my house in a motor.
I was not there, but the lodgekeeper told me that he
had not exactly stopped, but “had slowed up like, and
thrown out his card.” The card had “Better come and
see me” pencilled in one corner, and “Mind the dog”
in another. -
So I got out my monoplane on Sunday and flew across
his grounds. I lipped the lip four times in succession,
and at the conclusion of a long fanciful flight, in which I
F. myself and the whole situation repeatedly upside down,
dropped an explosive on his dog-kennel from a distance
of 1,000 feet. I did not alight, for Robinson was not
visible, and he would, of course, quickly understand that
I had as good as called.
That is how the position stands at the moment, but
it is something to know that we are alike in our desire to
meet, and when we do I am sure we shall arrange some-
thing, for we are sensible men,
There is to be a dinner in Southport to some of the local
boatmen and fishermen. Says The Southport Visiter: —
“The dinner will be succeeded by a social. The Mayor hopes to
attend some portion of the proceedings. At the close of the gathering,
Mr. Jno. Barrington has generously volunteered to convey the men
to their homes.”
We hope that in many cases his services will not be wanted.

scene of his exploits is not the crowded haunts of civiliza-
tion, but the vast forests of Canada.” The latter statement
may be accepted as correct, but the former betrays a note
of pardonable prejudice, for, although the tales of this
detective of the woods gain freshness from their setting,
they are in essence not extraordinarily original. Where
Mr. PRICHARD has really scored a big point is in making
his tracker a most magnetic personality, so magnetic in
fact that my mischievous desire to see him beaten gradually

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. "[December 17, 1913.
A VISION OF IRELAND'S
ARMAGEDDON.
THE armies met just outside Dublin.
The Orange Army drew itself up on
one side—the Green Army on the
other, whilst the O'Brienite Army split
itself into two sections so as to be able
to take either army in flank. A great
blare of trumpets announced the arrival
of the Political Purity Army. General
BELLoc turned to it and said,
“GILBERT and CECIL, there has been
no such day since I led the guns at
Gravelotte.” *
In the forefront of the Orange Army
rode Colonel Rowland HUNT in a
motor car with scythe-blades fixed to
its wheels. Beside him stood the in-
spiring figure of the Duke of NoitroLK,
bearing a huge Orange banner, which
he waved defiantly at Colonel the Rev.
SILvrºster Horse of the Green Army,
who was brandishing a flag with a
portrait of CROMwFLI, and the legend,
“Keep the Priest out of the Schools.”
Colonel GARVIN headed four Orange
columns and ever and anon looked
dubiously at his command. “Three
columns more,” he murmured, “and we
should be over the page.” General “TAY
PAY" wrote his last sketch on the top
of a maxim. “If I should fall,” he
whispered to General Deylin, !" write
me as one who soaped his fellow-men.”
! Marshal CARsoN viewed the bpposing
legions with calm, even when He tore
open a telegram and read, “Will try to
be in time for battle, but must get

MARLBorough over first.—F. E. Smith,
General.” Marshal CARSON spurred
his horse forward, and NApoleoN RED-
Mond rode forth to meet him. -
“Blood!" said Marshal CARson.
“Gore!" replied the Irish Napoleon.
“No compromise!” cried the Marshal.
“Victory or death !” came the stern
reply. * - tº . * . . . .
“How few of these will see another
day,” said the Marshal sadly.
“Alas, that it cannot be settled by
single combat,” returned NApoleoN
REDMoND. “Why should Irish blood
be shed 2 Cannot ‘TAY PAY' and
GARVIN, both practically Saxons, fight
it out together?”
“We are here to shed blood, not ink,”
said the Marshal.
NApoleoN REDMOND drew himself up.
“Then we must march over your dead
bodies to Belfast.”
“Nay, we shall march through a sea
of blood to Cork.”
“I am about to
said NAPOLEoN.
“In another moment I shall draw my
sword and throw away the scabbard,”
give orders to begin,”
“To give my fellow-Irishmen to the
sword is a painful thing.”
“I hate to encrimson the green sods
of old Ireland.”
“But the reporters are all waiting.”
“They are. REDMoND, promise me
one thing. You will vow not to spare
the Press in the coming conflict 2"
“No mercy. GARVIN has seen his
last sunrise.” :
“I will cut down ‘TAY PAY' with
my own hand. Ibut what is this?”
Another motor-car darted into the
aliena. - -
“'Tis the infamous BIRRELL,” gasped
the Marshal.
“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” wailed the
IRIsh SECRETARY, “one word, I beseech

yo No compromise!” cried the leaders
simultaneously.
“Listen, listen. The Larkinite Army
is besieging Guinness's Brewery.”
“God save Ireland!” gasped both
the great captains.
“CARSoN,” cried NApoleoN REDMOND,
falling on his neck,-" CARSox, we must
save the country together. Three
cheers for KING WILLIAM and CROM-
wrif.-Come, let us address our armies.
Where are the megaphones? You speak

“Belovéd Protestant brethren, cried
NAPoleóN REDMOND, waving a Union
Jack," in time of peril all Irishmen are
one. Guinness's Brewery is in danger.
Advance with your fellow-countrymen
and save it from the thirsty foe.” Come,
my brave prentice lads of Derry, and
follow my flag to victory.”
“Tellow Irishmen,” shouted the
Marshal, “in the name of the glorious
Fenians, the loyal Clan-na-gael, and
the noble army of Ancient Hibernians,
follow the green flag I wave. Guinness's

“In the name of temperance, halt!”
cried Colonel the Rev. SILVESTER
HoRNE.
“Charge, the Heavy Brigade!" roared
Marshal BELLoc, and the only objector
was crushed to the earth. Away
rushed the armies, fraternising together,
interchanging flags, all alike eager to
get to Dublin before the besieged fort-
ress fell, or at least immediately after.
Colonel Rowlan D HUNT was the
solitary warrior left on the open field.
“What would BoADICEA do under
these circumstances?” cried the Colonel.
He answered his own question by

about their business weeping silently 2

Having lauded the victor and dealt
suitably with the vanquished, it was the
duty of the halfpenny papers to look
about for another lºnglishman who
would enter the ring with the French
boxer and readjust the balance of power.
They looked in vain towards the uni-
versities; they searched the army with
disappointment; even among the ranks
of our gallant sporting journalists, who
so bravely said what they thought of

over, not one was found worthy to

For ºur part, we are not without

There is one sphere in which inquiry

which has darkened the life of the
nation for the past eight days, a gallant
son of the Church, none other than the
Bishop of LoNDoN, was issuing a sort of
challenge to any of his audience of his
own age to play with him. CARPENTIER
has shown that boxing is play, not
merely stripling's play, but child's
play. : What advantage the French lad
may possess in years is counterbalanced
by the Bishop's wide experience and
depth of learning. We suggest to
Lord LoNSDALE that he could do many

M. ANATOLE FRANCE AT THE
PALL MALL THEATRE.
I HAD the pleasure of being present
last Thursday night at the compli-
mentary reception given to M. ANA-
ToI.E FRANCE, the famous French
littérateur, by Sir Seebohm Forest in
the dome of the Pall Mall Theatre.
Many well-known figures in the London
literary world found their way into the
reception room, including Miss Carrie
Morelli, Mrs. Annie Duck, Sir Clement
and Lady Longeri'th'arm, Mr. Winy-
mann, the famous publisher, Sir Knight
Prescott, the Rev. Claudius Clear, Dr.
Marcus Corker, the Rev. Sir Silvester
Ivory, Professor Jesse Blogg, and Sir
Nicholson Roberts, whose keen intel-
lectual face would attract attention
| anywhere.
It was disappointing not to see the
ever genial countenance of Mr. EDMUND
GossE, so usual a feature at all gather-
ings of this kind, but he was, I was
told, saving himself for the greater
dinner to M. FRANCE, who has always
been one of his protégés, at the
Alsace Hotel. As some compensation,
gladiator and ami de France, Mr. T. P.
O'Connor, was present.
Sir Seebohm Forest, who, I regret to
say, looked somewhat pale and weary,
made a charming speech in proposing
the health of the guest, which, in
deference to the views of the majority
of those present, was drunk in dry
ginger - ale. His comments on the
literary merits of M. ANATOLE FRANCE
were, so far as I could hear, remarkably
happy and in perfect taste, and the
comparison of his style with that of
Mr. L. N. PARKER was a striking proof
of Sir Seebohm's appreciation of native
letters. I thought that M. ANATOLE
France, who had just attended a perform-
ance of Sir Seebohm Forest's great
spectacular drama, Jacob and Esau,
wore a slightly enigmatic expression. It
was certainly a little unfortunate that
in the hurry of introduction he had mis-
taken Sir Nicholson Roberts for Lord
RoBERTs, with whom, as a pronounced
anti-militarist, he could not be expected
to feel much sympathy. Otherwise the
evening passed off most pleasantly.
M. FRANCE's reply was a masterpiece
of delicate elocution, but, alas! I caught
too little of what he said. I gathered,
chiefly as a country in which the Non-
conformist literary conscience was
never hampered by the restrictions of
public opinion, and that, as a student
of imperial Rome, he rejoiced to find
the Apocolocyntosis of CLAUDIUs per-
petuated in the luminous pages of The
British Weekly. It was to him pecu-
liarly touching that the very flower of
contemporary English literature of the
weightier variety should have been
thus culled for him by his gifted host.
To be in such a company was the
highest honour he could conceive.
It was pretty to see M. FRANCE saying
good-night to Miss Carrie Morelli.
There were many graceful bows on
both sides. Somehow M. FRANCE made
another speech, in which I understood
him to say that while Greece boasted
her SAPPHo and China her DowAGER-
EMPRESS, England could proudly point
to the literary triumphs and enormous
emoluments won and earned by Carrie
Morelli, who combined the tropical
exuberance of the Italian temperament
with the high ideals of English Puri-
tanism. There was more popping of

A FEW TRICKS FOR CHRISTMAS.
(In the manner of many contemporaries.)
Now that the “festive season" (copy-
right) is approaching, it behoves us all
to prepare ourselves in some way to
contribute to the gaiety of the Christ-
mas house-party. A clever conjurer is
welcome anywhere, and those of us
whose powers of entertainment are
limited to the setting of booby-traps or
the arranging of apple-pie beds must
view with envy the much greater tribute
of laughter and applause which is the lot
of the prestidigitator with some natural
gift for legerdemain. Fortunately there
are a few simple conjuring tricks
which are within the reach of us all.
With practice even the clumsiest of us
can obtain sufficient dexterity in the
art of illusion to puzzle the most obser-
vant of our fellow-guests. The few
simple tricks which I am about to ex-
plain, if studied diligently in the
week remaining before Christmas, will
make a genuine addition to the gaiety
of any gathering, and the amateur
prestidigitator (if I may use that word
again) will find that he is amply re-
paying the hospitality of his host and
hostess by his contribution to the
general festivity. -
So much by way of introduction. It
is a difficult style of writing to keep
up, particularly when the number of
synonyms for “eonjuring ” is so
strictly limited. Let me now get to
the tricks. I call the first
HOLDING THE LEMON.
lºor this trick you want a lemon and
a pack of ordinary playing cards.
Cutting the lemon in two, you hand
half to one member of your audience
and half to another, asking them to hold
the halves up in full view of the com-
pany. Then, taking the pack of cards
in your own hands, you offer it to a
third member of the party, requesting
him to select a card and examine it
carefully. When he has done this he
puts it back in the pack, and you seize
this opportunity to look hurriedly at
the face of it, discovering (let us say)
that it is the five of spades. Once more
you shuffle the pack; and then, going
through the cards one by one, you will
have no difficulty in locating the five of
spades, which you will hold up to the
company with the words “I think this
is your card, Sir"—whereupon the
audience will testify by its surprise and
appreciation that you have guessed
correctly.
It will be noticed that, strictly
speaking, the lemon is not a necessary
adjunct of this trick; but the employ-
ment of it certainly adds an air of
illusion, and this air of mystery is,
after all, the chief stock-in-trade of the
successful conjurer. -
For my next trick, which I call
THE ILLUSORY EGG,
and which is most complicated, you
require a sponge, two table-cloths, a
handful of nuts, a rabbit, five yards of
coloured ribbon, a top-hat with a hole
in it, a hard-boiled egg, two florins and
a gentleman's watch. Having obtained
all these things, which may take some
time, you put the two table-cloths
aside and separate the other articles
into two heaps, the rabbit, the top-hat,
the hard-boiled egg, and the handful of
nuts being in one heap, and the ribbon,
the sponge, the gentleman's watch and
the two florins in the other. This being
done, you cover each heap with a table-
cloth, so that none of the objects be-
neath is in any way visible. Then you
invite any gentleman in the audience
to think of a number. ... Let us suppose
he thinks of 38. In that case you ask
any lady in the audience to think of
an odd number, and she suggests (shall
we say?) 29. Then, asking the com-
pany to watch you carefully, you—
Oul——
To tell the truth, I have forgotten
just what it is you do do, but I know
that it is a very good trick, and never
fails to create laughter and bewilder-
ment. It is distinctly an illusion worth
trying, and, if you begin it in the man-
ner I have described, quite possibly
some way of finishing it up will occur
to you on the spur of the moment. By
multiplying the two numbers together
and passing the hard-boiled egg through
the sponge and then taking the . . . or
is it the- Anyway, I'm certain you
have to have a piece of elastic up the
sleeve . . . and I know one of the
florins has to — No, it's no good, I
can't remember it.
But mention of the two numbers
reminds me of a trick which I haven't
forgotten. It is a thought - reading
illusion, and always creates the maxi-
mum of wonderment amongst the audi-
ence. It is called
THE THREE QUESTIONS.
As before, you ask a gentleman in
the company to write down a number
on a piece of paper, and a lady to
write down another number. These
numbers they show to the other guests.
You then inform the company that you
will ask any one of them three ques-
tions, and by the way they are answered
you will guess what the product
of the two numbers is. (For instance,
if the numbers were 13 and 17, then
13 multiplied by 17 is—let 's see,
seven threes are twenty-one, seven,
times one is—well, look here, let's sup-
pose the numbers are 10 and 17. Then
the product is 170, and 170 is the
number you have got to guess.) .
Well, the company selects a lady to
answer yourquestions, and the first thing
you ask her is: “When was Magna
Charta signed?”
that she doesn't know. Then you say,
“What is the capital of Persia?” She
answers Timbuctoo, or Omar Khayyam,
according to how well informed she is.
Then comes your last question: “What
makes lightning?” She is practically
certain to say, “Oh, the thunder.”
Then you tell her that the two numbers
multiplied together come to 170.
How is this remarkable trick per-
formed 2 It is quite simple. The two
people whom you asked to think of the
numbers are confederates, and you
arranged with them beforehand that
they should write down 10 and 17. Of
course it would be a much better trick
if they weren't confederates; but in
that case I don't quite know how you
would do it.
I shall end up this interesting and
instructive article with a rather more
difficult illusion. For the tricks I have
already explained it was sufficient that
the amateur prestidigitator (I shall only
say this once more) should know how
it was done; for my last trick he will
also require a certain aptitude ſor
legerdemain in order to do it. But a
week's quiet practice at home will give
him all the skill that is necessary.
THE MYSTERIOUS PUDDING
is one of the oldest and most popular
illusions. You begin by borrowing a
gold watch from one of your audience.
Having removed the works, you wrap
the empty case up in a handkerchief
and hand it back to him, asking him
to put it in his waistcoat pocket. The
works you place in an ordinary pudding
basin and proceed to pound up with
a hammer. Having reduced them to
powder, you cover the basin with
another handkerchief, which you
borrow from a member of the com-
pany, and announce that you are about
to make a plum-pudding. Cutting a
small hole in the top of the handkerchief
you drop a lighted match through the
aperture; whereupon the handkerchief
flares up. When the flames have
died down you exhibit the basin,
wherein (to the surprise of all)
is to be seen an excellent Christ-
mas pudding, which you may ask
your audience to sample. At the
same time you tell the owner of the
watch that if he feels in his pocket he
will find his property restored to him

covers that the works in some mys-
terious way have got back into his
watch, and that the handkerchief in
which it was wrapped up has gone!
Now for the explanation of this in-
genious illusion. The secret of it is
that you have a second basin, with a
pudding in it, concealed in the palm of
your right hand. At the critical mo-
ment, when the handkerchief flares up,
you take advantage of the excitement
produced to substitute the one basin
for the other. The watch from which
you extract the works is not the
borrowed one, but one which you have
had concealed between the third and
fourth fingers of the left hand. You
show the empty case of this watch to
the company, before wrapping the
watch in the handkerchief and handing
it back to its owner. Meanwhile
with the aid of a little wax you
have attached an invisible hair to
the handkerchief, the other end of it
being fastened to the palm of your left
hand. With a little practice it is not
difficult to withdraw the handkerchief,
by a series of trifling jerks, from the
pocket of your fellow guest to its resting
place between the first and second
fingers of your left hand.
One word more. I am afraid that
the borrowed handkerchief to which
you applied the match really did get
burnt, and you will probably have to
offer the owner one of your own instead.
That is the only weak spot in one of the
most baffling tricks ever practised by
the amateur prestidigitator (to use the
word for the last time). It will make a
fitting climax to your evening's enter-
tainment—an entertainment which will
ensure you another warm invitation
next year when the “festive season”
(copyright) comes upon us once again.

(In his trap shortly after an early
breakfast.)
(To himself) Well, I'm in for it.
Don't know what in the world induced
Sir John to ask me to this show. The
last day of the cover shoot is a pretty
sudden jump from the annual garden
party which has always represented
the extent of our social intercourse.
Shall certainly have to do my best to
play up. . A hard-working beggar like
me, who has no time to shoot seriously,
can't expect to be in the running with
these experts. However, it's a mere
toss-up. Depends very much upon how
we are placed. A lot can go on at a
cover shoot that no one ever sees. And

Ah, yes. (To himself) That was a

me the shot I could have told him.

I wonder if woodcock do “come in " ?
Always supposed they did. (In reply
to an observation of his companion's)
Yes, nice warm covers. (To himself)
Wish I knew how one cover contrives
to be warmer than another; should
have thought that depended on the
weather. Shall have to find out about
that. (Moves on.)
Here comes Bowker. Know he's
going to ask me what charge I use.
I'll have to get beforehand with him.

SHADEs of the great, what make you in this hall,
Here where the British bays that erst you wore
Are by the Frenchman's ruthless hand defaced 2
Lo, how they lie in ruin on the floor,
Each leaf a separate mark of impotence,
And every broken twig a fount of tears.
Shades of the great, what make you in this hall 2
Then JACKSON veiled his agitated eyes,
And passed in silence; RANDALI, bowed his head,
And drooped his difficult and ravaging hand;
And CRIBB and BENDIGo and KING were mute;
And SAYERS averted his too mournful gaze,
That SAYERs who held his own the long day through,
Spite of his shattered arm, and came to time
Again and yet again, and would not yield,
While with one dauntless fist he struck and bunged
The bold Benicia Boy's discoloured eyes.
And other Shades there were of lusty men
With flattened noses and with thickened ears,
Men who while yet the blood coursed through their veins
Had dealt and taken many a crashing blow
On face and ribs and chest and on the mark,
The much-desired uncomfortable mark—
Whose peepers had been closed, whose kissing-traps
Brawny, bull-necked and muscle-covered men,
With beefy fists and deadly driving arms—
All these were there and all were very low.
Shades of the great, what make you in this hall?
At last the Spirit of British Boxing spoke,
And he was cheerful, on his open brow
No frown was seen, nor sadness in his eyes:—
“If hearts ye have, lift up,” he said, “your hearts;
Let not your manly minds be steeped in woe.
'Tis true CARPENTIER beat the Bombardier,
Jabbing him six times shortly in the stomach,
So that he fell and swift was counted out.
But this CARPENTIER is a proper man;
And you, old heroes, you may well be proud
To own a hero, though he comes from France.
And it may hap that on another day
Some beef-fed British boxer shall arise,
Cool in his guard and crafty in his blows,
Lithe and enduring as CARPENTIER is,
And turn the changing tables on the Gaul.
Dame Fortune shifts her smiles, but gives them most
To those who by their toil deserve them well.”
So spoke the Spirit, and the thronging Shades,


Had rained to earth their fragmentary teeth—
Won o'er to cheerfulness, acclaimed his words.

AN ACADEMIC DISCUSSION.
IN such time as she can spare from
the frivolities of life, Matilda runs a
school. As she believes in “keeping
things separate,” the frivolities are not
permitted access to the school or to
Matilda in her capacity as school-
mistress. Thus when I (who am one
of her frivolities) presented myself I
was refused admission. So I must
needs resort to subterfuge, and disguise
myself as a father with children to
educate. Incidentally, I am no father
and know little or nothing of children.
Side-whiskers, an artificial complexion,
and a falsetto voice completed my in-
cognito. A borrowed visiting card
gained me admission.

“Not directly.”
“In my young days there used to be
a person in vogue called Euclid. Is he

“No, he has gone.”

“I suppose they couldn't manage on
less—take turns to eat, so to speak?"
“I think not.”
“You supply everything else —

them to have all these things properly.”
“We cannot guarantee disease. In-

“That is one of
my objects in keep-
ing a school.”
(Matilda was not
helping me much.)
“Are they boys or
girls?”
“Both,” I said.
“Boys mostly—
two boys, in fact,
and a girl. Does
that matter?”
“I take both
boys and girls.”
“That relieves
my mind. I should like them all to be
together. Iam looking for some one who
will be a mother to my orphan children.”
“They have no mother?” said Matilda
sympathetically.
“None of them. Forgive me, but
you look a little young for the post.”
“How old are they?"
“Seven.”
“All of them 2 "
“All but two. The others are either
less or more. Let us say they average
seven.”
“As you please. You would like to
see over the school 2"
We visited the playing fields, gym-
nasium and other appliances for physical
culture. At last I asked—
“Is any provision made for mental
gymnastics?”
“Of course we don't neglect the mind.

(After hearing “Hänsel und Gretel” for the fifteenth time.)
How strange that modern Germany, so gruesome in her art,
Where sheer sardonic satire has expelled the human heart,
Should also be the Germany that gives us, to our joy,
The perfect children's opera—pure gold without alloy.
I know there are admirers of the supra-normal STRAUss
Who hold him, matched with others, as a mammoth to a
mouse,
And, though they often feel obliged his lapses to deplore,
His “cerebral significance” increasingly adore.
In parts I find him excellent, just like the curate's egg,
But not when he is pulling the confiding public's leg;
Besides, the height of genius I never could explain
As “an infinite capacity for giving others pain.”
No, give to me my ENGELBERT, my gentle HUMPERDINCK,
Whose cerebral development is void of any kink;
Who represents in music, in the most enchanting light,
That good old German quality, to wit, Gemiithlichkeit.
I love his gift of melody, now homely in its vein,
Now rising, as beſts his theme, to the celestial plane;
I love the rich orchestral tide that carries you along;
I love the cunning counterpoint that underlies the song.
Though scientific pedagogues that golden realm have banned,
Till, bald- and grey and middle-aged, we watch with child-
like glee
The very games we learned long since at our dead mother's
knee.
Our hearts are moved when in the wood the children lose
their way, - -
And strange uncanny echoes mock their innocent dismay,
And when, clasped in each other's arms, they cast them
down to sleep,
We know that real angels come and night-long vigil keep.
We thrill with apprehension of the risks that loom ahead
When they cross the magic threshold of the House of
Gingerbread; .. -
And O ! with what contentment we at last behold them pitch
Head-foremost in her furnace-fire the broomstick-riding
witch | - -
There's not a bar of Hänsel's part that's not exactly right;
There's not a note for Gretel that's not a pure delight;
And having heard it lately for (I think) the fifteenth time
I know I'm talking reason, though it happens to be rhyme.
Then let us thank our lucky stars that in a squalid age
When horror, blood and ugliness so many pens engage,
One of our master-minstrels, by fashion unbeguiled,

He leads us back by pleasant paths to childhood's fairyland,
Keeps the unclouded vision of a tender-hearted child.

THE SILHOUETTE.
WE were having tea.
“No sugar,” I said.
“Milk?"
“What tea is it?” I asked. “Ceylon,
China, caravan 2"
“Ceylon, I believe,” she said. .
“Then a little milk,” I replied.
“But supposing it had been caravan?”
she hazarded.
I sighed.
“Next time,” she promised.
We talked about the usual things—
the beauty and wonder of CARPENTIER;
the gaiety of HAwTREY in Never Say
Die ; the charm of Quality Street;
Roxin Ey's Sleeping Baby at the Gros-
venor; ANATOLE FRANCE; the fall of
LARKIN.
Having completed this round, she
asked me if I would like to see her
silhouettes.
“Fearfully,” I said.
She placed a little portfolio before me.
I turned over the black profiles.
“That's Jack,” I said.
“Yes.” . -
“That's his wife Marjorie.”
“Yes.” - *
“How clever you are That's
what's his name who lives near you.”
“Yes.”
“This is wonderful.
this 2 ''
“Oh, that 's the wife of a man who
lives near Jack.”
“I don't know her ?”
“ No.” - - - - -
“That accounts for my not recognis-
ing her,” I said. “But it looks horribly
lifelike. Won't you,” I said, after a
judicious pause,_" won't you do me?”
(I am rather set on my profile. I have
been told it is good.) - -
“I'd love to,” she said tactfully.
| “Right,” I said. “How shall I sit
for it 2 '' -
“Just like that,” she said, getting
her sketch block and sitting beside me.
“Look straight ahead.”
“I can't look straight ahead without
something to smoke,” I said.
She brought me a cigarette.
“Now,” she said.
“Then you draw it?" I remarked.
“I thought you cut it out with scissors.”
“Oh, no. I draw it and then ink it
But who 's
lin.
“Right,” I said.
She worked diligently while I smoked.
“Do you want me to be realistic 2"
she asked.
“Of course,” I said, fearing nothing.
“You won't mind?” she replied.
(What an odd remark )
“Why should I?” I asked, still in
a fool's paradise. -
I felt I would give a thousand pounds
to face her, but I didn't dare. This was
a profile. My nose, I knew, was good.
I had seen it at the hatter's in one of
those triple mirrors—clean cut, Roman,
efficient. Then my blood ran cold : I
suddenly remembered my chin. My
chin, I say; I mean my chins.
“Why did you ask that about being
realistic?" I said in agony.
“Nothing,” she said.
I took another cigarette.
“There,” she said, “that 's done.”
She showed it me.
“Is that me?” I asked.
“Yes. Who did you think I was
drawing: LLOYD GEORGE 2 " (That's
the worst of letting girls go to music-
halls, they pick up cheap sarcastic
ways.)
I studied it. It did not look like me
as I remembered myself from the last
visit to the hatter's, and yet she had
seemed to be clever.
“What's this?" I asked, pointing to
a lump. -
“That? That's your second chin.”
“And this 2 " . . . .
“That's your third chin.”
(Heavens ! how rich I am ()
“But surely,” I said, “the nose isn't
right? And you've made the lip much
too long.”
“I don't think so,” she replied coldly.
“How do you know?”
“I don't know,” I admitted. “I have
a kind of instinct.”
She forced me back into my position,
something between the dentist and the
photographer, and scrutinised me care-
fully.
“Perhaps it is a shade too long,”
she said, and shortened it. You can
make all the alterations you like before
the ink is applied.
“Now 2 ” she said.
I looked again. “That's better,” I
replied.
“But how do you know?" she
asked. “You must be very vain.”
“I was,” I said. “But never again.
Look at that array of chins.”
“I’ll ink it in after you've gone,”
she said. “Then I'll send it to you.”
The silhouette came home two days
later.
I tried it all over the room—on the
mantelpiece, on the tables, in picture
frames. Then my landlady came in.
“Who do you think that's meant
for 2 " I asked her.
She subjected it to minute study.
“It's either NAPOLEoN,” she said at
last (my heart gave a joyful bound),
“ or DANNY MAHER.”
“But neither of them had three
chins,” I said.
“All real gentlemen have three chins,”
DRAMATIC EXCLUSIVENESS.
WHAT with a Woman's Theatre
established at one playhouse and a
Children's Theatre at another, each
with its appropriate dramatic fare, we
are evidently on the way to a state of
things in which every separate class of
audience will have its suitable drama
served up in a special building. We
may then look for the following
announcements:–
A fine performance of The Taming of
the Shrew was given last night at the
Misogynists' Theatre in Adam Street.
This cosy little house, with its smoking
and billiard rooms, was packed to the
doors by an audience that applauded
every point in the comedy with rapture.
The grand Christmas pantomime, Blue
Beard, is advertised for Boxing Day.
The latest addition to London's play-
houses is the newly-built Socialists'
Theatre, which will start its activities
on Monday next with the production
of An Enemy of the People. The build-
ing is constructed throughout of steel
and asbestos, so as to render it suitable
as a meeting place for conferences, etc.
All the seats are equal in price, with
the exception of the first tier boxes,
which have been equipped with bomb-
proof safety curtains capable of being
lowered at will by the occupants, thus
providing absolute security for Labour
leaders visiting the entertainment.
The Theatre of the Advanced Symbo-
lists, opened last evening, is said to be
the first of its kind in Europe, and
embodies all the latest views of its
special patrons. Suggestion rather
than physical comfort has been the chief
result aimed at, the seats, designed on
the cubist system, being so arranged
that an interrupted view of the stage
is permitted from all. The initial pro-
gramme consisted of the first perform-
ance of the new Symbolist drama
entitled What 3 and gave the highest
leasure to a distinguished audience.
§. and complete darkness prevailed
both in the auditorium and on the stage.
It was unfortunate that, owing to the
careless duplication of the title on the
bills, the masterpiece should have been
advertised as What, What I thus creat-
ing a misapprehension as to its char-
acter, which explained the arrival of
several parties really bound for the
Postprandial Theatre next door, and
a regrettable display of feeling when
their mistake became clear to them.
This apart, however, the evening was a
deserved success.
Notices of the performances of Money
at the new Financiers' Theatre in
Copthall Avenue, and The Odonto Girl'
before the Society of Incorporated

countrymen towards the game in these
days. I call it a game, but in reality
it is more than that. Nor is it merely
to be compared with a trade or pro-
fession, for in the heart of the true
golfer it arouses a purer and more
exalted enthusiasm. Clearly, it stands
in a category by itself.
Now this apathy, this lack of in-
terest, must be apparent to all. Take
for example the space allotted by the
Press to an event of such historic and
national importance as a British or
American Open Championship. Do
we not find it passed over in as few
columns as might suffice for the
trifling matter of a pronouncement by
a leading member of the Government?
Instead of enjoying an exhaustivo de-
tailed description and criticism of every
stroke played by every competitor, we
have to be content with a brief résumé
incorporating the more sensational in-
cidents. But this is not my sole com-
plaint. Golfing news from day to day
is disgracefully microscopic. We find
even prominent newspapers publishing
only one descriptive or didactic article
per week on the various aspects and
difficulties of the game, instead of what
is clearly demanded—a regular daily
article. When, therefore, I see the
Press paying so scant a regard to golf,
I am not surprised at the indifference
of the public.
They do not take the game seriously.
It occupies a second, third, or even
lower place in the order of their pur-
suits. They expend upon it a few
meagre hours of leisure; they will
frivol away half a day, sometimes even
a whole day, at the office; linger over
their luncheon; loiter at the club. And
this is not all. Spendthrifts of their
time, they are niggards with their
money. I have heard of one golfer,
indeed, who unblushingly declared that
he spent only £200 a year upon the
game. Few, perhaps, can emulate my
friend A., who has cheerfully sacrificed
fortune, worldly ambition, and the joys
and comforts of family life to the
ardour of his master-passion.
I desire to appeal to all exponents of
this great art to correct their deplorable
habits of levity and slothfulness; to
wean themselves from the luxury of
business and other distractions; to
realise the pressing necessity for self-
sacrifice. They should also conquer

AT THE PLAY.
“THE NIGHT HAwk.”
I HAVE never quite understood why
it should be more difficult to rise from
bed at one hour than another, if you
have had your full allowance of sleep.
Yet this appears to be a law of depraved
human nature, and against it the Hon.
James Daubenay had fought in vain.
In the end he had given up the struggle
to rise before luncheon, and only got
up in time for dinner, going straight
from his bath into his evening clothes.
This habit of turning night into day
is one that moralists have ever de-
plored. Yet I have known editors of
great daily journals who have followed
it without visible loss of moral fibre;
and the night-porter of my flat, if his
inward graces are at all commensurate
with his manly exterior, is a spiritual
stalwart. But what is permissible and
even admirable in the slave of duty
may, in the case of a lover of pleasure,
be matter for the gravest reprobation.
If virtue is its own reward, vice, I
hope, is equally its own punishment.
Not that there was anything traceably
vicious in the character of Daubenay;
but we were allowed to conjecture un-
utterable things from the character of
his associates of the Night Hawk Club.
Of the actual habits of this nocturnal
bird of prey from which the club drew
its symbolic name I know absolutely
nothing; but a less seductive crew than
the vulgarian females who used to
sweep into Daubenay's flat by night on
a whirlwind of noisy banality, I can-
not easily imagine. Certainly the
authors of the play have done their
public no moral damage by making vice
too picturesque.
Into the midst of this stupid orgy
there entered one night a young girl
from the country, a veritable dream of
stage innocence. From that moment,
even to the end of the play, our gifts
of credulity were taxed almost beyond
endurance. We were invited to believe
that this prim little thing had come up
to town for the day; had lost her rustic
escort in a Trafalgar Square crowd;
had then gone to look up her divorced
mother at her old address (for, though
they were on terms of secret inter-
course, this unnatural parent had not
confided to her daughter her change of
residence); and was now anxious to ||
consult the present occupant of the flat
as to the next thing to be done. Moved
to respectful sympathy, Daubenay,
instead of putting her into the last
train for home, insists on conducting
her there in his motor. Safely arrived,
he is captured by the girl's infuriated
father—a man with an iron heart
suspicion. It was now that our simple
faith underwent its worst strain. or
the stern father compelled Daubenay,
under threat of the stick for himself
and banishment for the girl, to remain
indefinitely on the premises, earning
his feed by the sweat of his brow. To
have seen this scion of the aristocracy
employed in the menial labour of
polishing harness in his evening clothes,
with a little casual accommodation from
the local wardrobe, would have melted
the heart of a LLoyd GEORGE. w
*After this it was relatively easy to
believe that the hero would be tracked
by his Society friends to the scene of his
alleged “rest cure" and be whisked off
in their car; that the innocent girl,
exiled by her Spartan sire, would
appear again at Daubenay's flat in the
middle of an orgy identical with that
of the first Act, but this time herself
in the gay attire of a Night Hawk, so
as to compete on level terms with
the other ladies of the club; and so
would win his honourable love by
those charms which innocence in the
garb of vice always exerts upon the
jaded senses of the roué of the footlights.
It will be guessed that it needed
some pretty good acting to carry off a
plot like that. Mr. KENNETH Douglas,
on whose almost unaided shoulders fell
the task, came very near to achieving
it. He was practically never off the
stage, and played with an extraordinary
fluency and that natural humour of
which he is so accomplished a master.
Whether as a night-bird with no
particular taste for the game, or as a
man of ease compelled to undergo the
grossest manual labour, and, subduing
his Olympian habit, like Apollo in the
demesne of Admetus,
6magav rpáne{av aivéoral, 6eds nep ºv,
or as a Londoner suffering the horrors
of the countryside with its deadly noises
of awakening nature, he was always
quietly equal to the occasion. Miss
JANE CoopBR's pleasant angularity,
proper to the part of rural innocence,
made an agreeable contrast to Mr.
KENNETH Dougi,As's mature facility
of style. Mr. Fisher White, as the
farmer-tyrant, demonstrated with the
most unflinching resolution how the
strongest religious convictions may be
compatible with a total disregard for
human charity. -
I shall excuse myself from particular
reference to the remainder of the cast,
except to say that Mr. STAFFord
HILLIARD, as Daubenay's man, whose
personal health and private convenience
suffered badly from the irregularity of
his master's mode of life, bore it all
with a most touching stoicism.
The humour of the play lies more in
pleasant vein of fun runs through the
talk, in which I gratefully acknowledge
the absence of imported epigrams. My
programme, which is very specific about
the origin of the furniture, the motor-
hats, the plate, and the gramophone,
omits to give a definition of the genus
of Messrs. WoRRALL and MERIvaLE's
º so you may define it as you
will. It is a blend of comedy and farce,
too incredible to be purely the one and
not boisterous enough to be purely the
other. But the mixture will serve, if
you are not too exigent." ~ O. S.

THE MAN BEHIND THE FACE.
My old acquaintance, William Jones,
Is not a handsome man,
The physiognomy he owns
Is wandering in its plan;
Some careless person must have let
His features run ere they had set.
It would be difficult to lay
One's finger, I suppose, .
On any special spot and say,
“I look, that is William's nose; "
One could but state, “'Tis somewhere
here : : *** * ,
The nasal organ should appear.”
His general expression, too,
Betrays a vagueness such
As very seldom meets the vicw
Outside a rabbit hutch ;
At times he almost has the air
Of one who is not wholly there.
Not once, nor twice, but oft have I
Heard strangers in the street,
When William Jones was passing by,
I.xclaim with sudden heat: .
“That man at large should never roam,
His proper place is in a home.”
Alas! the superficial gaze,
How powerless it seems
To thread the soul's interior maze,
Where genius broods and dreams!
They err who think that Jones is what
The world calls barmy; he is not.
Forbear to scoff, look not askance
On William, for behind
That unimpressive countenance
Lurks a colossal mind;
In fact, fame whispers it was he

ALI, the time I was reading Mr. FRANK HARRIs's Great
Days (THE BoDLEY HEAD) I was wondering where I had
come across an earlier story written in the same style.
Then I realised. Great Days is just like the fairy stories
of my childhood, where the King's youngest son goes out to
seek his fortune. Like the writers of the fairy stories, Mr.
HARRIs takes it for granted that we shall be interested in
the smallest details of his hero's career, however little they
may have to do with the main theme or the development of
his character; and, for myself, I must admit that he is not
mistaken. I became so interested in Jack Morgan that
I welcomed the information that he drank hot water at
night after an evening at the inn, so as to avoid a headache
next morning, and that he gave a little dinner to two friends,
beginning with oysters and Sauterne, and was amused to
find that one of his guests thought the white wine too thin.
But Jack's career was not confined to these trivialities.
Belonging to the great days that followed the French Revo-
lution, and being by profession a smuggler and privateers-
man, he lived a very vivid life on both sides of the Channel.
Mr. HARRIs has the admirable virtue of not being afraid to
1nake his hero a real hero. When Jack is not running
cargoes of old brandy, he is passing through passionate love
adventures, thrashing bullies or capturing frigates. The
culminating point of his exciting life is where the great
BUoNAPARTE himself offers him supreme command of the
French Navy if he will sweep the English off the seas, as
he has expressed himself able to do.
Fortunately, Jack's
in a fairly satisfactory position as regards naval supremacy.
But it was touch and go. We could manage France all
right, but France and Jack—it does not bear thinking of.
To sum up, a good, bustling yarn which kept me enter-
tained from start to finish, and will have, I guarantee, a
similar effect on others who believe in fairies. - t
Mrs. WHARtoN's new satire, The Custom of the Country
(MACMILLAN), suffers, I think, from the bitterness of her
indignation. In an earlier novel, The House of Mirth, she
showed her fierce intolerance of the restless, grasping spirit
|. some part of the New York world, but with that fierce-
ness there were mingled pity and even tenderness. I find no
pity or tenderness in her new chronicle. There is in the
quality of her work the hard, shining, metallic glitter of
an American railway-line. Undine, the heroine, passing
from stage to stage, from husband to husband, trampling
remorselessly as she goes upon all those who have helped
her, is, at the last, inhuman in her lack of contrast. Mrs.
WHARTON hates her so deeply that she will allow her no
suspicion of human feeling or human softness. I failed,
therefore, to realise that the gentle first husband and the
courteous second one would have fallen at her feet. Some-
thing more of her than physical beauty those men would
have demanded, and something more, perhaps, she had; but
Mrs. WHARTON will not reveal it to us. So with it all.
| The miserable side of human nature, the degraded, selfish
instincts of society—these are emphasised. The book, with
all its cleverness, lacks justice, and therefore truth. Here the
artist, driven forward by her contemptuous disgust, paints
her picture in dark, sombre colours, and has too readily

patriotism is greater than his ambition, and England is still
| allowed personal prejudice to "darken her vision. Once

a lady called Becky Sharp dazzled, hoodwinked, tricked the
London, world. She was, I dare say, a wickeder woman
than Mrs. WHART.on's Undine, but her historian was, in
spite of himself, fair to her. Mrs. WHARTON is never fair
to her victim. The brilliance of the book remains; whether
it be finance, social contrasts, the Old World or the New,
French châteaua or American hotels, Mrs. WHARTON's
talent can most ably reveal them for us; but it is a hard
and a cruel revelation.
I did not see The Witness for the Defence (HopDER AND
StoughTon) in its previous incarnation as a play at the
St. James's Theatre. Hitherto I have always regretted
this, but I hope Mr. A. E. W. MASON will not misunder-
stand me when I say that my regret is now banished. The
reason is that I have been able to approach the book with
an appreciation unhampered by those worrying memories
of the theatre about which I have spoken before in similar
cases. As a result I have enjoyed it greatly. The rule is
that good plays do not make good novels, though authors
has a thoroughly sound idea that the kind of fact that it
is not important to know about London is that on a very
clear day one may have a view of the Crystal Palace if one
looks straight down Bouverie Street. The Sage who lives
in this sacred congested thoroughfare has never noticed it,
and, like Mr. ADcoCK, doesn't want to. An index makes
this little volume a lazily convenient occasion of happy
reminiscence.
What a passion for untempered veracity seems to have
taken hold of our novelists | The latest professor of the
system of withholding nothing is Mr. WILLIAM HEwlFTT,
whose new novel, Telling the Truth (SECKER), sufficiently
explains its character by its title. In his introductory pages
Mr. HEwlFTT almost vehemently protests that no considera-
tion shall prevent him from giving us the facts, even if, like
GALILEO, he shall “suffer the penalty of public condemna-
tion.” Really I don't think he need have worried. These
devoted truth-tellers always a little remind me of the hero
of Dickess's Holiday Romances, who fought his desperate

Anyhow, I am glad to find
The Witness for the Defence
a triumphant exception. It
makes quite a good novel,
picturesque, alive and con-
vincing. In one way the
story has gained much by
its liberation from dramatic

to see something more of

little more intimately about the characters, and “their whys

have not met them before, I would say, Do it Now.
In The Booklover's London (METHUEN) Mr. A. St. John
Adcock sets out on a pleasant gossipy round of the town
in the track of characters out of his favourite imaginative
literature, from BEN Jonson to GEORGE GissiNg. I am
afraid I suspect him of a little self-deception when he pro-
tests that in this or that place the imaginary folk throng
about him and are more real than the whistling errand-
boys and pompous, rotund merchants who are there in
actual prosaic fact. It may, of course, be even so. . More
likely 'tis a harmless device to put his spirits in key for his
enterprise and is justified by its entirely amiable results.
One of these is to send you from the quotations with which
the book is freely embellished back to the originals to renew
their acquaintance. And that, no doubt, is one of the
author's benevolent purposes. The chief of them, I guess,
was to please himself by indulging a hobby—which is no
contact with his soul-mate,
who is, as you might expect, already the wife of another.
Honestly, what I think must have been the matter with
Hugh Middlecomb was a too-fervent admiration for the
heroes of Messrs. H. G. WELLs and CoMPTON MACKENziE.
This may explain his taking his bruised spirit to Cornwall
in the final book, and thus giving his own author the oppor-
tunity for some pleasant descriptive writing. To be fair, the
story has also some good passages of stage and journalistic
life; but, on the whole, I hardly found myself in agreement
with Mr. HEwlFTT about its importance.
From an account of an R.S.P.C.A
Liverpool Evening Earpress:– -
“Mr. J. B. Marston, of Mold, defended, and stated that the mare
along with others was travelling to Chester, when a motor passed
and scared all the horses, which jumped about, and the mare in
question got knocked down and thus received the injury.
A large body of evidence was called for the defence.”
This would no doubt be the body of the mare, the animal
having been destroyed previous to the police court proceed-
ings. (Our contemporary's actual words are “the Mayor

CHRISTMAS SUPERSTITIONS.
(With apologies to our contemporaries.)
Not HING is more interesting or (to the journalist hack)
more profitable than a comparative study of the many
quaint and old-world beliefs concerning the present festive
season that still linger in various places. -
Thus in certain districts of Northumberland it is con-
sidered very unlucky to eat crab on Christmas Eve that has
been boiled more than three weeks. If mince-pies be taken
at the same meal the danger is supposed to be increased.
There are many legends of persons who disregarded this
tradition and perished miserably.
In some villages of the Lower Danube the peasants say
that, if a householder takes a large pail of dirty water to his
bedroom and leaves it all night upon the window-sill, it
discourages the Herald Angels from singing outside his
house on Christmas Eve.
“The mouth that is opened too wide at Christmas stays
open for long,” runs a Turkish proverb, based upon the story
of the Sultan who broke five front teeth on his plum-pudding,
and had to spend the next fortnight with his dentist.
Among the natives of the Gold Coast there is a saying
that, if a dog howl all night on Christmas Eve, a stranger
will come in the morning. Curiously enough much the same
tradition is found in Acton and Ealing, with the difference
that there the stranger is the next-door neighbour.
One of the most extraordinary beliefs to be found any-
where at the present day is the conviction amongst the
inhabitants of Fleet Street that Christmas really comes at
the beginning of November. The quaint ceremonial,
observed about this date, of “Bringing out the Christmas
Number,” is evidence of this superstition, the origin of which
is lost in the mists of obscurity.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
“MONNA LISA” AND THE
MAN WHO KNEW.
IT is not often that anything happens
in Europe or America without Har-
berry getting to know the why and
how of it. The fall of a government,
the crumbling of a monarchy, may be
due to causes hidden from the common
eye, but not from Harberry's. The
most impregnable mysteries keep open
house to Harberry. Allow him time
and he will give you three explanations
of any one you name, each more im-
peccably authenticated than the last,
and all mutually exclusive.
Harberry was, I believe, the first
person in Europe—at all events the
first innocent person—to know exactly
what had become of the “Monna
Lisa” after her disappearance from the
Louvre. The thief, it appeared, was—
well, there was no need to name him—
but he was a very high official among
the Louvre hierarchy, and his wife's
extravagance in dress was a by-word
in three capitals. In the meantime
“it’” had been bought by an English
grocer.
It was next Spring that I met Har-
berry again. He was just back from
New York.
“Most extraordinary thing about
‘La Gioconda,” he observed in the
course of conversation.
“Oh 2 " I asked. “Anything new 2"
“Well,” he said, “I suppose you
know where it is 2 ”
“Not absolutely for certain,” I re-
plied, “but I understood from you—”
“Oh, that story last September 2
That was only a dealer's rumour. But
do you mean to say they haven't heard
the truth on this side of the Atlantic
yet?”
I intimated that Europe sat in dark-
ness.
“Why, it was stolen by a down-
town gang of New York cracksmen
for X.-he mentioned a world-famed
multi-millionaire—and now he's got
the thing framed up in a little private
gallery of his own, and spends hours a
day cooped up with it, simply gazing
at it. He has a whole staff of pri-
vate detectives to watch it; and he's
sent nearly half-a-million hush-money
to the Louvre people to keep them
quiescent.”
I bowed amazed credulity. The
crime of X. held the field until the
Summer of 1913.
Meeting Harberry casually, I gleaned
my usual harvest of first-hand inter-
national secrets.
“Anything new about “La Gio-
conda'?” I asked, when his confidences
drew to a close. “I suppose it's the
Mrs. Briggs. “So THERE's Not GoING TO BE A Post AL SPRIKE AFTER ALL, MIRs.
Johnson.”
Mrs. Johnson (remembering the Coal Strike). “WELL, You NEveR cAN TELL BUT what
IT MAY COME AT ANY MOMENT ; so I SHALL LAY IN A Good stock of STAMPs Now.”
“Theft?” thundered Harberry.
“There never was a theft. I tell you
every official in the Louvre wants
hanging. That picture never left the
galleries. They were trying on some
new way of cleaning which the Curator
thought he'd invented, and simply
rotted the surface off the thing. And
now the canvas is lying in the Depart-
mental offices—along with the missing
parts of the ‘Milo'; and there it'll
lie for evermore. It's nothing short of
an international scandal.”
It was a few days after the recovery
of the picture that I ran across Har-
berry once more.
He seemed a trifle more subdued
than usual, and, beyond the compara-
had been drugged, he had little to
communicate.
“What do you think about the
“Gioconda' now 2 " I was tempted to
ask.
He came nearer blushing than I had
thought possible to him.
“Think about it,” he said. “I think
it's a devilish clever business—copied
right down to the scratches. Dut if
France is satisfied I suppose the rest of
the world has no right to complain.”

ORGANISED HOSPITALITY. (General applause.)
IN view of the unqualified success of Sir E. RAY LANRESTER rose to know
the recent banquets to M. ANATOLE if Americans were to be included among
FRANCE and Dr. GEORGE BRANDEs, it
is proposed to form a permanent com-
mittee of what might be called Entre-
the guests.
The Chairman said that that question
raised a delicate point. There was one
preneurs of Culture, whose duty it shall writer who, if he were still an American,
be from time to time to select foreigners would naturally be the first to be asked;
of distinction worthy of being feasted but as no one quite knew whether he

fitting ceremonial, thus relieving Mr. request for information left the matter
EDMüND Gosse of more hard work than so much more vague than before—he
ought to fall on any one man, however referred to Mr. HENRY JAMEs (wild ex-
willing he may be.
A preliminary meeting to this end
was held last week at the Café Royal,
at which the chair was taken by Sir
SIDNEY LEE. After having outlined
the objects of the gathering, the Chair-
man added that it was held that in the
future every effort should be made to
citement)—it was thought that for the
present America had better be excluded.
Sir E. RAY LANKESTER said he
thought the decision was a pity as it
shut out Mr. SILAs K. HockING.
Sir WILLIAM RoPERTson NicoLL rose
to point out that Mr. HockING was an
Englishman.
Mr. John LANE said that he was
sorry that he had no guest to propose.
M. FRANCE was the only superlatively
great French author on his list.
Mr. DUCK worth stated that he could
offer no suggestion as he had ascer-
tained that Dostol Evsky was dead.
Mr. HEINEMANN said he did not see
why retrospective enthusiasm should
not be indulged. After all, one could
eat as good a dinner to a great man's
memory as in a great man's presence.
He thought that a Tolstoi or Tour-
GENIEFF dinner would be equally de-
lightful.
Sir THoMAs Lipton said that it was
a crying shame that so many of the
greatest authors were dead. He would
enormously have liked to meet GoFTHE:

that the purpose of the

form a permanent com-

It was felt that such a deplorable state
of things must never occur again. One
at a time must be the rule, and what-
ever arrangements were made as to
hospitality they must always be con-
ditioned by the programme of the
National Sporting Club. (Loud ap-
plause.)
Sir THOMAS BARCIAY said that a
leader in The Times had suggested that
a dinner was not the best form of
entertainment to which to invite these
honoured guests. Speaking from his
own not trifling experience as a host of
men of genius, he could say that it was.

Lieut.-Col. NEw NHAMI-DAvis rose to

any reciprocity in these matters. Were

Mr. CLEMENT Shorter (author of

European, to include the Scotch. If
so, he begged to propose the name of
Sir WILLIAM Rob ERTson NicoLI, as a
fitting guest for the society. It was
monstrous that so illustrious a man as
Sir WILLIAM had had to wait so long

Mr. H. G. SELFRIDGE said that he

DISAPPOINTMENT.
My young friend Bobby (now in the
early thirteens) has been making his
plans for the Christmas holidays. He
communicated them to me in a letter
from school:—
“I am going to write an opera in
the holidays with a boy called Short, a
very great and confident friend of mine
here. I am doing the words and Short
is doing the music. We have already
got the title; it is called ‘Disappoint-
ment.’”
Last week, on his return to town, he
came to see me at my club, and when
the waiter had brought in drinks, and
Bobby had refused a cigar, I lighted
up and prepared to talk shop. His
recent discovery that I write too leads
him to treat me with more respect than
formerly.
“Now then,” I said, “tell me about
How 's it going on 2 "
“Oo, I haven't done much yet,” said
Bobby. “But I've got the plot.”
“Let’s have it.”
Bobby unfolded it rapidly.
“Well, you see, there's a chap called
Tommy—he's the hero—and he's just
come back from Oxford, and he's
awfully good-looking and decent and
all that, and he's in love with Felicia,
you see, and there's another chap called
Reynolds, and, you see, Felicia's really
the same as Phyllis, who's going to
marry Samuel, and that's the dis-
appointment, because Tommy wants
to marry her, you see.” -
“I see. That ought to be all right.
You could almost get two operas out
| of that.”
“Oo, do you think so?”
“Well, it depends how much Rey-
molds comes in. You didn't tell me
what happened to him. Does he marry
anybody?”
“Oo, no. He comes in because
I want somebody to tell the audience
about Tommy when Tommy isn't
there.”
(How well Bobby has caught the
dramatic idea.)
“I see. He ought to be very useful.”
“You see, the first Act's in a very
grand restaurant, and Tommy comes
in to have dinner, and he explains to
Reynolds how he met Felicia on a
boat, and she'd lost her umbrella, and
he said, ‘Is this your umbrella?' and
it was, and they began to talk to each
other, and then he was in love with
her. And then he goes out, and then
Reynolds tells the audience what an
awfully decent chap Tommy is.”
“Why does he go out?”
“Well, you see, Reynolds couldn't
tell everybody what an awfully decent
it.
(You see how Bobby has mastered
the technique of the stage,)
“And where's Felicia all this time 2"
“Oo, she doesn't come on. She's
in the country with Samuel. You see,
the second Act is a grand country
wedding, and Samuel and Phyllis are
married, and Tommy is one of the
guests, and he's very unhappy, but he
tries not to show it, and he shoots
himself.”
“Reynolds is there too, I suppose?”
“Oo, I don't know yet.”
(He'll have to be, of course. He'll
be wanted to tell the audience how
unhappy Tommy is.)
“And how does it chd 2 ” I asked.
“Well, you see, when the wedding's
over, Tommy sings a song about Felicia,
and it ends up “Felicia, Felicia, Felicia,”
getting higher each time—Short has to
do that part, of course, but I've told
him about it—and then the curtain
comes down.” -
“I see. And has Short written any
of the music yet?”
“He’s got some of the notes. You
see, I've only just got the plot, and
I've written about two pages. I'm
writing it in an exercise-book.”
A shadow passed suddenly across the
author's brow. -
“And the sickening thing,” he said,
as he leant back in his chair and
sipped his ginger-beer, “is that on the
cover of it I've spelt Disappointment
with two ‘s’s.’”
(The troubles of this literary life!)
“Sickening,” I agreed.
. If there is one form of theft utterly
unforgivable it is the theft by a writer
of another writer's undeveloped ideas.
Borrow the plot of Sir J. M. BARRIE’s
last play, and you do him no harm; you
only write yourself down as a plagiarist.
But listen to the scenario of his next
play (if he is kind enough to read it to
.." and write it up before he has time
to develop it himself, and you do him
a grievous wrong; for you fix the
charge of plagiarism on him. Surely,
you say, no author could sink so low
as this.
And yet, when I got home, the plot
of “Disappointment" (with one “s”)
so took hold of me that I did the unfor-
givable thing; I went to my desk and
wrote the opera. I make no excuses
for myself. I only point out that
Bobby's opera, as performed at Covent
Garden in Italian, with Short's music
conducted by Richter, is not likely to
be belittled by anything that I may
write here. I have only written in
order that I may get the scenario—
which had begun to haunt me—off my
chest. Bobby, I know, will understand

ONCE UPON A TIME.
BREATHING SPACE.
ONCE upon a time there was an old
pheasant—a real veteran who had come
victorious out of many battues. Not
perhaps wholly unscathed, for his tail
was no longer the streaming meteoric
plume that it once had been, but sound
in wind and limb.
No one knew his lordship's guests
so well as he, so often had he seen
them in the coverts: old Sir Mark, who
had an arm-chair at the angle of the
two best drives; Sir Humphry, with
his eternal cigarette in the long gold
tube; the red-faced Colonel, who
always shot too late; the purple-faced
Major, who always shot too soon; the
smiling agent, who would so tactfully
disown a bird whenever it seemed
politic; and all the rest of them.
How the veteran rocketer had escaped
he could not say, but shoot after shoot
found him still robust and elusive,
while his relations were falling all
around, some, to their dying satisfac-
tion, thudding into the features of their
assassins.
One morning three young pheasants
came flying up to their Nestor in a state
of nervous excitement.
“Quick! quick!” they said, “the
gentlemen are leaving the Hall. Tell
us where to go to be safe.”
“Go ?” said the old bird. “Don’t
go anywhere. Stay where you are.”
“But they're coming this way,”
said the young pheasants. “They've
got the same clothes on.”
“Let them come,” said the old bird.
“There's no danger. Why don't you
use your ears?”
“What do you mean?” they asked.
“Listen,” said the old bird. “What
is that sound 2’’
“It's too gentle for guns,
young pheasants meditatively.
“Yes,” said the old bird. “That's
church bells. It means they're going
to play golf.”

NATURE STUDIES.
THE AMATEUR Actor.
This common but entertaining little
creature will well repay observation.
The present is one of the best periods
of the year for such a purpose, as it
has been proved that the two seasons
when it flourishes and propagates most
abundantly are the weeks about Christ-
mas and those immediately preceding
Lent. With the approach of warm
evenings it usually retires into com-
parative obscurity.
In its habits this biped presents
several strongly marked characteristics.
Its chief distinction is the employment
of what is known to naturalists as Pro-
tective mimicry. Thus the same speci-
men may frequently be found to simu-
late at one time Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER,
and at another Mr. EDMUND PAYNE,
according to circumstances. This habit
is not only employed for protection,
but may very often be used for purposes
of offence. We have seen an amateur
imitation of Sir HERBERT TREE that
hand, the amateur, especially the female
variety, is often both docile and en-
gaging in manner, and may form a
perfect pet for the household. It eats
little, but usually drinks a lot. “Scratch
meals” and champagne are its chief
articles of nutriment.
Should any reader be contemplating
amateur - keeping, the rules to be
observed are very simple. A large
empty room, in which they can play
about undisturbed, is the chief requisite.
At their period of full activity they
take very little sleep, and that mostly
in the early morning. They are per-
fectly safe, except that anything like
unfavourable criticism irritates them
to frenzy, and should on no account
be permitted. With this precaution a
few of these bright little creatures will
more than compensate for the expense of
upkeep, and provide a constant source
of entertainment for a Christmas party.

A VILLAGE POET.
His was the red-roofed corner shop
(They pulled it down to build the
station)
Into whose dimness one might drop
For bird's-eye or for conversation,
And meet what most of us have missed
A Poet-and-Tobacconist.
Delightful trades, of Heaven blent—
The homely, useful, aromatic,
With the divine, Olympian-lent,
The serviceable with the Attic ;
'Twas good to meet a man whose views
Combined Tobacco and the Muse.
I do not mean to say you'd call
My friend a SHAKSPEARE or a MILTON:
He liked to write, and, after all,
That's what the Iliad was built on.
If HoMER's job had been no joy
To HoMER, who'd have heard of Troy 2
The merchant first (although he found
His chief delight the reed of Thyrsis),
His navy-cut continued sound,
In fact much sounder than his verses,
Although The Wealdsman now and then
Would print a sample from his pen.
Of local happenings he would sing,
Of maidens too and how to love them;
He still had heart to hail the Spring
Though he had seen some fifty of
them ;
A jolly fellow, hale and stout,
Who knew of dressing flies and trout.
A desultory Unionist,
On GLADston E he could “speak
satiric,”
And stop to serve an ounce of twist
Or read aloud his latest lyric;
Or, if that week there wasn't onc,
To talk of ALFRED TENNYsoN.
I recollect how he'd applaud
(His mind mayhap on some lost
Mabel)
The genius that created “Maud "
And sang the loves of ARTHUR's
Table;
Unwedded he-and quite content—
But very fond of sentiment.
Ah well, 'tis now this many a day
(How swiftly do the seasons pass us)
He's doffed, as he'd have said, the clay
And gone to find his loved Par-
naSSuS :
The gods of all the mysteries
Be good to him where'er he is.
His memory's green, his face stands

Amid a score of friendly faces,
Cheery as then, nor do I doubt

THE BARBER'S CHRISTMAS EVE.
The Headless Knight of the Clanking Chain. “HAIR cut, PLEASE.”
TO A CENTENARIAN COCKATOO.
CREATURE of mystery, above whose head
More than a hundred years, I'm told, have sped,
Strange Bird, who should by every right be dead,
Yet seem to all appearance just as well
As when your dam, with forest-splitting yell,
Proclaimed you issuing from your native shell,
I wonder, when you muse upon the lot
That's brought you to this age of heav'n knows what,
If you congratulate yourself, or not.
Great are your blessings. You can still digest
Trifles like nuts and matches with the best;
You still retain a lively interest
In the vain plumage you so much approve;
And—inwardly—l grieve to say, you move
Still in the same unalterable groove.
Your gift of specch does not advance with age;
It is not guarded, apposite or sage;
You have one joke, to lure within your cage
Some kindly finger, and, with sudden beak,
Transfix that member till its owner squeak;
As manners, this is poor; as humour, weak.
Far from that alien country in whose trees
Your wilding brothers had their little sprees,
Here you have sojourned in superior ease.
You did not share with them the daily risk,
That keeps the faculties agog and brisk,
And oſt, no doubt, in this your easy state
You chuckle at the grim and tragic fate
That must have caught those others, soon or late.
Yet these your kin, however rough their lives,
Had active times and multitudinous wives;
While you, the sole relation that survives—
It never has been yours in Spring to screech
A mad love-music, not in human speech,
But in the language love alone can teach.
The flamelike crest that you so proudly raise,
Though you have ſlaunted it these myriad days,
Has ne'er been lifted for a female's praise.
The plumes that you have preened and kept so neat
You have but tended for your own conceit,
Not for the winning of some dearer sweet.
Musings like these may possibly have stirred
Your inmost soul—although it seems absurd,
They being suited to a younger bird.
Still, even with the old are moments when
Such feelings touch them—lightly—now and then ;
Though you, for all I know, may be a hen.
DUM-DUM.
Official Candour.
From a G.P.O. letter to a correspondent who had com-
plained of his (you'll never guess what)—yes, his tele-
phone:–
“While every reasonable endeavour is made to reduce the incon-
venience occasioned by faults to a minimum, unbroken interruption
cannot be guaranteed.”

Of passing to oblivion in a whisk;
Meanwhile they go on trying for it.

“Robin A IN SEARCH of A HUSBAND.”
MR. J.E.RoME K. J.EROME has called
his production at the Vaudeville “an
Absurd Play.” I have had no previous
quarrel with Mr. JEROME, but I am sure
we should differ bitterly over the right
application of this epithet. He probably
used it in a modest, deprecatory way,
to imply that his creation was just
quaint nonsense. But I should want
it to mean that the play was curiously
bad. Now a bad serious play I can
bear with some show of fortitude, but
a bad funny play reduces me to a state
of sombre despair.
Mr. JEROME's old mechanical device
of an exchange of dresses and identities
leads in the end to almost as much
bewilderment for the audience as for
the actors affected. Myself, I should
, have preferred a frank buffoonery to
this mental knockabout business. It

The situations offered
is true that a comic policeman was
no matter for mirth; up to half-time the
dialogue seldom lapsed from banality;
and the whole play contained only
one realisable character—that of an
American, played naturally by Mr.
BREoN.
Miss Rowl:NA JEROME, for whose
talents, I must assume, her father de-
signed this unhappy opportunity, went
bravely through the part of a minx
under the apparent impression that it
was humorous, but failed to convey her
own convictions across the footlights.
When I have added that Mr. RICHARD
EvaNs was pleasantly pedestrian in his
delivery of poetic sentiments, I have
said all that needs saying about the
cast.
There are mysteries, insoluble to the
outsider, about the production of certain
plays, and it is not for me to conjecture
whether Messrs. NorMAN M'KINNEL and
FREDERICK WHELEN made a contract
with Mr. JEROME on the strength of
that they were to “present.” But I
prefer to hazard this guess, because
the alternative explanation would be
less flattering to their intelligence and
experience. -
As for Mr. JERoME, who has here
done such poor justice to his undoubted
gifts, I don't grudge him the right to
any personal amusement he may have
got out of this composition, but I do
grudge him the privilege of wasting
one of my evenings; and unless my
temper shows a marked improvement
it will be a long time before I take
the risk of assisting, on a first night,
at another Absurd Play from his pen.

OUR DAILY POLITICAL FARE.
(Being an imitation of the London
Letter of every provincial newspaper
every day.)
[NotE.-The alternatives in brackets may
be regarded as purely optional, to be retained
or omitted according to the political opinions
of the reader. They are not of any importance
any way.] -
MR. Asquith's speech on Friday
night is the sole subject of discussion
in political circles here. Its importance
can hardly be overrated. There is,
however, much diversity of opinion.
Some see in it the clearest possible
hint of approaching conciliation, while
others find themselves baffled by its
manifest ambiguity. , Still it cannot
fail, following as it does upon the epoch-
making pronouncements of the leaders
of both parties at Ladybank, Leeds,
Oldham, Newcastle, Widnes, Paisley,
Carnarvon, Ballycoran, Chowbent and
elsewhere, to have a profound effect on
the situation. -
Had it been made immediately after
Mr. CHURCHILL's reply at Portobello
to Mr. Box AR LAw's retort at New-
castle to Mr. Asquith's statement at
Ladybank it would have been accepted
by the Opposition leaders without hesi-
tation as approaching more closely to
the Aberdeen position, which, owing to
the less conciliatory attitude taken up
at Southampton, appeared to have been
finally abandoned. 13ut, coming as it
does on the eve of the demonstrations
at Baslow, Birmingham, and Beat-
tock, its special significance cannot be
ignored. -- . . . .
It may be said with confidence that
there is no new element whatever in
the situation. As I pointed out yester-
day—and the day before, and the day
before that, and any time in the last six
weeks—the attitude of the leaders on
both sides is perfectly clear. Unionists
demand a General Election. That is
º a possible solution of the impasse.
Radicals hotly maintain that the present
Bill holds the field. Clearly it doesſnot]
hold the field. If any conference is to
take place it is indubitably [not] up to
the Government to make the first move.

The development of the

It must be borne in mind that, faced
with the actual danger of a rising in the

But all this is merely to repeat what I
have been saying daily in almost the
same words during the last two months.
The vital point is that the time is short,
the sands are running out. A terrible
responsibility will be incurred if the

The Times by the way, commenting
on last night's speech, sees in it a frank
return to the position adopted at Leam-
ington. The Morning 1'ost draws a
striking parallel between it and the
Kinloch-Rannoch pronouncement. The
Daily Neu's is confident that in some
points it directly controverts the Liver-
pool utterance, but it must be remem-
bered that that was afterwards qualified
by the St. Andrews deliverance. But
this is surely to leave out of account the
Prestatyn assertion, the Golders Green
declaration and the Inverness pro-
nunciamiento. -
To sum up: both sides are still
feeling their way and there is no
change whatever in the situation. To-
morrow I hope to discuss the position
in precisely the same terms.
MUSICAL NOTES.
PROFEssor DE BANVILLE's NEw
SYMPHONY.
GREAT enthusiasm prevails in Bootle
in consequence of the announcement
that Professor Quantock de Banville's
new Choral Supersymphony will be
heard there in the course of the next
year. This great work, the words for
which have been selected by the com-
poser from the works of CoNFUcIUs,
Mr. W. B. YEATs and RABIND RANATH
TAGoRE, is written in forty real parts,
each of the four ordinary divisions of
the chorus —soprano, contralto, tenor
and bass—being divided into ten. .
With the view of obtaining the due
variety of timbre and colour desirable in
an orchestra, Professor de Banville has
provided the most elaborate instructions
for the singers. For instance, some of
the tenors are enjoined to sing always
through their noses; in one passage
the soprani are adjured to “emulate
the tones of a terrified peacock; ”
in another the basses are bidden “to
imitate the booming of the chimera in
the void ; ” while in a third the
contralti are enjoined always to keep a
Carlsbad plum in their mouths to
ensure a “rich fruity tone.”
Again, though no instruments are
employed, the Professor indicates
means by which novel effects may be
produced, as, for example, by clicking
the tongue, or striking the jaw with
the clenched fist, or again, as he
graphically puts it, “bubbling with the
lips.” The libretto is partly in Eng-
lish, partly in Chinese, but in one strik-
and birds, including hyaenas, gorillas,
cc.ckatoos, bobolinks, tapirs, caper-
cailzie and giraffes.
No title has as yet been fixed upon
for the work owing to a slight con-
tretemps which has arisen from the
composite character of the libretto,
Yuan Shih-Kai having expressed a
strong preference for a Chinese name,
while Mr. YEATs holds out for a Celtic
designation. During the composition
of the work Professor de Banville lived
entirely on China tea, rice and potatoes
—in order to attune his system to the
triplex nature of the libretto—and was
arrayed in a costume which included
a turban, a saffron kilt, and a pig-tail
amongst its most impressive features.
It is hardly necessary to add that the
difficulties of the new work are gigantic
and Gargantuan. Professor de Banville,
in an interview with a representative
of the Bootle Clarion, declares that no
choral singers have ever been called
upon to perform such ſeats of sustained
enormity as those which are demanded
in his latest work. In the second trio
of the third Scherzo the soprani have
to sing a figure in rapid semiquavers
for fifty-four bars at a stretch, ranging
between C and E in alt. Professor
de Banville admits also that the strain
imposed on the semilunar ganglions of
the diaphragm by the extraordinary
bravura of the gorilla motif for the
basses in the Finale is, perhaps, exces-
sive. But he has been assured by
athletic experts that this is of the
greatest value for long-distance runners,
and he has accordingly applied to the
Olympic Fund for a grant of £5,000 for
his chorus. .

THE TRAGEDY OF THE CURTAI
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE chiefs of the Clan Donald cannot trace their line of
descent quite so far back as the fabled Phairshon, who
swore a feud against the Clan McTavish. For he, if the
legend is correct, had a son who married No.4 H's daughter,
and nearly spoilt the Flood by drinking up the water. But,
with that one possible or impossible exception, I doubt if
any Scotch family can boast a more ancient lineage. They
were sprung, according to the pedigree table published in
Mrs. STIRLING's fascinating book, Macdonald of the Isles
(MURRAY), from CoNN-CEUD-CHATACH, the hundredth
supreme King of Ireland, who held his court at Tara in the
second century of our era. Wherever he may be now, the
said CoNSTANTINE, Conn of a hundred fights, has certainly
no reason to blush for the unwarriorlike qualities of his
descendants. They have always been born fighters, and in
their continual feuds with their neighbours and each other
have never lacked the spirit that earned old “Centimachus”
his hybrid nickname. But the clan has moved with the
times. Two years ago the three rival claimants to the
chieftainship—CLANRANALD, GLENGARRY, and SLEAT—
agreed that henceforth, when any question of precedence
arose between them, it should be decided pro hac vice, not
with claymore and dirk, but by the spin of a coin or the
drawing of lots. So that nowadays, if two of them happen
to meet at the same flower-show or other public function,

sonal sidelight on Scottish history that I have ever read.
“Dngland has long been in labour, but at last she has
brought forth a man.” Thus FREDERICK THE GREAT, sum-
ming up the character of WILLIAM PITT and the condition
of affairs in Europe that he was called upon to face when in
1756 he formed his first Ministry. The story of his career,
bound up with the destiny of England at one of the most
critical epochs in her history, is treated in masterly fashion
by Mr. BASIL WILLIAMs in his Life of William Pitt (LONG-
MANs). The opening pages show a tendency to overload
the narrative with detail. One cannot clearly see the wood
for the trees. But this defect, doubtless due to excessive
conscientiousness, soon disappears with our introduction to
the private life of the great statesman. A disposition to
develop into what John FoRSTER's cabman described as
“a harbitrary gent” was aggravated by attacks of gout,
to which he was a martyr all his life, and in particular
at critical epochs when his presence was exceptionally
desired. His hastiness of temper, his downrightness of
speech, made him a host of enemies. But there was always
balm for him in his home. To the end of a long married
life his wife and he remained on the terms of lovers. Outside
his home PITT lived a stormy life. GEORGE II. liked him not,
and GEORGE III. long fought against the inevitableness of
no bloodshed takes place. From beginning to end the story


of the clan is rich in excitement and romance, and as a
his being called to the supreme direction of affairs. Happily

for England PITT, born in due season, was inevitable. He
based his Ministry on the principle of trust in the people,
quite a novelty in the mid-eighteenth century, insistence
upon it taking away the breath of successive GEORGEs.
Another of PITT's axioms of government, familiar enough
in these days, recognised the Fleet as the first line of
national defence. The royal GEORGES, anxious chiefly for
the safety and prosperity of the pitiful State of which they
were still Electors, spent millions of English money in
subsidising the Hanoverian army “England should put
herself on board her Fleet,” said PITT, and spent his chief
energy on building it up and maintaining it in the highest
state of efficiency. The life and times of the Great Com-
moner are not to be dealt with in a paragraph. The study of
both presented by Mr. BASIL WILLIAMs's two volumes forms
a liberal education in English history at a prolonged crisis.
If ever dainty book was labelled “For Christmas,” In
Powder and Crinoline, a sheaf of fairy tales from many
sources, retold by Sir ARTHUR QUILLER-Couch and
KAY NEILsen, is that book,
delicately illustrated by Mr.
and the publishers, Messrs. r.
that pretend to be nothing at all but what they are is a
different affair. I think I never read a more thoroughly
disarming preface than that which Mr. Hon Ace A.VACHELL
has written to the volume that he calls Loot (John MURRAy).
He chose the name, he says, “because whatever this
volume may raise in hard cash must be regarded as plunder
to which some critics may contend the author has no
warrantable right.” After that what is one to say? One
may protest that the scope of the tales is too brief, and
their action (being written for the popular magazines they
are full of action) too crowded to allow of the delicate
character-drawing in which Mr. VACHELL really excels;
one may say that many of them are unlikely to the verge
of the incredible; that (for example) young wives do not
pass themselves off successfully for months as boy-waiters
in order to support invalid husbands; or that understudies
at West-end theatres do not leap in one evening to the
prominence of whole columns in the daily Press. What
would you? In the domain of the commercial short story
these things are not only possible but compulsory. And
the stories of Mr. VACHELL remain exceptionally good of
Hodde:R AND STOUGHToN, are
heartily to be congratulated
their kind. Taken one or two
at a time you will find them
capital entertainment; in
on its winning appearance.
Not that it is a holly and
mistletoe affair—nothing so
obvious. The artist, deeply
in love with the decorative
possibilities of the crinoline,
seems to have demanded a set
of fairytales that could be in-
terpreted in that roomy mode,
and the ingenious “Q.” did
his best to supply them. I
can answer fully for their
charm, their discretion, their
fragrant, gentle, whimsical
humour. Perhaps of all the
stories that of “John and the
Ghosts,” the author's own
puckish version of the Berke-
|ley Square legend, is the most
intriguing, but to say I read every word of all the others
with delight is not to exaggerate. And, as for Mr. NEILSEN,
he has taken the most pleasant liberties with his theme, in-
volving in a common apotheosis the Trianon and the 1851
Exhibition with a happy audacity that lightly laughs at
antiquaries. He will not resent being reckoned, along with
so many contemporary draftsmen, especially in Germany,
a faithful disciple of the brilliant and perverse BEARDSLEy.
Indeed, his colour drawings are essentially patterns thought
out in line, with the colour as a graceful afterthought.
There are many of the authentic 13EARDSLEY notes and
phrases, but embroidered with an intelligence and origin-
ality which forbid any charge or suspicion of plagiarism.
I began to wonder whether it was only the older children
who would appreciate these retold tales and their attractive
colour commentary, until I remembered that, barring per-
haps the higher Cambridge undergraduate, there is no one
in the world so old as our modern nieces and nephews. So
I would urge the giving of this very charming book to both
the young children and the old.

larger doses the repetition,

matrimonial climax inevitable
in this genre tends to produce
some feeling of repletion, not
to say indigestion.
I suppose the life of a re-
viewer of novels must always
be one perpetual struggle be-
tween his prejudices and his
conscience. “Oh, I say,” cries

book at all.” “Read on,”
replies Conscience sternly.
“It's a perfectly good book.
It's simply your wicked na-
ture that makes you object to

mind while reading “IoTA's" latest work, Two Ways of
Love (Hutchinson), but it was not easy. You see, one
of my prejudices in fiction is against the spectacle of two
women fighting for one man. I never can bring myself to
believe that any man is worth fighting for. And here Mrs.
CAFFYN has so drawn Lord Bentwicke's character that I
cannot conceive why a brilliant woman like Gertrude
Allonby should have loved him; why Denne, the dreamy
Irish girl, should ever have married him, and why some-
body did not kick him. This made my enjoyment of the
book intermittent. I could see the technical skill of it:
some of the situations were handled with a firmness and
delicacy which won my complete admiration; and among
the many characters in the story there were few that were
not excellently drawn. But I could not sympathise. Was
this, as I have suggested, due simply to my wicked nature?
It is worth anyone's while to read the book and see for
themselves, if only for the sake of making the acquaintance
of Denne, of Elisabeth her sister, of Mrs. Charteris, and of
footman George. Those of you who happen to have been
at Rugby must resist the temptation to throw the book
down and stamp on it when you come to Jerry. That
unpleasant little bounder can hardly be intended to repre-
sent a typical Rugbeian. Usually, in novels, the heroine's
brother goes to Eton. It was a rare slice of luck for Eton
---
that Rugby got Jerry.

Norton's address. He intends to call
on him. I wonder if Mr. Norton

friendly warning.”
“I will,” I promised, and straight-
way took a taxi to Percy's flat, where
I found him lounging in an arm-chair,
in a mood of quiet self-satisfaction.
Beside him, on an occasional table,
stood an ear-trumpet—not one of those
little modern devices that save labour
for all concerned, but one of the regular
old-fashioned trumpets that require to
be held stiffly by the listener and
violently yelled down by the other
person. He eyed it in the friendliest
manner and, almost before I'd had time
to light one of his cigarettes, said:
“Look at that ' It's given me the
most delightful evening of my life.”
“I’ve heard about the evening,” I
assured him. “Parts of it at least.”
“Have you?” he said thoughtfully.
“Lady Aldersley annoyed?”
“Major Hackett is. She wants to
know if you are deaſ.”
“No,” said Percy. “I could be
again, if necessary, but I'm not—no.”
“Perhaps you had better tell me just
what happened,” I suggested.
“If you like.” He lit a cigarette
himself and puffed at it serenely. “It
was an experiment, as a matter of fact.
I was reading the other day how old
HERBERT SPENCER used to carry cotton-
wool about with him to put in his ears
when conversation bored him. It struck
me as a neat idea, but boorish and in-
complete. Why let bores go on boring?
Why not stop them 2 That would be a
lot better than merely ceasing to listen
oneself. Well, I happened to notice that
ear-trumpet at a pawnbroker's the same
day that I read about old SPENCER.
Yesterday, in fact. It was eighteen-
pence — a sum I possessed. So I
bought it, and took it with me to Lady
Aldersley's dinner. I knew there would
be some bores there. Lady Aldersley's
charming, but she likes a few foils.”
“Like yourself?”

don't want to hear about him every two

and explained that I was a bit deaf,
and we began to talk hunting. I forget
what I said or what he said, but at the
end of a minute there he was at it
again.
“‘All thanks to LLoyd GEORGE | he
said.
“I beg your pardon 2' I said, putting
up my trumpet.
“‘I said, “All thanks to LLOYD

“‘Didn't catch, I'm afraid,' I said,
shaking my head; and he butted into
the trumpet again.
“‘I said it was all thanks to LLoyd

“All thanks to whom 2' I inquired.
“‘LLoyd GEORGE,” he shouted. He
was pretty hoarse by then, having
talked too much all dinner-time, but I
gave him another chance to get it
right, which he accepted, and then I
said: ‘I can't agree with you. I'm a
loyal subject. I don't see that the
KING is in the least to blame.’
“I said “LLOYD GEORGE – LLoyd
GEORGE,' he bellowed, and I removed
the trumpet with a pretence of indig-
nation.
“If you're a Socialist,' I said, ‘I’d
rather not discuss the matter further.’
“‘Socialist he panted. ‘Socialist

“‘I'm afraid so,' I said.
“He tried to explain, and got purple
doing it, but it was no use, and he
could only sit and glare helplessly till
we went into the drawing-room. There
I heard him explaining pitifully to
various people that he'd been taken for
a Socialist by that deaf man. I lost
him after a bit, and forgot that I was
deaf for the evening. The fact is Lady
Aldersley introduced me to a very pretty
girl. We got quite friendly—I fancy
she had escaped from the Major too.
Anyway the trumpet was not in use,
and we were chatting away as in-
timately as possible when I became
aware of Major Hackett watching us.
From his expression you might have
thought I was LLOYD GEORGE. I tried
to get the trumpet going, but the girl
got up just then and said she must find
her aunt or somebody, and, though I
stuck to her for as long as possible, the
Major stuck on too. The moment I
was alone he was down on me, and I
barely had time to elevate the trumpet
when he began.

off with the trumpet.
“‘If it was a joke, Sir—joke,” he
stuttered.
“Ah, you mean your remark about
the KING 2 I'm very glad to hear it
was a joke. Not in the best of taste
perhaps, but still— Good night, Sir,"
I said coldly.
“I slipped into the crowd at that,
trumpet and all, and said farewell to
Lady Aldersley as soon as possible.
Sorry she's annoyed.”
Percy finished his narrative with his
cigarette, and was about to begin
another when the telephone rang.
“Excuse me a moment,” he said,
and went towards it. “By Jove,” he
went on, “if it isn't the Major. Come

TWO POETS.
I KNEw a poet once; as poets go
He was a most companionable man;
And oft with me, who have no lyric art
And cannot call a regiment of rhymes
To serve my purpose as a poet can,
He proved his skill and built his palace of scng,
Rhyme set on rhyme and verse on gleaming verse,
And towers of music gay with flaunting flags,
So that I marvelled, saying, “If for me,
Who have no music, he can thus disclose
His high majestical and aily notes,
How will it be if he should chance to mect
Another poet tuneful as himself?
Then surely Swis BURNE will be left behird
And MILTON be out-Miltoned ; SHAKSPEARE's self
Will own a rival and the Mermaid Inn
With all its coruscations be revived.”
So did I reason, and one day it chanced
As I had hoped—he met a second poet;

FURTHER DEALINGS OF MR. MALLABY-DEELEY.
WE have it on the highest authority that Mr. MALLABY-
DEELEY purchased Manchester last week for a sum approxi-
mating to £16,000,000. Mr. MALLABY-DEELEY chanced
accidentally to hear that Manchester was in the market
when crossing Ticcadilly. With the greatest nonchalance
he paused and wrote a few figures in the mud with his
walking-stick, dropped into a telephone box and bought
the lot. It is, we believe, the intention of the enterprising
Member for Harrow to spend about a million on wash-
ing Manchester, and then to put it cn the market as a
Garden City.
The purchaser of Westminster Abbey and the House of
Commons, about whose identity so much curiosity has
been expressed, is the Member for the Harrow Division,
Mr. MALLABY-DEEI EY. It is, we believe, his intention to
erect a large up-to date hotel on the site of the House
of Commons. Mr. MALLABY-DEELEY is of opinion that
London is sadly deficient in large, bright hotels, and he
thinks that such a novelty would prove a successful specu-
lation. He interds to reserve Westminster Abbey for his
own use, and all admirels of business enterprise will hope
that it will be very long before he finds a use for it.
It is understood that the purchaser of Berlin (including
Potsdam) is Mr. MALLABY-D ELEY. He was approaching
the fourtecnth hole at Mitcham when a passing aeroplanist
informcd him that Berlin was for sale. Mr. MALLABY-
DEELEY instantly marconied an offer.
IHe wishes it to be understocd that he intends to give
no terants notice to quit. In reply to a message of enquiry
from a Very IIigh Quarter Mr. MALLABY-DEELEY has sent
assurances that so long as the Palace rent is paid regularly
no questions will be asked, and the usual allowances for
decorations will be made at the end of the Spring quarter.
Our own representative (who only gained access to him
by the innocent pretence of being a Duke fleeing from the
greedy hand of a Chancellor) found Mr. MAILABY-DEELEY
engaged in opening telegrams. “Offers are pouring in on
me,” explained the enterprising M.P. “Only this morning
I have becn asked to buy the manorial rights of Pudsey, the
Isle of Man (with sole use of its advertising agent), and two
million acres of deer-forest; and here is a wire from
General HUERTA asking what is my spot-cash price for
Mexico. Of course to-day is not what I call a really busy
day. Do look in to-morrow. Perhaps business will be
stirring then.” And with the greatest courtesy Mr. MALLABY-
DEELEY bowed our representative out. -

Cotton-wool is an excellent thing in its

| exerts a more consistently explosive
*| influence on the gentle reader. -
• His latest work, The Savour of Sin,
is the life-history of a rebel. , Mordred
| Blurt, for that is his aptly-chosen name,
is expelled from a public school for

cate boy, in the back, and resolves to
be revenged on the social code which
has interfered with the expression of
his individuality. Entering the Army

sells an important secret to a foreign

a rich widow with three children, and

by conventional standards, is open to
criticism, but so convincing is Mr.Crow's

so plausible his arguments, that our
sympathy is enlisted with the hero at
every stage of his chameleonic career.
Not since DUMAs has any romancer ex-

Mordred Blurt is splendide mendaa and,
judged by the test of uninterrupted

wholesale nature of his revenge, but
there is an artistic fitness in its com-

As a writer in a leading journal

monotony have their inevitable penal-

Mr. Crow the vogue which he enjoys
in virtue of his enforcement of this
great doctrine. Whether his novel is
altogether suitable for the nursery, or
can be safely entrusted to readers who

THE ANTIQUE.
(Anticipating an article in “The
Magazine of the Curio Collector”
for November, 2113 A.D.)
GRANFER JARGE sat at the door of
his model cottage, chewing his patent
plug and apparently oblivious of the
approach of the well-dressed stranger.
The latter, James Wilberforce to be
exact, appeared to be equally oblivious
of Granfer Jarge and the model cottage,
prominently displayed in the window
of which was an old wooden box about
ten inches long by six deep. Than
this nothing appeared to be further
from the thoughts of both, as they
suddenly noticed each other and ex-
changed greetings.
“Hal” said Wilberforce
“and how goes the world
with you, my friend?”
“It be a pleasant day,

“I wouldna part with that there
box for three hundud pound,” pursued
Jarge with all the obstinacy of a
foolish old man.
“We'll try you with two hundred,”
said Wilberforce jocundly.
“But I might let you have it for four
hundud, seeing as you wants it so bad.”
“Pooh 1 ° scoffed the other. “I’ll
not go a penny beyond two fifty.”
Jarge became businesslike. “I’ll
tell you what I will do for you, Sir.
I'll take three fifty, spot cash.”
In his excitement Wilberforce did
not notice, as you have done, that
Jarge had dropped his various folms of
lingo. He offered three hundred pounds,
made it guineas, and the box was his.
“This, Sir," said the Bond street.
Zur,” said Jarge.
Conversation having con-
tinued in this strain for
half an hour or so, Wilber-
force at last mentioned,
quite incidentally, the box.
| “A curious old thing,” said
| he.
“Ay, that it be,” said
Jarge, and the conversation
turned to other topics.
It was Jarge who brought
it back. “My granfer, he
used to keep his bits of
string in that same box,
and his granfer before him

| “And you?” asked Wil-

“I keeps my

Wilberforce picked it up and ex-
amined it with studied indifference.
“I should rather like one of these,”
said he.
Jarge dared say he would. “They
be hard come by these days and I
wouldna part with that one for twa
hundud pound, that I wouldna.”
Wilberforce laughed merrily at this.
“I expect if I were to offer you thirty
shillings down—?”
“I wouldna part with that for twa
hundud and fifty pound,” said Jarge in
an even voice, looking away into the
far distance.
Wilberforce seized the opportunity
to examine his face closely. Then he
laughed again cheerfully. “We'll test
that, my friend,” he declared boister-
ously. “Just for the fun of the thing

THE KING'S SONS.
“TELL me a story,” said Margery.
“What sort of a story 3”
“A fairy story, because it's Christmas
| time.”
“But you know all the fairy stories.”
“Then tell me a new fairy story.”
“Ifight,” I said.
Once upon a time there was a King
who had three sons. The eldest son
was a very thoughtful youth. He
always had a reason for everything
he did, and sometimes he would say
things like “Economically it is to the
advantage of the State that — ” or
“The civic interests of the community
demand that "before doing something
specially horrid. He didn't want to be
unkind to anybody, but he took what
he called a “large view" of things;
and if you happened to ask for a third
help of plum-pudding he took the large
view that you would be sorry about it
next morning—and so you didn't have
your plum-pudding. He was called
| Prince Proper.
The second son was a very wise
youth. You couldn't catch him any-
how. If you asked him whether he
knew the story of the three wells, or
“Why does a chicken cross the road 2"
or anything really amusing like that,
he would always say, “Oh, I heard that
years ago!"—and whenever you began
“Adam and Eve and Pinchme” he
would pinch you at once without
waiting like a gentleman until you had
got to the end of the verse. He was
called l’rince Clever.
And the third son was just wonder-
fully lºcautiful. He had the most
marvellously pink cheeks and long
golden hair that you have ever seen.
I don't much care for that style myself,
but in the country in which he lived it
was admired more than I can tell you.
He was called Prince Goldenlocks. I'll
give you three guesses why.
Now the King had reigned a long
time, so long that he was tired of being
king, and he often used to wonder
which of his sons ought to succeed
him. Of course nowadays they never
wonder, and the eldest son becomes
king at once, and quite right too; but
in those days it was generally left to
the sons to prove which among them-
selves was the most worthy. Some-
times they would all be sent out to find
the magic Dragon's Tooth, and only
one would come back alive, which
would save a lot of trouble; or else,
after a lot of discussion, they would be
told to go and find beautiful Princesses
for themselves, and the one which
brought back the most beautiful
Princess—but very often that would
way of all was to call in a Fairy to
help. A Fairy has all sorts of tricks for
finding out about you, and her favourite
plan is to pretend to be something else
and see what you do.
So the King called in a Fairy and
said : “To-morrow I am sending out
my three sons into the world to seek
their fortune. I want you to test them
for me and find out which is the most
fitted to succeed to my throne. If it
shou'd happen to be Prince Goldenlocks
—but, of course, I don't want to in-
fluence you in any way.”
“Leave it to me,” said the Fairy.
“You agree, no doubt, that the quality
most desirable in a king is love and
kindliness * >
“Y-yes,” said the King doubtfully.
“I was sure of it. Well, I have a
way of putting this quality to the test
which has never yet failed.” And with
that she vanished. She could have
gone out at the door quite easily, but
she preferred to vanish.
I expect you know what her way
was. You have read about it often in
your fairy books. On the next day, as
Prince Proper was coming along the
road, she appeared suddenly in front of
him in the shape of a poor old woman.
“Please give me something to buy a
crust of bread, pretty gentleman,” she
pleaded. “I’m starving.”
Prince Proper looked at her sternly.
“Economically,” he said, “it is to
the advantage of the State that the
submerged classes should be a charge
on the State itself and not on indi-
viduals. The civic interests of the
community demand that promiscuous
charity should be sternly discouraged.
Surely you see that for yourself 2"
The Fairy didn't quite. The lan-
guage had taken her by surprise. In
all her previous adventures of this kind,
two of the young Princes had refused
her roughly, and the third had shared
his last piece of bread with her. This
adventure was going all wrong.
“Let me explain it to you more fully,”
went on Proper, and for an hour and
twenty-seven minutes he did so. Then
he went on his way, leaving a dazed
Fairy behind him.
By-and-by Prince Clever came along.
Suddenly he saw a poor old woman in
front of him.
“Please give me something to buy a
crust of bread,” she pleaded. “I’m
starving.”
I’rince Clever burst into a roar of
laughter.
“You don't catch me,” he said.
“I’ve read about this a hundred times.
You're not an old woman at all; you're
a Fairy.”
“W-what do you mean?” she stam-
“This is a silly test of Father's.
Well, you can tell him he's got one son
who's clever enough to see through
him.” And he went on his way.
By-and-by Prince Goldenlocks came
along. I need not say that he did all
that you would expect of a third and
youngest son who had pink cheeks,
long golden hair and (as I ought to
have said before) a very loving nature.
He shared his last piece of bread with
the poor old woman . . .
(Surely he will get the throne!)
But the Fairy was an honest Fairy.
She did understand Proper's point of
view ; she had to admit that, if Clever
saw through her dec. ption, it was
honourable of him to have said so.
And though, of course, her loving heart
was all for Prince Goldenlocks she felt ||
that it would not be fair to award the
throne to him without a further trial.
So she did another thing that she was
very fond of doing. She changed her-
self into a pretty little dove and—right |
in front of Prince Proper—she flew
with a hawk in pursuit of her.

think there was a good deal in this—

thought of. Anyhow, after solilo-
quising for forty-seven minutes 1’rince
Proper went on his way; and by-and-
by Prince Clever came along.
You can guess what Clever said.
“My whiskels " he said, “this is
older than the last. I knew this in my
cradle.” With one of those nasty
sarcastic laughs that I hate so much he
went on his way; and by-and-by Prince
Goldenlocks came along.
(Now then, Goldenlocks, the throne
is almost yours!)

said.

Rapidly he fitted an arrow to his bow
and with careful aim let fly at the
pursuing hawk . . .
I say again that Prince Goldenlocks
was the most beautiful youth you have
ever seen in your life, and he had a very
loving nature. But he was a poor shot.
He hit the dove . . .

NO PRISMATIC HAIR FOR MEN.
THE DECISION of THE NUT KING.
THE new fashion, which is being
introduced into London from Paris,
of brightly coloured hair for women, to
go with different costumes, has been
causing considerable panic in lower Nut
circles, but happily their unrest is now
OWer.
A West End coiffeur having ex-
pressed himself in print as favouring the
new feminine mode, and recommended
various shades of hair-dye in green and
blue and purple, a number of the
more noticeable Nuts began to wonder
whether or not some such adjunct to
their beauty would not also be forced
upon them. But the heart of Nutville
now beats normally once more. The
fiat has gone forth.
Interviewed by a representative of
Mr. Punch, the leading Nut, or Philo-
pena, declared firmly against any such
change. “Our trouble is this,” he said.
“We feel that we must keep pace with
the girls. Yet no self-respecting Filbert
could dye his moustache blue or green.
For two reasons. One is that he dis-
likes the idea; the other, that very
likely he has no moustache. All Bar-
don't like them; others can't grow them.
Being a plain, normal man, Gridley
A Nut is no less a Nut because he is 'possessed a capacity for making good
clean-shaved. It is the hair that tells
with a Nut, not the moustache; and no
Nut wants green or blue hair."
“But surely,” our representative said,
“if you had neckties and socks to match,
your hair might be very charming if it
were dyed. Think of the symphony;
you might even be in danger of being
stolen, like Leonardos."
“We are now,” he said with pride.
“Do not be impetuous in resisting so
alluring an adjunct, I implore you,” said
our representative as he rose to leave.
The Nut King pondered for a moment.
“No,” he said at last, “I think not.
Let the ladies have it alone. We must
be magnanimous now and then."
-
BEYOND REFORMI.
GRIDLEY was an average sort of
man, such as you may see in Throg-
morton Street on any day of the week
except Sunday. Voneril, on the other
hand, was a teetotaler, non-smoker,
early riser, two-meal-a-day vegetarian
—and, if you can think of anything
else of that sort, he was that as well.
Still, Woneril was sometimes human ;
resolutions; and the end of the year
found him talking to Woneril at the
club with that anxious expression on
his face which the turner-over of new
leaves is accustomed to wear.
“Thank you for telling me all about
vegetarianism,” said Gridley gloomily,
“but I really do not think it would
suit me. At the same time I must
make an effort to limit myself to, say,
three square meals a day in the New
Year. And I am not sure that it would
not be well for me to knock off a cigar
or two "-and as he continued his
appearance became more and more
dejected.
“Well, Gridley,” said Woneril briskly,
his healthy face beaming genially,
“while I admit that men with habits
like mine have a rotten time at
Christmas, you must agree that they
are saved a lot of worry when the
New Year comes."
English as she is wrote.
“The sort of Champagne one's guests, on
tasting the first glass, turn to their host with
an unspoken look of admiration.”—Advt.
Can it be that “return " is meant, the

celonas do not have moustaches. Some
admiration being for his pluck 2
he had not always been these things.

NEW YEAR NOVELTIES.
Mr. Punch is glad to note that the
sensible custom is spreading of choosing
gifts that will be of practical use to
their recipients during the New Year.
He is pleased to give publicity to a few
of the novelties displayed —
Messrs. Armstrong-Bilberry have
devised the “CIVILWAR SURTouT,”
a smart slip-on garment that should be
very popular during the social in-
clemencies of 1914. This sound and
protective storm-coat is woven through-
out of the finest Harveyised steel, and
reinforced over the heart by three-inch
plating. Loopholes for revolver fire
in street fighting are clevelly masked
by the large black-and-white check
pattern which is painted on this really
natty overcoat of the man about town.
They also ensure the ventilation so
essential in all heavy garb.
The “Civil war” has already caught
on. Orders have been received from
Mr. John REDMoND, Lord LoNDoN-
DERRY, Sir Edward CARson, Mr. JAMEs
LARKIN and several other leaders who
favour a stout equipment against the
disturbances of what promises to be an
exceptionally stormy year. Travellers
contemplating the crossing of the Irish
Sea cannot be given a more useful
present than the “Civil war Surtout.”
The increasing number of golfers
who naturally resent the interruption
by business of the real game of life will
welcome the sporting little “PUTTUM-
BRELLA" sold by Messrs. Hopage and
Co. The removable knob of this um-
brella is a veritable “gutty,” disguised
by Japanese carvings that give an ex-
cellently true run. The ribs and silk
cover are instantly detachable, leaving a
perfectly balanced putter. The familiar
disc on to which the frame of an ordi-
nary umbrella fastens is of convex
aluminium, and makes an ever-ready
“hole.” The “Puttumbrella, ’’ is unde-
tectable by partners, employers, head-
clerks, supervisors and all other pests,
and it can be re-fixed (according to
tests that Messrs. Hopage have made
in their own offices) between the time
a tread is heard on the stairs and the
opening of the door.
A really timely novelty has been
invented by Madame Clarkson
Pomeroyd, the famous beauty specialist.
The “‘Giocond A' ToILET CASKET’’ is
sure to find a place on the dressing-
table of every butterfly of fashion. We

ing preparation. Let it suffice to re-
mark that its basic ingredient consists

WINTER SPORTS.
How To Choose: A Swiss HoTEL.
“IN order to estimate the style of a
hotel count the bathrooms and private
sitting-rooms and roughly measure the
size of the reception rooms. The ratio
of these to the size of the hotel will be
in inverse ratio of life in the hotel to
the simple life.” That is the advice
given in The Public Schools' Alpine
Sports Club Year Book, by a Director
of Alpine Sports, Ltd., and no doubt
he ought to know; but, although it is
a good idea in its way, it does not really
take us very far. The thing is getting
more difficult every year. It is not, I
would have you understand, that there
is any lack of data on which to form
an opinion. Quite the reverse. You
cannot in this matter begin to make
the faintest, most timid and tentative
enquiry without being instantly over-
whelmed, glutted, smothered in informa-
tion. If the people who run these
things would be content to send you
particulars of only two hotels – one
obviously good and the other clearly
rotten—you might, without any sur-
render of your right of unfettered
choice, know what to do; but as it is
I have an economical friend in the
North who no longer finds it necessary
to take in a daily newspaper in winter
as there is always a supply of material
for lighting fires since the day, two years
ago, when he sent an enquiring post-
card about Swiss hotels.
There are some who choose by the
picture at the top. That is a mistake.
You will be disappointed. The three
small spruce trees covered with snow
which stand in a row on the extreme left
will not be there when you arrive. The
flag will not be flying like that, or if it
! is it means that there is an abominable
wind which makes the place quite unfit
to live in. The skating rink will not be
covered with all those graceful people
doing those beautiful figures. There
will merely be a few ordinary people,
like yourself, scratching round in the
usual way. And the old gentleman on
a toboggan, who is uproariously flyin
down the slope in front of the hotel at
such a breakneck speed, with his com-
forter trailing behind him, will probably
—when you arrive—be painfully prod-
ding himself along with a stick in either
hand. No, it is a mistake to choose by
the picture.
Some choose by the altitude, but
there is apt to be a touch of snobbery
about that. Some choose by the name
of the proprietor. I admit that I like
one with a hyphen myself, such as
Baumgrab-Egger or Rikli-Metzenheim.
But this is a chancy method at best.
although at first sight it seems a des-
perate course, to choose by the plan of
the rooms. Get some pins and spread
the sheet out on the table. First mark
down the lift. If there is no lift, do
not accept a photographic dark-room
as a substitute, but give it up and try
another hotel. Then hunt out the
dining-room and observe if it happens
to have any windows that open upon
the outer air. If it is buried in the
heart of the building, with winter-
gardens on three sides of it, give it up:
Lady (amriously, to reckless painter). “Do
BE CAREFUI, MY GOOD MAN ; MY I.I.TTLE
Pong IE 's JUST UNDER You R LADDER!''
and start again. You will now mark
down the reception-rooms, count the
bathrooms and carefully estimate the
number of square metres in the passages.
(People always put their empty lug-
gage in the passages, and you want to
know, of course, if you are likely to fall
over it in the dark.) Roughly cal-
culate the number of balconies, then
turn back to the picture and count the
chimneys.
Now we may make a few helpful
calculations. The balconies multiplied
by the bathrooms, with the chimneys
added, will give us a useful index
maintained. This may be divided into
the bedrooms, plus the length of the
ballroom in metres. Now throw in the
lift, and the result will be in inverse
ratio to the probabilities of Tango Teas.
If you want to know whether you may
look for finger-bowls, discover first of
all if any charge is made for the band.
If not, it is an excellent sign. It may
mean that you are to get your music
for nothing, and that is good. It may
mean that there is no band, and that is
magnificent. The price of the band, if
|there is one, in francs, multiplied by
the radiators in the ballroom and taken
in the strictest proportion with the
size of the winter-garden, will give you
a sound working idea concerning the
prospects of fancy-dress balls.
To get at the quality of the food it
is not a bad plan to estimate and con-
sider the number of miles to the coast
(fish); to Paris (eggs—so they say);
to Berne (salads and fresh vegetables);
and to Ceylon or China (tea). But the
question of the tea is not so simple as
it seems. Afternoon tea is not inclusive,
you must understand, but in order to
checkmate the exodus to the cafés it
is charged at a fixed rate of so much
a week, so you may as well drink it,
anyhow. -- --" "
We hope that these few hints may
be of service to those who like to go
into a matter of this sort and make
themselves masters of it. For our own
part, when the time comes to make up
our mind, we generally blindfold our-
selves and pick our hotel from the
waste-paper basket.

THE mainspring of one of the current révues is an ador-
able lady who sings sprightly syncopated songs from time
to time and, in between, smiles expansively and chatters
volubly at the audience, leaving the stoniest critic with
not a word to say against her, except, possibly that, if any-
body else did what she did, it would be thoroughly bad art.
It has now been my luck to meet in a novel this same
intimate cheeriness, which assumes or creates a correspond-
ing vivacity in the person addressed, and is, as far as I can
see, a gift peculiar to the American artiste. In Van Cleve
(MACMILLAN) Mrs. MARY S. WATTs operates on material of
a different and, happily, very much better class than the
plot of a music-hall production; she tells the tale of a young
man's life in the States, who encounters every kind of
domestic, military and commercial complications and is
involved in love affairs of all sorts. There appear in the
tale also a boastſul major who has never seen action in his
life, a weak-kneed youth addicted to strong drink but other-
wise excellent company, a semi-demi-mondaine with an eye
to the main chance, and a bevy of the most unreasonable and
amusing female relatives I have ever met. The sinking of
the Maine looms large and real, and about the whole situa-
tion, at home and abroad, Mrs. WATTs rattles on with a lively
exuberance of phrase and a breadth of mind that are rarely
found together. With the manner of spelling in which she,
with the cussedness of her race, persists, I shall always
quarrel; but with her humour I am content. If it is typi-
inactive in the seat of the scornful.
If, before reading Mr. ERNEST THoMPson SETON's Wild
Animals at Home (HopDER AND SToughTon), I had been com-
pelled to face that fearsome inquisition, a General Knowledge
Paper, and had been asked to write chattily about the chip-
munk, the coyote, and the sneak-cat, I should have sat
Now, however, I am not
only prepared to tell you a great deal about these animals, but
also to encourage you to believe that it would be my fault
if you were bored in the telling. Without being in the
least didactic Mr. SEToN is teaching all the time, and I

startling, and I was afraid that he was meaning to be
humorous when I read, “I have a profound admiration for
the skunk. Indeed, I once maintained that this animal
was the proper emblem of America.” But before I had
finished the chapter I was equipped to defend the skunk
against all comers. Respectfully I raise my hat to this
brilliant advocatus diaboli. The sketches and photographs
with which the book is illustrated cannot be beaten in
quality, but they are apt, by force of numbers, to interfere
with a pure enjoyment of the text. For Mr. SETON's pen
is even mightier than his camera.

It is quite the funniest thing its author has ever written.
I can imagine Mr. W. W. JAcobs reading it and wishing
that he had thought of the idea for one of his Bob Pretty
stories. But then the atmosphere is so peculiarly Irish
that it may be that only Mr. BIRMINGHAM could have
handled it satisfactorily. I have met people who do not
enjoy this author's humour, but I think that even they
would be thawed by this story of Mr. Peter Fogarty, the
inn-keeper, and his manoeuvres to counteract the baleful
influence of the temperance reformers in his village. But
of all the sketches in the book perhaps the one calculated
to give the greatest pleasure to the Saxon reader is “The
Exile from Erin,” as satisfying a satire on a particularly
irritating pose as I have ever read. Desmond O'Donoghue
and his Chelsea circle are a delight—from the two earnest
young men, both atheists, who learned to dance Irish jigs
because, being possessed by the idea that Irish priests were
opposed to dancing, they “hoped to do something towards
breaking the power of the Church by becoming expert jig-
dancers,” to the young lady who danced jigs, “hoping in
that way to get in touch with the fairies.” As for Mr.
O'Donoghue himself, –- -
“there is,” says the author,
“so far as I can find out,
only one thing which he
will not do for Ireland;
and that is, live there.
But we must not blame
him for that. Unlimited
patriotism is too much to
expect from any man."
***
I hesitate to recall how
long it is since first Mrs.
HoDGSON BURNETT en-
listed my sympathies; º
here she is doing it again
as freshly and skilfully as
ever in her latest story,
to which she has given
the perplexing title of
T. Tembarom (Hod DER
Old Lady. “P'RAPs You wouldN'T MIND JUST NUDGIN' ME when we
GETS TO THE NEXT STATION.—I'M A-GoIN'. To 'AVE A WINK o' SLEEP."
KATE Douglas Wiggin makes a charming little chronicle
of simple loves and joys and sorrows out of The Story of
Waitstill Baxter (HopDER AND SToughton) and her half-
sister, Patience, in their obscure New Hampshire village.
For the sake of her little sister, Waitstill puts off her devoted
lover, Ivory Boynton, until Patience makes her own secret,
happy, romantic match, and then, in defence of her, explains
to her father, Deacon Barter, a miracle of sordid meanness
and petty tyranny, her long withheld opinion of him, with
a candour which even so good a girl must have found
extraordinarily pleasant when once she got going. I wonder
if I am right in detecting some carelessness in Mrs. Wiggin's
later methods. Does she not tend just to deal out the
sections of her story to her characters and make them pass
them on to the reader without troubling about subtleties of
characterisation? Of course this does not apply to her
grotesques—she draws her curmudgeon of a deacon with
gusto; but doesn't she give her nice ordinary people rather
long and unlikely narrative speeches 2: I know it is a jolly
simple method which I should undoubtedly adopt myself,
but that would be for lack of the skill and experience of
- - the author of Rebecca of i
Sunnybrook Farm. How-
ever, here is a pretty story,
prêttily told, and it has
the rare and surely not
always unwelcome quality
of rather accepting and
making the best of a tradi-
tional morality than of
attem.pting a brand-new
one trimmed to the very,
very latest requirements.
On the crushed straw-
bery paper-wrapper round
the cover of One of the
Crowd Messrs. CHAPMAN:
AND HALL assert that the
pages of MME. ALBANESI's
new novel “scintillate with
the glitter of the foot-
AND STOUGHToN). Perhaps, indeed, I should be justified
in calling this the latest version of a before-told story, as
you will understand when I explain that T. Tembarom
is the nickname given to an American youth of obscure
and apparently humble birth, who from the position of
ill-paid reporter on a New York paper is suddenly trans-
lated to be the owner of Temple Barholm in Lancashire and
seventy thousand a year. But if T. Tembarom is somewhat
obviously a relation of the famous Fauntleroy he is certainly
none the worse for that. Better indeed, for what Mrs.
Hodgson BURNETT does not know about the picturesque
details of coming into unexpected affluence isn't worth
knowing. There are scenes in Tembarom's initiation worthy
to rank with that immortal moment (how beloved of my
youth !) when his little velvet-suited lordship is shown
the room full of toys. There is also much else that makes
for a pleasant entertainment: a mystery, some slight
roguery, and at least one character, the Duke of Stone, quite
excellently portrayed. The mystery, perhaps, is no great
matter; just transparent enough to keep us mildly im-
patient for its revelation, and in a state of flattered
superiority to the characters in the tale, who could not perceive
that Strangeways, the man without memory whom Tembarom
had picked up in the streets, was really the missing—well,
you know. A happy and picturesque novel, untroubled by
realism, that I have much enjoyed, both for its own sake
lights, which do not, however, outshine the deeper flame of
love.” On the fly-leaf MME. ALBANESI herself has written,
“Is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new 2
it hath been already of old time, which was before us; ” but
it is only fair to add that she acknowledges the sentiment to
be a citation from Ecclesiastes i. 10. Personally, if I may be
allowed to get in a word edgeways, I found that where the
authoress was dealing with the life of mean lodging-houses
and the language and behaviour of musical-comedy favour-
ites, both “on” and “off,” her book was exceedingly
bright and entertaining; but when she strayed outside this
field to thrill us with genuine romance the construction
of her story and its characters were of a very common-
place and conventional kind. Sophie Beamish, the derelict
daughter of a great actor, being forced to adopt “the "pro-
fession in order to earn money, became the friend of Miss
Boodie Gaye, a transatlantic star whose orbit was apparently
at the eastern end of the Strand; and for Miss Boodie Gaye
I have nothing but the sincerest admiration. Not since “The
Chorus Lady" left London have I heard such a fine flow of
American theatrical back-talk as gushed from this siren's
lips, and I guess that Sir Robert Devrington, the “mother's
joy-boy” who for so long “did the dog Tray act” after her,
ut eventually married Sophie, will sometimes weary for
his old flame. Further, I am practically certain that the
author of Ecclesiastes would have been startled some if he

M UNITIONS OF PEACE.
An Episode at the Belfast Customs.
Now it began to be recognised that there was a general prejudice in the country against Civil War. It is
true that nobody—not even the Earl of HALSBURY –could remember from experience what even a sort of Civil War
at home was like; but history showed that fratricidal strife had never suited the national genius or been really popular
in these islands. Consequently the practice had fallen into desuetude during the last few centuries.
There were reasons, too, why a Civil War would be peculiarly inconvenient in the conditions of the time.
Although Sir Edward CARSON had been at pains to say that the Army was bound, by all the laws of loyalty, to shoot
at him if it was told to, it was felt that the spectacle of British troops fighting under Mr. REDMOND's two flags—
the Irish and the American—against the bearers of the Union Jack, would have in it the essential elements of a
Music-Hall Révue, which is to say that, while those who took part in it might find it humorous, it would greatly
shock the intelligence of the spectator.
Then, again, a Civil War would be a bad example to Mexico; and, once more, at a moment when our Military
Forces were a bit below themselves in point of numbers, it was not fair to Germany to throw fresh temptation in
her way.
Finally, a Civil War would distract people's attention from the prior claims of the Land Campaign.
Under these circumstances there was a feeling that the leaders on both sides ought to meet and talk things over
together. And, indeed, they even went so far as to talk separately about talking things over together. And this they
did on party platforms, where the other side is never present. And each side protested that all this shouting at one
another on party platforms was rotten, and kept on doing it.
And, as a basis for conversations (in case they ever took place), the one side said that, if they could only have
their own way about all points that really counted, they were fully prepared to make concessions about anything that
didn't matter at all. And the other side said just the same.
And the trouble was that the one side, having committed themselves very deeply, wanted to save their faces; and
that the other side, not having any faces to save, wanted the People to be consulted. “For,” said they, “if the People
are against this great wrong being done to Ulster, they will put us into power and the great wrong won't be done; but,
if they are in favour of it, then we wash our hands of the Civil War.”
But it was never made quite clear why Ulster should be any better pleased at having this great wrong done

just because the People thought it would be good for her.

Meanwhile, since it seemed probable that, unless somebody began to do something, Civil War would be well
advanced before the conversations had started, it was thought that, if we were to have fighting at all, it would be best
for only one side to be armed. So a Proclamation was issued in the KING's name that no unofficial weapons or
other deadly wherewithals should be admitted into Ireland.
Now the Customs House Officers, fearful of imposition, were instant to investigate all baggage, whatever pro-
fession was made as to its contents. And in this way a great, amount of material designed for the destruction of snipe
and woodcock was detained under suspicion. But also much clever work was done, and many disguises penetrated.
Thus, a gun-case labelled “Monna Lisa" was not allowed to enter the country. And a very large trunk, though it
bore the deceptive superscription, “Canary Seed,” was also debarred from admission, on the ground that a bayonet
was observed to be protruding through a fissure in its side.
Now the Right Honourable AUGUSTINE BIRRELL, being the Chief Secretary for Ireland and therefore responsible
for its integrity, presided over these detective operations. And in the execution of his duty he came upon a box that
bore a strong similitude to a cartridge-magazine. And, giving it an authoritative tap, he said to the owner, who had
the air of an inveterate sportsman, “Have you anything to declare? Ammunition, guns, rifles, pom-poms, maxims,
howitzers, submarines, mines or pea-shooters?” -
“I have nothing to declare,” replied the proprietor of the box, “except that I am a Sage. Sages should be
exempt from suspicion.” -
“I am a bit of a Sage myself,” replied Mr. BIRRELL, “yet I am not exempt from public suspicion. And, though
Philosophers profess to ignore externals, they are quick to suspect a brother Philosopher when appearances are against
him. Hence I ask, How comes it that, if its contents are not lethal, your box should so closely resemble what I am
told is known as a cartridge-magazine 2"
“That is only my humour,” explained the Sage.
“I am a bit of a humourist myself,” replied Mr. BIRRELL; “yet I am constantly reminded that there are
certain affairs of which a light treatment is not permissible. Only the other day I read a leaderette in The Globe
headed ‘Dangerous Humour, in which that guardian of the public weal attacked Mr. Punch for publishing a gay
article entitled ‘A Vision of Ireland's Armageddon.'”
“It baffles my poor comprehension,” replied the Sage, “that a journal which in all heavy seriousness has done
its best to encourage Ulster to prepare for Civil War should object to an article which, if it were likely to produce the
effect predicted of it, would only be assisting towards the same result. But as a matter of fact, as you well know, Sir,
there is no better solvent of a strained situation than clean and impartial ridicule. I take no shame that the article in
question should have appeared in one of my own pages."
“My dear old friend!" exclaimed Mr. BIRRELL. “Your hump had escaped me, for my attention was confined
to your front view. But I ought to have recognised you by your genial countenance. Permit me to pass your baggage
unopened.”
: pen, On the contrary,” replied Mr. Punch, “I insist on revealing the matter within; for in my humble and unbiassed
opinion it constitutes the most desirable of imports. Its nature, I admit, is explosive, but it only operates when brought
into contact with kindred natures made for mirth. Without its presence in the home, no form of Home Rule, even by
consent, is conceivable; on the other hand, Ulster will adore it, and Ulster will be right.” -
And on this note of optimism Mr. Punch unlocked his magazine and exposed to view his
One juniorth and forty-fifth tolume.
