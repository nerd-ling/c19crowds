AN ANTIDOTE FOR CHRISTMAS.
IF Boxing Day finds you dyspeptic and worn
There's a hare in the roots, there's a holloa, a view,
And a little bit peevish perhaps ;
And the pack like a torrent is running,
If Christmas has left you fair reascn to mourn
And there'll always be glimpses of "hound work" for you
Some sad gastronomical lapse ;
If you like to run cunning.
Come out across country—the going is good-
If the puddingy plough tries your patience and pluck
And your festal-board sin you may shrive,
You can make up a lot down the hill,
For the beagles are meeting at Waddington Wood
And, helped by a check and a "circle," with luck
At 12.45.
You can shout your “ Whoo-whoop” at the kill;
There's dew on the meadow, there's scent with a sting, Though hot and dishevelled and palpably blown,
There's wire (don't forget) in the fence,
And mud-spattered up to your middle,
There's sport with the "jelly dogs" fit for a king,
A Boxing Day run with the beagles, you 'll own,
Though a "cap" is your only expense;
Makes
you
fit as a fiddle.

A runner—in the gorse there. Where's old Rock ?

I hate this dog's work. . . Bang goes half-a-crown!
No feathered thing shall curse, in act to die,
I might have laid a score of pheasants flat

That waits upon my pleasure, sitting tight,

Just when, and where, I like.

THE HALO THEY GIVE THEMSELVES.
(NOTE. Mr. Punch is in the extraordinarily fortunate position of being able to present to his readers a story specially written for
him by Mrs. FLORENCE BARCLAY (author of The Broken Halo and other imperishable works) and Mr. HalL CAINE (author of The Woman
Thou Gavest Me and kindred masterpieces) in collaboration. The mceting of the two famous writers took place at Bouverie Street, each
of them expressing considerable surprise at-hearing that the other wrote books also. After they had compared sales and methods of
advertisement, they arranged that ſheir new story for Mr. Punch should be written in alternate spasms. By an unfortunate error of
judgment, however, the illustrations were left to an artist who had never read a word of either author in his life, and who insisted that
it was much too late to begin now. Luckily the half-dozen drawings he sent in were such that they could easily be made to fit the text;
and in the result Mr. Punch feels that the story is at least as well illustrated as the average story in the magazines.]

LADY, having been engaged since May-day
(Pity that the Spring should ever stop!)
Now the year's no longer in its heyday,
Don't you think we'd better let it drop ?
Honestly, I thought it was a sure case;
Only, now the early Winter's come,
Lady, as in others', so in your case,
I confess to getting rather numb.
Do not deem me fickle, dear, and faithless;
Though the readjustment seems to be
Sudden-not to call it startling-natheless
You can hardly put it down to me.
In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly
Turns to love, as doubtless you 're aware;
In the Spring we wax exceeding sprightly,
Due, no doubt, to something in the air.
Then, as was both natural and proper,
We two met and, scorning all delay,
Vowed to wed, and neither cared a copper
For the pregnant fact that it was May.
Love appears, for some unfathomed reason,
Like a flow'r that ripens with the sun;
And, like everything that has its season,
Withers when its little course is run.
Summer camo and, warming with the weather,
Rarely was an ardour such as mine;
You 'll recall that, take it altogether,
For an English summer it was fine.
That's what I conceive to be the matter;
And I write, believe me, with regret;
For I own, with no desire to flatter,
That you're quite the nicest girl I've met.
Summer turned to Autumn, and September
Opened to the world her golden feast;
Quite a record month, as you 'll remember,
And my love, if anything, increased.
Still, farewell, or (put it less severely)
Au revoir; I hope you 'll keep the ring;
Snows are brief, and I, who loved you dearly
Once, again may do so—in the Spring.

and a more or less lifelike representa-
tion of a mammoth surprised while
bathing. It is little wonder that the
youth of the period, ever impetuous,
looked askance at this method of re-
vealing their passion, and preferred to
give proof of their sincerity and fervour
by waiting for the lady of their affec-
tions behind a rock and stunning her
with a club.
But the refined and sensitive nature
of Ug, the son of Zug, sbrank from this
brusque form of wooing. He was shy
with women. To him there was some-
thing a little coarse, almost ungentle-
manly, in the orthodox form of proposal;
and he had made up his mind that, if
ever he should happen to fall in love,
he would propose by ideograph.
It was shortly after he had come to
this decision that, at a boy-and-girl
dance given by a popular local hostess,
he met the divinest creature he had
ever seen. Her name was Wug, the
daughter of Glug; and from the moment
of their introduction le realised that
she was the one girl in the world for
him. It only remained to compose the
ideograph.
Having steadied himself as far as
possible by carving a few poems, as
described above, he addressed himself
to the really important task of the
proposal.
It was extraordinarily difficult, for
Ug had not had a very good education.
All he knew he had picked up in the
give and take of tribal life. For this
reason he felt it would be better to
keep the thing short. But it was hard
to condense all he felt into a brief note.
For a long time he thought in vain,

RECORD RISKS.
(A Sequel to “ Narrow Escapes.")
The report that M. PADEREWSKI
has been hunted by Nihilists out of
Denver has suggested to the Editor of
The Musical Mirror the happy thought
of circularising a number of prominent
musicians with a view to ascertaining
the most dangerous experiences they
have ever undergone.
Sir FREDERICK BRIDGE writes to say
that the worst quarter of a minute he
ever spent was while tarpon fishing off
the coast of Florida, when a gigantic
tarpon, weighing some 400 lbs., leaped
into the boat with its mouth wide
open. With great presence of mind
the famous organist thrust into the
monster's gaping jaws a full score of
STRAUSS's Elektra, which he was study-
ing between the casts, and the tarpon
at once leaped out of the boat and was
never seen or heard of again.
Madame Melba's most perilous ex-
perience was on a tour in the Far East,
when the liner in which she was
travelling was caught by a tidal wave
and hurled with enormous velocity
towards the rocky coast of Sumatra.
Noticing that a large whale was following
the vessel, and remembering the peculiar
susceptibility of these giant mammals
to musical sounds, Madame MELBA
sang the scena, Ocean, thou mighty
monster,” with such persuasive force
that the whale allowed itself to be
made fast with a hawser and then
towed the liner back safely into the
open sea.
Mr. Bamborough (formerly M. Bam-
berger) recounted the episode, already
alluded to in these columns, when he

WINTER SPORTS.
(Some additional aspects of the fashionable topic that
seem to have escaped the writers of similar articles in our
contemporaries.
(I.)--BUYING THE HOTEL.
For this game several players are required, who form
themselves into one or more parties according to numbers.
A player, preferably a woman, is selected as leader, and
should possess nerve, coolness, and an authoritative voice.
The object of the game is to secure (1) The best rooms;
(2) Tables with a view; (3) The controlling interest in all
projects of entertainment. It is an important advantage
for the learer to have stayed in the hotel at least once
previously. If she is able to announce on arrival, “ Here
we are as usual!" and to greet the proprietor and staff
by name, this often gives an initial blow exceedingly hard
to parry. English visitors have been proving very adept at
the sport this season, with Americans a good second. "The
German game, on the contrary, is slower and less subtle.
(II.)—SPOTTING THE Parson.
An amusing game that has been very popular at many
Swiss resorts lately, and one that calls for the qualifications
of a quick brain and a keen eye. The universal adoption
of sweaters and woollen caps makes the task of the
players one of considerable difficulty. Envelope-reading
should be forbidden by the rules, and some codes even
debár the offering of a Church Times to a suspected stranger.
The Athenteum and Spectator may, however, be freely em-
ployed as bait. A simpler version of the same sport
called “How Many SCHOOLMASTERS ? " is often indulged
in between December 20th and January 15th, after which
latter date it loses its point.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Neptune, be thy waters calm, not choppy,
As they speed them on their homeward way,
GEORGE and HENRY and, bowed down with " copy,
Our unique arch-eulogist, Tay Pay.
IN THE GARDEN OF ALLAH,
Weary of the struggle and the squalors
Which beset the politician's life-
Work that for a modicum of dollars
Brings a whole infinity of strife---
Three of England's most illustrious cronies
Started on a winter holiday,
With no thought of MURRAY or Marconis--
GEORGE and Henny and the great Tay Pay.
Never since Æneas and his raiders
Stayed with Dido in the days of yoro
Did such irresistible invaders
Land upon the Carthaginian shore.
GEORGE, of course, the largest crowds attended,
But I'm told the kind Algerians say
That ÆNEAS wasn't half so splendid
Or so pious as the good Tay Pay.
66
Ņoble sheikhs and black and bearded Bashias
Bowed, whene'er they met them, to the ground;
Festas and fantasias and tamashas
Followed in a never-ending round.
GEORGE no more on his detractors brooded ;
HENRY simply sang the livelong day:
While unmixed benevolence exuded
From the loving heart of kind Tay Pay.
Side by side they read the works of HICHENS;
Hand in hand they sampled the bazaars ;
Ate the sweetmeats cooked in native kitchens;
Flew about in sumptuous motor-cars;
Golfed where once great HANNIBAL was scheming;
Joked where luckless Dido once held sway;
For the finest jokes were always streaming
From the lips of comical Tay Pay.
THE MARRIED MAN'S ADVANTAGE.
PERSONALLY I think too much respect is paid to age.
There is nothing clever in being old---nothing at all. On
the other hand, youth has a charm of its own. Besides,
twenty-two is not young; you wouldn't think me so if you
really knew me. The doubt arises, I suppose, from a certain
innate light-heartedness. It is really rather pathetic.
Daphne chooses to see humour in the situation, which is
very absurd of her, and, as I point out, merely reflects on
herself. Surely she doesn't wish to admit that it is foolish
to love her.
And that, to make a clean breast of it, is exactly what
I do, and do madly.
I follow her about, reverently watching her every move-
ment, hanging on her every word-no light task. And
my reward ?
A scant unceremonious “Hallo!" when we
meet; a scanter " Night" or " Morning,” according to the
circumstances, when we part. A brave smile from me and
she is gone, an unwitting spectator of a real tragedy.
Up to a few days ago I was content to bear with my
lot, but last week I rebelled. It was at a dance, after
supper. Daphne had certainly shown a sort of affection for
me, motherly rather than otherwise, I think; nevertheless an
affection. But then, and not for the first time, I had seen
her flirting with another.
I decided to lose my temper. I went into the smoke-room
and deliberated very close to the fire. In five minutes I left
the room heated.
I found Daphne at once.
“Our dance," I said. “ We will sit out."
My manner must have been rather terrifying. At any
rate we sat out.
Daphne," I began, “I am in a mood that brooks no
trifling. For weeks I have loved you. You spurn me.".
“Oh, Billy, do be sensible," Daphne murmured.
I moderated my tone. “Well, look here," I said, " why
are you so cold to me and yet flirt with my cousin ? I saw
you putting his tie straight and patting his arm just now;
and you won't let me even hold your hand. It's pretty
hard, Daphne."
She laughed. “My dear Billy-_-"
“Many thanks for yours of yesterday. I am having a very
good time and it is really kind of me to write."
· Ii you won't be sensible-
I am. It's just because I'm so serious that I jest. All
the wittiest men are broken-hearted. Go on.”
dear Billy, you mustn't be foolish.
fond of you, but you 're so ridiculously young."
“You haven't a revolver about you ?” I enquired.
Daphne sighed. “Billy, you 're quite hopeless. Do let
me try to explain. You see, I can't-well-flirt with you,
because I don't really flirt, of course, and besides your
cousin's different--he's married."
I got up quickly. “Good-bye,” I said. “You must excuse
my leaving you."
Daphne looked surprised. “Where are you going?" sho
enquired.
“To get married.” I walked away with my head in
the air.

Other days they spent in caracoling,
Mounted each upon a mettled barb,
Or along the streets serenely strolling
Clad in semi-oriental garb;
HENRY with a cummerbund suburban;
GEORGE disguised to look like Enver Bey;
While a kilt surmounted by a turban
Veiled the massive contours of Tay Par.

Daily they conversed with EL SENOUSSI

And a dervish taught ten Arab tangos

Whither will they wander next, I wonder?
Not, I hope and pray, within the reach
Of the tribes who live on loot and plunder,
Fanatics who practise what they preach.
Fancy if these horrible disturbers,
Swooping on our countrymen astray,
Touaregs and Bedouins and Berbers,
Carried off the succulent Tay Pay!

THE HOUSE OF PUNCH.
[Ho “ married a princess of the House of Punch.”—Excerp? from
an account of the life of a former King of Kashmir.)
Hail, Master, and accept the news I bring.
I come to make a solemn mystery clear,
One that affects you deeply; for I sing
Of a most ancient king
Nine hundred years ago in fair Kashmir,
Who yearned towards a bride, and-hear, oh hear,
Lord of the reboant nose and classic hunch-
“Married a princess of the House of Punch.”
Yes, you are royal, as one might have seen.
The loftiness of your despotic sway,
Your strange aloofness and unearthly mien
(Yet regal) might have been
A full assurance of monarchic clay.
Had but the fates run kindly, at this day
Yourself should be a king of orient fame,
Chief of the princely house that bears your name.
Methinks I see you at it. I can see
A shamiana* loftily upreared
Beneath a banyan (or banana) tree,
Whichever it may be,
Where, with bright turban and vermilion beard
(A not unfrequent sight, and very weird),
You sit at peace; a small boy, doubly bowed,
Acts as your footstool and, though stiff, is proud.
Fragrant with Champak scents the warm wind sighs
Heavily, faintly, languorously fanned
By drowsy peacock-plumes--to keep the flies
From your full nose and eyes-
Waved from behind you, where on either hand
Two silent slaves of Nubian polish stand,
Whose patent-leather visages reflect
The convex day, with mirror-like effect.
Robed in a garment of the choicest spoil
Of Persian looms, you sit apart to deal
Grace to the suppliant and reward for toil,
T'abase the proud, and boil
The malefactor, till upon you steal
Mild qualms suggestive of the mid-day meal;
And, then, what plump, what luscious fruits are those?
What goblets of what vintage? Goodness knows.
Gladly would I pursue this glowing dream,
To sing of deeds of chivalry and sport,
Of cushioned dalliance in the soft hareem
(A really splendid theme),
The pundits and tame po. ts at your court,
And all such pride, but I must keep it short.
Once let me off upon a thing so bright,
And I should hardly stop without a fight.
But now you stand plain Mister; and, no doubt,
Would have for choice this visioned pomp untold.
Yet, Sire, I beg you, cast such musings out;
Put not yourself about
For a vain dream. If I may make so bold,
Your present lot should keep you well consoled.
You still are great, and have, when all is done,
A fine old Eastern smack, majestic One.
The vassals of your fathers were but few
Compared with yours, who move the whole world
wide;
You still can splash an oriental hue,
Red, yellow, green or blue,

GIVEN AWAY.
A CORRESPONDENT of The Times writes :— " The Niva,
the Russian Family Herald, promises to annual subscribers,
in addition to a copy of the paper every week-
The complete works of Korolenko in twenty-five
volumcs.
The complete works of Edmond Rostand.
The complete works of Maikof.
A literary supplement every month.
A fashion book.
A book of patterns of fancy-work designs.
A tear-off calendar for 1914,"
and adds, “Where does English or American journalistic
enterprise stand beside this?"
We understand that our more enterprising contem-
poraries have no intention of allowing this question to
remain unanswered, and the wildest rumours are atloat as
to the nature of the gifts which will be offered next year to
annual subscribers by various British journals.
With a view to test the accuracy of these rumours our
Special Representative called yesterday upon the Editors
of several leading publications, and, although much secrecy
is still maintained, he has succeeded in collecting some
valuable information, For instance, the report that The
Nineteenth Century and After would include among its gifts
the dramatic works of the MELVILLE Bros., How to Dance the
Tango, and Succter than Honey, a novel with a strong love
interest, lacks confirmation; nor are we in a position to
assert definitely that The Spectator will present a beautiful
coloured supplement, entitled “Susie's Pet Pup," and a hand-
some mug bearing the inscription : "A Present from Loo,"
though we believe that such may be the case.
On the other hand, The Times' reply to an inquiry as to
whether they would present to each reader half a ton of
supplements was that they had done so for some years
past; and The Daily Mirror did not deny that they were
considering the proposal to present a framed copy of the
portrait of John Tiffinch which appeared in their issue of
February 29, 1913. (Tiffinch, our readers will remember,
was brother-in-law to the man who discovered the great
emerald robbery.)
The British Medical Journal's list will include the works
of GEORGE BERNARD Shaw and the Life of Mrs. EDDY;
but the report that The Tailor and Cutter would present
Wild Tribes of Central Africa is emphatically denied.
Finally, The Boxing World had not thought of offering
any free gifts, but on learning that BOSWELL had written
a Life of JOHNSON seemed inclined to reconsider their
decision.

The country of Kakekikoku, as its

THE POST OFFICE AGAIN.
DEAR UNCLE, - Its your birthday
to-day. I sent you some nice pairs
of bankerchifs because its your birth-
day. They for your nose. Its funny our
birthdays being so close. And now no
more from your loving peice
NANCY.
My dear Naxcy,- Thank you very
much indeed for the nice pocket-
handkerchiefs. I am very pleased with
them. Nobody has ever troubled to
give me handkerchiefs before with
pretty flowers worked in the corners.
I have been wearing them to-day, or
rather one of them. They are so nice
that I really meant to have kept them
specially for parties and things like
that, but, as I was obliged to leave
home in a great hurry this morning,
and someone had hidden my everyday
handkerchiefs, I took one of yours.
Such a funny thing has happened.
I sent you for your birthday a pretty
card with birds on it, and somehow or
other it got taken in quite a different
direction, and was returned to me this
morning by-whom do you think?
Auntie Maud, all the way away in
Ireland. But we mustn't blame the
Postmaster - General without being
absolutely sure of ourselves. It is
very difficult in mysterious cases like
this to be absolutely sure. Didn't you
get my parcel? I sent it off at the
same time as I sent the card, and I
haven't had the parcel back. I wonder
where it is. It looks as though things
were going on that you and I know
nothing about. I shall be very angry
with him if he has forgotten to give
you your parcel.

THE TRAGEDY OF MIDDLE ACE.
WHEN I was a mid-Victorian put
With a delicate taste in ties,
A highly elegant figure I cut,
At least in my own fond eyes,
And used to regard unwaxed moustaches
As one of the worst of social laches.
But now I find in my youngest son
The sternest of autocrats.
He tells me the things that must be
done
And orders my collars and spats;
Prescribes mild exercise on the links
And advises me on the choice of drinks.
I've faithfully striven to imitate
My Mentor in dress and diction,
And loyally laboured to cultivate
A taste for the latest fiction;
Though I still read DICKENS upon the
sly,
And even Scott, when nobody's by.
It's true I've managed to draw the line
At going to tango teas,
,
For, after all, I am fifty-nine
And a trifle stiff in the knees;
But I've had to give up billiards for
“slosh,"
And pay laborious homage to "squash.”
Long since my whiskers I had to shave
To please this young barbarian,
But still for a while I stealthily clave
To the use of Pommade Hungarian ;
But now my tyrant has made me snip
The glory and pride of my upper lip.
"My dear old man," he recently said,
"If you go on waxing the ends,
You’re bound to be cut, direct and dead,
By all of my nuttiest friends.
For it's only done, so The Mail dis-
covers,
By Labour leaders and taxi-shovers."
So the deed was done, but whenever I
gaze
On my face in the glass I moan
As I think of the mid-Victorian days
When my upper lip was my own.

The ghost of a tooth-brush is all that's

I sing the sofa! It had stood for years,
An invitation to benign repose,
A foe to all the fretſul brood of fears,
Bidding the weary eye-lid sink and close.
Massive and deep and broad it was and bland-
In short the noblest sofa in the land.
You, too, my friend, my solid friend, I sing,
Whom on an afternoon I did behold
Eying—'twas after lunch—the cushioned thing,
And murmuring gently, “Here are realms of gold,
And I shall visit them," you said, “and be
The sofa's burden till it's time for tea."
“Let those who will go forth,” you said, “and dare,
Beyond the cluster of the little shops,
To strain their limbs and take the eager air,
Seeking the heights of Hedsor and its copse.
I shall abide and watch the far-off gleams
Of fairy beacons from the world of dreams."
Then forth we fared, and you, no doubt, lay down,
victim to the sofa's charms,
Forgetting hopes of fame and past renown,
Lapped in those padded and alluring arms.
"How well," you said, and veiled your heavy eyes,
“It slopes to suit me! This is Paradise.”
So we adventured to the topmost hill,
And, when the sunset shot the sky with red,
Homeward returned and found you taking still
Deep draughts of peace with pillows 'neath your

Another said, “ Let's bring and beat the gong."

Too true! Too true! Beneath you on the floor
Lay blent in ruin all the obscure things
That were the sofa's strength, a scattered store
Of tacks and battens and protruded springs.
Through the rent ticking they had all been spilt,
Mute proofs and mournful of your weight and guilt.
And you? You slept as sweetly as a child,
And when you woke you recked not of your shame,
But babbled greetings, stretched yourself and smiled

Which, flawless erst, was now one mighty flaw

From the Editor of “ The Globe Fiction

May 5th.
DEAR MR. ASTON,— We are extremely
sorry that we cannot see our way to
using Red Shadows. The idea is an
excellent one, if a trifle improbable.
But you must be aware that West
Africa has been worse handled by
fiction-writers than any other locality,
and we are afraid we dare not risk
publishing a story in which the writer
has drawn on his imagination for local
colour, however vivid that imagination
may be. The West African expert at
our office assures us that Red Shadows
contains some inaccuracies which would
be bound to spring to the eye of any
reader who had been near the West
Coast. We cannot imperil the reputa-
tion of a magazine so widely circulated
as ours, and we feel that in returning
the MS. we are in come degree safe-
guarding your own. Thanking you for
the many excellent stories you have let
us have, Yours very truly,

Mr. WALTER MELVILLE in the com-
position of his plays as revealed in the

suggested an appeal to other leading

duced. Personally he found that by

of Revues. He had calculated that the
amount of brain force he had spent on
his last masterpiece was fully as large
as that expended by GIBBON on his
monumental History of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire. In
evidence of the strain he added the
following interesting statistics. He
had worn out thirteen of the costliest
gold-nibbed fountain pens; seven ex-

they had to undergo a rest-cure; and
finally he himself had consumed no
fewer than nineteen seven-and-sixpenny

THE LEAN-TO SHED.
(Communicated by an eight-year-old.)
I’ve a palace set in a garden fair,
And, oh, but the flowers are rich and rare,
Always growing
And always blowing
Winter or summer-it doesn't matter-
For there's never a wind that dares to scatter
The wonderful petals that scent the air
About the walls of my palace there.
And the palace itself is very old,
And it's built of ivory splashed with gold.
It has silver ceilings and jasper floors
And stairs of marble and crystal doors;
And whenever I go there, early or late,
The two tame dragons who guard the gate
And refuse to open the frowning portals
To sisters, brothers and other mortals,
Get up with a grin
And let me in,
And I tickle their ears and pull their tails
And pat their heads and polish their scales;
And they never attempt to flame or fly,
Being quelled by me and my human eye.
Then I pour them drink out of golden flagons,
Drink for my two tame trusty dragons.
But John,
Who's a terrible fellow for chattering on,
John declares
They are Teddy-bears ;
And the palace itself, he bas often said,
Is only the gardener's lean-to shed.
In the vaulted hall where we have the dances
There are suits of armour and swords and lances,
Plenty of steel-wrought who's-afraiders,
All of them used by real crusaders;
Corslets, helmets and shields and things
Fit to be worn by warrior-kings,
Glittering rows of them-
Think of the blows of them,
Lopping,
Chopping,
Smashing
And slashing
The Paynim armies at Ascalon. .
But, bother the boy, here comes our John
Munching a piece of currant cake,
Who says the lance is a broken rake,
And the sword with its keen Toledo blado
Is a hoe, and the dinted shield a spade,
Bent and useless and rusty-red,
In the gardener's silly old lean-to shed.
And sometimes, too, when the night comes soon
With a great magnificent tea-time moon,
Through the nursery-window I peep and see
My palace lit for a revelry;
And I think I shall try to go there instead
Of going to sleep in my dull small bed.
But who are these
In the shade of the trees
That creep so slow
In a stealthy row?
They are Indian braves, a terrible band,
Each with a tomahawk in his hand,
And each has a knife withoui a sheath
Fiercely stuck in his gleaming teeth.

there anything," he was asked, " that you would like?”
He was plucky and prepared for the worst.
Yes,” he said, “ I'd like to know what I've spent since
I was twenty. Could that be arranged ?"
Easily,” they said.
"Good," he replied. “ Then tell me what I've spent on
my bally old stomach-on food."
“On food," they replied. “We find that you have spent
on yourself an average of a pound a day for food. For five
years that is, roughly, £1825.”
Roughly? " said the Nut.
Yes. Counting one leap year, it would be £1826. But
then you have entertained with some freedom, bringing the
total to £3075."
“ Yes," said the Nut. “And what about drinks ?”
“We find," was the reply, “ that on drinks your average
has been eighteen shillings a day, or £1643 8s. Od. in all.”
“Good heavens!” said the Nut. “What a noble thirst!
And clothes?”
“ The item of clothes comes to £940,” they said.
"Only three figures !" said the Nut. “ How did I come
to save that odd £60, I wonder ? ”
“Not by any idea of economy,” they replied. “Merely a
want of time.'
“And let's see," said the Nut,“what else does one spend
money on? Oh, yes, taxis. How much for taxis ?”
“ Your taxis,” they said, “work out at seven shillings a
day, or £639 2s. Od."
And tips ? ” the Nut inquired.
* Tips,” they said, come to £456."
The Nut lay back exhausted and oxygen was administered.
He was very near the end.
One thing more,” he managed to ask. " What have I
paid in cloak-room fees for my hat and stick ?”
"Only £150," they said.
But it was enough: he fell back dead.

To-day it is not mine to sing
A lay of love, a song of Spring;
I tackle no uplifting thing
Of arms and men;
My muse is otherwise beguiled
To gentler themes and measures mild ;
I sing of nature's artless child,
The common hen.
Little she has of lyric stuff ;
Her bows, I grant, are merely bluff,
Her sternmost pile of windy fluff
Would leave one cool;
Yet never since the world was planned
Was aught more lofty and more grand

But, though the futile one will lay

She always gives the fact away

With loud acclaim
She does not make, in point of fact,
That all the novel truth may know;
The heart go out.
Whereby the unsleeping human foy
Derives a tip on where to go
But see her when some danger lies
To get the same.
O'er her young brood, and, with wild
eyes,
It does not make her senses reel, Straight at the sudden foe she flies,
This mystery, or dim her zeal,
Her full soul spurred
Till by degrees she seems to feel To battle with the gnashing beak-
Her broken lot;
A roaring tiger is more meek;
She roams aloof, she grows depressed; And somehow one is bound to speak
And then, her broody sorrow guessed,
Well of the bird.
Men lure her to a well-filled nest

And bid her squat.
And now behold her, warm and wide, From the “Found” column in The

Its rapture never seems to cloy ;

A mother's bliss.

THE GERMAN CROWN PRINCE has the
mumps. It seems that his Imperial
Father was not consulted in the matter
beforehand, and further domestic differ-
ences are anticipated.

King Sisovath of Cambodia, we
learn from Le Petit Journal, was so
pleased with a white elephant sent him
by the Governor-General of French
Indo-China that he has raised the
animal--a fine female-to the dignity
of a Princess. The news soon got
about, and considerable jealousy is felt
at our Zoo, where there is not so much
as even a baronet among the inmates.
.
General von PLETTENBURGH, com-
manding the Prussian Guards Corps,
has issued a decree against the wearing
of the so-called “tooth-brush ” mou-
stache, pointing out that such an
appendage is unsuitable for a Prussian
soldier and “not consonant with the
German national character.” The im-
plication is very unpleasant.

"It is generally reported,” says a
contemporary,
" that Sir EDWARD GREY
speaks no German, and French - very

M. VENIZELOS, the Greek
Prime Minister, declared that he had
the greatest difliculty in understanding
Sir Edward's French.” As a matter
of fact a little bird tells us that on this

papies for new picture-play stories has
led many writers of talent to turn their
attention to this fascinating branch of
literature. Unfortunately they often
fail not only to acquire a proper know-
ledge of the technique of the art, but
to take steps to ascertain what the
public really wants. With the object
of helping authors in both directions we
publish below a scenario which has
been described by an authority as "the
ideal film plot.")

Sir John Tenniel.

Almanack 1871.
It has been remarked that in bis delineation of real men
Tenniel was less happy tban in his delineation of animals
and of the men whom he evolved from his own fancy--
such as the heroes of the Alician mythology. He was
weak, or at any rate mannered, it used to be objected,
in his drawing of legs. There is some truth in the
criticism, but the point is small. In spite of any such weak-
ness Tenniel could, when moved, compel respect from the
readers of PUNCH; while in cartoons of pure ridicule, in which
also he excelled, his eccentricity was a gain, as for example
in the “Pas de Deux,” on page 10.
Against any humorous foibles as a draughtsman of
the human form can be set the power and accuracy which he
brought to his lions and tigers and other animals. No one,
not Landseer himself, has so translated into line, stone or
colour, the grandeur of the lion. Tenniel's lion was truly

minded patriot of profound devotion could draw.
February 28th, into his ninetieth year. In the leading article
After his retirement in 1901 Tenniel nursed the project of
on Modern English Caricature which was printed in The
Times on February 27th, apropos of this event, the aim and
methods of our great cartoonist were admirably characterised.
He was at his best, said the critic, “not in attacks upon men
or things, but in the summing up of some moving situation
by a picture which, if it were literature and not art, we
should call metaphorical. His masterpiece, perhaps, was the
cartoon called 'Dropping the Pilot' (see page 13], in which
he recorded the dismissal of Prince Bismarck. That cartoon
was not an attack upon any one, but simply a moving record
of the event. It expressed the sense of tears in mortal things
without further comment or criticism. There was no carica-
ture in it, and indeed Sir John is not by nature a caricaturist.
There is nothing either bitter or whimsical in his art; there-
fore he has never had any difficulty in keeping within those
bounds which his own talent, as well as the taste of the time,
dictated for him. He was right to work as he did, and we
can only admire the grave and kindly and just spirit which
was revealed in all his works.”
From another excellent article called forth by the same
event-in The Daily News—we take the following just
passage :—“Tenniel may claim, indeed, to have created the
cartoon as understood in England. When PUNCH took a
young artist of ideals, fresh from painting fresco on the
walls of the Houses of Parliament, and made of him its
chief pictorial satirist and commentator on great affairs, a
new influence was brought into play. If we consider all
that marks the best work of Tenniel, the splendid firmness
and purity of his line, the loſtiness of his conception, the
boldness and fidelity of his treatment, the wonderful
strength of it all, we take away an impression of dignity-
dignity such as showed itself in the erect and quiet person-
ality, in the avoidance of all publicity and display in his
simple, secluded life, in the refusal to grasp at money, in the
unbroken maintenance through fifty years of a standard of
effort that outlasted the power of the pencil. He could draw
President Carnot bounding in air like a ballet-dancer, and
the picture would be dignified. He could show the British
Lion in preposterous check trousers and white waistcoat,
"VÆ VICTIS!"
and there would be dignity in it.

STUDIES IN DISCIPLESHIP.
THE TIMES' THIRD LEADER.
The statement made in these columns
by a well-informed correspondent that
the incomparable Nijinsky is so delicate
that by his doctor's decree he is obliged
to abstain from all forms of exercise
save that involved in his beloved art,
gives us, in the vivid phrase of our
neighbours, "furiously to think." At
the first blush incredulity prevails, but
recourse to the annals of history,
ancient and modern alike, furnishes us
with abundant confirmation of this
strange anomaly. HANNIBAL was
martyr to indigestion, while his great
rival, SCIPIO AFRICANUS, suffered from
sea-sickness even when crossing the
Tiber. Wherever we look we are con-
fronted with the spectacle of genius
fraying its way to the appointed goal
in spite of physical drawbacks which
would have paralysed meritorious
mediocrity. WOLFE was a poitrinaire,
and NELSON would never have passed
the medical examination to which the
naval cadets of to-day are subjected.
But the case of NIJINSKY is more tragic
because abstinence from skating and
riding, of which he was passionately
fond, entails greater anguish on so sen-
sitively organised a temperament than
it would on a mere man of action, and
the suffering of a great artist may lead
to international complications which
it is terrible to complicate. Russian
dancing is as necessary to the well-
being of our social system as standard
bread; yet when we think of the
sacrifices which its hierophants undergo
in order to minister to our pleasure
the sturdiest Hedonist cannot escape
misgivings. Still, we may find conso-
lation in the thought that sacrifice is

SMILES AND LAUGHTER.
On days of gloom and sadness,
When nothing brings relief,
When men are moved to madness
And women groan with grief;
Though growing daily dafter,

Have cheered myself with laughter,
But laughter is forbid.
If I should treat of CARSON,
His guns and rataplan,

THE CINEMA HABIT.
The writer of “ The Ideal Film Plot,"
which appeared in a recent issue of
Punch, has quoted an “authority"
(anonymous) for the approval of his
scenario. It is quite evident that this
authority” (so-styled) must belong
to the plebeian ranks of the film-world.
It cannot reside in our suburb.
Our cinema theatre is, I venture to

to drama and as to morality. It is not
a mere lantern-hall, close and stuffy,

(half-price to children, and tea provided
free at matinée performances), but a

to an exclusive class of patrons at six-
pence and a shilling, with neat attend-
ants in dove-grey who atomise scent
about the aisles, two palıns, one at each
side of the proscenium (real palms), and,
in addition to a piano, a mustel organ

He cannot
be there still, for lie was elderly then:
a military-looking man with a very
upright, almost corsetted, form, a red
dish face and a gingery moustache that
in its prime might have graced a major.
His eye, however, was not martial, but
blue and mild, watery and wandering,
its quest being, I fancy, a convivial
acquaintance with enough money and
generosity for two instalıents of re-
freshment. His hair, which was scanty,
was carefully brushed and parted at the
back even to his collar, and upon it
was perched at a slight angle a tall hat
ironed beyond endurance. His erect
body was encased in a tightly-buttoned
frock-coat so shiny that it glistened,
and as for his boots, no really soft-
hearted' observer could bear to look
twice at them, so inadequate were they
to our city of rain.
Such was this jaunty thread-bare
scholar; but what was his special
branch of learning I never discovered,
nor did he make the discovery easy,
for, though he had a desk, it seldom had
books upon it, and he was rarely there:

Content with Nature's colour-scheme.

Which Fashion calls “electric blue,
And, when their owner's startled, show
A healthy blush of indigo.)
Her sense of artistry appears
In what she does about her ears;
With colours of the naval sort
She marks the starboard from the port.

An interesting meeting was held at
the. Memorial Hall last Saturday in
order to discuss schemes of brightening
the nomenclature of British musicians.
Sir FREDERIC COWEN, who presided,
said that whereas in the last century it
was the common practice of British
singers to Italianize their surnames,
we bad now gone to the opposite ex-
treme of an aggressive insularity. He
thought that a compromise between
the two entremes was feasible, by which
a certain element of picturesqueness
might be introduced into our pro-
grammes without exposing us to the
charge of deliberately seeking to de-
nationalise ourselves.
Sir Henry Wood suggested that the
method of the anagram or palindrome
yielded very happy results. Nobody
could be charged with running away
from his name if he merely turned it
upside down or inside out. For in-
stance, Miss MURIEL FOSTER would be-
come Miss Leirum Retsof, which had a
pleasantly Slavonic sound, while Mr.

Miss CARRIE TUBB protested vigor-
ously against the proposal, on the
ground that, if it were adopted, her
name would sound just like Butt,
which was already that of a contralto
singer. (Sensation.)
Madame Clara Burt supported the

sound just like Tubb, which was that of

Once in so many calendar spaces
And the "nuts" are buying their shirts of cotton,
Punch, appearing on All Fools' Day,
And, cast into storage cold, forgotten,
Tills with giggles the hours and graces,
From delicate necks they were wont to cover,
Causes the hares of March to stay;
'Possum by 'possum, the stoles como in.

Remember the dreams of Wonderland,
And soon is an ending of football rushes,
The hold that tackles a travelling heel ;
And the chessboard world and the White King's facos,
And the front of the town with new fire tluskes,
The hamless commons and all the hay.

Come with loud bells and belabouring of bladder,
And the season comes with its gauds and gold

Engined with petrol and wafted by wings:

IN SEARCH OF PETER.
Martell is one of those men that you
might live next door to for half-a-cen-
tury and never know any better. It is
entirely owing to his wife and her love
for Peter that Martell and I have dis-
covered each other to be quite com-
panionable fellows with many tastes
in common, and I am smoking one of
his cigars at the present moment.
Peter is the most precious and the
most coveted of my possessions. He
is coveted, or was, chiefly by Mrs. Mar-
tell, who fell in love with his name and
his deep romantic eyes. Apart from
these I can see nothing remarkable in
bim. He is certainly the most irre-
sponsible hound that ever sat down in
front of a motor-car to attend to his
personal cleanliness, but still I should
not like to part with him. · We must
have a Peter," was the text of Mrs.
Martell's domestic monologues, and of

that is, after binting delicately to me
that she would like best of all to have
the Peter-she took to sallying forth,
armed with the name, into the purlieus
of dog-fanciers to find a criminal that
would fit the punishment.

brought in asking me to step round

GRUB STREET GOSSIP.
(By our Special Parasitic Penman.)
How I Got There and Back is the title
of a new story of adventurous explora-
tion which Messrs. Jones, Younger
announce for immediate publication.
The author, Mr. J. Minch Howson,
whose text has been revised by the
publishers, has had some astonishing
experiences as a bonzo-hunter in the
Aruwhimi forest. On one occasion he
was rescued by a mad elephant from
the jaws of an okapi, into which he
had inadvertently fallen while flying
from a gorilla. During his residence
among the pygmies Mr. Howson became
such an adept with the long blow-pipe
that they offered him the headship of
the tribe; but, as this involved the
adoption of anthropophagous habits,
he was reluctantly obliged to decline
the honour.
Mr. Bamborough, the famous vio-
linist, who recently changed his name
by deed poll from Bamberger, has
compiled a further volume of reminis-
cences based on his experiences as a
travelling virtuoso in all four hemi-
spheres. Some of these have already
been made public in the Press, but in a
condensed form. He now tells us for
the first time in full detail his astound-
ing adventures in New Guinea, where
he was captured and partially eaten by
cannibals, and his awful ordeal in the
Never-Never Land, when he was at-
tacked simultaneously by an emu and
a wallaby, and conquered them both
by the strains of his violin. The
volume, which will be published by
the House of Pougher and Kleimer,
is profusely illustrated with portraits
of Mr. Bamborough at various stages
of his career, before and after the
execution of the deed poll; of Mrs.
Bamborough and their three gifted
children, Wotan, Salome and Isolde

I see the Unionists grow oranger,
I mark the wigs upon the green,
The rooted hairs of Ulster bristle
And all men talk of Carson's grislle,
Then why should this absurd epistle,
Put down beside my little porringer,
Provoke not England's spleen ?
Did HAMPDEN positively jeopardise
His life, and did the axe
Extinguish Charles's hopes of boodle
And all the wrongs of bad days feudal
For this—that CARTER, the old noodle,
With t's all crossed and dot-bepeppered i's,
Should change my income-tax?
Thank heaven that one heart in Albion
Retains its oaken core;
Alone I can withstand my duty,
And so my answer to this beauty
Is simply " Rats!" and "Rooti-tooti!
My toll for this year must and shall be on
The sums declared before."
If not-if all things go by jobbery
And tape dyed red with sin,
Come, let him make a small collusion
And, when he writes his next effusion,
Grant me, we'll say, six years' exclusion
From re-assessments of his robbery,
And then I may come in.
But, if the fiend still stays importunate,
My blood is up. All lib.,
Till at the door the bailiff rattles
And rude men reave me of my chattels,
I shall prolong these wordy battles,
And may the just cause prove the fortunate;
Phoebus defend my nib!

So long as ink is damp,

of Mr. UPTON SINCLAIR, who recently
picketed the offices of the Standard Oil
Company in New York with a view to

ROCKEFELLER, Junr., Mr. Alf. Abel, the
famous Manx novelist, has adopted
similar measures to bring Mr. ANDREW
CARNEGIE to reason. The trouble is of
long standing and has grown out of
the movement inaugurated by Mr. Abel
to induce municipalities and local
authorities to refuse the gifts of Free
Libraries. Such benefactions, as Mr.
Abel bas most conclusively shown, while
nominally intended to educate the
masses, in reality have the result of
restricting the sale and circulation of

PETER, A PEKINESE PUPPY.
OUR Peter, who's famed as an eater of things,
Is a miniature dragon without any wings.
He can gallop or trot, he can amble or jog,
But he flies like a flash when he's after his prog ;
And the slaves who adore him, whatever his mood,
Say that nothing is fleeter
Than Peter the eater,
Tuan Peter pursuing his food.
He considers the garden his absolute own:
It's the place where a digger can bury a bone.
Then he tests his pin-teeth on a pansy or rose,
Spreading ruin and petals wherever be goes;
And his mistress declares, when he's nibbled for hours,
That nothing is sweeter
Than Peter the eater,
The resolute eater of flowers.
A BARGAIN IN FASHIONS.
WHATEVER may chance in the coming season
Regarding the fashions in women's wear,
I should like to remark that I see no reason
For treating the thing like a German scare;
Rather let us, the oppressed, restricted,
Assert ourselves as the women do;
It's their turn, dash it! to feel afflicted
By seeing us flaunting a craze or two.
It's more than time their monopoly ceases ;
Excepting the vote, I dare assert
We deny them none of their wild caprices,
Though I own we jibbed at the harem skirt;
Wo were wrong: we ought to bave let them wear it;
Free will in dress is a sacred right;
But we should be equally keen to declare it
With them who make it their chief delight.
We must come to terms with our fomale betters,
Seeing that summer will soon be nigh ;
If they would be rid of the skirt that fetters,
They might free us from the collar and tie;
It's neck or nothing! I ask you whether
We can't be conspicuous now and then;
I think these challenges go together :-
Trousers for women !-Low necks for men !
Having finished bis dinner he wheedles the cook,
Picks a coal from the scuttle or tackles a book,
Or devotes all his strength to a slipper or mat,
To the gnawing of this and the tearing of that;
Faute de mieux takes a dress; and his mistress asserts
That there's nothing to beat her
Like Peter the eater
Attached by his teeth to her skirts.
But at last he has supped, and the moment is come
When, his stretchable tum being tight as a drum,
He is meek and submissive, who once was so proud,
And he creeps to his basket and slumbers aloud.

Yours always gratefully, ISABEL MERRISOY.
Your rise from wolfish ancestors you owe
To some primæval impresario.
One sees the scene: how in the bygone days
Our forbears, fresh from bludgeoning their foes,
Would gather round to watch with glad amaze
A wolf who balanced rocks upon his nose.
"How quaint! How human!" thus their praises
flowed ;
"Look at his ikey way of wearing woad!"
And ever as the long years took their course
The trainer's skill came further to the front,
Until, through gentleness and moral force,
One wolf achieved the " trust-and-paid-ſor" stunt.
Topical, this produced unbounded ſun,
Coming when commerce had but just begun.
Then cleverer grew the woldings year by year,
And greater yearly grew the “spot-cashi " boon
Given to trainers summoned to appear
And charın a cave-man's idle afternoon,
Till came the whisper, “This is not the least
Bit like a wolf's cub; 'tis a nobler beast."
THE NOBLEST WORK OF MAN.
[In an article on Animal Training it has been stated that " wolves
are so stupid it is a waste of time trying to do anything with them,"
and that it is a wonderful tribute to the trainer's skill that he has
succeeded in evolving so faithiul a companion as the dog from this
unpromising material.'')
Full many a time when I've been overwrought,
And all has seemed beset by doubts and fogs,
I have gleaned ample comfort from the thought,
"Nature is kindly; she has given us dogs
To share our grieſs with sympathetic eyes
And force us out for healthy exercise."
Lut, Carlo, I was wrong to take that view;
Nature, though wonderful, does not (I find)
Deserve the credit of evolving you;
A trainer did it, just by being kind;
And thus the dog was born ; the gathered crowd
Cheered their approval of this wise remark;
A glad tail wagged its pride, and clear and loud
Rang out the music of the earliest bark,
While envious Nature sighed, “O parlous miss!
I was a silly not to think of this."

VANDALISM.
The new proposals with regard to
the water supply of the City of Glasgow
are causing, we are not surprised to
learn, the utmost fury and consterna-
tion throughout Scotland. Criticism
has concentrated especially upon two
points: the imminent risk of submerg-
ing ROBERT THE BRUCE's Stone and,
of course, the danger of tampering in
however slight a degree with the birth-
place of Rob Roy. The passive re-
sistance movement has already assumed
such proportions that one onterprising
publisher feels justified in announcing
a new cheap edition of the “ Waverley
Novels," illustrated from local photo-
graphs.
There is, of course, another side to
the question. As far as the stone goes
it is contended :-
(1) That no one knows why it should
have belonged to ROBERT THE BRUCE,
whero he got it or what lie did with it
when he had it.
(2). That the fact of its being under
water would not impair its value in
any way and at the same time would
give an historical flavour to every glass
of mitigated whisky thereafter drunk
in the City of Glasgow.
(3) That it could very easily be shifted
a bit up the hill if it is desired to keep
it dry, and a small permanent umbrella
erected over it.
With regard to Rob Roy's birthplace
the contention is that it is practically

hardly be considered convincing. For instance, he lays
stress on the fact that the gigantic gooseberry grown in his
parish and chronicled in his current issue was appreciably
greater in diameter than that described in the corresponding
issue of the rival publication. He also dwells on the
superior artistic quality of the programme of the Penny
Reading in his parish hall as compared with that of the
Little Titley Temperance Reed Band at their annual
concert. And, finally, with ill-timed levity, he disclaims
any intention of "bolstering up" his parish magazine by
crude appeals to democratic sentiment--an allusion to the
name of the Vicar of Little Titley which has been deeply
resented by the numerous admirers of that esteemed cleric.
The saddest feature about this painful controversy is the
personal estrangement which it has brought about between
the two vicars. Only six months ago the Rev. Mr. Bolster
presided at a meeting at which the friends and parishioners
of the Rev. Mr. Potts presented him with a testimonial and
a set of electro-plated fish-knives to commemorate the cele-
bration of his silver wedding. The testimonial, which was
composed by Mr. Bolster, was a document couched in terms
of the most affectionate admiration, and special reference
was made to Mr. Potts's editorial abilities and the extra-
ordinarily high literary standard of his parish magazine.
In acknowledging the presentation Mr. Potts said that
Mr. Bolster's energy and goodwill in carrying it out had
given him more satisfaction than anything else, and when
the two eminent divines were photographed in the act of
embracing on the platform there was hardly a dry eye in
the huge audience, numbering fully forty persons, who
attended the proceedings.
THE TATTIE-BOGLE.*
A FARMER once, to scare the birds away,
O'er his poor seeds set up, to leer and ogle,
A raffish moon-face, stuffed with straw and hay,
A Tattie-Bogle;
And rook and daw and stare their pinions spread
Incontinent; for, so they judged the matter,
Some scowling foe stood there, and off they fled
With startled chatter.
A week the portent stood in sun and rain
And fluttered rags of dread. A sparrow, nathless,
Whose nestlings cried, dashed down and snatched a
grain,
And got off scathless.
Emboldened, back she flew; to such good end
The others followed, craning and alarmful,
To find the monster, if perhaps no friend,
At least unharmful.
To-day the bogle wags, a thing of jest
And open scorn; the very pipits mock it;
A jenny-wren, I'm told, has built her nest
In one torn pocket!
Heart of my heart, and so prove aught of awe
That darkens on your path; the buckram rogue 'll
Stand, when you face him, but a ghost of straw-
A Tattie-Bogle!

IN THE NAME OF PEACE.
Sir, I read with intense satisfaction that at the Peace
Ball at the Albert Hall last week the lady representing
Britannia carried a palm branch in place of the customary
trident. This, I venture to think, is a step in the right
direction. For many years, from the pulpits and platforms
not only of our own land but of America, I have advocated
a substitution of peaceful objects for the weapons of blood-
shed with which so many of our allegorical figures are
encumbered. I still wait for some artist to depict the
patron saint of this fair land of ours, not attacking the
dragon with a cruel sword, but offering it in all brotherliness
a
an orange, let us say, or a bath bun.
But, Sir, one feature of this ball (putting aside for a
moment the many reprehensible characteristics of all such
entertainments) I must and do protest against. What do
I read in the daily press? When it was desired to clear
the floor, "a brigade of Guards, by subtle movements, drove
the masqueraders, who were to form the audience, behind
the barricades.” Now, were I a member of the House of
Commons—as some day I may be—I would make it my
business to stand up in my place and fearlessly demand of
the Minister for War an explanation as to how these men of
blood came to be admitted to a Peace festival. Was it with
his knowledge that they were present ? and, if so, was it
with his consent ? I should also desire to know whether the
cost of the expedition would fall upon the British tax-payer.
I am, Sir, Yours, etc.,
(Rev.) Amos BLICK.

And sallies forth to call upon a maid,
Knowing his converse and his coat are proper,

Or drop the marmalade.

And looked for light; my lips were like the tomb,
Sealed, though they say they heard my molars chatter
Up in the smoking-room.
Cold eyes regarded me. My front-stud fretted;
A stiff slow smirk belied my deep unrest;
My tea-cup trembled and my cake was wetted;
My beauteous tie worked round toward the West;
My brow-forgive me, but it really sweated;
I did not look my best.
To Zeus, that oft would make a mist and smother
Some swain beset, and screen him from the crowd,
I prayed for vapours; but his mind was other:
Yet was I answered, though the god was proud,
For, anyhow, I trod on Miss Pritt's mother
And left beneath a cloud.
It may be, though she deemed me dunder-headed,
She'll sometimes take them from her chamber-wall,
Or where they lie in lavender embedded,
And tell her family about them all —
About the gentleman she might have wedded,
Only he could not call.

"SIR BAT-EARS."
Sır Bat-ears was a dog of birth
And bred in Aberdeen,
But he favoured not his noble kin
And so his lot is mean,
And Sir Bat-ears sits by the alms-
houses
On the stones with
grass
between.
Under the ancient arch way
His pleasure is to wait
Between the two stone pineapples
That flank the weathered gate;
And old, old alms-persons go by,
All rusty, bent and black,
* Good day, good day, Sir Bat-ears!"
They say and stroke his back.
And old, old alms-persons go by,
Shaking and well-nigh dead,
“Good night, good night, Sir Bat-
ears!
They say and pat his head.
So courted and considered
He sits out hour by hour,
Benignant in the sunshine
And prudent in the shower.
(Nay, stoutly can he stand a storm
And stiftly breast the rain,
That rising when the cloud is gone
He leaves a circle of dry stone
Whereon to sit again.)
A dozen little door-steps
Under the arch are seen,
A dozen aged alms-persons
To keep them bright and clean;
Two wrinkled hands to sccur each step
With a square of yellow stone
But print-marks of Sir Bat-ears' paws
Bespeckle every one.
And little eats an alms-person,

TPILOGUE
BERNARD PARTRIDGE.
MORE MUNITIONS OF PEACE.
(An Episode in the Camp of the Nationalist Volunteers.)
Several further months had elapsed in the history of the scheme for the “better government of Ireland.”
The Home Rule Bill had been read for the third time in the Inferior Chamber, but, apart from this conciliatory action,
no effective attempt had been made to avert the horrors of Civil War.
Meanwhile two coups had been planned, of which the one failed and the other succeeded. And during the
arrangements for the first coup (for it got no further than the preparatory stage-and even this was denied) it was
revealed that British officers were not very greatly inclined to shoot down their fellow-countrymen for the sake of the
beaux joux of a political party. And for this the politicians of that party, selecting the worst name they could think
of, described these officers as politicians. And the cry of “The Army v. the People,” started by a Labour Member
(who wore a large hat), and supported by the First LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (who wore a small one), was raised very
high and then dropped, as likely to prove inexpedient.
But the other coup (which succeeded) was a very clever feat of gun-running on the part of the Ulster
Volunteers. And, the law having been broken, the Government, as its guardian, determined to take no punitive
measures—an attitude that was repellent both to Sir William Byles and to Mr. Neil PRIMROSE.
And now there grew up in each political party a body of rebellion. For on the Liberal side there were those,
notorious at other seasons for their advocacy of peace at whatever charges, who gave out that there were worse things
than Civil War, and one of the worse things was the stultification of their own projects, or, as they put it, of the Will
of the People; though they showed no strong anxiety to discover, by the usual tests, what the Will of the People
might actually be in the matter.
And on the Unionist side there were those who said that they would do nothing to provoke Civil War, but
that, since it took two sides to conduct a Civil or any other kind of War, and the British Army was apparently
not available, there was no fear of Civil War, and they (the Unionist Party) could well afford to stiffen themselves
about the lips.
And all this tended to embarrass the labours (if any) of those leaders who were still supposed to be holding
communion together for the furtherance of a compromise.
Now, among the Ulster Volunteers, though perfect sobriety was exhorted and maintained, it was excusably
felt that it would be a pity if so fine a force should have been raised and armed at such expense and sacrifice and

6%
then have no chance of showing what it could do. And this feeling evoked sympathy in the breasts of the Irish
of the South and West; and they said to them of Ulster, Rather than see your army wasted we will ourselves
raise one for you to shoot at.” And this they did, in part for sheer joy of the chance of a fight, and in part
for admiration of the sportsmanship of a people that had defied a British Government. And though some joined the
new Volunteers for love of Home Rule, and with the object of offering themselves as substitutes for the British
Army, yet the promoters were content to allege, vaguely and inoffensively, that their object was just the protection of
Irish liberty, whatever that might be taken to mean. And, being Irish, no exact logic was asked of them.
But at first Mr. REDMOND, as a supporter of the law, and scandalised by its breach in Ulster, declined to
approve this illegal development, which for the rest be regarded as negligible. But later, when it had grown too large
to be ignored, he generously consented to overlook its illegality and to place it under official patronage. But his offer
was received in a spirit of very regrettable independence. On reflection, however, this attitude was exchanged for one
of sullen submission.
Now a private army is a dangerous thing when you know what it is for; but it is a very dangerous thing when
you don't. And there were cynics--not too frivolous- who held that the best course for the Government would be to
withdraw from Ireland for the time being and leave Ulster and the Rest to come to an agreement of their own,
cither with or without a bloody prelude. And there were other critics-not much more frivolous—who replied
that, if we walked out of Ireland and left Ulster and the Rest to come to terms, they might get to understand one
another to such good purpose that we should never have the opportunity of walking in again.
And the Government's only consolation lay in the thought that the Rest of Ireland lacked the munitions of war
owing to the vigilant precautions taken to prevent the importation of arms into Ulster.
A thrill of emotion rippled over the tented plain. Into the camp of the Nationalist Volunteers had dashed a
motor-car which was taken to be the forerunner of a great consignment of smuggled arms, for it contained a bulky
wooden case with the label " Munitions of Peace" pasted upon its façade-a superscription that might well have been
designed to mislead the wariest of coastguards and patrols. . Its sole convoy was an old gentleman-evidently
selected for the part, for by his air of simple benevolence you would have judged him the last man in the world to
be suspected of nefarious practices.
A cry of bitter disappointment broke out on the discovery that the "munitions " consisted of nothing but books.
But the uproar died down as the old gentleman was seen to assume the attitude of an orator. His words were
at first received in courteous silence; then with sympathetic approval; finally with deafening applause.
“ Nationalist Volunteers !” he said: “I come from performing a similar mission of camaraderie among the hosts-
of Ulster. I am no partisan. I am like a certain philanthropist of whom I have heard who purveyed sherbet to the
rival camps of the Sultan of Morocco and the Pretender. I trust that my fate may not be his, for he was the sole
person killed in one of the noisiest battles ever fought in the environs of Fez.
“This tome, identical with the rest of my munitions of peace, embodies (for I made the contents myself, and so
ought to know) the highest wisdom mingled with the purest material for mirth. Its contemporaneous perusal in
both camps should encourage a common ideal of humour and so promote mutual respect and affection.
"I would go even further and express the hope that here may be found a spirit of genial tolerance which, if
assimilated by all parties, will infallibly lead to a solution of the Irish Question without the inconvenience of bloodshed.
Gentlemen, permit me!” And thereupon he presented to the admiring gaze of his audience Mr. Punch's
