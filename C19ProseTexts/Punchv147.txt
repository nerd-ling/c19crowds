PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ENCHANTED CASTLE.
THERE are warm days in London
when even a window-box fails to charm,
and one longs for the more open spaces
of the country. Besides, one wants to
see how the other flowers are getting
on. It is on these days that we
travel to our Castle of Stopes; as the
crow flies, fifteen miles away. Indeed,
that is the way we get to it, for it is a
castle in the air. And when we are
come to it Celia is always in a pink
sun-bonnet gathering roses lovingly,
and I, not very far off, am speaking
strongly to somebody or other about
something I want done. By-and-by
I shall go into the library and work . . .
with an occasional glance through the
open window at Celia.
To think that a month ago we were
quite happy with a few pink geraniums'
Sunday, a month ago, was hot.
“Let's take train somewhere,” said
Celia, “and have lunch under a hedge.”
“I know a lovely place for hedges,”
I said. - - * * *
“I know a lovely tin of potted
grouse,” said Celia, and she went off
to cut some sandwiches. By twelve
o'clock we were getting out of the
train. -
The first thing we came to was a golf
course, and Celia had to drag me past
it. Then we came to a wood, and I
had to drag her through it. Another
mile along a lane, and then we both
stopped together. . …--
“Oh 1” we said. -
It was a cottage, the cottage of a
dream. And by a cottage I mean, not
four plain rooms and a kitchen, but one
surprising room opening into another;
rooms all on different levels and of
different shapes, with delightful places
to bump your head on ; open fireplaces;
a large square hall, oak-beamed, where
your guests can hang about after break-
fast, while deciding whether to play
golf or sit in the garden. Yet all so
cunningly disposed that from outside
it looks only a cottage or, at most, tw
cottages persuaded into one. -
And, of course, we only saw it from
outside. The little drive, determined
to get there as soon as possible, pushed
its way straight through an old barn, and
arrived at the door simultaneously with
the flagged lavenderwalk for the humble
who came on foot. The rhododendrons
were ablaze beneath the south windows;
a little orchard was running wild on the
west; there was a hint at the back of
a clean-cut lawn. Also, you remember,
there was a golf course, less than two
miles away.
“Oh,” said Celia with a deep sigh,
“but we must live here.”
An Irish terrier ran out to inspect
us. I bent down and patted it. “With
a dog,” I added.
“Isn't it all lovely 2 I wonder who
it belongs to, and if—”
“If he'd like to give it to us.”
“Perhaps he would if he saw us and
admired us very much,” said Celia
hopefully.
“I don’t think Mr. Barlow is that
sort of man,” I said. “An excellent
fellow, but not one to take these sudden
fancies.” -
“Mr. Barlow 2 How do you know
his name?” . . * * * .
“I have these surprising intuitions,”
I said modestly. “The way the chim-
neys stand up * x -

“Right, Watson.
the house is Stopes.”
She repeated it to herself with a
frown.
“What a disappointing name,” she
said. “Just Stopes.” -
“Stopes,” I said. “Stopes, Stopes.
If you keep on saying it, a certain old-
“The dog's
And the name of
Stopes.” " . . --
“Stopes,” said Celia. “It is rather
jolly.” . . .
We said it ten more times each, and
Stopes—of course.
: “Well?” I asked. ‘. . . . .
“We must write to Mr. Barlow,”
said Celiadecisively. “Dear Mr. Barlow,
er—Dear. Mr. Barlow, we—’
Yes, it will be rather difficult. What
do we want to say exactly?” . . . .
“Dear Mr. Barlow, May we have
your house?’” - .
“Yes,” smiled Celia," but I'm afraid
we can hardly ask, for it. But we
might rent it when—when he doesn't
want it any more.” _* *** *
“‘Dear Mr. Barlow,’” I amended,
“‘have you any idea when you're
going to die?’ No, that wouldn't do
either. And there's another thing—we
don't know his initials, or even if he's
a 'Mr.' Perhaps he's a knight or a-
a duke. Think how offended Duke
Barlow would be if we put' Barlow,
Esq.' on the envelope.”
“We could telegraph. ‘Barlow. After
you with Stopes.’”
“Perhaps there's a young Barlow,
a Barlowette or two with expectations.
It may have been in the family for
years.”
“Then we- Oh, let's have lunch.”
She sat down and began to undo the
sandwiches. “Dear o' Stopes,” she
said with her mouth full.
We lunched outside Stopes. Surely
if Earl Barlow had seen us he would
have asked us in. But no doubt his
dining-room looked the other way;

pointed out to Celia, thus being plea-

“Ha, Barlow,” I said dramatically,

“Will you promise,” said Celia,

“No, no, some king in history.” º
“I believe you are thinking of AHAB,
but you aren't a bit like him, really.
Besides, we're not coveting Stopes. All
we want to know is, does Barlow ever
let it in the summer?” … . . .
“That's it,” said Celia eagerly.
“And, if so,” I went on, “will he

“Er—yes,” said Celia. “That's it."

So for a month we have lived in our

EGYPT IN VENICE.
“La Lågende DE Joseph.”
THOSE who know the kind of attrac-
|tions that the Russian ballet offers in so
many of its themes could have easily
| guessed, without previous enlighten-
ment, what episode in the life of Joseph
..] had been selected for illustration last
week at Drury Lane. But they could
never have guessed that Herr TiEssen,
author of a shilling guide to the inten-
tions of the composer, would attach a
transcendental significance to the con-
duct of Potiphar's Wife. “Through the
unknown divine,” he informs us,
“which is still new and mysterious to
her, an imperious desire awakens in
her to fathom, to possess this world"—
| the world, that is to say, which Joseph's
imagination creates in the course of an
exhibition dance. If this is so, I can
only say that her behaviour is strangely
misleading.
The scene opens at a party given by
Poliphar in Venice. Venice, of course,
Was not Potiphar's home address; and
I marvel a little at the change of venue
could have been got out of an Egyptian
setting. But then I remind myself
that the Russian ballet is nothing if not
bizarre. The long banqueting-table
recalls the canvases of VERoNESB, but
with discordant notes of the Orient and
elsewhere. Potiphar himself, seated
on a dāis, has the air of an Assyrian
bull. By his side Mme. Potiphar wears
breeches ending above the knee, with
white stockings and high clogs. . .
For the entertainment of the guests
there was a dance of nuptial unveiling
and a bout between half-a-dozen Turk-
ish boxers. But it was a decadent and
blazé company, and something more
piquant was needed for their titil-
lation. This was supplied in the shape
of an original dance by the fifteen-year-
old Joseph, whom my guide describes as
“graceful, wild and pungent.” He was
introduced in a recumbent posture, and
asleep, on a covered stretcher, and at
first I had the clever idea that he was
the customary corpse that appeared at
Egyptian feasts to remind the company
of their liability to die. But when he
woke up and began to dance I saw at
I now know all about the interpreta-
tion of Joseph's dance; but I defy any-
one to say at sight and without a show-
man's assistance what precisely he was
after. In the Third Figure (according
to my guide-book) “there is in his
leaps a feeling of heaviness, as if he
were bound to earth, and he stumbles
once or twice as one who has missed
his goal; ” but how was I to guess that
this signified that his “searching after
God” was still ineffectual? or that
when in the Fourth Figure he “leaps
with light feet” this meant that “Joseph
has found God"? I don't blame the boy
for not knowing the rule that forbids
one art to trespass on the domain of
another; but there is no excuse for
Herr STRAUss, who must have been
well aware that, for the conveyance of
any but the most obvious emotions,
mute dancing can never be a satisfac-
tory substitute for articulate poetry.
However, Poliphar's guests seemed
better instructed than I was, for they
threw off their apathy and took quite an
intelligent interest in Joseph's pas seul.
Indeed, one young man (the episode

have it in the guide-book)—one young
man, “sobbing, buries his head in his
hands, upsetting thereby a dish of fruit.”
As for Potiphar, it failed to stir the
sombre depths of his abysmal boredom,
but his wife, whose ennui had hitherto
been of the most profound, began to sit
up and take notice, and at the end of the
dance she sent for Joseph and supple-
mented his rather exiguous costume
with a gross necklace of jewels, letting
her handlinger awhile on his bare neck.
Already, it will be seen, she was intrigued
with the “unknown divine.” –
Joseph, on the contrary, re-
ceived her attentions without
empressement.
In the next scene—after a
rather woolly and unintelligi-
ble interlude—we see Joseph
retiring to his couch in an
alcove behind the place where
the banqueting - table had
been. You will judge how
urgent was the lady's keen-
ness to probe the mys-
teries of his divine nature
when I tell you that she
could not wait till the morn-
ing to pursue her enquiries,
but must needs visit him in
his chamber at dead of night,
and wearing the one garment
of the hour. At first, still
half dreaming, he mistakes
her for an angel (he had =
already seen one in his sleep), art.
but subsequently, growing | *
suspicious, he repels her with
a dignificq disdain. For I
must tell you that, whatever
the guide-book may allege
about the loftiness of her
designs, the music gave her
away. It reverted, in fact,
to the motive of those pass-
ages which had already ac-
companied and illustrated the
nuptial dance, the dance (as dawg?”
Herr TiEssen calls it) of
“burning Love-longing.”

becomes luminous under great pressure
of limelight; and most of the cast,
including a ballet of female dervishes,
are abashed to the ground.
Now appears, on the open-work
entresol at the back of the stage, an
archangel. The guide-book is in error
where it says that he glides downwards
on a shaft of light radiating from a
star. As a matter of fact he walks
down the main staircase to the ground
floor. Approaching Joseph he takes

a spiritual significance in what is mere
vulgar animalism.
I ought, by the way, to have said
that, in a spasm of chagrin, she chokes
herself with the pearl necklace which
lent the only touch of superfluity to
her night attire, and was carried out—
but not up the main staircase. Thus
ends this sordid tragedy that so well
illustrates that quality in Herr STRAuss
to which my guide refers when he
speaks of his realization of a “poignant
longing for divine cheerfulness.” O. S.

The smile of welcome that I
loved of old
No longer lights her eye.
One little week ago
I asked no surer guide than
Cupid's chart;
I said, “Your eyes reveal the
depths below,
And I can read your heart.”
She let her shy gaze fall,
And smiling asked, “Is then
my face a screed,
My brow an open love-letter,

Said I, “The world, I'll

At this juncture, Potiphar'-
and his minions break upon the scene.
His wife, after denouncing Joseph, is
distracted between passion of hatred
and passion of love, and there is some
play (reminding one of L’Après-midi
d'un Faune) with the purple cloak
which Joseph had discarded. Presently
she eludes her dilemma by fainting.
Meanwhile it has been the work of
a moment to order up a brazier, a pair
of pincers, a poker, a headsman and
an axe. The instruments of torture
waste no time in getting red-hot; and
we anticipate the worst. Joseph, how-
ever, who has ignored these prepara-
tions and maintained an attitude of

steps; and we are to understand that,
in the opinion of Herr STRAUss, the
boy's subsequent career, as recorded
in the Hebraic Scriptures, may be
treated as negligible.
I should like, in excuse of my own
flippancy, to assume the same detach-
ment, and to regard this ballet-theme
as having practically no relation what-
ever to Biblical history, but being just
one of many themes out of Oriental
lore, mostly secular, that lend them-

passion. My only serious protest - is

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SCANDALMONGRIAN ROMANCE.
(By Francis Scribble.)
[The following article, specially written
for us by the Author of " Ten Frail
Beauties of the Restoration," " Tales
Told by a Royal Washerwoman,"
elc., is another important contribution
to the literature of the Royal Dirty-
Linen Bag.)
A DAY or two ago a short notice in
the papers told of the death of Mrs.
Maria Tubbs at Cannes; but few, if any,
of those who read that brief announce-
ment will have recognised in it the
close of one of the most amazing
careers of the nineteenth century. Yet
little surprise read be expressed at this
general ignorance, for who would think
to find under that somewhat common-
place name the ravishingly beautiful
Maria Cotherstone, who, forty years
ago, was swept by Fato into the track
of the late King of Scandalmongria,
and well-nigh caused that singularly
unstable bark to founder? It is with
the kindly object of rescuing her
romance from oblivion that this brief
chronicle is written.
In 1873 the Scandalmongrian Minis-
ter in London was requested to find an
English lady to take charge of the two
children of his Royal master, and,
aftor searching enquiries, he was suc-
cessful, and Miss Maria Cotherstone
turned her back on England never more
to return. She was just twenty-two,
fresh and blooming, possessed of the
gayest of spirits, delightful manners
and the highest accomplishments.
Quietly she assumed control of the
Royal schoolroom, and by her charm
no less than by her firmness she
quickly won the respect and love of
her charges. Well had it been for her
memory if her influence had never

It is not only misfortune that makes
strange bedfellows. Both Earl BEAU-
champ and Sir Joseph BEECHAM appear
in the recent Honours List.
By-the-by, it is denied that Sir Joseph
BEECHAM was in any way responsible
for the Government's “Pills for Earth-
quakes,” by which it was hoped to
avert the Irish crisis.
A New York cable announces that
the Duke of MANCHESTER is interest-

that the company will be known as the
“Church and School Social Service Cor-

Five shots were fired last week at

it was thought that this was done to
stop the author of Craesus from writing
more plays, but, when it transpired
that the assailant was a man who
objected to the “Rothschild Cheap

round in favour of the Baron.
Messrs. SELFRIDGE AND Co. were last
week defrauded by a well-dressed man,

An American woman, according to

the Force was reluctant to interfere
with what might turn out to be the

fasten in front instead of at the back.
Husbands all over the world who have
on occasions been pressed into their
wives' service as maids, only to learn
that they were clumsy boobies, would

innovation, as there is some thought
of erecting a statue to him.

Some distinguished German pro-
fessors have been discussing the ques-
tion of the best place in which to keep
a baby in summer. It is characteristic,
however, of these unpractical persons
that not one of them suggests the
obvious ice-safe. * *
“One of the first things the rich
should learn,” says Dean INGE, “is
that money is not put to the best use
when it is merely spent on enjoyment.”
It is hoped that this pronouncement
may lead wealthy people to patronise
our concert-halls more than they do.

THE COLLECTORS.
My dinner partner was a self-made
man and not ashamed of it. -
“Do you take an interest in china,
ma'am ” he asked me.
I felt that if I said “Yes” I should
have to buy some. So I said “No,”
but he didn't wait to hear what I said.
“I think I may say,” he continued,
“that I have the finest collection of
old Dresden china in London.”
He went into the figures, explaining
the cost price and the difficulty of
storage.
* Oh,” said I, “if you find it a
nuisance, I've a parlour-maid I could
recommend to you; just the girl to
help you to get rid of it.”
At this point I think he had some
idea of having the finest collection of
parlourmaids in Middlesex, but he made
it small dogs instead. Was I interested
in these? No, but I supposed I'd have
to be if he insisted.
“I don't think I should be far
wrong,” he began, but I hustled him
through to the end of his sentence.
“Finest collection in—?” I asked.
“England,” he said.
He went over their points, and in an
expansive moment I marvelled. This
was imprudent, as it caused him to
search his mind for some further spec-
tacular triumph wherewith to amaze
and delight.
“That,” he said, looking up the table,
“is my wife.”
“Marvellous,” said I.
He took this in the best part, “You
refer to her diamonds?” he said.
“Did I ?” said I.
“The finest collection in Great
Britain,” he declared, and spread him-
self over the subject.
Later, in a mood of concession, he
inquired as to my specialities. I had
none, at least none that I could think
of. Determined to extract something
noteworthy, he questioned me on every
possibility. Was I not married ? That
was so, I agreed, but then so many
WOmen are.
“You have sons, ma'am 7” he per-
sisted, with that implacable optimism to
which, among other things, he no doubt
owed his success in the world.
I thought of Baby. “Ah yes, of
course,” I said. “The finest collection

Alan (to his mother, who is busy with a heavy house-cleaning). “PLEASE, MoTHER, READ ME A story.”
THE walkers.
THERE were eight pretty walkers who went up a hill;
They were Jessamine, Joseph and Japhet and Jill,
And Allie and Sally and Tumbledown Bill,
And Farnaby Fullerton Rigby. '
They were all in good training and all of them keen,
And their chief wore a coat and a waistcoat of green;
He was always a proud man and kept himself clean,
Did Farnaby Fullerton Rigby. .
They intended to lunch when they got to the top
On a sandwich apiece and a biscuit and chop.
The provisions were carefully bought in a shop
By Farnaby Fullerton Rigby.
They were jesters of merit—the sort who can poke
Funny tales in your ribs till you splutter and choke;
But the best of the lot at a jibe or a joke
Was Farnaby Fullerton Rigby.
It was ten of the clock when the walking began,
And they started with Tumbledown Bill in the van;
And the rear was brought up by that excellent man,
By Farnaby Fullerton Rigby.
They went off at a pace I am bound to deplore,
For they did twenty yards in a minute or moro
And a yard or two over, a capital score
They had all that pedestrians fairly can ask:
Smooth roads, sunny weather and beer in a cask,
And a friend who could teach them to stick to their task,
Viz.: Farnaby Fullerton Rigby.
Yet I somehow suppose that they hadn't the knack,
For in spite of it all they have never come back,
And I own that the future looks dismally black
For Farnaby Fullerton Rigby.
Now the walkers who seem to be stuck on the hill,
They are Jessamine, Joseph and Japhet and Jill,
And Allie and Sally and Tumbledown Bill,
And Farnaby Fullerton Rigby. R. C. L.
King Peter of Servia.

“The proclamation, however, as given in a later message, reads
thus:–To My Beloved People: As I shall be prevented by illness
from exercising my royal power for some time, I order, by Article
69 of the Constitution, that so long as my cure lasts the Crown
Prince Alexander shall govern in my name. On this occasion 1
recommend my dear fatherland to the care of the Almighty.

“On this occasion" is perhaps a little invidious.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtractFD FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, June 22.
—Great muster of forces on both sides.
Not wholly explained by second read-
ing of Budget Bill standing as first
Order. A section of Ministerialists,
purists in finance, took exception to
proposed procedure. HolT, spokesman
at mouth of new Cave, put down
amendment challenging CHANCELLOR
of ExchEQUER's proposals. Here was
chance for watchful Opposition. If
some thirty Ministerialists would go
with them into Lobby it would not
quite suffice to turn out Ministry; but it
would be better than a Snap Division,
with its personal inconvenience of
preliminary hiding in bath-rooms and
underground cellars.
CASSEL, adding to Parliamentary
reputation studiously attained, raised
subject on point of order. Underlying
suggestion was that Budget Bill should
be withdrawn and reintroduced under
amended form of procedure. SPEAKER,
whilst admitting irregularity, stopped
short of approving extreme course.
Pointed out that the matter might be
put right by moving fresh resolutions.
This disappointing. Worse to follow.
The INFANT SAMUEL, making fresh
appearance in new part of understudy
of CHANCELLOR of ExchEQUER, con-
ceded point of procedure made by
Radical Cave. Promised objection should
be fully met. Holt, amid ironical
cheers from Opposition, said in these
circumstances would not move amend-
ment. Incident reminded WALTER
Long of story of the Colonel and the
opossum up a tree.
"Don't shoot!” said the opossum ;
"I'll come down.”
ChanceLLOR of THE ExchEQUER had
come down. No need for Colonel Holt
to discharge his gun.
Thus threatened crisis blew over.
Members, cheered by promise of reduc-
tion by one half of proposed increase
in Income Tax, got away early to
attend various functions in honour of
KING's birthday.
Business done.—Second reading of
Budget Bill moved.

magnet of attraction of surpassing
force. The thing for grandes dames
to do is to go down to the House
and be present at opening of fresh
tourney round Home Rule Bill.
Accordingly, the peeresses, alive to
their responsibility as leaders of high

to Westminster, filling side-galleries
with grace, beauty, and some finely
feathered hats.
Seats on floor also crowded. Patriotic
peers arriving late, finding no room on
the benches where the Union Jack is
kept flying, cross over. Temporarily
seat themselves among the compara-
tively scanty flock of discredited
Ministerialists. Bishops muster in
exceptional number. Their rochets

*Bill presented to Lords as a sort of lay-
figure, which they may, in accordance with
Privy Councillors availing themselves
of the privilege their rank confers to
come thus closely into contact with
what is still an hereditary chamber.
In centre of first row CARSoN uplifts
his tall figure and surveys a scene he
has done much to make possible.
Perhaps in matter of dramaticinterest
the play did not quite come up to its
superb setting. Principal parts taken
by CREwB and LANsdown E. Neither
accustomed to move House to spasms
of enthusiasm. LEADER of House,
introducing what is officially known as
Government of Ireland Amending Bill,
made it clear in such sentences as were
fully audible that scheme does not go
a step beyond overture towards settle-
ment proffered by PREMIER last March.
LANsdown E expressed profound dis-
appointment at this lack of enterprise.
“Rather a shabby and undignified
proceeding on the part of a strong
Government,” he said, “to come down
with proposal they know to be wholly
inadequate, and to hint that we ought
to assist them in converting it into a
practical and workable measure.”
Actual condition of things could not
with equal brevity be more clearly
stated. Bill presented to Lords as
sort of lay figure, which they may, in
accordance with taste and conviction,
suitably clothe. No assurance forth-
coming that style and fit will be
approved when submitted to House of
Commons, final arbiters.

No, this is not the Russian ballet.
It is the English Folk Dance Society,
and their performances at the Royal
Horticultural Hall at Westminster the
other day showed that the Russian
ballet is not to have things all its own
way. I am not going to moralise upon
the salacious quality of some of the
themes of our exotic visitors, but
certainly it would be difficult to find a
stronger contrast to their ruling passion
than is presented by the purity and
simplicity of these country dances.
“Sellinger's Round,” danced to an
air that lulled Titania to sleep all
through the winter at the Savoy, was
the most popular, with its ring of a

Carried away by his own eloquence,
the CHANCELLOR, whilst sarcastically
complimentary to WALTER LONG, went
so far as to call him “The Father of
Form IV.” The putative parent
blushed. There were cries of “Order!"
and “Withdraw ' " SPEARER did not
interpose, and CHANCELLOR hurried on
to another point of his argument.

friend Form IV., at one time a familiar
impulse to party vituperation, was
mentioned in debate. This unexpected
disclosure of its paternity made quite

of their displays, and the better reason
why we should seize, when they come,

delightful exhibitions of an art whose

I still should tremble at her lightest word;
How could I then gain freedom from the spell
Unless I turned completely deaf as well?
So, blind and deaf, I might perhaps recover
A partial peace of mind, but all in vain,
For memories pursue the luckless lover,
And only death can ease him of his pain.

THE CURE FOR CRICKET.
THERE is no longer any doubt that
golf is threatening the supremacy of
our national game. Judged by the
only true standard—the amount of
space allotted to it in the daily press-it
is manifest that the encroachments of
this insidious pastime have now reached
a point where the cricket reformer must
bestir himself before it is too late. We
are convinced that so far we have been
taking much too narrow a view. The
time has come to look for light and
leading outside the confines of our own
Book of Rules. There are other games
besides cricket. Let us call them to
our councils.
In the first place a valuable hint
may surely be found in the develop-
ment of Rugby football. It is common
knowledge what immense results have
followed the introduction, some twenty
years ago, of the Four Three-quarter
System. No spectator (and we cannot
exist without the spectator) would ever
dream now of returning to the old
formation.
Very well.
The same
principle can be easily adapted to our
requirements in the form of the Three
Batsmen System. The pitch would
become an equilateral triangle, and we
should suggest that the bowler have
the option of bowling (from his own
corner) at either of the two outlying
batsmen (at theirs). Lots of interest-
ing developments would follow, as, for
instance, the institution of a sort of
silly-point-short-mid-on in the centre
of the triangle. (Should he be allowed
to wear gloves?)

BALM FOR THE BRAINLESS.
[“If one man has more brains than another,
which enable him to outstrip his fellows, is
not that good fortune? What had he got to
do with it? If your brain is a bad one, it is
not your responsibility. If your brain is a
good one it is not your merit. Some men
have greater physical, mental, moral strength
..] than others that enables them to win in the
race. That is their good fortune and they
ought to be grateful for it; and the one way
they can best show their gratitude is by
helping those who are less fortunate than
themselves. Men endowed with any, or most,
or all of these fortunate conditions ought not
to be stingy in helping others who have not
been so fortunate as themselves."—Mr. LLOYD

We are all familiar with the huge

troduction of the rubber-cored ball,
We don't want to plagiarize, although
a rubber-cored cricket ball is a nice
idea. Why not aim at the opposite
extreme and try a ball “reinforced"

the principle of the semi-circle, outside
of which a goal may not be shot. The
whole pitch might be enclosed in a
circular crease—which would look un-
commonly well in Press photographs.
(We cannot exist without the Press.)
No fielder inside the magic circle would
be allowed to stop the ball with his
feet.
Finally there is the case of billiards,
not a game that is very closely allied
to cricket, but one from which much
may be learned. How has billiards
brightened itself? By adopting the
great principle of “barring" certain
strokes. Here we have got on to some-
thing really valuable. We propose to
go one better, and draw up a schedule
of the different conditions of barring
under which matches may be played.

may be learned, we firmly believe, even

With apologies to “The Westminster
Gazette.”
THE Hoxie of THE SouTH SAxoNs.
Sussex, the county for which Mr.
C. B. FRY (who hurt his leg in the
Lord's centenary match) used to play
before he moved to Hampshire, is an
attractive division of the country to
the south of London with a long sea
border. Mr. KIPLING has praised it in
some memorable verses, and among
frequent visitors to its principal town,
Brighton, is the CHANCELLoR of THE
ExchEQUER. The word Sussex is a
contraction of South Saxon. All will
wish the old Oxonian a speedy recovery
from his strain.
A MonetARY PRoverb.
The origin of the old saying, “Penny
wise, pound foolish,” which has come
into vogue again in connection with
the revised income tax—for who can
deny that the saving of the penny is
wise?—is lost in obscurity; but there is
no doubt that it is very ancient. Many
nations have the same proverb in
different terms as applied to their own
currency. In France the coins to which
the saying best applies would be the
sou and the louis; in America, the
cent and the dollar; and so forth.
CoRDIALITY BEFor E PARTY.
The circumstance of Mr. LULU HAR-
count's unveiling a memorial to Mr.
Joseph CHAMBERLAIN and Mr. AUSTEN
CHAMBERLAIN at the Albert Dock Hos-
pital is not without precedent. On
more than one occasion party differ-
ences have been similarly forgotten.
Thus, several golf players contributed
to The Daily Telegraph shilling fund
in honour of the great W. G. GRACE
some few years ago. Such sinking of
private shibboleths is a very excellent
thing and goes far to show how
thoroughly sound and healthy English
public life really is au fond.
THE NAMEs of CoILEGEs.
Exeter College, Oxford, which has
just celebrated its six hundredth anni-
versary, is not the only college which
bears the same name as that of a city.
Pembroke is another. Keble is, of
course, named after the hymn-writer
and divine; and Balliol, where C. S. C.
played the wag so divertingly, after Bal-
iiol. A propos of Oxford, it is a question
whether that extremely amusing book,
Verdant Green, is still much read by
freshers.
THE AUthor of THE LITTLE
MINISTER.
Sir JAMEs BARRIE, who is said to
have written a revue for production this
autumn at a West-End Theatre, must
not be confounded with the French
sculptor, BARYE, in spite of the simi-
larity of name. BARYE is famous
chiefly for his bronzes of lions, and for-
tunately, in making his studies of these
dangerous animals, he escaped the fate
which so often befalls the trainer of
wild beasts whose animals suddenly
turn upon him.
ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE ALIEN.
ONCE upon a time a poet was sitting
at his desk in his cottage near the
woods, trying to write.
It was a hot summer day and great
fat white clouds were sailing across the
sky. He knew that he ought to be
out, but still he sat on, pen in hand,
trying to write.
Suddenly, among all the other sounds
of busy urgent life that were filling the
warm sweet air, he heard the new and
unaccustomed song of a bird. At least
not new and not unaccustomed, but new
and unaccustomed there, in this sylvan
retreat. The notes poured out, now
shrill, now mellow, now bubbling like
musical water, but always rich with
the joy of life, the fulness of happiness.
Where had he heard it before? What
bird could it be?
Suddenly the poet's housekeeper hur-
ried in. “Oh, Sir,” she exclaimed,
“isn't it a pity ? Someone's canary
has got free, and it's singing out here
something beautiful.”
“Of course,” said the poet—“a
canary;” and he hastened out to see
it. But before he could get there the
bird had flown to a clump of elms a
little way off, from which proceeded
sweeter and more tumultuously exultant
song than they had ever known.
The poet walked to the elms with his
field-glasses, and after a while he dis-
cerned among the million leaves the
little yellow bird, with its throat trem-
bling with rapture.
But the poet and his housekeeper
were not the only creatures who had
heard the strange melody.
“I say,” said one sparrow to another,
“did you hear that ?”
“What?” inquired the other sparrow,
who was busy collecting food for a very
greedy family.
“Why, listen,” said the first sparrow.
“Bless my soul,” said the second.
“I never heard that before.”
“That's a strange bird,” said the
first sparrow; “I’ve seen it. It's all
yellow.”
“All yellow 2" said the other. “What
awful cheek " "
“Yes, isn't it?” replied the first
Sparrow... “Can you understand what
it says?”
“Not a note,” said the second.
“Another of those foreigners, I sup-
pose. We shan't have a tree to call our
own soon.” - :
“That's so,” said the first. “There's
no end to them. Nightingales are bad
enough, grumbling all night, and swal-
lows, although there's not so many of
them this year as usual; but when it
comes to yellow birds—well.”
“Hullo,” said a passing tit, “what's
the trouble now 2 " . - -
“Listen,” said the sparrows.
The tit was all attention for a minute
while the gay triumphant song went on.
“Well,” he said, “that's a rum go.
That's new, that is. Novel, I call it.
What is it 2 ”
“It's a yellow foreigner,” said the
sparrows. * -
“What's to be done with it?” the
tit asked. • * *
“There's only one thing for self-
respecting British birds to do,” said
the first sparrow. “Stop it. Teach
it a lesson.”
“Absolutely,” said the tit. “I’ll go
and find some others.”
“Yes, so will we,” said the sparrows;
and off they all flew, full of righteous
purpose.
Meanwhile the canary sang on and
on, and the poet at the foot of the tree
listened with delight.
Suddenly, however, he was conscious
of a new sound—a noisy chirping and
harsh squeaking which seemed to fill
the air, and a great cloud of small angry
birds assailed the tree. For a while
the uproar was immense, and the song
ceased; and then, out of the heart of
the tumult, pursued almost to the
ground where the poet stood, fell the
body of a little yellow bird, pecked to
death by a thousand avenging furies.
Seeing the poet they made off in a
pack, still shrilling and squawking, but
conscious of the highest rectitude. ..
The poet picked up the poor muti-
lated body. It was still warm and it
twitched a little, but never could its
life and music return.
While he stood thoughtfully there an
old woman, holding an open cage and
followed by half-a-dozen children, hob-
bled along the path. - -
“My canary got away,” she said.
“Have you seen it? It flew in this
direction.”
“I’m afraid I have seen it,” said the
poet, and he opened his hand.
“My little pet !” said the old woman.
“It sang so beautifully, and it used to
feed from my fingers. My little pet.”
The poet returned to his work. “In
tooth and claw,’” he muttered to him-
self, “‘In tooth and claw.’”

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Tents of a Night (SMITH, ELDER) is a quite ordinary story,
about entirely commonplace persons, which has however
an original twist in it. I never met a story that conveyed
So vividly the nastiness of a summer holiday that isn't mice.
The holiday was in Brittany, just the common round,
Cherbourg, Coutances, Mont St. Michel, and the rest of it;
and the holiday-makers were Mr. and Mrs. Hepburn, their
niece Anne, and a rather pleasant flapper named Barbara
whom they had taken in charge. Anne is the heroine and
central character of the holiday; and certainly whatever
discomforts it contained she seems to have done her suc-
cessful best to add to. “This is a beastly place!” was her
written comment upon St. Michel; and it was typical of her
attitude throughout. Of course the real trouble with Anne
was something deeper than drains or crowded hotels or the
smell of too many omelettes: she was in love. Apparently
she was more or less in love with two men, Dragolin Voino-
vich (whose name was a constant worry to Anne's aunt,
and I am bound to say that I share her feelings about it)
and Jimmy Fordyce, a pleasant young Englishman who
pulls the girls out of quicksands and makes himself
generally agreeable. In the end, however—but on second
thoughts the end, emotionally speaking, of Anne is just
what I shall not tell you, as it is precisely the thing that
redeems the book from being commonplace. This you will
various plage-hotels in August, the noise, the crowds, the
long hot meals, the sunshine and constant wind, the sand
on the staircase, and the general atmosphere of wet bathing-
gowns—all these are a luxurious delight to read about
in a comfortable English room. Miss MARY FINDLATER
evidently knows them.
Dippers who have given a new meaning to the classical
motto, Respice finem, are so common amongst novel readers
that PATRICIA WENTwoRTH will only have herself to thank
if many who are unfamiliar with her work fail to do justice
to a book nine-tenths of which is thoroughly interesting
and excellently well-written. As a boy, the hero of Simon
Heriot (MELROSE) is misunderstood, and although Mr.
Martin, his step-father, is a somewhat stagey specimen of
the heavy and vulgar papa, the child's emotions (as, for
instance, when he pretends that the storm of his parent's
wrath is the ordeal of the Inquisition or some far-away
battle of paladins in which he is contending) are finely
conceived, and many of the later passages in Simon's life—
his unhappy love affair with Maud Courtney, his relations
with his grandmother and with William Forster, the school-
master—are quite engrossing and give occasion for memor-
able sketches of character. It is when the natural end of
the story is reached, and Simon has come into his own and
has just been wedded to his proper affinity, that the struc-
ture seems to me to fall with a crash. I might perhaps,
though not without reluctance, have pardoned an imperti-

enjoy; and also those remarkably real descriptions of

Philip, I note with unaffected awe
How, with the glass at 90 in the cool,
You still obey inflexibly the law
That governs manners of the British school;
How, in a climate where the sweltering air
Seems to be waſted from a kitchen copper,
You still refuse to lay aside your wear
Of sable (proper).
The Civil Service which you so adorn
Would losé its prestige, visibly grown slack,
And all its lofty pledges be forsworn .
Were you to deviaté from your boots of black;

The virtue, equal to the stiffest crux,
Which thus forbids your costume to deflect

Suffers the maddening noon to melt your nape

“THE PURPLE LIE.”
“ARABELLA,” I said, examining the fuzzy part of her
which projected above the dome of the coffee-pot, “I
perceive that you mope. That being so, I am glad to be
able to tell you that I have been presented with two tickets
for The Purple Lie to-morrow evening.”
“Sorry,” she replied, “but it's off.”
“Off!” I exclaimed indignantly, “when the box-office is
being besieged all day by a howling mob, and armoured
commissionaires are constantly being put into commis-
sion to defend it. Off!”. -
“What I mean to say is,” said Arabella, “that we're
dining with the Messington-Smiths to-morrow evening.”
I bowed my head above the marmalade and wept.
“Arabella,” I groaned, looking up at last, “what have
we done that these people should continue to supply us
with food? We do not love them, and they do not love
us. The woman is a bromide. Her husband is even
worse. . He is a phenacetin. I shall fall asleep in the
moreover, of the distance to Morpheus Avenue. Remem.
ber that I have been palpitating to see The Purple Lie for
weeks.” -
“So have I,” said Arabella. “It’s sickening, but I am
afraid we must pass those tickets on.”
I happened that day to be lunching with my friend
Charles. “The last thing in the world I want to do,” I
said to him, “is to oblige you in any way, but I chance
to have—ahem —purchased two stalls for The Purple
Lie which I cannot make use of. I had forgotten that
I am dining with 'some very important and—er—influen-
tial people to-morrow night. When a man moves as I do
amid a constant whirl of gilt-edged engagements * >
“Ass!” said Charles, and pocketed the tickets. “ **
On the following morning I perceived a large crinkly
frown at the opposite end of the breakfast table, and,
rightly divining that Arabella was behind it, asked her
what the trouble was. - - -
“..It's the Messington-Smiths,” she complained. “They
can't have us to dinner after all. It seems that Mrs.
Messington-Smith has a bad sore throat.” 2: .
“Any throat would be sore, “I replied, “that had Mrs.
Messington-Smith talking through it. I wonder whether
Charles is using those tickets.” -:
“You might ring up and see.” -
To step lightly to the telephone, ask for Charles's
number, get the wrong one, ask again, find that he
had gone to his office, ring him up there and get
through to him, was the work of scarcely fifteen minutes.
“Charles,” I said, “are you using those two stalls of mine
to-day?” - : - : * : * : *
“Awfully sorry,” he replied, “but I can't go myself. I
gave them away yesterday evening.” - -
From stern, ascetic qualities inside; " “Wurzel !” I said. “Who to ?” - -
Just as the soldier's heavy marching-gear ſ “To whom,” he corrected gently. “To a dull man I met

“Named what 2'' I shrieked. . -
“Messington - Smith.” M for Mpret, E for Eider-

“Where does he live 2" -
“21, Morpheus Avenue.” . . . .
For a moment the room seemed to spin round me. I put
down the transmitter and pressed my hand to my forehead.
Then in a shaking voice I continued —“Of all the double-
barrelled, unmitigated, blue-faced—” - -
: “What number, please?” sang a sweet soprano voice. I
rang off, and went to break the news to Arabella.
She was silent for a few moments, and then asked me
suddenly, “Whereabouts in the stalls were those seats of
ours?” - . . .”
“Almost in the middle of the third row,” I replied
mournfully. . . . . . . * *- :
Arabella said no more, but with a rather disdainful smile
on her face walked firmly to her little escritoire, sat down,
wrote a note, and addressed it to Mrs. Messington-Smith.
“What have you said 2" I asked, as she stamped her
letter with a rather vicious jab on KING GEORGE's left eye,
“Just that I am sorry about her öld sore throat,” she
replied. “And then I went on, that wasn't it funny by the
same post we had been given two stalls for The Purple Lie
to-night in a very good place in the middle of the third
row 2. She will get the letter by lunch-time,” she added
pensively, “and it will be so nice for her to know that we
shall be sitting almost next to them.”
“But we aren't going to The Purple Lie at all," I
protested, -
“No,” she said, “and as a matter of fact I don't suppose
the Messington-Smiths are either—now.” |

ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE SUSCEPTIBLE AMERICAN.
ONCE upon a time there was a beau-
tiful singer named Miss Iris Bewlay.
Every now and then she gave a recital,
and it was always crowded. She was
chosen to sing “God save the King” at
bazaars and Primrose League meetings;
her rendering of “Home, Sweet Home”
moistened every eye. Hostesses wishing
to be really in the swim engaged her to
sing during after-dinner conversation
for enormous fees.
When Miss Iris Bewlay was ap-
proaching the forties and adding every
day to her wealth, another Miss Bewlay
—not Iris, but Gladys, and no relation
whatever—was gradually improving her

YESTERDAY I celebrated
the beginning of my holi-

enraptured, and awoke with
but one desire and that was to hear
Miss Bewlay again.
“Say, where is a Miss Bewlay singing
to-night?” he asked the hotel porter.
The porter searched all the concert
announcements, but found no mention
of the great mame. In the end he
advised a visit to one of the ticket
libraries, and off the enthusiast hurried.
Now it happened that this very
evening was the one chosen for the
début, before a number of invited
friends, of Miss Gladys Bewlay, and
one of the guests chanced to be at the
ticket library at the moment the sus-
ceptible American entered and fired his
question at the clerk.
“Say, can you tell me where Miss
Bowlay is singing to-night?” he said.
The clerk having no information, the
susceptible American was turning away
when the guest of the other Bewlay
family ventured to address him with
the information that Miss Bewlay was
singing that evening at a private
gathering at one of the halls.

America to-morrow.”
The brother, not a little impressed by
his sister's magnetism, all unsuspected
in a débutante, and imagining the
American to have heard her at a lesson,
said he saw no reason why this little
scheme should not be carried out; and
so the American entered and took up
an obscure position; and in a short
while Miss Bewlay ascended the plat-
form and began to sing. -
When she had finished the American
approached one of the guests and begged
to be told the name of the singer.
“Miss Bewlay,” said the guest. “It’s
her first appearance to-night.”
“Miss Bewlay,” gasped the American.
“Then there are two of them. You
say this is her first appearance?”
“Yes.”
“Then she's very young?”
“Only about twenty.”
The American returned to his corner,
and the second song began.
Whatever disappointment his ears

a Song Scena entitled The Moon, by
Bertie Weston, assisted by six mem:

expectation ran through the crowded
audience.
Bertie Weston, wearing a uniform
resembling (I imagine) that of a
Patagonian Vice-Admiral, advanced
mincingly to the footlights, and the
six others, similarly attired, ranged
themselves in a row behind him.
Behind these again dropped a back-
cloth representing a stone balustrade,
blue hills and fleecy clouds.
There was a burst of warm applause,
in response to which Bertie politely
bowed his thanks. Without further
preliminary he commenced—
The crescent moon on high

Here the six turned up their faces
and gazed pensively at the heavens (it
was still broad daylight, by the way),

The six awoke briskly and commenced
to glide around the stage, describing
circles, figures of eight, and other more
intricate patterns, while Bertie swayed
his body rhythmically from side to side,
his arms and hands outstretched and
palms turned downwards. In this
formation they all repeated the chorus
together.
Bertie now cleared his throat and
started on the second verse without
delay. The six stood sideways, their
hands in their trousers pockets and
iheir faces turned to the audience.
Oh, moon of dainty grace,

The footlights were suddenly switched
off and each of the six produced a small
electric torch and illuminated his neigh-

The six ceased sh-sh-ing and grace-
fully invited one another to haste.

The six placed both hands on their
breasts and stood with bowed heads,
motionless except for a continuous and
rhythmic bending of the knees, while
Bertie sang the chorus softly, linger-
ingly. Then, stretching out their arms,
they swayed their bodies from side to
side as their leader had previously done,
while Bertie himself drifted in and out
between them, and all rendered the
chorus for the second time.

There was a moment's emotional
silence, broken by a thunder of raptur-
ous applause. The Song Scena, all too
short, was finished.
Anxious not to risk spoiling the im-

the next turn.

[JULY 8, 1914.
A MIDSUMMER MADNESS.
THE girl who shared Herbert's
meringue at dinner (a brittle one, which
exploded just as he was getting into it)
was kind and tactful. :
“It doesn't matter a bit,” she said,
removing fragments of shell from her
lap; and, to put him at his ease again,
went on, “Are you interested in little
problems at all?”
Herbert, who would have been in-
terested even in a photograph album
just then, emerged from his apologies
and swore that he was. -
“We’re all worrying about one
which Father saw in a paper. I do
wish you could solve it for us. It goes
like this.” And she proceeded to ex-
plain it. Herbert decided that the
small piece of meringue still in her
hair was not worth mentioning and
listened to her with interest. . . .
On the next morning I happened to
drop in at Herbert's office . . . And
that, in short, is how I was mixed up
in the business.
“Look here,” said Herbert, “you
used to be mathematical; here's some-
thing for you.”
“Let the dead past bury its dead,”
I implored. “I am now quite respect-
able.”
“It goes like this,” he said, ignoring
my appeal.
He then gave me the problem, which
I hand on to you.
“A subaltern riding at the rear of a
column of soldiers trotted up to the
captain in front and challenged him to
a game of billiards for half-a-crown
a side, the loser to pay for the table.
Having lost, he played another hun-
dred, double or quits, and then rode
back, the column by this time having
travelled twice its own length, and a
distance equal to the distance it would
have travelled if it had been going in
the other direction. What was the
captain's name?” . . .
Perhaps I have not got it quite right,
for I have had an eventful week since
then; or perhaps Herbert didn't get it
quite right; or perhaps the girl with
the meringue in her hair didn't get it
quite right; but anyhow, that was the
idea of it. - -
“And the answer,” said Herbert,
“ought to be ‘four cows,’ but I keep
on making it “eight and tuppence.'
Just have a shot at it, there's a good
fellow. I promised the girl, you know.”
I sat down, worked it out hastily on
the back of an envelope, and made it a
yard and a-half.
“No,” said Herbert; “I know it's
“four cows,' but I can't get it.”
“Sorry,” I said, “how stupid of me;
I did it hastily again and made it
three minutes twenty-five seconds.
“It is difficult, isn't it?” said Her-
bert. “I thought, as you used to be
mathematical and as I'd promised the
irl * - ... •
g “Wait a moment,” I said, still busy
with my envelope. “I forgot the sub-
altern. Ah, that's right. The answer
is a hundred and twenty-five men . .
No, that's wrong—I never doubled the
half-crown. Er—oh, look here, Her-
bert, I'm rather busy this morning.
I'll send it to you.”. *
“Right,” said Herbert. “I know I
can depend on you, because you're
mathematical.” And he opened the
door for me. *
I had meant to do a very impor-
tant piece of work that day, but I
couldn't get my mind off Herbert's
wretched problem. Happening to see
Carey at tea-time, I mentioned it to
him.
“Ah,” said Carey profoundly. “H'm.
Have you tried it with an ‘a’ ‘’”
“Of course.”
“Yes, it looks as though it wants
a bit of an ‘a’ ” somewhere. You stick
to it with an ‘a’ and you ought to do it.
way. I say, I didn't know you were
interested in problems.” -
“Well— ”
“Because I've got rather a tricky
chess problem here I can't do.” He
produced his pocket chess-board.
“White mates in four moves.”
I looked at it carelessly. Black had
only left himself with a Pawn and a
King, while White had seen to it that
he had a Queen and a couple of Knights
about. Now, I know very little about
chess, but I do understand the theory
of chess problems. -
“Have you tried letting the Queen
be taken by Black's pawn, then sacri-
ficing the Knights, and finally mating
him with the King alone?”
“Yes,” said Cirrey.
Then I was baffled. If one can't
solve a chess problem by starting off
with the most unlikely-looking thing
on the board, one can't solve it at all.
However, I copied down the position
and said I'd glance at it. . . . At
eleven that night I rose from my glance,
decided that Herbert's problem was the
more immediately pressing, and took it
to bed with me.
I was lunching with William next
day, and I told him about the subaltern.
He dashed at it lightheartedly and
made the answer seventeen.
“Seventeen what ?” I said.

of satisfaction that a leading politician
should have frankly admitted that
monkeys possessed qualities which en-
titled their human possessors to high
office and handsome salaries. It was
felt that this admission marked a great
advance on all previous concessions to
the claims of the Simian community,
and pointed irresistibly to the ultimate
grant—already long overdue—of Mon-
that a tailor deserved.
These views however were not shared
by other genera domiciled at the Zoo-
logical Gardens. One of the oldest
lions observed in a strepitous bass that
it was a great relief to him that his
race had not been degraded by any
such comparisons. He had some re-
spect for hun'ers, but as for politicians
he would not be seen dead with them
at a pig fair. Asked whether he had
read Mr. RAMSAY MAcDoNALD's account
of his lion-hunting exploits in The
Daily Chronicle, he professed ignorance
and even indifference. Speaking as an
an anaemic vegetarian to take liberties
with the king of the carnivora.
Considerable resentment was shown
in the Ursine encampment at Mr. LLoyd
GEORGE's somewhat disparaging refer-
ence to the bear's hug. (It will be re-
membered that he compared with it
the attitude of the Tories in respect of
the Finance Bill.) The CHANCELLOR of
THE Exchequer evidently regarded it
as an insincere caress, whereas it was
a perfectly honest expression of hos-
tility. This attack was all the more
unjust and undeserved since the bear
was a most hardworking and underpaid
member of the community. When a
politician reached the top of the poll he
got £400 a year. When a bear did the
same he only got a penny bun.
A conversation with a leading repre-
sentative of the colony of Penguins

just about to enter his father's business,
was spending a holiday in a little fish-

of the sheep-farmer with whom he
lodged was a girl of singular beauty, and

and the sheep, and re-
turned to London. A
year later he married a
distant cousin, and soon
rose to a condition of
prosperity. At the time
our film begins to un-

by everybody in the City,
a widower, and the father
of a beautiful girl of eight-
cen, colled Hyacinth.

dozing in his office. Suddenly
he awoke to find a strange
man standing over him.
“Who are you?” asked
Mr. Bellingham. “What do
you want?”
“My name is
Jasper,” was the
answer, “and I have
some information to
give you.” He bent
down and hissed,
“Your first wife is

Andrew started up
in obvious horror.
“My daughter,” he
gasped, “my little -

containing the marriage certificate, a
photograph of Jessie's father dipping
a sheep, a receipted bill for a pair of
white gloves, size 94, two letters signed
“Your own loving little Andy Pandy,”
and a peppermint with “Jess” on it in
pink. “Once these are locked up in
your safe, no one need never know that

five years ago.”

out, placed the packet in his safe and
returned to his desk.

yet. As soon as the door
had closed behind him
Jasper re-entered softly,
drugged Andrew hastily,
and took possession again

documents. By the time
Mr. Bellingham had re-
gained his senses the
thief was away. A hue-

Richard. He was poor and he was
in love with Hyacinth; the chain of
evidence was complete. In spite of his
impassioned protest from the dock, in
spite of Hyacinth's dramatic swoon in
front of the solicitors’ table, the judge
with great solemnity passed sentence of
twenty years' penal servitude. A loud
“Hear, hear" from the gallery rang
through the court, and, looking up, Mr.
Bellingham caught the sardonic eye of
the mysterious Jasper.
II.
Richard had been in prison a month
before the opportunity for his escape
occurred. For a month he had been
hewing stone in Portland, black despair
at his heart. Then, like lightning, he
saw his chance and took it. The
warders were off guard for a moment.
Hastily liſting his pickaxe

guised, travelled up to London

he murmured as they neared

a moment too soon. An aero-
plane swooped down upon them,
and Hyacinth was snatched from
his arms and disappeared with
her captors into the clouds.

Various other documents for

“You villain,” cried An-
drew, “even at the trial I
suspected you,” and he
leapt on to the next sail and was
whirled after him. At that moment
the wind dropped, and the combatants
were suspended in mid-air.
It was upon this terrible scene that
Richard arrived. Already a crowd was
collecting; and, though at present it
did not seem greatly alarmed, feeling
convinced that it was only assisting at
another cinematograph rehearsal, its
suspicions might at any moment be
aroused. With a shout he dashed into
the mill. Seeing him coming Jasper
dropped his revolver and slid down the
sail into the window. In a moment
he reappeared at the door of the mill
with Hyacinth under his arm. “Stop
him!” cried Richard from under-
neath a sack of flour. It was no
good. Jasper had leapt with his fair
burden upon the back of his mustang
and was gone. . . .
The usual pursuit followed.
IV.
It was the gala night at the Royal
Circus. Ricardo Harringtoni, the won-
derful new acrobat of whom everybody
was talking, stood high above the
crowd on his platform. His marvel-
lous performance on the swinging hori-
zontal bar was about to begin. Richard
Harrington (for it was he) was troubled.
Since he had entered on his new
profession—as a disguise from
the police who were still search-
ing for him—he had had a vague
suspicion that the lion-tamer
was dogging him. Who was
the lion-tamer & Could it be
Jasper? -
At that moment the band
struck up and Richard leapt
lightly on to the swinging bar.
With a movement full of grace
he let go of the bar and swung
on to the opposite platform.
And then, even as he was in
mid-air, he realized what was
happening.
Jasper had let the lion loose!
It was waiting for him. .
With a gasping cry Ricardo Har.
ringtoni fainted.

When he recovered con-
sciousness, Richard found
himself on the S.S. Boracic,

The hair of a maiden it shines, as the balm that is shed

Transmuting to gold an existence that once was as lead.
It glads, it rejoices the soul; recollecting it after
One well-nigh explodes; but I say there are seasons
for laughter,
And, like other great men, I am not at my best in the
morning
When just out of bed.
So it was that last week, when the pitiless glare of Apollo
Was toasting the lawn till it looked like a segment of mat,
When I came to my breakfast at length from a lingering
wallow
In a bath that professed to be cold—as I moodily sat
And observed how the heat on the pavements was
momently doubling, - -
And hated the coffee for looking so brown and so
bubbling, -
And hated my paper, which seemed to expect me to follow
A prize-fight (my hat!)—
When I heard a great noise as though heaven was breaking
asunder,
And “Thanks be to glory,” said I, “for this merciful dole;
The rain! the beneficent rain Will it lighten, I wonder?

And my spirits revived and my appetite seemed to
awaken,
And I said so to Jane as she brought in the kidneys
and bacon;
I was vexed when she answered me pertly, “Why, that

We're taking in coal!”
I say there are limits. The girl may be decent and sunny,
Industrious, sober and what not; I don't care a bit;
But she hasn't a right on a day such as that to be funny,
With the glass at 120, confound her, the chit!
I refuse to submit to the whimsical wheeze of a servant
Just because Araminta's away and the weather is
fervent,
So I said to her, “Wench, do you fancy you're taking my
money
For work or for wit?
“What are parlourmaids coming to now with their insolent
banter? -
Command those uproarious ruffians to hop it, to trek,
And fetch me a siphon or two and the whisky decanter;
Your notions of humour have left me exhausted and weak;
Take the breakfast away; disappointment has van-
quished my hunger,
And afterwards go out at once to the nearest fishmonger
And order two cart-loads of icebergs. Obey me instanter,
- Or leave in a week.” lºvoe.

TERRIFIC STR U G G L E.
MR. LowLY DEFEATS
MR. GoRMAN CRAWL.
How I DID IT.
By FERDINANo LowLY.
Mr. Gorman Crawl's efforts to avoid
defeat in his match with me in the
semi-finals of the Dartmoor and West
Dorset Championship was, I think,
the finest exhibition of Lawn Tennis
that has been seen for many a long
day, and I congratulate those who
were so fortunate as to witness the
game. In the second set particularly,
Mr. Crawl's play exhibited a consistent
accuracy combined with activity of re-
source and hard hitting which, so far
as I am aware, has rarely been
equalled in the history of the pastime.
He frequently returned drives down
the side Iines and cross volleys which I
have always regarded as untakable,
putting me in the position of haying
to repeat those strokes several times
before I could make the ace. Even in
the third set, Mr. Crawl certainly did
not lose heart, as many might have
done; in fact he gained vigour to such
an extent that his play in the last
games became not merely impetuous,
but frenzied. Had I not possessed an
iron nerve, Mr. Gorman Crawl might
have snatched a game or two; and I
feel sorry for my opponent when I recall
that he only made five points in the
set, one of which was due to a net cord
stroke, and another to my accidentally
treading on a ball. The final scores,
as set forth in the “Stop Press"
columns of one of the evening papers,
were as follows:–
“Crawl beat Lowly . . 6–0.6–0. 6.-0,”
and if the reader reverses the state-
ment he will know the correct result.
Mr. Gorman Crawl, after an exhibition
which stultifies previous conceptions
| of what is possible in the way of offen-
sive and defensive tactics, and which
refutes once and for all the leading
contentions in Mr. Wail's monumental
work on the game, was beaten by me
in three love sets.
The game opened by my serving a
| double fault. I then found that I was
using my Thursday's racket instead of
| Tuesday's. After a brief recess, during
which, as I am informed, Mr. Gorman
Crawl took in his belt one hole, the
game proceeded. I served to my oppo-
| nent's back hand, but, contrary to all
| rules laid down by Mr. Wail, he un-
back hand. The result was that I
failed to reach it. It then occurred to
me that I ought to make sure I had no
gravel in my shoes. I did this without
leaving the court. When I had re-
placed my footwear and was preparing
to serve again, I saw that Mr. Gorman
Crawl was lying on the ground, appa-
rently asleep. He started up, how-
ever, on the score being called a second
time, and the game proceeded.
Noticing that my opponent was
standing a long way back, I now made
a display of hitting the ball hard and
then dropped it just over the net. Mr.
Crawl did not notice what was happen-
ing till too late, and I not only took
the ace but had the satisfaction of
noticing that my opponent was breath-
ing hard after his fruitless effort to reach
the ball. I had, so to speak, drawn first
blood. I repeated the ruse with my
next service. Mr. Crawl, being now
on the alert, reached the ball, but was
unable to stop himself, and charged into
the net, and the score was called “thirty
all.” A third time I brought off a drop
serve: the ball was returned and I then
tossed it with an undercut stroke to the
base line. Mr. Crawl ran back, but
the ball bounding high and with a
strong break he lost sight of it, and
after some intricate manoeuvres, in
which he had the advantage of advice
from the crowd, it eventually fell on
his head, and I scored the ace. I had
now only to make one point to reach
the game, and I effected this by a high-
kicking service that left my opponent
petrified. -
During the set Mr. Crawl gradually
got into his game, and, thanks to a
strong instinct of self-preservation, he
succeeded in returning, when up at the
net, many of my drives at his chest
and head which I had thought were
sure of their mark. His play in the
last rally, when the score stood at
“5 games to 0 and 40 love" in my
favour, called forth loud applause, and
I had to do all I knew to prevent him
winning an ace which might have re-
sulted in his eventually capturing the
airne.
At this point an incident occurred
which has been variously reported. The
facts are that, before embarking on the
second set, Mr. Gorman Crawl peti-
tioned the referee that I should be
required to remove my tie. The tie
referred to is my well-known tennis
tie. It is a Mascot, as I associate all
my successes on the court during the
past four years with this tie. It is a
large scarlet, bow with vivid green and
white spots the size of halfpenny pieces,
arranged astigmatically. Mr. Crawl
said the cravat held his eye and put
there were so many spots in front of
him that he did not know which was
the ball. I am glad to be able to add
the testimony of such a first string
man as Mr. Gorman Crawl to the
merits of the “Lowly Patent Tennis
Tie" (Registered No. 273125/1911,
price 2s. 9d., of all Gunsmiths and
Sports Outfitters). I explained to the
referee that the tie was a well-known
patent and that, if he ruled it out and
disqualified the tie, a promising industry
would be irretrievably ruined. The
referee naturally declined to take such
a responsibility and ordered the game
to proceed, and we took our places on
the course. When, however, I faced
Mr. Crawl I found that he had pulled
down the sleeve of his shirt over his
hand and buttoned it round the handle
of his racket. The effect was most
disconcerting, for the racket appeared
to be part of his body—as if, in fact,
he had two elbow joints, and the face
of the bat was the palm of his hand.
Moreover it was impossible to antici-
pate the direction of his shots. When
forty love had been scored against me
I appealed to the referee. The result
of that interview was that M. Gorman
Crawl courteously unbuttoned his
sleeve, and I with equal courtesy re-
moved my tie. The episode was greeted
with loud applause, and for my part I
felt amply repaid for the sacrifice I had
made by the gain in popularity.
I have already referred to the
strenuous character of Mr. Gorman
Crawl's efforts in this set. The follow-
ing is the rally for the third ace in the
fifth game, given in the notation in-
vented by Mr. Wail, though not yet
generally adopted. The diagram will
be found in the third volume of Mr.
Wail's book, How to be always right.

[JULY 8, 1914,
there is seldom much doubt. It is not
uncommon for one of the players to
break down and become almost hys-
terical, and few can hold out long against
one of the champions. Some people
allow facial expression and general de-
meanour to count, but this I do not
recommend. It gives some an unfair
advantage, and I have known it lead to
unpleasantness. - *
Perhaps a short sample will give a
better idea of the game than any
description. I take one from a little
tournament in which I competed a few
days ago, I was highly commended,
but it was thought I displayed a little
too much intelligence. This is one of
the pleasing features of Platitudes;
when one loses, things like that are
somehow said, as they are never said,
for instance, at Bridge. From this
specimen the beginner will learn the
right style and method. Only by study
of the best models and by constant
practice can he attain anything like
proficiency. * -
He. What a world we live in, do we
not ? (This is a very common opening.)
She. Yes, to be sure. Dear, dear!
He. The age is so complex, so full of
rush and hurry. Everyone is running

She. They are not. I mean they are.
He (heaving a sigh). How sad it is
She (in a tone of gentle correction).
It is deplorable. Did you read Mr.

thought it so sweet! He said that the

She. How one deplores these strikes.
He (sternly). They ought to be shot.
She. Too dreadful. I think it is so

one think of the French Revolution.
He. Ah Yes, the French Revolution.
Well, well, the good old days are gone.
She. Yes, they have quite gone.
He (sighing heavily). Dear, dear,
dear, dear! May I have some tea-
cake 2
She. Oh do but I'm afraid they're

He. I like them cold. I think they
are so much cooler then.
She. They are a shade less warm.

He. Oh, it's disgraceful. The Gov-
ernment ought to do something.
She. I call it wicked.
He (much struck with this). You are
quite right.
She. But mind you, I'm fond of
animals myself.
He. Oh, so am I. I dote on dogs.
You know, I call the horse a noble
animal—that's what I call the horse.
She (after a pause). I call the camel
the ship of the desert.
He. Ah, very witty, very clever.
I see you have a sense of humour.
“Ship of the desert”—that's good.
She. Yes, I don’t know what I should
have done without my sense of humour.
He (sharply). No more do I.
She (confidentially). You know, I
think dogs should be treated as dogs.
They should be kept in their proper
places. I like them best in the country,
you know. Don't you?
He. Yes. I think the country is the
place for all animals. One sees so
many there—at least in some places.
She. I am so fond of the country.
It is so restful. The old oaks and the
buttercups and the village rector and
the dear cows. I don't know what we
should do without them.
He. That's what I say. Where
would England be without the country?
She. Ah, yes. “Far from the mad-
ding crowd,” as the poet says.
He. Yes. What a great poet MILTON
is, to be sure. - - -
She. Oh, delightful! And don't you
like Miss WHEELER WILCox 2
He. Of course—ripping, yes, of course.
Her poems of pleasure—her poems of
passion, her—well, in fact, all her poems.
She. Quite.
At this point the man broke down
altogether and began to gibber. But
he recovered in time to see the
prize unanimously voted to the lady.
This consisted of a volume of Mr. —

(CossTABLE) I tremble to imagine the things that certain
fair critics would have said about him. Dut since a woman
is the creator, and one, moreover, with the well-won repu-
tation of Miss STELLA CALLAGHAN, what is there to say ?
After all she must know. As a portrait of futility, Jacynth
is the most mercilessly realistic thing that I have met for
some time. Pretty, brainless, egotistical, utterly unable ever
to understand even the least of the men who loved her—this
was Jacynth. The picture is so unsparing that (though
I am not calling the book a masterpiece or free from dull
moments) the very completeness of the dreadful thing
fascinates you unwillingly. Jacynth was the typical pro-
duct of a seaside town, where she was adored by two men—
a young squire and a famous novelist. I was just a little
bored by her beginnings, especially when she sprained her
ankle—a gambit I had imagined démodé even with the
most provincial of heroines. However, Jacynth married
the novelist, and after the honeymoon settled down to a
steady course of fatuousness and general interference with
his work which presently reduced the poor man to
exasperation, and finally constrained him to pack her off

And not be half convinced it's true,
You simply don't deserve to read it.
There is nothing wrong with Mr. EDEN PHILLPoTTs'
latest collection of short stories, The Judge's Chair
(MURRAY), but there is something vigorously to protest
against upon the wrapper that covers them. For there I
found an uncompromising statement to the effect that these
stories “bring to a conclusion the author's Dartmoor work,"
and no sooner had I read it than my heart sank into my
heels. Solemnly I plead with him to reconsider this decision,
for if he does not his innumerable admirers will be deprived
of something almost as annual and quite as enjoyable as
Christmas. If he wants a holiday let him have one by all
means, though personally I was not pleased when he left
Dartmoor for ltaly. But let it be only a holiday, a break
in his real business. As for the book, I advise everyone
who can appreciate dry humour and quaint philosophy to
sit behind The Judge's Chair. “The Two Farmers" is
on a prolonged visit to
the seaside home of her
maidenhood. After that
Jacynth went from worse
to worst; too prepos-
terous a fool even to be
greatly moved when she
brought tragedy into the
lives of those who came
under her malign influ-
ence. I will not follow
her vicissitudes in detail.
Throughout the book the
most sinister thing in
her story was to me the
fact that a woman had
written it. Moreover I
have a lurking sus-
picion that the portrait

know all about camps and evening schools and blind-alley
employment and the rest of it. But I am pretty well sure
that you have read nothing more practical and human
on the questions of boydom. It is, indeed, the humanity,
sympathetic and more than half humorous, of Mr. PELHAM's
attitude that gives his book its appeal and incidentally,
I fancy, explains his success with the object of it. His
little volume is a plea for personal rather than pecuniary
help, and is directed more especially to Midlanders, since
its chief concern is with the boy population of Birmingham,
I can only wish for it the largest possible number of
readers in the shires and elsewhere, since to read it is
inevitably to be moved to active sympathy.

know Miss Clark and Greek mythology will realise at once that there
will be a natural affinity between the player and the character."

A WARM HALF-HOUR.
WHATEVER the papers say, it was
the hottest afternoon of the year. At
six-thirty I had just finished dressing
after my third cold bath since lunch,
when Celia tapped on the door,
“I want you to do something for
me,” she said. “It’s a shame to ask
you on a day like this.”
“It is rather a shame,” I agreed,
“but I can always refuse.”
“Oh, but you mustn't. We haven't

coming to dinner. Do you think you

“And I’m busy,” I said, opening and
shutting a drawer with great rapidity.
“Just three pennyworth,” she
pleaded. “Nice cool ice. Think of
sliding home on it.”
Well, of course it had to be done.
I took my hat and staggered out. On
an ordinary cool day it is about half-
a-mile to the fishmonger; to-day it
was about two miles-and-a-quarter. I
arrived exhausted, and with only just
strength onough to kneel down, and
press my forehead against the large
block of ice in the middle of the shop,
round which the lobsters nestled.
“Here, you mustn't do that,” said
the fishmonger, waving me away.
I got up, slightly refreshed.
“I want,” I said, “some—” and
then a thought occurred to me.
After all, did fishmongers sell ice?
Probably the large block in front of me

bottles at the chemist's. Suppose I

inferior at the back, and Bill tottered
up with a block about the size of one
of the lions in Trafalgar Square. He
wrapped a piece of Daily News round
it and gave it to me.
“Is that all?” asked the fishmonger.
“That is all,” I said faintly; and,
with Algernon, the overwhiskered crus-
tacean, firmly clutched in the right
hand and Stonehenge supported on the
palm of the left hand, I retired.
The flat seemed a very long way
away, but having bought twice as
much ice as I wanted, and an entirely
unnecessary lobster, I was not going to
waste still more money in taxis. Hot
though it was, I would walk.
For some miles all went well.
Then the ice began to drip through
the paper, and in a little while the
underneath part of The Daily News
had disappeared altogether. Tucking
the lobster under my arm I turned the
block over, so that it rested on another
part of the paper. Soon that had dis-
solved too. By the time I had got

Fortunately The Daily Mail remained.
But to get it I had to disentangle Alger-

There was only one thing to do. I put
the block of ice down on the pavement,
unwrapped the lobster, put the lobster
temporarily in my pocket, spread its

the ice on to the paper, and—looked up

There was no time to lose. I decided
to abandon the ice. Leaving it on the
pavement I turned round and walked

I sprang out, gave the man a shilling,
and got into the lift.
“Bless you,” said Celia, “have you
got it? How sweet of you!” And she
took my parcel from me. “Now we

I looked at it closely.

“I said ice.”
“Oh,” I said, “Oh, I didn't under-

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
SoME OUTSTANDING FEATUREs.
Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--The outstanding
features of the season have certainly
been the Friendship Féte, the Kamt-
chatkan Scriptural opera-ballet, “Noé
s’embarque sur l'Arche,” and the Cloak
The Friendship Fête, to celebrate our
not having had any scraps with any
foreign country for some little time,
was simply immense. There were de-
scriptive tableaux and groups, and the
one undertaken by your Blanche—
swords being turned into ploughshares
and the figure of Peace standing in the
middle, with Bellona crouching at her
fect—was said to be an easy winner.
I was Peace, of course, in chiffon
draperies, with my hair down. I
hadn't the faintest notion what sort
of thing a ploughshare was, but I'd
clever people to help me, and so it was
all right. But oh, my best one! the
difficulty I had in getting a Bellona!
They all wanted to be Peace, and some
of them were so absolutely horrid about
it that I couldn't help telling them
they were only showing how fit they
were to be Belloma! (I will tell you in
confidence that I believe one of them
was responsible for some of my swords
and ploughshares falling down with
an immensely odious crash just as
the opening ceremony was going on.)
Norty was given the group of all
nations, called, “All Men are Brothers,”
and he said on the whole it was rather
a rotten job; there was a lot of friction,
and at one time he was afraid things
might get almost to diplomatic lengths;
however, it all went smoothly at last.
Still be told me di l'oreille that he was
glad it was well over, as two or three
Friendship Fêtes would be enough to
shake the peace of Europe to its founda-
tions ! -
But nothing matters much while one
can go and see the wonderful, wonder-
ful Kamtchatkans in “Noé s'embarque
sur l'Arche”—a feast of beauty—a riot
of colour—a mass of inner meanings.
Who am I, dearest, that I should try
to word-paint it? Being an opera-
ballet, there are two Noahs, a singing
one and a dancing one. While that
glorious Golliookin, the singing Noah,
is giving the marvellous Flood Music
in a gallery over the stage, our dear
wonderful Ternitenky, the dancing
Noah, is going into the Ark in a series
of the most delicious pas seuls. Then
his dance of Astonishment and Alarm
as he sees the waters rising—and
afterwards his dance of Joy and Thank-
fulness at finding himself quite dry !
The Pas de Siac of Noah's Sons and
ing of the Animals! My dearest, you
positively must and shall leave your
solitudes and come and see the Kamt-
chatkans in Scriptural opera-ballet !
Only second to Noé is La Femme
de Lot, with dear Sarkavina, in clouds
of white, doing a sensational whirling
dance as she turns into the Pillar,
while that amazing soprano, Scrienna-
lona, sings the mysterious Salt Music.
Bishops quite swarm at these perform-
ances. They say they consider it their
duty to go, and that they never really
understood the true character of No.AH
till they saw Ternitenky's beautiful
flying leap into the Ark, or quite
grasped the personality of Lot's Wife
before seeing Sarkavina's Pillar-of-Salt
dance.
On Noé and Lot nights it's correct
to carry a little darling Old Testament,
bound in velvet or satin to match
or contrast with one's toilette, and
generally with jewels on the cover;
and the Old Testament is quite often
mentioned at dinner just now, people
pretending they've been reading it,
and so on. propos, Mrs. Golding-
Newman, one of the latest climbers,
excused herself for being late at dinner
somewhere the other night by saying,
“I was reading Deuteronomy and
didn't notice how the time was going.”
The Bullyon-Boundermere woman was
present and, determined to trump her
rival's trick, chipped in with, “Oh,
isn't Deuteronomy charming 2 But I
think of all the books of the Old Testa-
ment my favourite is In Memoriam' "
The Cloak, my Daphne, which is one
of the most interesting arrivals in town
this summer, is, d mon avis, something
quite more than a garment—it is a
great big test of all that a woman most
prides herself on 1 You may see a
thousand women with cloaks on, but
how many will be really wearing them
As one criticised the cloaks and their
wearers in the Enclosure at Aswood
one couldn't help murmuring with a
small sigh, “Who is sufficient for these
things!” People who have the cloak
fastened on in just any way, my dear,
are simply begging the question; in its
true inwardness, in its loftiest develop-
ment, the cloak should be a separate
creation, kept in its place only by the
grace and knack of its wearer. There
should be character about it, a fascinat-
ing droop, a sweet crookedness that
can only happen when it is worn with
the art that—you know the rest.
Shall I conſide to you my little secret,
dearest? Would you know why it is
given to your Blanche to be easily
best of the few women who do really
wear the cloak 2 When I'm ready, all
but my cloak, I run away from Yvonne
the cloak, and when she's beginning to

People have been trying to find new
places to wear their watches. A small
watch on the toe of each shoe (plain
for day wear, jewelled for the evening)
had quite a little vogue, though as
watches they were no good, for no one
could see the time by them. Then
little teeny watches on the tips of
glove-fingers were liked a little. But
the latest development is that Time is
démodé, and anyone mentioning hours
and half-hours is stamped as an outside
person.
Isn't this a fragrant idea about our
not being to blame for anything we do,
because it's all owing to the colours we
live with ? Everybody's charmed about
it. Instead of going to lawyers when
things run off the rails a little, if one
just called in a colour-expert all sorts of
horrors might be avoided, for he would
prove that people are like that owing
to the colours of their curtains and
upholsteries, and aren't to blame them-
selves, poor dears, the very least little
bit ! The Thistledown mênage, for
instance. For ages it's been tottery,
because Thistledown never understood
Fluffy, and Fluffy, poor little thing,
seemed to understand everybody except
Thistledown. We've all been so sorry
for her, for several times he's been on
the point of dragging things into pub-
lic. And now it turns out that nothing
is Fluffy's fault and that, if she hadn't
always had her own, own room done
in pinky-bluey shades, she might have
been quite a serious domestic character!

is expected to pay what it registers!).

Too Much chAMPIONSHIP.
ONCE life was an easy thing.
Yorkshire or Surrey or Kent were
cricket champions. RANJI or W. G.
headed the batting averages; RHoDEs
or RICHARDson the bowling. The office
boy who knew these details plus the
Boat Race winner and the English
Cup-holders could keep his end up in
conversation. He even found time to
do a little work.
But now ! That poor brain must
know that McGinty of Fulham fetched
£1,000 when put up for auction, that the
front line of Blackburn Rovers repre-
sents an expense of £11,321 13s. 4d., and
that Chelsea have played before 71,935
spectators. He must know the cham-
pions of the First, Second, Southern,
Midland, and Scottish Leagues, and the
teams that gained promotion.
Then there is cricket—all worked
out to “those damned dets,” as Lord
RANDolph said in an inspired moment.
Think of the strain of remembering
that Middlesex stands at 78-66 and
Surrey at 72-94. And the sporting
papers are publishing lists of catches
made; and lists of catches missed are
sure to follow. Think of it—you may
have to name the Champion Butter-
fingers in 1915 !
Come to tennis. You must know
the names of the Australian Terror, the
New Zealand Cyclone, the American
Whirlwind. You must at a glance

have the strain of proving that the
victory of a New Zealander over a
German proves the vitality of the dear
old country.
Or boxing. How can an ordinary
mind retain the names of all the White
Hopes or Black Despairs. At any
moment some Terrible Magyar may
wrest the bantam championship from
us. You must learn to distinguish be-
tween WELLs, the reconstructor of the
universe, and Knock-out WELL8. You
must be acquainted with the doings
and prospects of Dreadnought Brown
and Mulekick Jones. You must know
the F. E. Smithian repartees of JACK
Johnson.
Let us talk of golf. No, on second
thoughts, let us notably refrain from
talking about golf. Only if you don't
know who defeated TRAviºns (plus lum-
bago)and who eclipsed America's Bright
Boy; you must hide your head in shame.
We come to rowing. Once one could
say, “Ah, Leander,” and with an easy

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FaoM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, July 6.
—All heads were bared when the PRIME
MINISTER rose to move adjournment of
House in sign of sorrow at the passing
away of a great Parliament man. To
vast majority of present House Joseph
CHAMBERLAIN is a tradition. His per-
sonal presence, its commanding force,
its varied and invariable attraction
are unknown. Since his final re-election
by faithful Birmingham, where, like the
Shunamite woman, he dwelt among
his own people loving and loved, he
only once entered the House.
It was a tragic scene, perhaps happily
witnessed by few. Appointed business
of sitting concluded and Members de-
parted, a figure that once commanded
attention of a listening Senate slowly
entered from behind the SPEAKER's
Chair. It was the senior Member for
Birmingham come to take the oath.
The action was indicative of his
thoroughness and loyalty. No longer
were oaths, rolls of Parliament and
seats on either Front Bench matters of
concern to him. His manifold task was
done. His brilliant course was run.
But, until he took the oath and signed
the roll, he was not de jure a Member of
the House of Commons, and his vote
might not be available by the Whips
for a pair on a critical division.
Accordingly here he was, moving halt-
ingly with the aid of a stick, supported
by the strong arm of the son whose
maiden speech his old chief GLADSToxi,
years ago welcomed as “dear and
refreshing to a father's heart.”
took the oath and signed the roll—an
historic page in a unique volume.
With dimmed eyes he glanced
round the familiar scene of hard
fights &nd great triumphs, and went
forth never to return.
To-day be lived again in speeches
delivered by the PRIME MINISTER,
by the LEADER of the Opposition,
and by the Cabinet colleague and
leader to whom he was loyal to
the last. The practice of de-
liyering set eulogies to the memory
of the departed great is the most
difficult that falls to the lot of a
Leader on either side of House of
Commons. In some hands it has
uncontrollable tendency to the
artificiality and insipidity of funeral
baked meats. Disraeli was a
failure on such occasions; GLAD-
STONE at his best. PRINCE ARTHUR,
usually, supreme, did not to-day
reach his accustomed lofty level.
In fineness of tone and exquisite
felicity of phrasing, Asquith ex-
House of Commons caught a glimpse
of profound depths of a nature habit-
ually masked by impassive manner and

said, he “had exchanged many blows,”
he was even more impressive, not less
by reason of the eloquence of his
speech than by its simplicity and sin-
cerity.
Business done.—In the House of

broken in the Division Lobby. In-
sisting on fighting the Home Rule

Liberal Ministry having for an im-
portant measure the majority, un-

When figures were announced Lord
CREwe, reminiscent of the farmer
smacking his lips over a liqueur glass
of old brandy, remarked to Wiscount
MoRLEY, “I should like some more of
that in a moog.”
Tuesday.—Interesting episode pre-
ceded main business of sitting. Sort
of rehearsal of meeting of Parliament
on College Green. Opened by SHEEHAN
rising from Bench partially filled by
O'Brienites to move issue of new writ
for North Galway. Had it been an
English borough nothing particular
would have happened. Writ would
have been ordered as matter of course,
and there an end on't.
Things different on College Green.
When SHEEHAN sat down, up gat
Captain DoNELAN from Redmondite
camp, which when moved to Dublin
will, by reason of numerical majority,
be analogous to Ministerialists at West-
minister. DoNELAN remarked that in
his capacity as Nationalist Whip he
intended to move issue of writ next
Monday. This fully explained why
O'BRIEN's young man moved it to-day.
Otherwise cause of quarrel obscure.
What they fought each other for dense
mind of Saxon could not make out.
Ambiguity partly due to DoNELAN.
Lacking the volubility common to his
countrymen he had prepared heads of
his speech jotted down on piece of
notepaper. This so intricately folded
that sequence of remarks occasionally
suffered. Situation further complicated
by accidental turning over of notes
upside down. House grateful when
presently TIM HEALY interposed.
He being past-master of lucid
statement, we should now know all
about circumstances which appar-
ently, to the temporary shouldering
aside of Ulster, rocked Ireland to
its centre.
Unfortunately TIM was em-
barrassed by attempt to assume a
novel oratorical attitude. Usually
he addresses House with studied
carelessness of hands lightly clasped
behind his back. Presumably in
consideration of supreme national
importance of the question whether
SHEEHAN should move issue of
writ to-day or DoNELAN on Monday,
he essayed a now attitude. It
recalled NAPOLEoN at Fontaine-
bleau folding his arms majestically
as he bade farewell to remnant of
the Old Guard.
Attempt, several times repeated,
proved a failure. Somehow or other


celled himself. The first time the
TiM's arms would not adjust them-

Myself to Julius Pitherby, Esq.,
Manor Grange, Pimhaven.
DEAR SIR,--I thank you for your
letter. The answers to questions (1),
(2), (25), (27) and (23) are in the affirm-
ative. With regard to the others you
have, no doubt unwittingly, put me in
rather a dilemma. You see, Anderson
left my service when he was sixteen and
I have not heard of him since, though
it is true that I did see his father (who
belongs to this neighbourhood) on the
roof of the church one day last month.

ONCE UPON A TIME.
THE Power of THE PREss.
ONce upon a time there was a quiet
respectable little spell-of-hot-weather,
with no idea of being a nuisance or
doing more than warm people up a bit,

resorts. Directly it reached our shores
every one began to be happy; and they
would have gone on being so but for
the sub-editors, who cannot leave well
alone but must be for ever finding

attentions. Just then they were parti-
cularly free to turn their attentions to
the kindly visitor, because there was
no good murder at the moment, and
no divorce case, and no spicy society

in need of filling. And seeing the little

spell-of-hot-weather was gradually
goaded into the desire really to justify
this excitement.
“Very well,” it said, “I never meant
to be more than 80 in the shade and a
pleasant interlude in the usual dis-

they're determined I'm a nuisance I'll
be one. I'll go up to 84.”
And it did. It reached 84; and the
wise people who like warmth said,
“How splendid If only it would go

[JULY 15, 1914.
THE GUARDFD GREEN.
[It has been suggested that spectators
at popular golf competitions should
be installed in grand stands and
other enclosures, and be restrained
from wandering about the links.]
IN playing his tee shot from in front
of the Green Steward's marquee, Mr.
Tullbrown-Smith, who took the honour
in the final round of the 1916 Amateur
Championship, unfortunately pulled
his ball, with the result that, narrowly
missing the Actors' Benevolent Fund
stand, it entered the grand ducal box.
The Grand Duke Raphael graciously
decided that Mr. Tullbrown - Smith
should be presented to His limperial
Highness before playing out. Pardon-
able nervousness proved fatal to the
shot, which, being badly topped, fell
into the Press pen, where it was photo-
graphed by The Daily Mirror's special
artist before it could be recovered by
its owner.
It is interesting to record that along
the straight mile boarded by the shil-
ling enclosure Mr. Tanquery McBrail,
who had been playing with marvel-
lously decorative effect, had his ball
blown into the bunker at the tenth by
the laughter of the less well-informed
onlookers, while a regrettable incident
was the contribution of several empty
ginger-beer bottles to the natural diffi-
culties of the hazard.
Some dissatisfaction was expressed
among the occupants of the cinema
operators' cage. From the position
allotted to them by the publicity com-
mittee it was impossible to film the
most interesting moments in the Cham-
pionship round, such as Mr. Tull-
brown-Smith's acceptance of a peeled
banana from his caddie on emerging
from the particularly scenic bunker
known as “Hell.” Also a fine “picture”
was missed at the 13th tee, where Mr.
Tanquery McBrail was surrounded by
a militant suffragist, who had invaded
the course in spite of the rabbit-wire
and double chevaux-de-frise.
Owing to the fact that the fashion-
able audience assembled in the Guards',
Cavalry and Bath Club stands insisted
upon encoring both players' wonderful
putts at the 16th green, and the con-
sequent delay of nearly ten minutes,
there were some rather ugly manifesta-
tions of impatience in the cheaper
seats. In spite of the fact that the
Pale Pink Pierrots had been specially
engaged to fill the interval before the
finalists passed, they were so loudly
booed upon their arrival that Mr.
Tanquery McBrail put his mashie
approach into the Parliamentary com-
pound, amidst the jeers and hoots of
the more unruly, who seemed to forget
that the royal and ancient game is not
a music-hall entertainment.
The fact that the links marshal had
placed all the professional players pre-
sent in one row of fauteuils, opposite
the long carry to the 18th green,
hardly seemed to further the interests
of perfect golf. The warmest acknow-
ledgments are therefore due to a
number of ex-open champions, who
kindly turned their backs on what
proved one of the most distressing
episodes in the day's play.
=-
A MARK OF DISTINCTION.
WHEN I passed our butcher's on my
way to the station yesterday morning,
I noticed outside his shop a placard
prominently displayed, which read:—
“Williamson's Spring Lamb. So dif-
ferent from the ordinary butchers.”
There was no apostrophe before the
“s” in “butchers,” so the reference
was clearly to Williamson and not
Williamson's Spring Lamb.
“Is Williamson really different from
his rivals 2" I said to myself, crossing
to the other side of the road to take a
general survey of the shop front. No,
the same sort of joints seemed to be
hanging up as those in other butchers'
windows; the same sort of legends
attached to those which passers-by
were invited to note particularly.
I crossed the road again. Yes, as I
feared. There were several ordinary
flies and at least one bluebottle exercis-
ing themselves on the meat. The
choice cutlets were not isolated or
decorated with garlands, or made a fuss
of in any way. They just fraternised
on terms of equality with the rest.
The usual “ young lady” in a smart
blouse, with her bare pink neck served
up in a ham-fill, sat behind the usual
window, probably trying to work out
the usual sums in butcher's arithmetic.
The top half of Mr. Williamson was
visible behind his chopping-table. He
saw me and touched his hat—a bowler;
nothing very extraordinary about the
bowler. The brim was certainly a
great deal flatter than I like personally,
but quite in keeping with the general
tastes of those who purvey meat.
I thought it better to postpone fur-
ther investigations, and reflected that
Honor might be able to enlighten me
when I returned home that evening.
“No,” she said, when I asked her
about it, “I haven't noticed anything
exceptionally superior about him.”
“Bills-any different?”
“No,” she said, “they take as long
to pay; about as exorbitant as most of
the others.”
“Iſave you observed anything pe.
culiar about his manners, then?” I
said; “does he ever throw chops at
you, for instance, when you pass the
shop 2"
“No such luck,” said Honor; “I’m
a good catch.”
“Perhaps they give you tea,” I said,
“when you make an afternoon call on
the sirloins ?”
“Indeed they don't,” said Honor,
“not even when I go to pay something
off the book.”
“Then perhaps you have cosy little
auction bridge parties in the room be-
hind the cashier's window 2 No 2
Butchers are behind the times.”
“There ought,” said Honor, “to be
a good joke to be made out of that—
a newspaper joke; but I can't quite
see how to make it just yet.”
“That's something to the good,” I
said. “However, to our muttons.”
“Rotten,” said Honor.
“What of his entourage?” I said,
ignoring her comment; “his steak-
bearer and the like 2 ”
“Nothing unusual; just épris with
Emily.”
“Then where, oh where,” I said, “is
this difference that Williamson brags
about 2 ”
“I don't know,” Honor said help-
lessly.
“I shall find out,” I said, “even if I
have to do the housekeeping myself for
a bit.”
“You can take it on,” she said,
“when you like.”
“Aha!” I said triumphantly, as I
burst into the room this evening.
“I've solved the Williamson prob-
lem. He was standing at his door as
I passed just now, in all the regalia of
his dread office.” -
“And you went up to him and said,
‘Well, what about it?' and pointed to
the notice, I suppose.” -
“Not at all,” I said; “I merely
looked at him and the scales ſell from
my eyes. He butches in spats.”
“In the open Golf Championship Troon
won with 78.”—Malay Daily Chronicle.
Next year it will be the saintly AN-
DREw's tuin again.
“With lightning-like repetition of his
strides (his quick action is the essence of his
speed), Applegarth came flying down the
home straight.”—Yorkshire Post.
Seeing that we were looking to APPLE:
GARTH to uphold British prestige at
the next Olympic games, we regret
extremely that the secret of his speed
should have been given away to our
rivals.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ELLEN MELICENT CoboeN can certainly not be accused
of writing too hurriedly. I don't know how many years it
is since, as “MILEs AMBER,” she captured my admiration
with that wonderful first novel, Wistons; and now here is
her second, Sylvia Saxon (UNwiN), only just appearing.
I may say at once that it entirely confirms my impression
that she is a writer of very real and original gifts. Sylvia
Saron is not a pleasant book. It is hard, more than a little
bitter, and deliberately unsympathetic in treatment. But it
is grimly real. Sylvia herself is a character that lives, and
her mother, Rachel, almost eclipses her in this same quality
of tragic vitality. The whole tale is a tragedy of empty
and meaningless lives passed in an atmosphere of too much
Rºoney and too little significance. The “society” of a
Northern manufacturing plutocracy, the display and rivalry,
the marriages between the enriched families, the absence of
any standard except wealth—all these things are set down
with the minute realism that must come, I am sure, of
intimate personal knowledge. Sylvia is the offspring of one
§uch family, and mated to the decadent heir of another.
Her tragedy is that too late she meets a man whom she
supposes capable of giving her the fuller, more complete life
for which she has always ignorantly yearned. Then there
*Anne, the penniless girl, hired as a child to be a play-
fºllow for Sylvia, who herself loves the same man, and dies
-—
her by the dominant personality of Sylvia. A tale, one
might call it, of unhappy women; not made the less grim
by the fact that the man for whom they fought is shown as
wholly unworthy of such emotion. A powerful, disturbing
and highly original story.
“SARI” has been now for a number of years a great
delight to me, and his last work, Beasts and Super-Beasts
(LANE), is as good as any of its predecessors. Clothed in
the elegant garments of Clovis or Reginald, Mr. MUNRo
makes plain to us how lovely this world might be were we
only a little bolder about our practical jokes. In the art of
introducing bears into the boudoir of a countess or pigs into
the study of a diplomat, and then clinching the matter with
the wittiest of epigrams, Clovis is supreme. He knows,
too, an immense amount about the vengeance that children
may take upon their relations, and ladies upon their lady
friends. I like him especially when he monoeuvres some
stupid but kind-hearted woman into a situation of whose
peril she herself is only cloudily aware, while the reader
knows all about it. That is the fun of the whole thing.
The reader is for ever assisting Cloris and Reginald; in the
course of their daring adventures he connives from behind
curtains, through key-holes, from ambushes in trees, and
always, whilst the poor creature is being harried by wild
boals or terrified by º; kittens, Clocis may be
observed, with finger on lip, begging of the intelligent

“Look, ETHEL, Look—THERE Goes SIR BEERBoHM ALEXANDER!”
“So IT Is; BUT How UNLIKE ' "
ONCE UPON A TIME.
TRANSMIGRATION.
ONCE upon a time there was an
even more of an egoist. He thought
only of himself. That is not a foible
peculiar to ostriches, but this particular
fowl—and he was very particular—was
notable for it. “Where do I come in 2"
was a question written all over him—
from his ridiculous and inadequate head,
down his long neck, on his plump
fluffy body, and so to his exceedingly
flat and over-sized feet.
It was in Afric's burning sand—to
be precise, at the Cape—that, on the
approach of danger, the ostrich secreted
his self-centred head, and here from
time to time his plumes were plucked
from him for purposes of trade.
Now it happened that in London
there was a theatre given up to a sea-
$on of foreign opera, and, this theatre
having been built by one of those
gifted geniuses so common among
theatre architects, it followed that the
balcony (into which, of course, neither
the architect nor the manager for whom
it was built had ever strayed) con-
tained a number of seats from which
unless one stood up, and then the peo-
ple behind were deprived of their view.
This, of course, means nothing to
architects or managers. The thought
that jolly anticipatory parties of simple
folk bent upon a happy evening may
be depressed and dashed by a position
suffering from such disabilities could
not concern architects and managers;
for some imagination would be needed
to understand it.
The new temporary management,
however (whatever the ordinary man-
agement might do), recognising the
rights of the spectator, refrained from
selling any seats from which no view
whatever could be obtained and behaved
very well about it—as perhaps one has
to do when half-a-guinea is charged for
each seat; but with the border-line
seats which they did sell—those on the
confines of the possible area—a view
of the stage was only partial and so
much a matter of touch-and-go that any
undue craning of the neck or moving
of the head sideways at once interrupted
the line of vision of many worthy folk
at the back; while anyone leaning too
far forward from a seat in the front
row could instantly, for many others,
obliterate the whole stage.
hot night in July a fat lady in one of
the front seats not only leaned forward
but fanned herself intermittently with
a large fan.
Now and then one of the unfortunate
half-guinea seat-holders behind her in
the debatable territory remonstrated
gently and politely, remarking on the
privation her fan was causing to others,
and each time the lady smiled and said
she was very sorry and put the fan
down; but in two minutes she was
fluttering it again as hard as ever, and
not a vestige of the Pentateuchal caper-
ings or whatever was going forward
could be discerned in her vicinity.
She meant well, poor lady; but it
was very hot, and how could she help
it when her fan was made of that par-
ticular ostrich's feathers?

MY TROUSSEAU.
HAVING been a bachelor from my
earliest youth I suppose I ought to be
accustomed to the condition; but the
fact remains that I miss something
—something which only a wedding
supplies.
Curiously enough this want is not a
wife. I have been without one so long
that I should not know what to do
with her if I had one. I should pro-
bably overlook her, and she would be-
come atrophied or die of neglect or
thirst. Neither do I crave a home of
my own; nor golden-haired children to
climb up my knee. I can do without
these accessories.
But what I do hunger for and what
I will have is a trousseau. Why the
acquisition of a trousseau should be a
purely feminine prerogative –
I have never been able to
understand. A bride with-
out a trousseau is generally
regarded as an incomplete
thing—a poached-egg with-
out toast; a salad without
dressing. But the bride-
groom without a trousseau
is a recognised institution.
True, he has new clothes,
both seen and unseen, but
this is not a trousseau; it is
merely a “replenishment of
his wardrobe.” His least
disreputable old things are
“made to do"; and nobody
thinks slightingly of him
if he attends his wedding
in a re-cuffed shirt or in
boots that have been re-
soled. A girl,
would as soon think of
entering Paradise with a second-hand
halo as she would contemplate being
married in anything that was not
aggressively new.
Thus it is that before my wish can
be consummated I have two honoured
conventions to defy: that only a girl
may possess a trousseau, and that a
marriage is a necessary condition to
the acquiring of it. Fortunately I
am strong-minded. A long course of
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD's homilies has
given me no little facility in achieving
this attribute, and I am determined
that I will change neither my sex nor
my status.
Now, I have prepared a list, just as
—I suppose—every girl does. In the
first place I am going to indulge in
the hitherto undreamt-of luxury of a
surfeit of dress-shirts. No one who
has not experienced life on two dress-
shirts—one in wear, the other in the
wash—can quite understand what this

however, to push Hen.”
BEECHAM, Mr. MALLABY-DEELEY, Mr.
Solly JoBL, Lord HowARD DE WALDEN,
and others, who, I daresay, have four
or even five, cannot know what it is
to feel that their evening's refresh-
ment and entertainment depend on
their finding the French chalk or the
india-rubber.
Therefore I am making no stint in
this matter. I am having fifteen dress-
shirts, so that there may be one for
wear each day in the week, seven in
the laundry, and one over for emer-
gencies—like Parsifal, that begins
|in the middle of the afternoon. I mean
to be similarly lavish in the matter of
collars and handkerchiefs. The number
of the former which I am buying
lºmounts almost to an epidemic; while
the extent of my commission in the
latter is the result of lessons learnt in

the hard school of experience. I say
unhesitatingly that the man who tries
to get through life on a mere dozen
handkerchiefs is simply begging for
disaster, as, however methodical in
their use he may be, a carelessly-caught
cold may any day upset his reckoning
and leave him at a loose end; some-
times scarcely that. Hence I am doing
this part of my trousseau in princely
fashion. I am having half a gross of
them.
Then there is my slumber-wear. For
years I have hungered for silk ones,
but have had no conscientious excuse
for appeasing my appetite. To buy silk
pyjamas in cold blood has hitherto
seemed to me to be sheer cynical ex-
travagance; but now I feel that cir-
cumstances justify me in my action,
for it would be a very sorry thing for
me to encounter a burglar or cope with
a fire clad in apparel that would not
be up to the standard of the rest of my
Now, I am a great believer in dressing
for the spirit of the moment; therefore
I have resolved upon a pretty colour-
scheme for my night-wear. My pyjamas
are to be of tints conducive to refresh-
ing rest, namely and severally white,
lemon, light pink, and pale green—an
idea which I candidly confess was in-
spired by the spectacle of a Neapolitan
ice. If you think that this is merely
an idle whim, just imagine endeavour-
ing to sleep in pyjamas patterned like
an Axminster carpet or a Scotch tartan.
No wonder Macbeth “murdered sleep”
if he was arrayed in garments of his

I have brought the same aesthetic
sense to bear upon my choice of ties
and socks: greys and blacks for times
of grave political crises; fawn, buff,
|pearl, moose—I am not sure that this
— is a colour, but it sounds
quite possible—for brighter
hours; and colours familiar
to every student of spectro-
scopy for halcyon days of
| rejoicing—the opening of
the Royal Academy, the
| Handel Festival, the return
of HARRY LAUDER, or the
elevation of Mr. BERNARD
SHAw to the peerage.
As for externals, suffice
it to say that they will be
en suite, and that I intend
to introduce just a little
touch of originality into my
trousers. I am going to
have them made with spats
sewn to the leg-ends in
order to save time and
trouble in dressing.
In short, I have forgotten
-- - nothing, except spare studs,
and I think it is quite likely that
I shall remember them too in course
of time. I have even gone so far as
to fix a day for a dress rehearsal.
But first I shall invite my friends,
as is the way with brides-elect, to a
private view of my trousseau, when
they shall see all of it spread upon the
coverlet of my bed, over the backs of
my chairs, or hanging in serried ranks
in my wardrobe.
And now nothing more remains
to be done but to raise the necessary
funds, and with this object in view
I have instructed my broker to draw
my money out of the Savings Bank.
I am expecting a postal-order almost
any moment. -

THE AWAKENING
(A Little Romance of the Restaurant-Car).
Is there a sight so soothing to the brain
Of scarce-remembered boyhood to his heart.
As England's outlines green and softly curved,
But I refrained; and he took cherry tart
Visions of wooded slope and fertile plain
And after that two different kinds of cheese.
Seen by the traveller in a dining-train,
And then we neared a little market town
No doubts to vex him and no talk to strain,
His seat, his chance companion, both reserved ?
Half hidden in the dale, that seemed to cling
Fondly about a church of old renown;
I think not. Yet the rather stoutish man
And here the fat man started and looked down
Who never raised his head but chewed and chewed
And filled his tumbler to the foaming crown
Annoyed me as I feasted. I began
And held it high as if to pledge the King.
To deem him one who had no higher plan,
Some memory seemed to stir within his breast
No larger outlook in life's journeyings, than
As though the curtain of old days were torn,
Resonant demolition of his food.
And, as he drained the glass with eager zest,
"Behold," I thought, " I wronged him. In that nest,
I longed to point to him the hedges twined
So far from turmoil, full of old-world rest
With starry blossoms, and the coats like silk
(He is about to tell me), he was born.
Of oxen as they wandered unconfined;
I longed to ask him if his heavier mind
** And now, before the antique spire hath fled,
Preferred the cattle of more stedfast kind
Because remembrance of his home is dear,
Stamped with advertisements of malted milk.
He toasts it deeply.” All my wrath was dead.
Then the man smiled at me and wagged his head;
The little red-brick hamlets, poised apart,
“ Junction for Little Barleythorpe," he said ;
And all the grandeur of the rolling leas-
“A week ago these points upset my beer."
I longed to ask him if they brought no smart
Evor.

THE PUNCHER'S GRIEWANCE.
“You journalist chaps just spoil us,”
said Puncher Pete, when I called upon
him yesterday at his training camp.
“You draw us into conversation, stick
down our remarks in your note-books,
and then make us out to be the biggest
boasters on the face of the earth. It's
not right.
“For instance, you've got it on the
tip of your tongue to ask me if I think
I'll lick Jimmy Battle next Thursday.
Well, of course I'll lick him. Jimmy's
a good boy, but he can't stay, and then
he hasn't gone twenty rounds with
three blacks, as I have. But what's
my opinion matter to you? Why

rotunds will cure him. All right. Very
well then. Leave it at that.

say you're ill.’ ‘You tell 'em to mind
their own ills,' I gave him back.

could do this 2" -
The Puncher seized a skipping-rope
and did marvellous things with it.
Then he smashed lustily at a punch-
ball, left, right, left, right, duck, bing!
“Here, Harry!” he cried. His spar-
ring partner approached, bruised but
beaming. The Puncher knocked him
down.
“I seem ill, don't I?” said Pete,
turning to me. “But what's it got to
do with all you chaps, anyway? Wait
till Thursday. Then you'll find out
whether I'm ill or not. And even if I
was ill Jimmy couldn't do it. Jimmy's
got as good a punch as the next man,
I'll say that for him. If he gets it in
it would fell an ox. But can he get it
in 2 Not next Thursday.
“Now, see here, you're not going to
draw any words from me about the
coming fight. You may draw others.
I refuse. Let's get right off this fight
and on to other things.
“After all, fighters are modest chaps.

“Take my victory over Quartermain,
again. Or over Dinghy Abbs, who was
down and out in the second round in
spite of all the fuss that was made about
him beforehand. I was a sick man at
both these fights. Not a soul knew it,
mind you. My wife—for I'm as fond
of home life as any ordinary man, and
we have a little baby—my wife used to
worry terribly. . She'd expect me to
come home on a stretcher. But I
never happened to choose that convey-
ance, and she don't fret any more.
“Will it be a stretcher on Thursday?
I can see you want to put that question,
but I'll ask you to excuse me. Next
Thursday, as I’ve already hinted, will
tell its own story, and when I say that
the tale will have a happy ending for
one of us who isn't too far from your
ear to boast about it if he was inclined
that way, perhaps you'll guess without
my telling you what I mean.

EXERCISE 1.
I MUST confess that at one time I
had little regard for collectors of
cigarette cards; it seemed a feeble
pursuit, though perhaps I should add
I am of a somewhat intellectual nature.
Some little time ago, however, I
happened to glance at one of these
cards and was surprised to see a picture
of agentleman attired in white flannels
and a vest of white, decorated with red
embroidery. He was grasping a towel
in both hands and appeared to have
two or three sets of arms. The label
said, “Scarf or Towel Exercises 4.” A
perusal of the instructions on the back
of the card made everything clear.
Ten minutes later I entered the shop
of an athletic outfitter. Unfortunately
he had no white vests with red edges;
I had to purchase one with blue. A
Scarf or towel I could find at home.
Then I entered a tobacconist's.
Four days later I had collected Scarf
or Towel Exercises 2 and 3.
“We can,” I said, “now make a
start.”. As a matter of fact it was not
altogether a foolish proceeding. Deep
thinkers are apt to overlook the need
for physical culture. This error I
decided to remedy.

head in manner indicated by the in-
structions, (3) straightened right arm
and lowered right hand so that towel
(still taut) sloped to right, (4) returned
to Position 1. I then changed towel
for scarf (my own idea) and continued
with Exercises 3 and 4.
I was very happy; my only worry
was the absence of Scarf or Towel
Exercises 1.
Every morning I called at the
tobacconist's and purchased packets of
cigarettes, eagerly searching them for
the missing card. Every aſternoon I
called again.
For a week I bore my disappointment
bravely; then I became cynical.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE SIN OF DAVID.”
This is not, like the plays in which
Joseph has recently figured, an adapta-
tion from the Hebrew. Mr. STEPHEN
PHILLIPs has given a seventeenth-
century (A.D.) setting to the BATH sheBA
motive, transplanting it from the poly-
gamous East into the England of one-
man-one-wife. His object, no doubt,
was to emphasize one aspect of his
borrowed theme, which is further en-
forced by his choice of milieu — the
camp of the Puritans. ... *
Lest this fairly obvious note of
irony should escape us, Mr. PHILLIPs
accentuates it at the start by making
his DAvid (Sir Hubert Lisle, Com-
mander of the Parliamentary Forces in
the Fenland) condemn a young officer
to be shot for a “carnal" offence. The
delinquent's answer—
“Thou who so lightly dealest death to me
Be thou then very sure of thine own soul;"
and Lisle's prayer—
“And judge me, Thou that sittest in Thy
Heaven,
As I have shown no mercy, show me none ! ..
If ever a woman's beauty shall ensnare
My soul into such sin as he hath sinned"—
these passages, even if the title of the
play had not prepared us, afford fair
warning of the way in which things
have got to go. In fact it is all very
simple and straightforward, and (on
the constructive side) Hellenic. Per-
haps indeed the treatment is a little
too direct, and the tragedy moves too
quickly to its consummation (thirty or
forty minutes suffice for the reading of
it). It might serve its publisher (of the
Bodley Head) as one of a series to be
entitled: “Half-hours with the Best
Sinners.”
As a poem The Sin of David cannot
compare for beauty with Paolo and
Francesca, though it contains isolated
lines which recall Mr. PHILLIPs's
earliest drama, such as the plea of
Joyce, the condemned officer—
“Her face was close to me, and dimmed the
world.”
or Lisle's—
“Thou hast unlocked the loveliness of
earth.”
But then, of course, the exotic manner
would here have been an impropriety.
This is not Rimini; it is the English
Fenland; and all the characters, with
the exception of Miriam Mardyke (the
BATHSHEBA of the piece), who was bred
in France and had its sun in her blood,
were of the Puritan pattern that does
not accommodate itself very easily to
the language of passion.
But all this we knew ten years ago,
lished; and the only new interest was
the question of its adaptability to the
theatre. Poetic drama seldom gains
much by presentation on the stage,
unless it is full of action; and there is
little action in this play except of the
inward kind. In almost the only case
where quick movementis here demanded
one becomes conscious of the intrusion
of words. When he knows that ; the
relief of Pomfret depends upon his in-
stant action, Lisle still finds time for
conversations with his servant, with
Miriam and with the doctor, and for
a couple of well-sustained soliloquies.
Certain lines, again, whose literary
flavour, when read, makes us overlook
Mr. H. B. Inving (Sir Hubert Lisle).
“Pomfret will fall in another two seconds if
I don't ride over and raise the siege. Still,
my first duty is to Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPs,
and he wants me for a few dialogues and a
brace of soliloquies before I start.”
their inherent improbability in the
mouth of the character that utters
them, take on, when spoken, an air of
artifice. Such are the lines in which
Miriam describes her old sister-in-law,
to her face, as
“living without sin
And reputably rusting to the grave.”
And there is always the danger that
actors will be content with a rather
slurred and perfunctory recitation of
lines that have no bearing on the
action but are just inserted for joy as
a rhetorical embroidery.
It may be a trivial criticism, but I
think the play suffered a little from the
appearance of the love child whose
death was to be the punishment for
Lisle's sin in sending Mardyke to his
death in a forlorn hope. The instruc-
tions in my book are contradictory.
“five years later,” and we are then told
that “four years are supposed to have
elapsed since Act II.” Anyhow, the boy
should be only three or four years old.
Actually he is a girl (the stage must
have it so) of some ten summers... You
may say that all these years during
which the lovers' passion has been
purified by worship of the child's inno-
cence, and “God has not said a word,”
add a dramatic force to the blow when
at last it falls. But for myself—a mere
matter of taste—I feel that the ven-
geance of Heaven has been nursed too
long. -
As for the interpretation, I must
honestly compliment Mr. IRVING and
Miss MIRIAM LEwes on their perform-
ance. It is true that I should never
have mistaken Mr. IRVING for a fight-
ing Roundhead, and he might well have
sacrificed something of his personality
for the sake of illusion. It is true, too,
that he was more concerned about
dramatic than poetic effects; yet, within
the limitations of a very marked indivi-
duality, he did justice to the author by a
performance that was most sincere and
persuasive. Miss LEwRs played her
more difficult part with great charm
and delicacy. Her manner, even under
stress of passionate feeling, still kept the
right restraint that Miriam had learnt
from her environment; but always we
were made to feel that under the prim
Puritan gown was a body that had
been “born in the sun's lap,” and held
the warmth of the vinelands in its veins.
Perhaps it was from France, too, that
Miriam had caught her strange habit
of pronouncing “my" (a perfectly good
word) as “me.”
There is little so worth seeing on the
stage to-day as The Sin of David, and
I very sincerely hope that both the
play and its interpreters may win the
wide appreciation they have earned.
It is unfortunate that Mr. ARTHUR
EcKERLEY's ingenious little farce, 4
Collection will be made, was only
introduced into the bill at the Garrick
two days before the withdrawal of the
Duke of Killicrankie, and that, like
the melancholy Jaques, it has had to

to its early reappearance under happier
auspices, and with Mr. GUY NEWALL
again in the leading part.

“VERY well,” said the lady of the house, “don’t let's do it.
Nobody can force us to go to the seaside if we don't want to.”
“It's too late,” I said, “to begin to agree with me now.”
“It's never too late to realise how reasonable you are.”
“Yes, it is. The agreement is signed; half the rent has
been paid; Sandstone House has got us by the legs, and,
whether we like it or not, we've got to go there next week.”
“We might try the effect of a death-bed repentance.”
“No,” I said, “we’re dead already. We died when
the blessed agreement was signed.”
“Well, then, let's write and say our aunt from British
Columbia is about to arrive here unexpectedly on a visit to
us, and that sand and seaweed and prawns and star-fish are
simply death to her. We can wind up with a strong appeal
to the landlord's better nature. No true landlord can
wish to be responsible for the death of anybody's British
Columbian aunt.”
“You’re quite wrong,” I said. Landlords just revel in
that kind of thing. Besides, he will not believe in our
aunt. He will say that she is too thin.”
“But the aunt I'm thinking of is stout and wheezy.
She is a widow; her name is Aunt Wilhelmina; except
ourselves there's nobody in the world left for her to cling
to... No marine landlord can dare to separate us from Aunt
Wilhelmina.” -
“It's no good,” I said.
Wilhelmina—” - -
“She's only mine by marriage, you know; but I love
her like a daughter.” - -
“I admit,” I continued, “that Aunt-by-marriage Wilhel-
mina may some day be useful to us. We will put her by
for another occasion. But she can't help us now.”
“Well, go ahead yourself and suggest something, then.”
“I could suggest a thousand things. Suppose we just
pay the rest of the rent and don't go.”
“The man,” she said with conviction, “is mad.”
“I thought you'd say that, and I know you'd say the
same about any other suggestion of mine, so I shan't make
any more.” -
“You mustn't be sulky,” she said.
“I never am. I'm reasonable, but, as usual, you'll
realise it too late. Besides,” I added, “it’s you who've
brought us into this fix.”
“I?” she said with an air of wonder.

“I’ll tell you,” I said firmly, for I saw that my chance
had come. “For weeks and weeks past you have been
engaged in shutting up avenues and closing loop-holes.
Wherever there was the tiniest way of escape from the
seaside, there you were with your walls and your fences,
until at last you'd got me safely penned in.”
“You didn't struggle much, did you?”
“No, I was like the man in The Pit and the Pendulum,
and you were—whoever it was that made the walls close
in on him.”
“I refuse,” she said, “to be called a Spanish Inquisition.”
“You may refuse as much as you like, but that's the
sort of thing you've been. How you worked on my
domestic affections and my household pride! When Helen
forgot to go to her music-lesson you said the poor child
was evidently run down and wanted a breath of sea-air.

“No," I said, “I am not—I mean I am hurt, but I'm
not shouting. I'm just whispering a few salutary truths.”
“And there's another thing,” she said; “it must be ter.

“Madam,” I said, “my wife is as heaven made her. I
will not permit her to be abused. She has good impulses.
She means well. Her plain sewing is quite excellent.”
“Spare me,” she said, “oh spare me. I will never go to

KITTY ADARE.
Sweet as a wild-rose was Kitty Adare,
Blithe as a laverock and shy as a hare;
Mid all the grand ladies of all the grand cities
You'd not find the face half so pretty as Kitty's;... . .
“'Tis the fine morning this, Kit,” says I; she says, “It is,'
The day she went walking to get to the Fair.
She was bred to give trouble, was Kitty Adare,
For she had my heart caught like a bird in a snare;
O, her laugh was the ripple of quick-running water,
And—the seventh-born child of a seventh-born daughter—
She wore the green shoes that the fairies had brought her
To help her go dancing that day at the Fair!
She'd the foot of a princess, had Kitty Adare,
And the road fell behind her like peel off a pear;
She was into the town with the lads and the lassies,
And the shouting of showmen and braying of asses,
And on to the green where the best of the grass is,
With the sun shining bright on the fun of the Fair!
*
She was light as a feather, was Kitty Adare,
And she danced like a flame in a current of air;
O, look at her now—she retreating, advancing, -
And stepping and stopping, and gliding and glancing !
There wasn't a one was her marrow at dancing
Of all the young maidens who danced at the Fair.
O Kitty, O Kitty, O Kitty Adare,
Till the music was beaten you danced to it there;
And the fiddler, poor fellow, the way that he was in,
Him sweating for six and his bow wanting rosin,
He was put past the fiddling a month—all because in
a more bracing climate; and when Bates tripped up in the
A pair of green shoes Kitty danced at the Fair!

MY SLEEP.”
OUR BookING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IF memory serves me, the publishers of World's End
(HURST AND BLACKETT) described its theme as one of
unusual delieaey, or words to that effect. I should like to
reassure them. The particular kind of marriage of con-
venience which it concerns (marriage for the convenience of
the wronged heroine, by which the virtuous hero gives his
name to the child of the villain) may be, indeed is, a delicate
matter, but—in fiction at least—by no manner of means
unusual. Nor can I see that its present treatment by
AMéLIE Rives (Princess TroubEtzkoy) lends it any degree
of novelty. No, let me be just; perhaps Richard Bryce, the
wicked betrayer, does strike a somewhat new note, at least
in his beginnings. Itichard was the product of art super-
imposed upon dollars. He was so cultured that the
humanity in him had dwindled to a negligible quantity;
and thus, when poor Phoebe wanted him to “do the right
thing by her,” he sent her instead some charmingly modern
French verse—which she could not understand—and finally
took ship for Europe in mingled alarm and boredom. You
will have gathered that the scene is laid in America.
Perhaps this explains the hero. Owen Randolph was one
of the strong and silent. He was so silent that, though he
knew perfectly well all that had happened, he married
Phoebe, and allowed that unhappy lady to suffer chapters
of agonized apprehension as to his attitude, when half-a-
dozen words would have set her at ease on the subject.
He was, moreover, so strong that, when eventually the
himself, and IRichard, the latter spent some months in
hospital as a consequence. However, he recovered, and
things were thus able to reach the kind of ending which
was expected of them. There are parts of World's End
that are worthy of a better whole, but that is the best I can
say for it.
I believe that Paul Moorhouse (Long) was never really
predestined to end unhappily and that his suicide was a
conclusion as little premeditated by the author as it was
apparently by the hero. If such ends must be, they should
be a climax demanded by relentless logic: some sort of
culminating event should c2cur which, added to what has
gone before, leaves no alternative. Paul, however, had
survived for years under the stress of all the circumstances
which finally constrained him to make an end of himself;
and, had he stayed the course—only another hour or so—he
would have found that all had turned out for the best and
that adequate arrangements had been made for his perman-
ent happiness. No doubt these things happen in real life
and I cannot accuse Mr. GEORGE Would (a most discerning
author) of any inhuman treatment of his puppet; yet I
wish that he had been more kindly disposed and had spared
me a bitter disappointment. Having known Paul, man
and boy, for upwards of ten years, I had become sincerely
attached to him; as assistant time-keeper, foreman and
works-manager he showed a spirit true to the real Black
Country type. He had his moments of weakness when he
went astray after the manner of his kind; but he always
became master of himself again and, when he had to, paid

his due, she was a dear; poor dear!
I do not think that you will believe The Story of Fifine
(CoNSTABLE), although Mr. BERNARD CAPEs takes some
pains to give it an air of actuality; but if you are like me
you will not be greatly concerned about that. Purporting
to be the ill-used daughter of a mad French marquis,
Fifine, in that naïve and charming way which has always
been so dear to the hearts of novelists, came to live at the
bachelor abode in Paris of the sculptor Felic Dane (his half-
sister, who was keeping house for the marquis, provided
the introduction), and, calling each other “cousin” and
“gossip,” these two shared rooms together in perfect sim-
plicity of soul and held several conversations which reflect,
I suppose, Mr. BERNARD CAPEs’ views on the plastic arts
and life in general. And why, in passing, he should con-
tinue to heap ridicule on staid Victorian respectability I
cannot for the life of me imagine. The plucky and un-
orthodox thing nowadays -
surely is to make game
of Bohemianism. But,
anyhow, the happy mc-
mºntforms arriºi when
Felix Dane suggested (on
the grounds that the
marquis would soon dis-
cover his daughter's hid-
ing-place) a holiday tour
through Provence. Mr.

more encouragement, I believe I should have been quite
anxious to kick her husband from the top to the bottom of
several flights of stairs. Drastic methods were taken by
the author to bring Richard to his senses; in fact, at one
time he made a sort of corner in disasters. But unless a
sanatorium exists where patients are treated kindly and
firmly for swollen-head I do not think that Richard's cure
is likely to be permanent. That, however, does not affect
my view that Mrs. DAwson Scott has given us a book
which is full of clever writing and fairly shrewd observation.
“It was a wild wet night, though the month of May was
well begun.” Without caring very much about the month
of May, I felt on reading these introductory words that the
story called My Lady Rosia had excellently well begun. I
am sorry to add, though, that it does not carry on quite so
bravely as you might expect from such a start. My own
suspicion is that Lady Rosia is one of many novels that
owe their existence to a summer holiday, I haven't the

cuted as heroines should

which their fairyland is portrayed. And if the plot ends as
artificially as it began, and with an unnecessary tragedy
thrown in, I suppose for the sake of that idyll in the very
nesting-place of idylls I must shrug my shoulders and for-
give. After all, it does not matter much who Fifine really
was, nor what happened to her. Suffice it that Mr. BERNARD
CAPEs has conducted her to Arles.
The Caddis-Worm (HURST AND BLACKETT) is an appro-
priate enough title for Mrs. DAwson Scott's novel, but I
confess to having grown a little restive at its appearance
on the top of each of 352 pages. “Bpisodes in the Life of
Richard and Catharine Blake" is the alternative title, and
to the average human reader possibly a more significant
one. The Caddis-Worm is quite in the modern manner,
having no plot—or what has been contemptuously called
“anecdote.” I have, however, a more genuine grievance
against Mrs. DAwson Scott, and it is that she seems
inclined to be a propagandist without the requisite robust-
ness. A little more vigour in her protests against the
iniquity of British laws, and her theme might have allured
me. As it is, the troubles of Catharine with her peremp-
tory Richard only made me want, but not very keenly, to
as before. You perhaps catch already my chief ground of
complaint. Frankly I do not think that Miss Groves' pen
is quite sufficiently dashing for this sort of thing. Historical
and adventurous romance, if it is to earn my vote, must keep
me out of breath the whole time. It should never be allowed
to slacken pace; and (to be entirely candid) My Lady Rosia
sometimes ambles rather heavily. I forgot to add that it is
published by WASHBourne, printed on detestable paper,
and contains some pleasant illustrations of the places men:
tioned in the story. In few, the best I can say of it is that it
would make a charming gift for the young Person (if she still
survives) on the occasion, say, of a family holiday to Hastings.

THE USES OF OCEAN.
(Lines written in an irresponsible holiday mood.)
To people who allege that we
Incline to overrate the Sea,
I answer, “We do not;
Apart from being coloured blue,
It has its uses not a few—
I cannot think what we should do
If ever ‘the deep did rot.’”
Take ships, for instance. You will note
That, lacking staff on which to float,
They could not get about;
Dreadnought and liner, smack and yawl,
And other types that you'll recall—
They simply could not sail at all
It Ocean once gave out.
And see the trouble which it saves
To islands; but for all those waves
That made us what we are—
But for their help so kindly lent,
Teutons could march right through to Kent
And never need to circumvent
A single British tar.
Take fish, again. I have in mind
No better field that they could find
For exercise and sport;
How would the whale, I want to know,
The blubbery whale, contrive to blow ;
Where would your playful kipper go
If the supply ran short 2
And hence we rank the Ocean high;
Dut there are privy reasons why
Its praise is on my lip :
I deem it, when my heart is set
On walking into something wet,
The nicest medium I have met .
In which to take a dip.
Ah, speed the hour already fixed
When, mid the bathers (freely mixed),
In a polite costume -
I mean to plunge beneath the spray
And, washing from a soul at play
The City's stain—three times a day—
Restore its vernal bloom.
Rocked like a babe upon the brine
It is my dream to float supine
And to the vast inane
Banish awhile from off my chest
The cares that hold it now obsessed,
And even take a clean-cut rest
From Ulster-on-the-brain.

The Best Holiday Insurance.
Mr. Punch ventures to hint to the gentlest among his
readers that, while there are excellent methods of insuring
against the disturbance of their holidays by accident or bad
weather, the best way for them to insure happiness is to
offer a share of it to those who cannot afford a holiday of
their own. The very easy sum of TEN SHILLINGs means
a Fortnight among green fields or by the sea for one poor
child, if the gift is sent—and now is the moment—to the
Earl of ARRAN, Hon. Treasurer of the Children's Country
THE CRISIS.
[“Ilord Macaulay's prose scems to be finding favour again.”
Oshkosh Sentinel.]
THE place, too, was well fitted for such a gathering.
Memories of departed monarchs spoke from the rich
hangings of the room in tones that were not less eloquent
for being silent. Here the FIRST GENTLEMAN of EUROPE
had displayed the rounded symmetry of those calves which
had defied the serried legions of the French and, in their
lighter moments, had captured the wayward fancies of the
fair or mitigated the larshness of a statesman. This was
the chamber where the SAILon KING, bluff but not undig-
nified, had jested with his intimates, had smoothed a frown
from the rugged brow of WELLINGTON or held his own
against the eagle glance of GREY: the chamber where the
great QUEEN, conscious of her august destiny, had conse-
crated to grief such moments as could be spared from the
needs of Empire; the chamber where her son had laboured
for peace and extended the bounds of friendship; the
chamber where a DIsrAELI, repaying scorn with scorn, may
have spread his snares, and a GLADSTONE, overwhelmed by
the torrent of his own eloquence, may have fallen into them.
Nothing was wanting to complete the solemnity of
the spectacle. Outside, the scarlet-coated sentries paced
rigidly on their accustomed rounds, and the populace,
hemmed in by the strong arms and the panting forms of
the constabulary, cheered to the echo its favourites or
exchanged with one another the harmless sallies that give
pleasure to a crowd. Within, the KING himself, his face now
clouded with anxious thought, now lit with hope, gave a
cordial welcome to the more unwonted of the guests he had
summoned to his presence, while busy courtiers filled the
corridors with an importance which lost nothing in weight
ſom being unwarranted by knowledge or experience.
Lackeys in the gorgeous liveries of the most brilliant Court
in Europe were in attendance, ready to minister to those
whose failing strength might necd refreshment, or to
execute with intelligence and despatch the humbler duties
pe, taining to their office.
Nor were the chiefs unworthy of the scene to which they
had been called. There was the Speaker, LowTHER, his
brow beaming with the good-humour which enabled him to
abate pomposity without injuring the feelings even of the
pompous, and to calm with a happy phrase the agitated
waters of debate. There were Asquith, strong in the
affection of his friends, and LLoyd GEORGE, braced to
action by the invectives of his foes. There were LAw and
LANsdow NE, staunch defenders of the citadel in which the
last of the Tories, stern and unbending as ever, had sought
refuge. Waterford had sent John REDMoND, the pride and
champion of a nation, the unwearied vindicator of Ireland's
right to govern herself. Through years of contumely and
depression he had borne aloft her standard, and now, when
her triumph was all but achieved, he was here to watch
over a settlement which all desired, though none hitherto
had been able to bring it about. With him had come
John DILLON, tall, dignified and stately, whose grey hair
and admirable bearing had won the respect and conciliated
the temper of the most fastidious assembly in the world.
Arrayed against, these two, sons of Ireland no less than
they, were CARson and CRAIg; CARson with his saturnine
face and his swift and piercing intelligence, CRA1G of the
burly form and uncompliant humour. Vowed to the
Orange cause, and dwelling fondly on memories of the
Boyne, they denounced with equal severity the religion of
Rome and the political aspirations of the majority of their
fellow-countrymen. Such were the men who were now

THE PROGRESS OF MAN.
(By our Anthropological Expert.)
PROFEssoR KEITH, of the Royal Col-
lege of Surgeons, reporting on the
skeleton of a prehistoric twelve-year-
old boy recently discovered near
Ipswich, pronounces his stature to be
much the same as the average height
of a modern boy of the same age, but
the size of the head is remarkably
large. The professor states that he
and his colleagues are trying to get
hold of people of every period, going as
far back as they can. They will then
be able to differentiate the types that
lived in any period, and check
In that fine spirit of enterprise which
has always characterised The Daily
Lyre, the proprietors of that periodical
have offered a prize of £5,000 for the
most characteristic relic of ancient and
modern British civilization, to be sent
in by October 1. Already several not-
able exhibits have been forwarded for
the competition. Mr. Ronald McLurkin,
of Tain, has submitted portions of the
boiler of an ancient locomotive, appar-
ently used on the Highland Railway in
the time of the Boer War. Dr. Edgar
Hollam, of Brancaster, has sent a fine
specimen of a fossilised Norfolk biffin,
and Miss Sheila Muldooney, of Skib-
Moghul Emperors. Mr. WINSTON
CHURCHILL competes with an essay
which he wrote, while a schoolboy at
Harrow, on the dangers of Democracy;
and Master ANTHONY Asquith has
sent the rough notes of a Lecture on
“The Balliol Manner" which he de-
livered many years ago before a select
audience at Claridge's. The contrast
in form and thought between this crude
essay and his recent lectures on the
mysticism of RABINDRANATH TAGoRE is
quite amazing. We may also briefly
note the MS. version of an early sonnet
by Mr. EDMUND GossE, addressed to
Sir SIDNEY LEE; several safety-pins and
the changes that came over
them. So far, however, there
has been very little change.
Perhaps the most striking
result of Professor KEITH's ap-
peal so far has come from the
Isle of Man, where a magnificent
three-legged skeleton has been
discovered in the Caves of
Bradda. The remains have been
pronounced by Professor Quellin,
the famous Manx anthropologist,
to be those of a man not less
than 175 years of age, whose
facial angle bears so marked a
resemblance to that of Mr.
HALL CAINE as to warrant the
hypothesis that he was one of
the royal ancestors of the emi-
nent novelist. Close to the
skeleton was a long bronze
trumpet, from which Professor
Quellin, after several ineffectual
efforts, ultimately succeeded in
eliciting a deep booming note.
Mr. HALL CAINE, who has taken
the liveliest interest in the
discovery, is at present study-
ing the instrument, and will, it
is hoped, give a recital shortly
in the House of Keys.

a sponge-bag which once be-
longed to CHARLoTTE BRONTÉ
and are now entered for the
competition by Mr. CLEMENT
SHORTER ; and a hot-water
bottle used by S. T. Col.BRIDGE
when he was , writing “The
| Ancient Mariner,” now in
the possession of Sir HERBERT
BEERBohM TREE.
The interesting point that
emerges so far is that while
little change is observable in
the physique, habits and man-
ners of the British, as illustrated
by these relics, up to the last
ten years or so, the development
in every direction, since the
foundation of The Daily Lyre,
has been quite extraordinarily
rapid and pronounced. For in-
| stance, a cast of the head of a
| modern “nut” shows a com-
pactness which compares most
favourably with the overgrown
cranium of the prehistoric boy
reported on by Professor KEITH.
“To-day there are 2,000,000 musk-
rats in Bohemia, and, like rabbits in
the fruitful regions of the province
famous Culbin Sands, undertaken by
the . Forres Antiquarian Institute, have
also resulted in some remarkable finds.
Prominent among these is a complete
set of golf clubs belonging to the Bronze
period. In regard to length the clubs
are very much the same as the average
implements used at the present day,
but the large size of the heads is re-
markable, the niblick weighing nearly
half a hundredweight. It is plausibly
inferred that clubs of this pattern may
also have been used as weapons, as the
dwellers in this district in the Bronze
period are known to have been of a
warlike and tumultuous disposition.
The game is believed to have been
introduced by some Maccabaean settlers,
the ancestors of the clan of Macbeth,
containing the historic announcement
that it had its eye on the Tsar of
RUCSIA. Sir GEORGE ALEXANDER sends
a daguerreotype of himself in knicker-
bockers with side whiskers and mous-
tache, and Mr. BERNARD SHAw the
first interview with himself that he
ever wrote. It appeared in The I’ree-
man's Journal in the “seventies" and
is illustrated with six portraits, in one
of which Mr. SHAw appears in an Eton
suit and a tall hat, “the only one I
ever possessed."
Sir HENRY HowARTH has forwarded
a copy of The Times containing, his
first contribution to that journal, a
letter occupying a column-and-a-half of
small print, on the mammoth as a

ONE of the most appalling scandals
of modern times is the disgraceful
suppression by the Ginger-beer Press
of news relating to the state of affairs
in the Isle of Wight. For some weeks
we have not flinched from filling our
columns with picturesque accounts of
the epoch-making events taking place
there; and yet the Ginger-beer Press
has cruelly put off its readers with the
.# Scantiest details, or else refrained from
any sort of reference. We make our
protest all the more vigorously because
many of those readers have been driven
to read our own journal in preference
to the erroneous and misleading sheets
to which we have referred.
This distressing state of things has
forced us to make the fullest arrange-
ments for a constant stream of news
to be supplied from our branch offices
at Ventnor, Totland Bay, the Needles,
and other points of the Island. We
have despatched a huge staff of world-
famous war correspondents, descriptive
Writers, poets, photographers, Royal
Academy artists,gallopers, commissariat
9fficers, and trained bloodhounds. Field
kitchens, field wireless equipment, and
field glasses are included among their
impedimenta, and no single message
will be printed in our pages that has
not been sent in some other way than
post, telephone and telegraph. Each
member of this army of artists, littéra-
teurs and tacticians possesses a hip
pocket, fully loaded, two pairs of
puttees, a compass and a wrist watch.
Every day scores of women and
children are leaving the Isle of Wight
for the mainland. Gunboats and cruisers
are passing and repassing before its
shores, by order of the Admiralty;
strong, silent men are doggedly pur-
suing the business they have in hand.
In the very heart of the island some of
the flower of the youth of our country
is being trained in the art of naval war-
fare, while the thunders of gun-practice
are heard every hour around the coast.
Yet, search where you will in the Ginger-
bear Press during the last few weeks,
you will find practically no reference to
these things.
We implore our readers, on the
highest patriotic grounds, to inform
the few remaining adherents of the
Ginger-beer Press that if they desire
the Truth it can be found only in our
pages.
We have the pleasure of printing
below the first of the astonishing
articles which have been sent already
from our Expeditionary Staff:-
THE PRELIMINARY CALM.
By Blinton X. Krapt.
The streets of Cowes are bathed in
panied by daintily dressed ladies, walk
hither and thither. The shopkeepers
chat pleasantly. The burly policeman
drowsily pursues his way. Children
shout happily. Surely here is peace,
says the unsuspecting visitor. -
A brown-faced man with a light
beard and a heavy tread approached
us. “It is all right,” said my com-
panion to him; “this gentleman is a
friend.” Then, lowering his voice, he
added: “He came over last night.”
“Beautiful place, Cowes, isn't it?”
said the bronzed man. I noticed that
his hip pocket bulged. Yet none would
have suspected that his conversation
was not of a perfectly ordinary char-
acter.
Entering the most sumptuous hotel
in Cowes we had lunch. There was
nothing sinister about the place except
that the waiters were German. But I
noted signs of understanding between
them and my friend. “I have been
here before,” he explained, with a quick
glance about him.
So life goes on from day to day. We
are waiting, waiting. The little boot-
maker, in his shop, is waiting. The
tailor is waiting. The hotel staffs are
waiting. The passengers on the rail-
way platforms are waiting. On the
surface life is gay and free from care;

MY DEAREST AGATHA,-1 must tell
you about an extraordinary occurrence.
They were all quite respectable people,
indeed most respectable. Perhaps I
ought not to include Mr. Jones. He
is, you know (I mention this in the
strictest confidence, dearest), he is not

James is so absurdly fond of him.
It was my At Home day last week
and quite a lot of people, really nice
people too, came in spite of the heat.
The heat may have had something to
do with it, but I really cannot think
what it was. -
I handed a plate of bread-and-butter
to Miss Niccole. To my surprise she
hesitated a moment and then took the
plate and handed it to me. When I
declined she offered it to Mrs. Fitzroy-
Williams-Adamson. You know, dear,
the extraordinary thing occurred. Mrs.
Fitzroy-Williams-Adamson took the
plate and offered it to Miss Niccole.

Then it was his turn. And so it went
on. Really, it was most extraordinary.
Nothing like it has ever been known
in our family. I really cannot under-
stand it.
Everybody passed the plate, and at
last it came to Mr. Jones. He pointed
at the top piece of bread-and-butter.
Yes, he actually pointed. He then
made the following extraordinary re-
mark: “I say, hasn't this broken loose
from the bread-pudding, what, what?”
Thereupon he pushed it on one side and
took the next slice. I was ashamed
and mortified for such a thing to
happen in my house. Really, it was
most extraordinary.
Mr. Allen, the new curate, came in
just then. He took the top slice, but
I caught him absent-mindedly putting
it in a flower-pot. When he saw me
looking at him he blushed and started
—started eating it, I mean. However,
he left most of it, and when cveryone
was gone I examined it. It was per-
haps a little hardened by the sun, but
otherwise it was quite a nice piece of

it at all. The whole thing was really

MY DEAREST SARAH,--I have just

I’ROBLEMS OF CONDUCT.
(CoNDUCTED BY REGINALD AUGUSTcs
PLANTAG ENET-HARRIs.)
Problem 3.—A. is paying a call. His
hostess offers him bread-and-butter.
He notices that the top piece has
suffered from the heat. What should
Answer adjudged correct.—A. should
politely take the plate from his hostess,
murmuring, “May I offer it to you?”
If she refuses he should offer it to his
nearest neighbour. When the offend-
ing slice has been got rid of in this
way he can help himself to the next
slice and then return the plate to its
OWnel'.
Highly commended.—A. should ex-
plain to his hostess that he has a
peculiar hobby, to wit, collecting slices
of bread-and-butter from the houses of
the great. His collection of Royal
Family slices is unrivalled. Might he
have the pleasure and honour of adding
to his collection this dainty specimen?
He should then reverently fold the
slice in two and place it in his breast-
pocket.
[Our only objection to this is that it
seems a rather greasy thing to do.]
Incorrect answers:–(1) A. should
make a facetious remark, such as,
“Hasn't this escaped from the bread
pudding?” He should then playfully
but firmly push the slice aside and trust
to luck on the next.
(2) A. must out of courtesy to his
hostess accept thankfully whatever she
places before him. Any other course
of conduct would be an affront. It
now however becomes his personal
property and he can adopt whichever
of the following courses is most con-
venient—
(a) Secrete it in a fancy flower-pot
(b) If the dog is a silent eater hold
it behind his back so that the dog
may get it.
NoTE.-If the dog refuses to touch
it, say loudly, “I cannot understand
how any animal can decline such
delightful bread-and-butter.” He can
then openly dispose of it in the grate
or the waste-paper-basket on the
ground that the dog's nose has viti-
ated its freshness.

THE YOUNG OF THE SEA-SERPENT.
WITH the approach of the silly
season one's thoughts turn naturally
to the prospect of stealing into print
and enjoying all the sweets of author-
ship without the reception of a cheque
to vulgarise them. An infinite variety
of topics, our representative gathered
yesterday, is now on the eve of dis-
cussion, and the quill that cannot find
something to say on at least one of
them had better return to its native
goose without delay.
“Mother of Ten," we were informed
by the courteous editor of The Half-
penny Bleater, will as usual open that
journal's discussion, and this year her
thoughts have turned to bathing fatal-

sity for university costume in the case

The Morning Dip will maintain
its reputation for intellectuality with
a spiritual discussion on “Has Life a
Double Meaning?” or “Is Existence
a Joke?”—the exact title has not
yet been decided. “Constant Reader”
has already bought a penny packet of
assorted stationery and charged it to
the office petty cash, and only a really
good murder can prevent the early

To gramophonic discs.

When converts clear the cloth,
He pins an orchid to its place

116 PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 29, 1914.
AN ERROR IN ARCADY.
PEOPLE who know us both have often
expressed a doubt as to whether Charles
or myself is the more absent-minded
and unobservant. I wish to set the
matter at rest once and for all.
We were discussing William's wed-
ding, which had just taken place, ro-
mantically enough, in the very heart of
Herts—one of those quaint little villages
where no sound seems to disturb the
silence of the long summer day but
the gentle bleating of horn to horn and
the murmur of innumerable tyres.
Both of us had been there, and Charles
came round to talk to me about it a
few evenings afterwards.
“I do hope the poor dear fellow will
be happy,” he said, lighting his fifth
match and pulling away vigorously at
an ugly-looking briar.
“It really goes much better with
tobacco in it,” I said, passing him my
pouch. “Why on earth shouldn't
William be happy? It seemed a very
pretty wedding. Did you notice how
the rays of the sun coming through the
window lit up the best man's boots?”
“I daresay, I daresay,” he replied.
“As a matter of fact I couldn't see the
church part of it very well: I came late
and was behind a pillar at the back.”
“Well, it all went beautifully,” I told
him. “Everybody stood up and sat
down in the wrong places as usual, and
the friends of the bride looked with
extreme hauteur at the friends of the
bridegroom, and vice versä, 1 suppose
you went to the reception afterwards.
I never saw you at all except for a
moment on the platform going back.
You must have shaken hands with
the happy pair and examined the
presents?”
“I went to the house,” said Charles.
“I went in a motor-car on a seat that
took two men to hold down, and that
hit me hard when I tried to stand up.
I caught a glimpse of William, but I
couldn't find the room where the pre-
sents were set out, so I went through
almost at once into the garden, where
the feasting was going on. Do tell me
about the gifts. Was my little pepper-
castor hung on the line?”
“I didn't notice that,” I said, “but
my butter-dish was doing itself proud.
It had sneaked up to a magnificent
toast-rack with stabling accommodation
for about eight pieces, given by some-
body with a title. ...And you ought to
have seen the fish-slices. The fish-slices
were gorgeous. I expect William will
spend a great part of his married life in
slicing fish. It will be a great change
from golf-balls. But I think you really
ought to have said a few hearty and
“That's just it,” replied Charles in a
mournful voice. “I did. I talked to
the bride.”
“Hang it, so did I | " I exclaimed
rather indignantly. “Directly I got in
I went up to William and her and said
to her, “How glad you must be it's all
over!’ and then quite suddenly it struck
me that that wasn't really the best
thing to say in the circumstances, so I
blushed and trod on William's toe and
passed on. What did you do in the
garden?”
“Well, I wandered about on the lawn
where there were lots and lots of peo-
ple,” said Charles. “I didn't seem to
meet anyone I knew, but the flower-
beds were most beautifully kept. I have
seldom seen such a display of cress
sandwiches and champagne. After a
bit I strolled down through the shrub-
berries, went through a little wooden
gate and found myself amongst the
raspberry canes. About a quarter of
an hour later, after a little fruity re-
freshment, whom should I meet walk-
ing along a quiet shady path but the
bride herself, all alone.”
“Stealing away to get one last rasp-
berry at the dear old home,” I said.
“How romantic : What did you do?
Hide 2 ”
“No,” answered Charles bitterly.
“I only wish I had. I felt that now or
never was the time. I went straight
up to her, and, feeling that to talk about
the weather or the theatres on such an
occasion would be rather footling, in
spite of the fact that we'd never been
introduced, I plunged straight into it.
‘You’ve never seen me before in your
life,' I said earnestly, “because you
haven't got eyes in the back of your
head, and I’ve never seen you because
I can't look through stone. What's
more, I'm only a little silver pepper-
castor, an insignificant item in your
cruet. But I must tell you how de-
lighted I am to have a chance of speak-
ing to you.'”
“What did she say to that 2 " I asked.
“Well, you'd never believe it, but the
girl looked quite nervous and frightened,
and positively began to walk away from
me. I supposed I'd begun on the
wrong tack, so I hurried after her and
started again. “Marriage is a state full
of the most serious responsibilities,' I
said, “but one glance at you shows me
that you are fully competent to shoulder
them all.’”
“That sounds as if you thought she
looked a trifle statuesque,” I said. “Did
she seem annoyed 2"
“Worse,” replied Charles. “She
hurried on again without speaking a
word. ‘Stop,' I cried, ‘stop ! I am a
friend of the fairy prince;’ and just
and she gave a little shriek and actually
ran away, leaving me standing where I
was. I was so ashamed and exhausted
that I slunk back through the little
gate and had some more raspberries.
When I had partially recovered I re-
turned to the upper part of the garden
again, had two cups of tea in the big
tent, and made my way back to the
station, where I saw you. If you
hadn't got into another carriage I
should have told you about it at the
time.” -
“Then you never saw them going
away at all 2 " I said.
“No,” replied Charles; “did you?”
“Did I not ?” said I. “You wouldn't
believe the amount of rice I started
their married life with. About two |
milk puddings' worth, I should say.
And so you are not quite satisfied with
William's choice 2''
“Well, she seems to me to be rather
an unresponsive and timid sort of per-
son,” said Charles. “Not tactful, nor
likely to make what the newspapers
call a charming hostess. I should have
liked dear William to marry someone
who would be a social success.” |
I smoked for some time in silence,
and then I had an idea.
“How was the bride dressed when
you saw her, Charles?” I asked.
“Do I know how women are dressed?
She was in white, of course, and hadn't ||
a hat on.” |
“But she had a train and a veil, I |
suppose. She hadn't a short skirt by |
any chance?” .
“Goodness, how do I know?” he
replied. “I didn't notice all that. Why
do you ask?”
“Well, you only saw her once, you ||
see,” I said, “and you went through
that little gate at the bottom of the
garden, didn't you?” s
“I did,” said Charles. “What's that ||
got to do with it?”
“Nothing, nothing. Only I know

SOCIETY NOTES.
WE ARE softny to HEAR THAT, THROUGH THE INCONSIDERATE Action of THE ANTIQUATED Propr.ſ. who still TAKE DOGs to THE
PARK, THE PET RAT of LADY PIPER HAD A NARRow ESCAPE FROM WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS AccIDENT.
THE FOILING OF “THE BLARE.”
(Suggested to a slightly Hibernian brain by the recent ebul-
lition of generosity on the part of the popular press,
which insures its readers against holiday accidents
whilst boating and bathing.)
WHEN I bolt from this city of vapour
To bite the salubrious breeze,
Do you know why I gambol and caper
And plunge with a shout in the seas
Twice the lad that I was
For a lark? It's because
I subscribe to that bountiful paper,
The Blare, if you please.
For I know that if currents are shifty,
If cramp should arrive unaware,
I shall die, but my end will be thrifty,
And my host (being also my heir)
Will be amply consoled
By the thought of the gold
(Which amounts to two hundred and fifty)
He'll get from The Blare.
“Pray take from your forehead those creases,”
I cry to my friend on the yacht,
“I admit that the mainsail's in pieces
But remember that if
We go ponk on that cliff
It's The Blare will be paying your nieces
A nice little pot.”
But whatever may crash into cruisers
Or wherries when I am afloat,
When the waves have destroyed me like bruisers,
I call on my country to note,
If The Blare should pretend,
When I’ve passed to my end,
I was one of its constant perusers,
It lies in its throat.
To my tenantless rooms in the City
The rags have been sent, and it’s there
Tbat I'll burn them unopened and gritty
Or, if (and it's little I care)
I am whelmed in the wave,
I shall laugh from my grave
At the blow that I've dealt the banditti
Who publish The Blare. EvoB.

We who travel up together each
morning by this train are pretty well
agreed about —.
“Don’t mention that man to me!”
cried Ferguson. “He’s absolutely the
biggest liar on earth. I can't imagine
how he faces the world as he does after
having been exposed so many times,
You'd think he would want to crawl
away into a hole somewhere. He can't
have the least sense of shame.” .
“Pardon me," interrupted the burly
stranger seated in the corner. “Pardon
me; there is reason why he should. It
is not his fault if he is addicted to
inexactitude. He was predestined to it.
It is the irresistible influence of the day
on which he was born. Every man
born on this day must inevitably grow
up to be a liar; it is his fate, from
which there can be no escape.”
“Oh, come!” protested Ferguson.
“That sounds rather far-fetched, you
know, for these days.”
“My dear Sir," retorted the other,
brushing up his moustache aggressively
and glaring at Ferguson, “I happen to
be President of the Society for the
Investigation of Natal Day Influences
upon Character, so I presume I may
claim to know what I am talking
about.” -
So truculent was his demeanour that
nobody ventured to speak.
“My Society,” he continued after a
pause, “has conducted its researches
over a period of many years. I am
going to give you just a few examples
out of thousands we have collected.
Let us take a significant date, Feb-
ruary 29th. A man born on that day
is a coward. It is inevitable. Pusil-
lanimity is born in him and can never
be eradicated.
“We had before us a month or two
ago the case of a gentleman living in
a country town—a quiet, shy, studious
recluse—born on this fatal day. By
some mischance he happened to pick
up a journal in which was an article on
the Government by Mr. ARNOLD WHITE.
He read it. He was so terrified that
he expired from heart failure. That
sounds to you incredible, but real life
is often incredible. That is one of the
discoveries of our Society.
“I will give you a more remarkable
instance still. A well-to-do gentleman
with the same birthday, whose case we
have recorded in our journals, is now,
since boyhood, was an anarchist. After
this he was afraid to have any further
dealings with the man, while, on the
other hand, he lacked sufficient courage
to face the ordeal of being fitted by
a fresh tailor. For some time he used
to sit up at night and secretly sew
patches into his trousers. Naturally
this could not go on for ever, and at
last, when his garments were dropping
to pieces, he had to take to his bed. . . .
You smile, Sir. Perhaps you think I
am exaggerating?”
His eyes flashed and his voice vibrated
with such anger that I jumped six
inches out of my seat.
“Not at all—not at all,” I stammered.
“Only it occurred to me—er—that he
might have—er—b-bought them ready-
made.” -
“Your knowledge of human nature
must be singularly slight,” replied the
other icily, “if you imagine that a man
without sufficient courage to be fitted
by a tailor would be brave enough to
wear ready-made clothes.”
“It seems to me, Sir,” said Dean,
coming to the rescue, “that your two
instances prove little, if anything,
They may be mere coincidence.”
The stranger leaned forward, frowned
heavily and wagged his forefinger at
Dean, who wilted visibly.
“The Society for the Investigation of
Natal Day Influences upon Character,”
he said, “does not seek to build up a
theory upon isolated and arbitrarily
selected examples. We deal with the
subject scientifically. To continue
with this date, February 29th. After
several cases similar to those I have
recounted had come to our notice, we
made out a list of two hundred and
fifty men born on this day. To each
of them we sent a representative to
ask for a subscription to the Society.
Though they had never heard of it
before, every one of those two hundred
and fifty was easily intimidated into
subscribing. -
“Now let us consider another date—
March 3rd. Several striking instances
had led us to suspect that a person
born on March 3rd comes into the
world with an ineradicable passion for
gambling. I will give you just one of
these. A gentleman one day imagined
he was seriously ill and called in a
doctor. The latter laughed at his fears
and offered to bet him that he would
live to be seventy. The temptation was
too great. The gambler closed with the
offer, and on the eve of his seventieth
birthday drowned himself.”
At this point Empson sniggered
lapse by coughing noisily. The other
waited patiently till he had finished.
“Perhaps you wish to say something,
Sir," he remarked coldly.
“N-no,” said I’mpson.
teresting.” -
The President made a gesture which
indicated that Empson was beneath
contempt and renewed his discourse.
“Continuing the same method of

of nearly four hundred persons born on
March 3rd. To each of these we sent
particulars of a Derby Sweepstake.
Every one of them, gentlemen, applied
for a ticket by return of post.” -
There was an impressive pause. The
President looked round the carriage
defiantly as if challenging suspicion.
“One of our tests with regard to
to-day's date—liars' day,” he continued
presently, “was rather amusing. We
hired a room in the City for a week and
sent out over three hundred letters to
persons born on that day. Our note-
paper was headed, “Short, Stay and
Hoppett, Solicitors,' and the letters were
in identical terms. They said that we
had been endeavouring for some time to
trace the relatives of one Davy Jones,
who, after acquiring a large fortune in
Australia, i. died intestate, and we
had that morning been given to under-
stand that the gentleman with whom
we were corresponding was a nephew
of the deceased, etc., etc. You guess
what happened. Every one of them
without erception claimed as his uncle
this millionaire who never eacisted.”
The train began to slow down, and
the President rose to his feet.
“I get out here,” he said. “I'm
sorry. " I should like to have discussed
the subject further. You, Sir"—he
pointed threateningly at Ferguson—
“will doubtless in future refrain from
blaming Mr. for a failing for
which, as you see, he is in no way
responsible.”
Ferguson quaked and said nothing.
The President brushed up his mous-
tache still higher and looked round in
triumph. All of us were completely
cowed—all of us, except little Windsor.
“Just a moment, Sir,” said the latter
gently. “Before you leave us will you
kindly accept this?” -
He took out his tie-pin and laid it in
the other's hand.
For the first time the burly one's
confidence deserted him. He reddened
slightly and looked embarrassed.
“It’s very kind of you,” he said, “but

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THREE numbers of The South Polar Times were brought
out at Cape Evans, the winter quarters of Captain Scott,
during 1911. Mr. APSLEY CHERRy-GARRARD, the editor,
has now presented them to a wider circle under the auspices
of SMITH, ELDER, hoping that they will prove “a source of
interest and pleasure to the friends of the expedition.”
He need have no fears. Of course a paper produced under
such conditions is in its nature esoteric, and many of its
jokes are lost if you “don’t know Jimson.” But if you have
previously read Scott's Last Expedition then you will
'know Jimson"; you will feel that every man at Cape
Evans in 1911 was a personal friend of yours, and you will
be delighted with this facsimile reproduction of the paper
which delighted them. Personally I cannot read or see too

know of “BILL" WILSON, the more I understand that he
was of the very salt of the earth—a man to love whom was
indeed a liberal education, and to be loved by whom was
a passport to the little company of the elect.
When John Barleycorn (MILLS AND Boon) came my way,
I noticed that the publishers had shown a reticence, unusual
in these days, on the outside paper cover; they didn't say
a word as to the quality or character of the contents.
They had three good reasons: first, given the name of JAck
LoNDoN, there was no need of further advertisement or lure;
second, if they had started describing the book they would
have been unable to say with strict truth that it was or
was not a novel, for it isn't and it is; third, and best, they
couldn't, as honest men, have avoided mentioning that it
is in a way a sermon on alcoholism, and that, being said,
might have acted as a deterrent, unless they had explained
(as they wouldn't have had room to do) how and why, when
they said “sermon,” they didn't really mean “sermon.”
So they lay low and said nothing, and I almost wish I had
done the same, for no one who has the lightest interest,
practical or theoretical, in John Barleycorn ought to be

have been first drunk at the age of five, again at the age of

Sir RoPERT Lorimen has been ap-
pointed architect for the restoration of
Whitekirk church, East Lothian, which
was burnt down by Suffragettes last
February. There is a feeling among the
militants that, since it is owing to the
exertions of women that the work has
to be done, it ought to have been given
to a woman architect.
Two Suffragettes who were charged,
last week, at Bow Street with obstruct-
ing the police, refused to give their
ages. Presumably the information
would have shown that they were old
enough to know better.
A committee of the Metropolitan
Water Board reports that Thames
Water is purified at least 1,000 times

as if there may, after all, be something
in the complaints which reach the
Board from time to time as to its water
being absolutely flavourless.
The London Fire Brigade Committee
has decided to ignore a demand from
the Corporation Workers' Union for
the reinstatement of a fireman who

“Do you notice anything particularly queer about this
house, Charles,” I asked him, “now that Araminta has
been forced to fly from it?”
(Araminta had gone home to visit her parents, not so
much, as I explained to Charles, because she was tired of
living with me as because I had invited him to come on
a visit. She was to return on the following day after a
fortnight's absence, and I had promised faithfully to evict
him before she came).
“Except,” said Charles, “that it is usual to offer one's
guests the most comfortable arm-chair in the messuage and
not to eat all the fattest strawberries oneself, I can't say
that I do; ” and he fluffed a second mashie pitch with his
cigar ash well short of the drawing-room fender.
“You don't,” I insisted, “remark any unusual hiatus in
the household arrangements—anything that obviously
betrays the absence of the feminine touch? I suppose you
know what this is 2" and I took from the mantelpiece a

be a very garden of fragrant and luscious blooms. Instead

Araminta went away she flung over her shoulder a parasol
and a Parthian taunt. She said, ‘I'm certain there’ll be
no flowers in the house while I'm away,’ and now it seems
she was jolly well right.”
“Why ever can't the servants attend to the flowers?”
said Charles lazily. “They seem to be fairly competent
people. There were four match-boxes and The Return of
Sherlock Holmes in my bedroom.”
“There you touch one of the deeper mysteries,” I
explained to him. “Probably in the most expensive and
luxurious mansions they have a flower-maid. A kind of
Persephone who comes up from the underworld with her
arms full of gerania and calceolarias. ‘Housemaid,' she
would put it in the advertisements, “upper (where man-

week's-end to week's-end. But with Jane it is different.
Jane has her limitations. She comprehends match-boxes
and detective fiction, but Araminta does the flowers.”
“Well, what do you want me to do about it?” said
Charles, bunkering his cigar-stump badly to the right of
the coal-scuttle.
“I want you to help me,” I told him, “because I shan't
have time to attend to the matter myself. When I go out
to-morrow I want you, before you leave, to fill all the
vases all over the house. Pink roses will be the best, I
think, and you can buy them at that little flowermonger's
across the road.”
“But there are pink roses in the garden,” he objected.
“Only a kind of double dog-rose,” I told him. “We
never allow the dog-roses in the house: they haven't been
properly trained. Besides you would certainly pick all the
puppies and scratch yourself to death. There's no dog-rose
without its tooth. You want the big ones that are grown
exckusively on short stalks without any roots. And Ara-
minta will never know that they haven't been there for
several days at least.”
“All right,” said Charles, “I’ll tackle the flower-smith
for you.”
When I came home on the following evening, before
going upstairs, I peeped timidly into the dining-room and
found to my delight that Charles had been as good as his
word. All the vases had burst as though by a miracle
into radiant blossom. Taking courage I went up to the
drawing-room, found Araminta and saluted her, and then
looked round with a smirk of conscious self-satisfaction.
Charles had chosen pink carnations for the drawing-room,
and the place was as starry as the final chapter of a
feuilleton.

MY HARDY ANNUAL.
1 MET him first three summers ago
when he arrived from Baltimore with
a letter of introduction from a mutual
American friend. He was a tall thin
clean-shaven man, a typical American
of the inquiring rather than com-
manding type—and not a millionaire,
not indeed rich at all, and rather ner-
vous among waiters and wine lists:
preferring a boarding-house in Bays-
water to a caravanserai (as the news-
paper men always call the big hotels).
He had culture and desired more, and
one way of getting it (one way, I mean,
of making sure that it should be gotten)
was to talk with every one he met.
This I believe is an American custom.
Anyway, he arrived with his letter
of introduction, and I did –--
what I could for him—
asked him to lunch, told
him about picture gal-
leries, adjured him not to
see this play and that,
and mentioned a few new
books. Our surest
common ground being
American men of letters,
we discussed them. We
agreed that the early
death of FRANK Norris
was a blow; that GEORGE |
W. CABLE had style ;
that JoHN Fox, Junior,
could tell a good story,
but Owen Wisten a
better. My friend inter-
ested me greatly by
stating that he had been
on intimate terms with
that great man, MARK
TwAIN, and wondered if – --
I had ever heard the story (which he
used to tell against himself) of the
visitor to his house who, after a very
delightful stay, during which the
humorist had been at the top of his
form, asked his daughter if her father
was always like that? “Only when
we have company,” she replied.
The next year my American friend
turned up again, sending a letter in
advance to say that he would be at his
old address in Bayswater at a certain
date, and again I wrote asking him to
lunch with me, as before. He was
exactly the same, even to his clothes,
and we talked of American writers in
what I remembered to be the identical
terms of the previous year. This is one
of the disadvantages of annual meet-
ings; there is no advance. The familiar
ground included our decision, reinforced,
that Mrs. WHART.on was a swell, but
rather on the bitter side; that it was a
pity that MARY WILKINs had given up

for our single tete-à-téte. He looked, he
said, on a year as wasted, unless a part
of it was spent in London and Paris.
He was exactly as he had been ; his
voice had the same slow mirthlessness
and it uttered the same flat definitive
comments. He could not be surprised
or shocked or amused. He had taken
the world's measure and was now
chiefly occupied in adding to his col-
lection of fine men and lovely-minded
women. I made an effort to get the
conversation to other than American
literary personages, but it was useless.

ARMAGEDDON.
THE conversation had turned, as it
always does in the smoking-rooms of
golf clubs, to the state of poor old
England, and Porkins had summed the
matter up. He had marched round in
ninety-seven that morning, followed by
a small child with an umbrella and an
arsenal of weapons, and he felt in form
with himself.
“What England wants,” he said,
leaning back and puffing at his cigar,
—“what England wants is a war.
(Another whisky and soda, -waiter.)
We're getting flabby. All this pamper-
ing of the poor is playing the very deuce
with the country. A bit of a scrap
with a foreign power would do us all
the good in the world.” He disposed
of his whisky at a draught. “We're
flabby,” he repeated. “The lower
classes seem to have no sense of dis-
cipline nowadays. We want a war to
brace us up.” **
It is well understood in Olympus
that Porkins must not be disappointed.
What will happen to him in the next
world. I do not know, but it will be
something extremely humorous; in this
world, however, he is to have all that
he wants. Accordingly the gods got to
work. - - -
In the little village of Ospovat, which
is in the south-eastern corner of Ruri-
tania, there lived a maiden called Maria
Strultz, who was engaged to marry
Captain Tomsk.
“I fancy,” said one of the gods,
“that it might be rather funny if Maria
jilted the Captain. I have an idea that
it would please Porkins.”
“Whatever has Maria—” began a
very young god, but he was immedi-
ately suppressed.
“Really,” said the other, “I should
have thought it was sufficiently obvious.
You know, what these mortals are.”
He looked round to them all. “Is it
agreed then 2"
It was agreed.
So Maria Strultz jilted the Captain.
Now this, as you may imagine,
annoyed Captain Tomsk. He com-
manded a frontier fort on the boundary
between Ruritania and Essenland, and
his chief amusement in a dull life was
to play cards with the Essenland
captain, who commanded the fort on
the other side of the river. When
Maria's letter came he felt that the
only thing to do was to drown him-
self; on second thoughts he decided
to drown his sorrows first. He did
this so successfully that at the end
of the evening he was convinced
that it was not Maria who had jilted
him, but the Essenland captain who
had jilted Maria; whereupon he rowed
across the river and poured his revolver
into the Essenland flag which was fly-
ing over the fort. Maria thus revenged,
he went home to bed, and woke next
morning with a bad headache.
(“Now we're off,” said the gods in
Olympus.)
In Diedeldorf, the capital of Essen-
land, the leader-writers proceeded to
remove their coats.
“The blood of every true Essen-
lander,” said the leader-writer of the
Diedeldorf Patriot, after sending out
for another pot of beer, “will boil when
it hears of this fresh insult to our be-
loved flag, an insult which can only be
wiped out with blood.” Then seeing
that he had two “bloods” in one
sentence, he crossed the second one
out, substituted “the sword,” and
lit a fresh cigarette. “For years
Essenland has writhed under the pro-
vocations of Ruritania, but has pre-
served a dignified silence; this last
insult is more than flesh and blood
can stand.” Another “blood" had
got in, but it was a new sentence
and he thought it might be allowed to
remain. “We shall not be accused of
exaggeration if we say that Essenland
would lose, and rightly lose, her prestige
in the eyes of Europe if she let this
affront pass unnoticed. In a day she
would sink from a first-rate to a fifth-
rate power.” But he didn't say how.
The Chancellor of Essenland, in a
speech gravely applauded by both sides
of the House, announced the steps he
had taken. An ultimatum had been
sent to Ruritania demanding an apology,
an indemnity of a hundred thousand
marks, and the public degradation of
Captain Tomsk, whose epaulettes were
to be torn off by the Commander-in-
Chief of the Essenland Army in the
presence of a full corps of cinemato-
graph artists. Failing this, war would
be declared.
Ruritania offered the apology, the
indemnity, and the public degradation
of Captain Tomsk, but urged that this
last ceremony would be better per-
formed by the Commander-in-Chief of
the Ruritanian Army; otherwise Ruri-
tania might as well cease to be a
sovereign state, for she would lose her
prestige in the eyes of Europe.
There was only one possible reply to
this, and Essenland made it. She in-
vaded Ruritania.
(“Aren't they wonderful ?” said the
gods in Olympus to each other.
“But haven't you made a mistake 2"
asked the very young god. “Porkins
lives in England, not Essenland.”
“Wait a moment,” said the others.)
+.
In the capital of Borovia the leader.
writer of the Borovian Patriot got to
work. “How does Borovia stand 2 ”
he asked. “If Essenland occupies
Ruritania, can any thinking man in
Borovia feel safe with the enemy at his
gates?” (The Borovian peasant, earning
five marks a week, would have felt
no less safe than usual, but then he
could hardly be described as a thinking
man.) “It is vital to the prestige of
Borovia that the integrity of Ruritania
should be preserved. Otherwise we
may resign ourselves at once to the
prospect of becoming a fifth-rate power
in the eyes of Europe.” And in a
speech, gravely applauded by all parties,
the Borovian Chancellor said the same
thing. So the Imperial Army was
mobilized and, amidst a wonderful
display of patriotic enthusiasm by
those who were remaining behind,
the Borovian troops marched to the
front. . . .
(“And there you are,” said the gods
in Olympus. . . .
“But even now—” began the very
!young god doubtfully.
“Silly, isn't Felicia the ally of
Essenland ; isn't Marksland the ally
of Borovia ; isn't England the ally of
the ally of the ally of the Country
which holds the balance of power be-
tween Marksland and Felicia 3 ''
“But if any of them thought the
whole thing stupid or unjust or—"
“Their prestige,” said the gods
gravely, trying not to laugh.
“Oh, I see,” said the very young god.)
And when a year later the hundred-
thousanth English mother woke up to
read that her boy had been shot; I am
afraid she shed foolish tears and
thought that the world had come to an
end. - -
Poor short-sighted creature! She
didn't realise that Porkins, who had
marched round in ninety-six the day
before, was now thoroughly braced up;

thoughtfully stroking his crampons,

entered.

the sardines and dried plums which

diet for mountaineers. They looked

him with the easy camaraderie of the

Gratefully relieving himself of his
rope, ice-axe, Baedeker, goggles, cork-
screw, crampons and other impedi-
menta of the expert Alpinist, Ralph
seated himself beside the girl.
“You look tired,” she said sympa-
thetically.
I.—OUTSIDE THE LAw.
“Yes,” he replied, picking up a sar-
dine by its tail and dropping it into
his mouth with the ease of one long
accustomed to mountain huts. “Yes,
I've just satisfied a long-cherished
ambition by doing the Matterhorn and
the Jungfrau in the same day without
guides.”
There was an instant chorus of ad-
miration. The three guides rose to
their feet and gazed at the newcomer
in astonishment.
“Jawohl 1 Auf wiedersehen tº they
said warmly.
There is no body of men in the
world so free from-petty jealousy as
the Swiss guides.
“It is nothing,” said Ralph lightly.
“What are your plans for to-morrow?
I rather thought of taking things
easily myself and doing the Wetter-
horn. I wondered——”
“I’m sure we should be delighted
to join you,” said the girl, “if you
could consent to be accompanied by
such undistinguished climbers. Let me
introduce ourselves. This is my cousin,
Sir Ernest Scrivener. This is my
brother, Lord Tamerton. I am Mar-
garet Tamerton.”
“Lady Margaret Tamerton " " cried
Ralph in amazement. “Little Madge!
Don't you remember me—Ralph Won-
derson, your playmate as a child?”
“Ralph '" exclaimed Lady Margaret.
“Oh, of course ! And I haven't seen
you since you whitewashed all the
school.”
Several hours later Lady Margaret
stood with Ralph on the terrace out-

side the hut. Her eyes plunged into

the awful abyss at their feet, swept
along the moonlit valley thousands and
thousands of feet below them, and
fastened themselves upon the sinister
crags of the Lyskamm and the stu-
pendous dome of Mont Blanc. A lump
came into her throat.
“I don't know why," she said softly,
“but I have a presentiment of evil. Is
the Wetterhorn very dangerous?”
Ralph laughed lightly. “A child
could climb it blindfolded in midwin-
ter,” he said. “Trust yourself to me,
little Madge, to-morrow and—and—"
“For ever!” added Margaret almost
inaudibly as they went into the hut
together.
Mingled happiness and foreboding
strangely disturbed her breast, and she
sighed as she trod heavily on the face
of one of the guides in climbing to her
shelf. She heard his low sleepy mur-
mur of apology as she drew her straw
about her. There is no more courteous
body of men in the world than the
Swiss guides.
Next morning, after a hasty toilet
with a handful of snow, the party set
off shortly before sunrise. Ralph by
general consent assumed the leader-
ship. Taking careful soundings with
his ice-axe and using his crampons
with almost uncanny certitude, he
guided his companions through a
moraine and debouched on to a tre-
mendous glacier.
As he turned to survey those behind
them he perceived for the first time a
scar under the left ear of Sir Ernest
Scrivener. -
“Teufel !" he exclaimed under his
breath. “It is hel Moorsdyke! My
mortal enemy "

But his meditations were interrupted
by the stern nature of the work before

séracs. The vibration of a whisper
might send them crashing down upon
the party.
Placing one hand on his lips as a
warning for silence, he dexterously cut

was slow and nerve-racking. Every step

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MNEMONICS.
For reasons of economy we get all
our household requisites from Mogg-
ridge's Stores in the Tottenham Court
Road, where we have a deposit account.
Joan once worked out that by shopping
in this manner we saved ninepence-
halfpenny every time we spent one
pound four and fivepence (her arith-
metic cannot cope with percentages),
besides having our goods delivered at
the door by a motor van. This is a
distinct score off our neighbours, who
have to be content with theirs being
brought round by a boy on a kind of
three-wheeled Black-Maria.
We are not on the telephone at
home, so it is my part of the arrange-
ment to ring up Moggridge's when I
arrive at my office, and order what we
want; that is, whenever I remember.
But unfortunately I own the most
impossible of head-pieces. It's all
right to look at from the outside, but
inside the valves leak, or else the taps
run. Consequently it generally ends
in Joan's writing a note when I return
home in the evening. Thus I was not
altogether surprised when, one morning
after breakfast, Joan asked me to repeat
her orders. I did so. “That's not
what I said ' '.' cried Joan. “That's
only what you thought I said. I did
not even mention smoked salmon.
Now listen while I tell you again; or,
better still, write it down on a piece of
paper.” -
“That's no good,” I said. “I
always lose the paper. Iłut go on
with the list; I’ve got a very good
idea.”
“Two pounds of Mocha coffee,” she
began.
I picked up two coffee beans from
the tray—Joan self-grinds and self-
makes the coffee every morning—and
placed them amongst the loose change
in my trouser pocket.
“Fourteen pounds of best loaf sugar,”
she went on.
I drew my handkerchief from my
sleeve, tied a small lump of sugar in a
corner of it, and then placed it inside
my hat.
“Why put it in your hat?” asked
Joan.
“Because,” I answered, “I may not
have occasion to draw my handkerchief
from its usual place, whereas I always
have to take my hat off.”
“How will you remember the quan-
tity?”
“Well, fourteen pounds make one
stone, don't they? Before I remember
the hard thing is a piece of sugar I
shall think it's a stone.”
Joan sniffed contemptuously.

that I left for resetting. The estimate
they promised has not come, and be-
sides there's the x -
“Hold on a minute "I cried. “Just
tie a piece of cotton round my married
finger.”
She did so. Then she went on :
“The drawing-room clock should
have been sent home, cleaned, last
Friday. They haven't sent it.”
“Perhaps they expected it to run
down,” I suggested.
Joan bore up wonderfully, and merely
said, “Well—do something. Put the
sardines in your pocket-book, or the
marmalade in your gloves.”
“Those,” I said, “are not, strictly
speaking, mnemonics for sending home
cleaned clocks. They would be all
right for a picnic tea-basket, but not
for the thing in question. Everything
I have done up to the present is sug-
gestive of what I have to remember,”
and I turned my watch round in my
pocket so that it faced outwards.
“I see,” said Joan. “Now, what's
the cotton round your finger for?”
“Smoked sa—, that is to say, coff—,
I mean the estimate for your ring,” I
answered. “Is there anything else?”
“Another box of stationery like the
last—the crinkly paper, you know.
They've got our die.”
I tore a strip from the newspaper,
crinkled it carefully and put it away in
my cigarette-case. A minute later I
was on my way to the railway-station.
A keen head - wind was blowing,
causing my eyes to water and the tears
to flow unbidden. I explored my sleeve
for my handkerchief. It was not there.
I could not possibly go to town without
one, so I hastened home again. Joan
was at the window as 1 ran up.
“What is it 2 " she cried.
“My handkerchief!” I gasped. “I’ve
forgotten * *
“Fourteen pounds of best loaf sugar!”
called out Joan. “It's in your hat.”
As I hurried once more in the direc-
tion of the station I withdrew the
handkerchief from my hat and wiped
my streaming eyes. The operation
over, I placed the handkerchief in my
sleeve. I heard the whistle of a train
in the distance and instinctively took
out my watch. It was right-about-face
in my pocket, and I lost a good half-
second in getting it into the correct
position for time-telling. It was nine-
seventeen. I had just one minute in
which to do the quarter-mile; but my
forte is the egg-and-spoon race, and I
missed the train handsomely. -
There was an interval of twenty
minutes before the next one was due,
so I thought I would have a cigarette.
fluttered to the ground. I picked it up
and glanced at it. On one side I read
that “ . . . knocked out Submarine
Snooks in the ninth round after a
hotly - contested . . . .” while on the
other side I saw that “ . . . condition
offers the gravest anxiety to his numer-
ous friends and . . . .” I threw the
paper away, for it did not interest me,
and walked up to the bookstall to
select a magazine. I had to remove
my left glove in order to get at my
money, and in pulling it off I noticed
a shred of cotton come away with it.
This meant an inside seam gone some-
where; and they were new gloves, too.
I threw a coin to the paper-boy, and
two small round objects like boot-
buttons rolled on to the platform.
Shortly afterwards the train strolled up.
At the office I was so busy all day,
arranging about the shipment of a
steam-crane to Siam (I am a com-
mission-agent), that it was not until I
was seated in the train, going home in
the evening, that I vaguely remembered
that I had forgotten something. I
grew more and more uneasy, and, with
the idea of distracting my thoughts
from an unpleasant channel, I picked
up an evening paper from underneath
the opposite seat. At some quite recent
period it had obviously contained
nourishment of an oleaginous nature,
but, though soiled, it was still legible.
The very first paragraph which I read
served to remind me of Joan's forgotten
orders; but it brought me, nevertheless,
an unholy joy, for it ran : “The funeral
of the late Mr. Jeremiah Moggridge,
founder and managing director of the
mammoth stores which bear his name,
took place this afternoon. As a mark
of respect the premises were closed for
business throughout the day.”
So it would have been futile to ring
them up in any case. I was saved'
On reaching home the first thing
Joan said to me was— - -
“Did you order those things from
Moggridge's 2"
I didn't say anything. I merely
handed her the evening paper and
indicated the saving clause. Joan read
it through. Then she said—
“Yes, I thought you'd mess it all up
in spite of your ichneumonics, or what-
ever you call them; and so after lunch
I went to the call-office and ordered the
things myself.”
“But Moggridge's was closed—didn't
you read?”
“Yes,” replied Joan; “but, next time
you forget, don't try to establish an
alibi with yesterday's evening paper.”
Our private telephone will be fixed
by next week. I forget how much
“Then there's my ring,” she con-
Joan reckons we shall save by it.

138 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MY GIRL CADD1E.
As a matter of fact she was my
gardener's chauffeur-son's girl. The
junior parent having been living chiefly
on my garden or in my kitchen, and
now being at the end of his resources,
it was suggested that I should give his
Amy a job. The proposal came from
my wife, who had been victualling
Amy's mother and Amy's baby sister
for some weeks. An illuminating cor-
respondence in the Press had done the
rest.
For her first appointment at the tee
Amy was nearly twenty minutes late,
and when she arrived it was in a mauve
skirt, green stockings, an ochre sport-
ing coat and a hat which had once
been my wife's. Seen against the
background of the native boy caddies,
Amy might have been described as
picturesque. -
“Mother says,” said Amy, as we
introduced ourselves—“Mother says
she's sorry you should be kep', but
baby's used to going off, me rocking
'im, and she was that busy, it being the
day what she mostly washes.”
“Very well, Amy,” I said, realising
the situation, “we must do better next
time. The gentleman I was to play
would not wait; but perhaps, if we just
went round together, you could get an
idea of your—your duties.”
Amy accepted my suggestion and my
bag of clubs with an abstracted sniff.
She seemed to be more closely engaged
in retorting by manual signals to the
distant provocations of her male rivals.
“Now, Amy,” I reminded her gently,
“you must learn how to make a tee.”
Amy turned reluctantly and stared
over my bent back at the Miss Gal.
braiths, who were just starting for the
ladies' course.
“First of all,” I began more firmly,
“you take a pinch of sand from this
box–so.” Tee-making is not my forte,
and I was painfully conscious that I
worked under the critical gaze of fully
twenty expert eyes. -
“If you please,” said Amy in a
brighter mood, “mother says I'll want
some things to clean up the sticks
with.”
I rose from my knees with a cricked
back, but I had my Purple Spot neatly
balanced on a really creditable mound.
“We shall come to that presently,
Amy,” I explained. “When I have
finished playing you can take the clubs
and make them nice and bright with
emery-paper."
Amy did not take this proposal en-
couragingly.
“Mother says I should want some
turps," she informed me, “and brickdus'
the way Jimmy Baines and the rest of
'em does it. Mother says the sticks
should be cleaned proper, as they
oughter be. She says she'd 'ave give
me the things, only she ain't got any,
and I was to ask if it was convenience
to you to spare me the money to go to
the village and get 'em. Then she'd
show me 'ow."
I had discovered my driver behind
Amy's back and was preparing to get
away, but these views of Amy's mother
paused. On the verge of a first drive
I had never in my life stopped to con-
sider the ethics of golf-club cleaning.
Why had not Amy a pocket and a rag
of sand-paper like resourceful Jimmy
Baines? I don't remember to have
ever read anything on the niceties of
the art of scouring clubs. It is a
subject on which the writers of golfing
articles — prolific enough, as Heaven
knows, about other and more negligible
aspects of the game—seem to have
adopted an attitude of studied reticence.
“Look here, Amy,” I said rather
severely, “you really must not talk.
You must remember you are here to
carry my clubs, not to tell me about
your mother. My iron clubs must be
cleaned precisely as they always have
been cleaned. That is entirely your
department of the game, and you must
stand at least three yards further away
or I shall probably kill you.” Then I
drove, sliced hideously, and landed in
long grass a hundred yards to the
right.
Some premonition of feminine detach-
ment prompted me to keep my eyes
rigidly on the tuft which concealed my
ball, as I strode forward. . But half-way
I turned. I felt Amy was not with me.
She was standing precisely where I had
left her, her hat off, her pink tongue
stuck out in the direction of the caddies'
shed.
“Amy " I shouted, and the sound of
my voice had an indescribably incon-
gruous and humiliating echo. “Amy,
come here at once; how dare—”
Amy came ambling across the fairway,
hat in hand, my bag of clubs left where
she had deposited them upside down
in the tee-box for greater freedom in
responding with gestures of defiance to
the chaff of the enemy.
“Now look here,” I said as Amy
stood wonderingly before me; “I am
very, very disappointed in you—very,
very angry. You wanted to earn your
living, I understood?”
Amy's brows darkened but her lips
were slightly tremulous.
“Mother won't let me go into the
laundry,” she said sulkily, “'cos father
methelay. She says she don't 'old with Jimmy Baines give me 'is cheek, so I
give it 'im back.”
Thus we stood surveying the situ-
ation, my girl - caddie and I. There
seemed at the moment only one sane
way of ending it.
“Very well, Amy,” I said dispassion-
ately, “you had better run home and
tell your mother—tell your mother to
come up to the house after dinner, if
there's anything she needs.”
Amy resigned her position without a
murmur; but before she went she ex-
were so complete an innovation that I tracted two paintless, weary-looking
golf-balls from the pocket of her mauve
skirt and offered me them for sixpence.
THE cott AGE. . .
I KNow a wood on the top of a hill,
Hyacinth-carpeted March till May,
Where nights are wonderful, soft and
still,
And a deep-sea twilight hangs all day;
The loving labour of fairy hands
Has made it heavenly fine to see,
And just outside it the cottage stands,
The cottage that doesn't belong to me.
A cottage, mind,
And I'm sure you'd find
It was damp and dirty and very
confined ;
Oh, quite an ordinary keeper's cottage
That doesn't belong to me.
Creatures people the wood at night;
Peaceable animals come and play;
Pan's own pipes, if you hear aright,
Charm you on as you go your way;
| And all the Arcady folk of yore . .
Make songs of the days that used to be,
Which carry perhaps to the cottage
door, -
The cottage that doesn't belong to me.
IBut it 's miles from town
And it's tumble-down,
And the woodwork's done and
the slates are brown;
No one could really live in the cottage
That doesn't belong to me.
Fair be the towns by the river-side,
Maidenhead, Richmond, Henley,
IXew, -
Crammed with cottages far and wide,
The thing for people like me and you;
But I think of the haunting forest-lights
And a path that wanders from tree
to tree,
Where the man of the cottage might
walk o' nights,
The cottage that doesn't belong to me.
And it may be wrong,
But it won't be long
Before the feeling becomes too
strong
And I'll go and jolly well get that
cottage
and some whitin' to finish, and some
That doesn't belong to me.

our BookING-office.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Reality (CASSELL) deserves to rank high amongst the
novels of the present season; it has, indeed, qualities that
will cause it, if I am not mistaken, to outlive most of them.
The chief of these I can best express by the word colour;
by which I mean not only a picturesque setting, but tem-
perament and a fine sense of the romantic in life. Perhaps
I ought to have known the name of Miss OLIVE WADSLEY
already. As I did not, I can only be glad that Reality
has rectified the fault; I shall certainly not again forget
a writer who has given me so much pleasure. The
scene of the story is laid in Vienna, chiefly in musical
Vienna, and the protagonists are the young widow, Irene
von Cleve, and the violinist, Jean Victoire, whom she
marries despite the well-founded objections of her noble
family. Some of the family, too, are quite excellently
drawn, notably a Cardinal, who, though he has little
to do in the tale, manages to appear much more human
and less of a draped waxwork than most Eminences of
fiction. I have said that the objections of Irene's relations
were justified, the fact being that Jean was not only a
genius, but the most scatterbrained egoist and vulgarian.
Naturally, therefore, the alliance turned out a failure; and
the process is quite admirably portrayed. I liked least in
the book the end, with its sudden revelation of a superfluous
Secret. Had the secret not been so superfluous it might have
Vexed me to have been so long kept in ignorance of it, Dut
this is a small matter. The chief point is that Reality has the
pulse of life in it—in a word that it confirms its title; which,
indeed, is about the highest praise that a critic can bestow.
- I am not at all sure how Mr. FRANK Norris, were he º
living, would have regarded the resurrection of this early
attempt at realism, as taught us by M. Zola–Vandover
and the Brute (HEINEMANN). He would, I fancy, have soft-
ened some of the crudities and allowed a touch of humour
to lighten the more solemn passages. There are pages here
that remind one that Vandover's creator was also the author
of those magnificent novels The Octopus and The Pit; but
I cannot, in spite of them, place much confidence in the
truth of Vandover's life history. We are told that he en-
joyed his bath, and usually spent two or three hours over
it. When the water was very warm he got into it with his
novel on a rack in front of him and a box of chocolates con-
veniently near. Here he stayed for over an hour, eating
and reading and occasionally smoking a cigarette. Can
you wonder after this that poor Vandover went utterly to
the bad, and is to be found on the last page doing some
horrible work with a muck-rake whilst an innocent child
points an obvious moral? So certain was Vandover's doom,
once that box of chocolates had been mentioned, that I
grew impatient and a little weary. If this is an age of
realism in fiction I think that Vandover and the Brute
should make plain to any reader why, very shortly, we are
going to have an age of something else.
Do not allow yourself to be put off by the title of
Captivating Mary Carstairs (CoNSTABLE)—now published
for the first time in England. It is not, as you might
assume, a costume novel of eighteenth-century tushery.
This is what I expected; but as a matter of fact Mr.
HENRY SYDNor HARRison has written a tale about as
unlike this as anything well could be. It is a capital tale,
too; American to the last epithet, and crammed so full of
the unexpected and adventurous that never (except once)
can you anticipate for a moment what is going to happen.
The chief adventure is abduction, the subject of it being
Mary Carstairs, whose father was separated from her

A DETERMINED ISLAND.
ANYTHING more peaceful than the outward aspect of the
Isle of Wight, as I have seen it from Totland Bay during
the past week, it would be impossible to conceive. For the
most part the sun has been shining from a blue sky on a
blue and brilliant sea; men, women and children have been
swimming and splashing joyfully in a most mixed manner,
and the whole landscape has had its usual holiday air.
These, however, are deceptive appearances. We have felt
and are feeling the imminence of war, and, though our
judgments are firm and patriotic and prepared for sacrifice,
our minds are clouded with a heavy anxiety, Our news-
papers arrive at about 11 o'clock, and at that hour there is
a concentrated rush to the book-shop. There we make our
way through stacked volumes of cheap reprints to the
counter where two ladies are struggling womanfully against
the serried phalanx of purchasers. These two dive head-
first from time to time into a great pile of the morning's
news and emerge triumphantly with The Times for Prospect
House or The Telegraph for Orville Lodge, and so on through
the crowd of applicants until all are satisfied. This is the
side of the road, news telegrams are shown on a board, and
with these we eke out the knowledge of our fluctuating fate.
Close by, too, is posted up a proclamation by the officer
commanding the troops in the Island. He bids us not to
walk too near a fort or to convey to any casual person such
knowledge as we may have gained about the movements of
troops, and we are commanded “to at once report” any-
thing suspicious. I am sure the gallant officer will display
as much vigour in the battering of his country's foes as he
has shown in the splitting of the KING's infinitives. Going
for my newspaper this morning I saw at a distance an
elderly gentleman of a serious aspect revolving steadily
round and round a tall iron post. It was not until I came
closer that I realised the meaning of his strange gyrations.
The proclamation had been inconsiderately pasted round
the post and he was endeavouring to read it.
On Thursday last, nearly a week before the actual pro-
clamation of war, the wildest rumours were afloat here.
A motherly lady assured me with a smile that the German
fleet might be expected at any moment. “The British fleet,”
she told me, “has been overwhelmed and sunk in the North
Sea. The Germans have determined to capture the Isle of
Wight, so we are none of us safe.” I asked her where she
had heard this dreadful news. “Oh, it's all over the
village.” Thereupon she moved calmly into a bathing
cabin and had a patriotic dip. In another quarter I was
told that the Island could not fail to be cut off, and awful
things were prophesied as to what would happen to us
unless we made our way to the mainland with the utmost
promptitude. The supply of eggs was to run short; meat
was to go up to famine prices or be reserved entirely for the
soldiery, our intrepid defenders; bread was to become a
luxury obtainable only by millionaires. All this was re-
ported on the authority of a man who had it from another
man who had it from a banker who was in close touch with
the War Office in London. So far what is true is that
steamers no longer come to Totland Bay, and anyone who
wants to visit us here can get no nearer by boat than
Yarmouth—not, of course, the home of the bloater, but our
own little island Yarmouth, round the corner. In the
meantime a good deal of patriotic self-denial is going on
amongst the juvenile population. A friend of mine, aged
seven, hearing the talk about all the coming privations, has
decided to remove chocolates, buns and sponge-cakes from
his dietary, and several young ladies have agreed to take
milk instead of cream with their breakfast porridge.
This morning we were brought face to face with the
grimmest reality of war we have so far experienced. A boy-
scout called at the house and produced an official paper
asking for the names and addresses of any aliens who
might be residing in the house. We have one such alien,
a German maid for the children, a most unwarlike and
inoffensive alien. Her name was entered on the form and
the boy-scout disappeared to call at other houses. Since
then, at intervals of about half-an-hour, other boy-scouts
have called and produced similar forms. I have just dis-
missed a party of three, telling them that they seemed to be
overlapping. They smiled and said, “Thank you,” and
retired. I look out of the window and behold two more
approaching. They are doing the thing thoroughly.
P.S.—Another notice is out warning us that it is known
there are a lot of spies in the Island, and that we must not
loiter near a fort lest we be shot. It is rumoured that soldiers
are to be billeted on us (enthusiastic cheers from the younger
members of the family). R. C. L.

THE PROBLEM of LIFE.
The noise of the retreating sea came
pleasantly to us from a distance. Celia
was lying on her—I never know how
to put this nicely—well, she was lying
face downwards on a rock and gazing
into a little pool which the tide had
forgotten about and left behind. I sat
beside her and annoyed a limpet.
Three minutes ago I had taken it sud-
denly by surprise and with an Herculean
effort moved it an eighteenth of a milli-
metre westwards. My silence since
then was lulling it into a false security,
and in another two minutes I hoped to
get a move on it again.
“Do you know,” said Celia with a
puzzled look on her face, “sometimes
I think I'm quite an ordinary person
after all.”
“You aren't a little bit,” I said
lazily; “you're just like nobody else
in the world.” -
“Well, of course, you had to say
that.” -
“No, I hadn't. Lots of husbands
would merely have yawned." I felt
one coming and stopped it just in time.
Waiting for limpe's to go to sleep is
drowsy work. “But why are you so
morbid about yourself suddenly?"
“I don't know,” she said. “Only
every now and then I find myself
thinking the most obvious thoughts.”
“We all do,” I answered, as I stroked
my limpet gently. The noise of our
conversation had roused it, but a gentle
stroking motion (I am told by those to
whom it has confided) will frequently
cause its muscles to relax. “The great
thing is not to speak them. Still, you'd
better tell me now. What is it?"
“Well,” she said, her cheeks perhaps
a little pinker than usual, “I was just
thinking that life was very wonderful.
But it's a silly thing to say.”
“It's holiday time,” I reminded her.
“The necessity of sprinkling our re-
marks with thoughtful words like
“economic' and ‘sporadic' is over for a
bit. Let us be silly.” I scratched in
the rock the goal to which I was urging
my limpet and took out my watch.
“Three thirty-five. I shall get him
there by four.” -
Celia was gazing at two baby fishes
who played in and out a bunch of
sea-weed. Above the sea-weed an
anemone sat fatly.
“I suppose they're all just as much
alive as we are,” she said thoughtfully.
“They marry"—I looked at my limpet
with a new interest—“and bring up
families and go about their business,
and it all means just as much to them
as it does to us.”
“My limpet's business affairs mean
am only wrapped up in him as a
sprinter.”
“Aren't you going to try to move him
again 2"
“He's not quite ready yet.
has his suspicions.”
Celia dropped into silence. Her next
question showed that she had left the
pool for a moment.
“Are there any people in Mars?” she
asked.
“People down here say that there
aren't. A man told me the other day
that he knew this for a fact. On the
other hand, people in Mars know for a
fact that there isn't anybody on the
Earth. Probably they are both wrong.”
“I should like to know a lot about
things,” sighed Celia. “Do you know
anything about limpets?”
“Only that they stick like billy-o.”
“I suppose more about them is
known than that ?”
“I suppose so. By people who have
made a speciality of them. For one
who has preferred to amass general
knowledge rather than to specialize it
is considered enough to know that they
stick like billy-o.”
“You haven't specialized in any-
thing, have you?”
“Only in wives.”
Celia smiled and went on, “How do
you make a speciality of limpets?”
“Well, I suppose you — er—study
them. You sit down and—and watch
them. Probably after dark they get up
and do something. And of course, in
any case, you can always dissect one
and see what he's had for breakfast.
One way and another you get to know
things about them.”
“They must have a lot of time for
thinking,” said Celia, regarding my
limpet with her head on one side. “Tell
me, how do they know that there are
no men in Mars?”
I sat up with a sigh.
“Celia, you do dodge about so. I
have barely brought together and classi-
fied my array of facts about things in
this world, when you've dashed up to
another one. What is the connection
between Mars and limpets? If there
are any limpets in Mars they are fresh-
water ones. In the canals.”
“Oh, I just wondered,” she said. “I
mcan "-she wrinkled her forehead in
the effort to find words for her thoughts
—“I'm wondering what everything
means, and why we're all here, and what
limpets are for, and, supposing there
are people in Mars, if we're the real
people whom the world was made for,
or if they are.” She stopped and added,
“One evening after dinner, when we
get home, you must tell me all about
everything.” -
He still
explain everything to her. I suppose
I must have explained a stymie or a
no-ball very cleverly once.
“Well,” I said, “I can tell you what
limpets are for now. They're like
sheep and cows and horses and pheas-
ants and — and any other animal.
They're just for us. At least so the
wise people say.” -
“But we don't eat limpets.”
“No, but they can amuseus. This
one "—and with a sudden leap I was
behind him as he dozed and I had
dashed him forward another eighteenth
of a millimetre—“this one has amused
me.”
“Perhaps,” said Celia thoughtfully
and I don't think it was quite a nice
thing for a young woman to say,
“perhaps we're only meant to amuse
the people in Mars.”
“Then,” I said lazily, “let’s hope
they are amused.”
But that was nearly three weeks ago.
Ten days later war was declared. Celia
has said no more on the subject since
her one afternoon's unrest, but she looks
at me curiously sometimes, and I fear
that the problem of life leaves her more
puzzled than ever. At the risk of be-
traying myself to her as “quite an
ordinary person after all " I confess
that just at the moment it leaves me
puzzled too. A. A. M.
THE EXTENUATING GIRGUMSTANCE.
It was a seaside railway station, the
arriving place of one of those health
resorts where people flock in their
millions to enjoy a little peace and
quiet together. He, no doubt as a

the station-master; she was one of
those many kind ladies who come to
meet their relatives and to make their
arrival even more peaceful and quiet
than such events usually are.
“Was that the train from London?”
she asked him. -
He temporized. “Have you asked a

She nodded.

She acquiesced.
“But none the less,” continued the

The suggestion was an attractive one,
but was rejected. “Then,” he said, “let

He took her to his office and begged
her to be seated. “Repose all confi-

“Believe me, Madam,” he protested,
“I should not accuse you of being mis-
taken, even if your husband should
prove to be in this train I recommend.
He might have deceived you.”
She refused to budge. “My hus-
band's postcard says he is coming in
the 6.30 train from London. The train
has come and he is not in it.”
The station - master asked to be
allowed to see the postcard, not, he
explained, because he didn't believe
her, but because he would like to have
his worst suspicions of his Company's
inefficiency confirmed.
She handed it to him. He read the
announcement, made briefly and without
enthusiasm, of the husband's proposed
arrival “by the 6.30 train to-morrow.”
The woman smiled with triumph; the
station-master referred to the postmark.
He did not smile triumphantly. He
“Will you allow me to intercede as
a friend for all parties?” he asked.
“Give him and us another chance;

After some debate she was induced
to see reason in the proposal and con-

rose to go.

showing her out, “if a train should

0UR MUSICAL CORRESPONDENCE
COLUMN.
(With acknowledgments to “The
Musical Herald.”)
I THINK I am a tenor, but after taking
lessons continuously for six years from
sixteen different masters I am still in
doubt, and what is more, I am not quite
certain whether I want to be. Did not
somebody once say that a tenor was not
a man but a disease ? I am a healthy
normal subject, and recently won the
lawn-tennis singles at our local tourna-
ment. What puzzles me is my upper
register. After reaching the top A, if
I relaa, the wind pressure and slant the
voice in a slightly backward direction
towards the nasal cavities, I can pro-
duce a full rich B flat, or even C, with
the greatest ease. My family do not
like it, but family criticism is seldom
satisfactory. Can you tell me whether
this is a legitimate use of my vocal
resources or not ; also, whether the
resinous quality of my voice is likely to
be affected by my wearing stand-up
collars of more than 2% inches in height {
I have read somewhere that starched
linen is a bad conductor of sound-
MARIo JUNIOR.
ANswer.—It is hard to tell whether
you are a tenor or a forced-up baritone
without hearing or seeing you. Tenors
are generally short, stubby men with
brief necks, while baritones are for the
most part tall, spare and long-necked,
It was HANs von BüLow who said
that a tenor was a disease, but he was
a pianist and a conductor. Do not
“grouse” if you can sing tenor parts
and yet retain the volume and virility of
a baritone. JEAN DE RESZKE began as
a baritone and is said to have earned
£20,000 a year. The nasal tone that
you speak of, when it approximates to
the whinnying of a horse or, better
still, the trumpeting of an infuriated
rogue elephant, is a most valuable asset,
but should be used with moderation
in the family circle. Do not say
“resinous”; “resonant" is probably
the word you mean. High stand-up
collars are certainly to be avoided, as
they constrict the Adam's apple and
muffle the tone of the voice. A soft
turn-down collar, such as those Sup-
plied by Pope Bros., is greatly to
be preferred and imparts a romantic
and semi-Byronic appearance highly
desirable in an artist.
I am a railway porter with a good
bass voice, and having read that the
great Russian singer who has been
appearing at Drury Lane began life
in that position and is now paid at the
rate of £400 a night I am anarious to

ANSWER.—It is always dangerous to
generalise from exceptional individual
cases. Are you over six feet high, and
have you corn-coloured hair and blue
eyes, like CHALIAPINE 2 Again, Russian
railway porters are in the habit of
shouting the names of stations, not
only in a loud voice, but with scrupu-
lously clear articulation. Do not rashly
abandon your career on the railway on
the off-chance of a vocal Bonanza.
Remember the words of the poet:—
O, ever since the world began,

My voice is of good compass and
volume, but it is lacking in the “rich
fruity tone" which, according to popular
novelists, is indispensable to the eac-
ertion of a magnetic influence on the
hearer. Is it possible by diet to remedy
this deficiency –CoNTRAL.To.
ANswer.—The use of an emollient
diet is recommended by some authori-
ties with a view to improving and en-
riching vocal tone. You might try a
course of Carlsbad plums, Devonshire
cream, and peach-fed Coloradoham. But
it is easy to overdo the plummy tone,
which is apt to become cloying.
Kindly explain the following terms

would be a sort of mental squint.
“Katzenjammer” is the German for “hot
coppers.” “Cephaloedematous” is not in
the New Oxford Dictionary, but appar-
ently applies to a sufferer from swelled
head. Hokusai was a Japanese artist,
and “asininity” is the special quality of
the writer of the article from which you
have taken these words. (2) “Scooping”
is the vulgarisation of the portamento.
(3) Operatic singers grow stout because
they drink stout; also because much
singing tends to expand the larynx,

basilico-thaumaturgic cavities of the

THE DOUBLE LIFE.
WHEN Araminta said that I must
speak to the man next door about his
black cat, I was greatly perturbed. It
appeared that the animal had acquired
the habit of spending the night in our
house, and that Harriet didn't like it.
I said that black cats brought good
luck, and, anyhow, by night all cats
were grey. Araminta replied that this
one was as black as a bilberry and
took fish. Walking out into the garden
I began to meditate deeply.
Perhaps you do not immediately
grasp what a terrible and dangerous
thing it was that Araminta had re-
quested me to do. Between next-door
neighbours in the area of Greater Lon-
don there subsist relations of an infinite
delicacy. They resemble the bloom
upon a peach. They combine a sense
of mutual confidence and esteem with
absolute determination not to let it get
any further. Mr.Trumpington (Harriet
vouched for his name) and myself were
certainly acquainted. In a sense you
may even say we were friends. If I
happened to be murdered or assaulted
by a footpad there was not the smallest
reason to suppose that Mr. Trumping-
ton would refrain from giving the
police every assistance in identifying
the criminal. Similarly, if Mr. Trump-
ington's house caught fire, it was
certain that I should be one of the
first to offer him the loan of our garden
syringe.
As things were, what happened was
this. Twice or thrice a week we
nodded pleasantly to each other over
the wall that divided our demesnes,
through the interstices of our respective
hollyhocks; once, only once, in a
mad burst of irresponsible gaiety, Mr.
Trumpington had gone so far as to
murmur, “Good aft-" to me, and I
bad responded effusively, “-ernoon.”
And now all this atmosphere of quiet
sociableness was about to be destroyed
through the paltry misdemeanours of a
subfusc cat. For I had not the smallest
doubt as to what would happen. Mr.
Trumpington was a mild amiable-
looking man. There was not the
faintest prospect of his flying into a
rage. He would not say, “What right
have you to interfere with the private
affairs of another man's domesticated
fauna?” He would not ask me why I
had inveigled his beautiful black cat on
to my poisonous premises. . . No, we
should talk together reasonably, amic-
ably, and as man to man. Mr. Trump:
ington would promise to do all he could
to give his cat pleasant, cheerful even;
ings at home, and I should agree that
it was very hard to prevent a young

“Cats,” we should say, nodding our
heads wisely, “will be cats.”
And then from cats we should pass
on to dogs, to sport, to politics, to
business, to heaven knows what. And
the next day we should be compelled
to pick up our conversation where we
had dropped it. We should discuss our
gardens and our family affairs. Things
would go from bad to worse. All our
| privacy and peace would disappear.
We might almost as well break down
the wall that divided us at once. Pos-
sibly (thought of horror) his wife would
call on Araminta . . .
Still pondering ruefully, I turned
round at the bottom of the garden
path, and behold, sitting on the party-
wall between Mr.Trumpington's garden
and mine, was the debateable cat. An
impulse of murderous rage possessed
me. I took an old golf-ball from my
pocket and hurled it as hard as I could
at the potential destroyer of my peace.
The black cat was no sportsman. It
dodged, and disappeared hastily on the
Trumpington side. At the same moment
from behind a large clump of hollyhocks
I heard the sudden cry of a strong man
in pain, followed by a stifled oath.
|I squatted down instantly behind a
thick rosebush; then, rising to peer
cautiously, I saw a most painful sight.
I saw the horrible transformation which
may be caused in the features of an
ordinary and amiable man by an access
of sudden rage and the impact of a
brambled golf-ball on the end of the
nose. I squatted again.
... Confound the infernal fool! Who
did that?” said the face of Mr. Trump-
ington, looking through the hollyhock
peepholes, the buds of which rapidly
began to turn from a lightish pink to
deep rose.
It is always a more dignified policy
to ignore a man in a temper, so it was
not until about ten minutes had
elapsed, and silence reigned, that I
crawled painfully away into safety.
About five minutes later a note was
brought round by hand from next door.
It ran as follows:–
‘..Mr. Trumpington will feel greatly
ºbliged if Mr. Brown will prevent his
black cat from constantly straying upon
his, Mr. Trumpington's, flower beds.
He also requests that when Mr. Brown
Wishes to persecute his black cat he
should not do so when the animal is

this practice is attended with consider-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExtRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Aug. 3.
—WHEN Edward GREY stood at Table
to make momentous statement on posi-
tion of Great Britain confronted by
spectacle of Europe in arms, he faced
a memorable scene. House crowded
from floor to topmost range of Strangers'
Gallery. LANSDown E, “BoBs,” GEORGE
CURzoN and other Peers looked on and
listened. Amongst them Lord CHIEF
JUSTICE for first time obtained view of
House from novel point of vantage.
Owing to spread of complications,
supply of Ambassadors accustomed to
repair to Diplomatic Gallery
restricted. No room for Ger-
many to-day. Absent, too, the
popular figure of Austro-Hungar-
ian Ambassador, familiar these
many years in London Society.
Russia, Spain, Sweden and
Greece were there in the per-
sons of their representatives;
and Belgium, conscious that
words about to be uttered were
big with her fate.
The sight they looked down
upon was strange and moving.
Setting of scene worthy of drama
which finds no full parallel in
world's history. Keen eyes ac-
customed to study potentialities
of nations discerned in the
gathering a new portentous
fact. A week ago to-day political
parties in House of Commons
preserved customary attitude of
hostility. Across the floor they
Snapped at each other distrust
and dislike. Long-brooding re-
volt of armed forces in Ireland
had leaped into flame. Mob
and military had come to blows.
Victims of the affray lay dead
politics, not unexpected. Glad surprise
followed when John REDMoND assured
the Government they might forthwith
withdraw from Ireland every man of
their troops.
“The coasts of Ireland,” he added,
“will be defended from foreign in-
vasion by our armed sons. For this
purpose Nationalist Catholics in the
South will be only too glad to join
hands with armed Protestant Ulster-
men in the North.”

Bench PREMIER walked down House as
if he were about to leave it by glass
door. Reaching the Bar he halted and
turned about to face crowded benches
watching him with quickened anxiety.
Grave events have within the last few
days made him the Herald of War.
What might be this new missive he

“A message from HIS MAJESTY,” he
said, “signed by his own hand.”
Advancing to Table he handed docu-
ment to the Clerk who passed it on to

This the significant supple-
ment to statement made by
PREMIER immediately on
SPEAKER taking the Chair. It
told how telegram had that
morning been sent to German
Government demanding assur-
ance of maintenance of Belgian
neutrality.
“We have asked,” said the
PREMIER as quietly as if he
were mentioning request for
early reply to a dinner invita-
tion, “that a satisfactory answer
shall be given before midnight.”
House knew what that meant.
On the stroke of midnight Great
Britain and Germany would be
at war.
A cheer almost fierce in its
intensity approved the epoch-
making challenge. The House
knew that England's hands were

unscrupulously, taken advantage of.

seemed, alike of the raging blizzard and

he was obliged to carry the others one

make an ascent of the Wetterhorn under
Ralph's leadership. Early in the climb
Ralph discovers that Sir Ernest Scrivener

him and sweep him down the

tatingly to the rescue of his
deadliest foe.]
RATHER than face a second
traverse of the awful glacier
the remaining members of
the party continued the
ascent. With shaken nerves
they pressed on to the best
of their ability, but it was
nearly dark when they at
length reached the summit,
hoping to find another and
easier route to the foot.
But luck was against
them. A devastating bliz-
zard enveloped them, and
they lay huddled together
behind a rock, chilled to the
bone by the driving particles
of ice and snow.
“There is no escape,”
said Lord Tamerton mourn-
fully to his sister, Lady
Margaret. “We must pre-

“True fiddlesticks' " replied Lady
Margaret with spirit. “Ralph will
come back to us.”
“Do you love him, Madge 2" asked
her brother.
“Yes,” she replied simply.
“Then he will surely come back.”
Even as he spoke a tall figure loomed
out of the blizzard and raised his hat
with cold formality.
“Your cousin is safe in the hospital
at Interlaken,” said Ralph, addressing
Lord Tamerton with marked constraint.
“He has merely sustained a fractured
patella. With your permission we will
now descend.”
“What is the matter, Ralph 2 ” cried
Lady Margaret pleadingly; but, ignor-
ing her question, he busied himself in
tying on the rope.

more generous bcdy of men in the
world.
Unerringly Ralph led his companions
through arêtes, glissades, bergschrunds,
rücksacs, gendarmes, vorwaerts, coul-
oirs, aiguilles, never hesitating, never
flinching from any obstacle, heedless, it
seemed, alike of the raging blizzard and
the ever-thickening darkness. At times
he was obliged to carry the others one
by one along razor edges of hard blue
ice. At times he would cling pre-
cariously by one hand to a projecting
splinter of rock, while with the other
he lowered them all bodily into the
depths of a crevasse, “gripping his
ice-axe meanwhile steadfastly between
his teeth. Once at least he was com-
pelled to hang downwards by his toes
while he hewed steps beneath him in a
perpendicular wall of ice. And through
it all his face retained its stern im-
passivity and he addressed no word t
his exhausted companions. -
At length the most wonderful feat
in the history of climbing was finished,
and the party, weary but thankful,
stood at the foot of the mountain.
The three guides fell on their knees
before their rescuer, but he ignored
them and turned his cold, hard gaze
upon Lady Margaret.
“You are now safe,” he said icily.
“My presence is no longer necessary.
Take the third turning on the left, the
second on the right and the fifth on the
left, and then ask again. Before I
leave I ought perhaps to congratulate
you upon your approaching marriage
to your—er—amiable cousin;” and
without waiting for a reply he was gone.
Alone, Ralph Wonderson sat upon a
rock and reflected that no food had
passed his lips since that hurried break-
fast in the Fahrjoch Hut. Wearily he
drew out a packet of sandwiches from
his pocket.
A moment later he was racing back
to his former companions. In his day
he had been half-mile champion, but
now he knocked a full minute off his
previous best time.
He found the others as he had left
them. Lady Margaret looked up with
a glad cry as he flew round the corner.
“Madge,” he cried, waving the piece
of newspaper which had been wrapped
round his sandwiches, “Madge, you
can't marry him 1"
Lord Tamerton leaped forward with
a white face. “What do you mean?”
he hissed. “You are mad. She must
marry him, or the family is ruined.”

[AUGUST 12, 1914,

| won the toss, and to that fact the sub-
sequent impasse may be attributed. I
ON ACTIVE SERVICE.
Every August Bank Holiday we
have a short Mixed Open Tournament
at our lawn-tennis club. It's quite a
small, homely affair, but as our Presi-
dent, Sir Benjamin Boogles, always
offers two valuable prizes (hall-marked),
every member who can possibly enter
does so. Each year hitherto the Tour-
nament has been finished in the one
day; but this year it is not finished yet—
in fact, in one instance the first game
of the first set is still undecided, and
the winners in the other sets are
anxiously awaiting the result in order
that the second round may proceed
before the end of the season. As I am
one of the actors—I might almost say
the protagonist—in this protracted
drama, I will explain the position.
Wilbrooke, our crack player, who can
easily give most of us forty and a bonus
of five games in the set, and still beat
us, recently became engaged to Pattie
Blobson, who is a hopeless rabbit at
the game, this being her first season.
Not unnaturally she insisted on his
entering the Tournament with her.
I always enter with Joan, and though
we are neither of us exactly rabbits
it would be rather hard to find - a
zoological term that would fittingly
describe our standard of play. Of
course there is no handicapping in
“Opens,” and Joan and I usually
reckon to be knocked out in the second
round at latest, though we did once get
into the third round owing to one of our
opponents, a doctor, being summoned
to a case in the middle of play. --
Now this year we both thought our
tennis would be over for the day after
the first quarter of an hour, as we were
drawn to play our first round against
However, I
elected to serve first, leaving Wilbrooke
the choice of sides. The sun was not
shining, so there was little in it from
the point of view of light; but the east
end of the court is just a trifle higher
than the other, so he chose that.
I served first, and though I never
peg them in to rabbits, I felt justified
in sending down a medium-paced ball
in my partner's interests. It pitched-
| correctly, broke (unintentionally) and
buried itself in Pattie's skirt.
Fifteen-love.
I banged my first ball to Wilbrooke
with all my might. It fell within the
| Club precincts, but that's the best I
can urge for it.
My second was an
easy lob, which he smashed, and, in
spite of my efforts to give it a clear
path, it caught me in the small of
Fifteen-all.
My next serve to Pattie was a fault,
which I followed up with an ordinary
“donkey" drop, towards which she
rushed in the impetuous fashion charac-
teristic of the genuine rabbit, with the
result that it bounced scathless over
her head. . .
Thirty-fifteen. --
I then got a fast ball over to Wil-
brooke, but returning it was child's play
to him, and he drove it like lightning
down the centre-line before I had time
to call “Leave it to you, partner.”
Thirty-all. -
Again I served Pattie a fault. At
the second attempt the ball performed
Blondin tricks on the wire of the net,
and for one of those “moments big as
years." I feared we had lost the game,
the service to Wilbrooke being a mere
formality; but fortunately the ball fell
the other side of the net, and my third
delivery Pattie tipped to the wicket-
keeper. " :
Forty-thirty. . . .
I now determined to send two—iſ
necessary—fast ones to Wilbrooke on
the chance that one might shoot and
be unplayable. But my first ball went
into the net, and the locale of the second
can only be dinily surmised, for it went
oyer the fence into the open country.
Deuce. *
It was at this point that I began to
realize that so long as I did not serve
a double - fault to Pattie, Wilbrooke
could never win the game, and when
we had played nine more deuces I
communicated the intelligence to Joan.
Meanwhile, the other sets had all fin-
ished, and the players came up to see
why we were still hard at it. At the
twenty-fourth deuce the Tournament
secretary remarked: “Last game, I
suppose?, Hurry up, we can't get on.”
I explained to him that this was only
the first game of the set, and that simi-
lar prolongations were likely to recur
when my partner served in the third
game and I again in the fifth.
- The news spread rapidly, and for a
time we were the most unpopular quar-
tet in the Club; but by the time we
had reached our eighty-third deuce, and
luncheon (the gift of Lady Boggles) was
served, hunger and anger began to abate
simultaneously, and the situation was
discussed with humour to the exclusion
of all other topics. At the end of
the morning's play I was certainly feel-
ing a trifle done up, but it says much for
the recuperative properties of chicken
galantine and junket that after the
interval I felt quite invigorated and
good for service ad infinitum. Efforts
were made to induce us to toss for the
set, but neither of us would consent to
normal conditions I could not possibly
win the game, and I arguing that under
existing conditions—with which I was
more intimately concerned—I could not
possibly lose it, and therefore to toss
would be a mockery. Thus there was
no alternative but to play on.
I suggested to Joan that as her pre-
sence on the court was not strictly
essential she should join in a friendly
set with some of the other unemployed.
But she would not hear of it. She
wanted to be in at the finish, if there
was ever going to be a finish, she said;
and so we continued.
When we were summoned to tea
(kindly provided gratis by Miss Vera
Boogles) we had amassed 265 deuces,
and though my right arm ached and
my service was a trifle wobbly I was
still scoring the vantage point (and
losing it at once) with the utmost regu-
larity. But the temporary cessation of
hostilities, associated with about half-
a-pound of Swiss roll and three Chelsea
buns, served to restore me, and after
tea we went at it again until half-past
seven, when, with the score at 394
deuces, the net got tired and collapsed,
and we adjourned. -
We have since met on every available
evening in our endeavours to bring the
game to a conclusion; but the score is
still deuce, and at that it will probably
remain unless one of the following con-
tingencies arises:– . .
(1) Pattie may improve so much
with the constant practice that she
will be able to return my service; in
which case it will settle the game, for
wherever we put the ball Wilbrooke is
bound to get hold of it and drive or
smash it so that we can't return it.
(2) I may serve Pattie a double-fault.
But I am now in splendid training;
my right biceps is like a cricket-ball,
and I feel that I could serve all day
without tiring. Besides, the quality of
my service is improving, which counter-
acts, in a measure, the possible im:
provement in Pattie's game. -
(3) We may get a bright sunshiny
evening, when the sun will be straight
in Wilbrooke's eyes; in which case,
with my improved service, I may poi:
sibly get a fast ball over which he will
be unable to see.
Anyway, it is now certain that I
belong to the Bulldog Breed.

A SONG FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
“WHERE MY CARAVAN HAS RESTED.’’
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
As in the enervating luxury of peace, so in the stern
stringency of war we have always a use, and a good use too,
for the humourist. But he must be a jester of the right
sort; not bitter nor flippant, not over boisterous nor too
“intellectual.” Humour for humour's sake is what we want,
and in these anxious hours something to make us laugh
quietly and unhysterically, if only by way of temporary
relief. Mr. IAN HAy hits the mark about eight times
in every ten in A Knight on Wheels (Hodder AND
Stoughton), which is not at all a bad proportion for
three hundied and nineteen pages. He has some de-
lightful ideas, which, happily, he does not overwork: a
case in point is the brief but rapid career of Uncle Joseph,
who employs the most criminal methods in order to
attain the most charitable ends. The story is a simple one
-youth, laughter and love; and the motor car plays an
important but not a tiresome part in it. The author's
attitude towards women is slightly cynical but very light-
hearted, and clearly he loves them all the time: indeed, I
think Mr. HAY, while alive to existing faults, loves every-
thing and everybody. In return most people will be
prepared to love him. And he deserves to be loved for the
sake of a book which has a happy beginning, a happy
middle and a happy end, together with lots of incidental
laughter.
“There is a teacup storm in the Close, I hear. The
cleaning or some such trifle, and did not consult the
Chapter, which had already made its holiday arrangements.”
This sentence, chosen at random from Quisquiliae, the diary
of Henry Savile, will do well enough to support my contention
that Dr. Ashford and His Neighbours (MURRAY) is going to
be a great boon to the cathedral cities of our Midland
shires. Under the form of a narrative of social life in
Sunningwell, Dr. WARRE CoRNISH has elected to arrange
his views on religion, art, literature, politics and the ques-
tions of the day, sometimes putting them into the mouths
of his characters and sometimes into the note-book of the
afore-mentioned Henry Savile, a leisured cripple whose dis-
quisitions on letters and on people are, if a trifle rambling,
at any rate delightfully critical and much more interesting
and profound than certain others which flow periodically
from the windows of cloistered retreats. Mr. Henry Savile
quotes from the Classics perhaps a little too freely for the
taste of a decadent age, and his friends, Dr. Ashford, Lady
Grace, the bishop's wife, Olive, her niece, and Philip Daly,
nephew of an archdeacon and parliamentary candidate for
Sunningwell, would be a little more amusing if they were
treated in a more Trollopian manner, and did not so faith-
fully discuss the burning controversies of the time. But,
after all, the great excitement in Dr. Ashford and His
Neighbours (and I really cannot advise any resident in—
shall we say Mercia?—to be without it) is the chance it
affords for such questions as: Who is the Dean 2 Does the
author really mean Canon X? Are we living in Sunning-
well, or it it. L–? Even I myself, in this metropolitan
backwater, have made one or two ingenious guesses, but

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
- At this time of day to attempt criticism upon a new
novel by Miss RHoDA BROUGHToN seems almost imper-
tinent. The tens of thousands to whom she has given such
pleasure before now would probably be willing to read any-
thing that was put before them with the guarantee of her
name. Fortunately in the case of Concerning a Wow
(STANLEY PAUL) this confidence would be by no means
misplaced. I can say at once, with my hand upon my
reviewer's heart, that in freshness and vivacity and power
of sprightly character-drawing here is a story that need fear
comparison with none of its most popular predecessors.
The vow of the title was that exacted by Meg Champneys
on her death-bed from her sister Sally, binding the latter
not to marry Edward Branley, Edward, in some fashion
that was never made quite clear to me, had previously
jilted both the sisters. But this all happened before the
beginning of the book. In it poor -––
Edward is made so pitiable and
heart-broken a figure that I found
it hard to credit his previous in-
fidelities. However, most of the
other characters detested him, and
| said that nothing was too bad for
him; and as they themselves were
delightful and quite human people I
am ready to suppose that they had
their reasons. Of course Edward
and Saily were really in love all the
time, and of course too they find
resistance to this impossible; though
I must own that their method of
circumventing the vow reminded
me dangerously of the young man
who used a cigarette-holder because
he had been told to keep away from
tobacco. I speak flippantly; but as
a matter of fact the story of Edward
and Sally is not free from tragedy,
very simply and movingly told. , If

towards their model. There is very little in these illus-
trations to justify it. -
If I am not mistaken, The Jam Queen (METHUEN) marks
the first incursion of Miss NETTA SYRETT into humorous
fiction. In that, or any, case, she has written a story which
deserves a considerable success. The Jam Queen is to a
large extent what would be called in drama a one-part affair.
There are plenty of other characters, many of them drawn
with much unforced skill, but the personality of the pro-
tagonist, the Jam Queen herself, overshadows the rest.
Mrs. Quilter is an abiding joy. There have been plutocratic
elderly women, uneducated but agreeable, in a hundred
novels before this; but I recall few that have been treated
so honestly or with so much genuine sympathy. Mind you,
Miss SYRETT is no sentimentalist. Ill-directed philanthropy,
— Girtonian super-culture, the simple
life with its complexities of square-
cut gowns and bare feet—all these
come beneath the lash of a satire that
is delicate but unsparing. Yet with
it all she has, as every good satirist
should have, a quick appreciation of
the good qualities of her victims.
Even Frederick, the pious, as con-
trasted with the flippant, nephew of
aunt Quilter–Frederick, with his
futile institute for people who want
none of it, his blind pedantry, and
his actual dishonesty in what he
considers a worthy cause—even he
is punished no further than his
actual deserving. Perhaps in telling
you that Mrs. Quilter has two
nephews, an idle and an industrious
one, I have told you enough of the
scheme. It is, after all, no great
matter, Mrs. Quilter must be the
reason for your reading the book,
and your reward. She is real jam.

another violent explosion shattered the night. This time
it came from the fort just over the pier of Totland Bay.
The echoes reverberated and rumbled, and the shot tore
past close to the ship. Now she took the warning. There
were no more appeals from the fog-horn. Slowly she
turned and disappeared into the darkness. Possibly she
had been at sea for a long time and knew nothing of the
war. How she must have marvelled at this strange and
dreadful welcome from the Isle of Wight. We went to our
beds that night with a feeling of perſect security.
On land, too, we have had our excitements. Yesterday
afternoon, when the heather-clad slopes of Headon Hill
were crowded with picnickers, there was a sudden alarm of
spies. Some men, reported to have been conversing in
German, were said to have been peering into cracks in the
ground and otherwise behaving in a most suspicious manner.
The alarm was given, and almost instantly, springing as it
were from the very bowels of the earth, came some half-
dozen soldiers running with rifles and fixed bayonets. Amid
the shouts of the children they spread about the heather
in their hunt, but nothing came of it, for the “spies,” though
they were caught, turned out to be some Italians resident
in Totland Bay and fervently British in their sympathies.
I mentioned last week that we had a children's maid,
a German, in our household. Since then, in obedience to
the Act, she has been registered as an “alien enemy.' I took
her by train to Newport for that purpose. Qn arriving at
the station I hailed a fly. “Where to, Sir?" said the

a collector of old prints is coming to and sit down to work every morning is

our—or better, his—cigars into the
library, and I say, “Oh, look here, I
picked this print up last week; the man
said it was a genuine Eyre and Spot-
tiswoode; you might give me your
opinion.” He gives me his opinion . . .
and then his eye wanders down. I
see him reading the inscription on
the cup. -
The inscription says: “Long Jump,
1739,” or some such date. “First
Prize, won by—” and then my name
very big and splendid. Underneath
comes the school crest, followed by
the motto, “Dat Deus Incrementum,”
though I have never jumped any
further since. Its shape is the or-
dinary sherry-glass shape. It is my
only cup, and I am proud of it.
I look up as I write, and I see the
by the way, I don't know if you have
ever tried “looking up as you write.”
It is a common thing for reflective
writers to say they do, but you should
never believe them. It is impossible
to write properly when looking some-
where else. What we do is to stop
and slew our necks round, and then
take a fresh dip in the ink. Well,
slewing my neck round as I stop
writing, I see my precious cup stand-
ing on its shelf, and . . . horror! It is
standing upside down!
This comes as a surprise to you, but
it is no surprise to me. The thing
has been going on for months. It is
months ago that I first spoke to Celia
about it.
“It's Jane,” she said. “She always
puts it like that when she's been
dusting.”
“Yes, but what for 2 Just to catch
the eye?”
“I suppose because you always stand
glasses upside down when you've
cleaned them—to keep the dust out.”
“But if she'd only think a moment
she'd see that I don't drink out of
this, and that glasses don't have “First
Prize, won by > * >
“Jane isn't here to think, she's here
to work.”
This seemed to be a distinction
drawn between Jane and me.
“You see what I mean,” I said,
“don’t you? It's very difficult to
cup round, fill a pipe, light it and sit
down to work every morning. Any-
thing regular soon gets taken for
granted. And yet I was annoyed. I
think it was the silliness of standing a
First Prize upside down which annoyed
me. That and the apparent difficulty
of getting into communication with
Jane about it.
For it was difficult. One day I went
very humbly to Celia and said—
“I know I'm a baby about it. For-
give me. But it's getting on my mind.
Do tell Jane about the cup.”
“It's awfully hard,” she said, after
a little thought. “You see, it's such a
very, very small thing that it never
seems quite the right moment for it.
And if, after I'd told her, she said
‘What?' I couldn't possibly say it
again.”
“You must be very articulate the
first time. Lead the conversation
slowly round to long-jumping or the
difficulty of reading on your head, and
then casually but articulately * >
“Well, we'll see,” said Celia. “Of
course, if I ever caught her doing it, I'd
tell her. Perhaps I shall.”
Well, we saw. We saw that the
thing still went on. The direct ap-
proach to Jane was evidently impos-
sible. So I tried sarcasm.
Sarcasm, directed into the blue in
the hope of hitting the person you
want, may not be effective, but it does
relieve the feelings. I had a thoroughly
sarcastic morning all to myself. My
deadly irony took the form of turning
everything in the library upside-down.
The cup was in position already; I
turned up two pewter mugs (third
prizes in Consolation Races), the flower
bowls, the cigarette box, the lamp, a
stool, half-a-dozen pictures, two photo-
graphs and the mahogany clock. They
all stood on their heads and sneered at
Jane. “Why don't you do the thin
properly while you're about it?” they
said to her. I felt extremely well after
I had finished.
Celia stood in the door and gurgled
to herself.
“You baby,” she smiled.
“On the contrary,” I said, “I have
made a dignified yet subtle protest,
You wouldn't move in the matter so I
that a sense of her past silliness will
rush over Jane like a flood when she
comes in here to-morrow morning.”
“If Jane's flooded at all,” said Celia,
“it will be with the idea that the
master's mad. But I don't think
she'll notice it particularly.”
Next morning everything was right
side up again—except the cup.
“It's no good,” I told Celia; “she
is obviously determined. Perhaps it
means more than we think to her to
have that cup upside-down. Its beauty,
the memories it brings back, the sym-
bolism of it, these things touch some
hidden spring. . . Still I am master
in my own house.” And I turned the
cup round again. . .
Another month passed and I could
bear it no longer. Yesterday I made
up my mind. I would speak to Jane
myself. I turned my First Prize the
right way up, and then looked for
elia. -
“Celia,” I said firmly, “where is
Jane?”
“She's gone out,” said Celia softly.
“Her—her man goes off to-day.”
An hour later, with bands playing
and people cheering, they wheeled out
of barracks, brown and businesslike.
Jane was in the front somewhere,
waving her handkerchief—not such a
silly Jane, after all. And at the back,
very proud for her, Celia and I stood
silent, with a something in the throat
that had come there suddenly. . . .
And this morning the cup was up-
side-down again. Well, well, if she
likes it that way, that way let it be.
But take warning, O Jane When
your man—here's luck to him!—comes
back, then I shall assert myself once
more. My cup, “Long Jump, 1739.
First Prize,” shall stand the right way
up; either that or you leave my service.
I am determined about this. .
Meanwhile we can share the daily
paper. A. A. M.
“Dear Mr. Punch,--You may re-

through loss of work. All gifts to the National Relief

II.--THE IsLAND CUP RACE.
Cowes week was drawing near to
its brilliant climax. Through the blue
waters of the Solent a swarm of palatial
steam yachts, saucy outriggers, graceful
cutters and wasp-like motor boats
jostled one another in their efforts to
gain safe anchorage after the strenuous
excitement of the day's racing. Every-
where could be heard the clank of
mooring chains, mingled with the full-
flavoured oaths of sailor men.
Gradually silence fell upon the scene,
broken only by the melodious murmur
of numberless gramophones and the
$9ſt strains of the band of the Royal
Yacht Squadron.
As the sun descended lower beneath
the horizon the dusk deepened, and
presently thousands of Chinese lanterns
twinkled through the gloom from mast
and yard-arm. Lady Margaret Tamer-
ton, leaning idly against the barnacle of
her brother's yacht, the Seamaid, drank
in the beauty of the night with deep
inhalations.
The voice of young Lord Tamerton
at her side at last broke the spell of
silence.
“Madge,” he said softly, “Wonderson
has not yet arrived. If he doesn't
$ome, our chances of winning the
Island Cup to-morrow are practically
hopeless.”
“Don’t worry, Fred,” replied Lady
Margaret. “Ralph never fails . .
Listen, he is coming now.”
And, indeed, the muffled beat of
oars was heard approaching from the
darkness. Soon a slim white boat
came gliding up to the prow of the
Seamaid. Ralph Wonderson, a tall
athletic figure in his immaculate flannels
and straw boater, poised himself on
the gunwale, gathered himself for a
spring, and leaped with the agility of
a cat to the bowsprit of the yacht.
Sliding rapidly down this, he nodded
easily to Lord Tamerton and clasped
the beautiful figure of Lady Margaret
in his arms.
“S-sh!” he whispered warningly,
laying his fingers on her lips, as she
would have spoken. “Nobody must
know I am here till to-morrow. That
is why I came aboard like that. Listen.
Your cousin, Sir Ernest Scrivener, alias
Marmaduke Moorsdyke, is here, and is
plotting to kidnap you. There is a
traitor somewhere on this yacht who
supplies him with all information. The
attempt is to be made to-night.”
“To-night !” murmured Lady Mar-
garet in horror. “What am I to do?
His ingenuity is dev–er—fiendish.”
“It shall be baffled,” replied Ralph
reassuringly. “I have thought it all
out. It would be dangerous for you to
leave the yacht because, in view of
to-morrow's race, neither your brother

. |only one place on board where you can

“The crow's-nest,” repeated Lady
Margaret, clapping her hands. “What
fun! I shall be rocked to sleep beauti-
fully, and of course they will never
think of looking for me there.”
“Come,” said Ralph, taking her
hand. “There is no time to lose, and
none of the crew must be allowed to
see you. We don't know whom we
can trust.”
Snatching her in his arms, he carried
her easily up the frail rigging, his
mountain training showing in every
step he took. Five minutes later he
returned alone and dropped noise-
lessly to the deck. He looked round
cautiously; there was nobody in view
except Lord Tamerton.
“It's all right, Fred,” he whispered.
“Let us turn in.”
They descended the broad staircase
arm-in-arm. No sooner had they dis-

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“For Nuts.”—The origin of this
curious phrase to indicate incompetence
in any pursuit or pastime--c.j., " He
can't play for nuts,” etc.-is obscure;
but its antiquity is incontestable. Thus
one of the fragments of Eynius runs:
“Nucibus non luciere possum." Perhaps
the most plausible theory is that which
views the phrase as a heritage from our
simian ancestors, amoog whom nuts
were the common medium of exchange.
On this assumption a monkey-whether
gorilla, chimpanzee, baboon or orang-
utan- who was described as unable to
do anything " for nuts," i.l., for pe-
cuniary remuneration, was obviously
inefficient. Another explanation, which
we believe is supported by Mr. EUSTACE
Miles, scouts the notion of an ancient
origin of the phrase and fixes the
terminus a quo by the recent intro-
duction of vegetarian diet. Nuts being
a prime staple of the votaries of this
cult, a person who cannot do anything
"for nuts" means, by implication, a
carnivorous savage who is incapable of
progress. Lastly, there remains the
ingenious solution that the phrase as
commonly employed involves a mis-
spelling. It ought to be “four nuts,"
and playing four nuts was an ancient
but simple game, which may be con-
nected with the cognate phrase about
knowing or not knowing “how many
beans make five."

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
“For NUTs."—The origin of this
curious phrase to indicate incompetence
in any pursuit or pastime—e.g., “He
can't play for nuts,” etc.—is obscure :
but its antiquity is incontestable. Thus
one of the fragments of ENNIU's runs:
“Nucibus non ludere possum.” Perhaps
the most plausible theory is that which
views the phrase as a heritage from our
simian ancestors, among whom nuts
were the common medium of exchange.
On this assumption a monkey—whether
gorilla, chimpanzee, baboon or orang-
utan—who was described as unable to
do anything “for nuts," i.e., for pe-
cuniary remuneration, was obviously
inefficient. Another explanation, which
we believe is supported by Mr. EUSTAcE
MILEs, scouts the notion of an ancient
origin of the phrase and fixes the
terminus a quo by the recent intro-
duction of vegetarian diet. Nuts being
a prime staple of the votaries of this
cult, a person who cannot do anything
“for nuts” means, by implication, a
carnivorous savage who is incapable of
progress. Lastly, there remains the
ingenious solution that the phrase as
commonly employed involves a mis-
spelling. It ought to be “four nuts,”
and playing four nuts was an ancient
but simple game, which may be con-
nected with the cognate phrase about
knowing or not knowing “how many
beans make five.”
Polly PERKINs: WAS SHE A REAL
Persos?—A careful search in the regis.
ters of Paddington in the early and
mid-Victorian period reveals so many
Mary Perkinses as to render the task
of identification peculiarly difficult. It
will be remembered, however, that the
heroine of the famous ballad is described
as not only “little,” but “pretty;”
indeed, she is spoken of as being “as
beautiful as a butterfly and as proud as
a queen.” So far, however, these clues
to her appearance have yielded no solid
results. The representatives of the
famous family of brewers have been
unable to throw any light on the sub-
ject, and an application to the managing
director ºf the London and General
Omnibus Company has also proved un-
productive. (Polly Perkins “married
the conductor of a twopenny 'bus.”)
Her brilliant appearance suggests a
possible relationship with Dr. PERKINs,
the famous pioneer of the aniline dye
industry; but this, as well as the theory
that she was a descendant of PERRIN
WARBECK, is mere surmise.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. DoRNFord YATEs, whose name I seem to recall as a
contributor to the magazines, has written a book of the
most agreeable nonsense which he has called The Brother
of Daphne (WARD, Lock). For no specially apparent
reason, since Daphne herself plays but a small part in the
argument, which is chiefly concerned with the brother and
his love affairs. This brother, addressed as Boy, was a bit
of a dog, and an uncommonly lucky dog at that. The
adventures he had He apparently could not go out for
the simplest walk without meeting some amiable young
woman, divinely fair and supernaturally witty, with whom
he presently exchanged airy badinage and, towards the
end of the interview, kisses. What distressed me a little
at first, till I tumbled to the spirit of the thing, was the
discovery that the charmer was always a fresh one, and in
consequence that these osculations had, so to speak, no
matrimonial significance. Perhaps, however, Boy recognised
an essential similarity in each of his partners. He may,
for example, have been deceived by the fact that they all
talked exactly the same Dolly dialogue—light, frothy and
just a little more neatly turned than is the common inter-
course of mortals. You know the kind of speech I mean.
It is vastly pleasant and easy to read; but I must decline
to believe that any young man could have the amazing
fortune to meet fifteen pretty girls who all had the trick of
it. Still, that by no means lessened my enjoyment of an
entertaining volume, notice of which would be incomplete
WILMSHURST, a favourite black-and-white artist of mine,
whose name is unaccountably omitted from the title-page.
If DoRothea CoNYERs knew as much about English
syntax as she does about Irish, and were as certain in the
handling of a story as she is in the conduct of a horse,
Old Andy (METHUEN) might be taken at a single refreshing
gallop. As it is, I advise the reader to tackle it piecemeal,
a brisk run here and there, followed by a considerable
breather. For the novel is put together in a scrambling
fashion, being full of repetitions of almost identical scenes
and making very little definite way in a forward direction.
There are the usual Irish peasantry and farmers who
worship the horse for pecuniary and sentimental reasons,
as the Israelites worshipped the golden calf; the usual
hunting people, who either ride straight and are grimly
sarcastic or talk very big and go for the gates; and the
usual English visitors, who astound by their guilelessness
and simplicity when confronted by aboriginal horse-copers
and native bogs and stone-walls. If cubbing be included,
I should be afraid to say how many meets are described in
this book, or how many hunt-breakfasts and heavy teas in
Irish interiors—interiors of cottages, of course, I mean—
resulting in how many tricky deals and harmless tosses
in the heather and the mud. But if you follow my lead
there is plenty of pure joy in Old Andy, and the most and
the best of it perhaps is to be found in the remarks of
grooms, servant-girls and casual country folk, who as often
as not have no kind of connection with the thread of the
tale. “‘If meself an' the Masther wasn't rowlin’ rocks all

A DETERMINED ISLAND.
III. August 19th.
DURING this season of splendid weather you may be sure
that we in Totland Bay have not been idle. We swim,
men, women and children, and we perform great feats of
diving from the moored rafts which the authorities have
kindly provided for that purpose. And we toil off on the
usual picnic parties and inhale great draughts of health as
we lie on our backs on the heather-clad slopes of the hill.
But even while we pursue these simple pleasures our
thoughts are with the great warships in their, ceaseless
vigil in the North Sea or with the gallant fellows who
slipped away under cover of the night and are now taking
their place in the fighting line with our French and
Belgian friends. England, too, it seems, can perform a great
operation of war on sea and land, and can do it with d
swiftness, a precision and a silence that no other nation
could surpass. So we hold our heads high and are proud
to reckon ourselves the fellow-countrymen of JELLIcob
and KitchENER. We have begun well. May, we have
strength and resolution to endure without faltering to
the end. - - -
I am glad to say that the sewing brigade, which, I
All good female Islanders are busy about the manufacture
of pyjamas for the soldiery. One of the marks of patriotism
amongst our ladies is the possession of a pair of pyjama
legs. No picnic party is complete without them. When
the men light their cigarettes the women bring out their
pyjamas and add stitch upon stitch. Pyjama legs are
awkward things in a breeze, being apt to flap about,
but they are resolutely tucked round arms or otherwise
restrained, and the needle continues its deſt work in spite
of all difficulties. Pyjama jackets, too, are of course made
in the proper number, but they are not so dramatic in their
movements as the legs, and I have not noticed them so
much. -
I revert once more to KITCHENER's triumphant feat in
transporting our army to France. We are not very far
from Southampton, whence some of the troops must have
sailed, but beyond the merest vague rumours we heard
nothing. One lady, a fortnight ago, had word from some
one that a Belgian padre had seen trucks full of British
soldiers in Belgium. A gentleman had heard from a school
friend of his daughter that motor-'buses of the General
Omnibus Company had been seen in Brussels in all their
bravery of scarlet, apparently bound (if their painted an-
nouncements might be trusted) for Cricklewood via Brussels
with a full complement of soldiery and stores. Another
lady knew, she said, that her nephew, an officer, had
already sailed for an unknown destination. These were
the reports, and they left us all guessing. -
I am still in trouble about my tame alien, the children's
maid, Maria Hasewitz. Her permit, obtained at Newport
with some labour, authorises her to reside at Totland, but
not to move more than five miles from the limits of that
place. Having decided to leave Totland with family and
household on Monday I have suddenly been brought up
against the stone wall of Maria's alienship. It was
obviously necessary to secure permission for this forlorn
German girl to travel home with us. The idea of dropping

OUR WAR MAP.
I HAVE bought a war map. My
newspaper told me to, and I did. It
came yesterday with a host of little
coloured flags on pins.
Helen and I surveyed it critically.
“Why, it's only an ordinary map of
Europe,” she said disgustedly.
“It won't be,” I said, “when we've
stuck the flags in.”
I removed a picture and pinned the
map to the wall.
* First of all there's Belgrade,” I
said.
“Where?” asked Helen eagerly.
“Er, er—somewhere round here, I
know. . I do believe they've for-
gotten to put it in. . . .”
Gladys (who is only ten) found it
for us eventually, and we arranged a
very fine battle there with a river in
between.
The Meuse was easier. We infested
its banks with our hosts and fixed a
splendid array of troops all along the
Franco-German frontier. Next we
invaded Germany and Austria from
the other side with several Russian
armies and put some local troops to
meet them. Without boasting, I think
I may say the result was very pretty.
But to our dismay we found we had a
number of armies left. Helen said they
must fight somewhere.
“You can't keep all those troops
idle,” she said. “Look at the waste
of good material.” -
“That's true,” I admitted.
“Perhaps my newspaper can
help.”
It did indeed contain enough
rumours of battles to dispose of
all our flags and a few dozen
besides, but at the same time it
urged me to accept unofficial
statements with the greatest re-
serve. Mr. F. E. SMITH, it declared
(it was a Liberal print; such are
the vicissitudes of war) was the
only reliable authority. Helen
and I decided we could accept
information from him alone. But
Mr. SMITH gave us no help.
I was worried for the moment, I
admit; here were all these armies
left in the envelope with nowhere
to go to.
Then I had an inspiration such
as comes to a man but seldom in
a lifetime. The Fates should
decide.
I pushed the furniture out of
the way, led Helen to the other
side of the room, blindfolded her,
and thrust a British army into
her hand.
“The idea is to walk across the
German Bird. “I SEE IT DoCSN'T SAY ANY-
THING About EAGLEs.”
somewhere on the map,” I explained.
“Scandinavia and the Peninsula are
out of bounds until we hear further
from the KAISER, If you hit them you
have another prod.”
Helen planted her army near Moscow.
The Hohenzollern (megaphonically). “TAKE courage, My
BRAVE GERMANs. YoUR KAISER is PREPARED To sacrifice
I took a Servian flag and planted it in
the North Sea.
The game was very exciting while it
lasted. I consider that I won it by
placing a French force in the environs of
Vienna, an extraordinarily good move.
My newspaper would have been glad of
the suggestion, I am sure.
Gladys was handicapped by her
height, but, taking everything into con-
sideration, I think she arranged some
quite nice struggles in Sicily and the
Principality of Monaco.
Wilkinson came in after dinner. He
collects the latest rumours and edits
them really well. Usually Helen and
I find it wise to accept all his state-
ments without a murmur, but yesterday
I disagreed with him.
“I'm sorry,” I said gently, “but I
don't think you've got things quite
right. This is more like the position of
things at present,” and I waved my
arm in the direction of our war map.
When at last he regained speech he
made some remarks which might have
given offence to people less sure of
themselves than I.
“No,” I said, “I do know the flags
of the nations, and so does my wiſe.
But I must beg you to keep that
map a secret. You see, I have a friend
in the inner circle who has given me
some information of which the outside
world knows nothing. I can rely on
your discretion, I am sure.”
“Of course, my dear fellow.” He
seemed dazed and strangely silent.
He had one long last look at the
| map and departed muttering to
himself: “A Belgian fleet off
the Outer Hebrides | French
troops in Nijni Novgorod' . A
Montenegrin squadron menacing
Mitylene | | | "
It is strange how strong the
force of habit is. I went to the
| City as usual to-day. At lunch
I met Collins, who told me he
had it on very good authority
that there was an Austrian fleet
bombarding the forts along the
Mersey and that a combined force
of French and Russians had
crossed the Dutch frontier from
Arnheim and was advancing on
Berlin.
I hurried home to record these
new developments on my map,
and was compelled, through
shortage of flags, to displace the
|Servian fleet from the North Sea

The merchants sell their merchandise
All just as usual;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“THEY ALSO SERVE.”
JEREMY threw away the stump of his
after-dinner cigar and began to light
another one. -
“Where's the economy of giving up
smoking when you've got lots of cigars
in the house 2" he asked.
“Oh, Jeremy,” said his wife, “who
says you ought to ?”
“The Vicar. He only smokes one
non-throat cigarette a day himself. I
told him he ought to give that up, but
he said it was different. I say, it will
want rather a large soldier for that
shirt, won't it 2 " He sat on the arm
of his wife's chair and began to play
with the sleeve. -- -
“Jeremy, can't you find something
to do 2 ”
“Yes.” He went out and returned
with his golf clubs, which he began to
polish lovingly. “I think I shall have
a round to-morrow. If FRANCIS DRAKE
played bowls when the Spanish Fleet
was in sight, I don't see why Jeremy
Smith shouldn't play golf when the
German Fleet is out of sight.”
“I thought you said you weren't
going to till the war was over ?”
“I don't see why I shouldn't. Golf
keeps us fit, and it is the duty of every
Englishman to be fit just now.”
“But you really play golf because
you like it.”
Jeremy looked up at her in surprise.
“Really,” he said, “I don't see why
I shouldn't like doing my duty.”
“Oh, Jeremy' " sighed his wife.
“You know I didn't mean that.”
“I know exactly what you meant.”
He dropped his clubs and began to
pace the room. “You're filled with
the idea that the only way a man can
serve his country is by doing something
he absolutely detests. That's why you
made me a special constable.” He
stopped and glared at her. “A special
constable ! . Me!”
“Darling, it was your own ideº,
entirely.”
“You said to yourself, ‘There are
men who would make excellent special
constables—men with red faces and
angry moustaches who take naturally
to ordering other people about, men
who instinctively push their way into
the middle of a row when they see one,
men with a lust for gore, great powerful
men who have learnt ju-jitsu. But the
fact that they'd all rather like it shows
that it can't really be their duty to
join; they wouldn't be making a big
enough sacrifice. The men we want
are the quiet, the mild, the inoffensive,
the butterflies of life, the men who
would simply loathe being special con-
stables, the men who would be entirely
to yourself, you looked round and you
saw me.”
Mrs. Jeremy smiled and shook her
head at her husband, sighed again, and
returned to her work.
“And so now I'm a special constable,
and I wear a belt and a truncheon, and
what good do I do? Baby loves it, I
admit that ; Baby admires me im-
mensely. When Nurse says, “If you're
not a good girl the special constable
will be after you,' Baby shrieks with
delight. But officially, in the village,
I am useless . . . . . Oh but I forgot,
I arrested a man this morning.”
“Jeremy, and you never told me!”
said Mrs. Jeremy excitedly.
“Well, I wasn't quite sure at the
time whether I arrested him or he
arrested me. But in the clearer light
of evening I see that it was really I
who was doing the arresting. At any
rate it was I who had the belt and the
note-book.”
“Was it a German spy?”
“No, it was old Jack, rather drunk.
I arrested him for being intoxicated on
a bridge—the one over the brook, you
know, by Claytons. He put his arm
round my neck and we started for the
Haverley police-station together. I
didn't want to go to the police-station,
because it's three miles off, but Jack
insisted. . . . He had me tight by the
neck. I couldn't even make a note.”
“Wasn't he afraid of your trun-
cheon 2 ”
“My darling, one couldn't hit old
Jack with a truncheon; he's such a
jolly old boy when he's sober.” Jeremy
played nervously with his wife's
scissors, and added, “13esides he was
doing things with the truncheon
himself.”
“What sort of things?”
“Conducting the Marseillaise chiefly
—we marched along in time to it.”
A smile spread slowly over Jeremy's
face as the scene came back to him.
“It must have looked splendid.”
“How dared he?” said Mrs. Jeremy
indignantly.
“Oh, well, if you make your husband
a special constable you must expect
these things. I consoled myself with
the thought that I was doing my duty
. . . and that there was nobody about.
You see, we made a détour and missed
Haverley, and when we were nearly
home again he left me. I mean I
released him. You know, I'm not
what I call a good special constable.
I did what I could, but there must be
more in it than that.”
Mrs. Jeremy looked up and blew a
kiss to him,
“However,” he went on, “I dropped
in on him this evening and made him
“Well, there you are; you have done
some good.”
“Yes, but I hadn't got my truncheon
on then. I spoke as Jeremy Smith, Esq.”
He put a brassey to his shoulder and
said, “Bang,” and went on, “I should
be no good at all at the front, and
Lord KITCHENER would be no good
trying to paint my water-colours, but all
the same I scored an inner last night.
The scene at the range when it got
about that the President had scored
an inner was one of wild enthusiasm.
When the news is flashed to Berlin it
will give the GERMAN EMPEROR pause.
Do you know that the most unpatriotic
thing you can do is to make shirts for
the wounded, when there are lots of
poor women in the village who'd be
only too glad of the job 2. Like little
Miss Merton. And yet you think to
get out of it by making your husband
a special constable.” . . -
Mrs. Jeremy put down her work and
went over to her husband and knelt
by his chair. - -
“Do you know,” she said, taking his
hands in hers, “that there isn't a man,
woman or child in this village who is
idle or neglected or forgotten? That
those who wanted to enlist have been
encouraged and told how to, and that
those who didn't want to have been
shown other ways of helping? That
it's all been done without any fuss
or high-ſalutin or busy-bodying, and
chiefly because of an absurd husband
of mine who never talks seriously about
anything, but somehow manages to
make everybody else willing and good-
tempered?”
“Is that a fact?” said Jeremy,
rather pleased.
“It is. And this absurd husband
didn't understand how much he was
helping, and he had an idea that he
ought to do something thoroughly un-
comfortable, so he ordered a truncheon
and gave up golf and made himself
quite miserable . . . . and then put it
all on to his wife.”
“Well, why didn't you stop me?”
said Jeremy helplessly.
“I wasn't going to be a drag on you;
if you'd volunteered for a submarine I
should have said nothing.”
“I should be useless in a submarine,”
said Jeremy thoughtfully; “I should
only fall over the white mice. But I
really thought you wanted— Why
then,” he cried happily, “I might play
golf to-morrow, you think?"
“I wish you would,” said Mrs.
Jeremy. -
Jeremy took up his brassey and
addressed an imaginary ball. * * *

Division, becoming about sixteen thou-
sand. If we go on at this pace, we
shall be getting into the millions soon,
and then I think somebody's meals
must be overlooked. There's bound to
be some limit to the capacity of these
organizing people, although it certainly
hasn't appeared yet. They moved our
Brigade two hundred miles by train
with less shouting and fuss than is
usual with the single British family
mobilising for its seaside resort. Their
system of train-catching however is
worth mentioning. . .
Section Commanders were told to
have their section ready by six-thirty.
That was the order issued by us
Lieutenants responsible for half-com-
panies. We had been told to be ready
by seven o'clock, under a threat of
execution on the following dawn.
Hence the margin of half an hour.
We took our orders from our Captains,
who had them from the Majors, who
had them from the Adjutant, who had
them from the C.O., who had them
from the Brigadier, who had them from
goodness knows where. Every rank is
prepared to be shot, if need be, but
desires, if possible, not to have it happen
at dawn; so each officer, taking his
order from his superior, puts on his
margin before instructing his inferior.
The Brigadier came round this morn-
ing to have a look at a guard. He
found our one and only T. B. Ponks
was the order. “Eh 2" was the re-
sponse. “Where is the guard 2" asked
the flushed suite. “A dunno,” said
T. B. The suite was inclined to be
fussy, but our Brigadier is essentially
human. “Where are the other lads 2"
he asked genially. “They 'm in theer,”
said T. B., pointing to the entrance
with no particular enthusiasm. The
Brigadier and his staff made as if to
enter. “’Ere, you,” called T. B., now
galvanized into activity, “you can't go
in theer,” and he barred the way. We
have since been lectured on the elements
of military ceremonial, but at the same
time we have been asked to volunteer
as a unit for the fighting line if need
be. I think the Brigadier has his
doubts as to how T. B. and his sort
will impress the Allies, but feels quite
confident of their manner towards the
enemy. It was the same T. B. who, be-
ing sent by the magnificent Lieutenant
d'Arcy to summon Lance - Corporal
Brown, was overheard calling, “Hi,
Mr. Brown, d'Arcy wants yer.”
I must break off here, for I have had
an intimation from Private Cox that
now is my opportunity to see his bare
feet. A fortnight ago I might have
hesitated to accept this kind invitation;
to-day I insist upon his bringing them
along at once. In fact, my hobby in
life is other people's feet; I have fitted
a hundred pairs of them with socks
and with boots, and I have assisted per-
and the trimming of their excrescences.
What a fall from our intellectual
heights! But so it is with us, Bill; if
we can once get those boys' feet in
sound marching order, all the nice
problems of the human soul which we
used to canvass may go to the But
I suppose that I must reserve that
word for military use.
By the way, when the battalion was
asked to volunteer, the men only raised
one point. They didn't trouble them-
selves about the work or the risk of it,
but they wondered whether anybody
really would look after their homes and
dependants when the excitement had
died down a little. Their scepticism
may be due to a certain music-hall
comedian who used to declare as
follows:– “And if, gentlemen, this
glorious old country of ours shall
ever be involved in war, I know, I say,
gentlemen, that I know, there is not a
man in this hall to-night who will fail
to turn out and see the troops off."
But to-day things are different, and
these boys of ours, a noisy, trouble-
some and magnificent crew, need have
no fear about the homes they leave
behind them. -
Yours ever,

THE LIFE-SToRY of A WILD CAT.
Here is a true story of a wild stray
cat which I hope may interest your
readers. Some years ago I lived with
my parents (my father being a retired
manufacturer of artificial eyes) on the
banks of the river Dodder, near Dun-
drum. In the back-garden there was
an old summer-house, where we used to
store cabbages, disused kippers, Carls-
bad plums and other odds and ends,
and here a stray cat took up his abode
ºn an empty porter cask during the
latter part of January, 1901. He was
of some rare breed and very beautiful in
appearance—a blend between a mar-
madillo and a young loofah—but so
§§vage that no one dared to touch him.
During the cold months of the year we

drew with his claws, which were re.

mainly on roach, with an occasionai

Podder. One day early in April, 1902,

fantasias—came to the back door mºw.

glorious topaz eyes. But the extra-
ordinary thing about him was a gift that
he had for changing his colour. Thus
my uncle, an old Anglo-Indian who

wards Piffles invariably seemed to him

A FELINE PRACTICAL JokeR.
Last year I had a cat who, whenever
she was offended, used to go to my
bedroom and throw various articles out
of the window. I was constantly find-
ing purses, powder-puffs, artificial teeth,
safety-pins, hymn-books, etc., on the
lawn, and never suspected the culprit
until she was caught in the act.
She also had a habit of sitting on
the top of the front door and dropping
golf-balls on the head of the postman,
whom, either for his red hair or his
Radical opinions, she disliked bitterly.
She would eat and drink anything,
including ice-pudding and green Char-
treuse, and was always peculiarly cheer-
ful on Thursday evenings, when The
Scottish Meekly reaches our house.

FROM ANOTHER POINT OF WIEW.
It is a strange thing that, much as
Women have entered the writing lists
with men, there is one branch of litera-
ture which they rarely attempt. Take
away Mrs. BRowsING and CHRISTINA
RossETTI and you will scarcely find a
love poem by a woman, or, at any rate,
a love poem which takes the woman's
point of view, Probably many of the
most cherished sentimental songs which
wake the echoes of the drawing-room
and conservatory are the work of
Women; but they write as men. It is
always the masculine aspect which is
set before the public; the beloved is
always feminine, And yet marriage
statistics show that precisely as many
men have married as women. But
during the preliminary period of ex-
alted emotion any love poetry that was
written was written by the men,
Surely, as the advancement of woman
proceeds, and she adds territory upon
territory to her kingdom, she will re-
dress the balance and write love
poetry too.
A very few changes in certain of the
classic lyrics indicate how near the two
varieties of love poems can be : male
and female. Thus, why should not
“he” as well as “she” have dwelt
among untrodden ways? Why should
not “he” have walked in beauty like
the night? PoE wrote magically about
ANNABEL LEE; why should not one of
his female relatives, for example, have
written in a similar strain? Something
like this:—
It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a gentleman lived whom you may know
By the name of Hannibal Lee;
And this gentleman lived with no other
thought
Than to love and be loved by me.
Women must see to it that men do
not have it all their own way for ever.
LANDoR was moved to a perfect lyric
by love of Rose AYLMER. Is the fol-
lowing any less perfect 2
Ah! what avails the sceptred race?
Ah! what the form divine?
What every virtue, every grace?
George Aylmer, all were thine.
George Aylmer, whom these wakeful eyes
May weep, but never see,
A night of memories and sighs
I consecrate to thee.
George is of course not the only name,
nor is Aylmer. The adaptrix, however,
must be careful that the Christian
name is a monosyllable and the other
a dissyllable.
Again, in the following feminine ver-
sion of a Shakspearean song the name
is subject to alteration:—
Who is Bertie? What is he
That all the girls commend him?
Handsome, brave and wise is he ;
The heavens such grace did lend him
That he might admired be.
Examples might be adduced from
many poets, but two more will suffice.
A female TENNYSoN might have begun
a song in the following terms:—
It is the youthful miller,
And he is grown so dear, so dear,
That I would be the pencil
That trembles on his ear:
For 'midst his curls by day and night
I'd touch his neck so warm and white.

of love poets—Robbi E BURNs. Two of
his most famous songs might as well
have been written of swains as maidens.
Here is one in which in the most
natural way in the world lassie becomes
laddie, and Mary, Harry:-
Go, fetch to me a cup o' tea,
And take it from a silver caddie,
That I may drink a health to thee,
A service to my bonnie laddie!
The boat rocks at the pier o’ Leith,
Fu’ loud the wind blaws frae the Ferry,
The ship rides by the Berwick-Law,
And I maun leave my bonnie Harry.
Is that injured by the change? Not a
bit. And here is another in which we
have successfully introduced a variation
of the original name:—
Of a the airts the wind can blaw
I dearly like the west,
For there the bonnie laddie lives,
The laddie I lo'e best.
There wild woods grow, and

By mony a fleecy flock,

III.—THE FIGHT OF THE
CENTURY. PATRIOTIC !
A LEsson.”
For weeks past the press -
had discussed little but the coming
boxing contest between Smasher Mike
and the famous heavy-weight cham-
pion, Mauler Mills, for a purse of
£20,000 and enormous side stakes.
Photographs of the Mauler in every
conceivable attitude had been pub-
lished daily, together with portraits
of his wife, his two children, his four
maiden aunts and the pink-eyed opos-
sum which he regarded as his mas-
cot. Full descriptions of his training
day by day, with details of his diet,
his reading, his amusements and his
opinions on war, divorce, the clergy and
kindred subjects, testified to the extra-
ordinary interest taken by the public in
the titanic struggle.
But with regard to Smasher Mike the
newspapers were at a loss. The Daily
Flash indeed declared him to be the
son of a popular Cabinet Minister, and
triumphantly published photographs of
Downing Street, the Woolsack, the
Daily Rocket, on the other hand, de-
scribed him as a herculean docker,
discovered and trained by a syndicate of
wealthy Americans, and issued photo-
graphs of Tilbury Station, Plymouth
Hoe and the Statue of Liberty in New
York harbour. The fact remained that
the identity of the daring challenger
was a well-kept secret.
Mauler Mills was too experienced a
pugilist to be perturbed by the mystery
surrounding his adversary. The stakes
had been handed in, and the purse of
£20,000, in one pound-notes, had formed
a full-page illustration in The Trumpet,
with a photo of the Mauler eating
gooseberries inset. Content with this
knowledge, he trained faithfully and
well, treated the interviewers with great
courtesy, and publicly announced that

Smasher Mike would be knocked out
early in the third round by means of a
left hook to the jaw.
The betting on Mauler Mills was a
hundred to one.
Young Lord Tamerton was in des-
perate straits. The estate to which he
had succeeded at the age of ten had
been administered during his minority
by a fraudulent executor, who had
absconded to South America with his
ill-gotten wealth. Matters had since
gone steadily from bad to worse, and
the young peer was now face to face
with utter ruin.
An effort had been made to retrieve
the family fortunes by the marriage of
his sister, the beautiful Lady Margaret
Tamerton, to her cousin, the wealthy
Sir Ernest Scrivener, but the provi.
dential discovery that the latter was
already married under the alias of Mar-
maduke Moorsdyke had prevented the
been their implacable and relentless
enemy, and his desperate attempt to
kidnap Lady Margaret had only been
frustrated by the skill and courage of
the famous athlete, Ralph Wonderson.
Lord Tamerton was seated at a grand
piano, playing BACH and moodily re-
flecting on these matters, when Ralph
Wonderson himself entered the room,
vaulting lightly over piano and performer
as he did so. -
“What's the matter, Fred 2 " he
asked. “You look blue.”
Lord Tamerton dramatically threw
£8.4s. 6d. on the table,
“This morning I pawned the Island
Cup, which you won for us,” he said
bitterly. “That is the result, and that
is what stands between me and starva.
tion.” His voice broke, “And—and
between Madge and star-
ivation,” he added.
Ralph laughed gaily.
“I’m not rich,” he said,
“and if I were I don't
suppose you'd accept money
from me. But I came here

- - - A light step was heard
behind him, and a small hand stole into
his own.
“I would marry you,” said Lady
Margaret, “I would marry you if it
were only £7,000.”
As the lovers gazed fondly into each
other's eyes, a sinister figure emerged
from the grand piano and slipped out
noiselessly through the open door.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE heroine of Alberta and the Others (SIDGwick AND
JACKSON) was the eldest of an orphaned family of girls and
boys who were finding life a little boring in an English
village; and when an unexpected legacy made her mistress
of a couple of town lots in a place called Sunshine, in
Western Canada, nothing would content her but to emigrate
with the whole tribe—reinforced by a delightful Aunt Mary
and an animal known as the Meritorious Cat—to the Land
of Promise. The book is the history of how they got on
there. Naturally, from the circumstances of their start and
the giddy altitude of Alberta's hopes, you will be prepared
for its being, to some extent at least, a story of disillusion.
Miss MADGE S. SMITH, who wrote it, says that it is all
true; and indeed there is much in the tale that stamps it
as the outcome of personal experience. This being so, I
could wish that her attitude in the matter had been a little
less uncompromisingly English. In many ways the language
and general outlook of the daughter of an Oxford don will
no doubt differ considerably from that of a Canadian-born
inhabitant of a prairie township; but that is no good reason
for assuming an air of patronage. However, this defect,
though it exists, is not so pronounced as to spoil one's
enjoyment of an entertaining record, written, as the pub-
lishers say, “in high spirits throughout,” and having, I
fancy, just this much fiction mingled with its obvious fact,
that it ends with a general pairing off and the prospect
of three weddings—which seems, as Lady Bracknell ob-
served in a similar connection, “a number considerably
above the average that statistics have laid down for our
guidance.” But at least it is the amende honorable to the
From the cover of A Tail of Gold (Hodder AND Stoughton)
I gather with respectful interest that its author, Mr. DAVID
HENNEssex, recently won four hundred pounds with another
story in open competition. I did not read the story in
question, but in view of its satisfactory financial result I
may be permitted to express a hope that it was considerably
better work than the present volume. Let me be entirely fair.
A Tail of Gold has some pictures of Australian mining life
that are not without interest; but I am bound to add that
a careful and sympathetic perusal has failed to disclose any
other reason for its existence. The plot, so far as there is
one, concerns the chequered career of a certain Major Smart,
who seems to have been by no means all that a major
should be. Amongst other unpleasing peculiarities, he was
apparently possessed of a fetish that brought misfortune or
death to all who were associated with him. These results
were in the main involuntary; but it is only just to add
that Smart was not above assisting nature to take her
course. Thus, some years before the opening of the story,
he had deliberately buried one poor lady alive in a cave
containing sulphide of mercury. Never ask me why. I
am as muddled by this as I am over his further conduct in
leaving with the corpse every possible clue in the way of
letters and ciphers that could bring his guilt home to him.
In any ordinary novel he would have been convicted in a
few chapters; but A Tail of Gold wags (if I may use the
term) so leisurely, and its action is so much impeded by
false starts and repetitions and general haphazardness, that
there is no telling how long it might not have continued
but for the limitations of volume form. No, I can't pretend
I liked it much.

the charming women of the book are almost snuffed out by
two poisonous females, Lady Bollington and Lady Catherine
Chiltern. Indeed these ladies are a little too much of a bad
thing, and, not for the first time, I am left thinking how
wonderfully Madame ALBANESI's novels might be improved
if she could persuade herself to bestow an occasional virtue
upon her wicked characters. The heroine, Virginia, escaped
from the hands of one of the pair only to fall under the thumb
of the other. I must admit, however, that Lady Catherine
had some reason to be angry at having Virginia suddenly
dumped upon her as a derelict daughter-in-law. Why Brian
Chiltern married in haste and then left his wife to endure
such impossible conditions you must find out for yourself,
but I fancy you will agree that his delicacy of feeling
amounted to sheer stupidity. Nevertheless this story is
bound to be popular, and I should have had no complaint
to make if I did not feel that its author has it in her to do
better work.
Even readers to whom American humour is generally
a little indigestible may glean some smiles from Penrod
(HopDER AND Stoughton), provided that it is taken in
small doses and not in the lump. If this book were to be
considered a study of the normal American boy I should
cry with vigour, “Save me from the breed,” but as a fanciful
account of a thorough and egregious imp of mischief I can,
within limits, offer my congratulations to Mr. Booth
TARKINGTON. The triumph of Penrod lies in the fact that,
although he brought woe and tribulation to his relations
and exasperated his friends to the point of insanity, it is
nevertheless impossible to suppress an affection for him.

to be paid for leading an adventurous life, and showed not
the smallest signs of repentance. Yes, I like Penrod, though
I have not any great desire to meet him in the flesh. It
grieves me, however, that such a character as Mr. Kinosling
should have been dragged in by the heels. If fatuous
clerics are worth any novelist's attention they certainly are
not worth Mr. TARRINGto.N.'s, and the only effect Mr.
Kinosling had upon me was to fortify my conviction that
it is far easier to begin a book of humour than to finish it. |

Loud swells the roar of traffic in the street,
The motor-buses rumble on and wind
Their plaintive warnings as they come behind
Faint folk who dally, dazed by summer heat;
The reckless taxis seem a deal too fleet
To country cousins nervously inclined,
And raucous news-boys fret the curious mind
With spicy rumours of the foe's defeat.
But suddenly a hush falls everywhere:
Stopp'd is each taxi with its languid load,
And, as the City's silence deeper grows,
Only a barrel-organ churns the air
While Peggy (in the middle of the road)

THE AVENGERS.
(To our Soldiers in the field.)
Not only that your cause is just and right—
This much was never doubted; war or play,
We go with clean hands into any fight;
That is our English way;-
Not this high thought alone shall brace your thews
To trample under heel those Vandal hordes
Who laugh when blood of mother and babe imbrues
Their damnéd craven swords.
But here must be hot passion, white of flame,
Pure hate of this unutterable wrong,
Sheer wrath for Christendom so sunk in shame,
To make you trebly strong.
These smoking hearths of fair and peaceful lands,
This reeking trail of deeds abhorred of Hell,
They cry aloud for vengeance at your hands,
Ruthless and swift and fell.
Strike, then—and spare not—for the innocent dead
Who lie there, stark beneath the weeping skies,
As though you saw your dearest in their stead
Butchered before your eyes.
And though the guiltless pay for others' guilt
Who preached these brute ideals in camp and Court;
Though lives of brave and gentle foes be spilt,
That loathe this coward sport;
On each, without distinction, worst or best,
Fouled by a nation's crime, one doom must fall;
Be you its instrument, and leave the rest
To GoD, the Judge of all. .
Let it be said of you, when sounds at length
Over the final field the victor's strain :—
“They struck at infamy with all their strength,
And earth is clean again!” O. S.
HOW GERMANY CAME OFF.
(Extracts from a diary kept at intervals by a very special
correspondent in the Dardanelles.)
Goebe N arrives Dardanelles. Announcement of sale to
Turkey and of disembarcation of German crew.
Goeben still in Dardanelles. Having been disposed of to
Turkey, the ship again disembarced her crew.
Goeben continuing in Dardanelles, the disembarcation of
German crew, which was completed three days ago and
again yesterday, began again to-day and was carried out
successfully.
The Goeben still being at anchor in the Dardanelles, it
was decided to carry out a disembarcation of her German
crew on a scale surpassing all previous efforts.
The Goeben continues in the Dardanelles. Owing to the
remarkable expertness which her crew has acquired, it was
possible to carry out three disembarcations this afternoon.
The officer commanding, indeed, proposes shortly to issue
a challenge to ships of all nationalities for the Open Dis-
embarcation Championship of the World.
The Goeben remains in the Dardanelles. In response to
a pressing request from great masses of the Turkish popula-
tion, who have been unable before to witness the ceremony,
it has been decided again to disembark the German crew,
will be gone through at regular intervals of an hour through-
out the day. All the railway companies have announced |
cheap excursions, and there can be no doubt that these
disembarcations will easily surpass all earlier ones.
The German crew of the Goeben are agitating for an
eight-hour day.
Instructions having reached the crew of the Goeben to
return to Germany, a magnificent Farewell Disembarca-
tion took place last night. At its conclusion sympathisers
presented an illuminated address bearing the following in-
scription: “To the crew of the Goeben on the occasion of
their final disembarcation before leaving for the Father-
land.”
Later.—Arrival of the crew of the Goeben at Kiel. Great
popular enthusiasm. KAISER orders a Special Disembarca-
tion to take place before entire Fleet, a duplicate cruiser (in
the regretable absence of the Goeben) being lent for the
purpose.
THE TRUCE.
PEACE reigns in the club-house on the links. The young
men have nearly all gone, and Morris, our veteran “plus
two " member, who generally only condescends to go round
with the pro. and one or two choice players, is eager for a
match with anyone. Only you must play for five shillings
for his wife's branch of the Red Cross Society.
In the smoke-room over our pipes—cigars are considered
wasteful and bad form—the old conversational warriors
look at one another. I glance across at Sellars, a member
of that loathsome, I should say highly admirable, institution,
the National Liberal Club. It is not six weeks since I
denounced him as a pestilent traitor because he demanded,
for some reason that escapes me, the blockade of a city
called Belfast. And, if I remember, he alluded to me as
a traitorous tamperer with the Army. But now I praise
the admirable patriotism of John REDMOND; I eulogise the
financial genius of LLoyd GEORGE: I grow ſervid as I
rhapsodise about WINSTON.
Then Sellars interposes, “My dear fellow, why do you
forget the splendid abnegation of Sir Edward CARson 2
As for LLoyd GEORGE he may have done well, but hasn't
he AUSTEN at his elbow all the time? Talk about WINSTON
if you like, but, after all, he has only muzzled the German
fleet. F. E. SMITH has done a far more wonderful thing.
He has muzzled the British Press.”
Peace! It is wonderful. Only at the back of my mind
there is one sad thought which I strive to put away from
me. Suppose a General Election comes whilst the war is
still on. I, as a patriot, shall have to vote for the splendid
Government. It will be Sellars' duty and joy to support
our splendid Opposition. And, if we all act in the same
way, we shall have those wretched — what funny slips
one's pen makes 1 — those adorable Radicals back in power
for another five years.
But when the war is over and we see a free Europe I
promise myself one reward. The night when peace is pro-
claimed I shall seek out Sellars and tell him just what I
think about LLoyd GEORGE: and I haven't the slightest
doubt that he will celebrate the occasion by some venomous
abuse of Bon AR LAw.
You see at present we are handicapped; we are just
Englishmen.
Another Impending Apology.
“The first editor of Golfing was Mr. Thomas Marlowe, who
is now editor of the Daily Mail. On the other hand, there have
been several editors of GoLFING who have since risen to positions of

THE ATTACK ON GERMAN TRADE.
Those mistaken persons who main-
tain that “music has no frontiers”
have been sharply rebuked by the
patriotic action of the management of
certain concerts, who boldly opened
the season by expelling all German
music from their programmes. It is
All very well to say that this is con-
founding the Germany that we honour
and admire with the Germany of the
other sort, of which we have had more
than enough. The step has been taken
on the highest patriotic grounds, and
although the ban has been partially re-
moved since the season began, it is
clearly indicated that this conciliatory
attitude will only last so long as the
main German fleet continues to skulk
behind the defences of Kiel. If there
!s any aggressive movement, then let
it be understood that Tschaikowski's
!'athétique Symphony will be worn
threadbare by nightly repetition sooner
than that we should have any truck
Already the occupation of Brussels has
caused the scratching (at the very last
moment) of the Schuman N concerto.
Of course there is more in it than
meets the eye. If all German music is
eliminated there are bound to be pro-
digious gaps which must be filled up
somehow. Very well. The result can
only be a new state of activity in the
home composing industry. This is no
time for giving away secrets, but per-
haps we may be allowed to say that the
continued attendance last week of Sir
HENRY Wood at the offices of the
Board of Trade can only mean that he
too is taking his part in a comprehen-
sive and well-considered plan for making
war on German industries. Now is the
time for the native producer to get to
work. Germany must once and for all
be ousted from this market. There need
be no difficulty in obtaining samples,
and we look to British industry and
enterprise to do the rest.
We are not sure that neutrals should
be allowed into this thing. An excep-
but, apart from her, we should limit the
exotic features in our programmes to
the works of our allies in the field. It
might give a needed fillip to the national
music of Japan.
Bow it strikes our Contemporaries.
“Yesterday's cclipse of the sum was itself
eclipsed by the world shadow. Shortly after

quarters of the sun's surface and a violet haze

“Londoners did not permit the war to eclipse
the eclipse. The hawkers' cry, 'Smoked glass

a ready sale for the pieces of glass which

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FATAL GIFT.
PEOPLE say to me sometimes, “Oh,
you know Woolman, don't you?”
I acknowledge that I do, and, after the
silence that always ensues, I add, “If
you want to say anything against him,
please go on." You can almost hear
the sigh of relief that goes up. “I
thought he was a friend of yours,” they
say cheerfully. “But, of course, if * *
and then they begin.
I think it is time I explained my
supposed friendship for Ernest Mer-
rowby Woolman—confound him.
The affair began in a taxicab two
years ago. Andrew had been dining
with me that night; we walked out to
the cab-rank together; I told the driver
where to go, and Andrew stepped in,
waved good-bye to me from the window,
and sat down suddenly upon something
hard. He drew it from beneath him,
and found it was an extremely massive
(and quite new) silver cigar-case. He
put it in his pocket with the intention
of giving it to the driver when he got
out, but quite naturally forgot. Next
morning he found it on his dressing-
table. So he put it in his pocket again,
meaning to leave it at Scotland Yard
on his way to the City.
Next morning it was on his dressing-
table again.
This went on for some days. After
a week or so Andrew saw that it was
hopeless to try to get a cigar-case back
to Scotland Yard in this casual sort of
way; it must be taken there deliber-
ately by somebody who had a morning
to spare and was willing to devote it to
this special purpose. He placed the
case, therefore, prominently on a small
table in the dining-room to await the
occasion; calling also the attention of his
family to it, as an excuse for an outing
when they were not otherwise engaged.
At times he used to say, “I must
really take that cigar-case to Scotland
Yard to-morrow.”
At other times he would say, “Some-
body must really take that cigar-case
to Scotland Yard to-day.”
And so the weeks rolled on . . .
It was about a year later that I first
got mixed up with the thing. I must
have dined with the Andrews several
times without noticing the cigar-case,
but on this occasion it caught my eye
as we wandered out to join the ladies,
and I picked it up carelessly. Well,
not exactly carelessly; it was too heavy
for that.
“Why didn't you tell me," I said,
“that you had stood for Parliament and
that your supporters had consoled you
with a large piece of plate? Hallo,
“Oh, that ?” said Andrew. “Is it
still there 2"
“Why not ? It's quite a solid little
table. But you haven't explained why
your constituents, who must have seen
your name on hundreds of posters,
thought your initials were E. M. W.”
Andrew explained.
“Then it isn't yours at all?" I
said in amazement.
“Of course not.”
“But, my dear man, this is theft.
Stealing by finding, they call it. , You
could get"—I looked at him almost
with admiration—“you could get two
years for this;" and I weighed the
cigar-case in my hand. “I believe
you're the only one of my friends who
could be certain of two years,” I went
on musingly. “Let's see, there's * >
“Nonsense,” said Andrew uneasily.
“But still, perhaps I'd better take it
back to Scotland Yard to-morrow.”
“And tell them you've kept it for a
year? They'd run you in at once.
No, what you want to do is to get rid
of it without their knowledge. Put
how—that's the question. You can't
give it away because of the initials.”
“It's easy enough. I can leave
it in another cab, or drop it in the
river.”
“Andrew, Andrew,” I cried, “you're
determined to go to prison' Don't
you know from all the humorous articles
you've ever read that, if you try to lose
anything, then you never can 2. It's
one of the stock remarks one makes
to women in the endeavour to keep
them amused. No, you must think of
some more subtle way of disposing
of it.” -
“I’ll pretend it's yours,” said Andrew
more subtly, and he placed it in my
pocket.
“No, you don't,” I said. “But I
tell you what I will do. I'll take it
for a week and see if I can get rid of it.
If I can't, I shall give it you back and
wash my hands of the whole business
—except, of course, for the monthly
letter or whatever it is they allow you
at the Scrubbs. You may still count
on me for that."
And then the extraordinary thing
happened. The next morning I re-
ceived a letter from a stranger, asking
for some simple information which I
could have given him on a post-card.
And so I should have done—or possi-
bly, I am afraid, have forgotten to

He came. I gave him all the infor-

Whether he was a pleasant sort of
person or not I hardly noticed ; I was
so very pleasant myself.
He returned my enthusiasm. He
asked me to dine with him the follow-
ing week. A little party at the Savoy
—his birthday, you know.
I accepted gladly. I rolled up at the
party with my little present . . . a
massive silver cigar-case . . . suitably
engraved. -
So there you are. He clings to me.
He seems to have formed the absurd
idea that I am fond of him. A few
months after that evening at the Savoy
he was married. I was invited to the
wedding—confound him. Of course I
had to live up to my birthday present;
the least I could do was an enormous
silver cigar-box (not engraved), which
bound me to him still more strongly.
By that time I realised that I hated
him. He was pushing, familiar, every-
thing that I disliked. All my friends
wondered how I had become so intimate
with him . -
Well, now they know. And the orig-
inal E. M. W., if he has the sense to read

THE WATCH DOGS.
II.
DEAR CHARLEs, Another letter from
the back of the front for you. You will
be glad to hear that your Terrier is
settling down in his temporary kennel
and sharpening his teeth in due course.
The time will come when you may look
your gift dog in the mouth and be not
disappointed, we hope, by the view.
We received orders a day or two ago
to take up our beds and walk; that is,
a couple of officers and a hundred odd
of the men were told off to execute
a flank movement on a neighbouring
township where there is a range, and
do our damnedest with the poor old
targets. So we put our oddments in
our pillow-case, rolled up our bedrooms
into a convenient bundle and trekked.
We were assured that we should be
back at our base within the week, but
we have learnt to take no chances. We
have but one form of movement, the
tout ensemble. ** -
It is quite refreshing to step, over a
hundred strong, into a village with no
pre-arranged scheme of board and
lodging. Like every other wanderer in
a strange part, we turn first to the
policeman. We march towards him
at attention; we call a halt at the base
of his feet, and then, with the courtesy
of the gentleman and the brevity of
the soldier, we inform him that we
have arrived. The next development
is up to him.
It is not to him, however, that we
owe our temporary rest. It is to that
irrepressible and indefatigable unit, the
Boy Scout. Charles, I believe we'd all
be lying out in the rain at this moment
but for that assistance. The equip-
ment of the Boy Scout on billeting
duty consists of a piece of white chalk
and a menacing demeanour. Thus
armed, he knocks at every likely door,
wishes the householder a good morning
and registers on the door-frame the
number of men that may be left till
called for within, even while the police-
man is still endeavouring to explain
the international situation and the
military exigencies to the slow-thinking
rustic. Many formidable obstacles lie
in our path, we know, but we are com-
forted by the thought that the Boy
Scout isn't one of them. If, in the
next generation, Britain continues to
exist as a nation and not as a depôt for
the training of waiters in the Berlin
restaurants, then indeed we shall have
something to rely on in these adaptable
young fellows.
The host upon whom we officers
were thrust was quite polite as long as
our Boy Scout stood by, but, left to
himself, turned out crusty. He was
rather too old to turn into the perfect
hotel proprietor all in a minute, and, as
he put it, “he couldn't see his way" to
do this and that for us. He was pre-
pared to do all he had to do, but no
more. Unfortunately we were not as
well up in the regulations as our youth-
ful and now departed protector. So
we went out and did a bit of billeting
on our own. It is an odd experience,
this knocking at somebody's door and,
upon being asked what one has come
for, answering, “To stay.” For our-
selves we thought that the Rector would
be a good man to experiment on.
These parsons are used to being victim-
ised and are known not to be too harsh
upon the delinquent. So off we went
to the Rectory, significantly handling |
our hilts and twirling our military
stubbles. But the essence of war is
surprise, and it was the Rector's wife
who confronted our attack. - .
I said, upon enquiry, that I couldn't
|
say what we wanted but placed myself
unreservedly in my colleague's hands.
I then took a pace to the rear and
prepared to retire in good order.
Robertson's whole efforts were con-
centrated on refraining from taking off
his cap, as behoves a gentleman, but
not an officer, and the Rector's wife re-
mained amiable but on the defensiyé.
Charles, our position was a hopeless
one and our careers had concluded then
and there but for the arrival of the
ally. Boy Scouts are as tactful as they |
are forgiving; he accepted our explana- ||
tion and apology to himself and he
explained for us and apologised to the
Rector's wife. It was little he had to
say, for never was a less reluctant and |
more efficient billettee. This kind lady
has not only made our sojourn one
long series of simple luxuries, she has
been through the whole of our kit and
washed and repaired the lot. Think
what you may about the Church when
you are a civilian in affluence, but when
you are a soldier in distress turn to it
first for succour.
Lastly, a minor incident of a regret-
able nature. Halting on the march
yesterday for our transport to catch up
(our transport is known as Lieutenant
Pearson's Circus) I discovered one of
our dusty thirsty warriors having made
his illegal entrance into a public-house
by an emergency door. There he stood
with a glisten in his eyes and his hand
just about to grasp the pewter pot!
Out he went under sentence of death
by slow torture, and there was I left,
with a thirst such as I have never
before believed to be possible, alone
with a pewter pot, with the foam just
|
brimming over the top . . . alone,
unseen, undiscoverable . . . º
Your fallen Friend, HENRY.

LITERARY GOSSIP.
THE Autumn publishing season will
undoubtedly be affected by the war,
several firms having decided to withhold
most ... of their forthcoming books.
Messrs. Odder and Thynne, however,
being convinced that the reading public
cannot subsist entirely on newspapers,
have with great public spirit resolved
to publish their full programme, which
is unusually full of works of interest.
The foremost place in their list is
allotted to Principal Toshley Potts's
Volume of essays, which bear the attrac-
tive title of The Hill of Havering.
Principal Potts was recently hailed by
Sir Nicholson Roberts as “the Scots
A. C. Benson,” and this felicitous
analogy will, we feel sure, be tri-
unphantly vindicated by the contents

by the way is dedicated to Dr. Emery

cance is a volume of poems, entitled
Kailyard Carols, from the accomplished
pen of Mr. Alan Bodgers, whom Mr.
DAvid LY ALL, in a three-column article
in the Penman, recently declared to be
the finest lyric poet since SHELLEY, and
Mr. LYALL seldom makes a mistake.
Mr. Bodgers, it may be added, is the
sub-editor of the Kilspindie Courant,
and has a handicap of twenty-two at
the local golf club.
Very welcome also is the announce-
ment that Professor Hector McGollop
has undertaken to edit a series of
Manuals of Moral Uplift, to which he
will contribute the opening volume on
The Art of Unction. Other contributors
to the series are Dr. Talisker Dinwiddie,
Principal Marcus Tonks and the Rev.
Bandley Chadd.
In the department of fiction the most
remarkable of the novelties promised
by Messrs. Odder and Thynne is The
Nut's Progress, by Mr. EwAN STRAw.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Lords, Tuesday, Aug. 25.
—After fortnight's recess Parliament
meets again. Scene mightily changed.
At time of adjournment country on
brink of war. Now in thick of it.
Contrary to custom interest centred
in Chamber at this end of corridor.
Man of the moment is the tall strongly-
framed figure that enters on stroke of
appointed hour and marches with
soldierly step to Ministerial Bench.
This is Kitch ENER, Secretary of State
for War, primed with message from the
Army which, making its first stand at
Mons, had a baptism of fire that lasted
thirty-six hours.
With characteristic modesty the new
Minister seated himself at lower end
of Bench. CREwB presently arriving
signalled him to come up higher.
Accordingly seated himself next to
LEADER of House. Thence rose at half-
past four to make his maiden speech,
a deliverance effected under rarely
momentous circumstances. Brought
with him one of those “scraps of paper”
which the KAISER scorns when they
contain such trifling matter as a solemn
treaty with a neighbouring nation. On
this KitchENER, more at home on the
battlefield than in a place where a
man's business is to talk, had written
his speech.
It was brief, manly, simple. Made
haste to point out that, though associ-
ated with the Cabinet, holding high
office in the Government, his appear-
ance on the Ministerial Bench did not
imply that he belonged to any political
party.
“As a soldier,” he said, “I have no
politics.”
House startled to hear him add that
his occupation of the post of Secretary
of State for War is temporary. Terms
of his service are those of the recruits
for the new Army. He is engaged to
serve during the war. If it lasts longer
than three years, then for three years
only.
Faced by grim suggestion that the
war just opening may last for three
years, a deeper gravity fell over listen-
ing House. KirchENER pre-eminently
a man who knows what he is talking
about. And here he was in level tones,
unruffled manner, taking into account
the contingency of the war lasting
three years.
That this was no idle conjecture,
rather a well-thought-out possibility
intelligently provided for, appeared
when he went on to describe how the
contingency must be faced. The enemy
had already brought his full resources
after a succession of days like last
Sunday, must necessarily diminish.
On the other hand, whilst we have
put a comparatively small force afoot,
there is behind it, at home and in the
Colonies, a vast reserve which, dili-
gently trained and organised, will
steadily reinforce the fighting line.
In the course of six or seven months
there will be a total of thirty divisions,
continually kept up to full fighting
strength.
Nor was that all.
“If,” said the soldier-Minister, “the
war be protracted, and if its fortune be
varied or adverse, exertions and sacri-
fices beyond any already demanded will
ANOTHER “SCRAP of PAPER."
(K. of K.)
be required from the whole nation and
Empire.”
Ominous words increasing prevalent
gloom. At least satisfactory to know
that in his official communications
KITCHENER will always cheer us by
presenting to closest view the worst
that has actually happened or is possi-
bly in store.
Business done.—KITCHENER makes
his maiden speech.
House of Commons, Wednesday.—
No one looking in on House this after-
noon would imagine that the country is
engaged in an armed fight, issues of
which will in one direction or another
transform the aspect of Europe. At-
mosphere unruffled. “Business as
usual" the order of the day.
Pretty full attendance considering
House has with brief intervals been in
session since February and meets
again at what in normal times would
Treasury Bench at opening of sitting.
Having answered a few questions,
withdrew to his private room and was
no more Seen.
LLoyd GEORGE, left in charge, moved
through various stages series of emer-
gency measures.
On Currency and Bank Note Bill
question of design of new twenty-
shilling and ten-shilling notes came up.
Some disrespectful things said of it.
CHANCELLOR OF Exchequer admitted
its imperfection but pleaded that in the
hurried circumstances of the day it was
the best that could be done. Exception
especially taken on score that the
design made forgery easy. Here the
CHANCELLOR differed.
“I have been told by an expert in
these matters,” he said, with the pleased
air of one recalling the dictum of a
respected friend, “that the plainer the
design on a note the more difficult it is
to forge it.”
All the same the notes are to be
called in and replaced.
Business dome.—Second reading of
Bill giving Government blank cheque
for meeting expenses of war carried
without debate or division.
Thursday.—PREMIER'ssurpassinggiſt
of speech, equally concise and eloquent,
never more brilliantly displayed than
this afternoon. Proposed Resolution
conveying expression of sympathy and
admiration for heroic resistance offered
by the Belgian Army and people to
wanton invasion of their territory. In
speech that occupied less than ten min-
utes in delivery the PREMIER, himself
moved to loftiest pitch of righteous
indignation, touched deepest feelings of
a crowded House.
Referring to Great Britain's inter-
vention in “a quarrel in which it had no
direct concern,” he pointed out that the
country threw away the scabbard only
when confronted by necessity of choice
between keeping and breaking solemn
obligations, between the discharge of a
binding trust and a shameless sub-
Sel"W lence.
A deep-throated cheer approved his
emphatic declaration, “We do not
repent our decision.”
Cheers rang forth again when in
another fine passage he said, “The
Belgians have won for themselves the
immortal glory which belongs to a
people who prefer freedom to ease, to
security, even to life itself. We are
proud of their alliance and their friend-
ship. We salute them with respect and
honour. We are with them heart and
soul.”
Difficult to follow outburst of genuine
eloquence like this, delivered with
thrilling force. BoSAR LAw in equally

into the field. It was a maximum which,

now where are we all ? The
Flummery boys and ever so many
more of the party are at the front

body who could see things coming

Stella, Beryl, Babs and your Blanche
are all back in Town, and when we're
not taking lessons in nursing we're
sewing at flannel. I make Yvonne do
my hair quite, quite plainly, and I'm
giving my jewels to my country. I've
already given my dear collar of pearls.
I gave that first because I love it best
of all my jewels, because it can never

would raise a troop at his own

“wherever the fighting was
hottest,” I thought I'd not done
him justice. So I listened to
him and approved and encouraged
the plan. And then the storm
burst and we all scattered. The
other morning I met him in the
Park when I was taking my
early walk. He asked if I would
dine with him some evening at
the “Iridescent,” and I said it
was not a time for dining at
restaurants. “No,” he agreed,
“it certainly isn't now all the
Trench cooks are gone; and what
an idiotic idea this is about re-
ducing the number of courses at
dinner | Silly rot, I call it !”
I ignored this and asked,
“What about ‘Swankington's
Horse'?”
“Oh ! that's all off,” he said
huffily. “I wrote to the authorities
about raising the troop, asked what
State recognition I should get, and
enclosed a drawing of the hat I meant
to wear as leader—a ripping scheme,
turned up at one side and with a
bunch of feathers. All the answer I
got was a few brief words of acknow-
ledgment and a request to set about
it at once and report myself some-
where or other. Not a word of the
State recognition I was to receive,
and the drawing of the hat returned
with ‘Not approved' scrawled across it.
So I've chucked the
whole business. And
now don't let us talk of
that any more!"
I gave him my freez-
ing look (you've never
seen my freezing look,
dearest—it's terrible!)
and I said with a little
calm deadly manner
that I very, very sel-
dom use, “I’ve no wish
to talk to you of that—
or of anything else-
ever again.” And I left
him.

going to have the old castle taken
across in bits and set up again in
Pennsylvania; and he was taking all
the family portraits, the mausoleum,
the old trees in the park and the stags
at a valuation, as well as the village
itself with all its cottages and people,
in order that the castle might have its
proper setting out there. There were
two more things he wanted included in
the bargain—a village idiot and a
family ghost (“hereditary spectre,” he
called it).
Ah, my dear! all this belongs to the
happy old days of a hundred years ago,
when we were all three or four weeks
younger. The man from Pittsburg, so
far from being able to buy Blairbinkie,
hardly knows where to look for his
next meal, and as for shipping castles
and trees and mausoleums and village
idiots and family ghosts across the
Atlantic he only wishes he could get
himself across, even if he had to work
his passage!
Josiah is at the uttermost ends of
rubber-mines or oil-concessions, I'm
not sure which. I had a cable from
him the other day from a place that
began with “Boo" and ended with

He told me not to be anxious, that he'd
get back when and how he could, My
answer was, “Not anxious. Wherever
you are you'd better stay there, or you
may get taken prisoner by those
creatures, and then I'd never forgive
'ou ! ”
Talking of prisoners reminds me of
a rumour about the Bullyon-Bounder-
meres. They were cruising somewhere
in their new big steam-yacht when
war broke out, and now there's a
report that the enemy have taken the
yacht and turned it into a cruiser;
that the Bullyon-Boundermere people
are prisoners on board, and that
they're making her wash dishes and
forcing him to work as a stoker or a
bulkhead or some fearful thing of that
kind! This is not official, my dear,
but I give it you for what it's worth.

shut her up. “This is not a time to
think of cut or colour,” I told her.
“Myself, I shouldn't care how my

ODE TO JOHN BRADBURY.
(The new notes for £1 and 10s. are signed by
John BRADHURY.)
WHEN the Red KAISER, swoll'n with impious pride
And stuffed with texts to serve his instant need,
Took Shame for partner and Disgrace for guide,
Barned to the full the hateful traitor's meed,
And bade his hordes advance
Through Belgium's cities towards the fields of France;
And when at last our patient island race,
By the attempted wrong
Made fierce and strong,
Flung back the challenge in the braggart's face,
Oh then, while martial music filled the air,
Clarion and fife and bagpipe and the drum,
Calling to men to muster, march, and dare,
Oh, then thy day, John BRADBURY, was come.
John BRADBURY, the Muse shall fill my strain
To sing thy praises; thou hadst spent thy time
Not idly, nor hadst lived thy life in vain,
Unfitted for the guerdon of my rhyme.
For lo, the Funds went sudden crashing down,
And men grew pale with monetary fear,
And in the toppling mart
The stoutest heart
Melted, and fortunes seemed to disappear;
And some, forgetting their austere renown,
Went mad and sold
Whate'er they could and wildly called for Gold !
“Since through no fault of ours the die was cast
We shall go forth and fight
In death's despite
And shall return victorious at the last;
But how, ah how,” they said,
“Shall we and ours be fed
And clothed and housed from dreary day to day,
If, while our hearths grow cold, we have no coin to pay?”
Then thou, where no gold was and little store
Of silver, didst appear and wave thy pen,
And with thy signature
Make things secure,
Bidding us all pluck up our hearts once more
And face our foolish fancied fears like men.
“I give you notes,” you said, “of different kinds
To ease your anxious minds:
The one is black and shall be fairly found
Equal in value to a golden pound;
The other—mark its healthy scarlet print—
Is worth a full half-sovereign from the Mint.”
Thus didst thou speak—at least I think thou didst—
And, lo, the murmurs fell
And all things went right well,
While thy notes fluttered in our happy midst.
Therefore our grateful hearts go forth to thee,
Our British note-provider, brave JoHN BRADBURY |

THE COLUMN OF ADVENTURE.
Even The Times' “agony column,” my staple reading
during toast-and-marmalade, suffers from the all-pervading
war. Old friends have dropped out of the column on its
war march. No longer does the Young Gentleman yearn-
ing for the idyllic life call on the charitable to provide him
with a year of perfect ease, comfort and luxury. I had
hoped to meet him some day, to draw out his confidences,
perchance to edit his memoirs. “My Cheek is My Fortune”
would be a catchy title. But apparently the War has put
him out of business. The idyllic life has gone. Another
victim.
His place is being filled by the Sportsman, eager to be
up and shooting—partridges. “Either singly or with a house
party,” he offers. He asks only for board, lodging and
ammunition. These provided, he is willing to go for the
enemy all September and October. -
Another Sportsman, humbler in aspiration, is prepared to
specialise on rabbits. He is ready to continue the fight
until “Peace terms dictated in Berlin by Allies.”
There has also arisen the Professional Rescuer. He offers
to go abroad—for a cash consideration—and smuggle back
stranded relatives. He does not give particulars of per-
sonal appearance, but one may imagine him as essentially
Williamlequeuish—small dark moustache, super-shrewd
eyes, Homburg hat, a revolver in every pocket, speaking six
languages more fluently than the natives, and on terms of
intimacy with half the diplomats of Europe. He would
open his conversation with a casual: “The last time I was
chatting with the KAISER (I shall, of course, cut him in
future). . . .”
Another occupation has been called into being by the
War. It is that of Berth-Snatcher. He is apparently a
City man who has realised all his securities and invested
them in berths and staterooms on Atlantic Liners. These
he now offers “at a small bonus"—exact amount unstated.
Also interesting is the occupation of Amateur Adviser.
He has much well-intentioned advice to offer to all and
sundry: “To the War Office. It is hoped that something
is being done regarding,” etc. Or: “Japan, our Ally,
could easily lend us half a million men.”
Presumably the Amateur Adviser has been denied place in
the correspondence columns.
The Young Hungarian Nobleman, whose remittances
have been stopped by the war, is reminiscent of the original
yearner for the idyllic life. “Is supposed to be of good
appearance,” he states with obtrusive modesty. -
But the romantic halo around these young aristocrats is
rather tarnished by the Young French Wicomte. When he
advertises that he “would thankfully accept some clothes
from English or American gentlemen,” one suspects a snug
little second-hand business somewhere in savoury Soho.
From a letter in The Bristol Evening Times:—
“Only last evening I was passing through one of our main thorough-
fares, and saw seven or eight Territorials taking refreshment in a the

In fairness we reply, It is neither.

THE HEROES.
ONCE upon a time, many years ago
—how many I cannot say, but certainly
it must have been before the Christian
era—there lived a sublime Emperor.
After being for long the warmest, if
platonic, friend of Peace, and forcing
the world to listen to his loud protes-
tations of fidelity, he suddenly surprised
his hearers by declaring war.
It was shortly after the opening of
hostilities that he was seated on his
throne presenting awards of merit to
the bravest of his brave soldiers. The
hall was filled with martial enthusiasm,
and the memorable scene was one in
which splendour, animation and the
confidence of rectitude were equally
notable.
The Emperor's noble Vizier, to whose
massive mind treaties were of no more
consequence than waste paper, stood at
the side of his Imperial Master to act as
introducer of the gallant soldiers whose
exploits (with which the world was
ringing) it had been decided to reward
although so early in the campaign—
pour encourager les autres.
“The first decorations,” remarked
the Vizier, “are for deeds of signal
courage.”
He motioned to a stalwart warrior.
“This noble son of the Empire,” he
said, “with his own bow shot six non-
combatants within as many minutes.”
Loud cheers rent the air.
“Three of them,” the Vizier con-
tinued, “were women.”
Louder cheers.
“The cther three were old men over
seventy.”
Immense enthusiasm.
“This determined hacker-through,”
the Vizier continued, as another giant
stood forth, “shot an unarmed priest.”
More enthusiasm.
“And,” added the Vizier, “burned
his temple.”
Amid the plaudits of the flower of the
State the monarch affixed the cherished
tokens to the heroes' breasts. “My
Braves!" he exclaimed. “In the name
of the Fatherland I thank you.”
Another warrior stepped out and
saluted.
“And what, my friend,” asked the
monarch, “did you do?”
“Nothing, Sire,” he replied with
the unaffected simplicity of the man
of action; “I merely stamped on some
little children—twins, I think.”
“Two medals for that,” said the
Emperor with ready wit, and there was
not a wet eye as he placed them in
their proud position.
The Vizier, beckoned to a youthful
officer on whose lip the down was
Ear-Teuton (to landlady). “AcH ! MADAME, EET is ALL RIGHT! I vos ENGLEESH Now!

“ordered his men to trample down
some public flower-beds in the enemy's
capital.”
“Bravely done,” said the Emperor.
“A great and imaginative lesson. We'll
learn them to resist invasion 1"
Amid renewed demonstrations of
loyalty and fervour the Emperor
brought the proceedings to a close.
“Among so many deeds of valour,”
he said, “I find it impossible to say
which is the most splendid. All are
glorious. I am in a position to assure
you that Heaven is proud of you. The
Fatherland also is proud of you, and,
above all, I am proud of you. May
the blessings of Heaven continue to fall
upon our great, and merciful campaign
for the right !”
With these words the proceedings
terminated and the heroes hurried back
to the fighting line, eager to win more
laurels by similar feats of culture.
SIDELIGHTS ON THE WAR.
It is frequently remarked that the
present war will be far-reaching in its
consequences. The truth of this is
apparent from the following notices,
gathered at random from the column
of “Personal Paragraphs" which the
Editor of The Shrimpington-on-Sea
Gazette , publishes weekly, without
charge, thereby earning the reputation
of a patriot:— .
IN consequence of the present crisis
in the Money Market, Mrs. Pincham
desires to give notice that she hereby
disclaims, all liability for any debts
contracted by her at Bridge, and the
same will not be paid. -

to announce that, in consequence of
the perilous financial situation in
Europe, she will be forced to discontinue

originally kept a pawnbroker's shop in
Hamburg, where his name was Wilhelm
Guggelheimer, are merely the inventions
of malicious persons who are envious of
his property and social position.

(for a reason which still escapes me)
there was a sudden burst of clapping
when Aubrey Braxton announced that
he had received an “ultimatum" from
Suzanne. The latter part of the Second
Act is particularly well worked up, and
one remark of Aubrey's to Leslie Tar-
bolton brought down the house. (“You
are the sort of man who would go
to call on a sick friend . . . and eat
his grapes."). The Third Act is terribly
padded with things which are not really
funny, but it gives us an opportunity
of seeing a little more of Miss Lottie

previously been generous. (I love Miss

MR. PUNCH'S HOLIDAY STORIES.
III.--THE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY.
(Concluded.)
[SYNopsis of Preceding INSTALMENT:-
The great boring boom is at its height.
A fight arranged between Smasher Mike
and the famous heavyweight champion,
Mauler Mills, is arousing intense excite-
ment throughout the country. Nothing
whatever is known of the Smasher, and
the betting is therefore 100 to 1 against
him. Young Lord Tamerton is at this time
in desperate financial straits. His bosom
friend, Ralph Wonderson, who is in love
with his sister, the beautiful Lady Mar-
garet Tamerton, prevails upon him to
wager hearily on Smasher Mike, and
undertakes to put him in the way of ob-
taining a loan of £5,000 for this purpose.
Their conversation is overheard by an
agent of Sir Ernest Scrivener, alias Mar:
maduke Moorsdyke, who is the mortal
enemy of Wonderson and is plotting to get
Lady Margaret Tamerton in his power.]
The vast area of Corinthia was
crammed with eager spectators, whose
eyes were concentrated with feverish
intensity on the raised platform in the
centre of the hall. In the seats near
the ring, for each of which a hundred
guineas had been charged, sat the cream
of Britain's aristocracy, including Lord
Tamerton and Lady Margaret Tamer-
ton, for whom two tickets in a plain
envelope had been left that morning.
At last the preliminaries came to an
end and Smasher Mike, clad in a claret-
coloured dressing-gown with yellow
facings, crawled through the ropes and
went to his corner. As he raised his
face to the lights a murmur of amaze-
ment ran through the hall.
“It's IRalph Wonderson " . Lady
Margaret gripped her brother's arm
till the perspiration stood out on his
forehead.

presently into a burst of cheering as
Mauler Mills scrambled up to the plat-
form, wearing an electric-blue dressing-
gown with green facings and pink sash.
Ralph sat motionless in his corner,
watching his gigantic adversary with a
pleasant smile and softly whistling the
air of a popular song. At length the
referee leisurely entered the ring. As
he did so, Ralph gave a violent start
and Lady Margaret gripped herbrother's
arm till his teeth chattered. The
Ernest Scrivener /
Lord Tamerton stared up at the ring
with ashen lips. With such an official
in charge nothing but a miracle could
save Ralph Wonderson from being dis-
qualified in the first round. The House
of Tamerton was more utterly ruined
than ever.
But in thirty seconds Ralph, trained
in many sports to meet all emergencies,
had summed up the situation and
decided upon his course of action.
The gong sounded and the two
pugilists advanced warily towards each
other. Suddenly Ralph lashed out a
terrific right which, as he intended,
missed the Mauler by a foot. Unable,
apparently, to retain his balance, he
swung completely round , with the
impetus of the blow, and his clenched
fist landed squarely upon the referee's
jaw, Sir Ernest shot high over the
ropes and crashed down on the Dowager
Duchess of Cumbersea, whence he re-
bounded with terrible force into the
arms of the Marquis of Meltington.
After a brief delay all three were
removed to the hospital.
- The fight, under a new referee, was
in its twentieth round. Not a sound
could be heard beyond the shuffling of
the pugilists' feet and the thud of fist
on flesh.
Feinting with his left, the Mauler
clinched heavily with his right, but
Ralph foiled the attack with a clever
half-nelson. Again Mills swung his
right, and again Ralph parried the
blow, this time by sending his left to
the funny-bone and thus paralysing the
arm. He then dashed in and uppercut
his opponent severely on the occiput.
Mauler Mills staggered to the ropes, to
which he clung frantically in order to
preserve his balance.
A Savage roar went up from the
crowd, roused now to a pitch of frenzied
ºxcitement. “Now you've got him
Finish him Put him out. " they
shouted.
But Ralph, chivalrous as always,
drew back, bowed formally to his oppo-

Presently, after a courteous enquiry
and an assurance from the Mauler that
he was quite ready, the pair exchanged
a warm handshake and renewed their
combat.
Taking a deep breath, Ralph ad-
vanced with cat-like tread and flashing
eyes upon his adversary. Knowing
from painful experience what to expect,
the latter circled cautiously away,
covering his face with his hands. But
Ralph, realising that time was short,
determined not to be baffled. Com-
bining the agility of the chamois with
the ponderous strength of the hippo-
potamus, he crouched low and sprang
like a tiger through the air upon the un-
happy Mauler, striking him full on the
solar plexus. White to the lips, the
Ralph nonchalantly adjusted a lock of
hair which had floated loose.

The great fight was won. The House

Clad in his claret-coloured dressing-
gown, the new champion pressed his
fiancée against the yellow facings and
stroked her fair hair fondly with his
boxing-gloves.
“My little wife!” he whispered.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
FAR too rarely does the conscientious reviewer enjoy such
a chance as has come to me now, a chance to let himself go
in the matter of praise without stint or reservation. As a
reward doubtless for some of my many unrecorded good
deeds, there has come into my hands a slender volume
called Naval Occasions (BLAckwooD), which seems to me
to be the most entirely satisfactory and, indeed, fascinating
thing of its kind that ever I read. The writer chooses
for his own sufficient reasons to disguise himself as
“BARTIMEUs,” and under that name I have to ask him to
accept my very sincere gratitude. The little book contains
twenty-five sketches, mostly quite short, relating to (I quote
its text, taken from the Articles of War) “the Navy,
whereon, under the good Providence of God, the wealth,
do more, and, though my own experience of Irish terriers
has led me to think that they do not spend over much time
in the study of ordnance maps, yet for sentiment's sake,
and because His Love Story is a charmingly written
romance, I am ready to believe in all the feats of Pitchoumé,
and even to hope that he will not after all be de trop now
that M. le Comte is happily wedded, but may have another
brilliantly successful campaign in front of him.
Although Mrs. PENRose's new novel, Something Impossible
(MILLS AND BooN), gaily admits in its title its difficulties,
I cannot pretend that I consider her to have made the most
of her opportunity. There are at least two classic examples
of her theme, Mr. ANSTEY's Vice Versa and Mr. DE LA MARE's
Relurn. Mrs. PENRose cannot approach either the charm-
ing humour of the one or the delicate beauty of the other.
On a lower plane her story has its amusing moments, and

YE that have gentle hearts and fain
To succour men in need,
There is no voice could ask in vain
With such a cause to plead–
The cause of those that in your care,
Who know the debt to honour due,
Confide the wounds they proudly wear,
The wounds they took for you.
Out of the shock of shattering spears,
Of screaming shell and shard,
Snatched from the smoke that blinds and scars,
They come with bodies scarred,
And count the hours that idly toll,
Restless until their hurts be healed,
And they may fare, made strong and whole,
To face another field.
And yonder where the battle's waves
Broke yesterday o'erhead,
Where now the swift and shallow graves
Cover our English dead,
Think how your sisters play their part,
Who serve as in a holy shrine,
Tender of hand and brave of heart,
Under the Red Cross sign.
Ah, by that symbol, worshipped still,
Of life-blood sacrificed,
That lonely Cross on Calvary's hill
Red with the wounds of CHRIST;
By that free gift to none denied,
Let Pity pierce you like a sword,

“the supply of captured alien women and children is

“Then,” said the Commander, “we shall be forced to
confront the enemy's fire without the usual screen.”
“Why not advance under a flag of truce?” suggested the
Chief of Staff.
“I am loth to violate the canons of civilized warfare,”
said the Commander, “but really there seems no other way,

In an hour the answer arrived. The Commander tore it

the telegram over to the Chief of Staff, who read:—"Am

DIARY OF A KAISER.
Sunday.—To-day has witnessed another triumph for the
high-souled German army. Ten Belgian villages have
been burnt. Some of the inhabitants have been also burnt;
the rest have been driven out to starve. This will teach
Belgium not to build villages in the way of a possible
German advance. General von Schweinehund was in com.
mand of the noble German column. Have telegraphed my
supreme congratulations and have conferred upon him the
Iron Cross. How splendidly God is behaving in these days.
Monday.—It is stated that in East Prussia a village has
been burnt by the Russians during a battle. This is
monstrous, and must be stopped at once. Have sent a
protest to the TsAR and have telegraphed to neutral
countries pointing out that Russia is spreading barbarism,
whereas Germany is spreading civilisation and culture.
A reply has come from America; it contained only one
word—“Louvain.” That may be meant for humour, but
I do not understand it. The Americans must not forget
that Louvain was burnt by German troops, and that being
so there can be no complaint. Have told my Court Chaplain,
Dr. Meuchler, to draw the Divine attention to this infamy
on the part of the Russian Huns.
Tuesday.-Six Belgian mayors and five hundred selected
Belgian villagers have been shot by my gallant troops.
One of them had sneered at Lieutenant von Blutgierig as he
sat at breakfast. The Belgians are indeed a stiff-necked race,
but with God's help they shall be made to understand the
sympathetic gentleness of the German character. But to
sneer at a man in uniform is an inconceivable crime worthy
only of an Englishman. The lieutenant has had to go into
hospital to recover from this shameful treatment. He is
a true German and shall be rewarded.
Wednesday.--Ordered three cathedrals to be razed to the
ground. Forget how many ordinary churches have been
destroyed. All Belgian and French universities are to be
at once bombarded and burnt for failing to recognise
superiority of German intellect. Have just read noble
book by Professor Lumpenthor, who proves that CESAR,
HANNIBAL, ALEXANDER, Hoxier, VIRGIL, SHAKSPEARE,
NApoleoN, ATTILA and GENGHis IXHAN were all Germans.
He seems to fear that we modern Germans are too merciful.
This is no doubt true, for the Belgians are not yet reconciled
to us as their God-appointed masters.
Thursday.—Our wonderful navy continues its magnificent
deeds. Two Danish boats and an English trawler have
been sent to the bottom by mines in the North Sea. Have
commanded religious services to be held in all German
churches to thank God for all His mercies. -
Friday.—Have arranged everything with Turks, who will
shortly intervene with their army to help Germany to
spread civilisation and the Gospel. Hear that England is
about to use Indian troops. This, being an attack on
German culture, cannot be allowed. Unless something is
done about it shall countermand religious services.
Saturday.—Have ordered all remaining Belgian villages
to be burnt and inhabitants to be shot. This will please
my glorious troops. The Divine blessing is evidently on
Our cause.

[SEPTEMBER 9, 1914.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE TWO RECRUITING SERGEANTS,
Upstairs, Baby, after many false
starts, had finally settled into sleep.
Downstairs, the little maid, alternately
rattling knives against plates and saying
“S'sh" to herself, had cleared away
dinner. John, who had been strangely
silent during the meal, was in his deep
arm-chair, smoking. It was Mary's
peace-hour.
She lay on the sofa, for she was
always tired by now, reading the morn-
ing paper—her first chance at it. As she
read, she made little comments aloud,
as that the Germans were beasts, or
that it was splendid about the Russians
doing so well; and this was the signal
for John to join in with the latest
strategic gossip from the City.
Only to-night he didn't. He just
sat smoking and thinking . . . thinking.
“I suppose the French," said Mary,
lazily, “are going to- John'." She
looked across at him suddenly, re-
alizing all at once that he had answered
| none of her questions, knowing all at
| once that something was the matter.
“Yes?” he said, coming out of his
thoughts with a start.
“John, you—,” she sat up with a
jerk and craned her head forward at
him—“you haven't been dismissed ?”
She clenched her hands tight for the
answer. Sometimes at night, when he
was asleep and she wasn't, she would
wonder what they would do if he were
dismissed.
“Silly, of course not,” said John
with a laugh.
She gave a sob of relief and went
over and sat on his knee and put her
arms round his neck.
“Oh, John, I was so frightened.
But what is it? There's something.”
He smoked rapidly for a little. Then
he put his pipe down, kissed her, and
lifted her off his knee.
“I want to tell you something,” he
said; “but you mustn't look at me or
I couldn't. Sit down there.” She
curled herself up on the floor, leaning
back against his knees. “Mary”—he
swallowed something which had stuck in
his throat—“Mary, I've got to enlist.”
She was round in a flash.
“What do you mean you've got to?"
she cried indignantly. “That beast
going to make you?" The beast was
John's employer, a kindly man, whose
fault it was to regard John as one only
among many, a matter on which Mary
often longed to put him right.
“No,” said John. “But—but I've
got to.”
“Who's making you, then 2"
“I don't know . . . I suppose the
GERMAN EMPEROR really.”
you go. You've got a wife and a
child. Let those without go first.”
“I know,” said John doggedly. “I’ve
thought of that.”
She threw her arms round his neck
in a sudden passion. “You can't leave
me, John, you can't 1 I couldn't bear
it. Why, we've only been married
eighteen months. How can you want
to go away and leave me and bab
and Why, you might get killed !”
Her voice went up to a shriek.
“I don't want to leave you,” said
John, a strange, terrifying, rapid-speak-
ing John; “I hate it. I hate war, I
hate fighting, I hate leaving you—oh,
my God, how I hate leaving you, my
darling ! I've prayed to God all day to
stop the war before I have to go, but of
course He won't. Oh, Mary, help me
to go; don't make it harder for me.”
She got off his knee; she brought a
chair up opposite to him; she sat down
in it and rested her chin on her hands
and looked straight at him.
“Tell me all about it,” she said.
“I’m quite all right.” So he told her
all about it, and she never took her eyes
off his face.
“A man came into the office to-day
to talk to us about the war. The
Governor introduced him—Denham, his
name was . . . I knew he was all right
at once. You know how you feel that
about some people . . . He said he
thought perhaps some of us didn't quite
know what to do, and he wondered if
he could help any of us . . . Said of
course he knew that, if we thought
England was in danger, we'd all rush
to enlist, but perhaps we didn't quite
know how much England was in
danger, and all that England stood for
—liberty, peace, nationality, honour
and so on. In fact he'd come down to
see if any of us would like to fight for
England . . . Said he was afraid it was
rather cheek of him to ask us to defend
him, because that was what it came to,
he being too old to fight. Said he knew
some of us would have to make terrible
sacrifices, sacrifices which he wasn't in
the least making himself. Hoped we'd
forgive him. He couldn't say that if
he were as young as us he'd enlist like
a shot, any more than he could say that
if a woman jumped off Waterloo Bridge
on a dark night he'd jump in after
her. On the whole he thought it would
be much easier to pretend he hadn't
noticed. In fact that's very likely
what he would do. But if someone,
say the mother of the girl, pointed out
the body to him, then he'd have to come
to a decision. Well, he was in the
position of that mother, he had come
down to point out the body. He con-
fessed it wasn't the job he liked best,
save, but he was doing it because he
thought it might be of some service.
That was what we all had to realize,
that it was a time when we had to
do things we didn't like. “Business
as usual' might be a good motto, but
‘Happiness as usual' was a thing we
mustn't expect . . .”
John fell into silence again.
“What else did he say?” asked
Mary, still with her eyes fastened on
his face, as though she were looking at
him for the last time.
“That was how he began. I can't
tell you all he said afterwards, but I
felt as if I'd just fight for him, even if
there was nobody else in England . . .”
“Aren't there lots of people who
wouldn't mind going as much as you?"
said Mary timidly. “I mean men with
no wives or children.
to go first?”
“I suppose they ought. But, you
see, you'd never get anywhere like that.
A would wait for B who was married
but had no child, and B would wait for
C who wasn't married but had a
mother, and C would wait for D who
was an orphan, and so on. That's
what Mr. Denham said.”
“I see,” said Mary miserably.
“I don't quite understand what
we're in the world for,” said poor
John, “ or what the world's for at all.
But I suppose the great thing is that
—that good ideas should live and bad
ideas should die . . . I haven't done
much for good ideas so far, I'm not
the sort of person who could . . . just
one out of thousands of others . .
But I could do something for good
ideas out there. I could help beat the
bad idea of War . . . Mr. Denham
says if we win there's lots of men, all
the best and cleverest in the country,
who are pledged to see that there shall
be no more war. Well, that's what I
call a good idea . . . only we've got to
win first.”
“I know it sounds a wretched thing
to say, but what about money?" asked
Mary hesitatingly.
“Mother would take you in ; there'll
be enough to pay her something. We
might try and let the house.”
And then all the memories of sum-
merevenings and happy Sundays rushed
upon Mary and she broke down.
“Our little garden of which we were
so proud!” she sobbed. -
"The Belgians,” said John sadly,
“were proud of their little gardens."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WAR DECLARATIONS.
“No, I don't mean that at all,” said
my wife hastily. “You quite mis-
understand me. Of course everyone is
to have as much, quite as much, food
as he wants.” -
“Stop a bit. Does that mean as
much as he likes 2 " I asked.
“Or as much as his system requires?”
suggested the Reverend Henry.
“Or as much as he can contain 2"
demanded Sinclair. “It may seem to
be a fine point, but I think we ought to
have it cleared up.” :
The hostess resumed: “Everyone is
to have as much as he likes, certainly.
Of course he is. We are not going to
be inhospitable. On the contrary, we
are prepared to share our last crust.
But there must be absolutely no waste.”
There was a short pause. No one
was inclined to demur to that proposi-
tion. The Reverend Henry alone had
doubts. .*
“It is difficult at a time like this,
you know,” he began mildly, “to be
quite certain that you are doing the
right thing. If you stop all waste in
your household are you sure that you
may not be encouraging unemploy-
ment? If you don't waste biscuits it
follows that fewer biscuits are made
and therefore——"
The Reverend Henry was adjudged
to be on the wrong tack and his protest
was swept aside. -
“Breakfast now,” my wife began
briskly, bringing into action her block
of notepaper and fountain-pen. “All
that 1 want to know — I wouldn't
dream of stinting you—is—how much
do you intend to eat?”
She looked round expectantly, the
pen poised in her hand. There was
rather an awkward pause. The ques-
tion seemed at first blush a little
indelicate. Sinclair tried to temporize.
“But wait a bit,” he said. “Can't
the servants manage to consume—”
“The servants breakfast long before
you are up, Mr. Sinclair,” my wiſe
reminded him.
“It's perfectly simple,” said I, sud-
denly taking the floor; “I think it an
admirable idea, the essence of good
citizenship. What we have got to do
is to declare our appetites overnight so
that every man eats the food he has
booked and we make a clean sweep.
Book me for two eggs and a kipper.”
“Sorry there are no kippers to-
morrow,” said my wife. “Boiled eggs,
bacon and kidneys and mushrooms.”
“It would be wrong to suppose that
I do not consider it a wise and indeed
public-spirited idea in every way,” said
the Reverend Henry after some re-
know. It depends so much upon how
one sleeps and what one feels like, and
what sort of morning it is, and the
letters that come, and the war news.”
“And on the temperature of one's
tub,” added Sinclair. “For my part I
eat a lot at breakfast. I don't feel that
I have the face to advertise the whole
catalogue in this sort of way. It's too
cold-blooded. Besides, I fluctuate like
anything.”
“Come on,” said I. “You fellows
are simply trying to shirk the thing.
I declare two eggs, no bacon and three
mushrooms, assuming an average size

for mushrooms. One cup and a half
of coffee. Three lumps in all.”
“Well, that’s a fairly good lead,”
said Sinclair. “I propose to double
you on mushrooms and I should like
to be put down for a kidney. What
about you, Henry 2”
“Nothing but one rasher of bacon,
please,” said Henry meekly. “I am
never hungry in the morning and I
have always wanted to know how much
bacon there is in a rasher. A single cup
of tea, no sugar, but plenty of cream.”
My wife had been writing busily.
Now she looked up. “What about
toast 2" she enquired.
“You are going into details,” said
Sinclair approvingly. “Doesn't it
rather depend on the size of the slice?
You may enter me for a couple of
slices, three by two. And jam—no,
marmalade. An ounce of marmalade.”
said my wife, for Sinclair was causing
a lot of confusion by trying to barter a
brace of mushrooms against my second
egg (or at least to hold an option on the
egg) in case he changed his mind before
the morning. “And now I'll just send
this to the kitchen, and then I'll go to
bed.”
It never really panned out well. On
the first morning a very awkward thing
happened. My wife, in her zeal to
provide for her guests, had omitted to
count herself in. We had to make a
subscription for her, and it must be
said that a splendid response was forth-
coming, Sinclair nobly renouncing his
kidney. But the result was that lunch ||
had to be put half-an-hour earlier, and ||
the day was disorganised.
On the second morning, the Rev. |
Henry was down early and bagged all ||
my toast, while Sinclair, who had slept ||
badly, refused to meet his obligations
in the matter of kedjeree.
By the third day there was a good |
deal of unseemly barter and exchange |
going on, and Sinclair made a corner
in eggs. “The trouble is,” he explained,
“that you never really know how good
a thing is till you see it. Overnight a
Sardine on toast means nothing to me; i
and it was never announced that these
eggs were going to be poached.”
On the fourth day the scheme was |
tottering. Sinclair had actually been
for a walk before breakfast and was |
consequently making an unsuccessful ||
tour of the table in quest of extra toast. .

posing that the name had been censore
in Leo's letter, there could be no doubt
as tº he identity of the person to whom
the writer referred.
So far as I could see there was ºne
of two possibilities. . Either Phyllis
was involuntarily developing the Censor
habit, or she was treating the exigencies
of correspondence in war-time with a
levity that in a future wife I firmly
deprecated. Humour of this kind is
all very well in its place; but these are
not days in which we must smile with-
out a serious reason, I determined to
teach her a lesson.
“Dean Phyllis,” I wrote, “Many

Knowing her as I do, I thought that
this, if anything, would bring Phyllis
to her senses. On the other hand, she
appeared to look on it as a kind of
challenge, and sent me the following
reply:—
“DEAR JAck,--Thanks very much for

what I was looking at, he actually
suggested buying me the bracelet. Of
course I said that no lady would

but he wouldn't hear of a reſusal and
simply pushed the darling thing into
my hand. I am meeting him at the

There was only one way of answering

signifying my complete indifference.
Her still more negative answer was
an envelope addressed to me with no
enclosure at all.
To this I replied by not replying.
And here, by all the laws of sequence,
our correspondence should have been
brought to a standstill. I calculated,
however, that when the postman de-
livered my phantom communication
next morning Phyllis would not remain
twiddling her thumbs for long.
Sure enough, about 9 A.M. I received
this wire:

with the love of Geoffrey for Valentine

Geoffrey and Miriam, a woman of the

but she has all the good qualities which
he lacks, and she is brave and loving
enough to drag him from the pit into

means of Amending Bill.

MIER, Expressed hope that in the
interval between adjournment and re-

John REDMoND assumed that if the

failed the intention of the Government

assumption, based upon reiterated state-

assenting cheer from Ministerialists.

THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT
ENDOWMENT SCHEME.
JANE's uncle—Jane is my daughter—
came to me one day and said, “What
do you think of my giving Jane a
camera for her birthday ? Wouldn't
she be pleased ? The advertisement
says, “Any babe can do it,' and she'll
be ten." '
“I have no doubt she'd be delighted,”
I said, “but there's a but. If you
give it you must endow it.”
“What do you mean?” said Jane's
uncle.
“The camera's the least part of it,”
I replied. “For half-a-guinea you can
cast a camera upon the world, but have
you given a moment's consideration to
that camera's means of support? No,
I thought not. One more proof of the
happy-go-lucky spirit of the present
day. Yet you know that a camera has
to be fed on plates, that it consumes
quantities of poisonous acids, and ex-
presses itself on reams of paper. It is
altogether a desperate and spendthriſt
character. On whom do you suppose
the cost of all this will fall ?”
“On the employer, I should think,”
said Jane's uncle. “Doesn't Jane get
pocket-money?"
“Threepence a week,” I said. “Barely
her share of the camera's insurance
stamp. Jane being under age, any
debts she may incur will devolve on
me, and I am really not in a position
to take on this responsibility. No, I
repeat, if you give it you must endow
it.”
Jane's uncle meditated. Then he
said, “Very well, I'll endow it to the
extent of £1 a year, to be paid in quar-
terly instalments of 5s. each.”
Jane was delighted with the scheme.
She had never had five shillings to
spend before, and was enthralled to find
that it would buy not only paper and
poisons and plates, but also a mackin-
tosh coat for her camera. Then she took
snapshots indoors and outdoors, at all
times and in all weathers, with catholic
indifference to subject and suitability.
“The book says one has to learn by
experience," she said, showing me a
you is very good-–the only pity is that
I didn't get your head into the photo.”
This was one of many small details.
Jane looked forward feverishly to the
payment of the second instalment.
“You'll have to put it by,” I said.
“You have plenty of paper and things
left, haven't you?”
“Yes, but I want a dormouse.”
“Oh, but that wouldn't be legal,” I
said. “That would be a misappropria-
tion of trust funds.”
“What's that ?” said Jane.
“Well,” I said, “don’t you see that the
money's given to endow your camera,
and must be spent on that camera and
nothing else?" -
“But there's nothing more to get
for it,” urged Jane,
“Then the money must accumulate
interest until there is,” I said.
Women have no heads for the law.
I could not make Jane see that to buy
a dormouse with the funds of the
camera would be an irregular and
punishable proceeding. Finally, in
despair, I had to promise to ask her
uncle if he would recognise the ap-
plication of one quarter's payment to
the purchase of a dormouse. He ac-
ceded to the somewhat unusual request
with his customary good-nature.
“But remember,” I told Jane, “the
next instalment must be spent on the
camera.”
Slowly but surely, however, the
camera fell into disuse. I was asked
more rarely, and more rarely still, to
look through prints. At last I was
asked no more.
Then the third instalment arrived.
“You want some more paper and
things by now, I suppose?” I said
encouragingly.
“The light hasn't been good lately,”
said Jane evasively. “I’ve not been
taking many photos.”
“Then what are you going to do
with the money?"
“Ask Uncle if I may buy a stamp-
album.”
::: ::: *: ::: ::
Shortly after this, Jane's uncle's birth-
day came round. I passed a shop in
the City which had recently had a fire.
Five hundred silver cigarette-cases had
been pluckily rescued from the flames
and, to celebrate their escape, were being
offered for sale at a remarkably low
figure. One of these survivors was dis-
patched to Jane's uncle.
He dined with us the next evening,
and was more grateful than I could
reasonably expect. He handled the
cigarette-case quite fondly.
“But what about its endowment?"
he asked.
“What do you mean?" I said.
No knapsack should be without it.
“Well, isn't a cigarette-case as eligible
pile of under-exposures. “This one of

as a camera?" he said. “Its needs are,
I consider, even greater. Presumably
this gift is meant to facilitate my
smoking, but an empty cigarette-case
offers me nothing to smoke—it implies
the heavy responsibility on an already
overburdened man of keeping it filled.
Now, suppose you complete the giſt,
as I did Jane's, by at least a year's
endowment?”
I began to wish that the cigarette-
cases had perished, but after his kind-
ness to Jane I could hardly refuse.
“Well, what would it cost?” I said.
“That's easily reckoned,” said Jane's
uncle. “Say I smoke on an average
fifteen cigarettes a day—that's 105 a
week—that's— Have you a piece of
paper?”
It worked out at just under 5,500
golf-balls, caddies, club subscription,
spondence with The Times. Compared
cigarettes a year. At 8s, a hundred,
twenty guineas would just cover the
year's endowment. It seemed out of
all proportion to the cost of the case.
“It's a good deal more than Jane's
camera got,” I protested.
“I told you its claims were greater.
Of course you can't expect to get off
as cheaply with a fixed habit of ma-
turity as with the passing caprice of a
kid. On the other hand you might
have done worse. Suppose you had
given me golf-clubs—there'd have been
lunches, fares and postage on corre-
with that, what is a paltry five guineas
a quarter?”
On reflection I found that very few
presents would have escaped the en-
dowment scheme altogether, and that
the cigarette-case was really a com-
paratively modest pensioner, and I felt
a little comforted.
For four quarters I remitted five
guineas to Jane's uncle.
My present seemed to change his
nature. Whereas he had been a man
rather to ignore the claims of clothes
than to consider them, I now noticed
that he looked more prosperous and
was better dressed than I had ever seen
him before. Once, when he appeared in
a new lounge suit—the second new one.
within my knowledge in six months
—I could not refrain from remarking
on it.
“One has to dress up to a silver
cigarette-case, old fellow,” he said, and
the subject was dismissed.
The year was on the point of expiring.
One day I was talking with Jane's
uncle and another man at the Club.
The other man offered me a cigarette,
and to my amazement passed Jane's
uncle over with these words:—
“No good offering you one, I know,
poor old chap. When is your doctor

But Sir Ernest knew it also.
Ralph stood motionless. Lady Mar-
garet, playing her part bravely, sat
motionless on her palfrey. Sir Ernest
lay motionless, his rifle pointed in-
flexibly at her heart. No word was
spoken.
A grouse in the oak-tree croaked
jeeringly.
An hour passed. Two hours. Three.
Four. There was not the tremor of a
muscle among the three.
Five hours passed. Six. Seven.
Then Ralph felt that the strain could
be borne no longer. He resolved to
count a hundred and at the end of that
time to rush desperately forward, hoping
against hope that the murderous bullet
would not find its billet.
Ninety-seven . . . ninety-eight . . .
ninety-nine . . . Ralph caught his
breath sharply. The finger on the rifle
trigger had relaxed.
Sir Ernest had fainted. -
In thirty seconds Ralph had bound
him hand and foot. With a long,
quivering sigh of relief Lady Margaret
into her rescuer's arms. Ralph crushed
her to his breast in a passion of
gratitude.
But Lady Margaret quickly disen-
gaged herself. “What about the grouse?”
she exclaimed.
“Great heavens !” exclaimed Ralph,
snatching out his watch. “It's four
o'clock I have only one hour, and
the others will have had eight.”
He seized his field-glasses, sprang
into the oak and swept the surrounding
country. There was not a grouse in
sight. He gave vent to an exclamation
of despair.
“Follow me!” said Lady Margaret.
“I know their sanctuary. You can do
it yet.”
Snatching up the rifles, Ralph fol-
lowed the girl as she threaded her way
through the trees. At last she halted
abruptly. “Look!” she whispered.
“There they are.”
And, indeed, Ralph saw that all the
trees around him were congested with
grouse. He levelled his rifle and fired.
Bang! A grouse fell at his feet. He
snatched the second rifle from Lady
loader. Bang! Another fell. There
was no escape from that deadly eye.
Lady Margaret had been brought up
to sport from her earliest youth. As a
child she had watched many of the
finest shots in Europe. But she had
never seen anything like this. Such
unerring precision enthralled her.
And she played her own part nobly.
Almost before Ralph had surrendered
the empty rifle the loaded one was in
his grasp. And when the barrels grew
red-hot, her quick wit saved the situ-
ation and she thrust them into the
stream which trickled at their feet.
Bang! . . . Bang! . . . Bang!
Again the guests were assembled in
the gun-room.
“Oyez Oyez!” cried Lord Tamer-
ton merrily. “I proclaim the champion
to be Ralph Wonderson, with a total
bag of two thousand brace.”
Amid a clamour of laughter and con-
|gratulation Lady Margaret came shyly
forward and laid her left hand on
Ralph's shoulder.

slid from her horse and threw herself

For business reasons I had to take

me and said that Evangeline, her

congratulations to her on a good story.
My impression of Behind the Picture (WARD, Lock) is
that it would be better worth reading if it contained less of
the tale—which, to speak quite candidly, is parlous non-
sense—and more of the trimmings. The trimmings are
mostly concerned with art bargain-hunting, and are excel-
lent fun. Most of us have the treasure-trove instinct
sufficiently developed to like reading about a young man
who picks up Gainsboroughs for a tenner, or unearths lost
masterpieces of TURNER on a clue supplied by an old letter.
The young man in question was Hugh Limmer, and in his
off moments he fulfilled perfunctorily the duties of hero of
the story. But I can't help thinking that Mr. M. McD.
BoDKIN, his creator, liked him best as an expert. Cer-
tainly I myself did. Hugh, as I say, found his buried

LEAVES FROM AN IMPERIAL NOTE-BOOK.
As I have taken occasion to tell them from time to time,
God is sparing no effort in favour of My brave armies. The
noble courage with which they have crushed a defenceless
peasantry (who, by the way, do not seem to share My
recognition of the Deity's support of Our methods) has
proved them to be the authorised medium of the Divine
vengeance. I am very pleased with both them and God.
The destruction of Louvain, seat of a culture wholly dis-
tinct from the Prussian ideal, was an inspiration, in which
I once more detect the Hand of Heaven. Unfortunately it
has been misunderstood in neutral countries; and, to ap-
pease their protests, I have had to explain that this feat of
righteous wrath has given me an attack of bleeding heart.
I am despatching an Imperial telegram to the President
of the Oxford University Boat Club to say that when My
armies reach that city I may possibly spare Oriel for the
sake of My Rhodes Scholars. This generous thought
occurred to Me in church when I was returning thanks for
the demolition of the library of Louvain.
I have also instructed My intrepid aviators to reserve a
pew for Me intact among the ruins of Notre Dame de Paris
—for thanksgiving purposes.
I have repeatedly warned Nicholas that God is against
him. It is like his impious self-assurance to imagine that
One whose services I have exclusively secured for My
side could for a moment entertain the idea of supporting
My enemies. I confess, however, that I had expected
FRANz-Josef, as My ally, to receive a larger portion of
the Deity's favour than has so far fallen to him. From
what I hear of the Lemberg affair, it looks as if his indepen-
dent arrangements for Divine support had been inadequate.
I am afraid I must leave him to get on without it as best
he can. I shall want all I've got for my own use.
I see that a new Pope has been elected at Rome.
At any ordinary moment this world-event must have
attracted the attention of Heaven. But the present attitude
of Italy towards the Triple Alliance naturally precludes
any Divine cognisance of her concerns. On the other hand
I have Myself thought it expedient to address congratula-
tions to the Italian who now occupies the Pontifical Chair,
and have ordered the fact to receive due publicity as part of
My subsidised Press campaign.
In order that the organisers of this campaign may the
better persuade neutral countries to accept, My version of
the justice of Our cause, I have given directions for them to
appeal throughout to the God of Truth. We were, as
usual, first in the field, and the Father of Lies has a lot of
ground to make up. -
My dear son Wilhelm tells Me that his own army has a
tough proposition in front of it... I sometimes fear that
he lacks the unquestioning piety of his Imperial Parent.
I note that services are still permitted to be held in the
English church at Dresden, but that no prayers for the
success of British arms are allowed. In view of My
monopoly of Divine protection I regard this precaution as
unnecessary. - -
Some blundering operator in Berlin has circulated the
ridiculous report of a disaster to My army in France. I
have ordered the fear of God to be put into him.
Even I cannot be in two places at once, and I am too
busy in exchanging felicitations with My Creator in the
background of Öur western sphere of operations to be able
to give My benediction in person to the brave defenders
of Miy beloved Prussia. My lack of the gift of omnipresence
has always been rather a sore point with Me in My other-
wise co-equal relations with the Almighty. I hope in course

That once outrode the mimic storm,
And deep in darkest shelves intern
Her captain and his pirate swarm :
Sweep, sweep, that Dreadnought from the seas
. Of England's carpets, if you please,
And set no more by two and two
On Sabbath days her bestial crew,
That mask with peace the Prussian uniform.
I seem to see the War-Lord's lace
Bedeck that bosom mild and stout;
Athwart yon patriarchal face
The Kaiser-like moustaches sprout;
The wideawake becomes a helm,
The staff a sword to overwhelm,
Hypocrisy stands writ and cant
On yonder pale-blue elephant
Tusk-less (Maud did it when Mamma was out).
What makes he with a lilac dove
This Corsair desperate and daſt?
Behold the conning tower above
The big stern chasers pointing aſt!
This is not he that saved mankind
With pards and pigs from tempests blind,
But rather he that forged a flood,
And not of water but of blood,
And filled with worse than wolves his impious craft.
But come, we'll build a larger boat
Of English breed, no Teuton shams,
Where sheltered animals shall float,
The lion couchant with the lambs:
See from the cabin's open door
What mild-faced dromedaries pour !
What SHEMs are these? what host arrives
Of gentler JAPHETs with their wives?
What antelopes? what un-Westphalian HAMs?
And sometimes, should the pageant cloy,
Supposing Nurse has left the room,
We'll take again that outcast toy
From the deep cupboard's inmost gloom;
We'll shell that buccaneering barque
With the good guns of England's ark;
We'll chase it flying like a rat
For some fort-guarded Ararat,
And leave it flotsam for Jemima's broom.

DISPOSITIONS.
My wife was certainly ruffled, and,
more than that, she was mystified. She
could not understand it at all.
“And this is the second time," she
said.
“Have you questioned the servants?”
I asked.
“It is not likely that my servants
would amuse themselves by throwing
lumps of coal on the drawing-room
carpet,” she replied, “not being lunatics.
But as a matter of fact I have questioned
them.”
“It is the sort of thing a playful
kitten might do,” I suggested. “Or a
puppy perhaps.”
“No, they couldn't have liſted the
tongs, and the tongs were in it too, and
three walking-sticks. It must have
been children, I suppose; but I don't
think there have been any children in
the house.”
I found ber the same aſternoon study-
ing some scratched hieroglyphics on the
gravel in front of the house. It was
quite an elaborate design with squares
and circles and curving lines, and with a
wobbly streak running through it. And
that evening she announced once and for
all that the house was bewitched and she
gave it up. She had found a looſah,
two sponges and some cakes of soap
elaborately arranged in a pattern on
the bathroom floor.
... She had not yet gathered, as I had, that
it was Sinclair and the Reverend Henry.
I do not think that these two can have
been properly trained in their youth to
put away, their toys when they had
finished with them, as all tidy children
should. They had no right to go out
suddenly and play tennis, leaving the
drawing-room carpet in that condition.
I had seen it coming on for some
days. As soon as Henry has spent
his first half-hour on the newspapers he
is ripe to explain in detail the exact
disposition of the Allied forces and
what they are evidently driving at.”

it was wrong. He was down on his

BRUTALITY is acknowledged by the
most distinguished Teutonic psycholo-

modern warfare, as serving to maintain
a properly submissive attitude on the
part of the unarmed enemy, and the
College has been established to com-
plete this side in the training of cadets
for the Imperial German field army.
TRAINING BY GRAMoPHONE.
Many difficulties have had to be
surmounted. For instance it was found
that, in spite of training students, pro-
ceeding to the front showed hesitation
in the execution of non-combatants,
and grew pale on first hearing the cries
of women and children. This difficulty
is being obviated by means of gramo-
phone records taken in Belgium, which
serve to inure the novice to the sounds
of anguish. By the time he proceeds
to the front no cries for mercy have
any power to move him.
LITERAE INHUMANIoIREs.
The curriculum is extensive. In
addition to regular musketry practice at
moving and stationary Red Cross wag-
gons, hospital bomb drill, etc., courses
of lectures are being given by thinkers
of the first eminence. Some of the most
celebrated names on the contemporary
record of German culture are to be

“Company—'SHUN' "
We shunned. We stood motionless
(all but one of us) waiting for his next
words. Then he spoke again.

mouth. “Blanket,” he went on, “if

to look round and watch the generous
waves of colour stealing over James's
classic features, to fix with a reproach-
ful eye that Roman proboscis which he
had been grooming; but duty, or natural
integrity of character, or fear of the
Sergeant-Major, or something, held
me fast.

We turned to the right and I took

“How's the neb 2.” I said.
And then James told me what he

“Pretty good rot,” he said, “talking

“Discipline, James,” I said. “Think
how good it is for you to be ordered
about for a change. And think how
jolly it must be for the Sergeant-Major
to swear at well-known public men.
Don't grudge him his little bit of
pleasure. And finally, think how
stimulating it is for the rest of us. I
assure you, James, there's nothing
more bracing to a man than to hear
another man being cursed.”
James muttered to himself. We lit
our pipes and sat down among some
other members of our platoon. James
was silent, but we others talked eagerly
about the difference between “Right
form " and “On the right form com-
pany,” and other matters which had
suddenly become of great importance.
“Let’s go and have a little private

“It’ll only turn into a rag,” I said.
“But of course we shall have to
agree to take it seriously and obey

AUNTIE’s EAR-TRUMPET 2 ''
T.: E GREAT CAMPAIGN.
THE formal declaration of war (alto-
gether unexpected by the best minds of
the community, though the opposing
armies had been mobilised for a month
previously), came like a bolt from the
blue on September 1st. In an instant
the whole country was engaged in
sanguinary conflict. We give with
reserve the following reports which
have reached us from our correspon-
dents at the front:—
Civili.ANs IN THE BATTLE LINE.
On he north-eastern frontier a keen
encounter occurred between the famous
Albion South End Corps and an invad-
|ing division of the redoubtable Cockspur
troops. Fifteen thousand spectators
from posts of vantage round the field
| witnessed the fearful onslaught of the
enemy. Civilians were so moved by
the imminent peril of the home troops
that, arming themselves with stones
and bottles, and shouting “ —” (ex-
cised by Censor), they flung themselves
on the wings of the invading army and
utterly routed them. It is rumoured
that the Cockspurs contemplate re-
prisals. In the event of the South End
Corps invading their country it is be-
lieved that all civilians will fight to the
BY REQUEST.
THE OLD IBRITISH SPIRIT.
Thrilling scenes were witnessed at
the opening of the Ealham Thursday
campaign. A huge crowd, thirsting for
a sight of the conflict, gathered in the
confines of the battlefield. A force of
blue-clad mercenaries held them in
check for a time. Dut thirty thousand
dred paid men. With magnificent un-
animity the Britons formed in column.
The dense black mass pressed forward.
For a moment the conflict was fearful.
Then the thin blue line of the mercen-
aries gave way and they fled in dis-
graceful rout. A moment later thirty
thousand unconquerable Britons, laden
with booty from the pay-boxes, stood
triumphant on the shilling reserved
mound. That wonderful charge had
captured the position.
OUTRAGES ON NoN-CoMBATANTs.
We record with deep regret a viola-
tion of the laws of war by the General
of the Shatterham Wanderers army.
In the heat of the combat with the
Notts Strollers brigade he ignored the
whistled appeal for an armistice to
pick up the wounded. . Proceeding
steadily he fired a deadly shot into the
enemy's fortifications. A neutral officer,
under the protection of the Red Cross,
volunteers are worth more than a hun-

infamy. In an excess of military fury
the General smote the neutral officer
to the earth. It is believed that, unless
the offending General be instantly sub-
mitted to a regular court-martial, the
Shatterham Wanderers' army will be
solemnly declared outside the pale of
humanity. (NoTE.—The Censor allows
the foregoing account to be printed
but disclaims all responsibility for its
correctness.)
BRILLIANT RECRUITING CAMPAIGN.
Great weakness has been observed
amongst the advanced sharpshooters of
the Bullington Arsenal corps. “We
must have men at any cost,” said their
determined Secretary. A cheering
crowd attended him to the station as he
set out for (excision by the Censor),
accompanied by two commissionaires
bearing armoured bags of bullion. A
rumour reaches us that at the cost of
four thousand pounds the Secretary
has secured two famous shots. Great
anxiety is felt in Bullington. Crowds
gather round the headquarters of the
corps and ask, “Will they come in
time?”
LATER.—A wire from Scotland con-
firms the news. The Union Jack is
flying over the headquarters. It is felt

(A new nautical ballad.)
The captain he said, “Take heart of grace;
There's many a risk to run;
A herring's an awkward thing to face,
But it's not so bad as a gun.
THEY faced the winds, the waves, the fogs,
For they were a gallant band,
And they ventured forth, the bold sea dogs,
From the bight of Helgoland.
“My mariners all, be not afraid
To venture on bold designs;
Romember ye come of the stock that made
The North Sea stiff with mines.
Six ships of war they steamed along,
Audacious and yet discreet,
When lo! on the skyline, ſiſteen strong,
They sighted another fleet.
“So clear the decks for a scrap, my braves,
Since fight ye must and shall,
Like sons of the men who rule the waves,

Oh! theirs was indeed a perilous choice,
'Twas a case of fight or flee,
When the captain cried in a resolute voice,
“Let us fight, my lads," cried he.
So all that day they fought and drank
Of the battle's fierce delight,
And blazed and blazed away till they sank
Those trawling boats ere night.
“Long have we panted to come to grips,
And here we shall gain our wish;
Moreover, I fancy that yonder ships
Have nothing on board but fish.”
Then they steamed away, Yeo ho! Yeo ho!
Brave men who had gained their wish,
With lots of captives of war in tow,
And any amount of fish.
Then up spake a grizzled Goeben lad,
“We be far from land or fort;

(SEPTEMBER 16, 1914.
PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Thus the MEMBER For SARK mused
on his way to the Club to read the
latest telegrams from the seat of war.
Business done.—Various emergency
Bills advanced a stage.
Thursday. — Five weeks ago, when
Declaration of War with Germany
boomed across Europe, PREMIER asked
the Commons to sanction increase of
Army by half-a-million min. Reply
enthusiastically affirmative. To-day
comes down again and, like a young
person who shall here be nameless,
“ asks for more.”
National response to recruitment of
| first batch most gratifying. Save
| 60,000 men the half-million already
| enrolled. At present rate of progress
another couple of days or so will see
| number completed. Meanwhile PREMIER
asks for another half-million.
These forthcoming, and in present
mood of nation there is no doubt on
subject, “We shall be in a position,”
he added, “to put something like
1,200,000 men in the field,” a sight
that would make WELLINGTON, not to
mention MARLBoRough, stare.
With that patriotic zeal that has
marked attitude of Opposition since
war began BoxAR LAw warmly sup-
ported proposal. Vote agreed to with-
out debate or division.
Business done. — Having voted ad-
ditional half-million men for Army,
House adjourned till Monday.
AT THE PLAY.
“BLUFF KING HAL.”
THE arrangements for the production
of Mr. Louis PARKER's pageant-comedy
had of course been made long before
war was contemplated. The completion
of Mr. Bourch iER's beard in itself
points to a comparatively remote date
for the play's inception. Certainly there
is nothing very apposite in its theme
at the present juncture; for IIARRY of
ENGLAND, suffering from the gout,
blustering into a sixth marriage, and
haunted by the ghosts of four dead
wives and the wraith of the sole survivor,
is not a figure precisely calculated to
inspire patriotic fervour. Still, the cir-
cumstances of the play are Sufficiently
national, and it should serve well enough
as a permissible distraction for non-
combatants.
You need not be terrified by the
complexity of the cast, which consists
of twenty prominent characters, twenty-
four in smaller type, four ghosts and a
wraith, and a sprinkling of nameless
“halberdiers, huntsmen, minstrels,
servitors, etc.” (The soldier-supers—
a type not to be confused with the
super-soldier—were a very scratch lot;
to the enlistment of the more martial
spirits in the profession.) The history
of the period is made easy for all
intelligences, and the relations of
Katharine I’arr with her lover, Sir
Thomas Seymour, furnish a clear thread
of human interest.
It was pleasant to make the acquaint-
ance of two future Queens—Mary and
Elizabeth—at the less familiar stages
of girlhood. Mary, very micely played
by Miss MINA LEONES1, showed no sign
of her subsequent taste for blood; but
Miss KATHLEEN JONES, in the part of
the pedantic little Princess Elizabeth,
gave us some very happy premonitions
of the domineering qualities of the
Virgin Queen. The tiny Prince Edward,
“I DUNNo 'oo NANCY 1s—BUT THAT THERE
KAYZER CAN'T BE No GENTLEMAN To stand
BY AN' SEE 'ER KNock ED ABAHT ''
too, who was prepared to compose an
epithalamium for his royal parent's
final wedlock, already gave promise of
a scholarly career. Apart, however,
from the charm of Miss Viole:T WAN-
BRUGH as Katharine Parr, and the
gentle dignity of Miss ALICE LoNNoN
as Anne Askew, there was little distinc-
tion shown by the others, though the
Lord Chancellor Wriothesley of Mr.
HUMPHREYs, and Mr. Burron's Bishop
Gardiner, conducted their villainies with
a proper restraint.
The honours of the evening obviously
went to Mr. HUGo RUMbold, who
devised the admirable scenery and
costumes, and to Mr. BourchIER in the
title-róle. By nature and constitution
he is clearly made for this palt of all
others. Occasionally, in asides, his voice
was the voice of Mr. Bourch iER, but
for the rest he identified himself with
be persuaded to retain the monarch's
beard as a permanent feature; for, as
a finished product, it suits him well in
private life; and, if he is to make a prac-
tice of playing the part of Henry VIII.,
whether to the words of SHAKSPEARE
or Mr. PARKER, I would not, for his own
sake and that of his many friends, have
him renew the horrific processes of its
growth. O. S.
“THE IMPossIBLE WOMAN.”
The joy of Tante (from which novel
Mr. HADDON CHAMBERs has adapted
this play), was that many chapters
went by before the reader realised that
Madame Okraska was indeed an im-
possible woman. One began by liking
her; went on to criticise; decided that
she wasn't so nice as the authorintended
her to be; and then discovered suddenly
that she wasn't intended to be a sym.
pathetic character at all, and that, in
fact, our changing attitude towards her
had been just the changing attitude
which would have been ours in real
life. That was Miss ANNE Douglas
SEDGwick's art. She took her time.
Mr. CHAMBERs on the stage has not the
time to take.
And so “Tamte " is shown to us at
once as a histrionic vampire, feeding on
the admiration and love of others.
Gregory Jardine, in love with her ward,
Karem, has already seen through her;
we have seen through her; the question
is, when will Karen see through her.
Forget about the book and you have
the foundation of a good play here, on
which Mr. CHAMBERs has built skil.
fully. I gather from the fact that he
took alone the call for “Author” that
he would wish us to forget about the
book. I cannot quite do that, but I
can say with confidence that whoever
has not read Tante will enjoy The Im-
possible Woman fully, and that the
others will at least find it interesting.
Miss LILLAH McCARTHY was a
superb Okraska. Since she had to
reveal herself plainly to the audience,
the temptation to overplay the part
must have been great, but she resisted
it nobly. Mr. GoDFREY TEARLE, still
a little apt to smile at the wrong
moment, was a thoroughly efficient
Gregory; but Miss HILDA BAYLEY did
not give me a very clear idea of Mr.
CHAMBERs' Karen, and was certainly
not Miss SEDGwick's. Miss MAY
WHITTY and Mr. HENRY Edwards, in
the small but important parts of
Mrs. Talcot and Franz Lippheim,
were of very great assistance to the
play.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH'S HOLIDAY STORIES.
W.—A HUNTING MoRN.
(In the approved manner of the Sporting
Feuilleton.)
SETTING his teeth determinedly,
Ralph Wonderson swarmed up the
Virginia-creeper until he reached the
closely-shuttered window. Here he
clung precariously with one hand
while with the other he produced a
gimlet and noiselessly bored two holes
in the green shutters. Was he too
late? The question shot through his
brain. With a quick intake of breath
he applied an eye to one hole and an
ear to the other and watched and
listened.
In the lighted room before him sat
Sir Ernest Scrivener (alias Marmaduke
Moorsdyke) and a brutal - looking
stranger. Sir Ernest was speaking.
“Everything, I think, is ready,” he
said in his cold, level voice. “The
wedding is to take place in the village
church to-morrow at eleven. You,
Ragley, will take up your position,
disguised as a policeman, by the
church porch, arrest Wonderson on a
charge of arson, and detain him until
I arrive, if I should not be already
there. I have here the policeman's
uniform complete. We are cub-hunting
to-morrow morning, and at the proper
moment I shall leave the hunt and
make my way across to the church,
provided with the forged warrant of
arrest (which I shall, as a magistrate,
hand to you), the forged death certificate
of my present wife, and the forged
special licence for the marriage of Lady
Margaret Tamerton and myself. You
will then rush Wonderson off in the
motor which will be waiting, and I
shall proceed to marry Lady Margaret.
Yes—yes, everything is quite ready.”
“There's just one thing, Sir,” said
Ragley, “if you'll excuse me mentioning
it. Supposing as how the lady refuses
like.''
Sir Ernest tossed away his half-
smoked cigar and smiled evilly.
“That has been foreseen,” he said.
“The shock of Wonderson's arrest will
cause her to feel faint. I shall have
ready a bottle of smelling salts. I
need not go into details . . . drugs .
loss of will power . . . you see. . .
The blood boiling in Ralph's ears
prevented him from hearing more.
Only the sight of the two murderous-
looking revolvers on the table and tº
knowledge that he could not afford to
take risks at this juncture stopped him
from tearing open the shutters and
dashing into the room.
Sir Ernest rose to his feet and
* *
creeper and regained terra firma. His
mind was working rapidly.
The meet of the Chingerley Hunt
made a gay spectacle. The red coats
of the men and the fascinating Parisian
toilettes of the ladies shone resplend-
ently in the morning sunshine, while
the champing of the horses' bits blended
harmoniously with the choiring of
numberless larks. Through the brilliant
throng moved the Master, Sir Ernest
Scrivener, bowing his greetings right
and left as he passed.
A few minutes before the hour fixed
for the start the approach of a solitary
horseman caused many eyebrows to lift
in surprise, while Sir Ernest for an in-
stant went white to the teeth. Then
he laughed scornfully.
“Why, Wonderson' " cried one of
the Hunt. “What on earth are you
doing here? I understood you were
being married this morning.”
“That is so,” replied Ralph easily.
“But I see no reason why I shouldn't
hunt first. DRAKE, you know, played
bowls during a crisis, and NERo fiddled.”
As he spoke he watched Sir Ernest
narrowly. The Master was making his
way towards the iron cage in which the
fox cub was imprisoned. Ralph edged
his horse insensibly nearer.
Amid the eager plaudits of the Hunt
Sir Ernest leaned down from his saddle
and raised the catch with a flourish.
As he did so a packet of papers fell
from his breast pocket.
In a flash the released cub had pounced
upon the papers and carried them off
in his mouth. With a savage oath Sir
Ernest plunged his spurs into his horse's
flanks and gave chase. Ralph, per-
ceiving instantly what had happened
and guessing the all-important nature
of the papers, was by him in a stride.
Side by side the pair thundered along,
while behind them the hounds and
hunters streamed out in a confused and
glittering medley. They were off!
The hunt was up. -
Crouching low on the necks of their
panting steeds, the two protagonists
swept forward, plying remorselessly
whip and spur, curb and snaffle. For
a time neither gained an inch. Then,
without warning, the fox doubled.
. . . With a single turn of his iron wrist
Ralph wrenched his horse round with-
out the loss of a second, but as he
glanced back over his shoulder he
perceived that the Master was only
twenty yards behind. Ralph redoubled
his efforts, his eyes glued to the white
bundle clenched in the cub's dripping
Jaws.
Through field and farmyard, by barn
and byte, over rick and river, they sped,
Ralph lessened, while the gap between
Ralph and Sir Ernest grew wider, and
the savage baying of the hounds, min-
gled with the frenzied view halloos of
the Hunt, receded further into the
distance. Never had the Chingerley
Hunt known such a chase.
At last Ralph recognized that his
chance had come. Leaning over his
horse's ears, he took careful aim and
slashed out with his long whip. Un-
erringly the lash coiled round the
papers and jerked them from the fox's
mouth. A single glance showed him
that they were, as he had anticipated,
the forged documents.
Two minutes later Sir Ernest found
the exhausted fox lying insensible by
the roadside. Glancing up, he perceived
º vanishing over the crest of a
hill.
“Curse him ' " he muttered savagely.
“Curse him " I must and will over-
take him before he reaches the church
or the game is up. If I take a short
cut under the hill I can outwit him
yet. Curse him again!” -
Mercilessly lashing his foaming
horse, he galloped in the direction of
the church. As he rode a sense of the
urgency of the situation grew upon
him. If he arrived first, Wonderson
could be arrested, if necessary at the
pistol's point, before he entered the
churchyard, and the papers recovered.
If he was too late. . . He plunged his
spurs an inch deep into his weary
mount. -
At length the desperate Mazeppa-
like dash was over. As he shot through
the lych-gate Sir Ernest breathed a sigh
of relief. A policeman stood by the
church porch awaiting him. Wonder-
son had been beaten.
With an ugly laugh of triumph he
swung himself from the horse. Stolidly
the constable turned to face him. Sir
Ernest gave one startled exclamation
as he saw, not Ragley, but a stranger.
He had been forestalled.
The heavy hand of a second police-

A red-coated figure, covered with the
stains of hard riding, approached them,
bowing low. In his hand he held a
magnificent fox's brush.
“This has been unanimously awarded
to you, Sir," he said, “as a memento of
the finest ride in the annals of the
Chingerley Hunt.”
And, as Ralph and his bride raised
the brush to their lips, from the ad-

them went up that thrilling immemorial

ANOTHER MANIFESTO.
WE, the undersigned, having carefully
considered the situation in all its bear-
ings and applications, have come to the
decision that it is no longer consonant
with the self-respect of Englishmen to
share a name with the great swollen-
headed German aggressor—the despiser
of treaties, the desecrator of Belgium
and the foe of the liberty of the world.
We therefore give notice that from now
and henceforward we renounce the name
of William in all its variations.

results) the Emperor FRANcis Joseph

concession which will no doubt be very
highly appreciated by the Landsturm;
but one trifling difficulty seems to stand
1n the way. To be frank, we do not
quite see how they are going to get
outside. At least it would be well for
them to take steps before it is too late.
Events have not facilitated the journey

know it would be a cruel disappoint-

Perhaps they might try the emergency
exit to Italy, where a warm reception
would await them.
Meanwhile the idea has been taken
up by FRANCIs Joseph's brother Em-
peror, who never likes to miss a good
thing. We understand that he has
granted to the German Fleet — on
account of its gallant conduct in the

Now is your time of trial, now
When into dusk the glamour pales
And the first glow of passion fails
That lit your eyes and flushed your brow

The sudden swelling of the heart,
The swift resolve to have your part
In this the noblest quest of all
By which our word is given to stand or fall.
Your mother's pride, your comrades' praise—
All that romance that seemed so fair
Grows dim, and you are left to bear

And labour of the long unlovely days.

Can you go forth in her dear cause to fight.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. I.
(From IIERI Fox BETHMANN Holi, WEG.)
MAJESTY,-Though you will never receive this letter, I
feel that I must write it if only to relieve my mind of an
intolerable burden. There is no doubt about it, things are
not going well with us, and we shall soon be in a situation
of a most deplorable kind. Our armies have been driven
back in France—this is what Von STEIN means when he
declares that we have had “partial successes"—and Paris,
which was to be captured weeks ago, seems to be as strong
and as defiant as ever. The English are still unbroken and
are pouring new armies into France. In Galicia the
wretched Austrians are running like sheep; even Servia has
beaten them and is invading Hungary and Bosnia; and our
wonderful fleet, which cost so much good money, is bottled
up. Soon we shall have the Cossacks on our backs, and
then the dance will begin in earnest. . -
13ut you don't care—not a bit of it. You've been
prancing about and making speeches and showing yourself
on balconies and congratulating God on being such a good
German. Do for Heaven's sake give us all a rest. We
are in for a frightful war, and untold miseries are sure to
fall upon us. Do you suppose that we shall be helped to
bear them if you continue to act like an inebriated madman
in the sight of the whole world?
Of course I shall have to bear the responsibility. I know
that well enough. So, while I still have the liberty to use
my pen, I mean to make my protest and throw back the
burden you want to put upon me. Let me tell you this:
you can't go on bragging and trampling on others and
glorifying your splendid and immaculate self without rousing
anger somewhere. Other people have their feelings—I've
got some left myself—and in the long run they're bound to
miserable worms, but we don't want to be told so
cvery day. -
And then how wanton and silly the whole management
of the affair has been. Think of our Empire so gloriously
won, so magnificently established. France, no doubt,
brooded over the possibility of a reranche, but no other
country envied us our success or desired either to damage.
our prestige or to interfere with our growing commerce.
Everybody was glad to hail us as friends. And now nearly
the whole of Europe has been brought about our ears.
Almost all countries wish for our destruction and are
trying to bring it about. Italy deserts us. Even America,
though you cringe to her, dislikes us and mentions Louvain.
when we speak of culture. What a masterpiece of folly and
miscalculation and wasted opportunity it has all been. And
the truth is that there's nobody to thank for it except your
sublime self. Others have made mistakes, but you alone
were capable of constructing this colossal monument of
detestable blunders. Our fault has been that we did not
attempt to check you when you pulled on your jack-boots
and mounted your high-horse to ride rough-shod over the
world, and that we pretended to believe you when you
assured us that all was well because you had taken in the
Almighty as a sleeping-partner in the business of governing
a State. That fault in all conscience is big enough, but it
becomes a mere speck when it is measured against yours.
I could add more, but what I have said is enough. At
any rate I am now feeling better.

THE WATCH DOGS.
III.
DEAR CHARLEs, I hope you haven't
been worrying yourself to death because
you haven't heard from your Territorial
for a fortnight. The Germans haven't
got us yet, and what is more we haven't
yet shot each other. There is a private
who comes down into the butts under
my charge who ought to be especially
grateful to Providence on this account,
for I cannot induce him to make use
of the red “Cease Fire!” flag before he
ascends from the safety-pit; even when
he does, he drags it out behind him so
that the first thing those on the firing-
point see is himself, and the second
thing is the flag. I think he must have
been an ammunition-monger in private
life and mixed with bullets in their less
dangerous moods.
We complain of the work and we
complain of the food, but really we are
very happy. The great thing about
our life is that there is nothing to
bother about ; someone is looking after
us all the time, that is from 5 A.M. to
10 P.M. They fetch you out of bed,
they exercise your muscles, they put
food into you, tell you where to go,
when to come back, how to fold up
your kit, and when to go to sleep. The
only thing they don't do is to come
round the last thing and tuck you up in
your little valise. You can strap your-
self in, all but the head, and as to that
there is a flap which anybody with a
little gum could fasten down as an en-
velope. If, Charles, you hear a rumour
that my battalion has been sent across
Germany to join the Russians on the
other side by parcel post, don't be too
ready to dismiss it as an absurdity.
Everybody has got somebody to look
after him here. There was an instance
on the range yesterday. The men were
firing their standard tests and there
were rumours of an inspection. The
N.C.O.'s in charge, being a bit anxious
themselves, were seeing to it that the
privates did their duty. Be sure we
kept a relentless eye on the N.C.O.'s,
and the Major in charge of the whole
Musketry Detachment did not deal
gently with us. Then the Adjutant
loomed up, and the Major had to ex-
plain himself as best he could ; next
came the Brigadier, and the Adjutant
was on his defence. Just as the
Brigadier was getting into his stride,
“The General, Sir," whispered the
Brigade-Major, and it was then for the
Brigadier to account for things being
as they were and to promise that
very shortly they should be otherwise.
You'd have thought that a man so ma-
ture and beribboned as our Divisional
attack; but not so, for up rolled a
motor which had come all the way
from London and the War Office and
even the dear old General was found to
be capable of error. You may imagine
that the five rounds which were being
shot all this while by a mere private
were somewhat spasmodic, especially
as he was used by all parties as an
illustration of their particular meanings.
Standing by myself all the time while
this unhappy man was severally in-
structed by N.C.O., Lieutenant, Major,
Adjutant, Brigadier, General and Per-
manent Staff, I was a little amused
to note that even so he failed to pass
his test And they all told him on no
account to be nervous about it.
You know the song, “Where the wind
blows, we'll go”? It is a great favourite
on the march; and full marching kit,
together with eighty rounds of ball
ammunition carried by each man, can-
not stop it. It is not a beautiful thing
in itself, and it is not made more attrac-
tive by being sung when the band is
playing something else. But it takes
little to turn a bad thing into a good
one. This morning Lieut. Wentworth,
not usually mounted, took out a party
for a route march, borrowing the Adju-
tant's horse for the purpose. As the
party marched away at ease, some of
their friends asked them where they
were going. They answered to music :
“Where the horse goes, we'll go.”
Wentworth tells me that this opinion
was not ill-founded.
Food is my strong subject at the
moment, for I have happened to be
orderly officer once or twice lately; in
other words I have been a sort of
detective housekeeper. The first thing
I have to do is to see that everybody
gets up at reveille—a charity, Charles,
which has to begin at home. But it is
at the cookhouse that I am supposed
to have my most deadly effect. You can
see me paying visits en surprise, all the
cooks springing to attention and the
very potatoes in the dixies trying to
look as if they weren't doing anything
wrong! The pleasing sensation of im-
portance having passed off, it is then
time for me to do something intelligent.
It is easy enough to tap a camp-kettle
with a nonchalant cane and commence
the removal of the lid, but it is much
more difficult to cope with the pieces
of boiled beef with which I am then
confronted. As a subject of conversa-
tion boiled beef is not, in my opinion,
a success: there are only two things
to ask about it—“Is it beef ?” “Is it
boiled ”’’ There is no way of finding
out its merits except by eating it, and
I simply cannot bring myself to steal
my men's food! The temptation is to
done that once and the Adjutant has
happened to be looking you don't do it
again. So I turn to the “pontoon,” a
composite dish containing everything
in the world which is edible and savoury,
and I ask the Cook-Sergeant why we
cannot get that sort of thing in peace
time, pay what we will. Oh, yes, my
boy, we in the officers' mess have long
abandoned our chefs and caterers, and
have taken to drawing out rations and,
secretly, thanking Heaven for the same.
You want to know what is to become
of us. I will tell you on absolutely
reliable information. We are going to
Cherbourg to stand by as a reserve force;
to Paris to act as a protection against
surprise attacks; to Ostend to relieve
the Casino; to Antwerp to resist
Zeppelins; to the French frontier to
guard lines of communication; to
Leicester to supervise German prisoners;
to Africa to conduct a show of our own;
to India, Malta, Gibraltar and Egypt
for garrison duty; to the North of
Scotland to protect coast towns (which
abound in that part); and to the right
of the Allies' first, the centre of the
Allies' second, and the left of the Allies'
third fighting line. That, Charles, is
our official programme: when we have
completed it we shall be getting near
Christmas. Then, of course, we pro-
ceed for rest and recreation to Berlin;
our one fear being that when we get
there we shall be turned on to military
police duty, and the protection of
German women and children against
their own men-folk.
Meanwhile to-morrow's programme
is less dashing. It consists of Church
Parade. The Musketry Detachment is
at some little distance from the main
body, so the Padre has arranged for a
private parade of our own. An officer
is to read the lessons and has been
instructed for the purpose. “The
Party,” as we call him for convenience,
“will move two paces forwald and, upon
the word ‘one,’ will take the look
smartly in the left hand. Upon the
word 'two' he will raise his right
thumb to his lower lip and moisten the
same, thus enabling it to turn over the
page efficiently. When this movement
is complete, he will cut away the right
hand sharply and proceed to carry out
his duties.” Don't suppose we are
irreligious—far from it; but always we
are disciplinarians. I believe there is
somewhere in the Infantry Training a
correct way laid down for blowing your
nose to numbers.
Yours ever, IIENRY.

A FOOD WAR.
SoME folk believe that wars commence
From greed of gain or self-defence;
But Austrian sages have divined
Incitements of a different kind.
The Servian Army (so 'tis said)
Has run completely out of bread,
And every day the hungry souls
Fight Austria for Vienna rolls.
The Austrian battles with the TsAR
Because he dotes on caviare,
And must that monarch's realm invade
Because he likes it freshly made.
The Russians cannot do without
The soul-sustaining sauerkraut,
And march their armies to the West
Because Berliners make the best.
The German confidently thinks
That absinthe is the prince of drinks,
And therefore must attack the land
That keeps the most seductive brand.
The Frenchman, tired of his ragoiſts,
Covets the meat that Teutons use,
And charges like an avalanche
For German-sausage, not revanche.
The Briton, vexed by rules austere,
Has heard the fame of German beer,
And nought his onward march can
sto
While Munich holds a single drop.
The bold Italian stands prepared
With rifle loaded, sabre bared,
And to a questioning world replies,
“Who touches my spaghetti, dies!”
THE CATCH.
I HAVE a friend who is a Special
Constable. He has had an experience
which by no means casts any discredit
upon him ; but he would rather not
write about it himself, he says; so I
take up the pen on his behalf.
My friend is an artist, and as such
is accustomed to use his eyes. The
other day he saw a smartly dressed
man whom he conceived to be a German
spy, for, besides wearing an alien
aspect, he carried a walking-stick which
tapered suspiciously on the way down,
and near the top of it was an obvious
little catch. “A sword stick 1" said
the Special Constable to himself.
He followed the man. The man
ultimately entered the purlieus of a
police station and joined a queue of
exotics who were waiting to be regis-
tered.
The Special Constable then accosted
a pukka Police Inspector who was
standing at the door and explained his
suspicion as to the walking-stick and
its probable contents. The Police In-

something in it. ... He beckoned to the
German. The alien enemy, trembling
palpably, came up to him.
“Any arms?" asked the Inspector.
“No,” replied the alien enemy, still
trembling. -
“Undo the catch of that stick,” com-
manded the Inspector. With fumbling
fingers the alien enemy did so—and
drew forth a silk umbrella.
Two consecutive advertisements in
The Portsmouth Evening News:–

A FOOD WAR.
Some folk believe that wars commence
From greed of gain or self-defence;
But Austrian sages have divined
Incitements of a different kind.
The Servian Army (so 'tis said)
Has run completely out of bread,
And every day the hungry souls
Fight Austria for Vienna rolls.
The Austrian battles with the TSAR
Because he dotes on caviare,
And must that monarch's realm invade
Because he likes it freshly made.
The Russians cannot do without
The soul-sustaining sauerkraut,
And march their armies to the West
Because Berliners make the best.
The German confidently thinks
That absinthe is the prince of drinks,
And therefore must attack the land
That keeps the most seductive brand.
The Frenchman, tired of his ragouts,
Covets the meat that Teutons use,
And charges like an avalanche
For German sausage, not revanche.
The Briton, vexed by rules austere,
Has heard the fame of German beer,
And nought his onward march can
stop
While Munich holds a single drop.
The bold Italian stands prepared
With rifle loaded, sabre bared,
And to a questioning world replies,
“Who touches my spaghetti, dies !"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
(SEPTEMBER 23, 1914.
AS ENGLAND EXPECTS.
WHEN the war broke out and Big
Ben had boomed the hour which
marked the rejection of the ultimatum,
Bates was full of fire. He had bought
a penny flag, and in a spirit of grim
determination had walkcd the streets,
processing with the processionists.
There was no brag or bounce about
him, no lyideousness of noise or
mafficking, no hatred of foreigners or
cruelty of uncharity, but a grim
steadfastness of determination which
meant that, so far as he might, Bates
would do or die.
He returned to his thiud-floor back
in St. Pancras, and, lighting his
lamp and a candle to ensure as much
illumination as possible, looked with
brooding earnestness at his reflection in
the worn uncertain looking-glass. . . .
He began to realise the truth of things.
The flag was in his button-hole, his
eye had a glint of lingering excitement,
his brain was ruffled ; he saw himself
as he was. England must fight,
Englishmen must help, for Fngland
could not fail. On her rested the truest
and noblest concerns of humanity.
Bates removed his coat. He was
five-foot two; his chest measurement
was less than proportionate to his
height. His muscles, so far as they
existed, were flabby. He moved his
arms to exercise their powers; then,
realising his weariness, went slowly to
bed. Bates was a little tiny man, but
his heart was large.
He was restless throughout the night,
rose but little refreshed, and breakfasted
badly. He went forth to his labours—
he was a ledger-clerk in some Stores—
feeling greatly depressed. Gradually,
however, that sense of oppression
passed. The world was full of sunshine,
and, though the faces of the passers-by
were anxious and unsmiling, there was
no despondency about them. Where no
despondency is, there surely is hope.
Bates began to feel hopeful. The sight
of a Territorial with a kitbag completed
his recovery. He strode out with an
unusual vigour, squared his poor chest,
swung his arms, and whistled softly to
himself the chorus of some piece of
music-hall patriotism—
“They can't build boys of the bull-dog
brecd ’’
By the time he reached the office—
well before the hour—he was a pug-
nacious and confident patriot for all
his scarcity of feet and inches.
The days that followed were full of
emotions and excitements. Three of
Bates's colleagues went the Khaki
way, and every hour brought some
discussion of international problems.
ments of high strategy. What KIT-
cHENER should do, and where CHARLIE
BEREsford should be sent, were ques-
tions confidently settled. Bates, whose
want of stature made him too insignifi-
cant to speak with confidence in these
discussions, held his peace, but listened
with both cars. What was the good
of this talk 2 It was incumbent on
Englishmen to do.
That night he was one of a multitude
who stood at the entrance of the local
drill-hall hoping to become Territorials.
He rather expected to be chaffed for
his pains, but, though there was plenty
of jollity among those waiting, there
was no unkindness; and at last, thanks
to squeezing and patience, he was able
to get within the charmed gate. So
far and no farther; not so far even as
to the medical officer. A watchful
sergeant grasped him by the shoulder,
and, sniling with earnest eyes, said:
“It's no use wasting your time here,
young fellow-my-lad | You'd better
shave your upper lip and apply to the
Boy Scouts.”
Bates turned on his heel and, sick at
heart, went out by a side door. He was
angry with himself, at his inadequate
inches. What could he do for England?
He was deeply grieved at his useless-
ness. He crept up to his room and
sat in the darkness, brooding.
His spirits were low for some days,
and the sight of regiments marching,
of soldiers with their friends, of placards
telling the truth and the not-so-truthful,
made him feel very futile. He spent
hours of every evening wandering
through the streets, watching the
lighted windows of Buckingham Palace,
gazing at the policemen who guarded
Downing Street. He wanted to do so
much for England, yet he must stand
and wait. He had left the mimic flag
in his pin-cushion at home; he was in
no mood for wearing it now.
Then an idea came to him.
spirits rose, his eyes brightened; he
walked again with something of a
martial swing, and whistled to him-
self softly and inoffensively that even
a neighbour might not have heard.
Bates had ſound his way. He too
could serve England. He sacrificed all
but his bare necessities, and grew
actually thinner and even less obtrusive.
His outer insignificance shrank, but
inwardly he was as happy as a warrior.
Pvery week a postal order went to this
relief-fund or to that. It was regularly
acknowledged to “One of the Bull-dog
IBreed.”
Bates wears his flag boldly and is
confident that we shall win.

THE WAR DAY BY DAY.
WE understand from our Special
War Correspondent, who is counting
the butter at Copenhagen, that great
activity is manifesting itself among the
officers and men of the German Slack-
Water Fleet. This is owing to the fact
that they are learning a new German
National Anthem which has just been
introduced into the Fleet, set to an old
English tune. A rough translation of
the chorus goes as follows:--
“Rule, Germania, Germania ever shall
Ru–u—u-u-u-u-ule the Kiel Canal.”
The order enforcing this new song is
| signed “WILHELM, Grand Admiral of
the Canal.”
The announcement that an indemnity
of 100,000 cigars had been levied on
Ghent created some little surprise. It
is a fact, however, that before the
campaign began a list of suitable in-
demnities for all the towns and villages
through which the Germans hoped to
pass had been drawn up by the ever-
ready General Staff. A list of such war
levies for various places in England has
accidentally come into our possession,
a dispatch-case containing this and
other important documents having been
dropped by a carrier-pigeon as it was
flying over Bouverie Street on its way
back to Berlin. We give a few examples,
so that our readers may know what to
expect:-
London. — £100,000,000, the Albert
Memorial and three-dozen special
constables.
Beaconsfield.—Mr. G. K. — (sup-
pressed by Censor).
Tonbridge.—100,000 cricket bats with
splices, 10,000 pairs of leg-
guards, and 1,000 wicket-keeping
gauntlets.
Greenwich.-200,000,000 bunches of
whitebait, 200,000 lemons, and
750,000 slices of brown bread
and butter.
Steeple Bumpstead.—£5,000,000 and
a mangold-wurzel. [Three
weeks will be given the inhabit-
ants in which to collect the
money, but the wurzel must be
handed over at once.j
By the way, the plan for this invasion
of England is a remarkably subtle one.
The invading army will be under the
command of the CRowN PRINCE, who,
| according to the latest reports, is now
fighting simultaneously on the eastern
and western frontiers of Germany, and
has volunteered for spare-time work.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, Sept. 14.
—House met to-day with proud feeling
of altered circumstance. A fortnight
ago things looked bad in France. Allied
Armies were continuing prolonged re-
treat not made more acceptable by
being officially named “Retirement.”
A detailed narrative compiled in neigh-
bourhood of the Army had described
the little British Force, long fighting
at odds of four to one, as “broken to
pieces.”
Seemed as if Paris were on verge of
another triumphal entry by German
forces: France on eve of a second
Sedan.
To-day a more hurried retreat is
daily accumulating speed. This time
it is the invader who, in order to avoid
final disaster, is racing back to the
comparative safety of his own country,
whilst French and British, elate with
repeated victory, hang with uncomfort-
able closeness on his heels.
“In the matter of carefully planned

Duke of York' on an expedition to
Flanders had “twice ten thousand men,”
how he “marched them up to the top
of the hill And marched them down
again"? The simple verse lends itself
with easy adaptability to present circum-
stances of our old friend the EMPEROR
WILLIAM :-
The gallant plumed WILHELM
Had twice a million men ;
IIc marched them up to Paris town
And marched them back again.”
As in depressing circumstances of a
fortnight ago the House betrayed no
sign of dejection or variation from re-
solve to see the fight out to a finish, so
to-day it does not present itself in
mafficking mood. It is nevertheless
more than ever resolved, at whatever
cost of blood or treasure, to make an
end of the throned KAISER and his
system of militarism, the curse of
Europe these more than twenty years.

Warlike Mistress. “DoN'T You This K, JAMEs, You would LIKE TO Jois LoRD KITCHENER's ARMY 2’
Peaceful Footman. “THANK You, MUM,
WHICH I NEVER DID."
BUT I Dox'T SEE. As "ow I 'D BE BETTERING
MYSELF, WAR's Fort THEM As LIKES IT,
DOUBT.
THE War has caused one thing
(among others). It has filled me with
an infinite distrust of human testimony.
Were I on a jury I should find every
one “Not guilty" now—unless, of
course, the prisoner were foolish enough
to bring evidence on his own behalf.
It is not the German Press Bureau
that has done this. It has maintained
its customary high standard with mag-
nificent consistency.
My faith in human testimony has
been shattered by Mactavish's uncle,
Bloomer's maiden aunt, and Wiggins'
brother-in-law. I put on one side the
statement of Mirfin's grandmother be-
cause her allegation that 193 trains
passed her house one night might have
been based on the shunting of a single
goods train. One knows the fiendish
persistency of the shunted goods train
at night.
But let me take the bald statement
of Mactavish's uncle. He is a baillie,
an elder and a drysalter. He wrote
to Mactavish:-"I regret that the atten-
dance at the Kirk on Sunday was most
unsatisfactory. The younger members
of the congregation were all watching
the disembarcation of the Cossacks. I
understand that the Established Kirk
held no services at all. I did not feel
it consistent with a proper observance
of the Sabbath to go and watch them
myself, so I only saw by chance, and
not intentionally, the six regiments
which marched past my house.”
What could be more conclusive than
that ?
The very next day Bloomer met me
and produced a much-crossed letter
from his pocket. “Just read the last
few lines,” he said triumphantly.
I read with zest.
“Damsons are very cheap this year.
I am jamming an extra quantity. Do
you think pots of jam could be safely
sent to the chaplains at the front ? Kiss
the dear baby for me. Excuse a longer
letter, but I am quite worn out with
handing hot meat pies to the Russian
troops passing through here.
Ever your affectionate Aunt,
MILLICENT BLooMER.”
Not “meat pies,” mark you, but “hot
meat pies.” Somehow that little touch
won my absolute belief.
Now we come to the solemn state-
ment of Wiggins' brother-in-law. He is,
according to Wiggins, a patriot of the
finest type—only prevented from going
to the front by the claims of business,
a family of nine, and a certain super-
fluity of adipose tissue. “When guard-
ing a railway bridge as a special con-
stable a troop train stopped through
an engine breakdown. Numbers of
finely built men, in fur coats descended
on to the line. Two of them came to
me and, making signs of thirst, said,
‘Vodka, vodka.' They embraced me
warmly after I had offered them my
pocket-flask, and then, shouting ‘Berlin,’
rejoined the train.”
I could quite believe that. Any
brother-in-law of Wiggins would have
a pocket-flask.
Yet the Press Bureausolemnly asserts
that no Russian troops have passed
through this country. I have now no
faith in anyone's uncles, aunts nor yet
brothers-in-law. I believe nothing.

"About clothes," I said,
There was an article I read in some

that if everybody did without them

Ursula did not smile. “No man can
be amusing about clothes except by

went on to advise that if new things
were bought they should be specially
good. It called this the truest economy
in the long run."
When Ursula had sketched out a com-

was a pause.

wistfully. “Fancy reading in the frock-
papers that “Ursula, Mrs. Brown, looked
charming in a creation of sacking made
Princess fashion, the chic effect being
heightened by a bold use of the original
trade-mark, which now formed a striking
décor for the corsage.’”
Ursula did not smile. “No man can
be amusing about clothes except by
accident,” she said coldly. “The article
went on to advise that if new things
were bought they should be specially
good. It called this the truest economy
in the long run.”
When Ursula had sketched out a com-
prehensive wardrobe on truest economy
lines, and I had mentally reviewed my
pet shades in autumn suitings, there
was a pause.
“What about the green-house?” I
asked suddenly.” Do we need a fire
there all winter just that John may
swagger about his chrysanths?”
John, I should explain, is the gar-
dener who jobs for us at seven-and-six
weekly, and “chrysanths” is a perfectly
beastly word that we have contracted
from him. In summer John mows the
lawn (fortissimo at 6.30 A.M.) and neg-
lects to weed the strawberries. In
winter he attends to what auctioneers
would call the “commodious glass.”
“M'yes,” said Ursula reflectively,
“But what about John himself 2"
“My dear girl, surely it is obvious by
the simplest political science * >
“Sweetheart 1" interposed Ursula
anxiously, “John isn't going to have
anything to do with the Moratorium or
hoarding gold, is he? Because, do
remember how cross you got trying to

“I remember nothing of the sort 1"

I suppose that never in the history of this nation did we
harbour quite so many military experts. From the Service
Clubs to the street corner their voice goes up daily in
unceasing hortation. Therefore the moment seems specially
apt for me to call your attention to a volume by a military
man who really was expert, in other words to a new edition
of PASLEy's Military Policy of the British Empire (CLow Es),
brought up to date by Colonel B. R. WARD, R.E. I blush
to think of the number of civilian readers to whom the
name of PASLEY conveys nothing. I blush still more to
reflect that I have myself only just ceased to belong to
them. But, quite honestly, if you are at all concerned
with the science and policy of arms (as who nowadays is
A few
chance quotations will be enough to prove that the gallant
Captain was a man who knew what he was writing about,
In the year 1810, for example, he could look ahead far

would be an anticlimax to do a job with the wall of a mere
dwelling-house, and, of course, he is absolutely precluded
from the common use of doors. I am afraid Mr. T. P.
VANEword's primary conception has been too much for
him: he lacks the nice imagination of a WELLs to carry it
off. Also he fails to deal with the humour of the position,
whether in the madhouse, the court of justice, the manager's
office or the palace, an elementary mistake which the most
amateur conjurer will always avoid. It is rather the
author's misfortune than his fault that his incidental picture
of war, introduced only as a new field of operation for his
prodigy, is rendered almost fatuous by the actual conditions
at present existing. .
When the father of Patience Tabernacle (MILLS AND

authoritative source—that we do well to lay to heart just

AN IMPERIAL OVERTURE.
From notes taken by a British airman while engaged in

Authorities do not wish the KAISER to be informed of
his own whereabouts.
Now let an awful silence hold the field,
And everybody else's mouth be sealed;
l'or lo! your KAISER (sound the warning gong')
Prepares to loose his clarion lips in song.
In time of War the poet gets his chance,
When even wingless Pegasi will prance;
Yet We, whose pinions oft outsoared the crow's,
Have hitherto confined Ourself to prose.
But who shall doubt that We could sing as well as
That warrior-bard Ty RTAEUs, late of Hellas,
Who woke the Spartans up with words and chorus
Twenty-six centuries B.U. (Before Us)?
Also, since Truth is near allied to Beauty,
We are convinced that We shall prove more fluty
Than certain British scribes whom We have read
(Recently published by The Bodley Head).
Well, then, it is Our purpose to inflame
Our soldiers' arteries with lust of ſame;
To give them something in the lyric line
That shall be tantamount to fumes of wine,
Yet not too heady, like the champagne (sweet)
That lately left them dormant in the street,
So that the British, coming up just then,
Took them for swine and not for gentlemen.
Rather we look to brace them, soul and limb,
With something in the nature of a hymn,
Which they may chant, assisted by the band,
While working backwards to the Fatherland.
Put to the air of Deutschland jiber alles
Or else to one of Our own sacred ballets,
The lilt of it should leave their hearts so fiery
That at the finish they would make enquiry—
“What would our ATTILA to-day have done?”
And, crying “Havoc' " go and play the Hun.
For there are some cathedrals standing yet,
And heavy is the task to Culture set,
Ere We may lay aside the holy rod
Made to chastise the foes of Us and God.
And now that We are fairly in the vein
Let Us proceed to build the lofty strain.
Ho! bid the Muse to enter and salute

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER,
No. II.
(From the IRev. Dr. Drya Norn, Court Chaplain.)
Most ALLGRACIot's SIR,-Now that I have finished
writing my sermon for next Sunday I can find time for a
little quiet sound thinking by way of a change. I can say
quite seriously that I am tired to death of writing and
preaching sermons. It is not permitted, highly honoured
EMPEROR, that in my sermon I say anything displeasing to
your Imperial self. I must not remind you that you are a
man like other men, a man liable to weakness and error,
swayed by temper, capable, since your position gives you
power, of trampling on the rights of others in a moment of
passion, of confounding justice with your own desires and
of mistaking the promptings of ambition or malice or envy
for an inspiration from Heaven itself. No, I must not say
all this or any of it, but, on the contrary, I must describe
you to yourself and your family and the chosen intimates
who flatter you beyond even my power to flatter, I must
describe you, I say, as the Lord's anointed, as the vice.
gerent of God on earth, as being raised by God's favour
above all human foibles, in short, as being supremely right
and just whenever your faults and your injustice cry aloud
for the divine punishment. Even if you were a thoroughly
good and sensible man, totus teres atque rotundus, instead
of being a bundle of caprice and prejudice, the task would
be difficult. As it is, it is unpleasant and ought to be im-
possible. My sermons exist to prove that I have attempted
it with such courage as I could command, although in these
conditions courage is only another name for the cowardly
compliance that causes a man to detest himself and to take
a low view of human nature.
At any rate I have done my best for you, How many
times have I not bidden the faithful to fall down before you
and worship you? Have I not proved from Holy Scripture
that your lightest word is spoken, not by you, but by the
Almighty; that you, in fact, are something higher and
better in bones and flesh and blood and brains than any-
thing that mere ordinary mortals can pretend to be? I can
see you nodding your head in Imperial approval when such
phrases came from me, and all the time I knew in my
heart that the God of whom you were thinking, and to
whose intimacy you pretended, was not the God under
whom a Christian minister takes service, but a being
formed after the image of a Prussian drill-sergeant who
wears a pointed helmet and a turned-up moustache.
Sir, I have my doubts as to this fearful war in which wo
are engaged. , You entered upon it, you say, to carry out
your treaty obligations to Austria. Treaties, no doubt, are
sacred things. But why, then, was not the treaty obliga.
tion to Belgium as sacred as that with Austria? Was it
because Belgium was weak and (as you thought) defence-
less that you invaded her country, slaughtered her people,
and sacked her towns? Was this the reason for the ſoul
treatment of Louvain? And is it agreeable, do you think,
to the Almighty that the glorious Cathedral of Rheims
should be bombarded and ruined even by German shells?
When the years have rolled on and you shall have been
called away to render an account of what you did on earth,
for what reasons will you be remembered amongst men?
Not because you established justice and did good deeds-
or even great ones – for your people, but because you
plunged the world in war in order to feed your vanity,
and laid waste Belgium and shattered the Cathedral of
Rheims. Truly a shining memory.
Yours, in all humility,
DRYANDER.

1 twelve. We that were left behind
composed explanations to our wives,
making it quite clear that we had volun-
teered, but pointing out that, as only
twelve could go, they had probably
chosen the ugliest ones first. Our three
heroes rejoined us during an “easy” an
hour later. The forlorn hope had been
to dig a hole and bury all the unused
fragments of last night's supper—the
gristly bits . . . And now, when three
volunteers are called for, the whole
company remains rooted to attention.
It is our keenness again; we are here
to drill; to form fours, to march, to
wheel; we want to learn to be soldiers,
not dustnen.
But naturally we differ in our ideas
upon the best way to learn—particu-
larly in regard to night-work. What
James says is, “Why be uncom-
fortable in camp? If I could do any-
thing for my country between the hours
of 10.30 P.M. and 5.30 A.M., I would do
it gladly. But if my country, speaking
through the gentleman who commands
my platoon, tells me to retire to my
tent with the fourteen loudest-breathers
in Middlesex, I may at least try to get
a little bit of sleep.” So he brings with
him two air-cushions, a pillow, three
blankets and a pair of bed-socks, and
does his best. On the other hand,
John says, “When one is on active
service one has to sleep anywhere.
Unless I am preparing for that mo-
ment, what am Fº: for at all?”
So he disdains the use of straw,
selects the hardest brick he can find for
his head, and wraps himself up in a
single coat. And I doubt if he sleeps
worse than James. Personally, I lie
awake all night listening to the snores
of the others and envying them their
repose . . . and I find that they all
º they have been doing the same.
t was James, by the way, who
created such a sensation the first time
he appeared on parade with all his
impedimenta. There was a shout of
laughter from the company—and then
a quiet voice behind me said reflectively,
“He decided not to bring the parrot.”

“There is a story here of a reservist, arriving

So—mist in the hollow
And leaf falling brown—
Ere home comes the swallow
May WILLIAM be down
And high stand the steeples
From Lincoln to Wells,
For parsons and peoples,
For birds and for bells |

A WAR-HORSE OF THE KING.
I KNEw you in the first flight of the Quorn,
One who never turned his gallant head aside
From bank or ditch, from double rail or thorn,
Or from any brook however deep and wide;
I know the love your owner on you spent :
I know the price he put upon your speed;
And I know he gave you freely, well content,
When his country called upon him in her need.
I have seen you in the bondage of the camp
With a heel-rope on a pastern raw and red,
Up and fighting at the stable-picket's tramp
With the courage of the way that you were bred ;
I have seen you standing, broken, in the rain,
Lone and fretting for a yesterday's caress;
1 have seen your valour spur you up again
From the sorrow that your patient eyes express.
Now in dreams I see your squadron at the Front,
You a war-horse with a hero on your back,
Taking bugles for the horn-blast of the hunt,
Taking musketry for music of the pack;
Made and mannered to the pattern of the rest,
You'll be up among the foremost and the best,
Or we'll never trust in Leicestershire again!
Youthful Patriot. “OH, MUMMY, YoU M TST SPEAR To BABY : HE 's Most Awfu LLY NAUGHTY. HE wox'T LET NURSE TARE. His

Gathered foam--and maybe blood—upon your rein,
IN A GOOD CAUSE.
War or no war, the children must have their Christmas
presents, and they wouldn't look at the usual toys made
in Germany, even if they could be had this year. The
Women's Emergency Corps has the matter in hand.
Some fascinating models have been designed and regis-
tered, and many women who were in need of work are
engaged in copying them under skilled direction. Funds
are needed badly at the start, though the scheme will
eventually support itself. For the children's sake, and
even more for the sake of the women-breadwinners to
whom the war has brought distress, Mr. Punch begs his
generous friends to help this work. Gifts should be
sent to The Duchess of Marlborough, Old Bedford
College, 8, York Place, Baker Street, W.
IN MEMORY. -
To Those who DIED IN THE EARLY DAY's of THE WAR.
Not theirs to triumph yet; but, where they stood,
Falling, to dye the earth with brave men's blood
For England's sake and duty. Be their name
Sacred among us. Wouldst thou seek to frame
Their fitting epitaph? Then let it be
Simple, as that which marked Thermopylae :-
“Tell it in England, thou that passest by,
-
IIcre faithful to their charge her soldiers lie.”

thing in harmony with the emotions of
the time. But frankly I cannot find in
the programme at the St. James's any
apparent sign of consideration for pre-
sent conditions. It is true that it
have been Mr. Roosevelt, in a mood
of exaltation, describing his river to
the Geographical Society. That clever
actress, Miss HENRIETTA WATsos, had
to play a difficult part as Trent's lover,
in a vein that, I think, is new to her.
She did it well, though she seemed to
start on a note of intensity which leſt
her too little margin for the time
when she really needed it; her appeal,
too, was rather to our intelligence
than our hearts. Mr. NIGEL PLAY FAIR,
waiving his gift of deliberate humour,
supplies excellent entertainment for
Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER, who has
plenty of occupation in a part that
suits him well. But I was thinking,
selfishly enough, of my own needs and
those of other non-combatants.
I admit that the scene in West Africa
was a diverting novelty. I had never
before, to my recollection, met a native
monarch from the Gold Coast, and I
have pleasure in accepting the assur-
ance of Mr. CRowTHER, Secretary for
Native Affairs in this district, that they
are like that. But it was impossible to
feel any very deep concern as to what
might happen to the damaged hero
(Michael Trent) on his return to
England after the failure of his rubber
schemes. The best he could hope for,
by way of consolation for being mis-
understood, was to become a co-respon-
dent in a suit brought by the chief
sitter-in-judgment. Even so we might
have contrived a little sympathy if the
woman's fifth-rate environment had not
made any community of tastes hope-
lessly improbable. For her, too, it
seemed to us a poor business that the
only encouragement she could offer him
in the undeserved ruin of his career was
to get it blasted all over again—and
this time on a true charge—by running
away with him.
But the rubber-man in the play was
never a hero. There in his Gold Coast
shanty we see his lover's young brother
dying of fever under his eyes. Yet
from the moment when he himself gets
a touch of the same complaint he takes
to brandy, and practically loses all
further interest—at any rate of a
coherent kind — in the fate of his
protégé. And at the end—though he
seems to take a good deal of personal
pride in the prospect—the only heroism
that lies before him is the living-down
of a sordid scandal in the divorce-court.
As Michael Trent, Mr. GEORGE ALEx-
ANDER played excellently, and I have
nothing to say against either the quality
orthequantity of his work,except that in
the First Act the tale of his experience
in the Beresu forest, which began with
a very natural air, developed into some-

meannesses of a certain phase of sub-

“YouNG Wisdom.”
Victoria was very young and very,
very wise. She knew all about the
slavery of the marriage-tie, the liberty of
the female subject, and high-sounding
things of that sort, and kept books of
advanced thinking secretly under her
mattress — where her little brother
found them and thought them dull,
and her mother found them and
thought them rather funny. Victoria's
theory was that all marriages ought to
be preceded by a trial trip, but it was
her sister Gail who had the pluck to
put this theory into practice. She
insisted on her young man, Peter,
eloping with her on the night before
their wedding. Peter, a simple gen-
tleman with a mouth permanently
open, was reluctantly persuaded.
Whereupon Christopher, the best man,
engaged to Victoria, insisted upon
Victoria also living up to her theory
and eloping without clerical assistance
—which she did almost as unwillingly
as Peter. The two couples meet at
midnight in an old moorland cottage
rented by an artist called Mar (no, not
the one you think), whereupon two
important things happen:-
(1) Gail decides in about twenty
minutes that she loves Mar, not Peter.
(2) Victoria decides that she hates
trial trips. So they all five go back
together, and, after a lot of “Tut-tut-
what-the-blank-upon-my-souls" from
the military stage-father, they sort
themselves out again and get married
properly—Peter being left over with a
cold in the head.
The author, Miss RACHEL CRothers,
has not strained herself severely in
writing Young Wisdom, and the result
is a pleasantly innocent little play,
which, thanks to the Misses MARGERY
And, finally, nothing became

pleasure. Miss MAUDE had a part with
a little comedy in it for once, and she

MEDITATIONS ON MUSHROOMS.
WE were playing the ancient and
honourable game of acrostics and we
had to think of and describe a word
bounded on the West by the initial E,
and on the East by the final H.
“That which you can never have of
mushrooms,” was one of the descrip-
tions. It was, of course, guessed at
once—“Enough;” and could there be a
trucr compliment to this strange exotic
delicacy, which costs nothing but a walk
in an early autumnal morning and is
more choice than the rarest flavours
ever designed by the most inspired of
chefs 2 For certainly there has never
been enough of them. I, at any rate,
have never had enough. The thought
of mushrooms missed must add pathos
to many a death-bed.
It is a terrible moment when the
dish comes in and one rapidly notes
the disparity between the paucity of its
contents and the vast and eager antici.
pation of the company. For it is use-
less to attempt to conceal greed when
mushrooms arrive. A certain amount
of dissimulation has mercifully been
given by a wise Providence to all of us
for the lubrication of the cogs of daily
life; but it does not extend so far as
this. And particularly so if the mush-
rooms have been fried in butter.
Stewed they are not of course to be
undervalued, especially if one dares to
soak one's bread in the juice; nor even
reposing in tragic isolation on Juan
Fernandezes of toast; but the real way
is to fry them in butter. As I say, it is
a terrible moment when the dish arrives
and the faces of the guests are studied;
but should there be one present, or
— more ecstatic moment still-two,
who confess to a dislike of this perilous
fungus, then what an access of rapture
by way of compensation' Truly wise
hostesses have been known to murmur
something about toadstools and risk, as
an encouragement to the doubters; ºr
if they don't their husbands do. It is
however no real good! Even with two
defaulters the dish does no more than
stimulate desire; whilst such is its
power of fascination that consummate
gourmets have been known to express
no dismay at the possibility of poisº

In no industrial survey of the present situation have I
seen any reliable estimate of the probable output of patriotic
romance. Yet the figures seem likely to be impressive.
One of the earliest samples is before me now. It is called
The Gate of England (HopDER AND Stoughton), with the
sub-title, A Romance of the Days of Drake, and is in every
way true to its admirable type. What I mean by this is that
it contains everything that you expect and are glad to find
—-a Virgin Queen, imperious and quick of retort, with a
generous eye for the claims of gallantry; a hero who
simply could not be more heroic; villains (of Spanish name,
priests, murderers, all a regular bad lot), and the right
proportion of female interest and humorous relief. Need I

Germanism, as here seen,
is the reductio ad absurdull
of the doctrine that all is
fair in war—and peace. It
is no less than blank
anarchy, philosophic and
practical, and indefinitely
less workable as a theory of
international life than that
of the so long discredited
Sermon on the Mount. The
honest Briton can find here
solid justification of his

less guilty than our arch-opponent; so thinks this sober
and wide-eyed critic . . . Certainly, and the more signifi-
cantly since it is without direction or intention of the
writer, one sees behind all the tragedy of these dark weeks

picture of a man of no more than common earthly wisdom
saddled with responsibilities that might well break the
nerve of a council of the gods. Is it well, if the matches

centrate your energies, for the immediate present, upon
one single purpose, and that is that you address all your
skill and all the valour of my soldiers to earterminate
first the treacherous English and walk over General
French's contemptible little Army."
WILHELM, I do not know your whereabouts.
The gods elude us. When we would detect your
Earthly address, 'tis veiled in misty doubts
Of devious conjecture.
At Nancy, in a moist trench, I am told
That you performed an unrehearsed lustration;
That there you linger, having caught a cold,
Followed by inflammation.
Others assert that your asbestos hut,
Conveyed (with you inside) to Polish regions,
Promises to afford a likely butt -
To Russia's wingéd legions.
But, whether this or that (or both) be true,
Or merely tales of which we have the air full,
In any case I say, “O WILHELM, do,

Tor if, by evil chance, upon your head,
Your precious head, some impious shell alighted,
I should regard my dearest hopes as dead,
My occupation blighted.
I want to save you for another scene,

That stimulates an itching, very keen,
In every Briton's best toe—
An Order issued to your Army's flower,
Giving instructions most precise and stringent
For the immediate wiping out of our

Well, that's a reason why I'd see you spared;
So take no risks, but rather heed my warning,
Because I have a little plan prepared
For Potsdam, one fine morning.

No. III. - -
(From the EMPEROR-KING or ArstRIA-HUNGARY)
My very DEAR BROTHER AND BEST FRIEND,--I seize a
few moments of leisure to write and congratulate you, as I
congratulate myself, on this constant succession of almost
incredible victories that have brought new laurels to your
arms. Your presence in Paris at the head of the splendid
troops whom you have conducted from triumph to triumph
places the coping-stone on your life's work. Oh, that it
had been possible for your dear old grandfather—I did not
always value him as he deserved—to have lived to see this
glory. But, then, I suppose your part in the work would
have been less brilliant and prominent, so, perhaps, all is
To have captured the whole French army; to have driven
the English army into the sea and drowned them in what
they call their own element (by the way, when are you
going to make your triumphal entry into London 2); to
have brought the ungrateful Belgians to recognise you not
merely as their conqueror but also as their benefactor—all
this is really almost enough of honour for one man. But
in addition you have made the plans which have kept so
many of the disgraceful Russians cooped up in their own
country, and you will soon, I am sure, lead your troops to
Moscow and on to Petersburg. My own brave fellows shall
march shoulder to shoulder with them. Nothing will be
impossible to these armies thus united and thus led.
What my noble soldiers have hitherto done has been
tremendous and overwhelming. You have, of course, read
the bulletins issued by our War Office. These, however,
give an inadequate idea of what has taken place, and you
will, I am sure, forgive me if with the natural pride of an
old man Irelate to you these matters in their true propor-
tions. We have made a military promenade through
Montenegro and Servia and have annexed both these
troublesome countries. Only ten Servians and four
Montenegrins have been leſt alive, so that in future, it
may be hoped, we shall not be vexed by any of their
conspiracies. In the Adriatic we have made mincemeat
of the combined British and French fleets, and have thus
removed from the wretched Italians any temptation to
join in the war against us. It was a magnificent victory,
quite equal to that in which your grand fleet sunk the
whole of the British fleet in the North Sea. Finally, as
you know, we have driven the Russians before us like
chaff before the wind. Many hundred thousand Russians,
with guns, ammunition and battle flags, have been taken
prisoners and are interned here in Vienna. All these mighty
deeds have been performed by our soldiers and sailors at an
infinitesimal cost. I doubt if we have had two hundred
men killed and wounded. Surely it is a great thing to be
alive in these glorious days. -
What pleases me, I may say, as much as anything else,
is the wonderſul example of generosity and humanity which
your army and mine have been able to offer to the world.
I shudder to think what would have happened to Belgium,
to Germany and to ourselves, had the French, the Russians
and the English been victorious. Villages would have been
burnt, civilians with their women and children would have
been massacred, churches and cathedrals would have been
laid in ruins, and whole countries would have been devas.

and then fetch some straw for my bed

think of something else for you. We've

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Having recently
dropped into several London theatres
and halls of variety I have been struck
by the numerical strength, agility and
apparently abounding vitality of the
young men forming the chorus. These
gallant fellows sing and caper with the
utmost spirit throughout the whole
evening, both in musical comedy or
revue; and in London alone, where
revues are now being postponed at

He be more than a thousand of them.
to impersonate recruits—the chorus to
the recruiting songs which have crept
into more than one programme—and
they make, I can assure you, Sir, a
very brave show with their rifles and
their military paces, a little accelerated
perhaps by the exigencies of the tune,
but a marvel of discipline none the less.
Watching these brisk and efficient
male choruses at work, the thought
has come to me—in fact has often been
forced upon me by the martial nature
of the musical number which they
were engaged in rendering with so
much capability and cheerfulness—
that at a time when England is par-
ticularly in need of her young men
in the field, the audiences of London
might consent to forgo a little of the
pleasure that comes from watching ath-
letic youths covered with
grease-paint and gyrating
in the limelight, and, by
expressing their readiness
to see these necessary evo-
lutions carried out by older
men, liberate so much good
material to join the Army.
Such is the power of the
make-up (I am told) that
a man of fifty could easily
be arranged to look suffi.
ciently like a man of half
his age, at any rate with-
out imperilling the success
of the entertainment from
the point of view of the
spectator. And of course
the girls will remain in all
their charm, since girls
cannot enlist.
The point may be worth
considering. The decision,
I feel sure, rests entirely
with the public. If the public says:
“Let the young men go, and give us
more mature choristers for a while, and
we will patriotically endeavour to en-
dure the privation"—then all the young
men will, of course, enlist as one. But
unless the public says this they must re-
main in the choruses against the grain.
I am, Sir, Yours gratefully,
OVER AGE.

As it is, it works beautifully, though
Madame Mercier and her two daughters
speak no English, for Sinclair's French
is perfectly adequate.
It was during his absence that we
learned that my neighbour, Andrew
Henderson, the dairy farmer, had also

call round every morning to interpret
and give 'em a good start for the day.”
Sinclair was ſull of ze l and set off
next day after breakfast. From the
drawing-room window we watched
his triumphant entry into the farm-
yard at the foot of the hill. But he
came back in a dejected frame of mind.
“She’s called Suzanne,” he told us,
“and she's quite a nice-looking sort
of woman, and she handles a turnip-
cutter like an expert; but she talks
nothing but Flemish.”
“We might have thought of that,”
said the Reverend Henry. “Still, I
daresay they'll manage all right.”
“On the contrary,” said Sinclair.
“Henderson sent Suzanne to get the
letters last night. She was gone a
long, long time, and at last came back
with three live fowls in a sack. She
had been chasing them round the hen-
house for all she was worth. Things
can't go on like that, you know."
The Reverend Henry had an idea.
“The only way out of it,” he said, “is
for you and Madame Mercier both to
go. She knows Flemish.”

on to Madame Mercier in French; she
transmits it to Suzanne in Flemish–
and there you are ' "
“Right-o!” said Sinclair, “We'll
have a shot to-morrow morning.”

gentle creature, was most anxious to
help, and again we viewed the opera-

Suzanne, eager and expectant, like a
hound on the leash, waited, shovel in

and head-shaking and a dreary retreat
up the hill. Madame Mercier seemed
to be much amused.
“We have decided to adjourn,” said
Sinclair. “The truth is, we were not
getting on at all. It looks as if you
will have to come too.”
“I was always afraid there were
weak spots in you, after all, Sinclair,”
said the Reverend Henry. “It does
not surprise me. You are all right in
table French or even in domestic, rail-
way or restaurant French, but as soon
as we get outside of your beat into

“It isn't that,” said Sinclair. “I'm
all right. It's that confounded fellow,
Henderson. I'm hanged if I can
understand a word of his Scotch.
Never heard such a lingo in my life.”
It is true that Henderson, who comes
from some obscure district far North
even of this, is a little difficult to under-
stand. I have found him so myself.
“He said he wanted Suzanne to
‘redd up the fauls,’ as far as I could
gather. Well, I have no idea what
the fauls are, and I don't see how she
is going to read them up in a language
she doesn't understand. I had to give
him up. We can't get on without
your help.”
That afternoon the Interpretation
Committee, now increased to four
active members, for Henry had insisted
on coming too as referee, took up its
position in the farm-yard in the ſorm of
a chain, along which communication
was to pass from Henderson, through
me, Sinclair and Madame Mercier to
Suzanne. It was a little embarrassing
for Suzanne, but she stood her ground
well and waited in an admirably re-
ceptive mood, while the various items
percolated through. Henderson gave
me in careful detail the whole of his
commands for her normal daily life,
and everything seemed to go splendidly.
But I am afraid the thing must have
passed through too many hands before
it reached its destination; for Suzanne,
after many cheerful nods, suddenly
broke off and turned on her heel. Then
she secured an axe, which was lying
against the bothy door, and walked
| with a steady and fixed purpose, never
turning her head, out into the lane,
through the gate and up the hill. We
watched her spellbound till she reached
the horizon, and there saw her pause,

“I am sorry,” said Mr. FitzJenkins,

“My paper,” I said, “would like to

“Well, if you ask me what I think

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
WHY is it that novels with scamp-heroes are so much
more interesting than the conventional kind? Bellamy
(METHUEN) is a case in point, for the central character,
who gives his name to it, is about as worthless an object,
rightly considered, as one need wish to meet. He steals
and lies and poses; he betrays most of his friends; and
throughout a varied life he only really cares for one person
—himself. Yet Miss ELINor MoRDAUNT never seems to
have any difficulty in making us share Bellamy's delight
in his own conscienceless career. Perhaps it is this very
delight that does the trick. Charlatan as he is, and worse,
Bellamy is always so attractively amused at the success of
his impostures that it becomes impossible to avoid an
answering grin. It was not a little courageous of Miss
MoRDAUNT to write a story about a hero from the Five
Towns district; but, though this may look like trespass
upon the preserves of a brother novelist, Bellamy is Miss
MoRDAUNT's very own. I have the feeling that she enjoyed
writing about him—a feeling that always makes for pleasure
in reading. Perhaps of all his manifold phases I liked
best his rôle of assistant necromancer at a kind of psychical
beauty parlour. There is some shrewd hitting here, which
is vastly well done. But none of the adventures of Bellamy
should be skipped. I am sorry to add that the copy

am persuaded were most agreeable pages. The fact that it
so far relented as to go back about ten, and repeat a chapter
I had already read, did little to console me. I could have
better spared part of a duller book.
A story by Mr. Dion CLAYTON CALTHROP, with the title
Wonderful Woman (HopDER AND Stoughton), may almost
be regarded as a work of expert reference. Because what he
does not know about The Sex, and has not already written
in a galaxy of engaging romances, is hardly worth the bother
of remembering. So that his views on the matter naturally
command respect. Wonderful Woman is perhaps less a
novel than an analysis—painfully close, with a kind of
regretful brutality in it—of one special type of femininity,
and a glance at several others. Perhaps its realistic quality
may astonish you a little... You may have been delighting
in Mr. CALTHROP's fantastic work (as I do myself) and yet
have cherished the suspicion that his Columbines and
Chelsea fairies and Moonbeam folk generally were the
creations of a sentimentalist who would have little taste for
handling unsympathetic things. Well, if so, Philippina is
the answer to that. Here is the most masterly portraiture
of a woman utterly without imagination or heart or any-
thing except a kind of futile and worthless attraction, that
I remember to have met for some time. As I say, it is all

RENAMED CELEBRITIES.
SINCE the publication of the mani-
festo in our columns signed by a large
number of eminent men who announced
their intention of divosting themselves
of the un-Christian name of William,
matters have moved far and fast.
Many of these gentlemen have already,
in obedience to the dictates of logic,
assumed a new style, as may be gathered
from the following messages which the
Press Bureau, without accepting re-
sponsibility for them, graciously per-
mits us to reproduce:—
The Reverend WILLIAxi Spoon ER, the
revered Warden of New College, Ox-
ford, writes to say that, in deference to
the unanimous desire of the graduates
and undergraduates of the College, he
has decided to be known in future as
the Reverend Peter Spooner, as a tribute
to the Kinquering Cong of Serbia.
Mr. WILLIAM (WULLIE) PARK, the
famous professional golfer, has decided
to assume the praenomen of Pinkstone
FRENCH), and is already known amongst
his intimates as “Pinkie.”
Mr. WILLIAM LE QUEUx has by a
special deed poll assumed the title of
George Albert Nicolas Victor-Emmanuel
Raymond Woodrow Le Queux, but for
literary purposes will briefly sign him-
Self “Alb.”
Mr. WILLIAM DE MoRGAN, the famous
novelist, as the son of AUGUSTU's DE
MoRGAN, has happily hit on the idea
of renaming himself Marcellus de Mor-
gan. But he is anxious to have it
clearly understood that this does not
involve him in any claim to the author-
ship of Marcella.
A communication has been received
by the Editor of The Spiritualist from
WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, announcing his
unalterable resolve to change his
Christian name because of the posthu-
mous discredit attached to it by the
KAISER. Asked what he proposed to
substitute for it, the Bard created a
prodigious sensation by announcing
that he thought Francis would do as
| Sir WILLIAM Jop Collins, equally
renowned in the spheres of politics and
medicine, has promptly recognised the
impossibility of continuing to wear a
name which has been indelibly tar-
inished by the arch-disturber of Europe's
peace. He has accordingly elected to
replace his first two names by the in-
genious and harmonious collocation of
Thomas Habakkuk.
Mr. HARold BEGISIE writes to ex-
plain that, though his first name is not
William, it has painful historical asso-
ciations with the success of a former
William. He therefore wishes it to be
known that he will sign all his articles,
interviews and poems with the name
Oliver Lodge David Lloyd George
Begbie, as an act of homage to the two
great men who have chiefly inspired
him in his journalistic and literary
Career.

DEAR CHARLEs, You must forgive
my writing this letter with a fountain
pen, but to do otherwise would be an
act of ingratitude to my servant, Private
J. B. Cox. I told him this morning
that I had lost my pocket pen, a cheap
affair made of tin. I instructed him to
find it, and J. B. is one of those perfect
factotums who do as they are told.
He has a sharp eye and no scruples,
and so, owing to the fact that three
other officers live in my billet, he was
able to find two valuable fountain pens
and one stylographic in no time. The
exigencies of war necessitate --
some little irregularity now and
then; but how, I asked him, did -
he justify this excess of zeal 2 |
J. B. is distinguished by a lisp
among other things. “It’th
betht to be on the thafe thide,
Thir,” said he.
We had an all-night outpost
job on this week, at which my
company achieved an unpre-
meditated success—unpremedi-
tated by the authorities, that
is. Before setting out we
had been threatened with the
heaviest penalties if we were
discovered at any moment in
a dereliction of duty, which
meant that the Adjutant pro-
posed to pay us a surprise
visit and had every hope of
discovering responsible officers
asleep at their posts. Those
who know will tell you that

It used to be our Brigadier's fad that
officers commanding companies should
know the names of all their men, and
lately he took upon himself to test it.
Captain aſter captain, upon being asked
to name a selected man, had to confess
ignorance; not so my skipper. He
knew them all. “What is that man's
name?” asked the Brigadier, indicating
an inconspicuous and rather terrified
private, just that sort of man whose
name one would never know or want
to know. (It was something rather
like Postlethwaite, I believe). ºf wo

anticipated all along, this was the time
selected for the surprise visit. But we
were not caught napping, Sir ; every
possible approach to our picket was
account and least of all those who
attempted to trick them by a pretence
of authority, however realistic that
pretence might be. Thus it fell out
that when the Adjutant was sighted
he was instantly accosted and firmly
apprehended. Inasmuch as he refused
to be led blindfold through our lines,
he was not allowed to approach our
august selves at all, but was retained
until such time as we cared to approach
him. Mind you, I'm not saying we
were asleep; merely I show you how
thoroughly we do our work. It is not
mine that is the master mind; it is my

That night, at dinner, the Brigadier
told the C.O. that, among many disap-
pointments, he had found one officer
who seemed to know the names of his
men “almost better than the men did
themselves." In accordance with
J. B.'s maxim about being on the safe
side, it was a company order afterwards
that, when asked, all even numbers
were to be “Evans” and odd numbers
“Hodges,” till further notice.
Talking about names, I was quite
homesick for old London when, in
calling the names and regimental num-
proper equipment, and whether each

tion Ceremony (First Performance) on
Saturday. We could not put too strict
a discipline upon men into whose arms
we were just about to insert fifteen
million microbes apiece, and our
private was not slow to seize his
opportunity. He insisted upon his
fifteen million being numbered off in
order to discover whether there were
any of them absent from parade; he
wished to know if they had all their
— had passed his standard test.
As the needle was inserted into
his arm, “Move to the left in
fours,” he ordered them; “form
fours — left — in succession of
divisions—number one leading
—quick-ma-harch.” (It was
the same humorist who recently
took a strong line about pro-
tective colouring, and put in an
application for a set of khaki
teeth.)
At the moment of inoculation
we were all, officers and men,
very facetious and off - hand
about it, but as the evening
came on we grew piano, even
miserable, Mess was not made
any less sombre by Wentworth's
plaintive observation that “the
doctor who had succeeded
in making a thousand of us
thoroughly ill and debarred us
from the cheering influence of
alcohol was probably at that
very moment himself enjoying
a hearty debauch."
The only effect of the dose
upon me was to induce a rather

rose at 8.30 A.M. (an incredibly late
hour), did next to nothing all day and,
when I wanted to go away, just went.
I used in those gentle days to take
off my hat to ladies (a long-forgotten
habit), and I never dreamed of calling
anybody “Sir.” I used to suppose that
I should rise from stuff to silk, from
silk to ermine, to conclude as a Judge

that I may rise from stars to crowns:
from crowns to oakleaves, and end

THE TRAITOR.
“Down with the Teutons !” rose the people's cry;
“Who said that England's honour was for sale 2"
Myself, I hunted out the local spy,
Tore down his pole and cast him into jail.
“An English barber now,” said I, “ or none
This thatch shall never fall before a Hun!”
And all was well until that fateful morn
When, truss'd for shearing in a stranger's shop,
“Be careful, please,” I said, “I want it shorn
Close round the ears, but leave it long on top;"
And, thrilling with a pleasant pride of race,
I watched the fellow's homely British face.
An optimist he was. “Those German brutes,
They'll get wot for. You mark my words,” he said,
And dragged great chunks of hair out by the roots,
Forgetting mine was not a German head.
“Oh, yes, they'll get it in the neck,” said he
And gaily emphasized his prophecy.
Ah me, that ruthless Britisher! He scored
His parallel entrenchments round and round
My quivering scalp. “Invade us 'ere?" he roared;
“Not bloomin' likely Not on British ground !”
His nimble scissors left a row of scars
To point the prowess of our gallant Tars.
I bore it without movement, save a start
Induc’d by one shrewd gash behind the ear.
With silent fortitude I watch'd him part
The ruin on my skull. And then a tear,
A fat, round tear, well'd up from either eye–

Jules François is poet, and gallant and gay;
Jules François makes frocks in the Rue de la Paix;
Since the mobilisation Jules François's the one
That sits by the breech of a galloping gun,
In the team of a galloping gun
When the wheatfields of August stood white on the

Jules François was ordered to go to Lorraine,
Since the guns would get flirting with good Mr. KRUPP
And wanted Jules François to limber them up,
To lay and to limber them up !
The road it was dusty, the road it was long,
But there was Jules François to make you a song;
He sang them a song, and he fondled his gun,
Though I wouldn't translate it he sang it A1;
His battery thought it A1 !
The morning was fresh and the morning was cool
When they stopped in an orchard two miles out
of Toul, -
And the grey muzzles spat through the grey muzzles'
smoke,
And there was Jules François to make you a joke,
To crack his idea of a joke:—
“The road to our Paris 'tis hard as can be;
The road to that London he halts at the sea;
So, vois-tu, mon gars 2 'tis as certain as sin

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ENTER BINGO.
BEFore I introduce Bingo I must
say a word for Humphrey, his sparring
partner.
Humphrey found himself on the top
of my stocking last December—put
there, I fancy, by Celia, though she says
it was Father Christmas. He is a small
yellow dog, with glass optics, and the
| label round his neck said, “His eyes
move.” When I had finished the
oranges and sweets and nuts, when
Celia and I had pulled the crackers,
Humphrey remained over to sit on the
music-stool, with the air of one playing
the pianola. In this position he found
his uses. There are times when a
husband may legitimately be annoyed ;
at these times it was pleasant to kick
Humphrey off his stool on to the divan,
to stand on the divan and kick him on
to the sofa, to stand on the sofa and
kick him on to the book-case; and then,
feeling another man, to replace him on
the music-stool and apologise to Celia.
It was thus that he lost his tail.
When the War broke out we wrote
to the War Office, offering to mobilise
Humphrey. Already he could do
“Eyes right, eyes front.” . But the
loss of his tail was against him. Re-
jected by the medical authorities as
unfit, he returned to the music-stool
and waited for a job. It was at this
moment that Bingo joined the estab-
lishment.
Here we say good-bye to Humphrey
for the present; Bingo claims our at-
tention. Bingo arrived as an absurd
little black tub of puppiness, warranted
(by a pedigree as long as your arm) to
grow into a Pekinese. It was Celia's
idea to call him Bingo; because (a
ridiculous reason) as a child she had
had a poodle called Bingo. The less
said about poodles the better; why
rake up the past?
“If there is the slightest chance of
Bingo—of this animal growing up into
a poodle,” I said, “he leaves my house
at once.”
“My poodle,” said Celia, “was a
lovely dog.”
(Of course she was only a child then.
She wouldn't know.)
“The point is this,” I said firmly,
“our puppy is meant for a Pekinese-
the pedigree says so. From the look of
him it will be touch and go whether he
pulls it off. To call him by the name
of a late poodle may just be the deciding
factor. Now I hate poodles; I hate
pet dogs. A Pekinese is not a pet dog;
he is an undersized lion. Our puppy
may grow into a small lion, or a mastiff,
or anything like that; but I will not
have him a poodle. If we call him
|tion in his presence that you once had
a-a-you know what I mean—called
Bingo?”
She promised. I have forgiven her for
having once loved a poodle. I beg you
to forget about it. There is now only
one Bingo, and he is a Pekinese puppy.
However, after we had decided to call
him Bingo, a difficulty arose. Bingo's
pedigree is full of names like Li Hung
Chang and Sun Yat San; had we chosen
a sufficiently Chinese name for him 2
Apart from what was due to his ances-
tors, were we encouraging him enough
to grow into a Pekinese? What was
there Oriental about “Bingo”2
In itself, apparently, little. And
Bingo himself must have felt this;
for his tail continued to be nothing
but a rat's tail, and his body to be
nothing but a fat tub, and his head
to be almost the head of any little
puppy in the world. He felt it deeply.
\When I chaffed him about it he tried
to eat my ankles. I had only to go
into the room in which he was, and
murmur, “Rat's tail,” to myself, or
(more offensive still) “Chewed string,”
for him to rush at me. “Where, O
Bingo, is that delicate feather curling
gracefully over the back, which was
the pride and glory of thy great-grand-
father ? Is the caudal affix of the
rodent thy apology for it 2 ” And
Bingo would whimper with shame.
Then we began to look him up in
the map.
I found a Chinese town called
“Ning-po,” which strikes me as very
much like “Bing-go,” and Celia found
another one called “Yung-Ping,” which
might just as well be “Yung-Bing,”
the obvious name of Bingo's heir when
he has one. These facts being commu-
nicated to Bingo, his nose immediately
began to go back a little and his tub
to develop something of a waist. But
what finally decided him was a discovery
of mine made only yesterday. There
is a Japanese province called Bingo.
Japanese, not Chinese, it is true; but at
least it is Oriental. In any case con-
ceive one's pride in realising suddenly
that one has been called aſter a province
and not after a poodle. It has deter-
mined Bingo unalterably to grow up
in the right way.
You have Bingo now definitely a
Pekinese. That being so, I may refer
to his ancestors, always an object of
veneration among these Easterns. I
speak of (hats off, please!) Ch. Good-
wood Lo.
Of course you know (I didn't myself
till last week) that “Ch.” stands
for “Champion.” On the male side
Champion Goodwood Lo is Bingo's
great-great-grandfather. On the female
grandfather. One couldn't be a poodle
after that. A fortnight after Bingo
! came to us we found in a Pekinese book
a photograph of Goodwood Lo. How
proud we all were ! Then we saw
above it, “Celebrities of the Past, The
Late * x -
Champion Goodwood Lo was no
more' In one moment Bingo had lost
both his great-grandfather and his
great-great-grandfather!
We broke it to him as gently as
possible, but the double shock was too
much, and he passed the ovening in
acute depression. Annoyed with my
tactlessness in letting him know any-
thing about it, I kicked Humphrey off
his stool. Humphrey, I forgot to say,
has a squeak if kicked in the right
place. He squeaked.
Bingo, at that time still uncertain
of his destiny, had at least the courage
of the lion. Just for a moment he
hesitated. Then with a pounce he was
upon Humphrey. -
Till then I had regarded Humphrey
—save for his power of rolling the eyes
and his habit of taking long jumps from
the music-stool to the book-case—as
rather a sedentary character. But in
the fight which followed he put up an
amazingly good resistance. At one
time he was underneath Bingo; the
next moment he had Bingo down; first
one, then the other, seemed to gain the
advantage. But blood will tell. Hum:
phrey's ancestry is unknown; I blush
to say that it may possibly be German.
Bingo had Goodwood Lo to support
him—in two places. Gradually he got
the upper hand; and at last, taking
the reluctant Humphrey by the ear, he
dragged him laboriously beneath the
sofa. He emerged alone, with tail
wagging, and was taken on to his
mistress's lap. There he slept, his grief
forgotten. -
So Humphrey has found a job.
Whenever Bingo wants exercise, Hum:
phrey plants himself in the middle of
the room, his eyes cast upwards in an
affectation of innocence. “I’m just sit-
ting here,” says Humphrey; “I believe
there's a fly on the ceiling.” It is a
challenge which no great-grandson ºf
Goodwood Lo could resist. With a rush
Bingo is at him. “I’ll learn you tº
stand in my way,” he splutters. And
the great dust-up begins . . .
Brave little Bingo! I don't wonder
that so warlike a race as the Japanese
has called a province after him.

THAT section of the public that has

BEATS.
(By Special P.C.. XXX.)
WE have three, each with its nuances
of attraction, its delicately different
disadvantages. They are known as the
Oil Wharves, the Generating Station,
and the Sewage Station. A wise decree
from Scotland Yard leaves us uncertain
up to the very last moment of each
evening as to which will be our allotted
beat. A gambling element is thus
provided to stimulate us.
The Oil Wharves gloom on a cul-
de-sac of nocturnal emptiness. I -
Scarcely does a human footstep
come to rouse the petroleum-
sluggish echoes. A padding
pussy makes a note of Sheery
liveliness in the lukewarm
monotony of the night-watch.
But against that dreariness
must be set the four wooden
chairs which the Oil Magnates
(blessings upon them and upon
their children's children () pro-
vide for our comfort. Techni-
cally, it may be undignified
for a Special Constable to sit
down. It is possible that a
penalty of three days in a dark
cell awaits the transgressor,
We do not know, and we do
not enquire. In that deadliest
hour beyond the dawn, when
the street lamps splutter out
and the ruthless morning light
reveals us to one another un-
washed, unshaven and horribly
all-nighty in appearance, it is
indeed a grateful relief to sit
down on the wooden Windsor
chair and wait the six o'clock
of release in blankness of mind.
The Generating Station, we
are given to understand, does
some magic with electricity.
That is not our concern. We
are there to pace up and '-
down outside its walls, and watch
for the man with the bomb. It has
the advantage of being a bulky
building; therefore a long beat. . . Up
to midnight it looks over to a blank
wall which forms a London lovers'
lane. We speculate on the progress
of courtship. The Generating Station
is not odorous, and therefore is
accounted the picked beat by the
aesthetes among us.
The Sewage Station, on the other
hand, is very lively with odours. They
dominate our meals for at least twenty-
four hours after duty. Some attribute
them to a candle-factory opposite,
labelling them as warm decomposing
tallow. Another school of thought
places them as the outcast débris of a

years ago, taken up to the House of
Lords. On the one side a string of
tough sturdy bargees testified that a

to face their dinner. On the other side

We were also informed, in discreet
whispers, that the “Guv'nor" of the
Station “had it in for us.” His griev-
ance was this: that while a rival show
across the river had been accorded a
military picket by the War Office, he
had been fobbed off with a mere guard
of Special Constables. To date of writ-
ing, his wrath still smoulders.
Our hours of duty are filled with
dulness, but we live in hopes. That

The machinery of the Station has
hitherto been idle. Its borough officials
apparently do nothing but fitfully
polish brasses. It seems that these
lucky sinecurists only work in times of
violent storm, once every few months.
The neighbourhood may be odorous,
but it is full of human possibilities.
One midnight, two ladies started a
scrap. A Special Constable, raw and
without experience of militant femin-
inity, blew his police-whistle. The
whole slum-district turned out, dressed
or half-dressed, like a fevered anthill. It
took the regular police half-an-hour to

“But if I cannot go as a soldier I will

he called to the taxi-driver as he leapt
on to a passing bus.
Half-an-hour later Bertram, disguised
in the uniform of a spy, turned up the
Strand and his coat-collar simultane-
ously and walked rapidly to Charing
Cross station. He just managed to
scramble into the 2.19 as it steamed
from the platform at 3.7.

Bertram got out of the train at Kart-

The aide-de-camp saluted, flung him-
self on to a fresh mule and galloped
hell for leather to the canteen.
“I am much obliged for the informa-
tion you have given me,” said Bertram
politely. “It is of paramount import-
ance.”
“You’re quite welcome,” remarked
the General. “By-the-by, what do you
want it for 2"
Our hero rapidly shaved off Wigson's
moustache and drew himself up proudly.
“I am a spy,” he said.
“I suspected as much,” commented
the General. “Kindly touch that bell
on the mantelpiece behind you.”
Bertram touched it; it was as cold
as ice.
“See if it will ring,” suggested the
General.
Bertram seized it by the handle and
shook, it violently. In a moment or
two it rang. A sentry entered.
“Einzweidrei vierfiinf,” said the
General, “and riddle him with bullets
at eight to-morrow morning.”
Ill.
Early the next morning a knock
sounded on the door of Bertram's cell.
The doomed man crossed the room and
shot back the bolt. An officer armed
with a howitzer entered.
“I am instructed to inform you,” he
said, “that as you are shortly to be
shot you are entitled, according to
custom, to choose whatever you wish
for breakfast.”
“Thank you,” replied Bertram, “a
cup of weak tea and a rusk. Unfortu-
nately I am a chronic dyspeptic, or I
would take fuller advantage of your
kind hospitality.”
A devilish gleam shot from the
other's eyes as he heard those words.
“As you will be dead in an hour,”
he said, “the fact of your being a dys-
peptic need not trouble you any more
than if you were an acrostic. Let me
therefore suggest that you try a sausage
or a knuckle of pork.”
Bertram reeled against the piano.
Here was an opportunity to gratify his
palate without regard to the conse-
quences. Quickly he made up his mind.
“Bring me then,” he said, “a plate
of sausage and sauerkraut, a slab of
marzipan and some Limburger cheese.”
- IV,
It wanted but a few minutes to eight,
and Bertram Borstal, with steady
nerves, waited for the striking of the
cuckoo-clock in the prison tower. Once
again a knock sounded upon the cell
door, and with the utmost sang-froid
he drew the key from his pocket and
unlocked it. The honorary secretary
of Germany entered, preceded by three
“I am ready,” declared Bertram,
calm but pale, “and resigned to my
fate.”
“I am happy to say,” said the secre-
tary, “that I am unable to accept your
resignation. We recognise the fact
that you are only a spy, and therefore
cannot strictly be said to be bearing
arms against us. We have therefore to
apologise for having arrested you; but
at the same time I would ask you
kindly to bear in mind that at these
times we have much to think about,
and mistakes will happen. You are
free.”
“Free?” repeated Bertram, unable
to believe either of his ears.
“Yes, you are free,” said the secre-
tary, “and I am empowered to add that
under the circumstances no charge will
be made for your breakfast. Hochach-
tungsvoll.”
He withdrew, and Bertram, picking
up his umbrella and gloves, quickly
followed him.
W.
Half an hour later Bertram had again
entered the German lines, imploring to
be shot for pity's sake. But it was too
late; all the rifles were in use in the
firing-line. It was not till he heard
this that Bertram Borstal, racked with
indigestion, realised the atrocious bar-
barity of his reprieve.
SWISS LEAVE.
“It’ll be over by Christmas all
right,” said James again, but without
conviction,
“Maybe,” I said; “Christmas, 1918,
you mean, I suppose?”
James called me a rude name, as
soldiers will, and relapsed into moody
silence.
I knew what the trouble was. Iſe
had booked a room at Spitzeheider for
three weeks in January. They were to
be the same party as last year, he had
said at first; but on cross-examination
it appeared that this referred solely to a
lady who was described with exagger-
ated unconcern as being “rather a
good sort.”
And now here were James and I
in one of KITCHENER's camps at –,

However it was found that “His

the board.
“Cheer up, James,” I said, “Spitze-

even if ‘the same party’ are all married
to other people.”
James did not think my remark in
the best possible taste, and said as |
much.
Then he looked up from the map he
had been studying with a glad cry.
“Do you know, I think it will be all
right after all,” he said; “I’ve been
working it out, and I think it more
than possible that we shall by January
be guarding lines of communication
somewhere not so very far from the
Swiss frontier. I can get three weeks'
leave, join the party at Spitzeheider,
and at the end rejoin our gallant troops
in the field.”
“The Swiss won't much care for your
marching into their country armed to
the teeth,” I said. “You know, James,
you cut a very commanding figure in
regimentals. I won't say that a
somewhat conservative tailor has alto-
gether realised that we are inferior
physically but superior intellectually to

much too big and the hat much too
small.

“Oh, that will be all right!” he said;
“I shall take a change of clothes and
leave my uniform and rifle in the cloak-
room at the frontier station, and get
them out again on the way back."
I saw he was in a mood for sweeping
aside all difficulties and said no more.

|N OUR VILLAGE.
To Mrs. Irobinson, The Wigwam,
Threads, Nr. Bradford.
From Mrs. Cushat, The Vicarage,
Yellowcubs, Leicestershire.
- Oct. 8, 1914.
DEAREST SIssie, I have been far too
busy to write before. In this “Clash
of Nations,” as James finely said in his
last sermon, I am distracted to find
suitable holiday amusements for the
children. Fräulein should have re-
turned from her holiday in Berlin six
weeks ago and was prevented with
all her boxes ready packed to come;
but perhaps it's as well, as James
speaks of the Germans in the strongest
terms—quite rightly so, of course; but
one would be sorry for the poor girl to
feel ashamed of her relations. -
Our only alien is poor old Miss
Schmidt, who has taught music for
thirty years. We all try to be lenient
and nice to her at my work-parties,
which are widely attended. James calls
them a mixture of Dorcas and Bellona
—ask Harry to explain. The boys are
helping to make saddle-pads for the
horses at the front. They try each pad
on our old Dobbin and are wild for him
to go on service at once; but James has
just decided that a Vicar's pony's place
is in the last line of the Reserves.
You asked me how long the war
would continue. . We have had quite
a lot of talk with the Admiral and
dear old General Ramrod about it; but
James says, with the utmost respect
for their characters, that these naval
and military men are so hide-bound.
In his opinion hostilities will be over in
two months from now. He says:
When the British Lion roars
Foreign legions go indoors'
You know his funny way. The boys
are now shouting this all about the
garden, and trying to roar like lions.
1 have the greatest difficulty in pre-
venting them from going to fight other
children out of sheer patriotism. The
darlings do look so nice and smart. I
could not resist buying them flags
and tin swords and helmets like real
soldiers in spite of the Moratorium,
which I called by mistake crematorium,
and James made delightful fun about
it. He also said some clever thing about
banks which I can't recall; it may
come to me later.
Every one talks of nothing but the
war. Even the errand-boys must have
their say; I caught one of them setting
up our nice loin chops in the dusty
drive and knocking them down with
pebbles for bombs; while the girl who
fetched the laundry stayed for an hour
bandaging, and dinner was spoilt in
consequence. However these are all
the little discomforts of war and must
be borne in a cheerful spirit.
Your affectionate Sister, MARY.
P.S.–Dear James's joke was about
John Bull and bullion. Harry will
understand and appreciate it.
MY BROTHER'S LETTER.
RELATIONs used to be for the most
part a bore, and, unless rich, it was well
that they were disregarded. But the
war has altered all that. The war has
brought relations, no matter how hum-
ble, into fashion.
Not all, but some. I have as a
matter of fact myself one brother in
the Fusiliers, in camp, and another who
is a special constable and three times
has reported an airship by telephone;
but these do not count. It is fathers,
brothers, cousins, sons, uncles and
nephews at the Front who count.
Anyone who can refer to a real re-
lation at the Front is just now conver-
sationally on velvet, while, if a letter
from this relation can be produced and
read, everyone else must give way. Syd-
NEY SMITHs, THEoDoRE Hooks, Rich ARD
Poiºso Ns, THoMAs BABINGTON MACAU-
LAYs even, would be three-a-penny to-
day as against one obscure individual
who happened to have a brother in the
trenches and a letter in his hand-
writing. - - - - *
But that is not all. There is reflected
glory too. To know a person who has
a relation at the Front is to be im-
measurably promoted socially, and
most of the conversations which one
overhears in trains and elsewhere have
some such opening as this: “A friend
of my brother's has seen a Belgian
. . .” “A cousin of my wife's who is
a doctor in a field hospital says . . .”
“I know a man who was talking with
a wounded Tommy, and he . . .” “An
undergraduate friend of my boy's who
is just back from France . . .”
stories begun in this way would empty
a room; but not so now. Now they
no longer devastate but fascinate.
It does not matter what the stories
are about, the fact remains that an
opening gambit which three months
ago would stamp a man as a triple bore
now holds everyone breathless. In
short, relations at last have come to
their own. Another achievement of
WILLIAM HoHENzoLLERN
For the most part they bear upon
German atrocities, just as a little while
ago they were the preliminaries to un-
mistakable evidence of the presence in
this country of thousands of Russians
travelling from Scotland to Southamp-
Once
mysterious ways. I myself believed in
those Russians absolutely, and relin-
quished them with pain and sorrow;
and all because they were attested to
by other people's relations. This helps
to show what a hold the relation is
getting on us. In fact no story of the
war is now possible without some kith
and kin in it. - -
Personally I am much out in the
cold. Those two brothers I told you
of may serve to fill a gap now and
then—a gap left by other more enter-
taining raconteurs—but they are not,
as I said, any real good. Both are in
England, and one will never leave it.
But if things were different . . . If
only that soldier brother had joined
earlier and had written to me from
Rheims, say, or Compiègne, how my
stock would fly up! Or if that other
one would even now fling away his
truncheon, enlist in time to share the
march to Berlin, and then sit down to
tell me all about it, what a swell I
should become! How dinner-parties
would assemble to hear me ! -
As it is, I have to-day to do the
best I can either with the tame home-
keeping exploits of these two, or, by
listening with excessive sympathy or by
other parasitical endeavour, acquire a
reversionary interest in someone else's
relation's narrative. I have even, in
order to cut some sort of a figure in a
company where relations were being
used with dashing success—I have
even gone so far as to appropriate the
gardener's boy's uncle, last heard of
from Cambrai, as a personal and com-
municative friend, and claim an intimate
association with his letter home.
And how splendid if all that could
be changed 1 - ---,
“My brother,” I could say boldly
and with truth, “my brother has sent
me a few lines from Berlin, the
substance of which you might care to
hear.” Of course they would be fall:
ing over each other to hear, but that
is my artful way. “He camſ
out,” I should go on, “in the Thier-
garten. He says that to see the
French waving their arms and cheer-
ing on the top of the Brandenburg
Gate was one of the finest things
possible to imagine. He had one bit
of special luck: he was chosen to be
one of the guard to protect the removal
of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum pic-
tures which are coming to London. He
says that among these is the famous
portrait of ALEXANDER DEL BORRO
(No. 413A) which is among our little
lot."
That would be worth living for—the
triumph of that relation's letter! It
cannot, I fear, be mine; but surely it

Then, after much frowning, he delivered himself of the
following, the ink being shared equally between himself and
the paper:—
“The wor was becose the beljums wouldent let the

He then leaned back with the air of, one who had done
his duty in the sphere in which he
proceeded to survey the room. . . . . . . . . . . .
The other boys were still writing, and for fully half a
minute Tommy looked at them in pained surprise.
He then read his own essay again and, finding no flaw
in it, frowned once more on his fellow pupils and wrote:
“My father won the Victoria Cross Meddle." Having
written this he looked round again somewhat defiantly.
Tommy's essay just filled two-thirds of a page. He
would fight that new boy. Just then the words of a war
poster game into his head and he wrote in large letters:
old enufor I'd go my brothers gone I'm not a funk. I let
Jones miner push a needle into my finger to show him."
It seemed to Tommy Brown that the other boys possessed
some secret fund of information, even the new boys.
He'd show those new boys after school. Having made up
his mind on this point he printed at the bottom of his
essay, “Kitchener wants men.” As an after-thought he
added, “My father was a man.”
He let his gaze wander round the room until it fell upon
the face of his master, and then, under some impulse, he
wrote the fateful words, “Mr. Smith is a man.” -
“Finish off now!” rang out the command from Mr. Smith,
Tommy saw the other boys putting sheet after sheet
together, and he had hardly filted one. He racked his
brains for something to add to his essay, and there camº
to his mind the words written under his father's portrait;
He had only time to put down “England expecs—

EDITION.
MRs. HENRY looked up. “I think I
hear that boy again selling evening
papers," she said. “I suppose they
must come off the 9.5 train. But it's
a strange thing to happen on a Sun-
day—here.”
The Reverend Henry was already at
the window. He threw it up and
leaned out.
“One can't approve of it, but I sup-
pose in war time—” Mrs. Henry was
beginning when her husband cut her
short. “Hush—I'm trying to hear
what he is saying. I wish boys could
be taught to speak distinctly.” There
was a pause.
“I can't make him out." The Rev-
erend Henry's head reappeared between
the curtains. “It's really most exas-
perating; I'd give a lot to know if the
Belgian army got out of Antwerp
before it fell."
“Couldn't you shout down and ask
him 2 "
“No, no. I cannot be discovered
interrogating urchins about secular
affairs from a second storey window
on Sunday evening. Still, I'd like to
know.” -
The Reverend Henry perambulated
the room with knitted brow.
“I never bought a Sunday paper of
any sort in my life. Never.”
“I suppose one must have some
principles,” said his wife.
“But it's enormously important, you
know. They may easily have been
surrounded and captured.” He returned
to the window. “Hullo, he's gone to
the door. I say, Cook has bought
one. This is exciting. I should never
have thought Cook would have done
that." - -
“It raises rather a nice point,” said
Mrs. Henry. -
The Reverend Henry returned reso-
lutely to his book. The shouts of the
newsvendor died away.
“We must not forget,” said the
Reverend Henry irrelevantly, “that
Cook is a Dissenter.” Then suddenly
} he broke out. “I wish I knew,” he
| said. “I am not paying the least
attention to this book and I shan't
sleep well, and I shall get up about two
hours before the morning paper arrives,
and be restive till I know whether the
Belgians got out. But what am I to
do? I can't ask Cook.”
“I might go down,” his wife volun-
teered. “I needn't say anything about
it, you know. I could just stroll about
the kitchen and change the orders for
breakfast. The paper is pretty sure to

with determination, “I really cannot

splendidly. . . . -
It was at this precise
moment that the grand-

moment Jessie entered

were the five drawing-

intact, the single ditto with
a piece out, two breakfast
cups and two odd ones.
So the one player, the kitchen clock,
whose part had been overlooked, had
spoilt the whole show by being nearly
fifteen minutes fast; and the fact that
Jessie tripped on the doormat as she
came in, with fatal results to the rest
of our tea-things, was a mere circum-
stance.
Alison blames me for everything.

WAR ITEMS.
THE reiterated accusations made by
Germany of the use of dum-dum
bullets by the Allies, although they are
not believed by anyone else, appear to
be accepted without question by the
German General Staff. New measures
of retaliation are being taken, which,
while not strictly forbidden by Inter-
national Law, may at any rate be said
to contravene the etiquette of civilised
warfare. We learn from Sir John
FRENch’s Eye-witness that numbers of
gramophones have made their appear-
ance in the German trenches north of
the Aisne River.
Papers captured in the pocket of a
member of the German Army Service
Corps contain bitter complaints of the
enormous strain thrown upon the
already over-taxed railway system in
Germany by the KAISER's repeated
journeys to and fro between the
Eastern and the Western Theatres of
War. He is referred to (rather flip-
pantly) as “The Imperial Pendulum ”
cognising the eager devotion with
which the KAISER is pursuing his search
for a victory in the face of repeated
disappointment, congratulates himself
that the Imperial journeys, though
they are not likely to be discontinued,
will at least grow shorter and shorter
as time goes on. Indeed, it is hoped
that before long a brief spin in the
Imperial automobile-de-luxe will cover
the ground between the Eastern and
Western Theatres.
WORKS OF KULTUR.
IN some respects, apparently, the
enemy has been less affected by the
War than we have. While in England
the book - trade has been slightly de-
pressed, in Germany it seems to be
flourishing. We give samples from the
latest catalogues:—
PoETRY.
The most interesting volume an-
nounced is A Hunning We Will Go,
and Other Verses, by WILLIAM HoHEN-
zoLLERN, whose Bleeding Heart at-
be enquired for is The Dogs of St.

FICTION.
The demand for fiction in Germany

should be a demand for Der Tag , or,
It Never Can Happen Again.

RoosevelT UNMAskEd.
It is sad to relate, but persistent
efforts to maintain the disinterested
claim on American friendship which
we Germans have always (when in
need of it) advanced, continue to be
misrepresented in that stronghold of
atheistical materialism and Byzantine
voluptuousness, New York. To the
gifted Professer von Schwank's chal-
lenge, that he could not fill a single
“scrap of paper” with the record of
acts of war on our part which were
incompatible with Divine guidance and
the promulgation of the higher culture,

This act of treachery proves that, in-
stead of Germany being the aggressor,
France has been cunningly preparing
| ever since 1212 A.D. for the war which
at last even our chivalrous diplomacy
has been powerless to avert.
GENERous OFFER To MonAco.
It is time for Monaco to reconsider
its position. Should it maintain its
present short-sighted and untenable
neutrality what has it to gain from
England, France, or Russia? Nothing
that it has not already got. Monaco
very naturally wants something more.
Let us be frank. We of Germany
THE SLUMP IN CRIME.
“PRAISE is due to criminals,” re-
marked Mr. Robert WALLACE, K.C.,
at the London Sessions, “for the self-
control they are exercising during this
period of stress and anxiety.”
It is to be feared that Mr. WALLACE's
views are not entirely shared by the
legal profession. As the junior partner
in Mowlem & Mowlem confided to our
representative: “That's all very fine,
but what's to become of us? Not a
burglar on our books for the last six
weeks. Not a confidence man; not a
coiner; not a note expert. And they |

Roosevelºp has merely replied,

very poor stuff and worthy only
of a creature who combines with
the intellectual development of
a gorilla the pachymenia of
the rhinoceros and the dental
physiognomy of the wart-hog.
Roos, Evel.T, once our friend, is
plainly the enemy and must be
watched. Should he decide,
however, even at the eleventh
hour, to fall in line with civili-
sation, he can rely on finding in
Germany, in return for any little
acts of useful neutrality which
he may be able to perform, a
generous ally, a faithful up-
holder of treaty obligations,
and a tenacious friend. There
must surely be something that
America covets—something be-
longing to one of our enemies.
Between men of honour we need
say no more.
BASE CALUMNY Exposed.
Let us speak plainly with re-
gard to the Rheims affair. We
have successively maintained
that this
Arimaspian decadence (1) was not in-
jured in any way; (2) was only blown
to pieces in conformity with the rules
of civilised warfare; (3) was mutilated
and fired by our unscrupulous and
barbaric opponents themselves; (4)
was deliberately pushed into our line of
fire on the night of the 19th September;
(5) never existed at all, being indeed an
elaborate but puerile fiction basely in-
vented by abaffled enemy with the object
of discrediting our enlightened army in
the eyes of neutral Powers. . Any of
these was good enough, but what now
appears is better. Exact measurements
have since demonstrated beyond all
question of cavil that Rheims Cathedral
had been built with mathematical
accuracy to shield our contemptible
over-rated monument of

speak very differently. It is not desir-
able to be specific, but short of that
we may say that whatever Monaco
asks for it will be promised. England,
we would then repeat, is the enemy,
Has Monaco forgotten the sinister
malignity of an article in an English
paper disclosing “How to Break the
Bank at Monte Carlo.” It is unneces-
sary to labour the point, to which we
will return in our next issue. Monaco,
in short, like Turkey, Bolivia, China,
the United States, Hayti and Oman, is
the natural ally of Germany.

WITH HIGH HEART.
THE long line of red earth twisted
away until it was lost in the fringe of
a small copse on the left and had dipped
behind a hillock on the right. Flat
lands and fields of stubble, lifeless and
deserted.
There was no enemy to be seen and
not even a puff of smoke to suggest his
whereabouts. But the air was full of
the booming of heavy guns and the
rising eerie shriek of the shrapnel.
Behind the line of red earth lay the
British, each man with his rifle cuddled
lovingly to his shoulder, a useless
weapon that yet conveyed a sense of
comfort. The shells were bursting with
hideous accuracy — sharp flashes of
white light, a loud report and then a
murderous rain of shrapnel.
“Crikey!” said a little man in filthy
rain-sodden khaki, as a handful of earth
rose up and hit him on the shoulder;
“crikey!, that was a narsty shave for
your uncle!”
The big man beside him grunted and
shifted half an inch of dead cigarette
from one corner of his mouth to the
other. “You can 'old my 'and,” said
he with a grin.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“THE COST,”
Mr. Samuel Woodhouse, of the mid-
dle classes, being anxious to distract
his son John during the critical mo-
ments of Mrs. John's confinement,
relates how, in similar circumstances
more directly affecting himself, he had
been playing tennis, and the strain of
the crisis had quite put him off his
game. The little jest is, of course,
adapted from the familiar lines:–
“I was playing golf the day
When the Germans landed . . ."
It is of material interest not so much
because it is borrowed (for it is not the
only joke that Mr. THURSTON has con-
veyed) as because it serves as a brief epi-
tome of the play. For the thing started
with the War, and we were getting on
quite well with it when an element of
| obstetrics was introduced and became
inextricably interwoven with the origi-
nal design. Indeed it went further
and affected the destinies of the country
at large. For England had to wait till
the baby was born before it could
secure its father's services as the most
unlikely recruit in the kingdom.
But you must hear more about this
John. He was an intellectual, who
threatened to achieve the apex of
literary renown with a work in two
volumes (a third was to follow) on the
Philosophy of Moral Courage. At the
outbreak of the present war he was at
once torn asunder between his duty to
his country and his duty to himself. The
latter seemed to have the greater claim
upon him, and this view was en-
couraged by an officer who found him-
self billeted upon the Woodhouse
ménage. The dilemma had already wor-
ried John (and us) a good deal even before
the extension of the age limit made him
roughly eligible for the army. Indeed
| I never quite gathered what it was
that ultimately decided him to enlist.
Anyhow, six months later he received
a bullet in the head, and the wound,
though I am glad to say that he sur-
vived it, left him incapable of any
further intellectual strain. .
That was “the cost" of the war to
| him. Its cost to us (in the play) was
almost as heavy. For John's head still
| retained such a command of brain power
that he contrived to be very fluent over
his theories of war in general, theories
not likely to be of any vital service at a
time when our men of fighting age are
wanted to act and not think.
I give little for Mr. Thurston's gen-
eralities (his talk of “hysteria,” which
was never a British foible, showed his
lack of elementary observation), but
the character of John intrigued me as
very common among quite good fellows,
who is more concerned to satisfy his
own sense of the proper thing to do
than to consider in what way, less
romantic perhaps, he can best devote
to the service of his country the gifts
with which nature has endowed him.
The play went very well for the first
two Acts. The various members of
the Woodhouse family were excellently
differentiated. The father (played with
admirable humour by Mr. FREDERICK
Ross) bore bravely the shock to his
trade, and took a manly but quite in-
effectual part in household duties for
which he had no calling. His lachry-
mose wife (Miss MARY RoRKE) was a
sound example of the worst possible
mother of soldiers. John we know, and
Mr. Owen NAREs knew him too, and very
thoroughly. John's wife (I can't think
how she came to marry him) had the
makings of an Amazon and would
gladly have spared her husband for
KITCHENER's Army at the earliest mo-
ment. Her part was played very
sincerely and charmingly by Miss
BARBARA EveREST. John's eldest
sister regretted the war because she
had some nice friends in Germany, but
she caught the spirit of menial service
from her sisters, of whom the younger
was a stage-flapper of the loudest. Fin-
ally the second son (Mr. JACK Hobbs)
was a nut who began with his heart in
his socks but shifted it later into the
enemy's trench.
Perhaps the best performance of all
—though it had little to do with the
war and nothing to do with child-birth
—was that of Miss HANNAH Jones as
Mrs. Pinhouse, a perfect peach of a
cook. There were also two characters
played off. One was a maid-servant
who declined to come to family prayers
on the ground of other distractions. I
admired her courage. The other was
Michael, the precious infant whose
entry into the world had occupied so
much of our evening. Everybody on
the stage had to have a look at him.
I felt no such desire. He bored me.
For a play that made pretence to a
|serious purpose there was far too much
time thrown away on mere trivialities.
At first the exigencies of the stage
demanded compression. The news of
the ultimatum to Germany, the mobil-
isation, the rush to enlist, the attack
on Germany's commerce, were all
stuffed into the space of a few
minutes. But the whole of the Third
Act (laid in the kitchen) was wantonly
wasted over the thinnest of domestic
humour. - -
There is a light side, thank Heaven,
even to war; but Mr. THURSTON had a
great chance of doing serious good and
(though he may call me a prig for say:
ing it) that if he had set himself to
serve his country's cause through the
great influence which the theatre com-
mands, he could have done better work
than this; and he ought to have done it.

LITERARY GOSSIP.
AMong the more notable novels an-
nounced for immediate publication is
The Man in the Platinum Mask by
Samson Wolf (Black and Crosswell).
By a curious and wholly undesigned
coincidence the name of the hero is
ATTILA, while a further touch of
actuality is lent to the romance by the
fact that the author's aunt's first
husband fought in the Italian War of
Independence. - -
Another story strangely opportune
in its title, which was however chosen
many months ago, is With Nelson in
the North by Hector Boffin (Arrow and
Long-i'-th'-bow). Its appeal to the
patriotic reader will be further en-
hanced by the interesting news that
the author's wife's maiden name was
Collingwood, while he himself is a
great admirer of HARDY. -

a Life of Attii,A by Principal McTavish,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SURPRISE.
A SEQUEL TO “THE CHOICE.”
Mr. Julius Bannockburn hung up his
hat with a bang and stepped angrily
into the drawing-room.
Mrs. Bannockburn was comfortably
seated in an arm-chair, with the tea-
table at her side and a fire blazing.
“That's right,” she said placidly,
ignoring her husband's very obvious
mental disarray, “just in time for a
cup of tea.”
“No tea for me,” he said darkly.
“Oh, yes. It'll do you good,” she
replied, and poured some out.
“By the way, how much do you
give for this tea 2" Mr. Bannockburn
sharply inquired. -
“Two-and-eight,” she replied.
He grunted. “I get excellent tea in
the City which retails at two shillings
a pound,” he said. “Better than this.”
“Well, dear,” said Mrs. Bannockburn,
“you don't often have this. This is my
tea. You prefer Indian."
“And why so many different kinds
of cake?” Mr. Bannockburn went on.
“You wouldn't grudge me those?”
she answered. “Surely, even with the
war, little things like that might go
On 2 '' -
Mr. Bannockburn sent his eyes round
the room on a tour of critical explora-
tion. -
“Yes,” he continued, “and how can
you do with a fire—at any rate such a
fire—on a day like this? The room is
like an oven.” He scowled murderously
at the innocent flames and opened the
window. - * , - -
“I felt distinctly chilly,” said Mrs.
Bannockburn. “Besides, a fire is so
much more cheerful."
“Cheerful!” said Mr. Bannockburn
with a snarl. “I’m glad something is
cheerful.” w
“My dear,” said his wife soothingly,
“you're over-worried. You've had a
hard day at the office. But I've got
something to show you that will make
you happy again.” She smiled gaily.
“Happy : ” Mr. Bannockburn echoed
with abysmal bitterness. “Happy!”
IIe groaned. -
“Yes, happy,” said his wife. “Now
drink your tea,” she added, “and then
light a cigar and tell me all about it.”
“Cigars : " said Mr. Bannockburn;
“I've done with cigars. At any rate
with Havanas. We're on the brin
of ruin, I tell you.” -
“Not any longer,” said his wife with
a little confident laugh. “That's all
right now. Taking the new name was
to settle that, you know." -
Mr. Bannockburn was attempting to
eat a cake, but at these words he gave
lit a cigar—a Havana. “Well, what
is it you want to show me 2" he
asked,
“The cards,” she said. “They look
splendid. Here,” and she handed a
visiting-card across the table and drew
his attention to the delicate copper-
plate in which their new name had
been inscribed: “Mrs. Julius Bannock-
burn.” -
Mr. Bannockburn scowled afresh,
“How many of these have you
ordered ?” he asked anxiously.
“Five hundred for each of us,” she
replied. “And they're done. They all
came this morning.”
Mr. Bannockburn groaned again.
“What ridiculous haste . " he said.
“Where was all the hurry 2” • .
Mrs. Bannockburn laughed. “Well,
I must say!" she exclaimed. “You to
complain of things being done quickly
I've done all you told me,” she con-
tinued. “Everything. I sent a notice

you would like that.” :
Mr. Bannockburn puffed at his cigar
and said nothing.
“Aren't I a good head clerk?” she
went on. “But, after all, when one
does change one's name it is wise to go
right through with it, isn't it?”
“Yes,” said her husband ominously,
“when one does change one's name.”
“What do you mean?" Mrs. Ban-
nockburn asked sharply. “Has any-
thing gone wrong?” -
“Everything,” he said. “I’ve had
a notice forbidding changes of name
altogether. Everyone has had it.”
“When did you get it?” his wife
inquired with a flutter. * * *
“To-day.” -
“Then it's all right,” she said ex-
citedly. “We made the change several
days ago.” -
“Yes,” replied her husband, “but the
notice goes on to say that everyone who
has changed since the war began must
revert to the name he had before the
war commenced. You can't get away
from that.” - . -
“But we paid for it,” Mrs. Bannock-
burn exclaimed. “We paid for it.
Why did they take our money?”
“They didn't know then,” said her
lord. “It's only just decided by this
infernal Government.”
Mrs. Bannockburn turned white.
“This is terrible,” she said. “And
how unfair! How grossly unfair! It's
not as if we were Germans. I’m not
I even went further ||
and ordered a few silver labels for your
German's son, and British to the core.

“It says nothing about that,” replied
the Briton.
“How very unlike England : " she
said.
“Yes,” he agreed; “but the point is, |
apart from the horrible expense of it
all, that here we are, saddled with a
name which is bound to keep customers
away and which we thought we had
got rid of for ever. It’s horrible. It's
wrong. It's a shame.” He paced the
room furiously.
Mrs. Bannockburn—or, as we now
should say, Mrs. Blumenbach—looked
in the fire for a few moments in silence.
“Well,” she said at last, “we must
make the best of it, I suppose; we're
not paupers anyway, and things are
never so bad as one fears. After all,
we haven't been to so very much ex-
pense. A few cards and so forth. You,
dear, can hardly have spent a penny
over it.”
“Eh,” said Mr. Blumenbach sharply
—“what?” .
“I said that the cost to which we
have gone since we changed our name
is very trifling,” his wife repeated.
“You yourself have been put to no
expense at all, except perhaps office
paper.” - |
Mr. Blumenbach looked suspiciously
at her and resumed his walk. “No,
no,” he said: “that's fortunate cer-
tainly.” -
At this moment a servant entered
bringing the post, which included a
long roll of paper addressed to “Mrs.
Julius Bannockburn.”
“I wonder what this can be,” she
remarked as she reached for a paper-
knife. - * , - . . ;
Her husband snatched it and held it
behind him, “Oh, I know all about
that,” he said; “it’s a mistake. It's
meant for me, not you." ...”
“But it's addressed to me,” said his
wife. “Please let me have it.” -
Mr. Blumenbach for a moment
flashed lightning. “Oh, all right," he
said, “take it. I might as well confess
to my folly, and, after all, I did it as a
pleasant surprise for you, even though
it's a failure. But I heard about some
heraldic fellow, and I got him to
draw me up a Bannockburn pedigree.
A Scotch one, you know. I was going
to have it framed in the hall. Burn

“Was it—was it—very expensive?
his wife asked tremblingly. -

at his own recklessness and half as

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I can imagine the feelings of a romantic maiden who,
prone to choose her novels by title, has set down on her
library list The Price of Love (METHUEN), and finds herself
landed with one of Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT's intimate little
guides to “Bursley” and the four other drab towns. And yet
if she will set her teeth and read the first fifty pages with-
out skipping she will discover that she is being let into real
secrets of real human hearts; that handsome Itachel (penni-
less companion to a benign old lady), and her debonair
Louis (who somehow never can run straight where money
is concerned), are becoming known to her as she knows few,
if any, of her friends; and that, because known, they are
extraordinarily interesting. She will see Rachel drawn out
of the haven of her staunch and critical common sense by
her infatuation for Louis; threatened by the shipwreck of
despair when she realises his weakness and her irrevo-
cable mistake, and again putting into a new harbour of
determination to pay the price of her love and make the
best of things. And I should not be altogether surprised
if even our romantic library-subscriber finds the next live-
happily-ever-after story a little flat by comparison. For
there is no doubt that Mr. BENNETT has some uncanny
Power of realising the conflict of human souls, and that
there is an astonishingly adroit method in his mania for
unimportant and unromantic detail. I refuse altogether to
adventures of the banknotes on the night of their disappear-
ance, but I am grateful for every word and incident of this
enchanting chronicle and for the portrait of Rachel in
particular, -
Modern Pig-Sticking (MACMILLAN) is a book that, appear-
ing at this particular moment, has an air of detachment
not without its own charm. Chiefly, of course, it appeals
to a special and limited public—a public, moreover, that is
at present too busy to give it the attention that it would
otherwise command. Certainly Major A. E. WARDROP's
spirited pages deserve to rank with the best that has been
written about this sport. As one frankly ignorant, I was
myself astonished to find how considerable a body is this
literature. As for the gallant Major's own contribution, it
is sufficiently well-written to make tales of sporting feats
and adventures interesting to the outsider. Which is saying
a lot. At the same time his sense of humour is sufficiently
strong to save enthusiasm from becoming oppressive,
Certainly he loves his theme, as I suppose a good pig-sticker
should. “To see hog and hunter charge each other bald-
headed with a simultaneous squeal of rage is,” he says
youthfully, “always delightful.” It is all, in these more
strenuous times, most refreshing and even a little wistful
in its naïveté. The honest and brave gentlemen whose
exploits it records are about another kind of pig-sticking
now. One hopes that practice with the Indian variety
may help them in their chase of the Uhlan road-bog.

For all his good humour, Mr. PETT RIDGE can say a force of character. Having been told by a Socialist shoe-

humourist, but thoroughly enjoy hearing them. Certainly
it is not Mr. RIDGE's plots which so attract everybody,
including myself. The Happy Iłecruit (METHUEN) might
as well (or even better) have been plotless. There is the
central figure, Carl Siemens, who comes to England from
abroad in his youth and has an I-
unremarkable career, and there is
a mysterious and rather tiresome
trunk which is mentioned from
time to time and finally opened;
but apart from these the book is
but a collection of little episodes
more or less about the same people,
the Maynard family in particular.
It is not the story that lends the
charm but the people who come
into it, that upper-lower section
of Londoners whose little peculi-
arities of thought, word and deed
Mr. Ridge so perfectly understands.
Through their mouths he utters
his truest sayings, and they make
his books always worth reading.
It should be added that this one
has nothing to do with present
warfare; it is antedated by a reign
and a half. In this the title is
misleading, for there are so many
recruits about nowadays and all of
them are happy.
After reading Messrs. Hutch-
INSON'S announcement that the
critics describe Mr. F. BANcroft ſº
as the most remarkable South
African novelist now at work, I
searched for a talent that was too
successfully hidden for my finding.
I was on the track of it two or
three times, and once at least the
scent was so hot that I thought
the quarry was mine; but it got
away. . With Dalliance and Strife

a little time considerably puzzled as to how Mrs. BAILLIE
REYNoLDs was going to get on with her tale. However, I
need not have worried. Of course Miles was not dead;
indeed the last six words of the book tell you that “His

naturally he wouldn't have been
been enfolding the heroine in
his strong arms. But before this
happy moment we had a lot to get
through. Miles on recovery had
told the properly apolegetic Ger-
maine that she must never, never
let anybody else know about the
dagger business, and she said she
wouldn't. Personally, if I had
been Germaine, I should have
done the same. Later in life,
reflecting upon this injunction, and
discovering that her grandfather
had also killed a man, Germaine
got it into her head that the habit
was inherited, and the idea worried
her quite dreadfully. This, I sup-
pose, is why her story is called The
Cost of A Promise (HopDER AND
… Stoughton). Eventually, how- ||
ever, when the thing had gone on |
long enough and the revelation of
her secret had scared away a super-

too little fighting. His liberality in the matter of heroines
compensates me not at all for his niggard accounts of the
war. ...That he himself should apparently take more interest
in dalliance than in strife seems to indicate sheer perversity,
for, when once he has ceased to toy with tennis-teas and
trivialities, it is possible to respect the opinions of those
admiring critics even if it is impossible to agree with
them. The little fighting and the few whiffs of the
veldt that we are given come as welcome reliefs to the
rather stuffy atmosphere that Mr. BANcroFT has been
at such pains to create. The British officer in his hours
of dalliance is in his hands merely a figure of ſun, but the
militant Boer in field and camp is a faithful picture, so faith-
ful, indeed, when contrasted with the other, that it leaves

[October 28, 1914,
CANUTE AND THE KAISER.
Our Own Special Conchologist on the Belgian Coast.]
THERE was a King by name CANUTE
(In ancient jargon known as KNUT),
And I, for one, will not dispute
The kingly figure which he cut;
A god in mufti—so his courtiers said—
Whatever thing he chose to have a try at,
He did it (loosely speaking) on his head,
By just remarking, “Fiat 1.”
One day they sat him by the sea
To put his virtue to the test,
And there, without conviction, he
Threw off the following, by request:-
“Ocean,” he said, “I see your waves are wet"
“So to your further progress here I set
A period, or punctum.”
He knew it wasn't any good
Talking like that ; and when the foam
Made for his feet (he knew it would)
He turned at once and made for home;
And “I'm no god, but just a man,” he cried,
“And you, my sycophants, are sorry rotters,
Who told your KNUT that he could dare the tide
To damp his heavenly trotters.”
:: : :k :k :: :: ::: ::
The scene was changed. Another strand ;
Another god (alleged) was there
(In spirit, you must understand;
His actual frame occurred elsewhere);-
“O element designed for German ships,
Whose future lies,” said he, “upon the water,
I strike at England Ho!" and licked his lips
For lust of loot and slaughter.
Then by the sea was answer made,
And down the wind this word was blown :
“Thus far ! but here your steps are stayed;
England is mine; I guard my own "
And as upon his ear this challenge fell,
Out of the deep there also fell upon it, or
Close in the neighbourhood, a singing shell
From H.M. Mersey, Monitor.
And just as old CANUTE (or KNUt)
Stopped not to parley when he found
His line of exit nearly cut,
But moved his feet to drier ground,
So too that other Monarch, much concerned
About his safety, looked no longer foam-ward,
Strategically home-ward. O. S.

DEAR CHARLEs, We're tired of this
place, so we're going to move on.
Some said, “Let's go to Egypt and
doze in the sun.” Others were for
India, and one, having a flame in
Guernsey, proposed that the Division
might just as well go to the Channel
Islands as anywhere else. But what
tempted the majority was the thought
of a season's shooting without having
to pay for so much as a gun licence,
and so we decided for the Continent.
We gave formal notice to the War
Office of our requirements, said we
would let them know in due course
what time we should want trains, ships
and motor omnibuses to start, and
asked them to call for our luggage at
an hour we would name, indicating

because we happen to be so ordered.

one may also, with a little ingenuity, use
one's clothes to serve a double purpose.

these Germans had no doubt thought
of that years and years before and, in
order to deceive us, had built their
churches with the east windows point-

FALSE PRETENCES.
Since the War began the military
experts have monopolised one corner
of the smoke-room. Don't imagine I
am going to write about them. It is
in the other corner of the smoke-room
that the Cheering-Up Association meets.
There we all come and relate our
business troubles and listen to the
troubles of our friends. It is wonderful
how consoling other people's troubles
are. Robinson brightens perceptibly
when he discovers that Jenkins is also
heading for the Bankruptcy Court.
Of course the talk began with
Mitchell's play. It always does. We
have followed with tempered interest
its pilgrimage from one manager to
another these two years.
“All U P," groaned Mitchell. “Al-

I don't know when I shall be in a

Everyone looked sympathetic, and
when Wilson had risen from his seat
and walked towards the door there was
a general murmur of “Poor fellow, it's
hit him very hard.”
Wilson paused at the door and
looked back. “Did I mention,” he
said, “that I owe that sum to Gorman
manufacturers ?”
It was unanimously voted by the
Cheering-Up Association that no club
rule was violated when Mitchell hurled
a match-stand at the member whom
we had been cheering up on false
pretences.

Dear Sir,-I feel very keenly the
suggestion that the Etna is an office of
questionable repute. The likelihood of
fire is small, as unfortunately the pre-
mises are at present standing empty,
though I have a tenant in prospect.
But in any case it is unthinkable that
the Etna could not assemble a thousand
pounds, should the need arise. If you
care to write to me again shortly before
Lady Day with terms no less advan-
tageous than those I now enjoy, I do
not say that I should not be prepared

III.
As our wives remark to each other
nowadays over the knitted helmets,
“It's extraordinary how dark London
is at night.” They then drop two and
purl two, and add, “Particularly as the
evenings are drawing in so.” But
while they prattle of it thus lightly we
(their husbands) are outside in it all,
marching . . . and wheeling . . . and
tripping over each other. At what
risk to ourselves I will show you.
It was Thursday the 22nd, and at
six o'clock our Company might have
been seen (had there been a better
light to see it by) progressing smartly
in column of platoons. The shades of
night were falling fast as over Regent's
Park we passed, and my platoon
was marching last, excelsior. As my
platoon came opposite our Command-
ing Officer he gave the order, “About
turn.” We did so. “Form ſours,
left"—we made it that. The night fell
thicker; I can now speak only for my-
self and my immediate neighbours.
“Right incline”—we inclined rightly.
Another “Right incline” and a “Halt,”
and then the C.O. came up to look for
us. My platoon had got together some-
how, and murmurs came to us from the
platoons behind us...You know how
quickly a rumour will run through a
company. Such a rumour now ran
through ours. It went from man to
man; it came to me at last ; it went
on . . . it got to our Commander.
“No. 1 platoon missing !”
The C.O. came up to us, struck a
match and counted us. Only three
platoons—we were a platoon short.
The rumour was true!
We never saw that platoon again.
Its story, as we piece it together from
the tales of park-keepers, policemen
and other non - combatants, is as
follows. It failed to hear the order
“About-turn” and marched straight
forward. In the Regular Army a com-
bination of obedience with initiative is
taught the recruit; we are still at the
implicit obedience stage. No. 1 platoon
had its orders. It came to some railings
three hundred yards further on and
climbed over. At the Ornamental Lake
it took to the water. The survivors
continued the march south. They were
seen for a moment at the Marble Arch,
and then again at Epsom. Nothing
more is known definitely; but a speci-
men of the Corps badge has been found
on the beach at New Shoreham, and
it is supposed. . . . Well, well—we
shall miss them. -
These, then, are some of the dangers
which we who drill in the evenings face

in the early mornings. I have been
told the hour at which they fall in, and
I tried at once to forget it. I am in

hero who comes up thirty miles from
the country to attend. In order to be
there punctually he has to get up
three days beforehand each morning,
and have his breakfast over-night; but
he does it . . . And I think the
Germans ought to know.
However, he and all of us had our
reward last Saturday, when we marched
down to camp five hundred strong. It
was not so much the remarks of the
spectators (many of whom foolishly
mistook us for Belgian refugees) which
flattered us, as the respectful way in
which the police held up the traffic to
let us pass. Five hundred men take
some time passing; to delay for that
time the taxi of some impatient War
Office official, bulging with critical
despatches, gave one an importance
never to be acquired in civil life. For
a mere editor not even a tricycle would
be held up.
As I have said, our exact status in
the military world was misapprehended
by the spectator. It so happened that
our more elderly members were on
the left or pavement side, and it was
from the pavement side that I heard
the remark (evidently from one who
felt that his relief-fund subscription
had not really been wanted), “Well,
they don't look 'ungry.” Others on
this side surmised that we were sus-
pected waiters rounded up from the
different restaurants, and made humor-
ous complaints to us in our late capa-
cities—as that their ice-pudding had
been fried too long. But on the road
side we did better. Dear ladies, observ-
ing only the flower of the Corps (myself
and others), took us for the real thing
and called down blessings and kisses
upon our heads; and for a time we
even deceived a small boy who had
been watching us eagerly. But only
for a time. “Lumme,” he said aloud
to himself, “there's anuvver of 'em
wiv knock-knees,” and disillusionment
cannot have been long delayed.
It may be admitted that some of
the more active ones feel it a little
that , they have to carry the more
elderly ones with them. A sugges-
tion has been made that there should
be an age-limit of eighty-five, but
I don't know if it will come to
anything. Another suggestion is that
a special Veterans' Wing should be
formed, which, instead of marching,
would go out at the week-ends with a
couple of cement-hounds, and look for
cement foundations. It is felt that the

But there is, I know, one
It is in the same spirit that
we discuss what will be done with the
Corps as a whole when the Germans
arrive. The pessimistic view is that ||
we shall be immediately interned by |
the War Office, to keep us out of
trouble. Others, more hopeful, think ||
that we might be kept for “exchanges," |
in case the enemy make any notable ||
captures. For instance, five of us might
be considered the equivalent of an
artillery mule; a platoon would balance ||
a Territorial subaltern; and the whole
bunch could be offered for (say) the
return of the Albert Memorial. But ||
the most popular impression is that we
shall be asked to give some sort of dis-
play in the centre, in order to lure the
Germans on. And while we are forming
fours strongly and persistently in Iro...
of them . . . the real attack (Regulars
and Territorials—with rifles) . . . will

up their time to teach us, and do not
seem to think that that time will be

Whereof the motley bard may say no more.

And know that this is truth and that is not.

That sect and rubric seem to fade away,

That have not glimpsed the prospect of the day.

Such gospel as ye bear to savage kings,

They have no need of ritual on the Rhine.

Where knowledge shall be taught to Teuton men
That mumbo-jumbo is an out-worn rule,
Be built at Heidelberg or Göttingen.
There shall the Wandal sages come and go,
And learn at last why Belgium felt chagrin,
And pace the Prussian goose-step very slow,
From class to class, with lots of halts between.

To starrier heights that now the negroes win;
Meanwhile your common goal is clearly set

wishing to send a message to the
American people, wrote to an American
journalist, also, as it chanced, named
Grayson, and also a resident in the other

[October 28, 1914,
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE KHAK! MUFFLER.
The blinds were drawn, the lamps were lit and the fire
was burning brightly. I was reading an evening paper—
we get the 5.30 edition at the moment of publication,
though we are thirty miles from London—and I had just
found Prezymyzle (my own pronunciation) on the map for
the thousandth time. Helen says that quite in the early
days of the war she was told it ought to be pronounced
Perimeeshy, but that seems impossible. Rosie declares for
Prozmeel. Still she isn't very confident about it. One
thing seems certain: when the Russians take this jaw-
cracking town they will pronounce it quite differently i.
the Austrian form, whatever that may be. Just think of
what happened to Lemberg. There appeared to be a kind
of finality about that, but no sooner were the Russians in
it than it turned into Lwow. After that anything might
happen to Przemysl.
However, there were the three of us sitting in the library.
I was helping the common cause with the evening paper
and the map, and Helen and Rosie were knitting away like
mad at khaki mufflers for Lady FRENch. Click-click went
the needles; the youthful fingers moved with incredible
deftness and celerity, and line after line was added by each
executant to her already enormous pile. There had been
a long silence, and the time for breaking it seemed to
have come. -
“Well done, both of you,” I said. “You really are
getting on to-day. A week ago I thought you'd never get
finished, and now I waved my hand encouragingly
at the two heaps of wool-work.
“There,” said Helen, “you've made me drop one.”
“Pick it up again,” I said with enthusiasm. “What
were girls made for if not to pick up dropped stitches?
But tell me,” I added, “what would happen if you didn't
pick it up 2"
“My soldier,” said Helen gloomily, “would go into the
trenches and, instead of having a muffler, he would suddenly
find himself coming undone all over him. Do you think he
would like that ?” - - -
“No,” I said, “he wouldn't. No soldier could possibly
like a thing of that sort when he's got to fight Germans.”
“I wonder,” put in Rosie, “what my soldier will be
like. I think I should like him to have a moustache—yes,

“He’ll have a moustache all right,” said Helen, who is
practical rather than dreamy. “And he'll have whiskers,
too, and a beard as long as your arm. Do you think
people have time to shave when they're in trenches?”
“Well, anyhow,” said Rosie, “both our soldiers will be
very brave men.” -
“That,” said Helen, “is quite certain. Let's put in
some good hard stitches to thank them for their bravery.”
There was a short silence while this operation was
performed with great zeal. The fingers flew through their
complicated task and the web seemed to grow visibly.

“Come,” I said, “I won't compete with you in knitting,

“All right,” said Helen, “we’ll bet a penny. Only

the other he swam strongly towards
the only floating object in view.
As they drew near he perceived that
it was a large ship's ventilator. It was
sinking fast, and from its mouth pro-
truded the heads of two men engaged
in a life-and-death struggle. They
were Capperton and Blütherski.
With a cry of encouragement Car-
michael redoubled his efforts.
CHAPTER VIII.
A ship's lifeboat, propelled by strong
and willing arms, travelled swiftly across
the sea. Presently a shout went up
from the man in the bow. Four figures
were seen struggling frantically in the
water, and the rowers bent themselves
with renewed energy to their oars.

On board the liner which had been

Capperton and Carmichael, each with
a loaded revolver.
At length the cumbrous helmet was
lifted off and the face of the diver was
revealed.
It was Madge!
CHAPTER XIV.
The motor-boat drew up beside the
quay and the Foreign Secretary stepped
out with the detective and his daughter.
All were plainly in a joyous mood, and
they smiled happily at each other.
So gratified were they at their success
that they quite failed to observe three
men, who crept up stealthily behind
them and thrust pads soaked in chloro-
form over their mouths.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Coasting Bohemia is the attractive title of a series of
essays upon men and matters by Mr. CoMyNs CARR,
issued in a portly volume published by MACMILLAN.
During the last forty years Mr. CARR, eminently a club-
able man, has made the acquaintance and enjoyed the
friendship of a galaxy of painters, authors and actors.
He was equally at home with MILLAis, ALMA-TADEMA,
RossETT1, BURNE-Jones, WHISTLER, GEORGE MEREDITH,
HENRY IRVING and ARTHUR SULLIVAN. A shrewd observer,
quick in sympathy, apt in characterisation, he has much |
that is interesting and informing to say of each. Perhaps
the chapter on WHISTLER is the most attractive, since in
some respects his individuality was the most pronounced.
In a couple of brief sentences, pleasing in the slyness of their
gentle malice, Mr. CARR hits off a striking quality in the
tharacter of the WHISTLER we most of us knew. “At times,”
he writes, “Whistler was even greedy of applause, and,
º it was full and emphatic enough, showed no
nclination to question its source or authority. There were
moments indeed when, if it appeared to lack volume or
vehemence, he was ready himself to supply what was
deficient.” Mr. CARR has in his time played many parts.
He made a start at the Bar, but did not get further than
the position of a Junior, which suited him admirably.
As a critic, he cannot plead in extenuation the dictum
of DISRAELI that critics are those who have failed in
Literature and Art. He has written several successful
plays, was English editor of L'Art, was among the
founders of the New Gallery, and remains established

TO A FALSE PATRIOT.
HE came obedient to the Call;
He might have shirked like half his mates
Who, while their comrades fight and fall,
Still go to swell the football gates.
And you, a patriot in your prime,
You waved a flag above his head,
And hoped he'd have a high old time,
And slapped him on the back and said:
“You’ll show 'em what we British are
Give us your hand, old pal, to shake; ”
And took him round from bar to bar
And made him drunk—for England's sake.
That's how you helped him. Yesterday,
Clear-eyed and earnest, keen and hard,
He held himself the soldier's way—
And now they've got him under guard.
That doesn't hurt you; you're all right;
Your easy conscience takes no blame :
But he, poor boy, with morning's light,
He eats his heart out, sick with shame.
What's that to you? You understand
Nothing of all his bitter pain;
You have no regiment to brand;
You have no uniform to stain;
No vow of service to abuse,
No pledge to KING and country due;
But he had something dear to lose,
And he has lost it—thanks to you. O. S.
UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.

(From Professor HERMANN MüLLER, Ph.D., Private in the
—th Regiment of Prussian Infantry.)
Belgium.
You R MAJESTY, I am one of your Majesty's most loyal
and most faithfully devoted subjects, and, if I now write to
you, it is not because I doubt for one moment that you are
inspired in all your actions by a clearer wisdom and a
firmer grasp of facts than any that I can pretend to, but
because there are certain questions which obstinately press
upon me to such an extent that I must relieve my mind
of them. -
At the beginning I was a firm believer in the necessity
of this war, and in the perfect and not-to-be-shattered
#. of our cause. I had read all that there was to read:
REITsch RE, NIETzsche, BERNHARDI, FRob EN1Us and a
hundred others, from whose writings it can be most easily
shown that Germany alone among nations has the power
and the will to expand and to rule; that expansion and
rule must be accomplished by war, which, far from being a
misſortune, is a noble object to be aimed at and not avoided
by statesmen; that all other nations are degenerate and
must for their own good be crushed by Germany; and that
any nation which resists Germany is through that very act
an enemy of the human race. I also believed that German
culture is something different from and superior to such
culture (if it be worthy of the name) as is possessed by
other countries. All these belieſs I set out in my booklet
entitled, “Der Lorbeerkranz,” which I humbly and with the
and glorious Majesty. Did you, I wonder, deign to cast
your Imperial eyes on this effort of my pen? How well I
remember obtaining my first copy of the book on the happy
day that saw its publication. It seemed printed in letters
of gold, and, filled with high yearnings and expectations, I
took it home to my beloved Anna. We read it aloud
together, turn and turn about, with laughter and applause
and tears, for we saw therein the foundation of ſame.
So, at the war's beginning, I slrouted with the rest for
my KAISER and my country, knowing that the war was
just and that we should end by annexing England's
colonies, aſter destroying her armies and her ships, and
those of France and Russia into the bargain.
Well, that is already, as it seems to me, a thousand years
ago, and I must admit that at that time I did not consider
it possible that I myself with all my weight of learning as
well as my regulation knapsack should be marching about,
or lying in a trench on the plains of Flanders, divided by
a few hundred yards from English soldiers, who have in
their hands rifles and bayonets, and know how to use them.
In the intervals of firing, as we lie there, a man has time
to think, and it is wonderful how clear his ideas become in
such conditions. Some of us do not think or think only
what they are told. Poor simple fellows, they still believe
they are even now at the gates of Paris, and that to-morrow
is the day appointed for the entrance; whereas I know
that, having been close to Paris in a mad rush, our armies
have since letreated day after day. - -
But all this happened before I myself had to join the
fight with the older men. Now I know that the English
and the French have much to say for themselves, and, in
any case, that it is plain nonsense—I beg Your Majesty's
pardon for using this word, but it is there and I will not
strike it out—it is plain nonsense to believe that the gºod
God who has made us all has had any interest in making
our Germans out of better clay than that which He has
used for other men. I cannot even make an exception "
the case of your Imperial Majesty's own self. Thus doº
thoughts run in the trenches during this dreadful battle.
What things have I heard, what awful sights have I sº

“Had him twelve year or more ago,”
said the landlord. “DE WET's off.”
A fierce controversy now ensued be-
tween partisans of the KAISER and the
CrowN PRINCE. Prodgers argued ably
that it was much worse to destroy a
cathedral than to steal plate; whilst
Unwin, the jobbing builder, declared
that the damaging of a cathedral gave
work to a very deserving class of men,
and said he would very much rather
see the parish church-tower knocked
down than the Vicar's spoons stolen.
At last feeling ran so high it was de-
cided to put the matter to the vote.
Five voted for the light-headed KAISER,
five for his light-fingered heir. All
eyes turned on the landlord to see
which way his casting vote would go.
“Friends all,” said Mr. Flodden, |

“No, father" replied William, look-

“That, William, is scarcely a game.

“By the way, Lorna was there this

the brown paper and string, which
always seems to me the most tricky

relations, while Beryl or I’velyn or
Lorna looks up from the parcel she is
kneeling on and interrupts, “Well, my
brother heard -- I say, where did
you put my seissors?” -
“Well,” Smiled Celia, “Lorna's
brother in the War Office says the war
will be over by Christmas.”
“Hooray,” I said; and I went out
and looked at my cigar.
This cigar arrived at my house in a
case of samples last July. The samples
went up from right to left in order of
importance, each in his own little bed
—until you got to Torpedo Jimmy at
the end, who had a double bed to
himself. Starting with Cabajo fino
in the right-hand corner, the prices
ranged from about nine a penny to
five pounds apiece, the latter being
the approximate charge for T. James
or any of his brethren.
Celia was looking over my shoulder
when I opened the case, and she sur-
veyed my brown friends with interest.
“When are you going to smoke that
one?” she askcd, touching Torpedo
Jimmy's cummerbund with the tip of
her finger.
“On your birthday,” I said.
“13other, then I shan’t see much of
you. Couldn't you smoke it on two
ordinary days instead 2"
“You can only smoke a cigar that size
after a very good dinner,” I explained.
“What was the matter with the
tapioca pudding last night 2." said
Celia sternly.
Liverpool, you may be sure that Celia

that sort of thing. You can't do that
at home. Besides, I shall want a
waiter or two to hold the far end of
it while I’m smoking. It'll be all
right going there; we can put it on
the top of a cab.”
“Of course it will be lovely going
out with you,” said Celia, “but Jane
will be very disappointed. She'd have
likel to hear it buzzing.”
“I hope it won't buzz,” I said.
“Couldn't you smoke it now, and
then we'd go out next week and
celebrate your recovery.” She sighed.
“My birthday's a long way off,” she
and the lights and the pretty people
in the distance—and not necessarily in
i the distance either.
“Well, p'raps we'll think of another
excuse. Anyhow it will be a very great
day, and if I survive we shall often
look back upon it.”
Celia stroked it again.
“It’s just like a torpedo, isn't it?”
she said. And so we called it Torpedo
Jimmy. A torpedo is actually a little
bit bigger. Not much, however.
That was July. When August came
we knew that thero would be no excuse
before the birthday and that the birth-
day would be no excuse. The great
dinner was postponed. It didn't matter,
because we forgot about the great
dinner.
But towards the end of September
Celia came across the sample case again.
All the beds were empty now but one.
Torpedo James still lay in his four-
poster, brown and inscrutable.
“Better put him away,” she said,
“and on the day that peace is signed
you can take us both out.”
And so Torpedo Jimmy became a
symbol. The more I long for peace,
the more I long for that historic smoke.
When Louisa's brother or Nora's uncle
has a long pessimistic talk with
Kitch ENER, then I look sadly at my
cigar; but when FRENch and JoFFRE

cousin and give him words of cheer,
then I take it out and pinch it fondly,
and already I see the waiter coming
round with a torch to light it.
I have been looking at it to-day, and
I see that it is giving a little at one
end. I fancy that the moth has been
getting at it. Well, if it does not last
till peace is signed, it will be a peace

on my battery was so great that we were forced
to take cover. I sat crouched in my 'funk-

had Jacobs's ‘Sea Urchins’ with me, which

Mr. Punch, while remarking that he
is not surprised that the shells screamed
in the circumstances, begs to assure
his readers that, if the following infor-
mation corresponds with the facts, Mr.
JAcobs is not the only author who has
been solacing our troops in the trenches.
Miss Carrie Morelli writes: “There
has so far been no public mention of
any books of mine being read in the
trenches and affording solace to our
gallant troops. This, however, is be-
cause all the reports from the Front
come from men, and men are notori-
ously jealous of feminine activity in
literature as elsewhere. I have no
doubt in my own mind that many, a
soldier in action has been cheered by
hurried glances at my novels, a list
of which can be forwarded on appli-

Man states that the writer, who rightly
wishes to remain anonymous, possesses
a copy of a novel of astonishing genius,
in which a German bullet is embedded.
This book, it seems, was the insepa-
rable companion of a soldier in the
3rd Manx Highlanders, who carried it
always next his heart, and in its posi-
tion in that intimate and honoured spot
it saved his life. The writer, who con-
ſesses to being the author of the novel
in question, states that he would
divulge both his own name and
that of the title of the book but that

during the great effort of the Germans
to break through the left flank of the
Allies, General voN KLUCR absolutely
refused to see or consult with his Staff

with results which have vitally affected
the progress of the campaign.
Mr. ARNoLD BENNETT has just re-

British marine who was recently landed

describes how, as he was reading one

WE seek information of the present
whereabouts of Prince — of -
Some few weeks ago the news came
that he was carried wounded into a
Brussels hospital, with a velvet mask
over his face, so that none might
recognise him. The PRINCE was visited
in hospital by a tall man, also heavily
masked, but not so heavily as to con-
ceal apair of soaring moustaches, freshly
waxed. None dared speculate as to
Who this Visitor might be. The hush
was tremendous. The Visitor silently
pinned on the patient a specimen of
the Iron Cross and as silently left.
It was the 37000th Iron Cross be-
stowed since the outbreak of war.
At the autopsy it was proved conclu-
sively that the bullet inside the PRINCE
was of German origin.
After the post-mortem the PRINCE
was luckily captured by the Belgians,
and held at Antwerp as hostage for the
good behaviour of the German troops
occupying Brussels.
When the fall of Antwerp became
imminent the PRINCE was secretly re-
moved to England. A fortnight ago he
was seen in a motor-car driving round
Battersea Park, accompanied and
guarded by an English officer.
The PRINCE wore his saxe-blue full-

after; he wanted my pennies; so I just
ambled off, and very soon outdistanced
him. An Airedale, I suppose, would
have held him till the police arrived,
but I'm a Collie. -
That very same afternoon, wandering
about the station, l chanced to saunter
into the ticket-office. The clerk's a
man with a very well-regulated mind.
He gives me chocolate. Just then,
however, he was out, but his three-
year-old boy-puppy was there sitting
on a table all covered with bits of card-
board and little piles of pennies,
ordinary brown ones, big white ones
and a few little yellow ones. Well, in
less time than it takes to cock your
ears, that baby was shovelling pennies
through the slit in my box and chuck-
ling with joy. I stood it as long as I
could, and then, in the nick of time,
snatched a big white penny out of his
paw and bolted off to the confectioner's.
Imagine my astonishment when the
girl actually refused to serve me! “Oh,

mistake; I know your mistress wouldn't
give you a two-shilling piece."

HERBERT.
“I HAVEN'T introduced Herbert to
you yet, have I?" -
Stella-my-niece spoke with her eyes
on the matinée hat before her, and con-
cluded, d propos of the hat, though at
first I feared of Heibert—“I do hope
and pray that it will come off. Hip !
Hipſ She's pulling out pins."
“I had noidea there was—a Herbert.”
“Oh, Nunckle ! and you're responsi-
ble for the fact that he's mine at all !”
“I responsible 2"
“Well, but for you I never might
have seen him even ; and I'm sure
there isn't another like Herbert in the
whole round world. Everyone wants
him."
Presently I enquired when she pro-
posed to introduce this paragon to the
“I've got him here to-day.”
I looked at her in pained silence, for
Stella-my-niece, calmly fishing for
“hard ones" in a chocolate box, was,
as it were, sheltered under the lee of a |
long-haired gentleman who occupied
rather more than double half-a-crown's
worth of red velvet seat.
“There?" I whispered, pointing to
the long-haired gentleman who neigh-
boured her, and wondering what her
mother would have to say about it all.
Stella-my-niece smiled.
“Do you imagine that I should bring
Herbert into the pit 2"
“Point him out to me." - - -
“I can't. Now they're going to
begin I" She snuggled down into her
place and invited me to do likewise in
my own as the curtain rose and revealed
the legs of one of our leading actor-
managers, and the audience clapped,
hoping for more. “Now we're going
to enjoy ourselves | Don't forget to
hold my hand if anything pops.” -
Stella-my-niece has made it a stern
rule that we are not to talk during the
Acts, contriving to telegraph her ap-
preciation of most things by fervent
clutches at my arm; but to-day the
effects of this salutary regulation were
spoilt for me by Helbert. My attention
wandered. -
“Is he an actor?" I asked sternly,
as the lights leaped up again.
“Which do you mean? I think they
were all perfect darlings in that scene.”
“Why, Herbert, of course.”
“HERBERT — Sir HERBERT 2. He
isn't in this, is he? I didn't see anyone
looking as bored as he does. Hunt him
up in the programme—it's down there
under your boots.”
“I didn't mean TREE, I meant Her-
bert–your Herbert." * † :
“My Herbert 2" Stella-my-niece
opened her mouth showing astonish-
ment and very pretty teeth.
“Yes, your Herbert. He's an actor
fellow, isn't he 2" :
“No, he's an umbrella—my new
umbrella. I bought him with the
sovereign you sent me for my birthday,
and he is such a darling I felt he
ought to have a name of his own, so I
called him Herbert. He looks like
that." -
“A girl's name—Maud, for instance,
only one doesn't use them in the garden
much--"
“A girl's name, like Pauline, may suit
your fountain pen, and Dad may call
the motor “Mary Jane' when he's
pleased with how he's mended her;
but I decided I would have a man's. It
sounds better to say, ‘Herbert is seeing
me home, thank you.' . The sad thing
is that I'm sure I shan't keep him long;
|
me in umbrella-stands I feel nervous,
and in trains. He's so unique—so
utterly unlike anyone else's umbrella.
I know you'll love him.”
I did as soon as ever I saw him
coming out of the cloak-room hanging
on her arm. There was a gentle coy-
ness in the turn of Herbert's handle, a
nutty daintiness about his little gold
tie which made me look involuntarily
for his socks.
“Now, you wait and see if someone
doesn't try to run off with him before
we get home,” said Stella-my-niece.
“I’ll hold him on a long lead so that
people will think he's out by himself,
and we'll await developments.”
We settled ourselves by tact and
firmness in a crowded après matinée
'bus, and Stella-my-niece, having set
down all her belongings the better to
persuade the programme to ride inside
her pocket, took Herbert by his long
tassels, leaving him leaning against
the seat between herself and her neigh-
bour, a lady with many trimmings and
a book.
“I hope she'll go before we do,"
said Stella-my-niece in my ear. “l
sort of feel that she'll try to take
Herbert.”
She did; as she read, her hand
reached out and took a grip upon
Herbert's immaculate head | Stella-my-
niece stifled a squeak of pure excitement.
“Oxford Street,” announced the con-
ductor dispassionately, and the trimmed
lady shut her book and rose to get out.
Stella-my-niece, holding Herbert by his
tassels, smiled indulgently.
“You have my umbrella, I'm afraid,"
she said sweetly. “It is such a very
uncommon one that I simply couldn't
be mistaken.”
The trimmed lady looked round; so
did everyone in the 'bus. Then she
pointed to a slim object propped against
the seat between Stella-my-niece's blue
skirt and my own striped garments.
“That's yours by the gentleman;
they're just the same pattern."
So they were !
::: ::: :: ::
As Stella-my-niece said afterwards at

TO THE SHIRKER: A LAST APPEAL.
Now of your free choice, while the chance is yours
To share their glory who have gladly died
Shielding the honour of our island shores
And that fair heritage of starry pride,-
Now, ere another evening's shadow falls,
Come, for the trumpet calls.
What if to-morrow through the land there runs
This message for an everlasting stain 2–
“England expected each of all her sons
To do his duty—but she looked in vain;
Now she demands, by order sharp and swift,
What should have been a gift.”
For so it must be, if her manhood fail
To stand by England in her deadly need;
lf still her wounds are but an idle tale
The word must issue which shall make you heed;
And they who left her passionate pleas unheard
Will have to hear that word.
And, losing your free choice, you also lose

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. VII.
(From the PRESIDENT of THE FRENch REPUBLIc)
Bordeaua.
SIRE,-You will pardon me, I know, if for a moment I
break in upon the serious occupations and meditations in
which your time must be spent. I like to picture you to
myself in the midst of your Staff, working out for them and
your armies great problems of strategy and devising those
movements which, so far, have overwhelmed not your foes
so much as the minds of your fellow-countrymen. You
too, Sire, sanguine and impetuous as is your nature, are no
doubt beginning to realise that a great nation—let us say
France, for example — is not to be overcome by mere
shouting and the waving of sabres, or by the making of
impassioned speeches in which God, having been acclaimed
as an ally, is encouraged to perform miracles for the benefit
of the Prussian arms. I do not deny that your soldiers
are brave and that your armies are well equipped; but our
Frenchmen too have guns and bayonets and swords and
shells and know how to make use of them, and their
portion of courage is no smaller than that of the Prussians,
or even of the Bavarians whom you have lately been
vaunting. Moreover—and this you had perhaps over-
looked—they have something which is deadlier and more
enduring than shot and shell and steel—the unconquerable
spirit which leaps up in the hearts of men who are gathered
to defend their country from invasion and their national
existence from destruction.
Oh, Sire, how little you have understood France and her
people; how little you have understood the minds and
“France,” your Professors and your
motives of men!
Generals told you, “is degenerate; her population is smaller
than ours; she has lost her skill in fighting and her courage;
she has no culture, never having heard of TREITschkE and
having neglected the inspired writings of NIEtzschE; she
will be an easy prey, for no one will liſt a hand to help her.
England is lapped in ease behind her ocean and will never
fight again; Russia is distant and slow, and we can despise
her; Belgium will never dare to deny us anything we care
to ask. Let us make haste, then, and crush France to the
earth for ever." So you planned, and your legions set out
to trample us down, with the result that is now before the
eyes of the world.
Only a few words more. There is at Sampigny, in
Lorraine, a modest country-house, which was, in fact, my
home. Your troops passed through the place, and for no
military reason that 1 can discover they reduced this house
to ruins. I know that that is a small price to pay for the
honour of being allowed to represent the French nation in
this hour of peril and glory, and I pay it willingly. When
so many are laying down their lives with joy why should I
complain because a few walls have been shattered? But I
am reminded and I wish to remind you of another story.
One hundred and eight years ago, in October, the Great
NAPOLEON, having scattered your predecessor's armies to the
four winds of heaven, proceeded to Potsdam, where he
visited the tomb of the great FREDERICK. They showed him
the dead King's sword, his belt and his cordon of the Black
Eagle. These Napoleon took, with the intention of sending
them to Paris, to be presented to the Invalides, amongst
whom there still lingered a few who had been defeated by
FREDERick at Rosbach. Certainly the relics took no shame
from such a seizure and such a guardianship. But the
palace at Potsdam was not destroyed and stands to this
day. I do not wish to liken myself to FREDERICR, nor do I
compare you with NAPOLEoN, but I tell you the story, which
is true, for what it is worth. I wonder if you will appre-

The cross is now hung on the breast of the thief.
“Amended and more stringent regulations concerning the lights
of London have been issued by Sir E. R. Henry, the Commissioner
of Police. A number of them are in the same terms as those which
were published in The Globe nearly a month ago, but others make
important changes. For example, the third order, as originally
drafted, ran : ‘The intensity of the inside lighting of shop fronts
must be reduced from 6 p.m. or earlier if the Commissioner of Police
on any occasion so directs,” but it is now as follows:–

that you have to force their
jaws open with a penholder;
also ferrets exhibit a marked
preference for thumbs. All this
information Tommy conveyed
without drawing a breath. The
Headmaster said, “Quite so, my
boy, quite so. But don't you
know it is extremely reprehen-
sible conduct to bring animals
to school in your pocket?”
Well, you see, that is how
Tommy's mother talks to him,
so he knew what to do, and, looking
up into the Head-master's face with
that wistful look of his, he imparted
the deep secret that he had a tortoise.
Tortoises, the Headmaster learnt,
had a way of getting lost among the
cabbages, but, if you wanted to prevent
them from straying, all you had to do
was to turn them over on their backs
and put a piece of brown paper over them
for their feet to play with. Also they
also it never crawled out of your
pocket.
Tommy apologised to Miss Price
for bringing the white rats to school
–they weren't white rats really, not
to look at ; they were rather piebald
So Tommy was reported to the through constant association with ink.

showed her his knife, and especially
that instrument in it which was used
for removing stones from horses' hoofs.

Tommy had tried. A boy had told
Tommy that tortoises laid eggs, but
although Tommy had showed his tor-
toise a hen's egg and then put the
tortoise in a nice new nest the tortoise
had taken no step in the matter.
However, Tommy promised never to
bring any more animals to school and
With ninepence in his pocket Tommy
felt uneasy. It was a question between
a lop eared rabbit and a mouth-organ.
A lop-eared labbit, that is to say a
proper one, cost two shillings; for nine-
pence it was probable that you could
only get a rabbit which would lop with
One ear.
It was a splendid instrument!
Tommy took it to bed with him and
put it under his pillow, and when his
mother came to see that he was all right
at night his hand was clutched round
it as he slept—content.
The next day Tommy gave an organ
recital in the playground before a
large and enthusiastic audience. For
a marble he would let you blow it
while he held it. For two marbles you
could hold it yourself.
One boy paid the two mar-
bles, and noticed the words
“Made in Germany ” in small
letters on the under side. The
silence that followed the an-
nouncement of this discovery
was broken only by the sound
of Jones minor biting an apple.
All eyes were on Tommy Brown.
For the fraction of a second he
hesitated, and in that fraction
13rook tertius giggled.
Tommy seized the mouth-
organ with a determination that
was almost ferocious; he threw
it on the ground, stamped on
it with his heel again and
again, and finally took and
pitched it into a neighbouring
garden. He then fell upon
Brook tertius and punched him
until he howled.
Before Tommy Brown could
go to sleep that night his
mother had to sit by his bed-
side and hold his hand; he
never released her hand until
he was fast asleep. How like
his father (the V.C.) he looked!
She wondered what made him
toss so in his sleep and what had
become of his mouth-organ with the
bell on it.

depths of its deepest inkpot last week to a few correspondents in New York.

in New York.
The sensation was innocence, gently breathed his question,
caused not so much by the announce- when the great statesman shook his
ment that Mr. BRYAN “has the long shaggy mane and roared out his rebuke
mouth of the orator, the lips swelling
and protruding as he speaks, thinning
and compressing when he is silent,” or
that “the full and heavy neck, which
seems to be part of the face, is corded
with muscles,” although either of those
statements is startling enough. Nor
was it Mr. BEGBIE's struggle to decide
whether he should devote his attention
to the great statesman or to the rail-
way-station in which they met, the
statesman being selected only just in
time. No, what nearly stopped the
clock of St. Bride's church was this
paragraph in Mr. BEGBIE's record of
the event: “At this point I asked quite
innocently, and with a real desire for
information, an obvious but indiscreet
question, which Mr. BRYAN rebuked me
for asking, reminding me that he was
a member of the Government.”

apologetic gesture was one of the most
delicate things I have ever seen.”
Another tells us : — “When Mr.
BEGBIE put his question so great a still-
ness reigned throughout the crowded
railway station that you could have
heard a goods-train shunt. Mr. BRYAN
looked long and earnestly at the jour-

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
WAR GossIP.
Park Lane,
DEAREST DAPHNE,--The situation
here is unchanged, though we have
made some progress in knitting. For-
give me, m'amue, but one does get so
much into the despatch habit! The
other day I’d a letter ſrom Babs, in
which she told me she'd “nothing
fresh to report on her right wing”
before she pulled herself together.
Norty's at the front as a flying-man.
He's finding out all sorts of things,
dropping bombs on Zeppelins and
covering himself with glory. I had a
few lines from him last week. He
dated from “A place in Europe” (they
have to be enormously cautious !), and
said he was having the time of his life.
He was immensely pleased with the
last letter I managed to get through to
him, and was particularly struck, he
says, with my advice to him: “Find out
all you can, and above all don't get
caught;" he considers it simply invalu-
able advice and says all airmen ought
to have it written up in letters of gold
somewhere or other.
Stella Clackmannan's had a fort-
night's training as a nurse and is off.
I ran in to see the dear thing the night
before she left. She'd been posing to
a photographer in her Red Cross uni-
form for hours and hours and was al-
most in a state of collapse; but the
heroic darling said she was ready to do
even more than that for her country.
In one photo she's sitting by a cot
with her hands folded, looking sad but
very sweet. In another she's standing
up, singing, “It's a long way to Tip-
perary;” and in a third she's bandag-
ing someone (she had one of the foot-
men in for this photo), and, ſi mon avis,
it's the least successful of all. She
appears to be choking the poor man!
However, they're immensely charming,
and will all be seen in the “Aristocratic
Angels of Mercy" page of next week's
People of Position.
Dear Professor Dimsdale has only just
got back to England from his eclipse
expedition. I'm not sure now whether
it was an eclipse or an occultation, but
anyhow the only place where it could
be properly seen was a mountain in
the Austrian Tyrol. It was due in the
middle of August, and the last week in
July the Professor set off with his big
telescope and his lenses and his assist-
ants and his note-books and every-
thing that was his. He lived a week
or two on the mountain, to get used
to the atmosphere and prepare all his
things, so he didn't know what was
going on in the world below. And then,
began, and the Piofessor was looking
up at the sky for all he was worth,
a lot of fearful creatures came rushing
up the mountain and said there was
a war and that he was an alien enemy
and that he was making signals and
that his big telescope was a new sort of
howitzer; and they pushed him down
the mountain, and broke his telescope
and all his lenses, and tore up his note-
books, and shook their fists at him and
used such language that he said for the
first time in his life he was sorry he
was such a good linguist
They finished by shutting him up in
a fortress, and there he's been ever
since. He hardly knows how it was
he got away, but he believes the whole
garrison was marched off to meet the
Russians, and that they're all prisoners
now — which is his only drop of comfort.
I've tried to console him for, having
missed what he went to see. I said,
“Perhaps the eclipse or whatever it
was will happen again soon—or one
like it.” He groaned out, “My dear
lady, that particular conjunction of the
heavenly bodies will not occur again
for 2,645 years, 9 months, 3 weeks and
2 days.” So there it is, my dearest
Would it cheer you up to hear a
small romance of war and knitting?
Here it is, then. Some time ago
Monica Jermyn brought round some
terrific mitts she'd knitted to go in one
of my parcels for the troops. She's
easily the worst knitter who ever held
needles! “My dear child,” I said, “what
simply ghastly mitts! They're full of
mistakes.” “What's it matter?”
Monica answered. “Mistakes will keep
them quite as warm as the right
stitches. Besides, they’re all right. I
knit ever so much better now than
when I used to make socks for the Deep
Sea Fisherman last year.” “That's
not saying much,” I said. “I remember
those socks for the Deep Sea Fisher-
men, and I doubt whether even the
deepest sea fishermen would know how
to put them on 1 What's this?” “It’s
a message to go with the mitts,”
replied Monica. This was the message:
—“The girl who made these mitts
hopes they will be a comfort to some
dear brave hands fighting for her and
her sisters in England.” “Oh, my
dear!” I remonstrated. “It’s very
young and romantic of you, but don't
you think it's just a little—” “No,
I don't l” she cried. “And if it is, I
don't care. “Please, please let it go!”
So it went.
Soon after that the Jermyns went
down to their place in Sussex, and
later I heard they’d some convalescent
war heroes as guests. Monica wrote
me: “All six of them are dear brave
darlinger than the others. Tell it not
in Gath, dear Blanche, but I think
I've met my fate | " Later she wrote:
“Ho's getting on splendidly. He
turns out to be a cousin of the Flum-
merys. He performed prodigies of
valour, but won't say a word about it.
When he leaves us my heart will quite,
quite break—and I sometimes hope his
will too ! ”
Yesterday came the following:—

now, though he still needs an arm at

was a chilly morning and, as I was
looking down and trying to think of

he heard I'd made them he was just
as comfondu as I was. “They were in

to these mitts, with the sweet little
message pinned to them, I simply
couldn't part with them And to think

said hurriedly, ‘Oh, I only wish they

been, “knit two together and make one"

enough if that's all there is to it,' he
said. “Knit two together and make
one.” Monica—no, you mustn't run

come home, and the boat was chased
and ran to an island for shelter, and
then the island was taken by one of
our enemies and he was a prisoner.
Then it was retaken by one of the
Allies and he was free again. Since
then more things have happened and
he's been a prisoner again, and free

DEAR CHARLEs, We haven't gone
yet. Upon my word, we don't know
what to do about it. We start off for
the Continent and then we halt and
ask ourselves, “Won't they be wanting
us to go to Egypt and have a word
with the enemy there?” So we come
back and change our underclothes and
start out again; but we haven't got far
before a persistent subaltern starts a
scare about invasions. At that we
halt again and have a pow-wow. Thick

earlier had befallen STEwART. -
Another splentdid piece of work was
accomplished when, after the bombard-

Provost-Marshal and Chief of Police,

many years later when he was offered
the post of Chief Commissioner of Police

MY FAVOURITE PAPER.
By A Voracious READER.
ALL day long I read the papers that
keep this little island noisy and tell us
how we ought to be governed. I can't
help it. I want to know the latest, and
reading the papers seems (more or less)
the way to get at it. The best way of
all, of course, is to meet a man at a club
or a resident in a locality favoured by
retired colonels; but, in default of those
advantages, one must buy the papers.
And then of course it follows that one
reads far too many papers and gets one's
head far too full of war news. Still,
what would you have 2 The war is
so eminently first and everything else
nowhere that this is inevitable.
Outside suggestion has its share, too.
Morning papers are a matter of course.
One reads one's regular morning papers
and no others. But after that the
trouble begins with the evening paper
placards, each with its lure. How can
one resist them 2 The progress of the
Allies! The repulsing of the enemy
The ten miles gained The Russian
advancel A German cruiser sunk
Each newsman has a different bait, and
as the day goes on they become more
attractive, so that one goes to bed at
night filled with optimism. Well,
these all have to be bought.
Speaking as a reader of too many of
them I must admit to a grievance or
two; and the chief is the difficulty that
we have in finding the fulfilment of all
the promises which are set out in the
headings to the principal war news.
For example, I find among these
headings on the day on which I write
a reference to a German admission of
failure and dismay. But ean I find the
thing itself? I cannot. It may be there,
but again and again has my eye
travelled up and down the columns
seeking the nutritious morsel and not
yet has it alighted thereon, and that is
but one case out of many. Sometimes
after a long hunt I do track these joyful
tit-bits down, and then discover that
they are separated from the heading by
several columns. Some day a news-
paper editor will arise who can achieve
a really useful index to his contents.
The Times used to have something of
the sort, but under the stress of battle
that has gone.
Another grievance—but I shall say
no more on that subject. Grievances
are for peace time, when a general
huffiness and stuffiness about the way
that everyone else conducts business is
natural and indeed expected. In war-
time no one should be harassed by
criticism. So I pass on to the paper
which I like best of all those now being
the news I most want to read, and
every day, or rather every night, it gets
better and will continue to get better
until the Brandenberg gate opens to let
the Allies in. This paper is not a
morning paper and not an evening
paper. It is published at night, in the
smallest of the small hours, and I am its
sole subscriber, for it is the paper of my
dreams. Whether or not I am its editor
I could not say. That question leads
to the greater one which would need a
volume for its decision: Do we compose
our own dreams, or are they provided
by Ole Luk Oie or some other dream-
spinner? Anyway, no one can read the
aper of my dreams but I, and it is,
aſter all, the best reading. It contains
the oddest things. Last night it had
a fine article about a football match in
the North of England. Twenty-two
terrific fellows, whose united salaries
came to a respectable fortune and
whose united transfer fees, should their
Clubs ever let them go, would be
sufficient to build a Dreadnought, had
been charging up and down the ground
in a series of magnificent rushes, while
ten thousand North of England lads
roared themselves hoarse to see such
glory. Suddenly a newspaper boy,
reckless of his life, dashed on to the
ground with a placard stating that
a whole regiment of British soldiers
had been trapped by a German ruse
and annihilated. In an instant the
game was broken up and every player
and every spectator who was of age
ran like hares to the nearest recruiting
office and enrolled themselves as
soldiers. They had seen in a flash
that the only chance for England to
get rid of this German menace was for
every eligible man to do his share.
In another part of the paper I read
of a young and powerful man in an
English village who, on being asked if
he did not think that England was in
danger, replied “Yes.” He was then
asked if he did not think that it was
necessary to fight for her, and he
replied “Yes” again. He was then
asked who in his opinion were the
most suitable volunteers to come to
her aid, and he replied, “Other people.”
So far the story is not appreciably
different from a story that you might
read anywhere. But the version in
my paper stated that he was seized by
all the company present and not only
ducked in the nearest horse-pond but
held under the water for quite a long
time, and then held under the water
again.
And another article—a most exciting
one—described the success of a British
aviator who flew over Essen and
dropped five bombs on KRUPP's gun
I forget his name, but, although he was
pursued, he got clear away and returned
to the Allies' lines. There was a fellow
for you!
So you see that I get some good
reading out of my favourite paper.
And more is to come !
THE PRICE OF WAR.
Now woe is me! My treasure, my
delight,
My guerdon after many toilsome days,
Shall gladden me no more. It was a
sight
To bid men gape in wonderment, and
praise
My patient courage that endured despite
The gibes of friends and Delia's pity-
ing ways.
Ah, cruel fate that forced my hand
to snip
Such costly growth as graced my
upper lip !
Moustache most cherished l Not as
other men
That let their lush growth riot as it
will,
With just a formal waxing now and
then,
Did I maintain it. Nay, with loving
skill
And all the precious oils within the ken
Of cunning alchemists I strove until
Its soaring points aspired to pierce
the skies,
And I was martial in my Delia's
eyes.
Great store of gold I lavished. Yea, I
went
To one that works in metals and I
bought
A kind of dreadful iron instrument
With leathern straps, most wonder-
fully wrought,
And wore that horror nightly, well
content
To bear such anguish for the prize
I sought.
And all this patient toil was thrown
away—
They stoned me for the KAISER
yesterday !
At a time when every penny that
can be spared is needed for the help
of our soldiers in the field and of our
wounded, or to relieve the distress of the
Belgian refugees or our own sufferers
from the War, a public appeal is being
made to the citizens of Newcastle-on-
Tyne for subscriptions to a fund for
presenting a testimonial to their Lord
Mayor, on the ground that he has done
his duty. We beg to offer our respect,

I HAD done the second hole (from the

her seated at the table in the breakfast-

though somewhat attenuated, was re-
cognisably a cigarette. I lit it, and
when I had finished coughing I came
to the conclusion that if only I could
induce Joan to present her gift to the
German troops instead of to our
Tommies it would precipitate our ulti-
mate triumph. I had to eat several
mulberries before I felt capable of pro-
ceeding to the third hole. When I got
there (in two) I found it occupied by a
squadron of wasps while reinforcements
were rapidly coming up from a hole
beneath the shed. Being hopelessly
outnumbered I contented myself with
a strategical movement necessitating
several stiff rearguard actions.
Joan, growing a little more proficient,
had in a couple of days made 500
cigarettes. I had undertaken to des-
patch them, and one morning she came
to me with a neatly-tied-up parcel.
“Here they are,” she said; “but you
must ask at the Post Office how they
should be addressed. I've stuck on a
label.” -
I went out, taking the parcel with
me, and walked straight to the tobacco-
nist's. -
“Please pack up 1,000 Hareems,” I
said, “and post them to the British
Expeditionary Force. Mark the label
“Cigarettes for the use of the troops.'
And look here, I owe you for a pound
of tobacco my wife bought the other
day. I'll square up for that at the
same time. By-the-by, what tobacco
was it 2." -
“Well, Sir,” the man replied, “I
hardly like to admit it in these times,
but it was a tobacco grown in German
East Africa. It really isn't fit to
smoke, and is only good for destroying
wasps' nests or fumigating greenhouses,
| which I thought your lady wanted it
| for, seeing as how she picked it out for
| herself. Some ladies nowadays know
| as much about tobacco as what we do.”
I left the shop hurriedly. The
| problem of the disposal of Joan's well-
meaning gift was now solved. I re-
turned home and furtively stole up the
side path into the garden. Under
cover of the summer-house I undid the
parcel and proceeded rapidly to strip
the paper from those of the cigarettes
that had not already become hollow
mockeries. When I had collected all
the tobacco I went in search of the
gardener, and encountered him return-
ing from one of his numerous meals.
“Wilkins,” I said, “there is a wasps'
nest on the third green, and here is
some special wasp - eradicator. Will
you conduct the fumigation?"
As Joan and I were walking round
the garden that evening before dinner
“I don't want to blush to find it seemed to me that he called a saw a
fame, but—do you know—I prefer doing
good by stealth.”
A faint but unmistakable odour was
borne on the air from the direction of
the third green.
“So do I,” I said.
OUR NATIONAL GUEST.S.
My wife attributes our success (so
far) in the entertainment of Belgian
Refugees solely to the fact that we
have not, and never have had, a vestige
of a committee. We all work along in
the jolliest possible way, and we have
no meetings, or agenda, or minutes,
or co-opting of additional members, or
remitting to executives or anything of
that kind. We just bring along any-
thing that we think will be useful.
Some of us bring clothes and others
butter or umbrellas, or French books,
or razor-strops or cigarettes. Hep-
burn, the dairy farmer, keeps send-
ing cart-loads of cabbages; old Miss
Mackintosh at the Brae Foot sends
threepence a week. And when we are
short of anything we just stick up a
notice to that effect in the village shop.
I issued a call for jam yesterday and
ever since it has rained pots and pots.
We have three large families of Belgians
and we have already got to the stage
where the men are at work and the
children at school—though no one really
has the least idea what they do there.
But although I admit that it is
magnificent to be without a committee
—we escaped from that by the simple
plan of getting the Belgians first and
trusting to the goodwill of the Parish
to take care of them afterwards—there
are other important factors in our
success. There is our extraordinary
foresight—of course it was a pure fluke
really—in obtaining among them a
real Belgian policeman. You can have
no idea what a fine sense of security
that gives us in case anything goes
wrong. We have already enjoyed his
assistance in a variety of ways, and we
have something still in reserve in the
very unlikely event of his being pro-
fessionally called in — his uniform.
When we put him into his uniform
the effect will be tremendous.
Then again we have the advantage
of being Scotch. I simply don't know
how English country people are going
to get on at all Here we find that by
talking with greav emphasis in the very
broadest Scotch—by simply calling
soap sape and a church a kirk you
can quite frequently bring it off and
make yourself understood. I had a
most exhilarating hour of mutual
lucidity with the one that makes
zog, which was surely quite good
enough; and when he referred to a
hammer as a hamer it might surely be
said to be equivalent to calling a spade
a spade.
Still the language difficulty remains,
and the worst of it is that it gives an
altogether unfair advantage—where all
are so anxious to help —to the few
select people in our neighbourhood who
happen to be able, fortuitously, to talk
French. They are—(1) Dr. Anderson,
whose French is very good; (2) my
wife, who is amazingly fluent in a
crisis, though her constructions simply
don't bear thinking of; (3) the school.
master, who is weak; (4) the joiner,
who is bad; (5) myself, who am awful.
Several of our Refugees talk French.
Of course we all have pocket-diction-
aries, but even they don't always help
us out. I found my wife once engaged
in a desperate hand-to-hand encounter
with the one who does the cooking
about some household necessity that
was sadly lacking. She was com-
pletely baffled. It was pure stalemate,
a deadlock. I pulled out my diction-
ary and suggested to the cook (by
illuminative signs) that she should
look it up and point to the English
word. There was some rejoicing at
this, and she at once called upon
the collective wisdom of her whole
family. At last they got it with much
nodding of heads and exhibited the
book, buttressed with an eager finger
at the place. And we looked and read
“A young gold-finch; ” so you will see
that that didn't help us much. It was
only by the almost miraculous emer.
gence of the word Fat in the course of
their own private conversation shortly
afterwards that light came to us.

total ignorance of oat-meal. They are
quite at sea there, and so far have only
employed it for baiting a bird-trap: and
that touches us closely, for the very

we feel, compensate for their attitude
of negation towards this very staple

among us bent on their conversion.

will be comfortable and contented

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN the good old days when that royal pipsqueak, our
FIRST JAMEs, came to the throne, if you were a physician
of a little more than common skill and furnished with
theological opinions of a modernist complexion, or a lonely
woman with (or without) some cunning in the matter of
herbs, who cherished a peculiar (or normal) pussy-cat, you
were quite likely to be burnt out of hand. And, in her
competent way, MARY Johnston, in The Witch (CoNSTABLE),
deals with this dark blot on the escutcheon of Christianity.
Through what suffering and what joys Dr. Aderhold, the
kindly free-thinking mystic, and Joan Heron, the simple
village maid, found their ultimate and, for the times, merciful
release by halter in place of fire, readers who have nerves to
spare for horror will read with eagerness. It is indeed a
dreadful story. Miss Johnston is not one of your novelists
who lets herself off the contemporary document, and on
her reputation you may take it she is not far out. The
grim tale serves to show to what lengths the force of sugges-
tion will, in times of excitement, carry folk otherwise sober
and truthful. Manifestly preposterous evidence, freely
given, was freely admitted by trained legal minds—evidence
on which innocent lives were sacrificed at the average rate
of over a thousand a month in England and Scotland in the
two centuries of the chief witch-baiting period. But, after
all, have we not, most of us, near relations who saw a
England in the dead of an August night 2 And have we
not But I grow tedious. The Witch is an eminently
readable story of adventure of the coincidental kind.
What I like best in the stories of Mr. W. W. JAcobs,
apart from their mere hilarity, is their triumphant vindica-
tion of the right to jest. They spread themselves before
me like a pageant representing the graceful submission of
the easy dupe. They tempt me to filch away chairs from
beneath stout and elderly gentlemen who are about to sit
down. Take the case of Sergeant-Major Farrer in Night
Watches (HopDER AND SToughton). He was afraid of
nothing on earth, or off it, but ghosts, and he despised the
weedy young man who was in love with his daughter. So
the weedy young man dared him to come to a haunted
cottage at midnight, and, dressed up as a spectre, terrified
the soldier into something more than a strategic retreat,
with the result that he surrendered his daughter. In real
life of course it is different. I know a colour-sergeant, and
somehow I rather think that if I—but never mind. In
Mr. JAcobs' beautiful world, as it is with Mr. Farrer so is
it with Peter Russet, with Ginger Dick and with Sam
Small. They know when the laugh is against them, and,
waiving the appeal to force or to law, they grumble but
retire. There is one exercise in the gruesome in Night
Watches, but it hardly shows Mr. JAcoBs at his best in
this particular vein. There are also several charming
illustrations by Mr. STANLEY DAVIs, executed with a buff

quarter-of-a-million of astrakanned Russians steal through

romance, The Divine Fire, confess to a sense of almost
personal sorrow that such high giſts as hers, which still
show no trace of decline in craftsmanship, should have
suffered so much taint. I sincerely hope that the noble
work she is now doing with the Red Cross at the front—
where the best wishes of her many friends follow her—may
make more clear the claim that is laid upon her to devote
her exceptional powers as a writer to the higher issues of
life and death; or, at the least, to something cleaner and
sweeter than the morbid atmosphere of her present theme.
It has been my private conviction that the most
depressing and shuddersome of all natural prospects is the
wide expanse of mud and slime to be found at low water
in the estuary of a tidal river. Such scenes have always
been singularly abhorrent to me. Mr. “ADRIAN Ross"
appears to share this feeling, for out of one of them he
has made the novel and very effective setting for his
bogie-tale, The Hole of the Pit (ARNOLD). It is a story
of the Civil Wars, though these have less to do with the
action than the uncivil and very gruesome war waged
between the Lord of Deeping Castle and the Unseen Thing
that lived in the Pit. The Pit itself is real joy. It
have been better. There was a real snap in the struggle
between the English hero, Hilary Warde, who had nearly
perfected a system of wireless telephony, and the Berlin
magnates who wished to bluff him out of the results. . As
I say, I liked these early scenes and some others subse-
quently that dealt with rather sensational finance (it always
cheers me up when the hero makes half-a-million pounds
in a single chapterſ) better than those that had to do with
Warde's domestic entanglements and the deterioration of
his character. And the climax seemed inadequate to the
point of bathos. But there is much in the tale to enjoy;
and you might read it if only for a vivid word-picture of
what Berlin used to be like before the beginning of the
great débâcle. This has now an interest almost historical

TO THE BITTER END.
(A word with the War-Lord.)
A RUMoUR comes from Rome (where rumours breed)
That you are sick of taking blow on blow,
And would inter with all convenient speed
The hatchet wielded by your largest foe.
Is it the shadow Christmas casts before
That makes the iron of your soul unbend,
And melt in prayer for this unholy war
(Meaning the part that pinches most) to end ?
Is it your fear to mark at that high feast
The writing on the wall that seals your ſate,
And, where the Christ-star watches in the lºast,
To hear the guns that thunder at your gate?
For on your heart no Christmas Peace can fall.
The chimes shall be a tocsin, and the red
Glow of the Yule-wood embers shall recall
A myriad smouldering pyres of murdered dead.
And anguish, wailing to the wintry skies,
Shall with its dirges drown the sacred hymn,
And round your royal hearth the curse shall rise
Of lowly hearths laid waste to suit your whim.
And you shall think on altars left forlorn,
On temple-aisles made desolate at your nod,
Where never a white-robed choir this holy morn
Shall chant their greeting to the Birth of God.
Peace? There is none for you, nor can be none;
For still shall Memory, like a fetid breath,
Poison your life-days while the slow hours run,
Till it be stifled in the dust of Death.

WHY I DON'T ENLIST.
[Curiosity is often expressed regarding the causes which have pre-
vented young men from enlisting. Considerable interest, therefore,
should attach to the following replies to enquiries, an inspection of
which has been permitted us by the Secretary of the Patriotic
League, an organisation which seeks to stimulate recruiting by writ-
ing to young healthy and unmarried men and asking them why
they do not join the colours.]
MY DEAR SIR,--I fully understand your views—in fact
I am in cordial agreement with them. It would be
quite fair to say of most young unmarried men that they
could and should be spared. But this cannot be said of
all young men. There is a small section of literary and
other artists whose lives must continue to be immeasurably
precious to the nation which has given them birth. From
this company it is impossible for me to exclude myself.
There is a higher patriotism, to the dictates of which I
must respond. With infinite regrets, and thanks for what
is doubtless a well-meant endeavour,
I am, dear Sir, yours sincerely,
ENDYMION BRowNE.
P.S.–If you should be in town on the 24th, I am giving
a reading from my own works at the United Intensities
Club—“A Night with Endymion Browne.”
DEAR SIR,-What you say is O.K. KITCHENER must
have men and all that sort of thing. Show the KAISER
who's boss, and so on. But there are some men who can't
possibly go. And I'm one. It's all very well to say “Go,”
but if I go–let me ask you quite seriously--how on
earth is Smoketown Tuesday F.C. to lift the English pot?
I don't want to shout about myself, but it is a known fact
I'm worth £200 a week to the gate alone. . If you don't
care to accept my word, that it is absolutely impossible
for me to go, I'll refer you to what our secretary says at
foot. Yours, ALF Booter.
Note by Secretary—What Booter says is quite true. He
is indispensable. We paid £1,000 for his transfer, and
could not possibly sanction his leaving us. Besides, some
of his many thousand admirers might want to follow his
example, and where would our gate be then?

DEAR SIR,--I know what my job is, so don't you come
poking your nose in where it isn't wanted. I'm for
England, I am. And I'm doing my bit. The Evening
Wiper said only the other day that a Britisher's duty was
to keep cheerful, and that the man who did that was
serving his country. Well, I am cheerful—I didn't turn a
hair even over Mons—slept exactly the same, and had
bacon and tomato for my breakfast. Then they say, “Carry
on.” And I do carry on. I go out as usual, dress just
as carefully—spats, fancy waistcoat, buttonhole, etc. One
night it's the imperial and another it's the Cinema. Men
are wanted to cheer the patriotic songs and to sing the
chorus of “Tipperary.” I help here. Then I spend my
money freely—freely, I tell you. Any Tommy I meet can
have a drink—half a dozen at my expense, and no return
expected. I got two quite blind last night, and never
asked 'em for a sou. Then again, I've spent quite a lot on
flags. I always wear six on the front of my bike when I
scorch through the crowds coming out of church on Sun-
days. I've got portrait buttons, too, of JoFFRE and Kirch.,
and I'm never ashamed to wear 'em. And I'm always
urging chaps to go and enlist. So you see I am doing my
bit. Yours truly, ALBERT SPOTTI.E.

My mind becomes a complete blank.

say to James.
“Go on,” says my instructor,
“Yes, but what 2 ” I ask. All desire

has left me.
“Anything. Ask him, if a herring
and a half costs three ha'pence, how

“Yes, but that's too long. It would
take me at least a week, and by that
time the herring would be censored.
No, I've got it.”
It has occurred to me suddenly that
it would annoy James if I reminded
him of his professional life. He looks so
military in his puttees and khaki shirt.
“Do-you—want—a — nice — mort-
gage 2 ” I signal.
James takes it up to “nice,” and
then breaks down. The “m-o’’ he
reads as “s-w” (an easy mistake to
make), and he imagines that I am
offering him a nice sword—a fitting
offer to one of his martial appearance.
When the third letter turns out to be
not the “o ” which he expected, he
loses his head and signals “Repeat.”
I give it him again slowly. He reads
the first five letters as s-w-r-t-g and
assumes, this time that I am offering
him a nice town in Poland. It is five
minutes before we get the mortgage
properly established, and by then
James is utterly disgusted.
He is now going to send a message
to me. There is nothing half-hearted
about James when he has his khaki
shirt on. -
“Why the devil don't you send up
those guns 3" he signals.
General James is hard pressed. The
enemy is advancing in echelon against
his left wing; cavalry beat themselves
against the hollow square on his right;
his centre has formed platoon after

comes on. Where the devil are those

“Must fall back,” he said, and he
caught a flag between his legs and did
SO
Reluct-
Well, there you have us signalling.
To show you us skirmishing I cannot
do better than describe the fierce en-
gagement between A and C Companies,
which resulted in the entire annihila-
tion of A. But perhaps that would not
be fair. I am a prejudiced recorder;
let one of A Company speak.
He was annoyed.
“We worked round their flank,” he
said, “and we'd got quite close up to
them under cover of a wood when we
came on one of them smoking a pipe.
He said he was an outpost, and that
he'd decimated us all long ago.”
“What did you do?” asked his
friend.
“We scragged him.”
Personally I had a safer position
among the supports. A decimated
enemy in the first flush of annoyance
can be dangerous. I merely lay in a
ditch and counted ants . . . But I was
very glad to hear we'd won.
Rifle exercises go on apace. We
have a curious collection of weapons
(“weapons of precision” as they are
called by those who have never seen
my targets), an order for six hundred
of one family having fallen through,
owing to a clerical error. “We can
offer you 600 rifles, 1900 pattern,” the
firm wrote; but an inspection of them
showed that the “6” and the “9 " had
got mixed up.
But even with more modern weapons
than these we are not very formidable
as yet, and for some weeks we must
rely on other methods of striking
terror into the hearts of the enemy.
Luckily we are acquiring an excellent
substitute for lead. As an example of
“frightfulness” nothing can exceed the
appearance of one of our really mixed
platoons lying on its backs and waving
its legs in the air. This is one of the
Swedish drill movements . . . and, as
I think I have mentioned before, we
are all ages and shapes . . .
Let me conclude with a little story
to show the dangers to which we are
subject and the fearlessness with which
we face them. I cite the case of
Reginald Arbuthnot Wilkins.
R. A. Wilkins is just as keen as they
make them, and it is his great sorrow
that, being in an important Govern-
ment office, he is not allowed to enlist.
For my liking he is too smart; when
he does a “right-turn " he does it with
click of the heels is all very well, but
Reginald Arbuthnot makes his neck
click too. An “eyes-right” nearly takes
his head off.
A dozen of them, including Reginald,
were being taught saluting the other
day. There was an imaginary Field-
Marshal or somebody on the left, and
they were told to turn the head smartly
to the left, at the same time bringing
the right hand up to the salute. . . .
“Sa-lute!” Reginald Arbuthnot Wilkins
whizzed his head round to the left, but
accidentally brought the wrong hand
up. There was a crash as his left thumb
met his left eye-ball, and Reginald was
in hospital for a week.
The remarkable thing is that the
other eleven, quite undismayed, went
on practising the salute. That gives
you some idea of our spirit.

It was the special terms to Special
Constables that tempted me—and I fell.
I don't just remember how many
times I fell, but it was pretty nearly
as often as the “Professor" of the
wily art took hold of me. Before the
first lesson was over, falling became
more than a mere pastime with me, it
grew into a serious occupation.
So I left the jiu-jitsu school at the
end of the second lesson with a nodding
acquaintance with some very pretty
holds and a very firm determination to
practise them on Alfred when he got
back to the office next day from
Birmingham.

As he came in I advanced with out-

“How goes it?” he said cheerily,
holding out his hand.
“Like this,” I said, as I gripped his
right wrist instead of his fingers,
turned to the left till I was abreast

THE DOCTHOR'S WAR SPEECH.
Martin Cassidy told it to me. He
was there, and he saw the boys form

the next day. There were seventeen of
them, and he said he'd never forget it.
“'Twas the Docthor's war speech that

Martin subsided a while to show
me Doolan's pig, which was taking

marked, “is corrosive ividence of what

bark of approval is welcomed by the
manager of the theatre and by the
regular patrons. Indeed, I firmly be-
lieve that Boanerges attracts extra
patronage to the Thursday matinées.
He also enjoys lions and tigers, but
not crocodiles or snakes. As I have
said, he is of the old bulldog breed.
On Thursday last I took Boanerges
with me as usual. It was a dull pro-
gramme at first, being chiefly devoted
to imaginative drama in a Red Indian
reservation. - Boanerges growled the
old bulldog growl once or twice, and I
could see that he was disappointed
with the performance.
Then came the film of topical events.
A heading appeared on the screen:
“The Germans in Louvain.” I could
feel Boanerges stiffen all over his wiry
bristles.
The stark ruins were shown, with
Prussian soldiers on arrogant sentry-
go. Somebody, no doubt a refugee,
“A bas les Bosches 1 ''
Then came a picture of the main
square of Louvain, with a group of
generals waiting for the march-past
and the salute. The soldiers marched:
towards us, victorious and triumphant,
at the goose-step.
That was the breaking-point. Flesh
and blood could stand it no longer. All
the bulldog strain pounded in his veins.
With a roar of anger such as I have:
never before heard from him, Boanerges
leapt from my restraining hands and
made for the picture.
He dashed straight at the screen and
through it! He devoured a whole
company of goose-stepping Prussians
at, so to speak, one mouthful. -
I also, unwontedly moved, rose in
my seat and shouted, “Up and at 'em "
Boanerges hit the boarding behind
the screen, and I think that his nose,
now in bandages, is permanently dam-
aged. Still, his brave deed echoes
through Hastings, and recruiting in the
town is brisker than it has ever been
before. -
This time, Sir, I feel confident that
you will not refuse Boanerges his well-
deserved place in your columns.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
- - - - - - No. VIII. - -
(From Işichard Dickson, generall yknown as Cock-eyed Dick,
Irivate in the South Loamshire Light Infantry.)
I suppose I ought to beg your Majesty's humble pardon
for using a pencil for this letter, but it's a good pencil, and,
anyhow, we don't run to ink in the trenches.” I don't want
to be disrespectful to your Majesty's Highness. Fact is
I'm just a bit fond of you; you're doing our chaps such a
world of good, keeping our hearts up in a mauner of
speaking and making us all so angry. When your regi-
ments come out against us, the word goes round, and it's
“Steady, boys; remember we're a contemptible little army;
let's show 'em a bit of contemptible shooting at 800 yards,”
or “Fix your contemptible bayonets and go for 'em;" and I
warrant there's many a German chap out of the fighting
line for good and all just on account of that nasty word.
There's another word, too, that some of your chaps have
slung at us...They say we're a “mercenary" lot, meaning
that we took up with soldiering just because we're paid to
do it. . Well, we are paid a shilling or two now and then,
but don't you go and make no mistake; we don't stick it
out in the trenches, with Black Marias playing bowls with
us, and the machine-guns crackling at us and the snipers
picking us off just because of getting a few shillings, which
very often we don't get regular. We're in for this job, ah,
and we're going to see it through, too, because we think
it's the right thing to do and because we wanted to do a
turn of fighting. We ain't bloodthirsty, and I'm not going
to say we shall be miserable when it's all over, but while it's
going on we like it. There's risks everywhere, even with
the quietest jobs. I knew a chap once as drove a goat-cart
for children at the seaside, and one day when the wind
was strong it blew off his hat, and he got to chasing it, and
before he knew where he was he'd gone over the cliff. A
careful man he was, too, but he hadn't reckoned up that
particular chance when he put his savings into a goat and
a two-wheeled cart, You can't think of everything, even if
you happen to be a Kaiser. I've heard, by the way, that
you ain't paid so badly for your job of Kaisering; and old
Uncle Franky over in Austria, he rakes 'em in, too, but we
don't call you a mercenary pair, though what drove you to
take up the business is more than I can make out.
I don't want you to go and make no mistake. You've
stirred us up a bit with all your talk, but we've got no
grudge against your soldiers. : We don't hate 'em. They're
good fighting men, though I'm not saying that we ain't
better, and good fighting men don't hate one another. We
got one of your blokes the other day. He came on with
the attack, and when we'd beaten it off, there he was still
coming on. He'd dropped his rifle and his helmet was off,
and he was groping about with his hands, and he wasn't
shouting “Hock! Hock!” but he didn't stop. We didn't
loose off at him, there was something so funny about him,
and in another minute he tumbled in right atop of us and we
took him. He told us afterwards he'd lost his spectacles
and couldn't see a yard in front of him, and that was the
reason for his being so brave. He talked English, too, but
in a funny way, slow and particular and like as if he'd got
a bit of suet pudding in his mouth. Well, we soon made
him snug and tidy and then we started to pull his leg and
fill him up, and he swallowed it all down. We told him
something had gone wrong with the beefsteak pie and the
jam tartlets and the orange jelly, and he'd have to satisfy
himself with his own rations; but to-morrow there'd be a
prime cut of mutton and an apple-tart; and he believed all
our fairy tales and said he'd write the story of the English
army's food if ever he got home alive. He was a learned
man too, but his lost spectacles gave him a lot of trouble.
The end of it was we made quite a pet of him, and we were
quite sorry when we got relieved and took him to the rear
and handed him over as a prisoner. There wasn't any
hatred about it. Yours, Cock-EYED DICK.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Sinister Street, Vol. II. (SECRER) is a book for which I
have been waiting impatiently this great while, and I
welcomed it with eagerness. The first volume left off, you
may remember, with Michael just about to go up to Oxford.
Knowing what Mr. Compton MacKENziE could do with
such a theme, I have anticipated all these months that to
watch his hero at the university would be to renew my
own youth. The book has appeared now, and I am justi-
fied of my faith. I say without hesitation that the first
half of this second volume (which, by the way, to show
that it is a second volume and not a sequel, starts at page
499) is the most complete and truest picture of modern
Oxford that has been or is likely to be written. For those
who, like myself, have their most cherished memories bound
up with the life of which it treats, the actuality of the
whole thing would make criticism impossible. But as a
matter of fact these seventeen chapters seem to me to
show Mr. MACKENziE's art at its best. They display just
that strange combination of realism and aloofness that
gives to his writing its special charm. No one has ever
(for example) reproduced more perfectly the talk of young
men; and this scattered speech, in what Mr. MacKENzie
himself might call its infinitely fugacious quality, contrasts
effectively with the deliberate, somewhat mannered beauty
of the setting. Mr. MacRENzie is an overlord of words,
old and new, bending them to strange and unexpected uses,
yet always avoiding affectation by the sheer vitality of his
strength. As for the matter of these first chapters, one might
epic of adolescence wherein growth is the only movement.
Events are for the second half of the volume. Here Michael
has come down from Oxford, and has set himself to find
and rescue by marriage the girl Lily, whom (you remem-
ber) he loved as a boy, and who has since drifted into the
underworld. About this part of the story I will only say
that, though the art is still there and the same haunting
melody of style, Mr. MACKENziE has too strong a sense of
atmosphere to allow him to treat squalor in a fashion that
will be agreeable to the universe. Frankly, the over-nice
will be prudent to take leave of Michael on the Oxford
platform. The others, following to the end, will agree
with me that he has placed his creator definitely at the
head of the younger school of English fiction.
For me, the pleasure of travelling consists less in the
sight of museums, cathedrals, picture galleries and land-
scapes, than in the study of the native man in the street
and his peculiar ways. When abroad, “I am content to note
my little facts,” and so is Mr. GEO. A. BIRMINGHAM; in
fact, it was he who first thought of mentioning the matter.
The reverend canon tours in the U.S.A., which is, when
you come to think of it, about the only safe area for the
purpose nowadays; he observes the manners and oddities
of the Americans, whether as politicians, pressmen, hustlers,

instead of being summoned a day or two later when the
grotesque circumstances of the crime have baffled the

wherever he goes with his flapping hat and his umbrella

assuaged by the brilliant narrative manner in which The

[Novº MBER 25, 1914.
THE PRICE OF PATRIOTISM.
HELEN and I are economising; so
the other evening we dined at the
Rococo.
“That's no economy,” you cry; so
let me explain.
In common with most other folk
who are not engaged in the manu-
facture of khaki, or rifles, or Army
woollens, or heavy siege-guns (to which
I had not the foresight to turn my
attention before the war came along),
we have found it necessary to adopt
a policy of retrenchment and reform;
and one of our first moves in this
direction was to convert Evangeline
from a daily into a half-daily, Evan-
geline is not a newspaper but a domestic
servant, and before the new order was
issued she had been in the habit of
arriving at our miniature flat at 7.30 in
the morning (when it wasn't 8.15),
and retiring at 9 in the evening.
Now, however, Evangeline goes after
lunch, and Helen, who has bought a
shilling cookery book, prepares the
dinner herself.
On the day in question Helen sud-
denly decided to spend the aſternoon
repairing a week's omissions on the
part of Evangeline. It proved a veri-
table labour of Hercules, the flat
being, as Helen with near enough
accuracy gave me to understand, an
“Aegaean stable.” Tea-time came, but
brought no tea. Shortly before seven
Helen struck, and declared (this time
without any classical metaphor) that
she wasn't going to cook any dinner
that evening. Not to be outdone, I
affirmed in reply that even if she did
cook it I wasn't going to clear it. away.
So we cleaned and adorned ourselves
and groped our way to the Rococo.
We were both too tired to go to the
trouble of choosing our dinner, and it
was therefore that we elected to make
our way through the table-d'hôte, to
which we felt that our appetite, unim-
paired by tea, could do full justice.
Luxuriously we toyed with hors-d'oeuvre,
while the orchestra patriotically inti-
mated that ours is a Land of Hope and
Glory; blissfully we consumed our soup,
undeterred by repeated reminders of
the distance to Tipperary. It was
with the fish that the trouble started.
At the second mouthſul it began to
dawn upon me that what the band
was playing was the Brabançonne, I
looked around, and gathered that I
was not alone in the realisation of that
fact; for one by one my fellow-diners
struggled hesitatingly to their feet, and
stood in awkward reverence while the
National Anthem of our brave Belgian
Allies was in course of execution. I
looked at Helen, and Helen looked at
me, and we both tried not to look too
regretfully at our plates as we also
adopted the prevailing pose. Not one
note of that light-hearted anthem did
the orchestra miss, and when it was
over the warmth in our hearts almost
compensated for the coldness of our
fish. We decided to jump at once to
the cit tree.
Whatever else may be said of the
Marseillaise, there can be no mistaking
its identity. The first bar sufficed to
bring the whole room to attention, and
a promising dish of sweetbreads shared
the fate of its predecessor. Before the
final crash had ceased to reverberate
we sat down with a thump, resigning
ourselves to the prospect of doing
double justice to the joint. But the
orchestra was not so lightly to be
cheated of its prey. True, we held out
as long as possible while the Russian
Hymn began to unfold its majestic
length, and Helen actually managed to
convey a considerable piece of saddle
of mutton to her mouth while she was
in the very act of rising. That joint,
however, was soon but a memory of
anticipation, and our hunger was still
keen upon us when the funereal strains
of the Japanese Anthem coincided with
the arrival of a wild duck. I had
always harboured secret doubts of the
advisability of Japan's joining in the
War, and now they were intensified
many times. Cold wild duck is an
impossibility even to a hungry man.
Ice-pudding, though scarcely satis-
fying, seemed to warrant the expecta-
tion that it would at least survive
whatever further ordeal the band had
in store for us. But that hope too
was doomed to extinction. When
God Save the King smote the air
the growing lethargy of the company
of diners vanished, and all joined with
a will in the recital of all its verses.
In the glow of loyal enthusiasm that
filled the room the ice gradually melted,
and as we surveyed the fluid mess upon
our plates we knew that our dinner
was gone beyond recall.
Weary and unappeased we crept
home through the City of Dreadful
Night, I found a remnant of cold
beef and some pickles in the kitchen,

WHILE much has been written of the songs that inspire
our own brave troops on the march, little is heard of those
affected by our Allies.
Happily Mr. Punch's Special Eye-witness with General
Headquarters in the Eastern Area has been enabled to send
us the words of a song which, set to an old Slav air, is
rendered with immense élan by the gallant Russians as
they go into battle. It is as follows:–
It's a hard nut is Cracow,
It's a hard nut to crack,
But it's not so hard to crack, oh!
When once you've got the knack.
Good-bye, Przemysl;
Farewell, Lemberg (Lwow);
It's a hard, hard nut to crack is Cracow,
But we'll soon crack it now.
By the more cultured Russian regiments, i.e., those
recruited in the neighbourhood of the German frontier, the
last line is lendered:—
But we'll crack it right off,
to rhyme with Lwoff—the correct pronunciation of Lwow,

AT THE PLAY.
KING HENRY IV., PART I.
I Coxixi FND Sir HERBERT TREE's
obvious desire to do his duty as an
actor-manager and a patriot. His true
intent is all for our good; and he sup-
ports his choice of a play in which
Falstaff is the central obsession by a
printed quotation from the words of
* That Wise Ruler Queen Elizabeth of
England,” where she says: “'Tis simple
mirth keepeth high courage alive.”
But yet he does not convince me that
he has chosen wisely here. For in the
first place we are not closely interested
in civil war, as we came near to
being in the dim Ulster period; and
patriotism, which it is his object to
encourage, is like to remain unaffected
by a play in which our sympathies
are fairly distributed between rebel and
royalist. In the second place I cannot
believe that the glorification of drunken-
ness and braggadocio in the person of
Falstaff can directly assist the cause
(which at this moment needs all the
help it can get) of sobriety and self-
respect.
Having made this protest I have little
but praise for the performance, itself,
though I think Sir HERBERT TREE's
own lethargy was not wholly to be
excused by the hampering rotundity of
his girth; and that all this deliberate
sword-play, where you wait till your
enemy has got his right guard before
you arrange a concussion between your
weapon and his, ſails to impose itself
as an image of War. But it was no
fault of the actors if we suffered a
further loss of actuality by the incred-
ible amount of fine poetry and rhetoric
thrown off by military men at junctures
calling for immediate action.
I also venture to make my complaint
to the author that the Falstaff scenes
are given too great a dominance, divert-
ing us from the main issue so long that
at one time we almost lost count of it;
and that the picture of that fat impostor
lying supine in a simulation of death
within a few feet of the fallen body of
the heroic Hotspur was repellent to
one's sense of the proprieties.
Mr. MATHEsox LANG was a brave
figure as Hotspur; but, after lately
seeing that other keen actor, Mr. Owen
NAREs, in the part of a modern intel-
lectual discussing the ethics of War, I
could not quite get myself to believe
in him as Prince Hal. He spoke
some of his lines with a fine ardour,
but he was too high-browed and slight
of body, and it was unthinkable that he
could ever have persuaded Hotspur to die
at his hands.
Sir HERBERT TREE affected an almost
proprietary interest in the bibulous
humours of Falstaff, presenting them
with an easy and leisurely restraint;
and Mr. BASIL GILL both in form
and manner made a quite good King.
The minor parts upheld the standard
of His Majesty's; and a pleasant
rattling of steel and shimmer of mail
ran through the scenes of active ser-
vice. Mr. PERCY MAcquoid had seen
to it that the period was there, and
Mr. Joseph HARKER had taken good
care that the jewelry of SHAKSPEARE's
verse should have the right setting,

Well, it is like this. A man who is

additional ones are thrust upon him.
He may do his best at home. He

way. Nice women must do their part.
But do they 2 No. They did at first,
but no longer.
Let me tell you. The other evening
I found myself one of the complacent
hosts of a party of merry chattering
young women, who seemed to be quite
satisfied with our attention. All of us
were just beginning to be very jolly,
and I had actually forgotten my hard
destiny of inactivity, when who should
come into the room but an officer on
crutches, who happened to be an ac-
quaintance of each of our guests but was
unknown both to me and my other just
too elderly male friends. In an instant
we were alone, and alone we remained
for certainly half an hour, while every
attention was being paid by our guests
to that other. When at last they tore
themselves away and returned, their
conversation was wholly confined to
their wounded friend's adventures, and
we need not have been there at all,
except to pay the bill.
Now it is no fun to me to deceive
anyone but myself, and hence I shall
not go about with my arm in a sling

appeal to all the young women to have

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PATRIOT.
This is a true story. Unless you
promise to believe me, it is not much
good my going on . . . You promise?
Very well.
Years ago I bought a pianola. I
went into the shop to buy a gramo-
phone record, and I came out with
a pianola — so golden - tongued was
the manager. You would think that
one could then retire into private life
for a little, but it is only the beginning.
There is the music-stool to be pur-
chased, the library subscription, the
tuner's fee (four visits a year, if you
please), the cabinet for the rolls, the
man to oil the pedals, the how-
ever, one gets out of the shop at last.
Nor do I regret my venture. It is
common talk that my pianola was the
chief thing about me which attracted
Celia. “I must marry a man with a
pianola,” she said . . . and there was
I . . . and here, in fact, we are. My
blessings, then, on the golden tongue
of the manager. -
Now there is something very
charming in a proper modesty about
one's attainments, but it is necessary
that the attainments should be gener-
ally recognized first. It was admir-
able in StephBNSoN to have said (as
I am sure he did), when they con-
gratulated him on his first steam-
engine, “Tut-tut, it's nothing; ” but
he could only say this so long as the
others were in a position to offer the
congratulations. In order to place you
in that position I must let you know
how extraordinarily well I played the
pianola. I brought to my interpretation
of different Ops an élan, a verve, a je ne
sais quoi—and several other French
words—which were the astonishment of
all who listened to me. But chiefly I
was famous for my playing of one piece:
“The Charge of the Uhlans,” by KARL
Bohai. Others may have seen Venice
by moonlight, or heard the Vicar's
daughter recite Little Jim, but the
favoured few who have been present
when Boh M and I were collaborating
are the ones who have really lived.
Indeed, even the coldest professional
critic would have spoken of it as “a
noteworthy rendition.”
“The Charge of the Uhlans.” If you
came to see me, you had to hear it. As
arranged for the pianola, it was marked
to be played throughout at a lightning
pace and with the loudest pedal on.
So one would play it if one wished to
annoy the man in the flat below; but a
true musician has, I take it, a higher
aim. I disregarded the “FF.'s" and the
other sign-posts on the way, and gave
it my own interpretation. As played
became a whole battle scene. Indeed,
it was necessary, before I began, that
I should turn to my audience and
describe the scene to them—in the
manner, but not in the words, of a
Queen's Hall programme:–
“Er—first of all you hear the cavalry
galloping past, and then there's a short
hymn before action while they form up,
and then comes the charge, and then
there's a slow bit while they–er—
pick up the wounded, and then they
trot slowly back again. And if you
listen carefully to the last bit you'll
actually hear the horses limping.”
Something like that I would say;
and it might happen that an insuffer-
able guest (who never got asked again)
would object that the hymn part was
unusual in real warfare.
“They sang it in this piece anyhow,”
I would say stiffly, and turn my back
on him and begin.
But the war put a stop to music as
to many other things. For three
months the pianola has not been
played by either of us. There are two
reasons for this: first, that we simply
haven't the time now ; and secondly, . .
that we are getting all the music we
want from the flat below. The flat
below is learning “Tipperary" on one
finger. He gets as far as the farewell
to Leicester Square, and then he breaks
down; the parting is too much for him.
I was not, then, surprised at the
beginning of this month to find Celia
looking darkly at the pianola.
“It’s very ugly,” she began.
“We can't help our looks,” I said in
my grandmother's voice.
“A bookcase would be much prettier
there.”
“But not so tuneful.”
“A pianola isn't tuneful if you never
play it.”
“True,” I said.
Celia then became very alluring, and
suggested that I might find somebody
who would like to be lent a delightful
pianola for a year or so by somebody
whose delightful wife had her eye on a
delightful bookcase.
“I might,” I said.
“Somebody,” said Celia, “who isn't
supplied with music from below."
I found John. He was quite pleased
about it, and promised to return the
pianola when the war was over.
So on Wednesday it went. I was
not sorry, because in its silence it was
far from beautiful, and we wanted
another bookcase badly. But on Tues-
day evening—its last hours with us–I
had to confess to a certain melancholy.
It is sad to part with an old and well-
tried friend, particularly when that
friend is almost entirely responsible
pianola and then I said to Celia, “I
must play it once again.”
“Please,” said Celia.
“The old masterpiece, I suppose?”
I said, as I got it out.
“Do you think you ought to—now?
I don't think I want to hear a charge
of the Uhlans—beasts; I want a charge
of our own men.”
“Art,” I said grandly, “knows no
frontiers.” I suppose this has been
said by several people several times
already, but for the moment both Celia
and I thought it was rather clever.
So I placed the roll in the pianola,
sat down and began to play . . .
Ah, the dear old tune . . .
Dash it all !
“What 's happened 2" said Celia,
breaking a silence which had become
alarming.
“I must have put it in wrong,” I
said.
I wound the roll off, put it in again,
and tried a second time, pedalling
vigorously.
Dead silence . . .
Hush A note . . . another silence
. and then another note . . .
I pedalled through to the end. About
five notes sounded.
“Celia,” I said, “this is wonderful.”
It really was wonderful. For the
first time in its life my pianola refused
to play “The Charge of the Uhlans."
It had played it a hundred times while
we were at peace with Germany, but
when we were at war—no!
We had to have a farewell piece.
I put in a waltz, and it played it per-
fectly. Then we said good-bye to our
pianola, feeling a reverence for it which
we had never felt before.
You don't believe this? Yet you
promised you would . . . and I still
assure you that it is true. But I
admit that the truth is sometimes hard
to believe, and the first six persons to
whom I told the story assured me
frankly that I was a liar. If one is to
be called a liar, one may as well make
an effort to deserve the name. I made
an effort, therefore, with the seventh
person.
“I put in ‘The Charge of the
Uhlans,” I said, “and it played 'God
Save the King.’” - a -

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR NATIONAL GUEST.S.
II.
THE truth is that the Belgians in
Crashie Howe are enjoying a succès fou.
There is the enterprising Marie, who
thinks nothing of going off on her
own, on the strength of an English
vocabulary only a fortnight old, over-
whelming the stationmaster and board-
ing an ambulance train full of wounded
Belgians at the local station to ask for
news of her brothers. (We were all
delighted when an adventurous letter
miraculously arrived from the Pas
de Calais on Saturday and reported
that both brothers were well and
unwounded.) There is Victor, who,
although only thirteen, is already a
pupille d'armée and has a uniform quite
as good as any fighting man. I can
tell you he has put our Boy Scouts in
the shade. But Victor is afraid the
war will be over before he is old enough
to get at it. -
Then, again, there is the small
Juliette, who is dark, with a comfortable
little face constructed almost entirely of
dimples, and, at the age of eight, has
been discovered knitting stockings at
a prodigious pace while she looked
the other way, I am afraid Juliette
is being held up as an example to
other children of the neighbourhood,
but I think her great popularity may
well survive even that. And there is
Louis, who is a marvel at making bird-
cages, and Rosalie, whose pride is in
the shine of her pots and pans. They
are all doing well.
Rosalie, it is true, has had a fearful
bout of toothache, so bad that she had
to retire to bed for a day. When
Dr. Anderson, whose French is very
good, had successfully diagnosed the
trouble and told her that the only cure
was to have the tooth out, she plain-
tively replied that she had thought of
that herself, but, alas, it was impossible,
for “it was too firmly implanted.”
For my part I sympathised with
Rosalie—I have often felt like that.
The grandmother rather likes to sit
apart, beaming, far from the general
throng, and it was for that reason that
I selected her at the very outset to
practise on in private. I tried her
more than once in my sadly broken
French ; I even went further and tried
her in rapidly - improvised Flemish.
Whenever I felt I was at my best I
used to go and have a turn at her, and,
although she smiled at me like any-
thing and was awfully pleased, I never
elicited the slightest response. Now I
know that she is almost stone deaf
and hasn't heard a word I have said.
As I came sadly away after this dis-
story of him who undertook to train
a savage in the arts of civilization,
only to learn, after some years of dis-
appointing, unlequited toil, that his
victim was not only a savage but also
a lunatic. I don't mean that to be
disrespectful to Grandmøre-—it is only
a parallel instance of good work thrown
away.
We are learning a good deal that is
new about the art of knitting. One
thing is that the Flemish knitter
cannot get on at all comfortably un-
less the needles are long enough to
tuck under her arms. I may safely
say that I never dreamt of that. At
first they fumbled about unhappily
with our miserable little needles, but
the ship's carpenter—who makes the
bird-cages—has found quite an in-
genious way out. He has mounted
all the needles at the end of a sort of
stilt or leg of cane (like a bayonet), and
since this innovation they are working
at a speed which, even in these days
of universal knitting, would be pretty
hard, to beat.
The children are really getting on
famously at school. A very touching
little romance was enacted there one
day. Eugène and Pierre, belonging to
different families, arrived in our midst
on different days and did not chance
to meet each other at first. At school
they happened to be put, away from
their compatriots, in the same room.
Eugène is eight and Pierre seven. It
was, you may well guess, pretty lonely
work for a small Belgian in a roomful
of Scotch boys, but both bore up
bravely. The subject, as I understand,
was simple addition (which knows no
frontiers and looks the same in any
language), and there is no whispering
or secret conversation in our school, I
can tell you. There they sat side by
side for two hours, each contemplating
the other as an alien, each smothering
pent-up feelings of home-sickness. And
then suddenly, at a single Flemish word
from the schoolmaster, the moment of
revelation came; it dawned on both of
them at once that they were not alone,
and, rising to their feet, they embraced
with tears of joy.
“Broeder "cried Eugène.
“Broeder!" echoed Pierre.
That was nearly a week ago. By
now Pierre is beginning to treat Eugène
in a slightly off-hand manner. He has
hardly time for him. He has so many
Scotch friends.

“During the night a terrific gale raged in
Manchester and surrounding districts, hail
and sleet being accompanied by a torrential
rainfall varied by Pendleton, Eccles, Seedley
and other lightning.”—People.
THE IMMORTAL LEGEND.
IN the House of Commons on Nov.
ember 18, Mr. KING asked the UNDER-
SECRETARY For WAR whether he could
state, without injury to the military
interests of the Allies, whether any
Russian troops had been conveyed
through Great Britain to the Western
area of the European War.
Mr. TENNANT's reply:-"I am uncer.
tain whether it will gratify or displease
my hon. friend to know that no Russian
troops have been conveyed through
Great Britain to the Western area of
the European War.”
The firm and faithful believers in this
beautiful tale are not to be put off so
easily as that, and there are so many
thousands of faces to be saved, and such
numbers of ear- (if not eye-) witnesses
of the undying exploit, that we really
must see if there is not after all some
loophole in the official pronouncement.
Let us pause for further scrutiny and
meditations.
Why, of course, here it is. The
UNDER-SECRETARY merely states his
imperfect knowledge of the bias of Mr.
KING. He does not know whether his
questioner is one of the ardent souls
who are ready to pass along and adorn
the latest legend from the Clubs, or a
cold-blooded sceptic fit only to be a
Censor.
No, we are not to be done out of our
Russians by any mere UNDER-SECRE-
TARY FoR WAR; certainly not one who
is capable of such prevarication. And
anyhow, why should the Germans do
all the story-telling?
THE WILD AND WOOLLY WEST
END.
“A PROTEST.-Is there any reason why the
War should be made an excuse for the
abandonment of the niceties of life? Lining
at a West-End restaurant nowadays one might
well imagine oneself in America, from the
variety and incongruity of the dress of the
male patrons.”–Adri. in “The Times."
WE fear that the protest is only too
well justified. Indeed, much, mºre
might be revealed were it not for the
heavy hand of the C–r. Our special

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman (MACMILLAN) that
impenitent pamphleteer, H. G. WELLs, returns yet again to
the intriguing subject of marriage, and in a vein something
nearer orthodoxy. Not, certainly, that worthy stubborn
orthodoxy of accepted unquestioned doctrine, or that sleeker
too tired or bored to go on asking questions, but an ortho-
doxy rather that is honest enough to revise on the
evidence earlier judgments as too cocksure and hasty. Sir
Isaac Harman was a tea-shop magnate, and a very pestilent
and primitive cad who caught his wife young and poor and
battered her into reluctant surrender by a stormy wooing,
whose very sincerity and abandonment were but a frantic
expression of his dominating egotism and acquisitiveness.
Wooing and winning, thinks this simple ignoble knight, is
a thing done once and for all. Remains merely obedience
very plain and absolute terms on the part of lady to
‘d, obedience which, in the last resort, can be exacted by
thholding supplies—not so uncommon a form of black-
ail as it suits the dominant sex to imagine. Lady
Jarman's emancipation does not take the conventionally
unconventional form, for some deeper reason, I think, than
that her sententious friend and would-be lover, George
Brumley, could not altogether escape her gentle contempt;
indeed, she recognises Sir Isaac's claims upon her for
duty and gratitude in a way which morern high-spirited
variety of middle-aged souls that were once young, now
merely for a limit to the proprietorship, for the right to a
separate individuality, the right to be useful in a wider
sphere (a phrase that stands for so much that is good and
less good). Mr. WELLs has realised this gracious, shy and
beautiful personality with a fine skill. It is no mean feat.
He might, so easily have made a dear mild ghost. And
oh if ladies of influence who regiment their inferiors in
orderly philanthropic schemes had some of the wisdom and
tolerance of Lady Harman in her dealings with the tea-
shop girls. You see one instinctively pays Mr. WELLs the
serious compliment of assuming that he has something
material to say about the things which matter.
As a demonstration of the irony of history, I can hardly
imagine a better subject for romance at the present
moment than the fortunes of WILLIAM of ORANGE, and
if Miss MARJoRIE BowFN's Prince and Heretic (METHUEN)
shows some traces of having been rather hastly finished
it is easy to pardon this defect. The alchemist's assistant,

earlier part of the story foretells the violent deaths of the
young princes of the house of Nassau and the ravaging
and looting of the Netherlands by ALVA, Defender of the

but he cannot conjure up out of his crystal the sight of a

If you elect to stay outside
And run no risk, on shore or Sea,
Where men for all men's sake have died
In this the War of Liberty

Larger than life, in New York Bay);-
If you prefer to fold your hands
And watch us, at your guarded ease,
Straining our strength to sweep the lands
Clean of a deadly foul disease,
Which must, unless our courage find a cure,
Fall on your children, swift and sure;—
Stay out by all means; none shall ask
The help that your free will declined;
We'll bear as best we may the task
That duty's call to us assigned;
And you shall reap, ungrudged, in happier years
The harvest of our blood and tears.

Only—when this long fight is done,
And, breathing. Freedom's purer air,
You share the vantage we have won—
Think not the honour, too, to share;
The honour shall be theirs and theirs alone
By whom the thrall was overthrown,
Meanwhile a boon: if not your swords,
Give us your sympathy at need; :
Show us the friendship which affords
At least to let its pockets bleed;
- And get your tradesmen kindly to forgo
Their traffic with a common foe.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER,
No. IX,
(From General row BERNHARDI.)
ALL-HIGHEST WAR LoRD,--To have received from you
a letter written in your own gracious and weapon-bearing
hand is an honourable privilege, under the weight of which
many a General might have felt his knees tremble, and I
confess that I too, though used to your Majesty's kindnesses,
have not been unmoved.
Your Majesty asks me what I now think of this war of
mine—I quote your words—and goes on to insinuate that
in some measure the humble books that I have from time
to time written, and the conversations I have held with
your supreme self and with others, are responsible for what
is now taking place in France, Flanders, and the Eastern
seat of war. This insinuation I must with all my strength
repudiate. It is true that I have been an advocate of war.
For the Germans it was necessary that war should be the
object of their policy in order that when the hour struck
they might be able to attack their foes under the most
favourable conditions and conquer them in the shortest
possible time. But in saying this I made myself merely
the echo of your Majesty's speeches and the faithful inter-
preter of your august mind. When you in words of match-
less eloquence spoke of the mailed fist and bade your
recruits shoot their parents rather than disobey their Kaiser,
a humble General like myself could not go far wrong if he
supposed that the thought of war was constantly in your
Imperial mind. No other nation, I knew, had the purpose
of attacking us, and I assumed therefore that if we were to
gain the world-power at which we aimed we must be ready
to attack other nations. Everything, however, depended
on the conditions and the moment. -
As for a war begun, as this war was begun, in a sudden
fit of temper, I must use frankness with your Majesty and
say that I never contemplated it. War against France–
yes; and war against Russia, if needs must be, though even
selves to be dragged into danger for the beaua yeux of the
Ballplatz. But to manage things so ill as to make it certain
that England must declare against us and that Italy must
refuse to help us—this, indeed, was the master-stroke of
stupidity. Your Majesty will, no doubt, say that this was
the fault of BETHMANN-Hollweg and voN JAgow, but I am
not sure that you yourself must not share with them the
t
out of the war, so as to deal with her alone at a later date,
but you took the bit between your autocratic teeth, and
alas, there was nobody who could stop you. -
I say again, this is not my war. I never imagined it, ºr

IN spite of the drastic regulations

be feared that books from British pub-

an unprecedented demand for How
to Collect Old Furniture arose in
neutral countries, accompanied by en-
quiries for similar works dealing with
silver plate, pictures and bijoutry. Sus-
picion respecting the ultimate destina-
tion of these books is strengthened by
the fact that of late the demand has |f
given place to urgent requests for stilts,

weighty point may therefore be regarded
as finally settled. Meanwhile from other
sources no less authentic some inter-
esting particulars have come to light
of the literary relaxations prevailing
among our enemy in the field. From
these it would appear that early in
September General voN KLUck received,
apparently from an anonymous ad-
mirer, a copy of The Mysteries of Paris,
in which he has been thoughtfully ab-
sorbed ever since. His Imperial mas-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A QUESTION OF LIGHT.
As soon as Celia had got a cheque-
book of her own (and I had explained the
mysteries of “ & Co.” to her), she
looked round for a safe investment of
her balance, which amounted to several
pounds. My offers, first of an old
stocking and afterwards of mines, mort-
gages and aerated breads, were rejected
at Once.
“I’ll leave a little in the bank in
case of accidents,” she said, “and the
rest must go somewhere absolutely safe
and earn me five per cent. Otherwise
they shan't have it.”.
We did what we could for her; we
offered the money to archdeacons and
other men of pronounced probity; and
finally we invested it in the Blanktown
Electric Light Company. Blanktown
do not like to let out any information
which may be of value to Celia's ene-
mies—the wicked ones who are trying
to snatch her little fortune from her.
The world, we feel, is a dangerous place
for a young woman with money.
“Can't I possibly lose it now 2 " she
asked.
“Only in two ways,” I said. “Blank-
town might disappear in the night, or
the inhabitants might give up using
electric light.”
It seemed safe enough. At the same
time we watched the newspapers
anxiously for details of the latest
inventions; and anybody who happened
to mention when dining with us that
he was experimenting with a new and
powerful illuminant was handed his
hat at once.
You have Blanktown, then, as the
depository of Celia's fortune. Now it
comes on the scene in another guise.
I made the announcement with some
pride at breakfast yesterday.
“My dear,” I said, “
asked to deliver a lecture.”
“What ever on ?” asked Celia.
“Anything I like. The last person
lectured on ‘The Minor Satellites of
Jupiter,’ and the one who comes after
me is doing “The Architecture of the
Byzantine Period,” so I can take some-
thing in between.”
“Like ‘Frostbites,’” said Celia help-
fully. “But I don't quite understand.
Where is it, and why?”
“The Blanktown Literary and Philo-
sophical Society ask me to lecture to
them at Blanktown. The man who
was coming is ill.”
“But why you particularly 2”
“One comes down to me in the
end,” I said modestly.
. “I expect it's because of my electric

“They ask me to name my fee.”
“Then say a thousand pounds, and
lecture on the need for more electric
light, Fancy if I got six per cent. ”
“This is a very sordid conversation,”
I said, “If I agree to lecture at all, it
will be simply because I feel that I
have a message to deliver . . . I will
now retire into the library and con-
sider what that message is to be.”
I placed the Encyclopædia handy
and sat down at my desk. I had
already grasped the fact that the title
of my discourse was the important
thing. In the list of the Society's
lectures sent to me there was hardly
one whose title did not impress the
imagination in advance. I must be
equally impressive . . .
After a little thought I began to
write.
“WASPS AND THEIR YouNG.
“Lecture delivered before the Blank-
town Literary and Philosophical Society,
Tuesday, December 8th.
“Ladies and Gentlemen--
“Well,” said Celia, drifting
“how's it going?”
I showed her how far I had got.
“I thought you always began, “My
Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,’”
she said.
“Only if the Lord Mayor's there."
“But how will you know?”
“Yes, that's rather awkward. I
shall have to ask the Secretary before-
hand.”
I began again.
“WASPS AND THEIR YouNg.
“Ilecture delivered, etc. . . .
“My Lord Mayor, my Lords, Ladies
and Gentlemen * x
It looked much better.
“What about Baronets?” said Celia.
“There's sure to be lots.”
“Yes, this is going to be difficult. I
shall have to have a long talk with the
Secretar . . How's this 2 – “My
Lord Mayor, Lords, Baronets, Ladies
and Gentlemen and Sundries.' That's

“That's all right. And I wanted to
ask you : Have you got any lantern

“They're not necessary.”
“But they're much more fun. Per-
haps they'll have some old ones of
Vesuvius you can work in. Well, good-
bye.” And she drifted out.
I went on thinking.
“No,” I said to myself, “I’m on the
wrong tack.” So I began again:-
“SoME Yorkshire Pot-Holes."
“Lecture delivered before the Blank-
tºwn Literary and Philosophical Society,
Tuesday, December 8th.
“My Lord Mayor, my Lords --

“I don't want to interrupt,” said
Celia coming in suddenly, “but oh,
what's a pot-hole?”
“A curious underground cavern
sometimes found in the North.”
“Aren't caverns always underground?
But you're busy. Will you be in for
lunch 2 ''
“I shall be writing my lecture all
day,” I said busily.
At lunch I decided to have a little
financial talk with Celia. -
“What I feel is this,” I said. “At
most I can ask ten guineas for my
lecture. Now my expenses all the way
to the North, with a night at an hotel,
will be at least five pounds.”
“Five-pounds-ten profit,” said Celia.
“Not bad.”
“Ah, but wait.

“Well, never mind. What I mean
is that I shall want some elocution
lessons. Say five, at a guinea each."
“That still leaves five shillings."

In an immense hall,
“If only it left that, it might be
worth it. But there's the new white

tired of a lecture, and then there's
nothing for the wakeful ones to con;

I lose thirty shillings by it. Can I

“But you gain the acoustics and the
waistcoat.” - * *
“True. Of course, if you insist—
“Oh, you must,” said Celia.
So I returned to the library. By
tea-time I had got as far as this:-

Cavalry Instructor. “FROM where DID You RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONs to DISMoUNT, SIR 2''
Raw Recruit. “FROM HIND QUARTERs, SIR.”
A SOLDIER'S SERVANT.
DEAR Mr. Punch,--I am only a dog,
but as you have a dog of your own
you will be able to sympathise with
me and understand my feelings. If
you don't, ask him and he will explain.
My master tells me he is going to a
place called The Front, and he seems
awfully pleased with the idea. But
my mistress is not pleased at all, though
she tries to smile and look happy when
he talks about it. All the same, I have
found her several times crying quietly
by herself, and have had to lick her
face thoroughly all over in order to
cheer her up.
At first, when my master told me he
was going to this mysterious place, I
simply barked and wagged my tail and
jumped about, because, of course, I
thought I was going there too, and it
doesn't matter to me where he goes
as long as I go with him. Imagine
therefore my feelings when it gradually
leaked out that I was to be left behind.
When the truth dawned upon me I
was so upset that I lay for a whole day
on the doorstep in a dazed condition,
whilst several cats who knew me well
came and washed themselves carefully
right under my nose. I hardly saw
them, though of course I couldn't help
smelling them.
You see, Mr. Punch, what made me
out something about The Front from
other dogs. It appears that it is a very
dangerous place, full of what they call
Germans, where he would need me to
look after him much more than he does
at home. Why then not take me? I
cannot understand it at all. I can
fight. Ask the dog at the house at the
corner of our road what he thinks, and
just take a look at his ears. They
speak for themselves.
Then, again, I can hear and smell a
great deal better than my master, and
could keep watch while he is asleep
(I am told he will have to sleep in a
ditch!), and after one or two sniffs and
bites I should soon learn to tell a
German.
In time of danger the place of every
English dog is by his master's side, and
he doesn't mind dying there either.
Can't you help us to get to The Front
with our masters?
Yours faithfully,
A VERY SAD. DoG.
P.S.—I enclose untouched one of the
most delicious bones I have ever smelt

the enemy were reported to be in full

chiefly owing to the speed at which
their movements were conducted, and
only amounted to one wounded, or said
to be. Two more were alleged to be
missing, but have probably by this time

Wood. The troops under my command

were drawn chiefly from the Old Fogey
Division. In addition to the House-

were two battalions of the 160th Lon-
don Potterers (the “Puff Hards"),
specially summoned from Pall Mall to
act with us. These battalions, under
the command of Colonel Bowindow,
D.S.O., fully maintained the noble
traditions that attach to their name.
There were also two regiments of un-
mounted cavalry, the 210th (Flannel
Feet) and the 306th Purple Lancers

WAR'S REVENGES.
(A True Story.)
THIS War has done many wonderful
things; -
It has altered our views of Kaisers and
Kings, t
And quite discounted the stern rebukes
Of those who anathematized Grand
Dukes. -
It has hurled from many alofty pinnacle
The self-sufficient and the cynical;
And revised the judgments we once
held true
In various ways that are strange and
new.
For instance, the other day there came
To see me, the same yet not the same,
A former office boy, whom once
I wholly misread as a Cockney dunce,
Who only cared for music-hall tunes—
And who went and 'listed in the
Dragoons.
His khaki was much the worse for wear,
Soiled and crumpled and needing repair,
And he hadn't unlearned since his office
days
His gruff laconic turn of phrase.
So I had to drag it out by degrees
That he hadn't been in the lap of ease,
But from Mons to Ypres, out at the
Front,
Had helped to bear the battle's brunt,
Rest? Well, they had to do without it;
But he didn't make a song about it.
Last three weeks he'd never been dry;
A sniper had shot him through the
thigh;
But his wound had healed, he was
right as rain -
And anxious to get to the Front again.
So there he stood, erect, serene,
Unshaken by all he had suffered and
seen, *
And ready once more at his Country's
call
To leave his wife, his home, his all.
And I, as I thought of what he had
done, w
And the arm-chair band (of which I
am one), -
Elderly scribblers, who can't even drill,
And are only good at driving a quill-
Humbled and shamed to my inmost
COre
I wished I could drop clean through
the floor.
For the tables were turned; I stood at
zero,
And the office boy was a full-blown
hero.

ANOTHER MISJUDGED ALIEN.
Clarence (who pulls the path roller)
says there's a Society for the Main-
tenance of Horses' Rights, I wish
there was one for the Abolition of
Eagles' Wrongs. I am an eagle, the
handsomest eagle in the Zoo, and I
sometimes wish I were a sparrow.
Moult me, but I've even wished I were
stuffed. And all because the authorities
won't change my label. It's true the
notice they've put on my cage telling
people to keep their children from the
bars has stopped the young brutes from
shooting me with peas and monkey
nuts, but it can't save my feelings, and
all because—but there! this is how my
own particular official label runs:–
IMPERIAL EAGLE.
SchooDERSTOGHARDTMEIsse N. DEPosited.
You can imagine the situation. How
in the firmament am I to tell the
public that Schodderstoghardtmeissen
is a craggy headland on the coast of
Norway, and not in the least associated
with Germany or Austria—places I
never heard of till but recently. But
ever since the men in khaki first made
their appearance in the Gardens some
four months ago a most extraordinary
undercurrent of opprobrious criticism
has crept into the public's conversation,
that public once so full of admiration
for my noble bearing—unless it saw
me walk; for which reason I don't
come off my pedestal in public hours if
I can help it. But now the mildest
visitors seem to hold themselves under
a moral obligation to connect me in
some manner with what Clarence calls
the “present crisis.”
Sixpenny days are my worst.
“There's the German eagle !" says the
crowd. I can't even sit in my water
trough without being told I'm “en-
trenching” myself.
Only last chicken's-neck day (we
dine alternately on poultry and—er—
the joint) an old lady paused before my
quarters and, her head on one side,
murmured musingly: “Yet I always
thought the Austrian eagle had two
heads, but perhaps I'm thinking of the
unicorn.” Half an hour later a party
stopped in front of me, and one of them
says: “Them Jermins didn't deserve
a nolle-looking bird like 'im to repre-
sent 'em, did they, Hemelie? Some-
thing with scales and bat's wings 'ud
be more appropriate, I don't think."
“Yes, an' a drunkard's liver,” chimes
in another, and then they all laughed.

[DECEMBER 2, 1914. -
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
TOMMY BROWN, AUCTIONEER.
Tommy Brown knows all about
India. You see his father served out
there, and that is how Tommy knows
so much. He says that everybody in
India has to have a bath once a year
in the Ganges, and that there is a delta
at the mouth of the Ganges as big as
Ireland.
Tommy says it is very hot in the
shade in India, but you needn't walk
in the shade unless you like. He
showed me how an idol looked—it is
like when you come to the castor oil
under the ginger wine.
But it is about the Indian troops
that I want to tell you. Tommy was
very pleased when they came, because
he knows all about them. He likes
the Gherkins best, he says, because
they are so hardy. , Tommy says the
Gherkins can hold their breath for five
minutes without going red in the face,
and that's why they can fight so well.
He says they never want anything
to eat, because they have a kind of a
twig that they chew, and then all they
have to do is to keep tightening their
belts. Tommy gave me some of the
twig they chew; it tasted like cabbage.
I didn't want anything more to eat all
that day. Tommy had some himself;
he says now he doesn't think it was
the right kind of twig. Tommy told
me that the Gherkins' mothers teach
them to prowl when they are very
young, and that they are always
prowling. Tommy showed me how to
prowl. You have to lie flat on your
stomach, and wriggle about as if you
were swimming. He says it makes
the Gherkins very hardy. They always
do it, Tommy says, even when they
have a half-holiday. To do it properly
you have to breathe through the back
of your throat and move your ears.
When the KING went to India,
Tommy says he was surprised at the
Gherkins. They used to prowl before
him, and he was very glad. He said
they were very hardy.
Tommy says they are very brave
because they don't know what fear is;
his father told him that. He says no
one has ever seen a Gherkin blub; if
they have to, they go and do it some-
where else.
There is only one way you can kill
them. Tommy knows the way, but
he daren't tell anyone.
Tommy says that when they want
to kill a man they prowl after him for
five miles, and then come back as
silently as they went. He says it is
no good shooting at them, because they
are not there.
He showed me how they killed
catch you round the neck, and it's no
good saying, “Shut up,” because they
don't understand English; then you
make a noise like gargling for sore
throats, and that's how they know you
are dead. It makes the people very
angry, Tommy says.
If they take a dislike to anyone, you
are sure to get killed, because they
prowl after you until they do. And
when you come to look at the dead
man, you can see he has died a horrible
death, and if you turn him over there
isn't a mark on him, You see he didn't
hear them coming. That's what
Tommy Brown told me.
Tommy says a Gherkin once saved
his father's liſe by killing a snake.
Tommy's father gave the Gherkin a lot
of money to put in his pocket, but he
wouldn't take it. The Gherkins don't
have pockets, Tommy says. -
Tommy says that if two Germans
stood back to back to see who was the
taller, a Gherkin could cut through
both of them with his two-handled
knife, and it would be done so quickly
that neither of the Germans would
know which was killed first. They do
it by practice, Tommy told me. They
always use two-handled knives, so that
when they are tired with using one
handle they can use the other.
You can never catch a Gherkin
because on the slightest movement in
the bushes they throw a rope up into
the air and climb up it, then they pull
the rope up after them.
Tommy says that Gherkins wear
turbots on their heads. He says that
they wear very few clothes, but they
don't catch rheumatism because it is
not known there.
When Tommy's mother told him
that people were sending presents to
the Indian troops we had a meeting
about it. We dug a deep trench in
Tommy's garden and held the meeting
there; Tommy didn't want the Germans
to know.
When we had dug the trench Tommy
stood at one end, and I had to come up
to him and give him the sign we had
arranged. You had to move your ears
and say “Gherkin,” then you were
admitted to the trench. It was because
of the German spies.
We decided to get money for the
Indian troops by selling Tommy's white
rats, and 1 was to lend Tommy my
Jew's harp for a week as my share.
Tommy sold the white rats in the
playground after school. He stood on
a box near the fence. The man who
lives next door thought Tommy was
going to climb over into his garden
after a ball, and he said to Tommy,
“My steemy friend, you stay where
Tommy took no notice because his
mother said the man had been to India
and brought back his liver and Tommy
wasn't to listen.
I bid fourpence for the two white
rats; we had arranged that in the trench,
Tommy Brown said with lots of scorn,
“Fourpence!!”—just like that. Then he
said the money was to go to buy things
for the Indian troops, and what would
they think of fourpence? Old Jones
minimus said sixpence when he got his
pocket-money on Saturday; then the
Head came out to see what the row
was about. When Tommy Brown told
him all about it, the Head bid half-a-
crown in a loud voice. We cheered,
and just then the man who lives next
door and who brought his liver home
from India shouted out five shillings,
Then the Headmaster said ten shillings,
Tommy Brown had to clutch hold of
the rails. The man who lives next
door went red in the neck and bid a
sovereign. Jones minimus began to
blub when the Head bid two pounds.
The man who had been to India
said: “My steemy Sir, it is no use; 1
bid four pounds.” I could see old
Tommy Brown moving his ears like
anything. The Headmaster said: “The
Gurkhas are some of the finest troops
in the world”—he meant Gherkins, but
he was excited; then he said: “Five
Pounds, Tommy White, for the brown
rats.” The man who likes liver said
something we haven't got to listen to,
and then Tommy fell off the box. . .
“Knocked down at six pounds!" said
the Headmaster, laughing; “we will
have one each. They both gave Tommy
Brown three pounds and then shook
hands over the fence. Tommy says I
needn't lend him my Jew's harp now.

A RASH ASSUMPTION.
ON the morning of November 27th
I awoke to find my chest covered with
a pretty pink pattern. It blended so
well with the colour of my pyjama-
jacket that for some minutes I was
lost in admiration of the pleasing effect.
Then it occurred to me that coming
diseases cast their rashes before them,
and I sprang from the bed in an agony
of apprehension. I rushed to the
mirror and opened my mouth to look
at my tongue. There it was... I took
some of it out. It looked quite healthy,
so I put it back again. Then I gazed
long and earnestly down my throat.
It was quite hollow as usual. Next I
got the clinical thermometer and sucked
it for quite a long time. When I
removed it I saw my temperature was
about 86. Then I found I was reading
it upside down and that I was only
normal. I felt disappointed. After that
I tried my pulse. It took me some
time to locate it, but it hadn't run
down; it was still going quite regularly
—andante ma non troppo, two beats in
the bar. I whistled “Tipperary” to it,
But still the rash remained. It
would neither get out nor get under.
I felt perfectly well, and yet I knew I
must be ill. I could not understand the
complete absence of other symptoms.
At last a bright idea struck me. It
was just possible that I might refuse
food. I knew that would be a symptom.
At any rate I would go down to break-
fast and see. I dressed rapidly; I
simply tore my clothes on to me.
I shaved hastily; I literally tore the
whiskers out of me. Then I tore down-
stairs.
On the table was an egg. I remayed
the lid and looked inside. It was full of
evil odours. I refused it. Then I knew
for certain I was ill. I tore back to
my bedroom and tore off my clothes.
I unshaved. I tumbled into bed and
tried hard to shiver. I tried so hard
that I perspired. As I was really ill
I knew that I had to get hot and cold
alternately ever so many times. I did
my best to live up to all the symptoms
I had ever heard of. I tried to get
delirious and talk nonsense, but I
failed ignominiously. How I cursed
my public school education
to imagine that I saw things which
were not there . . . .
And then I saw something which
really was there. It was my pin-
cushion. It looked unusually crowded
even for a pin-cushion, and I got out
of bed to investigate the matter closer.
I counted forty-five—yes, forty-five—
little flags, and then memory came
back to me. The previous day I had
bought forty-five miniature Belgian
flags at one time and another during
the day. Each charming but inex-
perienced vendor had insisted on
pinning my purchase wherever there
happened to be an unoccupied space
on my manly (thanks to my tailor)
bosom. I remembered being conscious
of a prickly sensation on each occasion,
but I attributed it to rapturous thrills
running about the region of my heart.
To make sure that my explanation
was correct I went once again to the
mirror and hastily counted my rash.
There were forty-five of it!

Somehow, when Grace's note

to me there, in faintly perfumed

the messengers), I was not in a

THE LAST LINE.
W.
At last! We are “recognised" by
the War Office! Our months of toil
are not to go unrewarded. Two hours
every evening at the end of an ordinary
civilian day's work, all Saturday after-
noon and the whole of Sunday, we
have given these up cheerfully, sup-
ported by the hope of ultimate recogni-
tion. And now it is come!
The terms of the War Office are
generous. They are these. Provided
that we buy our own rifles and equip-
ment and continue to pay our own
training expenses; provided that we
use no military terms and make no
attempt to wear any clothing which
may look to the Germans at all like a
soldier's uniform; provided that the
War Office is at perfect liberty to em-
ploy upon those of us within the age-
limits a conscription for whole-time
service which it has no intention of
employing upon the more patriotic man
who spends his week-ends playing golf;
these provisions complied with, we—
are allowed to go on living !
That startles you? I thought it
would. You looked down upon us.
Recognition, you told yourself, would
only mean that we were immediately
to be employed as waterproof sheeting
for the new huts or concrete founda-
tions for the new guns. Aha! Now
you wish you had joined us. We are
allowed to go on living !
But I was forgetting. The War
Office is being even more generous
than that. In return for our not
bothering them any more, it will allow
us to wear (and pay for) a small red
armlet with “G.R.” on it; the red
colour, I suppose, informing the Ger-
mans that we have just been vaccinated,
and the “G. R.” (“got rash ") warning
them that the left arm is irritable.
James is annoyed about it. This
is silly of him. As I point out, our
soldiers have already earned a reputa-
tion abroad for gaiety and high spirits,
and it is all to the good that the War
Office should show that it has a sense
of humour equally keen. When the
invasion conies, and music - halls,
cinemas and football matches are closed
down, the amusement of the country
as the War Office has foreseen) will
depend entirely upon us. Let us, then,
obey rigidly the seven commandments
of “recognition" and see how funny
we can be.

THE ENTENTE IN BEING.
WE were sitting in a little restau-
rant in the gay city—which is not a
gay city any more, but a city of dejec-
tion, a city that knows there is a war
going on and not so long since could
hear the guns. There are, however,
corners where, for the moment, con-
tentment or, at any rate, visitations of
mirth are possible, and this little res-
taurant is one of them. Well, we were
sitting there waiting for coffee, the
room (for it was late) now empty save
for the table behind me, where two
elderly French bourgeois and a middle-
aged woman were seated, when sud-
denly the occupant of the chair which
backed into mine and had been backing
into it so often during the evening that
I had punctuated my eating with com-
ments on other people's clumsy bulki-
mess; suddenly, as I say, this occupant,
turning completely round, forced his
face against mine and, cigarette in hand,
asked me for a light. I could see
nothing but face—a waste of plump

shoulders, a face garnished with grey
beard and moustache, and sparkling
moist eyes behind highly magnifying
spectacles. Very few teeth and no hair.
But the countenance as a whole radiated
benignance and enthusiasm; and one
thing, at any rate, was clear, and that
was that none of my resentment as to
the restlessness of the chair had been
telepathed.
Would I do him the honour of giving
him a light? he asked, the face so close
to mine that we were practically touch-
ing. I reached out for a match. Oh,
no, he said, not at all; he desired
the privilege of taking the light from
my cigarette, because I was an English-
man and it was an honour to meet me,
and — and “Vive l'Angleterre / "
This was all very strange and disturb-
ing to me; but we live in stirring times,
and nothing ever will be the same again.
So I gave him the light quite calmly
and with great presence of mind said,
“Vive la France 1” Then he grasped my
hand and thanked me for the presence
of the English army in his country, the
lessly to disclaim, and we all stood up
and bowed to each other severally and
collectively, and resumed our own lives
again.
But the incident had been so unex-
pected that I, at any rate, could not be
quite normal just yet, for I could not
understand why, out of four of us, all
English, and one a member of the
other sex, so magnetic to Frenchmen,
I should have been selected either as
the most typical or the most likely to
be cordial—I who only a week or so
ago was told reflectively by a student
of men, gazing steadfastly upon me,
that my destiny must be to be more
amused by other people than to amuse
them. Especially, too, as earlier in the
evening there had been two of our men
—real men—in khaki in the room. Yet
there it was: I, a dreary civilian, had
been carefully selected as the truest
representative of Angleterre and all its
bravery and chivalry, even to the risk
of dislocation of the perilously short
neck of the speaker.
It was therefore my turn to behave,

hand in his, which was

save Paris and la belle
France.
Down we all sat again,
and I whispered to our
party that perhaps this
was enough and we had
better creep away. But
there was more in store.
Before the bill could be
made out—never a very
swift matter at this house
—I caught sight of a
portent and knew the
worst. I saw a waiter
entering the room with
a tray on which was a
bottle of champagne and
seven glasses. My heart - -
sank, for if there is one thing 1
cannot do, it is to drink the sweet
champagne so dear to the bourgeois
palate. And after the old fine, not
before it ! To the French mind these
irregularities are nothing; but to me,
to us . .
There however it was, and, in a
moment, the genial enthusiast was
again on his feet. Would we not join
them, he asked, in drinking to the good
health and success of the Allies in a
glass of champagne? Of course we
would. We were all on our feet again,
all clinking glasses again, all crying

I reach my dim official den,
Placards designed to thrill and scare

A CHRISTMAS PRESENT IOR THE QUEEN.
A FEw days ago, when sitting in
matter of Christmas presents, Joan
and I made out that the extra taxes
disgorge this year would amount to
£3 16s. 1d.
“That's curious !” Joan remarked,
comparing our calculation with some
figures on another slip of paper before
her. “Isn't three pounds sixteen and
a penny half of seven pounds twelve
and twopence?”
“It is,” I admitted. “But why?"
“Because last year,” said Joan, “our
Christmas presents cost us exactly
seven pounds twelve and twopence.
In other words it means that we can
only afford–owing to the extra taxes
——to spend half that sum on presents
this year.”
I nodded.

“I don't mean anything of the sort,”
said Joan. “We shall give no half-
presents. We shall give one whole
present where it will be needed far
more than by our relations. It will
have a face-value of three pounds six-
teen and a penny, but virtually it will
represent a sum of seven pounds twelve
and twopence.”
I coughed a sceptic's cough.
“You don't believe me,” said Joan.
“Now, will you be content to give me,

“Absolutely ' " I replied with en-

“No,” said Joan gravely, “my prin-

“What is your principle 2 " I asked
as I meekly complied with her demand.
“What did Mr. Asquith say in

vouchsafed, so I decided to follow that
eminent statesman's advice and wait
and see.
When I came down to breakfast two
days later Joan passed me The Times.

receipt of Treasury notes and postal

When I looked up Joan was smiling
significantly.
“Very nice,” I commented, “but I

“And so I have,” said Joan. “He

THE TERRORS OF WAR.
[Being privileged extracts from two of
ºncet season's War Romances.]
From Pot-bank and Potsdam :—
Edwin Clayhanger strolled dully
down the Square. A squat dirty boy
shrieked: “Sentinel. Result of Bursley
Match. War News—Official.” I’dwin
snatched a pink paper and under an
anti-Zeppelin gas-lamp read that Knipe
had defeated Bursley Rovers by four
goals to none. He crumpled the paper
in his hand and threw it disgustedly
into the gutter, outside Bates the
cheesemonger's. Sam Bates emerged,
picked up the paper and confided to his
assistant that “Young Edwin’s brain
is going, like old Mr. Clayhanger's.”
Chill mists enveloped the pot-banks.
The glare of the Hanbridge furnaces
was subdued to a faint glimmer. The
shout of a laughing crowd outside the
Blood Tub drew Edwin closer. He
perceived in the midst of the throng an
elephant covered with Union Jacks.
On its back stood Denry Machin, the
famous Card of the Five Towns, thrice
Mayor of Bursley.
“Boys,” cried the Card, “you can
see the circus elephant free. … You
can listen to me free. Hanbridge is
going to raise a Pot-bank Company for
Kitchener's Army. They want us to
raise one to match it. We're going
one better. Bursley will raise a Pot-bank
Regiment. I just want a thousand
men to be going along with. Don't all
speak at once.”
The crowd shrieked with laughter at
Bursley's only humorist.
Edwin Clayhanger thought deeply.
For three years he had been waiting
to marry Hilda Lessways. Now the
thought of 528 pages of married life
with her overwhelmed him. Up went
his hand.
“Nine hundred and ninety-nine more
and off we march to Potsdam in the
morning.”
From The Military
Sherlock Holmes :—
I shrank down into a corner of the
reserve trench. The fifteen inches of
half-frozen mud caused my old wound
from an Afghan bullet to ache viciously.
I longed for some wounded to arrive—
anything to end this chilly inactivity.
A tall officer in staff uniform jumped
into the trench beside me.
“You are wishing yourself back in
Baker Street,” he remarked.
“How did you know?" I exclaimed.
“Why, Holmes, what are you doing
here 2 º'
“Business, my dear Watson, busi-
ness. Moriarty is becoming trouble-
some again.”
“But he was drowned.”
“Far too clever to be drowned in
that pool. Merely stranded on the
edge like myself. But I had made
England too hot for him. You can
guess his name.”
“Not the K– 1 ''
“Watson, Watson, Moriarty was my
mental equal. Now he calls himself
von Kluck.”
I was overwhelmed.
Just then a little group of the staff
arrived. I recognised amongst them
the figures of General J and Field-
Marshal F-, and saluted.
“The spy in staff uniform is the
Memoirs of

casually. -
The Field-Marshal beckoned a firing
party.
As the shots rang out I whispered,
“How did you know he wasn't

“Watson,Watson, did you not see that
he had no handkerchief in his sleeve 2"
“It is all-important, Captain Holmes,”
said the British Commander, “that we
should ascertain what army is opposing
our right wing. Our airmen are useless
in this fog. I detail you for this duty.”
Holmes saluted. “Come, Watson,”
he said, and led me through the fog
towards the enemy's lines. We had
not walked a mile when we reached a
fine chateau.
“You are cold, Watson,” said Holmes.
“Light a fire in the front room whilst
I scout for Uhlans.”
In a moment he returned to me after
having looked round the house. It was,
I think, the first time the Chateau had
known the scent of shag tobacco. A
glow of heat rushed through me... I felt
another man.
“Better than the trenches,” said
thought. We sat for an hour and then
I said, “Holmes, your mission.”
“Ah, I forgot. Come on.”
He led me into the thickening fog,
and in a few minutes I was surprised
to find myself in the British lines. The
General emerged as we approached.
Holmes saluted. “The CRowN PRINCE's
army is on the enemy's left, Sir. It is
now in rapid retreat.”
The General shook him warmly by
the hand.
“But, Holmes,” I said, as we went
away, “we have done nothing. The
lives of thousands of our men may de-
pend on this.”
“My dear Watson,” said Holmes,
tapping the dottel of his pipe into his
hand. “I used my eyes. In the house

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SEARCH FOR PADDINGTON.
I Do not say that the expedition I propose to describe
was accompanied by any very great risk. The streets, of
course, were dark and the taxis and motor-buses were
quite up to the usual average in number and well above it
in speed. Still, when your mind is full of stories of
shrapnel and Black Marias, you feel able to affront motor
vehicles, even in darkened streets, with a feeling of com-
parative security. It is not so much danger as mystery
that makes this story remarkable. -
There were two of us, and we found ourselves taking tea
in the N.W. district, that is to say in one of those parts
(there are millions of them) which lie about the Abbey
Road, One of us had knitted belts for soldiers; another
knew a hero who had received the D.S.O., and all of us
i had been brought into close connection with Belgian
| refugees whose cheerful courage under terrible suffering
formed the burden of our talk. Not to know a Belgian
in these days is a mark of social outlawry, and you cannot
know them without admiring them. The fire was warm,
the room was comfortable, and the minutes ticked them-
selves away in the usual place on the mantelpiece.
“How long,” said one of us, “will it take us to walk
from here to Paddington?” - - .
“To walk?" said our hostess in a tone of mild surprise.
“Yes,” I said, “to walk. We are the ones for adventure.
We are country folk, and we don't get a chance of a walk
in St. John's Wood every day.” -
“I don't want to hurry you," said our hostess, “but if
you really want to walk you must start at once.” -
We did. We went out, turned to the right, and plunged
head-first towards the brooding darkness of Maida Vale,
“Are you sure,” said my companion, “that you know
the way ?” -
“No,” I said, “I am not sure.

courage. We are bound to get there sooner or later.”
“Yes,” she said, “but we want to get there for the 5.50.”
“True,” I said. “We must limit our wanderings. I
will ask this gentleman. He is standing at a corner. He
has leisure and must know the way to Paddington.”
I approached the gentleman and addressed him. “Sir,"
I said, “can you tell me the best way to get to Pad-
dington 2" - - -
He looked at me suspiciously. “The station ?
“Yes,” I said, “Paddington station.”
“Are you going to walk 2"
I said we were. -
“Ah,” he said, “that makes a difference. If you wanted
a bus now I might help you; but I'm lame, you see—only

ago, and I don't do much hard walking myself. Still you
can't go far wrong if you take the first on the left.”
We tore ourselves away, took the first on the left and
walked on, ever on, through a wilderness of silent and un-
familiar houses. At last we came upon a baker's cart.
“Ask him,” said my fellow-traveller, pointing to the baker's
man. I asked him.
“Are we right,” I said, “for Paddington 2"
“Oh yes,” he said, “ you're right enough. You'll get
there in time, but you'll have to walk round the world first.

“Ask again,” said the other one. -
I addressed a gentleman who was hurrying over a bridge.
“Can you,” I said, “direct me to Paddington station?" |
He murmured something unintelligible and pointed to
his ears. - -
I repeated my question loudly and again he murmured.
At last I made out his words: “Stone deaf, stone deaſ."
“Great heavens,” I said, “all the infirmities of the world

sartorial extravagances had played their appointed part in
attracting notice. In manner of speech as in fashion of

position of a responsible statesman.
At last, after long struggle, he stood on safe ground.
But the fight was not over yet. The personal antipathy
and distrust with which he was regarded in Tory circles were
unabated. He had proved an invaluable auxiliary in the
battle against Free Trade; but having defeated PEEL the

FINANCIAL STRATEGY.
IN some respects one is no doubt compelled to admire
the foresight of those gentlemen who are writing the
History of the War while it is in progress, but as Mabel
(my wife and very able colleague) justly, observes, no
History of the War, however copious or however fully
illustrated, can be considered complete without a few
salient details of the campaign by which The Snookeries
(our domestic stronghold in Tooting) was saved from the
fate of Belgium. . . -
That omission I propose to remedy, Peace hath her
strategy no less than War. - --~~
For some time prior to the Declaration of War it was
evident that the butcher, the baker, and other foes of our
domestic happiness were gathering for an onslaught. The
attitude of the butcher was particularly uncompromising:
I do not hesitate to describe it as distinctly Hun-ish.
Diplomacy gave little hope of preserving peace, so that I
was not altogether surprised when the war opened with a
heavy bombardment. A brigade of small accounts advanced
in skirmishing order, but were disposed of without trouble.
Mabel suggested a temporary withdrawal to the sand-
dunes of , Mudville-on-Sea, but I pointed out that this
meant sacrificing part of our scanty store of ammunition
and had the further disadvantage of cutting us off from our
base of supplies in the City, to say nothing of losing touch
with Uncle Robert, who has so often proved a staunch ally
in a crisis. ---
We therefore resolved to entrench ourselves behind the
Moratorium and prepared for a stubborn resistance. From
this strong position we were able to sustain without loss a
brisk fire of explosive missives which continued unchecked
for some weeks. Speaking quite candidly, and dropping
the language of the Press Bureau for the moment, there
has never been a time when the postman's rat-tat has
occasioned me less emotion.
The defences of the Moratorium did not save us from
sundry annoying raids upon our supplies, the butcher being
peculiarly active in this kind of warfare. I repeat, the
hutcher is a true Hun and must be sternly dealt with after
the Peace. I was forced to silence him temporarily with a
few shots from my new one-pounders.
I would like to say what 2, valuable weapon the one-
pounder has proved in this campaign. It is wonderfully
mobile and saves the waste of heavier ammunition. My
only regret is that we were not armed with more of
for two tons of the best Wallsend.
Towards the end of August the rate-man and the gas.
man mounted heavy ordnance upon official heights. They
got our range to a nicety and threatened us in flank. I
despatched Mabel at once to Uncle Robert, and with his
assistance we were enabled to silence the enemy's
howitzers, not, however, before the rate-man—a remorseless
and persistent foe—had landed a “sheriff's officer” (as we
jocularly term his missiles) into our dining-room, Little
material damage was done, but for some days the effect
upon the moral of our forces was apparent.
I must not forget to speak of Mabel's brilliant victory
over the milkman, whose attack she frustrated by a threat
to open negotiations for obtaining supplies from his hated
rival. When these troubles are happily over I must cer.
tainly see that Mabel receives a decoration.
Towards the end of October our entrenchments behind
the Moratorium became untenable, but by that time we had
received substantial reinforcements and were easily able to
hold our own against the enemy's reckless frontal attacks.
The landlord suddenly unmasked a very strong battery
which created some consternation. He himself appeared
in force, but, thanks to the vigilance of my outposts, I was
enabled to make a strategic retirement by the back-garden
gate, leaving Mabel to foil the enemy by a ruse-de-guerre.
(Dear Mabel is wonderfully clever at these things.) I suc-
ceeded in regaining my position under cover of darkness.
The attacks of the landlord were renewed with such
vigour that I called a council of war to discuss the situa:
tion. Retreat being out of the question, Mabel suggested a
levy of our last reserves, and the charwoman (who is a
discreet person of considerable experience in such matters)
was mobilised. In this way we secured a sufficient force to
rout the landlord on his next appearance. -
The last few days have been comparatively quiet.

neutrality, and we have promise of further support, iſ
needed, from Uncle Robert. Thus, although the enemy

(From Mrs. JAMES ProssER, 25, Paradise Road, Brixton.)
KAISER,-Jim 's gone. I don't know if you'll like to
hear it, him being a good fighter. I'd warrant him to take
the shine out of any two Germans I ever met. They're
big men, the Germans, but they mostly run to fat after
their premmer jewness, as the Belgian lady over the way
said last week when we was a-talking about 'em. I don't
know what she meant, but she didn't look as if it was
anything in the way of a compliment. That's why I've
wrote it down here.
Anyhow, Jim's gone. I saw him off with a lot of others,
and they was all singing and shouting as loud as their
lungs would let 'em—not drink, mind you, so don't you run
away with that notion, but just high spirits and health
and happiness. First it was “Tipperary," and that made
me feel so mournful I had to give Jim a good old hug, and
the little un pulling at my dress all the time and calling
out, “Let me have a go at him, Mother,” and “Don't give
'em all to Mother, Dad; keep half-a-dozen for me,” just as
sensible as a Christian, which is more than you can say of
some. . His name's Henery, the full name, not Henry, and
we had him christened so, to make sure. He's going on
for five years now, and he's got a leg and a chest on him
to suit twice his years. I'm not saying that because I'm
his mother, but because it's the truth, Aſter they'd sung
“Tipperary” they sang a lot of other songs. There was
one in particklar that I liked, it had such a go with it.
Jim told me it was made up by one of their own men,
music and all. I misremember most of it, but there was
two lines stuck in my head:—
General FRENCH is a regular blazer,
There was a lot more about theirselves and their officers
and their colonel, who was second to none and was making

could make it. I couldn't help laughing to see 'em all so
jolly. Then the engine give a whistle and the guard said,
“Stand back,” and waved his green flag, and the train
moved out, and the men cheered and we cheered back, and
at last they was gone, and the little un was saying, “Don't
mind me, mother. Have a good cry and get it over;” and
then we went home, and he kept talking all the way of
what he's going to do when he grows up to be a soldier
himself.
Well, Jim's gone, but I wouldn't have had him stay at
home not for ever so much. He was earning good money,
too, in his job, but that's going to be kept open for him so
as he can drop into it again when he comes back. And
I'm going to keep his home open for him so as he can drop

HOME THOUGHTS FROM THE TRENCHES.
OLD mother mine, at times I find
Pauses when fighting's done
That make me lonesome and inclined
To think of those I left behind—
And most of all of one.
At home you're knitting woolly things—
They're meant for me for choice;
There's rain outside, the kettle sings
In sobs and frolics till it brings
Whispers that seem a voice.
Cheer up! I’m calling, far away;
And, wireless, you can hear.
Cheer up! you know you'd have me
stay
And keep on trying day by day;
We're winning, never fear.
Although to have me back's your
prayer—
I'm willing it should be—
You'd never breathe a word to spare
Yourself, and stop me playing fair;
You're braver far than me.
So let your dear face twist a smile
The way it used to do;
And keep on cheery all the while,
Rememb'ring hating's not your style—
Germans have mothers too.
And when the work is through, and

I'm coming home to find
The one who sent me out, ah! then
I'll make you (bless you) laugh again,

HIGH JINKS AT HAPPY-THOUGHT HALL.
[An inevitable article in any decent
magazine at this time of the year. Itead
it carefully, and then have an uproarious
time in your own little house.]
It was a merry party assembled at
Happy-Thought Hall for Christmas.
The Squire liked company, and the
friends whom he had asked down for
the festive season had all stayed at
Happy-Thought Hall before, and were
therefore well acquainted with each
other. No wonder, then, that the wit
flowed fast and furious, and that the
guests all agreed afterwards that they
had never spent such a jolly Christmas,
and that the best of all possible hosts
was Squire Tregarthen
But first we must introduce some of
the Squire's guests to our readers. The
Reverend Arthur Manley, a clever young
clergyman with a taste for gardening,
was talking in one corner to Miss
Phipps, a pretty girl of some twenty
summers. Captain Bolsover, a smart
cavalry officer, together with Professor
and Mrs. Smith-Smythe from Oxford,
formed a small party in another corner.
in deep conversation with the beautiful
Miss Holden, who, it was agreed
among the ladies of the party, was not
altogether indifferent to his fine figure
and remarkable prospects. There were
other guests, but as they chiefly
played the part of audience in the
events which followed their names will
not be of any special interest to our
readers, Suffice it to say that they
were all intelligent, well-dressed and
ready for any sort of fun.
(Now, thank heaven, we can begin.)
A burst of laughter from Captain
Bolsover attracted general attention,
and everybody turned in his direction.
“By Jove, Professor, that's good,”
he said, as he slapped his knee; “you
must tell the others that.”
“It was just a little incident that
happened to me to-day as I was coming
down here," said the Professor, as he
beamed round on the company. “I
happened to be rather late for my
train, and as I bought my ticket I
asked the clerk what time it was. He
replied, “If it takes six seconds for a
clock to strike six, how long will it
take to strike twelve 2' I said twelve
seconds, but it seems I was wrong.”
The others all said twelve seconds
too, but they were all wrong. Can you
guess the right answer?

When the laughter had died down,
the Reverend Arthur Manley said:
“That reminds me of an amusing
experience which occurred to my
housekeeper last Friday. She was
ordering a little fish for my lunch, and
the fishmonger, when asked the price
of herrings, replied, ‘Three ha'pence
for one and a-half,’ to which my house-
keeper said, “Then I will have twelve.”
How much did she pay ?” He smiled
happily at the company.
“One-and-sixpence, of course,” said
Miss Phipps.
“No, no; ninepence,” cried the
|Squire with a hearty laugh.
Captain Bolsover made it come to
fourpence. But once again they were all
wrong. What do you make it come to?

GENIOUS PROBLEM OF THE FISHMONGER.
It was now Captain Bolsover's turn
for an amusing puzzle, and the others
turned eagerly towards him.
“What was that one about a door?”
said the Squire. “You were telling
me when we were out shooting yester.
day, Bolsover.”
Captain Bolsover looked surprised.
“Ah, no, it was young Reggie Wor-
lock,” said the Squire with a hearty
laugh.
“Oh, do tell us, Squire,” said every-
body. ' -
“It was just a little riddle, my dear,”
said the Squire to Miss Phipps, always
a favourite of his. “When is a door
not a door?”
Miss Phipps said when it was a
cucumber; but she was wrong. So
were the others. See if you can be
more successful.
“Yes, that's very good,” said Cap-
tain Bolsover; “it reminds me of
something which occurred during the
Boer War.”
Everybody listened eagerly.
“We were just going into action,
and I happened to turn round to my
men, and say, ‘Now, then, boys, give
'em beans !' To my amusement one of
them replied smartly, ‘How many blue
beans make five?' We were all so
interested working it out that we
never got into action at all.”
“But that's easy,” said the Tro-
fessor. “Five.”
“Four,” said Miss Phipps.

“I met a man in a motor-'bus,” he
said in a quiet voice, “who told me

For a little while the company was
puzzled. Then, after deep thought, the
I’rofessor said:
“It depends on where they lived.”
“Yes,” said Ellison. “I forgot to
say that my acquaintance drew me a

pocket. “Here it is.”

The others immediately began to
puzzle over the answer, Miss Phipps
being unusually foolish, even for her.
It was some time before they discovered
the correct route. What do you think
it is ?
“Well,” said the Squire, with a
hearty laugh, “it’s time for bed.”
One by one they filed off, saying
what a delightful evening they had
had. Jack Ellison was particularly
emphatic, for the beautiful Miss Holden
had promised to be his wife. He, for
one, will never forget Christmas at
Happy-Thought Hall.

To the list of things that the Belgians
in Crashie Howe do not understand,
along with oatmeal, honey in the
comb, and tapioca, must now be added
the Scottish climate. They do not
complain, but they are puzzled, and
after sixty-five consecutive hours of
rain they wonder wistfully if it is
always like this. We simply dare not
tell them the truth.
By every post we are busy hunting
and Russia, not on December 25th, but
on December 6th. All our attempts to
explain this phenomenon by the differ-
ence in the Russian calendar, though ||
ingenious, have failed; it doesn't work
out at all. Still, for some reason, that
is how it is, and we cannot but be
grateful to St. Nicholas for this delicate
attention to our allies, by which no
doubt they get the pick of the toys,
of hay for the horse, along with your
shoes, or else he will simply pass on
and you will get nothing at all.
Having collected and considered all
these facts we were fully prepared to
meet the situation—even down to the
small gingerbread animals which al- ||
ways grace the day—on December 6th,

have not been very successful

best of all, we have unearthed
a great-grandmother, last seen
in an open coal boat off

said she. “This is no time for

At the next cottage, where we were

so much confidence that by the time we
reached our last visit we ran it up to

One of our main concerns has been
the Santa Claus question, and that is a
matter which touches us closely, as we

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A MARNE FOOTNOTE.
THERE was a battlefield, I was told,
with a ruined village near it, about as
far from Paris as Sevenoaks is from
London, and I decided to see it. The
preliminaries, they said, would be diffi-
cult, but only patience was needed—
patience and one's papers all in order.
It would be necessary to go to the War
Bureau, opposite the Invalides.
I went to the War Bureau opposite
the Invalides one afternoon. I rang
the bell and a smiling French soldier
opened the door. Within were long
passages, and other smiling French
soldiers in little knots guarding the
approaches, all very bureaucratic. The
head of the first knot referred me to
the second knot; the head of the second
referred me to a third. The head of
this knot, which guarded the approach
to the particular military mandarin
whom I needed or thought I needed,
smiled more than any of them, and,
having heard my story, said that that
was certainly the place to obtain leave.
But it was unwise and even impossible
to go by any other way than road, as
the railway was needed for soldiers and
munitions of war, and therefore I must
bring my chauffeur with me, with his
papers, which must be examined and
passed.
My chauffeur? I possessed no such
thing. Necessary then to provide
myself with a chauffeur at once. Out
I went in a fusillade of courtesies and
sought a chauffeur. I visited a taxi
| rank and stopped this man and that, but
all shied at the distance. At last one
said that his garage would provide me
with a car. So off to the garage we
went, and there I had an interview with
a manager, who declined to believe that
| permission for the expedition would be
made at all, except possibly to oblige a
| person of great importance. Was I a
person of great importance? he asked
me. Was I? I wondered. No, I
| thought not. Very well then, he con-
sidered it best to drop the project.
1 came away and hailed another taxi,
driven by a shaggy grey hearthrug. I
told him my difficulties, and he at once
offered to drive me anywhere and made
no bones about the distance whatever.
So it was arranged that he should come
for me on the morrow—say Tuesday, at
a quarter to eleven, and we would then
get through the preliminaries and my
lunch comfortably by noon and be off
| and away. So do hearthrugs talk with
foreigners—light-heartedly and confi-
dent. But Heaven disposes. For when
we reached the Bureau at a minute after
| eleven the next morning the smiling
ianitor told us we were too late. Too
i. at eleven 2 Yes, the office in ques-
tion was closed between eleven and
two ; we must return at two.
“But the day will be over,” I said;
“the light will have gone. Another
day lost l” Nothing on earth can crys-
tallize and solidify so swiftly and im-
placably as the French official face. At
these words his smile vanished. He
was not angry or threatening—merely
granite. Those were the rules, and how
could anyone question them 2 At two,
he repeated; and again I left the build-
ing, this time not bowing quite so
effusively, but suppressing a thousand
criticisms which might have been
spoken were not the French our allies.
Three hours to kill in a city where
everything is shut. No Louvre, no
Carnavalet ! However, the time went,
chiefly over lunch, and at two we were
there again, the hearthrug and I, and
were shown into a waiting-room where
far too many other persons had already
assembled. To me this congestion
seemed deplorable; but the hearthrug
merely grinned. It was all a new ex-
perience to him, and his meter was regis-
tering the time. We waited, I suppose,
forty minutes and then came our turn,
and we were led to a little room where
sat a typical elderly French officer
at a table. He had white moustaches
and was in uniform with blue and red
about it. I bowed, he bowed, the
hearthrug grovelled. I explained my
need, and he replied instantly that I
had come to the wrong place; the right
place was the Conciergerie.
Another rebuff In England I might
have told him that it was one of his
own idiotic men who had told me other-
wise, but of what use would that be in
France? In France a thing is or is
not, and there is no getting round it if
it is not. French officials are port-
cullises, and they drop as suddenly and
as effectively. Knowing this, so far
from showing resentment or irritation,
I bowed and made my thanks as though
I had come for no other purpose than
a dose of frustration; and again we
left this cursed Bureau.
I re-entered the taxi, which, judging
by the meter, I should very soon have
completely paid for, and we hurtled
away (for the hearthrug was a demon
driver) to Paris's Scotland Yard. Here
were more passages, more little rooms,
more inflexible officials. I had bowed
to half-a-dozen and explained my
errand before at last the right one
was reached, and him the hearthrug
grovelled to again and called “Mon
Colonel.” He sat at a table in a little
room, and beside him, all on the same
side of the table, sat three civilians.
On the wall behind was a map of
France. . What they did all day, I
wondered, and how much they were
paid for it; for we were the only clients,
and the suggestion of the place was
one of anecdotage and persiflage rather
than toil. They acted with the utmost
unanimity. First “Mon Colonel" scru-
tinised my passport, and then the
others, in turn, scrutinised it. What
did I want to go to for 2 (The
name is suppressed because it is two
or three months since the battle was
fought there.) I replied that my motive
was pure curiosity. Did I know it was
a very dull town? I wanted to see
the battlefield. That would be triste
too. . Yes, I knew, but I was interested.
“Mon Colonel” shrugged and wrote on
a piece of paper and passed the paper to
the first civilian, who wrote something
else and passed it on, and finally the
last one got it and discovered a mistake
in the second civilian's writing, and
the mistake had to be initialled by all
the lot, each making great play with a
blotte, and at last the precious docu-
ment was handed to me and I was

The road from leaves the town
by a hill, crosses a canal, and then
mounts and winds, and mounts again,
and dips and mounts, between fields of
stubble, with circular straw-stacks as
their only occupants. The first intima-
tion ol anything untoward, besides the
want of life, was the spire of the little
white village of — on the distant
hill, which surely had been damaged.
As one drew nearer it was clear that
not only had the spire been damaged
but that the houses had been damaged
too. The place seemed empty and
under a ban. -
I stopped the car outside, at the
remains of a burned shed, and walked
along the desolate main street. All
the windows were broken; the walls
were indented with little holes or perſo-
rated with big ones. The roofs were
in ruins. Here was the post-office; it
is now half demolished and boarded

AT THE PLAY.
“THE MAN WHO STAYED AT HOME.”
No, he was not a shirker, as you
thought. Nor was he engaged in
making munitions of war, or khaki,
or woollens, or military boots, or in ex-
porting cocoa to the enemy viſi neutral
Holland—that roaring monopoly of the
Pacificist. His business was to spy at
spies—a task that called for as much
coolness and courage as any job at the
Front. And so when the officious
flapper presented him with a white
feather he had no use for it except as
a pipe-cleaner.
For his purpose Christopher Brent
had taken up his residence at a “select
boarding establishment” on the East
Coast, which contained the following
members of the German Secret Service:
Mrs. Sanderson, proprietress; Carl, her
son, clerk in the British Admiralty;
Fräulein Schroeder, boarder, and Fritz,
waiter. Their design, if I rightly pene-
trated its darkness, was to give informa-
tion of the whereabouts of a certain
section of the IExpeditionary Force
which was “coming through from the
North "; to supply Berlin with plans
of the coast defences; and finally to
give a signal to a German submarine
by the firing of the house, which would
incidentally mean the roasting alive of
its innocent contents. All this (for the
sake of ARISTOTLE and the Unities) was
to take place in a single day, though I
for one could not believe that either the
pigeon post or the ordinary mail would
be equal to the strain.
Their utensils included a Marconi
instrument concealed in the chimney;
a bomb; a revolver; maps of the mine-
field and harbour; a carrier-pigeon, and
a knife for disposing of the cliff-sentry.
To frustrate their schemes something
more was needed than the wit of Brent
and his ally, the widow Leigh; some-
thing more, even, than his skill in
shooting pigeons in flight with an air-
rifle. The vacuum was supplied by
the crass stupidity of the EMPERoR's
minions. Even when full credit is
given to Brent for letting his bath
overflow so as to flood the public salon
and render it untenable, it was surely
unwise of Mrs. Sanderson to offer her
private parlour for the use of the
boarders on the very day set apart for
the execution of her plans which were
centred in this room. It was also gross
carelessness on the part of her son,
when he had Brent, with hands up, at
his mercy, to place his own revolver on
the table and to use, in exchange, the
unloaded weapon which he had taken
from his opponent's pocket. It was
puerile, too, to accept without proof
Leigh that she was one of themselves,
a loyal German spy. And Fritz com-
mitted an unpardonable error in giving
away the site of the Marconi apparatus
by his undisguised suspicion of any-
body who took any interest in the
fireplace.
And so their schemes all went agley;
the whole pack was arrested; and when
the curtain fell on a happy group of
boarders in midnight déshabille there
was every promise that the misde-
meanants would receive a month's im-
prisonment or at least a caution to be
of good behaviour for the future.

this juncture of the War is to demand

here. For, though the subject deals
with a serious problem of the hour, it
can be treated, and is treated, with
a very permissible humour that just
stops short of farce. Some of the
stage-devices, as I am assured by my
betters, may have a touch of antiquity,
but their application is as modern as
can well be, and I should indeed be
ungrateful if after an entertainment so
smoothly and dexterously administered
I were to be captious about origins or
other matters of pedantry.
Mr. DENNIs EADIE, as Brent, both in
his real character of detective and in
the assumed futility of his disguise as
a genial idiot, was equally excellent,
and again proved his gift for quick-
change artistry. Miss MARY JERRorld's
Fräulein Schroeder was extraordinarily
Teutonic in all but her quiet humour,
which she seemed to have caught from
the country of her adoption. The
Fritz of Mr. HENRY Edwards was
another delightful sketch, though his
of Dutch nationality were both belied
by the red Italian corpuscles with
which the authors had inoculated him.
Miss JEAN CADELL, as usual, played a
pale and fatuous spinster, but this time,
in the part of Miss Myrtle, she had her
chance, and seized it bravely. When
that typical British boarder, Mr. John
Preston, M.P. (interpreted with great
relish and vigour by Mr. HUBERT
HARBEN), remarked, “I call a spade a
spade,” she replied, “And I suppose
you would call a dinner - napkin a
servielle”—one of the pleasantest re-
marks in a play where the good things
said were many and unforced.
I have not mentioned the admirable
performance—its merits might easily
be missed — of Mr. STANLEY LOGAN
as a Territorial Tommy; or the very
natural manners of Mrs. RoBERT
BRough as Mrs. Sanderson; or , the
quiet art of Miss RUTH MACKAY in a
part (Miriam Leigh) that offered a too-
limited scope to her exceptional talents.
Miss Isobel, ELsoM contributed her
share of the rather perfunctory love-
interest with a very pretty sincerity;
and Mr. MALcol ºf CHERRY, in the
ungrateful part of the spy Carl, did his
work soundly, with a loſty sacrifice of
his own obvious good-nature. Indeed,
it was a very excellent cast.
I should like to congratulate the
authors, Messrs. LECHMERE Worrain
and HARold TERRY, on having given
the public what they want, without
lapsing into banality. The attraction
of the first two Acts was not, perhaps,
fully sustained in the third, but they
ave us quite a cheerful evening; and
at the faſt of the curtain the audience
was so importunate in their applause
that Mr. DENNIs EADIE had to break
it to them that, though the loss of
their company would give him pain,
he thought the time had come for
them to go away.

If The Prussian Officer, a study of morbidly vicious

times of peace, and I remember it (as I remember others
of the collection) with a freshness which only attaches to
work that lifts itself out of the common ruck. An almost
too poignant intensity of realism, expressed in a distin-
guished and fastidious idiom, characterises Mr. LAwrence's
method. It is a realism not of minutely recorded outward
happenings, trivial or exciting, but of fiercely contested
agonies of the spirit. None of these stories is a story in

Llanyglo was a child with fair hair and blue eyes, and
how she grew and what she learnt, and all the changes of
her dresses and her soul, are set forth by Mr. OLIVER
ONIONs in Mushroom Town (HopDER AND SToughton).
She differed from the children of other novelists who grow
up to be men and women, because she was made of bricks
and mortar and iron girders and romantic scenery and
ozone (especially ozone), and the people who lived with
her or took trips to see her are treated as a mere emble-
matical garnish of her character and growth. Llamyglo is

was all the time quietly fighting her visitor for her son's

makes it, are the best things in the book. I shall not tell
you who wins. Personally I had expected a comedy climax,
and was unprepared for creeps. But George, I may remind
you, collected snakes. A good and virile tale.

breast of Mr. H. A. VACHELL, who has written a book
about it. The Spragges of the tale are Mrs. Spragge,
widow of the pioneer, and her son George. With them on
the ranch lived also a cousin, Samantha, a big-built capable
young woman, destined by Providence and Mrs. Spragge
to be the helpmate of George. But George, though he was
strong and handsome and a perfect marvel with rattle-
snakes (which he collected as a subsidiary source of
income), was also a bit of a fool; and when, on one of his

No. XI. -
(From the GERMAN CRowN PRINCE.)
Most INTERNALLY (INNIGST) BELovED FATHER,-Here in
my headquarters we learnt with sorrow that you have been
suffering from a bronchial catarrh. Anxious as we were at
first, our minds were relieved when we heard that you had
behaved very violently to those about you, for in that we
recognised our good old father as we knew him from long
since, and we said to ourselves that you could not fail soon
to be in the saddle again with all your accustomed energy.
And now comes the report that you are indeed yourself
again, like Richard III, in our great German, SHAKSPEARE.
Now that all danger is past I cannot forbear giving you
from my heart a word of warning, begging you not with
rashness to risk your so valuable life. Do not laugh and
imagine that I am pulling your leg (dass ich Dir das Bein
ziehe). Nothing is further from my thoughts; I am quite
serious. You must remember that you are not so young as
you were and that this rushing to and fro between France
and Poland, which to a man of my age would be a mere
trifle, bringing with it only enjoyment, must be for a man
who is between fifty and sixty a task well calculated to
| search out and expose his corporeally weak points so as to
bring satisfaction, not to us, but to the enemy. Such a
burden must no longer be placed only upon your back, for
there are others whose bones are young and who are
willing to share it with you. Why should we be compelled
to sit still or merely to beat our back with fists while you,
dear Father, undergo these too terrible fatigues? I myself,
for instance, if I may say so with the most humble respect,
am ready to represent you in all departments whenever you

I was sitting grimly in my sentry-

the War from their publishers, and
there had been one or two suggestive

of the moment was, “How can we

England wanted in the event of an

the trench. When he said man he
meant an adult male of the human

which bullets were discharged by an
explosion of gunpowder. A trench, he

THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.
I was sitting in front of the fire—
dozing, I daresay — when he was
announced.
“Father Christmas.”
He came in awkwardly and shook
me by the hand.
“Forgive my unceremonious entry,”
he said. “I know I ought to have
come down the chimney, but—well,
you understand.”
“Things are different this year,” I
suggested. -
“Very different,” he said gloomily.
He put his sack down and took a seat
on the other side of the fire-place.
“Anything for me?” I wondered,
with an eye on the sack between us.
“Ah, there’s no difference there,” he
said, brightening up as he drew out a
big flat parcel. “The blotter from Aunt
Emily. You needn't open it now; it's
exactly the same as last year's.”
I had been prepared for it. I took a
letter from my pocket and dropped it
in the sack.
“My letter of thanks for it,” I ex-
plained. “Exactly the same as last
year's too.”
Father Christmas sighed and gazed
into the fire.
“All the same,” he said at last,
“it’s different, even with your Aunt
Emily.”

I protested.
“I don’t think so.”
“An ordinary printed card with
robins and snow and so forth on it.
And it says”—his voice trembled with
indignation—“it says, “Wishing you
a very happy Censored, Sir
Censored, at my time of life. There's
your War Office again.”
“I think that's a joke of the pub-
lisher's,” I said soothingly.
“Oh, if it's humour, I don't mind.
Nobody is more partial to mirth and
jollity than I am.” He began to
chuckle to himself. “There's my joke
about the “rain, dear'; I don't know if
you know that 2"
I said I didn't ; he wanted cheering
up. But though he was happy while
he was telling it to me he soon became
depressed again.
“Look here,” I said sternly, “this is
absurd of you. Christmas is chiefly a
children's festival. Grown-ups won't
give each other so many presents this
year, but we shall still remember the
children, and we shall give you plenty
to do seeing after them. Why,” I went
on boastfully, “you've got four of my
presents in there at this moment.
The book for Margery, and the box
of soldiers, and the Jumping Tiger
and—”
Father Christmas held up his hand
and stopped me.
“It's no good,” he said, “you can't
deceive me. After a good many years
at the business I'm rather sensitive to
impressions.” . He wagged a finger at
me. “Now then, uncle. Was your
whole heart in it when you bought
| that box of soldiers, or did you do it
with an effort, telling yourself that the
children mustn't be forgotten — and
knowing quite well that you had for-
gotten them?”
“One has a-a good deal to think
about just now,” I said uneasily.
“Oh, I'm not blaming you; every-
body's the same; but it makes it much
less jolly for me, that's all. You see,
I can't help knowing. Why, even your
Aunt Emily, when she bought you that
delightful blotter . . . which you have
our foot on . . . even she bought it
in a different way from last year's.
Last year she gave a lot of happy
thought to it, and decided in the
middle of the night that a blotter was
the one thing you wanted. This year
she said, ‘I suppose he'd better have
his usual blotter, or he'll think I’ve
forgotten him.' Kind of her, of course
(as, no doubt, you've said in your
letter), but not the jolly Christmas
spirit.”
“I suppose not,” I said.
Father Christmas sighed again and
ot up.
Perhaps next year they'll want me
again. Good-bye.”
“Good-bye. You're quite sure there's
nothing else for me?”
“Quite sure,” he said, glancing into
his bag. “Hallo, what's this?” t
He drew out a letter. It had
O.H.M.S. on it, and was addressed to
“Father Christmas.”
“For me? Fancy my not seeing that '.
before. Whatever can it be 2 ” He fixed
his spectacles again and began to read.
“A commission, perhaps," I said
humorously. - |
“It is a commission " " he cried
cxcitedly. “To go to the Front and
deliver Christmas presents to the
troops! They've got hundreds of .
thousands all ready for them " -
“And given in what spirit?” I |
smiled. -
“Ah, my boy! No doubt about the
spirit of that.” He slung his sack ||
on to his shoulder and faced me —
his old jolly self again. “This will ||
be something like. I suppose I shall
have the reindeer again for this. Did
I ever tell you the joke — ah! so I did,
so I did. Well, good night to you."
He hurried out of the room chuckling
to himself. I sat down in front of the .
fire again, but in a moment he was |
back. -
“Just thought of something very |

back and tell you. The troops—hee ||
hee-hee—won't have any stockings to ||
hang up, so—ha-ha-ha-they'll have ||
to hang up their puttees | Ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!”
He passed through the door again,
and his laughter came rolling down
the passage. A. A. M.

papers; you're a wallower, that's what
you are.”
“I'm afraid,” I said, “you also con-
sider yourself a bit of a superman.”
“I admit,” he said, “that I've gone
a long way.” -
“Towards Tipperary 2”
“Beyond you,” he said, tapping the
page of NIETzsche he was reading;
"we're not on the same plane.”
“You can always get out and
change,” I said. -
“Such flippancy,” said Arthur, “is
unbecoming in a lance corporal. What
you want is a course of philosophy.”
“What you want,” I said, “is a
course of musketry.” Arthur, who, like
me, is rising forty-six, is sound enough
for home defence, but isn't in any Force
yet. So, being a lance corporal in the
“ United Arts” myself, I feel I can
throw advice of this sort at him freely.
“I’m going to give you a mental
prescription,” he said, taking out a
pencil and scribbling on an envelope.
* Have you read this—LUpovici's Who
is to be Master of the World?"
“No, I haven't,” I said; “but I can
“The Japanese,” said Arthur, “think
a lot of it.”
“I've got a pal,” I said, “who'd
dearly enjoy a few rounds of mental
jiu-jitsu with you. He's got rather
advanced ideas.”
“Advanced " said Arthur contemp-
tuously. “We Nietzscheans speak only
of being ‘complete' or “nearer comple-
tion.'”
It was at this point that Alfred joined
in. He was sitting in uniform on the
other side of the fire, reading Ruff's
Guide.
“Who's that talking about poor old
LUDov ICI ?” he asked.
For a moment I was afraid Alfred
thought that LUDovIci was a horse.
“I was recommending him to this
shining light of the Burlington House
brigade,” said Arthur.
Alfred laughed, “Look here, young
fellow,” he said, “everybody knows that
he (pointing to me) is an antediluvian;
but you've gone a bit off the boil your-
self, haven't you?”
“What do you mean?” said Arthur,
looking rather pained.
“Many Continental theories,” said
Alfred, “when they die, go to Oxford.
| morning, and we shan't meet again till
theory has been sent down even from
there. Have you read Barrow's Fallacy
of the Nietzschean doctrine?”
“N-no,” said Arthur.
“Or Erichsen's Completion of Self?
You can get the paper edition for
a bob.” -
“I'm sorry to say I haven't," said
Arthur, who looked sadly chap-fallen,
“But I will. However, for the moment
I've got a meeting on—our literary
club, you know.”
“I'm coming round to raid you one
night,” I said, “to see if you're all
registered.”
For reply Arthur slammed the door
behind him. -
“Alfred,” I said, when Arthur had
left the house, “you astound me. Who
are these new friends and their philoso:
phies, Barrow and the Danish fellow,
what's his name?"
“Mere inventions,” said Alfred, “but
they served.” -
“Then the fat's in the fire," I said;
“he'll find out that you've been pulling
his leg before lunch-time to-morrow;
“That's all right,” said Alfred. “Our
lot's booked for Pirbright to-morrº.

SANTA CLAUS AT THE FRONT.
SEASONABLE GIFTs for OFFICERs.
By Aunt PARKER.
As Christmas draws nearer, the pro-
blem of what gifts to send to our brave
men at the Front becomes more acute.
For of course they must all have pre-
sents, no matter what decision is come
to as to the manner of spending the
dear old festival at home.
As an aid to the generous there is
nothing like a walk down Bongent
Street, where will be found many in-
genious novelties designed especially
for the mirthful anniversary which
will so soon be on us with all its
associations of peace and goodwill to
men.
It is no part of my duty to recom-
but for those who cannot knit, Messrs.
Tyke and Taylor have a most attractive
show of all the woollen articles with
which it has been decreed that our
warriors shall cover their bodies. Their
ten-guinea Campaign Abdominal Belt
could not be improved upon, little
strands of real gold thread being
woven into the ordinary fabric. I
foretell an enormous sale for this
fascinating article, and also for the
Service Muffler at seven guineas,
which has real gold tassels at each
end.
Messrs. Cartersons are concentrat-
ing their energies on letter-paper for
the Front. In a compact and very
tasteful morocco case is a sufficient
supply of paper, envelopes and blotting-
paper for a considerable correspond-
mend shops and their wares,
but it is a pleasure to put on
record some of the things on
which my roving eyes settled
as I traversed London's most
| luxurious thoroughfare.
Every taste is there con-
sidered, but for the moment
my interest is solely in gifts
for our brave officers—and
| privates too, if they have
wealthy enough friends,
At Messrs. Baskerville's,
for example, I perceived a
host of captivating articles
calculated to make glad the
heart of any fighting man.
In one window was a Service
Smoker's Companion which
cannot be too highly extolled,
especially as this War is, as
everyone knows, being waged
very largely on the beneficent

where, the first thought has been for
our brave soldiers at the Front, and
particularly the gallant officers. Wrist
watches of every shape are to be seen,
each thoughtfully provided with its
strap—for Mr. Jones forgets nothing.
In addition to wrist watches are wrist
compasses for the other arm, and for
the ankles a speedometer and barometer.
Thus fitted, the officer knows practically
all that can be learned. I need not
say that all are in gold; but a few
special sets in radium can be obtained.
Even these, however, are not ruinous,
for with Mr. Luke Jones reasonable
prices are a fetish.
The full assurance of securing the best
possible value at the lowest possible
price adds yet another reason for visit-
ing the charming premises of Messrs.
T Slimmer and Bang. Their
Service knick-knacks cannot
be overpraised. Glancing
hastily around, I noticed
|sºl with devices all cal-
|culated not only to be useful
but to amuse at the Front,
wherever our stalwart re-
presentatives are gathered.
| One of the most practical
is a boot-cleaning set in
strong pigskin with gold
clasps, including, very in-
geniously, a bottle of patent-
leather reviver. Another pig-
skin, indispensable at the
Front, holds a complete tea-
set. It resembles the old tea-
basket, but weighs at least
five ounces less (no small

told) and is more compact.
| With such a gift as this,
Indian weed. The equipment consists
of four delightful gold-mounted pipes,
each guaranteed to be made of briar
over eighty years old; a gold-mounted
pencil; a gold cigar-case and fifty
cigars; a gold cigarette - case and
1,000 cigarettes; a gold cigar-cutter;
a gold mechanical lighter; a gold and
amber cigar-holder; a gold and amber
cigarette-holder; a smoker's knife and
two gold ash-trays—the whole neatly
packed in a leather case and weighing
only nine pounds. No soldier—at any
rate, no officer—should be without it.
Cheered by its presence he would fight
twice as well, and any horrid old pipe
that he might possess and, however
tired of it, be forced still to Smoke for
want of a new one, he would be able to
give to a Tommy. The same set is
obtainable in silver at a lower cost; but
my advice to everyone is to take the
gold one.
Many of our brave fellows are sup-
plied with helmets, belts, and mufflers
ence. A gold ink-pot, a gold pen and
a gold pencil are also included, together
with sealing-wax and nibs, and a very
clever little rubber-stamp with the
words, “Somewhere at the Front.” A
writing pad for the knee when in action
completes this timely budget. Those
interesting letters from officers and
men, which now form so popular a
section of each paper, are likely soon
to be noticeably increased in numbers.
Fortunate indeed is the man who gets
one of Messrs. Cartersons' Front
Correspondence Companions ! The
total weight is only a little over two
pounds, which is, of course, nothing.
In another of Cartersons' windows
I noticed a very delightſul Field Tan-
talus, which can easily be attached to
a shoulder-strap or, better still, be
carried by an orderly. -

Luke Jones' establishment is crossed,

An admirably suitable present for
this year is a
WAR MAP.
Those we offer are calculated to be
particularly popular, the little Imperial
flags not being detachable but painted
on to the map — at Paris, London,
Petersburg, etc. Thus, whatever may
be happening in the field, you may con-
tinue cheerful.

As many of our most exalted cus-

goods, considering them too crude and
glaring in their effect, we have preparcd,
with the help of our Ambassador at

various shapes—the Kaiser mirror, the

THE town of Bonn, in Rhenish
Prussia, which has recently been in
evidence owing to the enterprise of
French aviators, is the seat of a uni-
versity, of an Old Catholic bishopric
and a school of agriculture. But it owes
its chief title to fame to the fact that it
was the birthplace of BEETHoveN, the
eminent composer. BEETHoveN was a
man of a serious character, but thanks
to the genius of Sir HERBERT BEERBoHM

symphonist in one of his notable pro-

TOO MUCH NOTICE.

season-ticket had expired painlessly
the previous day, and twice already
that morning I had had to satisfy the
curiosity of the railway officials as to
ºny, name, and address. Although I
had explained to them that I was on
half-salary and promised to renew
business relations with the company
as soon as the War was over or Uncle
Peter died—whichever event happened
first—they simply would not listen to
me, and hence my decision to adopt
some other means of transport. I Sig-
nalled to a bus to stop, and, as the
driver, seeing my signal, at once put on
his top speed, I just managed to fling
myself on to the spring-board as the
vehicle tore past.
I ran up to the first
storey, and sat down in
the front seat. Then
I took out my cigarette-

light a cigarette when a
printed notice caught

became absorbed by a notice headed
BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS.
I had just reached the exciting part
when two girls arrived on the landing.
“There aren't two together; we shall
have to divide,” I heard one say.
.." Excuse me,” I said, rising. “Don’t
divide. I'll get into a single seat if
you care to take this double one.”
I was rewarded with the now almost
obsolete formula of “Thank you,” and
moved a seat further back. Here I
found some fresh reading material
provided for me in the shape of a notice

self with looking round to see if there
was a rear seat vacant: 'There wasn't.
A cluster of happy, smoking faces con-
fronted me. I turned round again, and

“ Cheer-o, Bert 1" said a refined voice
|just behind my car, and at the same
moment a walking - stick playfully
tapped the head of the young fellow
sitting next me. My neighbour faced
| about, kicked me on the shin, dug the
point of his umbrella into my calf,
knocked off my pince-nez with his
newspaper, and spread himself over
the back of the seat.
“'Allo, Alf ' " he said. “Thought
it must've been you. Look 'ere, I
want to see you—"
“Perhaps,” I. interrupted, “your
friend would like to change places with
me. Then you can scrutinise him at
your ease—and mine."
“You’re a sport," remarked Bert.
He spoke truly. Little did he guess
he was addressing a Double-Blue—
the utmost depth I again turned round
to see if there was a vacant seat among
the smokers. To my joy I saw one.
Quickly I rose and hastened to secure
it, but at the same moment the bus
turned a sharp corner and I sustained
a violent blow on the back of my head
which left me half-stunned.
The conductor, who had just ap-
peared on deck to collect fares, helped
me to my feet. Then he rounded

“Why don't you read the notices?"
he said by way of peroration. “Then
it wouldn't 've 'appened.”
“The notices?” I repeated, handing
him my fare. “I've done nothing else

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM sorry that I cannot now be the first to call King
Albert's Book (Hodder AND StoughTon) The Golden Book.
But, since this term has already been applied, I can only
applaud it. I suppose never in the history of books has
such an one as this been put together, just as never in the
line of kings has monarch received, under such circum-
stances, so rare a tribute. If in the Belgian heart, from
ruler to refugee, there is room for more pride than should
of right be there already, surely these pages, voicing the
homage of all that counts in the world to-day, will bring it.
We are all KING ALBERT's men now, and in this book we
have a welcome chance of proving our fealty. You will
observe that I say nothing about the volume as commercial
value for the three shillings that it costs to buy. One glance
* the list of those who contribute (a kind of international
supplement to Who's Who) is all that is needed to satisfy you
on this point. The Daily Telegraph is primarily responsi-
ble for gathering together a greater assembly of the names
that matter than was ever collected between covers. To the
proprietors, to Mr. HALL CAINE, who edits the book, and to
he printers (especially for the illustrations in colour, which
are triumphs of reproduction) I can only offer my thanks
and congratulatory good wishes. Certainly, The Daily
Telegraph Belgian Fund, to which will go the entire pro-
ceeds of the sale, deserves well the shillings that this
splendid effort will bring to it. King Albert's Book is

read) how I should love to see the Berlin Press notices !
When Mr. THEoDoRE Roosevelt stated on page 25 of
Through the Brazilian Wilderness (MURRAY) that his was
not a hunting-trip, but a scientific expedition, I winked
solemnly, so often have I read books in which science is
used as an excuse for a slaughter that to the unbloodthirsty
seems to be more than a little indiscriminate. Now, how-
ever, there is nothing to do but to withdraw that wink and
to say that Mr. Roosevel.T and his companions killed only
for the sake of food and specimens, though on one very
exciting occasion a man called JULIo displayed a most
unwholesome desire to slay anybody or anything. This
renegade's lust for murder was merely a side-show, but it
serves vividly to illustrate the dangers and risks that the
travellers took as they fought their way along the River of
Doubt. No escape is possible from the buoyancy of Mr.
Roosevelt's style; as Irankly as any schoolboy enjoying a
holiday he revelled in the ups and downs of his adventures;
and iſ his enthusiasm for the important work that he was
helping to accomplish occasionally leads him to relate
trivialities, and also prevents him from advancing a few
kilometres without adding up the total number he has
travelled, the essential fact remains that his tale of exploit
and exploration is told with a joie de vivre that carries
everything before it. Among the many discoveries that he
made is one from which time has taken away any cause for



indeed a noble tribute to nobility—one that for every sake

Preface, which seems to suggest that the novel, written
before war broke out, was to enlighten the public, by a
sugar-coated method, as to the general terrain of the conflict
inevitable at some future date, so that we might “better

that the topical preface is being overdone these days. .
My only complaint against The Flute of Arcady (STANLEY
PAUL) is that Miss KATE HORN,
which some ladies had been in-
vited to be present. They indulged
in whisperings and chatterings
which greatly disturbed the
players. BUELow turned round
and said, “Ladies, we are not
here to save the Capitol, but to

admiring suitor, Dr. Shuckford.
I felt deeply for poor Charlotte,
and longed for the moment when
the doctor, who was eminently
desirable, would fold her in his
manly arms. But this moment
came confusingly early, in the
third chapter, and left us with
three-quarters of the book to fill
up. So Charlotte, for no reason
—that I could see—but this of
space, refuses her Shuckford, and
off go she and Mrs. Menzies to
Versailles, where they meet a
good number of pleasantly-drawn
people, and encounter a variety
of adventures, some amusing
some merely farcical. Without
doubt Miss HoRN has a pretty

(From the Ex-Sultan of TURREY.)
My BRother, There are many who in these days gnash
their teeth against you and pursue with malice and reproach
the words you utter and the deeds you perform, so that
verily the tempests of the world beat about your head. It
may please you, therefore, to know that there is one man
at least whose affectionate admiration for you has suffered
no decrease, nay, has rather been augmented a hundredfold
by the events of the past half-year. Need I say that I am
that man 2
It is true that I have been shorn of my honours and
privileges, that I live in exile as a prisoner and that the vile
insulters of fallen majesty compass me about. I who once
dwelt in splendour and issued my commands to the legions
of the faithful am treated with contumely by a filthy pack
of time-servers, and have nothing that I can call my own
except, for the moment, the air that I breathe. Oh, for an
hour of the old liberty and power! It would amuse me to
see the faces of ENVER and of my wretched brother
Moham MED as I ordered them to execution-them and
their gang of villainous parasites. By the bowstring of
my fathers, but that would be a great and worthy killing !

those who warned me against you. “Beware,” they
said, “ of the GERMAN EMPEROR. He will use you for
his own purposes, and will then cast you aside like an
orange that has been squeezed.” But I paid no heed to
their jealous imaginings, and I had my reward. Not,
indeed, that you were able to save me when the wicked
burst upon me and cast me down. The stroke was too
sudden, and you, alas, were too far. But the memory of
our delightful friendship is still with me to sustain and
comfort me in my tribulations. I still have some of the
letters in which you poured out your heart to me, and when
melancholy oppresses me I take them from my breast and
read them over and over again.
It is a joy to me to know that there is a firm alliance
between my brave Turks and your magnanimous soldiers.
I doubt not that Allah, the good old friend of the Turks,
will continue to bless you and give you victory after victory
over your enemies. It is no less a joy to learn how gloriously
and how sagaciously you are conducting this war. They
tell me that your ships have bombarded the coast towns of
England, and that five or six hundred of the inhabitants
have fallen before your avenging shells. What matters it
that these towns were not fortified in the strict and stupid
sense, and that there were many women and children
amongst those you slew 2 The towns were fortified in the
sense that they were hostile to your high benevolence,
and as for women and children you need not even dream
of excusing yourself to me. These English are no better
than Armenians. It is necessary to extirpate them, and
the younger you catch them the less time they have for
devising wickedness against the Chosen of Allah. As for
Women, they need hardly be taken into account. In all
these matters I know by your actions that you agree. You
must proceed on your noble course until the last of these
infidels is swept away to perdition. - -
May I condole with you on the loss of your four ships
of war by the guns of the British Admiral STURDEE? That
was, indeed, a cowardly blow, and it is hard to understand
why it was allowed. - -
Farewell then, my Brother. Be assured again of the
undying friendship and admiration of the poor exile,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE REAL HERO OF THE WAR.
THERE is an impression about that
among the candidates for the position
of real hero of the war KING ALBERT
might have a chance; or even Lord
KITCHENER or Sir John FRENCH. But
I have my doubts, after all that I have
heard—and I love to hear it and to
watch the different ways in which the
tellers narrate it: some so frankly proud,
some just as proud, but trying to conceal
their pride. After all that I have heard
I am bound to believe that for the real
hero of the war we must look elsewhere.
Not much is printed of this young
fellow's deeds; one gets them chiefly by
word of mouth and very largely in club
smoking-rooms. In railway carriages
too, and at dinner-parties. These are
the places where the champions most
do congregate and hold forth. And
from what they say he is a most gallant
and worthy warrior. Versatile as well,
for not only does he fight and bag his
Bosch, but he is wounded and im-
prisoned. Sometimes he rides a motor
cycle, sometimes he flies, sometimes he
has charge of a gun, sometimes he is
doing Red Cross work, and again he
helps to bring up the supplies with the
A.S.C. He has been everywhere. He
was at Mons and he was at Cambrai.
He marched into Ypres and is rather
angry when the Germans are blamed
for shelling the Cloth Hall, because he
tells you that there was a big French
gun firmly established behind it, and
only by shelling the building could the
enemy hope to destroy that dangerous
piece of ordnance. He saw something
of the bombardment of Rheims and he
watched the monitors at work on the
Belgian coast.
And not only does he perform some
of the best deeds and often get rewarded
for them, but he is a good medium for
news too. He hears things. He's
somewhere about when General
says something of the deepest signifi-
cance to General He knows
men high up in the War Office. He
refers lightly to KITCHENER, and staff
officers apparently tell him many of
their secrets. He speaks quite casually
and familiarly of WINSTON and what
WINSTON said yesterday, for he often
has the latest Admiralty news too. It
was he who had the luck to be in
the passage when Lord FISHER and
another Sea Lord executed their historic
waltz on the receipt of the news of
STURDEE's coup. I don't pretend that
he is always as worthy of credence as
he was then; for he has spread some
false rumours too. He was, in fact, one
of the busiest eye-witnesses (once or
twice removed) of the triumphant
Scotland and England some months
ago. He is not unaware of the loss of
battleships of which nothing has yet
been officially stated. In fact, his
unofficial news is terrific and sometimes
must be taken with salt. But denials
do not much abash him. He was pre-
pared for them and can explain them.
His letters are interesting and cover
a vast amount of ground. They are
sometimes very well written, and in
differing moods he abuses the enemy
and pities them. He never grumbles
but is sometimes perplexed by overwork
in the trenches. He hates having to
stand long in water and has lost more
comrades than he likes to think about.
One day he was quite close to General
JoFFRE, whom he regards as a sagacious
leader, cautious and far-sighted; another
day he was close to Sir John FRENCH,
and nothing could exceed the confidence
which his appearance kindled in him,
On the morning of the KING's arrival
at the Front he was puzzled by the
evolutions of our air scouts, who seemed
to have gone mad; but it turned out
that they were saluting HIS MAJESTY.
Some of his last letters were from the
neighbourhood of Auchy and described
the fighting for the canal. He is a
little inconsistent now and then, and
one day says he has more cigarettes
than he can smoke, and the next be-
wails the steady shortage of tobacco.
As to his heroic actions he is reticent;
but we know that many of the finest
deeds have been performed by him.
He has saved lives and guns and is
in sight of the V.C.
And what is his name? Well, I can't
say what his name is, because it is not
always the same; but I can tell you
how he is always described by those
who relate his adventures, his prowess,
his news, his suspicions and his fears.
He is always referred to as “My son.”
“My son,” when all is said, is the
real hero of the war.
It is all very well to warn the British
public (naturalised or otherwise) against
supporting and comforting the enemy,
but it might have more effect if those
in authority set the example.
“The British Government declares that in
the event of the Austrian Government being
in need of funds, Great Britain is ready to
provide them.”—Japan Chronicle.
“King George has sent a warmly-worded
telegram of congratulation to the new Sultan
of Turkey.”—Sunday Chronicle.
Paragraphs such as these, for instance,
do not provide the proper inspiration.
“There are increasing rumours of serious
fiction between the Austrians and the Ger-
mans.”—Natal Times.

By the shacks and the Chinks' truck-gardens to the Atha-

Standing and spitting and swearing by old Macallister's

And the name on their lips was Britain—the word that
they spoke was War.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Thus, what Twyerley calls “the
human interest” is amply catered for.
The section “International Law for
the Million” presents its subject in a
novel tabloid form, as exhaustive as it
is entertaining. I know for a fact that
an army of clerks has been engaged at
the British Museum for some weeks
looking up the data.
Following the part which contains
concise accounts of every European
nation from the earliest times, comes
“Points for Plenipotentiaries,” occu-
pying several entire numbers. Here is
where the genius of Twyerley shines at
its brightest, and personally I think
that the British representatives at the
Peace Congress should be provided
beforehand with these invaluable pages.
With Twyerley at their elbows, so to
speak, they should be equal to the task
of checkmating the wily foreigner.
I wish the KAISER could see Twyerley
scissoring his territory to shreds!
A VOICE IN THE NIGHT.
I DISLIKE many things—snakes, for
example, and German spies, and the
income tax, and cold fat mutton; but
even more than any of these I dislike
William Smith.
As all the world knows, special
constables hunt in couples at nights,
a precaution adopted in order that, if
either of the two is slain in the execu-
tion of his duty, the other may be in a
position to report on the following
morning the exact hour and manner
of his decease, thus satisfying the
thirst of the authorities for the latest
information, and relieving his departed
companion's relatives of further anxiety
in regard to his fate.
William Smith is the special con-
stable who hunts with me. As to
whom or what we are hunting, or
what we should do to them or they
would do to us if we caught them or
they caught us, we are rather vague;
but we endeavour to carry out our duty.
Our total bag to date has been one
Royal Mail, and even him we merely
let off with a caution.
Three days ago, by an unfortunate
coincidence, William Smith overtook
me at the end of the High Street, just
as our sergeant was coming round the
corner in the opposite direction. At
sight of the latter we halted, dropped
our parcels in the mud, stiffened to
attention and saluted. The last was
a thing we ought not to have done,
even allowing for his leggings, which
were (and are still) of a distinctly
upper-military type. But in the special
constabulary your sergeant is a man to
be placated. His powers are, enor-
beauty sleep at both ends by detailing
you for duty from 12 to 4 A.M.; or, on
the other hand, he can forget you
altogether for a fortnight. Thus we
always avoid meeting him if possible;
failing that, we always salute him.
“Ha!” exclaimed our sergeant.
We shuddered, and William Smith,
who is smaller than myself, tried to
escape his gaze by forming two deep.
“What the devil are you playing
at 2" growled our sergeant. Though
one of the more prominent sidesmen at
our local church, he has developed
quite the manner of an officer, almost,
at times, I like to think, of a general
officer. William Smith formed single
rank again.
Our sergeant took out his notebook.
“I'm glad I happened to meet you
two,” he said.
We shivered, but otherwise remained
at attention. -
“Let me see,” he went on, consulting
his list, “you are on together again to-
morrow night at 12.”
It was the last straw. Forgetting
his rank, forgetting his leggings, for-
getting the possibilities of his language,
forgetting myself, I spoke.
“I protest,” I said.
The eyes of our sergeant bulged
with wrath, pushing his pince-nez off
his nose and causing them to clatter
to the pavement. But a special con-
stable is a man of more than ordinary
courage. “Allow me,” I murmured,
and I stooped, picked them up and
handed them back to him.
“Explain yourself,” he muttered
hoarsely.
“For the past three months,” I said,
“I have endured fifty-six of the darkest
hours of the night, cut off from any
possibility of human aid, in the company
of William Smith, a conversational
egoist of the lowest and most determined
type. Throughout this period he has
inflicted on me atrocities before which
those of the Germans pale into insigni-
ficance. During the first month he
described to me in detail the achieve-
ments and diseases from birth upwards
of all his children—a revolting record.
He next proceeded to deal exhaustively
with the construction and working of
his gramophone, his bathroom geyser,
his patent knife-machine and his
vacuum carpet-cleaner; also with his
methods of drying wet boots, marking
his under-linen, circumventing the
water-rate collector and inducing fer-
tility in reluctant pullets. This brought
us to the middle of November. Finally,
during the last four weeks he has
wandered into the ramifications of his
wife's early-Victorian family tree, of
which we are still in the lower branches.
no children, poultry, pedigree wives, nor
any of the other articles, except boots
and shirts, in which the soul of William
Smith rejoices. There is but one
remedy open to me, and of this, unless
you detail me for duty with someone
else, I propose to avail myself at the
first convenient opportunity. I shall
kill William Smith.” -
I stopped and saluted again.
And then a wonderſul thing happened.
I discovered that beneath our sergeant's
military leggings there still beat the
rudiments of a human heart. Yes, as I
looked at him I saw his softened eyes
suffused with sympathetic tears.
“My poor fellow !” he said in a
broken voice.
It was too much. I sank to the
pavement, saluting as I fell, and knew
no more. When 1 recovered conscious-
ness in hospital I ſound in the pocket
of my coat an envelope containing the
following: “Promoted to the rank of
corporal and invalided for three weeks,
after which you will take duty with
your chauffeur.”
William Smith and I have severed
diplomatic relations. It is better so.

Upon his native strand.”
Sailing by night and veiled in mist,
His swiftest ships of war
Rained death on two defenceless
towns
For half an hour or more,
Till they had slain and wounded babes
And women by the score.
The Fatherland was filled with joy
By this heroic deed;
It gloated o'er the slaughtered babes
Of Albion's hated breed;
And Iron Crosses fell in showers
On those who'd made them bleed.
But honest neutrals everywhere
Were sickened and dismayed;
The Turk, not squeamish as a rule,
No special glee betrayed;

It is well known that all publications

precautions to safeguard readers of The

In approaching the Peace problem
at this stage Twyerley is displaying his
customary foresight. The military

lic-spirited attempt to let the readers

Twyerley at work upon the map is a
thrilling spectacle. With his remorse-

The History is to be completed in

[DECEMBER 30, 1914,
VICTORINE.
VICTORINE, our new general, is a
Belgian refugee. She was naturally
somewhat broken in spirit on first
entering our establishment, but as the
days went by she became happier, and
so enterprising and ingratiating that
we hastened to smother in its infancy
a shameful doubt as to whether or not
we had introduced into our sympathetic
bosoms a potential viper. Morning,
noon and night there was continuous
scrubbing, polishing and beeswaxing:
at all moments one was meeting a pink
and breathless Victorine, and the house
echoed to an interminable stream of
information in the French tongue,
At mealtime, the verdict having
been duly pronounced on each succes-
sive dish, Victorine would stand by
while we ate, and unburden herself
confidentially. “Mon mari' (Jean
Baptiste, a co-refugee who had searched
all London for a place as valet de
chambre) was lightly touched upon.
Belgium was described in glowing
terms, a land of wonders we had not
dreamt of.
“Miss will not believe me, but when
first we arrive in England all the
world cries, “Oh regard then the little
sheep !' For Mademoiselle must know
that in Belgium the sheep are high and
big as that ” (Victorine sketches in the
air the dimensions of a good-sized
donkey). “Monsieur mocks himself
of me? Monsieur should visit my pays
where dwell the sheep of a bigness and
a fatness to rejoice the heart, and
| whose wool is of a softness incredible;
Monsieur would not then smile thus in
his beard." Victorine assumes an atti-
tude of virtuous indignation, disturbed
| by the ringing of the telephone bell.
“I save myself,” she murmurs.
Through the half-open door we hear
as usual only scraps of dialogue, all on
one side, and very unsatisfying.
“Alloa J'écoute Madame, je ne
parle que le français—hein 2''. Long
pause. “Alloa Alloa " Victorine
rattles the instrument impatiently.
“Ah! ga y est! Si Madame désire que
j'appelle Miss—? Quel nom? Hein?
Méesus Tsch — arch – kott. Mon
Dieu * x
Victorine lays down the receiver and
comes back flushed into the room.
“C'est Meesus Arch-tsch-kott qui
demande Miss au téléphone. She
desire to know if Miss will take the
dinner with her. Are they difficult
these English names!”
But English names are not Victorine's
sole difficulty. She wrestles (mentally)
from time to time with the butcher and
the baker and the milkman. The milk-
greets him in the mornings in voluble
French, and he in return bows elabor-
ately and pretends to drop the milk.
We have watched the process from an
upper window, Victorine takes a step
lackward, her hand flies to her heart,
and, as she afterwards informs us, “her
blood gives but a turn "at this exhibi-
tion of British wit. We have been won-
dering whether it would be judicious to
teach her to say, “Get along with yer.”
She is very prolific in “ideas,” and
seems to be chiefly inspired when en-
gaged in the uncongenial pastime of
cleaning the grate.
“Know you, Miss, that I have an
idea, me?”
“No, really, Victorine.”
“Yes,” says Victorine, mournfully
shaking her head, “but only an idea.”
Victorine lays down her implements
and places her hands on her hips.
“If,” she says slowly, “this Meesus
Schmeet who was with Mr. and Miss
before my arrival was a German spy,
hein 2"
“But why, Victorine?” -
Victorine assumes an air of owl-like
wisdom. -
“See here,” she says, placing the
forefinger of one hand on the thumb of
the other, “first she depart to care for
the niece who is suffering — it is
generally the mother, but that imports
not. Then,” counting along her fingers,
“during three months she is absent,
and, thirdly,” sinking her voice, “she
sends for her malles, which contain
doubtless—who knows?— plans of
London, designs of the fortresses, and
perhaps a telegraphy without wires—
Marconi, what do I know 2 Mademoi-
selle must admit that it has the air
droll 2"
We do our best to allay Victorine's
anxiety. She however is not at all
convinced, and evidently reserves to
herself full liberty of action to protect
us from German espionage and the
effects of our own guilelessness at a
later date.
In the rare moments when not at
work she is pensive, but her imagination
is by no means at rest. She gazes
languidly out of the window into “ce
brouillard,” as she fondly calls a slight
morning mist. The sparrows interest
her.
“See, Miss, a sparrow who carries a
piece of bread big as a house; is it then
an English sparrow that accomplishes
such prodigies?”
Not quite fathoming the drift of
Victorine's meditations we suggest that
it is perhaps a Belgian refugee sparrow,
at which her amusement is so intense
that she is obliged to leave the room.
Sometimes, her fancy takes great
Her weekly bath gives rise to much
lofty philosophical reflection, and she
has come to the firm conclusion that it
is “mieux que manger.” Also she has
great taste, of which she occasionally
gives us the benefit. She laughs scorn-
fully at certain objets d'art and praises
others. Ornaments, if they meet with
her approval, are arranged in rigidlines
of continuous beauty, less favoured ones
being pushed into the background, and
books are disposed with assumed care.

it is plain she thinks little of our taste

“It is plain that Miss has the eye

that fell by hazard and burst itself.

leaning back and half closing her eyes.
“In Belgium could it not be better
done. No. It is ſ, Victorine, who say
it. If Monsieur has the false digestion,
by contrary it is evident that he has
the head solid.”
But Victorine has a fault dark and
grievous in the British eye, She jibs
at fresh air. -
“Surely Mr., and above all Miss,

grand-open of that fashion? As for
me I have the neuralgias to make fear!

A short lecture follows, in which the
ill effects of stuffiness are pointed out,
and Victorine is reduced to unconvinced
and mutinous silence. As the days

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Sir John Lubbock, whose Life, by Mr. HoRACE HUTch-
INSON, MACMILLAN publishes in two volumes, was one of
the most honourable men who figured in public life during
the last half-century. He was also one of the most widely
honoured. Under his name on the title-page of the book
appears a prodigious paragraph in small type enumerating
the high distinctions bestowed upon him by British and
foreign literary and scientific bodies. Forestalling the leisure
of a bank-holiday I have counted the list and find it contains
no fewer than fifty-two high distinctions, one for every week
of the year. These were won not by striking genius or bril-
liant talent. Sir John LUBBock, to preserve a name which
the crowning honour of the peerage did not displace in the
public mind, was by nature and daily habit constitutionally
industrious. After Eton he joined his father's banking
business. In his diary under date Christmas Day, 1852,
being the nineteenth year of his age, he gives an account
of how he spends his day. It is too long to quote, but,
beginning by “getting up at half-past six,” it includes
steady reading in natural history, poetry, political economy,
science, mathematics and German. Breakfast, luncheon
and tea are mentioned in due course; but there is no reference
to dinner or supper. These functions were doubtless re-

I knew LUBBoCK personally during his long membership
of the House of Commons. He had neither grace of diction
nor charm of oratory. But he had a way of getting Bills
through all their stages which exceeded the average attained
by more attractive speakers. In his references to Parlia-
mentary life he mentions that GLADSTONE, when he pro-
posed to abolish the Income Tax, told him that he intended
to meet the deficiency partly by increase of the death duties.
That was a fundamental principle of the Budget Lord
RANDoLPH CHURCHILL prepared during his brief Chancellor-
ship of the Exchequer. It was left to Sir WILLIAM HAR-
Court to realise the fascinating scheme, later to be extended
by Mr. LLoyd GEORGE. Another of Lord RANDoIPH's
personally unfulfilled schemes was the introduction of one-
pound notes. In a letter dated 16th December, 1886, he
confidentially communicated his project to LUBBoCK.
When his book reaches its second edition Mr. HUTCHINsoN
will have an opportunity of correcting a misapprehension
set forth on page 48. He writes that, on June 21st, 1895,
“all were startled by an announcement that Mr. GLADstoxE
had resigned and that Parliament was to be dissolved.”
The surprise was not unnatural since Lord RoseBERY was
Prime Minister at this memorable crisis.

“Halt! Who goes there?” “Friend,” said Mr. Punch hopefully. “It's Mr. Punch," said a cheerful voice.
“Come in.”
The Cornet-Major of the B.S.R. glissaded into the trench and found himself shaking hands with a very young
subaltern of the th s. [Censored.]
“Thought I recognised you,” he said. “ Glad to see you out here, Sir.”
“That's really what I came about,” said Mr. Punch. “I want your advice."
“My advice I Good Lord! . . . Sure you're comfortable there 2 Now what'll you have 2 Cigar or barley.
sugar?” Mr. Punch accepted a cigar.
“We’re all for barley-sugar ourselves just now,” the subaltern went on. “Seems kiddish, but there it is.”
Mr. Punch lit his cigar and proceeded to explain himself.
“I say that I have come to consult you,” he began. “It seems strange, you think. I am seventy-three, and
you are -n
“Twenty-two,” said the subaltern. “Next November.”
“And yet Seventy-three comes here to sit at the feet of Twenty-two, and for every encouraging word that
Twenty-two offers him Seventy-three will say “Thank you!'” -
“Rats,” said Twenty-two for a start.
“Let me explain,” said the Venerable One. “There come moments in the life of every man when he says
suddenly to himself, ‘What am I doing? Is it worth it?'—a moment when the work of which he has for years
been proud seems all at once to be of no value whatever.” The subaltern murmured something. “No, not necessarily
indigestion. There may be other causes. Well, such a moment has just come to me . . . and I wondered.” He
hesitated, and then added wistfully, “Perhaps you could say something to help me.”
“The pen,” said the subaltern, coughing slightly, “is mightier than the sword.”
“It is,” said the Sage. “I've often said so . . . in Peace time.”
The subaltern blushed as he searched his mind for the Historic Example.
“Didn't Wolfe say that he would rather have written what 's-its-name than taken Quebec 2" he asked
hesitatingly.
“Yes, he did. And for most of his life the poet would have agreed with him. But, if at the moment when
he read of the taking of Quebec you had asked GRAY, I think he would have changed places with Wolfe very
willingly . . . And in Bouverie Street,” added Mr. Punch, “we read of the takings of Quebecs almost every day."
The subaltern was thoughtful for a moment.
“I’ll tell you a true story,” he said quietly. “There was a man in this trench who had his leg shot off. They
couldn't get him away, till night, and here he had to wait for the whole of the day . . . He stuck it out . . .
And what do you think he stuck it out on ?”
“Morphia?" suggested Mr. Punch.
“Partly on morphia, and partly on—something else.”
“Yes?” said Mr. Punch breathlessly.
“Yes—you. He read . . . and he laughed . . . and by-and-by the night came.”
A silence came over them both. Then Mr. Punch got up quietly.
“Good-bye,” he said, holding out his hand, “and thank you. That moment I spoke about seems to have gone."
He took a book from under his arm and placed it in the other's hands. “I generally give this away with rather a flourish."
he confessed. “This time I'll just say, ‘Will you take it?' It's all there; all that I think and hope and dream, and
that you out here are doing . . . Good luck to you—and let me help some more of you to stick it out.”
And with that he returned to Bouverie Street, leaving behind in the trench his

“Halt! Who goes there?" "Friend,” said Mr. Punch hopefully. "It's Mr. Punch," said a cheerful voice.
“Come in."
The Cornet-Major of the B.S.R. glissaded into the trench and found himself shaking hands with a rery young
subaltern of the -th - —s. (Censored.]
“ Thought I recognised you," he said. “Glad to see you out here, Sir.”
“That's really what I came about,” said Mr. Punch. “I want your advice."
"My advice! Good Lord ! . . . Sure you 're comfortable there ? Now what 'll you have? Cigar or barley-
sugar?” Mr. Punch accepted a cigar.
“We're all for barley-sugar ourselves just now," the subaltern went on. “Seems kiddish, but there it is."
Mr. Punch lit his cigar and proceeded to explain himself.
I
say
that I have come to consult you," he began. “It seems strange, you think. I am seventy-three, and
you are-
“Twenty-two," said the subaltern. “Next November."
“And yet Seventy-three comes here to sit at the feet of Twenty-two, and for every encouraging word that
Twenty-two offers him Seventy-three will say. Thank
you!'"
Rats," said Twenty-two for a start.
“Let me explain," said the Venerable One. "There come moments in the life of every man when he says
suddenly to himself
, What am I doing? Is it worth it?'—a moment when the work of which he has for years
been proud seems all at once to be of no value whatever." The subaltern murmured something. “No, not necessarily
indigestion. There may be other causes. Well, such a moment has just come to me ... and I wondered." He
hesitated, and then added wistfully, “ Perhaps you could say something to help me.".
“The pen," said the subaltern, coughing slightly, “is mightier than the sword.”
It is,” said the Sage. “I've often said so ... in Peace time."
The subaltern blushed as he searched his mind for the Historic Example.
"Didn't WOLFE say that he would rather have written what 's-its-name than taken Quebec ?” he asked
hesitatingly.
Yes, he did. And for most of his life the poet would have agreed with him. But, if at the moment when
he read of the taking of Quebec you had asked GRAY, I think he would have changed places with Wolfe very
willingly ... And in Bouverie Street,” added Mr. Punch, we read of the takings of Quebecs almost every day."
The subaltern was thoughtful for a moment.
“I'll tell you a true story,” he said quietly. “There was a man in this trench who had his leg shot off. They
couldn't get him away till night, and here he had to wait for the whole of the day ... He stuck it out ...
And what do you think he stuck it out on?”
"Morphia ?” suggested Mr. Punch.
“Partly on morphia, and partly on-something else."
"Yes?” said Mr. Punch breathlessly.
“Yes—you. He read ... and he laughed and by-and-by the night came."
A silence came over them both. Then Mr. Punch got up quietly.
“Good-bye,” he said, holding out his hand, “and thank you. That moment I spoke about seems to have gone."
He took a book from under his arm and placed it in the other's hands. “I generally give this away with rather a flourish,"
he confessed. “This time I'll just say, Will you take it?' It's all there; all that I think and hope and dream, and
that you out here are doing ... Good luck to you—and let me help some more of you to stick it out."
And with that he returned to Bouverie Stroet, leaving behind in the trench bis

As, for example. . . Topped the thing! Tut, tut!
Yes, force of habit; must have swung too quick;
Mistcok its whiteness for a coney's scut
And shot a bit ahead—a useful trick
With targets on the run, but not with those
That keep a firm repose.
So to 't again. . . Ah! hit the silly ground!
I took my eye off, did I? Then I erred
I3y sporting instinct; I have never found
Much good was done by dwelling on a bird.
Of course, a ball is different; as you say,
It wouldn't move away.
A truce to blood' To-day with careless breast Now for another. ... That's a fairish knock,
The jocund cock shall laugh as though 'twere June; Full in the tail-piece. Mark him, mark him down!
The partridge gives his jumpy nerves a rest; A runner—in the gorse there. Where's old Rock?
The pigeon wheel above his woods immune; I hate this dog's work. . . Bang goes half-a-crown'
I might have laid a score of pheasants flat
No feathered thing shall curse, in act to die,
For less expense than that.
My fatal gift of eye.
A truce to blood! To-day no squatting hare
On my account shall prick an anxious ear;
No rabbit, issuing from his earthy lair,
Review the scene to note if I am near:
No beater, as he hears my weapon's blast,
Regret his godless past.
[After losing his temper and three more
balls, the speaker resumes:
Frankly, your golf is not a sportsman's
game; -
It hurts my finer British sense to hit
A stationary mark, too small and tame
To stand a chance against my strength and
wit:
I do not care to strike at little things
With neither legs nor wings.
All these, I say, shall have this one day off.
Yet not for their convenience alone
I take this little interlude of golf—
The game has pleasant features all its own;
Less sudden in its joys, it suits, I find, -
My tranquil cast of mind. --wº -
- - Match me with foes more mobile, more my
slze—
IBirds are SO restive—always prone to flight.
The raging hare, the rabbit on the prowl,
Compare with them this sedentary ball
That waits upon my pleasure, sitting tight, The partridge swooping under windy skies,
And not concerned about itself at all; The savage duck and other desperate fowl—
Making it optional for me to strike That lend a larger scope for manly skill
Just when, and where, I like. Than yonder paltry pill. O. S.

THE LITTLE SITTER.
[Reflections of a sportsman who is given a day off for golf in the midst of a series of mixed shoots.]
As, for example. . . Topped the thing! Tut, tut!
Yes, force of habit; must bave swung too quick;
Mistcok its whiteness for a coney's scut
And shot a bit ahead-a useful trick
With targets on the run, but not with those
That keep a firm repose.
Sɔ to't again. . . Ah! hit the silly ground !
I took my eye off, did I? Then I erred
By sporting instinct; I have never found
Much good was done by dwelling on a bird.
Of course, a ball is different; as you say,
It wouldn't move away.
Now for another. .. That's a fairish knock,
Full in the tail-piece. Mark him, mark him down!
A runner—in the gorse there. Where's old Rock ?
I hate this dog's work. . . Bang goes half-a-crown!
I might have laid a score of pheasants flat
For less expense than that.
A TRUCE to blood! To-day with careless breast
The jocurd cock shall laugh as though 'twere June;
The partridge gives his jumpy nerves a rest;
The pigeon wheel above bis woods immune;
No feathered thing shall curse, in act to die,
My fatal gift of eye.
A truce to blood! To-day no squatting hare
On
my account shall prick an anxious ear;
No rabbit, issuing from his earthy lair,
Review the scene to note if I am near:
No beater, as he hears my weapon's blast,
Regret his godless past.
[After losing his temper and three more
balls, the speaker resumes :
Frankly, your golf is not a sportsman's
game;
It hurts my finer British sense to hit
A stationary mark, too small and tame
To stand a chance against my strength and
wit;
I do not care to strike at little things
With neither legs nor wings.
All these, I say, shall have this one day off.
Yet not for their convenience alone
I take this little interlude of golf-

Less sudden in its joys, it suits, I find,

That waits upon my pleasure, sitting tight,

THE HALO THEY GIVE THEMSELVES.
[Not E. –Mr. Punch is in the extraordinarily fortunate position of being able to present to his readers a story specially written for
him by Mrs. FLORENCE BARCLAY (author of The Broken Halo and other imperishable works) and Mr. HALL CAINE (author of The Woman
Thou Gavest Me and kindred masterpieces) in collaboration. The meeting of the two famous writers took place at Bouverie Street, each
of them expressing considerable surprise at hearing that the other wrote books also. After they had compared sales and methods of
advertisement, they arranged that their new story for Mr. Punch should be written in alternate spasms. By an unfortunate error of
judgment, however, the illustrations were left to an artist who had never read a word of either author in his life, and who insisted that
it was much too late to begin now. Luckily the half-dozen drawings he sent in were such that they could easily be made to fit the text;
and in the result Mr. Punch feels that the story is at least as well illustrated as the average story in the magazines.]

(Pity that the Spring should ever stop!)
Now the year's no longer in its heyday,
Don't you think we'd better let it drop ?
Honestly, I thought it was a sure case;
Only, now the early Winter's come,
Lady, as in others', so in your case,
I confess to ge ting rather numb.
In the Spring a young man's fancy liglıtly
Turns to love, as doubtless you're aware;
In the Spring we wax exceeding sprightly,
Due, no doubt, to something in the air.
Do not deem me fickle, dear, and faithless;
Though the readjustment seems to be
Sudden--not to call it startling---natheless
You can hardly put it down to me.
Then, as was both natural and proper,
We two met and, scorning all delay,
Vowed to wed, and neither cared a copper
For the pregnant fact that it was May.
Love appears, for some unfathomed reason,
Like a flow'r that ripens with the sun;
And, like everything that has its season,
Withers when its little course is run.
Summer came and, warming with the weather,
Rarely was an ardour such as mine;
You'll recall that, take it altogether,
For an English summer it was fine.
1
That's what I conceive to be the matter;
And I write, believe me, with regret;
For I own, with no desire to flatter,
That you 're quite the nicest girl I've met.
Still, farewell, or (put it less severely)
Au reroir; I hope you 'll keep the ring;
Snows are brief, and I, who loved you dearly
Once, again may do so-in the Spring.
Summer turned to Autumn, and September
Opened to the world her golden feast;
Quite a record month, as you'll remember,
And my love, if anything, increased.
Dum Dum,
