From special correspondents—miles

The news from Rott- or Amst-erdam
Has German powder in its jam.
The news from Petrograd, when fine
And large, 'tis wiser to decline
Without the GRAND DUKE's countersign.

The Russian news that comes from Rome
Is as romantic as a pome.

News from Wier wakes in Nish

On Turkish telegrams, qua fiction,
They match (their humour is so tireless)
The exploits of the German Wireless.
In fine, the cautious type eschews,
As wholly prejudicial

FROM THE NEUTRAL NATIONS.
[The recent boom in the export of copper from America to the
neutral nations is very significant. If the enemy's supplies of this
article—an essential in the manufacture of cartridges, etc.—were
cut off, the war would come to a specdy end. The figures for Sept-
ember and October, 1914, show an increase of nearly 400 per cent.
over the corrcsponding figures for 1918.] -
O BRITAIN, guardian of the seas,
Whose gallant ships (may Heaven speed 'em)
Defend the wide world's liberties
Against the common foe of Freedom;
Doubt not where our true feelings lie;
We would not have you come a cropper,
Although it suits us to supply
That common foe with copper.
Dear Land of Hope, in which we trust,
Beneath whose ample wings we snuggle,
Saſe from the KAIs ER's culture-lust
And free to live and smile—and smuggle;
Devoted to the peaceful arts,
We keep our conduct strictly proper,
Yet all the time you have our hearts
(And Germany our copper).
Although the crown is theirs alone
Who crush the tyrant's bold ambitions,
Peace hath her profits, all her own,
Derived from contraband munitions;
And you who fight for Freedom's aims
Will surely shrink to put a stopper
Upon our bagmen's righteous claims
And burst the boom in copper.
Once more we swear our hearts are true
And, like the tar's connubial token,
“It doesn't matter what we do”
If we but keep that pledge unbroken ;
So while we pray for Prussia's fall,
And look to your stout arm to whop her,
We mean to answer every call
She makes on us for copper. O. S.
THE KAISER'S LOST CHANCE.
I Found him gazing intently at the framed Bill of Fare
by the main door of the Restaurant Furioso, where l lºad
often lunched at his table.
“Hullo, Fritz!” I exclaimed.
here? Have you been sacked 2"
“Ach, Mein Herr,” he answered, “there has of the
German waiters what you call an up-round been. I prove
myself Swiss; I invoke the memory of WILHELM TELL and
the Alpine Club, but the proprietor say that he take no risk,
and out I go. But no matter. I myself was myself to
have sacked, but he spoke too quick.”
I said I was sorry and asked whether he meant to go back
to Switzerland. Fritz winked and tapped his breast pocket.
“Perhaps,” he said. “I am rich, I have money. But
first I buy new clothes and then I lunch at my own table
at the Furioso.”
“Come where you can tell me all about it,” said I, scent-
ing a story, and he led me to a quiet tavern in a back street.
“Beer,” was his answer to my first question. “English
beer. I have done with Germany.”
“I thought you said you were Swiss,” I remarked.
“That is so,” he replied; “but I have served Germany,
and, ach! she have the thankless tooth of the serpent's
child. I have read your SHAKSPEARE. But you shall know
“What are you doing out
secret meeting and the false name and so on.
laugh in my face. They call me fool, but I have money,
and the KAIs ER has missed his chance.
“Listen, Mein Herr I have been one of STEIN hauer's
spies. He is the Master Spy and came over to England
with the KAIsrR, and he stayed, I am told, at Buckingham
Palace. But STEINHAUER is a fool, and I tell him so in my
last letter. One day, a month ago, a gentleman dine at my
table: he speak good English and wear London clothes, but
I suspect him German, and when I see him eat I know.
Some English officers also dine in the room, and he look
at them—ach! as there were sour apples in his stomach.
So I speak in German to Hans at the next table, and, when
I give the bill, the gentleman point out a too-much charge
for the butter he have not; 1 bend my head to read, and
he whisper in my ear in German.”
“Ah!” I said. “I can guess the next part about the
But tell me
how the KAIs ER missed his chance.”
“Well,” he resumed, “I become a spy. My duty was
to listen to English officers who dine at the Furioso, and
to send reports to STEINHAUER through a cutter of hairs in
Soho, who call himself Ephraim Smiley, but his right name
is Johann Schnitzelbrod. One night three young officers
dine at my table and talk much about the British Army.
Cne say the Arsenal is weak, another that the Rangers
cannot shoot for nuts, and the third that the Palace is sure
to go down next Saturday. "Aha!' I say to myself, ‘the
Army is bad, and they fear Zeppelins or revolution.’
STEINHAUER will know which, and I shall get the five-
pound note. So I send my report; but Stein HAUER is
stupid and the five-pound note come not, and I say, ‘Petter
luck on the following occasion.’
“A week later a cavalry officer dine at my table alone,
and he talk to me for company. He ask me if I follow
horses, and I say, ‘Yes, formerly, when they drew the bus.’
Then he laugh, and ask whether I ever have what he call
a flutter on a dead snip. I scratch my head, but Hans
interpret, and so, as you English say, I tumble. I tell
him I would like, but for me the dead snip have not yet
deceased. He say, “Put all your tips on Mutton Chop for
the Cookingham Stakes,' and he give me a shilling. Pre-
sently Hans tell me that Mutton Chop is not an English
food, but a horse. He say he know of what he call a
bookie who is not a Welshman, and if Mutton Chop win,
I multiply my savings one hundert times.
“So I write to STEINHAUER in haste: he must advise the
KAiser to put one hundred million marks on Mutton Chop,
and the war will be paid for and something left over for
poor Fritz. Then I take my savings from the bank and
pawn my clothes, and much money goes to the bookie to
back Mutton Chop. Well, the good Mutton Chop roll
home—that is what Hans call it, and he is a racing-
instructed; he has been waiter at Ascot, and once he go to
see the City and South London. The same day come a
letter from STEINHAUER that I am a Schweinkopf, and he
shall advise the KAISER no such thing; and he dismiss me
with notting.
But I go to the bookie, who laugh and pay me one
tausend pound. He did not care; he make ten tausend
from the many fools who back German Sausage. So I
write one last letter to STEINHAUER and say, ‘Schweinkopf
yourself! Stew in your own Sauerkraut ' He get another
spy to denounce me, but I find the police have opened all
my letters, and they laugh in my face. But the superinten-
dent say, “Much obliged, Herr Fritz! Thanks to you, I
also make my bitchen on Mutton Chop. When you get
another dead snip, pass it on.’”
Then I ordered Fritz another English beer, and gave
|al." he went on. “Already the police know all, and they
him an introduction to my own tailor.

“Crawshaw,” grumbled Chapman,“I

spirits of the poor people you leave
behind here, but your very presence in

would make the enemy run.”
THE REASON.
IIE was a saturnine - looking man
with a distinctly anti-social suggestion;
but after a while he began to talk. We
discussed one thing and another, and
casually he remarked that he was con-
nected with the motor industry—as
indeed all men whom one cannot
immediately place now are.
He did not build cars, he said, or
design them, or sell them. What then
did he do? |
“My task is a peculiar one,” he said,
“and you might never guess it. It is
wholly concerned with taxi-cabs. I am

He looked at me as with a challenge.
“It is your duty,” I inquired, with a
horrible feeling that I could not con-
gratulate him on his efficiency, “to
inspect the windows and see that they
are in good order?"
“To inspect the windows—yes,” he
replied; “but not for the purpose you
name.”
“Then why inspect them 2 " I asked
warmly. “What is wanted is some one
| to see that the wretched things can
be manipulated. I would bet that
out of every ten cabs I am in not
more than two have windows that will
work.”
“Two ' " he mused. “That's a very
high percentage. I must see to that.”
“High ' " I exclaimed.
“Yes, high," he repeated. “You
see, my duty is to visit the garages all
over London before the cabs go out
and see that the windows won't work.
If they do work I disarrange them.
That's my job.”
“But why?" I gasped.
“Haven't you noticed how much
worse they have been lately, and that,
windows are always down when you
get in, however bad the weather?"
“Yes,” I said. “Everyone must
have noticed it.” -
“Well,” he continued, “that's my
doing. That's my job.”
“But why?” 1 repeated.
“Just a part of the general scheme
of getting the War into people's minds,”
he said. “The darkening of London,
the closing of the public-houses, the
defective cab windows—they're all of
a piece. Only the cab-window trick is
the most useful.”
“How 2 " I asked.
“Well, it hardens you," he said.
“It accustoms you to cold and wet,
and that's all to the good."
So now I know.
“Around Souraine there have been violet
combats . We have mude considerable
progress in the region.”—French communiqué,
as reported in The Western Evening Herald.

ELEVEN SECONDS.
The word “schedule” always bothers
me; when I see it on an income-tax
paper I lose my head. In my con-
fusion I sign my name lavishly. I
confess to profits from trades, pro-
ſessions, employments and vocations;
I reveal the presence of unsuspected
gas-works, quarries, salt-springs, alum
mines, streams of water, ferries,
cemeteries and “other concerns of the
like nature within the United King- ||
dom”; no secret is made of my colonial
and foreign possessions. Wherever I
see an inviting gap I slip in a few
figures . . . Then the assessor looks at
my paper and tells me what I ought to
give him. -
This year things went worse than
ever. I got some noughts in the wrong
place; a whole lot of gaps headed
“Claim for Relief in Respect of Earned
Income,” which I had supplied with
particular liberality, went by the board,
all because I hadn't noticed in the pre-
ambulation some foolish date “before
which any claim must be preferred.”
Those two accidents practically doubled
my little tax . . . and then LLoyd
GEORGE went and doubled it again. It
began to look as if it would be cheaper
to pay income on my income-tax instead
of the other way round.
“Celia,” I said, “we 're ruined.
Cancel any orders for potted salmon;
we shall have to live simply in future.”
And I told her just what the tax-
gatherer had asked for.
“But why do we have to pay so
much 2" she asked.
“Partly because of the KAISER, and
partly because of me. History will
apportion the blame.’
Celia seemed prepared to anticipate
History.
“Don’t forget,” I went on hastily,
“that the money will be well spent.
If I had to make a fool of myself, I
would sooner have done it this year
than any other. It is a privilege to
pay for a war like this.”
Celia looked thoughtful.
“How much does the war cost
England?" she asked.
“Oh, lots. I think it mentioned
the exact figures in The Times this
morning. . 'll be only too glad of
my little contribution.”
She retired in search of The Times.
•,• •,• :: :: :::
The stars denote Celia at work. I
can imagine her with her head on one
side and the tip of her tongue just
peering out to see how she is getting
on, the paper in front of her a mass of
figures. The ink is creeping up her
pen; her forefinger is nervous and bids

She has finished, and she comes into
the room, trying to look grave. My letter
to the Assessor, “Sir and Friend, By
the beard (if any) of your ancestor, I
beseech you ” is abandoned, and I
turn to her.
“Well ?”
“I’ve worked it out,” she said. “Do
you know how long you'll be paying
for the war 2"
“Oh, quite a long time.”
“Eleven seconds.”
It was a little disappointing.
“Eleven seconds,” repeated Celia.

“That's too fast. Begin again.”
“One—two three—”
“That's better.” .

And all the time my brave army was
fighting in Flanders, my navy was
sweeping the North Sea, my million
recruits were growing into soldiers.
In Yorkshire my looms were busy,

guns, Northampton was giving my
gallant boys their boots. Did an aero-
plane shoot up into the sky, did a
submarine dive into the deep, mine

are you thinking about 2."
I pitched my letter to the Assessor
in the fire.
“I’ve been thinking about my war,”
Isaid. “I’very shot that was fired while
you were counting I paid for; I paid
for the food of every soldier and sailor;
for the separation allowances of their
wives; for hospitals and ambulances and
doctors.”
“How lovely it sounds. I hadn't
thought of it like that. It makes eleven
seconds seem an age.” -
“It is an age. For eleven seconds
FRENCH and JELLIcoe were my men.”
“Then I think you might have
warned me,” said Celia reproachfully,
“so that we could have shared them.”
“I’m sorry,” I said. Then I had
an idea. “It's all right,” I said, “I
made a mistake. Those weren't our
eleven seconds at all; CARNEGIE or
somebody paid for those. We'll have
ours together later on.”
“Well, let's see that they are good
ones . . . when we're having a victory.
We might tell people that the last
eleven seconds off the Falkland Islands
were ours.”
“But I hadn't paid then. Anyway,

So we have decided on Thursday,

we want to pay for as much bully beef

we shall support alone the British

one of its biggest ideas is action. Being
ostensibly on active service ourselves
we felt we ought to see a little before
going home; and now we have. . We
make no boast about it. Like the
simple English soldiers we are we
merely state the fact for what it is
worth.
You ask, you who lead the sheltered
life, what we felt like under fire; how
you swim from one trench to another;
what we ate and drank; and what a
bayonet charge is really like. Let me
answer your questions one by one.
(1) We were such a long way under
fire that some doubtexisted as to whether
the Germans were merely trying to
frighten us, or were engaged in testing
new rifles and fired high and in no
particular direction for fear of hitting
somebody. We only had one casualty
and he wanted to walk across to the
German trenches and insist on an
apology and a new pair of boots, the
right heel being practically torn off.
futile for an Englishman to argue with
Germans, especially when ignorant of
their language. If a German has made
up his mind to be careless nothing will
stop him. To return to the question,
we didn't feel under fire at all.
(2) You aren't allowed to leave a
trench; and a man who was allowed to
and then went to another shouldn't be
allowed out at all.
(3) The soldier is not particular about
his “tack”—as he calls his food.
Bacon and eggs, sausages, chicken,
washed down with hot coffee, are good
enough for him to fight on. Failing
even such humble comestibles he will,
when pressed by hunger, open a tin of
bully beef and decide he is not hungry
aſter all.
(4) Bayonet charges are getting rather
cheap, so we didn't have one.
We were opposed to the flower of the
German army, the KAISER's beloved
Prussians. This we were told on our
arrival. Next day we learned that a
prisoner taken turned out to be one of
the KAISER's beloved Bavarians. We
subsequently discovered—well, to save
time you might just take a map of the

Edward had got hold of some such
idea from diagrams in the illustrated
papers. When we reached the crumb-
ling ruins we were to defend, an officer
was so impressed by Edward's air
of woebegone disgust that he ob-
served brusquely that, in the trenches,
comfort was a matter of minor im-
portance.
This assurance pulled Edward
together for the moment; and he had
just settled down to a placid expecta-
tion of the evening meal when we
learned that our commissariat had
stuck in the mud some miles back.
However, as a second officer cheer-
fully observed, in the trenches food is a
matter of minor importance. Edward,
who had pinned all his faith on the
commissariat, relapsed into a resigned
melancholy.
Just as he was making his poor but
ingenious preparations for slumber in a
dug-out that looked like a badly drained
pond a third officer came along. A

before, they first obtained possession
of a motor car from the window of a
shop in Long Acre, drove it at a
great pace (one constable said forty
miles an hour, and another sixty-one)
to a house in Park Lane, where, while
one boy remained outside, the other
drew a revolver and forced the resident
heiress into the car. At this point
they were arrested. The boys said
that they were very sorry, but that the
spectacle of an abduction romance on
the films had been too strong for them.
The magistrate: “What is the cinema
censor about? Nothing is more deplor-
able than that the imaginations of
young boys should be excited by
these lurid dramas.” The boys were
discharged.
Three boys of six, seven and eight
respectively were charged at Sheffield
with stealing a railway train. It appears
that while the driver of a Scotch ex-
cursion, which was in a siding, was
oiling the wheels, the three boys sprang
to the footboard and started the train.
The driver pursued it, but was at once
shot by one of the boys, who was
Asked to explain their conduct the boys
said that they had seen so many train
robberies on the local cinemas that they
felt bound to do something in that line
themselves. The magistrate said he
did not wonder, and directed that the
proprietors of the cinemas should have
their licence cancelled.
Three men of criminal appearance,
against whom previous convictions
were proved, who were charged at Wine
Street with pocket picking, explained
that it was entirely due to the effect
produced upon them by Oliver Twist
on the cinema. The magistrate dis-
missed the prisoners and ordered the
cinema to be closed.
From a speech reported in the Wid-
mes Gazette : —

what it was when Julius Cesar wrote “De

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FURTHER NOTES BY A WAR-D0C.
My name's “Scottie.” I’m a collie
and wear a box in which I collect
contributions for the National Relief
Fund. Probably you've met me—and,
I hope, contributed. Not long ago, so
Mabel told a friend the other day, a
few of my early experiences were pub-
lished in a book called Punch. I've
had heaps more since then. I'm get-
ting quite an old hand at the piteous
“Won't - you - spare-me-something?”
look. For one thing, I've learnt to let
people put anything into my box. Once
I got a penny (from a little girl) that
turned out, when the box was opened,
to be chocolate. A bit cocoa-y by then,
but still eatable. But my best haul
was during my—and Mabel's-week-
end by the sea.
We went down in a corridor train,
where I collected quite a lot of money.
When the train stopped half-way there,
I jumped out for a mouthful of air,
and there, on the platform, was a black
retriever wearing a collecting box like
mine! I asked him what he meant by
it, and, as he didn't explain himself, I
went for him, and stood him upside
down; and in the scrimmage half a
crown fell out of his collecting box.
Everybody thought that it had fallen
out of mine; Mabel was sure it had ;
so it was given to me. You should
have seen that retriever when I smiled
at him from the carriage window.
We reached the sea at last. The
• Serpentine's a puddle by comparison.
The very first morning I tore across
the shingle with two two-shilling pieces
in my box rattling like eighteen-pence
in copper. Such a time I had, though
my box was dreadfully heavy, being
full of sand and sea water. Presently,
joy! the bottom fell out. But the
public later scemed quite satisfied,
until a horrid nurse-girl gave the show
away—and of course Mabel had it
mended.
The very day we came away I met
the millionaire man. It was a wild
wet day, and I was draining in an
alcove underneath the promenade when
he appeared. He didn't look rich,
and he was running and panting and
glancing over his shoulder in a hunted
manner. No sooner did he see me than
he whispered, “Blimy, 'ere's a chance
Good dawg, then—'old yer 'ed up,” and
at once crammed a heap of “goblins"
(Mabel's word) and lots of crackle
paper into my box. He followed this
up with about two yards of shiny chain
and things that winkcd so that I had
to wink as well. Then came lots of
things like goblins with their middles
bitten out; and hardly had he given
in blue rushed round the corner. I
don't remember exactly what happened,
but the millionaire man said, Blimy,
couldn't he run after his hat wot the
wind blown off 2 and the blue men
said why, yes he could, but they were
sure he hadn't. Then he said, Blimy,
they could “turn him over,” straight
they could, and they said straight they
would. But they didn't. Instead they
felt in all his pockets, and only found
a clay pipe and some cheese wº
up in newspaper. Then things be-
came so uninteresting that I sauntered
back to Mabel.
The day after our home-coming my
box and I were marched to the com-
mittee. I've had some bad times there,
but nothing quite so bad before. The
way an old girl gushed about the
“darlings" (whoever they were) part-
ing with their jewellery simply wearied
me. As soon as Mabel felt strong
enough to walk we went home. She
seemed to forget that the haul was
entirely due to me. Yet she's a won-
derful memory for some things. Ever
since breakfast to-day she's done no-
thing but talk about a daring robbery
at Winklebeach, and looks at me in the
most extraordinary manner. I don't
know what Winklebeach may be, but
it's as clear as daylight that she's
thinking of the six sweet biscuits that
I stole behind her back at her last “At
home.” But how did she find out 2
OUR FIRST CAPTURE.
By SPECIAL CoNSTABLE XXX.
You must understand that the work
of the Special Constable is so utterly
dreary that we heave sighs of envy on
seeing one of our number, an L.C.C.
employee, being allowed to clean the
windows of a public building. The
lucky dog!
Imagine, therefore, our joy at receiv-
ing a staff order to watch out for
motor-cars with hoggish headlights,
and report their numbers to head-
quarters. We were not to arrest them
—even if we could.
Within half an hour of the staff
order we registered Our First Capture.
Myself, I received a fleeting impression
of LL–8183; my colleague took it for
LS–6163. An amicable discussion
ensued. I pointed out that LS might
mean London Scottish, who should be
allowed to go scot free; he countered
with the suggestion that LL might
stand for LLOYD GEORGE, who should
also be above the law. We tossed for
it. I won. The honour fell to me to
report the capture.
“Sergeant, oblige me by recording
the following episode in your official

“Is there much more like this?”
“Don’t rob me of my hour of glory.
I've had four blank months . In
the year of grace 1914, at the hour of
5.15, post meridian, at the corner of
Street, a motor-car contravening,

Majesty's Regulations promulgated by
the Secretary of State for Home
Affairs, pursuant to an Order in
Council > *
“What was its number?” demanded
the Sergeant crudely.
“LL–8183, Sir. And I have the
honour to suspect that it belonged to
the Right Hon. DAvid Lloyd GEoRGE.”
The Sergeant, who wears a yellow
brassard, reported to the Sub-Inspector
(red band), and from there the informa-
tion will travel upwards and onwards
to the Chief Sub-Inspector (light-blue
band), the Inspector (dark-blue band),
the Commander (white band), and
the Chief Staff Officer, who resides
in the west wing of New Scotland
Yard and probably wears a cocked hat.
From there it will cross the Bridge of
Sighs to the east wing, occupied by the
more ordinary police, and will trickle
down in reverse order of precedence to
a regular Constable, who will probably
call on Mr. LLoyd GEoRGE with an
official blue paper in his hand:—
“Sir, From information received, it
transpires that on or about the 15th
instant, in the year of grace 1914, . . .
head-lights contravening, traversing or
otherwise infringing . . . and should
the offence be repeated . . . In the
name of our Sovereign Lord the King,
I’mperor of India, Defender of the
Faith.”
LLOYD GEORGE will humbly submit
to the decree, will sign a promissory
note of obedience (Moratorium barred),
and the incident will close.
Think of the glory of putting all that
in motion |
Yes, it was worth while joining the
Force.
-
It having been officially announced
(in “Charivaria”) that members of the
O.B.C. (Old Boys Corps) object to being
called the Old B.C.'s, an intolerable sug-
gestion is now put forward that they
should be known as the “Obese He's.”
Rear-Admiral Schi.IEPER says in the
Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger that the Ger-
mans could never overcome a certain
sentimental feeling of justice and deli-
cacy with regard to England. … We do
not know how Scarborough regards
this veracious statement, but our own

AT THE PLAY.
“DAVID CopperFIELD."
IF it were a simple question of bulk,
few authors would lend themselves to
the process of compression so well as
CHARLEs DickeNs; but the scheme of
David Copperfield is too complex, and
its interests too many and competitive,
to be packed into a three-hours' play,
even by Mr. Louis PARKER, master of
the tabloid. Of the main themes—the
career of the hero himself, the machina-
tions of Uriah Heep, the tragedy of
Little Em’ly—only the last was at all
effective in pillule form. The figure of
David Copperfield—always pleasant if
rather colourless—served to hold the
play together; but the central experi-
ence of his life was treated with the
extreme of haziness. We were informed
of his engagement to Dora, his mar-
riage, her illness, her death, all with the
brevity of a French official communiqué;
but as for the child-wife herself we never
so much as set eyes on her. While
again we gathered that the designs of
Uriah Heep were ultimately con-
founded, nobody without the aid of
memory or imagination could possibly
have penetrated their obscurity.
On the other hand—whether with or
without the connivance of Sir HERBERT
THEE I dare not conjecture—the person
of Wilkins Micawber was given a prom-
inence out of all proportion to his share
in any one of the plots.
something that was to make his fortune,
he was always “turning up,” and,
whenever he did, he practically had
the stage to himself.
I am far from quarrelling with this
arrangement, for I have never seen
Sir HERBERT in better form. His
humour was of the richest, yet full of
quiet subtleties, and merely to gaze
upon his grotesque figure was a pure
delight. That he should have per-
mitted himself, in a spirit of creative
irresponsibility, to deviate at times
into the borderland of farce, and be-
come an hilarious blend of himself and
Mr. HENRY JAMEs (I don't know why
he suggested to me a burlesque of Mr.
HENRY JAMEs, for I have never known
that most distinguished of writers to
lapse from decorum) need not trouble
anybody in a play where there was no
pretence of insisting upon the lettar of
DICKENS.
The transition from Falstaff to
Micawber, from a bibber of sack to a
bibber of punch, was an easy one for
Sir HERBERT; but not so easy were the
constant changes from and into the part
of Dan'l Peggotty. Here he gave us a
really admirable character-sketch—for
Peggotty belongs to the region of possi-
Unlike the
creature of incredible fancy—and I am
not sure that his achievement as the old
salt was not, for him, the greater of the
two. Certainly in the scene where he
tells of his search over the world for
Little Em'ly he came nearer to simple
pathos than I have ever known him to
come. Even the strong Somerset ac-
cent of this East Anglian tar could not
conceal his sincerity.
I shrink from the odious task of dis-
tinguishing between the merits of a
most admirable cast, but I must men-
tion the delightfully piquant drollery
of Miss SYDNEY FAIRBrother as Mrs.
Micawber, and the too-brief excellence
of Mr. Roy BYFord as the Waiter of

mark of villany. Conversely the Betsey

peared to be lacking in austerity of mien.
One shared Mr. NIGEL PLAYFAIR's
enjoyment of the futility of Mr. Dick;
but this freakish figure, so typical of
DICRENs, seemed always a little out of
the picture.
Though Mrs. Gummidge, played with
a sound restraint by Miss ADA KING,
insisted from time to time upon the
fact that she was a “lone lorn creetur',"
we were spared a good many of the
author's reiterated tags, and I think it
was not till his friends had guaranteed
World that Mr. Wilkins Micawber so
much as alluded to his habitual ex-
pectation of something “turning up.”
The popularity of the production
promises to be exceptional, and with
good reason, apart from the high
quality of the performance. For with
its human tenderness, and the relief of
its gaiety, it offers just the right kind
of distraction to the strain of public
emotion in these times. And, though
its matter bears no relation to the
subject which absorbs our hearts, the
very name of CHARLEs DickeNs makes
immediate appeal to that national spirit
which the War has re-awakened.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Tommy (to his pal in middle of charge). “Look out, BILL.
YoUR Boorlace Is UNDONE!”
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THIS paragraph will, I hope, catch your eye in time to
be of use as a guide in the holiday fairy-tale traffix. But
at worst there are always birthdays or, for nursery gifts,
those even more apt occasions known as Nothing-in-par-
ticular Days. (Humpty-Dumpty, you remember, a recognised
authority, used to call them un-birthdays.) Anyhow, if
you should be looking about for something applicable to Kit
or Ursula, you may take my word that you will find noth-
ing better than The Dream Pedlar (SIMPKIN, MARSHALL).
The letterpress—I beg your pardon, I should have said the
“reading”—is by Lady MARGARET SACKVILLE, who has
clearly a pretty taste in fairy matters, and the pictures are
by FLORENCE ANDERSON in colour, and CLARA SHIRLEY
HAywaRD in black-and-white. I don't say that all these
are of equal merit, but the best of them are delightful.
Moreover, although in the modern sumptuous fashion the
colour plates are introduced on brown-paper mounts,
still they have the practical merit of being fixed, and
not merely gummed at one corner, a fashion that simply
results in litter for the nursery floor. The tales them-
selves are wholly-charming, and about quite the right
people, kings and woodcutters and dream-princesses and
goblins. Perhaps now and again Lady MARGARET falls to
the temptation of being a thought too clever with an aside,
so to speak, whispered in the ear of the reader-aloud. But
the wise child will forgive her this for the compelling
charm of her simplicities. For me, if I had a favourite in
the tales, it was perhaps Martin's godmother, “an attractive
old lady, short, with large fan-like ears, which she would
wave to and fro when amused.” There is an enchanting
where that picture would not soon bear the thumb-marks
of popularity.
Not a single word could be conveniently omitted from
Friends and Memories (ARNoLD), but I could easily spare
a great many of its notes of exclamation — nearly all
superfluous—for Miss MAUDE WALERIE WHITE's style of
writing needs no such advertisement. And having got rid
of that grumble I feel at liberty to express, without restraint,
my profound admiration of the book and its author. Never,
then, has it been my good fortune to read so many pages
that are filled with what I can only call the fragrance of
life. Sorrows and troubles Miss WHITE has known in
abundance—one often sees her smiling through a veil of
tears—but she steadfastly refuses to dwell upon anything
but the joy of living, and the kindness of her many friends.
This splendid way of regarding the world is one of the
qualities that has made her welcome and more than wel-
come wherever she goes; it is also the quality that gives
an almost unique distinction to her volume of reminiscences.
One can scarcely think of her as an eminent composer
whose songs have been heard throughout the world when
the gift, which she obviously values most and would her-
self call “priceless,” is that of being able to keep up a
cheerful end whatever happens. Her book, therefore, is
really both a tonic and a lesson, but it is a tonic that is as
delightful as good champagne, and it is a lesson that is full
of humour and of what is rarer than humour—good fun.
Even in her reticences Miss WHITE cannot save herself
from being amusing, for on her first page she refuses to tell
us her age, though afterwards she gives it away time and
again to anyone inquisitive enough to use a little arithmetic.
But she need have no fears, for she has the spirit of youth

picture of her doing it. I have not yet known the nursery
which can laugh at figures and defy the passing years.

The Bed-Book of Happiness is a “Colligation or Assem-
blage of Cheerful Writings,” colligated by Mr. HARold
BEGBIE, and published by Messrs. Hodden AND STOUGHToN.
It is a second edition, entitled the Red-Cross Edition, and it
offers itself as an anodyne for the pain and boredom of
wounded heroes. Said heroes, of average British pattern,
would, I think, receive a nasty shock on reading the title
and might be tempted to thiust the volume privily away
without more ado. But they need do no such thing; it is
nothing like so bad as that. On the contrary it is stuffed
with most excellent matter for the perceptive, in doses not
long enough to tire and with sufficient variety to stimulate.

from that other SAMUEL (CLEMENs); growls from that greatest

upon that score. The new book is called The Ways of Miss

“PUNCH." IN THE ENEMY'S TRENCHES.
[To the officer whose letter, reproduced in The Daily Telegraph, after
reporting the irregular exchange of Christmas gifts between our men
and the enemy, goes on to say :-"In order to put a stop to a situation
which was proving impossible, I went out myself after a time with a
copy of ‘Punch,' which I presented to a dingy Saxon in exchange for

(From Grand Admiral roN T11: Pitz.)
ALL GRAcious Lord-It is no pleasant life in these
days to be a sailor, especially if one happens to be an
Admiral responsible for the organisation and direction of a
great Fleet. This morning, for instance, just as I was
drinking my early cup of coffee there comes me in my
servant bearing a letter: “Will your Excellency have it
now 2" he says, “ or will you wait till you have gathered
more strength as the morning goes on ?” and with that the
old sea-dog smiles a just perceptible smile.
“Is it from — ?” I say, leaving out the name.
“Yes,” he answers, “it is from It is the seventh
in three days. It will assuredly be some pleasant wish
for the New Year. The Lord Great Admiral is, indeed,
fortunate in having so high a well-wisher. I myself have
no such luck, being only— ”
“It is enough,” I say, for I knew that he was about to tell
me once more that he was only a poor orphan and that his
driven him from his home many years ago. It is a long
story and he spares not the smallest detail in telling it,
nay, rather he takes delight in showing how, in spite of
his own worthiness, destiny has with express malice singled
him out from his fellows to be trodden upon at all those
moments when he had a right to look for ease and enjoy-
ment. This morning I was in no humour to listen to it,
so I ordered him to lay the letter down and to go about his
business. When he had departed I opened the letter,
which was a useless proceeding, for I already knew it was
from your all highest Self, and, without reading it, I could
have written down its contents word for word. Notwith-
standing this, I received the letter and read it with the
respect that is due to such a communication, and I now
proceed in all humility to answer it.
And first I will tell your Majesty that what you ask I
cannot promise to do. You want me to provoke a fleet action
under the best conditions so that we may be sure of smashing
up the British and securing eternal glory for ourselves.
These things are, no doubt, splendid, but they are not done ||
by waving a wand. In securing conditions the enemy also |
has something to say, especially when he is much stronger ||
than we are, so much so that, wherever we can put one
ship, he can put at least two ships of equal power. And
sailors have to consider the sea, the wind, the fog and a
thousand other things that the landsman cannot under-
stand. To bombard Scarborough and Whitby and to kill
women and children may be all very well for once in a
way, but even for that once it was not so glorious a feat
that your Majesty will wish to inscribe it amongst the
battle-honours of our Navy. I may whisper to your
Majesty, moreover, that in face of a brave and resourceful
foe these showy excursions are not without risk, and it
was only by the skin of their teeth that your ships escaped
into home waters after they had flung their shells into the
two undefended coast-towns.
Next, you want your foreign commerce restored. I can-
not do that. It is a misfortune of war that if your enemy
has a bigger fleet he can wipe away your foreign trade. If
your Majesty did not wish it to be so it would have been
better not to go to war. I presume your Majesty couldn't
wait, lest the Russians should construct strategic railways
and the French provide themselves with boots (which I
understand they have now procured in great quantities),
but there it is; and after all we might not have been better
off for waiting, since these English rascals showed a most
bloodthirsty determination always to have a bigger Fleet
than ours, no matter what we did. And so our poor
commerce must have disappeared in any case. For an
Empire like ours that is, I am informed, a great misfortune,
though, for my own part, it has not hitherto affected me.
On the other hand the scattering of ships like the Emden
and voN SPEE's squadron, in order to destroy the enemy's
commerce has only led to one conclusion, and that has
been the bottom of the sea. All this is vexing, but it must
be endured, and an occasional success with a submarine,
though agreeable at the moment, does not substantially
alter it.
Finally, as to the Russian Fleet, how, I ask, can we be
expected to gain a victory over ships which hide themselves
away in the Baltic in so mean a manner, and show no
desire for the delight of battle? They have no conscious-
ness of the fact that war-ships were intended for warfare.
Your Majesty is good enough to impute blame to me.
Some part of this, I do not doubt, belongs to me. The rest,
as is right, I will pass on to poor old INGENoHL, and to
Prince HENRY, and shall ask them to guess whence it
originally came.

And first I will tell your Majesty that what you ask I

Majesty, moreover, that in face of a brave and resourceful
foe these showy excursions are not without risk, and it
was only by the skin of their teeth that your ships escaped
into home waters after they had flung their shells into the

Next, you want your foreign commerce restored. I can-
not do that. It is a misfortune of war that if your enemy
has a bigger fleet he can wipe away your foreign trade. If
your Majesty did not wish it to be so it would have been
better not to go to war. I presume your Majesty couldn't

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LAST LINE.
VI.
OUR uniform—or, if that is too mili-
tary a word, our academical costume—
is officially announced to be “grey-
green,” the colour of the sea at 7.30 in
the morning, when you decide that you
have forgotten your towel and had
better have a hot bath quietly at home.
I don't know how, invisible we shall
be as soldiers, but anchored off the
Maplin Sands we should deceive any-
body. Where are the Buoys of the Old
Brigade? Ah, where indeed! Even as
marines we should have our value.
Luckily, we have been practising am-
phibious warfare for some time. The
camp is mostly under water, and when
the “Fall-in" is sounded we do it quite
easily. The “Emerge” is not so easily
obeyed. But there were drier days in
December, and on one of these I made
a curious discovery. -
We were having a field-day, and my
side of the battle was advancing in
sections under shell-fire over fairly flat
country. Every now and then, how-
ever, we came to a small hill or group
of hills. There seemed to be no
human reason for it, and I suggested
to my section that we were on the
track of some new kind of mole.
“No," said James, “those are
bunkers.”
We looked at each anxiously and
tapped our foreheads.
“It's a golf-course,” he persisted.
I could not allow dangerous talk of
this kind to go on.
“Silence in the ranks,” I said sternly.
A little later, when we were halted,
an old, old man, the Nestor of the
section, asked if he might speak to me.
“Certainly, my lad,” I said.
“I think he du be right,” he said,
indicating James; “I’ve heerd tell on
'un. Great-great-grandfayther used to
play.”
Another man said that he had seen
an old print of the game in a shop, but
he thought it was called Ludo.
And then, in a most curious way, I
had the sudden feeling that I myself
had played the game in some previous
existence—when I was a king in
Babylon, perhaps, and James was a
Christian caddie. It was most odd.
When we got back to camp, I spoke to
him about it.
“On Boxing Day, James,” I whis-
pered, “one might pursue one's re-
searches in this matter. I should like
to find out the truth about it. We
might meet at h’r’m To the left,
to two paces, ex-tend ?" I added this
loudly for the benefit of our platoon
commander who was passing, and
two paces to the front) withdrew
slowly into the darkness.
I won't refer to what happened on
Boxing Day; one does not talk about
these things. But I must tell you of
its unfortunate sequel.
Last week, in the course of a route-
march, we were suddenly turned on to
distance-judging. I had never done
this before, and a remote and lonely
tree, half-hidden in the mist, conveyed
nothing definite to me.
“What do you think?” I asked
James.
“A drive and a mashie, about.”
“S'sh,” I said warningly. However,
I determined to act on the suggestion.
Remembering Boxing Day I allowed
eighty yards for James's drive, and
thirty-five for a mashie off the socket.
Total, 115. It looked more, but the
mist was deceptive. However, when the
results were read out, the distance was
given as 385 yards, and James, if you
please, had said 350 !
Let us leave this painful subject and
turn to signalling. We are getting a
little more proficient. Every message
we send now starts properly with pre-
fix, service instructions, code time, and
so on, and the message itself gets in as
many hyphens, horizontal lines, frac-
tions and inverted commas as possible.
Here, for instance, is the beginning of
a thrilling message (sent to the Editor
of The Times) which I was receiving
last Sunday. - -
“Fore-warned being fore-armed
Lieut. Z. SMITHSON, 21st Foot on
the Przemysl - Rzeszow - Olkusz road,
with £39s. 74d. in his pocket (interest
on 54% DE BENTURES at 97–
brokerage ºth) proceeded at 9.25 P.M.
to —”
At this point the “Fall-in” sounded
and we had to stop. I never heard
what happened to Lieut. Smithson.
My own theory is that he murdered
Emma and put the blame on Lt.-Col.
St. George, D.S.O., who only had
three-and-a-half per cents, and had
never seen the girl before. Perhaps
the matter will be cleared up when the
War is over.
But it was a sad blow to us to be
told in a lecture that same afternoon
that despatch-riding has proved to be
much more useful than signalling at
the Front. It had an immediate effect
on James, and the advertisement in
The Times beginning “WANTED To
Exchange a pair of blue-and-white
silk flags (new) for motor-bicycle,” is
generally supposed to be his.
“And all the time I've spent on
signalling has been wasted,” he said
indignantly.
“Not wasted, James. Your silhouette
a wet day bright. Anyway, it's no
excuse for not coming to bayonet drill.
That won't be wasted.”
James made some absurd excuse
about wanting to improve his shooting
first.
“One is more independent with the
bayonet,” I assured him. “The
Government doesn't like us as it is,
and it's not going to waste much am-
munition on us. But once you’ve tied
the carving-knife on to the end of your
umbrella, there you are.”
“Well, I'll think about it,” said
James. -
But I have heard since that he had
already attended one class; and that
in the middle of it James the solicitor
advised James the sºldier not to pro-
ceed further with the matter.
“Your time,” said James the solici-
tor, “will be better spent on the range
—where you can lie down.”
And James the soldier made it so.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
LETTERS TO HAUPTMANN.
[GERHART HAUPTMANN, the German
dramatist and poet, has nominated
Lord CURzoN as Viceroy of England
when it becomes a German province.]
If you'd trample on the Briton
And secure his just abasement,
Well, I think you might have written
First to me.
(Signed) Roger CASEMENT.
If only as a recompense
For my expenditure of jaw
And anti-British “common-sense,”
Why not yours truly,
- BERNARD SHAw?
Would you avoid a bad rebellion ?
The man for you is
CHARLEs TREVELYAN.
Since all the Dublin Corporation
Protest against my resignation,
My long experience vice-regal
Might mollify the German eagle
If he should nest on College Green.
Yours amicably, - -
ABERDEEN.
Believe me, CURzoN's haughty hand
Would lie too heavy on the land;
No, to appease the British Isles
Appoint yours truly,
, WILLIAM BYLEs.
I fear the freedom-loving British
Under Lord CURzoN might grow
skittish ;
Far better knit the nations twain
Under a more pacific reign :
For instance, BRUNNER's; he's be-
yond
Reproach. Yours ever,
ALFRED Mond.
CURzoN, I own, is not a noodle,
But his demeanour is too feudal;
Try ALFRED Mond: he is a stunner,
Affectionately yours,
John BRUNNER.
As I am still without a seat,
I'm not unwilling to compete
For any post in which there's scope
To preach humanitarian hope.
You might, of course, secure else-
where
A smarter or a “faster” man,
But none in “uplift” could compare
With truly yours,
CHARLEs MASTERMAN.
ALONZO.
It was a bright Monday morning in
September, and I was doing my usual
patter dance in the dressing-room,
striving to defeat the time-table—ten
minutes for breakfast and five minutes
to get to the station.
I dipped hurriedly into the collar-
drawer, drew one forth, inverted it,
team) into the parting and proceeded
to secure the arrangement. The back
stud operated without comment, but
when I came to the front there seemed
to be an inch or two of collar missing.
At first I looked at it with mild sur-
prise, then the horrible truth flashed
through me.
I dashed into Joe's room.
“Look here,” I exclaimed, “just look
at my neck!”
Joe looked at it carefully for quite a
minute.
“Yes,” she remarked, “I think there
is a tiny spot under the left ear. You've
been drilling too much. You've been
dressing too much to the left.” -
“No 1 No!” I shouted, tugging at
the collar, “can't you see how swollen
it is 2 It's that complaint you get from
drinking chalky water. It's all your
fault! I've told you hundreds of times
to put a marble in the kettle.”
Joe unfastened the collar, looked at
it and laughed.
I snatched it back.
Inside there was a brief summary:
“Alonzo. Fourfold. 144.”
I take 16,
“That,” said Joe, pointing to Alonzo,
“must be the extra collar they sent
from the laundry last week.”
It was. Alonzo was a gift—a dona-
tion. Sleek, youthful and unsullied, he
came to us, bringing an air of tragedy
into the home.
Three times during that week I tried
to soil his glossy coat, and each time
a golden minute was shorn from my
breakfast. After that I put him in the
sock drawer.
At the end of the first week I said to
Joe, “Alonzo is bored, the society of
half-hose does not interest him. Send
him home.”
He was sent, and my wardrobe
settled itself peacefully.
On the following Monday I dipped
into the collar drawer, went through
the usual rites, and No, it didn't
really startle me. He had returned.
I put him in the sock drawer again.
Evidently he had plans of his
own. One week at the laundry and
one week at “Sunnyside,” alternating,
as it were, between taking the waters
and a rest cure.
I began to respect Alonzo, but at the
same time I felt he must be shown that
there is such a thing as authority. I

it myself, posted it myself, and wrote to

WE thought you fellows over there,
Before this all begun,
Was queer in talk, but acted fair,
And paid your way, and did your share
Of things as should be done.
You made a lot of trashy stuff,
And ate some. All the same,
You beat us some ways sure enough,
And seemed like pals, though brought
up rough,
For which you weren't to blame.
We reckoned when the trouble bust,
Remem'bring what you'd been,
You'd march to heel as you were
cussed,
And so you'd fight because you must,
But still you'd fight us clean.
But now you've worked us murder-hot ||
With filthy tricks you've played;
And whether you were bid or not
Is nought to us; we hate the lot
What ordered or obeyed.
And so you're not the pals we thought,
But foes, these rougher days;
We're out against you till you're
brought
To book, your Chief and you, and taught ||
To drop your bullying ways.
Now hear the truth. Your lives is

For reasons one and two :
HE draws his bright and shiny sword
To make him one and only Lord
Of all the world—and You.
And when your roofs is tumbling in,
Your heads is cracked and cooled,
You'll think the glory middling thin
And hate the lying cheats like sin
To see how you've been fooled.
By then it's odds you feel inclined
To state the view you take
In words that's not so sweet and kind
But what they'll let them War-Lords

HoRRoR of GERMAN GENERAL STAFF on READING THE Following ExTRACT FROM NoTEs of spy who, Disguised As A HIGHLANDER,
HAS BEEN ListENING NEAR BRITISH LINEs:—“WE GAVE 'EM wot 4 Not #.”
“THE IMAGE OF WAR.”
(It is reported that a pack of hounds has been sent out to
our Army in France, and in this connection it is recalled
that the Duke of WELLINGTON had also a pack sent to him
from England for the amusement of his officers in the
Peninsula.) - -
So Jarrocks has said, and the captains shall ride,
And a host of good fellows shall follow the fun,
With War, in its realness, a space put aside—
There's a fox in the spinney that once held a Hun;
There's a southerly wind and a wet sky and soft;
There's a respite to snatch, death and ruin amid;
Do not tongues in the woodland fling echoes aloft 2
Sounds the horn not as sweetly as ever it did?
When the DUKE and his armies, a hundred years back,
Went Southward a courtlier foeman to seek,
High Leicestershire lent him a galloping pack,
And his stiff-stocked brigades hunted two days a week;

And our grandfathers pounded in scarlet and blue,
And they hunted each rogue to his finish at last, |
And i. hunted old Box EY to famed Waterloo !

Well, dreamer or no, may his fortune be good;

THE following extracts
from official despatches ex-
changed between General von
Funkinstein and the German
Great General Staff have
been communicated to us by
a wholly impeachable author-
ity, and are published with
no reserve whatever:—
(1) From the General
Officer Commanding, &c.:—
“. . . with regard to vari-
ous recent regrettable inci-
dents in which sections of
the Imperial trenches have
been captured by native
troops from British India
troupes. Perhaps no soldiers in the
world, save our own incomparable
warriors, trained to withstand modern
German music, could have endured this
ghastly din without flinching. Before
long we observed a confused and
stealthy movement on our front; but
what was our emotion to see advancing
out of the mist not the expected native
charge, but a double line of trained
cobras. Despite the inevitable shock
produced by this discovery, energetic
steps were at once taken to deal with
the attack, and a brisk fire was opened
with hand grenades. The results were

(3) From Same as No. 1 :-
“Regret to convey further unfavour-
able development with regard to our
operations against the Jugglers' Corps.
Having tempted a large body of these
into open country some distance to
the rear of our original lines, I ordered
an attack in what should have been

at this stage entirely exposed to our

certed movement by their
entire strength, known (I be-
lieve) as the Mango Trick, re-
sulted in the appearance of a
dense grove of these trees, be-
hind which the enemy is at
present effectually screened.”
(4) From the same –
“Our treacherous foe has
again escaped us. An heroic
attack by the bayonet upon
the Mango Grove mentioned
in previous despatch was
successful in capturing the
position, but only in time to
see the last unit of the de-
fending force vanishing up

number of others was dan-

ment. The effect of this
renewed failure upon the
moral of the Imperial army
has unfortunately been con-
siderable. I learn from my
agents that the enemy is
now bringing up a number
of heavy hypnotists for use
against me personally.
Please wire instructions.”
(5) From the same as
(2):—
(which, according to the German official
programme, ought to have been in re-
volt long since) some light has now
been cast upon the probable reason for
this. Used as we now are to the con-
tempt for every rule of civilized war-
fare displayed by our detestable and
cowardly adversary, this new revelation
of his cunning and brutality will never-
theless come as a shock.
“Aircraft observation has now made
it clear that the force immediately
opposed to my command is not the
Horse, as was believed, but a
picked body of the First Indian
Jugglers, specially recruited for this
campaign. On the occasion of the
last attack we were startled about
5.30 A.M. by a prodigious and ear-
splitting noise proceeding from the

the reptiles, apparently mistaking the
hissing of the fuses for a challenge

alternative but to evacuate my position,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CLARIVARI.
THE watch DoGs.
XI.
MY DEAR CHARLEs, When you have
witnessed a military inspection, have
seen the Great Man going round the
companies and have heard his few kind
words to the victims of his scrutiny, no
doubt you have told yourself that a
soldier's life must be very smooth and
comfortable and his work as easy as
kiss-my-hand. If further you assume,
from the clock-like regularity of the
parade, that we must all be on very
good terms and intimate understanding
with each other, I feel bound to dis-
close the dismal facts.
The information that we were to be
inspected by our Great Man on the
Friday was handed to me, with the
soup, at Thursday's mess. I did not
appreciate its horrible significance and,
wondering why it should put the older
hands off their ration beef, I ate my
dinner in the usual manner, cracked a
jest or two with the slightly preoccupied
Adjutant and C.O., and later on strolled
down to my company's billet to inform
them that they would be inspected on
the morrow. I supposed they would
say to each other, “Oh indeed,” and
turn in to sleep; but I am credibly
informed that they had no bed that
night. -
On the following morning I was
dumbfounded by their dazzling appear-
ance and could not help remarking that
here at last was the Perfect Thing. I
was just sufficiently soldierlike, how-
ever, to examine them with an icy
disdain before we set out. En route to
the rendezvous, I pictured to myself
the Great Man's delight at beholding
us, his superlative admiration expressed
in a voice choked with affectionate
emotion, and his final jocular farewell
to myself—“As for your company,
my dear Henry, it's marvellous.”
I cannot record the actual event in all
its details, which were mostly bootlaces
and whiskers. The first I knew of the
trouble was a face so ominous as to
divert attention even from a splendid
uniform. Such was the look in the
inspecting eye that, had I been my own
master, I should have bowed as lowly
as to Allah, and said, “Your Highness,
I regret that urgent business at the Bank
compels the instant departure of myself
(with my company),” and we should
have been gone at the double before he
had gathered the gist of my remark.
As it was, I had to stand fast and
pretend that we were all very glad to
see him and hoped he would make a
long stay with us.
At about the third man he stopped
dead, very dead, and called my attention
whiskers and no boot-laces. What had
I to say to that 2 I might have said,
“So he is, Sir, now I come to look at
him. He should, of course, have been
all boot-laces and no whisker,” or
merely, “Well, I never !” or, again,
with some truth, “As to his laces, Sir,
they were there a minute ago but have
just fallen out of his boots; and the
hair has all grown on his face while
you and I were saluting each other
just now.” Instead I was mute by the
visitation of Heaven and we passed on,
to pause at No. 8, whose feet and face
also were by now all that they should
not be.
Again I was called upon for a speech
—in vain. You will notice, Charles, that
Brigadiers and Colonels are poltroons
at these times; they push the com-
pany-commander into the forefront
of the battle and skulk behind his
back. -
The Great Man interrupted his exam-
ination to chat with his A.D.C., mainly,
I fancy, about whiskers and bootlaces.
Being also interested in the subject, I
took the opportunity to look along my
company and see (believe me or not, as
you please) the whiskers coming into
existence and the laces going out. . . .
I gathered later that things were much
the same with every company in the
brigade. The Brigadier gathered this
also, but at once and from the Great
Man.
That night the Brigadier sent for our
C.O. The next morning our C.O. sent
for us. In due sequence we sent for
our section-commanders, and what was
leſt of them, when we had finished,
went to interview the private. The
last-named, having no one to whom to
express his contempt, utter loathing
and devilish intentions for the future,
adopted the only alternative and took
the necessary action.
The news of a second inspection
reached me a week in advance, during
which I took no food because I was
left no time and had no appetite. It
was a gloomy period, which was relieved
only by two small incidents. The one
took place at the C.O.'s inspection, and
I will call it “The Private and the
Toothbrush.” Asked why it was so
black, he replied that he cleaned his
teeth with permanganate of potash,
thus defeating the little crowd inspect-
ing him, since none knew whether that
chemical could be used for cleaning
teeth and, if it could, whether it would
turn the brush black. The other I will
call “The Memo. of the Transport
Officer,” who was so upset by what
was said to him that he “begged to
certify that he had that day purchased
3 new altars for his Transport service.”
cheer me up a little, and I am author-
ised to divulge it to you.
The week clapsed in a hurricane of
harsh oaths, and again I paraded my
company. Upon examination it now
appeared to me to be the most revolt-
ingly untidy and deficient sight I had
ever seen, an opinion heartily endorsed
by the Adjutant, C.O. and Brigadier.
En route to the rendezvous this time
I pictured nothing to myself; I merely
shifted my service revolver to a position
from which I could more easily destroy
myself in an emergency . . . . And
when the Great Man approached he
smiled at me, and no sooner had he
remarked to his A.D.C. that the buttons
and bayonets of the brigade did credit
to all concerned than those stolidly
dull buttons of mine brightened up and
bayonets grew where before there had
been empty and depressed scabbards.
I don't know exactly what the Great
Man said to the Brigadier, but expect
it was much the same as the C.O. said
to us and we to the section-commanders.
I doubt if the section-commanders said
anything nice to the private, but no
doubt the latter knew by instinct that
this was an occasion upon which he
might with impunity, but only once in
a way, step slightly aside from the
straight and narrow path. I guess,
my dear Charles, that it is only the
second inspection to which you, as
representing the ignorant public, are
invited.
The forty-eight hours' leave (by way
of reward or for convalescence) which
ensued I spent with my wife. With
feminine perversity she at once started
inspecting my moustache, one of the
most astonishing productions of these
astonishing times. “Say what you
please now,” said I, quite imperturb-
able. “At the next inspection you'll
find yourself remarking that it is the
best disciplined and equipped moustache
you have ever seen.” And so it is.
Yours ever, HENRY.

[JANUARY 13, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MY EVE LION.
I MUST confess that I was finding it
rather galling to have no friends at all
at the Front. Everyone else was so
well furnished with these acquaintances,
often actually relations. But I had
no one I knew, although gradually one
by one my clerks joined KITCHENER's
Army and passed to various training
grounds, returning (in my opinion far
too often) to the office in their uniforms
to disturb the routine and waste the
time of the others. Some drilling and
instruction I am assured go on in
these camps, but I see in London every
day sufficient English soldiers to drive
twice the present number of Germans
out of Belgium—if they really meant it.
My point, however, is that, for far
too long there was no one at the Front,
either living, dead or wounded, with
whom I could claim any intimacy, and
this is the kind of thing which does not
do a man any good on his way to and
back from the City. ,
Everyone else in my morning and
evening trains has had friends at the
Front ever since we sent out our first
draft, and to me their talk about them
has been extremely galling. Some of
them have even had letters from them,
and these are either read or paraphrased
and have enormously sent up the stock
of the recipients. In fact several men
whom I know to be very shaky in busi-
ness, and others who have been rather
blown upon on account of their general
bounderish demeanour, have established
themselves in improved social positions
wholly through letters from the Front.
There are people, of course, who, not
having a soldier friend, would invent
one; but that is not my way. I would not
do that. For one thing, I should have
great difficulty in keeping it up. It
would mean studying the map, reading
all the reports and knowing more about
the army than I have time to learn.
Imagine then my delight and excite-
ment when I opened the evening paper
a day or so ago, and found that the
hero of the dashing and perilous feat of
which everyone was talking, and which
resulted in the capture of many Germans
and machine guns, was no other than
the son of my old friend Wargrave. I
had not seen Wargrave for some years,
but we met often once, and on my last
visit to him his son had been home
from school, and I now remembered
how fine a lad I had thought him. He
had a fearless eye and a high spirit;
he was, in fact, the very stuff of which
bold warriors are made. There was no
doubt about his identity either, for a
personal paragraph in the paper stated
who his father was.
sat down at once and wrote a congratu-
latory note to Wargrave senior; and on
my way to the station I thought of
other things in connection with his
brave son which I might never have
called to mind but for this deed of
prowess: what a good appetite he had
had ; how he had climbed a tree for
cherries; how he had torn his clothes;
and how tedious I had found his addic-
tion to what was called a water-pistol.
“Good old Clifford ' ''-that was his
name. Lieut. Clifford Wargrave, I
said to myself, and my heart beat the
faster for having known him.
That evening the only man that
I knew in my carriage coming home
was Barrington, and naturally I said
something to him about the gallant
son of my old friend. Barrington is
not a man that I ever liked, and my
young people say contemptuous things
of his family as a whole. One of the
daughters, however, is rather pretty,
but I should not care to confess this at
my own table. It is as dangerous to
tell some girls about the prettiness of
others as to tell some people that they
look well. Anyway, since Barrington
was there, I mentioned to him that it
was gratifying to me to think that my
old friend's son had become such a public
hero, and I recollected as I was talk-
ing, and mentioned too, certain further
incidents in the young fellow's boyhood.
We once bathed together in Cornwall,
I remembered, and I am not sure that
it was not I who taught him to swim.
At another time we had been on a pic-
nic and I had made him and his sister
laugh a good deal by my jokes—poor
simple things, no doubt, but tickling to
him. “And no doubt he is the same
simple follow now,” I said, “always
ready to laugh and be merry.” I told
Barrington also about the cherries and
the torn clothes, and what a good
appetite he had ; and about the water-
istol.
“Odd to think that that boy should
grow into a hero,” I said. “How little
we can read the future ' "
“Yes, indeed,” said Barrington.
I don't know why, but talking about
this young friend of long ago, now so
illustrious, to Barrington, made me
quite to like the man, and I even went
out of my way to accompany him to
his gate.
I am wiser now. I now know that
it is a mistake ever to change one's
opinion of a man. And the extra-
ordinary pettiness of human nature
the paltry little varieties of it ! the
straws it will clutch at to support its
self-esteem l
The next morning, owing to some
delay over breakfast, I was a little late
usual seat among my usual set. I
managed just to scramble into a carriage
and subsided into the far corner with
my paper well before my face because
I did not want to be sociable in that
company. One has to be careful. Just
as the train started, in dashed Barring-
ton and took the only seat leſt—in fact
there was not really room for him. He
did not see me.
The train had not left the station
before one of the men remarked upon
the heroism of young Wargrave; when
to my astonishment and annoyance
Barrington at once took him up.
“Ah! yes,” he said. “Such a fine
young fellow; I always knew he would
do something like that.” , ,
“Then you know him?” he was
asked.
“Well, I don't say that I exactly
know him,” he said, “but I used to
hear a lot about him from one of the
most intimate friends of the family.”
And one by one he told all my little
anecdotes—trivial enough when in the
mouth of a stranger, but, coming from
one who knew, interesting and import-
ant. Will you believe it, Wargrave
lasted Barrington and his idiotic lis-
teners all the way to London—my
Wargrave, mind, not his at all ! And
the way they listened I personally sat
hidden, and fumed but said nothing.
How could I suddenly claim Wargrave
as my own without being ridiculous?
Nor would they have believed me.
Besides, to put myself in competition
with Barrington . . . .
I managed to elude Barrington's
eye at the terminus, and sought my
office in a state of fury and contempt.
At lunch I was again baulked, for none
of my regular companions were there.
It was beginning to be ridiculous. I
might as well have not known the
Wargraves at all.
That evening I was very carefully
early for my train, determined that I
would score then. My own set should
now know first-hand what my associa-
tion with the young hero was. After
all, what did those others matter?
But here again I had been forestalled.
“I met that man Barrington at
lunch,” said one of my neighbours,
“and he was most interesting about this
young Wargrave. Knew lots of things
about his boyhood. Often stayed there.
A ripping boy it seems he was. Really,
Barrington's not such a bad chap when
you get to know him. I think we must
have him in our carriage now and
then. He was most modest about it."
“Did Barrington say that Lieut.
Wargrave was a friend of his?" I
asked.
“Oh, yes. No doubt about it; Bar-
I was so pleased about it all that I

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Is not Come out To Play (CoNSTABLE) a delightful title
for a story? And, believe me, not better than the story
itself, which I should call, save for one defect, a perfect
masterpiece in miniature. To have done with blame, I will
say at once that the defect is the end, which, to my thinking
at least, seems both inartistic and cowardly. I can hardly
explain my meaning more clearly without spoiling your
enjoyment. But I will hint that this tragedy of un-
fulfilled promise (for the book is a tragedy, though concealed
beneath a surface merriment) seemed too delicate for so
melodramatic a climax. Miss M. E. F. IRwiN writes with
an ease and finish that is amazing. She has form, too,
and a quite unusual beauty of style that gives to her work
something that is very difficult to analyse. The book is the
story of a boy called Truffles (which of course was not his
real name), a boy with a long white face and dark eyes
under heavy lids that gave him the look of Pierrot. Nothing
very special happens in his life. He has a genial spend-
thrift father, a prig of an elder brother, a rather jolly sister
and a host of admiring friends. And the lot of them drift
along in the artificial comedy of London existence in peace-
time, flirting and idling, working and loving, all a little
self-consciously; setting their emotions for the most part
to an accompaniment of popular comic songs, those vacuous
jingles whose light-heartedness Time so quickly turns to
a wistful and poignant melancholy. You will gather that
the actual story is no great matter. It is the faintly
the very few to which the misused adjective “beautiful” can
honestly be applied. Perhaps in reading it you may be
reminded, as I was, of another modern novel, one that was
praised greatly in these pages and has leapt since to fame.
I name no names, because I am far indeed from charging
Miss IRwin with imitation. The more present-day writers
who can display this same sensitive and compelling charm,
the better I shall be pleased.
The perfect children's-book must be one of the most
difficult things in the world to write. The qualities it
would demand are so varied and the dangers so many.
You must, for example, be just sentimental enough to obtain
sympathy, yet never so much as to invite suspicion of being
sloppy. There must be adventure for the adventurous,
colour for the romantic and magic for everybody. Frankly
I cannot say that Mr. H. DE WERE STAcpoolE has achieved
the ideal; but in Poppyland (LANE) he has certainly strung
together a number of stories that most children are sure to
like. I fancy their favourite will be “The Little Prince,” a
story in which all the right things happen—beggar girls
turn out to be Countesses, and handsome Princes suffer a
strictly temporary decline into beggary—and all in an
agreeable Neapolitan setting, which, as the advertisements
say, “will appeal to children of larger growth.”. With his
fairies Mr. STAcpoolE is, to my thinking, a degree less
successful. The worst of tales about storks and magic
gardens and cripple-boys and the like is that, however
freshly you set forth, sooner or later you are sure to find
yourself in the foot-prints of the old wizard of Denmark.

better appreciated certain tales in this collection that
inevitably recalled him. Still, the whole is pleasant enough.
I wish I could say also that I liked the illustrations, but,
with exceptions, these seemed to me both ugly and pre-
tentious. The best exception was one of the old stork, a
delightful piece of colour for the sake of which I can almost
forget some of the others.
Miss MACNAUGHTAN always writes very charmingly and
with plenty of humour, and in dedicating A Green English-
man (SMITH, ELDER) to “My Canadian friends” she must,
I think, be too unconscious of her powers, for this collection
of stories is far from being a valuable endorsement of the
flowery praises of the emigration bureaux. Very little
hope is held out to the young man of good family who
is a gentleman and something of a sportsman, and pro-
poses to pick up gold on the pavements or the prairies of
the West. I do not mean that the writer is ungenerous
either to the Dominion or to its people, but she takes no
pains to conceal the terror that lives with the beauty of its
vast spaces, and she does not represent the struggle to
“make good” as altogether a lovely thing. Perhaps the
most ambitious of these T-
sketches, certainly the
one which conforms most
nearly to the “short
story” model, describes
the fate of a clergyman's
daughter who pays a
visit to Macredie, “some-
where on the C. P. R.
line,” and marries a
farmer and land-specu-
lator, chiefly because this
is her last chance of
marrying at all. The
horror of the silence and
the snow, when her
husband leaves her to
face a Canadian winter
alone, because he has
business in England, - --
eventually drives her mad; and though most of the stories
are in a lighter vein than this, and there is plenty of the
humorous sentiment in which Miss MACNAUGHTAN excels,
the moral that I draw from the book as a whole is, “Visit
Canada by all means, but, unless you are a Scotchman of
the very doggedest type, don't stay there.”

The hiding of lights under bushels may be all very well
in private life, but is misplaced in the book-publishing
business. I thoroughly disapprove of the title and the
outside cover of the Hon. Mrs. Dow DELL's latest collection
of leisurely essays, Joking Apart (DUCKworth). The one
suggests a heart-to-heart talk on the things that matter
or else an outburst of boisterous farce, while the other is
merely dismal. The two together are enough to put the
public off a really gocd thing. Mrs. Dowd BLL treats of
the domestic and social side of feminine life in that peculiar
vein of humour which is neither joking nor yet joking
apart; her writing reminds me of those least-to-be-forgotten
evenings of my life when I have been lucky enough to
listen for hours to a real pucker conversationalist in the
best of spirits and at the top of his form. The words that

The Honourable Percival (HopDER AND Stoughton) may
at least claim to have established a record in one respect.
I think I never met a full-sized novel with a more slender
plot. The Honourable Percival Hascombe, on a pleasure

love with her. This, I give you my word, is all there is of

The Honourable Percival. This record of a shipboard
romance is done with the daintiest art, delicate, tender,
humorous, and not (as is the fault with so many American
romances) oversweetened. The development of Percival
from a priggish misanthrope to a man and a lover is beau-

lies in its setting, a series of cinemascopic views of the

bered that all the big walks started from the political end,
so as I did not wish to assume any superiority which I
did not strictly possess I took the tram to Westminster.
There I alighted and was about to set off over Westminster
Bridge when it occurred to me that I hadn't had any tea.
To route-march on an empty stomach was, I felt sure, the
height of folly. I therefore repaired to a tea-shop in the
vicinity, where I encountered young Pilkington. We dis-
cussed KITCHENER and crumpets, training and tea, the
KAISER and cake, and with a little adroitness I managed to
bring in the subject of the medicinal value of route-marching.
When I rose to go Pilkington inquired my destination.
“Norbury,” I told him.
“That's lucky,” he said; “I shall be able to give you
a lift in a taxi as far as Kennington.”
In vain I expostulated with him, and urged that I was
route-marching, not route-cabbing. But he wouldn't listen.
“Anyhow,” he concluded, “it’s most dangerous to march
just after a crumpet tea. Haven't you read your ‘Infantry
Training' 2"
The upshot of the matter was that we taxied to Kenning-
ton, where at last I managed to leave him. And then I
began to feel tired. True, I hadn't done any marching,
but it was none the less true that I felt as tired as if I
had. However, I succeeded in struggling on for about
fifty yards (to the tune of HANDEL's Largo), and then I
boarded a tram. It had only proceeded a quarter-of-a-mile
or so when the current failed and we all had to get out.
I waited half-an-hour for a fresh batch of current to
arrive, but none came, and I realised that my best course
would be to walk to Brixton Station and procure a cab.
Accordingly, to the melody of “I don't expect to do it
again for months and months and months,” I put my best
foot foremost. It was a moot point which of my two feet
merited this distinction; they both felt deplorably senile.
Then it began to rain—no mere niggardly sprinkling, but a
lavish week-end cataclysm. I reached the station in the
condition known to chemists as a saturated solution, only
to find that there was not a cab on the rank. I was there-
fore compelled to adopt the only means of transport left to
me—to route-march home .
I ultimately staggered in at my gate at an advanced
hour of the evening to the strains of the opening bars of
TschAIKowsky's Pathetic Symphony, whistled mentally.
I was far beyond making the actual physical effort.
That night I wrote a postcard to Petherby. It ran as
follows:—" Have just completed your course of treatment.
I resolved to start the treatment the following Saturday
Am cured.”

GRAVE and serene, though young at
heart,
“The Doctor,” so his boys address him,
And rightly, since his healing art
Has made full many a mourner bless
him—
For close on twenty years has served
An ancient church renowned in story,
And never in his teaching swerved
From studying God's greater glory.
IIis choir, like every singing school,
By turns angelic and demonic,

That is both “dominant” and “tonic;”
For contact with so rare a mind
Has seldom failed to spur and raise

And when they shirk their needſul grind
With just rebuke he turns and flays
them.
Withal he knows that human boys
Are dulled by industry unending,
And unreservedly enjoys
Himself at seasons of unbending;
A diet of perpetual Psalms
Is only fit for saints and Dantes,
And so he varies BACH and BRAHMs
With simple tunes and rousing
His taste is catholic and sane;
He does not treat as worthless lumber
All MENDELssohn, or Spohr disdain,
Or let the works of HANDEL slumber;
He likes to keep Church music clear
From operatic frills and ribbons,
And never ceases to revere
TALLIS and PURCELL, BYRD and
GIBBoNs.
And thus he wisely neither aims
At showing off his erudition,
Nor for his choir and organ claims
A prima donna-like position;
He sees no virtue in mere speed,
With sentiment he scorns to palter,
And gives his most especial heed
To the clear chanting of the Psalter.
He loves his organ far too well
To be o'er-lavish with its thunder,
Yet wields at will the magic spell
That moves our hearts to awe or
wonder;
Three centuries have lent its keys
All that consoles, inspires, rejoices,
And with a calm consummate ease
He blends the new and ancient
voices.
And in these days when mothers mourn,
When joy is fled and faith is shaken,
When age survives bereſt, forlorn,
He draws from music's soul divine
A double magic, gently pleading
With grief its passion to resign

They owe to their belovèd master.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RECRUITER.
MADINGLEY is one of those men who
are always asking you to do things
for them. He will send you cheerfully
on the top of a bus from the City to
Hammersmith to buy tobacco for him
at a particular little shop, and if you
point out that he could do it much
better in his own car, he says reproach-
fully that the car is only used for busi-
ness purposes. (If so, he must have a
good deal of business at Walton Heath.)
“Isn't your cousin a doctor 2 " he'll
say. “I wonder if you'd mind asking
him. And somehow you can't
refuse. He beams at you with such
confidence through his glasses.
However, it was apparently to tell
me news that he came to see me the
other day.
“I'm horribly busy,” he said. “The
fact is I'm going to enlist.”
“They won't take you,” I said.
“You're blind.”
“Not so blind as you are.”
“Put it that we're both blind, and
that our King and Country want
neither of us.”
“Well, I'm not so sure. There are
lots of people with spectacles in the
Army.”
“And lots of flies in amber,” I said,
“but nobody seems to know how they
came there.”
Then Madingley got to business.
His partner, who had enlisted in
August, had developed lung trouble
and had returned to civil life. Mading-
ley was now free to go. He had heard
| from a friend that the 121st Rifles (a
Territorial Regiment) had no conscien-
tious objections to spectacles. Would
I—(I thought it must be coming)–
would I go and find out for him 2 He
gave me the address of their head-
quarters.
“You see I'm so horribly busy, old
chap—clearing up at the office, and so
on.”
Well, of course I had to. Mading-
ley's attitude of pained forgiveness, iſ
one refuses him anything, is more than
I can bear. Alter all, it didn't seem
very much to do.
I began with the sentry outside.
“Can you tell me " I said plea-
santly. He scowled and jerked his head
towards the door. I went in and tried
another man. “Can you tell me ! -
I began. “Enlist 2" he said. “Up-
stairs.” I went upstairs and pushed
open a door. “Can you tell me x 1.
I said. “This is the canteen,” answered
a man in an apron . . .
At last I found a sergeant. “Enlist?”
he said briskly. “Come in.” I went in.
He leant against a table and I smiled
“I just wanted to ask,” I said,
“whether p :
“Quite so,” he said, and gave me a
long explanation of what my pay would
be now that I had decided to join the
Army. He began with the one and a
penny of a private and was working up
towards the stipend of a Field Marshal
when I stopped him.
“One moment—'

ried.”
“Y—yes,” I said. “At least, no,”
I added, thinking of Madingley.
“Surely you know 2 " he asked in
surprise.
I remembered suddenly the penalty
for a false declaration. It would be
no good explaining afterwards that I
meant Madingley.
“Yes,” I said. “Married.
He told me what my separation
allowance would be . . . As a married

I decided to be firm.
“Er—I mustn't trouble you too
much,” I said. “I really only wanted
to know if you take men with spec-
tacles.”
“Depends how short-sighted you
are. Do you always wear them 2"
“No, but I ought to really.” I made
a desperate effort to get Madingley
back into the conversation. “I really
only came to find out for a * >
“Ah, well, the best thing you can
do,” said the sergeant, “is to pass the
medical examination first. You can sign
the papers afterwards. Come along.”
I followed him meekly downstairs.
It was obviously not Madingley's after-
no On.
We plunged downstairs into what
was no doubt the anti-Zeppelin cel-
lar. Through the gloom I saw dimly
two or three pink-and-white figures
waiting their turn to be thumped.
Down the throat of a man in the
middle of the room a doctor was trying
to climb. Mechanically I began to
undo my tie.
The sergeant spoke to one of the
doctors and then came back to me.
“It'll save time if we do your sight
first,” he said. “Stand over in this
corner.”
I stood in the corner . . .
For a long time nothing happened.
“Well ?” said the sergeant im-
patiently.
“Well ?” I said.
“Why don't you read?”
“What? Have we begun ?” I asked
in surprise. I couldn't see anything.
The medical officer came over to me
and in a friendly way put his hand
over my left eye. It didn't help much,
“You're mar-
gathered that the card must be in that
direction. Gradually it began to loom
through the blackness.
“Wait a moment,” I said. I re-
moved his hand and gazed keenly at
the opposite wall. “That's a B,”
I announced proudly. “That top
one.”
The doctor and the sergeant looked
at each other.
“It's no good,” sighed the sergeant.
“He can't even read the first two
lines,” groaned the doctor.
“It's all very well for you two,” I
broke in indignantly; “one of you lives
down here and is used to it, and the
other knows the card by heart. I
haven't come to enlist for night opera-
tions only. Surely your regiment does
things in the daylight sometimes?”
The doctor, only knowing about the
daylight by hearsay, looked blank; the
sergeant repeated sadly, “Not even the
first two lines.”
“Look here,” I said, “ lend me the
card to-night and I'll come again to-
morrow. If it's only two lines you
want, I think I can promise you them.”
The doctor said mournfully that he
might lend me the card, but that in
that case it would be his painful duty
to put up a different card for me on the
next day.
There seemed to be nothing more to
say. I was about to go when a face
which I recognised emerged from the
gloom. It had a shirt underneath it
and then legs. The face began to grin
at me.
“Hallo,” said a voice.
“Hallo, Rogers,” I said: “you en-
listing? I thought you couldn't get
leave.” Rogers is in the Civil Service,
and his work is supposed to be impor-
tant.
“Well, I haven't exactly got leave—
yet," he said awkwardly. “The fact
is, I just came here to ask about a
commission for a friend, and while I
was here I–er—suddenly decided to
risk it. You know Madingley, by the
way, don't you?”
“I used to think so,” I said.
But now I see that there is more in ||
Madingley than I thought. His job
in this war is simple — and exactly
suited to himself. By arrangement
with the War Office he sends likely
recruits to make enquiries for him—
and the sergeant does the rest.

THE INVASION.
BETweBN Mortimer and us yawns a
great gulf, bridged by many flights of
stairs. Even on the illuminated board
at the foot of the lowest stairs we still
keep our distance, but with this
difference, that while Mortimer's posi-
tion in the world is higher than mine,
on the board I stand above him by as
many names as there are stairs be-
tween us.
Mortimer first floated into my orbit
ore day when we both met in the
porter's lodge to complain about the
dustbin. Even after this I should have
gone contentedly down to my grave
with no further knowledge of the man
than that he had a wife and four
children. I knew that because I heard
him tell the porter so.
One evening after dinner–it seems
now many moons ago—Clara, our lady-
help, threw open the drawing-room
door and in startled tones announced
Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer. Prompt to
the word of command in they marched,
followed by the four youthful Morti-
mers. Each of these latter clutched a
sponge-bag and an elusive bundle of
flannel, and in the background loomed
the Mortimer maid-of-all-work.
Mortimer began to talk immediately
and said that of course we had seen the
War Office order that on the first
sound of guns all Londoners were to
make for the cellars. Mrs. Mortimer
was certain she had heard firing and
that the Zeppelin raid had begun, so,
like good citizens, the family had
hastened to comply with the regula-
tions.
“We shan't put you to any incon-
venience,” said Mortimer volubly. “The
children can curl up in the spare room
and my wife and I will do with a shake-
down in the passage. In time of war
one must be prepared for discomfort.
Think of the poor fellows in the
trenches.”
IHere Mrs. Mortimer murmured some-
thing inarticulate.
“Oh, yes, of course,” Mortimer as-
sented, “Emma must be made comfort-
able.”
All this time my wife and I had not
been able to say a word, Mortimer's
plausibility and the spectacle of the
four little Mortimers and their sponge-
bags having robbed us of speech and
thought. Jane was the first to find her
voice, and managed to gasp out that
we had heard no guns.
“You wouldn't, of course, in the-er
—down here,” said Mortimer. I was
glad to notice him hesitate this time
over the word “cellar ’’ as applied to
our artistic home.
ing,” he went on kindly; “it is embar-
rassing to discuss household arrange-
ments in public,” and with a flourish
of his arm, he marshalled his family
and swept them out of the room, care-
fully shutting the door behind him.
Jane and I gazed awestruck at each
other.
“We can't turn them away,” said
my wife. “Those five pairs of eyes
would haunt me all night (Mortimer's
and Emma's were, I presume, the ones
omitted), and if the Zeppelins did come
to-night how awful we should feel.”
“We must be firm about it being
only for to-night, then,” I said. “We
must consider Kate.” (Kate is our
cat.)
So it was arranged that we should
give up our room and that Emma
should share with Clara. I found the
Mortimer family sitting in a crowded
row on the antique bench in the hall,
like players at dumb-crambo waiting
for the word. Briefly I told them it
was “stay.” They all jumped up;
Mortimer shook me cordially by the
hand, and I believe Mrs. Mortimer
kissed my wife.
True to the compact the refugees
departed next morning, and we saw the
last little Mortimer disappear upwards
with unmixed relief. They were all
back again, however, the following
evening, this time encumbered with
more articles towards “camping out.”
The expression was Mortimer's, not
mine. -
On the fourth evening Mortimer took
me aside and told me confidentially
that he could see this state of things
was telling on us as much as on them,
and that he thought the best plan would
be for our two households to “chum
together” while the Zeppelin menace
lasted. (What fool said the war was
going to last three years?) Never
waiting for a reply, Mortimer went on
to say that it really would not be so
much trouble as it seemed at the first
shock. He and I would be out all day,
which would even up the numb3rs, and
Emma would, of course, help. I much
resented being estimated as equal to
three-and-a-half Mortimers and had no
delusions about Emma's helpfulness,
but Mortimer's volubility had its usual
stupefying effect. He carried the
motion to his own satisfaction, and
my wife told me that I behaved like
an idiot.
We stood three days of this lunatic
ménage. Every evening on returning
from office I found more alien belongings
blocking up my home. Mortimer boots
strewed the scullery, their coats smoth-
ered the hat-stand, their toothbrushes
filled the bathroom. Clara is a noble-
her glance, and my wife was ageing
before my eyes. Kate too had left us.
On the third evening when I came
home I found a note sticking in the
hall clothes-brush. “Meet me in the
pantry,” it said. I flew to the rendez-
vous, where Jane received me with her
finger on her lip. Dragging me in,
she managed with difficulty to close
the door—our pantry is what you
might call bijou-and, leaning against
the sink, she unburdened her mind.
“I have an idea,” she hisscd. “Over-
come by superior numbers, we must
evacuate the position. Better one
Zeppelin once than six Mortimers for
ever. Let us take possession of their
flat, as they have of ours.”
It was a masterly and superb idea,
worthy of the brain from which it
sprang. We hastened to impart it to
the Mortimers, who were sitting over
the drawing-room fire reading my even-
ing paper. They were much touched.
Mortimer said he should never forgive
himself if we were killed by bombs,
and Mrs. Mortimer said it made all
the difference our not having children.
We have now been settled for some
time in Mortimer's flat, and in many
ways prefer it to our own; in fact we
shall be quite content to remain here
as long as Mortimer continues to pay
the rent. We found Kate already in-
stalled. The sagacious animal evidently
adds prophetic instinct to her other
gifts. When she makes a decided move
downstairs we shall prepare for hostile
aircraft.

MY DEAR Mr. Punch, – We take
special pride in the fact that we were
the very first Territorials ever to land
in India. As our battalion swung
through the streets of Bombay before
the critical eyes of the assembled
natives, this knowledge enabled us to
preserve an air of dignity despite the
rakish angle of our unaccustomed

helmet you discover that the only pos-
sible position for the latter is well over
the right ear. Later on you realise
that this is a mistake, like most of the
discoveries made during the first few
days' residence in India.

Headquarters Office; to the Embarc-

Then came a lull, and I thought,
after all, I had escaped. I arose
happily at 5.30 A.M. I did many
various and strenuous fatigues. I
swept the barrack floor singing and
peeled potatoes with a joyful heart.
I polished my equipment incessantly
and greased my mess tin with the
greatest care. In short, I was rapidly
becoming a soldier.
And I obtained leave and went into
the town, where I saw much that
cheered me while the clerks T
were at their labours. I read
a sign in a restaurant win-
dow, “Breakfast, tiffin, tea,
dinner and all kinds of per-
fumery.” I saw six coolies
running along a main street
with a grand piano balanced
on their heads. I was very
happy while it lasted.
And then the blow fell.
We had thought that surely
overy possible office had been
filled with clerks, but we were
wrong as usual. As I was
going to bed one night there
came a peremptory order that
I was to be at the Divisional
Staff Office, four miles away,
sharp at eight o'clock next
morning. -
In conformity with my in-
structions I went forth next
morning to take up my new
and peaceful avocation in
full marching order, with
rifle, side-arm and twenty
rounds of ball ammunition.
Being a soldier clerk in
India is very different from

England. Here I work in

The clerk to whom it is handed thinks
it advisable to wire a reply, so he
writes at the foot, “Wire So-and-so,
telling him this-and-that?” initials it
and sends it to the Chief. The Chief
writes, “Yes, please,” initials it and
sends it back. The clerk then drafts
the actual telegram, initials the draft
and sends it to the Chief, who, if he
approves, initials it and sends it back.
The draft is next handed to a second
clerk, who, after due consideration,
types two copies and initials them.
These are taken to the Chief, who

brush off the ants which crawl affec-
tionately over my knees. At home—
well, I can imagine the Chief's face if
a clerk (or an ant) ventured into his
office with bare knees.
Also the methods adopted here are
not like our impetuous English ways.
Operations are carried out with a
morial East. Take a telegram for
example. At home the Chief says
rapidly, “Send a wire to So-and-so
telling him this-and-that.” A harassed
clerk snatches off the telephone-re-
ceiver, and in two minutes the message
is dictated to the post-office and the
incident is closed.
Not so here. A document comes
signs them and sends them back. One
copy is filed and the other goes to a
third clerk, who enters it verbatim into
a book and has the book initialled by
clerk No. 1, after checking. Then it
goes to a fourth clerk, who numbers it,
makes a précis in another book, and
hands it, with explanations, to a patti
wallah, who takes it outside to an
orderly, who conveys it (with un-
hasting dignity) to the post-office.
More of this, if you can bear it, in
my next. Yours ever,

Naval Notes.
A correspondent asks us what exactly
are the duties of the marines. We
have not space to give him an exhaus-
tive account of the work of these handy
men, but we can indicate their affec-
tionate nature by the following cutting
from The Liverpool Echo :—
“One notable case in which a decoration
was bestowed was of a young seaman, who at
tremendous risk to himself, freed a submarine
from a marine which had become attached to
it off Heligoland.”
Casual meetings off Heligoland are
responsible for many such romances.
Our correspondent's further enquiries
about the duties of the destroyer and
the torpedo we will let two other con-
temporaries answer:-
“Fourteen Roumanian destroyers from the
Austro-Hungarian army arrived at Sinaia,
Roumania, having crossed the Transylvanian
Mountains on foot.”—Bombay Chronicle.
“Newspapers state that a French torpedo
entered Dunkirk on Friday and reported
having rammed and sunk a German sub-
marine off Westende.”
In advertisement matters it is some-
times asserted that the right use of
type is the great thing. It is, however,
a relief to the writer that a certain an-
nouncement with an ironic suggestion
of reckless benevolence has now been
removed from most of the hostelries.
Yet it afforded instruction as to ring-
ing the changes upon the sizes of
type:—

[JANUARY 20, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE ENTERTAINERS.
I FEEL that I am entitled to speak with perfect freedom
of the entertainment lately given in our parish hall, for,
except as a spectator and as contributing several of the
performers to the programme, without myself knowing
anything about it beyond what rumour and the unwonted
bustling mystery of the household brought to my know-
ledge—except, as I say, in these points, I had rothing to
do with it. The whole thing was managed by an informal
committee of ladies, acting on the discovery that the School
Children's Meals Fund was at its last gasp, and required
replenishment in order to carry it on through the ensuing
year. Upon that the informal committee got to work and
held several meetings. Now the methods of a committee
of ladies differ from those of men. The ladies meet to-
gether in drawing-rooms and, so far as a casual observer
can judge, they discuss every subject except the particular
one for which they have been summoned. Then comes the
moment when they intimate to one another that they must
go, and they arise and draw slowly and reluctantly out
from the drawing-room through the hall to the front-door
step. Then, but never till then, just as they are about to
go away, they suddenly remember what they came for, and
in another five minutes the whole business is settled, and
they stream away with the consciousness of work satisfac-
torily done. It is an unceremonious method, but a highly
efficient one if judged by its results. In this particular
case it produced a delightful entertainment, which I may
describe as being by the children, for the children and of
the children, as well as of the elders who gathered together
to applaud the zeal and skill of the little performers.
Fortunately the appointed day was fine and there was a
great rush of spectators, who soon filled the hall to its
utmost capacity. The entertainment began with a tribute
to patriotism in the shape of tableaux vivants, all save one
selected from the storehouse of our kind old friend Mr.
Punch's cartoons. There, brilliantly and magnificently
accoutred, was seen Britannia setting out to war for friend-
ship and honour. There again we beheld brave little
Belgium defying the German bully, and Holland succouring
the refugees, and Belgium consoled by Liberty, and a final
picture of Liberty blessing the Allies. All these were
admirably represented, the immobility of the performers
being not less remarkable than the splendour of their
equipment; and enthusiasm was still further stimulated by
the singing of the anthems of the various allied nations.
The performance proceeded, and the intermezzi had been
briskly taken; the harp had spent its last liquid notes;
“Caller Herrin’” had been delightfully sung, and four tiny
girls (combined height some twelve feet) had charmed us
with the pretty innocence of their flower carol. Also a
dramatic version of “The Holly Tree Inn” had been played
in a fashion that DICKENs would not have disapproved.
Now there was a murmur of expectation among the audience;
soon the crystal-clear strains of “He shall feed His flock”
sounded through the room, and as they lingered and died
away the curtain rose for the masque, “The Holy Night.”
At the back of the stage was a lowly shed, its closed door
guarded by two angelic figures clothed in pure white
draperies and with wings that sparkled with a silver sheen.
High above, to the left of the shed, a third angel soared,
and these three watched and waited, intent and motionless,
their hands crossed over their breasts. In front of them
lay three shepherds, and amongst them frisked a white and
woolly little lamb (Douglas, the Vicar's son), and further
to the left we recognised little Kit Price as a raven in sleek
black satin, and our John only partially disguised as a
and pecking and scraping to his heart's content, and
admitted to the cast in spite of the stage directions, which
declare that “if any little boy have very fat legs he shall
not play the part of the cock.” He made such amends as
were possible by the extreme vividness and energy of the
beak with which he kept the raven in order. At the back
of the scene there were vague indications of tho presence of
an ox and an ass. It had been intended to represent them
in a lifelike fashion by two heads; but these, though
ordered, had failed to arrive, being cut off on their way by
floods.
Now the shepherds burst into song, and when that was
over the cock flapped his wings and crew, and the raven
cawed, and the lamb ba-a-ed, and the uncompleted ox and
ass made noises after their kind, and there was a lively
bustle everywhere, except where the angels watched and
waited with their hands crossed and their shining wings
at rest. The shepherds began to gossip as shepherds, I
suppose, have gossiped ever since the cale of sheep began.
One told how his grandam said, on the authority of a
wise woman, that on the night Messias is born all the
beasts shall speak. Another doubted whether this would
hap in our time. Nothing, he thought, would hap save
these heavy taxings; but the other reminded him that it
had been a good year for sheep. But suddenly, as the
shepherds chatted, the three angels, invisible to the shep-
herds, raised each a warning hand and bent forward and
whispered, “Hush-sh!” and an awe-struck silence fell
upon the scene. Something great and wonderful had
happened, but what was it, and how would it be revealed?
Thereupon the cock, flapping his wings, did not crow, but
cried out, “ Christus matus est / Christ is born 1 '' and the
raven, instead of cawing, called “Quando 2 When 2" and
the ass in a loud voice answered, “Hac nocte 1 This night!”
and the ox said “ Ubi ? Where?” and the lamb stood up
and bleated “Be-e-ethlehem.” Oh, then was heard a
swelling sound of great exultation, and above the shed
the dark and starry skies were opened and drawn away
to each side, and there were disclosed angels raised up and
standing in a long row, their bright wings folded and pointing
upward, while they declared the glory of the Lord. And
next the two guarding angels folded back the door of the
shed, and there were seen MARY and Joseph, “and betwixt
them two"—I quote from the directions—“the Holy Child
lieth on a tuft of straw in a little box which shall be called
the Manger,” while two diminutive angels knelt, one at
each side of the open door. No more beautiful and gracious
picture could be imagined. Thus might some old Italian
master have painted it, but this had, not colour alone and
simplicity, but life and song and jubilation and perfect
harmony of movement so natural as to seem unstudied.
Then the shepherds did obeisance and the Wise Men, |
MELCHIOR, CASPAR and BALTHASAR, came and offered their
gifts, and, last, after preparations had been made for
departure into Egypt, the whole company sang together
the glorious and triumphant, “Adeste, Fideles,” and the
curtain drew down and the beautiful masque was over.
There was no applause—only a universal sigh of content-
ment and admiration.

ready with this counsel after reading The Mutiny of the
Elsinore (MILLS AND BooN). Of course I know that a
voyage in nautical fiction can never be wholly uneventful,
also that one is justified in looking to Mr. JACK LoNDoN
for something rather strenuous. But really the Elsinore
appears to touch the limit in this kind. I wish I could
tell you properly about her crew. (Mr. LoNDON takes
chapters and chapters in which to do it). I suppose that
every possible variety of undesirable was represented
among them, from dangerous maniacs downwards. And
their behaviour was what you might expect. The disquiet-
ing thing about the book is that the author gives to its
most horrific episodes a cold and calculated air of truth.
“Experto crede,” he seems to say; “thus and thus is the
real life of ships.” So I had to believe him. There was
only one passenger on board the Elsinore, and he finished
the voyage in command of her. This was after the Captain
had gone wrong in the head, and the First Officer had
discovered the Second to be the murderer of one whom he
had sworn to avenge. By this time also the voyage (which
might be called one of attrition) had considerably reduced
the Elsinore's company; while the survivors were mostly
engaged in hurling bombs and vitriol at each other. What
I am far from denying its grim strength, it will not be my
favourite among its author's always interesting romances.
Mr. GILBERT CANNAN offers us in Young Earnest (SECKER)
an extremely conscientious and plausible study of a talented,
sensitive and, I am afraid, rather “superior” youth whose
love affairs preoccupy him too exclusively and whose de-
mands on life are so exacting that nothing can ever bring
him content. I feel so sure from the good deal which I now
know of young Fourmy and his behaviour to his wife, Linda,
that brilliant suburban, and to Ann, the factory girl, that he
never found with Cathleen the perfect peace which his
creator alleges; or perhaps, more justly, that he never
could have found it without a struggle and self-discipline,
of which there are few signs. It is surely one of the
fallacies of a common philosophy of romance—a fallacy
much too crude for Mr. CANNAN's unusually careful method
—that while this, that and the other relation, opening
delightfully, becomes sordid or impossible some final
selection is to prove automatically and permanently bliss-
ful, even if there be no legal ties to chafe against on
principle. The fact is your Fourmys are in this difficult
matter of the affections doomed to trouble as the sparks
fly upward, and of course the perceptive author knows this
perfectly well and his happy ending is only a “let’s
pretend.” I have been fascinated by the skill of a series of
uncannily clear-cut portraits; I know no other writer who
has the power in so singular a degree of getting right down
below surface traits to depths of mood and character.
Analyse it and you will find that Mr. CANNAN gives you
no descriptions but merely lets his characters unfold them-

one might call an active, open-air book. But, though
selves in their talk. There's much in that “merely.”

[JANUARY 20, 1915.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Oliver, the hero of The Woman who Looked Back (STANLEY
PAUL), seems to have been a person of exceptional credulity.
Having as a boy married a quite undesirable foreigner, he
subsequently went to India, and on his return accepted
without question his mother's statement that he was a
widower. So he married Sara, the heroine of the tale, and
lived in great placidity for some eight years with her, till
the expected happened, and the discovery of an old letter
proved that wife No. 1 was very much alive. It is at this
dramatic crisis that M. HAMILTON raises the curtain upon
his (or her) story. If I treat it with flippancy it is not
from any dislike of it; on the contrary it seems to me both
interesting and human, especially human. The dialogue is
profoundly and movingly natural; in every chapter I have
felt that, given the postulated situation, the characters
would talk exactly thus, which simply means that M.
HAMILTON is an adept in her (or his) art. The situation is
complicated by the fact that, though Oliver had accepted
his second marriage as an ideally happy one, Sara in her
secret heart was becoming monstrously bored. Indeed in a
soft, play-with-fire fashion she believed herself in love with
Oliver's friend George,
who himself adored her
passionately. Naturally,
therefore, when the bomb
burst and Sara was no
longer the wife of any-
body, George thought Eis
moment had come. I
shall not carry the story
of their three-cornered
fight further. It remains
three-cornered. Contrary
to every accepted custom,
the original and only
genuine wife never once
appears upon the stage.
This strikes me as con-
stituting a record in the
avoidance of the scène-d-
faire. Incidentally also
it confirms me in my
opinion of M. HAMILTON
as an author of origin- -
ality and honesty, whose picture of Sara in particular shows
that she understands a great deal about her own sex.

My enjoyment of a book that is frankly a study on a
special subject is always limited by the interest of the
subject itself, however prettily the theme be embroidered.
The most eloquent disquisition on postage stamps, for
example, would leave me unmoved. MARGARET PETERson
needs no introduction as a most eloquent writer on things
Indian; yet “Eurasia,” her set study in Tony Bellew
(MELROSE)—I am not likening it to philately, and should
be sorry to be disrespectful to either—so swamps her story,
and is in itself so little agreeable, that I cannot feel much
enthusiasm for her latest work. That it is dry and barren
cannot be said of a single page; indeed, I could even wish
that such adjectives might be applicable here and there as
a relief from the—shall I say?—clammy fungoid atmo-
sphere that permeates, and is intended to permeate, the
world that lies between the covers of this volume. The
central figure—certainly not hero, and wanting something
to be man—exhales in his fickle violences just this miasma;
and rightly so, if the general conception of the book be
just, for he is born of a Bengali mother. Even his final
sacrifice to save Joan, herself about the only character one

little to redeem him. I would gladly believe that the
picture of her unpleasant experiences is as false as, I think
you will agree, it is on the whole ugly and unsympathetic;
though I admit that a lack of sympathy is as much against
the intention of the writer as a certain unpleasantness is
the deliberate object of her able craftsmanship. I must
place it in your hands at that, with the advice to read or
pass by according to your interest in the subject.
The Wise Virgins (ARNOLD) is one of those quaint old-
world stories of the day when there were artists and
individualists who despised convention and the stiffness of
ordinary morality and wanted to realise themselves and
occupied quite a lot of our attention. To read it is to
plunge back through the mists of time into the early
summer of 1914 A.D. And even then I have my doubts as
to whether I should have been persuaded to share the
sympathy which L. F. Woolf appears to feel for IIarry
Davis, the young Richstead painter. The two types of people
among whom his lot is cast are cleverly if much too bitterly
and unkindly contrasted — the Garlands, pre-eminently
suburban, unable and (all

full of aesthetic sensibili-
ties to do anything but
sit still and talk. Harry
combines the aesthetic
sense with a restless
vitality which he attri-
butes to his Jewish
origin, and is desirous
of action and enterprise.
And so, rejected by
Camilla Lawrence, he
talks to Gwen until she
almost compels him to
compromise her, and the
book closes with the
mockery of a forced mar-

In spite of some skilful and penetrating satire, I fancy that
1915 will consider The Wise Virgins neither a very nice

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Oliver, the hero of The Woman who Looked Back (STANLEY
PAUL), seems to have been a person of exceptional credulity.
Having as a boy married a quite undesirable foreigner, he
subsequently went to India, and on his return accepted
without question his mother's statement that he was a
widower. So he married Sara, the heroine of the tale, and
lived in great placidity for some eight years with her, till
the expected happened, and the discovery of an old letter
proved that wife No. 1 was very much alive. It is at this
dramatic crisis that M. HAMILTON raises the curtain upon
his (or her) story. If I treat it with flippancy it is not
from any dislike of it; on the contrary it seems to me both
interesting and human, especially human. The dialogue is
profoundly and movingly natural; in every chapter I have
felt that, given the postulated situation, the characters
would talk exactly thus, which simply means that M.
HAMILTON is an adept in her (or his) art. The situation is
complicated by the fact that, though Oliver had accepted
his second marriage as an ideally happy one, Sara in her
secret heart was becoming monstrously bored. Indeed in a
soſt, play-with-fire fashion she believed herself in love with
Oliver's friend George, -- - -
who himself adored her
passionately. Naturally,
therefore, when the bomb
burst and Sara was no
longer the wife of any-
body, George thought Eis
moment had come. I
shall not carry the story
of their three-cornered
fight further. It remains
three-cornered. Contrary
to every accepted custom,
the original and only
genuine wife never once
appears upon the º:
This strikes me as con-
stituting a record in the
avoidance of the scène-d-
faire. Incidentally also
it confirms me in my
opinion of M. HAMILTON

little to redeem him. I would gladly believe that the
picture of her unpleasant experiences is as false as, I think
you will agree, it is on the whole ugly and unsympathetic;
though I admit that a lack of sympathy is as much against
the intention of the writer as a certain unpleasantness is
the deliberate object of her able craftsmanship. I must
place it in your hands at that, with the advice to read or
pass by according to your interest in the subject.
The Wise Virgins (ARNOLD) is one of those quaint old-
world stories of the day when there were artists and
individualists who despised convention and the stiffness of
ordinary morality and wanted to realise themselves and
occupied quite a lot of our attention. To read it is to
plunge back through the mists of time into the early
summer of 1914 A.D. And even then I have my doubts as
to whether I should have been persuaded to share the

as an author of origin- -- -
ality and honesty, whose picture of Sara in particular shows
that she understands a great deal about her own sex.
My enjoyment of a book that is frankly a study on a
special subject is always limited by the interest of the
subject itself, however prettily the theme be embroidered.
The most eloquent disquisition on postage stamps, for
example, would leave me unmoved. MARGARET PETERSoN

(MELROSE)—I am not likening it to philately, and should
be sorry to be disrespectful to either—so swamps her story,
and is in itself so little agreeable, that I cannot feel much
enthusiasm for her latest work. That it is dry and barren
cannot be said of a single page; indeed, I could even wish
that such adjectives might be applicable here and there as
a relief from the—shall I say?—clammy fungoid atmo-
sphere that permeates, and is intended to permeate, the
world that lies between the covers of this volume. The
central figure—certainly not hero, and wanting something
to be man—exhales in his fickle violences just this miasma;
and rightly so, if the general conception of the book be
just, for he is born of a Bengali mother. Even his final
sacrifice to save Joan, herself about the only character one

bar of a night to realise that the people of our country are
alive to their need in this respect.
Consider what this shortage of fish must mean in the
development of the intellectual life of the people of this
country. How can we expect our parcels to be delivered
intelligently, our gas-fittings to be adjusted properly, our
bulbs to be planted effectively, if our carmen, our plumbers,
our jobbing gardeners, and so forth, are deprived of their

It illustrates the difficulty which the British have in

older servants to join the army. One section of these men,

and have never been mounted in their lives, are being

British army—were founded to preserve the name of the

THE LAST FIGHT OF ADD.
EveRY morn we met together
On our journey up to town,
Guyed the Government and weather,
Ran all other nations down;
And, whenever (very seldom)
Strangers' visages were seen,
With indignant looks we quelled 'em
On the 9.17.
But to-day there's none remaining
To bestow the crushing glance.
Down in Surrey Smith is training,
Brown is somewhere out in France;
Going through his martial paces,
Jones is billeted at Sheen;
Strangers seize the sacred places
On the 9.17.
But when once, the struggle ended,
Men resume their normal toil
There will be one final, splendid
Battle fought on English soil;
And the populace enraptured
From their evening Press shall glean :
“Heavy fighting; seats recaptured
On the 9.17.”
THE WAR AND THE BOOKS.
“NowHERE,” says a contemporary,
“is the influence of the War more ap-
parent than in the publishers' lists.”
We venture to anticipate a few items
that are promised for this time next
year:—
For Lovers of Bright Fiction. NEw
GERMAN FAIRY TALEs. Selected from
the Official Wireless. 550 pp., large
quarto, 10s. 6d. The first review says,
“Deliciously entertaining . . . powers
of imagination greatly above the ordi-
nary. The story of “Hans across the
Sea, or the Eagles in Egypt,” will
make you rock with laughter.
Important new work on Ornithology.
BRITISH BIRDs, BY ONE who GoT THEM.
Being the experiences of a Slacker in
the prime of life during the Great War.
Crown octavo, 6s. Profusely illustrated
with cuts.
Civili.AN LIFE FROM WITH IN. The
author, Mr. Jude Brown, has (for good
reasons fully explained in the preface)
remained a civilian during the past
year. He is thus in a position to speak
with authority upon a phase of life which
most of his contemporary readers will
either have forgotten or never known.
Just as Service novels in the past used
to appear full of the most absurd tech-
nical errors, so to-day many books that
profess to deal with civilian life are
disfigured by every kind of solecism.
Mr. Brown, however, writes not as a
gushing amateur but as one who knows.
Nephew. “I’M READING A VERY INTERESTING Book, Aunt, cALLED “GERMANY AND
THE NExT WAR.’”
Aunt. “WELL, MY DEAR, I should HAVE THoughT THEY HAD THEIR HANDS FULL
ENOUGH WITH THE PRESENT ONE.”
In a Good Cause.
Mr. Punch begs to call the attention
of his readers to a sale which will take
place at CHRISTIE's, on February 5th, of
pictures by members of the Royal
Society of Painters in Watercolours.
The entire proceeds will be divided be-
tween the two allied societies, the Red
Cross and the St. John Ambulance.
The pictures are on exhibition at Messrs.
CHRISTIE's, who are bearing all expenses
and charging no commission.

JIMMY had been saving up his pocket-
money and his mother had begun to get
rather anxious; she thought he must be
sickening for something.
He was. It was for a dog, any dog,
but preferably a very fierce bloodhound.
IIe had already bought a chain; he
had to have that because the dog he
was going to buy would have to be
held in by main force; it would have to
be restrained.
But he didn't have to buy one after
all; he had one transferred to him.
You see Jimmy was helping at a
kind of bazaar in aid of the Belgian
Refugees Fund. He had volunteered
to help with the refreshment stall.
There is a lot of work about a refresh-
ment stall, Jimmy says. His
work made him a bit husky,
but he stuck to it and so it
stuck to him.
He was very busy explain-
ing the works of a cake to a
lady when a man came up
with something under his
arm. It was a raffle. You
paid threepence for a ticket,
and would the lady like one?
The lady said she already
had two tea-cosies at home;
but the man explained that
it was not a tea-cosy, it was
a dog. -
A dog! Perhaps a blood-
hound! Jimmy trembled with
excitement. Only threepence
for a ticket, and he had a
Jimmy ran all the way home; he
couldn't run very fast, as the blood-
hound tried to slide on its hind legs
most of the way, it was so fierce.
Jimmy knows all about bloodhounds,
how to train them. He is training his
to track down German spies, amongst
other things.
He knows a way so that if you say
something—well, you don't exactly say
it, you do it by putting your tongue
into the place where your front tooth
came out and then blowing—a really
well-trained bloodhound will begin to
shiver, and the hair on the back of his
neck will go up. You then go and look
for someone to help you to pull him off
the German's throat, and ask the Ger-
man his name and address, politely.
Jimmy taught his bloodhound to
track clothes by letting it smell at a man's legs.

his bedroom, and saw itself in the
mirror in the wardrobe. Jimmy says
it was because it came upon itself
too suddenly. It made it brood a
great deal, and Jimmy had to give it a
certain herb to reassure it.
Jimmy takes it out every day, search-
ing for German spies. It goes round
sniffing everywhere—in hopes. It is
a very strong sniffer and full of zeal,
and one day it did it.
A man was looking at a shop-window,
where they sell sausages and pork-pies.
He was studying them, Jimmy says.
Jimmy says he never would have
guessed he was a German spy if his
bloodhound hadn't sniffed him out. It
walked round the man twice, and in
doing so wrapped the chain round the

Jimmy says it showed the
bloodhound was hot upon the
scent.
It then sniffed a piece out
of the man's trousers.
There was another man
there; he was looking on and
laughing. He said to Jimmy,
“Pull in, sonny; you've got
a bite.”
But he stopped laughing

A QUESTION OF TACTICS.
Poor Jones' I often think of him—
a patriot of the super-dreadnought
type, with an apoplectic conviction
that the whole conduct of the War, on
the part of the Allies, had been from
the outset a series of gigantic mistakes.
“I don't believe in all this spade and
chess-board work,” he used to growl;
“up and at 'em, that's my motto.
Magnificent fighting material we've
got at the Front, but what we want is
brains, Sir, brains to use it.” And

his own forehead.
At the end of October we all agreed
not to argue with Jones any more.
Peters, who in his younger days very
nearly qualified for the medical pro-
fession, said that for
coloured persons like our
friend anything in the
nature of a heated dis-
cussion might easily lead
to fatal results. So partly
out of consideration for
the Empire, which we
felt could not afford in
the present crisis to lose
a single man, even Jones,
partly out of consideral
tion for Mrs. Jones
(though here we were
perhaps influenced by a
sentiment of mistaken
kindness), and partly out
of consideration for our-
selves, we decided to avoid
the topic of the War when
conversing with Jones. -
It proved very difficult to carry out
our resolution. When a man is deter-
mined to discuss the War, the whole
War, and nothing but the War, with
everybody he meets, it is hard to side-
track him. You can, of course, aſter

happened. As I rose to take my

to the Vicar. I sat down again.

the voice seductively.

“No,” I replied.

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE FOOD PRO BLEM.
Greenwood is one of those intoler-
able men who always rise to an
occasion. He is the kind of man who
rushes to sit on the head of a horse
when it is down. I can even picture
him sitting on the bonnet of an over-
turned motor-'bus and shouting, “Now
all togetherl’ to the men who are
readjusting it.
We were going down to business
when Perkins introduced a new griev-
ance against the Censor.
“Whatever do they allow this rot
about food prices in the paper for?”
he began. “It unsettles women awfully.
Now my wife is insisting on having
her housekeeping allowance advanced
twenty-five per cent. I tell you she'd
never have known anything about the
advances if they hadn't been put before
her in flaring type.”
The general opinion of the compart-
ment seemed to be that the Censor had
gravely neglected his duty. -
“I agreed with my wife,” said Blair,
who is a shrewd Scotchinan, “and told
her that she must have an extra two
pounds a month. Now a twenty-five per
cent. advance would have meant five
pounds a month. Luckily Providence
fashioned women without an idea of
arithmetic.”
Most of us looked as if we wished
we had thought of this admirable idea.
“My wife drew my attention to the
paper,” said Greenwood loftily. “I did
not argue the point with her. Finance
is not woman's strong point. I rang
for the cook at once.”
Everyone looked admiringly at the
hero who had dared to face his cook.
“I said to her,” continued Greenwood,
“‘Cook, get the Stores price-list for
to-day and serve for dinner precisely
the things that have not advanced.
You understand 2 That will do.' So
you see the matter was settled.”
“Er, what did your wife say?”
asked Perkins.
“Say! What could she say? Here
was the obvious solution. And I have
noticed that women always lose their
heads in an emergency. They never
rise to the occasion.”
The next morning I met Greenwood
again.
“By the way,” I asked, “did you
have a good dinner yesterday?"
Greenwood looked me straight in the
eyes. There is a saying that a liar

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XIV.
(From the Grand Duke Nicholas, Commander-in-Chief of
the Russian Armies.)
SIR,--It is pleasant in the midst of this welter of war to
remember the days when your nation and mine were at
peace, and when it was possible for each of us to inspect
the troops of the other without running the risk of having
our heads blown off by gigantic shells fired at the distance
of several miles. What splendid reviews were those you
used to hold on the Tempelhofer Feld / What a feeling of
almost irresistible power was inspired by those solid
regiments manoeuvring and marching past under the eyes
of their supreme War-lord ' I think the intoxication of that
sight was too great for you. You were not one of those
calm ones who can be secure through the mere possession
of strength. You had it, but at last came a point when
you felt that it was all useless to you unless you employed
it. So you urged on Austria in her unhappy policy of
quasi-Bismarckian adventure; you cast to the winds every
prompting of prudence and humanity; you imagined that
other nations, because they were slow to take offence,
could be bullied and hectored with impunity; you flung
your defiance east and west, and in a moment of passion
made war against all those who had striven for peace, but
were not prepared to cling to it at the price of dishonour.
And thus began the disappointments which have settled
upon you like a cloud. For, after all, war is entirely
different from a review or from the most skilful peace-
manoeuvres. In manoeuvres everything can be comfortably
arranged beſorehand. There are no bullets and no shells,
and at the end a Kaiser can place himself at the head of
many thousands of cavalry and can execute a charge that
will resound for days through the columns of the news-
papers. But in war there is a real enemy who has guns
and bayonets and knows how to use them. All the colour
that fascinates a shallow mind has to be put aside.
There are deaths and wounds and sickness, and in
the endurance of these and in the courage that surmounts
all difficulties and dangers the dingiest regiment may make
as brave a show as those which used to practise the
parade-march over the review-field. I rather doubt if
you had thought of all this—now had you?
Moreover our Russians, though they may look rough and
though you may accuse them of ignorance, are no whit
inferior to the most cultivated German professor in their
patriotism and in their stern resolution to die rather than
submit to defeat. They do not boast themselves to be
learned men, but, on the other hand, it is not they who have
made Louvain a city of ruins. They fight fiercely against
men who have arms in their hands, but they have not
executed innocent hostages, nor have they used warships
and airships to massacre women and children. In these
particulars they are willing to grant you and your Germans
an unquestioned supremacy. If that be the civilisation to
which your philosophers and poets have brought you, I
can only say that we shall endeavour to rub along without
such philosophers and poets; and I must beg you not to
attempt to convert our Cossacks to your views. Being
simple folk and straightforward, they might resent violently
your efforts to give them the enlightenment of the
Germans.
All this sounds like preaching, and Heaven knows I do
not want to preach to you. You have hardened your
heart, and I suppose you must go through this bitter
business to the end. Let me rather tell you that, rough
in our fighting. So far we have once more foiled your ||
HINDENBERG's attack on Warsaw. . We have an earnest ||
hope that we shall be able to make your troops highly |
uncomfortable in the North, while towards the South we |
have been dealing quite faithfully with the Austrians. The
Caucasus is filled with Turks dead or flying from our
troops. As to Serbia—but I feel it would be scarcely
polite to mention this stiff-necked country. It must be
galling for your ally to have to fight a people so small in
numbers but so great in their unconquerable resolution:
Was it in order that Austrian troops might be chased
headlong from Belgrade that you went to war?
I am, with all possible respect, your devoted enemy,
- - NICHOLAS.
THE BREAKING POINT.
I HAD a tooth, a rag-bag, an offence,
A splintered horror, an abiding woe,
And after shameful months of diffidence
I brought it to the dentist, saying, “Lo!
Here's a defaulter in my squad of fangs:
Deal with him, please, and spare me needless pangs."
“Ah yes,” he said, and jammed that rubber thing
(Does your man use it?) round the guilty tooth,
And, having gagged me, started gossiping
About the Germans' disregard for truth.
“Did you observe,” he asked, “that last report 2"
“Urrup!” said I, or something of the sort.
“How one admires our English troops ' " said he,
“Such hardy chaps (A leetle wider, please).
And isn't it a shameful thing to see -
So many slackers lounging at their ease—
Young men who can and ought to go and serve?
Shirkers!” he added, gouging at a nerve.
Then he waxed wroth. “As for that Yarmouth job—
Why do such brutes exist, Sir? Tell me why
They maim and mutilate, they burn and rob! -
Kultur be blowed 1" said he. (“Gug-gug!” said I).
“My word, I'd like to have a Uhlan now,
Here, in this chair!” “Woo-oosh!” I answered. “Ow!”
Thus for a dreadful hour he prattled on
And quarried, rooting in the sorest place.
Then he announced: “This tooth is too far gone;
Only extraction now can meet the case.
I'm sure you'd love to show your British pluck,
And here's your chance; some chaps have all the luck!”
Yes, he said that, and I could stand no more.
Crushed as I was and anguished and half-dead,
I wrenched his gag out, kicked it round the floor,
And threw the tattered remnant at his head ;
And, seeking barbèd words, I found but one

YoU SEE, You 'RE Too old To ENLIST, AND I REALLY FEEL we ought To Do some THING !”
BY THE SEA.
“JoLLY good luck,” Miss WESTA
TILLEY used to sing, “to the girl who
loves a soldier!” The sentiment is
not less true to-day than when, too
long ago, the famous male impersonator
first uttered it. But there is no need
to be actually the warrior's lover. To
be his companion merely on a walk is
to reap benefits, too, as I have been
observing on the promenade of
(a marine town whose name is, for
tactical reasons, suppressed). At
the girls whose good fortune it is to
have for an acquaintance a lieutenant
or captain have just now a great
time, for the town has suddenly become
a veritable Chatham, and the promenade
is also a Champ de Mars. All the week
it is the scene of military evolutions, a
thought too strenuous for the particular
variety of jolly good luck of which
I am thinking; but there's a day
which comes betwixt the Saturday and
Monday when hard work gives way
For then this promenade, two or three
miles long, is thronged by the military
—privates, usually in little bands of
threes and fours, and officers, mostly
accompanied by pretty girls. And the
demeanour of some of the younger of
these officers is a great deal better
worth watching than the sullen winter
sea or the other more ordinary objects
of the seaside. For they are there,
some of them (bless their hearts (), for
the pleasure of being saluted, and their
pretty friends enjoy the reflected glory
too. Some high-spirited ones among
the satellites even go so far as notice-
ably to count the salutes which a walk
yields. And I daresay they pit their
bag against those of others. Their
heroes probably vote such a com-
petition bad form, and yet I doubt if
they are really deeply resentſul, and I
guess that the young Roberts and
the young Wols.I.LEY and the young
WELLINGTON all passed through similar
ecstasies when they were first gazetted.
It was while walking behind one such
covery — a discovery to me, who am
hopelessly a civilian, but no new thing I
daresay to most people—that the salut-
ing soldier must employ the hand
which is farthest away from the officer
whom he is saluting, and that is why
some use the right and some the left—
a discrepancy which plunged me into
the gravest fears as to Lord KITCH-
ENER's fitness to control our army,
until I realised the method underlying.
I noticed too that there is a good deal
of difference both in saluting and in
acknowledging salutes, and I overheard
the fair young friend of one lieutenant
adjuring him to be a little more genial
in his attitude to the nice men who
were bringing their arms and hands up
with such whipcord tenseness in his
honour.

| circles. True, the higher
| claims of kingship did enter
into the question in the case
of Richard VIII., whose heart
was badly torn between his
duty to his people and his
passion for his wife; but for
the rest, and apart from the
mere properties (human or
inanimate) of a royal palace,
we might have been concerned
with an ordinary middle-class
interior complicated by a resi-
dential mother-in-law.
The causes of the misunder-
standing (partially shared by
myself) between the King and
his Consort were some four or
five. There was the Dowager
Queen—a constant obsession
—who stood for the extreme
of propriety. She ought, of
course, to have had a palace
of her own. There was the
rigorously imposed her own
standards of living. There was
the young Queen with a harm-
less taste for the natural gaiety of youth.
Not designed by nature for , the
wearing of the purple, she had been
taken from a nice country home, where
there were birds and flowers and moun-
tains. She kept saying to herself:—
“Mid pleasures and palaces though I may
roam,
Be they never so regal, I'd rather go home.”
But, since she couldn't do that, she
clamoured for pretty frocks, and for
the right to choose her own friends.
Among these was an American Mar-
quise of so doubtful a record that her
name had to be deleted from the list of
guests commanded to the State Ball. I

! Ivor as the Queen-Mother, which was
sadly curtailed. Miss MARIE
LöHR played the young Queen
with extraordinary sincerity,
notably in one of the many
scenes in which she lamented
her lost child. Here, if this
tedious baby had not failed to
touch my imagination, I must
have been honestly moved. If
we suffered any doubt as to the
reality of her grief, this was
due to the disturbing beauty
of the frocks in which she
gave utterance to it. Anyhow
they totally failed to support
the charge of dowdiness which
had been freely brought against
the Queen-Mother's régime.
Finally, that native air of
frank loyalty which Mr. BEN
WEBSTER’s gifts as an actor
are impotent to disguise gave
the lie to his thankless part
as Prince Louis. Nor did the
superiority of his morning-coat

a hardihood and success which nothing in this ingenuous
narrative sufficiently explains, the Honourable Lavinia
Elliston, Lord Ronald and the extravagant Mrs. Latham
rush in to patch up the Christopher-Katherine alliance.
I don't suspect Mr. Thomas Cobb of thinking that people
really do things quite like this, but probably he found
that his characters took the bits between their teeth—as
they well might. Lord Ronald's share in the transaction
seemed particularly gratuitous. I can only think that
since moving in photographic circles he had discarded his
high patrician polish in favour of a distinctly mat surface.
He didn't marry the widow Latham because he hated the
thought of touching old man Latham's money. She, dis-
covering this, disposed of the whole of it in a few months
of gloriously expensive living and giving. This, by the
way, was her “Extravagance,” which of course brought
the happy ending. O, Mr. Copp'
- - I
The king of curmudgeons,
could not complain when
Mrs. CoNYERs is described as
“one of the most entertaining
hunting novelists of the day,"
but when Messrs. METHUEN
call her book (A Mired Pack)
“a collection of Irish sporting
stories " I may at least be
allowed to wonder at the in-
adequacy of their description.
For the fact of the matter
is that a third part of this
volume, and by no means the
worst part, is concerned with
little Mr. Jones, a traveller
in the firm of Amos and
Samuel Mosenthal, who were
dealers in precious stones and
about as Irish and as sporting
as their names suggest. Mr.
Jones, in the opinion of the
Mosenthals, was the simplest
soul that they had ever
entrusted with jewels of great
value. Although the tales
of apparent simpletons who
outwit crafty villains are be-
coming tedious in their fre -
quency, I can still congratulate Mrs. CoNYERs upon the
thrills and shudders that she gets into these stories of
robbery and torture. Not for a moment do I believe in
Mr. Jones, but for all that I take the little man to my
heart. As for the tales of sport, it is enough to say that
they are written with so much wit and verve that even I,
who am commonly suffocated with boredom when I have
to listen to a hunting story, found them quite pleasant to
read.
My expectations of enjoyment on opening The Whalers
(HopDER AND Stoughton) were nil, for the tales of whaling
to which from time to time I have been compelled to listen
have produced sensations which can only be described as
nauseating. Somewhere, somehow, I knew that brave
men risked their lives in gaining a precarious livelihood
from blubber, but I was more than content to hear no
further details either of them or their captures. Let me
acknowledge, then, that Mr. J. J. BELL has persuaded me,
against my will, of the romance and fascination of the
whalers' calling. The twelve stories—or perhaps they ought

romantic and practically nothing that is repulsive. “There
is,” the author says with engaging frankness, “much that
is slow in whaling. On the whole there is more anxiety
than excitement, more labour than sport.” Not for me is it
to contradict such an authority, but even granted that he is
right the fact remains that no one can justly complain of a
lack of excitement in these stories, though complaints may
legitimately be made that their pathos is sometimes allowed
to drop into sentimentality. “The Herr Professor—an In-
terlude" deserves an especial word of praise, for it proves
again that Mr. BELL, when not occupied in other directions,
can be simply and delightfully funny.
It must have happened to all of us to be hailed by some
friend with the greeting, “I’ve got the funniest story to tell
you; it'll make you scream,” and to listen thereafter to
something that produced nothing but irritated perplexity.

valued one, with a record of
genuine humour, we would
perhaps evoke with difficulty
a polite snigger, and so break
from the encounter. Well, this
is very much what I cannot

GERMANY'S WAR STRENGTH.
DEAR Mr. Punch,--I cannot for the life of me understand
why your contemporaries should be in such difficulties over
the above question or how it is that they arrive at such
diverse estimates. The elements of the problem are perfectly
straightforward. I worked it out on the back of my ticket
in the Tube last night, and as there can be no doubt
whatever about my conclusions I think they ought to
be published. - - -
The present population of Germany for popular purposes
(as they always say) is 70,000,000. All the evidence goes
to show that the war is still popular in Germany, or parts
of it, so we may accept that figure. Very well. Of these,
33,000,000 are males. It seems a good many, but we shall
soon begin to whittle it down. By examining the figures of
the different “age groups" we find that fully five million
of these are under the age of seven and as quite a number
are over sixty and others are incapacitated—we have no
space to enter into all these complicated calculations here—
we shall not be far wrong if we deduct at the outset about
21,175,000 under these heads. This leaves us in round
figures twelve million. . . . . - -
We now come to the question of losses up to date;
and here we must proceed with caution, for it is above all
important to be on the safe side. The present German
losses are computed by the best authorities at about two
million, from all causes, up to 3 P.M. on the 13th ult.
From this we must deduct, however, all those who, after
being wounded, have returned to the firing-line—say, half
a million. Also all those who, having been wounded a
second time, have returned to the front, say, three hundred
thousand. Also all those who have been three times
wounded and have still gone back to fight—say, fifty
thousand. º * . . . . . . . .”
Then again we must remember those who have been
invalided home and recovered, and those who have been
missing and are found again. And there are the men who
have been erroneously reported as prisoners, owing to the
Germans' incorrigible habit of exaggerating the number of
their own troops who have fallen into the enemy's hands.
After all these deductions we may safely put the revised
German losses at 750,000. This should be taken off the
twelve million eligible; but it would, I think, be wise (in
order to keep always on the safe side) to add it on. This
gives us 12,750,000. Very well.
But the industries of the country must be carried on.
There are the railways, agriculture, mining. Let us say
five million for these. There are those great industries
without which a nation cannot wage war; for instance, the
makers of Iron Crosses (100,000), the custodians of ships
retained in harbour (50,000), the printers of picture-postcards
(50,000), the writers of Hate-hymns, besides sundry makers
of armaments and things.
Counting all these in and keeping on the safe side and
dealing only with round figures for popular purposes we
may conclude that anything from one to nine million must
be deducted from our last figure to arrive at a final esti-
mate. .
To sum up, Germany's war strength cannot be more
than three million or less than eleven. This gives us a
clear idea of what we have to face.
I enclose my card in case you should think me an amateur,
and have the honour to remain,
. . Yours faithfully,

ON THE SPY TRAIL.
II.
ProPLE don't always know that
Jimmy's dog is a bloodhound. One
man said it was a Great Scott—at least
that is what he said when he saw it.
You see, when it is pensive, it some-
times looks like a spaniel and sometimes
like an Airedale — or it would if it
hadn't got smooth hair and a bushy tail
which curls. Jimmy was undecided
for a long time what to call it.
The milkman said Jimmy ought to
call it “For instance,” and then people
would know what it was for. The
milkman thought of a lot more names
before a week was over, for Jimmy's
bloodhound tracked down a can of his
milk and lapped it up. It
is a very good lapper. It
lapped so hard that Jimmy
had to pull the can off its
head. Jimmy said it was .
the suction and that all
good bloodhounds were like
that.
A man stopped Jimmy
in the street and asked him
if that was the dog that
tracked down the German
spy to his lair. Jimmy
said it was, and the man
was very pleased: he patted
the bloodhound on the head
and said, “Good old Faith-
ful!”—just like that.
Jimmy showed him the
pork-butcher's shop where
he did it, and the man said
if Jimmy would wait a
minute he would go and
buy the dog some German
fruit. Jimmy said the man

he made sure it was a German until he
saw it.
The goat was having its tea on the
far side of the field. Jimmy hadn't
seen the goat before, so he loosed
Faithful at it. Faithful bounded to-
wards the goat very hard at first, and
then stopped and began to deploy.
Jimmy said the goat was very sur-
prised when it saw Faithful and jumped
three feet into the air all at once.
Jimmy says Faithful makes things do
like that. You see Faithful was crawling
hand over hand towards it on the grass,
and the goat looked as if it expected
Faithful to go off suddenly.
Then the goat said “Yes! Yes!”

one Alp to the other, and they always
did that in Switzerland and it sounded
very pretty in the evening.
I hadn't got a little bell that tinkled
so I brought the dinner bell, and we tied
it on to the goat's neck with a rope.
Jimmy said it would make the goat
feel glad.
It took us a long time to harness
the goat properly because it was so
fidgety. There wasn't much room in
the cart, but we both managed to
squeeze in, and Faithful ran on in front.
The goat doesn't like Faithful; it has
an aversion to him when he bays.
Faithful knew the goat was coming
after him because he could hear the
bell.
There was more room for Jimmy
- when I fell out, but Faith-
ful kept straight in the
middle of the road doing
the side-stroke as hard as
he could with both hands.
I could hear the bell.
Jimmy said a horse and
trap climbed over the hedge
to let them pass. The man
in the trap said something
to Jimmy, but Jimmy
couldn't catch what he
said; it was such a long
sentence. Jimmy said they
went into an ironmonger's
shop, all of them. Faithful
got there first. He deployed
amongst some buckets
which were outside the
shop. So did the goat.
The noise disturbed the
ironmonger. He took his
wife and children into the
** cellar. Jimmy said it was
the noise that did it, and
bought a large kind of sausage which
had a red husk. He then stooped
down and said, “Good old chap, P
confer upon you the Order of the
Faithful Sausage, 1st class, and if
you catch another German spy I'll give
you a season ticket.” When Jimmy's
bloodhound saw the red’ ‘sausage he
began to bay, and he hurled himself
upon it with much vigour, Jimmy says.
The man watched Jimmy's bloodhound
working, and he said, “Magna est
fidelitas et prevalebit,” which he said
meant that “Old Faithful would down
the Germans every time.”
Jimmy calls his bloodhound Faithful
now, and he is keener than ever on
catching another German spy.
Jimmy says he thought he was on
the track of one the other day. He
was walking down a road when
suddenly Faithful began straining at
the leash, as if he scented one. But
it wasn't a German after all; it was
a goat. It was in a field. Jimmy said
Jimmy said the goat must have been
winding up the starting handle, for it
suddenly slipped in the clutch and got
into top gear in five yards. It was a
flexible goat, Jimmy says. Faithful is
a good runner; it has a kind of side-
stroke action when it runs fast, and this
puzzled the goat and made it skid a
bit on the grass. -
Jimmy sat on the gate and watched
them. After five times round the field
the goat sat down and looked non-
plussed.
Jimmy knows all about goats; he
knows what to do with them, and he
showed me. He got it so tame that it
would feed out of your hand. It ate
half a newspaper one day and it made
it very fiery. Jimmy said it was the
War news. We were trying to harness
it to a perambulator Jimmy had bor-
rowed. Jimmy said it had to have a
bell on its neck so that people would
know it was coming, just like the Alps.
Jimmy said goats could jump from
the goat's face.
The ironmonger's wiſe told Jimmy
she had had a shock; she spoke to him
out of the cellar window. Jimmy says
she had a catch in her breath.
The goat didn't go back to the field
very quickly; it was because one of the
wheels was bent and the goat seemed
to have caught a hiccough. That was
because it ran so fast aſter eating the
newspaper, Jimmy says. He says all
goats are like that.
The goat won't eat out of Jimmy's
hand now; whenever it sees Jimmy it
tries to climb a tree. A boy told Jimmy
that the man who owns the goat is
concerned about it, so Jimmy goes
hunting German spies with Faithful
down another road now. º

I HAD often seen the little lady at

makings of a General.
: We found out about her strategic
dispositions in a roundabout way. Her
maid told the milkman, and in the
course of nature the news came to us.
Fvery night her maid carries into her
room a fur coat, a large pair of boots
and a coal-scuttle. -
It is, of course, her preparation to
meet a Zeppelin attack.
Everybody is getting ready. Bul-
pitt's wife's mother, for example—
Bulpitt is my next-door neighbour—is
making him dig a bomb-proof hole in
the garden. Bulpitt thought there
might be some difficulty about getting
her into it. I pointed out that there
would be more difficulty in getting her
out—the hole is very deep. He said
he didn't worry about that.
Two nights later we had a scare.

things. It turned out afterwards that

a certain wall which, according to
Stewart, could not be knocked down
because of the stresses and strains that
would be set up.
That was all very well for him; the
only thing that went wrong was that a
little water had been left in the copper.
But what about poor Johnson, who
had to pile all the mattresses in the
coal-cellar? He was awfully black and
angry when he found out. -
And what about Carruthers, who
emptied a fire-pail on the drawing-room
fire, and had to explain a long muddy

safe, and respectably clad, waiting till

A LETTER TO THE FRONT.
Mrs. Jeremy looked up from her
knitting. “I want you to do some-
thing for me,” she said to her husband.
“Anything except sing,” said Jeremy
lazily.
“It's just to write a letter.”
“My dear, of course. The Complete

“‘Dear Mr. Mackinnon'—that's how
I should begin. Do we want to say
anything particular, or are we just try-
ing the new notepaper?”
Mrs. Jeremy put down her work and
gave herself up to explanation. Private
Mackinnon was in a school friend's
husband's regiment, and he never got
any letters or parcels from anybody,
and the friend's husband had asked his
wife to ask her friends—
“Wait a bit,” said Jeremy. “We
shall want the College of Heralds in
this directly.” He took out his pencil
and drew up a pedigree :-

There you are. Now you think it's
J. P. S.'s turn to write to Mackinnon.”
He drew a line from one to the other.
“Very well; I shall tell him about
the old school.” -
“You do see, don't you?” said Mrs.
Jeremy. “All the others get letters and
things from their friends, and poor Mr.
Mackinnon gets nothing. Katharine
wants to get up a surprise for him, and
she's asking half-a-dozen of her friends
to send him things and write him jolly
letters.” She picked up the muffler she
had been knitting. “This is for him,
and I said you'd do the letter. You
write such jolly ones.”
Jeremy threw away the end of his
cigar and got up.
“Yes, but what about 2" he said,
running his hand through his hair.
“This is going to be very difficult.”
“Oh, just one of your nice funny
letters like you write to me.”
“Quite like that?” said Jeremy
earnestly.
“Well, not quite like that,” smiled
Mrs. Jeremy; “but you know what I
mean. He'd love it.”
“Very well,” said Jeremy, “we’ll
See
He withdrew to his library and got
to work.
“My dear Mr. Mackinnon,” he wrote,
“the weather here is perfectly beastly.”
He looked at it thoughtfully and
then put it on one side. “We won't
destroy it,” he said to himself, “because
we may have to come back to it, but
at present we don't like it.”
He began another sheet of paper.
“My dear Mackinnon, who do you
think it is 2 Your old friend Jeremy
Smith !”
He murmured it to himself three or
four times, crossed out “old” and put
“new,” and then placed this sheet on
the top of the other.
“My dear Mackinnon, yesterday the
|Vicar——”
“I knew it would be difficult,” he
said, and took a fourth sheet. Absently
he began to jot down a few possible
openings:– - -
“I am a Special Constable . . .
“Have you read Mrs. Humphry
Ward's latest . . .” -
“I hope the War won't last long . . .”
“Yes,” he said, “but we're not
being really funny enough.”
He collected his letters as far as they
had gone and took them to his wife.
“You see what will happen, darling,”
he said. “Mr. Mackinnon will read them,
and he will say to himself, “There's
a man called Jeremy P. Smith who is
a fool.' The news will travel down the
line. They will tell themselves in
Alsace that J. P. Smith, the Treasurer
of the Little Blessington Cricket Club,
is lacking in grey matter. The story
will get across to the Germans in some
garbled form; ‘Smith off crumpet,' or
something of that sort. It will reach
the Grand Duke NICHOLAs; it will
traverse the neutral countries; every-
where the word will be spread that
your husband is, as they say, barmy.
I ask you, dear—is it fair to Baby?”
Mrs. Jeremy crumpled up the sheets
and threw them in the fire.
“Oh, Jeremy,” she said, “you could
do it so easily if you wanted to. If
you only said, ‘Thank you for being so
brave,' it would be something.”
“But you said it had to be a “jolly'
one.”
“Yes, that was silly of me. I didn't
mean that. Just write what you want
to write—never mind about what I
said.” * -
“Oh, but that's easy,” said Jeremy
with great relief; “I can do that on my
head.”
And this was the letter (whether he
wrote it on his head or not I cannot
say): -
“MY DEARMR. MACKINNoN,-You are
not married, I believe, but perhaps you
You will then get to know of a very
maddening trick which wives have.
You hand them a letter over the coffee-
pot beginning, ‘Dear Smith, I saw a
little water-colour of yours in the
Academy and admired it very much.

and I like that broad effect. Please
accept an earldom,'—but, before they
read any of it at all, they turn to the
signature at the end and say, ‘Why,
Jeremy, it's from the KING !' And
then all your beautiful surprise is gone.
“Now I don't mention this in order
to put you off marriage, because there
is a lot more in it than letters over the
coffee-pot, and all the rest is delightful.
But I want to tell you that, if (as I
expect) you are keeping the signature
of this letter for the surprise, you will
be disappointed. I am sorry about it.
I tried various signatures with a sur-
prise to them (you would have liked
my 'Hall Caine,' I think), but I decided
that I had best stick to the one I
have used for so many years, ‘J. P.
Smith.' It will make you ask that
always depressing question, ‘Who is
J. P. Smith ?” but this I cannot help.
Besides, I want to tell you who he is.
“An hour ago he was sitting in front
of a fire of logs, smoking a cigar. He
had just finished dinner, so good a
dinner that he was congratulating his
wife on it as she sat knitting on the
other side of the fire. If he had a
complaint to make at all, it was perhaps
that the fire was a little too hot ;
erhaps when he went upstairs he
would find that a little too hot also
was the bottle in his bed. One has
these hardships to face. To complete
the picture, I ask you to imagine a door
closed rather noisily kitchenwards, and
an exclamation of annoyance from
Mr. Smith. He passes it off by ex-
plaining that he was thinking of the
baby rather than of himself.
“Well, there you have this J. P. Smith
person . . . and at the same hour what
was this man Mackinnon doing? I
don't know; you do. But perhaps
you will understand now why I want
to say “Thank you.' 'I know what
you will answer: “Good Lord, I'm
only doing my job, I don't want to be
kissed for it.’ My dear Mackinnon,
you don't understand. I am not very |

kindly letting me write. This is my
birthday, not yours. I give myself the
pleasure of thanking you; as a gentle-
man you cannot refuse it to me,
“Yours gratefully, J. P. SMITH.”
“You dear,” said Mrs. Jeremy.
“He’ll simply love it.” : . .”.
Jeremy grunted.
“If I were Mackinnon,” he said, “I

“But I can see the pooryoung poetical

“Of course,” he went on, “I’m

I laughed sympathetically.

“No use just now," said “war.'

a little humiliating, I always think.

I said that I shouldn't.

A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.
III.
MY DEAR Mr. Punch,-Although,
being no longer a soldier in anything
but name (and pay), I pursue in India
the inglorious vocation of a clerk, I
am nevertheless still in a position to
erceive the splendid qualities of the
British Officer. Always a humble
admirer of his skill and bravery in
the field, I have now in addition a
keen appreciation of his imperturbable
sangfroid when confronted with con-
ditions of great difficulty in the office.
I am working in the Banana (to
been received in this office.

partment letter No. S.M.–43822/19

At his next visit to the Divisional
Office he writes back again :-". . .

43822/19 (A.B.C.), dated the 12th
December, 1914, does not appear to have

When we were mobilised I didn't
anticipate that our path would be
exactly strewn with roses, but I confess
I never expected this. I shall write to
The Times. The public ought to know
about it; ” and he settled himself more
deeply into his chair, blew out a cloud
of smoke, and with a resolute expres-
sion sipped his iced lemonade.
Mr. Punch, you will be pained to
hear that I have lost my hard-earned
reputation for sobriety through no
fault of my own. A few days ago I
went up to the barracks to draw my

giving it an obviously fictitious

quarters Staff Office, which is
situated in the town of
Suppose we call it Mango.
There are four brigades in the
Banana Divisional Area, one of
of which is the Mango Brigade.
Now it so happens that the
General Officer Commanding
the Banana Divisional Area is
at present also the General
Officer Commanding the Man-
go Brigade; consequently this is
the sort of thing which is always
happening. The G.O.C. of the
Mango Brigade writes to him-
self as G.O.C. of the Banana
Divisional Area: “May I re-
quest the favour of a reply to m
Memorandum No. 25731/24/

of Army Department letter

dated the 12th December, 1914,
which amplifies the Annexure
to Clause 271, Section 18 (c),
of A.R.I., Vol. XXIII. ?” Next
morning he goes into the Divi-
sional Office and finds himself

regimental pay, and found that
a number of articles of clothing,
issued by the Army authorities,
had accumulated for me during
my absence — a pair of khaki
shorts, a grey flannel shirt with
steel buttons the size of six-
pences, a pair of worsted socks
and three sheets (yes, sheets for
the bed; so luxuriously do we
fare in India). Perhaps you can
guess what happened.
“Oh, by the way, have you
drawn your clothing?” asked
the Lieutenant, when he had
paid me.
“Yes, Sir," I replied.
“What have you got?”
“Sheets, shirt, shorts and
shocks — shots, sheeks and
shirks nº -
“That will do,” he interrupted
sternly, “You had better come
to me again when you are in
a condition to express yourself
clearly.” -
Thus easily is a reputation
acquired by years of self-con-
trol destroyed by the pitfalls
of our native tongue. --
On the other hand, some
people have enviable reputa-
confronted by this letter. A mere civilian
might be tempted to take a mean ad-
vantage of his unusual situation. Not
so the British Officer. The dignified
traditions of the Indian Army must not
lightly be set aside. The G.O.C. of the
Brigade and the G.O.C. of the Divis-
ional Area must be as strangers for
the purposes of official correspondence.
So he writes back to himself:—“Your
| reference to Army Department letter
No. S.M.–43822/19 (A.B.C.), dated
the 12th December, 1914, is not under-
stood. May I presume that you allude
to Army Department letter No. P.T.
58.401/.364 (P.O.P.), dated the 5th No-
vember, 1914, which deals with the
Annexure to Clause 271, Section 18 (c),
of A.R.I., Vol. XXIII. 2”
Later on he goes to the Brigade
flinches from his duty, never swerves
by a hair's-breadth from his difficult
course. This surely is the spirit which
has made the Empire.
But I expect you are weary of this
subject. Still, you must please not
forget that we are officially on active
service, and active service means
perhaps more than you people at home
imagine. Last Sunday, after tiffin, I
came upon one of my colleagues lounging
in an easy-chair, one of those with
practical extensions upon which you
can stretch your legs luxuriously. With
a cigarette between his lips and an iced
drink beside him, he sat reading a
magazine—a striking illustration of the

The other night, half of what re-

to repel an expected attack on the
barracks by the other half. Walls
chanced to be placed in a rather iso-

a large boulder, after receiving whis-
pered orders from his officer not to fire
if he suspected the approach of the
enemy, but to low like an ox, when
assistance would immediately be sent
to him. -
Though a little diffident of his powers
of lowing, Walls determined to do his
best, and fell sound asleep.

Walls slumbered on undisturbed, until
a terrific roar in his ear caused him to
wake with a start. What had hap-

into the darkness. Then, to his
amazement, he saw the boulder before
him rise to its feet and shamble off into
the night. It was an ox, and it had

You might think his luck finished
there. But no. The officer and his
men came stealthily up, and Walls un-
blushingly declared that he had heard
the foe approaching. It may sound
incredible, but it is a fact that a few
minutes later the enemy did actually
appear, and were, of course, driven back
after the customary decimation.
And Walls unhesitatingly accepted
the congratulations of his superior on
his vigilance, and did not even blench
when assured that his was the finest
imitation ever heard of the lowing of

YUSSUF.
“Look here,” exclaimed the latest
subaltern, hurling himself at the re-
mains of the breakfast, “those rotters
have sent me a putrid sword "
“A putrid sword, dear?" his mother
repeated.
“Yes, confound them ' "
“I don't see why you want a sword
at all,” Dolly chipped in. “Captain
Jones says the big guns are the only
weapons that count.”
“And how will Archie toast his
crumpets?” retorted Henry.
“Oh, shut up, you kids! I say, do
you mind having a look at it?” The
latest subaltern was actually appealing
to me. I stifled a blush, and thought
I should like to, very much. -
After breakfast Archibald and myself
retired to the armoury. -
“There !” he exclaimed indignantly.
“What do you think of that?” It was
lying on the bed with a black-and-gold
hilt and a wonderſul nickel scabbard
with gilt blobs at the top. I looked at it.
“Well,” I ventured, “it’s a sword.”
Archibald sniffed. . * . . "
“And,” I continued hastily, “it’s
very nice. Perhaps they've run out of
the ordinary ones. Does it cut 2"
He drew it, and I, assuming the air
of a barber's assistant, felt its edge. *:
“Of course,” I remarked, “I don't
know much about it, but if there is
anything left to cut when you go out
I think it should be stropped a bit
first.” ** -
“Well,” said the proud owner, “I

| ordered it at Slashers', and they ought
to know. Suppose, we rub it up on
young Henry's emery wheel?". '
“Wait a minute,” I cried; “I should
like to see it on.” -
Archibald buckled on the scabbard
and I slapped the trusty blade home.
It certainly looked a bit odd. I sur-
veyed it in profile.
“No | " I exclaimed, “there is some-
thing about it . . . a Yussuf air . . .

cent of Turkestan.”
We found Henry in the workshop.
“My fairy godmother,” he shouted,
“did you pinch it from the pantomime?”
We did not deign to reply. Gingerly,
very gingerly, we applied Yussuf to
| the emery wheel . . . Little flakes came
off him—just little flakes.
It was very distressing.
The gardener joined us and advised
some oil; then the coachman brought
us some polishing sand; bath-brick and
whitening we got from the cook.
It was no good. Nothing could
restore those little flakes. So we went
indoors to have a look at the Encyclo-
to help us. Yussuf was suffering from
an absolutely unknown disease.
We put him to bed again.

After lunch Archibald received the
following letter:— .
“DEAR SIR,-We learn with regret
that, by an inadvertence, the wrong
sword has been despatched to you.
We now hasten to forward yours,
trusting that the delay has not in-
convenienced you. At the same time
our representative will, with your per-
mission, collect the sword now in your
possession as it is of exceptional value,
and also has to be inscribed immedi-
ately for presentation. -
Your obedient Servants,

“For presentation,” I repeated; “then
it's not meant to cut with, and those
blobs really are gold.” I touched one
respectfully. º,
: The latest subaltern pulled himself
together and rang the bell. “When a
man calls here for a sword,” he told
the servant, “give him this”—pointing
dramatically at Yussuf. “And Jen-
kins !”.
“Yes, Sir.”
“Tell him that I have just sailed for

THE VOLUNTEERS.
Time: 7.30 P.M. Scene : A large disused barn, where
forty members of the local Volunteer Training
Corps are assembled for drill. They are mostly men
well over thirty-eight years of age, but there is a
sprinkling of lads of under nineteen, while a few are
men of “military age" who for some good and sufficient
reason have been unable to join the army. They are all
full of enthusiasm, but at present they possess neither
uniform nor arms. Please note that in the following
dialogue the Sergeant alone speaks aloud ; the other
person thinks, but gives no utterance to his words.
The Sergeant. Fall in Fall in Come smartly there, fall in
And recollect that when you've fallen in
You stand at ease, a ten-inch space between
Your feet—like this; your hands behind your back–
Like this; your head and body both erect :
Your weight well poised on both feet, not on one.
Dress by the right, and let each rear rank man
Quick cover off his special front rank man.
That's it; that's good. Now when I say, “Squad,
- 'shun,” r
Let every leſt heel swiftly join the right
Without a shuffling or a scraping sound
And let the angle of your two feet be
Just forty-five, the while you smartly drop
Hands to your sides, the fingers lightly bent,
Thumbs to the front, but every careful thumb
Kept well behind your trouser-seams. Squad, 'shun'
The Volunteer. Ha! Though I cannot find my trouser-seams,
I rather think I did that pretty well.
Thomas, my footman, who is on my left,
And Batts, the draper, drilling on my right,
And e'en the very Sergeant must have seen
The lithe precision of my rapid spring.
The Sergeant. When next I call you to attention, note
You need not slap your hands against your thighs,
It is not right to slap your thighs at all.
The Volunteer. He's looking at me; I am half afraid
I used unnecessary violence
And slapped my thighs unduly. It is bad
That Thomas should have cause to grin at mo
And lose his proper feeling of respect,
Being a flighty fellow at the best;
And Batts the draper must not

The Volunteer. Aha! He wants to catch me, but he

The Volunteer. Bravo, myself I did not slap them then.
I am indubitably getting on.
I wonder if the Germans do these things,
And what they sound like in the German tongue.
The Germans are a

The Sergeant. Sharply number off
From right to left, and do not jerk your heads.
[They number off.
The Volunteer. I'm six, an even number, and must do
- The lion's share in forming fours. What luck
For Batts, who's five, and Thomas, who is seven.
They also serve, but only stand and wait,
While I behind the portly form of Batts
Insert myself and then slip out again
Clear to the front, observing at the word
The ordered sequence of my moving feet.
Come let me brace myself and dare
The Sergeant. Form fours!
The Volunteer. I cannot see the Sergeant; I'm obscured
Indeed it is a very noble back
And would protect me if we charged in fours
Against the Germans, but I rather think
We charge two deep, and therefore—
The Sergeant. Form two deep!
The Volunteer. Thank Heaven I'm there, although I mixed
my feet!
I am oblivious of the little things
That mark the due observance of a drill;
And Thomas sees my faults and grins again.
Let him grin on ; my time will come once more
At dinner, when he hands the Brussels sprouts.
- - [The drill proceeds.
Now we're in fours and marching like the wind.
This is more like it; this is what we need
To make us quit ourselves like regulars.
Left, right, left, right! The Sergeant gives it out .
As if he meant it. Stepping out like this -**
We should breed terror in the German hordes
And drive them off. The Sergeant has a gleam
In either eye; I think he's proud of us.
Or does he meditate some stratagem
To spoil our marching? - º
The Sergeant. On the left form squad!
The Volunteer. There ! He has done it ! . He has ruined us!
I'm lost past hope, and Thomas, too, is lost;
And in a press of lost and tangled men —
The great broad back of Batts heaves miles away.
[The Sergeant explains and the drill proceeds.
The Volunteer. No matter; we shall some day learn it all,
The standing difference 'twixt our left and right,
The bayonet exercise, the musketry,
And all the things a soldier does with ease.

To Tipperary, but my heart's

MARCH AIRs.
AT long last the War Office is waking up to the value of
bands for military purposes, and a good deal of interest
will be aroused by the discussion now proceeding as to the
best airs for use on the march. r
The following suggestions have been hastily collected by
wireless and other means:– * *
From the Trenches: “Why not try ‘Come into the
garden mud'?”
From a very new Subaltern: “I had thought of ‘John
Brown's Body,' but personally I am more concerned just
now with Sam Browne's Belt.”
From a Zeppelin-driver: “There's an old Scotch song
that I have tried successfully on one of our naval lieutenants.
It runs like this:—
O, I'll tak the high road and you'll tak’ the low road,
An' I'll be in Yarmouth afore ye.”
From the Captain of the Sydney: “What's the matter
with ‘The Jolly Müller’?”
From President WILSON: “Have you thought of ‘The
little rift within the lute,’ as played by our Contra-band?".
From Admiral voN TIRPITz: “A familiar air with me is
“Crocked in the cradle of the deep.’”
From Sir Edward GREY: “If it could be done diplo-
matically, I should like to see recommended, “Dacia, Dacia,
give me your answer, do.’”
From the Crew of the Lion :

From an East Coast Mayor: “Begone, dull scare!”

ARGYLE STREET UNLESS A POLISMAN HELPIT YE.''
DOD,
MAN, YE HAVENA As MUCKLE STRATEEGY As wad TAR' YE ACROSS
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
The German War Book (MURRAY) is a work in whose
authenticity many of us would have refused to believe this
time last year. ... It is a pity indeed that it was not then in
the hands of all those who still clung to the theory that
the Prussian was a civilised and humane being. However,
now that everyone can read it, translated and with a wholly
admirable preface by Professor J.H. MoRGAN, it is to be hoped
that the detestable little volume will have a wide publicity.
True, it can add little to our recent knowledge of the enemy
of mankind; but it is something to have his guiding
principles set down upon the authority of his own hand.
Cynical is hardly an adequate epithet for them; indeed I
do not know that the word exists that could do full justice
to the compound of hypocrisy and calculated brutishness
that makes up this manual. It may at first strike the
reader as surprising to find himself confronted by sentiments
almost, one might say, of moderation and benevolence.
He will ask with astonishment if the writer has not, after
all, been maligned. Defore long, however, he will discover
that all this morality is very carefully made conditional,
and that the conditions are wide. In short, as the Preface
puts it, the peculiar logic of the book consists in “osten-
tatiously laying down unimpeachable rules, and then
quietly destroying them by debilitating exceptions.” For
example, on the question of exposing the inhabitants of
occupied territory to the fire of their own troops—the now
notorious Prussian method of “women and children first"
—the War Book, while admitting pious distaste for such
practice, blandly argues that its “main justification” lies in
its success. Thus, with sobs and tears, like the walrus,
serviceable infamies. At the day of reckoning what a
witness will this little book bel Out of their own mouths
they stand here condemned through all the ages.
Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD, chief of novelists-with-a-purpose,
vehemently eschews the detachment of the Art-for-Art's-
Saker, while a long and honourable practice has enabled
her to make her stories bear the burden of her theses much
more comfortably than would seem theoretically possible.
Delia Blanchflower (WARD, Lock) is a suffrage novel, dedi-
cated with wholesome intent to the younger generation,
and if one compares the talented author's previous record
of uncompromising, and indeed rather truculent, anti-
suffrage utterances one may note (with approval or dismay)
a considerable broadening of view on the vexed question.
For her attack here is delivered exclusively on the militant
position. Quite a number of decent folk in her pages are
suffragistically inclined, and there is a general admission
that the eager feet that throng the hill of the Vote are not
by any means uniformly shod in elastic-sided boots, if one
may speak a parable. It is a very notable admission and
does the writer honour; for such revisions are rare with
veteran and committed campaigners. The story is laid in
the far-away era of the burnings of cricket pavilions and
the lesser country houses. Delia is a beautiful goddess-
heiress of twenty-two, with eyes of flame and a will of steel,
a very agreeable and winning heroine. Her tutor, Gertrude
Marvell, the desperate villain of the piece, a brilliant fanatic
(crossed in love in early youth), wins the younger girl's
affections and inspires and accepts her dedication of self
and fortune to the grim purposes of the “Daughters of
Revolt.” Mark Winnington, her guardian, appointed by
her father to counteract the tutor's baleful influence, finds

















the Great General Staff cnumerates its suggested list of
both women a tough proposition. For Gertrude has brains

to back her fanaticism, and Delia is a spirited handful of a
ward. Loyalty to her consecration and to her friend
outlast her belief in the methods of the revolting ones.
Her defences are finally ruined by Cupid, for Mark is a
handsome athletic man of forty or so, a paragon of knightly
courtesy and persuasive speech and silences, and compares
very favourably with the policemen in Parliament Square.
Poor Gertrude makes a tragic end in a fire of her own
kindling, so that the moral for the younger generation
cannot be said to be set forth in ambiguous terms.
Arundel (FISHER UNWIN) is one of those stories that
begins with a Prologue; and as this was only mildly inter-
Love never seems to run a smooth course for girls of the
name of Joan; their affairs of heart, whatever the final
issue may be, have complex beginnings and make difficult,
at times dismal, progress. I attribute the rejection of the

it appeared that, like a

when this was done, up went
the curtain upon the play

abode of such unmixed and
giddy joy that I have been
chortling over the memory of

Elizabeth, fiercely alive and compelling, the ideal of poor
Edward's dreams. Naturally, therefore, there is the devil

makes the book, first, last and all the time. She is a gem
of purest ray serene, and my words that would praise her
are impotent things. Only unlimited quotation could do
justice to her sleek self-deception and little comfortable
meannesses. In short, as a contemporary portrait, the mis-

THE MARK OF THE BEAST.
(With acknowledgments to a cartoon by Mr. WILL Dyson.)
[In a Munich paper Herr GANGHoFER recites the following remark
of the KAISER's, whose special journalistic confidant he is said to
be:–“To possess Kultur means to have the deepest conscientiousness
and the highest morality. My Germans possess that."]
'Tis enough that we know you have said it;
We feel that the facts correspond
With your speech as a Person of credit,
Whose word is as good as his bond;
Who are we that our critics should quarrel
With the flattering doctrine you preach—
That the German, in all that is moral,
Is an absolute peach 2 *
But the puzzle grows odder and odder:
If your people are spotless of blame,
Being perfectly sound cannon-fodder,
Then whose is the fault and the shame?
If it's just from a deep sense of duty
That they prey upon woman and priest,
And their minds are a model of Beauty,
Then who is the Beast 2
For a Beast is at work in this matter;
We have seen—and the traces endure—
The red blood of the innocent spatter
The print of his horrible spoor;
On their snouts, like the lovers of Circe—
Your men that are changed into swine —
The Mark of the Beast-without-mercy
Is set for a sign.
You have posed (next to God) as the pillar
That steadies the fabric of State, -
Whence issues the brave baby-killer
Supplied with his hymnal of hate;
Once known for a chivalrous knight, he
Now hogs with the Gadarene herd;
Since it can't be the other Almighty,
How has it occurred ?
When at last they begin to be weary
Of sluicing their virtues in slime,
And they put the embarrassing query:—
“Who turned us to brutes of the prime 2
Full of culture and most conscientious,
Who made us a bestial crew 2
Who pounded the poisons that drench us?”—
I wouldn't be you. O. S.
THE PLAINT OF A BRITISH DACHSHUND.
DEAR Mr. Punch,--I desire to address you on a painful
subject. Let me state that I am (1) a dachshund of
unblemished character; (2) a British-born subject; (3) a
member of a family which, though originally of foreign
extraction, has for several generations been honourably
domiciled in one of the most exclusive and aristocratic of
our English country seats. Imagine then the surprise and
indignation experienced by myself, my wife and our only
daughter when, shortly after the opening of the present
unfortunate hostilities between our country and a certain
continental Power, we found the atmosphere of friendly,
nay, affectionate respect with which we had so long been
surrounded becoming gradually superseded by one of
suspicion and animosity.
The ball was started by Macalister, an Aberdeen terrier
of unprincipled character, who has never forgiven me for
the bad taste to make last spring to my daughter. He had
had the impertinence to approach me with a large (and, I
confess, a distinctly succulent-looking) object, which he
laid with an oily smile on the ground before my nose. But
I had heard from Gertrude (my wife) of his attentions to
our offspring, and I saw through the ruse.
“If you imagine,” I said, “for one moment that this
insidious offer of a stolen bone will induce a gentleman of
family to countenance an engagement between his daughter
and an advertisement for Scotch whisky you are greatly
mistaken. Be off with you, and never let me see your
ruffianly whiskers near my basket again!”
Rather severe, no doubt, but when I am deeply moved I
seldom mince matters; in fact, as a Briton, 1 prefer to hit
out straight from the shoulder. In any case, for the time
being it settled Macalister.
I say for the time being. In the autumn he had his
revenge. One morning early in October I was walking
down the drive accompanied by a recent arrival within our
circle, a rather brainless St. Bernard (who gave his name
with a lisp as “Bwuno"), when we met my child's rejected
suitor. Since the incident mentioned above I had con-
sistently cut Macalister, and I passed him now without
recognition. No sooner was he by, however, and at a safe
distance, than he deliberately turned and snarled over his
shoulder at me the offensive epithet, “Potsdammer 1"
My blood boiled; I longed to bury my teeth in the
scoundrel's throat; but I remembered that Gertrude had
once told me that galloping made me look ridiculous.
So I affected not to hear the insult, and proceeded, out-
wardly calm, with my morning constitutional. But, for
some reason or other, Bruno's flow of small talk appeared
suddenly to dry up, and once or twice I detected him
looking at me curiously out of the corners of his eyes.
Next day, on my calling for him as usual he pleaded a
cold. His manner struck me as odd; still I accepted his
excuse. But when the cold had lasted, without any per-
ceptible loss of appetite, for a fortnight, and I had seen him
meanwhile on two occasions actually rabbiting (an absurd
pastime for a St. Bernard) with Macalister, I saw what
had happened and decided to ask him what he meant by
it. He endeavoured to assume a conciliatory attitude, but
the long and short of it was, he said, that as a Swiss, and
therefore a neutral, it was impossible for him to be too
careful, and he feared that my society might compromise
him. I did not argue with him; it would merely have
involved a loss of dignity to do so.
Since that time, though we have endured in silence, the
lot of myself and my family has been a hard one. We
have been fed and housed as usual, it is true, but when one
has been accustomed to live on terms of the most privileged
friendship with a household it is galling to find oneself
suddenly treated by every member of it, from the butler
downwards, as a prisoner of war. I am not even allowed
now to bite the postmen; and I used to enjoy them so
much, especially the evening one, who wears quite thin
trousers. Our only consolation has been the hope that our
misfortune might be an isolated instance. To-day, however,
I learn that it is not so. I have discovered by my basket
(and I have reason to think that they were conveyed
thither by the malignant Macalister) three humorous (?)
sketches depicting members of my race in situations which
I can only describe as ridiculous, and obviously insinuating
that they were to be regarded as aliens.
I appeal to you, Sir, as a lover of justice and animals,
to put this matter right with the public, for the life that
a British dachshund has to lead at the present moment is
what is vulgarly known as a dog's life.

cion he was icing the water. Before
November was in I had given up
sitting outside my tent. My bathing I
decided (one cold wet morning) should
take place under cover, either at the
Golf Club or at some kindly person's
house.
A few days later, not being on duty,
I had arranged to dine with the Fer-
gusons. In the late afternoon I strode
into the Golf Club and had a hot bath.
From there I wandered into town,
where I met Mrs. Johnston.
“Hello!” she said. “I’m just going
home. Won't you come with me?”
Mrs. Johnston is one in a thousand.
“Rather,” I agreed. “Forward—
by the right.”
Tea over, my hostess turned to me
brightly. “Now,” she said, “I know
what it must be in camp. I'm sure
you'd like a nice hot bath,” and she
Somehow I didn't tell her I’d had one
at the Club. You might have done
differently perhaps, but—well, the little
lady was beaming hospitality; was it
for me to stifle her generous intentions?
I thought not.
I went upstairs and splashed man-
fully.
For the third time that day I
dressed; then I went downstairs and
found Johnston.
“Hello,” he said.

I stiffened perceptibly at “good.”
We chatted a little while, then I
breathed my sincere thanks and left
them.
My arrival at the Fergusons' was
rather early, somewhere about seven-
thirty. I was shown into the drawing-
room while the maid went to inform
Mrs. Ferguson of my arrival. In two
minutes she returned.
“Will you come this way, Sir?” she
said.
I went that way.
Ten minutes later I emerged from
Ferguson's bath and walked into his
dressing-room. Ferguson had arrived.
“Hello!” he said. “Been having a

fourth time.
It was eleven o'clock when I got back
to camp, and I found to my surprise
that the Mess had been moved from
the tent to the new hut. -
“Hello!” they said, “how do you
like the new quarters?
I surveyed the bare boards.
“Topping,” I replied, “but it's not
anywhere near finished.”
“No,” said the Junior Major, “but

I looked at him blankly. “I’ve had

I might have known it was foolish;
the Junior Major is still young.
“It's up to the subalterns,” he sug-
gested, “to see he has No. 4.”
They saw to it.
“Baron von Bissing, the Governor
of Belgium,” says The Central News,

IN OUAINTEST CINEMALAND.
IN these troublous times Cinemaland is about the only
foreign country in which it is possible to travel for pleasure.
It has occurred to me that some account of its curious
manners and customs may not be without interest for such
readers as are still unacquainted with them.
As Cinemaland contains many departments, each of
which has peculiarities of its own, I cannot attempt more
than a general description. -
The chief national industry is the chase of fugitives. In
some departments this is done on horseback, with a con-
siderable and rather aimless expenditure of ammunition;
in others by motor car, or along the roofs of railway
carriages.
concerned with exercise and excitement. The women are,
almost without exception, young and extremely prepossess-
ing. Nature has endowed them, among other personal
It seems a healthy pursuit and provides all
fancy the stealing must be done from sheer wanton
devilry.
Crime in Cinemaland is invariably detected sooner or
later, though I doubt if it would be but for a careless
practice among criminals there of carrying in their breast-
pockets the document that proves their guilt. They seem
to have a superstitious idea that to destroy it would bring
them bad luck.
The exterior of a private mansion in a fashionable
Cinemian suburb is stately and imposing, but the interior
is generally disappointing, the rooms being small and over-
crowded with furniture that is showy without being dis-
tinguished. In some houses the owners appear to have a
taste for collecting antiques and to have been grossly
imposed upon by dealers.
It is usual for young couples with a very moderate
income to keep not only a smart parlourmaid but a butler
as well. The manner of all Cinemian domestics is one

..advantages, with superb teeth, [.
of which they make a pardon-
ably ostentatious display on the
slightest provocation. They are
all magnificent horsewomen and
fearless swimmers, and they do'
not in the least mind spoiling
their clothes.
In their domestic circles, how:
ever, they show a feminine and
clinging disposition, with a .
marked tendency to fall in love
at first sight with any undesir-
able stranger. -
The principal occupation of
the children is reconciling es-
tranged parents by contracting
serious illnesses or getting run
over. The latter is even easier
to manage in Cinemaland than
in any London thoroughfare.'
I have seldom, if ever, seen an
aged Cinemian grandparent, a
long-lost wife, or a strayed
child try to cross the emptiest
street without being immedi-
ately bowled over by a motor.

so low and so often, but they |
appear to like it in Cinemaland.
Social etiquette- there has
exigencies that are all its own.
For example, a guest at an
evening party who happens to
lose a brooch or necklace is
expected at once to stop the
festivities by complaining to
her hostess and insisting on a
constable being called in to
search everybody present. . . It
might be thought that Cinemian

this time that the person in
whose possession the missing
article is discovered is abso-

the supposed culprit is always
hauled off (with quite unneces-
sary violence) to prison, amidst

But then Science of any kind seems to be a dangerous
and unprofitable occupation there. The inventor, designer,
or discoverer of anything is simply asking for trouble. If
he doesn't blow himself up in his laboratory and get
blinded for life, some envious rival is certain to undertake
this for him. Or else a vague villain will steal his formula

whiskers. And the extraordinary part of it is that no
Cinemian has ever invented anything yet of which the

most of their professional income from marrying runaway
couples in back parlours.
In certain departments it is a frequent practice to dress
up in Federal and Confederate uniforms and engage in
desperate conflict. I have witnessed battles there with
love; a hundred combatants on each side. There was a
profusion of flags and white smoke on these occasions, but,

singularly high-strung, not to say jerky, race, the women
especially betraying their emotions with a primitive absence
of self-control. There, the pleasure of the chase has become
a delirious orgy, though much valuable time is lost both
by pursuers and pursued, owing to an inveterate habit of
stopping and leaping high at intervals. Squinting is a not
uncommon affliction, as is also abnormal stoutness, the
latter, however, being always combined with a surprising
agility. In personal encounters, which are by no means
uncommon, it is considered not only legitimate but laud-
able to kick the adversary whenever he turns his back, and
also to spring at him, encircle his waist with your legs, and
bite his ear. The local police are all either overgrown or
undersized, and have been carefully trained to fall over one
another at about every five yards. As guardians of the peace,
however, I prefer our own force.
I could not have written even so brief an account as this
unless I had paid many visits to Cinemaland. If I am
spared I fully expect to pay many more. The truth is that
I cannot keep away from the country. Why, I can't ex-
plain, but I fancy it is because it is so absolutely unlike any
other country with which I happen to be familiar. F. A.
“The practice of compulsorily enrolling men for defence against
invasion can be traced from before the time of Alfred the Great,
when every man between 18 and 60 had to serve right up to the
time of the Napoleonic wars.”—Saturday Review.
It was found, however, that men who had enlisted in
ALFRED THE GREAT's time at the age of sixty were of little
FLEET WISIONS SEEN THROUGH GERMAN EYES.
[A number of curious facts about the British Army, lately gathered
from German sources, may be supplemented by some further infor-
mation of interest bearing on our Fleet.] -
THE facts may be obscured for purposes of recruiting, but
it remains true that British seamen are no better than serfs.
Their officers have the most complete proprietorship in their
persons and can do with them what they like, as in the
case of the English captain who had a favourite shark,
which followed his ship, and to which he threw an A.B.

men is shown by their custom of referring to the Captain as
“The Owner.” -
The savagery of the British Navy has passed into a
by-word, and the bluejackets popularly go by the name of
Jack Tartars.
It is all very well for America to protest her neutrality
to Berlin, but how can we ignore the fact that President
WILsoN actually has a seat on the board of the British
Admiralty—where he is known as “Tug" WILSON. He is
even the author of a work aimed deliberately at us, and
entitled Der Tug.

HOW TO DEAL WITH SUBMARINES.
[“The Syren and Shipping offers £500 to
the captain, officers and crew of the first
British merchant vessel which succeeds in
sinking a German submarine.”—The Times.]
IN order to assist captains of merchant
ships to deal with raiding submarines,
a few suggestions and comments, which
it is hoped will be helpſul, are offered
by our Naval Expert.
In the absence of a 4-7 naval gun,
a provision suggested as useful by
a writer in The Times, any 13-inch
shells that you happen to have on
board might be hoisted over the side,
disguised as bunches of bananas, and
dropped on to the offending sub-
marine. If this does not sink her
at once, additional bunches should be
dropped.
But before disposing of your shells
be sure that your submarine is close
alongside. In case she should hold off,
let the first mate beckon to her, in a
manner as nonchalant as possible, to
come closer.
When the enemy boards your ship,
the captain should endeavour to interest
news from German bulletins, whilst
the bo'sun, the second steward and the
stewardess, with the aid of peashooters,
pour liquid explosive down the sub-
marine's periscope.
If you are fortunate enough to have
on board one of those trained sea lions
which have been showing for some
years at the music-halls, you need not
trouble to practise the subterfuges given
above. On the enemy's submarine
making her appearance on the starboard
side you should lower your sea lion over
the port side, preferably near the stern,
having previously attached to it a bomb
connected with wires to a battery.
When the sea lion is close to the sub-
marine just press the button. Possibly
you will lose your pet, but the general
result should be satisfactory.
Owing to unavoidable circumstances
you may not be able to put into practice
any of these hints. If that be so, when
the enemy comes aboard, work up a
heated discussion on the origin of the
War. If skilfully managed, you should
draw into the discussion the entire
company of the submarine, with the
possibly be got out of your difficulty by
one of our patrol ships.
Should all and every one of these
expedients be useless, as a forlorn hope
you should read aloud the appropriate
clauses of the Hague Convention, and
at the same time take the names and
addresses of the boarding party for
future reference.
If you have an amateur photographer
aboard, let him get going. The pay-
ment made by illustrated papers for
pictures that reproduce the sinking of
your ship will probably exceed the
value of the ship, so that in any case
your owners will not lose by the deal.
But it is always best, where possible,
to sink the submarine.
From a letter in The Liverpool
Echo :—
“At a time like this we must be prepared
to have our prejudices shattered. When the
whole world has been turned upside down,
is it fair that women should be left standing
still?”
It is a delicate question, and the
women must be left to take up their

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, 2nd
February.—First business on resump-
tion of sittings after Recess was issue
of writ for election of Member for Ship-
ley Division of Yorkshire to fill the seat
of PERCY ILLINGworTH, whose place on
Treasury Bench and in Whips' Room
will know him no more.
Herein a tragedy notable even amid
absorbing interest of the War. When
in last week of November House ad-
journed for recess, the CHIEF LIBERAL
WHIP was in what seemed to be per-
fection of health. A little tired perhaps
with exhausting labour of prolonged
Session, but cheerily looking forward
to interval of comparative rest. Physic-
ally and intellectually in the prime of
life, he had happy constitutional turn of
making the best of everything. A good
sportsman, a famed footballer, healthy
in mind and body, he habitually
counteracted influence of sedentary
life by outdoor exercise. If one had
cast an eye round Benches on both
sides and estimated which was the
most likely man for whose county or
borough a writ would, on reassem-
bling of Parliament, be moved to fill
vacancy created by his death, one
would last of all have thought of
PERCY ILLINGworTH.
Two years ago selection by PRIME
MINISTER of a young, comparatively
unknown, inexperienced man to fill
important post of Chief Ministerial
Whip was regarded with some surprise.
That shrewd judge of character and
capacity as usual justified by the event.
ILLINGworTH speedily made his mark.
Courteous in manner, frank in speech,
swift and capable in control of circum-
stance, he gained, and in increasing
measure maintained, that confidence
and personal popularity indispensable
to the successful Whip.
Pleasant for his many friends to think
that he lived long enough to have con-
ferred upon him a Privy Councillorship
—a simple title, but good enough for
PEEL and GLADSTONE, and for DIzzy
throughout the plenitude of his prime.
It was not without emotion that
GULLAND, promoted to the Chair in the
Whips' Room vacated by his esteemed
Leader, moved the writ. He was com-
forted and encouraged by hearty cheers,
not wholly confined to Ministerial side,
approving the PREMIER's choice.

Questions about enemy alien and the

Members had droned along for some
time Mr. GINNELL, who classifies him-
self as “an Independent Nationalist,”
presented himself from below Gang-
way. First distinguished himself above
common horde on occasion of elec.
tion of SPEAKER at opening sitting
of present Parliament. The SPEAKER
being as yet non-existent, the authority
of the Chair undelegated, he had House
at his mercy. Might talk as long as he
pleased, say what he thought proper,
with none to call him to order. Used
opportunity to make violent personal
attack on SPEAKER-DESIGNATE.
Up again now on same tack. Appears
that yesterday he handed in at the
Table two Bills he proposed to carry
through. No record of the procedure
on to-day's Paper. Mr. GINNELL smelt
a rat. He “saw it moving in the air”
in person of the SPEAKER, who was
“perverting against the House powers
conferred on him for the maintenance
of its functions and its privileges.”
Mr. GINNELL not sort of man to stand
this. Proposed to indict SPEAKER for
misconduct. But not disposed to be
unreasonable; always ready to oblige.
“If,” he said, addressing the SPEAKER,
“I should be out of order now, may I
to-morrow call attention to your con-
duct in the Chair?”
SPEARER cautiously replied that be-
fore ruling on the point he would like
to see the terms of motion put down on
the Paper.
Thereupon Mr. GINNELL proceeded
to read a few remarks not entirely
complimentary to the SPEAKER, which
for greater accuracy he had written out
on what PRINCE ARTHUR once alluded
to as a sheet of notepaper. Holding
this firmly with both hands, lest some
myrmidon of the Chair should snatch
it from him, he emphasised his points
by bobbing it up and down between his
chin and his knee. Whilst primarily
denunciatory of the SPEAKER he had
a word to say in reproof of PRIME
MINISTER, whose concession to private
Members of opportunity for an hour's
talk on motion for adjournment he
described as being “like cutting off a
private Member's head, then clipping
off a portion of his ear and throwing it
to his relatives.”

'formed any mental pictures of my first
Christmas as a Territorial in India, let
me hasten to assure you that every
single one of them was wrong. I
neither took part in the uproarious
festivities of the Barracks nor shared
the more dignified rejoicings of the
Staff Office in which I am condemned
for a time to waste my military talents.
An unexpected five days' holiday, and
a still more unexpected windfall of
Rs. 4 as a Christmas Box (fabulous
gift for an impecunious private) enabled
me to pay a visit to some relatives,
who live at, well One has to be

is a place rich in historical
interest and scenic beauties. Freed
from the rigid bonds of military disci-
pline and the still more hampering
restrictions of official routine, I was at
liberty to enjoy them to the full. It
was the opportunity of a lifetime to see
something of the real India. Did I
take it? No, Mr. Punch, to be honest,
I did not. - -
- one thing.
of Army active service rations, of
greasy mess tins and enamelled iron
mugs, I found myself suddenly con-
fronted by civilised food waiting to be
eaten in a civilised fashion. And I fell.
Starting with chota hazri at 7 A.M., I
ate steadily every day till midnight.
That is how I spent my holiday. I
may as well complete this shameful
confession; it was the best time I ever
had in my life.
I feel confident that my stomachic
feats will never be forgotten in
I shouldn't be surprised if in years to
come the natives are found worshipping
a tree trunk or stone monolith rudely
earved into the semblance of an obese
Territorial. It is pleasant to think that
one may even have founded a new
religion.
But I am grieved and troubled about
I ate plantains and guavas
and sweet limes and Cape gooseberries
and pomolos and numberless other
Indian fruits (Obliss'), but not custard
apples. Custard apples, it appears, are
the best of all, and they went out of
season just before I arrived in India
and will not come into season again
for months and months.
I am confident that you will appre-
ciate my predicament. I want the War
custard apples. I want to get to the
Front and have a go at the Germans,
but I desire passionately to eat custard
apples. I want to get home again to
you, but after all I have heard about
them I feel that my life will have been
lived in vain if I do not eat custard
apples. It is a trying position.
Home was very much in my thoughts
at Christmas time. The fact of having
relatives around me, the plum pudding,
the mince pies, the mistletoe, the clean
. plates, the china cups and saucers, the
crackers, the cushions, the absence of
stew, -all these and many other cir-
cumstances served to remind me vividly
of the old life in England. And when
regretfully I left , and (like a true
soldier cheerfully running desperate
risks) travelled back in a first-class
carriage with a third-class ticket, I
found at the Office yet another re-
minder of home and the old days. My
kindly colleagues had determined that
I should not feel I was in a strange
land amid alien customs. They had
let all the work accumulate while I
was away and had it waiting for me
in a vast pile on my return. -

THE CHEERY DOGS.
I.—Mr. A.
“WELL, what have we done?—that's
what I want to know. Where are the
Germans? In France and Belgium.
Where are we ? This side of them.
Where is their Navy 2 Still only too
active. And so it goes on. My dear
fellow, I like to be cheerful, but you
give me no material to do it on. The
cold truth is that we are just where we
were months ago. ‘Time is on our
side,' you say. May be; but the War
can't go on for ever, and meanwhile
look at things here—food rising, coal
rising, distress all around. What do
you think the income-tax is going to be
soon 2 Ha! Still it does not do to air
those opinions and doubts. We must
all be gay. That is our first duty.”
II.—Mr. B.
“Yes, of course there's Russia, as
you say. But what is Russia? You
know what Russia is. They've no
heart in fighting, and I'm told that
many personages in high places, and
one very high indeed, are moving
at this moment towards peace. That
would be a nice thing, wouldn't it? It
would liberate all the East frontier
men and guns to come over to the West.
And there's another thing about Russia
too—how is it to get any more ammu-
nition into the country with Archangel
frozen 2 I suppose you know that we
have been supplying them with ammu-
nition ever since the start; and there's
precious little left, I can tell you. You
didn't know that? You surprise me.
No, it doesn't do to lean too much on
Russia. And money too. Where is
that coming from ? For ultimately,
you know, all wars are ſought with
money. We shall have to find that
too. So it isn't too easy to grin, is
it? And yet I flatter myself that I
succeed in conveying an impression
of distinct optimism.”
III.-Mr. C.
“Well, of course, if all the naturalised
Germans in this country are not in-
terned we have only ourselves to thank
if we are completely conquered. Think
of the terrible advantage to the enemy
to have waiters spying on the guests in
hotels and at once communicating with
Berlin | What chanco have we if that
kind of thing goes on ? I was in an
hotel at Aylesbury only yesterday, and
I am sure a waiter there was a German,
although he was called Swiss. He
watched everything I ate. I tell you
there are German spies everywhere.
What can a waiter at Aylesbury tell
Berlin 2 Ah! that 's what we don't
highest moment and all to our disad-
vantage in war. But we have spies
too? Never. I can't believe that
England would ever be clever enough
to make use of any system of secret
service. No, Sir, we're back numbers.
Still, it mustn't get out. We must all
pretend, as I do, that everything is all
right.”
IV.-Mr. D.
“I don't like the look of things in
America, I can assure you. Anything
but satisfactory. DERNBURG's a clover
fellow and the politicians can't forget
what the German vote means to them.
I see nothing but trouble for us there.
This Shipping Purchase Bill—that's
very grave, you know; and they don't
like us—it's no use pretending that
they do. I read an extract only this
morning from a most significant article
in The Wells Fargo Tri-Weekly Leaflet
which shows only too clearly how the
wind is blowing. No, I view America
and its share in the future with the
gloomiest forebodings, although of
course I do my best to conceal them.
To the world I turn as brave a face as
anyone, I trust.”
W.—Mr. E.
“I don't doubt the bravery of the
French; but what I do say is, where is
the advance we were promised ? Nib-
bling is all very well, but meanwhile
men are dying by the thousand, and
the Germans are still in the invaded
country. I hear too of serious disaffec-
tion in France. There's a stop-the-
war party there, growing in strength
every day. We'll have 'em here soon,
mark my words. The French have no
stomach for long campaigns. They
want their results quickly, and then
back to their meals again. I take a
very serious view of the situation, I can
tell you, although I do all I can to
keep bright and hopeful, and disguise
my real feelings.”
WI.—Mr. F.
“This activity of the German sub-
marines is most depressing. Man for
man we may have a better navy, but
when it comes to submarines they beat
us. What kind of chance have we
against these stealthy invisible death-
dealers? They're the things that are
going to do for us. I can see it coming.
But I keep the fact to myself as much
as possible—one must not be a wet
blanket.”
VII.-Mr. G.
“If only we had a decent govern-
ment, instead of this set of weaklings, I
should feel more secure. But with this
Cabinet—some of them pro-Germans
at heart, if the truth were known—what
drag party politics in now. We must
be solid for the country, and if anyone
raises his voice against the Liberals in
my presence he gets it hot, I can tell
you. . None the less a good rousing
attack by BoxAR LAw on the Govern-
ment, root and branch, every few days
would be a grand thing. As I always
say, the duty of the Opposition is to
oppose.”

“AREN'T music publishers madden-

that promises awfully well, and breaks

I went over to the piano.
On the music-rest was a sheet of
music, back to front, showing the open-
ing bars of several songs the publishers
wished to commend to our motice;
appetisers, as it were.
Clarice played the opening bars, the
only ones which were given.
“Please continue,” I said; “I’m
beginning to like it already.” .
“How can I ?” said Clarice. “How
do I know how it goes on ? lt's simply
maddening.”
“Aren't there any rules?” I said.
“What I mean is, don't certain notes
follow certain other notes?”
“Not necessarily,” said Clarice.
“Why should they?”
“Why shouldn't they 2” I persisted.
“In hockey, footer, billiards and the
other arts certain movements are in-
evitably followed by certain conse-
quences. It ought to be the same in
music. However, as a poet it is the

“Which soon wasn't fit to be seen,”
said Clarice.
“Bravo,” I said, “very soulful. Now
look at the one above it: ‘The rosy glow
of summer is on thy dimpled cheek,
While ' There's a poser for you.”
“Oh, how pretty 1" said Clarice.
“And listen to the tune.” She played
what notes there were two or three
times over. “I really must get that
one,” she added.
“Do,” I said. “I should like to
hear more about that girl. These

“You dream of dinner chiefly, I've
noticed,” said Clarice.
“That's the idea,” I said. “Of

I took up another sheet of music
and hunted for more treasure. “Here's
something fruity,” I said, “published
by Scarey and Co.: “Oh, the lover hills
are happy at the dawning of the day;
There are winds to kiss and bless us,

“What?” said Clarice.
“How should I know?” I said.
“Let's get the song and find out.

Clarice.
“Yes, certainly,” I said. “It’s good

TheRE are few living writers of romance who can carry
the sword and doublet with the ease of Miss MARJorie
Bowen. She has long since proved herself a practised
mistress of mediaevalism, and The Carnival of Florence
(METHUEN) finds her therefore on sure ground. It is a
pleasantly stimulating tale of love and adventure in the days
of SAvoNARola. The heroine is one Aprilis, a fair Floren-
tine whose matrimonial affairs were complicated by the
fact that early in the story she had been abducted (strictly
pour le bon motif in order to score off the gentleman to
whom she was then engaged) by the too notorious PIERo
DEI MEDICI. The unfortunate results were twofold, for
though Aprilis was returned unharmed to her father's
house her noble betrothed would have no more of her, so
she had to put up with another husband who took her for
charity, and to suffer in addition the pangs of unrequited
love for the Lord of Florence whom she was unable to
forget. What happened—how the MEDICI were turned
from their heritage, and the part played in all this by the

ELIoT 2 The present story is dedicated “In Memory of
Florence, Summer 1914.” Presumably, therefore, Miss
very vividly recalled by her pages—memories of a June
evening when, as in the days of which she writes, the
Piazza della Signoria echoed to the clash of swords and
the tumult of an angry mob. That it has thus reminded
me of what would, but for greater happenings since, have
been one of my most thrilling chimney-corner reminis-
cences, is among the pleasures that I owe to a stirring and
successful novel.
Among my favourite gambits in fiction is the return to his
impoverished home of one who left it a supposed wastrel,
and has now lots and lots of money. Personally, if I have
a preference, it is that my wanderer should be at first
unrecognised; but I am perhaps too fastidious. Certainly
I am not going to complain about Big Tremaine (MILLs
AND Boon) just because when he came back to the Virginian
township that he had quitted as a bank thief his old
coloured nurse saw through him in once. There is, of
course, Homeric precedent for the situation; it is one that,
deftly handled, can scarcely fail of its effect. And the
story of Big Tremaine is very deftly handled almost all
through. MARIE VAN Worst evidently knows the gentle
Southern life thoroughly; her pictures of it have served
to increase my conviction that Virginia must be one of the
pleasantest places on earth. Not less true and delicate is
her treatment of the relations between masterful Tremaine
and the gently obstinate mother who turns so slowly from
distrust to adoration of her returned son. There are, in

Bowen shares with me certain memories that have been
short, a great many qualities in this story that I have

found vastly agreeable. Also what seems to me one big
defect. But as this latter is so far essential that without
it there would be no story I am unable further to tell
you about it. Still, I am bound to say that its revelation
was a nasty shock to my admiration, which had been
roused more than anything else by the sincerity and un-
conventionality of the argument. This is a matter on
which you shall pass your own verdict. Mine would be
“A Happy Ending committed through unjustified fear of the
libraries”; and in view of the charm of her earlier chapters
I should discharge the author with a friendly caution.
Most of us might freely confess to some vagueness in our
minds as to “the social and - -
economic state of things in
the Prairie Provinces of the
Dominion,” and not a few
of us are ready to spend
five shillings and a leisure
hour or two in finding out
for certain, if only to be
prepared with a refuge in
the event of England being
Teutonised. Miss E. B.
MITCHELL, the author of In
Western Canada. Before the
War (MURRAY), knows her
subject at first hand and
deals with the right matter
in the right manner for our
purpose; that is to say,
she is discriminating in her
selection of topics and is
always pleasant if never
violently exciting or amus-
ing in her treatment of
them. The book is short,
as such books should be;
it does not pretend to be
exhaustive, yet it leaves a
very clear and precise im-
pression on the mind. But

will have been waiting for
this “but") why on earth

European conditions and would have been published just
about this time even if we had been at peace with everybody
everywhere? The only reference in point which I can recall
is a passing wonder expressed in a few lines as to what, if
any, effect Armageddon will have in Canada; this is hardly
enough, I fancy, to justify the topical suggestion of the
cover. I cannot help feeling that the object of the last three
words of that title was less literary than commercial.

In the City of Under (ARNoLD) shows Miss EvelyNE
RYND to have quite a pretty talent in the not unattractive
genre of fantastic incoherence something after the pattern
of The Napoleon of Notting Hill, though in a less robustious
mood. But I doubt if talent (however pretty) is altogether
sufficient to carry the reader through three hundred pages
with no possible clue as to what it is really all about. All
the same I do, in justice and most gladly, say that the
author keeps one piqued to the extent of wishing to find

book, and distinctly likes that uncharacteristic Cheltenham
boy, Augustus Clickson, who helps little John Hazard to
find a job. John was very small and ineffectual and en-
gaging, and his W.C., father had left the family wofully
ill off, and John felt it was up to him to do something
about it. He meets the Hawker, who has a comforting
habit of turning up at odd moments and assuring people
that there's a way out of every difficulty, whereas the old
lady, Mrs. Letitlie, asserted roundly and frequently that
there was none. Then we have a nice wild unpractical
Professor and a perplexed archaeologist who get tangled in
the skein; as also a spy, and, in fact, any old person and
thing that occurred to the writer. There's enough good
T stuff and good humour in
this queer patchwork to
make me sure that any de-
fect is one merely of form,
and I would wager that it
was the Notting Hill hero,
before alluded to, that was
responsible for setting our
author on a dangerous path.
The Seventh Post Card

series written anonymously,
as harbingers of sudden
death, to motor-car drivers

management had made

and such as could be expected. Indeed, the sadly-worn
word “delightful” seems somehow applicable to the entire
string of clues, deductions, inquests, murders and other
horrid thrills, or, at any rate, to Mr. FLowerDEw's telling of
them. Is my capability for melodramatic emotion declin-
ing, that I thread this maze of tragic mystery in a mood
no more intense than that of comfortable content? Per-
haps; or it may be only the soothing effect of the author's
clean English, coupled with the conviction that so long as
he takes care to keep Sir Julian Daymont—the famous
novelist-detective—on their side, no serious harm can come
to the people we care about most. So, although a really
nasty charge of murdering his grandfather turns up against
the hero just when things (but for the number of pages
left) are beginning to look prosperous, I can defy you to
get seriously uneasy about his future; and, sure enough,

When my turn came I advanced to
the table of inquisition, came smartly
to attention, saluted, cleared my throat
and said, “Sir!" (The correctness of
this account is not guaranteed by any
bureau.) I then cleared my throat
again and said, “Sir, it was like this.”
The C.O. looked slightly nonplussed;
the Adjutant, who in all his long ex-
perience of crime had never before seen
the accused open his mouth, began to
open his own. So I pushed on with
it. “My defence is this: in the first
place I did not do it. I wasn't there
at the time, and if I had been I
shouldn't have done it. In the second
was still lukewarm.” I then withdrew,
by request. I found upon enquiry of
the Sergeant-Major, who knows all
things, that the party was to travel by
circuitous routes and arrive at 7.5 P.M.,
whereas I, travelling vid London, might
arrive at 5 P.M., and so have two odd
hours to prepare a home and food for
them. So into the train I got, and
there of all people struck the C.O. him-
self, proceeding townwards on duty.
In the course of the journey I made it
clear to him that, if his boots required
licking, I was the man for the job.

a menu in French (our dear allies!),

with Jacques, we told the waiter to
remove the programme and give us the
foodstuffs. “Start at the beginning,”
said the C.O., “and keep on at it till
you reach the end. Then stop.”
“Stop, Sir?” I asked.
“Ay, stop,” said he, “and begin all
over again" . . . and so when we got
to the last liqueur, I held it up and said,
“Sir, if I may, your very good health,”
meaning thereby that I forgave him
not only all the harsh things he has
said to me in the past, but even all the
harsher things he proposes to say to

When I paused for breath they took
the opportunity to inform me, rather
curtly, I felt, that I had been sent for
in order to be appointed to look after
the rations and billets of a party of
sixteen officers proceeding to a distance
that same day, and I was to dispose
accordingly. “If I had known that

said, “you will lunch with me.” I pro-
tested that the honour was enormous,
but I was to arrive in London at 1.30
and must needs proceed at 1.50.
“You will lunch with me,” he pur-
sued, adding significantly as I still
protested, “at the Savoy.”
After further argument, “It is the
soldier's duty to obey,” I said, and we
enquired at St. Pancras as to later
trains. The conclusion of the matter
was that by exerting duress upon my
taxidriver I just caught the 4.17, which
got me to at 7.15, ten minutes

WHAT I DEDUCED.
BY-A GERMAN GoverNEss.
[Extracts from a book which is, no doubt,
having as large a sale in Germany as What
I Found Out, by an English Governess, is
having in this country.]
I shall, never forget my arrival at
the house of my new employers. Into
the circumstances which forced me to
earn my living as a governess in a
strange country I need not now go.
Sufficient that I had obtained a situation
in the house of a Mr. Brigsworth, an
Englishman of high position living in
one of the most fashionable suburbs of
London. “Chez Nous,” The Grove,
Cricklewood, was the address of my
new home, and thither on that memor-
able aſternoon I wended my way.
“The master and mistress are out,”
said the maid. “Perhaps you would
like to go straight to the nursery and
see the children 2 ” -
“Thank you,” I said, and followed
her upstairs. Little did I imagine the
amazing scene which was to follow !
In the nursery my two little charges
were playing with soldiers; a tall and
apparently young man was lying on
the floor beside them. At my entrance
he scrambled to his feet. . -
“Stop the battle a moment,” he said,
“while we interrogate the invader.”
“I am Fräulein Schmidt,” I intro-
duced myself, “the new governess.”
“And I,” he said with a bow, “am
Lord Kitchener. You have arrived
just in time. Another five minutes
and I should have wiped out the Ger-
man army.” -
“Oh shut up, Uncle Horace, you
wouldn't,” shouted one of the boys.
It was Lord Kitchener! He had
shaved off his heavy moustache, and
by so doing had given himself a de-
ceptive appearance of youth, but there
could be no doubt about his identity.
Horatio Herbert Kitchener, the great
English War Lord In the light of
after-events, how instructive was this
first meeting !
“What is the game?” I asked,
hiding my feelings under a smile.
“England against Germany ?”
“England and Scotland and Ireland
and Australia and a few others. We
have ransacked the nursery and raked
them all in.”
So even at this time England had
conceived the perfidious idea of forcing
her colonies to fight for her | -
“And some Indian soldiers ?” I
asked, nodding at half-a-dozen splendid
Bengal Lancers. It struck me even
then as very significant; and it is now
seen to be proof that for years pre-
viously England had been plotting an
invasion of the Fatherland with a
Lord Kitchener evidently saw what
was in my mind, and immediately
exerted all his well-known charm to
efface the impression he had created.
“You mustn't think,” he said with a
smile, “that the policy of the Cabinet
is in any way affected by what goes on
at “Chez Nous.” Although Sir Edward
Grey and I * *
He broke off suddenly, and, in the
light of what has happened since, very
suspiciously.
“Have you had any tea 2" he asked.
His relations with the notorious Grey
were evidently not to be disclosed.
I met Lord Kitchener on one other
occasion, but it is only since England
forced this war upon Europe that I
have seen that second meeting in its
proper light.
I had been out shopping, and when
I came back I found him in the garden
playing with the children. We talked
for a little on unimportant matters, and
then I saw his eye wandering from me
to the drawing-room. A soldier had
just stepped through the open windows
on to the lawn. -
“Hallo,” said Lord Kitchener, “it’s
Johnny.” - -
As the latter came up Lord Kitchener
smacked him warmly on the back.
“Well,” he said, “my martial friend,
how many Germans have you killed?”
Then seeing that his friend appeared a
little awkward he introduced him to
me. “Fräulein Schmidt, this is one
of our most famous warriors—Sir
John French.”
I could see that Sir John French
was taken aback. He had evidently
come down to discuss secretly the plan
of campaign against a defenceless and
utterly surprised Germany, which their
friend and tool, Sir Edward Grey, was
to put in motion—and forthwith a
German governess had been let into the
secret ! No wonder he was annoyed
“You silly ass,” he muttered, and
became very red and confused.
Lord Kitchener, however, only
laughed.
“It's all right,” he said; “Fräulein
Schmidt is Scotch. You can talk quite
freely in front of her.”
It was the typical British attitude
of contempt for the possible enemy.
But General French showed all that
stubborn caution which was afterwards
to mark his handling of the British
mercenaries, and which is about to cost
him so dearly.
“Don’t be a fool, Horace,” he
mumbled, and relapsed into an im-
penetrable silence.
Mr. Brigsworth's mother, who lived

of all the Royal Family" and other
highly placed personages, and told me
many interesting things about them.
“Ah, my dear,” she would say, “they
tell us in the papers that King George
is shooting at Windsor, but—” and
then she would nod her head mysteri-
ously. “He’s a working king,” she
went on aſter a little. “He doesn't
waste his time on sport.” In the light
of after-events it is probable that she
was right; and that when His Majesty
George the Fifth was supposed to
be at Windsor he was in reality in
J3elgium, looking out for sites for the
notorious British siege-guns which
have murdered so many of our brave
soldiers.
In this connection I must relate one
extraordinary incident. Young Mrs.
Brigsworth had an album of celebrated
people in the British political' and
social world. She was herself distantly
connected, she told me, through her
mother's people, with several well-
known Society families, and it interested
her to collect these photographs and
paste them into a book. One day she
was showing me her album, and I
noticed that, on coming to a certain
page, she turned hurriedly over, and
began explaining a group on the next
page very volubly. -
“What was that last one?” I asked.
“Wasn't it Mr. Winston Churchill ?”
“Oh, that was nothing,” she said
quickly. “I didn't know I had that
one; 1 must throw it away.”
However, she had not been quick
enough. I had seen the photograph;
and events which have happened since
have made it one of extraordinary
significance.
It was a photograph of the First
Lord of the Admiralty at Ostend in
bathing costume !
As soon as I was left alone I turned
to the photograph. “The First Lord
amuses himself on his holiday" were
the words beneath it. “Amuses him-
self!” Can there be any doubt in the
mind of an impal tial German that
even then England had decided to
violate the neutrality of Belgium, and
that Mr. Churchill was, when photo-
graphed, examining the possibilities of
Ostend as a base for submarines?
No wonder Mrs. Brigsworth had
hurriedly turned over the page!
E-
“When the war was declared, 25,000
Bedouins were recruited in Hebrun, but they
were without food for three days and returned
to their homes saying this was not a Holy
War.”—Peshawar Daily News.
Their actual words were: “This is

CoMEs there now a mighty rally
From the weald and from the coast,
Down from cliff and up from valley,
Spirits of an ancient host;
Castle grey and village mellow,
Coastguard's track and shepherd's ſold,
Crumbling church and cracked martello
Echo to this chant of old—
Chant of knight and chant of bowman:
Kent and Sussea, feared no foeman
In the valiant days of old !
Screaming gull and lark a-singing,
Bubbling brook and booming sea,
Church and cattle bells a-ringing
Swell the ghostly melody;
“Chalk and flint, Sirs, lie beneath ye,
Mingling with our dust below !
Chalk and flint, Sirs, they bequeath ye
This our chant of long ago!”
Chant of knight and chant of bowman,
Chant of squire and chant of yeoman:
Kent and Sussea, feared no foeman
In the days of long ago /
Hills that heed not Time or weather,
Sussex down and Kentish lane,
Roads that wind through marsh and heather
This kind of face comes, we believe, from the eating of
Chalk and flint their dead are giving—
Spectres grim and spectres bold—
Marching on to cheer the living
With their battle-chant of old—
Chant of knight and chant of bowman,
Chant of squire and chant of yeoman:
Witness Norman / Witness lºoman /
Kent and Sussea, feared no foeman
In the valiant days of old.

man, he had no personal enemies in the
Opposition ranks, whether in Lords or
Commons. Unlike some distinguished
Peers, notably Lord RosBBERY, he en-
joyed advantage, inestimable in public
life, of serving an apprenticeship in the
House of Commons, where he sat six
| years for the Irish constituency which
his famous forebear represented in the
politics. His earliest conviction, thor-
ough as were all he entertained, was
one of distrust for DoN José, who at
the time when he sat in the House of
Commons was carrying through the
country the fiery cross of The Un-
authorised Programme.
This feeling later replaced by dislike
of GLADstoNE, who in the year after
Lord CASTLEREAGH, at the age of thirty-
two, succeeded to the Marquisate,
brought in his Home Rule Bill.
That was the turning point in
LoNDoNDERRY's public life.
he had toyed with politics as part of
the recreation of a wealthy aristocrat.
Thenceforward he devoted himself heart
and soul to withstanding the advance of
Home Rule, which he lived long enough
to see enacted, Death sparing him the
pang of living under its administration.
In his devotion to the fighting line
rallied against Home Rule he was en-
couraged and sustained by a power

pains to point out, was contingent-
upon the very improbable circumstance
of my surviving plague, dysentery,
enteric, smallpox, heat apoplexy, snake-
bite and other perils of a prolonged
sojourn in India.
In the immediate future I can
unfortunately see for myself that my
prospects are of the gloomiest. When
I mildly suggested to my Colour
Sergeant that he should send me my
pay by post each week from the new
station, he stared at me fixedly and
reminded me with unnecessary and
offensive emphasis that I was now
attached to another regiment, and that
he had finally and thankfully washed
his hands of all responsibility con-
cerning me. When I sought out my
new Colour, he informed me even more
emphatically that I was merely attached
to his company for disciplinary pur-
poses and that it was blooming well
useless for me to look to him for pay.

That was one of his best points. He also
told me that I should be married three

had a kind heart; that a short dark

the KAISER would be dethroned next
June; and that fortune-telling was a
precarious means of livelihood and its
professors were largely dependent upon
the generosity of wealthy sahibs such
as myself. Wealthy!
But he was a true prophet in one

shortly be unhappy on account of a

not cheering to reflect now that they are

ONCE upon a time there was an Old
Gentleman who lived in a Very Com-
fortable Way; and some of his Neigh-
bours said he was Rich and others
that, at any rate, he was Well Off,
and others again that at least he had
Considerable Private Means. And when
the Great War broke out it was clear
that he was much too Old to fight, and
he wasn't able to speak at Recruiting
Meetings on account of an Impedi-
ment in his Speech, and he had no
Soldiers billeted upon him, because
there were no Soldiers there, and he
could not take in Belgian Refugees
because he lived on the East Coast—
so he just read the Papers and pottered
about the Garden as he used to do
before.
he began to “draw in,” as his Neigh-
bours said. First he gave up his Motor,
and when his Gardener enlisted he
didn't get Another; and he never
had a Fire in his Bedroom. And his
Neighbours, on thinking it over, con-
cluded that he had been Hard Hit by
the War. But None of them know
how.
Then he began to travel Third Class
and gave up Smoking Cigars. And
they thought he was waiting till the
Stock Exchange opened.
Then they noticed that he got no
new Clothes and his old ones were
not so smart as they used to be. And
as the Stock Exchange was open by
now they began to believe that he
must have become a Miser and was
getting meaner as he got older. And
they all said it was a Pity. But he
went on reading the Papers and potter-
ing round the Garden much as before.

And the Tradespeople found that the

to be, and they began to say that it
was a Pity when people who had
Money didn't know how to spend it.
But the Truth is that they were all
wrong; he was a Collector. That was
how the Money went.
He never told anyone about his
Collection, but he kept it in the Top
Drawer of his Desk till it got too big
and overflowed into the Second Drawer,
and then into the Third, and so on.
He was quite determined that his
Collection should be complete and
should contain Every Sound Specimen
—that was partly why he kept reading
the Papers. But he didn't mind having
Duplicates as long as they had Different
Dates. There was one Specimen of
which he got a Duplicate every Week.
One of his Rules was never to allow
any Specimen into his Collection un-
less it had a Stamp on it.

her, “to make anything of wool that

“Is it?” she asked sweetly.
“If there's no more khaki or brown
wool left in the shops, you should
make something of flannel. Any self-
respecting soldier would rather be
frost-bitten to death a dozen times
than wear a garment of pink wool.”
“Do you think so?” asked Margaret,
smiling.
“Besides, you really ought to stick
to the beaten track—belts, mufflers
and mittens. Nobody wants ear-muffs.”

said, holding it up and surveying it
with satisfaction. -

AN ESSAY IN CRITICISM.
O AUTHORs, remember to join your
flats!
The novel was going splendidly. I
had been revelling in it. I was sitting
in one chair, with my feet in another,
not far from the fire, plunged in the
story, when all of a sudden my pleasure
Went.
It was in Chapter xvii., where the
young doctor takes a taxi and rushes up
to the actress's flat so as to be there first,
before Lord Burlington. You must
understand that the young doctor is
newly in practice and has the greatest
difficulty in making both ends meet.
Well, it says that he sprang from the
cab and was half-way up the stairs in a
moment. That was all right, but the
point is that he stayed two hours
hunting for the missing letter. Now
this is a very exciting passage, because
we know that the detective may be here
any minute, and Lord Burlington is
coming too, and if either of them—well,
the point is that, owing to the author
forgetting to make the young doctor
pay the taxi-man, all my pleasure went.
I am not unduly economical, but I
hate downright waste, and here was the

that chapter and the next, and further
still. Had it been Lord Burlington's
cab I should have cared less, for he was
rich; had it been the detective's I should
not have cared at all, because the driver
might have gone to Scotland Yard for
his money. But the young doctor was
so poor, and sooner or later he would
have to come out of the flat again, and
then he would be caught and faced
with an impossible bill; and this got
on my nerves.
As I say, the story was frightfully
exciting just there, but I found myself,
instead of participating in the excite-
ment, saying, “Another twopence”;
“Twopence more ”; It must be four
shillings by now,” “Five shillings,”
and so on. Not even when the face of

The result was that the effect of the
book was lost on me and I cared
nothing for what happened to any one.
The taximeter ticked through every
subsequent page. Long after we got
away from London altogether and the
young doctor was on his way to Hong
Kong, racing the detective, I still heard
the taximeter ticking; just because the
man had never been paid. It ticked
through the wedding bells; and it
ticked through the strangling of Lord
Burlington in one of the Adelphiarches,
with which the story closes.

AT THE PLAY.
“SEARCHLIGHTS."
THE title was not, of course, meant
to deceive, for Mr. VACHELL is an
honest man; and anyhow the critics,
for that is their business, would be
swift to disillusionize the public; but
in our permissible state of suspicion,
the audience might easily be led to
suppose from the word “Searchlights,”
combined with the early appearance of
an imported Teuton in the person of
Sir Adalbert Schmaltz, that spy-work
was in the air. But the genial
domesticity of this naturalized Scot
quickly disposed of our unworthy ap-
prehensions, and we soon learned that
his provenance had no
bearing upon the issue.
That issue was con-
cerned with a question of
paternity, whose acute-
ness happened to be
contemporaneous with
that of the present Euro-
pean crisis. I say “hap-
pened"; for here again
I cast no reflection upon
Mr. VACHELL's intent, or
suggest that the war-
element in his play was
introduced as an after-
thought into his original
scheme. " If it was,
which I doubt, then the
patchwork was cleverly
concealed; and my only
complaint must be of a
certain obscurity in the
relation between the two
patterns in his design.
For if the title implied
that the effect of the
War was to throw a * -
searchlight into the dark places of the
human heart (as distinguished from its
influence upon our City streets), I do
not think that in the case of Robert
Blaine's heart, if he had one, the author
has made this operation sufficiently
clear. - -
Mrs. Blaine had a grown-up son,
born after five years of barren wedlock,
who was the object of her husband's
profound detestation. After some twenty
years—a little late, perhaps, in the day,
but the author wished us to be present
when he did it—Robert Blaine, at a
moment when his wife is trying to get
her boy out of a tight corner, declares
an inveterate doubt of his fatherhood,
and she makes confession of her fault.
Subsequently—in a “strong" scene—
she recants, alleging that her confession
was a work of creative art, produced in
a spasm of spite; and everybody except
the immovable Blaine is vastly relieved.
HP-15 -Deat,

recants her recantation. You will guess
that, though a little shaken, we were
not in despair, but looked hopefully for
a re-recantation. But you are in error.
Her second confession, though no
words passed her lips, was obviously
final. And what induced it 2 What
was the piece of conviction? If you
will believe me, it was just a photo-
graph with which her husband con-
fronted her—an old photograph of her
lover that she mistook for her son's, so
close was the likeness. This was surely
a flaw in Mr. VACHELL's scheme, for it
is unbelievable that she should have
hitherto overlooked this fatal resem-
blance, even if her attention had not
as a fact been called to it by a garrulous!
%
friend at quite an early stage in the
proceedings of the play.
Another weakness, common enough
where an author wants to show a
variety of types and excuses himself
from the trouble of assorting them, was
to be seen in the extreme improbability
of the friendship between Blaine and
Sir Adalbert Schmaltz. These two were
always staying in one another's houses
yet there never could have been the
smallest of tastes in common between
the dour and moody financier and the
light-hearted consumer of lager beer
and delikatessen.
But I prefer, if you please, to dwell
upon the shining virtues of Mr.
WAcHELL's Searchlights.
exception of an interlude or two of
needless triviality — Lady Schmaltz's
sobbing scene, for instance—the essen-
tials of the tragic theme held us grimly

revealed not only in the passionate
devotion of the mother's heart, but in
the persuasive character of her boy,
and the unaffected quality of his rela-
tions both to her and to the girl who
wanted his love.
Mr. VACHELL would be the first to
acknowledge, and , generously, how
much he owes to the really remarkable
performance, as Mrs. Blaine, of Miss
FAY DAvis, who can never before have
accomplished so high an achievement.
But the matter was there for her clever
hands to shape, and that was the
author's doing.
Mr. HARRY IRVING's, too, was a fine
performance, though, from the moment
of his entrance, a figure of sinister
portent, he lacked all
contrast of light and
shade. But, to be just,
that was hardly in the
part, as made—deliber-
ately, so it seemed—for
those particular methods
of which he is the master.
As for Mr. HolmAN
CLARK, if all Teutons,
naturalized or other,
were like his Sir Adalbert
Schmaltz (or Sir Keith
Howard, as he called
laimself after the War
began, on the principle
that the best was good
enough for him) I should
have small-ground of
quarrel with the race.
But how this joyous Ger-
man ever came to Wear a

I cannot hope to under-
stand, for there was no
hint of Semitic origin in

Mr. REGINALD Owen made a most
human soldier-boy, and 1 shall never

manner or an easier sense of humour.

Blaine is the second stage-hero (the
first was in The Cost) whom the War
has affected in the head. .

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Miss Viola MEYNELL brings to her analysis of character
an astonishingly acute observation and insight, an intimate
sympathy, a quiet, leavening, sometimes faintly malicious,
humour; and to her synthesis a conscientious and dexterous
artistry in selection and arrangement which gives a vividly
objective reality to her creations. So that you may put
down her Columbine (SECKER) with something like the
guilty feeling qf an eavesdropper. Love in its effect upon
three girls is her main theme, and it is difficult to over-
praise her skill and restraint in the handling of it. Lily
Peak, the actress, beautiful, passionless, incompetent, with
her irrelevant banality and her second-hand philosophy
of living, is a veritable tour de force of characterisation
which cleverly avoids the easy pit of caricature. And
between this pretty nonentity and Jennifer, the competent,
the loyal and the deep, with her occasional flashes of
beauty and her innocent provocativeness, Diron Parrish,
one of those self-analytic, essentially cool-blooded modern
young men, wavers to the tragic hurt of all the three.
Alison, his sister, full of moodiness and passionate pre-
occupations, moves unquiet on the well-planned back-
ground which holds that genially absurd pseudo-intellectual,
her father; the kindly negative Mrs. Parrish; Gilbert,
Alison's lover (the least satisfactory of the portraits); the
pleasantly pretentious Madame Barrett of the elocution
classes; and “that Mrs. Smith,” who is only (but adroitly)
shown through Lily's artless chatter. Miss MEYNELL
chooses to write chiefly of little moments in little lives.
as passages of warm colour placed with a fine judg-
ment on her low-toned canvas abundantly prove, and
meanwhile she has shown herself mistress of a method
singularly skilful and restrained. She does not describe
or explain or soliloquise. All her points are made through
the speech, the actions or the expressed thought of her
characters—the manifestly excellent way which so few
have the wit or the courage to follow.
Mr. Leo Brandish, so Miss PEGGY WEBLING assures me,
intends to write the professional biography of their mutual
hero, that notable actor and admirable gentleman, Edgar
Chirrup (METHUEN). In the meantime she has told us all
about the man himself, at least as far as the last page that
he has turned, the one where the dogs and the rocking-horse
are included in the family portrait, with his children and
the wife whom you and I, and everyone else for that
matter, realised was the one for him long before he did.
Some of the other pages in his life were less satisfactory,
more particularly those on which Fate had inscribed, not in
the most convincing fashion (but perhaps the authoress
jogged Fate's elbow), the history of his sudden unworthy
infatuation. If I could not forget or ever quite understand
this episode, neither could “Chirps" himself in the years
that followed, when the lovableness and loyalty that had
already won my affections were pleading for his release,
with the ladies (Fate and Miss WEBLING, I mean) collab-
orating over his destiny. It would indeed be pitiful if any
but the happiest of endings had been in store for the hero.

Dapplemere there lived a small boy, who talked as boys do
in books but nowhere else; a lavendery old lady-house-

Priscilla; and a maiden as fair as she was impoverished.
You recall too how all these charming people took George

your bearings again, there is much to admire in the treat-

delicate beauty of paintings upon ivory. The clear, clean
air, the colour of sunrise flushing some exquisite landscape,
a flight of birds crossing a garden of azaleas—all these are
realized with obvious knowledge and enthusiasm, and more
than compensate for the intricacy of the plot. But this is
certainly there. Once only was I myself near vanquished.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XV. -
(From SAMUEL Ponten, generally known as SHINING SAMMY,
aboard H.M.S. in the North Sea.)
YoUR High MiGHTINEss, They tell me, and by what I
can read about it it's right, that you're very angry with us
sailormen. Well, you can go on being angry for all we
care. Your being annoyed don't do us any manner of
injury, although I daresay it frightens some of the chaps
that hang round you and go on licking your boots till your
head swells. But we're not built that way. We’ve got
our duty to do and we're going to do it, even if we do
manage to hurt your Imperial German feelings—yours and
old Turps's and all your other Admirals' into the bargain.
If we hear of you setting to work to smash all your own
crockery and kick the stuffing out of the Sunday chairs in
through the window-panes, d'you think that's going to
make any difference to us?
I had an uncle once, my mother's half-brother, but much
older than her, their father having married a second time
when he was well on in years. He was just one of your
sort was my uncle, a big man and proud, and couldn't bear
to be contradicted by his family. Consequence was his
wiſe and all my cousins used to t, emble before him, and it
was “Get your father's boots and be quick about it,” or
“Sally, you're sitting in your father's favourite chair; get
a move on you, do; ” and all that kind of thing, till he got
to think he couldn't do wrong. Well, one night he come
home in a temper through slipping up on a piece of banana
skin and the pavement being a bit too hard for him. First
thing he did when he got home, after kicking the door in,
was to fall out with my aunt about there being no sausages
for supper, and then they had it up and down through the
whole house with him carrying on like a madman, until at
last the policeman come in very quiet and sudden through
the open door and asked to know what all the noise and
scatteration meant. You never saw a man change so quick
as that half-uncle of mine. All the wind went out of him
pop, and he turned as quiet as a lamb, and said there'd been
a slight misunderstanding; and ever aſterwards, when he
began to look ugly, my aunt could tone him down by
whispering the word “misunderstanding.” -
It strikes me you're just such another as uncle, and
you'll have to knuckle down same as he did. You're not
going to take command of the sea by shouting out loud
that you've got it. We're there to see to that, and don't
you forget it. All this talk of yours about sinking innocent
merchant ships and sending their crews to Kingdom Come
is what a real sailorman can't swallow. It only shows
what you and Admiral Turps and the rest of you are made
of. Mind, I don't say you're not capable of it if you think
you won't get your own skins hurt. You've shown your-
selves great chaps for the sneaking game, but you can't
keep the old rule of the sea, which orders a man to save
life as well as destroy it. You're a great hand at blowing
poor women and children to bits at fortified towns like Scar-
borough and Whitby, but when your Admiral got his chance
of picking a few fellows out of the sea at Coronel, what did
he do? Sailed away and left them to drown, and then
said the sea was too rough. No real sailor could have
said that, or even thought it, for a sailor thinks of the
waves as his brothers and the winds as his sisters, and
when the big guns have done speaking he's out to rescue
them as can't help themselves no more. When our men,
picked up yours they didn't stop to think about it or reason
it out to themselves. They did it prompt because it was
the old rule and they had to keep it or look on themselves
as curs. I'm sorry to have to say all this because I'm
not one for boasting; but the long and the short of it is
that you don't understand the sea and your men don't
understand the ways of sailors. And that's why I think
you're not going to out us just yet. I don't respect you,
not a bit, and when you're angry and go racketing about
the world, you mustn't take it unkind of me if you hear
me laugh. There, I feel better now.
Yours, SHINING SAMMY.
The War in the Air. -
In view of the alarming rumours as to the German
preparations for invading us it is really comforting to learn,

THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND HIM.
MY brother's wife and her husband
had decided before the event that, if it
was a boy, Smith and I were to be its
godfathers; if it was a girl, I was to
drop out. Smith, I should mention,
was our rich friend, with the fur over-
coat and no ties (family ties, that is),
a man who could be safely depended
on for a really solid silver mug. As
maters fell out, it proved to be a girl.
This, from my point of view, was just
as well, since in any case I could not
have risen above electro-plate, and
quite possibly invidious com-
parisons between Smith and
myself might have suggested
themselves to the mind of my
nephew. I am a sensitive
man, one who does not care
to be sniffed at, even by a
On a certain afternoon,
when my niece was a little
more than a month old, I
dropped in on the family. I

on her lap.
“You are not looking well,
Horace,” she said.
I laughed a little thinly.
“A slight cold,” I replied.
As a matter of fact it was
not a cold; it was the result
of mental anxiety. I had
seen the baby several times
since its arrival, and the more
I had studied it the more per-
sistently had there grown in
my mind a doubt as to how
Smith, a man of acsthetic tem-
perament, would be affected
by it. If he jibbed, I knew I
was pretty certain to be roped
in to fill the gap.
“Baby is to be christened
on Saturday,” announced my
brother's wife.
So it was all right after all. '
A wave of relief swept over me. I was
so excited that I came close to my
niece and smiled upon her. Her mother
hastily lowered the child's flannel
visor.
“Don’t, Horace,” she said.
“I suppose Smith was quite pleased
to officiate 2 " I remarked.
“We haven't asked him yet,” she
answered; “but of course he will be
delighted.”
I sat down weakly. Saturday seemed
very near.
“Has he seen her ?" I asked in a
low voice.
Something in my tone must have
aroused her suspicions. “You don't

think she is perfectly beautiful? Look
at her legs.”
“The legs,” I agreed, “are extremely
chic, but the face " I hesitated.
“Yes?" she said coldly.
“It has improved wonderfully, won-
derfully; but don't you think it is still
a little—er—lacking in finish, so to
speak?"
“Several people have said,” she ob-
served icily, “that baby is very like
you.”
“Not in my hearing,” I protested.
“Besides, people always say kind
things about babies." -

“Except their uncles,” she retorted.
“Believe me,” I said earnestly, “I
love this child. In all probability she
will blossom into the apple of my eye.
On the other hand, I happen to know
that Smith, who has always led a
strictly shielded life, has never yet
been introduced to so young a baby;
and speaking for the moment not as
an uncle, but merely as a man, I am
inclined to think that just at present
she would, to put it plainly, frighten
him. Now consider. You wish Smith

the better every day, and I am confi-
dent that in a little while her counten-
ance will have developed most of the
customary details.”
My brother's wife rose with her
infant and walked across the room.
“I think you are perfectly inhuman,”
she said. “I am writing to Mr. Smith
myself to-night, and I shall ask him to
call and see baby at once.” She went
out, banging the door, by a clever
sleight of foot, behind her.
On the next day but one I received
a note from my brother asking me to
I come round at once. With a
heavy heart I complied with
his request. He took me into
| his study and shut the door.
“I'm afraid Smith is a non-
starter,” he said. “Yesterday
morning, when I mentioned
the matter to him, he seemed
quite enthusiastic. In the
aſternoon he called to see the
child. Unfortunately we were
both out, and baby was in
charge of her nurse. I cannot
gather from the woman exactly
what occurred at the inter-
view; she is most evasive
about it. But it appears that
Smith was very much upset
by something or other, and
that he only stayed a minute
or two. The housemaid, who
let him out, declares that he
was trembling violently. This
morning I got a wire from
him."
Ho handed me a telegram :
“Very sorry cannot ſulfil en-

“I can hardly believe it,”
my brother went on ; “it’s
one of the most dangerous
branches of the service, and
- Smith never struck me as
being a man of much physical courage.”
“He is not,” I replied, “but in this
case he evidently fears the Front less
than the font."
My brother looked at me thought-
fully. “I suppose we can rely on you
for Saturday, Horace?”
“Yes,” I answered sadly.
On my way home I went into
the jeweller's and chose a very large
and handsome silver mug, which I
directed to be despatched to my
godchild.
“Will you pay for it now, Sir?" the
jeweller asked. -

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI.
ANOTHER DOG OF WAR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-When my master
got the mail a month old, he opened
Punch first (as he always does), and
when he saw the letter from the
“Very Sad Dog,” he sat me on the
ward-room table and read it out to
me. I wept till the tears rolled down
my face, because of course every dog
should be with his master at the Front.
I am a very proud dog, and my Aire-
dale father and Irish Terrier mother
would yelp for joy if they knew, because
of course I insisted on going to the
Front with Master. When we mobilised,
Master took me off on a ridey-walk to
the stables, and he stayed a long time
stroking his polo ponies, until I heard
him say, “Good-bye, my darlings.”
Then I began to suspect something.
Concealing the jealous pangs I always
feel when he is near these beasts, I hur-
ried back to the depôt-ship and found his
servant packing ! I have been had that
way once before. Never again. That
evening I went on board our (master
calls it his) torpedo boat destroyer and
got into a locker in the ward-room
pantry. The locker is two feet square
and I weigh fºrty-five pounds, but I
managed it. A ham was in the next
locker, and I never budged an inch,
although I have a passion for ham. At
midnight I heard Master come on
board, reading out from a signal pad
about hostilities and shouting Hoorah
He hailed the quartermaster and said
something about having lost his d d
dog (that's me) and wanting the mess to
look after me. I quivered with anxiety.
Presently we cast off, and when I
knew by the fact of the ham bumping
against my partition that we were
going at full speed I climbed on deck.
I always rather funk the ordeal of
meeting Master on these occasions, but
the result is always the same: I stay.
I did the usual performance of wagging
my tail, then squirming on the deck
and trying to look as if I'd got there
by accident, etc., until I was forgiven,
after having been called a stowaway
and a possible German spy. Master's
naval vocabulary is so extensive that
if I were to repeat what he said when
we met it would resemble one of those
despatches that the Censor has to
handle.
Living in a T.B.D. I don't get much
exercise except when Master takes me
over to see his friends in the other
boats. A cat lives in one and a rabbit
in the other. I come back feeling
pleasantly tired.

neglect nowadays. In the old days

am sick of being at sea all day (and,
between ourselves, have been several
times) and am anxiously waiting for
another splendid hunt like the one we
had off Heligoland or some such place,

Master's servant a good week's combing

I am very useful on board. To men-

we were rolling about 50° each way and
actually succeeded in catching it before
it fell on to the deck, and saved it from
being rendered uneatable by the salt
water on the deck. Master came down

he saw that the empty plates (which
aren't eatable) had also fallen off the

looked at me and said, “You old
ruflian, I know where you've been
hunting, but it's weak to think of such
things nowadays; ” so I try not to
dream any more.
When I am on watch with Master
I wear a thing called a “Balaclava
helmet.” She sent it to Master, who
spent half-an-hour trying to find out
where and how to put it on. Then he
offered it to the coxswain, who said he
“didn't 'old with them new-fangled
ideas.” The crew looked at it and
said the weather was - too cold for
bathing yet, and so Master decided it
was just the thing for me. Where and
how I wear it I cannot describe in case
she sees my letter, but it keeps me nice
and warm.

OVERGROWDING IN THE PARKs.
WE are faced with the overcrowding
problem again—this time in the Parks.
Last Sunday we were manoeuvring
against a convoy represented by our
Motor Section. I was in the General
Reserve—I always am. The principal
business of the General Reserve is to
catch cold. On this cecasion the
General Reserve consisted of two
platoons, inclusive of Bailey and myself.
The trouble started with Dawkins.
Dawkins was sent scouting. He had
only just entered a convenient coppice,
sat down and lit his pipe, when he was
violently prodded in the back. It was
then intimated to him that he was a
prisoner. Dawkins, who has a good
general knowledge of life, naturally
demanded the nature of the charge and
production of the warrant. Not receiv-
ing anything like the proper stereotyped
reply, Dawkins correctly diagnosed that
his captor was not a constable, common
or special, and prepared to debate the
matter. The allegation against Dawkins
was that he was loitering within the
lines of the Bermondsey Billposters in
possession of arms and no satisfactory
password. Dawkins asserts that he
used every endeavour to preserve peace.
He pointed out that the Billposters'
pitch possessed no visible lines of
demarcation ; that the Park was not
“arms” was an exaggerated term to
apply to his ancient but trusty musket.
He even tried several guesses at the
password, but, after drawing a blank
with the word “paste,” gave it up.
In the course of the ensuing argu-
ment they reached the edge of the
coppice and our Company Commander
mistook Dawkins' gesticulations with
his rifle for the signal “Enemy in sight
in large numbers.” He at once dis-
patched No. 1 Platoon to hold the
coppice.
The next incident was the discovery
of a signaller on the rising ground east
by north-east. Hammersley, our Sema-
phore expert, without hesitation de-
clared that the message was being sent
in Morse, while Holloway, our Morse
expert, was equally emphatic that it
was Semaphore. On my suggestion
that it might be a code message, Jenkins,
who once won an acrostic competition,
was co-opted on to the committee. To
everyone's astonishment the committee
came to a decision. They announced
that it was a code message sent partly
in Morse and partly in Semaphore and
that the true interpretation of it was
that we were to make a flank attack
on the right. It subsequently tran-
spired that the signaller was an un-
attached individual practising what he
believed to be Semaphore for his own
edification.
Meanwhile our Commander marched
off No. 2 Platoon with the exception of
Bailey and myself. We were left to
hold the position and “keep in touch.”
Having no precise instructions as to
what we were to keep in touch with,
we decided to start on Bailey's sand-
wiches. I was lodging a complaint at
the parcity of mustard when an excited
officer of cyclists appeared. He wanted
the General Reserve, and we offered
our services. He seemed dissatisfied
with us, more, I presume, on the ground
of quantity than quality. We assured
him that there had been more of us, but
that the others had gone off on some
errand the nature of which we had for-
gotten, though Bailey thought that it
had to do with mushrooms. When he
wanted to know which of us was in
command we were not in accord on the
subject and offered to submit the matter
to him for arbitration. Having ascer-
tained that there was nothing between
us in the matter of seniority, as we had
both joined on the same day and both
our subscriptions were in arrear ab
initio, he curtly ordered us to reinforce
the firing line and departed.
I won the toss and took command.
After showing Bailey the proper way to
salute his Superior Officer I put him
through such parts of the manual and
and ordered him to form fours. As :
Bailey isn't very well up in his drill
and seemed at a loss how to carry
out this somewhat intricate movement,
I waived the point and decided to
advance in file.
If we had thought of enquiring as to |
the position of the firing line the rein- |
forcing business would have presented
less difficulty. We started out in what
I thought was a likely direction and
were lucky to catch sight of them quite
early on. I at once extended Bailey
ten paces and directed him to advance
by rushes. For some reason Bailey
seemed to object to lying down in
puddies and I had to threaten to report |
him for insubordination. I didn't in-
tentionally choose swampy patches |
when I gave him the signal to lie
down, but it is obvious that low-lying
places afford the best cover. Bailey
didn't understand that as an officer I
didn't have to lie down, though every-
body but Bailey knows that it is an
officer's duty to expose himself as much
as possible. This prevents panic among
the men and encourages the junior
officers by affording them an early
prospect of promotion.
When we reached the firing line we
found that they were doing practically
nothing. As this appeared to be due to
the inefficiency of their officers I at
once gave the command for “five rounds
rapid” and then “charge.” Though I
led it, I feel justified in saying that it
was a good charge. If I had had time
to ascertain that we had inadvertently
reinforced the Tooting Borough Council,
who were lying in ambush for the Lime-
house Borough Council, I should prob-
ably have hesitated before taking over
command. Our charge seems to have
been premature, and the Limehouseites
claimed to have gained some kind of ,
advantage. . .
There didn't seem much use instaying
to discuss the matter with a number of
comparative strangers, so we did a
route march to the nearest buses and so
home. I gather that our Commandant
was disappointed at not being reinforced
and was inclined to be harsh with all
with whom he came in contact. There
was no real occasion for him to have
been put out, as the convoy never got ||
through. Their motor cyclist was run
in for exceeding the speed limit; the
cycle-car broke down before reach-
ing the Park, and the Ford was
ambushed by the Wapping Pawn-
brokers, who had made that road im-
practicable by placing a few logs just
round the bend.
I think that there is no doubt that
the Park was overcrowded that day
and that the authorities ought to do
vested in the Billposters, and that
something about it.

The man in the corner had been

was older than any of the others. Now

The train stopped. Nobody moved
to put Charlie out, and nothing was
said. Then the train went on ; and
presently the elderly man spoke again:
“Eightpence! And what price my

STUDY of A PRUSSIAN Hous EHold HAVING ITs MoRNING HATE.
THE RIGOURS OF WAR-TIME.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I should like
your advice with regard to a most
difficult situation which has arisen in
my family. : -
I am the mother of two boys. Philip,
the elder, has enlisted in a most correct
Territorial Battalion—there is a son of
à Knight in his platoon. My other son,
Clarence, applied for a commission,
and obtained one in the 27th Battalion
of the Regiment. True, the mess
is exclusively composed of Colonels and
Second Lieutenants, but, as Clarence
points out, this is an advantage, for
when he is promoted he assures me
that he will automatically become
Lieutenant-Colonel, as there are no
officers between him and this rank.
That, however, is not the point on
which I wish to be advised. My troubles
began over a week ago, when I was
walking on the promenade at Brighton
with Clarence. We were chatting
gaily about the war when suddenly
I saw Philip coming towards us. I
went forward eagerly to embrace him,
but when he saw Clarence he seemed
to freeze and, assuming a very ºrigid
attitude, saluted. Clarence returned
considering that Philip is nearly two
years older and much taller.
Well, will you believe it, Mr. Punch?
they refused to walk together with me.
Clarence maintained that it was not
discipline, and Philip said that if he
accompanied an officer he would be
obliged to walk at attention, with a
constant “eyes right,” which might
permanently affect his sight.
So there was nothing for it but to
separate. -
I have just this morning heard, in-
dependently from each of them, that
they have obtained leave for next week-
end and propose to spend it with me.
What am I to do? If I put one of
them off, that one will be deeply
offended. If they both come I foresee
endless complications. Normally, for
our house is small, they share one
bedroom. That, of course, is now
impossible, as even in pyjamas I under-
stand the King's Regulations are bind-
ing, and for Philip to sleep at attention
might have serious results.
Again, what about meals? They
cannot eat together at table, yet I
should hesitate to ask Philip to take
his meals in the kitchen; still worse
I could not bear to see him standing
by Clarence's presence from taking part
in the conversation.
Do please get me out of this difficulty.
Yours, etc., -
BRITISH MATRoN.
P.S. Possibly Philip's Colonel would
grant him commissioned rank just for
the week-end if he knew how matters
stood.
Always Merry and Bright.

read a paper conveying not a single

Good Sirs, in your merciless dealings
With the dock that you doom to be
burned,

1ngs
Of the people most closely concerned?
Will the burglar feel angry or gracious
When, his liberty like to be lopped,
He finds himself first in your spacious
New coop for the copped 2
Whatever his thoughts at that season,
This much I would dare to advance,
He would now have you show (within
reason)
A proper respect for romance;
Is it seemly a structure so rich in
Connections with Sikes and his mates
Should perish in parlour and kitchen,
Mere fodder for grates?
If the dock's for the burning, so be it;
But sentiment wakes the desire
In my bosom (and Sikes's) to see it
Allot it an eminent station,
Since its life is commanded to cease,
As a part of some vast conflagration
To celebrate peace.

a brilliant forecast as to what was
really going to happen to HINDENBURG.
“How 7" said the Reverend Henry.
“I was pretty fit before.”
“I mean morally. These occasional
week-ends of ours have been much
more harmonious than they were six
months ago. You used to be such a
quarrelsome brute.” -
“It's quite true," said Sinclair.
“You used to fuss horribly about the
Welsh Church and payment of Members,

“I'm sorry,” said the Reverend
Henry, very humbly. “But you fellows
used to have such extreme views. And
at least I was always out for a big

“As for the House of Commons,”
said Sinclair, “the atmosphere of gentle-
assembly in these days is most refresh-
ing. For success in debate you only
seem to require a repertoire of three
remarks—"After you, Sir,’ ‘My mistake'
and ‘Don’t mention it.'”
“The really ghastly thing,” said the
Reverend Henry, “is that as soon as
the War is over they will be at it
again. This is all very jolly while it

“Yes, that 's it,” said I. “The

I remember—it is all so long ago—
they left off at the stage where they
were chucking things at one another.”
“You don't mean that it will really
break out again?” said Sinclair in a
voice of horror. “Just as it was

“Just like that,” said Henry.

THE LONELY SOLDIER.
DARLING DELIA,-I am in the most
lacerating fir, and it all comes of my
tender heart |
It gets an one's nerves saying good-
bye to the boys, and sitting at home
doing nothing oneself. For weeks I've
been longing for something to do, and
at last Lady Anne asked me to join
the “Lonely Soldiers' Consolation
League,” and of course I jumped. The
Lonely Soldiers send in their names,
and they are put in a hat and handed
round, and each member writes to her
special Lonely once a week, and sends
him a parcel once a month.
I haven't come to the parcel stage,
but I sent a gushing letter. It was
just after the last attack, when they'd
been for days in the trenches, and their
poor dear boots had stuck fast in the
mud, and one was strung up to feeling
that we'd love them, bless them, kiss
them, when they came home again
I said so to Ted Johnson (that's my
Lonely), quoting the refrain of the song
in the actual words; I said he must
never feel lonely or forgotten, for I
remembered him, I thought of him, I
looked forward to his return
What else could one say? You write
to them because they are lonely, and if
they are lonely you can only cheer
them by saying that you remember 1
I spread myself upon Ted Johnson.
And in due time his answer came.
Prestwick brought it in with the tea-
things (we have had no footman since
the last Jeames enlisted), and I tore it
open, and read it aloud to Ella, too
eager to wait even until we were alone.
Besides I was rather proud that Prest-
wick should see that I've been working
too.
This was the letter:-
“DEAR Miss, I was glad to hear
you missed me and was looking forward
to my return. It's a long way to Eaton
Gardens and the sweetest girl I know.
We are having a deal of rain. With
fond love from Yours truly,
Private TED Johnsos.”
“How perfectly dinkie ' " Ella said.
“Isn't he sweet 2 Isn't he brave 2 Isn't
he cheerful ? Wouldn't you love to see
Then Prestwick spoke. He was
standing with the tea-tray in his hand,
staring across the room.
“Pardon me, Madam,” he said, “you
have seen him | Ted Johnson was our

Your distracted FLORA.
THE HYMN OF EIGHT.
EIGHT o'clock is the hour I hate,
For it knocks all fun on the head.
It's no use telling them, not a bit,
That you don't feel tired, for they laugh
at it;
And Nurse comes in, looking just like
Fate —
“Tut! tut!” she says, “but it's ter.
ribly late;
It's time you were all in bed.”
Eight o'clock how the hands draw
near !
Nothing will make them slow.
Although in the midst of a beautiful
game
We have to stop (what a horrible
shame!)

severe, -
And her talk of “The Dustman’

And into the cold we go.

And not go to bed till two.

“none for me. I am having to be very

I looked at him in astonishment.
I had known him for nearly two-and-
twenty years and never in that time |
had he set up an attitude of hostility
to any of the good things of the earth,
solid or fluid. Not that I had ever
known him to overstep the bounds;
but he had tasted and enjoyed, and
flourished on his catholicity. And now

ginger ale, which was the joyless alter-
native that he subsequently proposed.
I looked at him in pity too, for I
knew that he must be ill indeed for
such a sacrifice to have been forced
upon him.
“Yes,” he said, “I am dieting myself.
I find it necessary.” He sighed as
one sighs who accepts the distasteful
inevitable.
“Well,” I said, “I won't tempt you.
That's not fair.”
He looked at me almost as though
he wished that I would, and that he
might prove vulnerable; but I did not.
I felt too sorry for him and his plight ||
to put any obstacle in the way of |
recovery.
“Very well,” I said and ordered the
ginger ale, and we then settled down to ||
talk. But all the while I was watching ||
him sympathetically and remembering
pleasant occasions on which I had been
his guest in his own house and he had
dived into the cellar and complacently
emerged in the blessed company of

FROM THE BACK OF THE FRONT.
SoME people say that the authorities
have at last come to understand our
true merits; some people say that they
have come to despair of us as private
soldiers. Some even identify the two
allegations. Howbeit, from whatsoever
cause, certain of us are in imminent
danger of losing our private status.
We are assembled together by com-
panies and instructed in the arts of
inspecting water - bottles, telling the
time on starless nights by radium-
pointed watches, and in all practical
and tactical usages that fall to the lot
of a platoon-commander. In due course
we shall pass out and take the war into
our own hands ; pending which we
meditate on our future responsibilities.

comprehensive; nor are we vowed only
to destruction. We think nothing, for
instance, of building a bridge between
breakfast and lunch, though of course
we'd think a whole heap before tread-
ing on it. We are here to risk our
lives, but not to throw them upon
the waters.
No secret of military art is hidden
from us; not one of us but can
conduct a grand attack on his little
own, and that without losing as much
as a platoon. Watch General Private
Williamson exercising his brief author-
ity over his skeleton battalion. We
arrive at the kick-off site. The General
|halls us, breaks us off, and begins his
preliminary reconnaissance. In the far
distance loom the twin flags repre-
senting enemy's position—an indica-
tion, we regret to report, frequently
neglected by the Bosches. A lesser man
than Private Williamson might imme-
|diately plump forward line upon line
of extended platoons. Pas si vite.
What is the first question our General
asks himself—or anyone else present 2
nearest estaminet. Seated over his
coffee he conducts, with the assistance
of his staff (the attacking force), the
preliminary reconnaissance. First of
all we touch lightly on the proximity
of the enemy. The General puts it at
2,000 yards; the chief of staff at 800.
That makes it, by a simple mathe-
matical compromise, 1,400; which gives
you your range chart, without which
no attack is quite itself.
But the work of the General does not
end here. The land must be spied out;
the country which we are—for some
obscure reason—fighting for is one-half
lake and one-half swamp. Accordingly,
as the attack has to have clean boots
on parade next day, scouts go forward
to select the most land-like portions of
the morass. Then at last we advance, |
and with only an occasional halt for
coffee—this depending on the number
of farms en route—we sweep on to the
rallying position, where we sit down
nonchalantly in a hail of bullets and
discuss a haversack ration while a real
officer tells us how. His telling is

arms of our service battalion are an
estaminct couchant in a field sodden.
Anon we study billeting. There is in
|the North of France a crazy old farm-
house full of tumultuous children and
their mother. It has, I believe, been
condemned as a billet by all the sanitary
authorities in France. The accommo-
idation is an antique barn with a leaky
'roof above, a cesspool underneath, and
‘the four winds of heaven raging between.
We visit by parties. The party arrives
at the farmhouse and knocks timidly.

cookery-pervaded interior.
“What is it that it is ?”

soldiers? ... "
“But yes," says Madame (contrary
to the custom, but she knows well how
safe she is). “See you ! It is by here!"
We go by there and see, while
Madame tells us of her sons at the
war — only five, fortunately — their
inames, ranks, localities, ages, and
# prospects. We appreciate; we admire;

would hold any (without chains we fear
it wouldn't). Then we relieve the lady

THE WAR CURE.
When, summoned by untimely Fate,
Ralph Snow died suddenly at Luxor,
Leaving his Warwickshire estate,
His house and placens uror;
His son, though handsomely endowed—
Chiefly through ground rents in the
City-–
And envied by the heedless crowd,
Moved all his friends to pity.
Young Ralph had brains as well as
wealth ;
He was unusually gifted;
But on the score of fragile health
From school to school was shifted;
And having taken his degree,
And then become a vegetarian,
He was, for all the world to see,
A valetudinarian.
Racked by imaginary pain
Ralph threw away his social chances,
And stayed at home to study QUAIN,
Instead of going out to dances,
Until, so parlous grew his plight,
He saw in healthy yawns and sneezes
Proof positive of several quite
Incurable diseases. -
His heart's peculiar action moved
The doctor's keen commiseiation;
His brain—or so that worthy proved—
“Worked like a railway station;"
I cannot properly recall " .. " -
The strange shortcomings of his liver,
Whether it was too large or small— `
I know it made me shiver.
The doctor took a solemn oath
No board would certify his fitness;
His mother was extremely loth
- To doubt such welcome witness;
But Ralph, already in whose ears
II is country's clarion call was pealing,
Forgot his symptoms and his fears,
For War had brought him healing.
In boyhood, ere he came to yield
To pathologic introspection,
His tastes and interests revealed
A martial predilection;
And when his fellows, to a man,
Whate'er their class or creed or
faction, --
Had volunteered, he cursed the ban
That doomed him to inaction.
Some said, “At least the boy is safe;"
But that, I thought, was comfort
chilly, . .
When lo! I met a radiant Ralph
Last week in Piccadilly; -
So gay his look, so light his tread,
He almost baffled recognition;
“What cheer?” I asked. “The best,”
he said;
“I'm promised a commission!
“Our doctor was a ghastly fraud;
Three specialists have overhauled me,
And say that I can serve abroad—
-
The mater's wonderfully brave,
And, now that I can stand the racket,
She'd sooner see me in my grave
Than stay at home and slack it."
The object of these humble rhymes
Is not to slight a great profession;
The best of doctors err at times
From overmuch discretion;
I only wished to make it plain
That war's inhuman brutal medley
May work a cure and ease a pain
When peace has made it deadly.

heart and saluting it with reverent homage. One is im-
pressed almost overwhelmingly, but one is also inspired
and invigorated, and this is the reason—quite apart from
the valuable scientific discoveries made on these expeditions
—why we owe a greater debt to such pioneers than we
can ever repay. Men of the type of Scott, WILson,
OATEs, Bowers and MAwson have kept the pure flame
of heroism still burning, and not even beside the great
deeds of our soldiers and sailors can the splendour of
their record be paled. T - - - - - -

MR. PUNCH*S SUPPLEMENT.
In the issue of this week Mr. Punch has the honour
to offer to his readers a selection of his pictures illus-
trating the history of our Voluntary Army from its mid-
Victorian origin to the present day. The harmless and
friendly chaff in which he has permitted himself to
indulge when recording the trials which this Army has
so gallantly faced and overcome will not be misunder-
stood. The fine example which our Territorials have set,
both at home and abroad, to the slacker and the shirker
has been duly recorded in Mr. Punch's pages. For the
rest—the lighter side of a serious loyalty—he has not
much fear for a country which almost alone among
nations can afford to laugh at its own foibles. And as
the soldiers of our Voluntary Forces pass out to the
Front it is in a spirit of high confidence and pride that
he wishes them Godspeed and a great reward of their
sacrifice ; not forgetting those who, being past the age for
foreign service, have volunteered to bear arms for the
defence of our shores.

“WHAT does this mean?” I asked, hastily withdrawing
my spoon from the egg on my plate.
“It means,” said Hilda, “that ours won't lay, and I
had to go to the grocer's. I asked Mr. Thompson if it
was new-laid, and he answered me that it was fresh in
yesterday.” -
“What,” said I, “does Mr. Thompson's electric bell
do when you place your foot on the board immediately
“It rings.”
“Quite so, and that is what Mr. Thompson does. His
'fresh in yesterday' is a purely automatic response to a
certain stimulus. He has, in fact, never owned, nor is
it possible for him to own, an egg that was not fresh in
yesterday.”
“I shall speak to him severely,” said my wife.
“My dear,” I answered, “ years and years and years
ago, before we were married, before this house was built,
before you were promoted to pinafores and when Mr.
CHURCHILL and I were running about in sailor suits, people
were speaking severely to Mr. Thompson; and they have
been doing it ever since. No, there is only one way of
getting the really reliable article. Our hens must lay. If
they won't, we must make them. I will interview Christine.”
Christine is our oldest hen. We have always looked to
her to set the tone of our establishment, and her influence
has on the whole been good.
“Somehow Christine seems to have changed lately,”
said my wife. “She has never been quite the same since

THIS WAR HAS COME ON US FOR OUR VANITY. BABYLON FELL FOR ITS WANITY.

AT THE BACK OF THE FRONT.
WHEN you are in the throes of War
the great thing is to eat like a horse.
Organisation is the keynote of efficient
eating; hence our Mess. We are seven,
and take turns at the duties of Mess
orderly. When we get into a town,
even horses aren't in it with us—for
one thing they don't billet horses in
towns much. But we have our ſailures.
Witness our stay at Grande Choupe.
(Note to Censor.—This name does not
exist).
Grande Choupe is a town of no mean
aspirations. It can sell you wine and
vinegar under the same name. We
went there for a seven days' rest, and
the cooks promised roast meat nightly.
Wilmot was Mess orderly the first
day; he got wine and prunes and hot
fried potatoes and other exotics. The
meat was a dream, but we had no salt.
We almost expelled Wilmot from the
Mess to get it; but War has softened us,
and we ſorbore.
Robbins was on next day; he bettered
Wilmot by finding a pot of Blunker's
Manchester Marmalade in an obscure
épicerie—an achievement which so
impressed us that we all but forgave
him for forgetting the salt; but some
produced neither salt nor marmalade on
the third day.
On the fourth Whipple alleged that
he had bought salt and left it in the
shop; he put on a great many airs
about it and seemed to expect a D.S.O.
His behaviour encouraged Decker to
make the same omission on the next
night.
Then came my turn. I made a knot
in my equipment the night before, and
thought on the morrow of nothing but
salt until I met Warne of the North-
East Yorkshires. What with having
to salute Warne, and fixing up to ſeed
with his Mess, and swopping lies with
him, I somehow—well, anyhow, I was
quite glad afterwards I hadn't to dine
chcz mous.
Then came the seventh and last day,
with Dixon on duty. Dixon is one of
those thorough men. He does his
shopping with little bits of paper.
Had Dixon been on earlier our stay
would have been a perfect oasis of salt.
Dixon went straight out after breakfast
and bought salt.—a good deal of salt.—
enough for anything between a battalion
and a brigade. We all came and
inspected it; we boasted of it to the
rest of the section; its fame spread to
the rest of the platoon. The rest of
saltless roasts in a spirit of dull acquies-
cence. We took pity on them and lent
them salt—as much as they wanted.
That night the cooks—thanks to the
A.S.C., and to a great effort on the part
of our quartermaster—gave us a change,
boiled salt beef.
We never speak of salt in our Mess
now.
More Shipping Precautions.
“Stories of the liner Orduna having flown
the American flag on the last stage of her
voyage from America, were told by passengers
landing at Liverpool last night. . . .
When the Oruna arrived at the landing
stage she was not flying the American flag;
it was said she lowered it before entering the
Mersey. . . .
The Ondura was not bearing her name in
the usual prominent places."
Daily Dispatch.
We believe the above vessel is leaving
Liverpool again in a few days as the
Odruna, and returning from America
as the Orduan. It is hoped that before
the possible variations of the name
have been fully exhausted submarines
will have ceased from troubling.

THE MAGIC WORD.
No ordeal in life so terrifies me as a
visit to the dentist.
I do not claim any originality for
this feeling. Most persons have it,
and writers for the Comic Press have
flourished on it for years. I merely
state it here not as a joke but as a
fact, because everything that follows
depends upon it. I wish to say also
that, though everyone's teeth are more
sensitive than anyone else's, my teeth
are more sensitive still. The slightest

one enters; and he prepared the fatal
chair and rattled among his weapons
with all his customary gaiety. I thought
again of Sir KENELM D1GBY's fable, and
“What's fun to you is death to me,”
I murmured to myself as I took up
position and opened my mouth. And
as I did so I was only too conscious
that I was shaking; not purely from
fear but because two nights of tooth-
ache make one a jelly.
The examination began . . .
Now, at last, comes the point of
this tedious narrative.
“Well,” said the dentist, “ you're
in a pretty bad way, I can tell you.
Why they've been going so quickly of
late I can't say, but you want patching
up in all directions. Two of the nerves

after two or three days of pain. The
| appointment hung over me like a
well, you know what it is like, and I
went through all the usual preliminary
stages, only in my case they were
more distressing. The whole point of
this truthful history is to show by what
means I in the end conquered the flesh.
I reached the door, suddenly and
totally (as usual) free from pain, and,
overcoming the impulse to retreat,
pressed the bell with a reluctant and
trembling finger. The usual gigantic
footman opened the door—a man with
thirty-two of the soundest teeth in
Europe, and therefore the least sympa-
thetic sight to the eyes at this moment.
Why my dentist keeps such a servant
I cannot imagine. And yet, on the
other hand, one would not choose as
janitor a poor creature with a swollen
| cheek or his head in a bandage. I
cannot say what the perfect dentist's
footman should be like—I have no
apology obliterates the fault, but the
thought that someone might not think
them overworked breaks their hearts.
He was so late on this occasion that
I had time to look through a score of
papers and lose myself in the pictures
of the War. Illustrated papers being
not much in my line, I was peculiarly
interested in these, and the privations
and triumphs, the heroisms and sacri-
fices of the great struggle took on a
new vividness, and more than ever I
wished myself younger so that I too
might join in the fray.
I was in the midst of these reflections
when the giant footman entered with
the dread summons, and I returned
with a jolt to my drab pacific existence
once more, and faltered behind him up
the stairs with a beating heart. Absurd
to be so cowardly, and yet there it is.
My dentist greeted me with his usual
loathsome cheerfulness, although I
cannot say that I really want him
are quite exposed.” (My heart fell
three or four inches with a thud.) “It
will be a long and rather uncomfort-
able job, I'm afraid.” (It fell again,
for I know only too well what horrors
are contained in the word “uncomfort-
able” as used by a dentist.) “All I
can do to-day,” he added, “is to drill
two or three of the worst of them.”
I sat up. Drill! Had I heard him
aright 2
“Did you say drill?” I asked.
“Yes,” he replied. “Two or three
must be drilled at once.”
My fears suddenly left me. I grew
firm and resolute, careless of pain; for
I too, after all, was to be in the military
movement. At least my teeth were.

FRIGHTFULNESS.
Coombes Minor was sitting on the
hot-water pipes after prep. There is
no need to rush off to bed nowadays,
for Jagger, our beast of a house-prefect,
does company drill in the gymnasium
every night. It is a wonderful thing
that Kitch ENER always picks out the
decent prefects for coms. and gives the
brutes a miss. We were just taking
it out of young Lepping for swank.
His brother is a casualty, so we were
rotting Lepping by saying that he was
not wounded by a German sniper, but
kicked by a British army-mule when
ten miles from the trenches. All at
once Coombes Minor broke in, “You
chaps don't take this war seriously
enough. We want to be frightful, like
the Germans.” No doubt Coombes
would have explained his plan, but just
then young Lepping switched the light
off and threw inkpots. -
However, Coombes began next morn-
ing when we went to old Giles. Old
Giles is one of those polite beasts who
always say “Good morning” when they
come into the class-room, and then
hand out the punishments wholesale.
He said it this morning. Everyone but
Coombes answered “Good morning,”
but Coombes said “Death to Germany."
“H'm,” said old Giles; “Coombes
is defying an empire of seventy millions.
IIis defiance would be more impressive
from an elevation. Stand on the form,
Coombes, and write me out Delenda est
Carthago five hundred times in deten-
tion.”
- Then we went to Newbold for Maths.
Coombes preferred to spend his time
writing a hymn of hate. He had got
the first line done all right, but then he
stuck. Second lines in poetry are
Well, Coombes had
written, “I hate thee, William, oh, I
hate,” when Newbold collared his paper.
Would you believe that Newbold took
it as applying to himself 2 We always
called him “Bodger,” and I'm sure that
Coombes never knew his name was
William. Well, Newbold, thinking he
was the only William in the world,
reported Coombes to the Head for gross
: impertinence.
Coombes was so occupied thinking
of trouble to come that he forgot all
about his campaign till dinner. Now
Progers, our housemaster, makes what
he thinks is intelligent and elevating
conversation at meal-times. The gravy
gets like glue while he is dismembering
Austria instead of the joint.
“If you please, Sir,” said Coombes,
“don’t you think it would help the
Empire if we used less bread and helped
|...to pull prices down 2"

must preserve our stocks of flour. It
seems to me that flour should be
utilised in its most nutritious forms.
Bread, for example, and not pastry.
Do I understand that you purpose ab-

“Yes, Sir,” said Coombes, with a
wild look in his eye. He confided to
me aſterwards that he felt convinced
that Progers was a naturalised German.
Nothing else could account for such
treacherous conduct.
Then Coombes began to argue that
we ought to give up our gold to the
Government. I agreed, of course. The
Government can have all my gold in
mid-term and welcome. When it came
to be settled it was found that the only
gold in the form was Lepping's scarf-pin.

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
RAIDS AND THINGs.
- Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--The prospect of
a raid is the great attraction just now
at week-end parties. Dick and Dottie
Flummery sent round invitations, a
little while ago, when Dick was home
from the Front for a few days' leave:
“Come from Friday to Monday. Raid
expected.” As they're lucky enough
to have a place on the East coast,
people were simply slaying each other
to get there, and Popsy, Lady Ramsgate,
wrote to say she didn't mind where
they put her up, in the garage or even
with the dogs, she said, if only she
might come ! Pompom and I were
invited, and went off at once to get.
raid-wraps. “Olga " is making quite
a feature of these big, cosy, fur-lined
satin wraps with hoods lined with the
Union Jack, great enamelled buttons
with one of our Allies' flags on each, a
design of bombs, guns, aeroplanes and
submarines in steel embroidery down
the fronts and round the skirts, and a
little precious pistol pocket on the hip.
For dogsles she makes them all sizes,
down to the weeniest, and my angel
looks too darling for words in his.
Dick and Dottie, whose place is not
far from Herrimport and so in the
thick of the fun, were all ready for
anything. But nothing happened for
three days, and on Monday evening we
were feeling very cheap at the thought
of going away the next day raidless.
We stayed up, hoping against hope,
till some of us gave up in despair and
went to bed. Dick and the rest of
the men went out to make observa-
tions and report if anything was
coming. Suddenly, at past midnight,
we heard the sound of firing close to
the coast.
“They're here !” I screamed, and,
with wonderful self-possession, I at
once put on my own and darling Pom-
pom's raid-wraps.
“They're landing 1" shrieked all the
others in chorus. “Oh ! why don't
Dick and the others come back and
defend us 2 ”
One of the gardeners came rushing
in. “There's a lot of they Germans
landing close by, ladies' " he shouted.
“Herrinport's all in a buzz and they
be goin' to fire off the old cannon. But
they chaps be comin' straight for this
house !”
“Keep your heads!” I said (wasn't
I wonderful, my Daphne 2). “Let’s all
stand in a row, with our raid-wraps on
and our revolvers pointed ”
IIowever, they wouldn't stand in a
row, and they wouldn't do anything
when I had the lights switched off,
someone else had them switched on
again, and then in another moment the
invaders were upon us and had burst
into the house, a crowd of them, all
muffled up in cloaks and caps.
“Ach Himmell” one of them cried.
“You are prisoners, mein littel ladies.
We take you back to de Vaterland l’’
“You don't take me or Pompon back
to your immensely odious Waterland!”
I said, putting my little petty-pet be-
hind me in his basket. “You’ll have
to step over my dead body before you
touch my own darling !” and I pointed
my revolver.
At that moment Popsy, Lady Rams-
gate, who was one of those that had
given up in despair and gone to bed,
came rushing down without her raid-
wrap and without several other things
that would have improved her appear-
ance. Brandishing an umbrella, the
only kind of weapon she had managed
to snatch up, she charged the invaders
with a shrill cry of, “You dreadful
wretches | Go back to your horrid
country !” And then there was a great
shout of laughter, and the cloaks and
caps were pulled off—and there were
Dick and the rest of them and the
Delamonts from Delamont Hall three
miles away ! It was a put-up thing.
They had used the Delamonts' yacht
and let off squibs before landing, and
Herrinport replied by firing off its one
little old cannon, which burst in the
process |
So there's our raid, m'amie / Dick
and the others got a small wigging
from the powers that be, but as they
were going back to the Front it was all
kept quiet and allowed to blow over.
I’ve Mélanie de Vieuxchateau with
me on a long visit. The Comte is with
the army. Vieuxchateau, their lovely
old place in the North of France has
been spoiled by those creatures. Mélanie
only just got away in time, but the
dear thing, though in such a tearing
hurry, actually went and saw that the
bolts of the concealed trap-doors in the
old part of the chateau were drawn
back, so that anybody treading on one
of them would fall down into an
oublie'te.
In the delicious romantic old times,
people who weren't wanted quite often
fell down into these lovely old under-
ground donjons and were never heard
of again; and a former Comte, who
was Hereditary - Chief - Great - Wig-
Comber to Louis XIV., kept his nephew
for two years in the worst of all the
donjons for sneezing in the Galerie des
Glaces at Versailles when the Roi
Soleil was passing through. What
darling old days those were !
escaped, those creatures occupied the
chateau, led by a certain Prince, who
loaded himself with valuables, and,
when his hands and arms and pockets
were quite full, filled his mouth with
small jewellery, and then trod on one
of the unbolted trap-doors and fell down
into the worst of all the oubliettes (the
one where the sneezing nephew was
kept), and when he was got out had to
be operated on, as he was being suffo-
cated with brooches and ear-rings going
down his throat in the fall. It has
been given out that he was wounded in
battle, but Mélanie says the truth is
that he still has a small lace-brooch
sticking in his throat, and there's a
diamond ear-ring in one of his lungs,
and he'll never be the same man
again However, le's got a whole row
of iron crosses and eagles and things
for the “Great Victory of Vieux-
chateau !”
My dearest, I've such an adorable
secret for your own, own ear. I believe
your Blanche is going to influence this
dreadful war and have a little, little
niche in history. You remember how
popular the King of Rowdydaria was
when, as Prince Blorin, he was over
here some time ago. He and I were
great pals—he gave me that little
sapphire lucky-pig that I wear as a
mascot. So the idea came to me to
write to him and get him, for my sake,
to leave off being so wretchedly neutral
and join us and our allies with his
army, which is considered one of the
in (I'm censoring this
myself, as one can't be too reticent
about these things). I wrote him
a perfectly sweet letter, reminding him ||
of the happy times at Jinkshigh Manor,
when he distinguished himself so glori-
ously in a pillow fight in the corridors
one evening. I said I still wore his
mascot, and then I asked him to
leave off being so neutral, as it was
utterly unworthy of him, and, for my
sake, to come into the war on the right
side at once.
I got his answer the other day—
a most sweet one ! He says he re-
members his fair and charming friend
only too well for his peace of mind; that
he's honoured that I still wear his
little giſt, that he only lives to please
me, and that he kisses my hands and
is my “devoted Blorin.” So, of course,
he means to come into the War, and
I shall have been the means of ending
it sooner, and I shall be in history,
and I shall be-but I'm still
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
P.S.—I’ve just read in the morning
papers that “the King of Rowdydaria
has made a formal proclamation of
strict neutrality” 1 That Blorin is a

THE CELTIC REVUE.
THE movement towards the literary
revue makes progress. Sir JAMES BARRIE
has long been a convert. The state-
ment that Mr. W. B. YEATs has been
approached by the management of a
West-end hall should, however, be re-
ceived with caution, in spite of the
following sketch of an opening scene,
which reaches us from an unreliable
quarter:—
ScENE.— Behind the stage at some
theatre. A large dim space. At the
back one sees, perhaps, a door leading
to nowhere in particular, with a light
burning above it ; or it may be the
corner of a passage, or any old thing.
Shemus, a worn pale man in the black-
and-white garb of a business manager,
sits staring before him ºnto vacancy.
Shawn, a producer, is poring over a

So sick I feel I could throw up my part.

House of Lords, Tuesday.—In casual
lull of work undertaken on behalf of
Empire noble lords to-day turned for
five minutes to think about themselves.
One of the odd things that go to build-
ing up of British constitution is that
House of Lords practically have no
as is well known, have elaborate estab-
lishment under direction of Committee
annually elected.
Less well known that in these dire
circumstances remote end of Terrace,
corresponding with that at t'other end
where in due season wife of the SPEAKER
privily entertains her friends to tea, is
reserved for the peerage. SARK retains
vivid recollection of one summer after-
noon when he saw HALSBURY, while still
Lord Chancellor, seated at a Table set
in this remote quarter and pouring tea
out of a large brown pot for refreshment
of two ladies.
Sacred reserve little frequented. Fact
is, eight times out of ten, at the hour
commonly appointed for taking tea—
five o'clock, to wit — noble lords, their
daily task accomplished, have shut
up shop and are wending their way
homeward or club ward.
This practice makes more remarkable
a movement formally approved at to-
day's sitting. If noble lords approach-
ing public business at half-past four
habitually conclude it at five o'clock,
what do they want with dinner prepared
on the premises at eight or half-past 2
On the rare occasions in the Session
is to adjourn at eight o'clock, re-
suming the sitting at half-past nine,
having in the meantime been home to
dinner. Now resolved, by acceptance
of report of Select Committee presided
over by DoNough MoRE, to have Refresh-
ment Department under management
of Kitchen Committee, on same lines as
that which looks after comfort of the

engagement of chef, staffs of cooks and

withal to cook dinners for indefinite

therefore, what arrangements you have

have been made we should be prepared

“Yes,” she said, “lots. 13ut at this moment I'm knitting
a bed-sock for some frost-bitten soldier, and it's got to be
finished to-night.”
“Won't to-morrow do?" I said.
“No,” she said, “it won't. The whole parcel must go
off to-morrow morning to the hospital."
“Oh, very well,” I said, “if you won't listen, you
won't, and there's an end of it. I only thought you might
like to have a little intellectual conversation even while
you were knitting. Some people would prefer to have a
certain amount of outside intellect thrown into a bed-sock,
especially as I understand that bed-socks have no heels
and are, therefore, not in themselves of the highest interest."
“This bed-sock,” said Francesca, “doesn't aim at being
interesting; it hopes to be comfortable. So please go on
reading your evening paper to yourself. I'm not one of
those geniuses who can knit and talk and write letters and
read papers all at one and the same time.”
“All right,” I said; “but when Mrs. Archdale comes into
the room I warn you I shall talk to her whether she's
knitting or not. I simply insist on telling her about the
Dardanelles.”
“And that,” said Francesca, “would be conduct un-
worthy of a host. But she hasn't brought her knitting
with her.”
“How terrible for her,” I said.
to forget one's knitting?"
At this moment Mrs. Archdale entered the room. She
was staying with us for two nights, and, having left her
knitting behind, she was for the moment a sort of free
lance among women. Now Mrs. Archdale, who is the
kindest of women, has two main characteristics. Either
she is wanting to help somebody else or she is actually help-
ing somebody else. She came in trailing clouds of glory
behind her in the shape of a huge skein of white wool
and she showed only a faint interest in the Dardanelles.
“I must help,” she said, “and as all the knitting needles
in the house are occupied I am going to wind this wool
into a ball.”
“And he,” said Francesca, thus lightly indicating me,
“will help you. It's time he did something. He can hold
the skein while you wind off.”
“Splendid!” I said with an alacrity which, I am sure,
was hollow. “Give me the skein. Let me hold it. Of
course I'm a champion tangler. All the skeins I've ever
held have had thousands of knots in them. I suppose it's
because of my thumbs; but a man can't help his thumbs,
can he 2 Let us begin at once;" and I sprang from my
chair and seized the nearer parts of Mrs. Archdale's skein.
Gently, but with the utmost firmness, Mrs. Archdale
declined my help. She could never dream, she said, of
separating a man from his evening paper. It would be
unforgivable. Besides, she could manage quite well with-

“Use the back of his armchair,” said Francesca. “It's
the only suitable one in the room. He can bend forward.”
“Yes,” I said, “I’m the best bend-forward in the neigh-
bourhood. You'll miss me nearly every time. Besides, if
you do catch me, what does it matter? To be strangled is
nothing so long as it's in a good cause.”
But Mrs. Archdale said No, it was quite unnecessary.

“What does it feel like
had a patent and infallible plan for winding wool unaided.
All she had to do was to put the skein round her foot and
knee—like this—and the thing was as good as done. Even
if she did happen to want a chair-back, there were plenty
in the room that she could use at a pinch without incon-
veniencing me. Thereupon she began.
It might be supposed that in the contest which followed
all the odds were on the side of a resolute and resourceful
woman, as against a mere inanimate bundle of wool, but to
suppose thus would be doing an injustice to the innumer-
able wiles and the worse than devilish traps of this
memorable skein. It was not one duel, but a whole series
of duels, in which Mrs. Archdale seemed to compose herself
against her will into a succession of momentary tableaux
rivants. Sometimes she was foiled, sometimes she triumphed.
Her arms, her hands, her feet, her head involved them-
selves in the most remarkable positions, but, though the
dastardly skein seemed never to diminish, the white ball,
the symbol of hope, the proof of a woman's unconquerable
mind, steadily grew in size. I could not remove my
fascinated eyes from her, but Francesca kept hers imperturb-
ably on her bed-sock, while her fingers moved and her
needles clicked with a dreadful and dauntless celerity. Let
me describe what I saw. -
Tableau No. 1. Industry Depressed by Care.—Mrs. Arch-
dale on the sofa, with the skein firmly bound round her
right foot and knee. She makes a few rapid passes with
both hands, meets an obstruction, attempts in vain to
separate it into its component parts, says “Tut-tut” several
times, bends down suddenly and seizes her feet in an atti-
tude of lowly despair.
Tableau No. 2. Victory Crowning the Brave.—Mrs. Arch-
dale disengages the skein from her foot and knee, hangs it
over the back of a chair and rises to her full height. She
then winds wool feverishly round her waist and neck, and,
with strands of wool dependent from her hands, spreads
out both her arms in a posture strongly resembling that of
the Crimean monument in Waterloo Place.
Tableau No. 3. Thought IRuling the World.—Mrs. Arch-
dale, still standing, passes the wool round the back of her
head, bites it, presses it against her breast with her chin
and drops her arms to her sides.
After this there were several minor tableaur, and it was
evident that both parties were feeling their punishment
severely. Mrs. Archdale, however, lasted the better of the
two, and eventually we came to -
The Final Tableau. The Lure of the Spider.—Mrs. Arch-
dale, standing, with tight strands of wool radiating from her
feet, her body and head to all her fingers and both her wrists
and elbows. Through these she looms, dimly visible. She
attempts to untie herself, trips and falls backwards into the
sofa. “At last,” she murmurs, and, lo, with a few frantic
circular movements the ball is completed and the spider
emerges from her web.
After this it hardly seemed necessary to discuss the
Dardanelles. - R. C. L.

MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.
THE offices I have just taken are
very convenient.
I can sit in the inner sanctum and,
by leaving the connecting door slightly
ajar, can see right through to the outer
door, and observe ineomers before they
have time to spot me. To a man start
ing without a clientèle this is extremely
useful. It does not look well to be caught
lolling back in one's arm-chair reading
light literature at, say, 11.30 A.M.,
especially if one's feet are on one's
writing-table.
When my typist is in the outer office
of course I can throw precautions to
the winds.
I only moved in last Wednesday,
and if I happen to be alone and hear
or see the outer door open I usually
spring to attention and bring the tele-
phone receiver smartly to my left ear,
keeping the right ear and both eyes
trained on the incomer.
Generally it is the typist coming in
from lunch, or from the bank, or from
wherever typists go for employers who
are without business; but yesterday I
received a shock. I was deeply en-

I had a fleeting glance of a man
before I rushed back to the receiver, a
man with a small black bag such as
some solicitors wear. I motioned to
him to be seated, and left the door ajar
so that my visitor should not miss
hearing anything that might be in-
structive from the inner office.
I disregarded the appeals of the tele-
phone operator. “Please repeat that,
Sir Robert,” I said to the instrument.
“I was called away for a moment by
another client. Ah, yes, quite so. But

I read:—

SPY RASH.
My cousin Charles has had spy
rash. He lives on the East Coast. He
caught it by running against a German.
The German had taken a house on the
cliff with a pleasant sea view. My
cousin, who was taking a walk in the
night air to help his digestion, noticed
curious little flashes proceeding through
the German's best bedroom window.
Charles, who says he knows Morse
code, mentioned the matter to the
police. The police were very polite
and thanked him and said that they
would see to it. A week or so after-
wards they came along and told Charles
that he was quite right about the man
being a German, but that there was no
cause for alarm. The German didn't
sleep very well at night through worry-
ing about his German affairs, so he
walked about his bedroom. If, as
sometimes happened, he forgot to pull
down the blind, his passing between
the light and the window might give
to a civilian unversed in such matters
the appearance of signalling. The
police assured Charles that this was
the correct explanation of the pheno-
menon and that there couldn't be any
mistake as they had it direct from the
German himself. -
They added that they quite under-
stood people being nervous in wartime;
that they were only too glad to be able
to reassure them; that the matter had
been scarcely any trouble, and that the
weather was very cold. Charles, who
is a suspicious person, wasn't over-
satisfied with what the police told him.
He didn't doubt their bona fides, but
thought that they might conceivably
have been misled by the German. He
sacrificed several nights' rest watching
the German's best bedroom window. He
noticed that the German couldn't sleep
most nights, and that he generally for-
got to pull down the blind. He wrote
to the M.P. for the district about it in
case he should care to mention the
matter to the House of Commons. The
M.P. wrote back and thanked Charles.
He said that, if the police had been
informed, there was no need for alarm.
He added that he could quite under-
stand people getting nervousin wartime,
that it had been no trouble, and that
the weather in town was wretched.
Aſter the Zeppelin raid the German
gave up the house as the neighbourhood
was none too safe. He forgot to pay
his rent and forgot to take away a few
little things, including a complete set
of wireless. The landlord told Charles,
and Charles was very cross with the
German, the police and the M.P. He
seemed to think that the safety of
determined to take the question up
himself.
He became most suspicious. He had
a terrible down on pigeons. Since his
cook forgot to ventilate a pie containing
dead pigeons, he has never been fond
of them. Now he never meets a pigeon
without wanting to do it an injury. I
think that he was justified in shooting
at a prize carrier pigeon belonging to
a local farmer. It's very difficult to
detect the nationality of a pigeon on
the wing, and Charles himself didn't
expect to hit it first time. He wasn't
so vexed at having to pay damages as
at being fined for not having a gun
licence.
It was silly of him to wring the neck
of old Martha's favourite hen. Even
a cursory inspection would have con-
vinced him that it wasn't a pigeon.
After all, old Martha has just as much
right to carry a pet fowl about under
her cloak as other ladies to carry pet
dogs. The death of Jenkins' parrot
was never brought home to Charles,
and in any case no jury acquainted
with the bird would have awarded
damages. If Jenkins had any liking
for the animal he shouldn't have let
it wander about at night unaccom-
panied. Luckily the post office em-
ployee whom Charles clodded down
from the top of a telegraph pole got
well again, so that didn't cost very
much. If Charles had discovered
sooner that the foreigner lodging two
doors away was a Swede, he wouldn't
have spent three consecutive nights on
the wet grass and caught pneumonia.
I am glad that I dissuaded him from
throwing the little elderly man off the
railway bridge on to the line. It was
stupid of the man to loiter on the
bridge, but I still shudder when I think
of the thud he would have made when
he arrived. -
The unpleasant-looking man who
spent two hours on the cliff doing
nothing but look suspicious ought to
send Charles's wife a box of chocolates
or something. But for her presence of
mind his life would have been brought
to an abrupt conclusion. Charles
marked him down at once. Owing to
his previous mistakes he thought that
it would be better to have a second
opinion before making away with the
man. That's why he came and dug
me out. I was reading a rather inter-
esting book at the time, but as he
was loading-up both his revolvers and
seemed to think that the matter was
urgent I went to have a look at the
fellow. He was such an ill-favoured
individual that I decided not to inter-
fere. I wasn't going to be jealous
because Charles got all the credit. On
Charles's wife. She wanted to know
where Charles was, and I told her that
he was on the cliff shooting a man. I
warned her to keep out of the danger-
zone in case the man was a spy, as
Charles suspected. He might have had
bombs and things about him which
would go off with the shooting.
She asked what would happen if the
man turned out not to be a spy. I told
her that if the jury viewed the corpse
the verdict would possibly be “justi- |
fiable homicide”; probably, “murder.”
As she wanted to know how the latter 1
verdict would affect Charles, I didn't feel
that I ought to conceal from her that
only the Court of Criminal Appeal and
the Home SECRETARY would stand
between him and the hangman. She
didn't seem to have much confidence
in either the Court of Criminal Appeal
or the Home SECRETARY and decided
to go and look for Charles. I advised
her not to mix hel self up in the affair;
but women are obstinate creatures.
When she arrived Charles was just
training his arsenal on to the man, and
she had no difficulty in locating him.
She at once identified the fellow as a
harmless local parson and a great friend
of her father. Charles believed her at
the time, though she didn't offer to
introduce them. I asked her why she
didn't make him a dean or a bishop
while she was about it. She said she
would have done so only Charles is so
suspicious that he might have insisted
on the man showing his legs. This
affair so disheartened Charles that he
has declined the local Mayor's re-
quest that he should join the Special
Constabulary.
A SECRET.
WHEN the morn is grim and ugly,
When the cold is harsh and crude,
When you've lain serene and snugly
Under blankets warm and good;
When its tone to pink is verging
As the frost your nose benumbs,
And your fingers, on emerging,
Feel like someone else's thumbs;
Rise, I say, for very pleasure;
Tread the oil-cloth then and there;
Take a full and ample measure
Of the icy morning air.
Take the bluff embrace of Winter;
Face the frost and fear is fled;
Then (if you're a speedy sprinter)
Sprint back instantly to bed )
Contrast makes our joys completer;
Warmth is warmer after chill;
You will doze an hour the sweeter

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE are travel-books and travel-books. What have we
not all endured from the linked boredom long drawn out
of some of them, their depressing pictures and unleavened
letterpress | Fortunately there exists also the kind written
by Mr. NorMAN Douglas, of which the present volume,
Old Calabria (SECKER), is, I believe, the third. It is from
first to last a most joyous production. Calabria is the
part of Italy least explored by foreigners; probably this
is what tempted Mr. Douglas thither. I am certainly
glad, since it gives us all the chance of enjoying the journey
in his company. Better could hardly be found. Mr.
Douglas has, beyond everything, the gift of eternal youth,
which is the ideal equipment of your travelling companion.
More than that, one detects in him (for all his sly affecta-
tion of regarding himself as a cold-blooded Northerner) a
sympathetic kinship with the South, which again and
again smooths the path before him and incidentally
explains much of the charm of his pages. Mr. Douglas's
style is, like his outlook upon life, a thing peculiar to him-
self and wholly irresistible. He is a philosopher, with
a keenly appreciative eye, a fund of real and pertinent
knowledge, and, above all, the gift of laughter. It is this
chuckling humour, genial, ironic, a trifle Rabelaisian, that
one remembers most in the journey; difficulties and even
dangers seem to vanish before it. To read this book is in
short to read the sort of letters that persons who are
seems to be chatting with Mr. Douglas himself in some
warm Southern garden, over an excellent dinner and a
bottle (or perhaps two) of native wine. And in such
company the wine and the stories would be, one feels, of
vintage quality. I should perhaps mention that the cost
of the present feast is fifteen shillings. It is worth every
penny of it.
I have the feeling that your knowledgeable and expert
critic of the higher sort would have no good word to say
for Grocer Greatheart (LANE), though he might, in an
exhilarated and generous moment, see some good in the
analysis of the grocer mind and the picture of the shipwreck
in the earlier chapters. The tale of desert island, treasure
trove and intermittent revolver practice he would label
rubbish, and not very new rubbish at that, and he would
remark bitterly that never outside phantasy or farce
had the arm of coincidence been stretched to such
length as in the chance meeting of the various treasure-
hunting parties. But I, being a common reader, entirely
satisfied if I am kept breathlessly excited and hopelessly
amused, confess to an unequivocal gratitude to Mr.
ARTHUR H. ADAMs for a first-rate evening's pastime.
The particularly fascinating features of his desert island,
which by the way pretends to no ſairy qualities, in-
cluded the inexplicable apparition, in the absence of any
human habitation, of a lady's stocking-suspender, the
mysterious sounds of a brass band indifferently playing
popular classical airs in the far distance, and the sudden

the unusually childish habit of sulking when spoken to
crossly. Altogether it is a most refreshing yet quite
legitimate neighbourhood, my only complaint against it
being that it did once or twice remind me rather too
closely of that other island which BARRIE’s Admirable
Crichton so competently ruled. Be it noted, however, that
Mr. ADAMs is not out for satire or any other latent purpose;
his simple object is to entertain, and, in my common judg-
ment, he has not failed.
We can't get to know half enough about the Navy these
great days, and perhaps many of us are something stricken
in conscience because (when we come to think of it) it was
little enough we had learnt and a good deal too much we
had taken for granted about the ships and the men that
fight the ships. Mr. L. CoPE Cornford, in Echoes from
the Fleet (WILLIAMS AND NoFGATE), presents various aspects
of Naval life and work through the pleasantly refractive
And if to-day when we've our fill,
God knows, of serious facts, you still
Would turn for solace (as is right)
To fiction not too deep nor light,
Well woven, not too closely knit,
With humour and a touch of wit,
Urbane and expert—this is it.
The reading of Enter An American (METHUEN), by
E. CRosBY-HEATH, leaves me under the impression that
the writer is an American lady who has spent some days
in London. No English writer, I think, would have been
capable of making the American hero so unobtrusively
and yet so genuinely American in his externals as is
Spencer K. Wallace, who intrudes as an earthly providence
into the sacred circle of female paying guests assembled at
Carabas Court, Carabas Square, and immediately sets to
medium of sketches and
stories, and no less a person
than Lord CHARLES BERES-
Ford vouches for the accuracy
of the presentment. So I
merely hand on to you his

work to compose quarrels, bring parted relatives together,

generally to confer upon suf-
ering humanity such benefits
as may spring from the pos-
session of unaffected kindli-

The nationality of the writer
is further indicated by the
use, in her narrative and in
the mouths of British charac-
ters, of such expressions as
“stopped off,” “to take
around,” “she was named
for her aunt,” and others of
a similar nature. As for the
sex, I think only a woman
could have described with so
much insight and shrewdly

tinguishing characteristics of
Mrs. Golling, Mrs. Curran,
Mrs. Bannister and Mass

Carabas Court, and of Miss

I confidently expect to be assured on authority that
E. CRosBY-HEATH is an Englishman who has never been
out of London and has evolved his American out of his
own inner consciousness. Be that as it may, the book
itself, so long as it remains in the region of Carabas Court,
is very bright and entertaining. I like particularly the
passage in which Mr. Wallace describes the merits of his
three deceased wives to the astonished “guests” of Miss
Pewsey. If I might hint a fault it would be that the long
arm of coincidence must be tired out by the work put upon
it; that the flats are, perhaps, inadequately “jined,” and
that the sentiment is too freely sugared. I should add that
Mr. Spencer K. Wallace has his moments of human weak-
ness. As expectant Governor of his native State he promises
benefits to one of his numerous protégés: “I shall fill my
office but poorly,” he says, “if I can't shake a few plums
into your pocket.” Nothing could well be franker as an
avowal of political principles.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XVI.
(From the IEev. HENRY MoD Esworth, Fairwell Vicarage,
Bucks.)
WILL your Majesty pardon me if I venture for a few
moments to address myself to a person so sublime as your-
self? I am encouraged to do so by the belief that, when
all is said and done, you, with your store of gorgeous
uniforms, with your immense armies moving obediently at
your word, with your millions of subjects and the serried
ranks of your flatterers commending your wisdom as
it were infinite and immutable—you, I think, are only a
man like myself, an unfeathered two-legged thing, tossed by
circumstance and blown about by the gusty winds of
merely human passion. Your work, such as it is, is done
in the glare of publicity and to the sound of big guns
dooming thousands to death. I have my duty laid out for
me in this quiet village; but some day the tremendous
hour will begin to strike for each of us; our dear familiar
things will fade and we shall be summoned to that dread
tribunal where each shall give an account of his deeds.
When that comes about it will profit you as little to have
been great and worn a crown as it will avail me to plead
my own obscurity and the humble nature of my tasks.
Howitzers on that day will be as useless as hymns, and a
military cloak will be no better defence for you than a
cassock for me. I conclude, therefore, that we may talk
together on equal terms. -
This, as I say, is a quiet village, and we are said to be a
slow folk. We discuss the weather, the price of wheat, the
heavy amount of the rates, the poor supply of cottages and
their high rent, and the more obvious aspects of political
affairs. Before last August the thought of war had not
been in our minds, and even when war came and we realised
that we must take our share of it there was no sudden flame
of excitement, but rather a steady glow of earnest resolution,
despening as the days went by. Since then we have come
to know what war is. Fiſty of the men of this district,
splendid fellows from all ranks of life, have joined the
colours. Six of these will never see their home and their
village again. Four others have come back maimed and
drag their slow steps about the roads, but the only thought
of these is to get well quickly and return to the fighting-
line. We speak now of Belgium and the unforgettable
sufferings and outrages you have put upon her, and our
prayers go forth for the success of our arms and those of
our allies. Yes, the thoughts of men and the values of
things have been deeply changed by six months of war.
For me, too, there has been much searching of heart.
When Belgium was laid waste and her people massacred;
when Scarborough and Whitby were bombarded and women
and children were wantonly done to death; when your
Admirals threatened to sink inoffensive merchantmen with
their crews—then, I confess it, a flame leapt up within me
and I asked myself of what use my manhood and my
strength, and my thews and sinews hardened by the sports
of youth, could be to me unless I employed them in fighting
actively with my brothers for the country that gave me
birth and sheltered me. Even a clergyman of thirty-three
might learn his drill and in a short time help to fill a
trench. So I thought and all but decided to present myself
at the recruiting station and take my chance with the rest.
But I paused and, as I think, I rightly paused. Here was
my duty; to this my vows had bound me and I had no
right to shirk doing it in order to follow the easier path.
After all it was no small thing to be allowed to pray, to
sustain, to comfort, and in carrying out my profession with
all my heart and soul I might yet be helping to strike a
blow at the accursed system which you represent and
glorify. Thus reasoning I have stayed at home with my
people. We help one another in the daily round and bear
with such resignation as we can command the many shocks
and fevers of the War, not faltering in our determination
and rejoicing that we have so dear a country to serve. ”

from the Canal on short furlongs.”—Times of Egypt.

A CAT OF WAR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I'm sure I don't
want to be spiteful, and I'm as ready
to sink class and party differences as
anyone, if only some people who think
they're gentlemen just because they
belong to officers would do the same,
and if I have a private quarrel I'm not
one who can't keep it to herself instead
of writing to the papers and rousing
public feeling: but if others like to
start that game, why, I can play it
too; and I'm better British any day
than that mongrel that writes to you
and calls himself “A Very Glad Dog,”
and boasts of his Airedale father and
Irish Terrier mother—and, if you ask
perfect lady—and if you don't believe
me ask Jim, that's our cook—that I'd
never even have spat in his face, it
being war time, if he'd observed the
traditions of the Service. You might
think from his saying that he “came
back feeling pleasantly tired" that he
had it all his own way, but I may tell
you he hadn't, in spite of his superior
gun power, and if he's afraid to go up
the rigging a ship's no place for him,
anyway. All he could do was to sit below
and talk big about the 13-5 guns on his
boat, and that a destroyer, which shows
how much he knows about our Service.
I'm sure you're tired of hearing
about him now, Mr. Punch, and I don't
wonder; but I must just tell you one
before I could make him notice, and
he nearly threw me down because I
scratched his hand, but he told every-
one afterwards about my having dis-
covered them, and I'm rºot the sort to
bear malice. “Couldn't make out what
was wrong with Susy, mate,” he went
about saying to one after another.
“She kept clawing and yowling like
mad, and she'd been purring quite
quiet a minute before; and then I sees
she was staring all the time to star-
board, and, ‘Begob, old lady,' says I,
‘you’re right.' And then she makes
for the wireless room, and the chap he
tells me she was purring louder than
the engines while he sends off the
message.” Do you wonder that they
me, between ourselves
there wasn't much glad-
ness about him when I'd
finished with him on our
T.B.D. And I've heard
his grandfather was a
Dachshund, and, though
I don't hold with repeat-
ing scandal, there's a
story I wouldn't say isn't
true, that his mother
used to go to Sinn Fein
meetings and wag her
tail at the dynamite
speeches, and I'm sure
I hope he's proud of her
—though he did say that
I was a dirty Persian
and much the same
thing as a Turk, just
out of spite because I
have a coat that he
might well envy with
his ugly, tously, yellowy
thing; it's a beautiful
steel-grey, and only the
other day the Admiral
complimented me on it
Irish Sergeant (drilling recruits). “STIDDY THERE-STIDDY 1 SHURE, on E
NEEDs As MANY EYEs As A centipede. To BE AFTHER WATCHIN' YE.”
all say they wouldn't go
into action without me?
I told you we had the
Admiral aboard just
afterwards, and he was
introduced to me, but I
must say that, though
I'm no snob and don't
want to be prejudiced
against him just because
he's an Admiral and
has a bigger yellow
band on his fur than I'd
call good taste, I didn't
care for him as much
as Jim or Bill for all
his politeness. He never
picked me up, though I
stood up against his legs
without ever putting a
claw out and purred my
hardest. Still, I'm a
ship's cat, and I leave
toadying to them that
like it.
Well, good-bye now,
Mr. Punch. We don't see
you as regularly as we'd
when he came aboard after the North
Sea business—but I'll tell you about
that later—and said he liked to see a
Service animal the Service colour.
What's more, if one of my ancestors
was a Persian he came from the British
sphere of influence, and, anyway, we've
been naturalised for generations, and
the only time I ever tasted sherbet it
made me sick. -
If you'll believe me, too, there was a
rat on that boat of his for a whole
month, and the only time one came
near mine since the War I had him
before he reached the deck from the
dock wall; and I'll have Mr. Glad Dog
know that when he comes aboard us
he'll salute the quarter-deck like the
rest of us, or get his face scratched like
last time, or my name's not Susy.
That's what started it all, you know,
Mr. Punch. I won't say I'm fond of
thing more to show you the kind of
dog he is. He hobnobbed with all the
German prisoners that they picked up.
They didn't get as many as we, of
course, and I scratched three, and would
have done the lot, only Jim shut me
up in the galley. If you can't scratch
your enemies, all I can say is patriotism
will go to the dogs, and a precious mess
they'll make of it.
They might have given me a free
claw with the prisoners too, because,
though I don't say that the men and
the guns and the ships didn't all do
their work as well as it could be done,
and I was never one to boast, I was
really responsible for that victory. You
see we were the first boat to sight the
German cruisers, and I knew there
was big business going, because Jim
had forgotten my milk, and the light
was bad, so I was up on the look-out
like on active service, but I'll be watch-
ing out for this, and trust you'll let your
readers know the rights of the matter.
I have, Sir the honour to be,
Your obedient Servant,
A RESPECTABLE H.M. CAT.
P.S.—Perhaps you'd like to know
that I always purr when I hear any of
the four national anthems. Of course,
if people haven't any ear for music
and can only make a raspy noise when
they try to sing, I don't blame them if
they don't pay proper respect, but I
thought I'd just mention it.

Us women to our tasks befitting,
Your little fingers, far from deſt,

IT is said that the inhabitants of the
lonely island of Tristan da Cunha, in
the South Atlantic, have not yet heard
of the War. In view of a possible rush
to the peaceful shores of this resort it
may be well to print a few facts about
the island from the pen of one who has
never been there and, all being well,
will never go.
This quaint little island is the only
place in the world that does not possess
a brass band or a bagpipe, and the
simple folk living there believe khaki
to be a vegetable popular in Bessarabia.
One of the present advantages of life
in the island is that it enjoys complete
immunity from blockade. If a German
submarine were to approach its shores
the residents of Tristan da Cunha would
sally forth in their boats and proceed
to cut it open to extract its blubber.
on the latest information to hand con-
cerning him, is that he is a potentate
of considerable energy, whose world-
wide notoriety rests upon his activities
in the studio and the pulpit.
Anyone visiting Tristan da Cunha
should take his music with him. It is
almost certain that “Sister Susie" and
“It's a Long Way to Tipperary” will
be all the rage there next Christmas.
The sportsmen of the island are
eagerly awaiting the result of the great
fight between CARPENTIER and Bom-
bardier WELLs, and bets on the result
of last year's Derby are still being made.
The inhabitants of Tristan da Cunha
are great gossips. “Have you heard
the latest ?” one native will ask
another; “I got it from a man on the
Caroline when she called here for
water a year ago last August.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ENGLISH MEN OF LETTERS.
AMONG certain much-needed journal-
istic reforms I should put almost first
the necessity of printing photographs
of the ladies and gentlemen who write
letters to the Press. It is of the highest
importance that we should know what
they are like, should be able, so to
speak, to feel their bumps. It would
also be a means of eliminating the
anonymous correspondent.
The principal runners in the Corre-
spondence Stakes to-day is no longer
ALGERNoN Ashton. What has happened
to ALGERNoN ? It is true that he retired
formally from the lists some few years
ago, leaving a book of his letters behind;
but he returned in full force, with a
baby. The baby did wonderful things
in his father's missives—expressed his
opinion of the KAISER in no lethargic
manner; - but even with this domestic
incentive ALGERNoN is not what he was.
He seems to have lost his nerve. That
bold pen no longer rushes in as once
it did. It is now quite safe for a
journalist to mention 1828 as the year
of BEETHoveN's death. No one would
mind. But once ALGERNoN, more in
sorrow than in anger, yet enormously
surprised, would have set right a misled
world by stating that the year was
really 1827. And mortar can now drop
like rain from interstices in the brick-
work of MARTIN TUPPER's grave and
no editor be asked to find room for
ALGERNoN’s grief and horror. Not that
he is wholly mute. Not at all. But he
is not what he was ; le roi est mort.
Yet he has successors.
Le roi est mort / Vivent les rois / For
the successors to the throne are twain.
It is like that of Brentford—it has
two occupants, and their names are
J. LANDFEAR LUCAS and A. KIPLING
CoMMON.
Both these gentlemen are a notch
above ALGERNoN. They deal with larger
events; are more or less publicists,
while ALGERNoN was content to necro-
logise and quote Haydn's Dictionary
of Dates. They deal also with ideas,
which ALGERNoN scorned to do. You
find them everywhere; and J. LANDFEAR
LUCAS never omits to add to his name
the fact that he belongs to the Spec-
tacle Makers' Company. A. KIPLING
CoMMON may or not make spectacles:
he withholds all information about it;
it is the only point on which he is
reticent. Perhaps he makes lorgnettes
or pince-nez. Perhaps the only pair of
spectacles he ever made was at cricket.
Whatever he makes, he keeps the fact
to himself. What kind of spectacles
J. LANDFEAR LUCAs makes I do not
know; but the next time I have need
“Give me a pair of J. LANDFEAR
LUCAs's,” I shall say to the optician,
and insist upon having those and no
others. The signature of the maker
will, I am sure, be on the case. The
only fear I have is that wearing
them will force me into writing letters
to the Press. Perhaps A. KIPLING
CoMMON wears a pair, and hence his
downfall.
J. LANDFEAR LUCAS's letters would
make an enormous volume of very
mixed reading, and would need a good
index, which might be prepared by Sir
SIDNEY LEE or the Editor of Notes and
Queries. The only subject on which he
has never written is his middle name.
Why, I always want to know, does he
so dread the soil 2 What has it done
to him 2 His terror cannot be complete,
because I find a letter from him in a
recent issue of Land and Water. One
must suppose that the presence of
water just saved the situation.
A. KIPLING CoMMON is a more in-
spiring name to me. There is something
breezy in it — a suggestion of gorse
bushes and heather. It cheers up any
paper in which it occurs, irrespective of
the subject of the letter above it. “And
did you once see Shelley Plain?” was
the old question. The next generation
will be asked, “And did you once see
Kipling Common 2 ” All will be able to
reply, “Yes—in all the papers.”
I imagine these two gentlemen's day
to be one long excitement. They rise
early after a sleepless night and straight-
way fall on the morning papers. J.
LANDFEAR LUCAS has his spectacles on
in a jiffy, and, blue pencil in hand,
searches for slips, misapprehensions,
incomplete references, and defective
information. Meanwhile A. KIPLING
CoMMON is similarly at work elsewhere.
Terrible fellows, they miss nothing.
And the joy of settling down to the
delight of composing their epistles
“There is a pleasure in poetic pains,”
wrote CowPER, but how much greater
the pleasure in writing letters that shall
instruct and correct | One wonders
how the Lucasian spectacles are made
at all—that he has time for anything
but single eye-glasses.
Among students of cryptograms and
such entertaining mysteries it has been
suggested that J. LANDFEAR LUCAS and
A. KIPLING CoMMON are the same.
Knowing that a point comes when
editors kick, one of these indomitable
correspondents invented the other in
order to be able to write just twice as
many letters as he would otherwise be
permitted. The late IGNATIUS DONNELLY
firmly believed this; just as FRANCIS
BAcon (who in Mr. SNAITH's new
romance passes a bad half-crown on
SHAKSPEARE were the same, or, at any
rate, wrote each other's works.
A comparison of the signatures re-
veals extraordinary, nay, uncanny,
resemblances. Look at them: J. LAND-
FEAR LUCAs, A. KIPLING CoMMON.
Each, you will see, begins with an initial,
and these initials rhyme: A. and J. We
then pass on to a middle name printed
in full, each having two syllables; and
then to the final surnames again, each
of two syllables. And the two signa-
tures exactly balance: J. LANDFEAR
LUCAs and A. KIPLING CoMMON. The
student will observe that each has the
same number of letters — fourteen—
only one more than the fatal thirteen :
a very significant point to newspaper
readers. Note too the remarkable'
association between Land and Com-
mon. It is only after the signature
that any marked difference begins, for
it is then that J. LANDFEAR LUCAs
always adds “Spectacle Makers' Com-
pany.” This is, however, probably
merely a blind. -
I do not press the double theory.
To me it is fantastic; but in occult
circles it is much canvassed and many,
extremely interesting discussions have
been held. It is even rumoured that,
one midnight recently, an investigator;
was shown, by a man in an iron mask,
in the faint light of a dark lantern,
beneath one of the Adelphi arches, a
letter signed K. Lipfear Commas;
but of this I have no proof.
I must add that no such mystery
attaches to the name of ALGERNoN
AsHToN. He, at any rate, is real, and
has been seen playing dominoes in the
Café Royal.
“THE CAT I TH' ADAGE.”
[“There is . . . much exhortation of the
Administration to “stand pat” upon Ameri-
can rights, to avoid being made the cat's

Bold words! But cats who'd keep

[A contemporary informs us that the Secretary of the Poetry Society
considers that much more interest is taken in poetry now than in
peace time, and instances the case of a cook who was found in her
kitchen busily writing a poem on the War.]
WITH furrowed brow and wild disordered tresses
Our former treasure, Bridget, courts the Muse;

Commemorates, in rather rocky metre,
The Dublin Fusiliers' intrepid deeds,
Deaf to the call of martyrs who entreat her
To minister to their internal needs.
The kitchener that claimed her close attention
Possesses little charm indeed to-day;
In rugged stanzas, baffling comprehension,
She crowns with laurels silent “K. of K";
Stagnant the soup and greasy grows the gravy;
She lauds the “Buffs" regardless of the greens,
Or girds with caustic pen at WILHELM's Navy,
Spurning the spuds to give Von TIRPITZ beans.
Though in the poet's craft success we wish her,
Nor grudge the loss of many a toothsome dish,
We mourn the halcyon days ere thoughts of Fished

Yet, when the steak is tough, the pie-crust leaden,
We voice no plaint; we do not even frown;

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-I don't know if you have noticed
what Professor Schroer, of Cologne, has been saying
about you, but even at the risk of causing you pain I feel
I ought to draw your attention to the unfortunate im-
pression you have created out there. The nastiest knock
is when he says that your cartoons “lack modest
refinement.” I am only raking up this unpleasant story
because the Professor fortunately explains the reason why
we have got so far astray. It seems that we “have
lost the good old Low German sense of humour which
Englishmen inherited from their German ancestors.”
Now, Sir, this is a time to examine ourselves, and, if
that be true, should we not enquire whether we have not
also lost other of our national characteristics which have
reached us from the same source? At least let us see to
it that we do not lose our love of sportsmanship, our
custom of speaking the truth, our humane conception of
warfare, or any of those other excellent qualities which we
have as obviously inherited from our “German ancestors.”
I am, Yours faithfully,
PATRIOT.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, 1st
March. —Another crisis in the War.
Again a crowded House. Once more
a great speech from PRIME MINISTER.
A special Providence ordains that at
such a crisis we have at head of affairs
a strong man endowed with gift of lucid
speech, which from its very qualities of
simplicity and honesty of purpose fre-
quently, without visible effort, rises to
height of eloquence. Rarely in its
history, perhaps never, has House
found its sympathies, convictions and
aspirations so faithfully, so fully, so
forcefully expressed as on several occa-
sions during last seven months when
Asquith has stood at Table
and talked about the War,
its purpose, its prospects,
and its inevitable accom-
plishment.
True, few Prime Minis-
ters have been sustained
and inspired in equal degree
by assurance of the confi-
dence and sympathy of a
unanimous nation repre-
sented by a united Parlia-
ment. That is a position
difficult to win, hard daily
to live up to. With increas-
ing success the PREMIER
has achieved both successes.
His personality is worth to
the Empire an army in the
field, a squadron of Queen
Elizabeths at sea.
There was notable in the
speech—as usual brief, since
it was not attenuated by a
superfluous word—increased
confidence in the triumphant ending
of the War. From the day when,
standing in the same place, on the
part of Great Britain he practi-
cally declared war against Germany,
PREMIER has always spoken with quiet
assurance of certain victory. Without
boastfulness he has reiterated that
conviction. This afternoon he was
more definite.
“I assure the Committee,” he said,
“that with all the knowledge and ex-
perience we have gained His Majesty's
Government have never been more
confident than they are to-day in the
power of the Allies to achieve ultimate
and durable victory.”
Coming in the course of his speech
to the submarine “campaign of piracy
‘and pillage” undertaken by Germany
under the name of blockade, he spread
out a scrap of paper on the brass-bound
box, and amid repeated volleys of
cheering from both sides read the terms
effective. Germany, having systemati-
cally violated the restraining rules
and humane usages of civilised war-
fare, will, to quote an historic phrase
peculiarly appropriate to the situation,
be left to stew in her own juice. The
Allied Fleets of Great Britain and
France—not sneaking under water with
intent to destroy peaceful merchant
ships, but openly sailing the seas in
defiance of the German fleet cooped up,
as the PREMIER said, in “the safe seclu-
sion of their mine-fields and their closely
guarded forts”—will prevent commodi-
ties of any kind from reaching or leaving
German ports.
Business done.—Supplementary Wote
of Credit of 37 millions to meet War
expenditure to end of financial year
REPRISALS.
and a fresh Vote of Credit of 250
millions agreed to by acclamation.
Tuesday.—Oxford University and her
sister at Cambridge have between them
many proud records. None more stir-
ring than that recited by PRIME MINISTER
in moving Second Reading of awkwardly
named Universities and Colleges (Emer-
gency Powers) Bill. The attendance
was scanty, but there was strong
muster of University men, who listened
with profound interest to words falling
from lips of one in whom, as WALTER
LoNG felicitously said, “Oxford men
claim a common possession, in regard
to whom they feel they have abundant
reason to be proud, not only for his
record at the University but for the
great part he is at the present moment
playing in the history of the country.”
PREMIER had moving story to tell of
transformation wrought at the Univer-
sities. Their halls are deserted. Their
examination schools and playing fields
of their scholars and the flower of
their athletes have alike gone off to
the War. No fewer than 4,000 Univer-
sity men, two-thirds of the full muster,
are under arms. Of those that remain
all the physically fit have joined the
Officers' Training Corps.
Amongst innumerable evidences of
patriotism forthcoming since the KAISER
wantonly dragged unwilling Europe into
the war pit this example of the Uni-
versities surely shines with unmatched
splendour.
Financial consequences embarrass-
ing. No undergraduates, no fees. At
Cambridge revenue from this source,
amounting in normal times to over
£60,000 a year, is reduced by one-half.
“As an old Oxford man, with great,
undiminished, undying de-
votion to my own Univer-
sity,” the PREMIER pleaded
for new power to be con-
ferred upon the heads of
the Universities to meet
the special claims and
responsibilities that have
sprung up. WALTER LONG,
formerly of Christ Church,
speaking on behalf of the
Opposition, warmly wel-
comed the Bill, which was
forthwith read a second
time.
Business done.—Defence
of the Realm Bill passed
through Committee.
Thursday.—The case of
Mr. MEYER, his timber
purchases, and his modest
commission, up again for
discussion. BECK, on behalf
of his Chief at Board of
Works, gives frank and full
explanation, BonAR LAw chivalrously
declares that method adopted by
Government was “best possible in
circumstances.”
In interesting study of proclivities of
contractors in war time, Mr. BARLow,
who represents Salford in present Par-
liament, leaving for a while the com-
pany of his young friends, Sandford
and Merton, told in his best form one
of his many stories. A battalion of
recruits being raised in provinces, a
purchase of boots was arranged. It
was found that the soles were liable to
contract an inconvenient habit of part-
ing from the uppers before first mile of
march was completed.
Boots returned to contractor. A
few months later further supplies re-
quired for increasing number of recruits.
Application made to another firm.
Goods delivered. There were found
among them 1,500 pairs of the old lot.
“The only difference,” Mr. BARLow

of British reply. It was terse and
added in his persuasive voice, “was that
are occupied by hospitals. The pick

THERE lived a man in Germanie
(Hey ! Ho / The Goth and the Hun)
Who said, “These British wax too free;
By air and water, land and sea
They now shall be outdone.
'Tis ours to lift their tyrant yoke
From off all God-respecting folk;
In a word, to undermine their Empire.”
Thus was the game begun.
So he sent his word to the Elder Folk
(Sing hey ! for India's coral strand),
And they heard the things his hirelings
spoke -
As those who list to a tasteless joke—
But they let him show his hand.
And some waxed merry and soon forgot,
And many were they who heard him not,
But most said, “This is a God's Afflicted:
There let the matter stand.”
But some sat down by the village well
(Sixteen annas make one rupee)
Reasoning thus—“There are tales to
sell ;
They are not true, but who will tell?
Rice and toddy are cruelly dear;
Can there be no sedition here 2
This Creature pays for talk of mutiny;
Set the invention free.”
There were three poor men of Chatnam-
pore
(And Chatnampore is but the least),
But these three men are poor no more,
For one has bought himself land
galore
And one had a wedding feast.
When rents were heavy and rains de-
layed,
They lied—and God's Afflicted paid,
And the wife of the third has now gold
earrings;
Greatly are all increased.
The cloud has broken, the song is sung
(Hey ! Ho / for the lies they told),
For the man of Germanie was young
And like to a colt by the gadfly
stung,
While they of the East are old.
But some there are whose wealth has
sped, ->
Who rend the beard and shave the
head
For the dear dead days of God's
Afflicted,

He hates. They hate.
Whose madness turned to gold.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,-As an Anglo-

the bottom of my heart for publishing
Fritz's letter,” and so doing your
best (and your best is very good, my
Missus says, because you voice “the

Hunnish injustice done to my race.
If a Dachs is to be considered an
alien, and, as you know, dear Mr.
Punch, we were originally of good
old English stock, and never “made in
Germany" at all, what about Poms
and Pekies 2
For my own part I feel doubly hurt
by caricatures, for I have done my
little bit for the Allies. I claim to be
the very first British dog who took a
piece out of the leg of an Austrian
enemy—it belonged to the son of the
luggage-porter—in the early days of
August, and my Missus, engaged in
escaping from the country, was not as
leased as she should have been.
My little friend Franzl, another
Briton born in Italy like myself, dis-
putes my claim to the first bite. I must
add with sorrow that my poor friend
is now among the British subjects in-
terned in Austria.

(and enemies) called them, as they
passed me on their way to Germany;
and when my Missus got arrested at
Bozen station I made a point of tell-
ing the Polizei-Chef what I thought of
him, hinting plainly that I had no ob-
jection to trying a second Austrian leg.
Meanwhile I cannot sufficiently
thank you for the stand you have
taken against this grave and almost
Hunnish injustice (forgive me for re-
peating this expression, but I feel it
strongly) to a true British race.
I am personally, as I have men-
tioned, part Russian by descent, but
my silly Missus mixed up Poland with
Russia proper, so I must sign myself,
Your very faithful (and always ready
to bite your enemies) black-and-tan

P.S.—How soon do you think the
War will end ? Because it seems that
till it does I must not grumble about
(nor roll upon) a huge tickly red-white-
and-blue bow, but wear it with pride
and circumstance. Do I not suffer
for my country?
DEAR MR.PUNCH,-With much inter-
est and sympathy I read the pathetic
letters of my kinsman Fritz in a recent
issue of Punch. Having myself suffered
from the same sudden coldness—not to
say hostility—on the part of former
friends, and knowing that I possess an
undoubtedly authentic pedigree of at
help their comrades.
Dachshunds, the time has I think
arrived when I may justly claim to be
a British dog. I therefore venture to
suggest that in future we should be
given an English name.
Dachs is the German for badger, and
badgers are just as indigenous to the
British Isles as to Germany. In Scot-
land and the North of England the
country name for a badger is “brock.”
Why not then in future call us Brock-
hounds 2 The word has a true British
ring.

powerful influence, believe me, dear

THE FLAT-HUNTER.
WHEN I met Gladwyn-an elderly
and pessimistic bachelor—at the club
the other night I was agreeably sur-
prised to find him looking so cheerful.
Since the War began I have sedulously
avoided him, but, encouraged by his
comparatively radiant appearance, I
returned his nod and asked him if he
had been out of town. “No,” he re-
plied, “I’ve been flat-hunting for the
last three weeks—got to turn out of
my present, quarters — nuisance, of
course; but, good Lord! what right
has a non-combatant to talk of nui-
sances?” This astonishing sentiment,
coming from the most self-centred man
I know, prompted me to make some
sympathetic remark; and Gladwyn,
who loves talking about himself, at
once started off on a long recital of his
experiences. Gladwyn, I should ex-
plain, is a hopeless conversationalist,
but excels in monologue. -
“I’ve been to about twenty house-
agents,” he went on, “and nothing
could exceed their attention. The
urbanity, graciousness and splendid
appearance of their young men fills me
with admiration. Stout fellows, I be-
lieve, from what I know of one or two
of them, who drill hard in their leisure
hours and all that sort of thing, but in
the office miracles of gentleness and
persuasion. Beautifully dressed, too,
in a style of quiet elegance which makes
me painfully conscious of my own
shortcomings. But they never pre-
sume upon it, and I marvel at their
condescension in writing out endless
orders to view small flats, “upper parts'
and ‘maisonettes’ suited to my humble
requirements. It seems to me that
half London is being converted into
‘maisonettes,’ at least the unfashion-
able half. Mine always begin on the
third floor and generally consist of
bedrooms turned into sitting-rooms,
and box-rooms into kitchens. Lots of
rooms, endless stairs and no liſts.
‘Maisonettes’ are generally near rail-
way stations, about a stone’s-throw off,
and they look out at the back on the
Underground or garages or the yards
of breweries. To appreciate them fully
you want to be strong in the heart and
Regs and hard of hearing—in short, to
combine the activity of the goat with
the deafness of the adder. “Upper
parts' are always over shops on main
arteries of traffic.
With regard to flats my experience
has been that more often than not there
was nobody in when I called, or it was
inconvenient for the tenant to let me see
it at that moment, or the flat was already
let through another agent. Still, when
of the tenants has filled me with
admiration. They never give away
the agents. They never want to leave.
They always give the flat a good
character for quietness and commodi-
ousness. In one that was slap over
the Underground the lady admitted
that sometimes a “slight humming'
was audible—that was all. There are
those who volunteer the reasons of
their moving, but for the most part
they are reticent, and that I can under-
stand, since in a good many cases it is
the same as my own—a rise in the
rent on renewal.
“I have seen some charming flats,
with plenty of room, bright and airy,
and at a moderate rent, but they were
never lower than the fourth floor and
there was no lift. Why does no man

of science invent wings for ascending
stairs ? -
“I admire the house agents, and the
tenants—when they are at home—but
my feelings towards estate agents who
have offices on the same premises as
the flats they want to let are mixed.
They are extraordinarily affable, but
they are inclined to overdo it. The
flat that they want to let is always
“our show flat' — the brightest and
airiest and most attractive in the whole
block. They wax lyrical over the view
if the flat is on the fifth floor, or the
beauties of its geyser if it is in the
basement. After all, they are pro-
fessional eulogists, and praise is the
hardest thing to swallow when it isn't
about yourself. The porters are fine
fellows, and when you see them in their
uniforms they are worthy of a Blue
Hungarian Band. One I saw the other
day in Bloomsbury had a moustache
that reminded me of old VICTOR EM-
MANUEL. But the people I admire
most of all are the photographers who
are responsible for the views of the
Mansions or whatever it may be. I've
got an illustrated booklet with pictures
of a stately pile embosomed in verdure,
with spreading lawns and apparently
no other building for hundreds of miles.
The stately pile is all right, but the
verdure is all my eye. And yet people
talk of the truthful camera.”
Here Gladwyn paused for breath,
and I asked, “Have you found anything
to suit you?”
“No,” he answered, “nothing yet,
but I’m going to look at a fascin-
ating ‘maisonette' in Brondesbury
to-morrow.” -
“Well, good luck,” I said, getting up
to go; “you seem to have had a pretty
rotten time.”
“Not a bit of it,” replied Gladwyn
with unaffected cheerfulness. “I haven't
had time to think of the War for three
weeks.”

“HELP! HELP!”
Alan 1 Alan / is the name of a novel
recently announced. If this is to set a
new fashion in titles the question must
arise, how should one ask for the latest
story at the bookshop or the library 2
“What may I get you, Sir?” the
female assistant will say. “Vivien /
|Vivien l’’ the curate will murmur in
reply. And then the young lady, with
blushes, will explain, “My name is
Susie, Sir.”
Should the title be spoken in the
lev l tones used for A Faded Flower,
for instance? Or should the exclama-
tion marks be noted and given their
proper emphasis?
Would it be correct to enter the shop
and shout, “Clarence / Clarence 1" as
if the end of all things had come? or
would it be better to adopt a more
peremptory tone, as of a strong father
calling upstairs to his son, to whom he
is about to administer that which, be-
lieve him, hurts the father's heart far
more than it hurts the errant boy? Or
should the cry be uttered as a last
appeal? or on a note of hopeless resig-
nation ? or imperatively like the calling
of a dog to heel? The problem bristles
with difficulties.
And even when you have decided
how this double vocative should be
conveyed you will find that what is a
simple thing to the elocutionist may be
a grave trouble to the amateur.
DONATIONS INVITED.
AN announcement of considerable
interest is made by the Kreuz-Zeitung
to the effect that associations have been
formed in Hanover and Hamburg and
will shortly be formed in one hundred
and fifty places to collect money which
will be expended in gifts for German
soldiers “as soon as it is officially
announced that either German troops
have occupied English soil or have
achieved the overthrow of England.”
We do not know if Lord KITCHENER
and Sir John FRENCH have fully con-
sidered the advisability of introducing
some such system into our own conduct
of the campaign. Perhaps the mercen-
ary English might be induced by the
offer of a tip of some sort 2. But,
that is only a suggestion. Our present
concern is with an alien publication
which has fallen into our hands and
which contains some interesting
answers to correspondents upon the
question. The following is a transla-
tion:—

been misinformed by your local press.

it is well known that that perfidious
Empire is tottering. The intrepid avia-
tor to whom you refer cannot be said to
have technically occupied English soil,
as he was picked up in the Thames.
No, we cannot accept bread-cards in
lieu of cash.
Mac Schneider (Ansbach).-Many
thanks for your letter. We have some
sympathy with your attitude when you
say that “to have the thing merely
officially announced is not good enough
for you.” No payment will be made,
however, till it has been confirmed in
the Paris communiqué. Meanwhile do
not hesitate to contribute.
Cautious (Kiel).-We are bound to
protest against the pessimistic and un-
patriotic tone of your letter. We do
not understand how you can possibly
hold such views, living as you do in a
neighbourhood where you have daily
mulated naval strength of Germany.
No, money will not be returned under
any circumstances.
A. K. (Frankfort).-Certainly not. No
one has ever suggested that the gifts
should take the form of iron crosses. Our
never-to-be-even-for-a-moment-daunted
troops are not to be fobbed off in this
manner.
Financier (Berlin). We think your
suggestion an excellent one. As you
say, if the money were to be invested at
compound interest it might well amount
to a considerable sum before it becomes
payable. It is understood however that
it will all be compulsorily taken over
for investment in the next War Loan.

ages of last June something was being

modifications in accordance with our
increased knowledge of the subject.

LOOKING FORWARD.
ONE of the most inspiring and inter-
esting of the ceremonies in connection
with the Peace Celebrations occurred
yesterday at Chelsea, when medals were
awarded to a number of stalwart men
and youths for their fine record of ath-
leticism and self-denial during the War.
They walked in, many hundred strong,
to the strains of “Home, Sweet Home,”
the crowd, which was enormous, being
kept in order by a regiment just back
from the Front, who were given this
task to keep them out of mischief. The
procession evoked tremendous cheers,
and no wonder, for it consisted of men
in the pink of condition, who contrasted
noticeably with many of the poor fel-
lows from the War, some of whom had
a battered and not too spruce appear-
ance. A little company of wounded
soldiers left during the proceedings.
The heroes being all assembled, a
gentleman prominent in the Football
world, supported by dignitaries, officials,
and pressmen, welcomed them, in a few
well-chosen words, in the name of him-
self and fellow-sportsmen. England,
he said—and by England he meant the
cream of the country, that is, the foot-
ball enthusiasts—was proud of them.
(Cheers.) They had stuck—well, he
would not say to their guns, for that
was perhaps an unfortunate phrase
under the circumstances—but to their
own calling—to their footballs—with
a steady persistence that did them
credit. In spite of all temptation, in
spite of all the artful patriotic lures,
their self-respect as footballers had
conquered (Cheers and excitement.)
Again and again it had been put before
them by selfish and impulsive par-
tisans that their services as fit and
powerful men might be of use to Eng-
land at the Front, or even for home
military service, but nothing had
shaken them. (Cheers.) They were
adamant. They had been trained to
play football, and play football they
would. (Immense cheers.) They had
manfully remained in the path they
had chosen, and had refused to give
up their great and noble and truly na-
tional pastime. (Hear, hear.) Noth-
ing could shake them—not even the
raid on Scarborough. They were
gloriously firm — boys of the bull-
dog breed par ercellence. (Cries of
“Hurrah.”) Football, they recognised,
came first, country second, and they
behaved accordingly; and the great-
hearted public, always ready to acclaim
doggedness and pluck, stood by them
and rallied week after week to their
gallant displays in the field. (Renewed
cheers.)
To each man the Chairman then
presented an iron cross amid the
wildest excitement, and the proceedings
terminated by the band playing “After
the ball,” in which everyone present
joined. -
Offence and Defence.
“In the Assembly General Hertzog has
tried, with no success, to help the cause of
friends of his who are in prison with charges
of treason hanging over their heads. On Mon-
day Mr. Burton, Minister of Railings, coun-
tered these efforts with a stingingly critical
speech.”—Manchester Guardian.
Judging by the reports of recent pro-
ceedings in the South African Parlia-
ment Mr. BURTON's new post (or per-
haps one should say post-and-rails) will
be no sinecure. -
THE LOWLAND SEA.
“OH sailed you by the Goodwins,
Oh came you by the Sound,
And saw you there my true love
That was homeward bound?”
“Oh never will he anchor
Again by England's shore;
A-sailing by the Lowlands
Your sailor comes no more.
“They gave his ship her death-blow
As she was sailing by,
And every soul aboard her,
Oh, they left them all to die.
“They were not common pirates
Nor rovers of Sallee,
But gentlemen of high estate
Come out of Germanie!
“It was no worthy gentleman
Though he were crownčd King;
It was no honest seaman
That wrought so vile a thing!

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I HAVE seldom met a volume of more pronounced “heart
interest” than Paris Waits (SMITH, ELDER). Partly, of
course, this is due to the skill with which Mrs. M. E. CLARKE
has written it; partly to outside causes. For in reading
these thrilling pages one finds oneself oddly affected by an
old idea, deep-rooted in all our minds, that when once a
thing is in print it is over and done with, put away and
no longer personal, like bones in a museum. And then,
with the queerest shock, one realises suddenly that this
story of Paris in her suspense goes no further back
than a time whose distance can be measured by days.
Perhaps Mrs. CLARKE's method of telling helps this effect a
little. As special correspondent of The Times and as
herself long an intimate friend of Paris and the Parisians,
she was well able to appreciate every phase of the critical
weeks when the invaders threatened to storm its very
walls. Not only are her pen-pictures remarkably vivid and
realistic, but the camera has also helped, and included in
the book are many most interesting photographs of Paris
in war—a snapshot of the Avenue de l'Opéra, for example,
empty of traffic but for a solitary cyclist, or a group of
R.A.M.C. men lounging in the doorway of an hotel whose
name suggests the coupons of economy and peace. It is
all breathlessly interesting, and, as I say, there is that
added stranger thrill. Of the close of a certain historic
sunshine, and suddenly you will say, “Of course it was 1”
and recall everything that you yourself were doing that
afternoon. That I suppose is one of the minor compensa-
tions of living in history. It certainly adds profoundly to
the effect of such a record of tragedy nobly faced as we
may find here in Paris Waits, a record that even our de-
scendants, without these advantages, will never read
unmoved.
In the bald précis which Messrs. METHUEN supply with
The Family, by ELINor MoRDAUNT, they do her, it and
themselves much less than justice. I had been prepared
for boredom; I was in fact consistently entertained, and it
is certainly no inconsiderable feat on the part of the author
to make that truculent Spartan, Squire Hebberton, his
faint wife, his seven sons and four daughters, separately
and plausibly alive. We first see them on their own acres
of Cranbourne very much of the county in blood but a little
out of it in the matter of money, haunted by impending
financial catastrophe, all the more inevitable because no
Hebberton can really bring himself to face the possibility of
such a paltry destiny. The blow falls and tosses them into
situations which would have profoundly shocked their
minor acquaintances and their tenantry. And I suspect
some sort of indictment of their order is intended by the
suggestion that they did not make much of their new life.
It was rotten of the rather inhuman vicar to fall so desper-
ately in love with Pauline, the nice, horsey, romantic

day you may read that it was filled with wonderful autumn
tomboy, and spiritually mesmerise her into matrimony.

Any perceptive person could have foretold disaster, but
there was none such at Cranbourne. Pauline, a dear, finds
her salvation in the service of her hypersensitive brother,
Sebastian, whose happiness has been wrecked by his
parents' crass stupidity. The story opens in the eighties
of last century; one did not perhaps quite appreciate that
really heavy fatherhood survived to that date. Now it is
our sons and daughters that tend to put on weight. Dare
one, by the way, beg Miss MoRDAUNT to engage a really
nice proof-reader with powers of attorney to deal with such
exuberant malapropisms as our dear old friend “immured
to,” and “anchorite" for “acolyte”; and to collect
stragglers in the way of unfinished sentences? Her work
is too good for these little flaws.

border—a place that itself becomes like a character in the
tragedy, so well is the brooding spirit of it realised. |
Charlie, the elder brother, had been a pleasant wastrel till
he married Judith, a slip of a Celt with red hair and green
eyes; and the little money there was to begin with dwindled |
beneath the extortions of her poaching relatives. Then
Charlie started to drink himself to death; and Alaric, who |
had failed as a musical journalist, returned to make his
home in the tower of the farm. Thenceforward the tale is
of a Welsh Pelléas and Mélisande, rushing swiftly to its
inevitable doom. The vigour of it, told with an uncommon
book the number of whose
readers will probably be largely
increased by the time and cir-
cumstance of its publication.
Even to-day, when we read
and talk and think so much
about the Unspeakable One, I
doubt if many persons could
tell off-hand whether Yamen
was a country or a costume.
For their benefit let me hasten
to pass on my own superior
(if lately acquired) erudition.
Yamen, then, is, roughly
speaking, the left-hand strip of
the Arabian peninsula, fringing
the Red Sea; and this book
about it has been written by
Mr. G. WYMAN BURY, who
evidently enjoys unique know-
ledge of his subject. Arabia is
so far removed from most of
us in language and history and
customs that tales of it have
always the fantastic and unreal
atmosphere of another world.

without a hint of sentiment-

Not often has it been my
good fortune to find amusement
in publishers' announcements,
but I confess to grinning
broadly when I read Messrs.
HUTCHINSON's remarks upon
The Great Age. “To attempt,”
they say, “to introduce Shake:
speare into a novel would
seem to be daring, if not ||
courting disaster,” and then |
go on to assure us that Mr. J.
tive photographs (some of the best I have ever seen) are
evidence of this. One of the most attractive of them is
called “Return of Zaptieh to the Hukoomah at Menakah,”
a title (or I am much mistaken) that will mean less than
nothing to the majority. For its interpretation I must refer
you to the author himself. I should, by the way, explain that,
though seasoned here and there with an agreeable humour,
this is in no sense a volume of frivolous entertainment.
Mr. BURY writes as an expert for those who want expert
and practical information; the chatter and small talk of
travel is not in his scheme. But at a time when we are
all speculating as to the future of the Turk this record of
what he has done and left undone in a little known land
has a peculiar interest and value.
The Dark Tower (SECKER) is an unusual and, in many
ways, a remarkable work. Mr. F. BRETT YouNg has
already given evidence of being a writer a long way removed
from the ordinary ruck of novelists; this book will confirm
his reputation. At first, perhaps, the skill of his attack is
not altogether apparent. The opening chapters of the tale
C. SNAITH has succeeded where others would have failed,
because he has written a romance that teems with exciting
incident. I trust that my sense of humour is not perverted,
but I cannot help finding something extraordinarily laugh-
able in the commandeering of SHAKESPEARE by Mr. SNAITH,
and in the publishers' apologetic justification of his audacious
act. Granted, however, that the rash deed demanded some
apology, I say unhesitatingly that the poet could not have
fallen into more reverent hands than those of Mr. SNAITH.
The Bard is brought in as a sort of fairy godfather to a
boy and a maid who wander through the land in a frantic
attempt to escape from the clutches of the law. If I had
to propose a vote of sympathy with any of the characters
my choice would fall not on SHAKESPEARE but on QUEEN
ELIZABETH, for she has but few friends among modern
writers, and in this small company Mr. SNAITH is certainly
not enrolled. The author has put to his credit a tale full of
perils and hair-breadth escapes, and he has made an honest
and, on the whole, successful attempt to reproduce the
phraseology of the Elizabethan age; though I doubt if the
word “sinister,” which he works so hard, was really

heroes.” By the same reasoning there
are no liars in the German War Office.
It is said that, if things don't

For the present this weapon is

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XVII.
(From the KING OF ITALY.)
VERY DEAR BROTHER AND Most Power FUI, FRIEND,-
Prince voN BüLow has just left me after a most exhausting
interview, and in the few moments of calm which remain to
me before he returns for another visit (the ten thousandth,
I think, in one short week), I venture to solace myself by
writing direct to you. I want to tell you that this voN BüLow
of yours is a tremendous fellow and has fully earned any
reward you may think fit to offer him on the completion
—may the time be soon!—of his mission. Certainly, he
seizes time by every available forelock, and is never tired
of singing your praises and of pouring contempt on
those who are unfortunate enough to be at war with you.
England, he says, is so strictly blockaded that not an ounce
of food can be imported into that detestable country, and
both her absurd army and her incompetent fleet—I quote
his words—are on the point of surrendering to you. He
affirms that France is continuing to fight merely in
virtue of an arrangement made by you so as to enable you
to win a crushing victory at the gates of Paris, after which
you are to annex the whole country. As for Russia, she is
at the last gasp, and her whole Empire is shortly to be divided
up between yourself and the Emperor FRANCIs Joseph and
your glorious friend the Sultan of TURKEY.
Such are the stories which he relates to me every day.
If I venture to ask for details he hints that I am doubting
his princely word and produces letters from you in which
you confirm by anticipation all that he has said to me. For
the sake of a quiet life I do not push the controversy any
believe every word of his statements. The fact is that, on
aesthetic grounds, I cannot bear to see a German gentleman
in a state of anger. The convulsive movements of his limbs
and the deep purple tint which spreads over his face are
highly disagreeable to me. These symptoms do not, of
course, frighten me—nobody could possibly be frightened at
so painful a spectacle—but they produce a disgust which is
not favourable to the continuance of rational and friendly
intercourse. I content myself, therefore, with a cursory
mention of the bombardment of the Dardanelles, or of the
French campaign in Alsace, or of the battle of Przasnysz,
and as soon as poor BüLow begins to fume in the German
manner I declare the interview at an end.
At the same time I am bound to admit that your Ambas-
sador is a generous—I might almost say, an extravagantly
generous man. He doesn't confine himself to threatening
that Italy will have to be treated in the humane and justly
celebrated style applied to Belgium. He offers in the most
reckless and open-handed way to transfer to Italy various
provinces now in the possession of Austria. If Italy can
only make up her mind to join the German Powers she is
to have the Trentino and heaven knows what besides as the
price of her compliance. I note, however, that when I
broach these subjects with the Austrian Ambassador he
invariably changes the conversation and begins to talk
about such matters as the disgraceful ingratitude of Serbia
in fighting against those whose only desire is to confer
on her the blessings of Germanic civilisation. You see
we Italians know something of Austria and her fashion of
dealing with those whom she thinks she can bully, and we
are not likely to be taken in by soft words. Germany
offers us Austrian provinces, but is Germany in a position
to hand over the goods 2
For the moment we are satisfied to remain as we are.
The French, the Russians and the English are our good
friends. Why should we seek to harm them 2 Austria we
detest, and Germany—I am forced to say it—we distrust.
“Italy will tread with no uncertain steps the glorious path
of her destiny,” or “When the King gives the word Italy
will advance as one man where honour and necessity point
out the way.” By some such statement of policy we are
still guided. I leave you and BüLow to draw what comfort
you can from it. - -
Yours in fraternal friendship,
Victor EMMANUEL.

A very poignant story reaches Mr. Punch indirectly
from the trenches. A gallant Tommy, having received
from England an anonymous gift of socks, entered them at
once, for he was about to undertake a heavy march. He
was soon a prey to the most excruciating agony in the big
toe, and when, a mere cripple, he drew off his foot-gear at
the end of a terrible day, he discovered inside the toe of the
sock what had once been a piece of stiff writing-paper, now
reduced to pulp; and on it appeared in bold feminine hand
the almost illegible benediction: —“God bless the wearer
of this pair of socks!”
“To ARMY CoNTRActors.-I have for Sale, Horses, Rifles, Barbed

soldiers, who would “sooner sleep in thistles.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WATER WAR.
(With proper apologies to the Naval
Earpert of “Land and Water.”)
THE leading operations of the week
have been confined to the Dardanelles.
Events there have already proved—
contrary to the freely expressed opinions
of all other experts—the immense
superiority of forts over ships. The
people (like myself) who really know
had of course anticipated this, though
it may be necessary for me to explain
what I mean in a manner to be “under-
standed of the people.” It is true that
at the first sight the fleet appears to be
getting the best of it. But it must be
borne in mind that (as I have so often
had to point out in these Notes) war is
not primarily a matter of ships or guns
or men, but of psychology. I take off
my hat to that word—it has -
been a good friend to me.
It must be remembered,
and it cannot be too insist-
ently repeated, that psycho-
logically almost every victory
is a defeat. Unfortunately
that is a doctrine that is very
comforting to the losing side,
but there is no use blinking
the fact. The difficulty has
always been to explain why.
When the Monmouth and the
Good Hope went to their
doom off the South Pacific
Coast I said at the time (as
you will remember) that this
was really—if you turn it
upside down and inside out
according to the best psycho-
logical methods—a victory
for our fleet, just as the enemy's ap-
parent defeat in the Bight of Heligoland
was a moral triumph for TIRPitz. I
need not, perhaps, go into all that now,
for it is pretty complicated, nor into
my other brilliant thesis, that the more
food Germany gets the sooner the war
will end. But I may say that as surely
as we are only now recovering from
our crushing reverses at Waterloo and
Trafalgar, the moment when we occupy
Constantinople will be a fit occasion for
national humiliation.
Why should these things be? I know
it is a little difficult. On land it is a
simple thing to say that when a division
has been exterminated it has suffered a
defeat. But I have never been able to
discover about land operations that
margin of psychology which has so
curious a bearing on naval operations.
Nautically speaking, the effect of Sea
Power is always mysterious. The best

wards. The public cannot envisage
that a destroyer aimlessly tossing on
the surface of the sea, seemingly idle,
miles and miles from anywhere in par-
ticular, may at that very moment be
altering for good and all the history of
the world. NApoleoN never grasped
that fact, possibly because destroyers
were unknown in his day. The public
blindly insists upon the significance of
the mere fighting at sea. It has never
been able to grasp that gunnery is of
secondary importance, speed is only
relative, torpedoes are only potentially
effective. The only true way in which
a fleet can make its power felt is by
just moving about on the horizon,
highly charged with psychology. Bat-
tles are mere unavoidable excrescences,
and a ship at the bottom of the
of throwing an adhesive harpoon at the
periscope is a novel idea to me. I shall
have to consider it. (2) The idea is per-
fect in theory, but the chances of a
merchant vessel being attacked by a
submarine are not more than one in
a thousand, whereas the cost of your
apparatus would be quite one in a
hundred, and the size of it about one
in ten, while the colour and shape of
it would have to be one in five. It
seems hardly worth while.
THE HAPPY WARRIORS.
As here I toil amid the slums,
On high above the dingy street,
To jog my jaded ear there comes
The rub-a-dub of distant drums,
The pit-a-pat of hurrying feet;
North Sea may in its negative capacity
be unostentatiously exercising a terrific
force upon the enemy. Things are not
what they seem, and there is no use
pretending that they are.
(It will be understood that one of my
main ideas in writing in this way is to
avoid the Censor. e never interferes
with my work.)
All these concise facts have of course
a direct bearing on the duration of the
War. Let us get away from all doc-
trinaire conclusions; let us reverse all
assumptions. If we can make it our
main object to see that Germany gets
all the food she can possibly use, the
British Navy—always provided that it
does not win a victory in the meantime
—can conclude the War in six months.
To return to the Dardanelles. There
is one more point that calls for special
mention. My readers should note that
the “Narrows" are situated at the
widest parts of the Straits.

FROM THE BACK OF THE FRONT.
WE are coming to the end of a long
journey. The end is Victoria, and the
next trip begins after four days. Some
of us are taking lessons in English
already, and Smithson has picked up
a Guide to London in this town, so we
ought to get on all right.
In the meantime we are finishing
the first lap, as we began it, well to the
back of all the fronts in the neighbour-
hood, learning the inner nature of the
machine gun. In the trenches all you
know about an m.g. is that it looks
like a lump of mud with handles stuck
on, and that its modus operandi is to
wake up about 2 A.M., say pop-pop-pop,
go to sleep again, and clear off in the
morning just before the shells come
along.
On closer acquaintance, machine guns
have more in them than that. On
account of these Germans I can't tell
you everything about them, but the
rough idea is that the m.g. is an
accumulation of any number of odd-
shaped bits which jam when you rotate

that no Bosch could possibly have
taken a counter-offensive against such
an object. Not even a baby-killer would

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE USE OF THE RIFLE.
I HAVE developed quite a martial
bearing lately, and this has led to a
rumour that I am seeking promotion.
This rumour appears to have reached
our Company Commander. He found
me in the canteen the other night and
asked me if I could instruct a squad in
the use of the rifle. I said, “Yes, Sir.”
One always says “Yes, Sir '' in the
army to an officer when he asks if you
can do anything. He may take your word
for it, in which case you get credit easily.
He may pursue the matter further, and
then you have to explain that you
thought that he meant something else
or trust to his putting down your an-
swer to an excess of optimism. There
is no punishment in the King's Regu-
lations for optimism. My Company
Commander pursued the matter further.
He improvised a squad consisting of two
Platoon Commanders, one Sergeant-
major, two Section Commanders, one
Private and himself. On his instructions
the Sergeant-major dumped a rifle in
my hands. I was told that my squad
consisted of recruits and knew nothing
and that I was to instruct them in the
use of the rifle.
I admit that I was nervous. I didn't
mind the squad so much, though the
Sergeant-major fell in with an annoying
grin on his face. It was the rifle that
put me off; I have felt the same sen-
sation when a female relative has un-
expectedly handed a baby to me, and
I believe that I nursed that rifle in
somewhat the same way. It seemed
to have a peevish look as though it
knew that I was going to say slanderous
things about it. However, I pulled
myself together and assumed as nearly
as possible the Sergeant-major's air
and began. -
“Gentlemen—I should say—Squad.
Strictly speaking, I shouldn't have
addressed you as ‘Gentlemen,' you
being recruits, though personally I see
no reason why the courtesies of life
should be disregarded even in the army,
but I know certain people hold a
different opinion.”
I glanced at the Sergeant-major to
see if he had grasped my point, but he
hadn't properly finished his original
grin, so I said, “No laughing in the
ranks,” and that brought his face into
the normal with a jerk. This restored
my confidence, and I felt that I should
get through all right if I didn't have
to particularise too minutely about the
weapon, and I went on, “Now I'm
going to instruct you in the use of the
rifle. You're only recruits, so you don't
know anything about it; I'm instructing
you, and you've got to believe what I
that. These are little things, but if you
remember them you won't — forget
them.
“Now this is a rifle. As you're re-
cruits, you haven't seen one before and
it may be a long time before you see
one again. Look at it well so that if
you should happen to meet one you
will recognise it. The rifle is primarily
used for drilling purposes. It can be
carried in various positions which I
won't trouble you about now. Its
primary object is to accustom the
soldier to carrying heavy weights and
to restrain the exuberance of his spirits.
You want to be careful how you carry it
or you'll become a nuisance to your
neighbours and an expense to your
countly. Its secondary object is to
shoot at an enemy, if you happen to
meet one and somebody has remem-
bered to issue the cartridges. You will
notice that the rifle has two ends.
This is the butt end and this is —the
other end. You want to remember
this, as if you mistake the ends you
may do unintentional damage. It is
mostly held by the butt end, except
when clubbing an enemy or other un-
desirable person. “Clubbing” is not
recommended. If you hit the enemy
you may strain the rifle; if you miss
him you'll probably strain your arms.
“To load the riſle you pull this thing
down"—I pulled at what I subse-
quently discovered to be the trigger
guard, but nothing happened. I then
tried another likely - looking piece of
metal and to my gratification this gave
way and disclosed a hole. I at once
showed this hole to my squad and
continued—
“You will observe that this part of
the rifle, which is known as the barrel,
has a hole at each end. You put your
cartridge in this end, and, if your rifle
is well constructed, the bullet comes
out the other end. Of course the rifle
won't as a general rule fire itself; you
have to help it. You do this by pulling
the trigger. This protuberance here
is technically called the trigger. It's
important that you should know this
because, if you don't know the trigger,
you can't be expected to pull it and
your rifle as often as not won't go off.
You'll look silly if your comrades are
shooting Germans like rabbits and you
don't get one through not finding the
trigger. -
“The rifle may be fired standing,
sitting, kneeling or lying down, but in
no other positions. You should re-
member this so as not to make stupid
mistakes. And you want to be careful
which way your rifle is pointing when
it goes off. It's best to point it in the
direction of the enemy, otherwise the

not so interesting to shoot at as live
enemics, but they have the merit of not
being able to shoot back. To each
target there is a marker. If the marker
dislikes you he will signal “miss"

back for further instruction in aiming.
You ought to be careful to hit the right ||
target. If you get a bull on the
wrong target it may be scorcd up to
the man next to you and he will thus
obtain an unfair advantage.
“Well, then, that's the liſle and how
to use it. I haven't given it to you
exactly in the words of the book, be-
cause it isn't expressed very clearly
there and, being recruits, you mightn't
understand it all. You can read
what it says in the book at any time
and you don't need me to repeat it
to you. Now, don't say you haven't

Of course you haven't learnt
everything about every rifle—nobody
has. Rifles are like women and each
one has its own little idiosyncrasies.
The best rifles have a kind of hold-all
in the butt where you carry your
cigarettes and matches on active service
and, if there's any room left, a cleaning
outfit. This rifle is one of the simpler
kind and doesn't seem to have such a
thing about it. If it has, I haven't
touched the right spring to open it, but
then I'm not accustomed to handling
second-rate goods. -
“Now you'd better each go through
what I've told you and I'll correct you
when you're wrong.”
The rumour of my promotion is still
unconfirmed, but I gather this is due
to red tape or jealousy.

PESTS.
REPORTs from the Continent state
that the soil of the whole of Belgium
and part of France has been devastated
by hordes of maggots, insects, mealy
bugs, weevils, parasites, lice and slugs;
and that scabs, blight and fungi lie
thickly everywhere, especially where
there is little light and a lack of proper
means of ventilation. The following
list, though by no means complete,
may be found useful:—
GERMAN BLIGHT.-The bacteria pro-
ducing this blight have a most remark-
able culture. The blight destroys
whatever it touches. A Joffre Sprayer,
75 millimetre nozzle, has been found
to be most efficacious and is keeping
the blight well under. Another method
is to take some cuttings of the British
oak and place them in trenches; these
soon begin to shoot, and not only form
an effective barrier but drive back
the “blighters,” as these devastating
organisms are called.
THE KAISER PEst.—This preys every-
where. It is known by its bleeding
heart and an insinuating proboscis
It has an inflated head and is closely
related to the Willy Bug. It likes a
place in the sun or any strong light,
and seems to thrive in close proximity
to the Krupp plant. The only treat-
ment for this loathsome pest is sulphur
fumes, and a constant temperature of
100° C.
| The KIEL SLUG.—This belongs to
the order of Infanticidae. Very few
specimens have been seen, and these
have at once succumbed to the applica-
tion of a brush with British tar. The
very excellent spirits of salts brought
out by the firm Jellicoe has a para-
lysing effect upon this slug.
THE ZEPPELIN Moth.—From its size
this insect appears more harmful than
it really is. It has been known to drop
its eggs on and destroy cabbages. Many
growers remove their young plants to
cellars when they see this moth hover-
ing about, as it seems to have an
especial liking for anything young and
tender.
THE SPY GLowworm.—This has been
observed on the East Coast. It has a
causes it to move about quickly. After
dark it emits a bright light, and this
attracts the Zeppelin moth. Any good
copper preparation will arrest this evil.
THE SNIPER MAGGot. — This is a
nocturnal feeding grub and difficult to
locate. Some are spotted and some
are not. The spotted variety does not
live long. The only remedy is to pick
off each one when located and to be
very careful when potting.

NotABLE PROTESTs.
MR. GEORGE LAMBTon's eloquent
plea on behalf of the trainers in last
Wednesday's Times has brought us a
great budget of letters in support of
his views, from which we select the
following:—
AN ILLUMINATING CoMPARISON.
SIR,--Mr. LAMBTON has not in my
opinion made enough of the appalling
fact that no fewer than 174 trainers
are likely to suffer seriously from any
attempt to close down horse-racing.
Have any of your readers taken the
trouble to work out these figures? I
have done so, and may point out that
they represent something like one in
1,000 of our total casualties up to date,
or one-tenth per cent. Comment is
needless.
I am, Sir, Yours faithfully,
AR1THMETICUs.
The BIAMELEss “Dookie.”
DEAR SIR,--Mr. LAMBTox's letter is
excellent so far as it gces, but it does
not go anywhere near far enough. He
speaks of the hardships of trainers, but
he says nothing of the terrible privations
likely to be inflicted on other classes of
industrious and highly intelligent citi-
informed by a Metropolitan magistrate
that in the neighbourhood of Clapham
Junction there exists a huge colony of
bookmakers, who have chosen that
neighbourhood because of its central
position and facilities for communica-
tion. This fact indicates not only intel-
ligence but a certain capacity for self-
sacrifice, since no one would live near
Clapham Junction for the amenities of
the landscape. These men, as I have
said, are to be reckoned not in scores,
like trainers, but in thousands. They
are extraordinarily interesting as types
of a high civilisation, and as for their
manners and conversation I can confi-
dently appeal to those who have tra-
velled in the train with them for confirm-
ation of my estimate. To their liberality
I can testify from personal experience.
With my own eyes I saw one of them
disburse a sovereign to a total stranger
who had correctly “spotted” the knave
in the three-card trick. Personally I
was less fortunate, but that may have
been due to my shortsightedness, which
is hereditary in our family.

careful investigation I have come
to the conclusion that the course

these trades. And what of the brave
fellows whose special function it is

time somewhere. (This sarcastically
to himself.)
Suddenly one broke away from group
at doorway; entered House; seated
himself for a moment on front bench
below Gangway; rising, moved a count
and straightway bolted. -
It was here that happened what in
diplomatic language is sometimes
alluded to as “a regrettable incident.”
In accordance with ordinary procedure
REEs, interrupted by a count, was
obliged to resumo his seat, while for
space of two minutes the bells signalled
the motion through all the rooms
and corridors. Casabianca, M.P., the
flames from the burning deck meta-
phorically creeping nearer, sat motion-
less on Treasury Bench. Not so REEs.
Anxiously watching the door and find-
ing none came in to “make a House,”
he, before the two minutes' interval
elapsed, fled.
This unchivalrous desertion of an
audience that had stood by him to the
last, may, as suggested, have wounded
an honest breast. Casabianca made no
sign. He was there to do his duty and
there remained.
Task of DEPUTY-SPEARER thus be-
came an easy one. Itising with inten-
tion to discover whether the statutory
quorum of forty Members was present
he fixed his eye on the unmurmuring
“One,” he counted. Then, after al-
most imperceptible pause, added, “The
House will now adjourn.”
Which it (meaning Casabianca) forth-
with did.
Business done.—A good deal, in-
cluding introduction of Bill to amend
Defence of the Realm Act. “Probably the
most drastic measure ever submitted to
the House of Commons,” said BonAR
LAw. But he offered no opposition,
leaving responsibility with Government.

dence of position of affairs in time of

ance of bench by exit door in central

Alert, imperative, it is his business to
challenge any member of the Party
attempting to pass out. Where was
he going to ? When would he be
back? Certainly must be on the spot
when bell sounded for pending division.
To-day and on all days since session
was resumed ro division has been cz-
pected. Members accordingly are free
to come and go at their own sweet will.
Only once was a division so much as
threatened. It happened a fortnight
ago, when Labour Members, thinking
it time they reminded their constitu-
ents of continued existence, moved an
amendment on question of food prices
ment in that connection. Instantly
old familiar ways were returned to.
The Whip reappeared on sentry duty
at the doorway. Summonses were
dispatched, by telephone and special
messenger, to errant Members de-
manding their instant return to
House. It was a wholesome whiff of
a familiar breeze, usefully showing that,
though peace reigned, powder was kept
dry. As it happened threatened division
was averted, and Whip's bench by door-
way resumed deserted appearance it
presents to-night. -

PORTSMOUTH BELLS.
A LAzY sea came washing in
Right through the Harbour mouth,
Where grey and silent, half asleep,
The lords of all the oceans keep,
West, East, and North and South.
The Summer sun spun cloth of gold
Upon the twinkling sea,
And little t b.d.'s lay close,
Stern near to stern and nose to nose,
And slumbered peacefully.
Oh, bells of Portsmouth Town,
Oh, bells of Portsmouth Town,
You rang of peace upon the seas
Before the leaves turned brown.
A greyish sea goes sweeping in
13eyond the boom to-day;
The Harbour is a cold, clear space,
For far beyond the Solent's race
The grey-flanked cruisers play.
For it's ob the long, long night up

The sullen twilit day,
Where Portsmouth men cruise up and

And all alone in Portsmouth Town
Are women left to pray.

BETES NOIRES.
WE were indulging in one of the
minor—or possibly major—pleasures
of life. We were discussing the kind
of people we most disliked. I don't
mean the real criminals, such as those
cabinet - makers who construct, and
those furniture-dealers who sell, chests
of drawers in which the drawers stick.
They are miscreants for whom there
should be government machinery of
punishment. I mean the people who
mean well—always a poisonous class
—but irritate subtly and in such a way
that you can't hit back: the people,
for example, who take one of your own
pet stories, begin to tell it to you and
won't stop even when you say that
you know it. People like that, and
people who are so polite that they
make ordinary decent manners appear
brutish by contrast; and people who
continually ask you if you know such
and such a celebrity and seem shocked
if you don't; and people who want to
know if you are doing anything on
Friday fortnight; and people who could
have done such and such a thing for
you if you had only asked them three
minutes sooner.
Those are the kind of people I mean,
and we had each named one variety

A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT.
THE question was, how to break it
to her father.
“Dad is always very difficult about
it,” said Angela pensively. An un-
worthy suspicion flitted through my
mind, but fortunately her next words
dispelled it. a. - -
“I was thinking,” she went on, “of
what happened when Marjorie got en-
gaged last July, and Alice in April, and
Muriel the Christmas before. . They
were three awfully nice men and we
were frightfully keen on them. I re-
member how we watched them each
time from behind the curtains of the
old nursery window as they walked up
the drive, and how extremely correct
and nervous they looked. The same
things happened on all three occasions.
First they rang the bell, very gently.
Then Parsons let them in, and we
heard them from the first landing ask
if the Admiral was at home. Then they
had to wait for about ten minutes in
the hall while Dad got ready for them
in the library.”. *
“Ah!” I murmured with a shiver.
“It must have been rather trying
work waiting; at any rate, they seemed
to fidget and wander round a good deal.
Then Dad saw them in the library.
This always took about twenty minutes.
And then they came ‘out again, and
Parsons opened the door for them, and
they went away looking ” She
paused and sighed.
“Yes,” I said anxiously, “looking—?”
“Absolutely crumpled,” she replied.
“But each time of course Dad relented
afterwards. You se2, they were all
three Service men and quite eligible.”
“And I am only a special constable,”
I said bitterly. . . .
“Poor old boy! It isn't your fault,”
said Angela; “we all know you tried
to get into the army, but couldn't pass
the sight test.” -
“On the other hand,” I continued a
little more hopefully, “I suppose I'm
all right from the money point of view
and all that sort of thing. In fact, I
may say, Angela, without boasting that
I can afford to regard even the present
price of coal with equanimity.”
“That will certainly be a distinct
point in your favour,” said Angela.
At half-past six on the following
evening I called to see the Admiral.
Parsons relieved me of my hat and
coat with the grave sympathy of a
priest preparing a victim for the altar.
“The Admiral will see you directly,
Sir," he said kindly, “if you will wait
a few minutes. He is engaged at
present.”
“It's raining hard outside, Parsons,”
“Yes, Sir, but it will be over pres-
ently, like all our troubles, Sir.”
As he was going out an idea seemed
to strike him. “You will pardon my
suggesting it, Sir,” he said in a low
voice, “but sometimes a small glass of
liqueur brandy is helpful; it has a very
buoyant effect, Sir.” : -
“No, thank you, Parsons,” I an-
swered, “I will wait till aſter dinner.”
It was a quarter-of-an-hour before
the Admiral was ready for me. As
I entered the library and encountered
his gaze I almost regretted for one
brief moment that I had not ac-
cepted Parsons' offer of a stiffener.
Though small in stature the Admiral
has an eye of the destroyer pattern.
When he steers it suddenly in your
direction you realise at once that
Britain rules the waves; you also ex-
perience an unpleasant sinking sensa-
tion. I decided to engage without
delay. “Good evening, Admiral,” "I
said: “I have called ; :
“Sit down, Sir, pray sit down,” he
interrupted. I sat down.
“Now what can I do for you?” he
demanded grimly. -
I headed straight for his bows. “I
have called,” I repeated, “as an official
of the local special constabulary to
ask why you persistently disregard one
of the most important police regula-
tions recently issued to all inhabitants
of this district.” .** -
“What the devil do you mean?” he
snapped. - * >
“Evening after evening,” I said,
“your windows.are a blaze of light.
Yet you have been ordered to darken
every aperture. Why haven't you had
them fitted with green blinds?"
“Because I don't choose to,”
growled. - -
“I’m surprised at you; a man of
your profession should understand the
meaning of discipline. But that is not
all. The night before last I detailed
two of your keepers for duty as special
constables from 1 to 5 A.M. They failed
to put in an appearance, and pleaded
in excuse that you wouldn't let them
off their turn in the covers. Is that
correct 2"; * !
This shot evidently got him in his
boilers. “How am I to deal with
poachers if I can't employ my
keepers?” he asked.
“That,” I said, “is your concern, not
ours. It seems to me, Admiral, that
you have got yourself into an extremely
awkward corner. Of course, though,
they may let you off with a fine.”
“You don't mean to say,” he ex-
claimed, “that your people are going
to take proceedings against me? Why,
man, I was on the Bench myself till
he
“We shall have to consider the
matter,” I replied. “The next point I
have to bring to your notice is the
conduct of your youngest daughter. I
have met her several times lately or
“So I believe,” he said drily.
4 : riding her bicycle on the foot-
path after lighting-up time without a
lamp; a double misdemeanour, you
understand. So far she has on each
occasion been merely cautioned not to
do it again, but it is my duty to warn
you that there are limits to the patience
even of a special constable.”
“Is that all?” he asked. He was
now listing heavily to port.
“By no means, but I will only
mention one thing more this evening,
I hear on trustworthy authority that
you have been aiding and abetting your
chauffeur, John Martin, in evading the
law' which requires him to have his
child vaccinated before the age of six
months, or lodge a conscientious ob-
jection to the operation. So far he has
done neither, and he has only two days
to run. John Martin is reported to
have said that you said it would be all
right, and you would see him through.
It will probably cost you a considerable
sum to do so."
“I didn't know your jurisdiction
extended to vaccination,” said the
Admiral in a dull voice.
• Nor did I, but I wasn't going to
admit it. “Our powers are practically
unlimited,” I said.
He pondered for a minute or so, and
I noted with satisfaction that he was
sinking visibly by the head. “What
the deuce am I to do about it all?” he
asked at length.
“The best - thing you can do,
Admiral,” I said, “is to allow your
prospective son-in-law to tow you into
port. I daresay I can put it all straight
for you.”
“How did you manage it?” asked
Angela at about 10.30.
But I refused to give the Admiral
away.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
ONE of the pleasantest of Mr. MAURICE HEwleTT's early
short stories concerns, I remember, the tribulations of a
man who, having endured torments for the sake of his lady-
love, found, when rewarded by her hand, that fulfilment
was not so much to his taste as hopeless worship. I am
reminded of this because the same author's latest book,
A Lovers' Tale (WARD, Lock), is to some extent an
amplification of this theme. Cormac, the hero—the story
is laid in the Iceland of Viking times—loved Stangerd; nay
more, being a skald, he gave free rein to a habit of dropping
into indifferent poetry (like Silas Wegg) about her on all occa-
sions. Which was ſun enough for Cormac, not unpleasing to
Stangerd, but simply infuriating to her father and relations.
One rather feels for them. However, when various folk had
set themselves, with axes and other arguments, to regulate
the situation, the pair were formally betrothed, according
to market rates, and with everything in order. Whereupon
Cormac blew hot and cold, threw some harsh words at his
unfortunate fiancée, and finally rode away, leaving her to
become the bride of an elderly lover who at least knew his
own mind. This is the matter of the tale which, as Mr.
HEWLETT tells us in a note, is taken by him from an old
Saga. He has re-dressed it well enough, with a direct
simplicity of style very apt and becoming. But for all that
I am bound to say I like him better when he makes up his
own lovers and their tales. I should add that the book has
been admirably illustrated with pictures of those large and
heavy-browed supermen of whom that other MAURICE,

that they may find their nation described as decadent at the
very least. I have never before found the seeing of myself
as others see me so comfortable a process; whenever the
author spoke poorly of me, I could always say to myself,
“Ah, but he can't think that now !” Whenever, on the
other hand, he spoke well of me I felt how right he was
shown to be. Even before last August I already appeared
to him to be a sportsman and a gentleman, and to have a
baffling exterior suggestive of something indefinable bellind.
Upon consideration, he decided that something to be a
rotten core, my constant habit of laughing having deceived
him into suspecting a frivolous indifference to all the things

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The only thing that I didn't admire about Ited Hair
(METHUEN) was the publisher's puff, describing it as a book
“with a particular appeal to everybody who was ever
called carrots or ginger.” What I mean is, if this system
of specialisation in literature is to be continued, why not
“Fiction for the Freckled,” or “Love-Lyrics of the Left-
handed"? And anyhow Mr. Robert HALIFAx has written
a story that stands in no need of any such appeal. Since
he wrote A Whistling Woman I have always taken a very
special pleasure in his work. Red Hair shows him with
the same delicious humour sparkling upon a sombre back-
ground of mean circumstance, the same sympathy (perhaps
a little nearer to sentiment than it used to be) and the same
sureness of character-drawing. As with his other books, this
is more a collection of happenings in one London neigh-
bourhood than an ordered and arranged novel. There is
little except geographical association between the episode
of Kate Whirl's love-affair and that of Mr. Bastable's eject-
ment campaign for defaulting tenants. In this Islington
district indeed Mr. HALIFAx finds every variety of material,
from farce to the most - -
searching and poignant
pathos. His dialogue is
(there is no other ex-l.
pression for it) a fair
treat. I defy you to read
Mrs. Gundy, for example,
unmoved by laughter;
Mrs. Gundy, whose ora-
torical flights were ham-
pered by ill-fitting front
teeth and an internal
malaise which compelled
her to the frequent
apology of “Manners!"
Then turn from this to
the affair of the lodger's
mother, so human and
direct in its appeal; o:
to the whole treatment
of Mr. Whirl, a beauti-
fully-drawn character;
and you will understand
why I venture to put Mr. Halifax at the head of ourſ
mean street realists.
In Russia and the World (CASSELL) Mr. STEPHEN GRAHAM
tells us much of our Eastern Allies, whom he knows and
loves as friends, which it is good and heartening for us to
know. If the book has the scrappiness inherent in detached
articles written on the march, it has also the freshness of
unstudied impressions conveyed at random by a sincere
observer. Mr. GRAHAM had the first news of war from a
mounted courier spurring through a Cossack village on the
Mongolian frontier, crying “War! War !” and trailing a
blood-red flag. The men of the village were all eagerness
to go, but none had the faintest notion as to who was the
enemy. China 2 Japan 2 England 2 Verily a ready-made
sermon for pacifists' Only some days after came an
approximate version of the truth. Friendliness, simplicity,
obstinate courage, a deep mystical piety—those charac-
teristics Mr. GRAHAM finds pre-eminently in the Russian
common soldier. Of course there's a reverse to the medal
—but the medal itself is of pure gold. He gives a general
impression of men fighting splendidly but without malice.
You get a confirmation of what is perhaps the most
dastardly of all the German systematised villainies—the
teaching of their soldiery that the Russians would torture
certain unhappiness.

again, you find the very methodically organised loot, the
loaded plunder waggons in long columns creeping Kultur-
wards; and such imaginative pleasantries as the cutting of
a famous Madonna out of her ikon frame and the substitu-
tion of the KAISER. When our author turns from impres-
sions to reflections he is, perhaps, less happy. Much may
be forgiven to a maker of books on so arduous a trek. But
there's a sort of Pleasant-Sunday-Afternoon air about the
later chapters that seems out of keeping with the rest.
Still a welcome and informing work.
An exasperating person, Robert MacWhinnie, one of those
strong, patient, big-souled men who go about asking for
trouble and then bear up against it bravely. There were
at least a dozen easy ways in which he could have avoided
the tragedy which spoiled ten years of his life, and he
deliberately selected the course which involved the most
And even as regards the professional
Tº side of his life he showed
no better judgment. He
was the owner of en-
gineering works on the
Thames, and had the
misfortune to have a
brother who was a pro-
fessional agitator. Did
he say to him, “Thomas,
old lad, blood is thicker
than water and all that,
but business is business.
Much obliged if you
wouldn't come round
every day urging my
men to strike?” No,
he gave Thomas the run
of the place, with the
natural results. You can-
not sympathise with a
man like that. Pity is
wasted. The Robert
- Mac Wh innie type of
man could not turn round without bumping into himself.
It is true that Mr. ANDREw SouTAR ends Charity Corner
(CASSELL) on a note of optimism (“‘Yesterday's gone.'
He stooped and kissed her. “And thus—thus we await,
to-morrow '"), but one knows perfectly well that Robert's
troubles are not ended. Frankly he irritated me. Towards
Mr. SouTAR my feelings are more mixed. He has tried to
write a bigger book than he has it in him to write, and he
has failed. But whether he is to be blamed for having
failed, or praised for having made a plucky attempt, to soar
above his limitations, I do not know. The problem is one
which must exercise the mind of every critic who wishes to
be fair. And as I wish to be very fair I will confess that
my verdict on Charity Corner may have been influenced by
the fact that one of the characters uses expressions like
“Hoots, hinny!" Constitutionally I am incapable of stand-
ing that kind of thing. -
The following tribute to the value of a recent work on
“Pulpit and Platform Oratory” seems worthy of a wider
publicity:— -

TO ENGLISH GENTLEMEN AT HOME.
UNDER the heavy shadow of War's eclipse
None asks of you to wear a shroud of gloom,
To let the laughter fade upon your lips,
Or simulate an air of tragic doom.
Out in the trenches yonder, where they die
For love of country and our common birth,
There least of all they cast a jealous eye
Upon the healing medicine of mirth.
Light hearts—they know it well—we too must wear
If we would keep our courage high and fain;
Must find in nature's cure new strength to bear
With smiling face the burden and the pain.
But there's a limit fixed by decent pride.
The nations watch us close; they seek a test
To prove us, whether, when our hearts are tried,
We take this War in earnest or in jest.
And, if on carnival and noisy rout
You waste your spirit in the nations' sight,
Among our friends shall be mistrust and doubt,
And weary foes be heartened for the fight.
And something to yourselves you surely owe.
Imagination may not be your forte—
To see as others see you—yet I know
You love your heritage of English sport.
And under English eyes, slow to forget,
That ancient trust is yours to keep or break;
And in your hands, by old tradition set,
The name of English sportsmen lies at stake.
O. S.
RAISING THE WIND.
THERE is little doubt that our Recruiting Band has done
yeoman service at our Thursday evening Recruiting Cam-
paigns, and it would do even better if it only possessed a
bass tuba. We have lots of bandsmen who play top and
middle music, but only one (a euphonium) who plays
ground-floor music. This is scarcely surprising when you
come to think that low notes are much more expensive to
produce than high ones. You can buy a very good cornet
for two pounds, but in order to produce exactly the same
notes as the cornet a few feet lower you have to invest in a
bass tuba that may cost you six times as much.
All this was admirably explained by Mr. Fogge (the
bandmaster), who one evening, when the Overture to
William Tell had been rendered without any bass at all
(owing to the indisposition of the euphonium), mounted the
plinth of the drinking-fountain round which our campaign
rages, and asked “our public-spirited fellow-townsmen "
for more practical support for the band. In a powerful
peroration he pointed out the increasing need for a bass
tuba, and pleaded with a possible plilanthropist in the
crowd to earn his country's undying gratitude by supplying
the deficiency.
Unfortunately, in the report of the proceedings which
appeared in The Poppleton Argus, “tuba" was spelt
“tuber,” with the result that the Vicar, who goes in for
market-gardening on an extended scale, sent to the band's
headquarters the largest potato he could find.
This was literally the only fruit of Mr. Fogge's stirring
appeal, and finally it devolved on me (I am only the hon.
treasurer of the band, not an executant) to devise some
of our senior curate to lecture on John BUNYAN would, I
felt sure, merely defeat my object. Happily I saw in The
Times what I considered to be a highly novel and ingenious
method of making an appeal for charity. I therefore
despatched to the office of The Argus the following para-
graph: “Will every “Huggins' in Poppleton join together
to provide an urgently requircd instrun ent for our Recruit-
ing Band 2 Write, etc., etc.”
This, I thought, would be sure to attract the necessary
money, as Huggins is the name in Poppleton, just as Rees
or Jenkins is in Swansea. Judge, then, of my annoyance
when, on opening the paper, I found that the wretched
printer had made my advertisement read, “Will every
Juggins, etc., etc.” I need scarcely say that the result was
nil; though one dear old lady (who apologised for her
name being Brigginshaw and not Juggins), having misin-
terpreted my appeal, forwarded me a Surgical Aid letter.
My failure was all the more galling since there was a
similar notice in the paper asking all the “Jemimas" of
the neighbourhood to subscribe towards the purchase of
cigars for all our Tommies who didn't like cigarettes. The
notion was obviously not so novel as I had imagined it.
Anyhow, I subsequently learned that the “Jemima" money
subscribed would have been sufficient to buy a bass tuba,
a tenor trombone and the best part of a French horn. I
wanted to try again by addressing my appeal to all the
“Williams" and “Johns,” but Mr. Fogge said, No; all the
Williams and Johns had already been bled for Christmas
crackers for the Canadians. He said we didn't want a bass
tuba as badly as all that.
Then one day a bright idea struck me. I devised another
appeal, and took it down by hand myself to the office of
The Argus. To ensure its being correctly printed I offered
them double rates to be allowed to see a proof of it.
They told me such a course was not usual. I told them
that their mistakes were also somewhat out of the ordinary,
and I eventually got my way. The appeal was worded:—
“Will all our townsfolk who are relatives (however
distant) of, or connected by marriage (however remotely)
with, persons of rank or title, contribute to a fund now
being raised to provide our Recruiting Band with a much-
needed bass tuba? A list of all subscribers, together with
the names of their relatives or connections, will be duly
published in these columns. Write, etc., etc.”
The success of my appeal was instantaneous. We could
have bought a large proportion of the London Symphony
Orchestra with the proceeds. Not only did we purchase
the biggest, bassest, most sonorous tuba that money could
command, but we had sufficient funds in hand to engage
the services of a tubaist to play it—a desideratum that had
previously been overlooked. We are now doing great
business with our band, and I do not hesitate to say that
if Lord KitchENER succeeds in getting all the recruits he
wants it will be largely due to the generosity of 89 of his
second-cousins thrice removed, 57 connexions-by-marriage
of Sir John FRENCH, and 142 step-nephews-in-law of His
local Grace the Duke of Podmore and Lumpton.
The Punishment Fits the Crime.
“Cross-examined, he said he had becn caned before for reading
thrashy literature.”
“The Earl of Crewe wrote:– Is this ' (racing)" or is it not con-
ducive to the prosecution of the war to a successful end ? If it is, it
is desirable ; if it is not, it is undesirable. If it is neither, from the
public standpoint it is immaterial.’”—Daily Telegraph. -
Either Lord CREw E wrote this or he did not. If he did,
he should read our book on the Included Middle ; if he did
not write it, he should demand an apology. If he neither
other means of obtaining the money. To accept the offer
did nor didn't—well, it is immaterial.

A MORAL SCOOP.
[“The day when news was the thing
seems to be passing; papers now vie one
with the other with free insurance and ad-
vertisement schemes; thousand-pound prizes
for photography and vegetables . . . almost
everything except the news.”
The Newspaper World.]
By its existing insurance scheme, its
war-poetry contest, and its generously
endowed laundry competition, The
Daily Boom already shows its solicitude
for life and limb and its interest in
the aesthetic and industrial pursuits of
the people. By way of a change
it launches to-day a mammoth prize
offer of immense moral significance.
The Daily Boom has long felt that
it might perhaps take some part in the
encouragement of moral effort among
all classes, irrespective of creed, party,
position, taste or any other distinc-
tion. The management has therefore
promulgated this new and amazing
competition.
Every person anxious to add to his
finances by improving his character
should enter to-day, his first step
usual newsagent for the regular delivery
of The Daily Boom at his house.
A sum of £50,000 (Fifty Thousand
Pounds) has been set aside by The
Daily Boom, from which substantial
money prizes will be distributed among
certified regular readers for:—
(1) The finest personal moral deed of
the week.
(2) The noblest personal moral
achievement of the (calendar)
month.
(3) The most glorious personal moral
triumph of the half-year end-
ing on Michaelmas Day.
This is the most colossal inducement
to the formation of noble character that
the world has ever known.
In this competition the Editor's de-
cision is final, whatever it may be in
regard to political programmes and
other matters.
Whether it be the servant-girl who
tells of her free and uninvited confes-
sion to breaking the best teapot, or the

to leave a written order with your

be wasted.
Rewards will also be given to the
street newsvendors who supply the
lucky prize-winners. Each will re-
ceive one clean collar and a packet of
voice jujubes per week for life.

should have had some difficulty in

not been for this move to the area
of more serious activities.
Our first performance upon land-
ing in France was to whistle “The
Ma: seillaise,” an act of friendship
and courtesy long premeditated in ||
the ranks. This created a deep
impression, but mostly among our-
selves. In fact all of us were a
little disappointed at the lack of
enthusiasm upon our arrival; we
had expected the inhabitants to
turn out en masse (or bloc) and
shout themselves hoarse at the
sight of us. Two facts had, how-
ever, escaped our anticipation; the
first, that the hour would be 7 A.M.,
an early time for wild enthusiasm;
the second, that we should not be
the first to arrive by some hundreds
of thousands.
Our military ardour was not the
only thing about us to be damped
on that morning. There was a
light drizzle, also sent from heaven
to make us realise from the start
that this outing is not a picnic;
and when eventually we reached
our temporary canvas home and
nestled down as best we might
amongst the mud, there were not a
few of us who felt that there was, after
all, something to be said for the dull but
comfortable round of home life. From
what I have seen already, I doubt if
the domestic side of war has ever
before been so well catered for, but even
so it is distinguishable from a pure
beano. It has, however, its lighter
side, as for instance when I go shopping
in the villages for the officers' mess.
One has to have read with deep con-
centration to be able to remember at
the pinch how to demand a dish-cloth
in an intelligible fashion. We feed
almost entirely off pork chops at the
moment, owing to my personal ten-
dency to crack my little jest with the
village butchers. For when I have
done with business my butchers and I
turn to discuss the friendship of the

moves about a little in the meanwhile,
when there is no one awake to be
interested in his maladies. The younger
son is as bright a lad as you could
wish to meet. He smokes a pipe (with
some inner reluctance, I think), swears
in English, and has innumerable boon
companions among the early-rising
labourers of the place. I woke up this
morning to find a couple of them sitting
on the end of my valise and me, drink-
ing their first cup of café. By the
time I was thoroughly roused the whole
family were at their several posts in
various corners of the room. It was
essential for me to rise and shave my-
self; it was also essential for la
patronne to cook upon the stove.
But “toujours la politesse,” and the
worst may be passed off with a jest,
so as I lay upon the floor and
Madame bustled about I conversed
affably with her, starting with her
business, proceeding to the general
excellence of her cooking, suggest-
ing dishes most worth eating,
specifying pork chops in particu-
lar, and ending triumphantly with
the cochon jest. After that an
atmosphere was created in which
anything might be done without
offence. -
Meanwhile, always in the dis-
|tance (now the nearer distance) is
the booming of the guns. I sup-
pose the trenches are about a dozen
miles away and that we may be in
them at any time now. Well, we
are all ready for it and are asking
no questions. For my part, how-
ever, I cannot help wondering in-
wardly how it is that men can
keep on killing each other in this
methodical and deliberate fashion.
Nobody is in a hurry; nobody is in
the least excited, and I am quite sure
that if there was a picture palace
in the place we should all crowd
in the sole tap-room of a not unthirsty
village. The room is fifteen feet square;
it is at once the local bar, the battalion
headquarters, the mess and the bed-
room of half-a-dozen officers, including
myself. And when you consider further
that le patron and his family of five
also inhabit it you may imagine that
at times it is almost congested. But
for the competence of Madame his
wife I think we should not long sur-
vive. M'sieur stands always in the
middle of the room contemplating the
complex situation with an expression of
inscrutable gloom. Iły the stove, upon
which the meals of all of us are cooked,
sits permanently the pallid eldest son,
who is said to be an invalid but is
really a wastrel. He is there when I
go to sleep; he is there when I wake
into it for the sake of distraction.
Châteaux or tap-rooms, battles or
marketing, one takes it, apparently, as
it comes, trusting that Mr. Asquith or
someone has his eye on the progress of
events. However, by the next time
I write I hope I'll have something
more moving to write about; but I
doubt it, Charles, I doubt it. We
shall have got there all right, but I
am beginning to suspect that even
when we do we shall find nothing but ||
a turnip field and a deep ditch in which
we shall stay till we are told to come

but what good will that be? Nobody
will be able to look over the top and

the less I will tell you the facts as

But war and all that it means has at

The pale cheeks of Jenson the par-

wine, as a remedy directly contributed
towards it, and the conscientious zeal
of Snooks the grocer completed the
great awakening. It was in this wise.
Jenson, as I say, was pale and out of

my Aunt's all-seeing eye, and someone
had suggested Winoria. Why not?
Aunt Priscilla decided at once for
this invigorating wine-tonic. The very

Ere I remarked upon it;
And business was extremely brisk
In lines on how the lambkins frisk.
But now, though Spring is in the air,
I cannot heed the lambkin;
For bloom and bud I do not care

My musings always turn away
To men who're arming for the fray.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SENTRY-GO.
THE whole idea of posting sentries
was ridiculous. Just because we had
borrowed part of a man's country house
and called it a week-end camp there
was no real reason for turning three
men out in the cold night and calling
them sentries. . . -
The first I heard of the business was
a casual remark from our section-com-
mander that I “was on two to four.”
I took this to be some silly attempt at
a racing joke, so I said, “What price
the field 2" just to show that I knew
the language; and I thought no more
about it until I ran across Bailey. The
same cryptic remark had been conveyed
into Bailey's car, but he had discovered
the solution, though I don't believe he
guessed it all by himself. The fact was
that we had been picked with Holroyd
to do sentry-go between 2 A.M. and 4 A.M.
Personally I felt that the responsibility
was too great, so I went in search of
the section-commander. I told him
what my doctor had said about the
risk of exposing myself to the night air
and pointed out the absurdity of posting
sentries against a non-existent enemy.
He wouldn't discuss the matter at
length, and I suspect that he had heard
some of the arguments before, though
not so ably put.
Of course I didn't get any sleep
before 2 A.M. This was partly due to
the want of “give" in the floor, partly
to the undue preference shown by
Bailey's foot for my left ear, and partly
to the necessity of stopping the ten-
dency of certain members of the com-
pany to snore. Some injustico was
done in the last process, as it was
difficult to locate the offenders.
As I thought it might be wet I
borrowed Higgs's overcoat and rifle.
I hate getting my own overcoat soaked
through, and I never was any good at
cleaning rusty rifles.
It was a thoroughly dirty night, and
I took up my position under a tree,
leaving the others the easier task of
guarding open ground. Owing to the
discomfort of sitting in a puddle I never
got properly asleep, and this accounts
for the fact that my attention was
attracted by a slight noise in my
vicinity. I diagnosed a cat, dog or
snake, all of which animals can be found
in that neighbourhood. As I dislike
things crawling about me at night-time
I picked up a serviceable-looking brick
and hurled it in the direction indicated.
Naturally I didn't expect to draw a
prize first shot, and was surprised and
much gratified to hear a groan and the
sound as of a body falling. I had evi-
dently brought down a German spy
my game. It was a man right enough,
and 1 found him quite easily. I found
him with my feet and lost my initial
advantage. However, my luck was in,
and in the ensuing rough and tumble I
came out on top. When Bailey and
Holroyd arrived in response to my
shouts I was well astride his shoulders
and had his face concealed in the mud.
They both seemed a little jealous at
my success and, when they heard the
details, began to suggest that I had
acted irregularly. Bailey, who is a
special constable in his spare time, said
I ought to have warned the man that
“anything he said would be used in
evidence against him.” Holroyd said
that I ought to have waited until he
shot me before taking action, and then
gone through some formula about
“Halt, friend, and give the countersign.”
As they seemed to think they could
still put the matter in order I appointed
them my agents and gave them an
opportunity to say their pieces.
Bailey retired two paces and sol-
emnly delivered his warning. He got
it off quite well, and I admit that it
sounded impressive. Holroyd wasn't
quite sure of his part, and Bailey tried
to look it up in his “Manual” while
Holroyd struck matches. Holroyd
burnt his fingers three times while
Bailey was trying to find the place, so
he had to say it from memory after all.
Holroyd presented arms and said, “Halt.
Who goes there? Advance, friend, two
paces, and give the countersign. Wel-
come.” We thought he had gono wrong
on the word “Welcome,” but it sounded
a courteous and harmless thing to say
under the circumstances, so we let it
pass. -
The man, whose face was still firmly
embedded in the mud, didn't do any of
the things Holroyd told him. I put a
little extra pressure on the back of his
head to make sure he didn't say
“Friend,” and he had no real chance
with the countersign as we hadn't
fixed on one.
Everything being now in order we
sent Holroyd to fetch the picket. Hol-
royd had some trouble over the picket,
as they had forgotten to elect one and
no one volunteered. He got very un-
popular through having to wake up so
many people to arrange about it.
In the meantime I caught cramp from
sitting so long in the same position and
allowed Bailey to relieve me. When
the picket arrived they didn't get much
fun out of the captive, because Bailey
had spoilt him for the purposes of
resistance by getting more of his weight
than was necessary on the man's head.
The picket had to carry him up to the
house and pour quite a lot of brandy
life. They got him breathing at last
and told off a fatigue party to clear
some of his mud. They hadn't pro-
perly got down to his skin when his
power of speech revived. There seemed
something familiar in his voice in spite
of the fact that it was muffled by about
a quarter-of-an-inch of mud, and it
occurred to me that I had better resume I
my sentry duty without delay. I didn't
call anyone's attention to my departure
because I wasn't sure that I ought to
have left my post.
tric torch. -
My remaining hour passed quite i
quickly and I was almost sorry to be
relieved. When I got in I heard that
our Commandant was up and wanted
to see me. I found him in a dressing-
gown sitting in an armchair. He
wasn't looking very fit and had a nasty
gash over the right eye. As he's in
the regular army and only lent to us I
waited for him to start the conversation.
He seemed to find some difficulty in
getting off the mark, but on the whole
performed very creditably for an invalid.
I didn't attempt to answer half the
questions he asked. He didn't seem to
expect it—they don't in the army. I
just said, “I was on sentry-go, Sir, at
2.35 A.M. when I heard a suspicious
person. Being on active service at
night I dispensed with the challenge
and should have fired if any cartridges
had been served out. Under the cir-
cumstances I did the best I could with
the material to hand. I was fortunate
in capturing the intruder and handed
him over to the picket. I've not yet
heard whether he has been identified.”
He wasn't quite himself, and I ſancy
my answer surprised him. He seemed
to have a piece of mud in his throat,
and before he could get it clear I had
saluted and got away. Bailey's military
book is quite a useful little thing.
I was astir early in the morning and
took a walk in the direction of the post-
office. Before eleven o'clock I had
received a telegram calling me to town
on urgent family affairs. I had got an
idea that that part of the country
would have proved unhealthy for me.
My personal view of the whole matter
is that our Commandant might have
known that we should be awake at our
posts without getting up in the middle
of the night to find out. -
We learn from America that General
von BERNHARD1 has joined the staff of
the Press Bureau and by Imperial

A TEUTON TRAGEDY.
[It is reported that a small German outpost,
occupying an isolated house amidst the floods
of Flanders, is always warned of night attacks
by the quacking of ducks. The following

British consumption, by a German prisoner.]

MILITARY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.
[The Advice Column on Military Matters,
now a special feature of many contemporaries,
must not be supposed to belong only to the
present day. That similar columns were in
vogue in other times is proved by the following
extracts from antique records.]
J. Caesar (Rome).-By all means write
an account of your experiences at the
Front, but take care to find a sūriking
title. The one you suggest, “The Gallic
War,” is very flat. Why not: “In the
Neck, or How we gave it to the Gauls?”
Attila (Hungary).-Quite so, but are
not your methods a little boisterous?
What will the Germans think of you?
R. Bruce (Scotland).-The study of
insect life is, of course, perſectly harm-
less and indeed admirable as a re-
creation, but it must be regarded
strictly as such, and not be allowed to
interfere with your serious profession
of arms.
Joan (Arc).-Certainly not. If, how-
ever, you feel that you must be doing
something military, is there no local
body of girl guides which you could

in future days, when perhaps conditions
will be more stringent, your example
may be quoted by persons not wholly
inspired by disinterested motives, who
have reasons (financial and otherwise)
undreamed of by you for continuing
sports?
Horatio N.—See an oculist. We
must tell you frankly, however, that
the loss of the eye finally closes your
naval career. You should think of
taking up some civilian employment.
Wellesley (Eton).-We should be in
a better position for offering you advice
as to your chance of success in a mili-

Napoleon B. (Corsica).--Your height
would tell against your chances, and
we should think that for other reasons
as well you are hardly cut out for
a soldier. Have you thought of the
counter? If there is not much opening
in your neighbourhood, you might
think about coming to England, where,
as you doubtless know, there are
plenty of shopkeepers.

DRASTIC EconoMIES.
At the Plutomobile Club it has been decided to import
500 Peruvian waiters. . At a general meeting of the Club
held last week a motion was passed by a small majority
permitting the smoking of pipes after 12 P.M. and sanction-
ing the introduction of 6d. cigars. We understand that
the performances of the Blue Bessarabian Band in the
great porcelain swimming bath have been temporarily
suspended. " * -
A remarkable innovation is to be introduced at the
Lantern Lectures which are so welcome a feature at the
Benedicks' Club. It has been resolved to accept the offer
of several distressed dowager peeresses to serve tea without
wages, the “tips” being left to the discretion of the members.
The tariff of the Caviare Club has recently undergone
substantial alterations. The price of the house-dinner is
now reduced to 15s, a head and champagne is no longer
de rigueur. On the other hand an attempt to sanction the
introduction of barley-water and cocoa nibs has been
heavily defeated.
Visitors to the National Democratic Club cannot fail to
notice the altered appearance of that famous caravanserai.

SistER SOPHIE SEWING SHIRTS FOR NESSUs.
ONE OF OUR CANDID FRIENDS.
[In The Boston News Bureau, a daily paper,
Rear-Admiral FRANCIS TIFFANY Bowl. Es,
formerly Chief Constructor of the American
Navy, who has recently travelled throughout
Germany, has stated his belief that Germany
will win. He adds: “The probable situation
is that all the Allies are now ready to quit,
and that means not only France and Russia
but England; that Germany is ready to make
peace with Russia and France, but never with
England. The possible consequences of such
a situation are easily discernible, and merit
the most serious consideration by the people
of the United States. The chance of a suc-
cessful invasion of England cannot be lightly
dismissed.”]
ADMIRAL TIFFANY Bowles,
You've written a wonderful screed
For the good, no doubt, of the
souls
Of the men of the British breed.
You've studied the Fatherland
Exhaustively from within,
And your statement affirms in the
plainest of terms
That Germany will win.
You view the success of our foes—
Or so at least I learn—
So far as our own fate goes,
With singular unconcern;
In time on the U.S.A.
Appears to impart to your sensitive
heart
A certain amount of dismay.
You may glorify Germany's strength
As much as you goldarn please,
And hold she will win at length
The mastery of the seas;
But when you go on to assert
That we're “ready to quit,” by
goles,
You're talking rot and the thing
that is not,
Admiral TIFFANY Bowles.

THE SUSIE GAME.
“OH, Mr. Meyer,” said my hostess,
“you are so clever, you must think cf
a new game for us.”
If there is any form of request more
paralysing than this, I should like to
hear of it. So clever ! To be called so
clever in a company containing several
strangers, and then to have to prove it !
Surely tact should be taught at schools,
although, of course, after logarithms.
By some bewildering miracle an idea
suddenly entered my head. “Why not
play at “Sister Susie'?” I
said.
“You don't mean more
sewing?” my hostess re-
plied in dismay. º
“No, no,” I explained, ſº
seeing daylight as I talked. || ||
“First we want twenty-
six little bits of paper.

and we take out one each

that all clear?”
They said it was as clear
as mud, and I went through
it again with the crystal
clarity of a teacher of one
of those advertised systems
which impart a perfect
knowledge of French in
three lessons.
“Then,” I said, “you

three) letters, in the man-
ner of the famous Sister

“I felt sure there would be some
defects in the game,” I replied. “We
are only feeling our way, you see. We
had better leave them out.”
“Oh no,” said Aunt Eliza; “let’s
try them.”
Aunt Eliza spends quite half of her
life in guessing acrostics and anagrams,
and the difficulties of writing-games
are food and drink to her. -
Then the inevitable happened.
“Oh, but I can't play this,” said one
guest who had just begun to grasp its
character.

It was therefore decided to cut out
relationships and begin with the girls'
names right away. -
And so we started, five minutes being
allowed. I saw at once that Z was
useless. Zoe and Zuleika could be ſound
easily enough, but there was nothing
to set them to do. I therefore concen-
trated on my other letters, which were
U and J, and with infinite agonies

three letters were P, S and

dered thus:—

“Sally's singing SAINT-SAENs'

“But what about X?”
we demanded. -
“X isn't really possible,”

“Auntie Ann is asking aid for ambulances,'
or if B :—
“Bertha's boiling beef for bombardi-ers."
It must be alliterative; it must be as
much in the metre of the Sister Susie
line as possible; and it must have
reference to the War.”
The company having intimated that
this also was as clear as mud, I re-
peated it.
“But what about X'?” a pretty girl
asked.
“Yes, and Z 2 " asked someone else.

“You must leave us out,” they

Ten minutes having passed in fight-
ing to retain them, during which time
a third and fourth took courage and
fell out too, we settled down to the hat
with only eight players. That is to
say, we were each to have three letters,
and Aunt Eliza and I, being the most
gifted, were to share X and Z. .
We were just beginning when the
pretty girl wanted to know how we
were to manage about relationships.
“‘Sister Susie' is all right,” she said,
“and “Auntie Alice' and “Cousin

blinking it—that Germany will need
exactly 217,000 tons of copper per
annum for ammunition alone. Of her
sources of supply it may be said with
absolute certitude
(1) That her present imports from
neutral countries are unknown.
(2) That her own production cannot
be quite exactly estimated.
(3) That no one has the least idea
what her stocks were before the war.
Much depends upon what she can
gather up in the way of copper wire
and odds and ends. And here it must
be borne in mind that any tampering
with the telegraph wires may interfere
with the Imperial correspondence,
without which war cannot be waged.
But there are other sources. And here
we come to the most striking instance
of lack of preparation—the one im-
portant detail where German foresight
failed. It is a point that no other
commentator seems to have touched
upon, although it is in truth the root
of the whole matter. Germany alone
of all the leading belligerents is without
a copper currency. She cannot turn
her pennies into shot and shell. We
shall not be far wrong in assuming
that this deficiency will be the final
turning-point. The General Staff may
if it will collect all manner of cooking
utensils; the time may come, under
the pressure of British sea power,
when they will not be of much use, any
way, with nothing to cook in them.
They may commandeer electric-light
fittings; they cannot thereby keep the
people any more in the dark than they
are already. But they will be baulked
and thwarted if they look to retrieve
their fortunes by an assault on the
National Reservoir of the pfennig-in-
the-slot-machine.

THE TALE THAT TOOK THE
WRONG TURNING.
(A Magazine Study.)
Gerald Arbuthnot took his seat in
the train with a frown of impatience.
He had, of course, other things as well,
such as a return-ticket, the usual quan-
tity of luggage, and a copy of a journal
that modesty forbids us further to
specify—but the frown was the signifi-
cant item. How irritating it was, he
thought, to be obliged to make this
journey ! Still more vexing were the
provisions of the preposterous will that
had rendered it necessary.
Gerald was a bachelor, tall, wealthy,
handsome and of the usual age. It is
hardly worth while for me to describe
him, since you have met so often before,
and will meet as often again, in the
pages of contemporaries. Still, there
he was—for the artist to do his worst
with. To his impatience the train
seemed a long while in starting. At
last, however, all was ready, doors
began slowly to recede past the win-
dows. . . .
Gerald, a little surprised, but un-
doubtedly relieved, settled himself com- |
fortably in his corner. He was to enjoy
the journey undisturbed. And then,
just when it seemed too late, the thing
happened which Gerald and you and
every reader with experience had been ||
looking out for. The door was flung
open and the figure of a young girl,
exquisitely, if indefinitely, clad, was
thrust into the compartment.
It was the heroine.
“Here we are again,” said poor
Gerald wearily, but not aloud; for if he
was one thing more than another it
was well-mannered. “Up or down?”
he asked, after a sufficient interval to
allow the girl to settle herself into the
opposite seat. --
“I beg your pardon 2 " You know
the voice in which she would answer,
sweet yet cold—like ice-cream. -
“I mean,” explained Gerald, “that
as some sort of dialogue is obviously
expected of us we might as well begin
about the window as about anything
else.” - . -
She melted ever, so little at this.
“Possibly,” she said; “but why not
wait till the accident 2"
“I'm afraid I don't quite understand.
What accident 2"
The bewilderment in Gerald's face
was too apparent not to be genuine.
At sight of it the last trace of chill in
the girl's manner vanished utterly; as
a short-story heroine she was naturally
trained for speed in these matters.
“Why,” she said, with a little gasp
of incredulity, “surely you know that
I am here for you to rescue me in the
railway accident?”
“It's—it's the first I’ve heard of |
it,” stammered Gerald.
“But you must,” persisted the girl,
beginning now to be a little confused
in her turn. “See, round my neck
I have here the locket which falls
open as you lay me unconscious upon
the embankment.” She unfastened it
eagerly as she spoke, displaying the
portrait of a young man like a cheap
wax-work. “My brother” she said.
“But of course you think I'm engaged i
to him, and you go away, and we don't |
meet again till long paragraphs, per-
haps even pages, have rolled by.”
There was a moment's rather em-
barrassed pause. Then she added shyly,
“It-it all comes right in the end,
though.”
Gerald's colour matched her own.
In black-and-white illustration you ||
would have to take this for granted.
But no illustrator could have made him
look more foolish than was now the
Commissioned Officer.”

“Believe me,” he said, “no one
could more sincerely regret the fact
than I do. But there has obviously
been some mistake.”
“Mistake? I don't understand you.”
“What I mean is,” said Gerald, “all
this accident business. Of course, as a
private individual I should at any time
be delighted to rescue you from any-
thing in reason. But as a hero, acci-
dents are (if you will forgive me) not
in my line.”
“Your line?” cried the astonished girl.

of refined farce. At the present moment

“I see,” said the girl. “It was an

“that any hero might excusably make.”
She looked so attractive in her own

she said it that Gerald was moved to
continue—
“I only wish it had been true.”
The girl suddenly laughed, perhaps
to cover her slight confusion.

“How do you mean?”
“There's a station in five minutes.
Let us slip out there, and leave them
to explain matters to each other after
the smash. That ending would be at
|least as satisfactory as the usual kind.”
The train was already slowing down.
“Will you?” he asked.
Still, though the paragraphs were
running out, the girl hesitated. Then
at last she turned to him with that
wonderful smile of hers that has been
the grave of so many artistic reputa-
tions.
“Yes,” she said. She held out her
arms.
“My mistake!” said Gerald apolo-
getically; “I had nearly forgotten that
little formality.”
He kissed her.

THE UNIFORM.
“So you've got it on,” said Francesca, as she surprised
me before the looking-glass in my dressing-room.
“Yes,” I said, “I’ve got most of it on. There are a few
straps I'm not sure about, but we can fit them in later.”
“You’ll never get those straps right,” said Francesca;
“there are too many of them. No civilian could possibly
cope with them.”
“But when I wear this uniform,” I said, “I’m not a
civilian. I'm a soldier, every inch of me."
“But you can't be said to wear the uniform properly
until you've got it on, straps and all, so if you can't put on
the straps you'll be a civilian to the last day of your
miserable life.”
“Things might go better,” I said, “if you'd come and
help a chap instead of splitting straws at him. This Sam
I3rowne belt will be the death of me.” -
“Don’t give in,” said Francesca, “and don't get s
suffused. An officer in a Volunteer Defence Corps should
be more determined and less purple in the face. Infirm of
purpose, give me the leather.” . . . . .
“Take it,” I said, “and do the best you can. I'm fed up
with all these brass rings and studs and buckles.”
“I wonder,” said Francesca, as she took stray shots with
| the strap-ends—“I wonder if Sam Browne, the inventor,
can ever have dreamed of the agony his belt would some day
cause to a thoroughly inoffensive family. There—the belt is
safely on, the straps are all tucked up tight into something
or other. You look fairly like the illustrated advertisements.
Now let's study you at a distance.”
“Not yet, Francesca. I haven't got my sword on yet.
I refuse to be inspected without my sword.”
“One sword forward ' .. Quickl Isn't it a beauty 2
Which side ought it to go?”
“There is a prejudice in favour of the left side, and you'l
find a place specially provided for it there." . . . . . .
She jammed it in and stood off to contemplate the effect.
“Of course,” I said, “a sword is a superfluity. They
don't really wear swords now-a-days at the Front.” . . . .
“But you,” she said, “are really wearing this one, and
that's all I care about. Why, the hilt alone is worth all
the money." . . . . . . . . .
“Yes,” I said, “the hilt is extraordinarily handsome.”
“It's the most bloodthirsty and terrifying thing I've
ever seen. But tell me, now that you've got the whole
uniform on, what are you?" - -
“I am,” I said proudly, “a Platoon Commander or a
Commander of something of that kind. They won't let
me call myself a Lieutenant for fear of my getting
mixed up with the regular army, but I'm a subaltern
all right.” - - -
“A grey-haired subaltern,” she said, “one of the most
pathetic things in literature. Don't you remember him in
the old military novels? A most deserving man, but so
poor that he could never rise in rank. The gilded popinjays
turned into Captains and Majors and Colonels, but he,
although he kept on winning battles and saving the army,
remained a subaltern to the end.
married a grey-haired subaltern.”
“Well, you've done it,” I said, “and you can't get out
of it now. Another time you'll be more careful.”
“Let's go out,” she said, “and take a walk through the
village and show you off.”
“But I don't want to be shown off,” I said.

“And do you mean seriously to tell me,” she said, “that,

“This

I never thought to have ||
not even a little innocent open-air amusement? Come, you
can't mean that." -
“Yes, I can. I'm not ready for the open-air yet. The
uniform 's not accustomed to it.”
“But,” she said, “you must begin some time or other.”
“I know I must; but I shall do the thing gradually, so as
to coax the uniform into the air. One day I shall stand
in the lower passage, where there's always a draught, and
the next I can open all the doors and windows in the
library and walk about there, and then by the end of a
week or so I might work out into the porch, and so, bit by bit,
into the garden. But it'll be a slow business, I'm afraid.”
“Volunteer uniforms,” said Francesca, “seem to take a
lot of hardening.”
“They do,” I said; “and besides there's another objection
to going out.”
“What's that? Your modesty 2”
“No,” I said, “my pride. We might meet a regular soldier.”
“We should be sure,” she said, “to meet dozens of them,
and they'd all salute you. I should love to see them
doing it.”
“But suppose they didn't do it, where would you be
then, Francesca, and how would you feel about your grey-
haired soldier boy? These regula's might fail to realise
the importance of my grey-green volunteer uniform or even
to recognise its existence. Such things have happened.”
“But Tommy Atkins is a hero, and no hero could be so
cruel as that.” -
“Oh yes, he could,” I said. “It wouldn't cost him
a thought. All he would have to do would be to look
straight at me and not to raise his hand to his cap. It's
the easiest thing in the world.”
“Then you're afraid 2" she said.
." No,” I said, “I’m not. I feel as if I could face fifty
Germans, but just at present I'm not going to chance it
with Tommy Atkins.” -
“You're the most disappointing Platoonist I ever knew,”
she said. "“ISut perhaps you won't mind my calling the
children. There's no reason why they shouldn't see their

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Peter Paragon, Mr. John PALMER's novel, which finds
itself in MARTIN SECKER's intriguing Spring list, is a version
of the old Odyssey of youth in search of love. Unlike our
latest fashionable heroes, who arrive at their approximate
solutions through successive experiments of varying degrees
of seriousness, Peter, a thoroughly serious person from his
earliest years, steers clear of rocks of temptation and shoals
of false emotion, finally bringing his unwrecked galley
safe into harbour. So much distinctly to the good. But
here's a curious book. On page 60, Peter's father, con-
scientious clerk, admirable gardener, ineffectual anarchist,
whose relations with his son are quite charmingly described
and realised, is brought home dead from a street meeting
with a bullet through his brain. Some serious effect of so
unusual a happening is no doubt intended ? Not at all.
It simply-marks the end of a chapter and the beginning of
others in a quite new key. Peter, made rich by a successful
uncle, goes up to Oxford, to Gamaliel, becomes inevitably
“Peter Pagger,” and leads a set of intellectuals who sharpen
their wit by elaborate ragging. An old Gamaliel man may
be assumed to speak with authority, as here he certainly
does with sprightliness, of several of the traditional rags of
recent years, adding in a burst of creative exuberance the
diverting adventure of the trousers of the Junior Prior.
Peter, sent down, and established in London, wearies of the
intellectuals of Golder's Green and Clement's Inn, and
drifts reverently into upper circles. IHere, to be candid, his
creator slips into something perilously near The Family
Herald, tempered of course by the Gamaliel manner.
the part about the dying Earl, and Lady Mary, who
No, dance.”
Now You watch ME. THIs Is How To GET 'EM.”
And if the other parts about the naughty granddaughter of
the farmer, and Vivette, the musical comedian, and the
return of Miranda will do (of which I'm not sure), at
least they don't fit. In fact I'm not quite convinced that
Mr. Palmer has not been indulging in a little literary rag
of his own for our confusion.
Probably by this time most readers of memoirs have
pleasant associations with the name of Mrs. HUGH FRASER,
so that her latest volume, More Italian Yesterdays
(HUTCHINsoN), will need little recommendation. If you
love Italy and enjoy anecdotal history, ancient and modern,
served in a medium of pleasant gossipy talk, you will like
this book. Much of it might perhaps more aptly be
described as Italian days-before-yesterday. There are, for
example, some chapters on the sanguinary affairs of
mediaeval Naples, and others—more interesting—about the
rise and fall of KING MURAT. For these last alone the
book would be well worth reading. But what I have
always liked most about Mrs. HUGH FRASER's style is its
versatility. Discursive is an inadequate word. She is
fully capable of ranging in a paragraph from the horrors of
Bourbon cruelty to the engaging naughtiness of her
nephews. As she herself says, “With the best intentions
in the world I start to tell the story of some great
person . . . and in the middle of the tale the sun strikes
on my page—a child laughs across the street . . . and
farewell to the historic train of thought ! My hero or
saint recedes into the shadows, and relinquishes the canvas
to a thousand amiable little sprites of memory who hold

small sister and brother sent out widespread invitations for
a party of “theatrakulls” to the number of some two
hundred, and only by a happy accident was the grown-up
hostess warned of this entertainment. It seems character-
istic that no attempt was made to avoid the undesigned
responsibility, and the “theatrakulls” duly took place, with
enormous success. Surely, much of the jollity of a family
like that survives in its daughter's pages.
There is, or was, to be seen in the papers an advertise-
ment of some profit-sharing tobacco company, of which the
chief feature was a happy-looking person with a cigar in his
mouth who was supposed to be saying through the clouds
of the same, “I am paid to smoke.” I achieved something
of this man's happiness while reading The Voice of the
Turtle. The thought that I was actually being paid to read
it made my pleasure perfect, for as a rule, when I become
call them friends. A fellowship in tube and bus is all very
well, but on a winter evening I like the figures that people
my hearthstone to bring in some finer air of mystery and
romance. But the authoress, as I ought to have remembered,
knew well what she was about, and showed me once mole
that the slangy bank clerk on the opposite seat was not
only her hero, but a worthy knight of KING ARTHUR's
Table; that her commercial traveller carried about a life-
work of regeneration with his bag. Indeed before I had
gone far I was made to realise that, though the scene of
the drama was a London common and a house or two in
its dreary neighbourhood, the piece itself, humorous,
romantic, tragic in turns, was really an old, old mystery
play—consciously allegorical. Whether as an allegory it
is entirely successful, or whether it will be remembered
more for the fascinating intimacy of its characterisation
and the almost uncanny penetration of its philosophy, I
absorbed in a book, an incon-
venient conscience worries me
with suggestions that I am a
lazy devil well on the road to
the workhouse. It is a shame
to take money for reading The
Voice of the Turtle. It is the
pleasantest, most engaging
book. Shallows, Mr. FRED-
ERICK WATson's last novel,
good as it was, had not pre-
pared me for this excellent
comedy. If Messrs. METHUEN,

to blame Mr. PHILLPOTTs for

taking Deeping Hall, in Loamshire, his journey thither
and his first attendance at church; as proof of the second,
the various scenes in which the gradual alteration in his
character is conveyed to the reader. Mr. WATson, as a
writer, is the exact opposite of his Mr. Itichards, the
choir-singer. The latter, “with a reckless debauch of
strength,” produced no results whatever. The former has
written an excellent novel without secming to exert him-
self at all. He has just quietly thrown off a little master-
piece.
Mrs. PARRY TRUScott had intended to call her latest
story Such Is Life, but discovered at the last minute that
this title had been already requisitioned. She has hit on
a second name that is meant, I suppose, to come to about
the same thing as the first, since to be Brother-in-Law to
Potts (WERNER LAURIE), or such as Potts, may be taken
as a typical incident of every-day existence. For it is as a
very ordinary person that he is introduced, and the same
applies to his brother-in-law; in fact so humdrum did all
my new acquaintances seem likely to be from the opening
determined the whole future
life of the turnip-stealer.” At once my sympathy was
enlisted on behalf of this lad — Harvey Porter — who
preferred stealing to starving, but after he had found
refuge in the pottery called Brunel's Tower and had
become a favourite with the owner my interest in him
began sadly to wane. With meticulous care Mr. PHILL-
Potts sets-forth his hero's character; no fairer statement
of a case was ever made. But granted that a boy of
Harvey's upbringing might be puzzled to distinguish
clearly between right and wrong, I still wonder whether
among his besetting foibles the vice of meanness need
have figured so strongly. Specialists in the influences of
heredity and environment will revel in a study that is
marked by great sincerity, but I have such an affection
for Mr. PHILLPoTTs' former work that I cannot offer him
a very enthusiastic welcome in his new rôle of psychologist.

BERNHARDI’S APOLOGIA.
[In the New York Press the author of Germany and the Next War
has explained the purity of his own and his country's attitude; and
has followed up this defence with a résumé of the War, completely
favourable to Germany, and corresponding in scarcely a single detail
with the facts.]
I'M told they ask for bread and find
Their staff of life a broken reed
(No doubt a Teuton bluff designed
To make the hearts of neutrals bleed);
But you, BERNHARDI, you at least
Need never know an aching hollow,
Who have, for your perpetual feast,
So many swelling words to swallow.
On these a siege you well might bear
Such as Przemysl never faced,
And show at last, with hands in air,
A heavy bulge about the waist;
For, though the cud that you have chewed
Has cost a deal of masticating, .
I think you never handled food
So rich, so meaty, so inflating.
On this ambrosial forage fed
You leave your rôle of warrior-seer,
To re-create the past instead
For long and innocent ears to hear;
And in your twopence-coloured tract—
Its Teuton touch so light and airy—
Dull History, disengaged from Fact,
Debouches on the bounds of Faerie.
I ask myself, as I survey
Your effort in The New York Sun,
“What will the other liars say
When they perceive their gifts outdone;
When they suspect, what now I know
Who hitherto retained a bias
In favour of the Wolff Bureau—
That you're the leading ANANIAs?” O. S.
UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.

. . . but when I am asked to go a step farther I really
must cry Halt. For the truth is that you yourself, with
your awful nod and your glittering uniforms and your loud
meaningless talking and your sham religion and your fond-
ness for poor jokes, are merely one of the superfluous
things of which the world is full. Nobody who knows me
will suppose that, because I have chosen an inappropriate
moment for showing up my fellow-countrymen, I am
therefore likely to sing hosannas in your praise. What I
see in you is, as I say, a superfluity. What you see in me
Heaven knows, and I think I can guess. It is intellect,
pure intellect, and in paying attention to what is repre-
sented to you as intellect you imagine you are acting up to
the traditions of your family.
To be sure your predecessor didn't make much of his
intimacy with VoITAIRE. When all is taken into account
the sneering ill-conditioned old writer has the best of the
quarrel, though no doubt the King had his happy moments
when he set the philosopher shrieking his woes all over
Europe. No, I don't like the precedent. I cannot imagine
myself at Potsdam any more than I can imagine you at
a general meeting of the Fabian Society. By this I don't
more than I mean that there are no more delectable dis-
cussions than those of my beloved Fabians. All I mean
is that you and I, both of us admirable men in our way,
had better keep ourselves to our own pasture grounds and
not try, as you are trying, to encroach upon those of our
neighbours. What should I do at Potsdam 2 It is possible,
perhaps, for a German to have esprit—to be light and witty
in conversation, sympathetic in his intercourse with others,
unpedantic and rational in his judgments; but if we may
assume the existence of such a German we may at the
same time be quite certain that we shan't find him in
Potsdam or in any place that has the true Potsdam qualities,
with its tame Professors, its stiff military heel-clickers, its
intolerable heaviness in the intellectual atmosphere and its
calm assumption, maddening to a mind like mine, that
Germans are necessarily right because they are Germans.
To be patronised by a Professor or a General, and above all
to be patronised in the German language, would be death to
me in something less than ten minutes. I don't want to
die and I do want to go on writing prefaces to my plays, so
to Potsdam, the Canossa of the spirit, I, at any rate, refuse
to go.
May I remind you, by the way, that FREDERICK, your
supreme model and CARLYLE's favourite, was in some
points but a poor German. Prussians he thought excellent
as material for filling up casualty lists, but beyond that he
doesn't seem to have cared to give them much power. As
to the German language, he had the utmost contempt for
it as a medium of intercourse between civilised human
beings. Next to his ambition to win fame and rob MARIA
THERESA he had one ardent desire—to shine as a master of
the French language. He deluged VoITAIRE with his efforts
in French poetry. After he had defeated SouBISE in the
battle of Rossbach he sat down and composed a perfectly
execrable copy of French verses, in which he held his enemy
up to the derision of mankind in an abominable series of
insults. The badness of the lines may perhaps be taken as
a strong proof of his patriotism. Have you ever read
them 2 And, if you have, what do you think of them 2
You are certainly wrong when you declare that the
German case in this War must commend itself by its not-
to-be-broken strength to any candid mind. No mind could
well be more candid than mine, and I can only say that,
having read with great reluctance much that has been
written on the subject by Germans, I have come to the
conclusion that your German case is the worst of all those
produced by the War. In comparison the case of England
is crystal clear, and even the case of Austria takes on a
certain amount of reasonableness. If you ask me why I don't
say that in England, I reply that that is not my way. To
|. cold water on the opinions of one's countrymen is the
est plan for getting oneself talked about—better even
than putting on a silver helmet and spouting Imperial
rubbish before an Army Corps. And if one makes a howler
about the history of the United States and the proprietor-
ship of Alaska so much the better. It isn't everybody who
can get himself corrected by a schoolboy.
Yours at a distance, G. B. S.
The Truce.
“Our readers are earnestly requested to support headvertisers in
the paper.”—The Common Cause.
Appearing in an organ of the feminists this shows a most
forgiving spirit.
“All Germany wanted from Russia was that she should not con-
tinue to be the hope of the Slaps.”—Newcastle Evening Chronicle.
If Germany wanted to attract the Slaps to herself she has
mean that there are no worse places than Potsdam, any
succeeded beyond her wildest hopes.

Pte. 111111 Wilks had had a bad

decided to swear them all together on
the same book. In the mélée which en-
sued several thumbs were unplaced and
most of the others were left unkissed.
The prisoner pleaded “Guilty” to
the first four charges and “Not Guilty”

upset by this, and Captain Hake had

A junior officer, who

What makes you think

up and said that on page
79 it was distinctly laid
down that the Prisoner's

to cross-examine until
after the verdict.

The President pointed

TO BORE ME AWFULLY, ONCE:
“Does it matter?” said Captain
Halibut. “He’s pleaded guilty to much
worse things.”
The President thought it didn't
matter much, but Captain Hake pointed
out severely that in that case the
whole day of one major, two captains,
an adjutant and fifteen subalterns had
been wasted—an incredible thing to
suggest. “Besides,” he added, “It's
a question who is going to pay for the
new sock.”
“True,” said the President; “then
let's give him the benefit and say,
“Not guilty.’”
Captain Hake fell into the Manual
of Military Law and explained how

“CURIOUs THING, REGGIE —THESE CHAPs DRILLIN' EveRYwHERE USED

And that, you think, is the end.
How stupid of you. It turned out
that Captain Hake's name was really
Captain Hike, a fact which of course
washed out the whole proceedings. So
another court-martial was held, and
Second-Lieutenant Smithson, again
up for instruction, heard C. Q.-M.-S.
Sturgeon's evidence five more times.
And even that didn't settle it; for at
the end of the second court-martial
the convening officer made another
discovery. Second-Lieutenant Smith-
son fancies it was that Prisoner's Friend
had paraded in court with the upper
lip shaved—contrary to the King's
Regulations, Sect. XII., par. 1696;
anyway there was a third court-martial,

time Second-Lieutenant

words: “One pair of

rescue the ravished bride of
Agamemnon.”
Pardon us, but we think
that he was consulting
the Manual of Map Reading. Captain
Halibut apologised and suggested that
a window should be opened.
A heated discussion followed. Pris-
oner's Friend said that he only wanted
to ask the witness if he were quite cer-
tain. Witness said at once that he
was. Prosecutor said that he wanted
to say some time or other, and he didn't
much mind when, that shooting your
commanding officer in the leg was a
very serious thing. President assured
him that, as prisoner had already
pleaded guilty to this, nothing more
could be said on the subject. All
Prosecutor could do was to point out
the heinousness of losing half a pair of
socks. Prosecutor promised to do this.

RE DoIN'? DODGIN" A SUBMARINE 2"
THE ROAD TO BERLIN.
I'M looking for the man who de-
|signed the “Silver Bullet” puzzle. I
have something to say to him that
won't keep.
What's so maddening is Peter's
attitude towards, the wretched thing.
He comes in from school, sees it lying
about, picks it up any old how, gives it
a few really hard shakes, a pat here
and a bang there, and the bullet is
, where good British bullets should be—
in Berlin.
He doesn't even give his mind to it
while he's doing it, but goes on
whistling the air which was in pro-
gress when he arrived home.
Peter is rising nine, and I'm a few
inches over forty-seven, and a special
constable with prospects of early pro-
motion, but I haven't succeeded in
mastering the puzzle yet.
Yesterday Peter went over the course
a dozen times in as many minutes.
“You have another try, Daddy,” he
said.
“Well, only one,” I said.
I got as far as Magdeburg for the
have one more.
I said.,
It was then 8.10, and at 8.46 I think
Peter was sorry he had tempted me.
“Look here,” I said, “you may stay
up till I've done it, for a treat. I
shan't be long. I nearly did it that
time. I got past Hanover.”
“Thanks,” said Peter, “but I have
to go to school in the morning. As
you're busy, I'm going to bed now.”
I was busy. I'd reached Hamburg
three times, and the lust of conquest
was heavy on me. It was at 11.15
that the flower-vase went. Dresden
was responsible for that. There is a
horrible swan-neck curve as you ap-
proach the town from Leipzig, and I
tried one of Peter's sideway jerks.
Still, if I hadn't been leaning over the
table to get the full benefit of the
electric light which hangs over it,
Alison's favourite bit of glass might
have gone on a little longer.
Towards midnight Alison called to
know if I was aware of the time.
“Hush ' " I said; “I’m just outside
Berlin. The Germans might hear you.
I've got to Potsdam.”
“Absolutely the last,”
at that moment the bullet slipped down
the hole. By 12.30 I had reached
Potsdam four times, and four times the
accursed Bosches had mined the road
and swallowed the advancing foe.
It was not till 1.17 that by an un-
paralleled feat of dexterity # got the
bullet past Potsdam, and Berlin fell.
Unfortunately, the rest of the ap-
paratus fell with it, and the glass broke.
That was the price I had to pay for
Peace, but it was worth it.

PUNCHI, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WAR NEWS FROM ITALY.
Rome, March 26th, 1915.
I THINK it may interest you to know
| what the Press here is saying about
the War. In Italy we do not have
top Press News” or “Latest News
from the Front.” We browse instead
on “Ultimate Notices” and “Recentis-
simies” (an Ultimate Notice bearing
about the same relationship to a Re-
centissimy as a London “egg" to a
London “new-laid egg”). The language
also possesses the advantage of enabling
one to make short work of places like
Lwow (Leopoli is both elegant and prac-
ticable), though towns consisting purely
of consonants remain the same Shibbo-
leths here as elsewhere. We have ap-
parently several sources of information,
and from a general sifting of telegrams
I have come to the conclusion that
those headed G.E. are trustworthy,
while those preceded by E.V. are not.
Caterina, who makes periodical sorties
from the kitchen to proffer pantomimic
assistance when I am in difficulties,
suggests that they all emanate from
the Devil; but then she is a Sicilian.
“(G.E.) One announces from Londra,
and The Daily Mews annexes grand im-
portance to this telegram,” etc., is read ||
with interest and only slight mental
reservation. “ (E.V.) From Berlino by
radiotelegraſy” (we read on for fun)
“one is informed that ten English ships
of war became sunk in the sea of the
North after a sconflict with our torpe-
does”; or telegrams headed, “The War
reflected from Berlino,” are frankly dis-
missed with a smile of superior wisdom
or an impatient shrug.
You must not suppose that because
Italy is neutral she is sparing of head-
lines and large type; on the contrary,
we indulge in these in a most liberal
manner. Then, too, regarding our
official news, we are not to be put off
with such dry stuff as the consolidation
of positions round Perthes or slight
progress near to Berry-au-Bac. We
have instead strictly neutral guesses of
an agreeably titillating nature:–
“The Russians respinted from Po-
lonia?” “The defunct general Hadda-
nuffsky shall have been resurrected 2 ”
“80,000 prisoners and four mitraglia-
trices impadronited by the Austrians?”
Unfortunately other sentences ap-
parently guileless are not all that they
seem, and Caterina's gestabulary is not
always equal to coping with them.
On the other hand, “The German State
Major has prepared since a long time
a vast and complex piano,” etc., is ob-
viously sheer rubbish.
Some gems I secrete from Caterina,
and hug them in all their fascinating
obscurantism to my British bosom.
For example—“Scontri fra pattuglie
di cavalleria melle trincee mel pomeriggio
del 24.” I often brood over this.
“Scounters between pattugles of cav-
alry" opens well enough; but the rest
seems to be a conundrum.
The Italian language is nothing if
not courteous. Note how amiably it
refers to its but lately bitterest enemies:
“Discomfiture of two Turkish divisions.”
On another page of the same issue
popular satisfaction would appear to
have outrun editorial courtesy: “Turks
slogged from Tschoroch. Ottoman de-
feat complete.” Caterina was too mild
over “sloggiati,” inferring a pushing
movement; perhaps, however, the
Italians, being a Southern race, slog
more gently than the Russians.
We do not feed solely on Allied and
German telegrams. We have indepen-
dent comments of our own on the War
in general. We examine the conditions
on the two fronts dispassionately, and
though one writer in The Courier of the
Evening is inclined to believe that it
will take the Allies thirteen years to
reach Cologne, on the other hand a
more hopeful gentleman entertains the
opinion that the new English armies
will upset the squilibrio (apple-cart?).
Caterina and I discourse non-com-
mittally on the chances of the “War
of Dirigibles and Submergibles,” Cater-
ina on the whole favouring the Zipiloins.
Colourless anecdotes and recently-ful-
filled prophecies round up our daily
mental fare. Sometimes by way of
a bonne bouche we have a horoscope
of the KAISER (Guglielmo). And so
from the huge Recentissimies of the
War we descend to the small beer or
“Little Chronicles'':—“The Parisian
Pythoness;” “Grave suicide of prom-
ised spouses; identification of these.”
Finally we peruse with languor the
advertisements or “Little Publicities,”
for after all the journalistic emotion we
have been through we feel as though we
had actually been struggling with the
Germans in Sciampagna and Fiandra,
and were really taking our share in the
great cataclismo (world-sconflict).
“18,000 words often mispronounced, W. H.
P. Phpfe.”
Advt. in “Hong Kong Daily Press.”
If Mr. PHPFE can pronounce his own
name correctly, there can scarcely be
18,000 words that present difficulties
to him.
“The Railway Department announces that
arrangements have been made for a reduced
train service, whereby a million males per year
will be ‘saved.’”—Sydney Daily Telegraph.
Saved for the line, we hope. With this
splendid Australian example before
them our own railways can surely spare
a few more men for the colours.
OUR SKI SECTION.
ON the whole ours is a good corps.
We have bits of most things, but for a
long time lacked a ski section. I men-
tioned the matter to our Commandant,
not in the spirit of reproach but of
suggestion. After considerable hesita-
tion he gave me permission to raise one.
He is rather old-fashioned in his ideas
and seemed to doubt the practical
utility of the section. He even talked
about the approach of Summer. He
has spent the last few years in India
and forgotten the rigours of an English
May. I pointed out to him that France
might well reproach us with not taking
the War seriously when we were not
even training skiers to meet ANTON
LANG on equal terms should he land
on the East Coast from Oberammergau.
I was lucky in getting a nucleus, con-
sisting of two men who had skied before,
three who had seen skis, and four who
had heard of them. We bought up a
derelict stock laid in before the War in
anticipation of Winter sports.
As the snow harvest in this country
is somewhat uncertain, I decided to
start drilling without waiting for a fall.
I had some difficulty in getting the
squad to form fours neatly. I had to
reprimand Bailey several times for
treading on the skis of his rear-rank
man. Bailey didn't properly under-
stand the things and would insist that
they had sent him an odd pair.
Our most effective turn was marking
time. I am told that we could be
heard two miles off, and that a number
of people mistook us for a pom-pom in
action. t
I have had several offers of Music
Hall engagements if I can get my men
a little more effective.
The section had standing orders to
mobilize at the top of Ludgate Hill at
the first sign of snow. I thought that
this would be a nice easy slope for
them to start practising on. Our first
mobilisation was rather a fiasco owing
to the unsatisfactory nature of the
snow. Several flakes looked like setting,
but were run over by motor-buses in
their early infancy.
On the second occasion our man-
ouvres were spoilt by the obstinacy
of the Commissioner of Police and the
Corporation. The former refused to
stop the traffic, whilst the employés of
the latter made spasmodic efforts to
steal our snow. This led to confusion,
the permanent loss of one man to our
corps and the ruin of three pair of skis.
It was unfortunate that the motor-bus
and our casualty both skidded at the
same time and in one another's direc-
tion. I think that the motor-bus was
to blame, because the skier started his

PUNCH,
skid first. Bailey carelessly did the
“splits” in front of a taxi and got his
skis run over. I have launched an
action against the motorist who got my
right ski mixed up with the spokes of
his off back wheel. He oughtn't to
have come so close just as I was getting
up from a lying-down position.
Before we were really used to the
business the Corporation men got away
with the best part of the snow and we
had to adjourn to Hampstead Heath.
We lost three more men on the
Heath, as the snow wouldn't lie evenly
on the slopy bits. I hadn't much
sympathy for one man who would go
down the hills backwards. I told him
that he was sure to bump the back of
his face.
Those of us who took train to Derby-
shire found some good snow and got
some useful experience. We mightn't
have had so many serious accidents if
I had kept them to extended order
drill. They confused battalion drill
with company drill. When I ordered
them to “form section” they usually
“formed mass,” and the subsequent
sorting wasted a lot of time. Our
professor of mathematics confused the
order up with conic sections and spent
his time describing parabolas. Higgs
went back at the end of the first day
in anger because we refused to waste
the whole afternoon looking for half-a-
sovereign which he said he had lost in
the snow.
We found our rifles a nuisance, and
Bailey and Holroyd nearly came to
blows. Holroyd declared that Bailey
had wantonly tried to bite off the fore-
sight of his rifle so as to prevent his
winning the shooting trophy. Bailey
was most unfortunate. He seemed to
go out of his way to get hurt. It's
quite an acrobatic feat to get the point
of one's ski in cne's own eye, but
Bailey managed it. I never could get
the section to lie down simultaneously;
nor could we find any satisfactory
method of keeping in touch with our
rifles or concealing our legs and skis
from the enemy.
As soon as I found out how rusty
other men's rifles got I wasn't so upset
at having overlooked mine in the snow.
When the thaw set in the four of us
who were still out of hospital decided
not to volunteer for service with the
Alpine Chasseurs but to stick to Home
Defence. We have arranged to suspend
operations until we get some more
recruits to fill up the vacancies. Ski-ing
isn't as simple as it looks in the
pictures; there's always the chance
that a damp cartridge won't go off.

I RAMBLED round St. James's Park
(A pleasant aſter-luncheon jaunt)
To woo digestion and to mark
The varied waterfowl that haunt
St. James's lake; the scene was drear,
For men have drained the local mere.
Where dimpled waters danced of late
Lies arid concrete, chill and bare,
But just beside the Whitehall gate
One sorry pool remains, and there
Such homeless birds as love the damp
Have formed a concentration camp.
And where before the lake ran dry,
The pelicans' exclusive club
Contrived to win from passers-by
Most of the notice (and the grub),
Coarse rowdy riff-raft throng the plat,
A vulgar proletariat.
The pelicans, so ill equipped
To race with widgeon, coot or teal,
Nine times in ten get badly pipped
When sprinting for the casual meal;
From their demeanour I inferred
That this is apt to sour a bird.
For now they darkly brood apart,
Observing an unwelcome fast,
Each mourning in his secret heart

Londell's rooms are two—one to
sleep in, and the other to bolt toast

chamber. On the table was a basin of
hot water; Londell, with a small
sponge in his hand, was gazing sadly
at a Gladstone bag.
“Forgive me for intruding on this
busy bath night,” I said. “I have
looked in to remind you of our Easter
engagement. This time, try to avoid
packing odd boots for your spare pair.”
“I don't think I can come away for
Easter,” he said gloomily; and he
fingered the sponge as one in a dream.
Something had depressed Londell;
he wanted rousing. I went and helped
myself to one of his three remaining
cigars, but it had no effect.
“If I had another bag,” he went on,
“it might be different; but this is the
only one I have.”
“What's the matter with it? Quite
a good bag, it seems to me.”
Londell pointed to it in a way that
made me think I had never before seen
him so like the late Sir HENRY IRVING.
“There,” he said, “is the work of half a
lifetime. That collection is among the
time and thought, ay, and money
upon it.” It has cost me two hundred
pounds if it has cost me a penny. Am
I to sacrifice all for the sake of a
paltry four or five days at the sea? "

PUNCH, or THE LONDON
A NORTH-COUNTRY IDEAL.
THE Belgian army stood on the top
of a mound brandishing its trusty pine-
wood blade. The rabble of Germans,
recovered from one rebuff, was gather-
ing forces for another charge. The
Delgian army changed its sword from
the right to the left hand, drew out an
imaginary watch, and consulted it
severely.
Its defiant voice rang out through
the sharp air. “I’ll give you,” it
cried—“I’ll give you ten minutes to
| clear out of Belgium.”
The dramatic hush aſter this ulti-
matum was broken by the hurried
clamour of the school bell. Allies and
enemy alike showed a jumble of red
knees and flying heels as they rushed
schoolwards across the field.
The Mistress paused on the way to
her desk.
“Take your slates,” said she, “and
with very good writing and very good
spelling tell me what you are going to
be when you grow up. Even betting
on Frenches and Jellicoes,” she mur-
mured as she sat down.
A busy silence ſell on the school-
room. The open fire crackled cheerily
and warmed away the circles of frosty
air each little combatant had carried
in with him. Pencils scraped, or were
sucked audibly as a help to intellectual
wrestling. Bobby—the army of the
Belgians—had rubbed out his beginning
three times with a wet and grubby
forefinger, and was squeaking along the
dark wake in a fourth attempt. Spelling
was no trouble to him. A difficulty is
not a difficulty if you sternly refuse to
recognise it as such; but he had worries
not unconnected with the shape of the
more knobbly letters.
The voice of the Mistress broke the
silence. “Boys, stop writing; stand
and turn your slates.”
The little line of boys stood, slates
held firmly forward to be read. The
Mistress went slowly along. Outwardly
she marked with thin chalk and talked
of spelling and capitals and suchlike
mysteries. Inwardly, she kept count.
One small finger of the left hand was
tightly folded in for each Admiral,
while the Generals, Lance-Corporals
and Eield-Marshals were counted with
the right. At the end of the line five
fingers of each hand were firmly
doubled in and it was difficult to hold
the chalk.
“All square,” said the Mistress softly,
“and one to go. Bobby for the casting
vote.”
Bobby's slate was still turned towards
him. With infinite pains and much
puffing he was putting the final touches

with interest, “are you a brave defender

“Yes'm,” said Bobby.
“What is it with you? Land or sea?

“Yes'm,” said Bobby, beaming.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
JIMMY.
I DoN'T know if you are having the
measles at your house. We are. They're
on me. They are not half bad, really.
You have to sicken for them first and
then you get them. The doctor came
to see me have them. He gave me a
cynical thermometer to suck. He tied
a piece of string to it first because he
said that it was a one-minute one. I
don't like the taste of thermometers.
I bit one once and the end came off
and disagreed with me. Jimmy says
when they put the thermometer in
he had done them in arithmetic; they
came next to decimals and were things
where the numerator was bigger than
the thermometer.
When the doctor saw me next day
he said the rash was well out. I
knew that, because I had given up
counting them. The doctor said I
should have to have the quarantine
next. -
I asked Jimmy if he had ever had
the quarantine. He said it was stuff
you put on your hair to make it shine.
Jimmy brought me a caterpillar and
two thrush's eggs in a matchbox. I
was going to die that he told anyone
how to make it. Jimmy said it was
splendid stuff, and that, besides curing
warts and measles, it would make boots
waterproof. Only the cleverest doctors
know about it, Jimmy said, and they
daren't tell anyone lest the Indians
should get to know, and kill them.
The doctor said I might get up and
have the quarantine downstairs. He
said I wasn't to go near anyone or
they would catch it. He said I looked
very happy. I was. . You see the
doctor had sat down on the chair on
your mouth you have to see how
far you can make the mercury
move up the tube. Jimmy can
make it move up to the top -
every time. He says you have -
to hold your breath and then
blow. The thermometer wouldn't
boil, so the doctor told me to put
out my tongue at him. - The last
time I put out my tongue at
someone I had to have it im-
pressed on my mind not to ; it
was over a chair.
So I asked the doctor if it
wouldn't do if I made a face at
him instead. I am not so very
good at making faces. Not as
good as old Jimmy. He can
move his ears. And his scalp.
Jimmy says very few people can
move their ears really well. He
can do it one at a time, but he
won't do it now unless you give
him two pen-nibs. He is col-
lecting pen-nibs. He says if you
collect a thousand pen-nibs you
get a bed in a hospital.
They made me put out my
tongue at the doctor. When it
was all out the doctor said it was
a very nice one. Then he took
hold of my wrist and looked at
his watch. I asked Jimmy what

was what the Indians did, he
said. .
I didn't mind the quarantine
a bit, though it made me feel
weak in my legs at first. Jimmy
said that the best thing for weak
legs was to walk barefoot through
nettles. He said that the Indians
made their children do that, and
that was why they could run so
well. Jimmy made me some
medicine out of a rare kind of
root he had found by accident.
It smelt like cabbage. He said
it would make me feel very
hungry and that he always took
some at Christmas time. A
gipsy had told him the secret in
confidence in exchange for a pair
of his father's boots which he
thought his father had done with.
When I was nearly well from

arranged to go fishing. . He said

the watch go slower, and if it stopped
you were dead. Jimmy said that his
wrist always made the doctor's watch
stop. I asked him why he wasn't dead
then, and he told me it was because he
could move his ears. Jimmy says he
always kept moving his ears while the
doctor was busy with him.
I had the measles all right. I had
only a few at first, five, I think, and the
doctor said I ought to keep them tucked
up or else I should catch the complica-
tions. I asked Jimmy what the compli-
cations were. He had come quietly up
our backstairs to see me and the measles.
I told him he would catch them too.

AMoNG the advantages which we ex-
pected to result from the capture of a
certain fortress in Galicia was a change
of its name to something more easily
pronounceable by British lips. Our
hopes were a little dashed when we
read in The Star : —
“The correspondent of The Daily News in
Petrograd makes the interesting announce-
ment that in future Przemysl will be known
by its old Russian name of Przemysl.”
On turning to The Daily News itself
we were comforted by reading that the
fortress “now resumes its old Russian
name of Permysl,” but were again
thrown into some perplexity by learning
..on the same authority that the Archduke
FRIEDRICH had sent “greetings and

Permsyl.” The spelling, however, is a
comparatively trifling matter. The
really crucial question is the pronunci-
ation. The Daily News says, “Pru-
shemizel — the first syllable is very
short"; but The Daily Erpress, in ppp
tones, remarks, “Please pronounce it
as Pschemeezel.” From the news-
paper authorities we then turned to
the experts. Mr. SYDNEY WHITMAN
boldly writes in The Evening News:–
“The true Slavonic pronunciation of Prze-
mysl is ‘Priz-ee-missile,' pronouncing these
syllables in the way we pronounce “quiz,' ‘ea'
and a ‘missile'—a cannon-ball.”
This seemed almost too simple to b:
true; so, seeing that Mr. HILAIRE

this is what we read:—
“Mr. Belloc . . . pronounced it emisil,'
though he cautiously gave no guarantee of
correctness.”
The great oracle having failed to give
a certain sound, we were almost in
despair. But rescue came from an un-
expected quarter. “Our milkman,”

Russian victory of Prymrosill." Light

XIV.
DEAR CHARLEs, A perfect spring
morning; a clean, but rather idle
street leading to an even cleaner and
more idle railway station. Facing the
station, half right, a café, and also
facing the station, half right, myself
and my brother officers full of good
will towards humanity in general in
spite of the execrable coffee and bacon
we have just eaten. We sit on chairs
on the pavé, and far above us in the
blue sky flutters gracefully an aero-
plane. It is an exceedingly pretty
sight; it becomes even prettier when
little white clouds suddenly appear
round it from nowhere. If one hap-
pened to be looking when the little
white cloud arrives, one sees a flash,
but whether it is an English aeroplane
being shelled by a German gun, or
the other way on, no one seems to
know, except perhaps the *
who is being shot at. From this
picture you are requested not to
recognise the nameless spot to which
our thoroughly Unsentimental Journey
through France has brought us.
The peace of the day was rudely
disturbed at noon by the arrival of a
more personal shell in the very midst
of our billets. I am told that this was
probably our own faults for being much
too interested in that aeroplane. Appar-
ently it was hostile after all, and ex-
perience goes to show that if people
look up at these intruders their faces
become apparent to the observer, and
the notice taken of him encourages the
enemy to do worse. The proper
attitude is one of complete indifference.
You should look the other way and
then the enemy sulks and does nothing
more. The arrival of this shell produced
a most dreadful effect; it killed no one,
but it caused every single soldier in the
battalion to sit down at once and write
to everybody he could think of, simply
in order that he might mention, by the
way, the bursting of a shell in his
midst. This meant that every platoon-
commander had to read and censor
fifty letters before he could sit down
and write his own casual references to
bursting shells. This censoring of
letters is altogether an inhuman and
cruel affair; the lovesick private pours
out his soul to his lady, concludes with
all the intimate messages and signs
known amongst lovers, and seals the
note with the most personal of nick-
names. What the lady must feel who
reads the missive and finds at the end
of it my own prosaic signature, I dare
not think.
Since I last wrote we have stepped
have laid ourselves down to sleep in
some very odd places. It is surprising
how rapidly one can settle down to
anything, and it is even more surprising
how the men acquire the trick of getting
what they want without learning a
word of the language. They do it by
a nice mixture of kindness and per-
sistence; they go on naming the article
in their own dialect until the peasant
is fascinated or hypnotized into pro-
ducing it. The most conspicuous
success up to date is the case of our
peculiarly insular sergeant-major, who,
taking up a firm position before a simple
maid-servant, continued tapping his
forehead and smiling fatuously until
the woman eventually led him up the
street and pointed out to him the
nearest way to the lunatic asylum.
This was exactly what he wanted to
know. When the Adjutant attempted
to obtain the same information by mere
conversation, he could get nothing
better than a bucket out of the obse-
quious concierge.
Our entrance into the danger zone
was very striking. We had been
wandering about behind the lines, just
within earshot of the guns, and looking
for trouble, when the luminous idea
occurred to some red-hat that, since we
were dressed and looked like soldiers,
we might as well fight. So we were sent ||
for. A note came from someone, say-
ing that they were giving a little party
up-country, and they would be very
pleased to see us there next day; would
we mind walking, if it wasn't too much
trouble 2 and also it would save the
horses if we would carry all our luggage
ourselves. Thus, armed with 120
rounds of ball, a tin of corned beef and
an air of sinister importance, we
tramped off in the direction of the
noise. -
Had Mr. ARTHUR ColliNs staged our
night arrival on the battle-field in
absolute accordance with the reality, the
stalls would have said to each other, as
they supped afterwards at the Savoy,
“Very impressive, and essentially
dramatic; but too theatrical to be
real.” It was exactly as in the picture:
the long column advancing spasmodi-
cally along the straight road, bounded
by rigid trees at regular intervals, and
on the horizon the constant flashes of
battle—the gun, the star-shell and the
search-light. For myself I felt certain
that it was all a show, and to encourage
me in this opinion there were periods
of inactivity followed by bursts of
excessive energy, for all the world as
if the electrician was sleepy and not
attending to his business. War is, in
fact, a disappointing imitation of The
Lane, without the Savoy supper to
so well in our part of the line that we
in reserve were not called upon: our
baptism of fire was postponed; it is, in
fact, taking place now, half the battalion
being in the trenches as I write, and
the other half (including myself) being
for it to-morrow. I'll tell you all about
it in due course.
As I write I can see out of my
window all over the town (the owner
of the house, by the way, lives in the
cellar); my impression is of a vast area
of urban and rural land, entirely at
peace with itself and all the world;
but there is a corner of it, about 200
yards from my window, which has a
quarrel on with another corner about a
mile away. These two little districts
are making a terrible noise and even
throwing things at each other. Some-
times they get very violent about it,
sometimes they almost let the matter
drop. It is like two large dogs barking
at each other on Sunday, to the great
annoyance of the rest of a respectable
neighbourhood. And when the big
dogs keep on doing it, the little dogs
in the middle wake up and start
snapping at each other, and particu-
larly that quarrelsome breed, the
Maxim. The main thing, however, is
always the air of peacefulness, almost
exaggerated peacefulness.

THE COLD CURE.
AFTER a long period of immunity I
have had a cold. To be precise, I still
have it as I write, although it has once
been cured.
The miscreant who cured it was a
chemist in a West-end thoroughfare to
whom I was so misguided as to confide
my trouble. He had all the appear-
ance of a man and a brother—in fact
he looked benigner than most—and I
trusted him. He listened with the
utmost sympathy, his expression indi-
cated grief and concern, and his voice
took on a tenderness beyond that of a
mother.
“I can set you right very quickly,”
were his brave words. “I have here a
cold-cure that has never been known to
fail. You take one of these little tab-
loids every three hours, and to-morrow
morning you will wake up well. Be
sure not to take more than six in the
day,” he added.
He held up the little bottle as though
it were a jewel.
“And how much 2” I asked, feeling
that for such a boon no money was
adequate.
“Two shillings,” he replied; “and
you might perhaps like to take one
now.”
I agreed, and with infinite solicitude
he prepared a small glass of aqua pura
and smiled at me like a bearded Ma-
donna.
I went away feeling that complete
recovery was merely a matter of hours,
and for the rest of the day I was punc-
tual with the tabloids. By night I had
taken four.
I awoke the next morning not only
full of cold, as usual, but with a splitting
headache. When it was time to get up
the room began to rush round me.
Returning to bed, I fainted.
With great difficulty I dragged myself
up, but all day my head swam and
throbbed, and periodically I found it
impossible to focus my sight on any-
thing near by. Meanwhile I sneezed
and coughed with more than accus-
tomed vigour.
An instinct warned me not to go on
with the cold-cure, and a medical friend
corroborated my good sense by ex-
plaining later that it evidently contained
some very powerful drugs, of which
quinine was the chief, and I was suffer-
ing from them.
The next day my cold was worse but
my head slightly better.
To-day my head is normal but my
cold is terrific.
And now I want to know where I
should be, in English law, if I were
to stand outside that chemist's shop, as
I long to do, preventing people from
buying his cold-cure. What should I
get, beyond Mr. Justice DARLING's
quips, if the chemist ran me in 2 Is it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[Manch 31, 1915.
AT THE PLAY.
“Rosy RAPTURE"; “THE NEw Word.”
Nobody would think of looking for
intelligible motives or sequence of
design in an ordinary Revue. But
when Sir JAMES BARRIE writes one
it's a different thing. He may deviate
into fantastic episodes, but we suspect
an ordered meaning in his main design,
and if we fail to find it we feel that the
fault must lie with ourselves.
This was our trouble from the very
start of Rosy Rapture. There was,
in the first scene, a wardrobe, obviously
full of portent, whose secretive pur-
pose gave to the play a note of ob-
scurity from which I never wholly
recovered. Though this was not a
bedroom scene, the wardrobe was hung
with female garments, and from it
emerged, now and again, a husband in
lieu of the regulation lover. After
suffering a good deal of mental strain
I reached the rather intelligent con-
clusion that we were supposed to be
ridiculing the tendency of the modern
stage to substitute the drama of clothes
for that of intrigue. I recalled that in
Kings and Queens, which was then still
running at the St. James's, much stress
was laid upon the young wife's passion
for Parisian gowns, while the interest
she took in her lover was merely
casual and abortive.
It is not for me to question the
cleverness of this solution, but it was
wrong. I have since been credibly
informed that the author was harking
back allusively to certain plays of the
past, not of great importance and long
forgotten, in which a wardrobe was a
prominent feature. But not even his
ingenuous explanations offered at the
close of the first scene lifted for us
the veil of mystery that shrouded the
motive of this piece of furniture. Nor
was this obscurity relieved by the
lighting of the auditorium, which was
kept in darkness without intermission
during the entire performance. In a
mood of devotion I can persuade my-
self to support this arrangement when
I assist at a WAGNER rite; but the
atmosphere of a Revue is seldom really
religious.
It would have been more satisfactory
if the author, in what was partly a
burlesque of the legitimate stage, and
partly a sort of Revue of Revues, had
simply given us a succession of in-
consequent scenes, and not attempted
to weave his detached episodes into a
connected scheme. Perhaps the best
of them was a scene between a Flemish
peasant girl (I call her Flemish by way
of compromise, for she spoke French
and looked Dutch) and a Tommy
Mr. Norworth), who had rescued her
from the violent attentions of a Bosch.
Excellent fun was made of their limited
means of communication; but the chaff
of Lord Kitch ENER's advice to soldiers
about their relations with women was,
for those of us who remembered the
whole of it, of rather doubtful pro-
priety. A most delightful feature of
the Sixth Scene (and I am glad to hear
that it is to be extended) was a freak-
film of an automobile perambulator, the
work of that clever artist Mr. LANCELot
SPEED, author of the popular “Bully
Boy" series. The scene of the Supper
Club of the Receding Chins (where “one
chin excludes") was a sound burlesque
upon a certain phase of the modern
Revue. Indeed, this imitation of vulgar
banality was so close that the Pit

mistook it for the real thing and were
loud in their approval.
But the chief attraction of the play,
both for a bewildered audience and, I
suspect, for Sir JAMES BARRIE himself,
was the bizarre collaboration between
Miss GABY DESLYs and the author of
The Little Minister. Her best friends
could scarcely have been disappointed
if she failed to impart any very
noticeable refinement into the proceed-
ings, but many must have been surprised
to discover how well and with what
an energy she could act. All the same,
it would surely have been easy to find
an actress who could have spoken the
part at least as cleverly through the
medium of an all-British accent. But
perhaps it was just part of the scheme
of burlesque that the two principal
rôles in an English Revue should be
played by foreigners. However, the
native element was admirably repre-
terms of marked intimacy with his em-
ployers; by Mr. LEoN QUARTERMAINE
as a villain with an awkward strain
of hereditary virtue; and by Miss GER-
TRUDE LANG as a singer whose efforts
were always being obliterated by the in-
tervention of a fatuous Beauty Chorus.
Much of what may seem uncompli-
mentary in this first-night criticism
will have lost its point by the time it
appears in print. As is the way with
Revues, there has, I hear, been a
drastic overhauling of the original, and
I anticipate many changes for the better.
But no change could add to the
charm of Sir JAMEs BARRIE’s one-Act
play, The New Word, which precedes
his Revue. Here the author is at
his very best (and not too sentimental)
self; and Mr. O. B. CLARENCE as the
middle-aged father, never on easy terms
with his son, but now recognising a
new relationship created by the War in
which the boy is to play a part, gave a
very fine performance; and Miss HELEN
HAYE, as the mother, found, for once,
a chance of showing her gentler gifts.
I look forward to a still greater pleasure
when I can read this delightful play in
my private chair, and leave to my im-
agination those pauses and embarrass-
ments which, when they occur on the
stage—and they are of the essence of
this dialogue between father and son—
are apt to find a painful response in
my own sympathetic nerves. O. S.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN The Fabulists (MILLs AND Boon) Mr. BERNARD CAPEs
puts his practised pen to very much less effective use than
usual. Some freak of mind or circumstance has betrayed
him into a perverse experiment—the experiment of the too-
short story of mystery. Of course in fiction notions of the
very maddest may be made plausible for purposes of
entertainment if there be sufficiently adroit preparation.
An atmosphere must be created, a mood induced in the
reader. Mr. CAPEs leaves these necessary things out and
gives his shock in shorthand. Take “The White Hare.”
Modred shoots at a white hare and misses; simply can't
understand it; assumes witchcraft; loads with a silver
bullet; fires and kills; goes home to find his love dead.
Later, his mother-in-law comes to die. “Cut the cursed
thing out of me,” says she. “What cursed thing?” says
he. “Why, your silver bullet. 'Twas me you hit. I killed
your girl to mislead you.” So Modred with a howl of
fury tore it out, and a white hare jumped through the win-
dow. Behold all! And it's typical. I have compressed the
narrative slightly. Mr. CAPEs gives it a bare two pages
and a-half, and the thing simply cannot be done so cheaply.
These are indeed not short stories so much as skeleton
notes for them. For so clever a writer The Fabulists
seems rather a bad break.
The Minor Horrors of War (SMITH, ELDER) is an oppor-
tune little volume with very unexpected qualities. To quote
the beginning of the war in The British Medical Journal,
deal with various insect and other pests which cause
disgust, discomfort, and often disease amongst our troops
now fighting in all quarters of the globe.” Very well then.
Practical, you might say, and probably well worth the
eighteen-pence of its price as a gift to somebody at the
Front, but hardly a book to be read at home with pleasure
and entertainment. There, however, you would be wrong.
The writer, Dr. A. E. SHIPLEY, F.R.S., has such a way with
him that he can turn even the most unmentionable insects
to favour and to pleasantry. For my own part his un-
expected quips have kept me in chuckles. You recall
Mr. Dombey's pronouncement—quoted here—that “Nature
is on the whole a very respectable institution,” which
Dr. SHIPLEY caps with the admission that there are,
however, times when she presents herself in a form not to
be talked about. I can hardly therefore indicate even the
headings of his chapters. But I may, perhaps, take the one
upon (if you will permit me) the flea as typical of the author's
method. It contains a couple of quotations so pleasant
that I cannot forbear to reproduce them. In one the
indifference of the Turks to the attacks of this pest is
explained by analogy from the words of the schoolboy who
wrote: “A man with more than one wife is more willing to
face death than if he only had one.” The other is the
plaint of a distinguished French lady: “Quant d moi, ce
n’est pas la morsure, c'est la promenade / " I call that a

as you see, with incident. Some there will be in whom

bequeathed the solitary charge of a bibulous father, while
Walter Massaroon ſound himself possessed of an estate in
County Down, and journeyed from Paris, where he was a
painter, to become a man of property in Ulster. Whether
this sudden change of air and fortune affected Walter's
head, or whether he was always as lacking in determina-
tion as he is here represented, is not mine to say, because
I had no opportunity of making his acquaintance before
the gods and a second cousin once removed had poured
wealth into his lap. My feeling, however, is that he was
born with at least one weak knee, and I feel aggrieved that
he married Bertha, when the just reward for his misman-
agement of his love-campaign should have been the
heaviest of iron crosses. On the other hand, Bertha, in
spite of Mr. FRANKFort MooRE's efforts to make her a
super-angel, retains my most sympathetic admiration.
Mr. MooRE seems to find it as easy to write novels as I
do to read them, but I am beginning to wonder whether
this facility of his is not becoming dangerous. At any
rate I think that he is showing symptoms of trying to
promote rather cheap laughter, and it will be a thousand

him to post a letter. I felt impelled to salute my articled
clerk and my youthful nephews when I met them in the
street. The climax was reached when I was actually
slanged in a recruit squad by my dismissed office-boy, who
is home from the Front on sick leave. The only remedy
that appeared feasible was to secure a commission myself.
I broached the subject to a Territorial Colonel who was
at that time a friend of mine. He said he wasn't forming
a cricket team, but that if he had been in want of a slow
bowler he would have been delighted to recommend me.
The next man I tried was also a Territorial Colonel. He
had known my mother, but had no knowledge of me per-
sonally, so there was no excuse for his behaviour.
“I think you knew my mother,” I said.
He was a man of caution and wanted to hear her name
before committing himself. Judging that prevarication
was useless and liable to lead to suspicion I disclosed it.
“I knew her well,” he admitted, and held out his hand.
“What can I do for you?” he asked.
“I am my mother's son.”
“I guessed it.”
“I have been given to understand that there is a war on
and that this country is involved.”
“I have heard the rumour.”
“No doubt. These things do get about. Even the Press
has got hold of it. I shouldn't be surprised if there are
questions in the House on the subject.”
“I think that we may assume that this rumour is not
without foundation. What then 2"
“It seemed to me to be the kind of thing one ought to
be in, and that as you are, in a sort of way, a friend of
the family, I couldn't do better than have you as a
Commanding Officer.”
“You will find the Recruiting Sergeant on the next floor—
second door on the left. To avoid mistake my orderly will
show you the way.” He rose, and out of compliment to
“Then I may take it that I shall be gazetted in due
course. I hope that it won't be too soon as I have one or
two things I should like to arrange.” .
“Oh, you want a commission ?” We sat down again.
“That was my idea. I hadn't thought of serving in the
ranks as my friends tell me that I should be wasted there,
and seeing that you knew my mother the position might
be a little embarrassing for both of us. I thought of taking
a position as a Quartermaster.”
“Any experience?”
“Not very much to speak of.”
“How much 2 ”
“I once spent a week with an Army crammer, but we didn't
get on well together. He didn't understand my French.”
“A Quartermaster's duties are rather technical.”
“I have some legal experience. I am rather good at
filling up forms. I have a light style which goes down
pretty well. I should like you to see some of my corre-
spondence with the Inland Revenue people—I fancy you'd
like it. I think that I shall get the better of them if I
can keep the matter going for another couple of years.
Of course it's early days yet—the matter has only been
under discussion for four years—but they've already shown
distinct signs of weakening. So in case of any little
argument with the County Authorities or the War
Office 3 *
“Any other qualification ?”
“I'm pretty good at games. I write a bit—hardly
enough to be a vice. I've appeared on the boards as an
amateur and have escaped matrimony.”
“I'm afraid I haven't a vacancy for a Quartermaster at
the moment.” - -
“If you're already suited I don't want to press the
Quartermaster job. In a crisis like the present one ought
not to be too particular. I should even be prepared to take
an ordinary commission, though I can't say that I care
much for walking.”
“Any military experience?”
“Well, I once wore a sword at a fancy-dress ball. After
I put it in the cloak-room at the urgent request of the
stewards it only ruined one silk hat, and that was the
fault of the attendant, who didn't understand swords. Of
course I've played soldier parts. One of my most success-
ful rôles was a peppery colonel.”
“How old are you?” I was afraid that he would ask my
age, as it's my one weak spot from a military point of view.
“Does one have to justify any statement as to age?”
I asked.
“A birth certificate must be produced.”
“That's awkward. The only one I've got gives the
impression that I was born in 1875. I've always had
my doubts as to its accuracy, as I can't say that I recall the
event. They do make mistakes at Somerset House. I might
get them to alter it, but they're rather fussy and dilatory,
and one can't expect the War to last for ever. I must look
into the matter and see if I am justified in amending it
myself. Suppose we say born in 1885; that only means
altering one figure.”
“I’m sorry I haven't a vacancy. I've applied for more
officers already than I'm strictly entitled to have.”
“Then one or two more or less won't matter. I pre-
sume the War Office don't trouble to count up the number
of officers in all the Territorial regiments. When an inspec-
tion is threatened you might give a few of us leave, so as
not to overcrowd the parade. I shouldn't be upset at being
left out of it. When shall I join 2"

my prospective C.O. I rose too.

AT THE FRONT.
(In continuation of “At the Back of
the Front.”)
WEEKs and weeks ago a German
battery got the range of a slab of
railway from which our armoured train
had been grieving them; and but for
the fact that the train had moved off
about half-an-hour earlier it might
quite easily have been hit. The Ger.
man battery was so pleased at this
victory that they now make a hobby of
this bit of the line, dusting it up daily
from 5 to 7.30 P.M.; and I should think
it would be very dangerous for anyone
who was actually present at that hour.
But, as nobody ever is, our casualties
at this point are negligible. In the
meantime the noise is horrid; and our
billet has already thought out several
polite notes to the battery commander,
pointing out that we like to make up
lost sleep between tea and dinner. The
only difficulty is in the matter of
delivery.
There was a time when the trenches
days are gone. An offensive attitude
is demanded. We must, it is felt,
prove to the Bosch our activity, our
confidence in ourselves, our contempt
of him, and, in short, our höchste
Gefechtbereitschaft (all rights still re-
.. To achieve this without
actually attacking takes a bit of doing.
A specimen of demonstrative operations
ordered during twenty-four hours may,
without giving too much away, be
briefly sketched:—
4 A.M. Alternate platoons will sing
God save the King, Tipperary and The
Rosary until 4.15, and alternate sections
will fire one round rapid. Should the
Bosch disregard this
6 A.M. Swedish drill will take place
on the parapet. This having failed to
draw fire or other sign of hostile atten-
tion
10 A.M. The regimental mouth-
organist section will play the Wacht
am Rhein flatly, timelessly, tunelessly,
but still recognizably. When both
sides have recovered
5 P.M. Two companies will fire
remaining two will play association
football in front of the barbed wire.
By some such policy of frightfulness
we daunt the Bosch from day to day,
and we have small doubt that on that
afternoon when we go “over the top"
to take tea with him he will meet us
halfway with raised arms and a happy
smile of relief at the ending of his
suspense.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.
WI. -
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,-At last I am
back again in the regiment, and the
office, now a thousand miles away, is a
dwindling memory. The thing was
done in typical Army fashion. One
day last week the four of us who had
been left behind at Divisional Head-
quarters put our heads together and
rejoice to know that we were enabled
to leave him satisfied and beaming.
And we assured him it was no “tur-
bully.”
This, by the way, was our first
intimation that we had all this time
been employing a butler. The know-
ledge was rather staggering at first,
but now we are beginning to realise its
possibilities in future years. “Ah,
yes,” one will be able to say, “when
decided that as there was every prospect I was staying in India, you know, my
butler came to me one morning . . .”
But we shall, of course, studiously
refrain from mentioning that the butler
| used to clean the boots, make the beds,
of our remaining where we were for a
long time we might reasonably expend a
portion of our scanty pay in the purchase
of a few minor aids to civilised life,
such as plates and cups. Before
we could set out for the bazaar,
however, there came a precise
official intimation that, as it had
been found impossible to relieve
us, we must be prepared to
continue to serve in the office
indefinitely.
That altered matters. A few
months ago we might have been
deceived, but we know the Army
now. We abandoned our shop-
ping expedition, gathered to-
gether our scattered belongings
and prepared to depart. Sure
enough there came next day
imperative orders for us to
rejoin the battalion at once.
As you have often pointed
out, human nature is a perverse
thing. For over three months
we had been longing and agitat-
ing to be returned to our reg-
itment; as soon as the instruc-
tions came we regretted leaving
the office. We began to lament
our cosy little tent, our com-
parative liberty, the civilian
friends we had recently made,
and we looked forward darkly
to an era of irritating bugle
calls, stew and kit inspections. We
remembered, too, how far behind our
comrades in military efficiency we were
bound to find ourselves—and there is
no mercy in the Army.
But our last hours were cheered by
a letter from Mahadoo, formerly our
“boy.” I transcribe it for you liter-
ally:-
RESPECTED SIR,--I beg to ask that
your my Masters Please honour will
you kindly Sir I work with your before

wash the clothes and perform other
inferior domestic duties.
Forty of us, who had been collected
from various points, made the journey
up together. Being merely British
soldiers, we were given the worst
available accommodation (that of
course is our opinion; soldiers are
built like that), with the result that
five of us found ourselves in a grimy
and malodorous compartment, mea-
suring exactly seven feet by four, and
austerely furnished with two extremely
hard wooden benches a foot wide and
three hat-pegs.
But it was quite good fun. By
day there were innumerable fresh and
exciting things to see, while by night
the problem of sleeping kept us in
paroxysms of laughter for hours. It is
not easy, you know, to arrange twenty-
of bench. We contrived to relieve
the congestion to some extent by
improvising a hammock from a blanket
and some pieces of string. It was
a fine test of soldierly intrepidity to
sleep in that hammock. I occupied
it for one night, and I can tell you
I envied those lucky fellows safe in
their trenches at the Front.
We spent three days and nights in
the train, and at the end left our little
wooden hut with regret.
So here I am, back in the dear old
Army again, welcomed with the same
old Army greeting: “Hullo 1 You
back º Got a cigarette 2 " Nothing is
changed. On the day we arrived
we were marched down to the
Quartermaster's Stores to draw
our bedding. The Corporal in
charge of the party halted us,
told us to wait a minute and
went inside. Half-an-hour later
he emerged with another Cor-
poral, and both of them, after
telling us to wait a minute, dis-
appeared round the corner. An
hour passed. Then the Quarter-
master-Sergeant appeared and
demanded to know what we
were waiting for. We explained
wearily. “Wait a minute,” he
said, and went back inside. An
hour later he returned, looked
us up and down and asked what
the devil we wanted. Again we
explained, and again he enjoined
us to wait a minute, and dis-
appeared. We cooled our heels
for another hour and then
sprang to attention as the .
Quartermaster himself came on
the scene. “What do you men
want?” he demanded testily.
“Come to draw our bedding,
Sir," we cried in chorus. “Oh,
it's no good your coming to-
day,” he exclaimed. “Come back
to-morrow.”
Dear old Army
But perhaps there are indications of
a kindlier feeling among the N.C.O.'s.

is essential to a man's peace of mind in ||
barracks. In a moment of forgetful- |
ness I mentioned the fact to a Sergeant
and asked if I might have one. As
soon as I had done it I realised my
mistake; but to my surprise, instead of
paralysing me with a stony glare, he
looked quite sympathetic. “I know
it's awkward without one,” he said, and
passed on. Even then he seemed to
feel he had not done all he might, for,
turning round, he added with an air of
kindly consolation, “Still, you've got
your padlock and key, haven't you?”.

U 29.
By K 9.
I AM one of the unhappiest of
creatures, because I have been mis-
understood. Nothing is worse than to
mean well, and do all you can, and be
misunderstood beyond any possibility
of explanation. That is my tragedy
just now, and it all comes of having
four legs and no articulation when the
people who control things have only
two and can express themselves.
Sirius, how Iache! Butlet metell you.
I am a performing dog—nothing
more and nothing less. I belong to a
man named—but perhaps I had better
not give his name, as he might be
still more cross with me, especially
as he does not come too well out of
this story. And when I say I belong
to him I mean that I am one—the
principal one—of his troupe; but of
course I could leave at any moment if
I wanted to, and it is extremely likely
that I shall. I have merely to run off
the stage, out of the door, and he would
be done. I have not done so yet,
because hitherto he has treated me
quite decently, and I enjoy my per-
formance. I like to see all the happy
people in front, and watch their amazed
faces as I go through my wonderful
tricks. “Isn't it extraordinary 2” they
say to each other. “Almost human.
Fancy a dog doing that l” It amuses
me to hear things like that. We never
say, we dogs, that clever human beings
are almost canine. We know that to
be absurd; they would never be within
miles of being canine.
Anyway that is what I am—a very
brilliant performing dog, with a number
of quite remarkable tricks and the
capacity to perform as many again if
only my master would think it worth
while to add to his list. But so long
as there are so many music-halls where
his present performance is always a
novelty—and there are so many that he
could be in a different one every week
for the next ten years if he liked—why
should he worry himself to do anything
fresh 2 That is the argument he uses,
not being a real artist and enthusiast,
as I am, and as is one of my friends in
the troupe too. She, however, does
not come into this story.
I don't know whether you know
anything about music-halls, but it is
my privilege to be in one and perhaps
two every day, entertaining tired people,
and the custom now is, if any striking
news of the War arrives during the
evening, for one of the performers to
announce it. Naturally, for human
beings like being prominent and popu-
lar as much as dogs do, a performer is
the announcement. Applause is very
sweet to the ear, even if it is provoked
merely by stating the heroism of others,
and it is not difficult for anyone accus-
tomed to hear it to associate himself
with the action that has called it forth.
I feel that I am very rambling in my
remarks, but their point must be clearly
made, and that is that the privilege of
telling the audience about a great deed
just now is highly prized, and a per-
former who is foolish enough to miss.
the chance is stupid indeed.
I must now tell you that my master
is not the most sensible of men. It
was clever of him to become possessed
of so able an animal as myself and to
treat me so sensibly as to induce me to
stay with him and work for him; but
his cleverness stops there. In private
life he is really very silly, spending
all his time in talking and drinking
with other professionals (as they call
themselves), and boasting of the success
he has had at Wigan and Plymouth
and Perth and places like that, instead
of learning new jokes and allowing me
to do new tricks, as I should love to, for
I am tired of my present repertory and
only too conscious of my great powers.
It was on March 25th and we were
performing at a popular London hall;
and just as we were going on someone
brought the news of the sinking of
the U 29. I heard it distinctly, but
my master was so muzzy and pre-
occupied that, though he pulled himself
together sufficiently to say “Good busi-
ness ' " in reply, he did nothing else.
He failed to realise what a chance it
was for him to make a hit for himself.
Look at the situation. On the one
hand the audience longing to be cheered
up by such a piece of news, and on
the other a stupid performer too fresh
from a neighbouring bar to be able to
impart it or appreciate his luck in
having the opportunity of * it.
and bringing down the house. And
not only that. On the other hand there
was a keen patriotic British dog long-
ing to tell the news, but unable to
make all these blockheads understand,
because with all their boasted human
knowledge and brains they haven't yet
learned to know what dogs are talking
about. Would you believe it, my
master began his ancient patter just
as if nothing had happened 2 I tweaked
his leg, but all in vain. I snapped at
him, I snarled at him, to bring him to
his senses; but all in vain.
Then I took the thing into my own
aws. I ceased to pay him any atten-
tion. All I did was to stand at the
footlights facing the house and shout
out to the audience again and again,
“The U 29 has been sunk with all
said my master under his breath, “and
behave, or I'll give you the biggest
thrashing you ever had.” But I didn't
care. I remained by the footlights,
screaming out, “The U 29 has been
sunk with all hands !” “Mercy, how
the dog barks!” a lady in a box ex-
claimed. Bark! I wasn't barking. I
was disseminating the glad tidings.
“Silence, you brute!” my master
cried, and brought down his little whip
on my back. But I still kept on.
“They must know it, they must be
told !” I said to myself, and on I went
with the news until at last the stage-
manager rang down the curtain and
our turn was called off. But a second
later he was on the stage himself,
apologising for my conduct and telling
the audience about the U 29, and in
their excitement they forgot all about
their disappointment at not seeing me
perform. Their applause was terrific.
“See what you missed by your folly,”
I said to my master. But he paid no
attention, he merely set about giving
me the thrashing of my life.

I THINK I have mentioned Jessie as
a champion cup-crasher before. There
are people who can drop cups and
glasses without breaking them. Jessie
can break them without dropping them.
It is a gift, and she has it. She has other
gifts, including that of kindness to
Peter, and these have prevented our
side-tracking her so far.
Alison has tried to cure her by threats
of dismissal, but threats only encourage
Jessie to higher flights of smashing.
She knows by now the low breaking
strain of vegetable dishes to an ounce,
yet in her daily intercourse with these
utensils she cheerfully subjects them to
such stress as would shatter a brick.
With cups and saucers I think she must
practise secret jugglery in the pantry.
Every month-end, or nearly so, after
Alison has paid her wages, she says,
“Jessie really will have to go; two
more plates broken and another badly
cracked; ” or “The handle has been
knocked off the Lowestoft jug; Jessie
says she was dusting it, and it simply
dropped off; ” or “Poor Aunt Emily's

“I don't want you to find another

She's an image-breaker, an iconoclast.
I begin to suspect her of being of Ger-
man extraction. Give the girl an Iron
Cross and let her go.”
“You forget,” said Alison, “that she
is simply invaluable with Peter.”
“True,” I said, “she is kind to children.
Well, she shall have one more chance.”

Sunday passed off quietly. Jessie
spent her spare time knitting socks for
soldiers. My witticism about her
breaking the Sabbath was not so well
received as I thought it deserved.

ON THE SPY-TRAIL.
III.
THE man who transferred the “prize
bloodhound” to Jimmy met him one
day. “Hello, sonny,” said he, “what
luck did you have with the ‘what-is-
it 2 ” -
Jimmy showed him Faithful, who
was lying curled up on the ground.
“You don't mean to say so!" ex-
claimed the man. “A Persian, too!” He
then said, “Poor puss”—just like that,
you know—and put his hand down to
stroke Jimmy's bloodhound. Old Faith-
ful uncoiled slowly, saw the man's hand,
sniffed at it, didn't like it and so just
bit it to make it go away. Jimmy says
the man looked touched and a cloud
settled on his face; then he shot out
his foot towards Faithful. He was try-
ing to show Faithful how to do the
goose-step, Jimmy says.
The man recommended some dif-
ferent kinds of food for Jimmy's
bloodhound; you got them at the
chemist's and had to sign a paper for
them. He said that if Jimmy showed
Faithful to the chemist it would be all
right, he would quite understand.
Since then Jimmy has painted a sign
which tells you to beware of the dog.
The milkman told Jimmy he ought to
have another sign with “The Dog."
painted on it, and fix it round Faithful's
neck, so that there would be no
mistake.
One day, when Jimmy was going
to unchain his bloodhound and again
hurl him upon the spy trail, an incident
happened that would have quite un-
settled for serious work any but
a really well-trained sleuthhound. A
fierce chicken which belonged to the
man next door had broken loose and,
dashing through the hedge, had come
right up to where Faithful was chained.
Faithful was just finishing his break-
fast, and the chicken tried to wrest
from him a cold potato he was about
to tear to pieces.
Jimmy says the chicken growled at
Faithful and began opening and shut-
ting the feathers on its neck at him
like an umbrella. Jimmy says you
shouldn't do that to bloodhounds; it's
dangerous. It made Jimmy's blood-
hound pounce like anything, and every
time he pounced the chicken jumped
up in the air and waggled its feet right
at him. Once the chicken crowed
straight in Faithful's face. It was
awful, Jimmy says. Faithful without
any hesitation gathered himself together
and rushed behind his kennel to get a
good run at him, when the chicken
seized the potato with all its might.
Faithful kept leaping and straining

chickens, Jimmy says, but his slippers
wouldn't let him; they hadn't any

for something to throw. But there
were only the snowdrops, so he went
to the coalhouse as fast as his slippers

man got very excited and drew a re-

shouted, “Mad dog ' Mad dog!" as
hard as he could.
Jimmy says that people were looking
everywhere for the mad dog, and he
was glad he hadn't fixed that sign the
milkman told him of on to Faithful.
They had to tear the sausage from
Faithful's mouth because his fangs
were locked. The policeman was sur-

It was not the same kind of spy as
the other one Jimmy's bloodhound
tracked down; it was a naturalised
One.
Jimmy says they used Faithful as a
bit of evidence, and the policeman had
to swear he was a dog within the
meaning of the Act.
Jimmy says the man made bank-
notes as well as sausages—better, the
magistrate said. The man didn't want

he put them in a sausage skin, and

with Jimmy that he played him a tune
on his whistle.
Faithful followed all the policemen

EPISTOLARY FRENCH.
“Oh dear,” said Francesca in a tone of deep depression,
“I’ve got to write two letters in French.”
“It is,” I said, “a punishment for having wasted your
time in early youth. During the hours nominally devoted
to French you were thinking of hockey or bicycles or
poetry. Instead of attending to the irregular verbs you
were preparing a speech on the subjection of women. And
now you can't play hockey and you don't want to bicycle
and you're the despot of your household, but you can't
write the simplest letter in the French language without
groaning and tearing your hair.”
“All that,” she said, “is very eloquent, but it isn't very
helpful.”
“I do not pretend,” “I said, “to be a dictionary or a
phrase-book. Short of that, if there is anything I can do
you have only to appeal to my better nature and you will
find me bubbling over with French of the most idiomatic
kind. But tell me, to whom do you propose to write?"
“To Belgian refugees, of course. We must all do what
we can to help them, poor things.”
“Of course we must,” I said; “but do you think our
letters will help them much 2"
“Well, they want to know things and we're bound to
answer them.”
“Quite true,” I said; “but are you sure that our French
will help to reconcile them to living in England 2 Might
it not be of so English a quality that they would feel more
than ever that they were amongst strangers? Couldn't we
call in person and smile at them and say, 'Oh oui 'in a
friendly manner so as to make them think they're really at
home? I merely throw out the suggestion, you know.”
“You can leave it,” she said, “where you threw it. It's
no use to me. We've got to write these letters.”
“Very well,” I said, “let’s get to work. How shall we
begin?”
“‘Chère Madame' would be all right, wouldn't it?”
“‘Chére Madame' would be simply splendid if the lady
is married.”
“Married ?” said Francesca. “She has been married
twenty-four years and has had ten children.”
“No one,” I said, “could possibly be more worthy of all
that is implied in ‘Chére Madame." Let us put it down at
once before we forget it.”
“Anyhow,” said Francesca more cheerfully, “we’ve
started, and that's more than half the battle.”
“Francesca,” I said, “you never made a greater mistake
in your life. The beginning of a letter in French is, no
doubt, important, but it is the merest child's play compared
with the end. Are you going to ask this mother of ten
children simply to receive your salutations? Or dare you
soar still higher and pray her to be well willing to agree
the expression of your sentiments the most distinguished 2
Or to accept the assurance of your most high consideration 2
You think they're all pretty much the same, but they're
not. There are heavy shades of difference between them
and you can't help going wrong. Is it worth while to risk
exposing your ignorance to a lady who has been married
twenty-four years? Pause before it is too late.”
“Well,” said Francesca, “I can't help it. If ever I get so
far in this blessed letter I shall just make a dash for it and
ask her to agree whatever comes into my head first. It'll
probably be my distinguished sentiments, because I've
taken a fancy for that style. It's jolly to think one has
such sentiments.”
“All right,” I said, “have it your own way, but don't
blame me if when you next meet her your Belgian lady

“Hurrah!” I cried, “now we've got the middle of

Chère Madame,
Je vous enverrai le ramoneur.

do all we can to make them feel at home.”
“Well,” I said, “we could throw in a few words about
the weather.”
“But perhaps they don't worry about the weather in
Belgium.”
“Then it'll be something new for them. And you might
add some neat little sentence about hoping that the children |
are all in good health.”
“Neat little sentences,” said Francesca, “don't grow on

not inappropriate word. And this time you can finish up
with the assurance of your highest consideration.”

THE TRANSPORT SOLUTION.
“THE man you ought to see,” they
told me, “is the Transport Officer,
Southern Barracks.”
I found him seated in a large chair
in a small office. “I have come,” I
said, “to enlist your sympathy.”
“It is yours,” he replied, handing
me his cigarette-case.
“Also your assistance.”
“Ah!” he said sadly, and waved mo
to a seat. -
“Though not myself a military man,"
I continued, “I have for some time
past been working under the military
authorities, who are removing me next
month, with my wife, children, furniture
and other household effects, to a sphere
of usefulness on Salisbury Plain. For
purposes of furniture transport they
created for me some time ago a niche
in the Allowance Regulations, which
entitles me to free carriage of goods to
the amount, on my own account of one
ton, on that of my wife of 5 cwt., and
on that of each of my two children of
1 cwt.—a total of 1 ton 7 cwt. Our
united furniture, however, weighs in all
1 ton 7 cwt. 5 lb. On the other hand,
on the occasion of our last shift it only
ran to 1 ton 5 cwt. What I want to
know is, will the Transport people, in ||
consideration of the previous shortage,
include the extra 5 lbs. this time in the
move? Their net gain on the two
events would still be the carriage of
1 cwt. 107 lb.” - *
I drew a deep breath and leant back
in my chair.
He sighed, and for a while we smoked
in silence. Then he spoke,
“The fact is,” he said, “Transport is
not really my job. They have only
roped me in for it temporarily. Would
you mind if I called in my clerk 2"
“Not at all,” I answered.
He pressed a button and his sub-
ordinate appeared, a short, spare, dis-
agreeably intelligent-looking man.
“Er—would you mind–er—?” said
the Transport Officer to me.
I drew a second breath, a little deeper,
if anything, than the first, and re-stated
my case.
“What can we do for this gen-
tleman 2" asked the Transport Officer.
“Nothing, Sir,” said his clerk stonily.
“Can we send him to anybody else?"
“Yes, Sir, we can send him to—"
a peculiarly sinister expression flitted
across his face—“the A.A. and Q.M.G.
at the fort.” -
“Thank you,” I murmured.
“I was afraid,” I said, as the man
left the room, “that he was going to
mention another person, inhabiting a
less respectable locality."

port Officer thoughtfully, “that it!
doesn't come to much the same thing."
It took me half an hour to reach the
fort, situated at the summit of a long
hill, and another half-hour to reach the
A.A. and Q.M.G., situated at a massive
leather-topped table. There was no
suggestion, with this officer, of sym-
pathy or cigarettes. He had a very
brief manner.
“Yes,” he said, as I entered.
I stated my case.
“That all 2 ”
“Yes,” I answered; “can you man-
age it?”
“No."
At the door I paused and turned.
“I forgot to mention that I am pre-
pared, if necessary, to carry the matter
to the House of Lords.”
“What 2 ”
I repeated my remark.
“You’d better go and see the
O.C.A.S.C.," he said.
I descended the hill and finally
succeeded in discovering the official
habitat of the O.C.A.S.C. He was
out. Would he be in again? Probably.
When 2 Impossible to predict; would
I wait? I would wait. A clerk led
me gently into an inner room, placed
a Bradshaw near my hand, and left me.
As I perused the volume I grew
more and more surprised at the un-
-- circulation which
it enjoys. The plot is trivial; the
style, though terse and occasionally
epigrammatic, is unrelieved by dialogue
of any description; and it is impossible,
without keeping at least three fingers
in the index, to gain an adequate idea
of the doings of any of the characters.
After about an hour I rang the bell
and asked for an A.B.C. At the end
of the second hour I had committed
to memory the populations of all the
more important towns in the Home
Counties. Just as twilight fell the
clerk returned and told me that the

The O.C.A.S.C. ... was wandering
rather aimlessly about his office. “Did
you want to see me?" he asked
absently.
I stated my case.
“It's a most extraordinary thing !”
he exclaimed, coming at last to a
standstill.
“What?" I inquired.
“Where my matches get to,” he
replied. “I wonder if I might trouble
you just to help me find them 2 " . .
We took a long time over it, since
it had not occurred to him to look in
the right-hand pocket of his coat. At
length, however, I discovered them
there. He was very much obliged to
do for you?” he said. I re-stated my
case. He listened attentively. “I am
afraid,” he said, “that this will have
to be referred to the War Office. I
must ask you to put it in writing.” I
sat down and stated my case in writing.
“Thank you,” said the O.C.A.S.C.;
“I will communicate with you when
I hear their decision, which I hope
will be favourable.” → .
As I went out I saw him putting the
document carefully in the right-hand
pocket of his coat. • *.
A week passed, two weeks, three
weeks, but I did not hear from him.
Finally relief came from a quarter
which I had overlooked. I wrote at
once to the Transport Officer, the
“SIR,-With reference to our con-

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I MUST say that I found You Never Know Your Luck
(Hodder AND STOUGHTON) a great disappointment, the
greater from my previous pleasure in the work of
Sir GILBERT PARKER. I do not object to it as formless,
though it certainly is that, or as told in a confusing
haphazard style. My complaint is that a fairly effective
short story, based upon an unconvincing but mildly dramatic
situation, has been inflated to the dimensions of a novel.
For five pages of a magazine I might have been entertained
to hear how Crozier had run away from the just anger of
his wife, after breaking his promise not to bet; how she
wrote him an angry letter, which he kept unopened for
years (but there is no magazine published that could make
me believe that); how the wife had really had a bit on of
her own, and how, when she turned up to find Crozier
recovering from gunshots and stumped for want of the
ready, she steamed open the old envelope, put her own bet-
gotten gains therein, and pretended they had been waiting
there for him all the time. But as a grown-up book I
could hardly think that this justified its author's reputation
either in plot or characters. These last by the way have
been quite delightfully illustrated in colour by Mr. W. L.
JAcoBs, who might surely have been mentioned upon the
title-page. I am reminded, a little inconsequentially, of
the lady who liked BotticeLLI's Birth of Venus, all but
the central figure, which she found “rather a pity.” Re-
I can only call his latest story rather a pity. But there
may well be those to whom its appeal will be more success-
ful. After all, you never know other people's luck.
Mr. STEPHEN McKENNA must have been seriously
annoyed by the outbreak of a war that has swept away
the attention of his public from a subject in which he had
reason to suppose it was quite keenly interested. At the
same time I am not sure whether he has not something
for which to be thankful; for that atmosphere of hazy
distance that the curtain of the last eight months has
drawn over events even so crude in outline as the activities
of militant suffrage has converted into a moderately read-
able story what must otherwise have come perilously near
to being a succession of impertinences. There is so little
ambiguity about a date like 1913 that, but for this same
curtain, most of us could give a guess as to who was Prime
Minister and who Attorney-General at that time; and, on
learning that members of their families had been kidnapped
as a protest against the rejection of the Women's Suffrage
Amendment, could place within quite a small circle the
original of that brilliant criminal, Joyce, who planned the
abductions, and incidentally won the heart of Toby Merivale,
the narrator. We might even have begun to wonder how
much was history and how much semi-official aspiration
towards future achievement, instead of realising that the
author had no purpose more serious than the embellishment
of a yarn that should initiate tea-table discussion on the
possibilities of The Sixth Sense (CHAPMAN AND HALL). It

membering Sir GILBERT's distinguished work in the past,
would not be quite playing the game for me to say what is

that mysterious extra faculty with which the author has
endowed his deliberately effeminate hero, particularly as
neither of them seems to know much about it—and no
more do I, for that matter. It is enough if I hint that by
its timely aid a beauteous heroine is rescued from imprison-
ment at the hands of the militants, and a happy ending
assured. For further details I must refer you to Toby
Merivale.
Forlorn Adventurers (METHUEN) is a book with many
pleasant patches, but also a vast deal of what I can only
regard as padding. I am unable to believe that such clever
people as AGNEs and EGERTON CASTLE could not have told
so simple a tale more crisply if they had really wanted to
do so. Perhaps my irritation at having to plough through
a superfluous number of pages in pursuit of the slender
intrigue was intensified by the fact that they had been
bound up in a haphazard fashion that always worries me
beyond measure. But this by the way. . When the Master
of Stronaven lost his wife, by divorce, various meddling
relations set out to find him another, in the person of the
vacuous daughter of an Argen- – -
tine millionaire. Shortly after M.
their wedding, however, the ºl
Master developed heart disease, "
and, being bored with vacuity,
reconciled himself with wife ||
number one, and so died. I
am far from saying, that the ſy, 6
tale is badly told, but I do | ||Nº|
say that there are too many ||
scenes that retard instead of
helping the action. And upon
one point I must join issue
with the authors. I entirely
decline to believe that a
woman like Mrs. Duvenant,
who, in her progress from a - -
small shop to Connaught Place
vić the Argentine, had mas-
tered at least the elementary
rules of behaviour, would have
comported herself with such ‘’” -
ignorance and brutality in the house where her son-in-law
lay on his death-bed. So much for carping. Now let me
add that several of the subordinate characters are admirably
drawn, especially perhaps Lady Martindale (a portrait-
study, I should think, and a clever one). Also that the
Scotch and Italian setting is the real thing. But the fact
remains that the chief adventurers seem to have been too
forlorn for either myself or the EGERTON CASTLEs to have
been at our happiest in their society.
|
Owing, IT IS BELIEVED,
Despite her preface, which goes some way to disarm the
critic, I am bound to say that I think Miss CoNSTANCE
SMEDLEY would have been better advised to change the
title of her latest novel, On the Fighting Line (PUTNAM).
I am willing to believe that it was written before the War
—indeed the fact is obvious—but when all is said it
remains true that for us now there is only one battle, and
that subsidiary fighting lines merely exasperate. This, I
fear, has indeed been the abiding effect of the book upon
me; even its good qualities vexed me that they were not
better, and better employed. It is a record, in diary form,
of the emotions of a girl typist in a big City office. Dare
I confess that I rose from it with a feeling of profound
sympathy—for the office? Frankly, from almost every
point of view the diarist (who has various names, though

as unattractive. And most of her friends were even worse.
Perhaps in a way I was not wholly free from prejudice.
I can never keep a quite impartial mind about book-
heroines who make obviously literary records of their
emotions at the very instant of experiencing them.
Moreover, you will not have progressed very far in this
volume before you discover that, under a guise of sympa-
thetic neutrality, you are really (if a man) being held up
to ridicule because—you will never guess for what—because
you are severe upon ladies who destroy the contents of
pillar-boxes. There's a breath from the unregenerate past
for you! No. Though I hasten to admit some freshness
and charm about the week-end wooings of Jasmine and
her junior partner, the story as a whole remains what I
have called it above—exasperating, because it is about
types and ideas with which it is impossible in these big
days to feel more than a faint academic sympathy.
Mr. R. Scot1..AND LIDDELL, who gives us The Track of
the War (SIMPKIN, MARSHALL), has made a motor tour of
Belgium, chiefly in the company of a Belgian Red Cross
- officer, and has by his own
quiet modest showing put in a
gallant piece of work in the
matter of relief of the wounded
on the somewhat irresponsible
plan which the twain adopted,
working apparently under no
| orders but their own. If the
|book is not a completely satis-
factory addition to the serious
literature of the War it is
because the author does not
seem to possess a very judicial
mind. He writes in a natural
heat of indignation after seeing
the traces of German fright-
fulness; but the case in bulk
T – -
T-->==_2:… against the enemy , is so
unanswerable that what we
care never to weaken it by

unimpeachable evidence. Our author does not avoid such
phrases as “thousands of other instances,” nor make
allowance for the inevitable distortions of evidence given
originally by witnesses distracted with fear and hate, and
retailed at second and fifth hand in an unfamiliar
language. Mr. LIDDELL covers the terrible ground—
Dinant, Termonde, Aerschot, Andemne, Tamines—and quotes
freely the official documents of the Belgian commissions;
but adds, for instance in the case of recorded mutilations
for which evidence should be still attainable, no first-hand
personal testimony which would have given a special
significance to his book. It remains a piece of competent
but necessarily hurried journalism, not without a sense of
atmosphere, and should prove particularly valuable to
folk of sluggish imagination, like the Immortal who wrote
to Lord KITCHENER complaining about the taking off
of his favourite train, and the kind of person who still
counts it a disaster if the cook spoils the fish.
Describing the battle of the Falkland Islands The Great

Let me tell you first of all that I'm a Dutch Afrikander
and could prove my descent; and, secondly, let me assure
The incident opened our eyes, and we saw where our danger
lay. Did you really think that we, Dutchmen though we
are and stubbornly though we have fought against the
British, were going to haul down the Union Jack in order
to hoist the black, white and red of the German Empire in
its place; that we were going to try and chase the British
out of our country in order to let in a host of German soldiers
and officials; that, in fact, we meant to abandon our own
free institutions in order to live under the heel of the most
coercive tyranny that the world has ever seen 2 No, thank
you. We Dutchmen may have our moments of folly, but
we're not such fools as all that. We may lack imagination,
but then it doesn't require much imagination to realise
what your men have done to the Belgians, whom you were
solemnly pledged to protect. The stain on your nation is
indelible. Years and years hence, when a German wishes
to speak of honour and mercy, he will stammer and grow
pale, for the blood of the murdered Belgians will choke him
as the blood of DANTON choked Robespie RRE.
There's another point which I want to make clear to you.
You rail against the British and (until you meet them in
the field of battle) make light of their contemptible little
army, and all over Germany stout plethoric Germans and
their broad comfortable wives, when they meet one another
in the street, are begging the Almighty in a set formula to
punish England. The sausage tastes sweeter, the black
bread becomes almost white and the beer slips down more
easily when seasoned with this ceremonial declaration of
impotent hate. And in that temper you forget what
England did for us. She stood by her scrap of paper and
gave us free institutions. Then, when we were ripe for
union, she helped to bring us together and left us to build
up with our own hands the edifice of our united Govern-
ment. It isn't perfect, but it's ours, and we can improve
it as experience may suggest. We don't boast about it, but
we sometimes wonder what sort of institutions we should
have had in South Africa if the Master of Potsdam, with
his patent Prussian system for giving free expression to the
will of the people, had had power here instead of the
English, whom he begs God to punish for daring to throw
themselves across his path of conquest and domination.
So, you see, we're fighting now for our own, and we
mean to see the thing through. We are not unmindful of

Both A both as general and as statesman. We realise that

may be your power in South-West Africa. I daresay you
thought that in the Transvaal and the Free State the
memories of our fights with the British would be strong
enough to dispose us to range ourselves on your side in this
conflict. Well, we have not always loved the British
Government, nor have we always abstained from quarrelling
with our British neighbours. Some of our folk, too, have ||
nursed old grievances and recent slights until they thought
there was no other business in life, and they persuaded a
few hot-heads to join with them and sputtered out into
what was called a rebellion. We soon settled that, and we
settled it ourselves without help from outside, a feat which
should have earned for us at the very least a telegram of
congratulations from you. However, there was no message
—probably you were too much occupied in trampling on
the Belgians, and in any case I can't honestly say that we
and that the chestnuts were not to be for them. I wish
you could hear the language which they now use about you
and your endeavours. You Germans are now known by us
for what you really are. When you talk of liberty we
think of Alsace; when you praise your culture we counter
you with Louvain; and here in South Africa we are de-
termined to rid ourselves of your incubus.
Yours, on commando, PIET MARIS.

A CoRRESPONDENT, writing to. The

opening notes of the refrain of “Rule,

of this. The writer will, however, be

by the following letters:–

notes. But conceive my interest and
pleasure when, as I listened for a
repetition, there reached me instead
the first bars of that magnificent air,
Deutschland Uber Alles, with which the
bird had evidently been at consider-
able pains to familiarise itself. What

intelligent bird is entirely self-taught.”
DEAR SIR,-Perhaps you will allow
me to add my own experience to those
of your other Correspondents. A nest
of thrushes having recently been estab-

I have had frequent opportunities for
studying the behaviour of the occu-

note that on the morning after the fall
of Przemysl the parent bird, varying its
usual attitude and monotonous call,
perched on the edge of the nest and
whistled the whole of the Russian
National Anthem with quite remarkable
finish. I was even more struck by the
conduct of the young birds, who, though
still unsteady upon their legs, rose simul-

DEAR CHARLEs, We've just paid a
flying visit to the trenches. Having
nothing better to do, we made our way
to the place where the noise is and, in
batches, spent a couple of nights with
the Umpty Umpths in their eligible
residential villas known as Cheyne
Walk. To get there from the billets
you take the high road from Qu'est
que c'est que ga to Cela va sans dire and
keep on with it until the machine guns
open up on your left flank. You then
take a sharp turn to the right, until you
observe the beam of a searchlight
playing across the field in front of you.
You then lie flat on the ground and
behind you fall into the same hole and
use the same suppressed but disgraceful
expression with regard to it.
“It is a scandal,” you tell the guide
in an indignant whisper as you fix your
arms round his neck even more affec-
tionately than before, “it is a scandal,
the shocking state of repair in which
French turnip fields are kept. Where
are the police, where the gendarmerie,
where the writers of letters to The
Times 2 In an English field such holes
would never be allowed.”
He explains that it isn't a hole, it's a
trench, and may he have his neck to
himself for a bit? You relax your hold
and examine the spot to which he has
brought you. Felicitating him upon
the ingenuity with which one tortuous

cocoa, you have just got to go without,
because it is now getting on for dawn
and your cup (there is only one) is
required for your early morning tea.
You then settle down as best you can
to a wee drappie of whisky from a
flask (his) just to keep off your ravaging
thirst. And all the time the bullets
go pit-a-pat, and no one seems to care
as long as there's water boiling for
the next brew.
Stepping down the trench to see the
sights, you discover the men employed
in the constant and reprehensible habit
of tea-drinking. The sentries lean
against the parapet with their backs to
pretend you are not in France
at all, and when the searchlight
has come to the conclusion that,
wherever you are, you are not
worth bothering about, you get
up and go on, keeping the search-
light well on your right, the
machine gun well on your left,
and stepping decorously out of
the path of any sniper's bullet
which happens to be passing.
Proceeding quietly but quickly
along the line of least resist-
ance, you are suddenly con-
fronted by a figure emerging
from the dark, who tells you
to halt or he 'll fire. “Et tu,
Brute 1” you murmur reproach-
fully, as you halt and wonder to
yourself why it is that you have
suddenly become so unpopular.
The figure says his name isn't
IBrutus, but that he is come
from the trench to guide you to
it, and thereupon you throw
your arms round his neck, which

now and then they loose off
their rifles into the dim beyond,
not in any real hope of hitting

he comes on duty, “It is I, Fritz,

shout out the latest information

cause they recollect his buns,

he takes to mean that you love him and
wish never to be parted from him. As
to the love, that all depends; you’ll be
better able to say in the morning when
you've seen him in the daylight, but as
to the sticking together he is well on
the right side there.
“And now,” you say, “what about

towards it? We love being out here in
the open, but we feel we oughtn't to
keep your friends sitting up all night
for us.” He is inclined to be discursive
and to go through a list of the casualties
which have occurred at the very spot
whereon you stand. He then tells you
to follow him, and suddenly disappears.
Seeing that there are now search-
lights and machine guns in all di-
rections, it doesn't much matter which

then go along with him to settle your

done this for themselves and are already
giving valuable advice to the occupants
of the place as to how trench-fighting

THE wave of patriotic teetotalism
which is washing over the country is
certain to bring out a new crop of those
non-alcoholic beverages which are so
far more delightful and exhilarating than
the genuine articles which they counter-

BLANCHE'S LETTERS.
A RECRUITING CAMPAIGN.
Curfew Hall,
Nr. Puddlebury Parva.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--I've been put-
ting in a most strenuous Easter here!
When I invited a houseful of people I
added as a P.S., “N.B.-Recruiting.”
And we’ve worked like niggers. My
own success has been colossal. In the
nickiest of khaki-coloured tailor-mades,
with a darling little semi-military cap
with a bunch of ribbons, just like a
real recruiting officer's, I've made the
round of all the neighbouring villages—
Puddlebury Parva, Much Gapington,
and ever so many more, and have
pulled in recruits grandly 1 “Now,” I
said to the young natives standing
about the village streets, “you boys
have get-to leave—your hedging or your
digging, or whatever it is you do, and
offer yourselves to your country. I'm
quite quite sure big, strong, brave fel-
lows like you aren't going to stand by
while other men do your fighting for
you! So come along with me at once
to the recruiting-office l’ And they
shuffled about and gurgled in their
throats and nudged each other and
grinned—but they came along !
If you've done nothing of this kind,
my Daphne, you can't imagine what a
comfy little thrill it gives one to feel
one's been the means of turning a
slouch and a cloth-cap and a gurgle
into a brisk soldier-laddie! The fly in
the ointment has been that Beryl and
Babs would persist in claiming some of
my recruits as theirs. Things might
have got a bit difficult, only I was very
forbearing with them. “What's it
matter who pulls them in so long as
they are pulled in 2" I said. “Though
at the same time you must both know
in your hearts that I've got quite three
times as many as either of you.”
In the evenings we've been giving
little recruiting concerts in the various
villages; charming little affairs, with a
recruiting-office at the side of the plat-
form, and the best seats given to those
who went and offered themselves before
the concert began. I sang patriotic
songs, draped in a flag. Beryl and
Babs gave a fencing turn. Clarges
gave his “Farmyard Imitations.” I
don't say that I should have known
what animals he was imitating, but he
told us each time, so that was all right.
The Rector of Much Gapington, a dear
man with quite a little reputation as
an amateur conjurer, did some of his
most wonderful tricks, and, though his
hand certainly seemed a little out once
or twice and he dropped several things
that weren't meant to be dropped,
Ramsgate, in a soft muslin frock with
a red-white-and-blue sash and her hair
in ringlets, read a long interesting letter
from her grandson, Pegwell, at the
Front.
But the plat de résistance was Norty's
“Adventures of a Flying Man in War
Time.”
He's a flight-commander now, and
was my guest of honour while his
Easter leave lasted; but oh my dear
friend, what do you, do you think?
When I first saw him I shrieked and
had to have bromide and veronal. He's
grown a (I feel as if I couldn't write
it () — a beard, Daphne !! “I knew
you'd jib at it, Blanche,” he said, “but
going up so high we have to grow 'em.
Knitting's not good enough. Flying
men must grow their own mufflers.
I promise you, however, that I’ll shave
it off again when the War's over.”
“When the War's over !” I screamed.
“By that time the horrible thing will
be down to your waist, and I'll be dead
of a broken heart!” And then Beryl
weighed in with one of her very own
speeches: “I thought you liked beards,
dear Blanche. Your husband wears
one.” I kept calm. “It happens to
suit Josiah,” was all I said.
By the way, Josiah is really beginning
to come home at last now that the seas
are clear down there. His adventures,
my dear, since he went away last July
to look after rubber concessions at
the other end of the world ! A little
trading vessel on which he made one
of his efforts to come back caught fire,
and they all took to the boats, and
Josiah was in a small one by himself,
and he drifted on till he came to an
island that's not on any map, and
there he's been living among palms
and cocoa-nuts and natives and fearful
things of that kind, and he never knew
from one day to another whether they
would end by eating him or making
him their king (he's not sure which
would have been the worse fate 1). As
far as I can make out his writing, he
calls them the Boldoreens. They are
about the only real, old-fashioned
natives left anywhere now ! Their hair
is long and stiff and stands straight up
from their heads; their dress consists
of a little sea-weed (which sounds dis-
tinctly charming for a summer toilette),
and their money is the leaves of a
particular sort of bush. They're quite
nice and kind till you offend them, and
then they eat you! . The fact that
Josiah is able to come back proves that
he has more tact than I gave him
credit for. Daily Thrills and Daily
Tidings have both cabled him asking
for exclusive rights in the Boldoreens
and his adventures. They've even
Josiah has secured a photo of the Head
Boldereen the Daily Thrills' man be-
came almost rabid I've already
arranged a series of “Social Lecture-
Chats”—Thursdays in May — Har-
monic Hall—a song or two—tea and
coffee—and Josiah to tell about the
Boldoreens to a soft, running piano
accompaniment. Tickets, five shillings
each, the money to go to the War funds.
I feel sure it will be a big thing, and
will fetch ces autres in crowds.
D'you know, my dearest, I don't
consider that women's wits are being
sufficiently used in this War. I don't
claim that we ought to have a hand in
strategy and large things of that kind,
or that we're able to make great big
inventions (like Lord Newton, you
know, who first thought of locomo-
tives through seeing an apple fall off
a tree), but I do claim that some of us
are very sharp and think of quite a
number of things. You guess what's
coming? Yes, your Blanche has
thought of something — somethin
that would end this wretched block-
ade in a few days' Let some ships
go out trailing things that would act
as magnets to submarines, so that they
would fly to them and stick to them in
spite of themselves. Then let the ships
come back to port with a lot of U-boats
stuck fast to the magnets—et voilà 1
Of course the point is to find out just
what would act as a magnet to sub-
marines (Norty suggested a lump of
copper or a bag of iron crosses, but
that was only par plaisanterie). Any-
how, I shall lay my idea before the
Admiralty, and leave them to find out
the right kind of magnet.
Ever thine, BLANCHE.
P.S.—The new skirt has revived a
lost art. Before I left town Fallalerie's
was crowded every afternoon with
people learning to walk again. I got
hold of it quicker than any of them.

THE next masterpiece to be given by

Sunday evening will be Dyspepsia, a
Tragedy in Three Acts, of which those
who know speak remarkably highly.

character, is laid “on the alimentary

cast has been engaged, amongst them
Miss HILDA TREVELYAN, who will ap-
pear in the somewhat Wendyish part of
Pepsine, a little Peacemaker. We gather
that the efforts of this benevolent per-
sonage are unsuccessful, as in the Third
Act we are promised a highly sensa-
tional scene in which Curried Lobster

Melba (Miss MIRIAM LEwis) to stir the
other characters to revolution.
The full cast of Out of the Pit, the

LIFE-SAVING AT SEA.
THE publication of a Navy Supple-
ment in his present issue furnishes
Mr. Punch with an excuse for appeal-
ing on behalf of a cause—closely asso-
ciated with our sea-service—which is
liable to be overlooked among the many
claims that the War makes upon his
readers. It is the cause of the Royal
National Life-boat Association. The
extinction of lights and beacons, the
removal of buoys, and the presence in
many unascertained spots of floating
mines have enormously increased the
dangers to shipping and added yet
further risks to the hazardous work of
our Life-boatmen. Since the beginning
of the War our Life-boats have on over
60 occasions rendered service to Cruisers,
Torpedo Boats, Military Transports,
Mine Sweepers, Submarines, etc., and
216 lives were saved from these vessels
up to the end of last year. The
assistance given to the hospital-ship
Rohilla involved the complete loss of
one Life-boat and serious damage to
three others. The total additional cost
to over £6,000. No grant whatever is
received from the Government, and the
whole work of the Life-boat Institution,
entailing an expenditure of about
£112,000 a year, is supported entirely
by Voluntary Contributions.
Subscriptions, greatly needed, should
be addressed to The Royal National
Life-boat Institution, 22, Charing Cross
Road, London, W.C.

“A number of poor children, some of them
shoeless, had got on to the pavement outside
the awning, and as Queen Alexandra ap-
proached they pushed their heads under the
canvas to get a better view. Her Majesty was
much amused, and, stooping down, patted
some of the heads.”—Times.
“As soon as Queen Alexandra arrived she
noticed some little dogs poking their heads
under the awning, and she laughed and stooped
down to pat them.”—Evening News.
Personally we prefer The Times' version
of the incident.

(By our Spring Poet.)
THE moon, dismantled and forlorn,
Down to the nadir drops;
The amber oriflamme of morn
Flaunts on the mountain tops;
And sybaritic airs that come
From far translunar shores
Bring wafts of fragrant galbanum
And melting madrepores.
The catkin warbles in the brake,
The pipit pours its lay;
The polyanthus seems to make
Perpetual holiday;
The owl his limber jerkin dons
To brave the heats of noon,
And panoplied in living bronze
Darts o'er the dim lagoon.
Lithe caterpillars gently toss
Their velvet curves on high,
And lend a choriambic gloss
To mature's revelry;
While rhadamanthine shapes afloat
In fields of asphodel
From holophote to holophote

Proclaim that all is well.

THE DURATION OF THE PEACE.
(With acknowledgments to Mr. HILAIRE
BELLoc.)
THE first question which every one
naturally asks his favourite oracle about
the present political truce is: How long
is it likely to last 2 Before entering
upon this subject, however, let me utter
a word of warning. To attempt to
estimate the duration of any peace
whatever is folly, unless you are the
belligerent who puts an end to it. This
is a folly into which European countries,
with the exception of Germany, very
conspicuously fell last year. There is
no reason why we should imitate their
errors by suggesting any period as the
“end” of this state of peace. No
hazardous conclusion at all upon the
subject will therefore be attempted.
either of these is admitted, the discussion
must at once cease; otherwise it can
continue till the point of exhaustion is
reached.
If we eliminate these disturbing
factors there remain two great alterna-
tives. Either one of the opponents will
break the truce, or the truce will continue.
I dogmatise upon neither, I merely
state them. It is only in the second
alternative that any plausible pretext
for discussing the duration of the peace
can be offered. To resolve the Oppo-
sition into its elements is too simple.
It leads nowhere. Let us then make,
in the fullest possible detail, a broad
survey of all even remotely connected
side-issues, based upon the widest and
vaguest generalizations.
1.—There is first the complete con-
fidence of human nature in the certitude
no one living out of an Irish atmo-
sphere can foresee. Further, there is
the question, Will that monument of
|art and treasure of antiquity, the
Eisteddfod, lure the Welsh to sacrifice
a cherished plan of campaign, or will it
incline them buoyantly to resume the
offensive 2
With regard to the first let us dis-
abuse our minds of the falsehood that
criticism proceeds not from emotion,
but from reasoned judgment. Manias
are the most potent and least doubtful
of all the motives which affect us in
this country; hence those extraordinary
proposals, reiterated for some mystic
and incalculable reason, which reappear
at regular intervals. The judicial mind
may be dismissed as a legal fiction.
But Conscriptionists are a reality; so
are retired Admirals; so are Whole-
The doubt that at once
occurs is this. If the
matter is not susceptible of
calculation; if the vaguest
attempt at prophecy is
gratuitous folly; and if
even the wildest guess-
work has no finality, is
the subject really suitable
for discussion in these
columns?
Now in the first place
there is all the difference
in the world between dis-
cussing a matter and reach-
ing any conclusion upon it.
All I am trying to do in
these notes is to indicate
a critical moment, round
or about or after which
period, if hostilities begin
again, the end of peace
“PLEASE will YER. Do Us A BIT o' DRILL, SIR, 'cos IT's BERTRAM's
BIRFDAY 2''
Hoggers and Spy-hunters
and Aniline-Dyers; and
so is the fact that the
natural life of this Parlia-
ment comes to an end after
another six months. More-
over grievances cannot
withstand the process of
“accretion” for more than
a certain time at a certain
rate, whatever their ori-
ginal magnitude.
To sum up, then, if we
consider only the ele-
ment of unemployed
superiority, and the strain
imposed by time, the argu-
ment would seem to
point to a peace of shorter
rather than of longer
duration.
will be in sight, though even after this
disaster a state of truce might technically
remain. In order to do this, I am com-
pelled to reiterate arguments which I
have used so often before that I am
almost ashamed to recur to them, but I
feel that italicised insistence on the
obvious can create an effect when no-
thing else can. .
Moreover I hope to show that, as the
end of the winter is now at hand, and
| as that moment coincides with the be-
| ginning of spring, when unexpected
accidents might conceivably happen,
the days through which we are now
passing are exactly the right time to fill
in with indeterminate discussions.
Before proceeding to my calculations,
however, two really relevant topics
must first be eliminated. There is the
improbable contingency that the Allies
might unexpectedly declare peace, and
the only less improbable contingency
that the Government, in its desire for
efficiency, might take the Opposition to
or rather the necessity of its own right
judgment; and the presumption that
master strokes of strategy and politics
will constantly occur to private mem-
bers which would never cross the minds
of our statesmen or generals. I adduce
no evidence for this; I have heard it
and I believe it.
2.—There is secondly our knowledge
of the character of Labour and Capital.
Both these are psychological factors
which provoke continual, though, alas !
restricted discussion.
3.—There is thirdly the element of
Geography. This must be expressed in
terms of Celt and Cymry. The number
of Irish Members who are in the flower
of what is generally but very loosely
termed their “fighting age" can only
be determined by eliminating those
who are dead or mad or run over by
traction engines. Whatever their mood
to-day, or the chance of its changing
to-morrow, the only certainty is that
something unexpected may be con-
But this is only one line
of argument. I propose to show that
it is entirely stultified by the other
two, with which I hope to deal at
length next week.

THE SUFFERINGS OF SHAW.
[According to the author of a new book on
Socrates, Mr. BERNARD SHAw, like the
Athenian philosopher, is an intellectualist
whose “crime is ideas” and whose “pro-
foundly moral aim" is misunderstood by the
British bourgeoisie.]
How strange it is that modern scribes,
obsessed
By slight and superficial similarities,
Should damnify our goodliest and best
By disregarding radical disparities;
Till, waxing wanton in their futile
quest
Of parallels to obsolete barbarities,
They add the final and back-breaking
straw
By linking Socrates with BERNARD
SHAw.
Old Soc., benighted soul, had never
learned
To keep the soldier on his proper
plane,
As one who in all history has earned
The meed of intellectual disdain ;
Nay worse, himself with martial zeal
had burned
And served the State in many a hard
campaign,
Content at Athens' call to shed his
blood
Instead of pelting her with well-aimed
mud. -
His nose was snub, his features blunt
and rough,
His figure was uncouth, his legs
were bandy;
He was not fit to photo in the buff—
The latest foible of the super-dandy;
He did not dress in hygienic stuff
Or live on cocoa, beans and sugar
candy;
He never owned a car, and when it
froze
Walked cheerfully upon his ten bare
toes.
He never wrote a novel or a play,
Though other playwrights pitilessly
guyed him;
He never boomed himself, but lives
to-day
Because a certain PLATO glorified him
(As BAcon in his self-effacing way
Allowed a pushing mime to override
him);
But all the time the actual Simon Pure
Was commonplace, illiterate and
obscure.
He taught philosophy, but took no
fees;
He wrote no tracts in praise of
hostile nations;
Abstemious as a rule, he could with
ease
Compete in the amount of his
potations

WAR-TIME VIGNETTES.
CHEz LE PHOTOGRAPHE.
I HAD entrusted Madame Olive with
my precious snapshots. She was the
only photographer in Dunkirk who
would promise to develop them tout
de suite. When I called at the shop I
found the little birdlike creature the
centre of a clamorous crowd. Madame
was talking hurriedly in a high-pitched
voice. “Oui, oui, it will be ready in-
stantly.” “But I must have it now,”
urged a uniformed official. “It is for
my carte d'identité and I have a
train to catch.” “Oui, oui, dans un
instant.” . *
“Where are my proofs 2 They were
promised a fortnight ago.” “I will
send them round to you, Mademoiselle.”
“So you said yesterday—no, I'll
wait here.” “Três bien, très bien.” “Or,
sont nos portraits 2" two old souls
asked simultaneously. “Are my films
ready?" I ventured. “Oui, oui, come
down and look at them.” - Madame
seized the opportunity to escape. She
drew aside a curtain that divided the
studio from the shop. A photographer
was posing a workman against a back-
ground representing the Garden of Ver-
sailles. The man was leaning against
a waterfall and facing the camera with
a beatific smile. Madame disappeared
through the minutest of doors down a
spiral staircase. “This way,” she
cried, and led me into a cupboard.
“This is my developing room—look,
I have all these plates to develop.”
“Show me my films,” I urged. “But
I'm just going to do them. Oh where
—oh where did I put your kodak 2"
“But you said they would be done.”
“How could they be done? You saw
how many people were in the shop.
Now I wonder what I did with it 2 lt
can't have been your kodak that fell
down the stairs. Ah, no, here it is.
Now I switch on the red light. There,
you see, I put them in the liquid and
work them about.”
“Madame, madame,” came a voice
from beyond, “Monsieur wants his
picture for his carte d'identité.” “Yes,
yes, tell him it will be ready in a
minute. Where is the plate?” “It
is in the little yellow box.” “Três bien,
trés bien; I wonder what has happened
to that yellow box” There, now, I
leave your films to soak whilst I do
some others. See, here is a picture of
Granny and Grandpa. It's a pity
she's so blurry, and it would have been
better if his other shoulder had been in
the picture. They should have stood
in the centre instead of one at each
edge. But then they've been married
a long time. Engaged couples are
“Madame, madame, Monsieur is get-
ting impatient for his carte d'identité."
“Tell him it's just being finished. Oh
dear, oh dear, where can it be 2 " “In
the little yellow box, Madame.” “But
where is the little yellow box2 Ah,
mon Dieu, mon Dieu, what a life! There,
look, yours are coming out. They are
going to be excellent. Look at this
lady. She's dreadfully smudged—did
you ever see such a face? She'll be
furious; but in war-time—que woulez-

d' identité.” “Ah, mon Dieu, mon Dieu,
there they are again. Why can't he
be patient? Where is the yellow box2
Parbleu, it's in my pocket. Tell him
you are bringing it up. There, if that
isn't vexing; there's something wrong
with the plate. He'll have to be done
again; nobody could possibly recognise
him. Ah, but then it's only for his
carte d'identité. What, he says his train
has gone? Oh, well, he can have an-
other sitting. He won't 2 Well, as long
as he's satisfied.”
“I'd rather develop the photos down
here than interview the people up-
stairs,” I remarked. “Yes, yes, they
are so exigent. If you leave your films
till to-morrow I will print you some
copies.” Madame seized the tray and
we went back into the shop. A new-
comer, a sullen and terribly stout
woman, had taken her place by the
counter. “I have come for my enlarge-
ment,” she grunted. “Oui, oui, Ma-
dame — it's not back from Paris.”
“You’ve had it four months.” “Que
woulez-vous, Madame 2 C'est la guerre.”
“Where is the original?” “Some-
where here in the shop.” “But how
can they do the enlargement in Paris
if the original is here?” “Oh, Madame,
I really can't explain—you wouldn't
understand if I did.” “I’ll never come
here again. I only came because my
family recommended me to come.”
“Ah, vous voyez—we have always
given them satisfaction. Are we to
blame for the War? Madame here of
the Croix Rouge will tell you how im-
possible it is to get anything from
Paris.” “Yes,” I assented, “it would
be difficult at present to get you en-
larged.” “Qu'est-ce que je vous ai dit 2
and you wouldn't believe me.” Ma-
dame cast an indignant glance at the
fat one, who waddled resentfully out of
the shop.
She collided in the doorway with a
young woman, and after some mutual
recriminations Madame was again
faced by an angry customer. This time
it was a young washerwoman with a
brick-red face and a shawl drawn across
her ample chest. “You have given
mon mari the wrong bebé—this is not
little girl.” “Indeed it isn't,” Madame
objected strenuously; “it is your little
Albert; he wouldn't stay quiet—que
woulez-vous 2—his face is a little hazy.”
“I tell you it isn't my Albert; he has a
curly head.” “Well, it was straight
when he came here last week. I re-
member quite well saying to your mari
it was a pity his hair didn't curl.”
“But the dress—I tell you Albert was
breeched.” Madame lifted her eyebrows
with an air of exasperation. “What
have I to do with that 2 The kodak
tells no lies; but if you are dissatisfied
cherchez vous-même.” She handed a
large drawerful of postcard photo-
graphs to the mother. The woman
fingered them eagerly, pulling out all
the pictures of babies and putting them
on one side. “La, la, l have found my
bébé,” she cried. “Qu'est-ce que je
vous ai dit * The other was not my
Albert.” She hurried out, clutching a
picture-postcard. Madame shrugged
her shoulders. “They generally choose
that one,” she said. “It is the picture
of my little nephew Charles. Her little
Albert's plate was broken. Mais qu'est-
ce qu'on peut? C'est la guerre. Come
back to-morrow, Madame, and I will
have your pictures printed for you.”
The next day was Sunday. The shop
was crowded with people disputing
their turn to be photographed. The
girl behind the counter turned a tearful
face to me. “I’ll never give them
numbers again,” she said. “I don't
care how muddled they get; Madame
blames me quite unfairly.” “Can you
give me my films?" I interposed
meekly. “It's not fair,” she sniffled;
“that marine was number 54 and --
I turned to Madame. “You promised
to print me some copies.” “Marie,
Marie, what have you done with the
films of Madame of the Croix Rouge?"
Marie began hastily to search the
drawer. “Is this it 2" she asked, show-
ing me a picture of two burly soldiers
arm-in-arm. I shook my head. “I
think it must be yours,” declared
Madame. “But my snapshots were
views,” I objected. “One never knows
how things will turn out with ama-
teurs,” said Madame. “Don't you re-

scratched her head in perplexity. “Ah,

PUTTEES.
“PUTTEEs,” I said to Shopwalker
No. 1, who had bowed himself into a
note of interrogation.
“Puttees,” shouted Shopwalker No. 1.
“Puttees,” said Shopwalker No. 2.
“Puttees,” Shopwalker No. 3 whis-
pered confidentially into my ear. He
led me by devious routes to a place
bristling with military trimmings.
“Puttees,” shouted Shopwalker No. 3
in a voice that brought me instinctively
to attention and caused a timid-looking
man to drop six boxes of boots. These
shopwalkers ought to be at the Front.
They would be invaluable as connecting
files.
“Puttees?” murmured the timid man.
“Puttees is the word, and I said it
first—the things you twist on to your
legs,” I said.
“That would be puttees, Sir. What
price?”
“Are there different prices for
puttees?”
“From two shillings to twelve-and-
six.”
“What makes the difference?”
“The quality and the shape. There
This didn't sound altogether un-
reasonable, as different people have
different shaped calves. However, no
man's calves—not even Bailey's—are
entirely straight or wholly spiral, so I
said, “I think that I would like some-
thing between the two to suit a normal
leg.”
“It isn't so much the shape of the
leg as the shape of the puttees that
matters. I'm afraid there's no inter-
mediate shape.”
“I suppose both shapes go on 2"
“Yes, they both go on,” he said
hesitatingly; “and they do say that the
spiral ones stay on. I don't rightly
know—I don't profess to understand
puttees—I'm really a boot man. I see
our Expert is disengaged now, he will
talk puttees to you.”
The Expert told me all about puttees.
I didn't understand any of it then and
I don't understand all of it now. I
gathered that puttees aren't the simple-
minded things they look, and that I
had better purchase the more expensive
and amenable kind, known as the
spiral. I had no wish to be parsi-
monious over the finishing touches to
my uniform, so I agreed to the man's
tº-on-tag

“What colour?" asked the Expert.
“The pretty greeny-greyish tint that
is so much in vogue with the Volun-
teers.”
“I'm sorry, we're out of the spirals
in that colour. I've just sold the last
pair, and there isn't another pair to be
bought in London.”
“Is there any chance of the khaki
colour fading to our tint 2"
“Our puttees do not fade.”
I knew that if my legs were the
wrong colour they would catch the eye
of the Sergeant-Major and I should be
in perpetual trouble; yet I misdoubted
the straight variety and tried to com-
promise. “I'll take one of the two-
shilling straight kind, and if I get on
with it all right I'll come back and buy
its mate.”
“We only sell them in pairs.”
I offered to recommend the odd one
to a one-legged man of my acquaint-
ance if I didn't want it, but he wouldn't
break the set.
In the end I bought a straight pair
and have lost about five pounds' weight
in consequence. If nature had known

part of the leg at the lower end. She
would have had to sacrifice a certain
amount of elegance to utility, but, as it
is, she has done that in some cases,
though Bailey won't admit it. I don't
suggest that my puttees would look
neat if I were to wear my legs the
wrong way up, but I do think that
the puttees would stand more chance
of staying up and that the bulgy parts
would be more useful for carrying my
lunch, gloves and cigarettes.
The Expert told me that I ought to
turn the things over like a bandage.
I've been practising it and have dis-
covered why so many military men
marry hospital nurses. Up to date º
record is two-and-a-half twists before

the last three Sunday parades owing to
puttee troubles. I got up extra early
last Sunday and had ten goes before I
lost my train.
I've consulted the Sergeant-major,
and he says if I don't care to wear my
puttees round my ankles like the other
men I must stay off parade. I've
tried to get permission to wear a pair
of pants painted with a spiral dado or
frieze to look like puttees, but this has
been ruled out of order. However,
there's a rumour that the Adjutant's
wife is going to start puttee classes,
so all may yet be well.
THE LABYRINTH.
FoR some weeks I had been feeling
anxious about Peters. A man of
sanguine temperament, he had, though
unmarried, always preserved till a short
time ago a singularly cheerful outlook
on existence. But about the beginning
of the year a change came over him.
He grew silent and preoccupied.
Frequently he travelled down from
Town with the rest of us without so
much as opening his mouth, he who
had been the life and soul of the 5.30.
His cheeks, too, lost their rosy colour,
and his clothes began to look as if they
had been made for somebody else.
The climax came when I saw him
one evening, in a fit of deeper abstrac-
tion than usual, attempt to enter the
guard's van at Liverpool Street in
mistake for his own compartment.
The guard took him gently by the arm
and led him to where I was seated, as
it chanced, alone.
“This is your carriage, Sir.”
Peters woke from his reverie. “Ah,
yes, of course,” he said, “my mistake.
Very good of you, I'm sure; ” and
taking a sovereign from his pocket he
pressed it into the guard's hand. The
latter started, but, regaining in an
instant the admirable self-possession
ible of our railway officials, reverently
touched his hat and walked away.
The incident shocked me; obviously
there was something very wrong with
Peters. As soon as we were clear of
the station I asked him point blank
what was the matter. He turned a
dull eye upon me and for a moment or
two made no reply. Then he said in
a strained voice, “Come round to my
house to-night and I will tell you.”
We finished the journey in silence.
“I’m glad you have come,” said
Peters at 9.30. “I couldn't have gone
on much longer without speaking to
someone about it.” As he leaned
forwards over the fire I noticed with
pain the pallor of his face and the
nervous twitching of his hands.
“When the War broke out,” he went
on after a short pause, “I tried to join
the army, but they ploughed me in the
sight test, though I read the card with-
out a hitch.”
“But that 's absurd ' " I exclaimed.
He smiled sadly. “It was just bad
luck. Carruthers had passed very
successfully in the morning, and as I
knew he could see through a brick wall
I had asked him to memorise the letters
for me. Unfortunately they changed
the target in the afternoon. It was a
low thing to do, but, at any rate, it
settled me. Somehow or other, though,
I couldn't get back again into the old
groove. I wanted to be actually doing
something, you understand. I didn't
care what it was so long as it was
something. Finally I wrote and con-
sulted my brother-in-law, who is a
parson in Bradford. He sent me back
by return two pounds of grey wool,
four bone needles and a book called
The Knitter's Companion.”
He stopped and gazed moodily into
the fire for a few seconds. “How I
cursed that book | Mind you, I don't
blame my brother-in-law. He has
spent the whole of his life in a town
where the inhabitants breathe wool
from the cradle and are inured to
knitting of the most intricate designs.
Probably he never realised the danger
to which he was exposing me. He
wrote: “Try pattern Number 29 first,
and send to me when completed. I
will add it to our next monthly parcel
for the troops.’ I turned up Number 29.
It was an airman's helmet. The printed
directions said, “Cast on 156.’ It
seemed a simple thing to do, but though
I read the whole book through I could
discover no instructions on the point.
Next day I bought in Oxford Street
a little volume entitled, How to Knit,
by One who has dome it. I studied
this for three nights, and a week later
I had cast on 156. That was the
| and locked the door on it.
“The next direction was, ‘Knit 12 rows
plain.” This I managed fairly well,
though when I got to the 12th row I
found only 95 stitches on the needles.
Then the book said, “13, knit 3, purl2;
14, knit 2, purl 3; 15, knit plain row;
16, knit purl row; repeat the last 4 rows
8 times, decreasing at beginning and
end of every 4th row and being careful
to keep the pattern straight.' Since
then my life has been a hideous dream.
I would not give in. Night after night
I locked myself in this room and
struggled with it, and night after night
the thing grew. What it was growing
into I dared not guess, but it never had
the appearance of a helmet. At last it
began to frighten me, and to avoid
looking at it I pinned brown-paper over
the part I had finished.
One evening, just a week ago, the
paper became unfastened and I saw
what I had done. I ran upstairs with
it, threw it inside the spare bedroom
Ever since
then I have been trying to brace myself
to fetch it down again, but I cannot.”
I stood up. “Give me the key of
the spare bedroom,” I said. He felt in
his pocket, handed it to me and shrank
back into his chair.
“Don't bring it down,” he entreated;
“I can't face it to-night.”
I went upstairs and unlocked the
spare bedroom door. Peters' work lay
just inside on the floor, plainly visible
by the landing light. I am not a
nervous man, but I confess at the
sight of it I caught my breath. There
was something sinister about it. Its
awful formlessness seemed the ultimate
expression of a desolation deeper than
despair. And as I looked the grey
labyrinth drew me evilly to itself, and
I heard a whisper that came from
nowhere, “Take it back to him and
leave him.” I stepped forward, hesi-
tated and shuddered. Then I picked
it up, flung it from me into the grate
and put a match to it.
When I went down Peters was
standing at the foot of the stairs. He
gazed at me without speaking. “I.
have burnt it,” I said. -
“Thank heaven l’’ he muttered and
sank weakly to the floor. I put him
to bed.
Neither of us has mentioned the
subject since that night. Peters is
quite his old self again. He has found
a new outlet for his energies in making
scrap-books for the Gurkhas.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Hugh: Memoirs of a Brother (SMITH, ELDER) is naturally
a book that even the reviewer approaches in something
rather different from the critical spirit. This remark must
not be taken to mean that it stands in any need of apology.
On the contrary, Mr. A. C. BENSoN has carried out his
task not only with tenderness and affection, but with real
biographical skill. The result is a character-picture of
extraordinary interest and charm, both to those who had
the rare pleasure of knowing Robert HUGH BENson
personally and to those who only recall him by his books
and sermons. The story is intimate to a degree very
seldom attained in published writing. No man is a
monster of perfection either to his valet or his brother,
however deeply they may love him, and the memoir
abounds in shrewd touches of gentle humour at the expense
of those admirers of “HUGH" whose hero-worship led
them into misinterpretations—those, for example, who spoke
of the “rapt and far-away look in his eyes,” from which
Mr. BENSoN sagely concludes that his brother was probably
bored, and wondering how he could courteously escape to
society that might interest him more. It is on these lines
that the memoir has been written; one might call it, not
too flippantly, biography in a morning coat and slippers.
Throughout one gets that impression of high and dis-
tinguished courage that for me is always present in the
work of Robert HUGH BENson; the scene of his death,
almost intolerably poignant in its detail, is a most noble
proof of this. Of his humour there are many characteristic
pleasure which he used to take in the words of an Anglican
who would appeal for charity towards one lately “reconciled”
to Rome on the ground that he had never fully recovered
from a bicycle accident. A dignified, gentle, and most
interesting book. -
If I were retained as counsel for the defence by Mr. Ford
MADox HUEFFER, accused of conspiring to waste your good
nature and his own talents (both equally undeniable) by
producing The Good Soldier (LANE), I should be very little
at my ease as regards the dismal story itself, but eloquent
enough in referring to the way in which it is told. , I say
“told" advisedly, for by a studied neglect of chronology or
any kind of consecutiveness, coupled with free licence to
change his opinions as he goes along, the author succeeds
in transforming himself into a living narrator, presenting as
they occur to him, evening by evening at the fireside, the
different aspects of a history gone by. It is well done and
it could not have been easy to do; but after all there
remains something solid in the schoolboy distinction
between matter and manner, and the plain fact is that,
when all the jig-saw bits are finally fitted in, the picture is
so little pleasant that, but for the fun of seeing them drop
into place, one would hardly have read to the end. In
quiet times I should very much resent the writer's putting
forward of Captain Ashburnham as “The Good Soldier.”
To-day one feels that the title is really too ridiculous, the
existence of such a person in the British army, or indeed
anywhere else, having become unthinkable; while the
narrative of his dealings with the other equally impossible
characters of his circle, though set out with a deliberate









examples. I like especially the account given here of the
grace of diction—through which, however, the ugly word

is here and there no less deliberately jerked—is simply (and
| again designedly) sordid. Much better spend your time on
a real jig-saw that will give you in the end a pretty picture,
say, of little Teddy feeding his rabbits.
The Way of The Red Cross, to which QUEEN ALEXANDRA
has added some gracious and touching words, carries with
it the most appealing of all recommendations. Simply and
ably told by E. C. VIVIAN and J. E. Hodder WILLIAMs, it
is a record of the splendid work done by The Red Cross
Society and the St. John Ambulance Association, a record
that must move the stoniest heart to pity and the most
penurious to the conviction that the relief of pain is the
only royal road to contentment of mind. Welcome, too,
is the tribute paid to the wonderful work of the Voluntary
Aid Detachments. Weariness and suffering nobly and
silently borne both by our wounded and the brave men
and women who tend them is the moving theme of these
pages. No one, it can be said without any qualification,
who has the love of country T- --- -
in his heart can fail to be
stirred by them to feelings of the
deepest thankfulness and the
deepest pride — thankfulness
that we have such workers
eager to give of their best,
pride that we have such men

written a story that is at least partly delightful, though I
could have wished her to talk a little more shop in it.
To any advocate of “mixed" marriages in India, or else-
where for that matter, I recommend A Shadow of '57
(FISHER UNwiN). Mrs. Scott MoncrieFF has the whole
problem at her finger tips, and although she gives an
almost cruel picture of the Eurasian character it is im-
possible not to be riveted by the cogency with which it is
presented. Like many women-novelists of to-day, Mrs.
Scott MoncBIEFF strikes shrewder blows at her own sex
than at mine, but whether this is because she understands
it better is not for me to decide. Here, at any rate, we
have several women held up for our laughter or our pity,
while the men (most of whom are officers) are endowed
with a glorious imperturbability that soothes their friends
as much as it maddens their enemies. A Shadow of '57 is
a “first" book, and the author has only to set her casual

success. As it is, she has

INFLUENCE, I
thinking, that the glimpses which it affords of life in a
Sloane Street modiste's are too brief to be more than
tantalising. For the rest the book is in the main a story
of contrasted careers (something on the lines of the
industrious and idle apprentices), the subjects being two
girls, daughters of a certain Ivor Selincourt. Of these
only one, Thea, was the child of his legitimate wife, and
she, being handicapped with a neurotic disposition and a
too luxurious home, fell in love with a man who was already
married, and eventually, after a lot of temperamental
trouble, she killed herself. Meanwhile Gladys, the child of
Ivor's earlier unacknowledged love, climbed from prosperity
to fortune, established her mother in Sloane Street, and
herself not only enjoyed a capital income as a fashion-plate
artist, but eventually married the man of her heart and
lived happy ever after. This distribution of fates is at
least unlike the usual arrangement of the moralist. Perhaps
I was intended to feel more sympathy for Thea than I
could actually command. Frankly, she seemed to me not
a little tiresome, since there was really no reason, apart
from her native cussedness, why she shouldn't have been
every bit as happy as her nameless half-sister. But, again,
perhaps this was all part of the plan, and intended to show
his half-brother Lionel; had a thoroughly rotten time as
a galley-slave in a Spanish vessel; joined forces with some
attacking Muslim pirates; became a renegade, the famed
Sakr-el-Bahr, The Sea Hawk (which is the name of the
book, and Mr. SECKER pub ishes it), the most outrageous
and effective corsair of them all; raided his Cornish home;
carried off Lionel and Rosamund; narrowly escaped the
scimitar of his Muslim and the yard-arm of his English
enemies, but duly prevailed over all, and came back to
honour in a land whose Queen never took too squeamish a
view of piracy. I will confess myself a little bored with
the susceptible Basha, Assad-ed-Din, and his intriguing
family, but Sir Oliver of the iron thews, with his hereditary
Tressilian violence, is a notable hero, a good hater, a stout
fighter; and I only hope the credulous Rosamund turned
over a new leaf and lived happily with him ever aſter, which
on the whole was more than she quite deserved.

account of his Imperial Master's views about the War. WILHELM II.
is represented to have said: “I never desired this war. Every act of
mine in the twenty-six years of my government proves that I did not
want to bring about this or any other war.” He ascribed its origin to

offered no pronouncement as to the date of its consummation.]
It is your habit like a god
To see your way through walls of brick;
You carry your divining rod
. As others wear a walking stick;
You have the entrée of Olympian premises,
And go hobnobbing, arm-in-arm, with Nemesis.
Truth's your familiar; you reject
The lies that lesser folk are fed on ;
With cloudless vision you detect
The origin of Armageddon;
By Instinct, far aloof from Reason's laws,
Infallibly you spot the fatal cause.
Who was it, for his wicked ends,
That drew his bloody blade and sabred
The peace for which yourself and friends
Through six-and-twenty years had laboured 2
It was that demon clad in human clay,
That monstrous Machiavelli, Edward GREY.
But first your prescience took a rest;
It overlooked the schemes, so sinister,
Which lurked within the baleful breast
Of that nefarious Foreign Minister;
And, all the time these plots were being grown,
You deemed his heart as simple as your own.
This shock to your prophetic soul
Left you, of course, a little shaken ;
Touching the War-drums' final roll
You gave no odds and none were taken;
Though Victory was yours as sure as Fate,
You weren't prepared to specify the date.
Alas! for I (who loathe to find
My dear illusions roughly shattered;
Who counted your omniscient mind
Among the things that really mattered)
Can hardly bear to think that now and then
You share the ignorance of common men.

THE DRILL BOOK. a
“You seem,” said Francesca, “to be profoundly interested
in that little red book.”
“Hush ' " I said. “Don’t speak to me, or you'll drive it
all out of my head. It wasn't very securely lodged, anyhow,
and now it's gone. I shall have to begin all over again.”
“What in the world is this man talking about 2"
“Francesca, I will tell you. This man is talking about The
New Company Drill at a Glance.” -
“Oh, but you've done much more than glance at it. I've
been watching you for half an hour, and you've pored over
it, and groaned over it, and turned it sideways and upside-
downways, and yet you don't seem to be happy.” .
“I will not,” I said, “disguise from you that I am far
from happy. This book contains numerous diagrams
beautifully printed in red and black. Diagrams always
make me feel that they are printed the wrong way round,
and that I should understand them perfectly if I could only
I can't do that, so I try to turn the diagram inside out, or
get it to stand on its head. I'm like that with maps, too
—but it's not a bit of good. I only get more and more
confused. NAPOLEoN wasn't afflicted like that. He just sat
down in a barn or somewhere and studied his maps, and
then went and won a battle.”
“Why drag in NAPOLEoN ?” said Francesca. “You’re a
Platoon Commander of Volunteers, and you're knocked off
your perch by a diagram in a little red drill-book. Well, throw
it away. Trample on it. Put it in a drawer and forget it.”
“How can I forget what I've never known? No, I must
go on trying to learn it. I must tread my weary path
alone. Francesca, how would you make a line form line
of platoons in fours facing in the same direction ?”
“I should just ask them to do it, you know. I should
appeal to their better feelings and say, ‘Now, men, you've
got to form a what's his name in fours. I'm sure you
won't leave me in the lurch, so get to work and form it;
and, whatever you do, mind you face in the same direction.’
That would fetch them, I'm sure.” -
“It would,” I said; “and it would also fetch the in-
specting officer and all the other big bugs who might be
present.”
“Well,” she said, “how would
book do it, then 2 ”
“I should inflate my chest and shout out “Advance in
Fours from the right of Platoons. Form Fours ' and
there's a lot more, but I've dropped my glasses and can't
read it.” -
“Ha hal” laughed Francesca. “An officer in eye-
glasses! Extract from Sir John FRENCH's despatch : “At
this point a Commander of Volunteers began to order his
men to form fours in platoons facing in the same direction,
but, having dropped his glasses, he was unable to read his
drill-book and was immediately afterwards taken prisoner
with his men. This regrettable incident deprives the army
of a very gallant officer.’”
“Laugh away,” I said bitterly; “pour cold water on my
enthusiasm. If you can't think of anything better to do I
suggest your leaving me alone with my drill-book, for I'm
determined to master it, diagrams and all.”
“That,” she said, “is the spirit I like. A father of a
family, fairly well on in years, is left alone with a drill-book,
and sets his teeth and gets the better of it. But tell me, do
they really have to do that sort of thing in the trenches?”
“Oh, yes,” I said, “they do it constantly. No day can
be called complete unless they form line of platoons in
fours facing in the same direction.”
“I haven't noticed anything about it in the soldiers' |
letters in the papers. They generally say the Jack Johnsons |
covered them with earth, but that they fixed bayonets,
rushed the last twenty-five yards and got back a bit of their
own, and what brave men their officers are. If ever you ||
have to fight I should like your men to say that of you." |
“If you really want that,” I said, “ you must let me
mug up this infernal drill-book. If I don't know some-
thing about it I shall never be able to face the inspection
next Sunday, let alone rushing the last twenty-five yards
into the German trenches, which I shall certainly en-
deavour to do if I ever get the chance.”
“Well, I'll give you a quarter-of-an-hour all to yourself,
and then I'll come back and hear you say your drill.”
“Splendid! That's the way to help a Volunteer."
“Yes, I'll be an Army Corps or a Division or a Brigade,
and you shall order me about to your heart's content.”
“Good; but if you're not quick about forming forward a
column of fours into column of platoons there'll be trouble."
“I’ll form forward,” she said, “ or perish in the

It was the alarum clock in the far
corner.
Some people place alarum clocks close
by the side of their beds. This is a foolish
and expensive plan, since by merely
reaching forth an arm it is possible,
with practice, to hurl the diabolical
instrument through the window in
one's sleep, and then to subside again
beneath the blankets. On the other
hand, if you really have to get out of
bed, you really have to wake up, unless
of course you are a somnambulist, in
which case you ought to sleep in a
cage.
As I dragged myself slowly from my
dreams I realised (1) that I was a
Special Constable due for duty from
two till six A.m.; (2) that I had ordered
Jessica, our general, to set the clock
for 1.15; (3) that it was raining; (4) that
I had a slight cold and a touch of
dyspepsia; (5) that as the gas stove in
the back kitchen was out of action I
could not brew myself a cup of tea.

THE REPRIEVE.
TR-R-R-R-R-R-ING !
It was the alarum clock in the far
corner.
Some people place alarum clocks close
by the side of their beds. This is a foolish
and expensive plan, since by merely
reaching forth an arm it is possible,
with practice, to hurl the diabolical
instrument through the window in
one's sleep, and then to subside again
beneath the blankets. On the other
hand, if you really have to get out of
bed, you really have to wake up, unless
of course you are a somnambulist, in
which case you ought to sleep in a
cage.
As I dragged myself slowly from my
dreams I realised (1) that I was a
Special Constable due for duty from
two till six A.M.; (2) that I had ordered
Jessica, our general, to set the clock
for 1.15; (3) that it was raining; (4) that
I had a slight cold and a touch of
dyspepsia; (5) that as the gas-stove in
the back kitchen was out of action I
could not brew myself a cup of tea. I
cursed the Special Constabulary and
all their works of darkness, dressed
very quickly and crept downstairs. I
then cut myself some bread and cheese,
which was all I could find in the
pantry.
As I sat eating this in the kitchen I
felt my spirits sink lower and lower.
I thought bitterly of the KAISER, the
man responsible for all my woes. What
was it to him that I was at present
laying the seeds of indigestion beside
an extinct kitchen fire, and should
shortly be wandering for interminable
hours through interminable lanes with
a companion as dejected as myself, our
only solace a couple of police whistles,
from which it was impossible to extract
the faintest resemblance to a tune?
Nothing. Perhaps he had not even
been informed that I was a Special
Constable at all. I thought despairingly
of the price of coal, and wondered how
long it would be before I was reduced
to felling our only apple-tree for fuel,
and whether I should be able to do it
with a table-knife or should be com-
pelled to purchase an axe; and, if so,
what was the price of axes. I thought
regretfully of my golf handicap of
eighteen, the fruit of years of untiring
devotion to the game. By the time
the war was over (if it ever was over) I
should probably have sunk to an indif-
ferent twenty, and my niblick and I
would meet almost as strangers. Why,
I asked myself, did Heaven permit
these things?
At length, my bread and cheese dis-
posed of for the time being, I rose and

did so my eye fell on the clock on the
mantelpiece. It showed the hour as
twenty minutes past six. Jessica had
placed the alarum in my room, but had
inadvertently set it as if for her own
usual hour of rising.
In the crises of life a man will often
mechanically seek relief from the stress
of overpowering emotion in the perform-
ance of some apparently trivial act.
I stooped and unlaced my boots. Then

NIGHT OPERATIONS.
It happened in the Park. As we
didn't really need the whole Park and
didn't want to be a nuisance to all the
couples who resort there for quiet con-
versation, we staked out a pitch. The
pitch was bounded by two parallel
roads, and the roads were in play.
Four scouts played against B Company.
The commander of B Company won
the toss and decided to defend the
south end. The object of the scouts,
who were loaded with rifles, was to
pass through the company's lines with-
wanted to come with me, but this would
have increased the cost, and we should
have looked rather small if by any
chance the taxi had been stopped and
we had all been captured together. I
made Higgs a sporting offer to allow
him to hang on behind if he would pay
part of the fare, but we failed to strike
a bargain.
Holroyd consented to adopt my
suggestion that he should conceal his
rifle down the leg of one of his trousers.
We had some difficulty in getting it
there, and then he ſound that it
restricted his movements. He also
they all declined to listen to any more
suggestions. -
I was still rather troubled about my
own rifle, as I felt that it might be
detected if undisguised, in spite of the
taxi. I couldn't reasonably expect
even B Company to mistake it for an
umbrella, swagger cane, policeman's
truncheon or lady's reticule. I thought
of concealing it in some musical instru-
ment, but couldn't hit on anything
suitable, though I went through all the
instruments I could think of from an
ocarina to a big drum. In the end I
decided to adapt my brother's violoncello
out capture. The rifles, which
are not well adapted for other
things, were carried for the pur-
pose of recognition only. I was
cast for a scout, and was abetted,
if not aided, by Holroyd, Hen-
derson and Higgs.
They turned out to be un-
imaginative pig-headed people,
and on one excuse or another
they refused in toto to adopt any
of my suggestions. Holroyd,
who is a long thin parsimonious
person, declined on the ground
of expense to hire either a prop-
erty tree or a piano organ. Con-
cealed in either of these I am
sure that he would have had
an excellent chance of getting
through. Henderson, who is a
young and somewhat effemin-
ate-looking individual, contemp-
tuously rejected the idea that
he should go as a nursemaid,
with a perambulator in which
he could conceal his rifle. He
seemed to think that it would
be unmanly and unsoldierly.
His only idea was a false beard
and a wig. I pointed out that
however desirable it might be
to alter his appearance in day-
time it was not so urgent in the
dark, and that it would be of Tº
small strategic benefit as he was
personally known to only about five
per cent. of B Company. In the end
he got quite stuffy about it and we
nearly had words.
Higgs's only excuse for not covering
himself with grass sods and crawling
along on his stomach was the damp
and muddy nature of the soil. Of
course when I found out that he was
going to let a little personal discomfort
stand in the way of success I gave up
trying to help him.
My own scheme for getting through,
though entailing a certain amount of
cost, was simple and effective. I de-
cided to hire an ordinary taxi and drive
down the left-hand road as fast as the
Park regulations would permit. When

complained of discomfort. We wasted
|quite a lot of time trying to get it out
again. We couldn't think of the proper
technical way to go to work, and there
was no help to be got from our military
books. I looked in both the Musketry
Regulations and Infantry Training, but,
strangely enough, neither of them deals
with a simple point like that. I know
that on active service a soldier, owing
to the use of putties, is not likely often
to get his rifle into this position, but
still, as in Holroyd's case, it might
happen. By the rather crude method
of all pulling at once, we eventually
managed to separate his leg, rifle and
trouser. It was largely due to Holroyd's
own impatience that several pieces of
his flesh and trousering adhered to the
case. I'm not a very good
amateur carpenter, so it wasn't
a very neat job, though it served.
As I anticipated, I was the
only scout to get through un-
detected. The other three were
all captured and brought in, in
addition to the thirty - three
civilians, six special constables,
five real soldiers complete with
lady friends, four territorials,

|civilians, most of the special
constables and all the real
soldiers were annoyed at being
interfered with, and I under-
stand that there are two actions
for assault and battery and
three for false imprisonment
pending.
Higgs, it appeared, did, after
all, adopt my stalking sugges-
tion, though without its best
feature—the divot disguise. By
crawling on his hands and
knees he had almost succeeded
in getting through the lines
when a clumsy Section-Com-
mander trod on the nape of his
neck. Owing to the mud in
which he was encased he might
still have gone unremarked if
! only he hadn't groaned.
Henderson's notion of climbing up a
tree wasn't a bad one, though I can't
quite see how it helped his progress to
any extent. His detection was due to
his accidentally dropping his rifle on
the head of the Commander of No. 1
Platoon. -
Holroyd, one of the park-keepers,
and the chair were captured en masse.
Holroyd seems to have had the idea
that the chair would in some way assist
him in his enterprise, and the park-
keeper was disputing his right to use
it without payment when they were
surrounded.

his congratulations to me, but no doubt

RENAMING A ROSE.
I Forget when we—that is, our local
choral society—first began to practise
Acis and Galatea. I know it was long
before the start of Lent. Anyway, a few
weeks ago we decided that we knew
enough about it to risk our annual
public performance, and the posters
were about to be issued. Then one
evening the blow fell at a committee-
meeting. We were busily discussing
the all-important point of the colour of
the paper for the programmes when
Appleby (our only tenor who can take
a top G without causing grievous bodily
harm to himself and those in his
immediate proximity) rushed into the
room in a state of uncontrolled emotion.
It had got about, he told us, that the
composer was a German, and the
tickets in consequence were going as
flat as our choir when they sing an un-
accompanied glee. “Old Mr. Chivers,”
said Appleby, “has been tackling me
about it. He says it's a shame to
perform the work of a German com-
poser when now is the time to support
our home products.”
Then a long altercation ensued as to
whether HANDEL was or was not to be
considered a German. 7: . -
“But surely he became naturalised,"
said Miss Mallows, appealing to
Mr. Bowles, our conductor, “after
spending all those years in England,
paying English rates and English taxes
• an - --
“And writing Italian operas,” added
Appleby.
“I really don't know for certain,”
said our harassed conductor, who always
received ten per cent. of the gate-money
as remuneration for his services. “I–
I think so."
“But he ought to know for certain,”
whispered Miss Parmenter to me.
“It's his business. If he doesn't know,
what's he doing with all those letters
after his name, F.R.C.O., L.R.A.M.,
Mus.Dac., F.T.C.L., A.G.S.M. 2”
“At all events,” announced Miss
Mallows solemnly, “I feel it my duty
as a patriot to decline, under these
doubtful circumstances, to assist at the
concert.”
Miss Mallows' powers of musical
assistance are, I am afraid, long past
their zenith, but her ability to dispose
of tickets still remains undiminished.
Hence her decision came rather in the
nature of a Zeppelin.
“HANDEL must be interned,” I said,
“and we must revive an old favourite.
As Mr. Chivers hinted, it's a fitting
opportunity to perform a native work.”

“But it must be something we know
pretty well,” remarked Miss Parmenter.
“What about The May Queen 2 We
know that backwards.”
“The point is,” I observed, “do we
know it forwards?”
“Then there's The Lost Chord,”
suggested Miss Mallows quite seriously.
“And Eric; or, Little by Little,” put
in the irrepressible Appleby.
“The Lost Chord,” I kindly explained,
“is not, strictly speaking, a cantata.
It is more usually performed as a cornet
solo. Occasionally one hears of its
being given as a song with harmonium
accompaniment.”
“I didn't mean The Lost Chord,”
Miss Mallows corrected. “I meant
The Ancient Mariner.”
“Why not try high and do The Dream

would bring the house down.”

not change the title of Acis and Galatea

we sing are absolutely unintelligible.”

XVI.
DEAR CHARLEs, We are now hold-
ing our own little bit against enormous
odds, the latter being partly Germans
but mostly rain. Even so we find the
trenches a pleasant relief, since our
allowance of discomfort is now defined.
Up till now they couldn't make up
their minds as to what exactly we were.
Sometimes they thought we were fully
qualified experts, fit for all the deeds,
dangerous and dirty, which soldiers
have to do, while at other times they
regarded us as amateurs, requiring
instruction. Between the “some "
times and the “other” times there was
little margin for rest and recreation.
Now it’s over, I may tell you that
the instruction is even worse than the
thing itself. We didn't so much mind
digging practice trenches as filling
them in again. We had done such a
lot of this that we had aeme to the
dismal conclusion that herein was the
ultimate destiny for all of us, lawyers,
landed proprietors, engineers and under-
graduates alike. We saw ourselves
left here, long after the War was over,
filling in trenches in Flanders when we
should be dining honourably in London.
Moreover we foresaw that our ultimate
convenience would be sacrificed, in an
expansive moment, to the cause of
universal peace, and, when we had
finished the English, Belgian, French,
Russian, Japanese, Servian, Montene-
grin, Roumanian, and Italian lines,
“My dear KAISER,” the ‘authorities
would write, “bygones being bygones,
please remember you have only to
drop us a postcard and we will send
you a thousand or two industrious, if
incompetent, spademen to fill in your
trenches for you. You might pass this
on to your Austrian, Hungarian and
Turkish friends. And believe us, very
sincerely yours . . .”
As it is, I reckon I'm now off trench-
filling for ever. I would far sooner be
shot for insubordination than stir a
limb to destroy this “little grey home
in the West " I have dug out for myself
and Captain Johnson. Take my word,
there comes a time in a man's life when
he attaches far more importance to a
judicious admixture of matchwood,
sandbags, straw and mud of his own
contriving than to the most luxurious
combination of chintz and Chippendale
designed and executed by paid hands.
We marched up here, three days
back, in a mood of ferocious silence,
my captain providing the sole domestic
touch by leaving his washing at the
last complete building on our route.
The people we relieved (in more senses
recollecting suddenly that they had im-
portant business elsewhere, vanished
by the back door as soon as ever our
faces were turned to the front. The
Germans, however, were more courte-
ous: realizing the arrival of slightly
bored strangers, they at once treated us
to a pyrotechnic display of commendable
thoroughness, combining entertainment
with instruction, expensive illumination
with unquestionable realism. Since
then the spasmodic crackle of rifles
has not ceased; snipers snipe indus-
triously, and bombs and rifle grenades
arrive and depart every now and then
by way of comic relief. We enjoy the
privilege of watching artillery duels
from the ten-pound seats in the middle.
Captain Johnson has a personal griev-
ance, since the objective of the enemy
guns is the last complete building above
mentioned. “The low hounds,”, he
murmurs, standing on our front door
step and shaking his fist at the horizon.
“Not content with making a target
of my personal existence, they must
needs go shelling my pants with their
shrapnel and high explosives.” And
so we continue our present lives,
spending to-day in getting rid of
yesterday's rain and looking forward
to to-morrow's.
I write, after a sort of high-tea-
dinner-lunch in my dug-out (where no
parcel containing victuals or drink
ever comes amiss), and from both
sides of me penetrates the singularly
trifling conversation of the men. They
are ..". a period of rest, and the
general state of their spirits is not so
much boisterous joy as comatose con-
tent. I have often wondered exactly
what motive—duty, enterprise, sport
or adventure—brought them all, to-
gether here; in one case I have been
enlightened only this morning. The
sanitary man, always ready for conver-
sation in the intervals of his ambitious
work, informed me as to his own case.
It appears that at the end of last July
he was affected with general nervous
debility. His doctor recommended a
fortnight at the seaside. The sanitary
man (then a clerk) protested poverty;
his wife insisted on the change of air,
and the combined ingenuity of the
three suggested enlistment in the local
Territorial battalion, with an eye solely
to its yearly encampment. And here
he is in muddy France, executing his
(shall I say disquieting?) labours
amidst relentless shot and shell, whose
object is to kill rather than cure.
Meanwhile rarely was a more rosy and
less nervous warrior than our old-time
invalid.
In conclusion let me tell you of the
ecclesiastical affairs of Lance-Corporal
Wesleyanism, and has paraded with
the minority of a Sunday. I have
even known him to do this, with a set
expression of feature and great dignity
of bearing, in a minority of one. But
times change and we change with
them, and, whether it was that some
epoch-making event occurred to con-
vert him or whether it was that the
Church of England parade happened
(for once) to be an hour later in the
morning than the Wesleyan, our Lance-
Corporal fell in last Sunday with the
majority. His Platoon Sergeant may,
for all I know, be a keen church-goer
in ordinary life, but in war he is a
stickler for regulations. “What are
you doing here?” he asked the Lance-.
Corporal, and, after a long conversation,
was finally convinced that his man was
deliberately parading with the Church.
of England. “Get away with you,”
said the Sergeant, not caring what the
other believed or didn't believe. “If
you want to change your religion, you
can't just do it like that ; you must go
to orderly-room and do it proper.”
I have stolen this item of news, by
way of compensation, from our Second
in Command, who, happening to call
on me at my trench at 11 A.M., stole
from me my biggest and best pepper-
mint drop. Next time 'you write, en-

THE RED cross cow.
WE are scrupulously careful in our
neighbourhood to do and say nothing
that can disparage the great effort
being made by our rivals at CHRISTIE's
in aid of the Red Cross. All the same
we are privately of the opinion that we
do this sort of thing better down our
way. No one can claim to have
actually invented our method; it just
evolved itself. But it is working like
a machine.
It began last October, when the
Rector, who is one of our most pro-
gressive farmers, announced his in-
tention of selling his little Jersey cow
by auction in aid of the Red Cross.
We had always envied him that cow;
she was the daintiest little creature in
the parish and said to be a fabulous
milker for her size. So the bidding
was pretty brisk. The Colonel got her
for £27 10s.-an outside price, but she
| looked remarkably well in his paddock.
| "We offered our congratulations and
But the Colonel was never happy
about it.
“I’ve got it into my head,” he
would say, “that that cow belongs by
rights to the Red Cross. I don't believe
that I shall be able to keep her with
any satisfaction to myself.”
He tried to square his conscience by
sending the milk to the hospital, but
it wasn't any good. So he put her up
(for the benefit of the Red Cross) to
public auction on the first Saturday
in December, and asked all the more
likely buyers to lunch on that occasion.
When she got hung up for a time at
£26 Dr. Sharpe" simply out of decency”
sprang her to twenty-eight. It would
be intolerable if the Colonel were to
lose by it, he said. There was some
confusion of idea there perhaps, but the
principle was sound.
Somehow this little auction of the
Colonel's set a precedent which we felt
bound to follow later on. Of course
the Doctor couldn't keep the cow. He
recognised that at once, the more so as
put her in. So his auction was rushed
on without delay. It was the best of
the series so far, being preceded by
quite a big At Home, during which the
cow was led round the lawn before the
drawing-room windows. She cost me
£31, and I sent my cheque to the Red
Cross. -
It was about this stage that the Cow
Committee came into existence, in
response to a general demand that the
thing should be put on a more definite
basis. The Committee consisted simply
—it will be seen that there was a
perfect simplicity about the whole
affair—of those who had made bids.
It met at the school-house every
Wednesday night to consider and draw
up the Regulations; but the cow had
changed hands three times before these
were complete. I am requested by my
colleagues to publish them here as a
guide to other neighbourhoods who
may wish to raise money for the War
Funds. I ought to add that it need

REST CURES.
AN INNovaTION.
WE were discussing rest cures, and
everyone had a special kind to recom-
mend. -
One said that there is nothing like
bed. Bed for a fortnight. But that
seems to me to need great strength of
mind. Personally, my horror of bed
after the sun has begun to knock
on the windows is only equalled by
my desire for bed as the hands of the
clock draw near the hour which our
lively neighbours (and allies) call
Mimmie. . .
As for hydros, let us forget them, I
said. And as for other people's houses,
however comfortable they may be, they
lie under the charge of being not
your own. They have to be learned
and there is not time to learn them.
One is on one's best behaviour in them,
and that is contrary to the highest
restfulness. .
One's own home, I went on, is not
necessarily perfect; but quite a number
of its drawbacks are removed when
someone else is occupying and running
it. Take the inevitable item of bills.
Here my hearers all shuddered, and
very rightly. Bills lose much of their
|
at one's own pictures and books; and
all the time the coal that burns so
fiercely and consolingly in one's own
grate is being paid for by others. No
stint eitherl Could there be a more
delightful arrangement 2
The disabilities of the scheme are
trifling. It is, of course, a bore to find
that one's private bath-time has fallen to
the temporary owner, or that lunch is
now half-an-hour earlier; but these are
nothing. The great thing is that one
is a guest here at last—that after years
of striving to make both ends meet and
having all the anxiety on one's own
shoulders, suddenly it has gone; and
Another advised Cornwall and
no newspapers. There is some-
thing to be said for this scheme.
If there were no newspapers, life
would be restful automatically.
It is the news that wears us
out. The advanced age which
METH Us E LAH succeeded in
reaching was probably due to

phrates Chronicle or Mesopotamia
| | Mail." --> - ...: *…* . * **
Another suggested a hydro
with frequent baths; but would
not the atmosphere of the
place go far to modify the
merits of the treatment 2 . .
Another counselled a sea voy-
age; ; but the prevalence of
“frightfulness” on and under
the ocean has made this a ques-
tionable scheme just now.
It was then that I chipped in.
“I have discovered,” I said, “a
new and perfect kind of rest
| cure. It is simply this: to lend
| your house to nice friends and
then to go and stay with them
as a guest.”
They asked me to amplify,
and amplification being my long
suit I gracefully complied.

when, instead of the modest
claret which is all that one's
own cellar can normally be in-
duced to disgorge, however one
may search it, the new occupants
are found to be in allegiance to
“The Widow,” the rest-cure is
made complete. Here, one says,
is the solution. Now will I be
reposeful indeed.
“That is my discovery,” I
concluded. “I made it a few
weeks ago and I shall never for-
get it. All that one has to be
careful about is the choice of
friends to whom to lend the
house.” -
“But supposing,” someone
asked, “they don't invite you to
stay with them—what then?"
“That,” I said, “would be
awkward, of course. In fact it
would ruin everything. But one
must be clever and work it."
“How did you get your invita-
tion?” another inquired. ”
“If you'll borrow my house,
I'll show you,” I said.
“A few days after we saw some
deserters come in from the desert."
Daily Dispatch.
The merits of the arrange- "tº
ment, I told them, should leap to the
eye. To begin with you are at home,
which is always more comfortable than
an hotel or a hydro or anyone else's
house. Hotels, to take one point only,
disregarding their fussiness and restless-
ness and the demand made upon one
to instruct foreigners in English, cannot
cook or prepare the most important arti-
cles of food for those in need of repose
—such things as bread and butter,
boiled potatoes, mint sauce, horse-radish
sauce (they often do no more than shred
the horse radish and pour cream over it,
the malefactors!), roly-poly jam pud-
ding, bread-and-butter pudding, York-
shire pudding. When it comes to grills,
they can beat the private kitchen ; but
again and again the private kitchen
minatory aspect when they are being
paid by others. The disturbing thought
as to the ruinous cost of butchers' meat
which assails one directly the cover is
removed no longer has any power to
vex. The sirloin still represents too
massive a pile of shillings, but the
shillings are to come from other pockets
—always a desirable state of affairs.
Coal again. In one's own house nor-
mally one trembles, and particularly
so just now, every time the poker is
used; but in one's own house when
one is a guest how blandly one stirs
the embers into a richer glow.
Life can be made enormously more
piquant in this way. Indeed it can
really become worth living once more.

TOTAL PROHIBITION OF ADJECTIVES.
(A Journalistic Dream.)
WHEN the Press Bureau decided to prohibit once for all
The use of any adjectives by writers great or small,
Dejection reigned in Fleet Street, and a welkin-piercing wail
Went up from all the journalists connected with the Mººl.
All the purple patch producers straight determined to convene
A conference of Protest—I was present at the scene;
And though its poignant pathos my descriptive art defies
The substance of the speeches I propose to summarize.
First spoke the great GARVINIUs: “My brothers, do not
flinch ;
To the tyrannous Buchmeister we will never yield an inch;
For the life-blood of the headline, of the leader and the ‘par’
Is that especial part of speech he seeks to ban and bar.
“'Tis true some ancient pedant, whose taste was wholly vile,
Declared that nouns and verbs composed the proper stuff
of style,
But full adherence to this view one very rarely finds
Except in frigid, self-restrained, undemocratic minds.”
Then followed LEo MAXIMUs, lord of the biting tongue,
Upon whose scarifying words the packed assembly hung,
Who swore he'd sooner die than be forbidden to describe
As “poisonous pro-Bosches” the Mond and Brunner tribe.
With sacerdotal fervour next good BEGBIE took the floor,
Exuding moral uplift from ev'ry bounteous pore,
And upon the vast assembly fell a soul-enthralling calm
I cannot quite remember all the noble things he said,
But one seraphic sentiment stuck firmly in my head:
“How can we render justice, thus restricted and confined,
To Lodge's beatific brow or BRYAN's holy mind?”
But the most pathetic protest heard on that historic day
Was uttered by our priceless and ineffable “TAY PAY,”
Who in accents choked with anguish made it absolutely
clear
That this abstinence from adjectives would ruin his career.
“In times of stress to make the wheels of life run smoothly
round
An all-pervasive lubricant must obviously be found,
And,” the orator continued, “STANLEY BUCKMASTER
forgets
That this aim is best achieved by eulogistic epithets.
“If I am not allowed to say our men are brave and fine,
Or that our women, young and old, with charms celestial
shine— -
If I'm forbid to lard with praise the lean expanse of prose,
I may as well at once prepare for turning up my toes.”
We have not heard what answer to this cosmos-shaking
threat,
If any, has been issued by the Press Bureau as yet,
But it's credibly reported that the PREMIER will advise
The amending of the order by the following compromise:—
Only epithets officially endorsed by the Bureau

AT THE PLAY.
“THE PANORAMA of YoUTH.”
A FIRST-NIGHT audience, largely made
up of distinguished actors and actresses,
gave a friendly reception to Mr. J.
HARTLEY MANNERs' new play at the
St. James's Theatre. The author calls
it “a comedy of age,” but it might be
more fitly styled “the tragedy of an
auburn wig.” Sir Richard Gauntlett,
widower, after a married life wrecked
by the faithlessness of his wife, recovers
hope, and imagines that he has re-
covered youth, in the smiles of a charm-
ing widow, Mrs. Gordon-Trent. So he
dons the wig and a pair of stays two
sizes too small for him, and blossoms
forth as an Adonis of
twenty-five, much to the
disgust of his friends and
contemporaries, Glad-
win, retired soldier, and
Carstairs,ex-diplomatist.
They are possibly more
disgusted by the dithy-
rambs on the joys of
youth which Sir GEORGE
ALEXANDER has to de-
liver. Felicia, too, Sir ºl/
Richard's convent-bred "ſº
daughter, who worships ºf:
the memory of her º º
mother, is horrified at || W
the thought of her father
marrying again. She is
in love with Geoffrey

excellent—notably that of Mr. ALFRED
BISHOP and Mr. NIGEL PLAYFAIR as
the elderly friends; of Miss MADGE
TITHERADGE as Felicia, and of Mr.
Owen NAREs as Geoffrey. When the
speeches have been judiciously pruned
and the action tightened up, The Pano-
rama of Youth should make a pleasant
enough entertainment. But we respect-
fully suggest that if the auburn wig
were made a shade less luxuriant
and the stay-laces slightly relaxed, Sir
GEORGE ALEXANDER's part would gain
in probability. -

secret which he imparts
first to his fiancée and
next to her papa. Then
in walks Mrs. Gordon-
Trent, and she, as you
will have guessed, is Geoffrey's peccant
mother."
In the Third Act. Felicia makes an
impassioned appeal to her father not to
marry the sinful lady, and stings him
into the revelation that her own mother
had not been a saint either. But the
excitement, or the pressure of those
stays, is too much for a weak heart,
and he collapses on the sofa. Both
engagements are now off.
In the last Act Gladwin and Car-
stairs, dyed and corseted to match their
old friend's whim, arrive at Gauntlett
Abbey, to find him recovering, but minus
the auburn wig, the trim figure and the
illusions of youth. After them comes
Mrs. Gordon-Trent, determined to re-
unite Felicia to her Geoffrey, and inci-
dentally Sir Richard to herself. As no
one could resist Miss NINA BoucICAULT
she has her way.

Mr. LEoN M. Lion.
, , Mr. SYDNEY WALENTINE.
Mr. MACDoNALD HASTINGs' production
in this kind at the Kingsway is not
nearly as funny as he could have made
it, for he has the true gift of humour.
I call it a Revue—though it was not
advertised as such—because it repro-.
duces and combines nearly all the
popular features of recent plays. There
is the Young Man who is Not on Good
Terms with his Reputed Father (Search-
lights); the Jew of Commerce (Potash
and Perlmutter); the American Get-
rich-quick Method (passim), and the
Gallant Young Second - Lieutenant
(everywhere). All these features are re-
presented in Advertisement; and I
might, if I were in a captious mood
(which is far from my thought) throw
in the Rehearsal for the Accolade, which
recalls The Twelve Pound Look. In de-
tail Mr. HASTINGs follows most closely
the lines of Searchlights. There the
Reputed Father hates the Son; here
each you have the Mother's peculiar ||
devotion to her Son, and her confession |
of her relations with the Lover, now
dead; in each the damning proof is
provided by a
to be the Son's
Father's.
But the play is not without signs of
originality. Thus, the hero was never
once shown in khaki on the stage. This
novelty, however, is mitigated by the
appearance of a rather subordinate
character in uniform of this material
with red collar-tags. He steps straight
out of a newspaper office into a Staff
appointment. Another sign of the crea-
tive faculty was to be seen in the char-
acter of the Jew father, Luke Sufan.
Starting life as a strug-
gling musical genius, he
developed commercial
tastes, devoting himself
§ brought him a fortune
and even the menace of a
knighthood. It also acted
as a little rift within the
violin, which ultimately
made the music mute
and killed the man's soul.
This is certainly a new
touch. Men have often
vious case of a man's
sacrificing the art of
a patent medicine.
The Christian wife,
who had married him in
early days for joy of his violin, was
soon driven by his
the protective arms of an old lover,
from whom she returns home in time
to bear her husband a son that isn't
his. Sufan takes a high paternal pride
in him, educating him above his sphere,
and receiving open contempt in return.
The curtain rises upon the boy's twenty-
first birthday, which is celebrated by a
dinner-party given to the advertising
clique who have helped to boom the
Syrup, the father's object being to
bring home to his son the humble
origin of his exalted prospects. The
boy admits to his mother his instinctive
disgust at his father's tastes, and she
responds by admitting the hereditary
cause of this unfilial attitude.
In the next Act, the sudden news of
the boy's death in the War, arriving
in the midst of a commercial séance,
throws Sufan into a paroxysm of grief;

him, and he recovers sufficiently to
receive a representative of the Press;
and, seeing a chance of making capital
out of his son's gallant death, he bribes
the interviewer with a five-pound note
(I have never done this myself, nor
seen it done) to include in his report a
reference to the hero's father as the
creator and proprietor of Suſan's
| Staminal Syrup.
It is not till the War is over (and
apparently forgotten) that he learns
the facts about the boy's fatherhood.
Among the few virtues that he has
retained (including a fluent familiarity
with Holy Writ) is a strong pre-
dilection for chastity, and he is ex-
tremely annoyed. His wife leaves
him ; he throws up the Syrup and the
chance of a knighthood and resumes
the violin habit. Finally, in his old age
she gets in touch with him again on the
roof of a Garden City, where he is keep-
ing the Feast of Tabernacles in a sum-
mer-house hung with very unlikely
grapes; and the prospect that “at even-
tide it shall be light" is symbolised as
the curtain falls by her readjustment
of his disordered neckwear.
As to the main purpose of his play,
Mr. HASTINGs has gone the way of least
resistance in justifying his title. Some-
thing worth while might have been told
us about certain secret methods of adver-
tisement; but the ways of the patent-
medicine-monger have been too freely
exposed. Something again (though per-
haps not very fresh) might have been
made out of the tendency to snobbery
in the attitude of a boy toward a father
who has educated him above his own
station; but when he is actually the
son of somebody else, the fault may
be ascribed to heredity, and no moral
is to be got out of that. ,
For the rest, apart from the Jew's
character, which owes much of its
air of originality to its mixture of
incredibly inconsistent qualities, the
play is largely a rechauffé. There are
strong scenes, but they are not always
grounded upon humanity. Thus, though
the father's tears over the death of his
son caused us great embarrassment (the
sight of a grown man shaken with grief
is always a terrible thing), it was
modified by a suspicion of insincerity,
for he had never given any proof of
deep affection, but only of a parvenu's
pride in his boy's superiority. And
when this suspicion was rudely con-
firmed by his prompt effort to secure a
commercial réclame from his affliction,
we felt that the author had trifled
with our emotions.
Mr. HASTINGs has shown himself
capable of much better work than this;
and if he succeeds now he will have
VALENTINE was brilliant. There was
little trace of Hebraism in his accent,
and he glossed over the thinness of many
passages by extreme rapidity of speech;
but he got every ounce of strength out
of the stuff he had to play with.- Miss
LILIAN BRAITHwa ITE brought a very
perfect dignity and sweetness to her
difficult part as the wife. Miss ELLEN
O'MALLEY showed great tact and charm
in the pleasant interludes, too brief, in
which she was allowed to play a minor
rôle. Mr. ARTHUR CHESNEY, as the
funny man among the advertising
agents, was obviously prepared-to be
funnier still if he had been given the
chance; and Mr. At Hol. STEwART as the
representative of The Daily Passenger,
who took a Staff appointment during
the War, and made the very slowest
kind of love before and after, was a
pattern of stolidity. As the Jew's Secre-
tary (with an eye for a stunt) Miss
WIoI.ET GRAHAM had little to do, but I
should never think of asking for a
prettier typist. Finally, as Adolf, who
played the piano and accompanied
the Jew's violin (not to be confused with
the Jew's-harp) when it was in use, and
served, when it wasn't, as a loyal, if
acquisitive, butler, Mr. LEON LION gave
a clever performance in the Perlmutter
manner. As a right Semite, Adolf had
strong views on mixed marriages and
did his best to confound the intru-
sive Gentile. He it was that, by
his wicked manipulation of their cor-
respondence, delayed the reunion of
the severed couple. But Sufan was
also to blame. When a man takes the
trouble to have his letters registered in
order to ensure their delivery he might
take the further trouble of posting
them himself, instead of leaving them
to the care of a suspected menial. And |
so, -of-course, he would, except in a
play, where the course of true love,
and even of untrue (as here), must
not lack for artificial corrugation.

THE DYSPEPTic's DILEMMA.
Jellaby is one of those miserable
crocks whose diseases are so vague and
uninteresting that nobody will listen
to them. Nobody, that is, who can
help it. -
Since the War began he has been
worse than ever. Though I constantly
reassure him as to the state of my
memory, he never fails to give me his
long list of reasons (some of them quite
repulsive) for not enlisting.
“If I was only moderately fit,” he
says, “I'd have enlisted ages ago. But
a chap with my liver—” (Here fol-
lows a lengthy and fluent dissertation
in particular.) “So it has come to
this,” he concludes: “I force—posi-
tively force—my breakfast down every
morning, and then comes that dreadful
feeling of repletion as soon as I leave
the table.”. -
Once I asked him what his doctor
said, and Jellaby flared up immediately.
“Brown " he cried. “That fellow
knows little and cares less about .
dyspepsia. Told me there was nothing
wrong, the great beaming apple-faced
brute! Said I was to take plenty of
hard exercise and laugh a lot. Laugh I
The man's a blithering idiot."
. Now Brown is an old friend of mine,
and a practical adviser if ever there
was one. I felt sure that Jellaby was
concealing something, and I took the
first opportunity to tackle Brown on
the subject. - . . . . . .
“I've just been talking to a patient
of yours,” I began; “chap called
Jellaby.” . . .
The Doctor smiled. “All !" said he.
“And how is Mr. Jellaby this morning?"
“Mr. Jellaby,” I said, “is too dys-
peptic to serve his country. He had
quite a lot to say about it.” -
The Doctor's smile broadened. “And
had he nothing to say about me? I
suppose that professional etiquette for-
bids me to ask you, but " .
“Jellaby considers,” I announced
with relish, “that you are a blithering
idiot.” - - - - : -
“And I told Mr. Jellaby," said the
Doctor, “that if he really wants to cure
his dyspepsia his best plan will be

Fond Mother. “WELL, Good-BYE, MY DEAR Boy.

TAKE GOOD CARE of YoURSELF; AND, whatever You Do, ALways Avoid
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
Long Furrows (MILLS AND Boon) is a story that I ended
by liking much more than I hoped to at the start. It
might have been called a Book for Mothers; I certainly
never read a tale more maternal. The special mother of
the argument is Mrs. Lane, who lived at Clifton and had a
son named Robin and a candid friend named Brenda. The
thing starts with Mrs. Lane going to a Founder's Day at
Clifton College, and not enjoying herself, partly because
Robin would not come with her, partly because she had a
foreboding. Which was explained later when she returned
to hear from Robin that he had been stealing from the
bank at which he was employed, and that there was nothing
for him but disgrace and flight. So the two, mother and
son, fled together, and, after a tragic odyssey, eventually
brought up at a little secluded cove in Cornwall, where in
the end happiness found them—Ishan't tell you how. Not
quite a cheerful book, as you see. Wasn't it Mrs. CRAIGIE
who said somewhere that “Mothers are ominously silent
concerning the joys of existence”? In a way that might
perhaps be the view of Mrs. FRED REYNoLDs. But not, I
think, altogether. The whole treatment of the relations
between Esther Lane and her son is very delicate and true.
Now I will tell you that what made me think I wasn't
going to like the book was the conversation of the Clifton
masters at the Speech Day function. Especially one who
had dreamy eyes, and, looking at a field full of boys, said
travelled in the realms of pedagogy, but I have yet to meet
a schoolmaster who would say things like that. And before
a parent too ! Fortunately this palpable creation of the
lady novelist makes but a fleeting appearance. And the
other characters are far more genuine.
I have just read The Salamander (SECKER) of Mr. Owen
JoHNson—a name new to me and one to keep on the select
list—and I feel I know just all about one side of that city
of surprises, New York. The Salamander is either a native
of New York or a migrant thither from a Western State.
It is of the so miscalled gentler sex, of any age from
eighteen to nominal twenty-five. It plays with fire to the
extent of eating it and living on it—that, roughly, is Mr.
Johnson's idea. It can (as the saying is) take care of
itself. Naturalists observe that it has a long head and a
little heart. Quintessentially a cold and dishonest reptile,
it offers all and gives nothing in particular in exchange for
anything from “bokays” to automobiles. Beginning with
male flappers, preferably the young of plutocrats, it later
fastens on the plutocrats themselves or their robust enemies.
Strong men, at whose nod railroad and chewing gum trusts
go quaking, fight publicly over it in equivocal restaurants.
Mr. Johnson's particular salamander, Doré by pseudonym,
eschews the rigour of the game. She allows herself to be
hard hit, and, instead of running away with the hitter, is
betrayed by a maternal instinct (with which she has,
properly speaking, no business) to take unto herself a
young rotter with a determined spark of character glinting

suddenly, “What are we doing for them?” Much have I
behind his eyes, who has for her fair sake fought himself

free of the widow Cliquot and others. This, I suppose, is
a concession to the molasses formula, though our author is
too sincere a person to accept it, and hints in an epilogue
that, burnt salamanders don't dread the fire as much as it
would be comforting to their converted husbands to believe.
This clever novel hasn't the air of caricature which the
subject might seem to invite. Doré herself is made plausible
enough—no mean feat. Salamanderism is presented as a
phase of the new feminism in U.S.A. An allied species
has been reported in Chelsea by detached observers.
In Mr. P. W. WILson's War study, The Unmaking of
Europe (NISBET), there is presented, together with a broad
statement of the circumstances leading up to the final
crash, a narrative of the events of the first five months of
the struggle. The author's work has this to recommend
it, that he has really succeeded in - - -
his effort to be fair (the effort is
almost too visible at times), and
that his manner of writing is
nearly always sufficiently flowing
to carry one without impatience
over ground that is necessarily
quite familiar. Not only does
one naturally remember all the
incidents related, but even the
phrases in which they are told
come forward, time and again,
with something of an air of old
acquaintanceship; yet this lack of
novelty, inevitable, I suppose, in
a history made by the week,
seems to detract very little from
the strength or even from the
vividness of the book. Perhaps
the impression of freshness is
derived a good deal from those
pages in which Mr. WILSON, leav-
ing the plain pathway of official
reports to wander among the
philosophies, comes to matters
that are intriguing because they
are controversial. His suggestive
analysis of the reasons for our atti-
tude towards Russia, for instance,
is well worth study, and I should
not have grumbled at rather more
of this sort of thing, which indeed ----- -
the title had made me expect; but I suppose it really could
not be done in the time. We should all have listened with
attention to P. W. W. commenting, say, on the uncanny
inactivity of the House of Commons, a subject that must
have had a certain painful attraction for him. His work
is to be continued, and I should like to think he will find
material for only one more volume, but I shall look out
with interest for as many as his subject gives him.

The excellent message which Mr. Justus MILEs ForMAN
attempts to convey in The Blind Spot (WARD, Lock) is
that all movements for social amelioration must be inspired
by love and compassion, and that the mere brainy organiser
will fail. Arthur Stone, taking an exactly opposite view,
affirms that it is the emotional element which has been so
disastrous and sterile in progressive movements, that
common-sense alone is the essential factor; and even goes
so far as to denounce the self-sacrifice of those brave souls
in the wreck of the Titanic who made way for the saving

a welcome can still be offered

rather cleverly, for the fact,

claimed) is a “new edition.”
Mr. J. HENRY HARRIs has a
real love for his subject and
a true understanding of the
Cornish people; and as his book
has the additional advantage of
numerous drawings by Mr. L.
RAVEN HILL I can recommend
it emphatically to those who seek
Cornwall not only for its golf
and its cream and its alleged
resemblance, in climate, to the
Riviera, but also for the charm
of its legends. I could wish
that Mr. HARRIs had confined
himself to a mere narration of
the tales he has collected, for
some of the comments made
upon them and put into the
mouth of Guy Moore are terribly
facetious without being funny.
This, however, does not materially
affect the value of a praiseworthy

justice to the Duchy.

since last August has assured his clientele, on the strength of confi-
dential information, that his country is on the very point of coming to
the support of the Triple Entente.]
How often in those early days,
Ere yet the swallows southward drew,
When everybody stood at gaze
To see what Italy would do,
With fine assurance you would speak,

To wrestle with your macaroni. -

UNwRITTEN LETTERs To THE KAISER.
No. XX. -
(From the Crown Prince of BAWARIA.)
ALL HIGHEST WAR LoRD,--I hasten to inform you that,
in accordance with your most respected and ever to be
promptly followed suggestion, I have to my brave Bavarian
soldiers another proclamation issued, bidding them to deal
roughly and swiftly with the by you despised British
army to which they are opposed. For the writing of this
proclamation I have used some all-glorious models which,
lest I should forget the style of them, I always by me
keep. I have assured my soldiers that they are fighting
to defend their Fatherland against the since years plotted
attacks of these prominently-toothed and long-legged mer-
cenaries, who are driven to battle by the mere fear of
floggings to be inflicted on them by their splenetic officers,
|Bavarians may
them they will not be supplied with roast beef and plum
pudding four times in every day, but will have to be
satisfied with the true German calf's cutlet and black'
bread, of which, together with potatoes and liver sausage,
they are brutally attempting to deprive us.
I have also put in what I hope will be considered a tactful
allusion to God as the trusted ally of the Germans, and have
asked my soldiers to remember that they are carrying on
the War for freedom, so that, for instance, the poor Belgians
may be able to understand that friendship with England
means misery, while friendship with the civilised armies of
the German Empire means perpetual happiness and much
wealth. Finally, I have asked my soldiers to drive the
accursed invaders—for it is their intention to invade us—
into the sea, and to do it as roughly as possible in the old :
splendid Bavarian way—though, to be sure, we Bavarians,
being an inland people, have but little acquaintance with :
the sea and do not desire to increase that acquaintance.
Be that as it may, I have done my best, and have had
this fire-breathing proclamation read at the head of every
Bavarian regiment in the fighting line. One cannot pause
to be strictly truthful in a proclamation. Your Majesty
knows this as well as anyone, you being yourself a master
in that kind of romantic writing, and you will make allow-
ances, I am sure. Some stimulus the soldiers require, for
they know for certain that for months past they have stuck
tight in the same place and have even from time to time
been beaten back from their trenches in a highly unex-
pected and most inconsiderate manner. If this sort of
thing is to continue, even my honest Bavarians may begin
to murmur, for they will think with profound yearning of
their village-homes and of the delicious beer they used to
drink with so much happiness in the days which now seem
to be a dream that cannot return.
When I myself think of Bavaria, with its many thou-
sands of breweries, all made prosperous by the patriotic
thirst of a cultured people, I confess that my heart grows
heavy in my breast, and, in spite of all my proclamations,
I find myself regretting the joys of peace and longing
for the swift end of this infernal war in order that we,
et home to our beer and that the English
may use their long legs, not for rushing at us on the
battlefield, as they now do, with a most murderous
result, but for striding back to their transports and so
being comfortably conveyed to their own barbarous and
foggy island. That ought to be a sufficient punishment,
for them. Let us, then, as quickly as possible make an end
of this War before worse things happen to us. For glory
we have assuredly done enough. Let us now take into
consideration the safety of our Fatherland, whether it be
Bavaria or Prussia. We cannot go on fighting for ever,
and never gaining any ground, and I am sure that it is
better to drink Bavarian beer in peace than to live in
trenches and be bombarded by the English, however,
bravely we endure it. I hope, therefore, that you will
not ask me to write any more furious proclamations.
Your sincere Friend and Admirer,
= RuPPRECHT.

the sentry outside my billet the other
night, I heard Dan saying, “Frind it

to his system—it was the same man
who told Jimmy that snowdrops were
harbingers. You see, Jimmy's blood-
hound Faithful was sitting on the
window-ledge of Jimmy's bedroom
catching flies for coming through the
window at him. If they didn't come
through, he just said “Snap” ITT
and caught them as they
went by. Faithful is a good
snapper, and caught ten
flies and a bee. He didn't
want the bee really. You
see the bee thought Jimmy's
bloodhound was a geranium,
and settled on his nose.
Faithful turned both eyes in-
wards to get the bee in proper
focus, and then they both
said “Snap” at the same
time, and fell out of the
window together.
The man who was passing
below had his umbrella up
and was expecting rain, not
bloodhounds and bees, Jimmy
says.
Instead of getting up off
the ground, he lay quite still,
and put his fingers in his
ears waiting for the bang.
He knew you had to lie flat
on the ground till the bomb
went off, but he didn't know
how long you had to stop
there while it did it. Jimmy
says the man appeared very
thoughtful when he got up;
he seemed to be considering
something.
It took Jimmy a long time
to find his bloodhound, and
then he found him holding
his nose in a bucket of water
to cool it, and looking from
side to side as if he expected
another bee. Jimmy says it
was all right when he tied
a blue bag on to Faithful's
nose, except that Faithful had to keep
looking round the corner of the blue
bag to see where he was going.
Jimmy says Faithful must have
swallowed the bee, because when his
nose got all right he swallowed the
blue bag. Jimmy says bloodhounds
have got a lot of instinct like that, and
it's done by careful breeding. Faithful
was very restless that night. Jimmy
thinks the blue bag or the bee must
have curdled on his stomach. He
tried to sing himself to sleep, but he
couldn't go off.
Jimmy says Faithful then tried to

unstrung too, as he couldn't hear it
buzzing when he listened outside
Faithful. Jimmy says that perhaps
it couldn't see well enough to buzz.
But whenever Jimmy's bloodhound
loses its iron nerve, it has a way
which soon makes it feel bold and
daring.
It's a tortoise, and it's a hundred-
and-three years old, Jimmy says.
Whenever Faithful sees the tortoise
he always pulls himself together and
dares the tortoise to come out of its
shell. Jimmy says that when the tor-
toise refuses to -growl back Faithful
gets husky with rage and puts his
wait hours for the tortoise to come and

the tortoise is a hundred-and-
three years old, that's why.
But Jimmy could see Faithful
had got his iron nerve back
again, because after he had
had a little snooze he climbed
under the hedge and went
and drank the milk that had
been put out for the cat next
door.
Jimmy says the cat came
at half time and deliberately
went up to Faithful and gave
him the coward's blow, and
when Faithful was going to
hurl the taunt in her face
she went and looked like a
camel at him.
Jimmy says it was awful,
for you know what blood- ||
hounds are when they are
roused. They just catch the
cat by the middle of the back,
throw it once — only once,
Jimmy says—up in the air,
and then leave it for the
gardener to bury. -

Jimmy says it was a very
unwilling cat, and was very
rude to his bloodhound; it
did something at him with
its mouth, so Faithful just
came away and bided his
time; he is a good bider.
In the afternoon Jimmy
took Faithful on the trail:
he wanted to catch a spy
before the grass got damp.
He tried a different direction this time,
but Faithful seemed to know. He soon
got into his steady swing, and led Jimmy
right away to a house which stands a
quarter of a mile back from the road.

very cautiously to an open window, on
the ledge of which a lady had just
placed some crumbs for the birds.
Jimmy, says Faithful very carefully
placed his paws on the window-ledge
and, gradually, drawing himself up,
reached out with his tongue. . -
Jimmy, says the lady must hav
been in the room and seen Faithful's
full face rising at her over the window-
ledge, for he heard her give a gasp like
pouring cold water down another boy's
| neck. - .
When Faithful heard the gasp he
stopped reaching out for the crumbs
and, holding-on with all his might, he
fixed the lady with his eye. Jimmy
| says the lady sank amongst the furni-
ture, he could hear her doing it; but
before she did it she said something to
: Faithful which caused him to lose his
grip and fall with his whole weight
right back on a pink hyacinth: it bent
it nearly double, Jimmy says.
It is awful when a bloodhound fixes
you with his eye, Jimmy says; it goes
all down your spine and makes you
feel like you do when the photographer
takes the cap off the camera at you.
Jimmy says that Faithful looked
quite downcast when he saw him in the
road; it was because he knew he had
made a mistake. You see Jimmy had
seen the lady before; her name was
Mrs. Jones, and she used to collect for
the War. But could a prize blood-
hound like Faithful possibly make a
mistake? that's what puzzled Jimmy.
Jimmy saw the lady again two or
three days after when she called to see
his mother. Jimmy says Susan opened
the door, and the lady told Susan she
had called for the War. Susan said if
she would step inside she would get
it for her. Jimmy says Mrs. Jones
stepped inside and began to wipe her
feet upon his bloodhound, who hap-
pened to be lying down curled up in
the hall.
Jimmy says that's one of the things
you should never do with bloodhounds;
it goads them. Jimmy says Faithful
must have been thinking of the bee in
his sleep, for he said “Snap” very
quickly this time, before the lady's boot
could say it back, and then he did the
side stroke upstairs as hard as he could.
... Mrs. Jones was very angry with
Faithful for saying “Snap” first. She
said some words to Jimmy's blood-
hound which Jimmy had heard before.
Jimmy says it was on the day when
he bought a lemon to suck in front
of a man playing the flute in a German
band. You have to let him see you
sucking it by making a juicy noise
with your mouth, Jimmy says, and it
makes his mouth water, and all in good

—AND How THEY PASS ONE ANOTHER Now.
Jimmy says you do it by being very
quick, and you can hear the German
words coming after you as you go along.
Jimmy says Mrs. Jones only said
some of the words, and then settled
comfortably on the floor with her head
in the umbrella-stand. Jimmy's mother
heard one of the words; it was
“verfluchter.” Jimmy says his mother
would make a splendid detective if she
were only a man. When Mrs. Jones
recovered and wanted to go and have
her leg amputated, Jimmy's mother
took her into the drawing-room and
began writing down names in the lady's
she put her own name down for £10,
and then Jimmy's for £5, and then
Susan's and Faithful's, and kept break-
ing the pencil after every entry. She
said she thought the policeman would
never come, and was just going to put
his name down for a lot of relief when
he brought it himself.
Jimmy says they went very quickly
to the police-station because when the
cabhorse turned round and saw Faith-
ful he bolted.

that it was a clear case, and that the

Commandant had been learning to tie
knots. In order to let his knowledge
off on us he decided to build a bridge
and asked us to help him. Bridge
building requires a number of pieces
of wood. These can be commandeered
without difficulty if the owner isn't
about. If he catches you, you appeal
to his patriotism. The bits of wood
are tied together with rope and lash-
ings (string and twine stretch too
much). If the bits of wood stay where
you have tied them, you call the result

much you rename it a boom or barri-
cade according to whether you are
using water or not. Water isn't
essential to bridge-building, but it adds
to the amusement. If the bridge
stands up long enough you call in
the photographer. You further test
it by detailing the officers and men
whose loss won't affect the efficiency
of the Battalion to tread on it. This
affords practice for the stretcher-
bearers and hospital orderlies. When
you have discovered how many men
the bridge won't carry, you can either
reconstruct it or revert to the boom or
barricade theory.
Our Commandant, who has a sense
of humour, borrowed a pond. We
succeeded in commandeering the wood,
though not without having to appeal to
the owner's patriotism. We told him
that every log which he lent us would
probably save the life of a man at the
Front.
no patriot, and we had to promise to
return the logs in the same state of
| repair in which we found them (fair
| wear and tear excepted). As our Com-
, mandant wasn't present we offered his
| | personal guarantee. The log-owner
knew our Commandant, and we had to
throw in a Quartermaster and Pay-
master. The Quartermaster got the
rope and lashings on credit. . . . .
The pond had a ready-made island
in the middle and we were ordered to
throw the bridge on to the island.
Bailey didn't understand that the word
“ throw ’’ was used in the technical
sense and started with the ingredients.
He was short with the three first
logs and the splashes attracted the
attention of our Company Commander.
This of itself was enough to spoil
Bailey's day, apart from other incidents.
We laid a number of logs on the
ground in a nice pattern and the Com-
mandant named the pieces. We never
decided on the name of one big log;
I called it “Splintery Bill” (after the
Adjutant), the Commandant called it
He was either very obtuse or
it fell on his toe, called it something
else.
The Commandant showed us how
to use his knots in tying the logs
together. We made the knots, and he
said that we had constructed a trestle.
When we tried to stand the thing on
end it didn't look in the least like a
trestle. Our Commandant said we
hadn't made the knots as he told us,
and that he would have to do it him-
self. When he had finished, it held
together better, but didn't look quite
sober. After a third combined attempt
we were able to attach road-bearers
and get it into the water. We started
to hammer it into the mud, but some
of the blows weren't accurate, and
Holroyd had to retire to the hospital
tent while we repaired damage.
Eventually we got the trestle fixed up
and attached pieces of wood called
chesses to the road-bearers. If these
things are properly applied you can
walk on them, and our Junior Platoon
Commander was requisitioned to demon-
strate the fact. Either he didn't tread
on the good chesses or the whole thing
wasn't as practicable a piece of, work
as it looked. He joined Holroyd in
the hospital tent. t
The other trestles had to be erected
in deeper water, and wading volunteers
were called for. Our uniform isn't
guaranteed unshrinkable and there was
a shortage of volunteers. The discovery
of a boat seemed likely to solve the
difficulty. The boat wasn't found in
the water, so we didn't know for certain
if it was watertight. No mention of
this possible defect was made to Bailey
when we started him on his cruise.
Bailey was half-way between the bank
and the island when the boat sank.
Bailey can't swim very well and a
fatigue party had to be told off to
rescue him. Bailey and his rescuers
all say that the corps ought to pay for
their new uniforms. Since then our
boy buglers (to whom the shrunken
uniforms were transferred) have de-
clined to wear them on the ground
that they haven't shrunk in the right
proportions. Boys are far too fastidious
now-a-days; it is absurd to suggest
that they cannot bugle evenly with
one sleeve shorter than the other.
We got the bridge finished without
many more accidents and appointed the
committee to test it. Our Commandant
wouldn't lead the committee. He said
that they were retreating and that he was
going to direct operations against the
advancing enemy from his proper place
in the rear. Only four men retreated
over the bridge. When it collapsed
two Platoon Commanders remained on
the bridge to the last. The men who
with themselves and rather amused
when the bridge became a boom. They
were quite upset when they found out
that we hadn't time to build another
bridge for them to cross back again.
It was the hour for tea, and bridge-
building is really engineers' work. It
isn't necessary for riflemen to keep on
at it when they have once learned how
it is done. The islanders said that they
would rather stay where they were than
go home through the water. The
Commandant said he didn't mind so
long as they were comfortable, and we
marched back to camp. -
They arrived in camp very wet and
hungry just before “lights out.” They
had got to dislike the island. They said
the place was damp and unhealthy,
and that the only available food was a
duck and some duck's eggs. They
hadn't any means of cooking the duck,
and the bird, who was sitting on the
eggs, refused to be dissociated from
them. In any case there was nothing
to indicate their age. The society, too,
was limited ; they weren't on very good
terms with one another; and the duck,
owing to its interest in the eggs, was
quite unclubable. -
On the following day there was a
very interesting triangular discussion
between the log-owner, the pond-owner
and our Commandant on the rights
of property. -

THE slackER,
THE “ORION'S" FIGUREHEAD AT
WHITEHALL.
ALL wind and rain, the clouds fled fast
across the evening sky—
Whitehall aglimmer like a beach the
tide has scarce left dry;
And there I saw the figurehead which
once did grace the bow
Of the old bold Orion,
The fighting old Orion,
In the days that are not now.
And I wondered did he dream at all of
those great fights of old,
And ships from out whose oaken sides
Trafalgar's thunder rolled;
There was Ajax, Neptune, Temeraire,
Revenge, Leviatham,
With the old bold Orion,
The fighting old Orion,
When Victory led the van.
Old ships, their ribs are ashes now; but
still the names they bore
And still the hearts that manned them
live to sail the seas once more,
To sail and fight, and watch and ward,
and strike as stout a blow
As the old bold Orion,
The fighting old Orion,
They watch, the gaunt grey fighting
ships, in silence bleak and stern;
They wait—not yet, not yet has dawned
the day for which they burn
They're watching, waiting for the word
that sets their thunders free,
Like the old bold Orion,
The fighting old Orion,
When NELSON sailed the sea.
Oh, waiting is a weary game, but
NELSoN played it too,
And, be it late or be it soon, such deeds
are yet to do -
As never your starry namesake saw who
walked the midnight sky—
Old bold Orion, -
Fighting old Orion,
Of the great old years gone by.
And be the game a waiting game we'll
play it with the best;
Or be the game a watching game we'll
watch and never rest;
But the fighting game it pays for
when the guns begin to play

Fighting old Orion)

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, 20th
April.—One slightly compensatory re-
sult of devastating War is reduction
of number of Questions addressed to
Ministers. Been known to stop short
of the round dozen. Instinctively felt
that at period of national crisis this
cheapest method of self-advertisement
is bad form. To-day—unaccountably
except on ground that long week-end
provides mischief for idle hands to do
—flood set in with the old rush.
“Here is an extra Monday thrown
into week-end,” says honourable
Member in privacy of his study. “Let
us draft a few questions addressed
to Edward GREY, LLOYD GEORGE,
TENNANT or all three. They've nothing
particular to do and are well paid for
doing it. We'll get our name into the
Parliamentary Report and our con-
stituents will see we're on the spot.”
Accordingly Paper distributed this
morning crowded with 157 questions,
forty of them standing in five names
that are familiar in this connection.
Within limit of Question hour (which
by Westminster clock runs only for
three-quarters) 112 were put and an-
swered. Replies to the rest will be
printed and circulated with votes in
the morning. That a game not worth
the candle consumed in drafting them.
You may circulate replies just as you
may take a horse to the pond. But
you can't make the public read them,
and no one will know how active and
intelligent are the authors of these
forty-five belated queries.
No other business being on hand, way
made for Member for Houghton-le-
Spring—quite a total-abstainer touch
about name of constituency—to move
his Resolution prohibiting, during
continuance of War, sale of alcoholic
liquors in refreshment rooms and bars
of House. His MAJESTY's personal
example specially cited in support of
proposal.
Quickly made apparent that House
was sharply divided, with preponder-
ance of opposition. Collins, Kt.,
presenting himself to favourable con-
sideration of House as a “total
abstainer by birth,” plumped for
Resolution, as did By-Your-LEIF
JoNEs and other teetotalers, whether
by birth or adoption. On the con-
trary (his favourite attitude) ARTHUR
MARKHAM, habituated to call a spade
a spade, in extreme cases a pickaxe,
denounced the motion as “pure cant.”
BonAR LAw put that view of it in
another form. Members would support
the Resolution, and if sale of liquor
prohibited they would, he said, go off
to their homes or their clubs and take
their accustomed drink.
“In a time of stress like that at

insisted, “we should have less rather

“A Total Abstainer by birth.”
(Sir STEPHEN Collins.)
As for MARK LockwooD, Chairman
of the Kitchen Committee, who has
hauled down from his buttonhole the
carnation that had acquired the status
of a parliamentary institution, he was
bull whose originality, breed and excel-
lence made the few Irish Members
present green with envy.
“The profits of the Kitchen Depart-
ment,” MARK wailed, “are growing
less and less every day. If this resolu-
tion is passed it will reduce what is
left, which is nil, by 50 per cent.”
In face of this appalling menace,

ment of the debate sine die.

journed at 5 o'clock.
Wednesday.-LLOYD GEORGE is in-
debted to Mr. HEwins for opportunity
of making the most important state-
ment with respect to affairs at the
Front heard in the Commons this year.
Member for Hereford submitted Reso-
lution declaring urgent necessity of
enlisting under unified administra-
tion resources of all firms capable of
producing munitions of war. Pointing
out that motion was tantamount to a
vote of censure, since it implied that
the Government were not doing their
duty and that the House ought there-
fore to pass a resolution calling their
attention to it, CHANCELLOR said he
could not consent to its adoption. At
the same time he cordially approved
its suggestion, and proceeded to show
in detail that it had long been embodied
in policy and action of the Government.
Lifting the veil behind which for
strategic purposes the War Office works,
in a few sentences he brought home
to least imaginative mind stupendous
character of our operations. The
“contemptible little army" at which
eight months ago the KAISER sneered
has grown till there are now in the
field six times as many men as formed
the original Expeditionary Force, all
fully equipped and supplied with
adequate ammunition. Wherever
German shot or shell has made a
vacancy in the trenches or in the
field, another British soldier has
stepped in to fill it.
As to ammunition the War Office
has been faced by unexpected in-
crease in expenditure. Taking the
figure 20 as representing output last
September, CHANCELLOR showed that
it has increased by leaps and bounds
till in March it reached 388. He
confidently anticipates that this month
the ratio will proportionately advance.
During the few days' fighting round
Neuve Chapelle almost as much am-
munition was expended by our artillery
as was fired during the whole of the
two-and-three-quarter years of the Boer
War. And not only were our own
demands met, but we could also help
to supply the need of our allies.

THE EVER-ALERT.
I MET my old friend the leader-writer
on his way to work. His eye flashed,
his brow gloomed, his powerful jaws
were set, his step was firm and deter-
mined. SHELLEY's lines floated into
memory:—
. “In that hour of deep contrition,
I beheld, with clearer vision,
Through all outward form and fashion,
"Justice, the Avenger, rise.”
The third rhyme may not be quite
up to modern standard; but the spirit

affected me. I felt that I too was in the
presence of something very like Fate. .
“What ho!” I said. “On the War-
path?’”
“If you mean, am I going to the
office? yes,” he replied.
“Going to let some one have it hot?”
I continued.
His demeanour increased in vehem-
ence. “Of course,” he replied.
“Who is it this time 2 " I asked.
“Who is the last tired official who,
after months of hard work and anxiety,
has failed to reach your high-water
mark and must therefore be lashed in
public.”
“I shan't know till I get there,” he
said. “There's certain to be some one.
But how did you guess?”
“Not difficult,” I replied.

“Your
I can see
as it was yesterday and always has been.
But for you and your punctual pen I
don't know where England would be?”
His sternness relaxed. “I'm glad
you think like that,” he said.
“I do,” I replied. “I think England
was never to be so felicitated on her
Press as to-day. Her leader - writers
were never so vigilant for defects in
our administration or so instant in pro-
claiming them for everyone to see.”
He beamed. -
“I hope so,” he said. Then a shade
of anxiety flittered over his brave stolid
countenance. “You don't think there's
any danger of our striking the rest of
the world as a nation divided against
itself, do you?” he asked.
“My dear fellow,” I, assured him,
“what a ridiculous ideal"
He seemed to be relieved.
“The truth is above all,” he said.
“It is,” I replied, “far above. Out
of reach for most of us, but never inac-
cessible to the grave and sagacious
Press. You journalists know. All is
simple to you. There are no complex-
ities in administrative work. Black is
black and white is white when one is
governing a country, and there are no
half-tones as in all other walks of life.
Every mistake must be branded; no
one's good faith must be trusted; no
one in a difficult position must be
helped. Don't you agree?”
“It is a mighty organ,” he said. “I
as a critic of those in power cannot be
over-estimated.”
“With its eye and ear at every hole
and all its agents busy, it must obviously
know so much more about a depart-
ment than the department itself,” I
said. - - - -
“Of course,” he replied; “and in
addition it frames standards and ideals
of perfection by which it measures all
those in authority; any falling short
must be castigated.”
“Immediately,” I said.
“And without mercy,” he added.
“In war time and under such a strain
as the country is now experiencing you
cannot be too drastic,” I said.
“Exactly,” he said. “There is more
at stake; the Press has a sacred duty.”
“Is all the Press equally sacred?”
I asked. “Are the racing forecasts,
for example, as sacred as the leaders?”
“Nothing is so sacred as the leaders,”
he replied. “Next to them the corre-
spondence columns, where all kinds
of scandals and abuses are ventilated
and other attacks not necessarily less
merited are made on those in whom
the responsibility for England's success
is vested.”
“But what about the news?”
He fumed terribly. “There is
hardly any news any more,” he said.

THE TERRORIST.
SHE was our cook, and a bad cook
too; but a woman of genius. In the
early days of her reign she must have
gathered from the parlour-maid that
Mother and I were prejudiced against
tepid soup, burnt cutlets, and leathery
omelettes. I went into the kitchen,
intending to remonstrate, and found
Cook gazing fixedly out of the window,
sniffing at intervals, and apparently
struggling with unshed tears. “Is
anything the matter, Cook 2 " . “No,
Miss, nothing that you can help. It's
only that it's a year to-day since I lost
my sister Annie, and it all comes back to
mind. The Coroner said it was the
constant complaining and complaining
that had weakened her brain, and led
to—” “To what ?” I asked breath-
lessly. “Oh, to her hanging herself
on a very strong hook in the cupboard
where her mistress kept her best
dresses. I was sorry for the poor
lady too, for they tell me the shock she
got when she went to take down an
evening gown, and found Annie in-
- Yes,
Miss, just complaints did it, and she
| near as good a cook as I am myself
| But there, I mustn't be taking up your
time with my trouble, must I?” . . .
After that, could I dwell on the
soup, the cutlets, or the omelette 2
Mother was decidedly upset too; and I
have reason to believe that she spent
that afternoon having the stoutest
of the hooks in her own cupboard
removed. - - -
A short visit to some relations took
me from the scene of action for a day
or two. On my return I was met at
the station by Cook, who had volun-
teered for the job. As we drove
through a gloomy street she kept
craning her neck out of the window,
reading, half aloud, the numbers on
the houses.
“Twenty-two, twenty-three—ah,
there it is, twenty-four. That's the
| house where Lizzie died, Miss, my
poor sister.” “I thought her name
was Annie.” “Oh, that was the
youngest but one, Miss; Lizzie came
next to me, and we were as like as
two peas. Poor soul! Well, I don't
wonder the house is shut up ; the
neighbours, afterwards, used often to
hear her crying; not to mention the
charwoman, who was always meeting
her on the stairs, and getting the sort of
turn that makes you feel like brandy.”
“Good gracious, Cook I Do you mean
that she died — suddenly 2 " “It
must have taken a few minutes, Miss,
owing to the bath not having been
as full of water as she might have
of your family should have
“We're so sensitive, Miss, all of us;
we got it from poor Mother. But at
the inquest the Coroner said some very
sharp things, holding that it was want
of sleep that drove her to it: we can
none of us get a wink of sleep before
midnight—it runs in the family—and
Lizzie's mistress, not understanding,
and making her get up before she had
her sleep out in the morning, brought
it all about.”
My feelings may be imagined when
Mother said to me that evening —
“My dear, you must speak to Cook;
she is upsetting the whole of the house:
nothing will get her up before eight in
the morning, and of course that makes
breakfast late and all the maids cross.”
I had to mention the bath, and Mother
turned pale. She had a tub in her
own room for some days afterwards;
she said she preferred it.
At last we became firm ; Cook must
go. I went into the kitchen to give
her notice. That woman was a genius,
or else had second-sight; before I could
utter a word she insisted on showing
me the photograph of a singularly
plain young woman. “My oldest
sister, Miss.”, “Oh, that is Lizzie”
“No, Miss, that is poor Emily.” “Is
she dead too?". I asked desperately.
“Yes, Miss; you see her mistress gave
her notice, and it has always been a
rule in our family to give it, not to take
it, and it somehow broke her spirit.
Whether she mistook the bottles or
not, well, as they said at the inquest,
the only tongue that could have told
was still; but those that uses spirits of
salt for cleaning out gas stoves must
settle with their consciences here and
hereafter.”
I believe Cook would be with us
still had not Providence sent an angel
in the form of the wife of the Vicar of
the parish from which our treasure
canne.
“And how do you like Sophia?”
she asked amiably.
“She has many drawbacks,” said
Mother nervously. “Sometimes we
think her a little eccentric; but possibly,
poor thing, all those awful tragedies in
her family really upset her brain.” “I
don't remember any tragedies,” said
the Vicaress thoughtfully; “I don't
think the Vicar would have allowed
them.” “I meant the sad deaths of
three of her sisters.” “But Sophia
was an only child. We knew her since
she was a tiny tot; she was always
most well behaved, though some people
thought she was not quite so candid
as she should have been, considering
her big blue eyes.” “Was she christened
Sophia or Sapphira 2 " I asked meekly.
“My dear,” said Mother, “give
Sophia a month's wages and board
wages in lieu of notice; tell her to
pack; tell the housemaid that she is
not to leave her alone for one second ;
order a cab to be at the door in half-
an-hour.”
The Terrorist left unwillingly. I am
sure she still had a brace of sisters up
her sleeve.
AN ESSEX TALE.
WHEN on a recent morning Jane,
Maid to old Lady Deloraine,
At eight o'clock as usual came
To wake that formidable dame,
Jane's nerves were visibly unstrung
And checked the glibness of her tongue.
“Why, Jane,” her mistress said, “you
look
As if you'd quarrelled with the cook.”
“No, please your la'ship,” stammered
Jane, - -"
“They dropped a bomb here in the lane,
Last night at one it was, I think;
Since then I never slep' a wink.”
“What l” cried the other from her bed,
Her eyes protruding from her head,
“The German airships came last night,
And l not only missed the sight,
But never heard a sound before
Your knuckles rapped upon my door!
If you a grain of sense had got
You would have waked me on the spot.
I'd like to box your silly ears,”
And then she melted into tears;
While Jane, retreating, muttered, “Lor!
I never saw her cry before.”

AT THE PLAY.
“QUINNEys.’”
A PRELIMINARY interviewer, whom
Mr. WACHELL was too good-natured to
resist, had wrung from him several
interesting admissions; as that Quin-
ney's was his best book; that the play,
as plays should be, had been written
before the novel; that the scene of Mr.
Quinney's sanctum contained genuine
antiques as well as admirable fakes ;
that his hero preferred things to per-
sons, and that the author found in the
excitement of producing dramas an
excellent anodyne for the strain
of wartime. I in turn was too
good-natured to be put off by all
this, and remained fixed in my
resolve to see the play for myself.
And I was well rewarded with
something very unusual. To be-
gin with, Quinney was an honest
dealer in antiquities, and this
notwithstanding an apprentice-
ship in worm-hole-drilling. His
morality, in fact, like his fortune,
was self-made, and the natural
pride that he took in these crea- ?
tions was not lessened by the fact
that he came from Yorkshire.
A righteous man among knaves,
and a true lover of Art for its
own beauty, he was not content
with the virtues which he ob-
viously possessed, but claimed
others, including the quality of
altruism. He could persuade
himself (but not his wife) that the
sweat of his brow had been poured
out primarily for the benefit of
his family. His helpmeet knew
better, and did not hesitate to
tell him that he preferred things
(sticks and stuff) to persons.
The subtlety of this apprecia-
tion, coming from a very homely
intelligence, surprised me, yet
it was not quite so clever as it
seemed. The truth of the trouble was
that Quinney did not make any dis-
tinction between things and persons.
His wife and his daughter he regarded
(quite kindly) as chattels that served
his needs or ministered to his sense
of beauty; in one he found the utility
of a kitchen dresser, in the other the
charm of a Dresden porcelain.
Mr. WACHELL might well have been
contented with his brilliant character-
study, but he too is an honest man, and
meant that we should have our money's
worth. So he threw in a plot which
turned upon the love-affair of Miss
Quinney and her father's skilled work-
man, and was complicated by a deal in
which Quinney's honesty was compro-
mised by a fake that had escaped him.
The
The
The
interest of it was never very poignant.
The real interest was intended to lie in
the action going on in the character of
Quinney under the pressure of circum-
stance and experience. We were to
gather that he came to readjust his
views of the relative value of things and
persons. But I detected very little
modification in his character up to
quite the end, and I never have much
faith in curtain repentances.
Yet it was a drama all right, and
Mr. VACHELL had not forgotten his
Classics. I cannot recall any hero of
Greek tragedy who was actually a

dealer in antiques, yet there was some-
thing a little Sophoclean about this
picture of an honest man struggling
with adverse conditions which were not
wholly of his own making. On the
other hand I will say nothing of the
Sophoclean quality of the scene where
Quinney looks on at the nocturnal love-
tryst from behind a screen, and his
daughter says, “Fancy if Daddy could
see us now.” This very elementary
irony was obviously designed for
beginners.
Mr. HENRY AINLEY had fitted him-
self tight into the skin of Quinney.
This is the second fine character-study
that he has given us since he retired
from the profession of jeune premier.
The same demand was not here made
Adventure; but, if his performance of
Quinney was rather assimilative than
creative the difference was one of char-
acter, and in both parts Mr. AINLEY did
his work just about as well as it could
be done.
Miss SYDNEY FAIRBROTHER, as the
protesting phantom of a wife, had little
to say, but her rare and unobtrusive
interventions had a pleasant caustic
quality. As Posy Quinney Miss MARIE
HEMINGway was a very dainty figure
and acted with great spirit. Mr. GoD-
FREY TEARLE, foreman and lover, showed
his usual easy reserve of strength; and
the succulent humour of Mr. A.
G. PoultoN as Quinney's brother-
in-law, a gentleman who thought
that one honest member was
enough for any family of dealers,
made me very tolerant of his
detestable morals.
The first night's performance
moved as smoothly as if the play
had been running since the War
began, and I shall ask Mr. LYALL
SweTE, who produced it, to share
the thanks and compliments
which I now distribute broad-
cast upon all those who conspired
to give me so delectable an
evening.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
SINCE Loneliness (HUTCHINSON) is unhappily the last
novel we shall read over the signature of Robert HUGH
BENson I wish I could with truth call it at least one of his
best. But to write this would be a poor tribute to a dis-
tinguished memory; the fact being that, though it has
qualities of power and observation, it is very far below
some others of its author's works. For one thing, in his
theme (marriage between a Roman Catholic and a Pro-
testant) he is more frankly polemical than ever. The factor
of religion is naturally never absent from his stories; but
they have won their position by their humanity rather than
by any more controversial qualities; and in Loneliness the
humanity is lacking. Marion Tenterden, the heroine, is a
young woman who has risen from obscurity to fame and
fortune by the possession of a marvellous voice. She had
been a devout Romanist, but in the fierce light that beats
upon a successful prima-donna her religion lost something
of its hold, especially when she found herself in conflict
with authority over the question of her intended marriage.
Deliberately and one by one all the joys that make life
worth living from a worldly standpoint are withdrawn
from Marion. Her voice fails; her betrothed—a little
inhumanly—retires from the engagement; and, worst
of all, her familiar friend, Maggie Brent, far the best
character in the book, is killed in a motor accident.
Throughout I was reminded of a shrewd criticism made by
where he speaks of those cultured, attractive and apparently
broad-minded Anglicans who in Robert HUGH’s pages are
foredoomed to collapse before the snuffy village priest.
You must read this story; but it will not make you forget
the far better things that you already owe to the same pen.
There appears to be no diminution in the cult of the
crook, either in fiction or drama. The latest exponent of
the gentle art of police-baiting is Mr. MAX RITTENBERG,
who has strung a volume of adventure-stories round the
figure of John Hallard, and published them under the some-
what cryptic title of Gold and Thorns (WARD, Lock). I
have often admired Mr. RITTENBERG's method before this;
he has an easy and faintly cynical humour that makes
agreeable reading. But I can't say that the present
volume shows him to advantage. The fact is that the
exploits of Hallard scarcely give the author scope for his
best. The trail of the popular magazine is over them all a
little too palpably. Hallard and his wife and their con-
federate (who called themselves Sir Ralph and Lady
Kenrick and servant) move largely in the cosmopolitan
smart set of swindlers and financiers who haunt inter-
national watering-places—a milieu especially beloved of the
less expensive monthly journals. Their adventures vary
pleasingly from the swindling of a dusky potentate at
Venice to the discovery of faked treasure-trove at Monte
Carlo. Myself I liked best the very promising scheme by
which a floating casino was to be established in a liner
anchored outside the jurisdiction limit of Rapallo. In this,

scores by one adventurer after another, ending with the
victorious emergence of Hallard. Practically all the tales
have this feature in common, that the persons swindled are
no better than the swindlers, so there is no one for whom
you need be sorry; paste cuts paste throughout, and the
moral of the whole appears to be that when rogues fall out
there will generally be a third and greater rogue to come
by the booty. Which may all be quite good fun, if a little
mechanical. There is one excellent illustration, which the
publishers were so certain I should like that they have
triplicated it (it appears on wrapper, cover and frontispiece),
but without acknowledgment of the artist's name.
Patricia (PUTNAM) I should call a placid novel rather
than a brilliant. EDITH HENRIETTA Fowler (Mrs. Robert
HAMILTON) has considerable gifts of observation, though in
her character drawing she is perhaps a little prone to over-
emphasis. Also she knows the life of which she treats;
has seen, for example, what a singularly uncomfortable
abode a country rectory can be, and is not afraid to say
being informed of their demise. Mr. STEPHEN GRAHAM's
introduction to this re-issue by UNwIN of an English
rendering promises the reader much, and Mr. GRAHAM is
a better judge than I. Perhaps the rather matter-of-fact
translation was responsible for a little of my disappoint-
ment. . But no one can fail to appreciate this sort of
thing:—“So that's the procurator!" (says Tchitchikoff
as the funeral procession passes). “He has lived and now
he has died; and now they will print in the newspapers
that he died regretted by his subordinates and by all man-
kind, a respected citizen, a wonderful father, a model
husband; and soon they will, no doubt, add that he was
accompanied to his grave by the tears of widows and
orphans; but in sooth, when one comes to examine the
matter thoroughly, all one will find in confirmation of these
statements is that he had wonderfully thick eyebrows 1 "
Una Field, introduced to us at the opening of Mr. WILLIAM
HEwleTT's book as The Child at the Window (SECKER) of
a country vicarage, bewails herself bitterly at the close of
so. Patricia had to go and
live in the rectory with a kind
uncle and aunt on the death
of her father. Before that
she had been quite well off
and by way of leading the
fuller life. Her frocks, for
instance, were of the latest.
At the same time her taste
in dress was not what I can
applaud, as when journeying
with her relatives to the
rectory she wore such thin
shoes and stockings that on
the muddy walk from the cab
to the front door she got cold
feet. Of course Patricia makes
a mild sensation in her rural
surroundings, which is in-
creased when the son of the
local big-wig turns out to be
one whose society she had
tolerated in the fuller life.
There are some well-observed
sketches of character, one of them, the Rector's wife,
touched with real beauty. For the rest it is all quite
gentle, and just a little reminiscent of the Parish Magazine;
though the interest certainly quickens with Patricia's
publishing indiscretions, which I shall not reveal. Still
lemonade, one might call it, with just a suspicion here
and there of some strictly non-alcoholic champagne,
the result being a beverage rather for the thirsty drainer
of circulating-libraries than for those who require their
fiction full-bodied.
RATHER WELL.
I should suppose that the Dead Souls of NICKodai Gogol,
written in 1837, offers a not much closer picture of the
Russia of to-day than does DICKENs' Oliver Twist, written
at the same time, of our twentieth-century England. For
though we may have made a quicker pace and have many
more miles of rails and wire to the given area (and is this
not Progress?) there has happened for Russia between that
time and this the fateful freedom of the serfs or “souls.”
This classic novel of Gogol's describes the adventures of
a plausible rogue, Tchitchikoff, who has a get-rich-quick
scheme, quite in the manner of the best American business
farces, for begging or purchasing at a ridiculously low rate,
to sell at a profit, those serfs who, though actually dead,

the volume on finding that she
is still an onlooker at life, and
no more gifted with under-
standing than she was at the
beginning; and this after ex-
periences far more varied and
peculiar than are usually
vouchsafed to vicars' daughters,
even though dowered with ex-
ceptional beauty and rich im-
pulsive godmothers. Really, I
could have warned Una quite
early that, if she wanted to
hear the world's heartbeat,
she wasn't going on the right
tack. She seemed to think
that it ought to beat loud
enough to attract her atten-
tion when she was busy with
other things—chiefly herself.
Never was there a lady who
received so much kindness
and made so little use of it.
I need not follow in detail
her depressing career from the time when, after being most
generously brought up and educated by her godmother,
she ran away (omitting the formality of marriage) with
Cecil Rowan, left him on finding him to be what others
had expected, and accepted the charity of Sybil Grey, a
school friend of whose doubtful character and tastes she
had full cognisance. Later, however, she took a dislike to
her friend's habits, and went away suddenly without a
murmur of thanks. Nor did she feel any obligations
towards the Rev. Philip Corthwaite, an old adorer, whom
she married for the sake of a husband and a home; but
made an attempt to captivate Sybil's brother, another
cleric. He, sensibly enough, would have none of her, and
hurried off into the bosom of the Roman Catholic Church.
Una's godmother and husband eventually forgave her all
these peccadilloes that I have cursorily indicated, and a
lot more that I have no time to record, and Mrs. Majendie
persuaded her to start again with Philip. I wish him
luck. And I ought to add that Mr. HEwleTT has a real
gift of characterisation, though the colours he uses are
sometimes too startling to seem quite natural. His de-
scriptive powers, also considerable, are often spent, regret-
tably enough, on subjects and scenes either sordid or
absolutely distasteful. I should like him to write a book

THE GREAT PEACE OF 1920.
By our own SENSATION Novel.IST, TEMPORARILY
UNEMPLOYED.
(Author of The Nert War; England Attacked; The Empire's Peril,
and other like works.)
CHAPTER I.
SEATED here in my study, and looking back upon the
tremendous happenings of the past year, I can remember
as though it were yesterday the August evening when there
burst upon an amazed and wholly unprepared world the
news that Peace, so often foretold and as often discredited,
had actually been declared by Germany upon England.
What one finds most incredible, in retrospect, was the
suddenness of the blow. To a people who had been for
years lapped in the fog of war it came like lightning out of
a sandstorm, like truth from a Teuton, like anything that
is wholly bewildering and unexpected. The newspapers
of the day before the great event make strange reading
now. All appears to have been going on absolutely as at
any time during the past six years. The usual Zeppelins
were bombing blackbirds in the suburbs of Sheringham.
In The Daily Telegram Dr. Pillon had his habitual article
upon “The imminence of Balkan intervention.” . All, in
short, was as long custom had habituated us to it. And
then, quite suddenly, the cataclysm. -
I have heard since that they had rumours of it in many
quarters of London quite early on that afternoon; but the
news did not reach us at Woking (where I was then
living) before nightfall. Even the late editions contained
no more than the intimation of an unusually prolonged
sitting of the Cabinet. Smith, my neighbour, who dropped
in from number five, Warsaw Willas, for his after-dinner
pipe had heard only a vague report of a certain liveliness
in Downing Street. So it was actually not till the following
morning, when I opened my daily paper, that I knew the
Even then, you know, one hardly realized. Not even
when Smith himself, purple and incoherent, burst in through
the breakfast-room window (which I should perhaps
explain was a French one, and open at the moment).
“You’ve heard 2 ” Words failed him. As for me I could
only stare, bewildered by something strange and unfamiliar
in the appearance of my old friend. Smith indeed had
lost no time. Gone was the customary suit of sober khaki
that he had worn so long as a private in the Underwriters' |
Battalion; and instead he now stood revealed in all the
panoply of the full dress of the Brookwood Golf Club, scarlet ||
coat, heather mixture stockings, and all. -
Smith saw my look, and answered it. “Of course,” he
cried, “everybody's going. The road to the links is crowded
already. It's Peace now, and no mistake 1 " . . . .
Slowly I began to understand. *-
One remembers that day as a kind of dream. The stupen-
dous change that had come upon everything and everybody! ||
In the train one heard it (for after a moment I had ||
decided that, in spite of Smith, my own place in the hour ||
of crisis was London). Men crowded the carriages, or j
stood about in groups at the stations, discussing excitedly |
the one topic. Most of them still wore their every-day |
khaki, but here and there was one, bolder than the rest,
who already displayed, a little awkwardly, some symbol of |
the New Era—a bowler-hat perhaps, or even an umbrella, )
held with an air of self-consciousness in hands so long
unused to anything more conspicuous than a Lee-Enfield.
England, you perceive, was waking gradually. ...
And the scraps of talk one heard. Almost as unfamiliar
some of it as Flemish must once have been. “If you
take away State-aid from the Church ” a man would
be saying; and another, “The vital question is simply
this—can CARSON be coerced ?” It was really astonishing
how quickly they had recovered the trick of it.
I fancy that full and complete comprehension came to
me from two sources almost at the same moment. I had
bought a score of papers, and torn them eagerly open.
Each was more lurid and sensational than the last. Head-
lines in leaded type swam before my eyes—headlines that
I had never looked to read again in this blandly bellicose
existence to which I had grown so used. “Where are
you going to spend August 2" “Is sea-bathing deleteri-
ous 2 " “Should children contradict 2" and the like. But
still I read as in a dream.
Then suddenly I saw two things. First, at the foot
of the Haymarket, I observed, making his way through
a crowd murmuring with admiration, a knut, a real knut,
of the knuttiest age, twenty at most, in absolutely full
peace-kit, down to monocle and spats. And almost at the
same moment my motor-bus was held up to permit the
passage of a column of females carrying banners. What
were they 2 I turned to my neighbour, who, I noticed,
had grown suddenly pale. - -
“Suffragettes 1" he whispered unsteadily, “walking to
Hyde Park for a demonstration 1 That means Peace with
a vengeancel ”
It did. At his words the scales fell from my eyes, and
I saw the truth of this amazing occurrence. And with
that vision came also another thought, one that sent the
blood racing to my heart, and froze it there. The girl I
loved, the heroine of this work, Clorinda Fitz-Eustace,
was even now quietly at work as a red-cross nurse in a
field hospital. At this very hour perhaps she might be
quitting its gentle shade to adventure herself, all uncon-
scious of danger, amid the hazards of Peace. I saw then
that it must be mine to warn and save her. But how?

THE WATCH DOGS.
xWII
DEAR CHARLEs, – All of us have
changed, a little or a lot, under the
stress of actual war, but the most
dismal case of all is that of our young
but highly respected friend, Stevenson.
You remember him, of course; as
simple-minded and kindly-hearted a
fellow as you could wish to meet,
a lover of small children and dogs,
an ardent member of all the Preven-
tion Societies and a peculiarly zealous
churchwarden. For some time his
cap has been assuming an aggressive,
almost vindictive, angle, and his eye-
brows grow hourly more ferocious; but
so much is forgivable in these days.
It is now, however, worse than that.
A week ago he informed us, with what
I am reluctantly forced to describe as
an ugly leer, that he was not accompany-
ing us to the trenches this time, adding
that so far from shirking the unpleasant
duties of the present he was preparing
himself for even more unpleasant pur-
poses in the near future. In short he
had secured the office of Master Bom-
bardier of the regiment, and has since
infernal machines and practising the art
of pitching them accurately in tender
spots. He is now known amongst us
as the Anarchist ; is openly accused
of all the worst anti-tendencies, and
is suspected of having applied to the
War Office for special leave to drop
the official khaki and assume an inde-
pendent red in his neckwear. We tell
him that his old vocation, Municipal
something or other, is gone; but he
says that another trade, more sinister
and exciting, will be open to him
when Peace arrives for the rest of us.
His advertisement will read:—“All
authority, monarchical, aristocratic or
democratic, and all other tiresome
restrictions on individual liberty re-
moved with secrecy, ability and des-
patch. All ceremonies attended and
dealt with. Coronations extra.” Such
a nice quiet fellow he was, too!
It is said that for every man in the
trenches there are four outside. But
I am told that these others have also
their embarrassed moments, and not
least the Company Quarter-Master-
Sergeants, whose duty it is to keep us
armed and equipped, clothed and fed.
As modest fellows who dislike being
dark, and carry up to the trenches our
food, drink and fuel at dead of night
by means of long-suffering fatigue
parties who stumble up from the stores
to the trenches as best they can
through the mud and shell-holes,
hedges, ditches, telephone wires and
stray bullets. It is a matter, as I used
to write in my legal opinions of long
ago, “not wholly free from difficulty,”
and our industrious “Quarters” prefers,
at times, to supervise the loaded pro-
cession personally. The other night,
what with the rain and wind in
addition to the other distractions above
indicated, he found it an especially trying
operation. Time after time the party
broke away into small units, one de-
viating to the right, another to the
left, a third dropping to the rear and
a fourth proceeding to a front but,
unhappily, the wrong front. With much
running hither and thither and much
harsh whispering, our Quarters would
get them together again and bearing
for safety, but the last check of all,
occurring when the party were well
under fire, was almost, he tells me,
fatal. It was in the midst of his
searchings on this occasion that he

devoted all his energies to contriving

of the one fatigue man he had man-
aged to collect and keep—“Quarters!
Quarters!” At such times distress of
this sort has to be ignored, but this
voice was so persistent as eventually to
arrest Quarters' attention. “Quarters!"
whispered the voice. “Yes, lad,” an-
swered he. “Is that you, Quarters 2 ”
continued the voice, changing from the
distressed to the chatty. “Yes,” said
Quarters irritably, since the flare lights
were becoming unpleasantly frequent
and near, and the identity and where-
abouts of the party must soon become
apparent to the busy rifles on the
German parapet. “Quarters,” whis-
pered the voice, with damnable itera-
tion, “I want a new pair of trousers
and a cap badge.” On my honour,
Charles, this is a true bill.
I was present, unofficially, at a dis-
cussion yesterday in the trenches, at
felonious intent. Did I not stop at
stealing my own servant's socks? No,
Charles, I did not. Further and worse,
I woke the wretched fellow up to ask
him where the devil he'd hidden them.
Can you wonder that every time I show
my head above the parapet a hundred
or so lovers of justice do their best
to make an example of me?

which four of our less T
sedate youngsters were
debating snipers in
general, and, in particu-
lar, one of this unpopu-
lar class who is suspected
of carrying on business
in a partly demolished
farmhouse on our half-
left. They were con-
sidering the steps to be
taken less to prevent
than to punish him.
The suggestion of the
youngest of the party
appeared to me the most
subtle; it was obviously
reminiscent of his mis-
spent boyhood at home.
“I should creep out to
the farmhouse door by night,” said
he, impressively, “and listen for my-
self to find out if the sniper was
inside.” “And if he was 2" asked the
others. “Then,” said the incorrigible,
speaking slowly and with a due sense
of climax, “I should ring the front door

anything better calculated to annoy
and make justly indignant a wholly
preoccupied and slightly nervous
sniper ?

still continue, even at this juncture, to

WHO CAN IT BE THAT THEY ARE DISCUSSING 2
THE PHARISEE AND THE PUBLICAN.
(A Sketch in War-Time.)
ONE day last week a Cheerful Miller
met a Despondent Brewer in the street.
“Well, how 's business?” asked the
Cheerful Miller tactlessly, rubbing his
hands. -
The Despondent Brewer's reply was
clothed in language which seemed to
intimate that business prospects were
not superlatively good.
“For your own sake, personally, I
am grieved to hear it,” said the Cheer-
ful Miller. “But of course one cannot
overlook certain aspects of your trade
that render its decline beneficial to the
public at large.”
The Despondent Brewer, a blunt,
outspoken man, made reply, and made
it good and strong. But the cheerful-
ness of the Cheerful Miller was deep-
T] rooted in prosperity, and
was not to be disturbed
even by the blasts of the
Brewer's despondency.
“Now my trade, hap-
pily, is free from any
such taint,” continued
the Cheerful Miller.
Pointing to the contents
of a baker's shop he said,
“Look there; that mer-
chandise never did harm
to anyone.”
The Despondent
Brewer looked, first at
the crisp brown loaves,
and then at a woman who
had entered the shop to
buy. The woman carried
— a baby; two other chil-
dren were with her, holding on to her
torn skirt. The Despondent Brewer
saw her place a very large sum of
money on the counter and receive in
exchange a very small loaf.
Hitherto we have refrained from
giving the exact words which the De-
spondent Brewer uttered to the Cheer-
ful Miller. But we will now tell you
exactly what he said.
“Thank God, I'm not a Miller,” said
the Despondent Brewer.

“The Lewes Guardians have sanctioned an

perience. It was stated that the officers wished
the men to learn some useful trade in addition
to military duty. The chairman said he hardly
liked the idea of amateurs experimenting on
old men's shins, but other members said the
barber guaranteed the work being done satis-
factorily.”—Birmingham Daily Post.

MY CRIMINAL.
I HAVE seen one at last.
After years of intimacy with the Zoo,
during which I have sought in vain
for the pickpockets of which so man
notices bid us beware, I have had the
satisfaction of watching one at work
there—as flagrantly as that historic but
un-named performer who abstracted a
snuffbox from a courtier under the eyes
of CHARLES II., and by his roguish
shamelessness made the Merry Monarch
an accomplice.
The words “Beware of Pickpockets'
had indeed confronted me for so long
and in so many places in these other-
wise so innocent Gardens that I had
come to look upon them as the “Wolf
Wolf' " of the fable. Even in the lions'
house at feeding time when, tradition
has it, the pupils of Fagin are at their
very best, I have never detected a
practitioner.
But yesterday !
Yesterday was the first day of blazing
sunshine, and having two hours to
spare in the afternoon I rushed to
Regent's Park, intending to make an
exhaustive tour of the whole Zoo. ...But
it was so hot and prematurely summery
that instead I did a thing I have never
done before: I sat on a chair in the
path up and down which the elephants
'slowly parade, bearing loads of excited |
children and self-conscious adults; and
it was there that I found the pick-
pocket, or, if you like, it was there
that he found me. For I was one of
his victims.
I had always thought of pickpockets
as little chaps capable of slipping away
even between men's legs in a crowd;
but this fellow was big. I had thought,
too, of pickpockets as carrying on their
nefarious profession with a certain
secrecy and furtiveness; but the Zoo
pickpocket, possibly from sheer cynic-
ism, or from sheer advantage of size,
making most of the officials look insig-
nificant and weakly, was at few or no
pains to cover his depredations. Nor
did he, as I supposed was the custom
of his kind, devote himself to watches,
pocket-books and handkerchiefs, but
took whatever he could, and if a bag
chanced to have something in it and he
could not extract the contents quickly
enough he took the bag as well. He
was indeed brazen ; but scatheless too.
My own loss was trifling—merely a
newspaper, which I would have given
him had he asked for it. But before I
knew anything it was snatched from
my hands by this voracious thief. To
say that I was astonished would be to
state the case with absurd mildness; I
was electrified. But when I looked

GETTING A MOVE ON.
WE are the Fourth Loamshires.
(Dear old Loamshire, my own county
—I once passed through it in a train.)
Of course there is no such place as
Loamshire really, as your little boy
would tell you, but I have to disguise
the regiment. For why? The answer
is “King's Regulations, para. 453,
Communications to Press – Penalty,
Death or such less punishment as the
Court awards.” So you will under-
stand that this is purely fictitious—at
any rate, until after the war. The name,
the events, the documents, the conver-
sations, they are all invented; nothing
in the least like this ever happened or
ever could happen. My only excuse
for writing is that we subalterns have
a couple of seconds all to ourselves
every morning between the word “Fix”
and the word “Bayonets,” and that
one must do something in one's leisure.
“Platoon, at-ten-shun / I'la, ” I
take my note-book out, and proceed to
put down for you this extremely im-
aginative story. . . .
The rumour started, like all good
rumours, in the Sergeants' Mess. “I
hear we're going to Blinksea,” said
the Sergeant-Major, unbending for a
moment. “Anywhere out of this
blighted place,” said the most lately
promoted Corporal, just to show his
independence. Next day it was all
over the battalion.
A fortnight later it was officially
announced in Orders. We were going
to Blinksea on Monday, and the Blink-
shires were coming to our own little
watering-spot (Shellbeach) in exchange.
They sent one Major and a few men as
an advance party to Shellbeach, and
we sent two Majors and a few men
as an advance party to Blinksea ; we
were always a little prodigal with our
Majors. -
As soon as they were satisfied that
the advance party had arrived, and
that we had all sent our new address
home to our wives and mothers, the
Authorities postponed the move till
Saturday week. We bore it stoically—
particularly our Majors. Our Majors
immediately wrote that it was hardly
worth while coming back such a long
way for such a few days; that Blinksea
was a delightful spot with a first-
class hotel and an excellent golf-course;
and that they were longing to get
to work again. So they stayed, and
on the Wednesday the great pack-up
began.
We all had our special jobs. Nobody
was safe anywhere. Orderlies popped
out from behind every bush and handed
you a buff-coloured O.H.M.S. envelope.

likely; just a blunt note from the Adju-

dred notes went out and not a “please"

structed to take the Mess billiard-table
down to the Pier. If you require
assistance — ” and so on. All quite
firm.
It was a wonderful time. Even the
Captains put their backs into it for
once. They looked after the regimental
lizard, or watched the Colonel's horse
embarking, or told the subalterns to get
on with it; no job was too strenuous
for them. And by mid-day Friday
it was done. Everything had gone-
machine guns, horses, stores, ammuni-
tion, the safe (I carried this down my-
self; luckily it wasn't a very hot day),
the officers' heavy luggage—it was all
on the sea. And by the “officers' heavy
luggage” I don't only mean their boots.
The Colonel's man, always the first to
set an example to the battalion, had
left the Colonel with what he stood up
in and (in case he got wet through on
the Friday afternoon) the cord of his
dressing gown; and the hint was taken
by us others. I assure you we left our-
selves very little to carry with us on the
Saturday; the Adjutant himself only
had a couple of “Memo.” forms.
At two o'clock the Authorities rang
up.
“Everything on board 2"
“Everything, Sir,” replied the Adju-
tant.
“Quite sure?”
“Everything, Sir, except the cord
of the Colonel's dressing-gown and a
couple of “Memo.' forms.”
“Well, get those on board, too,” said
the Authorities sharply.
So they went, too. We were now
ready. We had taken an affectionate
farewell of Shellbeach. The tradesmen
had sent in their bills (and in some
cases been paid). The Parson had
preached a wonderful valedictory ser-
mon, telling us what fine fellows we all
were, wishing us luck in our new sur-
roundings, and asking us not to forget
him. At six o'clock on Saturday morn-
ing we were to be off.
And then the Authorities rang up
again.
“Everything on board now?”
“Everything, Sir. It's nearly at
Blinksea by this time.”
“Right. Then now you'd better see
how quickly you can get it all back
again. The move is off.”
The Adjutant bore up bravely.
“Is it off altogether,” he asked, “ or
“Neither,” said the Authorities
coldly. “It is deferred." '
The only excitement left was to see
what sort of recovery from an appar-
ently hopeless position the Parson
would make next Sunday. On the
whole he did well. He preached a
lengthy sermon upon the inscrutable
decrees of Providence. A. A. M.

Some forty years agone,

THE SPECIAL DETECTIVE.
I AM a Special Detective. It came
about in this way. When the Special
Constables were being enrolled I offered
my services for duty on Saturday after-
noons from 4.30 to 5, so as to allow
the regular policeman to go off for
afternoon tea. I couldn't volunteer to
serve any longer as I had to have a
singing lesson at 5.15. However, they
refused my offer, and as I still wanted
to help I appointed myself an un-
official Special Detective—the only
One.
I don't suppose you would ever guess
what I was if you saw me in the street,
because I always go about disguised
when on duty. When I am disguised
I can detect things which I should
never dream of detecting in propria
persona. For instance, were I just
wearing my usual clothes and my
ordinary face, I should not attempt to
interfere with an armed burglar in the
execution of what, rightly or wrongly,
he conceives to be his duty. I should
go home. If the occasion demanded
it, I should even go to the length of
remaining at home until I had grown
or perhaps the complete set, according
to the requirements of the character I
proposed to assume.
I remember once detecting a desper-
ate villain in the act of emptying a
perambulator full of practically new
children into the canal at Basingstoke.
As I happened at the moment to be
disguised in the totally unsuitable garb
of a member of the Junior Athenaeum
Club I refrained from interfering. I
contented myself with tapping him on
the shoulder (I forget which), explain-
ing my difficulty to him, advising him
that I should return in due course and
severely arrest him, and finally warning
him that anything he might say in the
meantime would be taken down, suit-
ably edited, and used in evidence against
him.
I then returned to town and com-
menced at once to grow a luxuriant
vegetation of whiskers. You see, it
was my intention to disguise myself
as an Anabaptist, and then go back to
Basingstoke and seize my man, if
possible, red-handed; if not, whatever
colour his hand happened to be. How-
ever, hair-raising is not so easy as it
looks, for although I read all the ghost
actually spent several hours a day
under the forcing-pot in the company
of the rhubarb, it was a long time :
before my whiskers were long enough #
to infuriate Mr. FRANK RICHARDSON.
The consequence was that when I
eventually returned to the scene of the
crime I found that the villain had com-
pleted his thankless task and had in
all probability gone home to a guilty
meal. The indifference displayed by
the criminal classes to their impending
fate is proverbial. Yet how this heart-
less desperado ever summoned up the
effrontery to clear off after I had ex-
pressly informed him that I was coming
back to arrest him passes my compre-
hension. Anyhow, I examined the sur-
face of the canal thoroughly, but as it
was quite smooth, without a hole in it
anywhere, it is just possible that I was
mistaken, and that the miscreant was
only intending to wash his offspring.
Or, again, they may not have been
children at all, but merely turnips or |
cauliflowers. Personally, I am often ||
unable to distinguish between a very
new child and a turnip. I once men-
tioned this failing to a friend. He was

which was a singularly fatuous remark
to make, because, as it happens, I have
a baby of my own, though only a very
small one. What I don't possess is a
turnip of my own. -
Then, too, there is the important
matter of clues. How often one reads
in the newspapers that detectives are
handicapped for want of clues! From
| the very outset of my career I deter-
mined that I would never be handi-
capped in this manner, and therefore I
have my own set of clues which I always
carry about with me. I have got a very
good footprint from which I expect great

I gave myself a medal for that. On
another occasion I stopped a cheque just
in the nick of time. For this I presented
myself with an illuminated address,
and only by the exercise of great self-
control refrained from awarding myself
the freedom of my native town. On yet
a third occasion I successfully traced a
German spy to his lair. I heard him
talking German as he passed me (I was
disguised at the time I remember as a
Writer to the Signet), and never shall
I forget the look of utter despair he
gave when I forced him to disclose
his real name, which was Gwddylch
Apgwchllydd. Next time I bring off a
coup—as we call it—I have marked
myself down for promotion.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Tuesday, 27th
April.-Both Houses engaged in con-
sideration of treatment of British
prisoners in Germany. In time past
have had sharp differences. To-day
united in detestation of barbarities prac-
tised upon helpless captives. Idea of
retaliation unanimously discarded. As
Lord NEwton put it, if there is to
be competition in brutality there is
no doubt that we should be outdis-
tanced. Possible, indeed probable, that
one result of the War will be capture
of German trade, but, when it comes
to brutalities “made in Germany,”
competition hopeless.
Idea of paying off on bodies of
German prisoners in this country the
cowardly cruelty dealt out to our gallant
officers and men who have fallen into
human hands less merciful than Death
is unthinkable. Great Britain is not
going to soil her hands because Ger-
many has irretrievably fouled hers.
Still, something must be done in the
way of meting out due punishment to
responsible authorities who have en-
couraged or permitted their subordin-
ates to torture, starve and grossly
insult those whom the fortunes of war
KitchENER, not given to strong lan-
guage, put his indictment in a few
terse sentences, not based upon rumour
but substantiated by unquestioned
personal testimony.
“Our prisoners,” he said, “have
been stripped and maltreated in various
ways. In some cases evidence goes
to prove that they have been shot in
cold blood. Our officers, even when
wounded, have been wantonly insulted
and frequently struck.”
No passion displayed during debate
in either House. There is a profundity
of human anger too deep for words.
But something ominous in the sharp
stern cheer which greeted the PREMIER's
emphatic declaration.
“When we come to an end of this
war—which please God we may—we
shall not forget, and we ought not to
forget, this horrible record of calculated
cruelty and crime. We shall hold it to
be our duty to exact reparation against
those who are proved to have been
the guilty agents and actors.”

on telling you that an apophthegm is a pithy saying and
that you don't know how to spell it.”

to do it; but I'll ring for the maids, if you like, and call

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE PLAY.
“ BETTY.'" .
THE story of Cinderella being the
best story in the world, and each new
Cinderella giving it freshness, any play
based upon it is fairly certain of success.
So Betty, by Miss GLADYs UNGER, and
Mr. FREDERICK LoNsdale, should be
in for a long run at Daly's, for not
only is the Cinderella theme deftly
handled, but in Miss WINIFRED BARNES
a very sympathetic actress has been
found for what is probably the most
sympathetic part that the wit of story-
teller or dramatist will ever devise.
Two surprises are in store for the
habitué of this comfortable theatre: one
agreeable and the other disappointing.
The agreeable surprise is that for the
first time a musical comedy has some
| real acting in it, as distinguished from
| the facile singing and dancing and
talking of the pleasant ladies and
gentlemen upon whose shoulders the
slender burden of dramatic verisimili-
tude in such pieces usually rests; and
| the other surprise is that, for once,
Daly's has little but thin and very
ordinary music. The acting is con-
tributed principally by Mr. DoNALD
CALTHROP and Mr. C. M. LowNE,
both new-comers to musical comedy.
Their gifts are welcome because the
audience has to be persuaded of the
reality of the young scapeg ace peer and
his father the duke's indignant aristo-
cratic tyranny. Without this reality
we should not be sufficiently touched
| by the position of Betty, the kitchen-
maid so capriciously selected by the
young lord as his wife; and to be
touched by her is of the essence of
the play. Miss WINIFRED BARNEs
herself sees to that too, although it
is Mr. CALTHROP on whom the chief
responsibility lies, and he succeeds ad-
mirably; but Miss BARNEs is charming
in her simple sincerity, and her singing
completes her conquest.
The humorous honours go to Mr.
G. P. HUNTLEY, who has never been
funnier or kindlier. Nor has he ever
been more idiosyncratic. I came away
with the feeling that he ought perma-
nently to adopt this rôle of the short-
sighted, warm-hearted, affable, idiotic
yet fitfully shrewd Lord Playne; that
some arrangement should be come to
by which in this character he should
be made free of the stage of all other
theatres, to wander irresponsibly
through whatever other plays most
needed him. I would not even confine
him to one theatre; he should do two or
even three houses a night, if necessary.
Every play thus adorned, I care not by
whom written, would be the better for
a real place; he is important if not
necessary to the story, whereas poor
Mr. W. H. BERRY, who has so often
destroyed my gravity at this house, is
not. The trouble about Mr. BERRY's
part is that it is obviously an
afterthought, added as an embarrass-
ment of riches. Neither he nor his
sprightly feminine foil, Miss BEATRICE
SEALBY, is in the picture, nor has Mr.
BERRY, who is one of the best of our
comedians, anything yet to do that is
worthy of his gifts. Time, however, is
always on the side of such performers;
more jokes will be dropped in and
funnier songs substituted. I feel per-
fectly confident that in a month's time
Mr. BERRY's part will be adequate once
In Ore. s
The last scene, of which (no doubt
to the intense astonishment of the
audience) a staircase is a prominent
feature, is gay and distinguished beyond
anything now on the stage; and I
congratulate Mr. Royce on his triumph.
But I retain as the most charming
pictorial moment of the evening Betty's
appearance in her going-away dress in
Act II. That dress is the prettiest
thing in London. V.
At the Palace Theatre, on Tuesday
next, May 11th, at 2.30, Messrs.
VEDRENNE and EADIE are to give a
matinée of the popular play, The Man
who stayed at Home. The performance
is in aid of The Officers' Family Fund,
of which the QUEEN is Patroness and
Lady LANSDown E President. The KING
and QUEEN have graciously promised

“It's my belief you don't know

public-house orator, exasperated to an
unusual degree by the continued silence
of the big, stolid-looking man sitting
opposite him. ſ -
The silent man raised his eyebrows
and waved his pipe in the air, to inti-
mate that he took no interest whatever
in the orator's beliefs or disbeliefs.
“Garn, you don't know there's a

tauntingly. “Leastways, you don't

pose, the speaker was emboldened to
proceed. .
“It's my belief you don't care who
wins the War, so long as you ain't

“You’re a pro-German, that's what
you are; and I always had my sus-

floor with his heels and thrust his
hands yet deeper into his pockets.
The argumentative man was nearly
at the end of his tether. “Nothing

without removing his pipe from his
mouth. “It ain't worth my while to

crossing his legs and taking his hands
out of his pockets.
“An Independent Labourer,” was the
triumphant answer. “That's what

sentence remained unfinished. The
silent man's fist shot out, and the
orator found himself on the floor

him.

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THE industry of Mr. G. B. BURGIN seems only equalled
by the fertility of his invention. This reflection was evoked
by my discovery, opposite the title-page of The Herb of
Healing (HUTCHINSoN), of a list of forty-eight other books
by the same author. It makes me blink. Of course, when
any human writer has so many pages to cover he must of
necessity spread his plots a little sparingly. The plot of
Herb of Healing, for example, is rather thin stuff, the quest
of a lover called Old Man (he was but twenty-four really,
so the name is misleading) for an Indian herb which should
restore the consumptive schoolmistress whom he loved.
You guess that Mr. BURGIN is here back again in the
Ottawa setting, where you have perhaps enjoyed meeting
him before. There are other interests, notably Miss Wilks.
In many ways indeed Miss Wilks deserves to be called the
chief personage of the story. She was a mule, wall-eyed,
and of such super-asinine sagacity that I began at last to
find her some tax on my credulity. Not once but many
times does she rescue the good personages, with heels and
teeth, from the attacks of the evil-minded. Dialogue is
freely ascribed to her. At one time she goes of her own
accord to be re-shod in preparation for the journey of her
master. Hereabouts I began to be haunted by a memory
of similar quadrupeds that I had seen on the pantomime
stage. Eventually of course the herb is found, the school-
mistress restored to health and the lovers united. My only
surprise in all this was that the mule did not join their

The Prussian has not exactly the knack of making him-

When Blood is their Argument (Hodder AND SToughton),
Mr. Ford MADox HUEFFER frankly adopts the bald-headed
method. The South German blood in him and the re-
membered tradition of an older, simpler, well-beloved
Germany add a bitterness which no mere outsider critic
can command. You might sum it up as the quarrel of the
Artist with the Professor (German: New Style), with all
his nationalised, organised Kunst and Kultur, his killing of
the spirit with the (dictated) letter. He thinks it is the
German Professor who has scotched for ever the leisurely
scholarship which expanded over the port wine, and has
replaced it by a formidable and loathly apparatus of
meticulously futile cramming labelled Philologie. He
airs the interesting thesis that Goethe as the literary
Superman was deliberately manufactured, in first instance,
by FALK, the evil genius behind the Kulturkampf which led
BISMARCK to his Canossa; that the incomparably greater
but intractably liberal HEINE was relatively and as de-
liberately diminished. As to BISMARCK himself, he was
“a very great, very human and quite amiable figure.”
That actor-manager autocrat, Wilhelm II., is the real
villain of the piece, and the Professors, threatened and con-
trolled to an inconceivable degree by a tyrannous bureaucratic
direction, mere dishonest mouthpieces of official doctrine.

“cast his stone at the rat of Prussianism,” as he set out to
do. And he can be very annoying, as when he opens his
epilogue with a spasm of elegiacs and “I was lying in
| bed one morning in September, 1914, reflecting on the
| death of Tibullus.” I felt that the superior person, restless
| during the earlier chapters, had at last broken out, and
| being a “general reader,” and as such frequently put in
my place throughout the book, I was annoyed. Besides,
what is to become of Mr. GEORGE MooRE's monopoly of
this sort of thing?
From childhood Michael Repton felt the call of the forest.
He dreamed strange dreams—or dreamed often the same
strange dream—of trees and still water. Elstree and
Winchester wrought a temporary cure, but, as he drew to
manhood, the woods became
| more and more of a necessity
to him, till finally he obeyed
the call. That is the main
theme of Behind the Thicket
(MAx GoschEN), the first novel
of Mr. W. E. B. HENDERson.
It is a curious, arresting book,
loosely constructed yet never
lacking grip, an odd blend of
realism and mysticism, of fan-
tastic imagery and careful de-
lineation of ordinary middle-
class life. If Mr. A R N ol D
BENNETT were to collaborate in
a novel with Mr. ARTHUR
MACHEN, each to have a free
hand, they would produce some-
thing very like it. This is not
to say that Mr. HENDERSON falls
short in originality, for that is
the last charge that could be
brought against him. It would
be easy to be flippant about
Behind the Thicket, and still
easier to be over-enthusiastic.
I am saved from the former
blunder by the genuine fascina-
|tion of the tale; from the latter
by an intermittent facetiousness
(quite out of place in a novel of
this kind), which findsexpression
in such sentences as “the moral
peculiarities of ladies odolized— - -
tut! idolized—by a grateful nation,” and “he would not fetch
and carry, though she looked fetching and carried on.” I
cannot better convey my admiration for the book as a
whole than by saying that these and similar horrors jarred
me like blows. . But it would be uncanny if a first novel
were to be flawless, and Mr. HENDERson's mistakes are few
and easily corrected. Behind the Thicket is not great work,
but it has so much promise in it of better things that one
feels justified in looking forward to the time when its
author will produce something to evoke what Mr. W. B.
MAxwell has called “the emotions experienced on widely
differing occasions by stout Cortez and slender Keats.”
“THEY TELL ME THERE's
A sad interest attaches itself to a passage in the Preface
which the late Mr. FRANK T. BULLEN wrote for his Recollec-
tions (SEELEY, SERVICE) where he states of the book, “I
really believe it may be my last.” He died while the
volume was being published. No doubt, therefore, this
collection of his random memories—“the reminiscences of

sailor, author and lecturer,” and from whose written and
spoken words so many have drawn a sincere pleasure—will
command many friends. To be honest, the chronicles
themselves, though they contain many diverting sketches
of experiences in a lecturer's life, with chairmen, hosts,
lanternists and the like, are for the most part rather small
beer. Missed trains and railway waiting-rooms may seem
to play a disproportionate part herein, to those especially
who do not share Mr. BULLEN's sense of the minor dis-
comforts of life. The fact is that the real attraction of the
book has lain (for me at least) in its revelation of a
singularly simple and unaffected personality. Things that
many of us are apt to take for granted appear to have
preserved an unusual freshness for the author of The Cruise
of the Cachalot. I like him, for a random example, upon the

possible to tell how they would

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXI. -
(From Captain HELMUT Von EISENSTAMM, at present con-
fined in an Officers' Prison Camp in England.)
ALL HIGHEST WAR LoRD,--I trust your Majesty will not
misinterpret my true feelings of devotion to your own
person and to the cause of our Fatherland if, humble as
I am, I venture to address these few lines to you. I am
a prisoner of war, removed now for these many weeks both
from the opportunity of serving my country and from the
chance of incurring death or wounds on its behalf. We
who are here are not unreasonably restrained. There is,
of course, barbed wire, and there are many sentries, as is
only natural; but we are allowed to arrange for ourselves
such amusements as we can devise, both indoors and in
the free air. We play at football, we have concerts and
dramatic representations, we lecture to one another on
subjects of interest, and the vigilance of those who guard
us, though it is to the highest point careful, is never
willingly oppressive. The food is good and plentiful.
In short, I may say that we are treated with the
consideration which is due from brave men to those
who by bad luck have fallen into their hands.
That is the case not less with the German private soldiers
who are permitted to wait upon us than with the naval
and military officers, to the number of more than a hundred
and fifty, who are confined here. The house is large and
there are many rooms; the garden and the walks are in ||
the simple English style; and when we go walking there

Commandant and his officers are not tyrants to us.
Everything, indeed, is done to make our lot as tolerable to
us as the hard circumstances permit. I have in my time
said many harsh things of the English (and some of them
are perhaps still true), but that they know how to treat
misfortune without severity and how to behave as gentle-
men—I use the English word—to enemies who are harm-
less and in distress, this I shall always henceforth affirm to
the best of my ability in the face of those who in ignorance
presume to deny it. Like LUTHER, here I stand ; I cannot
otherwise. I am sure it will give pleasure to your Majesty
to hear that this is so, for you are the father of your people,
and it would grieve your paternal heart if it were proved
under wrong or cruelty. Of these there is not, and never
has been, the smallest trace.
Yet even with all possible mitigations how wretched is
the fate of one who is a prisoner. He is in a foreign land,
and is commanded by those who are foreigners and speak
in a foreign tongue. He thinks of his own dear country
and of those he loves. It is true that he might be dead had
he not been taken, and that he would never have seen them :
again, whereas now he is in no danger; but this cannot
console him. Somehow, indeed, it seems to him to be an
aggravation of his lot, for he has not even the freedom now
to offer his life. To add to the misfortunes and sufferings
of such a man by unnecessary harshness or cruelty would
be an inhuman wickedness, and it is impossible to conceive
that any civilised nation could do this thing. To be sure;
it is stated in English newspapers which we are permitted
to read (I do not find the permission a very valuable one)
that English prisoners in Germany have been shamefully:
dealt with. It is said that they have been hooted and spat:
upon, that they were herded together in cattle-trucks filled;
with filth, and that in their prisons they are scarcely
treated as human beings. Such charges I should look
upon as necessarily untrue, but I know that war corruptsii

Majesty, if there has anywhere been such conduct, to stamp.

BACK from their mimic game of war
Against a bodiless foe,
Merry of heart and moist of pore
By Kingston Vale they go;
Gaily they swing, this eve of May,
Between the blossoms blown,
Column of route, in russet grey,
The Veteran “Devil's Own.”
And who are these that hustle by
Churning the tar and heat, -
And throw a dull and curious eye
On men that use their feet—
On men that march in thirsty ranks,
Poor hopeless imbeciles, -
When all but beggars, dogs and cranks
Career on rubber wheels? -
These are the stout Hurst Park Brigade'
| Home from the course they ride
From keeping up the noble trade
That swells the nation's pride;
For these our Army does its bit
While they in turn peruse
Death's honour-roll (should time permit)
After the Betting News.
What homage to these Kings of Sport
Should humble soldiers give? .
Why even we, mere Inns of Court,
Who pay for leave to live—
If WILLIAM ever cross the wave,

And at our own expenses save
The Manhood of the Ring. . O. S.
UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXI.
(From Captain HELMUT Von EISENSTAMM, at present con-
fined in an Officers' Prison Camp in England.)
ALL HIGHEST WAR LoRD,--I trust your Majesty will not
misinterpret my true feelings of devotion to your own
person and to the cause of our Fatherland if, humble as
I am, I venture to address these few lines to you. I am
a prisoner of war, removed now for these many weeks both
from the opportunity of serving my country and from the
chance of incurring death or wounds on its behalf. We
who are here are not unreasonably restrained. There is,
of course, barbed wire, and there are many sentries, as is
only natural; but we are allowed to arrange for ourselves
such amusements as we can devise, both indoors and in
the free air. We play at football, we have concerts and
dramatic representations, we lecture to one another on
subjects of interest, and the vigilance of those who guard
us, though it is to the highest point careful, is never
willingly oppressive. The food is good and plentiful.
In short, I may say that we are treated with the
consideration which is due from brave men to those
who by bad luck have fallen into their hands.
That is the case not less with the German private soldiers
who are permitted to wait upon us than with the naval
and military officers, to the number of more than a hundred
and fifty, who are confined here. The house is large and
there are many rooms; the garden and the walks are in ||
the simple English style; and when we go walking there
that anywhere even the least of your subjects was suffering
look out over the pleasant country which lies beyond. The
Commandant and his officers are not tyrants to us.
Everything, indeed, is done to make our lot as tolerable to
us as the hard circumstances permit. I have in my time
said many harsh things of the English (and some of them
are perhaps still true), but that they know how to treat
misfortune without severity and how to behave as gentle-
men—I use the English word—to enemies who are harm-
less and in distress, this I shall always henceforth affirm to
the best of my ability in the face of those who in ignorance
presume to deny it. Like LUTHER, here I stand ; I cannot
otherwise. I am sure it will give pleasure to your Majesty
to hear that this is so, for you are the father of your people,
and it would grieve your paternal heart if it were proved
under wrong or cruelty. Of these there is not, and never
has been, the smallest trace. -
Yet even with all possible mitigations how wretched is
the fate of one who is a prisoner. He is in a foreign land,
and is commanded by those who are foreigners and speak
in a foreign tongue. He thinks of his own dear country
and of those he loves. It is true that he might be dead had
he not been taken, and that he would never have seen them
again, whereas now he is in no danger; but this cannot
console him. Somehow, indeed, it seems to him to be an
aggravation of his lot, for he has not even the freedom now
to offer his life. To add to the misfortunes and sufferings
of such a man by unnecessary harshness or cruelty would
be an inhuman wickedness, and it is impossible to conceive,
that any civilised nation could do this thing. To be sure;
it is stated in English newspapers which we are permitted
to read (I do not find the permission a very valuable one).
that English prisoners in Germany have been shamefully
dealt with. It is said that they have been hooted and spat:
upon, that they were herded together in cattle-trucks filled,
with filth, and that in their prisons they are scarcely
treated as human beings. Such charges I should look
upon as necessarily untrue, but I know that war corrupts:
human nature in some misérable men, and I appeal to .
Majesty, if there has anywhere been such conduct, to stamp
upon it and punish it. You are all-powerful, and you have:
but to say the word. It would be a terrible thing for us."
Germans if, when the War is over, our soldiers dare not look;
one another in the face with frank honour because some
scoundrels have wreaked their malice on unfortunate;
Englishmen, and have incurred no penalty for such a crime.
With inmost loyalty, voN EiseNSTAMM.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.
VII.
MY DEAR MR.PUNCH,-We have com-
pleted the dreaded Kitchener Test, and
found it not so very terrible after all.
In fact, strictly between ourselves, we
quite enjoyed it, though naturally in
our letters home we endeavour by subtle
suggestion to convey the impression
that we have had the very deuce of a
time.
Our first ordeal was to rise at 4 A.M.
and do a fifteen-mile route march, fol-
lowed by a spirited attack upon the
barracks. Roman Catholics were ex-
empt from this test. It was a Saint's
day, and they rose three
hours later than we, enjoyed
a leisurely breakfast and at- ||
tended church. You might
not believe me if I told you
the number of converts to
their religion from our bat-
talion since then.
In this attack we used no
ammunition, and the bursts
of firing which covered our
sectional rushes were repre-
sented by a vigorous working
of bolts and easing of springs.
Having proved that we could
perform this operation with-
out undue danger to ourselves
and the public, we were pro-
vided with blank cartridge
for the strenuous rearguard
action which we fought on
the following day. Again
there were no casualties be-
yond the collapse, under the
terse eloquence of our Colonel,
of one unfortunate, who
chanced to let off his rifle at us to MARRY THE sweep.”

to recover. - - -
Shortly afterwards we waged a des-
perate battle against a strong force of
cunningly entrenched cardboard heads
and shoulders and canvas screens, and
this time—so impressed were the au-
thorities by our previous successes—we
were permitted to use ball ammunition.
Incredible as it may seem, we again

was shockingly mangled.

It is a good thing the Test is over,
because the weather is getting in-
decently hot. But it is the growing
plague of flies and mosquitoes which
threatens to render life unendurable.
With regard to the last-named, I have
recently been told of an infallible
method of escaping their attentions at
night. All you have to do, states my
informant, is to leave a gap in the
mosquito curtain round your bed ten
minutes before retiring to rest. All
the mosquitoes in the room will eagerly
swarm through it. Then you merely

I feel sure it is an admirable plan,
but unhappily we have no mosquito

Though the perspiration we now
shed would seem to be the limit, we
have yet, it appears, to learn what
heat really is. The knowledge will
not long be withheld from two hundred
of us, who are under orders to leave
in about a fortnight for what we are
assured is the torridest and unhealthiest
hot-weather station in all India. Our

proficiency at the latter, you may

For myself, I shall pin my faith
to Zeem Soap, sold in the bazaars
here. A leaflet describing this mira-
culous preparation was thrust into my
hands a few days ago at the Nauchandi
Fair. Zeem Soap, I gather, is “not

AN ANGLO-BELGIAN VENUS.
“WE are going to have three,”
announced my cousin as I sat down
beside the tea-table.
Cynthia has a habit, which occasion-
ally makes her a little difficult to follow,
of picking up by a very small thread
some conversation of the week before
last. -
“Bravo!” I said, hoping for further
light. -
“You see, it was a question of bed-
rooms,” she continued.
“In all these cases,” I agreed, “it is
the bedrooms that really count—that
is, I should say, it is the bedrooms
that have to be counted.”
“Cynthia feels with me that what is
imperatively needed in this—ah –
somewhat remote district is a practical
example,” said my Uncle James from
the fireplace. -
Uncle James is generally to be found
near the fireplace. He is a man for
whom I have the greatest respect. A
rural dean in rather a large way, with
an apostolic manner faintly diluted at
times by a decorous bonhomie, he may
certainly be regarded as one of the
stouter pillars of our local society.
His remark, however, though embody-
ing a sound ethical principle, did not
seem to get us much farther forward.
“I shall have to rub up my French,”
said Cynthia.
At last I understood. “Pas du tout,”
I said politely.
“What 2'' asked Uncle James in a
slightly puzzled voice.
“Je ne voulais que dire,” I replied
with some difficulty, “que mademoiselle
votre fille parle déjà assez couramment
| la langue de nos Alliés.”
With the gravest dignity Uncle
James finished his cup of tea and took
out his watch.
“I must be going,” he said; “the
Archdeacon is expecting me at 5.30.”
“Poor Papa!” said Cynthia as the
door closed behind him; “I do hope
our Belgians will be able to speak
English.”
About a week later I received a note
from Cynthia asking me to come round
in the afternoon. I obeyed, and found
her looking distinctly worried.
“Oil sont vos amis 2 ” I asked.
“You needn't bother. Monsieur
speaks English quite well and trans-
lates everything to his wife and
daughter. Papa likes them immensely.
He has taken them out for a walk.”
“Capital Then you've all settled
down comfortably together ?”
“I thought so till this morning,”
said Cynthia with a sigh.
“Qu'est-ce que vous—I mean, what's
“It is Monsieur. You know Papa's
Venus, the statuette he bought last
year in Brussels?”
“Yes, I was with him at the time.”
“Monsieur noticed it yesterday in
the hall, and this morning he came to
me and said that he and his family
must leave us.”
“But I had no idea that the Latin
races x * -
“It isn't that. It appears that he
was the proprietor of the shop where
Papa bought it, and that he sold it to
him as a genuine antique, whereas in
reality it was made in Birmingham.”
“Ah!” I said sadly.
“Monsieur is overwhelmed with re-
morse and declares it is impossible
longer to accept the hospitality of one
whom he has betrayed. However, I
begged him to wait at any rate till to-
morrow before he said anything to
Papa about it. And then I sent for
you at once. So now what is to be
done?”,
I stared very hard at the carpet for
five minutes. “Cynthia,” I said at
length, “your father must be sacri-
ficed, but it shall be a painless opera-
tion—in fact, he will never realise
that it has taken place.”
“Are you sure ?” she asked doubt-
fully. ***
“Perfectly,” I said; “leave it to me.”
A little later Uncle James and his
guests returned, and we all took tea
together. Conversation with Madame
and Mademoiselle was carried on, as
Cynthia had said, through the medium
of Monsieur. I myself made no attempt
to reach them by the more direct route,
since my French, though perfect in its
way, is not of the sudden, unpre-
meditated type so much in vogue in
Continental circles. After tea I managed
to secure a few minutes alone with
Monsieur.
I decided to come straight to the
point. “Monsieur,” I said, “my
cousin has told me all.”
“Behold,” he replied, “an angel!
Mademoiselle would forgive. To her
it is a bagatelle. She-how say you ?
—she snaps at it the thumb. But for
me, Monsieur, I am desolated. The
business is the business; I know it.
But to have betrayed one's host, it is
other thing. It is impossible that I
rest here.”
“My dear Sir,” I said soothingly,
“do not distress yourself. I was with
my uncle when he bought the Venus.
He paid you with a 100-franc note.”
“It is true,” he admitted with an
ineffable gesture of despair.
“Did you pass it on 2 " I asked.
“But naturally.”
“You were indeed fortunate.”
“Monsieur,” I said, “on the morning
of our departure from your beautiful
city we discovered that one of your
countrymen had deceived us.” -
“The note " '' exclaimed Monsieur;
“it was then a bad 2 "
“Alas! yes. On the previous after-
noon I had gone to the races, un-

not permit himself such distractions.
On my return I was able to settle a
little debt that I owed him with a 100-
franc note. Next morning, when he
paid his hotel bill, he offered this to the
manager. The manager, who had once
been a Scotchman, rejected it. My
uncle was annoyed. He asked me to
take back the note and to give him
another in exchange. But I also had
just paid my bill—a larger one than I
ad looked for—and had little more
than my return ticket left. My uncle
thought deeply. Finally he said to me,
“This is an unfortunate business, but
it may well be that not all the inhabi-
tants are so fastidious as the unpleasant
manager of our hotel. Let us endeavour
to rid ourselves elsewhere of this pesti-
lent note. It will be but just, since
what is sauce for the goose is sauce
also for the gander.”
“I comprehend.

“You were the gander,” I said.

Would find no echo there.

THE SPORPOT.
I AM not sure if that is how they
spell it in Belgium, but that is how we
mean to spell it in Crashie Howe. We
have reason to be grateful to our
refugees for introducing this admirable
little implement. For the Sporpot has
come to stay.
The first I heard of it was from
Louis when he went to work in the
Minister's garden. He made good
wages there for a week or two, and
the thing was rather on his conscience.
He came to me to discuss the point.
Should this money be paid to go against
the cost of keeping his family, or should
he spend it? But before I could reply
a perfect compromise occurred to him.
He would put it in his Sporpot. It
seemed to me an excellent arrangement.
There is nothing new in principle
about the Sporpot. Most of us began
life with something of the sort in our
possession. But it always had a key,

pot with a key is no better than a ship
with a leak. It must be unrelenting,
imporous, adamant, without compro-
mise or saving clause or loophole or
back-door. It is the absolute cul-de-
sac. Once you have dropped in your
coin through the slit at the top it
should be as irrevocable as yesterday.
Of course the thing can be broken open,
but no one would care to have any
dealings with the sort of man who
would break open his Sporpot. Unless,
of course, he can prove it full.
As the proper emblem of a thrifty
people the Sporpot seems to be quite
domesticated in Belgium, as much a
member of the household as the dresser
important undertaking, after he settled
among us, and as soon as he had satis-
fied his more urgent needs—such as
catching chaffinches and making cages
for them and hanging them up outside
the door—was to establish a Sporpot.
And there could be no more fit com-
panion for the exile. It is a slender
thread that still holds him to Belgium,
far away. It keeps him looking for-
ward, for it is at least a beginning—all
he can do in these long months of
waiting. Like the little tag-end of
Belgian soil that is still defended by
the Allied Army, it is at least a
jumping-off place for the New Start.

WHY HENERY WENT.
Henery—for that was what every-
one called him—was the despair of
the village recruiters. Everyone tried
to induce him to enlist and everyone
failed ignominiously. The Vicar, who
had conceived the totally erroneous
idea that Henery had conscientious
objections to fighting, proved to him
that fighting in a cause like ours was
clearly justified by all laws human and
divine.
“Don't you go 'pologisin' to me
for goin', Sir," said Henery. “I'd
never think o' blamin' you, Sir. I
minds my own business.”
The postmistress, greatly daring,
presented him with a white feather.
“Thankee, Miss,” said Henery,
putting it in his hat, “but I tells you
if you goes chasin' Squire's ducks to
give young men presents you'll get
into trouble.”
The Squire himself told Henery that
every young man who could shoulder
a gun ought to be off. -
“It's none o' my business, Sir,"
“Is there a coward in this village?”
demanded the Squire.
“Your gamekeepers don't think so
if they swore true at petty sessions,”
replied Henery.
And certainly it was a fact that
Henery on one splendid occasion had
tackled three gamekeepers and thrashed
them horribly.
Not even the news that his step-
brother Albert had been taken prisoner
moved Henery.
“Why should I go botherin' about
'im bein’ in prison 'E never went
and fought no one when I was doin'
three weeks instead o' paying five
pound and costs.”
Even Mr. Bates of “The Bull" used
his potent influence in vain. “Look
'ere, Henery, just you see what these
Uns have been up to.”
“They never done nothing to me,”
persisted Henery.
But one morning the postman
handed Henery a postcard over the
garden hedge.
Henery read the postcard with diffi-
culty, put his spade in an outhouse,
feather in it and walked straight to the
railway station.
“Where are you goin', Henery?"
asked the station-master.
“Off to 'list. Look at that postcard."
The station-master read “Thanks
for fags. Why didn't you send some-
thing to eat? Hoping this finds you
well as it leaves me at present. Albert.”
“I sent 'im a pork-pie with them
fags,” said Henery. “’E was always
a wunner for pork-pie. Well, they
pinched it. Now I minds my business,
but folks as interferes with me gets
sorry. I'll make that KEESER sorry 'e
touched my pork-pie.”
And leaping into the train, and
waving the white-feathered hat in
farewell, Henery departed into the
unknown.
Branding a Butterfly.
“The butterflies of this month are very few,
apart from the second-hand hibernators from
last year. The green hairstreak is a surprise
without a rival. Who could see an apple-
green butterfly without marking it with a red
letter?”—Daily News.

AT THE FRONT.
THERE is a delusion current that this
war out here is stationary when it does
not move. It is true that there was
once a rumour that certain lines of
trenches came to understandings with
certain other lines, by which blue and
red flags were waved before the occu-
pants on either side fired off rifles, or
committed similar dangerous acts which
might otherwise have been interpreted
as unfriendly. In the meantime they
completed the tessellation of their pave-
ments and installed geysers and electric
light. Everyone has heard the rumour,
but no one you meet was actually there;
so the only conclusion we can come to
is that both sides dug and dug until
they got completely lost underground,
and were either incapable of return, or
so happy, comfortable and well found
that they stayed there, thus ingeniously
leaving the war without leaving their
posts, which is, after all, the ultimate
ideal of troglodytic patriotism.
However that may have been, the
war elsewhere is in a state of steady
evolution. You can never count on it.
You get into a beautiful quiet trench,
: | the sun shines and the birds sing, and
and ask the sister of your friend to
come out and have tea in the trench on
Friday. And then on Friday, just as
you're getting the tea-things out, and
sorting the tinned cucumbersandwiches,
and shifting the truffles out of the pâté,
the wind blows from the north, and the
rain rains, and the birds shut up, and
an 8-inch shell comes crump on the
primrose bed, and stray splinters carry
away the teapot and the provision
box and the cook; and on the whole
you're not sorry Leonore couldn't come
after all.
Not long ago it seemed good to the
€tat majeur that no officer should be in
possession of the means of supplying
the pictorial daily with pictorial war.
Every company in every regiment duly
rendered a certificate that it was with-
out cameras. Now there was a certain
regiment much given to photographic
studies. And when the day came that
the certificate should be signed and
rendered, the commander of A company
bethought him of his old-time friend-
ship with the commander of B com-
pany; and in token of his sincere esteem
sent to him as a gift the three cameras
which his officers had no further use for.
arrange garden parties, and write homel B company, though delighted at the
gift and the spirit in which it was
offered, had already four cameras in
possession of its officers. Moreover,
the time for B company to render its
certificate was at hand. And seeing
that there was much friendship sub-
sisting between B and C companies
the O.C. B company remembered that
the O.C. C company was a keen photo-
grapher, and one likely to welcome a
gift of seven cameras. Having de-
spatched them, he signed and certified
for B company. C company, whose
gratitude cannot easily be described,
was nevertheless in an obvious predica-
ment. So, when C company certified, D
company was in possession of thirteen
cameras; and finding that A company
had now no cameras at all rendered
unto it the very large stock with which
it was reluctantly obliged to part, and
unto the C.O. a certificate that D com-
pany was cameraless ; and the C.O.
certified in accordance with company
notifications.
That evening company commanders
dimed together, and latest advices advise
that the wicked regiment still spends its

ing shells, devastated churches and

AT THE PLAY.
“THE Kiss CURE.”
Those who imagined that the Liver-
pool Commonwealth Company were
to reproduce for us the grim and dour
actualities of a Lancashire interior in
the manner of the late Mr. STANLEY
Houghton and the Manchester School,
were doomed to be disappointed. Apart
from the Irish butler and the Scotch
cyclist, there is very little in The Kiss
Cure that might not have been just as
well conveyed to us by any London play-
wright and company who had studied
the manners of our Tooting minxes and
our Surbiton bloods. Still, since even
these types may have in them a touch
of novelty for certain sections of a
London audience, we had something
to learn. “Thus we came to know that
there are minxes by habit and experi-
ence and minxes of -
occasion; and the same
with bloods. There are
those who practise indis-
criminate kissing as a
test of the emotions,
and employ the art of
jealousy as part of the
daily routine of what T-
they call flirtation; while
others, not among the
mystics, allow themselves
to be temporarily initi-
ated into these rules for
single and serious ends,
and make a sad mess of
it. All this may be very
suburban, but when the
actors' hearts, as here,
are in it, you can, with
a little goodwill, be sufficiently amused.
And anyhow, after a course of stage
problems and intrigues, the whole thing
looks as innocent as the habit of ice-
cream and claret-cup.
The company played well together.
Miss WINwood was a practised minx,
though her artfulness did not extend to
her gestures, which suffered from angu-
larity. Mr. ARMSTRONG, as a Scotch-
man with a stutter, who knew the rules
of the game, and Mr. Cooper, as a

sketch was by Mr. SHINE as the Irish
butler. He said little, but you could

glad to believe that his opinion of the
society in which he found himself was
much the same as mine.

author, Mr. RoNALD JEANs, preceded The
Kiss Cure. It is slightly, but only very
slightly, loss innocent. The lady tests
her lover's devotion by alleging that
she is not married to the man she lives
with. Instead of feeling a passionate
freedom, the gentleman takes the view
that her virtue is damaged, and her
value, for him, depreciated. An egoistic
view, of course, but I don't blame him,

“THE RIGHT TO KILL.”
M. le Marquis de Sevigné, aged 46,
officer of cavalry and military attaché
to the French Embassy at Constanti-

us that he wanted to be a Quixote.
He had no trouble with his nose (like
Cyrano de Bergerac), or other physical
impediment — indeed he looked very
well in his French-grey tunic and ver-
milion breeches—but he had had no
opportunity of distinguishing himself

AT THE PLAY.
“THE KISS CURE.”
Those who imagined that the Liver-
pool Commonwealth Company were
to reproduce for us the grim and dour
actualities of a Lancashire interior in
the manner of the late Mr. STANLEY
Houghton and the Manchester School,
were doomed to be disappointed. Apart
from the Irish butler and the Scotch
cyclist, there is very little in The Kiss
Cure that might not have been just as
well conveyed to us by any London play-
wright and company who had studied
the manners of our Tooting minxes and
our Surbiton bloods. Still, since even
these types may have in them a touch
of novelty for certain sections of a
London audience, we had something
to learn. Thus we came to know that
there are minxes by habit and experi-
ence and minxes of
occasion; and the same
with bloods. There are
those who practise indis-
criminate kissing as a
test of the emotions,
and employ the art of
jealousy as part of the
daily routine of what I
they call flirtation; while
others, not among the
mystics, allow themselves
to be temporarily initi-
ated into these rules for
single and serious ends,
and make a sad mess of
it. All this may be very
suburban, but when the
actors' hearts, as here,
are in it, you can, with
a little goodwill, be sufficiently amused.
And anyhow, after a course of stage
problems and intrigues, the whole thing
looks as innocent as the habit of ice-
cream and claret-cup.
The company played well together.
Miss WINwood was a practised minx,
though her artfulness did not extend to
her gestures, which suffered from angu-
larity. Mr. ARMSTRONG, as a Scotch-
man with a stutter, who knew the rules
of the game, and Mr. CoopFR, as a
learner, made good fun. But the best
sketch was by Mr. SHINE as the Irish
butler. He said little, but you could
see him thinking a lot. And I am
glad to believe that his opinion of the

I liked him best in his less strenuous
moments. His modern uniform suited
him well, much better indeed than
those martial trappings of antiquity in
which he has often figured. In his
mufti, which showed no hint of Gallic
fantasy, his moustache made him rela-
would have been more effective if he
had done it in uniform. How he
escaped general observation while en-
tering, and debouching from, the lady's
window in full view of the Bosphorus,
which I understood to be packed, like

As Mehmed Pasha, Mr. ARTHUR
BourcHIER, disguised in an aquiline
nose and a pair of eyelids which he
kept lowered, like blinds, for the pur-
pose of inscrutability, had a part that
he could hardly help playing to uni-
versal admiration. Mr. HARcourt
WILLIAMs, as Prince Cernutritz, a
chevalier d'industrie of the first class,
might have contrived a more obvious
air of villainy, but the atmosphere of
diplomacy at the Sublime Porte would
naturally encourage secretiveness.
Mr. EDMUND MAURICE's art was
wasted on the unrelieved and clumsy
brutality of Falkland. Miss GRANVILLE
was excellent in the First Act, one of
those scenes—the usual dazzling recep-
tion—where you have to find out, from
momentary flashes of dialogue, who
everybody is and how they got there.
These scenes always make me dizzy,
but the intervention of Miss GRANville,
as a nice woman of the world, gave me
courage and confidence. -
The play, on its own merits, modest
but sound of their kind, goes well, and
should run; though its course might
have been lightened by a little more
humorous relief. Whether it does jus-
tice to the original novel on which it
is based is another matter. I do not
attempt to institute a comparison,
partly because the book is no business
of the critic's, but chiefly because I
haven't read it. O. S.

THE TRIPLE HANDICAP.
WHEN I was a kid of about thirteen
And rather slow for my years,
I knew a boy who in mind and mien
Outdistanced all of his peers;
His clothes were tidy, his hair was sleek,
For he brushed it morning and night;
He was equally good at Latin and Greek,
And his sums were always right.
His industry made him the masters' pet,
His neatness the matron's joy;
He never did anything wrong, and yet
He wasn't a popular boy;
For his name excited a vague mistrust
And his face our prejudice fanned,
And we all of us felt a deep disgust
Whenever we shook his hand.
His merits were mainly negative;
Tradition he never defied ;
And he certainly wasn't wont to give
Offence by swagger or side;
He made no claim to be bold or brave;
He didn't hustle or shove;
But he wasn't marked for an early
grave,
Like those whom the high gods love.
I saw him stand at my last Speech Day
Bowed down with many a prize,
And four full decades had rolled away
Ere next he fronted my eyes;
'Twas down at Shrimpington-on-Sea,
Where I was taking the air,
With my daughter upon my arm, and he
Was wheeling an old Bath chair.

has a palpable tenderness for her central figure, the Érice

the appeal of the story. Partly this is a tale of WASHING-

soldier fighting the French in
Canada, and later as the victorious
founder of the American Com-
monwealth. Partly, also, it con-
cerns the fortunes of ARNoLD, the

nothing more moving and dra-
matic than the scene in which

the traitor time to escape. There
is a real thrill in this. Through-

a romance in the inspired manner
of R. L. S.'s Prince Otto, or the
fashion of robustious Ruritania,
but just a gentle, easy-flowing,
quite wholesome, unpretentious
and strictly unlikely narrative to
while away the time.
In these days of complex
novelists I find Baroness ORCzY
very ingenuous and refreshing.
She is indeed so anxious to-im-
press me at the outset with
certain facts about the Hungarian
peasants that she repeats them
again and again, and this—if a
little uncomplimentary to my in-
telligence—does at any rate clear
the way for the tale she has to
tell in A Bride of the Plains
(HUTCHINson). What, however,
I do resent is that she should
address me as “stranger,” for the
truth of the matter is that she is
singularly charming man; while there must be many others,
to whom his identity as an anonymous journalist was un-
known, who will here recognize work in which they had
taken pleasure while ignorant of its authorship. Both Mr.
SIDNEY Low, who contributes a sympathetic memoir of his
friend, and Mr. W. P. KER, who has arranged and edited the
selections from his fugitive writings, have done their task
ably. The papers themselves were well worth collection into
this more permanent form. Chief among them is the series
grouped under the heading “Rulers of England” open letters
to prominent political personages over the signature “Friar
John.” These show Mr. JEYEsat his best; trenchant, entirely
fearless, more than a little Thackerayan in style. The
Memoir furnishes an interesting opportunity of tracing the
beginnings of this method in a fragment of an essay on
“Sisters,” written for an Uppingham journal when the author
was eighteen—a somewhat remarkable production. These
“Friar John ” letters, it should be added, are illustrated with
drawings of the addressees by Mr. HARRY FURNIss, which
the friendliest and most confiding of writers, and to be
called a stranger when one feels, as I did, like a member
of a family party, is nothing less than shattering. As to
the literary merits of this story of love, murder, wine and
dancing, I prefer to be silent, and shall hold my tongue
with the greater content because I doubt if admirers of
the beautiful Elsa will greatly trouble about the style in
which her tale is told. Sufficient it is that the Baroness

UNUSUAL BUSINESS IN THE COPSE.
SIR,--It would appear that some irregular occurrence is
disturbing the ordinary course of events, destroying habits
and annihilating old associations. But we get so little
news of the outside world in our rural retreat that I have
not yet learnt what is taking place.
For as many years as I can remember, on my return to
take up my residence in Littledown Copse each April, I
have found a pleasant-looking gentleman awaiting me
among the dead leaves in an attitude of expectancy, with
his hand to his ear. No matter how early in the month I
have come, or whether the day has been wet or fine, this
amiable and homely individual has been there, and at my
first call of greeting he has rubbed his hands together with
glee, looked at his watch and made notes in his pocket-
book. I understand that it has been his further custom
to confide to his friends, through the columns of the
principal London newspapers, that I have returned to my
Spring residence, dignifying what is after all a simple event
in a manner most gratifying to myself.
This year, to my great disappointment, my friend was
not awaiting me at Littledown Copse, and in reply to m
calls there was not so much as a rustle of the leaves. }
looked for him in vain until May 1st, when he arrived in
the company of another. His companion was an ordinary
person who had little of the appearance of a nature-lover,
and my friend himself had altered; his beard was trimmed,
and he looked almost muscular. Both were attired strangely
in grey-green clothing, with a band of bright red on the
left arm stamped with the initials “G. R.” which, with its
colour, gave it the appearance of a letter-box. I was glad
to see my old friend, and gave a cry of welcome.
“Hark! the cuckoo!” said his companion.
“Keep down, you fool," said my old friend crossly;
“that's no cuckoo. I bet you a shilling it's one of their
scouts giving warning that we've been heard among
these confounded rustling leaves.”
As they fell on their faces behind some bushes I saw
to my alarm that each of them was armed with a rifle.
I deemed it advisable therefore to hold my peace. But I
cannot shake off the conviction that there are strange

MY DEAR CHARLEs, It is now 2 A.M.,
an hour which I hope never to meet
again when this business is ended; the
rifles have quieted down, and both
sides have abandoned, temporarily, the
bellicose for the comatose attitude.
I have just been leaning over the
parapet contemplating in the moonlight
that turnip field which separates us
from our learned friends opposite, and
is, in solid fact, an integral part of that
thick black line of your newspaper
maps, always so important-looking but
so “approximate only.” If turnip fields
were capable of emotion this one would
be filled with pride at the moment.
For generations it has been unnoticed
and insignificant; its own tenant farmer
may have been aware of its existence,
but no one else probably knew or
cared anything about it. And now
there are some thousands of us whose
whole attention, anxiety, enthusiasms,
hopes and fears are concentrated on
nothing else. It is sacred ground,
on no account to be trodden on and
hardly to be looked at by day, and even
in the dead of night only to be crept
respect. We have sat on our respectivelis happening behind those black-and-
edges of it for weeks, never taking our
periscopes off it and reporting, as a
matter of suspicion, the growth of
every plant in it; and at the broken
down old cart which stands in the
middle of it we have shot a hundred
times (and so, no doubt, have they) as at
a bold but crafty assailant. Yesterday
afternoon the field resumed, for a
minute, some of its natural use. It
was the after-lunch siesta; things were
as peaceful as things can be in war;
the sun shone and no sounds were
heard except the casting of tinned-meat
tins over the parapet—a form of untidi-
ness, Charles, which Headquarter Staffs
may rail against but are unable to check
personally. Suddenly the air was rent
by the splutter of “three rounds rapid"
from the English trench on our left.
From my dug-out I heard, with grave
anxiety, the firing being taken up by
our own company; I was out and at
the parapet just in time to see the
solitary hare fall to the rifles of the
company on our right. . . . The man
who has just slipped over into the
forbidden area and recovered the corpse,
is, I take it, some retriever.
Our predominant feeling is one of
white sandbags over the way. Are the
Germans at this moment paraded there,
being harangued by their officers before

unmistakably yawning? Does the
spiral of blue smoke ascending to heaven
indicate a deadly gas manufacture or
the warming up of a meat and veget-
able ration ? Are there ten thousand
Germans there or ten ? Are there,
we ask ourselves testily after the long
periods of inactivity which sometimes
occur, are there any Germans there at

to his sweetheart : “There 's millions
of Germans here but they's all behind
bags.” On the other hand, Lieut.
Tolley, whose dashing spirits demand
an attack, contends that the whole line
opposing us has been deserted by the
soldiery and is now held by a caretaker
and his wife, the caretaker doing the
occasional shooting, while his wife
sends up the flare lights.
I write spasmodically between my
rounds; I have just been questioning
a sentry as to the formalities of his job.
For instance, it is of the first importance
that he should say, on the approach of

into trouble for something or other, but.
that remark, genially uttered, will help.
I ask my sentry what he has to do.
“Look out,” he answers. “But suppose
anybody comes?” I continue. “Look
out,” he says. “But,” I press him,
“if the Brigadier himself comes in to
your bay and stands by you without
saying anything, what will you do
then 2" “Look out,” he repeated with
feeling.

urgency. “Suppose you see the enemy

numbers, what will you do?” “Shoot,”
name and he bursts into the mess hut
like a whirlwind, dropping knives and
forks, tripping over chairs, sweepin
crockery off the table, in his uncon-
trolled enthusiasm. To enable himself
to get through more work he leaves
the table with just twice what any
man could carry, and drops it all before
he gets to the door. This dropping has
become a fixed habit with him ; he
drops everything, however heavy or
light, fragile or valuable, but through
accidents and abuse he maintains his
cheery deportment of impulse and
impetus. -
A week ago we were all of us sitting
UNDESIRABLE POSES.
[Several of our photographic newspapers
recently had a picture of the CHANCELLOR of
THE ExchEQUER resting on the heather at
Walton Heath after a round of golf. A medi-
cal correspondent wrote to The Daily Mail
criticising the CHANCELLOR's rashness. “He
was risking an attack of lumbago, rheumatism,
loss of voice, or even some much more serious
consequence of sudden chilling of the heated
body. To lie on the grass at this time of year
in the case of a man over forty is a very risky
proceeding."]
WE feel that it is time that expert
criticism was directed towards other
pictures in our illustrated newspapers,
and we print one or two comments we
says he. I explain that two
hundred rifles are perhaps
more useful than one and ask
him how he will give the
alarm. The correct call is
“Stand to arms " " His, how-
ever, was nearly as good. “I
should shout, ‘They’m coom-
in'!'” said he.
They are now starting this
artillery business at night,
which is really rather tiresome
of them. You may imagine
how, in an artillery duel, one
lot of guns, not knowing where
the other lot is, gets tired of
looking. But there is always
the day's ration of shells to be
got through. I have no doubt
it is the same with the
Germans as with ourselves;
what with certificates, reports
and returns, it is much less
tiring to shoot away all the
darned stuff than to keep any
by you unexpended. And so
the gunners look, after a while,
for their customary target, its
whereabouts fixed and known.

structions issued to our own
corps of specialists.

“No wonder the recent
poems of Mr. Alvasour Anna-
lane have shown a falling off.
The reason is to be seen in a
|portrait of this gentleman

Snatch. He is posed with his
hand against his face, his
forefinger pressing against his
temple. Pressure in this place
cannot fail to interfere with
the proper operation of an

gunners' point of view that target is
Us, and so over come the shells with a
slittering, genial whistle, as if to say,
“Do just come out of your hole and
watch the burst.” We have lost fifteen
new-laid eggs, a dozen mineral water
and a farmhouse clock in yesterday's
encounter; and, after it was all over,
no doubt those infernal gunners of ours,
who had started the row, retired to
their dug-outs away back behind the
line, and had an omelette lunch.
The topic reminds me of our indus-
trious but incompetent mess waiter,
Private Blackwell. If ever a man in
this world meant well but missed it he
round the mess table at midnight,
having just returned from a period in
the trenches—a moment when we
suffer a little from the want of sleep and
the reaction after the nervous tension.
Suddenly the door flung wildly open,
and in burst the ecstatic Blackwell,
carrying (“Heaven defend us!” shouted
the Adjutant) an enormous shell. “But,
of course,” we reassured each other, “it
is only the empty case.” “No, Sir,”
declared the bearer, hustling over all
obstacles to the C.O. at the far end of
the room, “it fell by Trench Head-
quarters just before we left, and hasn't
burst yet." Never in my life shall I
forget the sensation caused by that

SINCE it is notorious that no one at

stage—what plays and revues are on
and what plays and revues are coming
on—it follows that the conversation
over this meal is always alluring and

it is racing.

When I met Mr. Gully Buttran
yesterday he was full of his plans for
beating the Umpire and the Hoppo-
drome and the Palaceum at their own
game. The public, he said, cannot
have too many revues; and his project
was to have three every night—one at
eight, one at nine and one at ten. The
first was to be called Who said Rats 2
The second, Wait till the Train stops;
and the third, This Way Out. The
costumes, he said, were to be most
carefully arranged to come just within
the safety revue limit laid down by the
Lord Chamberlain's Office. “But how
do you know what that is 2 " I asked.
CHAMBERLAIN always threatens three or
four times before he strikes, and that
gives us our chance.”

Passing on to the next theatrical
magnate, Mr. Batten Wing, I found
that he, too, was meditating a revue.
Between his cups of souchong he told
me that it seemed to him that what
the country most needed at the present
moment was a strong lead from the
male choruses. “The oftener,” he said,
“that recruiting songs can be sung by
active and vigorous young men on the
stage the better must the results be.”
But when I asked him to specify the
results he begged to be excused. “The
stage,” he added, “has a sacred duty
to perform, and it is rising to the
occasion. Nothing could be finer than
our male chorus singing in unison that
splendid song, You're wanted at the
Front.”

to me by my manager that men home
leave, wanted to see me, I gave way at
once, although my price is really five
hundred guineas. I think that there
is no sacrifice too great to be made

coming out as a stage performer–
might prove the very nerve tonic she
needed. She's always had a wonderful
talent for turning cart-wheels — no
acrobat could do it much better—and
has been constantly asked, at private
and semi-private parties, to show her
skill. (It was at a party at Dunstable
House, years ago, after she'd surpassed
herself in turning cart-wheels, that
Middleshire asked her to dire le grand
out.) Well, and so, when it got known
that her state of nervous tension dur-
ing her husband's hours of duty made
it necessary she should take a stage
engagement, she'd plenty of offers
from managers. She accepted the best
one, and “The Duchess of Middleshire
will Turn Cart-Wheels” was put in as
an extra attraction in the Pantechnicon
went to see her the first night, and,
after she'd cart-wheeled right across
the stage and back again we fairly
rose at her, and in a minute she was
up to her knees in flowers. Her en-
gagement at the Pantechnicon is over
now, but the state of her nerves, though
improved, yet made quietness danger-
ous, so she's going the round of the
suburban halls; and, if she's not all
right after that, Sir William Kiddem
says he gives her permission to tour
the provinces.
How differently troubles affect people
of different birth, my Daphnel A
woman of long descent like Lala (she
was a Montilol, you know, and they
boast the blood of Plantagenet, and
have an old, hereditary right to stand
in the presence of the Sovereign with
their arms akimbo) has such a high-
strung organisation and such a delicate
poise that any worry and anxiety make
it imperative she should be got out of
herself. On the other hand, Lady
Exborough, who was a Miss Nobody of
Nowhere, and whose husband is at the
Front, shuts herself up and is never
seen at restaurant dinners or suppers
or at the theatre or anywhere. One
would think quietness and seclusion
would be insupportable to her in the
circumstances, but ces autres have blunt
feelings, I believe.
Apart from the great subject, perhaps
the most burning question at present
is, How long ought the war-wisp to be 2
(The war-wisp, dearest, is the lock of
hair now worn in front of each ear.)
Myself I hold that it should steal gently
down past the ear, just trespass unob-
trusively on the cheek, and then stop.
With these war-wisps it's correct to
wear a faraway look, faintly touched
with anxiety. The idea is that one's
thinking of somebody in Flanders, or the
Dardanelles, or the North Sea. Some
people, however, overdo everything,
For instance, Peggy Preston's war-
wisps reach nearly to the corners of her
mouth, and, though she's no personal
worry about the war, she overdoes the
faraway frown to such extent that
the other night, when she came into
“Gorgonzola’s” with a party for sup-
per, I heard a man at a table say to
his friend, “My hat! Here's a woman
going mad while you wait!” I thought
it only kind to tell her, later, what I'd
heard.
Dear Professor Dimsdale is working
day and night at some marvellous ex-
periments that may end the war quite
suddenly and prevent all future wars.
Isn't thatlovely? Of course everything's
being kept very secret, but I may tell
you this, he's discovered a drug of
tremendous strength (not cruel or pain-
thing !). It's a narcotic of undreamt-
of power, and the idea is for aeroplanes
to fly over the enemy's army and drop
this down in a liquid form (it only acts
when dropped from above, so the airmen
would be safe). It takes effect on
those below while it's still a long way
up in the air, and half a pint of it,
scattered in drops, is enough to put a
whole army corps into a deep sleep.
So there it is, Daphne ! When the
enemy's whole army is in profound
slumber, it will only remain for us to
find their Commander-in-Chief, wake
him, and dictate terms of peace | The
waking will be done with an anti-
dote the Professor's now at work on.
The laboratory is guarded day and
night, and the dear Professor himself
wears a bullet-and-dagger-proof waist-
coat and his soft felt hat has been
fitted with a steel lining.
A story is being whispered about an
escapade of Beryl Clarges'. She was
week-ending with some people at a
Place on the Coast. Off this Place on
the Coast was lying a certain British
Warship, which one afternoon gave a
thé dansant to which Beryl and the
others went. You know what she is—
nothing would satisfy her but to be
shown just what they do when going
into action. She insisted on knowing
how the guns were trained and loaded
and all that; teased and coaxed them to
show her exactly what was done when
a broadside was to be fired, and kept
on urging them to show her a little
more—and a little more—till at last
things went too far—and a real broad-
side was fired All the windows of a
Place on the Coast were broken; all the
natives thought their last hour had
struck; the little pier and parade be-
came only a memory, and Beryl clapped
her hands and yelled for joy! And
now Somebody's been severely repri-
manded and has lost five years' seni-
ority, while the real culprit goes on her
way rejoicing. Certainly, there 's this
to be said—it would be no punishment
to poor, dear Beryl to lose five years'
seniority

All battalions were recently warned
to keep a careful watch for any con-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted From the DIARY or Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, 10th of
May.—The civilised world ablaze with
horror and anger at latest example of
German Kultur. Reasonable to sup-
pose House of Commons, epitome and
representative of British nation, would
reassemble to-day in state of turbulent
indignation. House of Commons
is an odd place, unique in its
characteristics. Looking round
the benches, noting tone and pur-
port of inquiries addressed to
FIRST Lord of ADMIRALTY, one
might well suppose that nothing
particular had happened since it
adjourned last Thursday. Ques-
tions numerous; all of practical
character. Unemotional as if
they referred to outrages by
newly-discovered tribe of fiends
in human shape peopling Mars
or Saturn. FIRST Lord, equally
undemonstrative, announced that
Board of Trade have ordered
inquiry into circumstances attend-
ing loss of Lusitania. Pending
result, it would be premature to
discuss the matter.
This way of looking at it struck
some listeners as the sublimation
of officialism and national phlegm.
Here is a British passenger ship home-
ward bound across Atlantic. Within
sight of land she is feloniously struck
without warning by a torpedo launched
by a German submarine. Out of a
total of 1,906 souls, passengers and
crew, 772 survive.
These are bare facts beyond dis-
pute. But, as FIRST Lord says, we
must have enquiry into the matter.
It will take days to complete, may-
be weeks. Meanwhile we must say
nothing about it.
Continued absence of

there is grief for the untimely cutting
off of one of the Liberal Whips.
WILLIAM Jon Es was much too good for
human nature's daily food as it is earned
in the Whips' Room of House of Com-
mons. A scholar, a poet, an orator of
rare loftiness of tone and beauty of
style, he was among the most modest,
the least self - seeking of men. One
can imagine how embarrassed he must
have been when he woke up one
morning to find himself a Junior Lord
of the Treasury with a salary of £1,200
a year and appointed to the work of
a Whip.
No one envied him his good fortune.
On the contrary it was universally
applauded. Still, under chorus of ap-
proval there was note of regret that
the trammels of subordinate office
would rob the House of one of its
chiefest ornaments in debate.
WILLIAM Jones rarely addressed the
House. Whenever he did he com-
manded its instant and held its en-
tranced attention. Among his chief
admirers was Prince ARTHUR, himself
an expert in the art of speech. Gifted
with a beautiful voice, attuned to the
contributions to Parliamentary debate
were things apart. Equally successful
on the platform, he swayed mixed
multitudes in fashion that surprised
and to some extent alarmed him.
A self-made man, he found his way
to the front without pushing. Perhaps

Oxford than his Parliamentary honours.

THE PERFECT LETTER-WRITER.
SoMETIMEs it happens that illiteracy
can get there as quickly and surely
as the highest culture, though by a
different route, as in the following
instance.
Once upon a time there was a Little
Tailor in a little shop in Soho. Not a
tailor in the ordinary sense of the word,
but a ladies' tailor. He was never seen
out of shirt sleeves which might have
been whiter, and he came from one of
the foreign lands where the youths
seem to be under conscription for this
trade. What land it was I cannot say
for certain, but I should guess one of
the Polands—German probably, but
called Russian by him.
Once upon a time—in fact, at the
same time—there was also a lady con-
nected with the stage, and as her theatre
was contiguous to the Little Tailor's
place of business, it was only natural
that when one of her gowns was sud-
denly torn her dresser should hasten
to him to have it put right. But the
charge was so disproportionate to the
slight work done that the dresser de-
ferred payment, and deferred it so long
that the Little Tailor had to lay down
the shears and take the pen in their
place. And this is what he wrote:—
exactly to quarrel with somebody. But
it is the first time in my life happens
to me a thing like that. And therefore
I am not going to let it go. I was just
keeping quiet to see what you would
do. But what I can see you think I
have forgotten about it. But I may
tell you this much. It is not the few
shillings but it is the impudence to
come in while I am away to ask the
girl to do it as a special, and then to
come in and take it away, and then tell
the girl you would come in to-morrow
to see me. And this is six weeks
already and you have not come yet.
The only thing I can say now, Miss, if
you will kindly send the money by
return, because I tell you candidly. I
will not be had by you in this manner.
Should you not send the money I shall
try to get to know you personally, and
will have something to say about it.”
If the art of letter-writing is to state
clearly one's own position, that is as
good a letter as any written. Every
word expresses not only the intention of
the writer but his state of mind. Not
even—shall we say?—Mr. LANDFEAR

the ground beside him and a small
piece which he kept rolling between
his finger and thumb to make it look
darker. Jimmy's bloodhound Faithful
ate the big lump of dough and then sat
down to enjoy the fishing. Faithful
loves anything with a relish to it,
Jimmy says, and it made him smack
his lips.
Faithful liked watching the float
bob, and every time it bobbed Faithful
bobbed. Jimmy says it is like when you
watch a boy kick a goal at Rugby foot-
ball and you lift your leg out of sym-
pathy and kick the boy standing in
front of you, except that you have to
fight the boy afterwards to show it was
an accident. -
Jimmy says Faithful was very anxious
but there was too much water in the
canal, and Faithful hadn't room for it
all. Jimmy says the aniseed kept egg-
ing Faithful on to drink up the canal
till he got a hiccough over it. -
Jimmy says the man had never heard
a bloodhound hiccough so much and he
was surprised. . . -: ,
When the man had used up the last
bit of the dark dough he looked every-
where for the rest of it. Jimmy says
Faithful never said a word, he just
went on hiccoughing quietly to him-
self. Jimmy says the man must have
had his suspicions, because he sent
Faithful spinning through the air right
into the middle of the canal. Before
he went away he told another man
about it; he said the roach were just
beginning to bite real lusty as you
might say. The other man stopped to
admire Faithful's breast stroke. He
showed Jimmy how to train Faithful
to fetch things out of the water.
Jimmy says you do it by throwing your
walking stick into the middle of the
canal and saying “Good dog” quickly.
Jimmy says it was a nice walking
stick, much better than the ordinary
ones because it was made of ebony and
sank.
Faithful liked to see the man get into
the water after his stick. Jimmy says
Faithful got very excited when the man
dived under the water, and he tried to
to get to the float to see how it did it,
all hairy where Faithful had guarded
it; he sang Faithful a little hymn of
says the man laughed when he came to
the surface and saw Faithful in the
water; he said “What has he got in
his mouth 2"–just like that, you know.
The man swam after Faithful and pulled
it out of his mouth. He said it was—
bless me, a dirty old shirt, and threw it
away from him, because he said you
never knew what tramp had been wear-
ing it, and he might have had fever or
what not.
The man showed Jimmy how to do
the trudgeon stroke. Faithful liked
to see the man do this stroke; he was
lying on the man's vest, guarding it till
he came back. Bloodhounds are very
good at that, Jimmy says.
Whilst the man was doing the trud-
geon stroke Jimmy noticed he had
something tattooed on his arm. You
see Jimmy knows all about tattooing;
you do it with a pen nib and copying
ink pencil, and if the other boy goes
too deep you wait till you do it on him,
and then you can't do it for laughing.
You'd never guess what it was on the
man's arm. Jimmy saw it when the
man was drying himself with his pocket
handkerchief—it was an eagle Jimmy
says, and then he knew that his blood-
hound Faithful had been tracking an-
other spy down all the time. Jimmy
says the man noticed that his vest was
hate about it as he was putting it on.
He said so much about it that Jimmy
crawled through to the other side of
the hedge ready for the time when he
missed his shirt. Jimmy says he could
hear the man wondering where his shirt
was as he was crawling through.
Jimmy says when the man remembered
where he'd seen it last he wanted to
catch Faithful and hold his head under
the water for a very long time, but
Faithful thought he was playing cross-
tick with him, and wouldn't let the
man catch him. Jimmy says Faithful
is a good cross-ticker. .
When the man got his shirt again
Jimmy saw that Faithful's toe-nails
wanted cutting, as you could see where
they had caught in the shirt when he
was swimming with it.
Jimmy says the man dressed very
quickly, and said he was going home to
catch his death of cold. He promised
to meet Faithful again. Jimmy found
out where the man lived, and told a
policeman about the German eagle.
Jimmy says the policeman soon found
the man; he did it by going up to the
man's house and knocking at the door.
He said the man was very rude to
him, very, very rude, the policeman said;
you wouldn't believe it unless you were
in the force, he said.
asked the man to take off his shirt the
man invited him to come into the back
yard where they would have more room.
Jimmy says the policeman told him
he took down three pages of evidence
which might have been used against
the man, but it was all wasted because
it wasn't a German eagle after all; it
was a love bird, and they are different.
Jimmy says the very best blood- |
hounds make mistakes sometimes, and
it must have been the aniseed in the
dough that put him off the scent.

SoNNY, it seems like twenty year,
The while that you've been gone,
And left me lonesome for you here
Trying to do my bit—eh, dear!—
By keeping steady on. -
I promised and I’ve meant to do,
But now and then at night
I've been to blame, the times it blew :
Like guns that answered guns, with |
you—
My you—amongst the fight.
But in the morning “Dear old fool”
I've seemed to hear you say:
“Mother, no need to fuss, keep cool,”
Just like the cheeky brat from school
You was the other day.
You wasn't always quite so grand;
. Once you was mighty glad,
Chased by a puppy-dog, to stand
Behind your Mummy, slip your hand
In hers, the way you had.
Small son turned big, now that you're
grown
And in a real war,
And set to face it all alone,
I'm wild to run and guard my own
Same as I did before.
You'd laugh at that ; but keep your
fun
Till fighting's through, and then
Hurry off back to where there's one
All of a fuss to hear her son.
Say “Dear old fool” again.

UNwRITTEN LETTERs To THE KAISER.
No. XXII. - *
(From the President of the UNITED STATEs of AMERICA.)
SIR,-The Imperial German Government will shortly
receive through the usual channels a document in which
are expressed the sentiments of the Government of the
United States with regard to the grave questions involved
in the sinking of unarmed merchant vessels by German
submarines, and particularly with regard to the sinking
of the Lusitania and the consequent death of many
American citizens. These sentiments are necessarily
expressed in diplomatic form, though I trust you will
not mistake their restraint for weakness or imagine
that because the terms are courteous there is any lack of
determination on the part of this Government to obtain not
merely reparation, but an assurance that such outrages
shall not be repeated. Still there may be such a danger,
and I am therefore impelled to write this private letter
which I beg you will read into the gentler language of the
Secretary of State. In that way, perhaps, all future mis-
understandings between your Government and that of the
United States will be avoided, and to secure this object I
shall use all the frankness which the occasion demands.
Let me tell you, first, that I cannot find, words in
which to state adequately the feelings of horror, indigna-
tion and loathing which have been aroused in the minds
and inhuman outrage of which the Lusitania with her
given. Death appeared suddenly at your orders, and more
than a thousand innocent men, women and children were
hurried to their doom. Their only fault was that they
doing they offended, forsooth, against your claim to omni-
| potence and terror. You had determined to shut the gates
of mercy on mankind, unless mankind was willing to tremble
before your sword and to do obeisance before your jack-boots.
| Mankind, I can assure you, will not admit that claim and
| American mankind as little as any other. They will recoil
from you in scorn and detestation, seeing in you not the
honourable warrior whose chivalry, while not impairing his
strength, adds lustre to his deeds, but rather the skulking
assassin who deals a felon's blow in the dark and gloats
in his hiding place over the innocent blood he has shed.
Hundreds of years hence this dreadful murder will still
stain the escutcheon of Germany. Nothing will ever efface
it or mitigate its shame, and the world, whatever may be the
result of this terrible conflict, will continue to wonder how
men can have planned and executed such an atrocity. On
you and on no other rests the ultimate responsibility for
the crime, and you will be known to distant ages as the
Lusitanian Emperor.
Already I perceive that your German newspapers are
singing their inspired and accustomed strain. They have
been told to weep a tear or two, and, lo, in a moment they
are all turned into crocodiles. They weep perfunctorily
over the loss of life, but they point out, as their master
commands them, that the fault is with those who are dead
and with England who lured them to their fate and who
still presumes to affront Germany by fighting against her
on land and sea. CAESAR Borgia was a frequent and a
merciless assassin in his time, but I do not think he used
hypocrisy of this stamp to gloss over his crimes. Nor was
he known in private life as one who made broad his
phylacteries and claimed for himself and his crew of
bravoes the special favour of Almighty God.

disgust and horror, I do not envy you your dreams.

BEFore the War I had tried and tried again, and each
time I had failed. Diana is so disarming. Several times
I had ventured on the preliminary cough, followed by
a husky “Diana, I—” -
But Diana is very clever. Her invariable reply was,
“What a nice boy young So-and-so is,” young So-and-so
being a different boy each time. -
Then at the beginning of August last there came a
time when for three whole days, I never once thought
of Diana. I was more concerned with the measurement
of my chest, the soundness of my heart and the difficulty of
purchasing a sword. - -- * -
With the assumption of my uniform I wakened to the

My first day's leave saw me in her drawing-room. “Dick,"
she said, “I often wonder how you manage on parade.”
I stiffened. “How do you mean?”
“Well, you've such a gentle voice.” -
I walked to the fireplace, picked up the tongs and
handed them to Diana. . . . - -
“Fall in, please,” I said, “and we'll show you.”
Diana fell in. I cleared my throat threateningly and
began— -

“Oh, good!" she exclaimed. , -
“SILENCE IN THE RANKs!", - .
I cleared my throat again. Then an idea came to me.
Diana, I knew, would not talk again; she is like that.
“STAND–A—TEASE,” I bellowed. “DiaNA—”
It never came. -
“I—"I began; and then I realised it was unsporting
to take advantage of her enforced silence. - “I—I—EYES
—Right,” I finished brilliantly. -
“Dick, you dear,” said Diana, and I felt pleased with
myself. - - - - - * * * -
The pleased feeling had worn off a long time when
some months later we were moved to Aldershot. I
wondered hopelessly if Diana would change at the last
minute. We expected of course to proceed frontwards from
Aldershot, and this Diana knew ; so I was just a little
more confident when the time came. But I got no further
than the preliminary cough, for at that moment Diana's
father entered, shook me warmly by the hand and presented
me with some milk tabloids.

A trench is an uncomfortable place to write in, and
there are distractions. I had got as far as a P.S. begin-

companion, finding the addressed envelope and the unfinished

The reply came by wire to the hospital—“So do I, dear.

I abandoned the idea of confirming my communication
with a complete proposal, and wired back something

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It may not seem very probable that a world-renowned
inventor should be so seized with hatred for the restraints
of ordinary existence that he should suddenly leap from a
motor car, somewhere in the New Forest, without even
asking the driver to stop ; but, granted that he did so, it
becomes entirely natural that he should thereupon crack
his crown, be picked up by gipsies camping near and
(granted further that it is the way of gipsy girls to be as
sweetly attractive as Mary James) should proceed to fall
in love with one of them during the period of recovery.
That even Miss E. S. STEvens finds it a little difficult to
account for the behaviour of the hero of Allward (MILLs
AND Boon) is proved by the fact that she feels under an
obligation to sketch in an elaborately unhappy past for the
purpose of explaining him; but really it does not matter
a bit; for so likeable is the world into which he projects
himself—and us—that honestly we would rather not be
bothered with too many reasons for our introduction there.
It is a world that is alive with the spirit which the forest
lover feels stirring in the sway of the bushes, the patter of
raindrops and the shimmer of blue distances, and Mary is
the visible incarnation of that spirit. Her lover calls her
his little “shushy,” recognising a sort of kinship between
her and the earth-grubby, earth-happy rabbit. When you
have read this charming story, simpler and stronger than
any the author has given us before, I think you will agree
that those of Lyddon's friends who lived in houses and
off the romance, and you will add your blessing when the
nomad and his gipsy bride wander northward, southward,
eastward, westward—in fact, Allward.
Chapman's Wares (MILLS AND Boon) is the agreeable
title that Mr. H. B. MARRIoTT WATson has given to a
collection of short stories. The wares comprise one rather
lengthy and dullish tale called “Elaine" and a number of
others which, if they might justly be called pot-boilers,
contrive a pleasant sparkle in the process. I do not think
you will care over much for “Elaine,” which is about a
man who brought a wife home from India, and found (or
would have found had he been less obtuse) that his sister's
betrothed was the only man that the lady bad ever loved.
So of course there were ructions. People were introduced,
and after a sufficient pause said “How do you do?” quite
naturally, as they do just before the curtain drops on the
first Act of a problem play. Indeed I would take a modest
bet with any lady or gentleman that Mr. WATson has at
one time or other considered a dramatic medium for his
story. If so, I am glad he thought better of it. The other
tales, as I say, are better company. There is one, “The
Wayside Inn,” as improbable and genuinely thrilling as
you need wish. I fancy, though I may be wrong, that I
recall meeting it in a Christmas Number; indeed many of
the stories will bring you memories of those mid-autumn
shillingsworths. The best of the bunch, I think, because
its probability, though subjected to a severe strain, never
quite reaches snapping-point, is “The Room at the Dol-
phin.” What happens therein you might find out on your

I see that one of Mr. JEFFERY FARNOL's tales is adver-
tised by his publishers as the sweetest story ever told; no
doubt, however, this criticism was penned before they had
read his latest, The Chronicles of the Imp (SAMPsoN Low),
which must otherwise have made a bold bid for the super-
lative. Whether sweetest stories appeal to you or not is of
course a matter of constitution. For myself I can only
regretfully confess to a habit somewhat too gouty for their
assimilation. The fact is that Mr. FARNoL's world affects
me as adulation did the Duke in Patience. Here, in the
present book, you shall find it in full luxuriance. It is a
world where it is always afternoon, and mostly midsummer;
where never wind blows loudly; where attractive heroines

South, is dedicated by JAMEs LANE ALLEN to “the Soldier-
youth of England." Joseph Summer goes to the war to
follow a father and four brothers, all dead on those terrible
fratricidal fields. He takes the call of duty in a great-hearted
way; faces staunchly the ordeal of parting from his beloved
and from the mother who refuses her consent and blessing
to his enterprise, and sends him forth with bitter words.
Then, coming near death in loneliness, she sends for him to
ask his forgiveness. And on the eve of battle, tragically
conscious of the shame of his desertion, he leaves his
comrades only to arrive too late, makes his way back again
to the army, and has his pardon from LEE himself on that
fateful evening before the Appomattox surrender. It is
Mr. ALLEN's method to take but a few incidents, to
those that hang in pairs upon the walls ſ
of lodging-houses; where, above all,
infant phenomena are constructed with
engaging lisps and a passion for un-
conscious match-making that inevitably
lands the heroine in the hero's arms at
the last chapter. I find that without
intending it I have told you all about
The Chronicles of the Imp. I do not
know that we need go much further
into detail. Lisbeth was the heroine
and Uncle Dick was the hero, and
almost the last illustration (very plea-
sant these illustrations) depicts the
heroine reassuring the hero, who with
incredible simplicity had imagined that
she was going to marry somebody else.
As if there had been the remotest
chance of such an ending ! Well, well,
Mr. FARNoL counts his public by the tens
of thousands. He has even achieved the
high guerdon of “an appreciation of
the author and his work by CLEMENT
K. Shorter,” printed here as a preface,
and read by me with the sympathetic
interest that a tale of hardships over-
come must always command. It made
me glad that a book which I personally

undue insistence upon the gallant spirit of the man who
refused to accept blindness as a fatal impediment to
his life's work, she leaves us with a picture of a very
real hero. Uncompromising honesty of purpose, intense
sympathy with the afflicted and oppressed, and a never-

not only the love of his personal friends, but also the
respect and admiration of those political opponents to

The KAISER, it is said, has decided to
strike off all British princes from the
roll of the Order of the Black Eagle.
Now that this bird has proved to be as
black as he is painted this seems to be
an act of common justice.
We are sorry to see that it has been
suggested that the German eagle on
Banbury Cross, placed there in 1885 to
commemorate the marriage of the
KAISER's father with the PRINCEss
Royal, should be obliterated. It ought
not to be forgotten, difficult as it is to
realise now, that the KAISER's T
parents were gentlefolk.

The Vossische Zeitung attempts
to make capital out of the fact that
Germany uses, according to recent
statistics, 22 lbs. of soap per head
per annum, and England only
204 lbs. Even so the former
country does not seem to produce
very clean fighters.
By the way, at the annual meet-
ing of Messrs. Joseph WATson
AND SONs, soap-makers, the chair-
man stated that no fewer than
80 per cent. of their employees
had enlisted. We doubt, how-
ever, whether even these could

it?” they asked each other in tense
whispers.
There was no need to ask. The miser-
able young man, covered with blushes up
to his ears, was trying to hide himself
behind a salt-cellar and a sugar-basin.
There were excited whispers. “What
shall we do?” “Give him last week's
buns.” “Don't give him anything at
all.” “Give him one of Amy's white
feathers.” “Charge him double.”
Across these distracted counsels
came Rose's calm decided voice. “Take
away his bell," she said.
“The simplicity of a great mind,”
whispered Arthur.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WEEKLY ELUCIDATION.
(After the style of our leading strategic
journalist.)
THE WESTERN FRONT.
THE elements of the situation in the
West—as has been previously remarked
in these notes—are of a very simple
nature. If my readers are not familiar
with them by this time all I can say is
that I am not to blame. Nevertheless,
let us reiterate. You have two forces
opposing each other upon a front that
reaches from Switzerland to the North
Sea. This is not a Campaign of
Envelopment or of Encirclement: there
is no immediate prospect of its becom-
ing a Campaign of Central Disruption
(a decision, as I may have said before,
can only be achieved by piercing or
turning the enemy's line); it is a Cam-
paign of Cumulative Propulsion. In a
word it is chiefly a matter of shoving.
This point is admirably illustrated by
an incident, reported in the official
communiqué of Thursday last, which on
a small scale gives the key to the whole.
This incident occurred in the sector
Cuielly-la-Maison, in a small salient,
which has been held by the French (as
a point d'appui) since the afternoon
of November 17th. It is a part of the
line remote from human agglomerations
(nothing would induce me to say towns)
and the subsoil varies to some extent.
The entire front affected was only
twenty-seven yards, and the forces
engaged cannot have been excessive,
but it will be worth our while to
examine this little action (which the
German wireless reports, by the
way, have absurdly compared with
Auerstadt).
Here you had part of a platoon of
French Territorials in occupation of a
short railway embankment just south
of Cuielly-la-Maison station. I must
describe the terrain in detail. To
the west of the embankment a little
octagonal meadow of about 4% acres
runs north and south, and the subsoil
is, for the most part, clay. The surface
of the meadow is undulating: it con-
tains an old poplar tree in the south-
east corner, and there used to be a
cow in it. On the other side of the
embankment—occupied up to 5 P.M.
on Wednesday last by part of the
32nd Division of Würtemburgers — is
a Cattleman's Shed. Two-thirds of a
kilometre to the north of this is a
Journeyman's Shop, and in close ad-
jacence to the left centre of the French
position you have a Railwayman's Hut.
Let us now examine the action in
considerable detail—even at the risk of
wearying my readers. The German
attack began at dawn on the Wednes-
shell. (The reader will note that I
never write shells though I am always
willing to speak of propulsive explo-
sives.) Their reserves were no doubt
concealed in a leaſy little dell (where I
used to gather primroses) 968 yards
east of the Journeyman's Shop. The
subsoil in that direction is, curiously
enough, sand.
The French resistance must be dealt
with in still greater detail

on Tuesday evening, unless my watch
is fast—of a rather conflicting nature.
The Russian Effort in this direction,
which is neither an Initiative nor an
Aggressive, but a pure Offensive, has
brought about an instance of what is
known to strategists as the Waving
Line. (Arcola was a battle of the
waving line and the same may be said
to some extent of Bull Run; NAPOLEON
was a master of this form of strategy,
though, it is true, he began to wave it
too soon at Leipzig.) We need not at
the moment concern ourselves with the

operations in the Caucasus, where the
conflict has become purely a matter of
the Wobbling Front.
Now it must be manifest that a
waving line is not straight in the same
strict sense as a rigid line from point to
point is straight. Look at Diagram
352. (And here let me explain, in
response to many enquiries that have
reached me, that the fact that I
occasionally forget to stick into my
diagrams the letters referred to in my
brochures is due to the enormous
pressure of work one has to get
through of a Tuesday evening. Let
me beg you yet again to get it into
your heads that we go to press on
Wednesday. Commanders in the field
taken on that day must be carried over
till the following week.)
Dangerous salients will be observed
at the points A, B, C, D, E, F, etc.
Thus it comes about that a force
attacking in the direction of the arrow
at C (Diagram 353) is subject to a
devastating enfilading fire from J and
K. But at the same time a force at-
tacking at D is similarly subject to fire
from J2 and K2. But if this sort of
thing goes on a point must arrive when
K will become involved with the hostile
force at J2, unless there is an Obstacle
on the line C–D. Now this is just
what seems to be going on at Przlcow,
the obstacle in this case being the dis-
used railway cutting at X (where I
have enjoyed many a picnic in my
childhood). Should the Austrians
succeed in establishing a bridge-head
on the far side of this obstacle, the
Russians replying by a counter-offen-
sive-defensive, the whole of this sector
of the line may become compromised.
This is all that can be usefully said of
the Eastern theatre at the moment of
writing—10.59 P.M.
THE DARDANELLEs.
On this question I can only say that
we have no news. The operations have
not been timed so as to suit this
journal.
THE SUPPLY OF BUTTONs.
Judging by correspondence that is
reaching me in enormous quantities
there is still a good deal of misappre-
hension in the public mind upon this
most vital point. So let me say briefly
that we do not guess, we know that
buttons are necessary for the equipment
of the German soldier. Also we do not
have to calculate, we know that even at
the rate of one button a man—surely a
conservative estimate, but it is well in
these matters always to weigh the scales
against one's hopes—four or five million
buttons must be already in the field.
Of two things one. Either the supply
is ample or it is not. I shall return to
this point next week.
THE QUESTION of MoRAL.
I am forced to reopen this question
in this week's Notes owing to the
prevalent ignorance and confusion as
to what is meant by moral (which, by
the way, I shall continue to spell with-
out an e). It must be remembered
that we have to deal with three
different aspects of moral–Political
Moral, Economic Moral, and Military
Moral. But as I learn that we are
just on the point of going to press I
am compelled to reserve what I have to
say to be dealt with in a forthcoming
lecture at Queen's Hall, a notice of

DEAR CHARLEs, Since I last wrote
to you my time has been almost ex-
clusively devoted to that peculiarly
offensive animal the cheval de frise. Of
the many unpleasant things one may
meet on a dark night in these parts, this
is quite the worst. It has four long
wooden legs, two at each end: it
measures anything from ten to thirty
feet in length, and consists almost en-
tirely of barbed wire. It is only the
pleasing thought of the annoyance it
will cause to any Germans who step
across from over the way to call upon
us that enables us to bear with it while
we convey it from our local base to the
trench, for some hundreds of yards along
the trench, and finally over the parapet
into the open beyond. During this
period it displays—what no doubt it
supposes to be its charm—an affec-
tionate, clinging mood. To every tele-
phone wire, clothes line, pole, prop,
attaches itself tenaciously, and, if only
you would keep these letters of mine to
yourself, I could entertain you for an
hour with the language in which Joe
Bailey, Jim Perry, Harry Hughes and
one Bolter address it.
The other night I was assisting the
operations of these four stalwarts of
mine in front of the parapet, where
deadly silence is enjoined and observed
lest star shells, gearch-lights, bullets,
shrapnel, high explosives,handgrenades,
rifle grenades and what-notsensue, when
feelings reached a crisis. The last straw
broke the back of the camel, and a score
of sentries, listening in the night for the
slightest sound, were startled by “a

louder than those of ordinary conver-

We have had a curious instance of
the upside-down nature of things now

the bright sun of a Sunday afternoon,
just as you might be doing in your

explanation of the sentry (apparently

“But what about the subsequent

SONGS OF THE EMPIRE.
OUR contemporary, Splashes Weekly,
of Sydney, N.S.W., under the heading,
“The Bookshelf,” writes as follows:–
“A local application of the War is
to hand in a little book of verses by
Dorothy Frances McCrae, the talented
daughter of one of the most cultured
of Australian poets, George Gordon
McCrae. Soldier, My Soldier 1 is the
appropriate title of this book, which
contains thirteen excellent little poems,
specially concerned with the Expe-
ditionary Force, and giving the women's
view of the situation, calling forth so
signal a display of patriotism. The
book is very artistically printed, and
has an attractive pictorial cover in two
colours, with ribbon, and is published
at a shilling. It is sure to be very
popular. Here is a sample of the
Verses : —
Paek his shirt in prayers,
Cast lavender away;
Do not drop your tears
On the mufflers grey—
Put a pile of pluck and joy
In the kit you pack your boy.
That is the tone of all the poems—a
patriotic fervour, a depth of restrained
feeling.” -
Our readers, however, must not be
under the misapprehension that Miss
McCRAE alone of Colonial writers has
stepped into the artistic field opened
up by the War. Thus in Canada Miss
Margery Morne, daughter of the well-
known historian, Dr. Macnamara
Morne, of Toronto, moved by an in-
spiration which we can only charac-
terise as prodigious, has published a
dainty volume, appropriately called
Heroes All, to celebrate the departure
of one of the Canadian contingents.
This little work, which is charmingly
bound in detachable skunk moccasins
for the convenience of travellers, is
sold at one shilling net. We give an
excerpt which admirably illustrates
the high quality of the workmanship
displayed in the ten excellent little
poems which the book contains:–
Heroes all, heroes all,
At home do not stay !
Answer to your Empire's call,
Plunge into the fray !
Do not stop at home in bed!
Go and punch a German head |
In New Zealand Miss Esmeralda
Zadwick, daughter of the great and
well-known musical genius and entre-
preneur, Erasmus Zadwick, has electri-
fied and delighted the critics by pro-
ducing, under the pseudonym of “True
Bluebell,” a curiously fascinating book
of patriotic verse entitled Brave Soldier.
The designer of the cover is to be con-
gratulated on his happy taste, for it re-
(Premier of New Zealand) shaking
hands across a picture of H.M.S. New
Zealand, whilst beside them a British
lion is fraternising with a kiwi (the
New Zealand national bird). The fol.
lowing verse may be quoted as showing
Miss Zadwick's marvellous grasp of
the technique of versification:-
English soldiers, French soldats,
And the warriors of the CzAR,
God be with you in the War.
Europe need not feel a fear.
For our soldiers brave are there:
And we at home are doing our share,
Packing in a tidy box
Flammel shirts and warm thick socks,
To keep our soldiers' feet from knocks.
There is in this poem, as in the others, a
fine spirit of courageous altruism shining
through the inspired words, which is all
the more remarkable as Miss Zadwick
is only eleven years and seven months of
age. She is, however, a linguist of no
small attainments, speaking fluently
both Low and High German, Tamil,
Gaelic, Maori and Tierra del Fuegese,
in addition to her native English. She
is also a performer of no mean order
on the bass fiddle.
We are glad to receive from Fiji the
first-fruits of the pen of Miss Daisy
Dunkley; we say the pen, although in
fact it appears that her composition
was taken down in writing by her
father at the young lady's dictation.
The performance of this talented new
authoress is all the more noteworthy
and startling because she has barely
attained the age of nine months. Her
father, however, Mr. David Dunkley,
a prominent member of the Suva
Chamber of Commerce, has for years
been a constant contributor to the open
columns of The Fiji Times, and it is
thought by students of heredity that
his transcendent literary genius has
communicated itself to his daughter.
Be this as it may, the book, which
contains no fewer than fifty-three poems
of the highest order, has reached us for
review, and we find it somewhat diffi-
cult adequately to express our admira-
tion for it. The binding is most taste-
ful and attractive, being composed of
cocoanut fibre delicately plaited over a
handsome vellumesque cover, prepared
from hippopotamus-skin, with a back-
ing of pulped banana. What makes
this little book all the more delightful
(though perhaps less easy of under-
standing to the average reader) is the
fact that Miss Dunkley, with a mastery
of language rare in one so young, has
composed all her poems in the Cristo-
colombo dialect of the Solomon Islands,
a language which for soft vowel sounds
and harmonious quantities has no equal
in the world. The very name of the
Sacrifice), whilst possessing that sooth-
ing quality so dear to the ear of the
true poet, yet contrives to contain also
a scathing condemnation of German
military methods and manners. We
append the poem called “Umbo Upoo”
(i.e. “Our Soldiers") as being the best
of a very good collection:—
UMBO UPCo.
Umbo Upoo gåg-gug-gar
Ogglim fysh Luko
Marpit ologāg phumphphuphtar
Umbo garubbaboo.
Of which the following is a translation
obligingly furnished by Mr. David
Dunkley himself:-
Our soldiers are very brave, even brave as lions,
But they must have coats, these gallants, lest
they perish.
Pack shirts therefore (carefully addressed), O
old women
Soldiers' forget not the changing of garments
when wet.
From this sample our readerscan readily
see for themselves the fervour of white-
hot patriotism in which the poems
were composed. - -
In spite of her tender years, Miss
Dunkley shows high promise as a
linguist. She is undoubtedly a patriot
and an Empire-builder of the first rank,
and, although she cannot as yet play a
note on the bass fiddle, she is without
doubt a most talented performer in the
bassinette.

RECESSIONAL.
CAB whistles were shrieking and
shrilling on every side. The rain was
pouring. Commissionaires and other
theatre attendants were darting away
and returning clinging to the sides of
taxis. The lobby was a crush of white-
shirted men and low-necked women in
wraps. The pavements were filled
with passers-by. Under all the awn-
ings people were massed. Umbrellas
glistened.
In short, the conditions were ripe for
taking a backward step in civilisation
and hailing a hansom; and this is
what I did.
It was my first hansom for five or
six years, and the sensation of being
so near to the hindquarters of that
dangerous animal the horse, and having
no buffer state in the person of a driver,
| was alarming. At every slip it seemed
inevitable that the horse would fall.
He slid and sprawled and swerved
until I was sure my end had come:
all so different from the steady rigid
progress and security of a motor.
None the less, he did not fall, and by
degrees I won back some confidence,
and, the rain having ceased, leaned
over the doors and began rather to like
the fresh air and my romantic perch.
The taxi, I mused, is no such private
box at the comedy of the streets as a
hansom is. There is no invigoration
in a taxi, except possibly for the driver.
The past surged back. I thought of
hansom ºrides in the days, and even
more in the nights, when all the world
was young and WILLIAM II. of Ger-
| many was more or less a decent fellow.

wondered, recalling old arguments with
drivers which the introduction of the

many years now. I felt in my pocket.
I had only two half-crowns; they
were my sole silver coins; and the fare
in a taxi would be one-and-four and
twopence tip: one-and-sixpence. Would
the hansom driver have a shilling change
for one of my half-crowns, and would
he give it me if he had 2 So my

IN PRAISE of THE TAPE.
I'M going to give up the daily Press

And it sometimes runs amok;
But its negative virtues fully atone
For the tricks that are played by

Of the width of garters, with names of

Of war-news, great and small,

bears off
To pin them up in the hall.
The tape is unable to print a map,
But it never raves or squeals;
It has no novelist critic on tap
It gives the official news without
Superfluous gloss or frills, .
And it hangs no headline horrors out
Like the yellow newspapers' bills.

daisies,
Embroider each War-scribe's screed,

Who wrote of omelettes and eggs;

Premiership added strength in the

out the country. In this con-
nection Mr. HoggB strongly holds
the view that the reigning mon-
archs of to-day are mere mush-
rooms compared with the line of
Og, King of Basham.
HANDEL Booth doesn't think
there's very much in that. What
is rather needed to strengthen the
Government in time of national
peril is the addition to its ranks
of a man of independent character,
wide views and the gift of dis-
cursive speech.
Mr. KING has his own opinions.
A man intimately familiar with
domestic affairs in territories
stretching from China to Peru,
who moreover was upon occasion
ready to pose a Minister with
queries dealing with the minutiae
of domestic matters in country
parishes—such a man, he ven-
tures to think, is the sort calcu-
lated to raise the Government from
the lamentable level toward which
it is daily sinking.
“What is really wanted,” said
By-Your-LEIF-Jon Es, “is a man
at the head of affairs capable of
subordinating everything to one
great purpose. I—and in this
matter perhaps I may be said to
represent the nation — have no
patience with a rum-and-milk policy.
Let us have rum or milk.”
It is recognised that what HANDEL
last night hailed as “a united Ministry
| that is coming and will come before
|long." must be partly recruited
from the Benches opposite. In view
of this contingency KINLoch CookE
would like it known in the proper
quarter that no personal prejudice in
favour of one Department of the State
or another would stand for a moment
in the way of his obedience to the call
of duty. Whilst, like the late Lord
John RUSSELI, he is prepared to take
command of the Channel Fleet at ten
minutes' notice, he is equally ready to
relieve Lord KITCHENER of the burden
of responsibility which the War Office
imposes.
Sir John REEs would not go so far
as that. He holds the opinion that
if by chance a man, with whatsoever
measure of universal knowledge, super-
adds a speciality of information in a
particular field, it is there he has the
fullest opportunity of saving the State.
Incidentally, he is reminded that after

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AT THE FRONT.
EveR since I gave up working and
became a soldier I have longed to be
in charge of an outpost. Then at last
I felt I should get clear about the
relations of its curious component
parts. Can you, for instance, I have
wondered, draw on your fatigue men
for sentries over reconnoitring patrols 2
If you can't, you have twenty idle
men and fifty vacant jobs; if you can,
you have twenty men far too busy
doing the fifty jobs. It didn't seem
quite satisfactory either way. I felt it
must be one of those arrangements
that are right enough in practice but
break down when you come to theory.
I wanted the thing to play with a little
by myself.
Not until three days ago, however,
was I ever in charge of any such thing;
then to my great joy, instead of going
back to the enervating influence of our
billets, I was sent to look after twenty
men and one outpost.
Frankly I am disappointed. I don't
believe it is an outpost. I don't believe
it ever was an outpost. The twenty
men are there all right. True, I'm
always losing one or two in the straw,
but they turn up again at rifle in-
spection. I don't really complain of
the men; it's the apparatus that's
all wrong. The post—I won't call it
“out" any more; if I qualified it at all
I should call it an inpost—consists of
a stable, two cupboards, and a cellar.
There used to be a house, too, facing
towards Germany, but I can't find it
anywhere now. -
So much for the actual post. Now
for us. We never reconnoitre, we
never patrol, we never picket and we
hardly ever fatigue. One sentry, and
he by night only, watches over the
entire proposition. If you were to
enter suddenly you would fancy you
had stumbled upon a homoeopathic
hospital for the treatment of sleeping
sickness—in short, non outpost sed
bedpost.
The reasons for this scandalous state

To leave the post by day you must

“It has,” I said, “but we’ve got to set our teeth and see

“Yes,” she said, “and we've all got to help wherever we

“And women,” she said enthusiastically, “have at last

“They never were,” I said. “That is to say, they never

most men are to do that.” -
“All the same,” she said, “a good many men tried.”
“It was a poor effort,” I said.
“Yes,” she said, “it was. It always began by declaring
that women had no logic.”
“Logic " I said. “Pooh What is logic 2 Who cares

“Logic,” she said, “is the science and art of reasoning
correctly. I looked it up in a dictionary.”
“And here is a woman,” I said, “who can find time in
the midst of a million Committees to look up a disagreeable
word in a dictionary. Francesca, why did you do that 2"

“Sympathy,” she said, “charity, mutual help, relief

“Yes,” I said, “they're all excellent; but we want to
invent something quite new, something that will take our
thoughts off the War for a moment or two.”
“That's difficult,” she said.
“But not impossible. Why not try footmanry 2”
“Footman what?” she said.
“Footmanry. It is the new science and art of footmen.
Yeoman—yeomanry. Footman—footmanry.”
“It's out of the beaten track, anyway,” she said. “How
do you work it?”
“Well, you begin by postulating a footman.”
“It sounds cruel,” she said, “but I think I can manage it.”
“Then you inquire into him, and you find that the foot-
man is the young of the butler.”
“Yes,” she said, “but the butler doesn't like his young.
In fact he can't bear him. He says he can't get him out

will answer.”
“As far as my experience goes,” she said, “the reason is
that if the footman didn't get up there'd be nobody to help
in smashing glasses and other things. Glasses have to be
smashed regularly, and so the footman must get up. It's
one of the rules.”
“Yes,” I said, “and another rule is that after a year or
so the footman wants to better himself, but according to
the butler he gets worse all the time.”
“And when he betters himself he vanishes.”
“And when he's bettered himself about four times he
turns into a butler himself and begins to dislike footmen.”
“I see,” she said, “that there are many fascinating
mysteries about footmen.”
“There are,” I agreed. “Why, for instance, do they

AT THE PLAY.
“THE DAY BEFORE THE DAY.”
I on LY wish the stage were a mirror
of life in the matter of the spy spied-on;
for in Mr. FERNALD's new play, as in
The Man that Stayed at Home, the
alien enemy within our gates is
gloriously confounded. In the present
case he is not defeated by superior
wit; the author relies upon the superb
bravado of his hero and the no less
superb credulity of his audience. Be-
tween the two of them they bring about
the collapse of a diabolically ingenious
organisation. - - -
The plot was not so clear in detail
as we should have liked it, but we
never permitted this defect
to cloud our confidence in a
happy issue. For on a happy
issue depended not only the
existence of our nation, but
the author's chance of a run
for his trouble. - All the same
we were kept in a right state
of tension for two-thirds of the
time. • * * * *- :------
The chief notes of the play
were revolvers and - musk. .
Musk was the scent worn by
the envelopes which contained
the letters written - by von
Ardel of the Prussian Guard –
to an English girl, Victoria
Buckingham, who had once
been engaged to him. The
interception of one of his
letters had laid her under sus- "S
picion, and von Ardel's idea lº
was to bring about a meeting
with her on the strength of
their former relations, and to
place in her hands a false plan
of invasion which would be
sure to fall into the clutches
of the War Office and put them on
the wrong track — Northumberland,
in fact, instead of. Kent. The en-
velopes in which his secret instruc-
tions arrived - were strewn all over.
the stage, and one could almost sniff
the asphyxiating perfume of their
musk in the tenth row of the stalls.
As for the revolvers, it is a long time
since I have seen so many whipped out
at one moment. The only one amongst
the spies who never could get his weapon
out in time was an American, and
you would have expected him to be the
handiest of them all. Fortunately, not
a single revolver was discharged, except
“off” and between the Acts, so that
the report of it only reached us verbally.
But there was a period, that seemed
interminable, during which the only
thing that intervened between von
Ardel and his target was the frail form

cumvented. Nothing but the fact that
he had other designs for the lady could
have deterred him—being a Prussian
—from letting the bullet take her
en route. - -
The first scene of the Second Act
was extremely well done. It gave us
the East Coast haunt of the spies—a
member of the Prussian Secret Service,
a stockbroker, a German-American and
a Professor of Infernal Mechanics.
They talked German and English alter-
nately with equal ease, though the
Professor felt it incumbent upon him
to correct the American's pronuncia-
tion of the ch in ausgezeichnet. |

spirit, showing its thoroughness, the
intensity of its purpose, its readiness
to sacrifice the individual for the cause,
the iron discipline which directs its
licence and organises its passionate
hate. The man who came out of it
worst (for Mr. FERNALD is not very
tender to his countrymen) was the
American Schindler, who never got
much farther than a protest against
brutality to women, and a hint of what
his nation might do if it was annoyed.
“You're not a nation,” said one of the
Germans, “you're a mass meeting.”
The second scene (unchanged) of this
same Act was a little dragged out.
For a long time Captain Howison, the
British Intelligence Officer, has nobody
to talk to on the stage. He has been
left alone in the dark, gagged and
bound and riveted to the vall. With
his free foot he reaches a chair and

quired he reaches a table, and luckily
finds a knife in the drawer of it, and so
cuts the ropes that hold his arms. With
fresh prehensile power he now reaches
a long pole with a hook to it, fishes
a box from across the room, finds it
contains the very tool he wants, and
unrivets his leg. All this took time,
and so did the long interval, largely de-
voted to the levelling of revolvers, before
he could get to grips with von Ardel.
But Mr. LYN HARDING was equal to his
responsibilities and kept us alert. In-
deed he shone in action much more than
in speech., Twice he was called upon
to cope with improbable conditions.
When, in the First Act, he suddenly
returns from the dead (out in
Alaska), the author provides
º him with no argument (except
his falsely-reported death) by
which to explain' to the lady
broken silence. His manner
was abrupt and halting, and
you wondered a little why he
was selected for the Intelli-
gence Department. In the
Second Act, again, when he
appeared, unarmed and un-
announced, among the gang
of enemy spies, his method of
introducing himself was ex-
tremely unconvincing, and it
seemed incredible that he
should not have been shot at
sight with all those revolvers
ſ about, or at least have been
thrust “into the Professor's
electric crematorium under
the stage. ". . .” l
... The honours of the evening
went to Miss GRACE LANE,
- who played the part of Vic-
- toria Buckingham with a most
compelling sincerity. From the first
there was need of great candour On
her part to disarm the suspicions both
of her friends on the stage and us in
the-audience. -- But - Miss-LANE - made
an easy conquest of all the hearts

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
THERE are few themes so full of horrible and creepy
fascination as that of witch-finding. The historic and noto-
rious epidemic of it in New England has been taken by
those clever sisters who combine as “K. L. MonTGOMERY”
for the subject of their latest novel, Maids of Salem (LONG).
You can hardly expect it to be a cheerful tale, but the
interest is undeniable. This same interest, however, and
the effect of the book generally, would be much increased
if the authors would prune a little the luxuriance of their
style. If ever there was a case of the wood being hidden
by the trees, it is here. Every character in the book
garnishes his or her talk with such a wealth of metaphor
and archaic ornament that I have felt tempted to quote the
exhortation of the Lancashire man, and beg “K. L. Mont-
blithely than in the dear old church where so many genera-
tions of the Cheshire family had espoused middle-class
heiresses from the highest commercial motives. So that's
all right. It is a thin little story, but Mr. HAMILTON pads
it out to a marketable size with the aid of his amazing gift
of language. Words flutter from him like bats out of a
barn. He can say the same thing over and over again in
a different way oftener than any other novelist of my
acquaintance. And in these days when the public chooses
its books from the library almost entirely for their chunki-
ness an author can have no more useful gift.
Perhaps you would not think that the making of quarry-
waste into vitrified slate would be the most satisfactory
background for a love story, but Miss UNAL. SILBERRAD, in
Co-Directors (Hodder AND STOUGHToN), has chosen it
deliberately, and done very well with it. True, there is
GoMERY” to “get eendways
wi' the tale.” In one kind,
however, the authors do exer-
cise a commendable restraint;
we have little insistence upon
the merely physical horrors of
the persecution. Without this
there is enough of dread in the
pictures of a time when the
lives of the most innocent were
at the mercy of the random ac-
cusations of hysterical children.
The other phases of the story,
the love-making of Favour Gray
and young Constant Grenvil,
and the somewhat conventional
missing-heir motive, are less
striking. But it is the witch-
craft that makes the book; and
I wish “K. L. MonTGOMERY”
would publish a translation of
it into simple English.
The poor dear young Duke of

way he described the latter course). If he ran away
with the other man's wife, he would not get the money;
if he concentrated on the money, he would not get the
other man's wife. It was a trying situation for a fine,
thoroughbred young Englishman, and I was not surprised
that Mr. Cosmo HAMILTON grew almost tearful over it in
the course of the three hundred and sixty-three pages of
The Miracle of Love º AND BLACKETT). These are
the real tragedies of life. I think the poignancy of the
thing was a little too much for Mr. Hamiros. it obsessed
him. Most of the first hundred or so pages are occupied
with the Duke's narration of his troubles, first to one
minor character, then to another. And as it is a peculiarity
of Mr. HAMILTON's literary style that he never uses ten
words where a thousand will produce the same effect this
tends to become tedious. And—but I was forgetting that
all this time you are on tenterhooks to know if it all ended
happily. It did. The other man died, and the Duke's

say of these people as by the delightfully ingenuous details
he gives of himself. True, he suggests that those who are
likely to be more interested in his reminiscences than in his
life should begin at Chapter VIII., but this advice I am
thankful not to have followed. For had I neglected those
opening chapters I should not have known where Mr.
SLADEN was baptized, and I should also have missed this
magnificent statement:="At Cheltenham I was the most
prominent boy of my time, and the prestige with which I
came up from school gave me a certain momentum at
Oxford." In justice, however, I must add that Mr.
SLADEN is as frankly generous to most of his “leading
people” as he is to himself, and that, whatever the faults of
his book may be, it is, and will be, valuable as a work of
reference and appreciation. Mr. Yoshio MARKINo has con-
tributed some colour pictures of various parts of the house

of it, and never have the wedding-bells rung out more

A battalion of regulars, who, also taking advantage

Our ceremonial parade was marred by the conduct of the

of military etiquette on the march past, none of which was
excusable even if a mosquito did bite him under the left
eye at a critical moment. He said something that was not
in the Infantry Training Book, threw the battalion out of
step and finished his salute before passing the post.
The camp pastimes consisted largely of trench digging
and tactical manoeuvres. The ungrudging manner in
which one of our Platoon Commanders in the course of
swinging a pick sacrificed his near fourth rib to the
double event with his neighbour's shoulder and his own
shin in one swing was considered clumsy. Considerable
ingenuity was shown in disguising the trenches. In spite

whom he employs to abstract valuable stamps
from famous collections. She cherishes a
secret passion for Harold, and hopes to tempt
him from his Emilia by pandering to his
craving for hitherto unobtainable specimens.
Steinart, having discovered that his employé
dares to be his rival with Emilia, has sent
him on a special mission to Germany to buy
Teddy Bears for the Toy Department, and
hopes to attain his object before Harold can
return. -
Read on from here--if you have any strength
left.]
CHAPTER XLVI.
Steinart was shown into Emilia's
boudoir, tastefully decorated with glass
cases containing the famous Collection,
anjong which he saw with a spasm of
joy the exquisite designs and colours
of the Salvador gems.
The fair occupant was bending over
a table on which lay a sheet of stamps
of the 1823 issue of Kamschatka.
She was deep in the absorbing task
of separating those with the full-stop
after the “A” (value sixteen a penny)
from those without the full stop (Cata-
logue value 39s. 6d. each), and did not
at first observe him.
When she at last did so she bowed
coldly, at the same time tactfully
stifling a yawn with her pocket
magnifier.
She made a pretty picture as she
stood in her 5 cent French 1906 issue
green evening wrap, trimmed with fur
of the peculiar shade seen to such
advantage in the background of the
Russian 2 kopeck of 1875.
Her features had all the natural
grace observable in the early Colonial
attempts at the presentment of Her
Majesty QUEEN VICTORIA, but a close
observer might have noticed that the
pupil of one of her eyes was badly
centred, while a fairly well defined
watermark was visible in the shading
of her neck.
“Why do you force yourself on me
like this 2" exclaimed the beautiful
more worthless in my eyes than even
the ten pfennig stamp of the country
which had the misfortune to give you
birth.”
“Ha! you haſ then not yet heard
the news,” hissed Steinart. “War has
been declared between England and
Germany, and every Stamp Collector
in the country is wringing his hands
over the ‘worthless' German stamps
he has so often contemptuously thrown
away, each one of which is now worth
at least double its weight in three-
penny-bits' "
“And Harold ! What of him 2 ''
shrieked Emilia, as she suddenly realised
the horror of the situation.
“Interned in Germany as an English
spy,” returned Steinart with guttural
flee. -
Emilia fell over in a swoon, fortun-
ately landing on a large sack of
Portuguese Colonials (surcharged “Re-
publica”) which had just arrived and
so escaping injury.
When she recovered the German had
disappeared, and on going to the
window she observed him some distance
down the street with a large flat parcel
under his arm.
For a few seconds she hardly realised
what had occurred ; then, with a wild
cry and a despairing look at the empty
space on the wall, she sank to the
floor in a second merciful access of
unconsciousness.
The priceless case of San Salvadors
had disappeared
CHAPTER XLVII.
In a lonely turret cell in the grim
prison fortress of Schweinoberundunter-
wolfenberg Harold Pootwink had now
been immured for over two months.
Late one evening he was seated over
the remains of a miserable meal, with
his precious Stamp Album, of which
even the brutality of his gaolers had
not deprived him, propped against a
loaf of war bread.
Forgetful of his sordid surroundings
he was feasting his eyes on the match-
less beauty of the new English “Post-
age Dues” he had recently acquired,
when the door opened noiselessly and
a figure in the long cloak of a German
officer stood before him.
Harold rose to his feet as the cloak
was thrown aside, revealing the magni-
ficent form of Magda Ivanovitch.
“Cruel boy!” she whispered; “see
what dangers I have passed through
for your sake. Come; my private air-
ship lies moored at the window outside
your cell. We have but to fly together
to some far land where this frightful
war cannot reach us, and in savage
solitude live for love and stamps alone.”
but the lovely Magda, sinking on her
knees before him, cried, “Ah! do not
spurn me. I can make you famous,
the possessor of stamps which Kings
have fought for.” -
With these words she drew from her
Rican issue of 1892, but bluish green

in England.
Regaining command of himself with
an effort he turned away from the
temptress, exclaiming in a broken
voice, “Enough even for these I can-
not give up my Emilia.” .
Magda's features grew as white as a
plain embossed stamp as she cried,
“Your Emilia, forsooth ! Do you still
dream of that baby-faced child while
Fool! months ago she forgot you, and
already when I left London her en-
gagement to Steinart was rumoured

Harold's iron manhood almost failed
him, but only for a moment. Drawing
himself up as nearly to his full height as
the ceiling of his cell would permit, he
retorted, “You say her engagement is

LADY TU-TI.
IF you've moments to spare, will you spare me a few
While I make you acquainted with Tu-Ti (or Tu)?
With her mane, which is thick, and her waist, which is thin,
She derives from the bluest blue blood of Pekin,
And to those who would question her race she is able
To prove by her genealogical table,
Far beyond all the carpings of ignorant malice,
That her ancestors lived and were pets in a palace.
Please note as she sleeps on her favourite bed
That her muzzle is black and the rest of her red,
With a sleekness so sleek it were shame to have roughed it,
While her nose is turned up and her trousers are tufted.
Lo, she shakes off her slumber and stretches and seems
To emerge with regret from the country of dreams,
With a yawn so immense that you'd think I defied her
To see who could yawn it the pinker and wider.
It is time for her walk, but, alas! she sets eyes on
Her harness and stands like a miniature bison,
A rebuke to the humans who foolishly tether
The soul and the legs of a lady with leather.
But at last she submits, and her footfall is fleet
As Her Daintiness skims through the crowds in the street.
She's as light as the air and as gay as a lark,
Being bound for the freedom and joy of the Park.
“Ho, bring me the Round Pond this very same minute,”
She cries, and she tugs at her lead and is in it;
And I'm bound to confess, though she's dry as a clinker,
We have all of us faults; even Tu has her failings,
Such as leaving her home through the area railings.
Recaptured and rated she proves her contrition
By assuming a pose of the meekest submission.
Her conviction of sin isn't open to doubt;
She repents most sincerely of being found out.
Though her learning is scanty in Greek or in Latin,
There are tricks not a few she is perfectly pat in.
Hold your stick off the ground, half a yard or so from it,
And lo, with a rush of a fiery-tailed comet,
Inspired with pure rapture and eager to dare,
She has cleared the great fence without turning a hair.
She can die for her country, her King and her brothers,
While she keeps an eye open for Germans and others.
Fascination's her forte; she's aware how it tells,
So she sits up on end and starts weaving her spells;
And she never gives up till you pay the magician
With a store of tit-bits as an aid to nutrition.
Did you notice—I did—in The Pekinese Times
An announcement deserving of pictures and rhymes?
“In her basket,” it said, and I read it with joy,
“Lady Tu-Ti of twin-pups, a girl and a boy.” R. C. L.

By an odd chance I met them all on
the same day, one at a club, one in
the street, and one in a train. All are
between forty and fifty; in fact, con-

started. To-day no one knows what

A SEA-CHANGE OF MIND.
- Twickenham, May 3rd.
MY DEAR TANKER,--It is all right.
Batson says the fishing is excellent,
and the house is at my disposal; the
caretaker will look after us and the
bailiff will show us the ropes. I can
get away for a fortnight, and if you can
travel by the Irish Mail Boat on the
20th I will complete arrangements.
Ever yours, BRANDoN QUINN.
Hampstead, May 4th.
MY DEAR QUINN,+Right you are.
I'm your man for the 20th. I feel
sorry for your Batson's salmon already.
How big are they, and are they fat
ones and fairly tame? What is their
favourite fly, and do they like a single
or a double hook best ? or shall I
bring prawns? and what about waders
and a harpoon?
Twickenham, May 5th.
MY DEARTANKER,--Batson says it's
all bank fishing, and prawns are no
use. Fly and spinners, which can be
got locally, are what are wanted.
Yours ever, BRANDoN QUINN.
P.S.—What do you think about this
submarine scare?
Twickenham, May 9th.
DEARTANKER,-You did not answer
my question about the submarines.
There is no doubt that there are lots
about, and they mean mischief. I feel
that to risk our lives in the pursuit of
pleasure is, perhaps, a little uncalled-
for just now. Will you let me know
what you think?
Ever yours, BRANDON QUINN.
Hampstead, May 10th.
MY DEAR QUINN, The line I take is
that no German, in or out of a sub-
marine, is going to interfere with any
mission of defeat. Besides the risk is
practically nil.
Yours, P. S. TANKER.
Twickenham, May 11th.
DEAR TANKER,--I quite agree that
this country ought not to admit that
the German blockade is successful,
but we are too old to fight, and I do
not see what benefit it would be to the
country if we were blown up. Besides,
I have the office to think of, and the
Lawn Tennis Club, of which I am Sec-
retary and Treasurer. Who could take
my place? Then again, the risk is a
real one. The news of the past few
days leaves no doubt on that point. It
seems to me that we ought seriously to
consider whether it is right for us to go.
Yours, BRANDON QUINN.

zagging about with lights out. I have
decided that I should be failing in my
duty to my numerous relations and
friends, and to the office and Tennis
Club, etc., if I risked my life for a
few days' salmon fishing. Besides,
salmon fishing is all a matter of luck,
and we might get very few fish or
none at all.
Yours sincerely,
BRANDON QUINN.
Hampstead, May 12th.
DEAR QUINN, I do not feel inclined
to give ground to any piratical German
marauders. Your letter astonished
me. We know that there are sub-
marines about, but your only objec-
tion appears to be that adequate pre-
cautions are taken to elude them. I
understand that if the boat steamed
slowly on a direct course, with lights
burning brightly, you would be ready
to go in her. You remind me of the
lady who refused to make a voyage in
a ship because she saw a lifebelt in
her cabin. By staying below you need
not know how the ship is being steered
or whether lights are burning or not.
You want to know too much. Your
job is to be properly seasick and to
leave the rest to the captain. It is
quite probable that you are not nearly
so popular at the office as you suppose,
and the Tennis Club will struggle along
without you all right, never fear. If
we are blown up we shall only fall into
water; fibre waistcoats that will float
one like a cork can be obtained; water-
tight sandwich cases can be got for a
few shillings, and I know you already
possess a flask for keeping liquor hot.
If you dislike the idea of getting wet,
you can smear yourself with axle-
grease, which is quite cheap, and I will
gladly lend you a watch that keeps
better time wet than dry.
Yours very truly, P. S. TANKER.
Twickenham, May 14th.
DEAR TANKER,--I have been con-
sidering your letter, and in spite of its
uncalled-for levity I agree with you
that one ought not to admit that the
German blockade is achieving its pur-
pose by interfering with our holiday;
still one must not be unduly self-
indulgent. I hear that a submarine
was seen off Holyhead only two days
ago. I have made enquiries about
insurance rates, and they are prohibitive
when one's purpose is nothing but a
little fishing. I am sure you must
agree with me. It is not as if one had
only oneself to consider. -
Hampstead, May 15th.
DEAR QUINN, It must be all bosh
about the submarine off Holyhead.
Someone has been frightened by a
lobster pot. However, you seem to
have made up your mind, so it is no
good saying any more on the subject.
Yours truly, P. S. TANKER.
Twickenham, May 16th.
DEAR TANKER,-Oh, all right. If
you are going to be huffy about not
going, let's go. I'm sure I don't mind
the risk if you don't.
Yours truly, BRANDON QUINN.

suggestion that if anything happened
to you and I felt when I got back that
it was due to my having persuaded you
from your better judgment I should
feel very uncomfortable indeed; and I
am bound to say that I think I should.
It was a point that had not occurred to
me. Added to all this, I have just
consented to second a motion in favour,
of a new stove - pipe at our annual
parish meeting, and I cannot very well
let them down as we are up against a
most formidable reactionary movement.
So I'm afraid there is no chance of my
being able to come with you. I am
sorry. You see how it is, don't you?
It's not my fault, I mean; I have all

as you know.
Ever, my dear Quinn,
Yours, P. S. TANKER.

JONES-SUPER-PATRIOT.
Jones (I'm very sorry, but his name
is really Jones) is a true patriot, every
inch of him; but unfortunately he hasn't
many inches. Nevertheless, the War
wasn't a week old before Jones placed
all sixty-one of them at the disposal
of the nation. And they threw him
out because sixty-one was not enough.
Later, when the official altitude-scale
was reduced, he offered them again ;
but on this occasion they threw him
out because his teeth came from Wel-
beck Street. And when subsequently
the War Office decided that false teeth
were not necessarily a barrier to a
military career; were, in fact, a valuable
asset in connection with bully-beef, they
threw him out because he saw nineteen
spots on, à card that only possessed
seven. And then, when the authorities
at last came to look upon pince-nez with
a more benignant eye, they threw him
out because, while they had been busy
rejecting him for paucity of inches,
falsity of teeth, and debility of eyes,
Jones had passed the age-limit; and
when he wanted to argue the point
witḥ the Recruiting Officer they threw
him out once more for luck.
Then he tried for the Special Con-
stabulary, and the first night he
was on duty he contracted pneumonia,
bronchitis, influenza and laryngitis.
And they threw him out of that because
they wanted Special Constables and
not collectors of germs.
When he got better—and his con-
da
valescence was a long business not-
withstanding that his sentences ran
concurrently—he applied to join the
A. A.C. and would have got in if the
Medical Officer had not rung

out because sixty-one was not enough.
Later, when the official altitude-scale
was reduced, he offered them again ;
but on this occasion they threw him
out because his teeth came from Wel-
beck Street. And when subsequently
the War Office decided that false teeth
were not necessarily a barrier to a
military career; were, in fact, a valuable
asset in connection with bully-beef, they
threw him out because he saw nineteen
spots on a card that only possessed
seven. And then, when the authorities
at last came to look upon pince-nez with
a more benignant eye, they threw him
out because, while they had been busy
rejecting him for paucity of inches,
falsity of teeth, and debility of eyes,
Jones had passed the age-limit; and
when he wanted to argue the point
with the Recruiting Officer they threw
him out once more for luck.
Then he tried for the Special Con-
stabulary, and the first night he
was on duty he contracted pneumonia,
bronchitis, influenza and laryngitis.
And they threw him out of that because
they wanted Special Constables and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.
VIII. -
My DEAR MR. PUNCH,-Immense and
portentous events are taking place in
Europe as I write, but among us the
great subject of discussion is mou-
staches, upon which, it would appear,
the strength and military glory of the
British Empire ultimately depend.
When the War broke out many of us
who are accustomed to go clean-shaven
in civilian life foolishly imagined that
King's Regulation Number One-thou-
sand-and-something would not in our
case be strictly enforced. In a period
of desperate emergency, we told our-
selves, the authorities would concen-
trate their efforts upon making us fit
for active service in the field in the
shortest possible time, and, recognising
that we were merely temporary soldiers,
would ignore our smooth upper lips.
During all these months we have
clung to this pleasant delusion, but at
last we have been undeceived. Some-
one in authority, I take it, has been
reviewing the situation after nine
months of war, and has found cause
for dissatisfaction. Everything was not
as it should be. Some undiscovered
influence was hindering the full success
of our arms. What could it be? As
he was pondering, there was brought
to him the staggering information that
a number of Territorials in India were
shaving their upper lips. No wonder
the Germans had not yet been driven
out of Belgium.
So the fiat went forth, and now every
man of us, under the threat of hideous
penalties, is allowing the abhorred
fungus to sprout as freely as nature
permits, and the final defeat of the
Huns is doubtless in sight. .
We of course accept this facial dis-
figurement for the period of the War
with the same resignation that we have
displayed with regard to our other dis-
comforts. If the maintenance of the
I’mpire depends upon hairy upper lips,
then the Territorials will never shrink
from their duty. Thus a suggestion
that we should show public resentment
by taking advantage of another pro-
vision of the same Regulation and grow-
ing side-whiskers was at once rejected
from motives of pure patriotism.
When I expressed the opinion, some
little time ago, that the tales about the
Indian climate with which we had
been regaled were much exaggerated, I
omitted to take the simple and obvious
precaution of touching wood. The
result is great heat, or, to employ the
more expressive language of the coun-
try, pukka garmi. We are sweltering
inside the walls of our Fort like
But every cloud has a silver lining,
and the hot weather has already worked
one beneficent miracle—we are allowed
to do certain of our guards, if we wish,
in shirtsleeves. To show the profound
nature of this revolution, let me describe
the authentic experience of a friend of
mine on Salisbury Plain in the far-away
days before we left England. .
He was on guard one night, pacing
up and down in full marching order,
when it began to rain heavily. My
friend had never been in such a situation
before, and it seemed to his unsophisti-
cated intelligence that it was foolish to
get wet through while a neatly-rolled
overcoat was strapped to his shoulders.
On the other hand he knew enough to
refrain from taking such a grave step
as to unroll the overcoat on his own
initiative, and he therefore called out
the Corporal of the Guard to consult
him on the matter. Unfortunately the
Corporal misunderstood the situation
and turned out the Guard, a proceeding
which made my friend for a time the
most unpopular man in the South of
England. - -
When this difficulty had been adjusted,
an animated discussion on the problem
took place between the Corporal and
the Sergeant of the Guard. The former
was of opinion that nothing could be
done. If the Guard paraded with
rolled overcoats he felt positive that
overcoats must be carried rolled for
the next twenty-four hours, whatever
happened. -
The Sergeant, on the contrary, was
not quite sure. He had an idea that
there were circumstances in which it
was permissible to unroll an overcoat
and actually wear it. But he was not
prepared to take the responsibility
upon himself, and he accordingly sent
the Corporal to request the Officer of
the day to step down to the guard tent.
"The Officer of the day was frankly
nonplussed, but, being young, was pre-
pared to take the risk. He therefore
sent out a very unwilling substitute
for my friend, while the latter (now
wet through) came into the tent to put
on his coat. - -
Both the Sergeant and the Corporal
were extremely horrified at my friend's
idea that he should merely slip on the
coat outside his equipment until the
rain stopped. Such a costume was
not provided for in Army Regulations,
and could not be tolerated for a moment,
even in the middle of the night. So
he had to remove his belt, bandolier,
water-bottle, haversack, etc. (we were
not provided with the new webbing
equipment), and put them all on again
(properly adjusted) outside the over-
coat. .
Sergeant asserted that, if the Officer
was of opinion that the weather con-
ditions were such as to necessitate the
wearing of overcoats, all the men on
guard must wear theirs, so as to be
dressed alike. He was not the man.
to shirk an unpleasant duty, and he,
woke up the harassed Guard again:
and made them go through the same
performance, to a steady accompani-
ment of muttered profanity. Then the
dripping substitute was called in, and
my friend went out to his post, to findi
the storm over and the night full
of stars. - -
Thus you can understand why we,
smile happily to ourselves as we leave;
the guardroom to go on sentry in our
greybacks (if we wish), even though:
the heat as we step outside seems to:
leap up from the ground and hit us;
with a bang in the face.
Another circumstance which marked
the arrival of the heat-wave proves.
that we are still strangers in a strange
land. Man after man a short time ago;
used to return from his evening stroll:
with the conviction that he was in for
a severe bilious attack. Each had
received that unmistakable warning—
the dancing of bright spots before the
eyes. - -
Our education proceeds. We know :
:
-
*
now, when the familiar symptom
appears, that it is not biliousness but
fireflies. . . . . . . •,
Life is of necessity a very dull affair
for us here, but the authorities, solicitous
as ever for our physical and mental
welfare, have recently devised a pastime
to keep us occupied during the long
hours of the day when it is too hot to
leave the barracks." They have served
out mosquito nets and have given us
peremptory instructions to keep them
in proper repair. Now these nets are
so constructed that if one breathes
heavily they fly into holes. Conse-
quently we spend all our spare time
busily plying needle and cotton.
I should never have believed that
material of such excessive flimsiness
could possibly be manufactured. The
other evening, I was lying on my bed,
watching a mosquito outside the net
busily seeking an entrance. At length,
weary of flying, he decided for a change
to continue his investigations on foot.
In landing (if you will believe me) he
broke clean through the net and fell on
my face with a crash.
Yours ever,

(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
MR. GALsworthy has never been much in love with the
plain Englishman. He has often dealt him very shrewd
and cutting strokes. Perhaps he might plead that the
cruelty of deftly turning the knife in the wound cannot be
so very great, seeing that the victim (as happens rather
from the nature of the victim than the operation) makes no
general sign of taking notice. In The Little Man and other
Satires (HEINEMANN) he is at his old task again. “The
Little Man” is, in form of a playlet, a fantastic study of an
odd, insignificant, pathetic idealist who finds himself, by
accident of travel, left with a strange woman's baby, and
faces with equanimity the typhus with which it is thought
to be infected. Of course you can't state the case in such
bald terms without injustice to what is actually a very
amusing and effective trifle. But the meat of the book is in
the other satires, and chiefly “The Plain Man” and “The
Perfect One” (who is in fact merely the Superplain One).
For, though Mr. GALsworthy scarifies The Artist, The
Critic and The Writer, the studies of these latter types
seem rather academic essays in the gentle art of flaying
alive, whereas the others express the author's characteristic
attitude towards life. His hand has not lost its cunning,
but one feels that this is pre-eminently one of the many
books written before the War which the War throws out of
key. In the matter of the plain man, for instance, I doubt
if Mr. GALsworthy will ever again write or think of him in
quite the same way; so obviously and so often in these
grim months has this simple, substantial type done the
plain, hard, right thing in the heroically right way; and
facing Death, fixed on the ball that he had just hit so hard,”
flutter lamely to the ground.
Most fervently I hope that the title of Dr. J. WILLIAM
WHITE's book will not prevent it from achieving an enor-
mous circulation in this country. A Text-Book of the War
for Americans (WINSTON) is not exactly a seductive title, but
when that obstacle has been overcome you will thank me
for recommending one of the most illuminating books that
the War has brought forth. Dr. WHITE is a modest man,
out to tell the truth. He is surprised at the success that
his earlier work on the same subject has already gained in
America, but there is really no reason for wonder that so
lucid a statement of his case should attract and convince ||
countless readers. As everyone knows, the strong point of
the Allies' cause is that they have been able to lay their
facts upon the table of the world, and to ask that they may
be judged wholly and solely by them. . But knowing the
justice of their cause they may occasionally have been
impatient with those who have not instantly and actively
recognised it. As regards America, for instance, some of us
may have been amazed that the invasion of Belgium and
the atrocities following upon that wanton act should have
called forth no official protest. Dr. WHITE makes no
excuse for this attitude of his country's government; indeed
he deplores it deeply and is anxious, both for practical and
sentimental reasons, that the States should come at once ||
into the open and join the Allies. Had I ever whispered a
quarter as much on the subject of America's policy as
Dr. WHITE has openly said here, I should have expected
hornets to buzz around my ears, but I shall now fearlessly
admit that I agree with every word he has written. Out

MR. GALsworthy has never been much in love with the
plain Englishman. He has often dealt him very shrewd
and cutting strokes. Perhaps he might plead that the
cruelty of deftly turning the knife in the wound cannot be
so very great, seeing that the victim (as happens rather
from the nature of the victim than the operation) makes no
general sign of taking notice. In The Little Man and other
Satires (HEINEMANN) he is at his old task again. “The
Little Man” is, in form of a playlet, a fantastic study of an
odd, insignificant, pathetic idealist who finds himself, by
accident of travel, left with a strange woman's baby, and
faces with equanimity the typhus with which it is thought
to be infected. Of course you can't state the case in such
bald terms without injustice to what is actually a very
amusing and effective trifle. But the meat of the book is in
the other satires, and chiefly “The Plain Man” and “The
Perfect One” (who is in fact merely the Superplain One).
For, though Mr. GALsworthy scarifies The Artist, The
Critic and The Writer, the studies of these latter types
seem rather academic essays in the gentle art of flaying
alive, whereas the others express the author's characteristic
attitude towards life. His hand has not lost its cunning,
but one feels that this is pre-eminently one of the many
books written before the War which the War throws out of
key. In the matter of the plain man, for instance, I doubt
if Mr. GALsworthy will ever again write or think of him in
quite the same way; so obviously and so often in these
grim months has this simple, substantial type done the
plain, hard, right thing in the heroically right way; and

Most ferventhy I hope that the title of Dr. J. WILLIAM
WHITE's book will not prevent it from achieving an enor-

when that obstacle has been overcome you will thank me
for recommending one of the most illuminating books that
the War has brought forth. Dr. WHITE is a modest man,
out to tell the truth. He is surprised at the success that
his earlier work on the same subject has already gained in
America, but there is really no reason for wonder that so
lucid a statement of his case should attract and convince
countless readers. As everyone knows, the strong point of
the Allies' cause is that they have been able to lay their
facts upon the table of the world, and to ask that they may
be judged wholly and solely by them. But knowing the
justice of their cause they may occasionally have been
impatient with those who have not instantly and actively
recognised it. As regards America, for instance, some of us
may have been amazed that the invasion of Belgium and
the atrocities following upon that wanton act should have
called forth no official protest. Dr. WHITE makes no
excuse for this attitude of his country's government; indeed
he deplores it deeply and is anxious, both for practical and
sentimental reasons, that the States should come at once
into the open and join the Allies. Had I ever whispered a

and again to be liars as reckless as they are futile, and the
efforts these mealy-mouthed apologists for German crimes
have been compelled to make in their attempts to explain
away BETHMANN-Hollweg's famous excursion into truth
leave me with such a feeling of nausea that for once I find
myself almost applauding MAXIMILIAN HARDEN when he
writes, “May the Teuton devil throttle those whiners
whose pleas for excuses make us ludicrous in these hours of
lofty experience.” What this “lofty experience" consists
of Dr. WHITE can tell you with proof irrefutable and
absolutely damning.
In Unofficial (SECKER) Mr. BoHUN LYNCH has chosen to
study, with more sympathy than public opinion would be
likely to sanction, that type whose world fell crashing
about it at the first shock of war—in a sense not easily
comprehended by the normal man. It is the type—artist,
philanthropist, philosopher, dilettante—to whom visions,
dreams, disquisitions, a perception and expression of beauty,
seemed the all-important pattern upon a rather tiresome,

or eight persons—the number varies—voyaging through
Scotland in two caravans; and by an ingenious device
they tell the tale in a series of letters addressed to the
mother of two of them, who is also a mutual friend of the
others. I liked especially the rather subtle way in which
this unseen personage is drawn in at the end to have her
share in the inevitable engagements. But you needn't
bother about the story, which is of the slightest. The
characters are the charm of the book; they all write ex-
ceedingly pleasant letters with a somewhat feminine tone
to them. They write, indeed, as clever women talk, delight-
fully, but a little too much. What seems most to have
impressed the publishers are the illustrations, “forty-eight
pages of them on a new plan.” All that this means is that
somebody had a camera, and that the resulting snap-shots
are reproduced. They are very good ones, even if the con-
tinued reappearance of the caravan as the central object
makes a little for monotony; but as for being on a new plan, |

that the most wholesome

to be found in the works
of JANE AUSTEN or in
their great honour they
have, even the least “likely" among them, so often
made them unflinchingly, like that young poet whose
ashes now lie in Lemnos. Mr. LYNCH has complicated
his hero's decision by involving him in an honourable
obligation to look after a helpless young wife deserted
by a blackguard husband. Naturally everyone diagnoses
the usual relationship, but the fact that it is so far a
| Quixotic tie (liable, no doubt, to dissolve into the other
kind) complicates the problem. The question lies: Is it
this man's duty to enlist or to protect the life he has so
far sheltered? The author is not the less true to life as
it is, in distinction to what it is supposed to be, in making
him determine on the final decision for enlistment in a
momentary mood of exaltation which has a swift reaction
of doubt. The play of motive and argument on a subtle
and fundamentally honest mind and temperament is very
skilfully suggested. It is the most real war novel I have
yet struck. -
Summer Friendships (GRANT RICHARDs) is an agreeable
specimen of the touring story, as inaugurated by the late
WILLIAM BLACK. I am not saying that Dorothy MUIR
has a pen as skilful as that of the chronicler of the Phaeton,
but she manages to make her travellers and their very mild
Cranford, I confess that I make an exception in favour of
this vigorous tale of BISMARCK and 1870. The author tells
us that the subject was long chosen and the book nearly
finished when the August of 1914 came to give it an
extraordinary aptness. “Richard DEHAN" really knows
her subject, and there are telling scenes in England, in
Germany and in France, especially in the zone of war. In
fact, the hero and heroine, whose duty it is to hold the
plot together, find it a task nearly, if not quite, too much
for them. But in any case, though the interest necessarily
centres round the giant figures of BISMARCK and MoDTRE,
who bulk huge through the book, I never forgot or wished
to forget the young Irishman, Patrick Breagh, and his
charming lady, Juliette, true daughter of France. How
they cross the path of the Man of Iron, and know him in
his strength and weakness, is fully told—much too well,
indeed, for me to spoil things by telling you about it.
The last nine months may possibly have given you an
unusual, even a professional, interest in wars in general
and the German way with them in particular; in which
event you will be as grateful as I am to “Richard DEHAN"
for a romance so well woven into a piece of living history.

I Don't know why I am in Ballybun.
I volunteered for the Front, and the
Government sent me at once as far to
the West as the Atlantic Ocean would
let it. Perhaps it had seen me shoot.
Cecilia thinks it had seen me in puttees.
It is true that with me they never stay
put, but in a good deep trench this would
never be noticed by the men behind.
You have guessed right; Cecilia and I
are related by marriage.
Cecilia is the most delightful woman
in the world, but I fear she disapproves
of Ballybun. She says it is so different
from dear Ealing. In Ealing, she says,
no lady going shopping would be
knocked down by a pig coming out of
a grocer's shop with a straw in his
mouth. . Perhaps the pigs in Ealing
do not chew straws. And Cecilia was
not knocked down. And didn't Mrs.
Quinn apologise in the most handsome
manner to the sweet foreign lady ?
This, Cecilia said, was the last straw,
as if an Englishwoman, even on the
Continent, could ever be a foreigner. It
has been no use explaining that people
from the next county are foreigners in
Ballybun. I fear this still rankles in
Cecilia's mind.
Cecilia thinks we are unpunctual
in the West of Ireland. We are not.
As I have tried to show her, Time,
according to the greatest philosophers,
has no real existence; and we are all
philosophers. If a meeting is sum-
moned for half-past three on Monday
“evening,” as long as the chairman is
in the chair by six on Wednesday no
one worries. That is why we all live
so long in the West. There was old
Patsy Gollogher of Lisnahinch Cross
Roads who remembered the Battle of
Waterloo and, if you gave him a glass
or two, the Spanish Armada; he simply
refused to die. They had to induce
him. Cecilia will not believe in Patsy
Gollogher.
us our house in six days and that we
did not get in for six weeks. But as I
pointed out to her the people here are
mystics, especially the working-men.
She said mystics would not paper half
the drawing-room wrong side up and
then leave the work for two days to go
to the races. I said they would.
The little house looked beautiful once
we had settled in. Perhaps they should
not have washed their paint-brushes in
the bath-room. They don't, it seems,
in Ealing. Fogarty, the paper-hanger
(he's not a real paper-hanger, of course,
but his cousin had a sore thumb), clean
forgot one strip of paper in the draw-
ing-room. He told me he had it all
wet on the back verandah, but Mulli-
It is true they promised
ate it on him. Cecilia says it is absurd
to think an able-bodied man like
Fogarty would allow so small a goat to
knock him down and then sit on him
eating wall-paper. It is no use ex-
plaining to her, but she regards Fogarty
as untruthful. It's a pity, as they
cannot match the paper owing to the
War, and it was the last strip. Still, it
was hardly Fogarty's fault, and with
the big screen in front of it no one
could tell it wasn't there.
Fogarty is an invaluable man and
can do anything. He has never any-
thing particular to do, and so I have
been sending him on errands chiefly to
the waterworks to implore them to
send our water up. Thanks to him a
trickle came through yesterday, but
someone else has it to-day. In the
intervals of water-finding Fogarty is
hanging the pictures for us. Fogarty
tells me—and he is always ready for a
little conversation—that all his family
are born water-finders. I wonder if
Cecilia will notice the marks of
Fogarty's boots on the top of the
piano. It was a wedding present. I
must give Fogarty a hint.
Lunch was late again to-day. Mary
Ellen had mislaid the leg of mutton,
Fogarty found it for her. That man is
a born finder. I told Fogarty to find a
good place in the hall for the hat-rack
and put it up. I then went in to
lunch. It was our first lunch together
in peace since the last painter went out.
I filled Cecilia a glass of wine and I was
just about to say, “At last, darling, we
have our peaceful little home to our-
selves, free of painters and plasterers
and paper-hangers and plumbers!”
when Mary Ellen burst in the door with
a shriek, “For the love of Heaven, Sir
and Ma'am, come quick, Fogarty has us
all drowned !”
I rushed into the hall, and my breath
was taken away by a jet of water
which swept from the end of the hall
into the road. Fogarty, it seems, had
driven the nail for the hat-rack into a
concealed water-pipe. He was trying
to stop the stream, which came down
one of his sleeves and out at the other,
with an ancient pocket-handkerchief,
muttering to console himself, “Look at
that now, and I only making a small
hole. Will nobody turn her off at the

THE passion for scoring off others is
in some persons deeply rooted. No
one held it in greater esteem than a late
friend, whom I will call Mr. Aberdeen,
because that was the place of his birth.
He was blessed with an impassive face,
which never betrayed the fun lurking
behind it, and his general demeanour
was so sedate and respectable that none
of his victims suspected mischief. He
played no practical jokes; he was the
soul of courtesy in his own walk of life;
but the very sight of anyone in the
position of an underling excited him to
a process which he himself might term
the elongation of the nether limb.
One of his favourite devices was
the adoption of exact but unfamiliar
periphrasis. Thus, needing Punch, he
would ask young bookstall clerks for
The London Charivari, and for years
before the sub-title was given up his
enquiry at evening was for The Globe
and Traveller. Recent journalistic
amalgamations afforded fresh chances
and he had the satisfaction of demanding
both The Daily News and Leader and
The Star and Echo before he passed
|. He would gravely ask a porter if he
thou ht that he could find him a taxi-
meter cab, or if there were facilities at
this or that terminus for sending a
message by the electric telegraph. Cab-
men he bewildered by the request for
change in “bronze,” and if they had
none it was his delight to convey the
question (like a boomerang) to the
nearest policeman, with whose Force
the phrase of course originated.

company his purchase of theatre tickets.

“But you have not yet told me how
you escaped, darling,” went on Emilia,
her voice sounding muffled and far
away owing to the position of her face
on Harold's breast.
“Simply enough,” he replied. “As
soon as the Commandant realised that
I was a stamp-collector my trials were
at an end. He said he could never con-
ceive of a genuine philatelist being
guilty of any other crime. And you,
dearest,” he asked tenderly, “how has
it been with you under the terrible
strain of my absence 2"
In return Emilia made him acquainted
with all that had happened, and when
she described the final scene in the
Brixton flat Harold was deeply moved.
Now that Steinart, Magda and the pet
snake were safely provided for he felt
that the last obstacle to their immediate
marriage was removed, and drew her
even closer to his breast as he told
her so. -
Emilia answered with a troubled
look. “You forget, dearest, that I am
practically a pauper, that Steinart's
Emporium, is in dissolution, and that
you are out of employment.” --
In the joy of their reunion Harold
had forgotten these points, and now in
utter despair he sat down heavily on
the tin trunk.
Suddenly his eyes sparkled, he
grasped a few dozens of the envelopes
scattered over the floor and exclaimed,
“My angel girl! We are saved' . We

to preserve these German stamps?
Why, every one of them is now obso-

longer! All stocks of stamps in the
post-offices were destroyed by order of
the Allies as they advanced to Berlin,
and the dealers are offering unheard-of
figures for the few specimens that
remain.”
There is little more left to add.
Harold and Emilia disposed of the
German Empire stamps for a princely
sum. Their marriage took place im-
mediately, and their lives, which had
been so troubled, flowed on together in
a happy dream of love.
It is at the close of a golden Summer

PUNCII, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON THE SPY-TRAIL.
VI.
Jimmy says that when his blood-
hound Faithful has picked up the trail
of a German spy he sometimes adopts
a ruse in order to approach his victim.
Jimmy says Faithful is a good ruser,
and he has often seen him scratching
his head—and his back—thinking hard.
Jimmy says Faithful thought of a
splendid way of coming up to a spy
under cover; it was like they did to
Macbeth with some laburnum woods,
only it wasn't woods, it was a wild
COW.
Jimmy says the wild cow had been
taking a walk all by itself, and when it
turned in at his gate he thought at first
that it had come to deliver the milk
itself because of the War. Jimmy says
the cow didn't seem to know what it
had come in for until it saw Faithful.
Jimmy says as soon as he saw the
way Faithful looked at the cow he
knew Faithful was going to use it for
a purpose, and that Faithful had got
some ruse up his sleeve.
Jimmy says they first started wag-
ging tails at one another. Jimmy says
the cow was a better wagger than his
bloodhound, because it could do fancy
loops, and it was all Faithful could do
to keep his end up. Jimmy says the
wild cow got a bit cocky over it, and
lifted up its stomach and coughed right
in Faithful's face. Jimmy says it was
awful, because you know what blood-
hounds can do with wild cows. They
just catch them by the nose and fasten
on there tight for ever, and in time the
wild cow dies of hunger, because it is
unable to browse with a bloodhound
like that ; and then the bloodhound
goes home just as if nothing had hap-
pened, and you say, “Where have you
been all this time 2"
But Faithful's training came to his
aid and helped him to deny himself the
nose-grip, Jimmy says, and he could
see Faithful bending the cow to work
his will.
Jimmy says Faithful's first rush made
the wild cow tilt up and down and
swing its bulk about just to show off
its agility. But it made no difference
to Faithful; he simply went behind
the kennel and began pulling himself
together until the cow had got over it.
Faithful just kept one eye round the
corner of the kennel biding his time.
Jimmy says the cow tried to throw its
head at Faithful, but it couldn't work
it loose enough, and then Faithful,
rushing round, made a fearful grab at
the cow's ankle and drove it right back
into the corner of the garden.
Jimmy says it made the cow get
cabbage and began wagging its ears
and working its lower jaw from side to
side at Faithful, like you do when you
want to mesmerise anyone. But it
was no good, so the cow sounded the
horn for Faithful to get out of the way
and made a fearful plunge; Faithful
hurled himself to one side and gave a
bay that shook the cow to its core, and
the cow took a standing jump right
through the hedge into the next
garden.
Jimmy says the cow went mad when
it got into the next garden; it began
swinging its head loose and looping
the loop over flower-beds and things.
Jimmy says it was because it felt so
relieved ; but, when it had straightened
itself out again and saw Faithful
making a bee-line for it, it pushed up
its tail in the air as high as it could get
it, just to say good-bye, and then went
right through another hedge into a
garden where a man was watering
seeds. Jimmy wondered whether this
was the spy Faithful was using the
cow for.
Jimmy says the man wasn't thinking
of bloodhounds and wild cows, and all
he could do at first was to open his
mouth wide and pour the water from
the watering-can into one of his slip-
pers. Jimmy says it took the man
nearly half a minute to throw the
watering-can at the wild cow, and then
he only thought of it because his slip-
per wouldn't hold any more water and
the wild cow was trying to walk the
tight rope over some black cotton he
had put down to keep the sparrows off
his peas.
Jimmy says the cow began to look
unstrung. It's awful to think a blood-
hound is tracking you down, Jimmy
says. It's like a rabbit when a stoat
is after it ; no matter how far it runs
there the stoat is coming along after it
three fields away and so the rabbit just
lies down and squeals. Jimmy says
the cow kept looking for a place to lie
down and squeal in, but the man would
keep on bothering it with flower-pots,
so the cow wormed its way through
another hedge. Jimmy says the man
said it was a horned cow and he gave
Faithful leave to eat it alive.
Jimmy knew the boy in the next
garden, and when the boy saw the cow
and Jimmy and Faithful he sat down
and laughed nearly as much as Jimmy
did. You see the boy's father and
mother had gone out, and they had the
cow all to themselves, and it was a nice
bright day and there was a wall on the
other side of the garden.
Jimmy says they played with the
cow, whilst Faithful, who had cast aside
all disguise, flung himself openly on
Jimmy says the boy knew all about
wild cows; you do it with a lasso
made out of the clothes-line, and you
don't want a saddle because you don't
stay on long enough.
Jimmy says the man who owned the
cow easily tracked it down because so
many people kept showing the cow's
imprints to him.
Jimmy says when the cow saw the
man it ran up to him and asked him
to take care of it.
Jimmy says they were just going to
ask the man what the cow's name was
when they heard the deep baying of
Jimmy's bloodhound. Jimmy says he
always feels excited when his blood-
hound has worked out his ruse; it's
like when you work out a problem in
arithmetic and then look at the answer
at the end of the book—it's the sur-
prise, Jimmy says. -
Jimmy says they soon found the
traces of Faithful's deadly work; they
were in the coalhouse and it was the
cook. They found her with her nose
pressed against a lump of coal. When
the cook came to she said that all she
remembered was going to fetch some
coal to make up the fire, and she had
just shovelled up a nice piece and was
carrying it out when it put up its wet
nose against her face and barked at
her.
Jimmy says you should never try to
shovel up bloodhounds; it only makes
them worse.
Jimmy asked the boy if he knew the
cook must be a German, and then
the boy told him. He said his father
and mother had gone to the War Office
to get them to send a regiment of
soldiers to intern the cook because she
was a German, but she had been born
in Ireland.
Jimmy soon found his bloodhound;
they could hear him tracking for more
spies in the larder, and when they got
to him he was searching a cold rice
pudding. -

I'M so NERVoUs ABOUT THE CHILDREN PLAYING WITH IT."

but we do so without prejudice and
accepting no personal responsibility in
the matter.” And a private was heard
to ask amidst all the bustle, “I say, Len,
is it all correct about this gas they're
talking of 2" Of one thing I was
persuaded as I set about waking up
thoroughly ; wherever I was and who-
ever I might be, the leading topic of
the moment was undoubtedly gas. All
else was a mélée of men gagging them-
selves and each other with their hands
and apparently working the bolts of
their rifles in rapid fire with their feet.
Besides the personal precautions,
there were also a hundred things to be
done and a hundred men to do them.
The darkness was no obstacle, efficiency
was everywhere. In less than no time
the man with the ammonia pump had
sprayed the parapets and all things
tangible with his powerful lotion, and
had got upwards of a pint of it down
the neck of his section commander,
with whom, by a curious coincidence,
he had not been on speaking terms
during the previous day. Within about
the same time our Company Sergeant-
Major had “crimed” seven privates for
breathing in through the nose and out
as directed, in through the mouth and
out through the nose. It is said that
our Adjutant was overheard shouting
thickly through his own apparatus,
“Fix . . . respirators! One: one, two.”
I believe that one of the anti-gas-bomb
party was so rapid in throwing the
bombs out that his colleague and
assistant had no time to find, much
less fix, the fuses, and I can speak from
bitter experience of the activity of the
man with the flares, whose apparatus
is locally known as the joy pistol. He
operated so close to me on this occasion
that I'll swear I felt one of those rowdy
stars pass through one of my ears and
out through the other. Only one man
remained idle, our quaint sanitary man.
Hanging at the Sergeant-Major's heels
he kept imploring him, with pathetic
insistence, “Wot bin I to do, Mister?”
The only other details calling for
notice are the case of the excited cor-
poral who found, after it was all over,
that he had eaten the bulk of the medi-
cated cotton-waste in his respirator;
the “old soldier” who was caught
sleeping light and spent the period of
action searching for his boots; the
curious invisibility of the gas; and the
remarkable fact that the wind was in
the wrong direction ; and the unsatis-
|
machine-gun officer, who informed all
inquirers that he wasn't going to fire
his old machine-gun until he saw
something to fire at. -
Charles, whatever the sceptics may
say, it was a magnificent to-do and
an overwhelming victory. Don't you
believe anything to the contrary; for
the ten who pooh-pooh the idea a
hundred will confirm the fact of gas and
will tell you exactly what it feels and
tastes like. The further we get from
the event the more precise the details
of it become in the correspondence of
my platoon. Men who were once
sceptical themselves have since recalled
elaborate and convincing details of black
clouds and pungent smells. You must
not share or even sympathise with the
contempt of one incorrigible in my
platoon who, as soon as the rapid fire
ceased, was heard to call over the
parapet in that peculiarly raucous and
penetrating voice of his, “Put another
shilling in the meter, Allemand!" If it
is indeed admitted that that original
sentry is notoriously imprudent in his
consumption of the Tinned Meat and
Vegetable Ration and had, that very
evening, excelled all his own previous
efforts with the rich gravy, what on

ceived.
Disillusion came with very
first legislative proposal of new
Government. HoME SECRE-
TARY (Sir John SIMON, vice
McKENNA, gone to Treasury)
moved for leave to introduce
Bill suspending statute which
requires Members newly ap-
pointed to places of profit under =
the Crown to submit them-
selves for re-election. Pleading
urgency of case in view of
desirability of new Ministers
getting immediately to their
task of grappling with necessi-
ties created by War, he asked
House to pass the Bill through
all its stages at current sitting.
Now or never for the new
Opposition. Inchoate in form,
lacking a leader, it would by
a moment's hesitation have lost its
opportunity. The Coalition Govern-
ment would have enjoyed privilege
secured for its predecessor by habit of

ing from obstructing measures recom-
mended in interests of public service.
As occasionally happens at great
crises, with the striking of the Hour the

It was Mr. GINNELL |
Rising from bench below Gangway,
where on a famous occasion he held
the Speaker-nominate at bay for half-
an-hour by Westminster clock, he de-
nounced the Bill as an affront to the

When official list of re-constructed

The
buoyant, occasionally turbu-
lent, tirelessly active, still
young Minister, who by sheer
merit has won his way to
front rank of British states-
men, is to-day Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster, cus-
todian of an annual revenue
slightly exceeding £100,000,
administered by a staff of less
than a score—including, it is
true, a Coroner.
There is about the arrange-
ment something that recalls
the deportation of NAPOLEON
to Elba. “The Duchy,” as it
is called for short, is a sort of
Chelsea Hospital for states-

blished a claim upon their

active career John BRIGHT

IN his series of tableaur parlants
Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPs conducts us on
a kind of Rundreise, or circular tour.
Starting from Hell and returning to

world (Heaven, in this case). The

period of the War. His claim had been
advanced in the following words:–
“If any deem that I too lightly speak
In such assembly, and appear to jest,
Remember, in losing humour we lose all;
The thought provokes a spiritual sweat.”
So now we know where the Spirit of
Comedy comes from. For the humour
of Hell is apparently cosmopolitan and
not merely Germanic.” One catches a
hint in it of the manner of our own
censorship. Thus:
“Rumour. I give this as report, though
unconfirmed. -

But hold myself no way responsible.”
I don't know Satan really well, in a
personal sense, and so cannot say
whether Mr. MARTIN HARVEY was a
good imitation of him. But I gather
that the Master of Hell wears fewer
clothes than his subordinates and talks
enormously louder than anybody else.
His long pointed wings—faintly sug-
gestive of a butterfly existence –
afforded good cover when used as an
umbrella to keep out the searchlight
of Heaven. For the rest, the author
made a brave show with his arch-devil,
though perhaps a little conscious of
the literary effort that was asked of him
in view of the fact that MILTON had
already passed that way.
The play, as always with Mr.
STEPHEN PHILLIPs' work, con-
tained some great lines, and the
actors, with one or two ex-
ceptions, did justice both to
rhythm and rhetoric. Best, per-
haps, was the passage, finely
delivered by Mr. Fisher WHITE,
in which the Belgian General,
clamorous for revenge, rehearses
the wrongs of his country. Herr
Weiss, Director of the Official
German Press Bureau, was almost
the only alien enemy who suc-

provincial in the matter of these ac-
cessories. -
I cannot close without warning my
friends to take their respirators with
them when they go to view Armageddon,
for there is an asphyxiating shell (three.
inch and French) which penetrates the
German Headquarters and reduces its
occupants to a condition of permanent
coma (painless, you will be glad to
hear), in which they preserve the atti-
tude of the moment; and its fumes
achieve the object of all dramatic art,
which is to get across the footlights.
O. S.
“THE ANGEL IN THE House.”
WHAT ought a critic to do when he
finds by the continuous ripple of
laughter throughout the performance
that a play is obviously more attrac-
tive to other people than to himself?
First, perhaps, to examine the condition
of his liver; and next, if he finds
nothing amiss there, to ask himself,
like the fox-terrier in the advertisement,
“What is it that Master likes so
much 2" Messrs. EDEN PHILLPotts
and MACDONALD HASTINGs, the authors
of the new comedy at the Savoy, owe
a good deal of their success, I fancy, to
the all-round excellence of the cast, the
skill of the “producer,” and the bright-
ness of the First Act. We are intro-
fine old English country house. Sir
I'upert Bindloss, Baronet and widower,
is one of those benevolent and slightly
eccentric old gentlemen whom Mr.
HolmAN CLARK plays so well. His
household consists of two charming
daughters (Miss WERA CobURN and Miss
MARY GLYNNE), their fiancés, and their
chaperon, Lady Sarel. But it is pre-
sently increased by the Hon. Hyacinth
Petavel, son of an old flame of Sir
Rupert's, and commended by his mother
in a letter written in articulo mortis as
“an angel in any house.” Preceded
by a quantity of luggage, including a
parrot, and accompanied by three lap-
dogs, Hyacinth arrives. He proves to
be “a mother's darling" of the most
pestilential variety—selfish, hypochon-
driacal and opinionated—and at once
shows his intention of taking command
of the family.
In the Second Act, a fortnight later,
we find him fully installed as domestic
tyrant, with all the household, save the
two young men, at his feet. Sir Rupert
has acquiesced in the alteration of his
meals, the disfigurement of his garden
by “topiary" monstrosities, the keeping
up of gigantic fires in August, and the
banishment of his family portraits and
Greek busts in favour of Futurist pro-
ductions, on which Hyacinth lectures
at interminable length. He even per-
Eugenics and the “unborn" it is their
duty to break off their engagements
and exchange lovers. This is the last
straw. The young men plan revenge.
The Third Act finds all the party
picnicking at the Temple of Eros on
an island in the lake. The lovers
arrange that Hyacinth and Lady Sarel
shall be left stranded as night falls,
reckoning that the “angel's" suscepti-
bility to cold and Lady Sarel's obvious
penchant for him will bring them to-
gether. So it falls out. A capital scene,
in the course of which Hyacinth con-
sents to borrow her ladyship's flannel-
petticoat, ends in his proposing mar-
riage on account of her “beautiful
temperature.” Lady TREE gives an
admirable portrait of the amorous
widow, and Mr. IRVING is absolutely
lifelike—in the Second Act I found
him almost too lifelike—as the bore.
The play would be improved if it were
taken a little more quickly, and if the
“angel's" speeches were slightly cur-
tailed. Some of the “eugenic” jocosities
could perhaps be spared with advantage,
though I am bound to say that the
audience seemed to enjoy them. L.

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXIII.
(From John Brown, of London.)
SIR, This letter is intended for your benefit, and, that
being so, I ought not, perhaps, to write it. However, you
will never receive it—you are too well guarded for that, and
I haven't the least doubt that everything calculated to
upset your preconceived opinions and to set up the truth in
their place will be kept away from you with the utmost
rigour. My conscience is therefore clear; I run no risk of
doing good to the alien arch-enemy, and can freely write
this letter to relieve my own feelings. And even if by
some outside chance it should come before your august
eyes and penetrate into your heroic mind it would merely
make you angry and thus disturb such judgment as is left
to you after ten months of war.
In the first place I strongly advise you not to believe
implicitly every rumour that may come to you as to the
attitude of the British people in regard to this War. We
are a peaceable folk and we don't enjoy being at war—
that much may readily be granted. But we realise that it
is our duty, being in this quarrel, so to bear it that the
opposer (yourself) may beware of us. We rejoice certainly
in the high courage and gallant bearing of our troops and
we rejoice equally in the unquenchable humour and cheer-
fulness with which they support death and wounds and
suffering. It is our business as a nation to see to it that
they shall not have fought in vain and that the great cause
of liberty shall have been maintained unimpaired against
your brutal assaults. This duty, hard and painful as it is,
we are firmly determined to carry through, whatever the
cost may be to us.
But you may answer that you read occasional numbers
of The Daily Gloom, and that you gather from these a very
different impression. The Daily Gloom has repeatedly
declared and keeps on declaring that our people have hardly
realised that a war is going on. We are, it appears, sunk
in sloth, and our young men, far from having made an un-
paralleled effort, are, most of them, waiting timidly at home
until they shall be fetched and compelled to don khaki and
go into the trenches. They are, in fact, slackers and
shirkers, and it is useless for the recruiting-sergeants to din
their duty into their ears, for they will only yield to com-
pulsion and not to persuasion. As for the working men,
who are the backbone of the nation, they all prefer drink.
and holidays to work, and they have a special dislike for the
making of munitions. They must be nagged and ragged
into doing what they ought to do. The inhabitants of
England generally, not having seen their cathedrals and
their homes destroyed by big guns, are by no means suffi-
ciently Cimmerian to please the critic. In one column they
are told to change their minds and lengthen their faces and
to take example by the Germans, who in every department
of life—at least, so I infer—show a discipline and a despon-
dency worthy both of the highest praise and of our slavish
imitation. Yet in another column of the same organ some
neutral observer assures us that the German people, having
been hypnotised by the lies they have learnt to believe, are
serenely happy and quite confident; that they do not
despond at all, that their food is ample and that their
Professors still discourse on the mild virtues of Germany
and the intolerable wickedness of other nations. What are
we to believe?
Well, the fact is, of course, that our beloved Daily Gloom
does not really want us to despair quite so despairingly as
the tone of its articles might imply. It has a policy to
once secured we shall all go to ruin. And so it writes
jeremiads and summons to its aid Bishops and Arch-
deacons and University dons and angry puzzled patriots.
As to the merits of that policy I say nothing here. What
I wish to make clear to you is that this attitude of des-
pondency is put on. We do realise the seriousness of the
struggle and the strength of our foe as well as his
murderous lack of scruple, and while we are not entirely
overwhelmed and crushed by the prospect we are still
sternly determined to do all that lies in our power to crush
you and to overwhelm your cause.
Yours faithfully, John BRown.

One is tempted here, as in all these photographically
realistic novels, to wonder how much is autobiography.
Mr. BEREsford indeed deliberately provokes this temptation
by making his hero a novelist, and (rather less excusably)
by causing The Morning Post to review Jacob's first novel
in precisely the words of the notice of the author's own
previous work in that journal, printed here by Messrs.
SIDGwick AND JAckson in their advertisement pages. As
a reviewer I am by no means certain that I approve of this

If many more authors take to telling their tales in

of synopsis, on the you-can-start-now system. For example,
in The Invisible Event, you need a little previous knowledge
of the circumstances to understand why Betty is discovered

Of course, however, if you are familiar with the previous
books of Mr. J. D. BERESFORD (as you should be by now, if
you are concerned for the best in modern fiction), you will
remember that Jacob had just asked Betty to manage and
share his life—and this though there was a discarded but
undivorced Mrs. Jacob still in the background. The present
volume, which is the last of the Jacob Stahl trilogy, tells
you what Betty did, and what sort of a thing she and Jacob

A Tragedy of the Artistic Temperament.
WHEN Margot Davenish proved herself unworthy of a
poet's homage by her hilarious reception of a proposal of
marriage framed in deathless anapaests, Reggie Outhwaite
found himself in a quandary. Margot's bright eyes had
inspired the rapturous abandon of the early pages of his
Purple Passionings, and without her he despaired of com-
pleting the volume. As a lover scorned, he realised that
tradition called upon him to eschew the society of women;
as a writer of erotic verse, he felt that his Muse stood
urgently in need of a lady-help.
It was at this crisis that Esmeralda came into his life.
She lived at the corner of Bath Street behind the plate-
glass of “Sidonie, Robes et Modes,” and her mission was
to demonstrate the ethereal perfection of Madame Sidonie's
creations. Coarser natures lacking the artistic tempera-
ment called her a dummy, but at the first glance Reggie
knew that at last his prayers had been answered. That
night he threw off two sonnets and a virelai before going
to bed to dream of her.
Esmeralda was not one of those shameless hussies whose
outrageous déshabillé crimsons the young man's cheek.
She was a very superior article, fashioned probably in Paris
and obviously by an artist. No mere pedestal surmounted
by a head and shoulders; as far as the eye could see she
was quite all there. She sat in an armchair with one knee
crossed discreetly over the other and one dear little mouse
of a shoe daintily tip-tilted; toying with her parasol and
smiling mysteriously. For Reggie her smile was fraught
with all the suggestive allurement of the Monna Lisa.
Moreover, in his infatuation, he deemed her eyes a wondrous
passion-grey, and grey eyes had always done anything
For weeks Reggie haunted the neighbourhood of “Sidonie,
Robes et Modes.” He did not care to stand in open adora-
tion, for the window contained other things besides Es-
meralda, and he was a man as well as a poet. He would
pace slowly past his divinity; then, turning suddenly as if
he had remembered something, as slowly retrace his steps.
Some days he covered miles in this way. One morning a
damsel in black silk draperies whose bearing would have
graced a Princess of the Blood Royal moved Esmeralda.
farther back into the shop, fearing doubtless that her ears
would come unstuck under his ardent glances. It was
then that Reggie decided that he must buy Esmeralda.
With her companionship to inspire his pen he would not
disappoint posterity. But the artistic temperament never
|shines amid the sordid chafferings of the market-place and
the thought of the Princess's icy scorn daunted him.
To brace himself for the encounter he took a month's
rest at the seaside. Returning full of courage he at once
made his way to Bath Street in such a state of elation.
that blank verse positively streamed from his lips. But a
cruel shock awaited him. Where formerly had gleamed
the tender message, “Sidonie, Robes et Modes,” there now
flaunted the vulgar inscription, “I. Isaacstein, Gents' and,
Boys' Outfitter.” Behind the plate-glass there smirked a
wax figure clad in an Eton suit. An icy fear gripped at his
heart as he stumbled towards the door. What if this
upstart tailor proved ignorant of Madame Sidonie's new:
address' Then, as his gaze fell again on the smirking lad,
the truth burst upon him in all its horror, and he sank.
heavily to the pavement. From out that waxen countenance
there smiled a pair of wondrous passion-grey eyes | The
incomparable Esmeralda had been melted down to fit an
Eton jacket ! : -
Reggie is now a respectable member of society, for in
that awful moment the last spark of his poetic fire flickered
out for ever. But he never despairs. Often of a Spring
evening, when the throstle is calling to his mate and the
very air is palpitating with passion, he will sharpen his
pencil and bear his swelling heart out into the garden,
there to compose an elegy worthy of his lost goddess. His
progress is very slow. Hour after hour the pages of his
rhyming dictionary rustle beneath his questing thumb, but
not yet has he achieved an opening couplet to satisfy his
fastidious soul. At present his choice is wavering between
“O Esmeralda, silent is my lute ;
d I cannot bear thee in an Eton suit ’’;
a. In - *
“I weep for Esmeralda O my dolour
For Esmeralda in an Eton collar !”
He feels both these couplets possess the true poetic touch,
the greatness of simplicity; but he cannot make up his
mind which of them more accurately interprets the tender
melancholy of his spirit.

ham Palace and had audiences of His Majesty. The King to-day

A NEW REIGN OF TERROR.
The other week I had the privilege
of laying before the world (or, to be
more precise, the threepenny world)
a choice example of unambiguous
letter-writing on the part of a little
Polish tailor. There now arrives the
very latest specimen of the Baboo skill
in this art; and, as very often happens,
the writer is an official connected with
a railway. The classic example of
Baboo railway correspondence is the
frantic telegram about the tiger that
was consuming the staff. In the
following document we find similar
trouble, but the tiger is now a man.
An ironical touch to the affair is
added by the circumstance that the
unfortunate officer in charge who tells
the tale had taken command of the as-
saulted station only that morning.
But here is the letter:—
- “16th Feb. 1915.
“Further to my code CP of date I
hasten to inform you that this noon

and got inside the office. I tried every

being assaulted by one who I under-

this particular individual rushed inside
carrying the door-bar, which he broke
off, and used criminal force on me and
the booking clerk. He threatened both
of us of bodily harm, swearing that he
will bring down the whole station
apparently for no reason.

alive could have put up with, and but
for the timidity of the staff I would have

that prevented me from running him

THE WATCH DOGS.
xxi. '
MY DEAR CHARLEs, Perhaps it is
that I have not been quite myself lately;
at any rate, whatever the inner cause,
a change has come over me and I am
no longer able to suffer fools gladly.
Between ourselves, I have conceived
the utmost dislike for these Germans,
a dislike which is all the more remark-
able since I happen to be fighting some
of them at the moment, and I'm sure
that to fight against people is to get to
knew them better and to appreciate all
their good points. However insuffi-
cient my data may seem to be, I am
organised sulk, refusing to fire for hours
at a time. Nothing is more trying
than a silent foe; he's bad enough
when he's shooting, but when he's
quiet he's very likely preparing some-
thing more dreadful, possibly coming
across to you in the dark to stick a
piece of cold steel into you. And so
we get him thoroughly nervous and
craning much too far over the parapet,
and then we suddenly recover our good
º: and burst into a very rapid fire
of our own invention, to a merry sort of
syncopated beat.
Another way torpunish-Germany (by
human agency) is to take a couple of
bility give them a sinister air of
mysterious import. To us these
signals mean nothing; to the enemy
they suggest, I hope, the very worst, in
whatever shape their guilty minds may
conceive it.
Our best effort was quite unin-
tentional. A subaltern (whom I will
not advertise by name, since goodness
knows what he'd be doing next if I
did) came into possession of a new
kind of automatic pistol; he is always
coming into possession of -a new kind
of something or other, and must always
try it forth with. In the absence of .
available targets upon which we could
see the hits, he had the original idea
convinced that these Teuton
fellows are quite impossible,
their manner atrocious and their
sense of humour nil. I surmise
that at their officers' mess they
overeat themselves methodically
four times a day, making nasty
noises. I suspect them of hav-
ing very ostentatious baths in
the morning, at which they are
offensively hearty, and yet really,
if the truth were known, only
wash the parts that show. I
can picture them talking exclu-
sively about themselves, shout-
ing down each other and putting
such a mixture of superior
virtue and patronizing joviality
into their morning greetings
that the genial and kindly
“Gott strafe England” becomes
little more than a sullen menace
to the addressee. And if they
ever do stumble upon a joke, I
am quite certain they repeat it
ad nauseam and end by quarrel-
ling about its inner meaning.
All this I have gathered from
dozen empty tins, fill them half-full
Voice of Envy. “GARN 'E AIN'T No REAL BANTAM They-
JEST DRESSED 'IM UP TO KID BLOKES wot FINK THEY 'RE
Too LITTLE TO Join."
of proceeding down the sap
which runs out in front of our
parapet, and shooting from
there at the lonely tree in the
middle of the-beyond. He was
followed by eight other subal-
terns, who were by no means
prepared to admit the superi-
ority of this pistol, for all its
newness, over their own weap-
ons in the matter of speed. I
do not include in the official
starters either D'Arcy or the
machine-gun officer who dragged
out a maxim to set the pace.
D'Arcy's revolver has all the
distinction of being an heirloom
and all the disadvantages of
capricious senility. It is at
present on strike, but he refused
to be left out of the competition
and turned up with a hand-
grenade to provide, as he said,
the comic relief . . It was a
good start, and for sheer rap-
idity easily surpassed anything
in this or any other war. We
were so pleased with the affair
the noises they make behind
their parapet, and the way they shoot
or don't shoot at us. Possibly there is
one little group of better men in the
middle, by the ruined farm-house, whose
sympathies are all with us and who
shoot at us only because they must
shoot at something, being at war,
and cannot shoot at their own people
because it would crick their necks.
Having been driven to this opinion
of the enemy I have been reluctantly
compelled to put a little frightfulness
into my personal campaign. With the
kind assistance of my men, I have
been able so to arrange our rifle fire in
my platoon that, at the busy time
when everybody who is anybody is
firing, every five rifles make a tolerable
imitation of a maxim, thus giving the
enemy the impression that we have
twelve machine guns per platoon, that
is one hundred and ninety-two to the
of stones, tie them together, leaving a
very long tail-piece of string, and send
the whole out, in the dark, to be placed
by an audacious and impudent patrol
amongst their barbed wire. You then
wait till the quiet time of the next day,
and when you think you've got your
enemy just dozing off you give the long
string (which your patrol brought back)
a series of spasmodic pulls. You can
always judge the extent of your success
by the mileage of artillery, of all weights
and diameters, which your simple device
sets in motion.
I can offer you another suggestion
for what it is worth. About once a
fortnight I send up a flare in broad
daylight before breakfast, and my
accomplices carry the signal along
the line by doing the same-at intervals.
In civilian life fireworks by day serve
no useful purpose; but in war time
from our own point of view that
we forgot all about the Germans and
their point of view. For a long time
after it, they were obviously irritable
and nervy. It didn't occur to us that
of course anyone would be moved by
so sudden, terrific and peculiar a noise,
which would have been bad enough if
it had come from our parapet, but must
have been intolerable when arising, as
it did, from what was supposed to be
the unoccupied midst of a well-known
and highly-respected turnip-field.
Anything annoys them now. Even
our singing God Save the King and
cheering loudly, with caps raised on
bayonets, on the occasion of His
Majesty's birthday, raised a storm of
indignation expressed in rifles, mortars
and Jack Johnsons. I cannot under-
stand their feelings; however German
I was myself I should regard such a
question as the enemy's own business

battalion. At other times we do an

WAITING FOR MORE.
WHEN I joined, the battalion was
1,500 strong. In those days I never
bothered to look for a job; jobs were
flung at me. “Somebody must take
the company digging,” said the Captain
to the junior Captain; “You heard
that?” said the junior Captain to the
senior Subaltern ; “Carry on,” said
the senior Subaltern to me; and for
three and a half hours the company
and I excavated heavily. After two
months of this my health broke down
so badly that I had to go before a
medical board. “Nothing less than
five bottles of champagne, five plays,
and five little suppers,” they reported,
“can save this officer's valuable life.”
So I took five days' leave . . . .
I came back as from another world,
and reported myself to my Captain
next morning in a dazed condition.
“Hallo,” he said; “had a good
time 2 ”
I could hardly trust myself to tell
him what a good time I had had.
“That's right. Well, somebody must
take the company digging.”
Isaluted and went out. It was all
just the same, but now I was glad
of it. I wanted to forget about my
five days' leave. The harder the work,
the less time to think.
The Orderly-Sergeant came up to
me as I reached the company lines.
“Company present, Sir,” he said.
“Present where?” I asked, looking
round the horizon. -
“Here, Sir," he said, indicating a
man next to him.
I opened and shut my eyes rapidly
several times; no more men appeared.
It was obviously a dream.
“Wake me up properly in an hour's
time,” I said, “and bring me some hot
water.”
“This is all the men for parade,” he
said patiently.
“This one one?”
“Yes, Sir.”
I turned to it. “Company, stand
easy,” I said, “while the Sergeant
explains.” -
The explanation was simple. Taking
advantage of my absence the War
Office had sent more than a thousand
men to France or some such foreign
place. There was only just enough
left for guards, fatigues and what nots.
Moreover I was now the senior Sub-
altern of the company.
“Well,” I said, “we must carry on.
What's the parade this morning 2
Digging?”
“Attack on a flagged position is down
in orders, Sir, but it's sure to be
cancelled.”
He's just the shape for it. Well, any-
how, we'd better get down to the
parade-ground. Company, slope arms.
Move to the left in ones—form ones.
By the centre, quick march.”
I got my man down safely, none of
the company falling out on the way,
and stood him at ease while I con-
sidered how to display him to the best
advantage. I was just maturing a
clever idea for misleading the Sergeant-
Major by trotting my man round and
round him several times with great
rapidity, when the Orderly-Sergeant
came back with the news that the
parade was off. -
“Then so am I,’” I said, and I went
back and reported to my Captain.
“I thought that there wouldn't be
much doing,” he said, “but you'd
better hang about a bit in case any-
thing turns up.”
"Can't I help you at all?”
“No, thanks; not at present.”
So I hung about. It was a sultry
day—the sort of day when doing nothing
makes you hotter than the most violent
exercise. After an hour I could bear it
no longer; I went back to the company
roon).
The Captain was just signing some-
thing.
* “Blotting-paper?” he said, looking
round at a junior Subaltern near him.
The junior Subaltern stretched out
his hand for the blotting-paper.
“Pardon me,” I said, stopping him
just in time. “You have been busy
all day; I have done nothing as yet.
This is my work.” And I handed the
Captain the blotting-paper,
The junior Subaltern nearly cried.
“It isn't fair,” he said. “The junior
Subaltern's always supposed to do all
the work. As it is I haven't had any-
thing to do for three days. At least,
except yesterday. And they only let
me take something across to the
orderly-room yesterday because it was
raining.”
I looked at him eagerly.
“Say that again,” I commanded.
“You took something across to the
orderly-room—right across the square?”
“Yes. You see, it was raining hard.”
“And then walked back again and
reported that you'd done it 2 Two
walks 2 " He nodded. “I say, 1

day x 2.
The Captain looked up.
“I shall want somebody to take this
across to the * x
The junior Subaltern was just a shade
too quick for me.
“Yes, Sir,” he said, snatching at it.
I followed him to the door.
“I must remind you that I am your
foot against the door just in time.
“Give me that paper.”
“Be a sportsman,” he pleaded.
“It isn't only that. What I feel is
that you are too young for a job of this
kind. We want a more experienced
hand.” I took the paper from him.
“There is a particular busy way of
walking across to the orderly-room
which it takes weeks to acquire. You
would probably stroll across as if you
were going to borrow a match, and
then the whole job would be wasted.
Now watch this.”
I strode briskly across the square,
the obviously official document flutter-
ing in my hand. A few subalterns
with nothing to do watched me envi-
ously. Outside the orderly-room door
I hesitated a moment, and then turned
round sharply and strode back again.
The junior Subaltern, mouth open,
waited for me to come up to him.
“By the way,” I said, tapping the
document in a business-like way, “is it
Monday or three pairs?” . .
“Who did 2" he said stupidly.
“Because, if it was Portsmouth,” I
went on, “it ought to have been en-
dorsed on the back.” I showed him
the back, nodded to him, and hurried
off to the orderly-room again. I handed
in the paper and stepped briskly back
to report to my Captain.

“Initiative,” I said to the junior
Subaltern, two minutes later, as I upset
the ink over the Captain's table, “initia-

greatly (I'm extremely sorry, Sir; let
me mop it up. Perhaps I'd better
write these lists out again, Sir, as I've

selected a suitable pen, “is to the sub-

High-spirited Special Constable (to suspicious character). “I-IF You D-Don't call. Y-Your B-BRUTE of F-I'LL RUN You IN 1."
FROM A MINE-SWEEPER IN

(Letter from Sub-Lieut. John Blundell,
R.N., to his Uncle, the Rev. J.
Blundell.)
- - - May 30, 1915.
H.M.S. , at Sea.
DEAR UNCLE,--I was very pleased
to get your letter this morning and to
hear that Aunt Fanny is recovering
from influenza, and that Cousin Dorothy
got second prize in Divinity. It was
most interesting to hear that Tabs had
two black kittens this time; I rather
thought that they would be grey, as
the last lot were white. I quite follow
your arguments about “Should clergy-
men fight?” As you say, the matter
is of the greatest importance, and
naturally The Times published your
letter.
You tell me that you gather from the
papers that the great silent Navy is
having a quiet time now, and you
ask me what we are doing. I wish
I knew myself, but as we only go
into port once a week to coal and
are not allowed to communicate with
the beach, I am rather ignorant
of its doings. No, I am sorry to say
I did not get the wild duck. It
Pool, and I got a pair of mittens (my
seventh pair) instead. We are, the
Scouts, and come last on the list.
There are five grades before us. The
luckiest devils are the harbour defence
flotillas, who get the fruit and fish.
|The next best off are the Coast Defence
Patrols, who get the fowls and their
so-called fresh eggs. The intermediate
grades, such as Grand Fleet, seagoing
flotillas, etc., get the general cargo, and
we, who are far from home, get the
frozen mutton, the imperishable corned
beef, the indestructible tinned salmon,
and the endurable woollen gear. The
things that we might reasonably hope
to find in our class, such as grouse
and gorgonzola, never pass beyond the
second grade.
As our boats are not sufficient to
carry all hands, the latest scheme is
to keep a large barrel of grease and
thick oil on the upper deck, and pre-
paratory to abandoning ship all men
are supposed to strip and smear them-
selves over with this stuff as a
protection against cold water. They
then, according to the latest Admiralty
circular letter, are permitted to leave
the ship. We had a false alarm the
other night, hitting a floating mine,
which didn't explode. A weird figure
deck afterwards, and it took us all
the middle watch to clear the oil and
grease off the ship doctor.
My last skipper has been having an
awfully good time in port since the
Great Blockade began, as a German
submarine kept on hovering about out-
side and they could not go to sea until
it had been dealt with by the T.B.D.'s.
It was known as the “Married Man's
Friend,” and they were quite sorry to
hear of its decease. I saw Jack the
other day. He is in one of the old battle-
ships, officially termed “Fleet-Leader”
(we call them “mine-crushers”), and
he says his only diversion is the con-
stant redrafting of his will so that each
member of the family shall bear a fair
burden of his debts. -
Charlie Farrel is in the mine-sweep-
ing brigade. He is now in his fourth
trawler, and is known as “Football
Charlie,” as he's always being blown
up. Rather bad luck on a fellow who
is +2 at golf and who regards all other
games (except fighting) as contemptible.
As you say in your letter, great
issues are at stake, and it must be
awfully exciting in England just now,
but it's very dull at sea, so I will clear
up this letter.
Your affectionate Nephew,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(Extracted FRoM THE DIARY of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, 7th of
June.—Attention just now centred on
Treasury Bench, where the lion of
Conservatism sits down with the lamb
of Liberalism, and that shrewd little
child, HENRY HERBERT, leads them.
The MEMBER For SARK has idea that
even more interesting is the figure on
Front Opposition Bench of the states-
man who by strange chance, after
many vicissitudes, comes to represent
that well-known agricultural hunting
district, the Wimbledon Division of
Surrey.
Forty-seven years ago HARRY CHAPLIN
entered the Commons as Member for
Mid-Lincolnshire. Held the seat for
twenty-eight years. Through period
approaching half a century has watched
slow changes of procedure and manner
that have revolutionised the House.
Whilst ever preserving the courtly man-
ner of his early generation, has tact-
fully adapted himself to circumstance.
For a while, between 1886 and 1900, he
found himself included in any creation
or reconstruction of Conservative
Governments that happened to be in
progress.
with last year of nineteenth century,
fitly closing with its calendar. In
conjectural talk about constitution of
Coalition Government, roaming over
probabilities and possibilities, his name
was never heard.
There remains vacancy in one post
unsalaried and, in the strict
sense of the word, unofficial.
There is no Leader of the
Opposition, for sufficient rea-
son that organised opposition
is non-existent. His Majesty's
Ministers still with us; for first
time in Parliamentary history
His Majesty's Opposition has
disappeared from the scene.
To man of CHAPLIN's consti-
tutional principles (a matter
of native instinct), this con-
dition of affairs fraught with
grave danger to the State.
Not lacking Members below
Gangway on both sides self-
comforted by assurance that
they could add fresh influence
to important position. Mr.
GINNELL, for example, last
week made bold but ineffec-
tive bid for it. On reflection
Member for Wimbledon Divi-
sion, with his long experience,
Ministerial career terminated
parties, came to conclusion that per-
haps no one would fill the office better
than himself.
Accordingly on first day of assembly
of House under direction of Coalition
HENRPCUS CHAPLINIUS
WIMBLEDONENSIS.
“To-NIGHT THE NoHLEST ROMAN OF THEM
ALL FILLED HIS PART WITH ADDED GRAVITY.”
Government he, rising from seat on
Front Opposition Bench in far-away
times occupied by his old friend and
master DISRAELI, of late in possession
of Bonar LAw, interposed with the
question Leader of Opposition is accus-
tomed to put to Ministers on such
Occa,Slons—
“What business does the Govern-
ment propose to take next week?”
Crowded House, quick to grasp the
situation, genially laughed and heartily
cheered.
To-night, the noblest Roman of them
all filled his part with added gravity.
Usual when a Minister moves Second
Reading of important Bill for Leader of
Opposition immediately to follow and
indicate line his party is prepared to
take. CHAPI.IN, preserving the non-
party but all-patriotic attitude assumed
by his immediate predecessor in office,
expressed the hope that the Bill would
be passed without a moment's delay.
In a well-disciplined force that should
have settled the matter. LEADER of
OPPosition has, however, not yet
had time to drill his men. Using
phrase in Parliamentary sense, he
cannot yet get them promptly to
“form fours '' on word of command.
Their natural instinct is to break out
in sixes and sevens. Thus it was to-
night. Long wrangle delayed progress
with a measure declared on highest
authority to be urgently needed for
safety of country and for protection of
gallant men who by thousands daily
sacrifice life and limb to preserve it.
Business done.-After acrid debate
Ministry of Munitions Bill passed
Second Reading without division.
Tuesday.—HANDEL RACHEL Booth
weeping at absence of Ex-CHANCELLOR
of THE ExchEQUER, would not be com-
forted. Anxiously enquired
about him yesterday. This
afternoon, observing his vacant
seat, HANDEL, nothing if not
musical, chanted the enquiry,
“Oh where and oh where has
my Celtic laddie gone?”
“My Right Hon. Friend,”
the PRIME MINISTER loftily
replied, “is either Minister of
Munitions or he is not Minister
of Munitions. If he is Minister
of Munitions he is not entitled
to sit here. If he is entitled
to sit here he is not Minister
of Munitions. As a matter of
fact he is not Minister of
Munitions as there is no such
office until the House passes
this Bill, and there is no such
person.”
Gibe of course unintentional.
But a little rough on hard-
working colleague that he
should be alluded to as the
his intimate acquaintance with
Parliamentary men and mat-
ters, modestly but justly con-
scious of possessing esteem

brought good news, supplementing an-
nouncement by important statement.
Another German submarine has been
sunk. After manner of British sailors,
foreign to habit of the enemy, her crew
of six officers and a score of men were
rescued and brought in as prisoners.
In course of WINstoN's reign at the
Admiralty no action of comparatively
minor importance was more heartily
or more unanimously applauded than
his insistence that men systematically
engaged in practices which PRINCE
ARTHUR to-day described as “mean,
cowardly and brutal,” ought not to be
placed upon equality of treatment with
other prisoners of war. The submarine
crews were accordingly isolated in their
internment. As everyone knows, the
KAISER retorted by taking thirty-nine
British officers, and subjecting them to
special privations, including solitary
confinement.
It happened earlier to-day that Lord
RoBERT CECIL was asked whether it
would not be well in view of proposal to
exchange invalid civil prisoners of war to
placate Germany by reconsidering ques-
tion of treatment of submarine crews.
“I think,” said the new UNDER-
would be a very unfortunate precedent
if this House allowed itself to be
blackmailed by the German Govern-
ment."
Loud cheer approved this noble sen-
timent. Equally loud applause, twenty
minutes later, greeted PRINCE ARTHUR's
announcement that the alleged black-
mailing had been successful. Neither
demonstration was so enthusiastic as
that which followed upon WINSTON's
original statement on the subject.
A concatenation of circumstances

THE TALE OF A TONIC.
WHEN my sister came up to town a
couple of months ago she commented
severely on my appearance. I was
lacking in “tone" and looked ten
years older than I ought to. When I
demurred and observed that I was all
right, and also that at my advanced age
the appearance of years lent dignity, she
grew annoyed. “You should take Malz-
wein. regularly,” she said. “George
has been taking it for the last month
and you wouldn't know him." (George
is my brother-in-law, a door-mat of a
man). When I remarked that I had
conscientious scruples about drinking
German wines, Jane became almost
angry. “‘Malzwein' isn't a wine, it's
a tonic made of malt and meat-juice
and caseine, and recommended by the
best doctors.” “Well, anyhow," I re-
plied, “‘Malzwein' must be of German
origin, and I don't like trading with an
alien enemy.” “Nonsense,” said Jane.
“The firm is now reconstructed—1
made sure of that by inquiry—all the
directors are English, and the tonic
is made in England. Besides, if it was
a German product, and you derived
advantage from it, you would be
spoiling the Egyptians." I forebore
to criticise the accuracy of Jane's
parallel, because argument with her is
generally ineffectual, and when she pro-
mised to send me a bottle I expressed
my gratitude with well-simulated effu-
sion. Two days later “Malzwein "
arrived at my flat. He was a formid-
able-looking object in a cardboard case,
with a quadrangular body and a lead-
paper capsule covering his head. I
placed him reverently on a shelf in my
bedroom with other bottles, and having
so to speak installed him in my phar-
macopoeia forgot all about him until
last week. It was on the night of the
hottest day of the year, and I awoke at
about 1.30 to be conscious of a sickly
smell-pervading the room. -
Zeppelins—poison bombs—asphyxi-
ating gases—such were the thoughts
that crowded into my mind. But the
night was still and my breathing was
unaffected. I jumped out of bed,
switched on the light, and became
aware of a gentle dripping sound from
the shelf in the corner. And then the
truth was revealed. “Malzwein "had
burst, and a dark treacly substance
was dripping down on to the floor.
Whether it was the malt that had
fermented with the heat, or the violence
of the meat juice, or the explosive
energy of the caseine I cannot say, but

Wednesday.—Making first appear-
ance in capacity of member of new
Government, PRINCE ARTHUR on rising
was greeted with general cheer. He
brought good news, supplementing an-
nouncement by important statement.
Another German submarine has been
sunk. After manner of British sailors,
foreign to habit of the enemy, her crew
of six officers and a score of men were
rescued and brought in as prisoners.
In course of WINSTON's reign at the
Admiralty no action of comparatively
minor importance was more heartily
or more unanimously applauded than
his insistence that men systematically
engaged in practices which PRINCE
ARTHUR to-day described as “mean,
cowardly and brutal,” ought not to be
placed upon equality of treatment with
other prisoners of war. The submarine
crews were accordingly isolated in their
internment. As everyone knows, the
KAISER retorted by taking thirty-nine
British officers, and subjecting them to
special privations, including solitary
confinement.
It happened earlier to-day that Lord
RoBERT CECII, was asked whether it
would not be well in view of proposal to
exchange invalid civil prisoners of war to
placate Germany by reconsidering ques-
tion of treatment of submarine crews.
“I think,” said the new UNDER-
would be a very unfortunate precedent
if this House allowed itself to be
blackmailed by the German Govern-
ment."
Loud cheer approved this noble sen-
timent. Equally loud applause, twenty
minutes later, greeted PRINCE ARTHUR's
announcement that the alleged black-
mailing had been successful. Neither
demonstration was so enthusiastic as
that which followed upon WINSTON's
original statement on the subject.

THE TALE OF A TONIC.
WHEN my sister came up to town a
couple of months ago she commented
severely on my appearance. I was
lacking in “tone" and looked ten
years older than I ought to. When I
demurred and observed that I was all
right, and also that at my advanced age
the appearance of years lent dignity, she
grew annoyed. “You should take Malz-
wein regularly,” she said. “George
has been taking it for the last month
and you wouldn't know him.” (George
is my brother-in-law, a door-mat of a
man). When I remarked that I had
conscientious scruples about drinking
German wines, Jane became almost
angry. “‘Malzwein' isn't a wine, it's
a tomic made of malt and meat-juice
and caseine, and recommended by the
best doctors.” “Well, anyhow,” I re-
plied, “‘Malzwein' must be of German
origin, and I don't like trading with an
alien enemy.” “Nonsense,” said Jane.
“The firm is now reconstructed—I
made sure of that by inquiry—all the
directors are English, and the tonic
is made in England. Besides, if it was
a German product, and you derived
advantage from it, you would be
spoiling the Egyptians.” I forebore
to criticise the accuracy of Jane's
parallel, because argument with her is
generally ineffectual, and when she pro-
mised to send me a bottle I expressed
my gratitude with well-simulated effu-
sion. Two days later “Malzwein "
arrived at my flat. He was a formid-
able-looking object in a cardboard case,
with a quadrangular body and a lead-
paper capsule covering his head. I
placed him reverently on a shelf in my
bedroom with other bottles, and having
so to speak installed him in my phar-
macopoeia forgot all about him until
last week. It was on the night of the
hottest day of the year, and fºr. at
about 1.30 to be conscious of a sickly
smell-pervading the room. - -
Zeppelins—poison bombs—asphyxi-
ating gases—such were the thoughts
that crowded into my mind. But the
night was still and my breathing was
unaffected. I jumped out of bed,
switched on the light, and became
aware of a gentle dripping sound from
the shelf in the corner. And then the
truth was revealed. “Malzwein "had
burst, and a dark treacly substance
was dripping down on to the floor.
Whether it was the malt that had
fermented with the heat, or the violence
of the meat juice, or the explosive
energy of the caseine I cannot say, but
anyhow “Malzwein's" head was blown.

AT THE PLAY.
“MARIE-ODILE."
It would be easy enough to be in-
delicate about the rather embarrassing
theme of Mr. KNoPLAUCH's play; for
(in crude terms) we have here the tale of
a little nunnery-novice who accepts at
| sight the advances of the first alien
enemy that comes her way, and bears
him a “war-baby.” But the author
disarms criticism by his transparent
idealisation of innocence. For you
are to understand that this novice has
been brought up in cloistered ignor-
ance of sexual facts; that she has
never even set eyes upon a man on
the right side of senility;...that she is left
alone in her convent, the sisterhood
having fled at the enemy's approach;
and that the first soldier who breaks
in upon her solitude. is himself vir-
ginal, and bears so strong a likeness
(thanks in part to, a brown-red wig
§". did not go very happily with
Mr. BASIL GILL's head) to St. MICHAEL
in the nunnery fresco that she at once
identifies him with that archangel. So
well is her innocence sustained that it
serenely survives the relations into
which they enter; nor could I even
find that the “miracle” of her child's
birth was ever associated in her mind
with those relations. This of course
means that we are asked to believe
a good deal, though not perhaps an
absolute breach of natural laws.
Mr. KNOBLAUch may have been in-
fluenced by memories of REINHARDT's
Miracle or DAVIDsoN's Ballad of a Nun,
but he has gone his own way. He has
not taken the obvious course of approv-
ing the revolt of natural instinct against
the hot-house atmosphere of the con-
vent; he simply shows us a type so
childlike that it is incapable of taint.
Perhaps any lover, not too boisterous,
might have served the author's purpose
passably well; but he makes sure of
his ground. His soldier, though he
loves and rides away (to the grave dis-
appointment of some of the audience
he failed to return and “make an
honest woman " of the novice —
having died, I hope, in action), is
no common corporal of Dragoons,
but goes far, by his attitude, to justify
the child's error in mistaking him
for St. MICHAEL. My only complaint
is that, having arranged these con-
ditions, quite arbitrarily exceptional,
the author should have taken occasion
to pronounce, through the medium
of the only enlightened nun in the
establishment, a tirade against the
stuffy secretiveness of the conventual
system. To assign this sort of blame
is to suggest (which he never intended

Miss MARIE LöHR, a charming figure
in her novice's dress, was the best pos-
sible choice for this virginal type. In
the Second Act, when she treats the
intruding soldiers like a lot of nice
large dogs, she was delightful in her
naïve simplicity. But the last Act
dragged heavily, and I grew very tired
of Sister St. Marie-Odile's enthusiasm
over her “little one" in the cradle
(an enthusiasm which I was not in
a position to endorse, as the infant
was concealed from me) and her

Mr. KNoBLAUCH might have made
more of this lady if he had allowed her
a touch of humanity, but here he went

had a difficult task in combining the
personalities of ST. MICHAEL and a
seducer of innocence, but he achieved
it with such discretion as the case
permitted. Mr. O. B. CLARENCE as

convent, made a lovable dotard. Mr.
HUBERT CARTER, most robust and

When I have added that the scene
was too pleasant for any need of
change I hope I have done my duty by
a play that is not likely, for all its

success it won in America at a time
when they could still treat the subject
of War in a spirit of detachment.

“GAMBLERs ALL.”
Sir George Langworthy, stockbroker,
had a holy horror of gambling in
every form—his own business, which
he described as “legitimate specula-
tion,” of course excepted." That being
. |80, it was unfortunate that he should
have selected as step-mother to his
grown-up son and daughter a young
lady with a congenital passion for play.
For a time the new Lady Langworthy
managed to conceal her proclivity
under the guise of an absorption in
music, and ascribed to concerts the time
she spent at the bridge-table. But a
run of bad luck proved her undoing.
She dared not tell her husband what
she owed and why she owed it. Her
brother, Harold Tempest, had the same
fitful fever running through his veins
and was already deeply in debt to
one Amos, a money-lender. In des-
| pair, and on the off-chance that her
luck would change, she went off to
a ſashionable gambling-hell, kept by
Major and - Mrs. Stocks (admirably
played by Mr. Lyston LYLE and Miss
FRANCEs WETHERALI). Here she met
John Leighton, a mysterious finan-
cial acquaintance of her husband, who
vainly endeavoured to dissuade her
from playing and offered to lend her
the money; and here, too, came Sir
George to fetch his wife from the
“musical evening” which he supposed
to be in progress.". He had barely dis-
covered his mistake when in marched
the police and arrested the whole party,
himself included. ' " tº .
The Third Act takes place at the
Langworthys' on Christmas Day. In
spite of her pleading Sir George refuses
to forgive his errant spouse, and goes off
to church in a most un-Christian state
of mind. Harold appears to reveal the
fact that to get money from old Amos
to pay his sister's debts he has put
Leighton's name on the back of a bill,
and that the forgery cannot be con-
cealed, as he has since learned—what
the experienced playgoer has guessed
for some time—that Leighton and Amos
are one and the same. And no sooner

with him. In the last Act Leighton is
visited in succession by all the prin-
cipal characters. Ruth Langworthy
(Sir George's daughter) tells him of her
love for Harold ; Sir George seeks his
advice as to the recovery of his wife's
affections; and Harold comes to con-
fess the forgery. At last Lady Lang-
worthy arrives, a pathetic little figure
in white, ready to surrender herself to
save her brother, though she admits
that her love still remains with her
husband. By this time, one suspects,
Leighton is heartily tired of the whole
family. At any rate he refuses the
sacrifice, packs Lady Langworthy off
with Sir George, and is last seen
lighting Harold's cigarette with the
forged bill.
The play, though a little old-fashioned
both in plot and presentment, is well
worth seeing, if only for the admirable
acting. Leighton, a sort of Robin Hood

character to make convincing, but Mr.

is possible, and in his scenes with Lady

minor characters are all adequately
filled, and a special word of praise is due
to Miss AGNES GLYNNE's performance

Mr. KNoBLAUch might have made
more of this lady if he had allowed her

it with such discretion as the case

a play that is not likely, for all its

success it won in America at a time
when they could still treat the subject
of War in a spirit of detachment.

“GAMBLERS ALL.”
Sir George Langworthy, stockbroker,
had a holy horror of gambling in
every form—his own business, which
he described as “legitimate specula-
tion," of course excepted. That being
. |80, it was unfortunate that he should
have selected as step-mother to his
grown-up son and daughter a young
lady with a congenital passion for play.
For a time the new Lady Langworthy
managed to conceal her proclivity
under the guise of an absorption in
music, and ascribed to concerts the time
she spent at the bridge-table. But a
run of bad luck proved her undoing.
She dared not tell her husband what
she owed and why she owed it. Her
brother, Harold Tempest, had the same
fitful fever running through his veins
and was already deeply in debt to
one Amos, a money-lender. In des-
|pair, and on the off-chance that her
luck would change, she went off to
a fashionable gambling - hell; kept by
Major ſand- Mrs. Stocks (admirably
played by Mr. LYSTON LYLE and Miss
FRANCEs WETHERALI). Here she met
John Leighton, a mysterious finan-
cial acquaintance of her husband, who
vainly endeavoured to dissuade her
from playing and offered to lend her
the money; and here, too, came Sir
George to fetch his wife from the
“musical evening” which he supposed
to be in progress.” He had barely dis-
covered his mistake when in marched
the police and arrested the whole party,
himself included. * * *,
The Third Act takes place at the
Langworthys' on Christmas Day. In
spite of her pleading Sir George refuses
to forgive his errant spouse, and goes off
to church in a most un-Christian state
of mind. Harold appears to reveal the
fact that to get money from old Amos
to pay his sister's debts he has put
Leighton's name on the back of a bill,
and that the forgery cannot be con-
cealed, as he has since learned—what
the experienced playgoer has guessed
for some time—that Leighton and Amos
are one and the same. And no sooner
has he gone than in walks Leighton

with him. In the last Act Leighton is
visited in succession by all the prin-
cipal characters. Ruth Langworthy
(Sir George's daughter) tells him of her
love for Harold; Sir George seeks his
advice as to the recovery of his wife's
affections; and Harold comes to con-
fess the forgery. At last Lady Lang-
worthy arrives, a pathetic little figure
in white, ready to surrender herself to
save her brother, though she admits
that her love still remains with her
husband. By this time, one suspects,
Leighton is heartily tired of the whole
family. At any rate he refuses the
sacrifice, packs Lady Langworthy off
with Sir George, and is last seen
; Harold's cigarette with the
forged bill.
The play, though a little old-fashioned
both in plot and presentment, is well
worth seeing, if only for the admirable
acting. Leighton, a sort of Robin Hood

character to make convincing, but Mr.

| “All war is terrible,” with the implication

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
I AM not quite sure that we haven't had enough of
white-hot War-books. All that can be said without
further, and as yet unavailable, evidence as to the causes
of the Great Tragedy has been said by many competent
men, and perhaps in fewer, though certainly not more
eloquent, words than by Sir GILBERT PARKER in The World
in the Crucible (MURRAY). And yet I think these forceful
vigorous pages will find many readers and drive home some
terrible convictions. Our new baronet's method of select
quotation from adversaries is open to the objection attach-
ing to all work of the sort, that it raises a certain kind of
doubt in the fair-minded reader.
No doubt one might find
possible heirs to an old uncle, but was supposed to have
lost his chance by marrying Rosamond, the betting being
strongly in favour of Emily, a female cousin, who had been
sent to look after the old man—in more senses than one.
Rosamond, finding herself stricken with mortal disease,
and knowing her death would leave the man she loves
without his little comforts, conceals her state, and, having
persuaded him into a protracted visit of ingratiation to the
will-maker, herself goes off abroad to die alone. She even
prepares a batch of cheery letters, to be sent at regular
intervals before and after her death, in order to keep the
husband from deserting his task. Naturally when, having
got the inheritance (and incidentally complicated matters
by falling in love with Emily), he finds out the truth, he
suffers as any woman who cared for him could surely have
some German book composed exclusively of hot-headed foreseen. My admiration for Miss HUNT's real cleverness
and very yellow utterances by IT
Englishmen, arranged as a
complete justification of this
“Preventive War,” or proving
guilty machinations on the
part of Albion the always per-
fidious. The best part of the
book is the summary of Ger-
man war crime, from the be-
ginning of August last to the
sinking of the Falaba; and
the significant reminder of the
fine chivalry with which Japan
and Russia conducted their
desperate struggle in the open-
ing years of the century. Said
the Japanese officers to Sir IAN
HAMILTON when he congratu-
lated them on the conduct of
their men : “We cannot afford
to have any people connected
with this army plundering or
illtreating the inhabitants of
the countries we traverse.”
While of the Russians he

isation of a defeat.” That is - -

iſ and stodgy merchants who have never done anything more
adventurous than miss the 9.45 up-train, yet, if there were
any talk of premature peace, would be clamouring to be
sent across the Channel in protest to the death.
I think I ought to warn you against prejudging The
House of Many Mirrors (STANLEY PAUL) by the picture on
the cover. The pale man with staring eyes who is holding
up a lamp depicts indeed the hero of the tale, but the actual
circumstances are not so melodramatic and creepy as their
presentation suggests. Indeed, though there is drama,
and grim drama, in Miss Violet HUNT's latest story, it is
not of the sensational kind. It is a story of a woman's
self-sacrifice, and as such has done much to strengthen me
in a previous conviction that self-sacrifice can be one of the
most terrible forms of selfishness. Consider the facts.

enough-to-do set, loved her husband, whom she supported

Tares (CHAPMAN AND HALL)
is the name that Mr. E.
TEMPLE THURSton has given
to a collection of short stories
and sketches. To save you
from a wholly unjustifiable
misapprehension, I should per-
ſhaps explain that the title is
simply taken from that of the
first story in the book, and has
no reference to the general
character of the whole.
“Tares” itself is a very well-
made and poignant little sketch
of certain events in Malines,
centred in the historic and
terrible pronouncement made
from the pulpit by a priest of
that town. Both here and
! elsewhere in this book Mr.
TEMPLE THURSTON has shown
himself able to write about
the War with passion and yet
with dignity and restraint. A
|º gift. There are other
- sketches, semi-satiric studies
of the female character divine, which are of more
unequal merit. Some of them, to be honest, hardly
seem quite to have earned their place. The best of the
humorous batch is the last, a story told with delightful
humour of an engaging idiot named Cuthbertson, who
thought he could box and was tempted into a Surreyside
ring—with disastrous consequences. I liked especially the
touch which depicts him, confronted with the peculiar
aroma of the dressing-room, and observing that it was “a
bit niffy"; though, as the author points out, “this was not
his usual method of speech. He was doing as the Romans
do in Rome.” Perhaps Mr. Thurston won't thank me for
saying that I place some of the contents of this modest
volume much above his better known novels. But I do.
A selection of the verses which have appeared on the
second page of Punch during the War has been published
by Messrs. CoNSTABLE at 1s. under the title War-Time.

OF GASES.
(To the enemy, who has given praise to Heaven for the
gift of poison.)
THERE is a gas your murderers make,
Not such as cleanly chokes the breath,
But dealing, just for cruelty's sake,
A long-drawn agony worse than death ;
Nor do you deem it odd
To vaunt its virtues as a gift from God.
And there's a gas, the “laughing” blend
(Although its humour seems remote);
They peg the patient's mouth and send
A soporific down his throat;
And, like a child at dawn, -
Waking, he finds a stump or two withdrawn.
Such is the gas your masters' art
Gives you to deaden pain and fear;
They take and prize your jaws apart
When gaping wide for Munich beer,
- Press-gag your mouth and nose,
And pump and pump till you are comatose.
Long draughts of strange and windy lies
Down your receptive maw you gulp,
Until the opiate seals your eyes
And Reason gets reduced to pulp;
So well the vapours work, -
Like hashish on your torpid friend, the Turk.
But, when you breathe pure air again,
Sore with a sense of something missed,
And want to know who drugged your brain,
I envy not the anaesthetist;
You'll raise a hideous rout
On finding all your wisdom-teeth are out. O. S
THE BOMBSTERS. -
Billy was gravely occupied in splashing vivid colours on
to the persons and dresses of fashion-plate ladies. To him
came Dickie and watched the process with a supercilious
all".
“Ladies don't have green cheeks,” he remarked.
“Tired of pink,” said Billy tersely. .
“I've thought of a game,” observed Dickie.
“I know: me be Germans an' you bay'net me with the
sword what Uncle Ted gave you. Don't want to play.”
“It isn't that; it's quite new.”
Dickie drew nearer.
“Wouldn't you like to play at being a bomb, while I
pretend to be a village?” he said persuasively. ,
“A English bomb?”
Dickie looked a little anxious.
“I meant you to be a German bomb, so as you wouldn't
have to hurt me much,” he admitted.
“You hurted me quite a lot with your sword,” said Billy.
“Only pretence hurt.”
“No, real hurt.” - --
“Well, will you play?” urged Dickie, waiving that point.
“You’ll have to climb a tree to be a bomb.”
Billy's eyes lit up.
“Why?” he asked.
“So's you can drop properly,” explained his brother.
“Come on.”
Billy surrendered, and the two ran into the garden and
made for the apple-tree.
“Yourself will drop you, of course,” Dickie replied with
some impatience. “I'm a village. I can't be in the
Zeppylin as well. The tree's the Zeppylin. First, you're the
German soldier what throws you an' then you're the bomb.”
“Can't I be English 2 ''
“No, you might kill me, an' then what would mother
say?”
“A village can't be killed.”
“Well, but I'm everything in the village. The postman,
an' the cocks an' hens, an' the doctor, an' they might be
killed. At least, they might if you could aim straight, but,
anyway, you can't be a English bomb,'cos they aren't dropped
'cept where it's all right, you know. On forts an' things.”
“You be a fort, then, an' I'll be a English soldier
what can aim,” persisted Billy.
“No, you mustn't. You've got to miss, an’ bounce, or
make a hole in a soft place,” said Dickie, firmly. “Or
you can be the village if you like, only I thought you'd
like to be allowed to climb the tree first.” -
“All right, then. May I make a loud bang?”
“Yes, a very loud one, if you like.”
So Dickie assisted his brother up the lower part of the
tree, and then left him to scramble along a forked branch.
“Now you're a German in a Zeppylin, an' I'm the
village,” said Dickie, proceeding to walk about below, playing
the doctor, the postman, cocks and hens, or a cottage, as the
fancy seized him. - -
Suddenly there was a rending of twigs, and Billy was on
the top of him. The impact was considerable, and they
both rolled over. The bang was forgotten.
“You s-shouldn't have hit me,” gasped Dickie, rubbing
his head while indignant tears stood in his eyes.
“C-couldn't h-help it,” sobbed Billy. “I wented by
accident.”
They sat looking at each other in the true enemy spirit
for some time. - - - -
“I don't like this game,” Billy sniffed resentfully.
“I’ll be the bomb, then,” decided Dickie, getting up on
his feet. “You'll like the village better. There's so many
things you can be, all at once.” -
“I’ll be a motor-car dashing through,” said Billy, cheer-
ing up. “Lots of motor-cars, all dashing through, with
men inside what have letters for Lord KITCHENER." -
“All right,” agreed Dickie, pulling himself up into the
Zeppelin.
Billy proceeded to “dash through" with great vehe-
mence and much snorting of engines.
“You sound like a train,” remarked Dickie.
“Well, p'r'aps I am a train now,” said Billy
“There's a station in my village.”
Dickie hummed gently up aloft. - -
“I’m the Zeppylin making noises,” he said; then added
with extraordinary courtesy: “Coming !” -
And he did come, not forgetting to shout “Bang!” as
he reached the ground, which was harder than he had
expected. He also bit his tongue rather severely.
“You didn't bounce much,” observed Billy, callously.
Dickie withheld his speech for several seconds.
Then he said, “I’ve had enough. Let's go in.”
“No, I want to be a bomb again,” pleaded Billy.

I CAN DO THE ‘LEFT-RIGHT," BUT I CAN'T MANAGE THE ‘I,EFT-LEFT."
How Do THEY DO IT?”
HOW I CAUGHT EDWARD.
IN tackling a trout that has evaded
capture for a large number of years,
the first thing to do is to find out
what methods of fishing he has been
brought up to, and then use care to
avoid all of them. In such a case the
fisherman's only chance is to fish all
wrong. Accordingly the first thing
I did when I engaged Edward, the
famous Fraddingford trout, at the Two
Vergers Hotel (they used to hire him
out at a special extra charge of one
shilling for the day) was to creep to the
bank above his hole and try to fetch
him a crack with the landing handle.
As it happened, he observed me, and I
missed him. I had no intention of
maiming him, but it was important to
do everything possible to lead Edward
to suppose I had no intention of trying
to catch him, and I knew that to
attempt to slog him with the landing
handle would put him off his guard.
Much more than this was however
necessary. I tied a handkerchief to
my rod so that Edward should think
I was out flag-flapping with the boy
scouts; and I sat on the edge and
from time to time I tore a sod from the
bank and pitched it in. I saw a dog,
and called him up and threw him in
on top of Edward, and made him swim
about a bit and bark, and in fact I did
all I could think of to raise in Edward
a false sense of security. In this I was
successful; Edward was completely
misled. So I caught him.
The flies I caught Edward with were
five in number. “Five" because five
were a great deal too many according
to Edward's ideas; and not more than
five because I was afraid of infringing
the rule printed on his tickets, which

I CAN DO THE ‘LEFT-RIGHT," BUT I CAN'T MANAGE THE ‘LEFT-LEFT." How Do THEY Do IT?”
HOW I CAUGHT EDWARD.
IN tackling a trout that has evaded
capture for a large number of years,
the first thing to do is to find out
what methods of fishing he has been
brought up to, and then use care to
avoid all of them. In such a case the
fisherman's only chance is to fish all
wrong. Accordingly the first thing
I did when I engaged Edward, the
famous Fraddingford trout, at the Two
Vergers Hotel (they used to hire him
out at a special extra charge of one
shilling for the day) was to creep to the
bank above his hole and try to fetch
him a crack with the landing handle.
As it happened, he observed me, and I
missed him. I had no intention of
maiming him, but it was important to
do everything possible to lead Edward
to suppose I had no intention of trying
to catch him, and I knew that to
attempt to slog him with the landing
handle would put him off his guard.
Much more than this was however
necessary. I tied a handkerchief to
my rod so that Edward should think
I was out flag-flapping with the boy
scouts; and I sat on the edge and
from time to time I tore a sod from the
bank and pitched it in. I saw a dog,
and called him up and threw him in
on top of Edward, and made him swim
about a bit and bark, and in fact I did
all I could think of to raise in Edward
a false sense of security. In this I was
successful; Edward was completely
misled. So I caught him.
The flies I caught Edward with were
five in number. “Five" because five
were a great deal too many according
to Edward's ideas; and not more than
five because I was afraid of infringing
the rule printed on his tickets, which
said that he was only to be taken “by
fair fishing with the artificial fly.” It
is difficult to say which fly caught
Edward the most ; each played a use-
ful part in getting a purchase on him
and so tangling the cast about him that
his chance was hopeless; but my own
favourite was the Green Wag-tail. I do
not, however, overlook the part played
by the hook. The fact that the hook
is the most essential component of an
artificial fly seems to be entirely
ignored by most writers on fishing.

MOSES.
I MUST begin by affirming that this
is a true story.
Everyone who ever idled in Paris in
the good days when the world was
happy must have passed now and again
across the Gardens of the Tuileries and
stopped to watch that engaging old
gentleman, M. Pol, conversing with his
friends the sparrows. Whether or no
in these dark times M. Pol, still carries
on his gracious work of charming the
birds I cannot say; he was looking
very frail when last I saw him, a year
and more ago; but that his influence
still persists is proved by the extra-
ordinary events which I am about to
relate, and which, as I said before,
tiny struggling in the gutter, and, drag-
ging the others to it, he found that it
was a young bird very near its end. The
bird had probably fluttered from the nest
too soon, and nothing but the arrival
of the twins saved its life.
“ Voilà un moimeau / " said Made-
moiselle, “moineau" being the French
nation's odd way of saying sparrow ;
and the little creature was picked up
and carried tenderly home; and since
sparrows do not fall from the heavens
every day to add interest to the life of
small American boys in Paris this little
bird had a royal time. A basket-was
converted into a cage for it and fitted
with a perch, and food and drink were
pressed upon it continually. It was
indeed the basket that was the cause of
Moses did. The light of the twins' life
was extinguished, and even Mademoi-
selle, who, being an instructor of youth,
knew the world and had gathered forti-
tude, was conscious of a blank.
So far, I am aware, this narrative
has not taxed credulity. But now
comes the turning point where you will
require all your powers of belief. A
week or so after their bereavement, as
the twins and their governess were out
for their walk, scanning, according to
their new and perhaps only half-con-
scious habit, with eager glances every
group of birds for their beloved renegade,
one of them exclaimed, “Look, there's
Moses 1" To most of us one sparrow
is exactly like another, but this little
boy's eye, trained by affection, did not
and shall probably have to
say again, are true. One
must not claim too much for
M. Pol, or underrate the intel-
ligence of Moses. None the
less I feel strongly that, had
it not been for M. Pol's many
years of sympathetic inter-
course with those gamins of
the air, the Parisian spar-
rows, and all his success in,
building that most difficult of
bridges—the one uniting bird
and man—the deeds of Moses
might never have come before
the historian.
“Moses?” you say, “who
is this Moses?” The ques-
tion is a very proper one and
it shall be answered.
Let us begin at the be-
ginning. In the city of Paris,

distant from the Etoile or

err, for Moses it truly was.
There he was pecking away
on the grass with three or
four companions.
“Moses!” called the twins;
“Moses!" called the gover.
ness, “Moses! Moses!” mov-
ing a little nearer and nearer
all the time. And after a few
moments' indecision, to their
intense rapture Moses flew
up and settled in his old

MY SECERTARY
day.
This is a free country
(more or less) and anyone is
at liberty to disbelieve my
story and even to add that I
am an Ananias of peculiar
distinction, but the story is
true none the less, and very
dwell two little boys. They
are American boys, and they have
a French governess. In addition to
this they are twins, but that has
nothing to do with Moses. I relate
the fact merely to save you the trouble
of visualising each little boy separately.
All that you need do is to imagine one
and then double him.
Well, after their lessons are done
these two little boys go for a walk with
their governess in the Champs Elysées,
or the Parc Monceau, or even into the
Bois itself, wherever, in fact, the long-
legged children of Paris take the air;
and no doubt as they walk they put a
thousand Ollendorffian questions to
Mademoiselle, who has all her work
cut out for her in answering, first on
one side and then on the other. That
has nothing to do with the story either,
except in so far as it shows you the
three together.
Well, on one morning in the Spring
the bird's name, for as one of the twins,
who was a considerable Biblical scholar,
very appositely remarked, “We ought
to call it Moses because we took it out
of the water and put it in a thing made
of rushes.” Moses thus gained his name
and his place in the establishment; and
every day he grew not only in vigour
but in familiarity. After a little while
he would hop on the twins' fingers;
after that he proceeded to Mademoi-
selle's shoulder; and then he sat on
the desk where the boys did their little
lessons and played the verydickens with
their assiduity.
In short Moses rapidly became the
most important person in the house.
And then, after two or three weeks,
the inevitable happened. Someone
left a window open, and Moses, now an
accomplished aviateur, flew away. All
befriended birds do this sooner or later,
but rarely do they leave behind them
pretty too, don't you think?
From a description of the New
Derby:-
“The sky was a bright, burnished blue;
everything was quivering in the heat; it was
an ideal day for a picnic and all the people
were pinkicking.”—The Times.
It sounds a painful way of spending a
holiday, and very bad for their boots.

in the wall open gently and the heads of some
of the albino women appear through the

IF I were the sole dictator and protector of the State
And untrammelled arbitrator of all causes small or great,
With no shade of hesitation I would cheerfully proceed
To the prompt elimination of the Folk We Do Not Need.
Though the proverb is emphatic on the merits of “Stone
Dead,”
I should not be so fanatic as to knock them on the head;
But, as quite the very best cure of the ills that we abhor,
I’d condemn them to a rest cure till the finish of the War.
First, it goes without the saying, all the scribbling men of
Straw
Who are always busy slaying England's foemen with their jaw
Should no more be tolerated when they rave and rage and
ramp,
But be speedily located in our Soporific Camp.
Next I'd take the politicians who can only growl and grouse,
With the rancorous rhetoricians who exasperate the House,
And the candid friends of Britain who, whenever we have
Won,
Are invariably smitten with compassion for the Hun.
Then I'd add the precious rollers of each other's petty logs;
Foreign policy “controllers,” pettifogging demagogues;
All the “copperheads” whose mission is to cavil and embroil,
Finally, without compunction all the novelists I'd seize
Who've usurped the critic's function; and, to cure their
fell disease,
And to purge their souls' disquiet of the tyranny of tracts
I'd confine their mental diet to MAcDoNALD's stream of
facts.
This is only a selection of the folk I'd like to see
Placed, to better our protection, safely under lock and key;
Alien enemies give trouble, yet it has to be confessed
We are menaced with a double danger in the native pest.

Further details of the KAISER's movements from the same
veracious authority are awaited with interest. Meanwhile
we understand that his favourite song for the moment is

THE RECRUITING EYE.
THE idea started with Mrs. Minter.
Indeed, I think I may say that she is
solely and entirely accountable for the
business from beginning to end, and as
several members of the Corps seem to
responsible I do say so. For I know
that it will not trouble Mrs. Minter one
little bit. She is the sort of woman
who suggests things, starts them with
enthusiasm, and then somehow forgets.
| She has a limpid conscience, a vivid
eye, a way with her, and an abounding
popularity. - -
" I think the , Corps perfectly
splendid,” she declared after the in-
spection. “Only, oh, why don't hun-
dreds more join 2 ”
“They ought to,” said Wright with
conviction. “Or, at least, they ought
to turn up stronger when they have
joined. At Tuesday's drill, Platoon 6
was forming fours out of two men. It
damps the enthusiasm of recruits when
they find that they are practically the
same in every formation.”
Mrs. Minter flashed an appreciative
musical-comedy smile, but I suspect
that technicalities do not appeal to her.
“We are agreed, then,” she said.
“Now I have an idea. Listen.”
Of course we listened. I don't think
that I have mentioned Mrs. Minter's
voice yet, but it has to be taken into
account.
“It’s just this. You can all have a
most tremendous influence. You see,
you're doing something. And so you
can say to anyone, ‘Why aren't you
doing something too?’ And you'll
get no end of recruits.”
It sounded beautifully simple; and
Mrs. Minter looked simply beautiful.
Carstairs voiced the general apprehen-
S1On.
“It's a bit awkward, don't you see,
Mrs. Minter. We don't actually know
what another fellow may be doing.
Of course with fellows one really knows
it's different. But generally speaking
it's a bit awkward, don't you see ?”
Carstairs may not be a stylist, but
we felt that the argument was sound.
“I’ve thought that all out,” said the
lady airily. “That's really just what
my idea gets over. You don't say
anything. You just look. It could
be made most tremendously effective.
You are marching along the road,
don't you see, doing your bits, and
standing watching you as you pass
are heaps and heaps of slackers who
ought to be either with you or, if they
are eligible, in the army. You don't
say anything, but as you pass you just
look. You can put a most frightful lot
think that someone ought to be made
be surprised and hurt and incredulous
and disappointed and reproachful and
—yes, just a teeny bit appealing, and
here and there one of you catching
someone's eye and then turning away
quickly as though it was really too
much, and a few friendly and encourag-
ing, and some quite too saddened to do
anything but march bravely on. It
would be ever so much more fetching
than the thrilliest poster if it were
properly done.” -
“It would want a bit of doing,” said
Bowring moodily. Bowring is a left
guide and saw where he would be
in it.
“Naturally it would need arranging,
but I will help you all I can. The
great thing is to get the right kind of
expression for the right kind of face.
Now, Mr. Beeching, for instance . . .”
You think we jibbed, but then, of
course, you don't know Mrs. Minter.
She impartially distributed expressions
suited to our faces. I will say nothing
of myself except that for show pur-
poses there is a tendency to encourage
me to become an even number in the
front rank. But, as Mrs. Minter re-
marked, grim determination can be as
artistically portrayed as any of the
subtler shades of emotion. She was
very nice about it.
A couple of days later we had a route
march. Owing to a rather late change
in orders, while a few men brought
their rifles and turned up in uniform.
the great majority did not. Still we
were pleased with the day. We put up
a great tramp, including Murber Bridge,
Little Chimpington, Brookleigh and
Sturton Much—villages in which a
volunteer corps is something of a
novelty, I should imagine, by the way
the natives turned out. It was an
opportunity, and loyally we responded
to Mrs. Minter's instructions. We
flattered ourselves that a recruiting
sergeant following our line would have
had an easy thing that day, and we
openly regretted that we should never
know the actual result of our effort.
We were mistaken.
I dropped in to see Wrathby yester-
day—he is our Quartermaster. There
were half-a-dozen other people there,
all strangers to me, and one or two
of them, I found, strangers to the
Wrathbys also. A placid old lady was
achieving momentary importance by
some narration when a word caught
my ear—
“It was quite a sensation for Little
Chimpington . . .” -
“Little Chimpington' " I exclaimed.
“Mrs. Gapper lives there,” explained
the lady who had brought her.
“Sensation ” sounded promising.
evidently impending. I made sure of
the alignment of my tie.
“I was speaking of a gang of those
terrible German spies who were marched
through the village recently,” explained
Mrs. Gapper for my benefit. “It is
a mercy that the Government is intern-
ing them at last, for a more desperate
type of men one could not imagine.
ortunately they were kept well under ||
control by a few of our own soldiers,
who marched by their sides with loaded
rifles; but the glances that the prisoners
cast in our direction as they were |
hurried by showed us plainly, now the
masks were off, what we might expect
at their hands.”
“When was this?” I found myself
asking huskily.
“Last Saturday—only last Saturday.

When the loud legions rushing in array,

accompany anything, from “God Save the King'' to the young

“Neugma' is when one meaning of a word is made to accompany
another meaning. It is a playful practice indulged in by Virgil

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
(ExTRACTED FROM THE DIARy of Toby, M.P.)
House of Commons, Monday, 14th of
June.—With ordinary course of legis-
lation blocked this Session there has
been so little work to do that House
has met only three days a week.
Arrangement highly popular with
country Members, who, with Monday
thrown into usual week-end recess,
are enabled to see something of their
families at home. Variation arranged
for this week. Second Reading of
Budget Bill put down for to-day. This
one of the events of a Session. On
such occasions CHANCELLOR of Ex-
CHEQUER is accustomed to deliver im-
portant speech leading to extended
debate. To-day Members with one
accord put aside private engagements;
hurried down to House in anticipation
of important discussion.
Occasion chanced to find that emi-
nent traveller, CoLUMBUs WAsco DA
GAMA MAGELLAN Joseph WALTon, Bt.
in Scotland. Had prepared elaborate
and convincing speech upon CHAN-
CELLOR of ExchEQUER's financial pro-
posals. Situation embarrassed by
reason of restricted train service north
of the Tweed on the Sabbath - day.
CHINESE WALTON, as he is called for
short, not the man to be beaten by
trivial obstacle like that. By organi-
sation of motor-cars making connection
with train bound South arrived in
town early this morning.
Got down to House in good time
to secure corner-seat immediately be-
hind Treasury Bench, a favourable
position for delivery of epoch-
making speech. As soon as
Questions were over, CHANCELLOR
of ExchEQUER, with character-
istic modesty seated low down on
Bench, picked up his despatch-
box and passed on to seat opposite
brassbound box usually occupied
by Minister in charge of current
debate.
Orders of day called on,
SPEAKER recited first on list.
“Finance (No. 2) Bill; Second
Reading.”
Then a strange thing happened.
Reminiscent of historic fight
between the Earl of CHATHAM and
Sir RICHARD STRAHAN. McKENNA,
having been privily informed of
intention of Member for Barnsley
to make a speech, sat waiting
for CHINESE WALTon. CHINESE
WALTON, longing to be at him,
sat waiting for CHANCELLOR of
ExchEQUER. Meanwhile the
SPEAKER, above all things a man
of business, observing that no
the Question, declared it carried in the
affirmative, and the Budget Bill for
1915, involving unparalleled expendi-
ture, passed its critical stage without a
word spoken.
Business done.—Budget Bill read a

second time. House adjourned after
an hour's sitting.
Tuesday.—House crowded in every
part in expectation of speech from
PRIME MINISTER on moving new (the
fifth) Vote of Credit. Anticipation
more than realised on highest level.
Expecting one speech Memberscharmed
A MARESFIELD NEST.
Discoverty of vaLUABLE CATTLE AT MARESFIELD PARK
with two. Remarkable by contrast
in conception and style. The first
evidently carefully prepared. When
greeted by hearty cheer that testified
to enjoyment cf full sympathy of the
House, later acknowledged—“to me a
source of strength and a stimulus to
more efficient performance of arduous
duties"—PREMIER laid on box a sheaf
of notes. Frequently referred to them
during speech that did not occupy more
than half-an-hour. In no degree em-
barrassed by the tie. A blind man
listening would not have known that
he had provided himself with assist-
ance of notes.
The second speech, in its way quite
distinct, was necessarily delivered on
spur of moment. It arose upon brief
debate following harangue by DALZIEL,
who in absence of organised Opposition
is making close study of the Candid
Friend. PREMIER adroitly seized op-
portunity, not designedly provided, to
make two happy hits. A little diffi-
culty about appointment to Irish Lord
Chancellorship at one time threatened
rupture with Irish Nationalists. This
afternoon, JoHN DILLON, whilst reserv-
ing to his Party the right to criticise
the new Ministry on its merits, declared
they would always be controlled by
honest and sincere desire to aid it in
carrying the War to a triumphant
issue. With grateful acknowledgment
the PREMIER tactfully sealed this pledge,
“given on behalf of the Irish Party by
one who has for many years been one
of its most distinguished leaders and
spokesmen.”
Another difficulty arose upon appoint-
ment of ex-General CARson to
the Attorney-Generalship. Natu-
rally resented by Home Rulers,
of whom he was the most danger-
ous opponent. PREMIER now dis-
closed the fact that when the
post was first offered CARson
declined it, tardily yielding to
strong pressure put upon him.
General impression that these
two speeches have effectually
dispelled cloud of dislike, dis-
played chiefly on Liberal benches,
that gathered round Coalition
Government. Its position in the
House and the country distinctly
strengthened.

IT is hard for the most insensible of
men to look on at this war unmoved
for long. We have looked on at it for
months and months and months from
a haunt of ancient peace known for
some obscure antiquarian reason as a
firing line; and now we are to be
moved ; to-morrow, or the next day,
or, to sum up all the possibilities in
the word of the historic despatch,
“shortly.” Indeed, the Sergeant-Major
even now approaching with his in-
destructible smile may bear the details
that we are to follow. The Sergeant-
Major is a great man for a detail.
Nothing escapes him. Three weeks
ago measles stole into our midst like
thieves in the night. The S.-M. had
them before you could say “Bosch.”
Pending the push - off, we anti-
asphyxiate ourselves. There used to
e some doubt among N.C.O.'s super-
vising as to whether the impedimenta
supplied for that end were inspirators
or perspirators. Eventually they com-
promised on “gas-bags.” Only nine
patterns have so far been issued, but
the more cautious of us wear all these
simultaneously, so if Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9
fail, 2, 4, 6 and 8 may prove efficacious.
Preparations for the trek are in train.
the fact that men who have lived nine
months in ditches may have mislaid
the use of their feet—has written out
slips permitting No. 000 Private Blank
to fall out and report at Dash with
all possible expedition. Now our
Mr. Mactavish is a very thorough
officer, and he was determined that no
one was going to catch him out through
his having too few of these backsliding
permits. But when I found him en-
gaged on the sixty-fourth, the strength
of his platoon being forty-seven, I felt
compelled to demand some explanation.
He seems to have assumed that some
men might fall out twice. To me, the
assumption that men whose feet have
given way will pick up a taxi some-
where and overhaul you just for the
pleasure of falling out again, appeared
rash.
Since the foregoing was indelibled,
we have walked a great walk—seven
leagues, no less. At intervals, we
bivouac in odd bits of Europe that
happen to be unoccupied when we
stumble on them. Some are crowded
with horrible dangers. Never shall I
forget seeing Private Packer wake up
from his afternoon sleep to find him-
self practically in the act of being
bitten by a ferocious cow. Springing
up with a loud cry, he threw the
whereas by all the best traditions
he should have continued to smile.
Fortunately the cow (like President
WILSON) was too proud to fight. ...
The trek has been a great disappoint-
ment to those who were looking forward
to writing home brave accounts of
“how I marched forty miles on a
biscuit and a cough-lozenge 2" When
we got to our first bivouac three of us
had just made a frugal meal of malted
milk tablets and melted barley sugar
when the Mess-Sergeant loomed up
with the news that lunch was served.
My appetite was so impoverished by
previous indulgence that I gave up

AT THE PLAY.
“THE GREEN FLAG.”
If one is permitted to judge of a
man by the kind of woman he attracts,
the character of Lord Milverdale (or
Peter, for short) is an interesting
enigma. For some reason best known
to himself (like most of the obscurities
in a play it happened before the curtain
rose) he had married a rich and spite-
ful vulgarian. On the other hand,
for his second love he had selected in
Janet Grierson a woman of exceptional
sweetness and refinement. The domes-
tic complications which followed upon
the discovery of this diversion of his
affections compelled him to withdraw
to America, and it was from there that
he wrote to Janet, inviting her (with
cable-form enclosed) to join him by the
next liner. Naturally one was intrigued
about the personality of a man for
whose heart there was competition
between two such opposite types, and
it was very regrettable that a respect
for the dramatic unities prevented
Mr. KEBLE HowARD from gratifying
our curiosity by letting Peter appear
on the stage.
In his unavoidable absence, Lady
Milverdale relentlessly pursued her
husband's lover, and would have been
well content to break up the happy
home of another couple—Sir Hugh
and Lady Brandreth, friends of both
parties—if by sowing unwarrantable
suspicions against her rival she could
have got her revenge. You will
gather that our sympathies were not
encouraged to take the side of morality,
and that the injured woman had no
chance with us as against the disturber
of her peace. But Mr. ARTHUR Bour-
CHIER would never have lent himself
to the defeat of virtue in however
repellent a guise, and in the person
of Sir Hugh Brandreth, K.C., after
using his forensic gifts to dissuade
Janet from joining her lover, he succeeds
in finding a passable solution of things,
though he never exactly readjusts our
disordered emotions.
The degeneration of comedy into
farce is a frequent subject of critical
attack; but here it was the farcical
element that revived us. The First
Act had gone rather tamely, and in the
opening of the Second some of us only
listened to Mr. BourchIER's sound
homilies on the after-effects of lawless
clopement with the respectful toleration
due to the accepted generalities of
common experience. It was then that
the arrival of Lady Milverdale in Bran-
dreth's chambers, hot on the track of
Janet, gave opportunities for a game
of hide-and-seek, in which, after some
tracked down by her quarry. And so
the play was saved.
It was a charming irony that assigned

have found accommodation in her nice
head. To hear her urging, with that
gentle voice of hers, the desirability of
was to listen to an innocent child ||
pleading for the right to play with its |
favourite toy. The fact—deplorable, if
you like—is that Miss BRAITHwaite
was never meant to be anything but
her charming self, though within those
limits her moods can vary all right, as
in the startling change by which she
totally forgets her tragedy in the sudden |
joy of scoring off the other woman.
This thankless part was played with
sacrificial devotion by Miss CoNSTANCE
CoLLIER, who to the odious qualities of
a scandalmonger was asked to add the
ridiculous affectation of a woman who
had climbed into a world to which she
did not belong. Her ignorance of the
proprieties went so far that she called
at her husband's club for his letters;
and the strange thing was that the
hall-porter obliged her. At which of
Mr. KEBLE HowARD's fashionable clubs
is this kind of outrage permitted 2
Mr. BourchIER was excellent in the
little that he had to do; but it was almost
too easy for him. As for Miss KYRLE
BELLEw, who played Lady Brandreth,
her angularity will wear off with time
and teaching; but she must try to
dress for the part she plays, having no
need to advertise her native piquancy.
Miss BARBARA Gott, as a garrulous
housekeeper, kept the First Act alive,
and Miss MAY WHITTY, as a mother
and an afterthought, was useful in the
Third Act, to which her natural ease
of manner brought a refreshing air of
probability.
The title of the play, The Green Flag,
had nothing to do with the Nationalists,
and implied no competition with the
Union Jack. It was a symbol taken
from the railway, and was waved by
the K.C. as a caution to Janet.
Mr. KEBLE HowARD has not com-
mitted a masterpiece. His titled people
smack a little of that Suburbia in which
he has specialised. But the play should
have a decent run for the sake of the
farcical business of the Second Act.
P.S.–I regret that in a recent
notice of Armageddon I did Mr. MARTIN
HARVEY an injustice in attributing to
him the unfortunate change in the
Scene where Joan of Arc was made to
address the English general, and not,
as in the original text, the French
General. Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPs writes
to inform me that he himself suggested
this alteration during rehearsal.

spirit of the play. There are only
seven characters, and six of them are
at one time or another engaged in
pronounced flirtations with somebody
else's spouse. I wonder if Williams,
the Ponsonbys' solemn-faced butler
(Mr. Edward DUGGIE), was able to
keep track of the amorous permuta-
tions and combinations in which his
master and mistress were involved in
the course of three Acts. My own
recollections of the plot are somewhat
hazy—perhaps because I laughed so
much—but I remember that Jim Pon-
sonby, in order to find time to make
love to Mrs. Chesterton, accused his
wife of flirting with Dick Trevor; and
that Mrs. Jim, though quite innocent
of any such intention, was gradually
converted to a belief that she was really
in love with Dick. The principal agent
in this conversion was her disreputable
papa, Horatio Billington, who assured
her that “the Billingtons are all like
that,” and proceeded to illustrate the
family failing by inviting Mrs. Chester-
ton to a tête-d-téte supper. On his
advice, too, Jim, in order to arouse his
wife's jealousy and so to recover her
affections, makes violent love to Mrs.
Trevor. That brings Dick to his bear-
ings, and eventually leads to a restora-
tion of the status quo all round.

THE ENCOUNTER.
THIS is not my story. It was related to me by Hattersley,
who is a dog-owner and a dog-elevator. That is to say,
he elevates dogs to a superhuman position, which, in my
opinion, they are not qualified to occupy. I'm all for dogs,
so long as they are kept in their proper places, in a kennel
or a stable or something of that kind; but Hattersley has
them everywhere—on beds and chairs and sofas. He
spends part of his time in teaching them elementary tricks
with biscuits or lumps of sugar, and takes up the rest by
giving long accounts of their extraordinary sagacity in
detecting character. Dogs and children, he says, are like
that. They always know in one sniff who likes them and
take their measures accordingly. However, I didn't mean
to set out all Hattersley's theories on dogs, but to let him
tell one of his dog stories. When you've heard it you'll
know what kind of man he is. So here goes, in Hattersley's
words as nearly as I can remember them —
“There's only one weak point,” said Hattersley, “about
dogs, and that is their insistence on being taken for walks.
You can't fob them off with a stroll in the garden. If you
try, they lie down and refuse to follow you and display no
interest whatever in your proceedings. They will go out-
side the grounds. I can't take my pack of three Pekinese
and one Great Dane out on our country roads on account
of the Dane's capacity for sudden pouncing on other dogs.
He means no harm, poor beast, but he disconcerts and
angers other dog-owners, especially ladies, and if the other
int
of honour with him. Besides, the Pekinese either .
| defiantly along the crown of the road, thus interrupting all
traffic and giving occasion for violent language from motor-
cars, or they push their investigation into the nature of
grass-tufts to such a point of prolonged particularity that
| they get left far behind and have to be retrieved and carried
| after shouts and whistles have been spent on them in vain.
| These things being so, I have, in the matter of dog-walks,
| concentrated on a path along the bank of a river, where
there is no traffic of wheels, and where on most days other
pedestrians and other dogs are so few as to be scarcely
noticeable. Here I exercised my dogs until I came to have ||
a sense of private ownership over this particular walk.
“So things went on quite comfortably for some time.
But one morning I chanced to walk along my sacred path
meditating I know not what trifles and entirely absorbed in
them. The Pekinese were following their own devices.
The Dane was pacing by my side, and my hand was
fortunately on his collar, when I felt a sudden tension and
looked up. A hundred yards away, but coming towards
me, my startled eyes beheld a tall military-looking lady
conducting, at the end of a strong lead, a massive and
monstrous bulldog. At the same moment she saw me and
we both stopped. I failed to restrain the Pekinese; they
made a combined rush and were all round the advancing
bulldog in a moment. He did not seem to be aware of
their existence, but with eyes glaring fearfully and with
foaming mouth he was straining at his lead in a violent
- endeavour to get at Hamlet, who, on his side, seemed to be
consumed with an equal fury. I must mention that
Hamlet has a special distaste for bulldogs. In early life,
before he came to me, he had lived on intimate terms
with a dog of that breed. He consoled himself for that
temporary friendship by trying to massacre every bull-
dog he met. The situation was serious, for we were on a
narrow path which at this point was bounded on one side
by the river, on the other by a row of willows and a wide
ditch.
“‘It is,' I said, “highly inconvenient."
“‘My dog,' she said, ‘is most good-natured with little dogs,
but he always flies at big dogs, and he can't bear Danes.’
“‘Hamlet,' I said, ‘is just like that. He detests
bulldogs." .
“‘It you wouldn't mind going into the ditch,' she said,
“we might get past.’
“I feel that the situation is worthy of one of Mr. BELLoc's
battle-plans; but I have no skill in these, and must ask you
to imagine the features of the ground and the movements
of two commanders whose ardent desire was not to collide
but to avoid one another. Both of us were all but tugged
over, but at length we accomplished our manoeuvres and
got past, and after reciprocal apologies we were able to
resume our walks, the Pekinese being with immense
difficulty persuaded to abandon their new playfellow.
“We met again on the following two mornings, but in a
more open patch of country, where the lady was able to
fetch a wide circuit in a meadow. She cowered down in the
grass three hundred yards away until the danger was over;
but the Pekinese of course tracked her down and seemed
determined to plunge down the throat of her animated
canine gargoyle. Obviously this sort of thing couldn't go
on. On the fourth morning we met again on the confined
path. This time Hamlet gave a wrench, the bulldog made
a bound, and in a lightning-flash the two were rushing at ||
one another's throats. The lady averted her eyes, I held
my breath, and in anticipation I beheld us collecting the
tattered remnants of what had once been dogs. Crash
They met; but, instead of setting to work to devour one
another, they began to gambol round, to yap with pleasure,
to pursue one another in:short circles and altogether to
give the liveliest signs of joy." The relief was extraordinary.
The apprehensive lady raised her head. ‘They must leave
known one another,' she said; and indeed it was so. We
discovered that these were the very two dogs; who had
spent their childhood together. They had known it all the
time, and had strained and panted for reunion while we
strove to keep them apart. I assure you dogs are better
and more intelligent than men. 'After that we could meet
without fear.” . . .

*** - - - - - - -
That is Hattersley's story. For my own part I don't
quite see why he makes such a point of it. What strikes
me is this, that Hattersley, who has known dogs all his life,
thought they were purple with passion, when as a matter
of fact they were wild with joy. -

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
IN The Soul of the War (HEINEMANN) Mr. PHILIP GIBBs
writes with that sympathy, perception and distinction
which by diligent use of his deft and careful pen he has
trained us to expect. He is at his worst in such passages
as “I went out to aid them but did not like the psychology
of this street, where death was teasing the footsteps of men,
yapping at their heels.” Red, whether of flags or trousers,
is never mere red to him, but always “blood-red.” And he
lets himself be decoyed into patches of irrelevant purple—
tiresome snares of his trade. “Heavens !” you seem to hear
him say, “if this agony of war, this tragic blend of heroism
and bestial savagery is not to move a man to eloquence will
anything ever on God's earth?” And yet despite this
reasonable plea it remains true that he is at his best where
most direct and artless, and that there is some faint lapse
from taste in fine writing about such infinitely poignant
realities. That said, one can praise unreservedly both the
matter and spirit of this book. And indeed both make such
criticism seem rather too frigidly academic. Mr. GIBBs
does not write as the complacent journalist reporting unique
“stories.” He gives both sides of his picture, the expected
and the other: the courage and resource of men and the high
glory of battle, the nausea and despairing depression, the
occasional failure of the shattered spirit, the insurgent
brutality, the haunting perplexity that shadows even the
stoutest and most inspiring patriotism—“Why kill—or be
killed by—men against whom I have (or had) no possible
quarrel ?” Passionately he wants us others never to let
to share the blame for a system which makes it possible.
And this without assuming that there is anything else to
be done now but bring a murderous group to justice, or with-
out failing to recognise that to have yielded to the menaces
of their power and insolence would have been a worse
thing for the world than even the horrors it has found.
It is not a book for the faint-hearted or the empty-headed
—if there be any such left. The others should read it for
its truth, its sincerity and the candour of its criticism.
If, as I suspect, Hyssop (CoNSTABLE) is a first novel, it
contains ample promise to make me expect considerable
things from Mr. M. T. H. SADLER in the future. I say
this because, while the present volume is agreeable enough
—though the plot, which only develops in the final chapters,
is grim and hardly for everybody's reading—it is obvious
that the author is as yet by no means fully master of his
art. As with many young writers, his power of observation
has somewhat intoxicated him; detail, he has yet to learn,
is for the novelist a good servant that can easily become
a tyrant. For example, Mr. SADLER has remembered and
recorded practically everything about the life of a modern
Oxford undergraduate; but though the result is a wonder-
fully faithful presentation, it might well provoke impatience
in those who have no personal associations to help the
interest of the picture. It is too like a bound volume of
The Isis. Through four-fifths of the book he records
minutely the characters and trivial actions of Philip
Murray and his undergraduate friends in order to prepare
the effect of the one big event at the end. Occasionally,
circumstance has given to some of this detail an unexpectedly

these dreadfully futile things happen again, and invites us
poignant value. I found myself arrested, for example, by

} and whirls you along, and you have no more chance of
the skill with which a foreign railway station at night had
been caught, with “the whistle of the pneumatic breaks”
as the express comes to halt above the low platforms; one
of the sounds that seem to echo now out of the happy
unrecoverable years. Occasionally the detail is simply
superfluous. “Philip left his hat and stick in the white
panelled hall, denied the necessity of washing his hands
immediately, and followed Laddie . . . into the garden.”
That is what I mean by hinting that when Mr. SADLER
discovers what to leave out we shall all be the better for it.
In these days of massive trilogies, when your novelist
demands at least four hundred pages in which to bring his
hero's career up to the point where he is informed by his
private-school master that he has passed the entrance ex-
amination for Harrow, it is a refreshing change to come!

years' standing, while Rosamund, after the divorce pro-

now being thoroughly bored by that excellent but limited
young man. Miss Bottom E has all the talents. She draws
characters that step out of the pages and walk before one;
she establishes atmosphere with an economy of words
almost miraculous in these long-winded days; and she
contrives, without straining for epigram, to insert in every
chapter phrase after phrase worthy of the reviewer's best
compliment—the pencil-mark in the margin.
When I found myself confronted with a volume of very
short stories over the signature of “GEORGE A. BIRMING-

Beaumont, who flies from the conventional, as represented
by Philip Strangeways, to the unconventional, in the person
of Pat O'Malley, the impecunious artist of Rome. There

endless English comfort, by county folks caressed"; but,
on the other hand, she did wish Pat would dress for dinner,

know what I mean. That involving of the reader in a maze
of absurd but severely logical intrigue that keeps him
breathlessly pursuing laughter through chapter after chap-
ter. In a sense I was both right and wrong, chiefly the
latter. Though there are some stories in Minnie's Bishop
(HopDER AND SToughton) that practically anybody else
could have written, there are also others that show Mr.
“BIRMINGHAM " at his best. Especially would I wish to
record my delight in three quite exquisite little sketches of
character—“Onnie Dever,” the story of a barefoot fisher-girl
who became the leading lady in an American dress empor:
ium ; “Bedclothes,” which tells how a curate, smothered
in conventionalities, obtained relief; and one other, a thing
of the tenderest and most delicate art, which I will leave
you to identify for yourself. A word of warning: do not
be put off by the fact that for some obscure reason the
author has chosen to name his volume after a story that,
though it comes first, is a long way the feeblest in the col-
lection. There are others that for wit and wisdom in a

a station waiting-room.” In the end Pat very naturally
little room will make ample amends.

New Light on Magna Carta.
“Few people in Egham, no doubt, thought

Many of us, however, have a notion of what
that Charter meant to England and our fore-

Seven hundred years ago one of the fickle
Stewarts was met by that bold band of
Barons.
Imagine the scene: King Charles is handed
the document, and in the language of the day,
politely but gently was he impressed with the
need for such a Charter and advised probably
that it would be all the better for his health if
he signed it.”—Surrey Herald.
It was on this occasion that KING

UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.
No. XXIV.
(From the German Ambassador at Washington, D.C., U.S.A.)
ALL-HIGHEST MAJESTY,-I have carried out to the best
of my ability the commands conveyed to me by voN JAGow
and BETHMANN-Hollweg, which I have treated as coming
from the most serene and in-the-topmost-degree infallible
mouth of my most gracious Emperor himself, and I am
grieved to report that the result so far has been nothing of
the smallest value to the German cause. This is the more
regrettable because I have spent an infinity of labour in
counteracting the designs of the malevolent and in repre-
senting the acts and opinions of your Majesty in the best
light that circumstances would permit. In these cir-
cumstances I include DERNBURG, who is now happily
removed from this country. He was, if I may venture
to say so, a sore trial to me during his stay here, and I
cannot rejoice sufficiently over his departure, tardy though
it was. -
I must tell you quite frankly that the sinking of the
hitherto produced the anticipated results. Indeed, the
American people, as you may judge from the newspapers
which I send herewith for your Majesty's inspection, have |
shown and are still showing a most unreasonable and
obstinate anger on the subject. The stories I have put
about as to the ship's being armed they openly say they do
not believe, and thus they make an unforgivable imputation
against my good faith (which does not, of course, matter)
and against the veracity of your most transparent Majesty,
which is acknowledged by all Germans to be beyond
reproach. Mr. WILsoN, the President, has spoken to me on
this matter with inexplicable feeling. “We cannot admit,"
he said, “that Germany has the right to destroy American
citizens engaged in their lawful business, but we go further
and declare that this atrocious act is against the laws of
humanity, which even Germany is bound to respect.” That
was disagreeable, and I was compelled to use the utmost tact
in continuing the conversation. I reminded the PRESIDENT
that there were many American citizens of German race,
who, in case of a difference between Germany and the
United States, would undoubtedly range themselves on the
side of Germany; but the PRESIDENT calmly replied that this
remark showed that I had not properly understood the
sentiments of American citizens, no matter what their race
might be. “They are,” he said, “American citizens first
and all the time. Why,” he continued, “you have only to
consult the newspapers or attend gatherings of citizens to
realise that those who are called German-Americans are at
this moment tumbling over one another with the most
genuine protestations of unswerving loyalty and devotion to
America. If you build on these, and believe they will
support the lawless acts of your Government, I can only
assure you that you are profoundly mistaken.” Somehow
I felt that it was just possible that he was right in his
estimate. It would be a melancholy disappointment to us,
and I think with sorrow of all the money we have spent to
such small purpose.
In the course of further conversation I happened to allude
jocosely to the use of asphyxiating gas by our ever-victorious
army, but the PRESIDENT took me up very sternly and said
this was no laughing matter, but a shocking example of
inhuman cruelty. I ventured to contest this opinion,
declaring that death by such means was really in itself
quite pleasant, whereupon Mr. WILSON asked me if I was
anxious to choose it for myself and what would be the '
inscription on the tombstone. “You remind me,” he said,
“of the man who left directions in his will as to the disposal
of his body in case he survived his own decease.” What
is one to do with such a man, who cannot appreciate the
value to humanity of the epoch-making inventions of Ger:

say that it leſt me satisfied with the present attitude of
the American Government and the American people. They

had hoped; but it is no fault of mine. If people will mis-

MY DEAR CHARLEs, - Five days'
leave for Henry. O beauteous prospect!
Five whole days and nights of liberty
and indiscipline, England and no ruins!
Five fours are twenty, five twos are
ten and two 's twelve : a hundred-and-
twenty glorious hours of crowded life
with never a “Stand to arms ' "
Nobody shall inspect me or anything
that is mine; I will inspect nobody
and nothing. There shall be no barbed
wire, no bully-beef tins anywhere. All
around me shall be peaceful, refined,
decadent, effeminate; silk socks, for
instance, possibly of the mauve kind;
the green squash hat, the patent leather
shoe, even the umbrella. Shall I con-
tinue to carry all I possess upon my
aching back 2 No; a taxicab shall carry
me; and a messenger boy, following at
a respectful distance, shall carry my
gloves and evening paper. I will spend
many of those precious hours watching
real hot water gush out of a real tap,
and I've a good mind to shave off my
moustache for the time being.
There shall be no order or method in
my comings and goings; I will saunter,
possibly even slouch. Fair English
women shall adorn the thoroughfares
along which I pass; no coarse male
hands shall tamper with my food;
enamel ware and large grimy hands
shall disappear; I will revel in white
tablecloths, clean napkins, bright silver;
in coffee and correspondence served
on trays. “Spotless evening dress” and
real beds shall reassert themselves in
my life. The rising and setting of the
sun shall be no concern of mine; at the
former I will be sleeping, at the latter
dining. I will be no man's master and
no man shall be mine; my afternoon I
will spend in the drawing-rooms of
Mayfair, drinking delicate tea from
frail china cups (with saucers to them,
ye gods !) gossiping scandalously, or
trifling flippantly with things that don't
matter. I will wash me a hundred
times a day; the Turkish Bath shall be
my second home; sardines and all
other things that inhabit tins shall
be taboo; milk shall come straight
from the cow and no Swiss middleman
shall have had a hand in it; light in
any degree required shall be had for the
mere pressing of a button, and break-
fast shall be at a reasonable hour.
Upon consideration, all other pro-
grammes are a wash-out; I will do
nothing all the time.
Such are the orders I have issued to
myself during this, the last tour in the
trenches, before I go. My leave is in
my pocket; my very ticket is in my
has been one whirl of gay anticipation ;
I wait here for the relief to come. For
the fourth time in four days the sun
has returned to his accustomed west.
“Lucky beggar,” say I, a fellow-feel-
ing making me wondrous kind.
In the telephone dug-out sits the
signaller, quarreling with his confrère
at the other end of the line, and repeat-
ing undeterred his spirited “Akk, akk,
akk.” Barbed wire in all fancy designs
stands everywhere, patiently awaiting
darkness so that it may emerge and
join its kind outside the parapet.
The senior captain sits in the mess hut
struggling with reports and returns,
certificates and lists of trench stores.
The junior captain prowls as ever in
search of the least untidiness in the
demesne (what a curse he'll be to his
wife when he goes on leave '). As
usual the subalterns congregate and
resettle European affairs and rearrange
the end of the war for an early date.
The latest rumour floats round the
boys: “Turkey's hostility has given
in ; Austria's ammunition has given
out; we are for home and light guard
duties at Buckingham Palace this day
fortnight.” The inevitable slice of
bacon frizzles over the brazier; break-
fast in the trenches may begin at dawn,
but it is not over by dusk. My pet
irrepressible hurls threats at the enemy
over the way; the answering bullet
bespatters irritably the top line of our
sand-bags. At his enplacement the
sergeant of the machine gun section
lays his aim for his customary twenty
or thirty rounds at eventide, and ex-
plains for the hundredth time that the
parts of the gun which recoil are
technically known as the recoiling parts,
the parts which don't recoil as the non-
recoiling parts. His audience show
their appreciation by gently humming
songs about aged mothers and canteens.
To my happiness my servant puts
the last touch with a cup of soup.
“One of these days, William,” say I,
“you will get a D.C.M.” “D.C.M.,
Sir?” he queries. “A distinguished
conduct medal,” I say. “More likely,
Sir,” says he, “a district court-martial.”
My smile prompts William, ever a
sympathetic subject, to gossip. Had
I heard of the local parson 2 No.
William gives me the facts. “He
couldn't serve himself, Sir,” says he,
“ or said he couldn't, so he mounted
his organist on his own best horse and
despatched the pair of them, with his
compliments, to the nearest Yeomanry
Recruiting Office.” A true raconteur,
William pauses before making his
point. “The Yeomanry people ex-
pressed their thanks, Sir," says he,

in this case, however, I am only lead-

It is past weeping for, a long way

him. The orderly, knowing the contents
of the note, has gone. William, knowing
me, has also withdrawn. I am about
to help myself to two bombs from the
trench stores, with a view to destroying
my immediate surroundings, when my
eye falls on the machine-gun, with its
new belt in, all ready to fire. I advance
upon it; the anger flashing from my
eyes awes the section. With no man's
leave or licence I sit down behind the
gun and, raising the safety catch and
depressing the button, I loose off with-
out pause 250 passionate fiery rounds,
meaning every one of them. . . .
Amongst my fellows is a better-
educated private who in civilian life is
apparently a poet. His life also is at
this moment one overwhelming burn-
ing grievance against things at large.
His last day in the trenches has been
one of that peculiarly offensive kind
which, occurring in the life of every
private at some time or other, consists
of duty upon duty, task after task.
His last straw is also a message just
arrived : a verbal message from his
platoon-sergeant to the effect that
the first twenty-four hours of his rest
will be spent on headquarters guard.
Being either unaware of my presence
or else aware of my inner feelings, he
gives vent to verse, which, however
little he may mean it or however
emphatically it would have been sup-
pressed by me in other circumstances,
I now take a wicked delight in repro-
ducing, without, of course, endorsing
its sentiment:—

Park Lane.
DEAREST DAPHNE,--The sinking of
all political differences, the fusion of
parties, and all that sort of thing, is
altogether splendid from one point of
view, but, my dear, there's another
side to the picture—the social side.
I put it to you—how is Society to
survive if we're all to be dear friends,
not criticising anybody and not finding
fault with anything 2 Life will lose
all its snap, and Society may as well
be wound up by the LORD CHANCELLOR,
or whoever it is winds up bankrupt
concerns, and its goods sold for the
benefit of its creditors. It's all very
well to talk of the lion lying down with
the lamb, but of course it makes life
he was actually on his way to Upping
Street, Stella had him kidnapped to
Clackmannan House to play and sing
to her crowd.
Clackmannan never opened his lips
in public or private without attacking
George Arkwright, and George Ark-
wright used to speak of the Duke as
“a surviving relic of the monstrous
and effete old feudal system,” and now
these two are colleagues in public and
friends in private | The newly-created
Minister for Remembering Things, with
£5,000 a year and a seat in the Cabinet
(the duties are to think of everything
that other State Departments have for-
gotten) is no other than the Duke of
Clackmannan, and he and George Ark-
wright are always conferring together
and dining together! Stella C. and
Mary A. have buried everything even
were quite national property, and no
jeune premier ever had half so many
notes of admiration | Popsy, Lady R.,
and others of our frisky juvenile-
antiques have always patronised the
Alamode; indeed, Popsy has been so
important there that the manager used
to consult her about a new “find,” and
be guided by her verdict; for, as he
once said, “What Popsy, Lady Rams-
gate, says to-day about a young actor
the matinée-girl will say to-morrow.”
From the first she was quite éprise of
Lionel Lestrange. Two or three times
a week her curls and binoculars (the
latter always at her eyes and always
fixed on Lionel) might be seen in the
Ramsgate box, and she grew so pointed
in her attentions that it's said the rest
of the company nicknamed Lestrange
“The Dowager Earl!” And then one
day, after thinking it over for about
a distinctly duller busi-
ness both for the lion and
the lamb. * *2.
For instance, Mr. Ark-
wright and the Duke of
Clackmannan have not
only been prominent in
opposite camps; their poli-
tical hostility extended to
their private life. It was
the funniest thing to see
them when they met at
people's houses and had
to speak | Stella Clack-

ten months, our postcard
hero suddenly realised that
his country was at war
and wanted him, and he
shed his bright socks and
his stage smile and got
into khaki. There was
wailing and gnashing of
teeth among the patron-
esses of the Alamode. But
a successor soon bobbed
up. “Mr. Claude Clithe-

well. The new startwinkled

their hearts, and enjoyed an almost
perfect enmity. Oh, the dear little
pinpricks and the innumerable small
ruses de guerre that made their lives
bright and snappy Once, when it
was Stella's turn to lecture at the
Garden Talks of the Anti-Banalites,
Mary Arkwright asked her what she
| was going to talk to us about; and
Stella, who was dabbling in Oriental
mysticism just then, said her subject
was, “Which is the more desirable
state of being—Nirvana, or the Final
Negation of Moksha 2 ” “Ah,” said
Mary, “then I read a meaning into
that delightful frock of yours, duchess
dear; the deep folded waistband is
meant to suggest a lifebelt, as you're
sure to get out of your depth !”
Stella got a bit of her own back the
week after, however. You remember
that marvellous boy, Popperitzky, who
played the flute with his mouth and
sang to it through his nose, and sent
London quite wild? Mary Arkwright
had secured him for one of her big
affairs at their official home, and, while
for ever consulting about war-bazaars
and matinées, and it’s “Mary, dear, I
meant to fix the 25th for my concert in
aid of Wobbly Neutrals Who Can't
Make Up Their Minds, but I thought
I'd ask first if you want that date; ”
and it’s “How very thoughtful of you,
dearest | No, I've nothing at all for the
25th.” --
I saw them driving together in the
Park yesterday, and as my car passed
theirs I called out, “Hallo, Coalition;
you both look rather dismal.” “No
wonder,” Mary Arkwright called back;
“each of us has lost her best enemy "
People are whispering quite an
amusing little storyette about Popsy,
Lady Ramsgate, and the Alamode
Theatre. The Alamode has long special-
ised in jeunes premiers; its leading
men have always been acknowledged
beauty - boys, postcard heroes and
matinée idols. And of the whole series
Lionel Lestrange (some people say his
real name is Sam Hodges) was the
biggest draw. His wavy hair, his eye-
brows and his dazzling socks and smile
all right. The house was
full, and innumerable feminine whispers
went about, “What a darling Claude
Clitherow is ” “Handsomer than
Lionel Lestrange—or at least quite as
handsome.” Popsy, Lady R. sent for
the manager in the interval, had the
new boy presented to her, and took him
out to supper after the show.
Shortly, however, there began to be
rumours. And Popsy, who was com-
pletely off with the old love and on
with the new, went flying off to see
the manager of the Alamode one day
in a flaming fury—“Have you dared
play such a trick on the public, Morris
Jacobson? I thought Claude Clitherow's
face was somehow familiar to me!
Yes, I see it's true!” “Hush, my
lady,” pleaded Jacobson, tearing his
black ringlets in an agony; “don’t
give me away ! I was at my wits'

The third day, after a rather elaborate
farewell, he again deserted me, and
didn't come back. I waited for him at
his bedroom door, knowing his ways
of life and notions of bedtime. Later,
I searched his studio—and the family
gave me talk I couldn't understand.
Two days, three days, still no Master.
Then I went out to look for him.
It was late in the evening at the
“Foaming Bowl" (a sort of lending
library Master used to call at) that I
was recognised and taken home; but
black-and-tan terriers don't give in
easily.
The family was very nice and sym-

them that I'd find him yet, and, O

Master, back view, four shades of yellow

sat upon a pen-and-ink sketch (wet)

But still we don't give in, we black-

tumble to the fact that any one of the

I had to search them all.

ON THE SPY-TRAIL.
VII.
A Lot of people have told Jimmy
that he ought to exhibit his blood-
hound, Faithful, so Jimmy asked the
milkman the proper way to send it to
a show. -
The milkman said it depended upon
the kind of show, but in any case
Jimmy would have to give warning
first. He said he was going to see a
friend of his who was a dog-fancier,
and if Jimmy liked to bring Faithful
he would take them with him in his
milk carriage. Jimmy says they found
the dog-fancier sitting fancying outside
his house with a pot of beer. He was
a very fat man, Jimmy says, and spoke
with a husk. He thought a lot of
Faithful when he saw him; he called
his wife to have a look at him. He
asked her if Faithful reminded her of
anyone. She saw the likeness at once;
it was her Uncle Joe.
“His side-whiskers to a T,” the dog-
fancier said.
The milkman told Jimmy afterwards
that Uncle Joe was not very popular
with them.
The dog-fancier looked hard at
Faithful and asked Jimmy if he col-
lected postage-stamps as well. But
when Jimmy told him of the German
spies that his bloodhound had tracked
down he was so pleased that he
wanted to do something for Faithful,
and he decided to drink his health,
when suddenly they heard old Faithful
on the spy-trail again. -
You see Faithful had discovered that
when the back of the milkman's carriage
is unfastened, it hits the road with a
bang if you jump inside, and push at
it. Faithful is a good pusher, Jimmy
says, and it made the milkman's horse
jump three feet out of its sleep, and
that jerked the back of the carriage up
and banged it on the ground again.
Jimmy says it made the dog-fancier
and the milkman want to start off in
a great hurry to go and see, good
gracious, what it was, and the milk-
man started first because the dog-
fancier stopped to choke over his beer
—it was the husk that did it, he said.
By the time the milkman reached
the road, Jimmy says his bloodhound
had worked the milkman's horse up
into a mad career.
Jimmy says he was afraid lest
Faithful might get run over, and the
milkman said he was afraid lest he
mightn't. They were very hot on the
trail, Jimmy says, and you could hear
the back of the milk carriage flapping
quite nicely against the road; it never
missed once. Jimmy says the milk-
spy-trail before, and as he ran he told
Jimmy in confidence that if he had
known this would have happened he
would not have come out, and Jimmy was
to catch him doing it again, my word.
Jimmy says they had only run a
mile when they came across some signs
of Faithful's progress; it was a motor-
car which had pushed its nose into a
ditch, and the chauffeur showed the
milkman how you did it. He said he
had just avoided the milk-cart when
a black rabbit suddenly bolted across
the road and upset his nerve. Jimmy
says bloodhounds are like that when
they are on the trail; they appear in-
human, and it's because of their lust
for blood. There were two ladies in
the motor-car, and they asked the milk-
man to come back and help when he
had caught his horse.
Jimmy says when they returned the
chauffeur was under the car worrying;
they could hear him doing it. They
heard him tell the two ladies not to
stand there like a couple of fools, but
to and then the ladies started to
cough violently, and the chauffeur
mumbled something about asking for
the coupling tools, and would the milk-
man help him for half-a-crown, because
he had broken his petrol pipe?
The chauffeur was surprised to see
Faithful; he crawled out to study his
face. “I thought it was a black rabbit,”
he said, and then, because Faithful
wagged his tail, he tried to strafe him
with a spanner.
But Jimmy says Faithful knows all
about spanners, he always has one eye
fixed on things like that whatever else
he may be doing with the other.
Faithful liked to see the chauffeur hide
himself under the car; he found him
again quite easily, and then it was
Faithful's turn to hide. “
Jimmy says the milkman helped the
chauffeur a good deal; he asked him
what the petrol pipe was for, and
wouldn't it do if he put a piece of cork
in it, and what would happen if the
motor-car started while he was like
that. He told the chauffeur he had a
cousin who was a blacksmith, but give
him cows.
Jimmy says the milkman would have
helped the chauffeur a lot more, but,
when he pointed to the carburetter and
asked if that was where they put the
electric in, the chauffeur was very rude.
Jimmy says one of the ladies got a
camp-stool out of the car, and when
she sat down Jimmy says she stuck
both of her feet out straight in front of
her, and then hitched her dress to
prevent it bagging at the knees, and
then seemed to remember something,
for she laughed. Jimmy says that
asked him if he would like sixpence, and
then tried to find her dress pocket.
Jimmy says he felt funny all inside
whilst she was fumbling for her pocket,
because he knew Faithful had done it
again, and it was a spy dressed up like
a, WOrnan.
Jimmy says he had to get over the
hedge without being seen, and then
he ran as hard as he could to ask the
dog-fancier his opinion. Jimmy says
the dog-fancier's opinion was two
mastiffs, a double-barrelled gun and a
policeman, and when they got back
they found old Faithful playing at “all
round the mulberry bush " with the
chauffeur, who had mended his petrol
pipe and was trying to lever the car
out of the ditch.
Jimmy says the policeman warned
them that anything they cared to say
would be used as evidence, and then
he had to ask the chauffeur to go more
slowly, because he couldn't write short-
hand. - -
Jimmy says it made the real lady sit
down in the road and have some
hysterics, and the chauffeur told her he
didn't see anything to laugh at except
the policeman's silly face.
Jimmy says the chauffeur looked at
the mastiffs and asked the dog-fancier
if he was going rabbiting; it made the
milkman very happy, Jimmy says.
Jimmy says the man dressed up in
woman's clothes turned out to be a spy
who had escaped from a concentration
camp, because they got some authorities
who could swear at him. Jimmy says
that when the magistrate heard that
there was only one camp-stool, and
that the German spy sat down on that
himself, he said the real lady must be
the German's wife, and it turned out
he was quite right. -
Jimmy says the chauffeur might
have got off, but the milkman told how
he had called the other two a couple of
fools, and that proved they were friends.
Jimmy says old Faithful was so
pleased with himself that he wanted to
wrestle both of the mastiffs catch-as-
catch-can, and he kept daring them to
come out of their collars at him until
their necks began to look like hedge-
hogs.
Jimmy says Faithful sat up that
night telling another dog all about it
over the wireless telephone, until some
one switched the other dog off.

HUMOURS OF A REMOUNT CAMP.
“How HAPPY COULD I BE WITH EITHER..”
MANUAL EXERCISES
AND OTHER INCIDENTS.
WE are a Rifle Brigade. Of course
we haven't any real rifles nor are we
really a brigade. But on account of our
designation we do things differently
from the common infantryman, and
most of us do them differently from
any kind of soldier.
For the purposes of our business of a
Rifle Brigade we are possessed of a
number of obsolete weapons, dating
from the year 1870, nicknamed rifles.
They are cold uncompanionable things,
but, out of consideration for the feelings
of the enthusiast who acquired them,
we quite often take them about with
us. Luckily there are more men than
weapons and the laggards are compelled
to parade without arms. Until the
occasion to which I am about to refer
I have always succeeded in being a
laggard.
It happened just before Whitsuntide.
The parade was unusually small and I
was compelled to appear complete with
rifle. I admit that the thing made me
nervous, but I dragged it forth with an
assumed air of nonchalance and stood
| at ease with éclat. The Serjeant-
| major who was in charge of the parade
fright I arrived at a position something
resembling what I believe is technically
known as “the order.” In the pause
that ensued I ascertained that my
short ribs had only been contused and
not broken by the end of the metal
tubing.
“Shoulder—arms!” yelled the Ser-
jeant-major. I really believe that I
should have done that too if the metal
projection called the foresight had not
entangled itself in my coat. This made
me late on the movement, and the
Serjeant-major scowled at me. I was
cross about it too because the piece of
my coat which was hanging on the
weapon was a material part of the
garment. The movement not having
been entirely satisfactory, we were
directed to “order arms” again. I
endeavoured to make up for my pre-
vious laxity by extra smartness, but
misjudged the position of the little toe
of my right foot. Its contact with the
butt end of the rifle caused me to
exclaim and I was severely reprimanded
for talking in the ranks.
I confess that “Present arms " " had
me beaten, but I did my best. I
wriggled the weapon into what, as
far as I could judge from a side-glance
at my neighbour, was a correct posi-
eye lit on me I had a feeling that all
was not well. He strode silently but
relentlessly in my direction. A person
of less courage would have dropped the
treacherous instrument and fled, but
not I. Recalling the fact that I was
an Englishman and a soldier, I ten-
aciously stood my ground. The Ser-
geant-major paused for a moment in
front of me, and then he spake. I'will
say this for our Sergeant-major—he is
thorough. I never remember a finer
example of his thoroughness. When
at length his breath failed him he
sighed regretfully, and, with an air
of patient resignation, adjusted my
hands into a strained position which
seemed to cause him satisfaction.
I “sloped" the thing on the proper
shoulder and got hold of the butt with
the proper hand. One would have
thought that this would have pleased
even a sergeant - major, but he was
quite annoyed because I hadn't got the
trigger business facing the way he
liked.
“'Ow many drills 'ave you done,
Sir 2 ” Being no arithmetician I
couldn't help him, and he looked sug-
gestively at the recruit squad drilling in
the corner. Then he bethought him
that one fine day the hat would go round

sergeant-majors, and he only sighed
again and passed on.
When next we were due to “order
arms ” I tried to take a surreptitious
look to find out where my toe might be,
but the Sergeant-major at once made it
clear that this was against the rules of
the game. However, I missed my own
toe all right, but the man next to me
had to fall out. I was sorry about it,
but if a man can't lose a little thing
like a toe nail without all that fuss he
isn't fit to be a soldier. Fortunately
the Sergeant-major and I were agreed
on that point, so thre-incident passed off
without much unpleasantness.
As every soldier knows (and Ilearned
that night), the incidents I have de-
scribed are “manual exercises.” Having
done with them we passed into more
congenial and familiar paths of drill, at
which, when unhampered by a rifle,
I am no worse than some of the others.
Being a Rifle Brigade it is incumbent
on us to march with the rifle at the
“trail.” Everyone knows that to get
the rifle to the “trail” you give it a
cant forward and seize it at the point
of balance. Well, I missed it. This
bit out a large portion of my first
finger. I admit that this caused some
slight delay in the execution of a some-
what intricate manoeuvre. You cannot
all in a moment pick up a rifle, and
replace a portion of your finger in an
indifferent light. I explained to the
Sergeant-major that if I had waited till
the end of the parade to execute my
repairs the pieces of my finger would
have got cold and might not have
amalgamated properly, and that the
result might have been the loss of my
services to the corps for quite a time.
If I had known that you cannot con-
veniently “right about turn" with a
rifle at the “trail” the injury to my
neighbour's knee would not have occur-
red. What he and the Serjeant-major
said were both out of order. The man
had no more right than I to talk in
the ranks, and it wasn't the Serjeant-
major's knee that was damaged.
Thenceforward until the end of the
drill my neighbours gave me more room
and I did better, but I can't say that I
really got on friendly terms with that
implement. Still, there was no sus-
tained ill-feeling between the Sergeant-
pint he gave me some private and con-
fidential hints about the use of the rifle
which, if he was right about them and
I can remember, may come in handy.

House of Commons, Monday, June
21st.—When just now the new CHAN-

the clever construction of the scheme
and the clear manner in which it was

It was McKENNA's first appearance

Persevering Volunteer (wrestling with bugle in remote spot). “AH-H-H-H-Got IT AT LAST!"
House of Commons, Wednesday.—In
a speech occupying nearly two hours'
delivery, unusual length in active
war time, the MINISTER of MUNITIONs
explained his scheme of obtaining
sufficient supply at earliest possible
moment. Fairly full House recognised
scope of plan and systematised vigour
with which it is already set afoot.
Only criticism offered is that it comes
into existence ten months too late.
This, as SARK says, is the easiest
form of criticism, pleasing to the critic
as implying that had he been in charge
of the business such prompt commence-
ment would have been achieved.
JACK PEASE, free from trammels of
office and the pledge of secrecy that
seals lips of Cabinet Ministers, made
clean breast of the matter. Whilst
benevolently “begging the House not
to regard the new departure as reflection
on the sins of the SECRETARY For WAR
or the omissions of the late Govern-
ment,” he admitted that at beginning
of the War “we had no idea" of what
would be wanted in the way of muni-
tions.
ARTHUR MARKHAM, l'enfant terrible
of debate, noting this admission, ob-
served that there were a good many
lamp-posts in Whitehall. Who deserved
to hanged on them he was not
prepared to say. Incidentally, with an
eye obviously fixed on a particular
cardinal mistake that Lord KITCHENER
made was that of concentrating in his
own hands the work of the War Office,
down to the smallest details.”
Captain GUEST, home on brief leave
from the Front, his khaki uniform look-
ing uncommonly fresh considering ten
months' service, made simple eloquent
appeal for more munitions.
Business done. — LLoyd GEORGE
brought in Bill providing for increased
supply of munitions. The Central
European Powers are, he said, turning
out 250,000 shells a day. “If we
are in earnest,” he added, amid loud
cheers, “we can surpass that enormous
production.”
Thursday.—Sitting chiefly engaged
in discussing Local Government Vote.
WALTER LONG in moving it mentioned
that twenty-nine years have elapsed
since he first went to the Board. Re-
turning to his early love finds her
much changed.
In course of conversation, HAYES
FishFR quite incidentally mentioned
that next week a Bill will be introduced
authorising a system of National Regis-
tration. Scanty audience greeted mo-
mentous statement with feeble cheer.
Business done.—Committee of Supply.
“The Government was investigating the
cause of the great increase in the export of
yarns to neutrals.”—Egyptian Gazette. .
MY LADY'S GARDEN.
My lady's little garden
Was fair of old to see:
Here foxgloves grew of every hue,
The sweet, though lanky, pea,
The mignonette and pansy—
All blooms that smile or smell
With many a name, Iown with shame,
I've never learned to spell.
I loved my lady's garden
In those dear days gone by ;
It helped me drown the thought of
town
And dull old care defy;
Amid its Summer fragrance
I'd sit out eve until
All earth was dumb save for the hum
From Philomela's bill.
To-day my lady's garden
Exhales an air of gloom,
A sombre green pervades the scene
Where blushed full many a bloom;
For oh! this former pleasaunce
On which I set such store
Is crammed with “veg.” from edge to
edge
To help her through the War.

AT THE PLAY.
“MORE.”
At the Ambassadors Theatre (bijou)
|| there is a sort of intimate gaiety
| lacking in the larger Halls of Revue.
One is reminded of the Follies, but rather
regretfully. For though the company
gives you “odds and ends” of fun there
is little enough either of wit or humour
in the words. A duller monologue than
that of The Author (represented by Mr.
MoRRIs HARVEY) in search of an Idea
can seldom have been composed; though
Mr. GRATTAN disarms criticism by his
frank admission of hopeless vacuity.
A parody of something stupid should
not only be stupid itself, but should
reproduce the particular stupidity of
the original. And Mr. GRATTAN's
burlesque revues fulfil admirably these
requirements. A smaller man might
have been tempted to import some
alien element of cleverness; but Mr.
GRATTAN avoids this snare. His imita-
tions are a triumph of banality. The
trouble always is in these cases that
some of the audience will insist on
enjoying the banality on its own merits,
mistaking it for a product of creative
art. This is very unfair to the author,
| yet I do not think that Mr. GRATTAN
resents it. He does not even mind your
his imitations by the rival claims of the
ladies who interpret them.
Apart from these burlesques, to which
the best of the humour was contributed
by Mr. LEON MoRTON, and the pre-
cocious little Miss BETTY BALFour,
whose aplomb is superb (I wish there
had been more of it), we had the usual
clever imitations of actors' voices, done
in the dark, though that did not help me
to recognise Mr. ARTHUR BourchIER's
vocal methods; and an excellent
scene of an Italian restaurant, where
Miss IRIs Hoey illustrated the com-
manding superiority of her sex when it
comes to a question of securing the
attentions of a waiting staff. In
justice to the male with whom she
competed it should be said that his
test took place in a British tea-shop.
There was also a pretty scene from
the crinoline period, and yet another
burlesque, of melodrama this time, not
too subtle. A good deal of Miss ALICE
DELYSIA met the eye in most of the
trifles that went to make up the even-
ing's medley. Altogether we amused
ourselves very passably, and indeed I
blame myself for not having laughed

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)
It is pleasant to watch Mr. F. S. OLIVER in Ordeal by
Battle (MACMILLAN) hammering upon the noses of his and
his friends' enemies, or gaily drawing the fangs of his
particular black beast, the political lawyer, and to reflect on
the charming appositeness of that honoured pseudonym
Pacificus. But in truth one cannot jest about this pro-
foundly serious book. Here is a writer who is abundantly
justified by the result in breaking the silence of that loyalty
which constrains even the most talkative and critical of us
plain men—a writer who can classify and summarise his
political thinking in swift phrases which have the bite of
epigram with a wit and precision Gallic rather than
British. Yet not its wit or its lucidity but the fire and
sincerity of it make this book. Of necessity hurried, it is
neither hasty nor glib. Behind it lie the thoughts of strenu-
ous years. There is anger in it, but not a mean or a cheap
columns, but the appearance of 1914 and Other Poems
(SIDGwick AND JAckson) seems an occasion on which a
departure from this rule may fittingly be made. Of this
little volume, which contains the last things written by
RUPERT BRooKE, it can be said at once that no one who
cares for the heritage of our literature should omit to read
and possess it. Inevitably from the circumstances in which
the collection has been made it includes work of unequal
value, some of which perhaps the poet himself might have
wished to amend. But of the best of it, and especially the
five already famous sonnets with which it opens, one can
only repeat a criticism made upon their first appearance:
they will rank for ever among the treasures of English
poetry. Even to-day we can be grateful that the writer
lived long enough to leave behind him a memorial of such
dignified and noble beauty. Not that the book is all
solemnity. No record of RUPERT BRooKE could forget
his laughter; it sounds delightfully through the buoyant
audacities of “The Fish's Heaven;” more gravely through
stroke. With more truth
than such heroic simplifi-
cations usually possess he
sets before us the German
system as, essentially, the
domination of that always
baleful thing, the priest-
hood in politics—that is .
of the highly skilled and
drilled “pedantocracy”
with its irrevocable dog-
mas and surrender of all
critical judgment; our own
British scheme as, in
effect, the creation of the
dominant lawyer, not so
much corrupt as corrupt-

precedents, ordinances, ap-
pearances than of realities;

pleads that we have been given (are being given) the stone

He criticises with a welcome frankness the incredibly futile
reticences, the unmeasured distrust of the people, the
empty-smooth phrases of the politicals—such, for instance,
as “the triumph of the voluntary system.” If we win it

not merely ridiculed but denounced the great soldier who
warned them of this “calculated" war and the price of
averting it. Do they make any amends, register any con-
fession of mistaken judgment? Let me as one who humbly
fought in their camp and murmured their shibboleths
answer regretfully for them. They do not. Mr. OLIVER

“light a candle which will not soon be put out.”
me to the proud conclusion that I am not easily to be baffled
by their mysteries; so it is incumbent upon me to confess
that Sir A. ConAN Doyle, in The Valley of Fear (SMITH,
ELDER), has fairly and squarely downed me. The first of
his tales is called “The Tragedy of Birlstone,” and here we
have as rousing a sensation as the greediest of us could
want, and Sherlock Holmes solving the problem in his most
scientific manner. In the second tale, “The Scowrers,”
the scene of which is laid in America, we have the story of
a society which devoted itself to murder and crime, and we
discover why Mr. Douglas, a Sussex country gentleman,
was concerned in the Birlstone Tragedy and was also a
doomed man. “The Scowrers” is rather overcharged with
bloodshed for my taste, but in spite of this I can only
praise the skill with which a most complete surprise is
prepared. Respectfully I take off my hat to Sir ARTHUR.
In addition let me say that dear old Watson is actually
allowed a short but brilliant innings, for I can imagine no
finer achievement on his part than to score one off Sherlock,
and this for a fleeting moment he is permitted to do. (Cheers)

THE INCORRIGIBLES IN HOSPITAL.
IN the first bed on the left as you come into the ward was a red-haired trooper of five-and-twenty, with a
cradle to keep the clothes off his wounded leg.
“Yes, Sir,” he said to my greeting; “knee-cap for me, an’ rather a mess of it. I haven't quite decided whether
I'll have the leg off, or just go about with a stiff 'un. I'm leavin' that for the doctor. It's his funeral, after all,

“I hope it won't be a case of amputation,” I said. Then, waving my arm vaguely, “And what is it like out there?"
“Firs’-rate, Sir! Firs'-rate, if it wasn’ for those bloomin' allymets what they deals out for matches. When I

all right. But them allymets—they must ha' 'sphinxiated hundreds of our pore fellers, I give yer my word!”
I dispensed cigarettes of the peculiar kind that Tommy seems to love best, produced an illustrated paper, and
after shaking hands went along to the next cot.
“Well,” I said, “and how are you?”
“Oh, fair to middlin'. I was in luck's way right up to Noove Chapel, but after that the only jam we
ever got was plum, an' you can get pretty tired o' plum jam if you 'ave enough of it, even without a bullet

“War's war,” I remarked limply.
“That's right enough, Sir. But jam's jam, an’ if Lord KitchENER knew the old reg'ment was restricted to

Sir, 1 don' mean t’ grouse, but 'ow anybody with any pertence to knowledge o' strategy an' ta’tics can expec' a
man to fight 'is ugliest on plum jam—well, it can't be done, Sir! Otherwise you might say that this 'ere war is
bein’ conducted in a very businesslike fashion, an’ K. can't look to everything 'imself, it's on'y fair to admit.”
The next man's face was swathed in bandages. Only his eyes could be seen as I approached him, but there
was an opening through which he could speak, though thickly.

“Oh, I'm all right, Sir!” he said. “I'm as light as rain now, though I'd ha’ chosen some other kind o'

knock-out if I'd 'ad the choice. You see, Sir, when I lef Aldershot at th' beginnin' of August I was what you might
call engaged to a young lady wot was in the saloon bar at one.o' the best 'ouses in the command, and she'd made me
promise 'er that I'd grow a moustache. Well, after about a week it stood straight out from my lip, and I says to
myself, “She’ll find this inconvenient,' I says. So I took th' advice of our Colours, an' 'e told me that it was a
case o' givin' it rope. “It'll be all right, Clarke,' 'e says, “if you let it go. After shavin' the lip for a few years the 'air
always comes a bit stubborn-like, but if you let Nachure take its course, it'll smooth down an' lie flat, an' there
you are.' He said, did Colours, that I had tons o' seed, and as soon as the crop got a decent length it would soften up
an' be a credit to th’ comp'ny. ºr
“Well, when we gets over th' water, the first time I had a chance of lookin' at myself in a glass I sees that
th' ol' moustache is doin' great. An', Sir, in five weeks it was a-curlin' round into proper formation, as you might
say, an' I could twis' th' ends up, an' there wasn’ one of our orficers what had a better kiss-me-quick nor
what I had. So I writes home to my girl, tellin' her th’ news, an' promisin' tº have my photo took at the firs'
opportunity. You may laugh, Sir, but when a girl 'as set her heart on anythink like a moustache she'll have it, no
matter what happens ! - -- ?
“Well, I goes on with th' trainin' of it, an' I ain't ashamed t' say that there wasn', a better moustache
in our Brigade! An' then, jus' as I’d about decided that I was prepared tº face the beautyscope, an' git a picture
took, them bloomin' 'Uns enfiladed our line o' trenches one mornin', an’ knocks me head over heels. That was
nothink, as you might say; but, when the bearer-party picks me up, one of our drummers says, “Your moustache
'as disappeared, Clarkey, ol' sport l' - -
“I puts my hand up to my mouth, what feels a bit sore an' cold, an' blow me if half my top lip ain't gone!
My teeth was there all right enough, but half the lip had gone. Oh yes, they've patched it up all right, but
they had to take a bit o' stuff off my shoulder to do it, an' nothink won't ever grow on that. At leas' that's
what the R.A.M.C. officer said. Now ain't that enough to break a man's 'eart? Ain't it, Sir?”
I said that it was hard lines, but he might have lost worse than a moustache. - i
“I've no doubt you mean well, Sir, but you ain't married, I can see. You ain't nobody's 'usband. You ain't
even nobody's fioncy / An arm or a leg, now—well, that's only a regrettable incident, as you might say, but
to lose your only moustache, after all the trouble o' bringin' it up in the way it should go, after greasin' it with
vaseline an' wipin' your mouth after ev'ry mouthful o' corfee, an’ takin' care ev'ry time you lights a ſag—why,
I'd twice as soon 'ave 'ad my 'ead off, an' chance it !” - -
Everywhere the same story—grumbling (or, in their own charming argot, “grousin'") about trifles like
a lost pipe, and making child's play of injuries little less than fatal. If you doubt my word, load yourself
up with cigarettes, bar-chocolate, and illustrated papers, and turn into the first military hospital you find, and
you shall understand why Mr. Punch was right in calling them “The Incorrigibles,” God bless 'em
By the way, talking of Mr. Punch, I think I must have seen him that day at the hospital. For I noticed
a venerable gentleman with a hump at his back handing a book to one of the Red Cross nurses. He had a
brave smile, though his mouth twitched a little, and I overheard him say, “This is a little present, my dear
young lady, for your gallant patients; and I hope they'll find some of my love for them in its pages.” And
when he had gone I looked to see the name of the book; and it was Mr. Punch's
One jumbrel and forty-(Fighth tolume.
